Updated review","Came back here on a Saturday for brunch with my mom and cousin as they wanted to try out Sarabeth's in the city it was founded in (fun fact: Sarabeth's has a location in Taipei, my home city, so that's where we first heard about Sarabeth's). We were seated after a 5 min wait or so as I've made a reservation beforehand.Food wise, we ordered the following: Goldie Lox, Eggs Benedict, and Chicken Sausage & Kale Frittata with Avocado. I didn't get to try the Eggs Benedict as my cousin ordered it but she really liked it and gave it a 5/5 rating. I got the Chicken Sausage & Kale Frittata with Avocado, and despite me not being an avocado fan, I really liked the dish! The seasonings were pretty balanced, egg was cooked properly, and overall, the ingredients together made it a well balanced dish in terms of food groups. Was also a big fan of their banana muffin as it was quite soft and delicious. Would highly recommend getting this dish!In terms of the Goldie Lox, I wasn't too big of a fan this time because it seemed to be saltier than the last time I tried it? My mom got this and she couldn't finish it as it was definitely too salty. Also the raisin scone she ordered as a side was quite dry and thus, not too appealing. Those  were the only reasons why I give Sarabeth's a 4 star review.For dessert, we got their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, which I absolutely loved! The pancakes themselves were so so fluffy and the lemon flavor really came through (though I must admit I was missing some of the ricotta). Otherwise, the pancakes with the syrup and butter was a bomb combination and I would definitely order this again!Otherwise, the food here is still pretty solid and I would come back again if I'm craving for some good American brunch!",,,
1,Danny L.,"Montgomery, MD",114,4,0,4.0,11/11/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Only a 20 minute wait. There are only 2 reasons why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars. 1 is the service. Everyone was nice but not particularly attentive. I sat with an empty water glass for way too long and it took quite a while once we were done with our meal for the waiter to clear our plates and bring us the check. It wasn't particularly busy, either. The second reason is the bathrooms. Given the beauty and cleanliness of the dining area, I expected the same for the restrooms. Instead they have pretty run down, not well kept facilities. The food was great, the drinks were strong, the atmosphere was lovely. All in all a pretty good experience.",,,
2,Pier-Angeli H.,"New York, NY",12,81,43,5.0,10/26/2018,"What a pleasant experience, honestly I was very pleased with the service as well as the atmosphere. I had a brunch type of date with my girls and it was a time to remember. The drinks were fantastic and their chicken kale tacos are my fav! Words can not describe how wonderful this place is, and the happy hour is reasonable and worth it.They also make flower infused drinks that absolutely must try!",,,
3,Anita N.,"Avondale, AZ",34,152,87,5.0,11/16/2018,"One word that comes to mind when trying to accurately review Sarabeth's - Clean.Everything from the restaurant itself to the attentive waiters, to the plating and flavors of the food itself. We arrived for an early brunch with coworkers and wanted to beat the rush. It got packed quickly so keep that in mind. The staff was so great though, friendly, gave recommendations, didn't hover, promptly cleared plates and refilled drinks. The food was also sent out with perfect timing and impeccable looking like something from a photoshoot. The food was super delicious, not too heavy, we were able to enjoy multiple things. I couldn't find even a single nitpicky fault with this place, 5 stars all around, it was perfect for my first ever NY brunch.",,,
4,Aditi L.,"New York, NY",393,13,10,3.0,10/20/2018,"Nyc, you can do better!I don't eat eggs so wouldn't have come here unless it was my friends bday. I got the avocado toast sans egg and asked for banana as a side to compensate. Given the many avo toast options around, this one didn't live up to my expectations. Avocado was thinly spread on the bread and I was left wondering where to grab food next. The avo toast wasn't well seasoned so I asked for some hot sauce and pepper flakes to make it better. (Before and after attached).",1,,
5,Robert H.,"Manhattan, NY",173,4,7,3.0,10/20/2018,"Sarabeth's is culture-less, plain, and overpriced.Eggs Benedict 4/5 flavor and overpriced but they were a decent size. Also got a basket of muffins for the table (comes with four) and they were pretty average.They had us wait 10 minutes even though we had a reservation and the server wasn't very accommodating to a friend who didn't eat egg. She had to fish out possible substitutes instead of having them being told to her. Overall the waiter was just a bit ""off""Food came out pretty fast though and latte was fine. Their special vanilla brandy was delicious though. Wouldn't come back though or recommend it to a friend. There are better spots in the city. Average place if you have money to waste.",,1,
6,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,4.0,7/3/2018,"We were surprised that swanky Sarabeths in this flat iron area outpost offered $4 on all draft beers for happy hour with $5 bar bites that ranged from deviled eggs to tacos, a $3 slider, $2 jumbo shrimp and $1 oysters.  The place feels generic upscale hotel and the service was as seamless and friendly. Maybe it's the off the main path location, but this happy hour with the low prices and ambiance is a super good find in Manhattan. If your a tourist, it's not far from the Empire State Building and Penn Station.  If your a local,  this place is removed from tourist attractions.  On our visit there were maybe 4 people at the large wrap around  bar around 4pm, and the restaurant was dead.",7,1,8
7,A K.,"San Clemente, CA",3,55,222,4.0,10/21/2018,Good food great service!  The food is good but the service is great!   I recommend the crab cakes. Everything we tried was good. Also the table next to us had a Lobster Roll and ceviche. It looked amazing.  They recommended it. The wait to get in was about 20-30 minutes.,,,
8,Ana R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,12,24,2.0,10/25/2018,"I was pretty unimpressed by my meal at Sarabeth's. I ordered the avocado and burata toast and was shocked at how little avocado they gave for a dish that cost $18 (pre tax and tip), as well as the fact that half of my bread had air holes in it. I understand that there are other costs associated but for the price I paid I was shocked that I got toast with a smear of avocado, and a few pieces of arugula. A friend ordered the $14 fruit bowl which was essentially all grapefruit and banana, and also felt like a bit of a rip-off.Service was standard and the restaurant itself was fairly busy and decent. But honestly wasn't anything special and after the complete misalignment between price and expected quality of the food I definitely wouldn't go back.",,,
9,Anne M.,"Wilmington, NC",63,143,134,4.0,9/22/2018,"Really cute place!  The location is perfect (right across the street from the park) and the ambiance is lite and fun.  I met some of my fellow travelers here for lunch.  We sat inside but would have loved a table outside.  They do not take reservations inside (or outside I believe).  We ordered a salad, soup and sandwich and avocado burrata toast.  They were all delicious and quite filling.  None of us finished our meal.  The door service was great but table service could have been better.  I rarely say this because I like to try different places but, I would certainly return.  The location and atmosphere is just too much fun.",1,,
10,Darryl N.,"Taos, NM",0,33,36,2.0,11/3/2018,"Sadly this breakfast spot has gone WAY downhill since it opened.  The service was slow and spotty and the food was coldWhen it arrived.  The location is ideal, but Sarabeth's needs to dial things up.",,,
11,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,569,74,4.0,8/19/2018,"Sarabeth's is an ""upscale"" diner serving the usual diner staples (pancakes, omelettes, burgers, and so forth) but with much nicer internal decor (that gets passed onto you in the form of higher prices, of course) and noticeably better ingredients.Gourmands of NYC -- and I am one of them -- like to rag on Sarabeth's and use it as a punchline, but I'm here to defend it, especially given how awful my experiences have been at many recent NYC diners (Sarge's, Big Daddy's, I'm LOOKING AT YOU.) There's something to be said for a reputable regional chain that imposes clear standards on all the individual stores and thus allows the brand itself to stand in as a seal of quality for the consumer. It's why you often hear me questioning the romanticization of one-off mom-and-pop stores and praise the centralization of Starbucks, CVS (until recently), and of course, the gawd Jeff Bezos's Amazon.com.Obviously, this doesn't mean that I prefer chain restaurants over superb independent restaurants. But if I'm in a hurry and know I want standard ""diner food"" that's assuredly better than the hit-miss stuff at independent places, you bet I'm going to Sarabeth's.BTW, the omelettes we had were outstanding, and the muffins are [fire emoji] * 3.",4,1,1
12,Joyce C.,"New York, NY",0,30,91,5.0,8/25/2018,"Me and my friends went there for dinner last night.  We had a fantastic time here.  So I don't understand why it only have 3 stars rating in general. The restaurant is spacious, quite with simple and classic interior.  Especially the music is not loudly at all not like some other restaurants that you need to shout when you talk to each other.  I personally love their booth seatings which is very comfortable which is enough space for four of us.  They have a nice bar in the front which you can enjoy a drink when you are waiting for seats or just hang out there.  They have a very good happy hour drink and food menu(3:30 to 6:30).  We liked their drinks. We loved all our dishes.  We shared 3 appetizers (octopus, tuna tartare, crab meat guacamole & chips)and each of us ordered our main courses (duck breast, skirt steak, scallops and salmon).  I personally like the octopus, crab meat guacamole and scallops the most.The service is very friendly and attentive.  Also all servers had good smiles on their face which I very appreciated.  I already put it on my list for team lunch or friend gathering in the area.",,,
13,Sharon L.,"Melbourne, FL",321,200,215,2.0,9/20/2018,"Sarabeth's? More like Sarahblech's. Really below average food. Salad is just a giant thing of lettuce with a few pieces of dry chicken. Mushroom soup was OK, room temperature really. Fritata was the only thing decent on the brunch menu.",1,,
14,Keith H.,"American Fork, UT",357,92,212,5.0,9/12/2018,"Okay whoever has been eating this place like crap are just snobs haha this place was nice and the food was quality!  I got the salmon eggs Benedict and it was killer.  Maybe it's just my uncultured western taste buds, but this place nailed it.  Brunch done right!  Just ignore the bad reviews and give this place a go, you won't regret it I promise and if you do take a good look in the mirror and realize how spoiled you are with good food in your life and just smile cause I'm jealous of you ;)",1,,1
15,Mercedes F.,"Peabody, MA",383,243,410,4.0,2/7/2018,Food was okay! Omelette was not as full as I expected. The home fries were delicious! I will go back for those. The inside was huge and I loved how white it was very classy.,1,,
16,JiHae L.,"Sunnyside, NY",111,168,572,3.0,3/3/2018,"I went here for a birthday brunch this afternoon. The restaurant was super packed during this time so orders got mixed up. Sometimes we couldn't find our server so had to ask someone else to help us out. Our waters didn't get refilled on time, and one of the drink orders didn't come so we had to keep asking for it. A little bit unorganized. Maybe they need more staff?? Also the restroom seemed a bit far from the seating area. Needed more toilet paper as some stalls ran out. But it's a nice atmosphere, and I liked our seating arrangement. We were seated in a booth area which was nice. We were told that it's a popular booth. Anyways, we ordered buttermilk pancakes to start off. It came with strawberries, syrup, and butter on the side. I liked it a lot since it was so tasty. For the entree I tried the hash and sunnyside eggs on top. I had to ask for hot sauce as it needed a kick of some sort. My friends all seemed satisfied with their entrees.At the end, we ordered dessert and it hit the spot. I really enjoyed the banana split out of all the desserts. The server gave us a dessert on the house with a candle on top since it was my friend's b-day. It was really sweet of her. All in all, I may or may not go back.",,,
17,Beth M.,"Queens, NY",10,81,40,3.0,11/3/2018,"The service at Sarabeth's is excellent. However, the food is just okay. It has the right elements but it need to be elevated to a higher standard, so it can stand out more. The ideas are goods, but the flavor of the food needs to have more seasoning or richness.",,,
18,Connie R.,"East Norwich, NY",45,68,41,4.0,1/16/2018,"Had client brunch here. Perfect spot.  Clean, simple, modern and elegant decor.  Service was impeccable.  Constant refills of coffee and water.  The server was patient, b/c it took us some time to order.  I ordered the kale and eggs which the waiter explained was a kale salad with eggs on top.  I was very pleased he told me what to expect because there was no description on the menu. I was picturing scrambled eggs with kale mixed in.  So, I ordered it anyway because I love salads.  It came with smoked marcona almonds and roasted brussel sprouts..  It was unbelievable.  I got the dressing on the side. I didn't even need to use it because the salad was alive with flavor.  I did taste it though and it was tangy and sweet, very nicely balanced.  My companion got an omelette and a toasted muffin which looked homemade. I didn't know, but he told me Sarabeths is know for it's muffins and bread... Learn something new everyday.Based on what I've heard over the years, my impression was that Sarabeths was a pretentious, haughty restaurant. I'm glad I was wrong.  I'll definitely be back to try more unique entrees.",,,
19,Kristen M.,"Philadelphia, PA",33,458,146,4.0,6/19/2018,"My party of three had a reservation for Sarabeth's at 1pm on a Friday. We arrived early and they seated us with no problem. I had the wedge salad and split the calamari with my two companions. I was happy with both of my selections, the calamari was especially good. My companions ordered twin meals, both having seafood cobb salad which was piled high with a generous portion of lobster, crab, and shrimp. I very much enjoyed the white ginger spritzer and my companions both had bloody marys. The prices are high, but the portions are huge. The service was great, so I'm not sure where all of the negative reviews come from.",,,
20,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",179,137,576,4.0,1/15/2018,"Famous nyc brunch spot. Do not expect to get a table without reservation for sure.Food here is great. We ordered frittata, egg benedict, shor ribs, and the famous lemon ricotta pancakes and four flowers juice. In general its a pretty standard brunch experience in nyc, a little bit crowded and noisier maybe. Good place for brunch experience, but you can find better food and environment elsewhere.",,,
21,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,422,1424,2.0,1/14/2018,"Basic brunch spot. There's a beautiful open feel to this restaurant but the food and service was just underwhelming. I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict special, which came with a small and simple salad on the side. The crab cakes themselves could have used more seasoning and there was barely any hollandaise sauce on the dish, making the dish rather dry to eat (especially with the dry textures of the fried crab cake and English muffin).Service was friendly but not attentive. It was hard to flag down our waiter so we ended up having to hold our hand out and waving around a few times to get any waiters' attention. Lastly, the meal overall was pretty expensive for what it was - it was close to $30 per person for a mediocre entree & plain coffee. Would skip this spot next time.",,,
22,Douglas A.,"Philadelphia, PA",29,375,254,3.0,6/18/2018,"This is a chain of restaurants in NYC.  My review is for the restaurant in the Flatiron District in midtown.   So as chains go, this is a superior spot for breakfast, lunch, or brunch.  It is huge and it has private rooms in the back along with some outdoor seating so it can meet your party's needs no matter what.  Service was equally superior and uber friendly.  My coffee cup never went unfilled!  Bright, pleasant and clean space inside.  So why the average rating?  Well the food looks like perfection, then things fall off.  My famers omelette had great ingredients including ham, gruyere cheese, and scallions but lacked any real flavor.  I know that is hard to believe given gruyere's strong flavor but the ham could have been Spam and the eggs were dry and tasteless.  Fluffy yes; taste no!  You can do better in a city of deliciousness!",,,
23,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",39,118,142,5.0,5/13/2018,"Quality brunch. Great coffee, cold pressed orange juice, salmon eggs benedict and zesty tuna salad with tomato. Sarabeth's is a go to brunch spot, and this location is nice and bright. Waitstaff is particularly attentive and provide great service. My salmon eggs benedict was perfection, and I like that it was served on two different types of bread. Perfect hash browns and I stole from my boyfriend's zesty tuna salad plate. Everything was tasty and it is a perfect Sunday brunch pick!",1,,
24,Brandon E.,"Providence, RI",120,308,44,3.0,5/29/2018,"Went at a prime brunch hour and the place was a ghost town, that there should have red-flagged something to us. Servers seem to be very uninterested with there duties and seem more like they're just waiting for the shift to end. Having read so many stories about Sarabeth's, it's truly sad that it's gone so far down since the older days. Another story of a venue using its newfound hype to cut corners and slack. Hope they turn things around here before it's too late",,,
25,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",975,190,913,5.0,11/24/2017,I have been working late night at my work for almost two years so I never have time to go have brunch anywhere. Sad because I love brunch. Well my husband found Sarabeth's where they have brunch everyday until 3. I'm so very glad that he did. I got the traditional eggs benedict. I wanted to swap out the ricotta pancakes instead of the small green salad served with my dish but my waiter told me no. It was delicious. Eggs were poached perfectly. The only thing is that the muffin that it came on was too thick. Oh well guess I'll have to go back for the pancakes for sure. He had the jalapeño omelet which was just as good as my dish. We also had a side order of sausage with apricots. Phenomenal!!Another small thing is that the waiter never came back to ask us how was our brunch. I have a major pet peeve against waitstaff not do so. But I was able to overlook that because the brunch was spectacular. Bottom line: we will definitely go back.,,,
26,Kristin M.,"Queens, NY",319,28,52,4.0,3/3/2018,"I truly enjoyed Sarabeth's. Go for the prix fixe menu, it's worth it.I work near Sarahbeth's and I've been meaning to try it for a while. I finally did Thursday and it was a great experience overall. Our waiter was kind, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. You can get actual half bottles of wine here, and the Pinot noir is delicious. Both me and my friend went for the prix fixe menu which is $40 a person. Most entree options are about $30 so this definitely was the most bang for your buck. Although the waiter said the baby kale salad is good, he highly recommended the tomato soup and that is 100% the move. It was incredibly creamy, and they gave you a pretty big portion considering it was part of a discount. For the entree I got the steak frites with truffle fries. The steak was perfectly medium, and the bearnaise sauce was also very good. The truffle fries complimented the steak very well, and they came out hot and fresh.For dessert I went for the caramelized banana split sundae. It came with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, strawberries, vanilla ice cream and a caramelized banana. It was the perfect end to a very good meal. I truly enjoyed my experience there.",1,,2
27,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,5.0,8/3/2017,"I love this location of Sarabeth's simply because it is LARGE and roomy, well lit and modern and new, unlike their many other locations that are cramped beyond belief and old and tired looking. And they take reservations. Great for groups and they have a private space in back for events too. I came here for a large group brunch. Had my usual scrambled eggs with smoked salmon (aka, the Goldie Lox). Great mimosa.Sarabeth's is a NYC institution for a reason - they do brunch right, they do the classics right and you can bring anyone here and expect a great brunch experience.",2,,
28,Ameera S.,"New York, NY",49,10,18,2.0,3/8/2018,"Went in on a weekday for brunch to see what the hype was all about. Ordered salmon eggs Benedict and French toast. The eggs were over poached and hollandaise sauce was tasteless. Though the menu says we can choose our choice of bread, but we were not asked and served what seemed like a day old bread. The French toast were much better but to be honest, I've had better in NY. The staff was cordial and crowd reminded me of why the restaurant was featured in gossip girl. Overall, I wish the food had been better. Because the price we paid for it was way way more than it should have been. Xoxo",1,,
29,Debra D.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/24/2018,I was there for a mommysbites holloween event.

Nice place and clean nice atmosphere to be In wether you come for breakfast lunch or what ever time you eat.,,,
30,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,3.0,1/15/2018,"With sixteen restaurants that span the globe, from Tokyo to Dubai to the greater NYC area, Sarabeth's is a success story that has brand recognition and cachet. You'll even find their preserves in Stop and Shop supermarkets in Long Island.With a burgeoning global empire, how does this particular outpost of Sarabeth's rank? What first strikes the visitor is the space and sheer amount of it. A walk to the bathroom and back felt like a journey, as if I'd return twenty years older to a world I wouldn't recognize. Tables, booths, banquettes, just about every possible seating arrangement can be found here. I'm unsure of the exact seating capacity but it feels like a Guinness book of world records contender for NYC Flatiron restaurants. I was reminded of certain mega-sized chain restaurants in the suburbs for point of comparison.But it's a beautiful, open space that immediately puts the diner at ease. I was especially pleased with the view from my table out onto 27th street, people watching central. (Or people looking into the restaurant as they go about their busy lives, such is the possibility with such large windows)The menu offered to me was a late lunch one, which spans the time from 3:30-5pm on weekdays. I started with an order of burrata toast before moving on to a pizza margherita.So there's a reason why most of my review has been about the interior of the restaurant and decor. My edibles were certainly pleasant and good enough. There's certainly better pizza options out there and I was being especially bold by not ordering Sarabeth's signature brunch type plates such as pancakes or an omelette. Far better than the pizza was a dessert trio of ice cream sandwiches, where each layer of ice cream was guarded by two different cookies. Decadent and delicious, offering up a welcome dose of that Sarabeth's magic. My cocktail was also spot on, a concoction of vodka and berries that had the color of Ocean Spray but the punch of a tsunami. Well done!So it's only fair to offer up based on items ordered a cautious three star review. There's potential for an update once, and if, I venture to try some Sarabeth's signature dishes. Based on this first experiment, I do think it's worth a visit.",4,4,4
31,Phil C.,"Boston, MA",810,802,2988,4.0,7/8/2017,"Came here for a late brunch with family on a lovely Sunday summer afternoon. I had heard a lot about Sarabeth's and had seen locations - as far as Osaka. The beginnings were largely a negative. The crab meat guacamole & chips was tasteless: all three parts. The crab meat was devoid of any crab flavor, the guacamole was like eating into mushy nothing, and the chips was like ""crunching"" into wobbly flavorless cardboard disks. The dainty muffins and sweet jams were tasty, admittedly, but not something I'd go out-of-my-way for. I went for the short rib hash with poblano peppers. It wasn't any mind-blowing but a bit of a deviation from the conventional. The peppers provided a bit of a different flavor to a regular hash. The short rib itself was decent, as it was fairly tender and flavorful. The over-medium eggs on top were perfectly cooked and that I can appreciate. Service was very polite and thoughtful. The only blemish was that I did not get my berry-corn muffin until I brought it up to a server. Otherwise, I appreciated the good service. On a side note, unless you decide to try the handicapped restrooms, the regular restrooms are a bit of a hike (going flights of stairs) from the dining area. The more premium price is for the atmosphere and name; not necessarily the food. 3.5 stars, but I'll raise it a tad because the wait staff.",25,13,22
32,Maxwell H.,"Manhattan, NY",106,66,57,1.0,11/8/2018,"A truly awful experience all around, from the incredibly rude and inattentive service to the bland, dry food. The tomato soup was essentially a bowl of cream. The tuna tartare was rubbery. The Turkey burger was like cardboard, and the guacamole that came with it was already browned when it hit the table. Not to mention the soggy fries. Plus, we waited nearly 30 minutes for the check. I'll never come back.",,,
33,Danielle K.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,5.0,10/13/2018,Been here for both breakfast and dinner and every time it has been very good and tasty.

34,Ryan S.,"New York, NY",356,1,0,1.0,6/10/2018,"Our waiter said that regular mimosas were unlimited, and he even clarified that one of the mimosas were not refillable. He regularly refilled our mimosas and the seven of us ended up paying 250 dollars more than anticipated. The managers refused to believe us and after an unproductive conversation we paid full price. This was my first experience with a bait and switch at a particularly well known restaurant. TLDR: We asked a clarifying question. We received a wrong answer that management refused to assume accountability for. Paid $250 extra. Lost my yelp review virginity for this.",6,2,
35,Ann L.,"Chicago, IL",551,87,136,4.0,8/14/2017,"My friend told me that Sarabeth's is a NY brunch staple that you just kind of have to try for the sake of being relevant, so I made reservations here when my sister was in town.Fast forward to Sat brunch, I had a long night & didn't want to leave bed, let along eat pancakes that I had little confidence would stay down. But, being the good sister I am, I dragged myself out of the apt & was eventually greeted by a spacious, classy venue. We were a party of 3 & had comfortable booth seating. The noise level was relatively tranquil, & we conversed without straining our vocal cords (which I always appreciate in Manhattan eateries). The waiters were pleasant, checking up to ensure we were enjoying our meal a few times throughout. We ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict, Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (special), the kale & eggs, and a fruit bowl. The food (I was feeling well enough at this point to eat--thanks for your concern) was good & well-prepared, although I wouldn't say it's the best brunch I've ever had. The eggs for the Benedicts were presented a little bit more uniquely, in a circular mold, that corresponded with the more upscale ambiance of the restaurant, although it did affect their runniness. The ""muffin"" was more of a corn cake that was grainy-in-the-good-way & well-toasted. The hollandaise was kind of lumpy, but the beautiful presentation of freshness of the fruit bowl made up for it. Would I be determined to come here again? Maybe if my parents were in town for the ambiance, but I've had more enjoyable brunch. So, the food's a 3, but the atmosphere bumps it up to a 4.",,,
36,Amy A.,"Howard Beach, NY",40,8,2,1.0,9/30/2018,"I went here around 4pm, there were more waitress than customers. However they don't pay attention to tables.

38,Kate M.,"New York, NY",0,44,0,4.0,10/1/2018,"I'd love to give Sarabeth's five stars, but I have to give them four after they ""lost"" our brunch reservation. Thankfully, after we proved via email we had indeed made a reservation, they found us a place to sit, but it was really crowded and we had to wait a bit.That said, the food here is excellent. The jam that they're known for is indeed good and the portions are a very fair size for the price (if you get the egg dishes like omelets, it comes with toast/pastries). The service, once we got past the dropped reservation, was very good; the food came out quickly and the waiter was always nearby and checked in on us.",,,

The syrup was light and just sweet enough. Mot wver sweet like store bought. The chicken apple sausage was cooked perfectly. I liked the grill marks that were present. The sausage was juicy, and the jam was a perfect offset.My daughter had a crabcake with salad and homemade chips. She didn't care for the chips, and said the salad was overwhelming. We had bottle flat water, which was continuously renewed and poured. It had a crisp and clean taste to it.The service was excellent. We were 15 minutes late of our reservation, but were accompanied with no problem. Everyone was professional and timely. Will return!!",1,1,1

I liked the European feel of the restaurant, a little upscale but not stuffy. The space was large and bright with a big wrap around bar at one end. The service was good but my omelet was not good. The muffin was decent but wish I would have gotten toast instead. My friend got the waffle of the day and she said it was good but not great. The best part of the meal were probably the cocktails. The prices were pretty expensive for the quality of the food so that's a bit disheartening. I probably wouldn't come back for their brunch but would be willing to come back for lunch or dinner to give that a shot.",,,1
41,Florence R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,6,0,3.0,9/27/2018,"Atmosphere was great but the food was just okay. I ordered the salmon omelette and it was more like a eggs with salmon sprinkled haphazardly on it. The cream cheese was not spread out over the eggs and salmon. Instead it was in glob right in the center of the egg salmon heap. I found out when I dug into it halfway through the omelette... The almond toast on the other hand was outstanding. Soft and fluffy complemented by a delicious almond crunch. One final thought, the men's restroom didn't have paper towels. Normally I don't care but at a higher end place like this a dinky under powered hand dryer is just an unpleasant surprise.",,,

(You could also choose a muffin or toast.) The entrees are average priced at ~$18-$20, but the sides are expensive ($8-9 each). However the bacon was very good and worth the money. They refilled my iced coffee without charging me for another one. They also have soy milk.

First impression is that it's huge for a place in NY! Which makes it more perfect because you're not crammed into a space. You can eat and talk comfortably without the slightest feeling of someone else lingering into your conversation. The staff was friendly and we were seated right away. Although I advise making a reservation because when we were heading out, I saw a huge line. I had the salmon Benedict while my friend had the cinnamon apple French toast. The Benedict was great but the French toast was the highlight. It was one of the best I've tasted and satisfied my sweet tooth perfectly.

He came to my table of 7 and was polite at first, but when we asked if they offered unlimited mimosas, he said he would ask and come up. Upon coming back he said the restaurant did offer this option for 14 dollars. Of course thinking that was a great deal my group kept the mimosas coming until we wanted our check and they said the mimosas were going to cost us 300 dollars. Demanding that i speak to the manager, she completely disregarded our comments and said she would call the police if we continued to debate the issue.

They serve it with a weird salad that isn't really even a salad but more like a lumping of various greens on a plate. No thanks. Honestly this was my least favorite meal i had in NYC.They also don't even poach their eggs but use one of those weird little molds to make them all uniform.

For lunch, we ordered their flat iron steak that came with an amazing tomato soup and truffle fries, lemon zested tuna salad, as well as an order of their lemon and ricotta pancakes. Their steak was well seasoned and cooked to perfection (medium rare) and paired well with the béarnaise sauce. The salad came with large chunks of tuna and their greens were crisp and sweet. The dressing added an extra kick to the salad and made it more flavorful yet refreshing.Was it a lot of food for two people? Definitely.

Updated review","Came in for brunch- which is what they are wildly known for. Had a reservation (thank god) for 6 but wasn't able to get seated until everyone was there. Once we all showed up we were seated ~20 minutes or so later, so it took a bit of time. The service was decent, they were out of so many things though. I had the salmon egg and cream cheese scramble which comes with a muffin or pastry (which is hilariously why I ordered this entrée instead of the salmon benedict) and they ended up being out of all muffins and pastries...... which was annoying. So I ended up getting fresh fruit which was just as good. The salmon scramble was good and a decent portion and also came with 2 slices of toast and orange marmalade and butter- super good, finished it all. The drinks are super pricey, at around $15 a piece for a mimosa, not to mention its not bottomless, so our brunch was definitely less fun :) . This place is very nice and fun for people watching because people dress to the nines here, but prices are too steep for what they offer and they run out of food for brunch pretty quickly. Overall, happy I had the experience but probably wont be back.",,,
66,Maedeh S.,"Stony Brook, NY",7,4,0,2.0,6/3/2018,"This is a pretty big place and has a chill vibe, nice staff and all. But let's be honest, the food wasn't good at all. I don't think my omellete had any seasoning whatsoever and it was mostly fluffy eggs with very very little of the toppings. Other people in my party said the same thing about their dishes.

It was where you begged your mom to take you when she came in from out of town. It served fresh homemade baked goods and delicious eggs. Those days, I fear, are past.We stopped in to this location a week or so ago, and while the service was friendly and nice, and they could take us without a reservation, it's a sad truth that Sarabeth's has lost its gleam. Paper napkins, no tablecloths, but at high white tablecloth prices. An omelette arrived without any side, or garnish, and the cheese inside hadn't melted. Muffins arrived cold, fresh from the fridge. The Bellini was bright orange, and tasted chemical and fake.The service was friendly, even when we sent our unmelted omelette back and asked for a warmed up muffin. But I fear that economies of scale have robbed a once elegant restaurant of much of its former charm. Change comes for us all, eventually, I guess.",2,,

Very juicy and perfectly cooked. I loved them. - the short ribs tater tots. Now that is where the place lost a star. The tater tots were very disappointing and were not tater tots. They were mashed potatoes mixed in with left over short ribs, made into a ball, dumped into breading and fried. It was NOT tater tots, it was deep fried flavored mashed potatoes.

Ordered Cobb Salad, Lobster Roll, and special Pizza with white truffle and asparagus. The pizza was just OK- didn't love the crust, it was a bit on the soggy side. The lobster roll was decent but also didn't compare to some other ones I've tried (I'm looking at you, Lobster & Burger). Chips that came with the lobster roll were soggy and not very flavorful- the coleslaw was also average at best. My friends seemed to enjoy the Cobb Salad, but it did not look especially appetizing to me. Cheesecake dessert was average. In my opinion, it's not worth for the price to go here.

I think what hindered the experience for me slightly was the price of the entrees, a little bit more on the expensive side compared to other brunch places that offer similar plates.I started off with the Bloody Mary ($13). The amount they give you is huge. It was like an endless amount of Bloody Mary. The drink itself was good. I was just meh on the pickled garnishes on top. Too sweet for my liking. For my entrée, I got the scrambled eggs stuffed popover. Overall, it was good. The scrambled eggs were cooked nicely, full of that scallion flavor with bits of creamy soft cream cheese in between. The popover was a little dry and overcooked but it was adequate with the meal. The side salad was nice and refreshing with the eggs. I also tried some of my friend's ricotta and lemon pancakes and found the portion to be plentiful and the pancakes to be nice and fluffy with a nice hint of lemon. Overall, it was a good meal.

At Central Park my friend had had one bite of her burger before it was swiped away, we didn't notice until it was too late. The manager offered a $10 refund, which I said was frankly not enough. So disappointed as people were from out of town, and this used to be a great go to. Will definitely remove it from my list.",,,

The parkside location has a much better ambiance than this location on Park Avenue, which really felt to me like a glorified diner offering what my breakfast buddy and I both felt was assembly-line service. My omelet (and the accompanying bread) was just OK - not bad, but nothing remarkable or worthy of a return visit.

My mom was born on 4th of July, so it was her birthday. We celebrated it with a party of 14. They set up tables in the backroom, in a quiet area which I liked a lot. It was more private compared to the front of the house. The server was OKAY, I wasn't too fond of him because he wasn't engaged at all with the guests and I; it seemed as if he was bothered and they also brought out the food to the wrong people 3 times. The food on the other hand, was delicious once again! My whole table ordered almost everything off the brunch menu (which was served on the 4th of July even though it's only served on the weekends.) I ordered the jalapeño, cheese & cilantro omelette with a croissant. It was delicious and flavorful! One thing I absolutely loved which I tried from my family members was the fluffy french toast (it was indeed fluffy!) & the egg & cream cheese popover!! OMG, the popover was so fluffy & delicious, I could not stop picking off of my uncle's plate. It was the most softest egg with the combination of the hard/soft bread. Wow, I was amazed at how good that tasted. Overall, this location was nice and had the same great tasting food!",,,

The pancakes are comfortably filling on their own, but I wish they offered combo-style dishes with waffles and eggs or pancakes and bacon. Instead, you'll have to order everything separately, and sausage alone is $9 .-. I highly recommend Sarabeth's Park Ave if you're in the mood to feel fancy for a meal.

This time, it was snowing, so we went from my boyfriend's apartment to the one on the Lower East- not as chic as the Upper East one, but does the trick. We sat down and it took about 20 minutes for us to decide- everything looked so great, as always! I'm a yoga sculpt instructor, so I'm trying to go light on carbs. My boyfriend got the fat & fluffy French toast with berries, which is always TO DIE FOR so good- perfectly sweet and crunchy, and I got the scrambled egg popover with chives and cream cheese. The eggs were fluffy and delicious, not too overcooked but not too moist. I don't really know why but it came with a side salad- not dressed but decent. The popover was divine. Excellent cream cheese-egg ratio. I stole some bites of his toast! He also got home fries. The service is pretty good, and there were cute hand-written specials on a board and jazz in the background- we had our brunch around 1 pm and it was not too busy.

When we showed up the hostess at the welcome desk did not even look at our faces or say welcome or anything just found our names on the list and told us to wait. After waiting for 15 minutes some girl came and asked is the whole party of 3 here we said he is here just talking on the phone outside, she said ok I'll let you sit when he is here! We were like can we sit because we r really tired standing here and she said NO AND LEFT. This was rude and unpleasant enough to ruin our morning. I booked the table from Open table and asked to get a table at the highchairs online but the rude lady gave us a table at the toilet-like room even though the high chairs were available.After we sit down, the angry tempered waiter asked us what to drink and he brought the most bitter and bad coffee I've had in Sarabeths. Then we ordered and waited for 1 hour for our eggs to come, my husband had the overcooked poached egg and it was so cold that I believe they made that dish wait for the other eggs to be ready for a long time. Everythting was so unpleasant and the welcoming staff is SO RUDE we will not be coming ever again. ---------It was absolutely amazing!

When I asked, they said oh, we ran out of croissants.  I asked for an English muffin instead.  The egg omelet was ok and did not come with the salsa as indicated on the menu.  My friend liked his French toast.  The server checked in once and we had to ask for our check.   When we arrived, the place was very busy, but by the time we left, the bar was empty and the restaurant was half full.  I was underwhelmed with Sarabeth's.  Food=ok, service=slow, atmosphere=good",,,

Not so bad that I'd complain but so uninspiring that we won't be back. The front desk/hostess staff was friendly and attentive, as was the manager. Our server had little interest in the table and we saw the back of the house staff most frequently when they brought our food. The food... oh the food... Meatballs were a 4, and the highlight of our dinner. We also got the deviled eggs which were fine, and we'd get them again if there more people to help eat them, but not so tasty that two of us wanted to split five of them. We went light on entrees - I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup & E. the chicken salad. Both dishes were ""left a lot to be desired."" Someplace between a 2 & 3. The grilled cheese sat in the window too long and the chicken in his salad was so dry as to be nearly inedible. Finally, dessert was good... E enjoyed the truffle chocolate  cake. My raspberry bread pudding was okay. Perhaps it's because I expected a hearty, homey bread pudding and this was not that. This last item is why they received a 2: Walking back to the bathroom via a slight maze of halls and it smelled like urine. What's more, the fabric walls were stained and dirty. Had I gone to the bathroom prior to dinner we would have left. Perhaps someone braver than me would have the courage to share this with a manager in person, but I simply didn't.

Stopped in on a Saturday around 1 pm and we were able to be seated after a 10 minute wait or so. I was a little confused why we had to wait at all because there were many open tables once we were escorted into the dining room. There was big bar, not busy either. The places was very open and inviting, felt slightly upscale for brunch, which I liked. The menu looked fantastic, lots of delicious sounding options. Their four flower mimosa was very different, had some secret ingredients in it, very unique, very delicious. A few of us got that and others had a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was not spicy at all, but it was flavorful, again, different. It took a very long time for our server to return with our drinks and an even longer time for us to place our food order. We weren't in a rush necessarily, but we found ourselves looking around wondering if our server was ever going to return. Anyways, their menu had lots of omelette concoctions, a few appetizers consisting of burrata, salads, soup and shrimp cocktail. They had breakfast pizzas, steel cut granola, sweeter breakfast options like your loaded pancakes, waffles and french toast and then various entrees. I decided to go with their quinoa crusted ahi tuna and it is hands down the reason for such a great review, it was amazing. The tuna itself was seared to perfection and the quinoa crust added a great crunch, I never need sesame crust again. It was served over a huge bed of kale, lightly dressed with some citrus, healthy, filling and fresh, all I could have asked for that morning. The portion was bigger than I expected, it was excellent. My friends enjoyed their breakfast pizzas and tuna salad as well. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely come back.

Greta and her team made our day perfect, and were incredible to work with throughout the entire planning process. I'm sure that Greta was a little skeptical when she first received our ""group brunch inquiry,"" but she is truly a master event planner who has thought of everything... even if Sarabeth's had never hosted a wedding before. The staff executed our ceremony and reception with precision, converting a 60-person ceremony space into a 60-person dining space - while all 60 people were inside of it - in about 20 minutes. It was beyond impressive. We chose to bring in a cake, and somewhere along the way, it got squished (unbeknownst to us). I later found out that the Sarabeth's team frantically went out to get a very elegant replacement cake for us on their own dime, even though they were not responsible. It underscored the level of quality service that they deliver. Our guests raved about the food and drinks at our wedding. I think some of them might have eaten entire platters of the lobster rolls. The bartenders were very accommodating, and thought nothing of several 20-somethings drinking multiple rounds of shots at 2 in the afternoon (um, myself included). Sarabeth's is legendary in New York for a reason. Yes, it is a busy restaurant for brunch, but the food is very consistent and the decor is impressive. I know if you're reading this, you're probably not going to get married there... but nonetheless, go there for a special occasion, with a big group of friends, or just for weekend brunch.

But it's only a smell, as I couldn't taste it. Overall nice toasts, but I'd much prefer Balthazar multigrain. It's also annoying that they make all the MealPass orders at once, so if you have a late pickup time your food will be cold, and cold sunny side up eggs are no good.

The Bloody Mary was the low light. Bland. I had to add both salt and Worcester sauce to get it to have any flavor. It had heat but no savory or salty. Highlights were a great avocado toast with burrata. Very nice dish with contrasting temperatures and textures. Same with the kale salad with sunny side up eggs. The salad could have had more kale (and therefore more crunch) but it worked well overall. I'd come back if in the area and craving a nice egg dish, and I'd try happy hour here (specials looked good). But I would try a mimosa, not the Bloody Mary. It needs a big makeover to be even decent.",,,

Not to mention the waiter just brought us a full one at the end of our meal and apparently charged us for it even though we didn't ask for it.  I know one shouldn't not  nit-pick little things like this at a ""fancy"" restaurant but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Although Sarabeth's has a bottomless brunch option, I wouldn't consider this the place to get your Sunday buzz on. There were lots of strollers, but not any kids running around. The menu options were pretty standard. I ordered the lemon ricotta filled pancakes which were pretty good.

However, there were literally THREE pieces of scallops... and the set costs $27. The egg Benedict was a joke. The hollandaise was too bland to be qualified to be hollandaise... even worse than an average diner's. Apparently we were still starved after these tiny dishes so we ordered a seafood salad. Portion wise it's ok but again.. BLAND!!! We couldn't taste the flavor of shrimps and squid and felt like just chewing rubbers. The ending of this terrible experience was a check of $101....

The dinner tasted ok but starting from the drinks right up until the sequence of serving dessert including 2 ice cold cups of coffee, it was a disaster. The insulting gesture came when the manager thought giving us a 15% discount card for use upon our return was going to make the situation right. I wouldn't go back if it was free. He should have reduced our bill during this disastrous meal. Overpriced and POOR customer service. There are plenty of less expensive quality restaurants in NYC. Do yourself a favor, stay away.",,,

The staff was friendly but slow and forgetful. The food was subpar. We ordered guacamole and it came with potato chips. It was weird. Whatever I had, maybe the tomato soup - gave me a very quick and adverse reaction which resulted in ordering an Uber and rushing home to my toilet for a couple hours.

This Flatiron location is really big and it was like a maze to get to the bathroom.Anyway, we got the chips with guac and crabmeat for the appetizer. Housemade chips are always a plus in my book, and generous portion of crabmeat was fresh!We also ordered the Seafood Cobb Salad, Buttermilk Pancakes, and Almond Crusted French Toast. The french toast was def my ultimate fave. It was just the right amount of buttery-goodness, and texture was crunchy from the almonds, but soft on the inside. I kinda just wished I asked for the strawberry jam on the side (since I'm not a fan of jam).Seafood Cobb Salad was a whole $30, but totally worth it when you see the amount of lobster and crabmeat they give you. The only thing they were missing was dressing, but maybe they did that on purpose so we can taste the freshness of the sea...Buttermilk pancakes were actually meh. I mean you can't reallllyy go wrong with buttermilk pancakes, but next time I shall try the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.Overall: attentive and patient staff, good food, spacious area, but a lil steep on the prices, but when you share it, it's not too bad.",,,

On the other hand, the crab cake dish was pretty and tasty, but just didn't have the kick I wanted.I give this place four stars because of the atmosphere and the fantastic and enthusiastic service.

The decor/atmosphere is much fancier than I anticipated, with interesting colors, wide, spacious, bright, and funky floors and walls. I was impressed, and it added more class than I was expecting. When looking at the prices, I was astounded. For breakfast, everything was extremely over priced. I know it is NYC... but for brunch... it was literally outrageous. I am the type of person that typically orders Pancakes, french toast, or eggs. But here, i was not willing to waste my money on something so pricy.

So I asked for plain black tea, please.  Thankfully he figured it out what that meant and I received it promptly - though it was lukewarm at best.  At this point my companion has decided on a drink and we've decided what to eat (the margarita pizza) and are waiting for the waiter to return to take our order...must've been at least 10-15 minutes until he returned. At that point I ask for skim milk for my tea (though so much time has passed, I'm basically done with it) and again he gives me this confused look, like I'm speaking another language.  We receive everything promptly after that and that is when we never see our waiter again.  I am pretty sure at least 45 minutes have passed since we are both done with our food and drinks, during which time I see our waiter attending to the other two tables offering them the dessert menu, filling their waters, etc.  He literally does not even walk near us.  Finally, I flag down a bus boy and ask if the waiter can bring our check and he comes within a couple of minutes.  At this point, my mood has soured, we've been sitting at this table for an hour and a half at this point and have been ready to leave for at least 30 minutes.  Maybe he forgot about us, maybe he just didn't care, but I'll definitely think twice before coming to this particular Sarabeth's and when I do, I'll plan to sit by the bar.",1,,

With that being said, when we head into town we do have some favorite spots to hang with my cousin. But we are always open to try a new brunch location, especially if the word on the street is good food or coffee....or dare I say alcohol. So my cousin said she had recently brunched at Sarabeth's and thought we'd like it, being our last day in the city we wanted good food and a casual vibe.We did make sure to get an earlier start than most New Yorker's probably do on a Saturday morning since we did have an early afternoon flight home. And Sarabeth's was open earlier than some other spots on a weekend. We showed up at 10 am on Saturday and there were plenty of open tables in this fairly large restaurant located Park and 28th. Service was great, we were served drinks and food very quickly at this earlier time. I ordered scrambled eggs in a popover with arugula on the side. I think they used 4-5 eggs so have a big appetite!

Luckily we were with a great group (of 8) or we would have been really upset at the incredibly long waits. Lowlights: 1) he offered bread, and evn after two prompts, only brought it AFTER dinner was served; 2) I had to get up and find him to interupt his conversation with another non-working waiter to ask for dessert menus.Food was medicro at best. While others enjoyed their dishes, my beet salad was pedestrian at best with bizarre goat cheese balls that were tasteless. The octopus was OK, but had many more pickle slides (?!) than octopus. I will say the ice cream sandwich flights were very good. Though even here, the cookies were not great and some of the ice cream seemed to have freezer burn.Overall, I would NOT recommend.

I don't mind paying more for interesting, yummie food, but what we got was just ""meh"" and we left frustrated.I got the steak which was fine but lacking flavor. Same for the fries, boring. I've been to so many places in NYC where they do a really nice job with seasoning, and it's just not what we got here.My partner got the berry bowl. Heads up, its just berries, there's no honey or anything else to make it interesting. He also got the short rib hash. It tasted bland. He had to ask for hot sauce just to jazz it up a bit. We ordered the s'mores in a jar for dessert, this was so over-sweetened I almost sent it back.The only remarkable thing we ordered was the four flowers juiceAll in it was $120 for two people. Totally not worth it. The service was good, though.",,,

It's what Ernest Hemingway may have had in mind when he wrote of ""a clean, well-lighted place"". Pros: Subdued ambiance; Fairly diverse menu; Half-bottles and full bottles of wine are on offer if you're not sure just how buzzed you want to get.Cons: Live music toward the front of the restaurant can be a bit loud; Extra restrooms are a journey and a half to get to - plus they're located on a sub-level after several isolated twists and turns that don't feel safe for a patron who may be venturing there alone. Overall: My friend and i had a nice time there, enjoyed a few snacks along with the one Pinot Noir that they had on the menu.",1,,1
191,Viviann L.,"Manhattan, NY",199,961,3813,3.0,3/20/2017,"Great food/wine and service at reasonable price. I like most things on their menu but my ultimate favourite is their lobster roll. Good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, although I prefer lunch or dinner. Great with kids, small or semi-large groups, or if you're on your own.",,,
192,Jingizban K.,"Manhattan, NY",50,242,121,3.0,6/6/2016,"This is a very good place to meet friends, or to bring visitors to. Clean, great decorated place with excellent service, took a star for the limited selection and another for being little bit too pricy for the food/portions they serve.",,,
193,Nina K.,"Manhattan, NY",246,73,29,3.0,12/6/2015,"After coming to this location, I've determined that Sarabeth's is better a) at Central Park South or TriBeCa and b) for brunch. My dinner here was fine, but definitely nothing special. The space is huge! Like, I nearly got lost on the way to the bathroom huge. And for an earlyish dinner on a Friday, there were tons of available seats when we arrived without a reservation. Highlights of the meal include the house Riesling and the crab avocado guacamole (very fresh). Our entrees, a special flatbread and wild mushroom risotto, were on the richer side but not very compelling otherwise. Lowlights include pretty slow service when trying to get the check and feeling underwhelmed enough to forgo ordering any more food or dessert. For the price and hype, I'd head up or downtown if Sarabeth's is a must-try on your list.",3,,

Updated review","Place has gone down hill. Took my coworker for her farewell happy hour. My coworker asked to have the table cleaned at the bar and after they cleaned it they gave the table to someone else. We had to tell the manager the problem with the service for them to realize. It was not like this before. When the top of the sangria pitcher fell off to the ground, they rinsed it and gave it back to us instead of washing it. They gave us guac and chips on the house but we're not apologetic. Won't come back again knowing there are multiple restaurants in the area with better service.",2,1,

Of course there are good happy hours at little dive places, but Sarabeth's offered a classy, fresh and professional ambiance with live music. Good was tasty and the price was more than reasonable for what you get, especially in that location.",,,
196,Sam R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,2.0,7/8/2017,"Not sure the hype with Sarabeth's. Went for brunch. Food was subpar. I don't think any of us finished our plates because it was just okay, kind of bland. Service was confusingly and sort of laughably bad. We must have had 4 or 5 different servers, all of whom thought our table was theirs. Two different servers at two different times tried to serve us coffee only to realize their coffee pot was empty. One didn't know what a latte was. Lots of clumsy reaching over and almost knocking over glasses. It was strange. It was almost as if they were filming a reality TV show where either celebrities or sophomores in high school are undercover as servers while some wacky hosts laughs at how they mess up from backstage. This restaurant just goes to show that if paparazzi get pictures of Taylor Swift leaving your restaurant once you don't really have to do much from there.",,1,
197,Mike M.,"Woodbridge, CT",41,3,0,2.0,4/14/2017,For a place known for their muffins they get a thumbs down. The muffins we ordered came out cold and dry. At least warm them up a bit before serving. Waiter and staff seemed disinterested and board. Service was fair at best. Eggs were cold and bacon was burnt to a crisp. 3 orange juices were ordered for the kids that came out in wine glasses really??!! You wanted to serve juice to kids in wine glasses?? My French toast was below average. For the price this place was definitely not worth it. Will never go back here again.,,,
198,Ed C.,"Philadelphia, PA",125,93,3,2.0,10/29/2015,"I came here for sunday brunch and left disappointed.  First the line in the morning was unorganized.  We show up and are told its a 30 minute wait for 2 so we take a quick 10 minute stroll. Come back in and are told they already called us and then now there are more people ahead of us who will be seated first.  umm, excuse me?  so we ended up waiting more than 30 minutes in total.  I should have left right then.absolutely do NOT get the grilled cheese.  I was told this place had good portions.  The grilled cheese came out kid sized with a kid sized portion of soup.  other traditional brunch items seemed ok but i left disappointed.  at least wait service and decor were pleasant.",2,2,1
