Once for dinner with a friend a few weeks ago and once recently for lunch with coworkers.  Definitely a hit with my taste buds both times I came! For dinner, I really suggest getting the lamb entree. It was so delicious, perfectly portioned to share, and the lamb was very tender.  For brunch, I enjoyed my baked eggs (albeit not caring for the spinach too much).I recommend checking this place out!  Service was good both times I came and prices are fair. One thing to note about them is that their lunch menu does not have too many meaty options, so if you are looking for a nice burger, this is not the place.",6,1,4
1,Rebecca D.,"New York, NY",20,69,714,3.0,10/13/2018,"This place was super cute. Came In For a glass of wine. They had a few wine options. It was a nice spot to stop in once. I really enjoyed the ambiance. Service was nice. We got wine and a few snacks. Cheese ""fondue"" - more like a Brie - great flavors with pickled okra and white bean. Would recommend. Shishito peppers - okay. Pretty plain. The yogurt sauce with it didn't add much in my opinion. Could use a spicy sauce or other seasoning of some sort.Would recommend it for the ambiance and the service. The fondue was good too!",,,

I ordered a salad and my friend ordered a lamb entree. Both taste pretty good, both have good portion, but nothing stood out as ""fabulous"".

For a picky eaters like myself, it is not ideal, so selected their pasta with red sauce. Pasta was good, but had a slightly salty taste I could not put my finger on. Husband ordered the fish and thought it was well cooked.Ambiance is nice with large open windows and cute decor. Outdoor dining, we opted indoors as it was very warm.Service was excellent. With so many options in the city, not sure if it is a return spot. We enjoyed ourselves, but not a fave.",1,,
5,Eric G.,"New York, NY",236,103,63,4.0,9/6/2018,"Had an excellent brunch here, the food itself was one of my favorite brunch meals that I've had in a long time. Every bite was delicious from the fresh bread to the eggs, sausage and those old bay potatoes. The restaurant itself is cute and it was busy when we were there but after we were seated we were ignored for quite some time and then once we ordered coffee it took about ten minutes for it to arrive. Service was slow and not attentive which made the experience less memorable. If I have to search and search for someone to help refill my coffee for ten minutes that's a problem and it's distracting me from my meal.",1,,
6,Vaani S.,"San Diego, CA",1089,244,582,5.0,5/16/2018,"We went here for brunch on a rainy NYC afternoon. It is an Abso-fucken-lutely awesome place.Food: We were a lot of people so we got a lot of stuff. The brunch menu is limited but not disappointing, there is something for everyone. We got the avocado toast, croque madame toast, meat-packer breakfast, warm poached chicken and everything was super good. The show-stealer is the House-made ginger yogurt, I can guarantee you wouldn't have eaten better yogurt.Drinks: They have amazing freshly squeezed orange juice. The coffee tastes good too, the coffee can be bought to take away as well. They have this earl grey drink called the Jumpstart which is super super good.Service: Since we were a large group, we had to wait for about 20 mins to get seated but as we got seated the food came quick. The server was very attentive and nice to us. In-all: I am crazy about this place and would go here whenever I get a chance again.Recommendation: The ginger yogurt is a must try. Well everything else is not very far behind in being amazing. So whatever you pick from the menu, you will not be disappointed.",11,6,11

We started out with some mimosas and some fresh baked pastries. The chocolate croissant was delicious but did not have that much chocolate. The mimosas were good however. The best part for me was the Forager breakfast sandwich. It's an egg sandwich with swiss, mushrooms, and kale, and its literally my favorite egg sandwich I've ever had. I didn't even miss having bacon or sausage.Service was good and the bathrooms are clean. I'd say this is just a typical brunch spot but that sandwich makes it stand out for me so I'll be back.",,,1

9,Shayan S.,"Oakland, CA",24,187,79,2.0,8/8/2018,"I'm pretty bummed out by my lunch experience here. But willing to give it another go. I was excited about having lunch here because I read so many great yelp reviews. Servers were very nice, they attended to me quickly, the gazpacho soup and kale/grain salad was even pretty delicious. ""So what's with the two star review?"" You're possibly wondering...well:1. It was small portions2. Too expensive for aforementioned small portions3. BUT THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PART was the dirty and chipped bowl, plate, and utensils they made me eat out of! The soup bowl had 2 chips in it, the salad plate had one chip in it. The saucer that held the soup bowl had yellow food left overs smudged on it and the fork had food stuck in between the prongs. (See pics for details)For a place that's so highly regarded and that kind of tries to give off a classy dining experience I definitely expect more than to be eating off of broken and dirty serve ware. It's one of the most basic rules of working in a restaurant. C'mon guys, I really didn't expect this from you. Only because of the other reviews, I'm going to try this place one more time for dinner, and I hope they clean their act up by then.",2,,

Would highly recommend everyone at your table getting the Hudson Street ""Choice"" (one starter, pasta & main each) and sharing, so everyone gets to try more delicious things. That's what we did and boy were we glad we did!Favorite things all-around. Definitely get these - amazing: - Stracciatella (starter salad)- Gnocchi- Smoked Paprika Mafaldine (pasta with rabbit)- Chicken in the Woods - Grilled skirt steakReally good things that some of us loved, while others thought were quite good but preferred some of the favorites above more:- Crispy broccoli- Housemade spaghetti- Fettuccini al limone- Skate a la plancha Both the octopus starter, and bread & butter were fine. Side note: they gave us bread with the pastas as well, so no reason to actually order this one.Pass on the Gem lettuces & Simply grilled fish. Both are very plain and not up to snuff with the rest of the meal.",3,,
11,Lauren N.,"New York, NY",227,7,0,1.0,9/24/2018,"I want to preface this by saying that the old menu at Hight Street on Hudson was AMAZING.  Sadly, they have a new chef, a new menu and NONE of the lovely pasta dishes they used to offer. They offer a very small offering now, none of which reflects their old dishes. :/",3,,
12,Matt B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,96,89,4.0,3/21/2018,"Had walked past this spot a couple of times and booked marked it as you do. We decided late to go out for dinner and got this spot late on open table. So pleasantly surprised. This place is the best 4 star I have given. I would easily give 4 1/2 star no trouble. Hard to get 5 stars, the wine list was ok, could have been a lot better, we got the matching wine with set menu, which was very good. Probably too much food to be honest, but no complaints. Started with the fish and chips which was fantastic, like a calmer version of ceviche. Top stuff. For the second course we got the two pastas. I had the tomato base sauce which you can see which was great, my wife thought the squid ink one was a little salty but I liked it. Finished with the chicken and the skirt steak. Both great. The steak took the cake though, it was excellent. With a garlic broccoli purée with it, with potato, 5 stars! Service - 5 stars Food - 4 stars Price - 5 stars - very good considering Ambiance - 4 stars, a little cramped but that's ok. Great place would definitely go back, and recommend.",,,

I also love the look of the restaurant - huge windows overlooking the street, dark wooden chairs and tables, and an open kitchen/bakery in the back. Modern and sleek.The food was great, though somewhat pricey for the amount you get. I particularly liked the Charcoal Grilled Octopus as a starter. I had the swordfish (Simply Grilled Fish) for the main course, which was great but nothing too spectacular.The service was fantastic though. I had been accepted to a medical school and surprised my family with the news during dinner. The waiter overheard us celebrating and brought us an extra dessert with a candle to congratulate me. It was a really nice gesture. I'll definitely be back here, especially since I hear brunch is when High Street shines.",,,
14,Joyce W.,"Boston, MA",457,457,1112,4.0,1/29/2018,"A delicious brunch! We came around noon and were seated even though it was prime Sunday brunch time.When we left around 1:30pm though, there was quite the line - so come early if you can!We got the Bodega sandwich (a fancy sausage & egg sandwich), the Forager sandwich (a tasty and cheesy vegetarian option), and the Meat Packer Plate (a HUGE way to get your morning started). Oh and because we are hardcore carb-lovers, we also got the Toast Board. Everything was super tasty and I honestly can't complain. The Bodega and Forager sandwiches look a little small but they're actually such delicious whompers! The Bodega is the fanciest, highest quality sausage and egg sandwich you'll encounter. You really can't go wrong with it. The Forager's mushroomy center was juicy and flavorful - all covered in a generous amount of swiss. As tasty as it was, it got a little too rich for me and I wanted a bit more dimension to the sandwich. My friend's Meat Pack Plate was amazingly big. I couldn't believe it when the waiter showed up with a really filled plate of eggs + meat and then a generous bowl of potatoes on top of it. And I gotta say, the potatoes were BOMB! Wonderfully crispy, perfectly cooked inside - and seasoned just right with enough Old Bay. It's a hard balance, but High Street has done it! As full as I was, I definitely made room for the Toast Plate because the breads here are amazingggggg. That magical crunchy crackle and crisp of the exterior, contrasted with the tender center = heavenly! Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Come to enjoy a super carb-y, super yummy meal!",1,,1

They do it this way, raised etc.Nice coiffed and teas . Service was great. Very nice staff.",,,1
16,Sonia M.,"Dallas, TX",258,45,24,4.0,7/2/2018,"Had a reservation for 2 for brunch on a Friday, it wasn't overly packed but I recommend making a reservation just in case. I had the the bodega breakfast sandwich & it might be the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life. The potato bun is so flavorful and crispy, the aged cheddar on the sandwich is to die for. I will say, it's SUPER heavy and filling so either go in with a big appetite or plan on sharing. I was full after a few bites, I wish I could've finished the whole thing!",,,
17,Jen N.,"Jersey City, NJ",84,16,28,4.0,7/9/2018,"Writing this for the spaghetti! Came here for a dinner reservation for 3 for my best friend's birthday on a Wednesday night. Ambiance: This is definitely a step above your average neighborhood cafe. Big windows, feels pretty open. Service: meh, kind of average. Our first waitress was really sweet and bubbly but our second didn't seem too thrilled to be working. Our check took awhile to get at the end. They also don't do much for birthdays as I was sad to find out despite my informing the hostess before we sat down. Perhaps this was our fault since we didn't order a dessert but I guess a heads up would have been nice. Drinks: don't remember what I got but it was ok Food: I would 100% come back for the spaghetti. Al dente, a touch of spice, subtle smokiness from the tomatoes, the right amount of pecorino, and some breadcrumbs for crunch. Perfect palace of everything. We each got the $55 tasting menu. The liver mousse was good but not the best. Grilled fish was tasty but I was so full by the end. Second fave of the table was probably the fried broccoli. Overall: I'd come back especially for the spaghetti. Seems like it'd be a nice, lower key place for brunch too.",,,
18,Mallory L.,"Oxnard, CA",130,495,1172,4.0,11/15/2017,"Great brunch place! I had the forager and it was delicious! But I wouldn't recommend the hash brown. It's literally a block of potato.

19,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",237,79,37,5.0,8/17/2018,"I am obsessed with one thing on their menu and could probably eat this for breakfast/brunch every day - their Forager sandwich with their house hot sauce is my favorite breakfast sandwich in the city. I've both gotten takeout and sat down in here for brunch multiple times, and that is the only thing I will get. I've tried their hot sauce on the Bodega sandwich too but the combo just wasn't as good, though I also like the Bodega sandwich on its own. It can take a while to wait for your food (especially when it's busy, though I've had that issue too even when it was pretty empty) and I've also had times where my sandwich was a little too burned, but still come back time and time again for the Forager.",1,1,1
20,Christina Z.,"New York, NY",947,368,367,1.0,4/15/2018,"My fiancé and I were excited to try this place after seeing the huge photos of the Bodega sandwich.Unfortunately we were highly disappointed in:1. The biscuits were overdone, dry, crunchy/hard and super salty/fell apart immediately and slightly burnt, making for a very messy meal.2. The size of our sandwich was 50% of what we saw on images...but also the ladies next to us who ordered the same thing got a larger slab of sausage 3x as much) as well as more eggs (maybe 2x+), whereas our sausage was hard to find without lifting the biscuit to look hard for it (it was about 0.3-0.5cm in width vs theirs were about an inch thick) - basically it looked like we received two large slices of burnt biscuit rather than a sandwich.3. On top of the fact that we basically just got salty hard bread, they've also since increased the price from $13 to $15 (vs what I've seen on Yelp) - yet decreased the quantity, and possibly quality as well.I also wanted to try the meyer lemon cream puffs but they were also not around.All in all, not a huge fan of the food. The venue is nice to hang out on a lazy Sunday, and the service is very quick. Most of the employees we interacted with were very nice as well.",2,2,2

""We don't have cash"" ""no substitutions"" ""we usually serve cappuccinos in a smaller cup so I will complain about giving you a drop more of milk"".   Sorry. The food is not that good when it's served with a dose of resentment.",,,
23,Shan H.,"Boston, MA",3,145,28,2.0,8/4/2018,"The whole experience was off. We were exploring all day so we came in around 3:30 for a late lunch. The place was not busy, but the service was fairly slow. We may have visited on an off day. Ultimately, I am frustrated with management. I've been in the industry for about 8 years, it is their job to have the proper menus and set the standard for their servers.After we sat, we were told there was a mid-day menu with about 7 items. I planned to order the Spicy Italian sandwich with a side salad, and my husband was planning on the turkey sandwich with a salad. When I ordered the waiter said ""oh we don't have the Italian sandwich, you have the wrong menu.""   We received two new menus and it has everything except the Italian sandwich. Therefore, my husband and I both ordered the turkey sandwich with side salads for $16. Our sandwiches come and it's only the sandwich. We expected the salad to come, but nothing showed up. I inquired with the waiter and he said, ""oh yeah, you noticed. Well the menu changed and we no longer serve the salads with the sandwiches."" The waiter said he'd ""see what I can do."" I was equally confused and annoyed. Nothing arrived.We asked for the check and we were given a dessert as a quote ""in place of the salad."" It was about the size of a golf ball and not that great.I could tell the waiter was overwhelmed and probably hands were tied due to all these changes and no course of action to fix the discrepancies with the menu. $67 for 2 sandwiches the size of a small fist, 1 cocktail, and 1 glass of wine. We don't plan to ever be back.",2,,

26,Dinisha G.,"Livingston, NJ",308,32,32,3.0,3/20/2018,"I came here on a Sunday evening to meet a few friends for dinner. Here's the low-down:The food (specifically for dinner) was a lot smaller portions (and fancier/healthier) than I expected. For appetizers, we ordered bread and butter and Carrots a la Mendez. The bread and butter was $5 for four slices of bread and some ""unique"" butter, which seems a bit hefty for something that is normally complimentary at restaurants. The Carrots a la Mendez was steamed carrots with some sort of sauce (basically tasted like rabbit food). Needless to say, my guy friends were still starving at this point, but it's great for those of you who love carrots and are health conscious. For dinner, I ordered the Gnocchi with scallops which was actually very delicious and seasoned well. The portion was small, but it was a perfect size for me. One of my friends ordered the Cauliflower steak which was basically a giant steamed broccoli (or cauliflower?) with what looked like cauliflower rice on the side. My friends were not impressed with the food here. Overall, I thought the food here is very unique and different, but not necessarily in a good way. I definitely do not recommend this place for dinner. It's brunch reviews look more promising though. And a tip: don't come in starving (or with guys who eat a lot)!",2,,

The breakfast menu is very limited without any entree-sized sweet options so it's not that kid-friendly.  My not at all picky child couldn't find anything that she wanted and had to ask about other options which were offered begrudgingly. And the chocolate croissant was served cold. My forager sandwich was good, but it was definitely just an egg sandwich with some veggies and nothing to rave about - and it was TINY for the price.

The selection was almost everything from the regular menu (which is nice considering that many places significantly limit their selections) but dishes were all disappointing.To start, they let you choose two appetizers. I had the best hummus and steak tartare. The hummus was surprisingly bland, accompanied by very thick, hearty bread that overwhelmed the hummus taste. The steak tartare was very salty to the point that I couldn't even finish the small portion. It was accompanied by overcooked, crisp and greasy potato skins.For the entree, I got the steak which was perfectly cooked but also overly salty. The cuts (four small pieces) were also particularly fatty. It came with a carrot and zucchini spaghetti type side that was surprisingly spicy. The dessert was a chocolate moose that tasted like someone in a JELLO plastic cup. It also came in one of those cups. I had two forkfuls and stopped.The tables are all very close together. There is very limited room to squeeze in and out if you need to go to the bathroom. We were so close to the couple next to us that they jumped into our conversation twice. Overhearing each other is unavoidable.I was drinking a lot of water and had to wait a good 10 minutes in between refills.Overall, the service and food are not recommended. The location is in the heart of the meatpacking district and walking distance to the highline. It's great. But, there's many other options in the area especially at this price point (with the restaurant week discount, without alcohol, we paid $58 each with tax and tip).",2,,

The half dozen oysters weren't cold enough and already had a sour tasting vinegar sauce applied to each oyster. I've had Oysters at literally hundreds of places, and no restaurant has ever applied a topping on them prior to serving them. The skate with tiny clams ($28) was delicious but the Torchetti Pasta with duck ragu ($23) was overpriced and was a small portion. I've never understood why a Chef can't cook a 1/3 to a half pound of dry pasta and give a guest a decent portion.

I like the avocado tartine, and actually found it to be quite filling. It comes on a large piece of sour dough multigrain toast with mashed avocado, and two whole poached eggs (cut in half). My only complaint was that the toast was a little ... too charred (burnt). The ginger yogurt was delicious, but I felt like it could have used more berries and nuts. It wasn't very large for a ""large"". The old bay potatoes stole the show.. incredibly delicious. You'll want these as a side! A cute place but be ready to wait for weekend brunch. I think the line moves rather quickly though because there is quite a lot of seating at the restaurant and the food comes out pretty quick.",2,2,1
41,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,4/9/2017,"I've lost count of the number of Restaurant Weeks I've participated in over the years, but as each iteration goes by, there are fewer and fewer places that are able to pique my interest. This past season, however, High Street on Hudson joined the list of restaurants, and after skimming through their menu, rounded up my group of friends for our traditional Restaurant Week meal. As a Philly native, I'm certainly biased to begin with, but the restaurant has its roots in Philadelphia (known as High Street on Market) and after several successful years, opened up its first NYC location early in 2016. It has a prime location juxtaposed between the West Village and Meatpacking neighborhoods, and while breakfast and brunch are their signature meals, offer a regular dinner service as well.Despite the fact that there was a snowstorm the day of our reservation, the streets had been cleared up enough by nightfall that the three of us were still able to make it for dinner. The 60-seat interior isn't the most spacious, but has a takeout counter at the front as well as a number of table and booth seats. We were promptly shown to our table and given menus, although we'd all looked through them beforehand; orders were quickly placed and our appetizers were soon brought out.First, the Beet Cured Salmon Toast, which featured several thin slices of magenta-colored salmon on top of crisp toast and a horseradish cream cheese. There wasn't as much beet flavor as I was expecting, but I appreciated the slight zing of the horseradish against the cauliflower florets, and the slightly Nordic nod that the dish was taking. As for the Dry Aged Beef Tartare, the overall execution and flavor of the beef was well done, especially when paired with a creamy bearnaise aioli and a tangy gherkin vinaigrette, but the crispy potato skin it was served with wasn't a good alternative for simple toast; it wasn't strong enough to hold up the tartare, and seemed too oily.For the main dish, I had gone with the Artic Char after it had gotten a strong recommendation from our server. The dish was beautifully presented, with two filets that had been expertly cooked and retained a crisp skin after searing. It was plated over a bed of cauliflower, golden raisins, and pine nuts, and the mild sweet-savory flavors were the ideal complements to the fish. I tried my friend's Malfadine Pasta, which had an unconventional duck ragu sauce, and was pleasantly surprised at the robustness and richness of the sauce.For dessert, the Gingerbread Rum Mousse was quite the elegant finish. Presented in a glass cup, it had a deliciously light yet decadent gingerbread and rum-flavored mousse which was finished off with a layer of caramel, crumbled ginger cookies, and rum-infused currants. For those who like their desserts a little more unconventional, I have to give a nod to the Chocolate Balsamic, which paired a chocolate cake with a balsamic mousse, whipped cloumage, and sugared beet chips.When it comes to Restaurant Week, places either succeed or fail, and in the case of High Street on Hudson, they clearly achieved the former. I'd happily return for the weekend brunch (because, let's be honest, a weekday breakfast is a luxury few of us are able to have) to see what other options they have in store.",7,6,9
42,Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,441,166,4.0,5/8/2017,"High Street on Hudson is great for brunch and a pretty large space considering its location in West Village / Meatpacking. Consequently, it is a good place for a larger group.The staff is very nice and accommodating. No complaints about the service.The avocado egg tartine is really good. It's a bit small though. The bread is fresh and the avocado smash is seasoned well. The bodega breakfast sandwich is delicious. The pepper biscuit is buttery and soft. The sausage is flavoured well with a hint of sweetness from the maple syrup. The complimentary fried breakfast potatoes were a bit too salty, but they were crispy and a nice addition to the meal.I'll definitely return here for lunch/dinner.",1,1,1
43,Will H.,"Jersey City, NJ",63,10,1,4.0,12/7/2017,My girlfriend an I came here for her Birthday lunch and the food was amazing. We had the tartine with broccoli cheddar soup and the Roast Pork sandwich with spicy broccoli rabe. Our favorite items were their interesting play on classic broccoli cheddar soup (which sounds like a basic item) but was make with sharp cheddar and had deep broccoli flavor. The anandama bread on the tartine was also incredible and I'd come back just to eat this bread.The service was not great (possibly because we came for a Wednesday lunch) which is only reason I didn't give 5 stars. We will definitely be back for the full brunch menu or dinner!,1,,

It's overly salty/sour cheese and the bread was really soggy from too much grease on the griddle. My husband had the tartine, which was super bland and over seasoned with dill. But, the eggs were cooked well (little runny). Service was good.Ice tea tastes like Lipton and cost $4 for a highball.",,,

46,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,461,562,4.0,4/9/2017,"Two things to order when you're here - really, you don't even have to look at the menu. Sit down and immediately place and order of the bodega and a side of old bay potatoes. You'll thank me when they arrive. The bodega - a sausage, egg, and cheese held together by a large peppery biscuit. It sounds basic, but trust me, once you bite into the biscuit, you'll question everyone else's biscuit game. Not only is it flaky and crumbly, the pepper aspect elevates these carbs. Add in cheese that's melted INTO the eggs and not on top and there's your bodega masterpiece. The eggs were perfectly cooked as well - like slightly watery scrambled eggs. Personally, as a non sausage lover, I could have lived without the sausage as it reminded me and tasted like your usual frozen Jimmy Dean sausage patties. The old bay potatoes - these actually came after our sandwiches, but no complaints because they were piping hot. They reminded hot throughout our entire meal and were fried nicely. I loved the old bay seasoning and the fact that you get a pretty large portion for $5. We all need some type of potato when we eat sandwiches right? My only compliant was that the sauce for the potatoes were all on the bottom, so you have to dig to dip your potatoes / the potatoes on the bottom had too much sauce - would have been better to have the sauce on the side. Nonetheless, the garlic aioli sauce was good though. We also had the forager, which was an egg, mushroom, cheese, and kale sandwich. Maybe I made the mistake (or was it) of eating the bodega first and being blown away by it, but the forager didn't impress me as much as it impressed the other diners. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was good, but when you compare it to the bodega, the bodega is 100x better in terms of flavor and texture. The forager mainly consisted of just bread - it could have used more eggs and mushrooms. The struggle for the bodega was so real that I had to switch my half of the forager back for the bodega LOL. Cute spot for breakfast / brunch. Also, it seems like a lot of locals come here to buy bread / pastries / coffee, which I definitely would do as well if I lived in the area. If you're a huge bread lover like me, perhaps ask for a table in the back so you can watch bread be freshly baked. I luckily had a table by the oven and loved that component.",2,1,1

50,Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",290,997,706,5.0,3/18/2017,"One of my favorite brunch spots in NYC! They take reservations online but we decided to go last minute. I went with a group of 3 and we only waited like 15min for brunch around 1:30pm. I think this place is a spin-off of high street on market in philly- I've been to this location and I loved the brunch menu there as well. I couldn't decide what I wanted because I love avocado toast (the tartine) but it's what I always get so I decided to get something different. I got a breakfast sandwich, the forager, - mushroom , egg, kale, swiss, mayo= YUM! We also got a side of bacon and I tried my friend's side of potatoes. The bacon was delicious- it wasn't like hard burnt but it was soft yet still cooked well. The potatoes had some mayo at the bottom-dip it in there! I like the presentation of the food as well. Service was wonderful! The meat plate dish looked really good too- I kept looking at the food on other people's tables...I like the layout of this place- great brunch spot!",2,1,1

Its a cute, little restaurant in the west village serving contemporary, American cuisine. The menu is seasonal (which I love) so i'll have to go back to see how it changes. The interior is sleek and modern and the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. There's an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant where you can see the chefs work their magic. It was relatively empty on the night that I went which is surprising because of how great this place is. High Street serves creative craft cocktails and has an extensive wine list. We didn't get any appetizers but i ordered the Chicken in the Woods entree. It's half a chicken with mushrooms, tuscan kale and a jus that you get to pour all over the top. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms with kale were delicious. Its the all around perfect dish and the jus sets it over the top. For dessert, we ordered a honey custard that's topped with honeycomb candy, ricotta mousse and cranberries. This dessert sounds simple but it has some incredible flavor. It was sweet but not too sweet, and had so many great textures throughout. Every item was beautifully plated and you can tell that everyone at High Street wants you to have an exceptional experience.",,,

Coffee bar right as you enter in case that's all you are need! Food: The Bodega: Breakfast biscuit with egg, sausage and and cheddar. 4.8/5, really good.Pastrami & Hash: it's a sandwich and for some reason was expecting a skillet of food, either way, was not disappointed. Super flavorful and the hash browns were mashed into giant squares, deep fried and over the Fing top good. Avocado Toast: they've got excellent bread so the toast was great, it was more like guacamole toast that might've been pre-made, eggs on top. 3.5/5 Bloody Mary's can be lived without. Lacked real flavor. Overall, a great brunch spot.",,,

I had every intention of trying their pastries,  but unfortunately I had no room.   I ordered a Bodega,  it's not a big dish.  Does not come with a side,  but it's very rich an filling.  Since they bake their pasteries I'll assume the muffin my bodega was served on was freshly made. Inside is a sausage patty,  egg,  cheese,  and full of fillings. Very happy with my experience especially for a first time visit.",3,,3
58,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",874,1242,25,4.0,8/6/2017,"I'm a fan but be warned there's constructive criticism here.  Lovely choice for restaurant week. Granted, it isn't a super high-end place in which you might feel shouldn't take up a RW free space for you, but thought it was worth mine & hubby's while as they have an interesting selection that actually tries hard, along more variety to choose from which is a plus.  For summer RW, it was also relatively easy to make a ressie (and modify) which was refreshingly a plus right on OPT. We sat on a Sunday at 730 - the restaurant interior is spacious and lovely but even better was their al fresco dining right out front. We sat outside and were waited on prompt. The server did a good job making recommendations, answering questions about dishes.   For RW, they allow you to choose 2 starters and/or snacks, an entree, a dessert.  They said that each portion is scaled back for RW (and things like the chicken they had, are in essence, a worse cut etc). I had: - The beet cured salmon toast- beautiful, interesting, high quality, interesting flavor but just not my kind a guess; very pickled, very strong licorice. Not salty enough. Great toast though. - The oysters - 3 east coast selection which was kind of muted with a very mellow cucumber vinaigrette, this is where I would have preferred a meatier version and stronger flavors. Got a lot of Nordic/Eastern European vibes here in terms of flavor-The buckwheat gnocci - indeed it's a specialty with a yummy dill beurre blanc, caviar, dill. Not as sticky as in traditional potato gnocchi but still very delicate in their own kind of flour. So gladI got it as it wasn't heavy at all. The sauce was excellent for sopping up two pieces of artisanal, house baked bread (Italian white loaf). The bad?  There was zero portion size. Granted, they said the portions were scaled back but they were not kidding. Think I had less than 10 pieces of gnocchi, which honestly was not a lot to make someone full. The good thing is that I wasn't ravenous so I was doing ok.. -The sesame and black cherry cake  - not too sweet, subtle refined. Definitely black cherry and sesame flavor, esp the ice cream. The cake was spongy and delightful. - A glass of delicious full bodied Napa Valley RoseHubby had: - Crispy broccoli - delicious snack!  Just crispy broccoli in tempura with spiced onion mix. - The beef tartare. Not into (in general) but came in yummy thick potato skins. My hubby liked it. -Delicious corn beef-y almost brisket style beef (like roast beef), with a borscht type salad. Very delicious and flavorful. -The pineapple chocolate mousse trifle for dessert. Did not like this as much I'd though - great cream, chocolate mousse, and eh on the pineapple. They were prepared a bit too sweetly. -Some kind of IPA All in all, for us both - drinks, RW, tax/tip, it was $150 or so. I'd come back again for breads, brekafst or lunch which is where they seem to have all the money.",5,1,4
59,Valerie S.,"Staten Island, NY",134,6,6,2.0,4/20/2018,"Didn't really enjoy our dinner. I ordered fish&chips which they serve as raw fluke and 5 little chips. It may have been my fault not looking under the name of the item but I just assumed it's the traditional fish&chips. I feel like this is something a waiter would address to the guest just to be sure. Their tomato pasta is 23$ which is just cherry tomatoes, spaghetti and pecorino. The portion was tiny and the pasta was not cooked. Dessert was better, we had carrot cake. Service was slow and cold.

Didn't enjoy that we were seated right at the very front of the restaurant where it was cold when the door kept opening and was right in the commotion of everyone coming in. We asked to be seated further back but were told they were all reserved for other parties. We were also seated very closely next to another two-topper and could hear a lot of their conversation, which was pretty distracting/annoying...  Besides that the waiter was nice and helpful.  But moving on to food. Not all people in the party have to participate in the Restaurant Week menu, so I did and my sister did not. I like how the menu let you choose two appetizers for more variety. I got the beef tartare and smoked salmon. I liked the beef tartare better. Both came with two portions for me and my sister to try. My sister ordered the burrata, scrambled egg, and caviar appetizer and it was AMAZING. So so yummy I forgot to take a picture before we ate it all. For my entree, I got the malfadine pasta that was also FANTASTIC. My sister squid ink seafood pasta that was also good but definitely not as good as the malfadine. For my dessert, I chose the spiced rum mousse, which was good but nothing that special.  Overall, food was very good, and the restaurant is cute, in a fun area of town.

The forager: Fantastic. This vegetarian baby came stuffed with a perfect farm egg, succulent sauteed mushrooms, braised kale, melted Swiss cheese and black trumpet mayo (mayo simply made with black trumpet mushrooms, shallots, and rosemary) between two pieces of buttery poppy seed bread. FYI: The recipe is on Epicurious: epicurious.com/recipes/f…House-made ginger yogurt: This was my least favorite items that I ordered. The jome-made Greek yogurt had a slightly grainy texture that was thinner than what I prefer--a creamier, richer, and denser variety. It came topped with cardamom honey (lovely), pistachios, and sliced fresh apples. Almond and molasses cake: Rich, moist, dense, slightly gooey with two pieces of candied ginger and crushed nuts. Amazingly, this wasn't too sweet, though the flavors of almond and molasses were quite subtle.",1,1,1

Shareable plates guarantee an intimate experience, and the RW menu is particularly fun because the first course consists of two small plates per person and everyone still gets to choose their own main. I got to try the pumpkin hummus, crispy broccoli, winter salad and vegetarian beet steak. The treatments of vegetables in these dishes could not have been more different but all of them were so damn delicious. The winter salad especially consisted of a mountain of seasonal greens topped with yogurt that far superseded an innocent plate of leaves as suggested by the name. I was going on a rant about how good the salad was until I was interrupted - and floored - by the smokey, earthy, firm yet tender beet ""steak,"" as if beets were not the most overrated vegetable of 2016.

I've been to Fork for dinner and High Street on Market for a pastry, both in Philly, and was excited to try this new location! We started with the coffee date cake - split opinions on this among the table, where I thought it was pretty good, and even great as a shared starter, but this ended up being the most tepid take. Get a pastry to start! They bake their bread and pastries in-house and have really interesting flavors (chocolate chai Sammy?). Our waiter also recommended the almond chocolate croissant, though he said this was pretty heavy, so if you're a croissant person, definitely try. I got the Forager sandwich, which is their vegetarian option with oyster mushroom, house-baked kaiser, kale, mustard / aioli. The sandwich was amazing - the mushrooms were the perfect thickness and were cooked perfectly, super flavorful. The pairing with kale worked really well for the texture, and the eggs were soft scrambled without being too soft, the way I really like them. The roll was super fluffy, not too buttery, and absorbed the sauce and egg flavors well. As a heads up, the sandwiches generally look pretty small in size at first (though the pastrami hash is especially hefty - definitely needs some fork and knife intervention), but they're really filling. On a separate note, Bon Appetit has the recipe for the Forager sandwich through a collaboration with the chef, which was fun to read! Overall, loved High Street and would definitely come back.

Updated review","Unfortunately, this restaurant has progressively gone downhill and tonight was the last straw.  Nice server, but it took 45 minutes to get salad.   No explanation, nothing.  After another 45 minutes , three different people (the expediter, the server, and the manager) tell us our food is coming ""soon,"" with no explanation of what ""soon"" means.  And no food.  While we watched 5 parties come in after us and get served, we left.  Told the manager , he just cowered,  didn't say a word.   We were regulars, and indeed, a message from the owner referred to us as VIPs.   Yet, she absolutely refused to take responsibility for it.  She says it's the result of neighborhood pressure to have restaurant chains replace local businesses.  Frankly, if it takes you 90 minutes to NOT serve customers,  you DESERVE to be out of business.    There are too many restaurants in nyc to put up with this.  And not all of them are chains",1,1,
74,Nimra N.,"Austin, TX",11,55,32,4.0,12/15/2017,This place is nice inside. Service was good and the food was tasty. But I have to give this place a four star because honestly I had higher expectations and that's from  all the amazing pictures and reviews on yelp BUT all those pictures are from breakfast and lunch because dinner basically doesn't really have options. It's disappointing because the menu is not well thought out. The plates are small and way too overpriced for the serving. Still I'm going to come back for brunch !,1,1,2

I'd already looked at the menu online so I knew what to order: the best grilled cheese ever. It was not what I was expecting: living up to its name! The bread was thick and grilled throughout, cheese was nice and melted, and came with bacon and tomato. It was served on a very cute wooden spatula. It was warm out of the oven, but not tongue-scorching hot. I had a Diet Coke, which was served out of a glass bottle and a cup of ice. Water is compulsory from your own jar and glass. Bathroom was nice and cleanService was very attentive and friendly. I felt really welcomed here. This restaurant has a very friendly and relaxing atmosphere.

Both sandwiches were very good, especially the bodega, and the bread mostly lived up to the hype.On the service -- I usually don't care if it's slow, unless it actually affects the quality of the meal. In this case, we didn't get the bread until after we were done with the sandwiches, which obviously isn't ideal, and was partially due to our server not checking on us.

The way that the biscuit and the eggs and meat all come together was excellent. I also enjoyed the green pepper sauce that it was served with. The asparagus was also very good. I don't know what they did with it exactly, but they imparted some additional flavor to it as well. I would have preferred it a little more crispy, but it was very good nonetheless.Overall, this place serves up some excellent food and has a great outdoor area for people watching and enjoying the nice weather.

Updated review","I am happy that I chose to come back to High Street for dinner. The atmosphere was nice and the servers and manager were attentive. They were accommodating with the menu and dietary adjustments and I enjoyed each of my three courses. 1) Crispy Broccoli: what an ingenious texture. Crispy and crunchy on the outside while maintaining the integrity of the whole broccoli, not overly fried like a tempura. The pickled vegetables provided a strong taste that I could do without, but was easy to set aside. 2) House made pasta: there is nothing better than fresh pasta. The tomatoes and sauce were impeccable and the hints of crunchy breadcrumbs mixed in provided a unique and welcome twist. 3) Cauliflower steak: wonderful mix of flavors. I looked down and ate this as if I were transported to a deliciously natural food eating contest (not cute on my part). High likelihood that I will return. Thanks High Street!",,,

97,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,2/14/2017,"High Street on Hudson had been earning rave reviews since the famed Philadelphia spot opened its Manhattan outpost.  Most of the buzz surrounded its home-style brunch, for which it was often hard to score a table.  So, I was thrilled that we were able to secure a reservation for their prix fixe dinner during Winter Restaurant Week.  Unlike other participants, High Street promoted the sharing of the first courses by creating family-style small plates and granting two selections per person.  The Beet-Cured Salmon balanced flavors of the earth and the sea. The fresh fish was served on thick slices of grained country bread that had first been covered with a horseradish cream cheese and a few small heads of cauliflower.  The Kabocha Squash Hummus was a bit of a disappointment in that it was too smooth and more of a puree than a thick hummus.  It was topped with charred shishito pepper shavings and a drizzle of black sesame oil.  One thick slice of house made, toasted volkornbrot bread had been cut into four pieces to use as a vehicle for the dip.  The bread was coarse and hearty, but the humus was a bit bland.  A salad of Winter Greens was plated with a ""ginger"" yogurt and walnuts, all topped with a smoked apple vinaigrette.  The salad was absolutely delicious, with a real seasonal warmth.  However, I put ""ginger"" in quotes, because the spice was hard to detect.  Lastly, the Dry-Aged Beef Tartare was slathered in a béarnaise aioli and served on crispy potato skins.  The presentation appeared sloppy, mushy, and greasy, but the flavor was unreal!  The appetizer we were initially the least excited about was really the star.  The potato tasted like an oniony pancake with a soft interior, which added even more flavor to the fresh meat.  Each bite was pure heaven!When it came to the entrees and desserts, we each got to choose our own.  My Arctic Char was cooked to picture perfection.  Two decent-sized filets were laying on top of sliced sunchokes and bok choy - a blend of Eastern and Western cultures.  A miso glaze added extra depth.   For my sweet course, I opted for the Chocolate Balsamic.  The rich chocolate cake was topped with a dabs of whipped cloumage cheese and balsamic mousse.  Crushed, sugared beet chips were sprinkled over the top and added texture to each forkful.  While the cake could have been more chocolatey, the creamy mousses made up for any lack of decadence.  The balsamic and beets countered the sweetness.Overall, High Street on Hudson delivered a flavorful New American meal in a casual, yet upscale atmosphere.   While dinner was great, I definitely would like to return for brunch.",10,4,6

Updated review","Came back to High Street on Hudson to give it another shot. The service was MUCH better this time. Our server was extremely attentive, and this time, we were in and out in a respectable hour and a half. And no one dared touch my plate until I was clearly finished :).As much as I'm not 100% on board with the ""pay for bread"" concept, we got the Bread & Butter anyway, and we were very happy we did. As mentioned, High Street on Hudson is known for their baked goods and breads, and the salted butter accompanying the fluffy slices was to die for. We next got the Kabocha Pumpkin Hummus, and it was as creamy and delicious as we remembered it. Next came the Beet Cured Salmon on Toast. The salmon + beet  + horseradish cream cheese combo was interesting (in a good way) and again, you can't beat the bread at High Street. However, I felt the cauliflower may not have been necessary. The texture was a bit off for me, and I don't think it added much to the dish. Remembering the gnocchi from last time, we got a small portion of the new Buckwheat Gnocchi. Alas, High Street, why did you change the gnocchi from before?!  I think it may be a seasonal issue, but the sweet potato gnocchi with the crispy potato skins in the fall was a superb dish. Now, the gnocchi itself was cooked perfectly, soft and billowy, as it should be. The dish was also very aesthetically pleasing (see pics below). However, the vodka beurre was a little too creamy, and the dish felt a little one note. The crispy buckwheat did add some interesting texture, but I'm not sure it did much to change the flavor profile. I would recommend adding a little heat or another type of herb to counter the richness of the dish. We opted for Beef Short Rib for our entrée. Unfortunately, we were expecting short rib in the traditional sense -- fall off the bone meat that melts in your mouth. However, this dish came with about 5 or 6 pieces of thinly sliced steak and a bone that didn't really add much else; I definitely didn't think the $32 price tag was warranted. The watermelon radishes, cabbage, and celery root accompaniment was quite refreshing, though. I think if this was perhaps called something else (""short rib"" brings the aforementioned connotation to mind) and the price was knocked down a few dollars, I think this would be a good dish. As is, though, it was not my favorite part of the meal, and wouldn't recommend it for the future. We ended with the chocolate cake, which we wolfed down in about 30 seconds flat. The whipped cloumage made this dish taste like a chocolate cheesecake, pretty much my favorite dish in the world. The candied beet chips gave this dish a delicious crunch. YOU MUST GET THIS CAKE IF YOU GO!Overall, we did have a nice meal, and the service made up for a few menu missteps. I probably won't go back for dinner (unless they bring back the sweet potato gnocchi next fall), but I definitely do want to try High Street for brunch, and would recommend anything carb based that comes out of the kitchen.",1,,1

THE BODEGA ($13) was one of the best Sausage Egg-Chedder Biscuits. It's greasy as McDonald's Sausage Biscuit with Egg and was equally delicious. DUCK MEATBALL SUB ($16) was good too. The meatballs were surprisingly soft and juicy. But lacking in duck flavor was a bit of disappointment. House sparkling water in a cute glass bottle that had good punch of bobbles as Gerolsteiner was fun.It's still new but for busy weekend, having just one person at the front to take care of all the anxious customers seemed to be daunting.",11,7,9

But then I had the pastrami and hash breakfast sandwich and it has restored my hope in the NYC brunch game.  I'm being a little melodramatic, but this sandwich was really inspiring and messy and delicious. Layers of textures and flavors and an array of sauces and pickles to jazz it up to your liking, all sandwiched between a very pretty poppyseed bun. Served on a cutting board- there isn't anything else you need besides coffee to wash it down. The meatpacker is also a tasty well-rounded plate of food. I found the coppa salty, but that's easily fixed. Take a bit of that with the eggs and broccoli rabe for an excellent bite. The potatoes steal the show, almost halfhazardly broken up with rough edges that increase the surface area = crispy and crunchy all around. Highly recommend arriving early. I waited 30 min at noon on a Saturday. The wait had gone up to an hour around 1pm. The prices are affordable, the brunch ambiance is great, and the service was super friendly.",3,2,2

I walked up to the counter, the ginger scone looked okay and the muffin was tempting but the goddess of prompt dessert abandoned us.     I think the wait staff gets saddled with too much delivery and too little waiting.  Poor things were running back and forth between the kitchen trying to keep the hot things hot.  No wait staff around so I dumped cash on the check so I didn't have to wait for the pick up.  When I do that, that is my signal that things are bit slow.",,,

The Whitefish Bialy ($7.50) is a startlingly black (squid ink) disc topped with whitefish and pickled peppers - definitely a fork and knife deal, and less of a sandwich. The slightly crispy bialy is delicious and goes well with the salty whitefish. Also, The Bodega ($13) is an incredible, rich take on a sausage, egg and cheese. For the bread, an amazing Sage-Black Pepper Biscuit is used, adding even more butteriness to the equation, which is definitely not needed, but still very welcome. These few options make me want to stop off frequently before work, since they are gone at lunchtime (except on the weekends, when they are served along with the brunch menu).On the way out, I picked up some of the pastries (I passed on the Red Eye Danish, but only because I've tried it in Philly, and it is a great choice if you only get one thing). I also tried an Everything Bagel ($2.50), which is not at all like a classic NY bagel, in that it is very small and quite crunchy, but it is really delicious.I will be back very soon for the excellent sandwiches at lunch, such as the Duck Meatball Sub and the Grilled Cheese.",20,7,15

This was delicious. It came with a yogurt sauce, green apples, walnuts and an apple vinaigrette.  There were also radishes and brussel sprouts sprinkled in which were cooked very well.  This was a fairly small portion.Burrata. It had a cottage cheese consistency, but was amazing. Came with heirloom tomatoes, ndjua oil, and rye crouton, the crouton was very well done.  Again, the portion size was quite small, however.Crispy broccoli. This was not my favorite but offered us a side to go with our duck.  It came with chow chow and scallion and had a bit of a kick to it.  The tempura flavor was kind of bland.Duck. Was cooked very well, but was a little on the fatty side - not to the point where i couldn't eat the skin but borderline.  Though, the skin was delicious and very well seasoned.  They only give you 4 slices of duck breast, so small portions seem to be a theme.  It is served over a bed of grains, tasted like farro.Ended up being $50 each, which seems pretty reasonable for 4 items + 2 glasses of wine total, though as noted the portions were on the smaller side.I will definitely be back to try their brunch.",2,,

I got the melted chocolate with Japanese cheesecake. The decor was trendy. Open kitchen and huge windows. The noise level is loud. I had a hard time hearing my friends.

Noteworthy mention: I wasn't a big fan of my cocktail and asked for a wine instead. In the end, our waiter comped the wine which was most appreciated and a nice surprise.

The plates are pretty small so you can try a bunch of stuff. We got the chicken, swordfish, and cauliflower steak and a few pastas to start. Well balanced meal. Ultimately, nothing was that memorable, but we enjoyed ourselves. Not sure I'd come back. Would highly recommend their breads and pastries though.

136,Alexandra R.,"New York, NY",43,65,116,5.0,11/19/2016,"Nothing is better then when you receive a five star meal experience... especially when someone surprises you with it. My boyfriend took me here for a Saturday brunch and wouldn't tell me where we were going. Props to him because this place was amazing! We had to wait about 10 min for a table at around 11:30. The place isn't large and doesn't take reservations for brunch so you may have to wait a little bit. I would say at about 12 the place really had a wait going. Make sure you try the pasties they are phenomenal. You HAVE to try the squash doughnuts... I know sounds a little strange but boy were these things tasty. For my main breakfast item I had the Bodega, which was basically a fancy sausage egg and cheese. It definitely had some spice to it and you could tell the the biscuit was homemade and fresh. When it comes out it doesn't look huge but it is filling and exploding with flavor. My boyfriend got the pastrami and hash. Let me tell you I have never and still do not like pastrami... but one bite of this and I may be a new pastrami fan (but only for this sandwich). If you like this type of breakfast sandwich or even if you don't but want to try something new, get this. Overall, a great experience with great food, although they really pack you in the space, so many restaurants in NYC do. Good service, cute atmosphere and great food!",2,1,1

Farms to table like dishes where it is very apparent that they care a lot about their ingredients. Review for their dinner/restaurant portion: MUST TRY:BUCKWHEAT GNOCCHI $15/25 - Gnocchi had an amazing homemade texture. The sauce was a rich and savory warm melted butter with dill and small dollops of cool yogurt and caviar! BURRATA with scrambled egg & trout caviar $16 - The scrambled egg surprisingly was the best part! very fluffy and compliments the other ingredients well. the main burrata was a little tough but still enjoyable.STRIPED BASS $30 - the highlight of the night! Even those who don't usually order fish loved this dish. The meat was cooked so perfectly juicy and the skin so crisp and delicious! Also came with bok choy, mushrooms and sunchoke. the sauce was very light (soy sauce like?) and wasn't too over powering. overall an elegantly flavored dish. DUCK BREAST $28 - a beautiful dish with medium rare duck and gorgeous pink/white slices of beats and radish. the vegetables in this dish was very flavorful!Other dishes:CRISPY BROCCOLI $12 - Battered broccoli gave it a nice texture but the sauce was a little too sour and vinegary for my liking. BREAD WITH SPREADS $8 - The bread was great for dipping the gnocchi sauce but the spreads (apricot, maple butter, eggplant tapenade) were  just alright, especially the eggplant. I would skip.Per our waiters suggestion we split all the above between 3 people and it was just the right amount! I am definitely glad we had it family style so we got to try more dishes. Great service throughout the night with a very nice and friendly waiter and other waiters helping out to bring out and take away the food. I appreciate the speediness but almost too fast in some cases where a different waiter came by and scooped up our dish that we weren't finished with! Would have been nice if they asked us if we were done before they took our dish away :(",,,

I came here because their pastries were featured on NY.Eater and I'm a huge pastry fiend, and they did not disappoint. Their signature almond croissant is great, and they have great coffee as well (I can't remember but its from a NY coffee producer). They have a signature coffee drink with earl grey in it, and I wish I got it. For a light lunch I ordered the mushroom melt; seared king oyster mushroom, braised kale, green meadow young swiss, black trumpet mayo, and thin slices of apple. The other sandwich options sounded phenomenal, but I wanted something lighter to start my day especially with the pastries. Great sandwich that was flavorful with meatiness from the mushrooms and an overall balanced flavor with the kale and apple, although I didn't really get much of the black trumpet mayo. Perhaps it's more for the umami boost on your palate than something you distinctly taste.

It's been awhile since I've met a breakfast sandwich I liked this much, and I think these breakfast sandwiches and I are going to friends for a long time.The sandwiches come on a variety of house-made bread. I had the forager and my boyfriend had the bodega. We loved the combination of ingredients on both of our sandwiches. On my forager, the mushroom was cooked perfectly, the trumpet mayo added a nice depth of flavor, good cheese and scrambled eggs. The only downside is that the sandwich is greasy and runny (you could see grease drip onto my cutting-board esque plate - which by the way is cute, but not convenient for eating messy foods). My boyfriend raved about the bodega also. The breakfast sausage had amazing flavor, cheddar is a classic on a breakfast sandwich, and it came on this perfect buttery biscuit. I have to admit I stole many bites of his biscuit.They also make a bunch of pastries. We tried this blackberry lavender cake thingy (it was recommended by the waitress) and loved it. I've also had a delicious pound cake here. I was not as impressed by the donuts - would skip these in favor of cakes. One downside I will point out is the slow service.

156,Lauren D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,4/16/2018,"Been meaning to come here for a while and finally decided to drop in for brunch this past Saturday.  The wait to dine outside was 2+ hours so we opted for indoors and were promptly seated.  The inside is very bright & airy so we didn't feel like we were missing out on the beautiful weather by sitting inside.  My boyfriend got a bloody mary and the bodega sandwich, I opted for the ginger yogurt and our server offered me a a half-size portion of the malted granola (since I wanted both!), and we split an order of the old bay potatoes.  I had a bite of my boyfriend's sandwich and it was amazing...I almost had FOMO about not ordering the same thing, but then I tried my dish.  My yogurt & granola were soooo fresh and flavorful, way better/different  than the yogurt & granola option you get elsewhere...I couldn't get enough!!  And the potatoes were awesome (just the right amount of old bay) & served with a creamy dipping sauce...I'm not quite sure what it was but it was BOMB.  Neither of us could stop remarking on how great everything actually was...we figured we were in for a decent meal, but it ended up being significantly better than we expected.  We'll 100% be back.",1,,

Eventually he agreed to make me a replacement drink (after which he did admit that there was a bug in the first drink). Pretty gross... and disappointing, since they still charged me for the drink (which I would've happily done without after getting the first one with the bug, but it became awkward when the waiter insisted there was no bug...)The food itself was fine - I got a pasta dish that I can't really remember much about one way or another... probably because the only thing I can really remember is the drink fiasco.Pretty disappointing, considering I'd heard good things about High Street on Hudson and had been looking forward to trying it.",,,

160,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,4/5/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10There are not many all-day restaurants in New York City; it takes certain amount of courage and dedication to operate a place in this hectic, high-rent city. Yes, there have been some restaurants notable for offering some amazing breakfast and/or lunch options, but mostly the focus of most restaurants in Big Apple still lies in dinner. Chef Eli Kulp and his business partner Ellen Yin came all the way from Philadelphia to change that with a New York outpost of their highly acclaimed High Street restaurant. In the morning, the restaurant is a bakery serving pastries; at lunch, it serves a variety of sandwich options; for dinner, it becomes a full-fledged restaurant incorporating many of the breads baked in the morning. That kind of versatility is a scarce asset in New York dining scene, and I was certainly intrigued to see what kind of food the kitchen was delivering. Overall, I had a very pleasant dining experience on my recent weekend dinner. There is nothing fancy about the food at High Street, but you can tell that a lot of thoughts and preparations have been devoted to it. There are a handful of toast menus, and I enjoyed the one with smoked eel, spicy radish and parsley that had a lot of delightfulness to each bite. Among a small list of pasta dishes, don't skip seaweed bucatini that comes with nduja, mussels, bread crumb and lobster bottarga. It was a wonderful (and beautifully plated) pasta dish that has great balance of flavor; I initially wished the noodle were a little bit more firm, but over time, the softer texture of noodle started to gel really well with the other elements of the dish. For the entrees, I felt the Long Island duck was a bit more successful than grilled arctic char. Arctic char, which came with crispy potato, mustard greens, pickled gribiche and black olive, came away a little too aggressive in seasoning, although the fish itself was very nicely cooked. On the other hand, duck was cooked to near perfection for absolutely juicy, tender texture, and worked harmoniously with soured oats and grains, charred leek and turnip that accompanied it. For dessert, we had roasted milk chocolate with Japanese cheesecake, preserved lemon and cocoa bean, a solid but not particularly memorable dish.The restaurant has a somewhat concise menu of wine (many of them from the nearby New York area) and beer and I wish they could've really ramped up their wine selection to make the dinner even more memorable. Getting a reservation wasn't particularly challenging, but the restaurant has been getting a lot of buzz lately and the dining space is not particularly large, so make sure to book in advance if possible. I really liked the inviting vibe of the dining space that makes it well-suited for the type of all-day neighborhood restaurant that it strives to be. Well, there is at least one Philly import that has made a successful move to New York; I'm curious to see if other Philly restaurateurs and chefs will follow the path of chef Kulp. Certainly, High Street on Hudson is the type of restaurant that is so reliable as to make it a place that you would want to visit again.",5,,
161,Chenxi L.,"Manhattan, NY",541,14,41,3.0,4/21/2016,"3.5 rounding down to a 3. Yes, High Street is better known for brunch / lunch and its breads and sandwiches, but it is not memorable as a dinner joint, especially considering its price point.The decor is extremely dim - to the point where I struggled to see what my food looked like, so definitely a good spot for a self-conscious first date if that's what you are striving for here... Service was very friendly and homely, giving educated advice on food orders and portion sizes.Some of the dishes were excellent, but others suffer from the traditional New American curse of just putting a bunch of ""interesting"" ingredients onto the plate together and praying it works. We ordered:- Vollkornbrot (4/5): yes, the bread is absolutely the best part about High Street. The vollkornbrot is excellent, filled with strong dark rye aroma and dipped in delicious rutabaga hummus. Just wish there were more than 4 tiny pieces that came with a $12 order.- Anadama (5/5): best thing on the menu. Eel and radish paired with sweet tomatoes on top of a slightly sweet molasses bread. It just works. But again, $16 for one small tartine?- Tripe diavola (3/5): not quite spicy and sounded more interesting on paper than it did in taste. Just your standard tripe dish without much to make it too interesting.- Grilled squid (3/5): five stars for the plating - the dish is pretty as a picture, but again, nothing to write home about. Carrots add a nice crunch I suppose? But the squid itself is just nicely cooked, perhaps on the dryer side.- Cauliflower caramelle (4.5/5): High Street does carbs the best. These little stuffed pastas are absolutely fantastic, swimming in delicious rosemary and buttermilk that reminds you of an elevated version of the traditional Italian sage and butter preparation. Delicious, but very small portion size - have I mentioned that before? Among the four of us we probably got two small caramelle each. Did I also mention this costs $24?- Seaweed bucatini (4/5): again, carbs shine here and this is another winner. Comes with nice crab lumps and topped with scallions to give it almost an Asian inspiration. Portion is a bit more generous as well (i.e. we maybe could have three bites instead of two).- Both the entrees (duck and beef) were good but absolutely standard modern American preparations (i.e. forgettable). I'd double up on the pasta.- Saving graces would be that the desserts are actually extremely interesting. We had a carrot cake that was perfectly baked and slightly crispy on the outside and a little moist on the inside, served with a scoop of slightly salty bourbon ice cream that complemented the flavors perfectly. The salted caramel and chocolate budino was also excellent, but runs the risk of being slightly too salty than sweet.All in all, I'd come back to High Street for dinner if it was half the price and put its breads and pastas - what it is really good at - much more front and center. But for now, just ok.",3,,
162,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,2/10/2017,"Restaurant Week in NYC is a blessed event; it's a wonderful opportunity to sample the goods of so many restaurants I may not initially think to patronize. The menus can be hit or miss, depending on where you stop by to eat. High Street on Hudson definitely falls into the former category. My friends and I had a grand fest! Arriving around 6:15 after a nice ol' blizzard, the place was virtually empty but still filled up after 7 p.m., snow be damned! The interior is so beautiful, a striking mix of modern yet country. The scent of smoked wood wafted from the open kitchen as we seated. Perusing the R.W. menu was a challenge, as I was having a hard time deciding between to many excellent choices; lucky for us, they were offering two appetizer choices instead of one, which pleased me. I ended up the Crispy Broccoli, served with scallions and a spicy chow chow sauce and the Kabocha Pumpkin Hummus, served with seedy volkkornbrot bread. Both were excellent, though I wasn't expecting the chow chow spice to be spicy; I didn't know what it was and it wasn't indicated as spicy on the menu. Oh well! I managed. Haha. My friends each got the Beet Cured Salmon Toast and the Dry Aged Beef Tartate; I sampled the latter and that was some top notch tartare, indeed! The potato skin shell it was served in was a wonderful vessel for it. I got the rye mafaldine with duck ragu; mafaldine is a pasta I do not think I've ever consumed, and I am kind of in love with it now! A long small-width noodle with curly sides akin to a lasagna noodle, it definitely works will with picking up large amounts of the ragu with it. It was cooked to perfection! The duck ragu was crumbled meat with a slight sausagey flavor in a brown sauce, and I really enjoyed it. It's a warming winter dish. My friends, respectively, ordered the arctic char (highly recommended by our waiter!) and the pork loin. I had bites of both and they were very tasty; I'm not a fish fan, but this was cooked perfectly. The pork loin was also prepared well, just a teeny pink pink and nicely juicy. For dessert, the gingerbread rum mousse was a wonderful caramely treat, but the flourless chocolate cake with balsamic vinegar ice cream really knocked it out of the park! Balsamic vinegar and ice cream are two foods I wouldn't have seen melding well until I took a bite; WOW, one bite got me woke, as the kids say! (They're currently saying that, right? Ha!)Overall, this was one of the better Restaurant Week menus I've tasted in the past few years, and I could see myself coming back of my own volition to try their brunch or dinner at another point. I truly enjoyed everything I ate. Also, of note, our waiter, Beau, is not only wonderful but we both discovered our shared love of the show ""Schitt's Creek"", so I took a special shine to him. Ha!",1,1,2
163,Melody K.,"New Haven, CT",67,143,46,3.0,10/14/2017,"Pretty good breakfast food but we got a $17 breakfast sandwich that we didn't expect!

Not sure what they were but they were a great addition. And visually stunning! The scallions also went so well with this dish.Mushrooms with black, wild rice was also a great combination of chewy, nutty, and tangy. Funnily enough, the bread was not my thing. I really love bread that's fresh baked, hot, crusty (or not) and tender on the inside...and that's not the type of bread that's here.

My friend ordered the Pastrami and Hash and I ordered The Bodega sandwich and a latte using Rival Brothers Coffee. Lets take sandwich. The Bodega is a sausage, egg, and cheese but where High Street on Hudson succeeds is the sage-pepper biscuit that brings it altogether. Flaky, savory, and buttery and holds up well. There was also a green pepper sauce which you could use and gave the sandwich a great spicy kick. You can also do take out if you so wish though I'd advise to eat the sandwiches right there and then.

I thought that was very kind and professional. I will try to go back to this place next time I am in NY and hopefully have the great experience that everyone else writes about on Yelp. Original Review: This is a service based review--My husband and I were in NY from Brazil meeting up with friends from London who were also in town. It was a rainy Saturday and we had been told great things about High Street on Hudson. We got there around 4pm, super excited to be seeing each other in New York but cold from the rain. We were greeted by some rude servers who said we were not allowed to sit inside because they were in their 'transition phase' from lunch to dinner. (I suggest updating your hours on Yelp to reflect this). Even though we had to sit outside, we had to order our drinks inside since there was also no ""table service"" during this time. We waited in the cold rain for about 15-20 minutes before our drinks finally arrived (2 of them were beers). I got the mezcal drink which was decent if you like mezcal but nothing fancy. All of our drinks looked like 'well-drinks' if that makes sense -- in a plain small glass with ice. I also tried the Bloody Mary which was pretty standard but good enough. We really didn't like the cocktail that had gin, champagne vinegar and raspberry (can't remember the name). It smelled and tasted like straight up vinegar.Even their website says: ""High street. Morning. Noon. And Night"" and their hours on Yelp claim they are open 8am-10pm. We walked a LONG way to get there and none of us know NY well, which is why we didn't go somewhere else. There was a nice way for them to handle this 'transition phase', which would have been to let us sit at a table in the corner inside instead of having us sit outside in the rain, that's just terrible service and plain rude in my opinion. There should always be exceptions, especially if you market yourself as a restaurant that is open morning, noon and night. The worst part was that when we would go inside to use the restroom, the whole staff was gathered in the warm dining area laughing, eating and chatting while 5 of their CUSTOMERS sat miserably outside. It appeared they were having a staff meeting. The only pleasant part of my experience was the host (or maybe a manager? it was hard to tell what his role was but he was dressed nicely) who let me trade out my friends vinegar cocktail for a Bloody Mary. He was quite pleasant and polite.I guess maybe this experience came down to expectation vs reality. We all arrived at this place happy and excited and because of the way we were treated, we left feeling angry, insignificant and less excited about New York in general.",3,5,3

197,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,2.0,10/3/2016,"We met here with a group of friends for dinner a few weeks back, and with the windows thrown open on a breezy Saturday night, it had a very nice, open, and casual feel to it. Our table wasn't ready on time - we did have to wait about 15 minutes or so, and the table to lean on outside is no great shakes - but in the end we did get seated a a booth that's tucked into a corner of the restaurant that faces the kitchen - a pretty convenient spot to be. Our servers were nice enough, always making sure we had full glasses, and the food did come out relatively quickly. The beer selection was unimpressive, but the couple of bottles of wine that we had were good (if somewhat generic).As for the food itself, I probably would have a little bit of a better opinion of it if we had realized ahead of time that the tasting menu meant we were sharing the portions, instead of being given our own plates. Sharing amongst 5 people is a bit awkward, and in the end, I felt like I did not get to sample anything an adequate amount as a result. Even though I did try many things for the $65, the value really isn't there. The food itself had some highlights - the best being the short rib, which was textured and extremely juicy, as well as the very good carrot hummus - but otherwise, much of the food was very generically new American without much direction or inspiration. The bluefish on toast was alright, but not any part of it was very memorable. I did enjoy the cauliflower pasta, but again - because of the sharing - I ended up with only a few pieces and thus didn't get to enjoy this very well-executed vegetarian-based pasta dish. Desserts were also split up for 5, and when you have ice cream involved, you end up losing a bunch of the food because of melting.I would like to come back again sometime, but I would almost certainly order a la carte and get my own properly-sized portions. I would definitely NOT recommend the tasting menu given you have to share it (unless you are with only one other person). Perhaps my opinion will go up if/when I come back, but based on this initial experience, it's not that high on my list.",2,,

I loved the gnocchi I had on the winter menu and recently enjoyed the fried broccoli and beet steak entree on their summer menu. Originally being from philly, where the original high street is, I love the local feel/ farm to table quality of this place! I don't often visit the same restaurant twice in NYC, with so many options, but I will continue to head back to high street on Hudson",,,
199,Nick Z.,"Auburndale, MA",109,2,0,5.0,8/28/2017,"While the service was a little slow, the food certainly did not disappoint. They were very busy so I can understand the wait. I got a pastrami sandwich for breakfast that was absolutely stunning. The Hudson isn't far off so if you order take out you can get a great view too.",,,
