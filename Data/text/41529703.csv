And then you look up and see a beautiful shelf of bottles with a wide range of whiskey. Scotch, japanese, they have it all. You can sit at the bar but it feels kind of cramped. The little wall counters at the back room offer more privacy for conversation. If you're a whisky fan, this bar should be in your arsenal.",1,,1

Small but intimate. Came with my sister and we both really loved it. The bartenders are really cool and down-to-earth so don't be a douchbag. I wanted to try that Taiwanese whiskey that won that big whiskey competition a couple years ago and they had a bottle. They weren't sure if it was the one that won, but they knew exactly what company I was talking about (I read about it online). It's amazing. Super smooth with a fruity taste.My sister and I also had a conversation with the nephew of the owner of the bar! It was pretty cool 'cause he overheard me say how cool the bar was. We had a good conversation. Would definitely come here regularly.",1,,1

Enjoy my more than average tip. Your performance was worth it!If anybody is going to this place, I am not saying you have to believe me but the chances are strong you will walk out in a bad mood after paying a lot of money for what you thought would be a good time.

5,Carlos H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",99,294,0,5.0,5/27/2018,It not easy to give five stars to a bar.  This is a bar owned a veteran .  Believe he was a US Marine.   It was fleet week for New York and active military service would have the residents of NY city provide food and drinks.  for serious fans of whisky  and bourbon this is the place to go.Had a Manhattan cocktail with Whistle pig rye.  The bar man is a true mixologist.  Perfect balance of rye and bitters.  One of the best I have tasted.  Next had a bourbon neat ..Redemption.  They are usually $45.00 a  2oz which was at $25.00.  Just an amazing whisky.  I believe 10 yrs and it had a depth of a much older whisky.Lastly.  I was talking about Japanese suntory yamazaki sherry cask and one other with Mizunara oak cask.  The bar pulled out an 18 years old expression of the yamazaki mizunara from the top shelf.  $6900.00 per bottle.  Approx $325.00 per 2 oz pour.  Now my jaw dropped.  I love New York City.  Even in Japan this bottle is super rare these days..like a ghost bottle.   This bar rocks that they would have this bottle.    I been to the bar in Tokyo owned by the chairman of suntory.  And the don't carry.,3,,2

7,Jae R.,"Manhattan, NY",304,213,761,5.0,9/8/2017,"An intimate whiskey bar located on 10th Ave off of the corner of 49th St., this place offers a great locale for you to chill by yourself with some whiskey or for a date. The place is quite small, but it doesn't get overcrowded, which is nice.This review is a special shout-out to Josh. I've never gone to a bar by myself before, but I don't know what got into me, but I decided to check this place out because I thought it looked cool when I was passing. I asked Josh for a recommendation for whiskey for someone who is just beginning to get into it. He let me taste a few different options that he likes, and I ended up getting a chocolatey non-bourbon bourbon (he explained this to me, but I forget it at this point) on the rocks. He kept me company while also serving new customers in between, so I had a great night out then. We capped it with a shot together, so all in all a very good night.I highly recommend this place for any dates or if you want to have an easy weeknight. Ask the bartender for recommendations, and they're great at it. I'll definitely come back.",4,1,4
8,Andrew A.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,180,49,4.0,2/25/2018,"This is a pricey, although excellent bar to try different whiskies with a highly knowledgeable staff. The staff's knowledge of what to serve is really both a great point, and at times a negative, as if you are looking for a specific item, you don't have that available, as they do not have a menu or list of whiskies for you to view, rather having you rely on the staff. The small, quaint environment is a great intimate setting, but expect to be put back from $17 and up for the drinks. These are very good whiskies, and they have pretty generous poursIts a great occasional spot, but the prices are a bit steep for me to frequent here as often as i'd like.",1,,1
9,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,5.0,6/20/2018,"On The Rocks is a great bar. There are no menus here and over 300 kinds of whiskey on the wall, all carefully curated. This can be a bit overwhelming at first, but rely on the expert bartenders to help you pick your delicious poison. They will happily give you a small sample to make sure you like your choice. Our bartender easily hooked us up with a whiskey based on telling him which flavor profiles we enjoy. Pricing starts at a 2oz pour and they will let you know what each costs before ordering so you aren't in the dark. Most of the whiskey here is a bit on the pricey side Our choices were $15 and $22-which for an aged Pappy Van Winkle is actually decent. Our pours were very generous and both the music (old school jazz/Judy Garland, Sinatra etc) and atmosphere made it an enjoyable spot to sit and slowly sip them. The bar itself is tiny so it's probably best to come at an off time to really get the full experience and a bar seat. Cheers to having amazing specialty bars like this in the neighborhood!",1,,2

They didn't. The whiskey drinkers gave examples of what they like and from there the bartender customized and prepared a flight. After tasting a variety of whiskeys, all different prices,it's safe to say I don't like whiskey. The bartender ended up making me a whiskey sour with a little extra sour and I was able to enjoy it. Why would I give a bar 5 stars even though I didn't like the drinks? These people know whiskey. The bar is small and it gives it that local feel. There are a ton of whiskeys from all over the world to sample. If you're a whiskey aficionado then this place is for you. If you're like me and you're unsure if you like whiskey come here.. the bartender will be able to recommend something for you to try based on your preferred spirits and flavors.

They're getting rarer in Manhattan, so support them while they're here- Reasonable prices for the poursWHAT'S NOT COOL- The bartender lost my credit card while ringing me up. How? Yeah, I don't know--and neither does he. Somewhere between putting the card in the bill holder (he claims) and handing it to me, it just....disappeared. He searched for half an hour (as did my friend and I)--even checking the ceiling at some point (???)--yet couldn't find it. I don't know why. The bar is the size of a Manhattan studio, and the back of the bar is about 1/8th of that size. How do you just....lose....a customer's credit card? Granted, he'd been drinking (he even drank something with us), and at that point, the bar was infested with a pack of obnoxious out-of-towners (the kind who complain loudly about paying $16 for a Manhattan (true story) with some prissy princesses who order red wine at a whisky bar (also true story))--but none of that really excuses this. Sure, he comped our bill--all $17 of it--but so what? Anyone who's ever lost a credit card knows how massively inconvenient it is to replace it, particularly when it's also the one used to pay a ton of bills that now need to be manually changed.So yeah, 1 star. Oh, did you think this was a fair and balanced review? No, son. Losing my credit card is what's known as an automatic dealbreaker. Like multiplying any number by 0. You can't redeem yourself after that. But s'okay. They didn't even carry my favorite bourbon, so I'll be taking my new card to other bars that do.",7,9,3

There is no menu and the bartender will be your guide. You tell him what you like and he serves as your whisky guide. I asked for something mild with not so much bite and he served up a Texas Bourbon meant to be had with 1 ice cube and truthfully, it was fantastic. A little hint of sweetness and seemed to be what I was looking for. While the bartender might be knowledgeable, this place should really consider getting a menu of some sort so you can browse the selections. It's a shame because you're left only to rely on the bartender even though I'm sure he was more than happy to walk you thru any selection. As an enthusiast it would have been nice to have an extensive menu to browse while asking questions. For a niche bar like this, If you are a scotch or whisky drinker, this should be on your to go list. Great place to try some whiskys you would not find on any other shelf in the city.",4,,2

OH MY BAD, DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A RULE THAT YOU COULD ONLY HAVE WHISKEY! So why do you have vodka at all then? Or gin? OR ANYTHING BESIDES WHISKEY? Then asked for a glass of water... which the bartender sighed at top volume, sulked off like a thirteen year old, and then casually slammed a lukewarm water down on the counter. NICE, BUDDY. Oh also, just going with the theme above, asked for a lemon and couldn't give me one, because... ITS A WHISKEY BAR. Hey Brent- I CAN SEE THE FUCKING LEMONS.

19,Priya S.,"New York, NY",214,151,94,5.0,4/4/2017,"Stumbled upon On The Rocks, which is truly a diamond in the rough in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. It is seemingly hidden with lots of construction happening outside. Most of the customers were regulars who lived in the area and loved their whiskey. Their selection of whiskey is extensive but they also serve bourbon and wine. The bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable and seemed intent on ensuring their customers were genuinely happy about their purchase. There is no formal menu, instead you talk to the bartender about your preferences, your mood, and your personality and he creates a personalized cocktail using that information. The bartender provided individual attention, unbothered by the other patrons waiting, to ensure that my husband and I were delivered drinks and a flight we would thoroughly enjoy. It was a refreshing small business experience. There is no food served here so you can bring in outside food. This place is SMALL (one bar with 10ish stools and one table in the back) so come early if you want a seat. This bar is open until 4AM so it is a good spot for a nightcap if you live in the area.",2,,

To begin, the staff has ALWAYS MADE OTR. The bartenders have always been quick, smart and charming. Now, let's just say I wish I can say the same for the owner. He's a womanizing, 70 year old scumbag who preys on young women from a back room. It doesn't matter if you've been friends with him for 1 day, 10 years or have never met. JUST BEWARE.

A few seconds after she walked in she was accosted by a man in his 60's demanding her ID. I saw this guy, he did not look like an employee. My friend asked if he was security to which he replied ""I'm the fucking owner."" My friend, a woman who is a service industry professional, was shocked at this mans language. He looked at her ID, which showed that she's of 25 years, before suddenly exclaiming that she's kicked out wasn't to be served. This was unexpected. After exchanging words with him she left very upset.I don't know if the ""owner"" treated my friend the way he did because of her appearance (having just got off of work at her own bartending gig), the fact that she was Latina, or that he was just a cranky old man but I will be sure to let fellow industry professionals to know to avoid this place.",3,2,1

The bartender replied ""I'm not sure, around $18-20ish?"" They do not have a computer system and the prices were not marked anywhere that a customer could see so it felt like the bartender could make up any price for any whiskey. This made me feel very uncomfortable. The bartender was drunk, making up prices and instead of giving me a sample of a whiskey she kept telling me about, she poured a full shot and took it for herself. I did buy a glass of this whiskey and she then charged me $20. Do they charge so much to make up for the cost of the bartenders drinking on the job? Perhaps.

After popping up as a ""Whiskey Bar"" i was expecting something a bit nicer in decor but that didn't dissuade us from sitting down for a drink.I asked for a whiskey list, which they did not carry, but the whiskeys were clearly displayed behind the bar.I order 2 Yamazakis. This is a nice, popular Japanese whiskey that I've ordered at several bars around NYC over the last few years. I've never paid more than $20/glass, usually maxing out around $18. The bartender poured me two glasses. After we finished the drinks, I requested his recommendation in the same price range for our next round. At this point, he explained to me that they just knocked the price down from $45/glass to $35/glass for the Yamasaki. I was dumbfounded at how overpriced this was.I should have left at that point, but we needed to kill some time before dinner so I asked for another round, but cheaper this time. Ended up giving me two $30/glass of a Taiwanese whiskey. Again, i did not know the price when he served the drinks, because they didn't have menu or list.All in all, this dude ended up charging me ~$150 for 4 glasses of whiskey that would have cost me no more than $80 at the most expensive of places in NYC. On top of that, they were so precisely measured out to exactly one shot in a glass, that it was actually off-putting. The bartender may have been knowledgeable about whiskey but after seeing him give a few free shots to a few regulars that he seemed to know, i am pretty sure he overcharged me intentionally to pay for others' drinks. The place was closer to a beer drenched pub than an upscale rooftop lounge type of place and has no business charging the prices they do.I never write reviews, but after 1 week, I'm still fuming about the audacity of this place. My only guess is that he thought we were foreigners and didn't know any better or that we were so rich we wouldn't notice.Good whiskey, absolutely ridiculous price, and below average setting.",16,1,

Two of my friends decided to not even order a drink because it took her so long to just get half our drink order. Seriously never again! We couldnt wait to get out of there.

Don't even  ask me the difference because I wouldn't know by just the taste but it was an experience I suppose. The drink menu will be given to you in a binder. The place is very dim and seating is very limited. You will hear the sounds of Sinatra as this is a very easy going place.

If you aren't sure what to try, the knowledgeable bartenders are willing and able to do so.

For a pour from an average ~$40-$50 bottle (think the middle-aged Glenfiddiches, Laphroaigs, Ardbegs) you will pay at least $10. The cheapass in me says ""you damn idiot, why would you pay $10 for a pour when you can get the whole bottle for the value of 5 pours here?""It's because you can try many, many different things without having to commit to buying 6 or 7 bottles!They do flights and this is what I would recommend. For the thrifty person, a good selection like what they have at On The Rocks has value because you can learn what you like and don't like without having to break the bank on bottles that you may end up finding repulsive.They will also make whiskey cocktails like Sazerac, Old Fashioned, and Manhattan, and they do these well for a competitive price, but that's not /really/ what the place is about.Of course, there is other value in a bar like this: it's nice and quiet with an intimate vibe. Don't pound a $15 pour of Connemara on your way to the club. Stick around and enjoy some quiet times with a friend or two.Then again, their selection alone makes this a 5 star place.

89,Bryce W.,"Manhattan, NY",32,124,6,3.0,3/10/2014,"I popped in here with some friends last Friday, after seeing this bar on a ""Best Whiskey Bars in NYC"" list on the internets. As far as whiskey goes, this place does not disappoint. Whiskey, Scotch, bourbon, single malt, small reserve, double oak... it has them all, from the most recognizable to the most rare. The whiskey bible is totally intimidating, as a matter of fact. Some of the options get really, really REALLY expensive, but if you're drinking for enjoyment and not to impress or have a life-changing booze experience, expect to pay between $12 and $20 for a single pour. The decor of the place is also appropriate... a little cramped, a little dim, but authentic. This bar smartly relies on the depth of its offerings, not on being snazzy or stylish. Many other reviews talked about how this place doesn't fit more than 25 people or so. This is true, although I up that estimate to about 35, but being on 10th Avenue, On The Rocks is far enough away from the touristy midtown crowd that even on a Friday night, the three people in my party were able to get seats at the bar and not feel like we were taking up valuable real estate. The one drawback to this place was the bartender. Although he clearly knew his whiskeys and knew how to make a cocktail, he was so dismissive, so grouchy that it cast a shadow over the experience. I'm not looking for a show at the bar ala Cocktail or even necessarily a conversation, but I don't want to feel like my ordering a second drink or asking a question is getting in the way of the bartender's regularly scheduled brooding. After just two drinks, I decided I didn't want to keep exchanging tips for glowers and moved along down the road.",7,1,

Situated in the borders of Hell's Kitchen, On the Rocks is not what you would expect from your typical Midtown West haunt. Nigh impossible to find a quiet bar in Hell's Kitchen on a Friday night, we sauntered into On the Rocks. Vintage soul softly played in the backdrop. The decor was simple but complimented by the dim light which allowed you to vaguely make out the brands of the endless bottles of whiskey atop the bar shelves. Luckily all the tonics on hand were in their menu. Their giant binder of a menu.This whiskey bible, though nicely curated, was incredibly daunting. I thought myself a fairly versed whiskey drinker, but clearly I knew jack. The bourbons, ryes, scotches, knew no end. Japanese whiskys listed were more than your regulars. They even showcased a decent Indian whisky list. The bartender was court and knowledgeable,  very helpful in picking a drink or two. Unfortunately we only had time for a single drink. I would love to take the time to explore the rest of their armory. From what I hear, they make a killer sazerac.",1,,

I don't know if this is very often but this was completely unacceptable: I tried to order over 6 different scotches and they were all out of them. If you came to be a scotch bar. You have to have available scotches that are more sophisticated than your standard 12 year old glenlivet, Glenmoramgie, or balvenie. This is kids play. If your a real scotch bar. Have something that can wow me and make me want to go there cuz I can't go anywhere else in the city for it. I traveled across town to drink stuff I could get around every corner in nyc. This bar would be great in Boise, not New York",3,,

It goes from super crowded to nearly empty hour by hour.They specialize in the traditional sazeracs, manhattans, and old fashioneds. They have a little haphazard binder for a menu, which looks like it's probably updated often when they get new bottles. The bartender was quite slow when I was there, but he was all by his lonesome creating drinks (these are cocktails that have multiple and meticulous steps) and handling payments. All while trying to maintain a calm, friendly and chilled demeanor. Tip: Right behind the bar there is a nice little area for a larger party (5-8 people). It's a nice spot to duck into if it's available.",1,,

Went for happy hour, and it was a great deal. Not too crowded since we came in the early evening. Prices are fair (for a bar), and they have a GREAT selection. The bartender, Dan, isn't pretentious AT all. He's got a mellow vibe that makes you feel comfortable and calm, while enjoying your whiskey.

Half of the whiskeys I tried to order they did not have. I've never had that experience at other places.* I ordered an Old Fashioned, bartender made it with club soda, and didn't even ask me if I wanted it (it said optional on the menu, the classic has no club soda).

Why does a professional even need a measuring device? This is amateurish at best.   I don't think the bartender was even old enough to drink let alone understand fine spirits.  Plus they were out of several standard bottles.  No Yamazaki?

At night, it almost seems eerie, thanks to the ominous glowing bulbs of light that emanate through the single pane of window. The only factor distinguishing it from the shuttered shops next to it is its lit-up name written off-center in smallcaps, ""ON THE ROCKS"". And that is exactly what this place is good for and what it is meant for. A quiet, almost quaint atmosphere intended for the man who had a heartbreak, the woman who had a fight with her girlfriend, the disillusioned 9-5 worker, the overburdened lawyer, and the f-it-all manic depressive looking to drown whatever sorrows he/she is looking to kill. That said, it's also great to take your girl and have a quiet saturday night in each other's company. :DThe single bartender working the bar knows his drinks. They were out of the Yamazaki 12yo, so he recommended the Glendronach 12yo instead, with a splash of water. That certainly did the trick. The lady got the Old Fashioned Cocktail, which to her was a bit strong to start, but killer to finish. The extensive list of whiskeys is impressive, but climbs high on the dollar scale. Furthermore, they were cleaned out on some of the popular whiskeys that I had in mind to try (Yamazaki) so that more or less defeats the purpose of having an extensive list of whiskeys. Thus, half star.The main reason why this review errs in favor of the 4 star, however, is thanks to the rowdy crowd of neighbors who probably transported themselves from a local bar, screaming in their slurred speech about various obscenities.  While entertaining for the first ten minutes, it somewhat killed the mood of our date night.

This struck me as odd because we hadn't said a word or even had a chance to take a seat.   It would seem that not only were some of our group the wrong color for the night, but as a whole we may have been 40 years too young for that night.  Either way, their staff was horrendous in the 30seconds to a minute that we were ""allowed in the bar"".  If manners, good business, and tolerance are your areas of interest: avoid this place.",3,,

During happy hour most drinks were 25 percent off, so that brought the price into the range of reasonableness.  The ambiance is ok, sort of dark, and the fact that the bartender had some friends hanging around who weren't drinking but seemed a bit ""off"" made the visit a little uncomfortable.

However, this is quite a narrow bar and my friend had her leg upon the back supporting board of a bar stool directly across from her.

Maybe he had a bad day, perhaps he is a person often filled with hate or anger, but he was extremely unreasonable and incredibly rude to her and to myself. There is no break in the story, this is how this moment panned out. The owner acted without reason and with complete rudeness. He ordered that we get our check and leave immediately.

The bar is comfortable and pleasant; but the entire back area only has stools against a very shallow counter. It makes it awfully uncomfortable to sit in any circumstance, and even more so with more than two people. There's even a nice side room at the back, where three or four people could theoretically sit, but there's only the stools and the counter back there.

Another of those things was WHAT to drink.Dad quote:""Son, some people will tell you that tequila, rum, vodka, cognac, whatever, is the best drink in the world. All of those people are wrong. A few people will tell you that Scotch whiskey is the best drink in the world. Those people are also wrong. A very few will tell you that bourbon, a good Kentucky bourbon, is the best drink in the world. Sadly, those people are also wrong.Bourbon is the ONLY drink in the world. The rest is flavored water.""I learned well. It's the only thing I'll voluntarily choose if I have a choice. I mean, if you have anything else, I'll probably drink it. But the act of drinking by itself won't be part of my fun. It'll be a means to an end. (I have a theory that nobody, nobody not never, in the history of the world, has ever used vodka for any other reason, and if they say they actually enjoy it, they're lying - that stuff is sleazy, flavorless, and horrible, and yes, I did just wholesale dismiss the best-selling spirit in all of America, but YOU'RE ALL WRONG, YOU COSMO-SWILLING - anyway.)Now, a glass of bourbon, on the other hand, is THE most pleasurable means to an end. A dram of plain ol' 8-dollar-a-bottle Jim Beam will put a big, donkey-punching grin on my face in two seconds flat, long before the alcohol takes hold.All this preamble is to say that, for a bourbon/whiskey hound like myself, this place (this MAGNIFICENT place) is heaven.Good bar checklist -1. CHEAP DRINKS: Here's the thing. Some of the whiskies on sale here cost more for a single bottle than most bars' entire stock. This bar has about 40 of those bottles, and over 200 whiskies total. With that in mind, I'm going to adjust my expectations and compare this with the bourbon list at Five Napkin Burger. Every bourbon that's available at both places is around 2 or 3 dollars cheaper here, which means that for a damn fine bourbon you're looking at between 10 and 15 bucks a pop. Normally, my money-grubbing self would be flabbergasted, but for a GREAT bourbon, that's killer. And they take their name seriously. You get two honkin' big, thick rocks that melt perfectly slowly, not the usual ice-tray b.s. restaurants like the one mentioned before use to pad out under-pours. They must have some kind of special trays or something, because I've never seen rocks like that except for the ones I make myself. Everything is served in an honest-to-God ROCKS GLASS, a legit tumbler, the kind you've seen in your granddad's cabinet but all other bars in NY seem to have forgotten exist. And for your money, you get a generous, all-is-as-it-should-be 2.5 ounce pour, compared to average 1 or 1.5 at most bars/restaurants (I've worked in a lot of 'em. This is usual practice - fill small glass with ice, one ounce of liquor. Stretches the bottle's shelf life. Cheap a-wads). You get every cent's worth, and because of that, just looking at the drinks is a treat, let alone imbibing them. This is what anything ""on the rocks"" should be.2. CLIENTELE: Quiet, respectable, well-behaved. I've never once felt claustrophobic here, and for such an admittedly small place, that's a hell of an achievement. The people that come here, for the most part, know their whiskey and respect the chill-out vibe of the place. I'm not a huge snob when it comes to liquor knowledge, really - I don't turn up my nose if someone doesn't know whether they want a bourbon or a Tennessee whiskey - but I think there's a certain base-level knowledge and etiquette you should possess if you go into a bar or restaurant that specializes in something, like this one does. And everyone here seems to. Great guys, all of 'em. 3. DECOR: Perfect. Small place, dark wood, low light, Frank Sinatra on the sound system. This is the perfect mix between Old West saloon/watering-hole, 1940s late-nite exclusive jazz lounge, and tony Kentucky country club. It's comfortable, quiet, inviting, and just dark enough. The decor makes you feel like taking your time and savoring the beautiful creation in your glass, which is exactly as it should be. You wanna do shots and get hammered quick? You're gonna be hard-pressed to work up that kind of enthusiasm here. Go elsewhere. This is for the end of the night. The cool-down. The savoring of the moment. Nurse your broken heart or bask in the glory of a night well-spent, either one will be improved tenfold by coming here.4. IT FACTOR: Old-style cool, amazing bartenders (JEFF!), great music, quiet warmth. If Don Draper were a bar, he'd be this bar. Nothing better. Don't tell your friends about this. I want it to myself for ever and ever. Hell's Kitchen is infinitely better for this place's presence.",7,5,9
187,Luis Q.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,4/19/2015,Great whiskey selection. Homely atmosphere. Intimate environment,,,
188,Janette W.,"San Jose, CA",275,766,67,4.0,10/27/2012,"This was a great end of the night spot. First, it's a really beautiful place, with a gorgeous bar and a great all wood aesthetic. So, so many whiskeys that I was overwhelmed... in a good way. There was even a side selection of bitters so you could chose what you wanted in your Manhattan. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable, and totally willing to help you wade through the impressive whiskey selection. Another plus was the fun, neighborhood vibe. I liked how, even on a Sunday, it seemed like all the regulars were out. Definitely the kind of place I'd love to call my own neighborhood bar.",1,,
189,Tim B.,"Auburndale, MA",8,172,0,4.0,4/18/2011,"Our ""now"" favorite neighboorhood watering hole. With a selection of Whiskey,Bourbon, Rye, Scotch and so on and so on you'll find a spirit here to suit your fancy. This is a great place to have a slow drink, catch up with friends and as we have learned, make so new ones. No TV's (yeah) , dark walls and relaxing. The barkeeps are great and the service is top notch. I encourage you all to stop in and imbibe with Hell's Kitchen.",,,
190,Jane M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,74,11,4.0,5/11/2013,It's a small/quiet bar which reminds me a boutique hotel bar. This is good date spot. I will come back to enjoy something on the rocks.,,,
191,Blake M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,0,5.0,8/3/2013,"Very nice bartender. Old fashion was very well made. For those not interested in their large assortment of whiskey, they offer other spirits, including a nice cucumber flavored vodka tonic.",,,
192,Praeriez V.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",83,1,0,4.0,8/1/2013,"Great place for Bourbon, quiet and chill. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin singing all night long! My favorite place so far.",,,
193,Dan L.,"Houston, TX",147,127,9,4.0,3/13/2013,"Went there late night Thursday. When only the freaks are out. Got myself a Mon Chapeau Rouge. Figured I like their beer so why not try their whiskey. Very good choice. Interesting flavor. Jeff, the excellent, showman of a bartender, was awesome. I love their extensive selection. Prices are fair. Pricey but a good pour. It's dark there and that's how I like it. Nice crowd too. I'll go back again if I'm ever in the area again.",,,
194,David B.,"Manhattan, NY",45,367,4,5.0,2/11/2013,"5 stars If you like Johnnie Black try the Oban over the Cardhu. They have tons of liquor choices and they serve beer and wine too. This place is small, but the decor is great, has a great vibe and the bartenders are extremely knowledgeable about there liquor. This place is a must try.",,,
195,Johann K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,1.0,3/2/2014,"Went here hoping to try out a few drinks from the long list of scotch they have. Was pretty dissapointed. First of all its absurdly expensive, you can get the very same drinks for way less in many other bars around the city. Also, the service is a disaster. Takes forever to get a drink. You'd think with the prices here the owner could afford to get at least one more bartender. Then again, (see some other reviews) the owner seems to not only be incredibly rude but cheap as well. As for the place itself, its tiny and incredibly cramped. Nothing quite like waiting forever for an overpriced drink in a silent, cramped place full of pretentious DBs. Unless you're feeling masochistic, your money and time would be better spent elsewhere.",2,,
196,Alana K.,"New York, NY",0,6,2,5.0,6/23/2013,"This place is fantastic! The bartender was friendly and prompt. It's a bit small and kind of a hidden gem. Drinks were great, they specialize in whiskey so I'd stick with whiskey drinks for orders.",,,
197,Joon P.,"New York, NY",87,17,1,5.0,12/26/2014,"Excellent whiskey selection, great service, even better Old Fashioned's",,,
198,Reo T.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,192,0,5.0,11/14/2011,Looking for a quiet time alone?Need to burn off some stress?Just need a drink?This is the place! Very laid back with repeat customers. various drinks of beer and liquor. Small but confertable space for a quiet time. I went there couple of times alone and had a great time. I would go back there and bring a book and stay there for awhile!,2,1,2
199,Rob N.,"New York, NY",366,51,46,4.0,11/25/2010,"This is a great addition to 10th ave in the 40's!yes the bartenders are knowledgable. yes they have lots of whiskeys and bourbons.yes the have 60 types of beer (in bottles)It is small or perhaps the word is tiny.currently it gets busier later, so if you want a seat i suggest to go early, however that may change as more folks learn about this place.",,,
