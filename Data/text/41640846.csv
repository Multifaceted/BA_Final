From communal tables, to intimate couches, to tables for four, it's got it all. Randolph provides whatever you need. It's not in a prime location for weekend activities, but I imagine the place can be packed with work day crew over the weekdays. There's a self tap station. I have no idea how it works, or how you use it, but it's there. If you don't want to deal with that you can deal with other humans, such as the bartender at the bar. You know like before Watson or Skynet takes over. They have games in the back, which makes it even better for groups. As I explained though you can be couple here on a date and it'll be fine. I just have no idea what it's like here on a Saturday or Sunday as the neighborhood could be a little dead around that point.",2
1,,10/27/2018,68,,"Troy, NY",Nancy Z.,2,1.0,28,I would rate this place a 2 on the food and 0 for service.Don't expect to be served... You have to fill up your own water and beer and go up to the bar to order food. I got a calamari for $16 and it was an extremely small portion of food and definitely not worth the price.,
2,,9/29/2018,192,,"New York, NY",Rebecca L.,98,5.0,338,"My friends and I came here after work on Friday to celebrate my partner's birthday. We really enjoyed our night at Randolph Beer. Atmosphere:Upon walking in, I was impressed with the space and how favorable the layout was for both large and small parties. The reservation process online was easy and guaranteed us our table for 2 hours. Uniquely, the brewhouse is cashless but you can request tokens at the bar to play the games (Ski-Ball, Foosball, Pinball, etc). I liked how clean the place was, as it provided a slightly classier vibe than your typical drinking spot. While the place was busy, it didn't feel overcrowded and we didn't have to shout all night to hear each other. Service was very friendly as well. Food/Drink:Interesting menu consisting of both your typical bar foods and healthier options such as cauliflower rice bowls. I had the Burger with Waffle Fries. I was very impressed with the food- the Burger was juicy with a buttery taste, and the fries were also tasty. I also tried the Fried Chicken sandwich, which was also very good. Food was a bit expensive, (the Burger was $17), but the quality was above your typical bar standard. All food is ordered at the bar and there is a fun self-service beer on tap section. Overall:If you're looking for a relaxed bar with great food and drinks, Randolph Beer is an awesome spot. Prices are a bit high, but the quality and experience is worth it.",1
3,,11/14/2018,1,,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",Andrew R.,0,2.0,3,The food is ok but the fried chicken sandwich is hit and miss- sometimes it's freezer burned and rubbery. More importantly though -- my coworkers and I used to come here a lot to play foosball on our lunch break. That was the main reason we came. But then they replaced that table with a cheaper one that wasn't installed properly; the handles are all out of wack. So we pretty much stopped going. If you guys fix that foosball table please reply to this review. We'll come back!,
4,,9/23/2018,154,,"Cortlandt, NY",Ray B.,0,5.0,23,"I know it's been awhile since I last took the internet by storm with a fevered review that shook the food service industry to its CORE, but fear not, for I have returned to take advantage of my position as a judgmental patron of occasional brunches to transform my biased perception of a brief two-hour experience into a full-fledged declaration of the objective quality of the restaurant. In this case, I declare that the restaurant is good!I came here for a co-worker brunch last week (get turnttt am I riteee???!). We decided to participate in the brunch special, with consists of 90 minutes of unlimited brunch punch, mimosas, select beers, a main entree, and--if you're a supporter of Satan himself--bloody Marys. The restaurant requires the entire table to participate and all members of the party to be present before the clock begins. I must commend the waitstaff for being so accommodating when one unnamed member of our party arrived 45 minutes late (cough*OLIVIA*cough) so we had to wait to start our ordering/drinking. We were not pressured to leave or met with any bad attitude (which honestly would have been completely justified). Once our full party finally assembled, the waiter was very attentive in refilling our drinks and giving us recommendations on what to order. The interior decor was spacious and comfortable, though the bathroom stall doors did not seem to lock properly so I had multiple people walk in on me and I also walked in on multiple people. Luckily, the alcohol had kicked in at this point so this was not a real issue for me. Turning to the food and drink, both were excellent. I am a sucker for eggs benedict, but thanks to a combination of peer pressure and my love for the classy exclamation ""kiss my grits!"", I am proud to announce that I broke from tradition and instead ordered shrimp n' grits, and I'm glad that I did. The perfectly-cooked garlic-poached shrimp sat on a creamy bed of well-seasoned grits, which was enhanced by a sunny-side up egg and shishitos, Asian sweet peppers that added both flavor and texture. The drinks were unique and refreshing. Between the tequila/cucumber and the dark & stormy, the alcohol provided a nice complement to the food and the conversation. I especially enjoyed the variety of the drinks, and how attentive the waiter was in refilling our drinks and reminding us of our time remaining so we could properly plan. Good friends, good food, good alcohol, good service - would recommend!",

6,1,5/25/2018,107,1,"Jersey City, NJ",Sarah G.,26,5.0,142,"Although the Brooklyn ""bro"" culture is alive and well here, Randolph Beer is a cool place to hang out after work. Its location across the street from my office is a huge plus. I love that they have the pay as you go beer taps. I hadn't seen something like that since I was in the South of France and I have always wanted it to exist in the US. When I first started my job my coworker told me about it and my eyes lit up. I mostly just come here for the beer, I've never ordered food or even used the pay-as-you-go feature (we have been sitting outside since it has been so nice out.)  Randolph's house beers are on point and I do enjoy coming in to grab one of those. As for everything else: it's your standard craft brewery. At this point, nothing really impresses me when it comes to selection because so many places have a good selection of beer (I was also spoiled in Pennsylvania where we had a place with an 8 page beer menu and I frequented it ever since I was 21.) What always impresses me are the house beers and whether or not they are actually good. Randolph's selection never disappoints.If you are looking for a quality brewery with a cool tap feature, check this place out :)",1

It's a split floor, and very winding. The beer ATMs are closer to the entrance than the bar (where you need to go to get a beer card), so that's awkward (especially when it's packed). Lots of tables though.There's also tabletop shuffleboard and a pinball machine.The upstairs area is tiny (3 picnic style tables that you can reserve) so not a lot of room to move around. Waitresses came by pretty often, so that was nice.Draft list had a lot of variety. Most beers were $10 for 16oz, which isn't the best, but at least they're good beers. But the beer ATM list is different, so hard to maximize your choices in one fell swoop.In terms of food, they have a full menu. We just did a bunch of appetizers to share. The waffle fries with cheese were yum (melted cheese on top and a dipping cheese on the side). Shishitos were also good, bit pricey at $11. And the Big Ass Pretzel was as advertised. I'm a sucker for beer cheese.Will definitely return, but maybe on a night where the whole neighborhood isn't there for the opening. Keep up the good work, guys!",6

Pour your own with an issued ""debit card"" or poured by the bartender. Food ( at least on a weekday afternoon) ordered at the bar.   Brussel sprouts just a little too sweet. Beef & veggie sliders both delicious.   Friendly bartender ( Henry ) said they have a permit for sidewalk tables in the nice weather. Mostly communal table style inside, but pretty big by NYC standards. Nice open & clean brewing room at work.",1
11,,8/23/2018,59,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ana L.,521,5.0,161,Seemed like a really cool place. Came here after work for a beer and had a good time with hubby. The bartender was attentive something I like. When she seen I was going empty on my glass she approach me to ask if I need another. The food was good. We order the shrimp ceviche and the shrimp tacos. I wasn't to fond of the tacos though. We also ordered oysters east and west coast. I have to say I would always love east coast.,
12,1,1/27/2018,176,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jen D.,71,2.0,112,"I was really excited to check this place out since seeing the ""coming soon"" sign pop up.  Sadly, I don't have great things to report back.  My husband and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon.  I'll break it down simply:- Atmosphere:  Very hipster-dumbo.  Fun games, industrial vibe, and diverse patrons.  The music is SO loud.  Maybe I'm getting old and my days of shouting over music bouncing off of beer kegs is over.  Or maybe the decibel level was well over the normal limit.  Either way, I'm brining my Dubs if I make it back.- Beers:  Cool idea to allow customers to pour their own beer by ounce.  They had a great selection and the process was easy.  On the downside, the prices were high.-Food:  Here is were I rank LOW.  We just wanted a quick snack so we ordered the avocado toast plus an egg ($3) and plus goat cheese ($3).  Seemed a bit ridiculous but hey, we were in DUMBO.  45 minutes later, still no food.  I asked the waiter who took the order how much longer he thought it would be and all he said was, ""I did ring it in.""  Ten minutes later I cancel the order with a different waitress.  Coincidentally a guy from the kitchen comes out with the dish apologizing for its tardiness and offers to take 20% of the top of the bill if we still want it.  So we accept graciously because at this point we are starving.  The dish was a thick piece of cold, burnt toast.  Topped with sliced avocado, a trace a goat cheese, and a very cold over easy egg.  It doesn't take much of an imagination to guess how this tasted.Overall:  Beers were cool but overpriced.  The food takes an hour and comes out cold.  Maybe try their other locations which seem to have better Yelp reviews.",2
13,,2/2/2018,62,,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Tara S.,270,4.0,303,HUGE place. My cousin chose this spot to have some wine after work and talk about life. We had a bottle of Malbec which was a good bang for our buck. They had distributors there so we had the opportunity to try their new Malbec called Loca Linda! We actually enjoyed it more than the current one so that was awesome. It has a much fresher taste. If it's at the same price point it's def a go to if we return. I wasn't crazy about their food options. We ordered veggies and Mac and cheese. After a lot of wine we devoured the Mac and cheese! My cousin enjoyed her veggies as well. I don't eat corn so that was NOT an option for me lol. All in all def a good place. Probably great spot for large groups.,

16,,7/5/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Daniel J.,10,5.0,4,"I can't say enough good things about Randolph Dumbo. We rented out the restaurant on a Friday night in April for our wedding rehearsal/welcome party (175+ people). The team at Randolph, and especially the co-owner Kyle, bent over backwards for us throughout the process. We had multiple tastings in preparation for the event, and were provided off-menu items to meet certain dietary restrictions of our attendees (the food is outstanding by the way - among other delicious items they have the best pretzel this side of Bavaria). Their team went out of their way to customize the space for us, adding personalized touches throughout (in addition to the preparation we did ourselves). Finally, for a buyout Randolph was very reasonably priced, especially when taking into account their willingness to accommodate our every request outside of the initial agreement. To anyone used to dealing with New York bars/restaurants for a buyout situation I can say Randolph couldn't have been easier to work with. We truly found the entire experience to be wonderful and couldn't put forward a higher recommendation for the team at Randolph.",
17,,9/16/2018,0,,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",Gina I.,0,2.0,4,"Really terrible food. This place is obviously known for its beer, and I didn't have any so I won't speak for it in that regard. Eggs Benedict was horrible. Eggs were hard, the hollandaise tasted like it had turned and even the waffle fries weren't good. The pretzel appetizer was tasty but $11 is outrageous for something I would bet my life was made elsewhere, frozen and reheated. Street pretzels are just as good and cost less than a third of that price. I had an iced coffee and asked for milk, but never received it. Just overall terrible dining experience. If you're going here, just get drinks.",

That should have been enough for us to steer clear, but we figured how bad could it be? We arrived at 1:30 PM on a Saturday for brunch and ordered by 2.

21,,3/5/2018,14,,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",Channelle R.,130,3.0,55,The beer options were pretty great but that's about where the greatness ends. The Fried Chicken Sandwich has no seasoning and severely lacked flavor... thank goodness for the waffle fries. I would also recommend not coming for the cocktails. The Strawberry Cucumber Fizz was terrible. I didn't want to even risk ordering another drink. I give 3 stars for the chill vibe and we had a nice lounge section.,
22,,2/13/2018,208,,"Lake Worth, FL",Lester E.,41,4.0,44,"This  place has an awesome concept. POUR YOUR OWN BEER! Charged by the fl oz. The selection was good. The beer list they had on the tables and on tap weren't the same so it threw me off. But anyhow, the concept is pretty fun. Just look and see which beer you want, and then put your card that is given to you and then pour as much as you'd like. Pretty cool. Didn't have any of the food but looks pretty good.",1
23,,8/5/2018,158,,"Phoenixville, PA",Timmy W.,0,3.0,3,Good beer selection however the aesthetic is trying too hard. Some menu items were very well done such as the French toast and the fries while others lacked flavor such as the eggs Benedict. The place is very loud so it's hard to have a conversation. All in all it was okay and the prices were good for the food but it probably isn't worth going with better options in the area.,

25,,12/9/2017,97,,"Brooklyn, NY",Julia W.,62,3.0,125,"Arcade like atmosphere where you use a beer card to fill up on beer. Buyer beware (!!) - prices add up very quickly. Be sure to read the price per ounce before purchasing. I made the mistake of not checking and paid $2 an ounce for a sour. Pretty ridiculous price if you ask me. I can go to a craft brewery and get a sour for half the cost I paid at Randolph. My girlfriend and I ordered the jerk poboy and corn. The jerk lacked flavor, think very peppery pulled chicken covered in cheese. The corn tasted better, but I'm not sure we'll be back with such high prices.",1
26,1,10/30/2017,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Adam H.,1,2.0,3,"A disappointment. I've been to the Nolita location and it was fine. The new Dumbo Heights location is far from OK. The music was blasting so loudly that everyone had to shout at each other to attempt any conversation. Constantly yelling ""WHAT?"" back and forth is not my idea of fun. I really think that 50% of the problems here could be fixed by turning down the music.Food Pricing: HighExample: $10 Pretzel / $11 Shishito Peppers / $17 BurgerBad environment to be eating in even if the food prices were more reasonable.The vibe of this place (primarily caused by the noise level)  is kind of well...stressed out, and promotes anxiety. The beers are listed on a chalkboard with no price but their ABV%. I asked for assistance and chose the highest ABV beer so I could drink up and get out. The prices are on little screens at the taps, difficult to see and understand (until after you've filled your glass).  After filing the standard sized glass my cost was $23 for a beer ($1.55 per fl oz.) and nothing special either. If I wanted a $23 beer I would have gone to ........ um.......well......NOWHERE! There are no $23 beers to be had anywhere in NYC, including the top hotel bars and lounges. The ordering, fulfillment, and payment process is confusing and unorganized. The employee who assisted me tried to offer me something to compensate for the rip-off beer, but I couldn't hear a word he said and decided to cut my losses and leave.",6

Again we did the unlimited drink with 1 main course for everyone when it finally came time to order server told us the lobster roll was +6$ because ""you know lobster is expensive "" whatever granted but that should be stated on the menu which it was not and he said they had ran out of shrimp and grits....howwww?  He said a whole 8 top ordered it...still didn't add up but whatever.

Veggies were fresh and seasoned well. We also ordered mac and cheese and sweet tots.

The beer is also expensive (I know about craft beers) however, when you are pouring your beer, just be cognizant that your beer may be up to $20.00! Here's now it works: At Randolph, you get a beer card from the bartender so you basically pay with that card using their electronic beer dispensing system.

Yes, it was the first night and, yes, it was packed, but you could tell there was so much potential for this bar/brewery to be whatever you want it to be: all day brunch with friends, a place to take my parents, perfect date spot; etc. The beers they're brewing on-site are actually delicious...I think there are 7 on tap. If you're into beer, try them all and do it from the Beer ATM. It allows you to taste everything without breaking the bank. I didn't try any of the cocktails, but I know they have them on draft and if they're the same at Nolita and Williamsburg, then they're delicious (and bottomless at brunch). The food is soooooo solid. I NEVER order veggie burgers, but I had to after seeing another table's and it was everything I wanted. Our group also had sweet potato tots, the fried catfish sliders, shrimp tacos and the big ass pretzel and beer cheese. Everything is really really good, and great portions for sharing as a group. Space is cool (probably better when not so crowded). Lots of different areas with different vibes like the beer hall tables, the comfy couches, and the little mezzanine overlooking the tanks. I could picture being here during the day, playing some shuffleboard and having a few beers or after work for dinner with my girls. It's really that versatile of a space. Can't wait to come back!

I probably counted like 2 Black people which is ok. But definitely is different than the Williamsburg location. This Randolph is a self serve. But my friend and I never got up to serve ourselves once lol. I ordered the jerk po boy (I always order the Jerk Po 'Boy it's my safe option here) I guess I really just come here for the unlimited pitchers lol. Anyway, I like the jerk po boy it's juicy with enough spice and comes with season waffle fries can't go wrong with it. My friend didn't really see anything she liked on the menu but she choose to get he shrimp & grits. We ordered a pitcher of the mimosas but my friend didn't care for the mimosas. She's not a big drinker and doesn't like tart tasting drinks. She decided not to drink her mimosa. I didn't care for the mimosas either like that but stuck with them. I can tell they didn't use sparking wine or champagne. My friend then wanted to get sangria but our server which was this cute Spanish guy with long hair (forgot his name, he was really helpful & patient) told my friend that they had no sangria. So my friend could only choose between the strawberry cucumber, the lime, cucumber & tequila, and 2 others I forgot. I told her off the back the strawberry cucumber is nasty as hell. I made the mistake buying a pitcher of it at the Randolph's in Williamsburg and struggled trying to finish (I don't waste liquor...or at least try not to) anyway our server let us sample them...and yeah they were all nasty lol. But I really appreciated him letting us sample. So we just cancelled the unlimited. My friend got her shrimp & grits and didn't like it at all. It tasted bland...the grits taste Ike nothing ...we didn't taste the shrimp. She told our server to give her the jerk po' boy after that. All and all the place is nice and roomy. It's family friendly as well. There's a bunch of beers on tap. It's just not a ""sex and the city"" type place where you go to be seen and meet single people lol...that's probably more so Williamsburg or Nolita (even tho I've never been to the Nolita restaurant but I've been in the area plenty) anyway this Randolph's is good for first dates (they have a shuffle board and some other cool games to play, meeting up with a group of friends/coworkers/family, a quick drink and bite to eat. Will I be back to this particular Randolph's? yea but as family unit. I'll take my single friends to Williamsburg or Nolita.",

Off of a recommendation, myself and group ordered a couple drinks. One persons drink came out and then no one else's drinks ever came. We managed to flag down the waiter who said he thought we had our drinks. I'm not sure how because he never came back. We canceled the remainder of our order and paid for the one drink. Unfortunately, then, for that one drink, we were charged an incorrect higher amount.",
