0,Stalina G.,"New York, NY",31,16,1,4.0,7/11/2018,Great place for quick beer and snack. Our go-to place during summer late evenings. The selection of beers and food is great and the prices are right.,,,
1,Alessandro F.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,5/28/2018,"The place and food is nice, but I had a bad experience. Unfortunately the bouncer/owner didn't do his job, an aggressive bum came close to the outside table on a summer night, the bouncer/manager asked the bum to leave by saying: ""don't make me call the cops"" and going back in. Obviously the bum stayed there and she eventually threw objects around, hitting my hand as I was sitting on the outside table. I'm a pianist, that doesn't feel great - my hand is blue. Then they called the cops and asked me to press charges, but cops never showed up for a while and I left to attend my aching hand. I think they should make sure their customers are safe in a more efficient way. On a side note, they didn't offer an extra drink or made a discount to me on the Check. So they really handled it meh.",2,2,
2,Vee R.,"New York, NY",475,72,65,3.0,7/2/2018,"Good lunch specials, burger fries and beer for $14. We went on a sunday and the service was a little slow but we didn't mind it",,,
3,Stephanie J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,60,58,4.0,4/27/2018,"I've had a good experience each time I've come here. Its definitely a cool hang out spot to grab a drink and bite with friends or alone. I typically get a burger with fries---The burgers are always juicy and well cooked. They make a really good lamb burger on a nice brioche bun.They also have other decent menu items like ribs, salmon, and steak but I rarely get those things. As for drinks, they are always good. I love their red sangria---its tasty and has the perfect amount of alcohol. I would say the menu is reasonably priced for a bar in upper Manhattan. I like the atmosphere there, it is never too crowded and if you are into sports, you could possibly catch a game playing on one of their TVs.",,,
4,Lauren E.,"Lewiston, ME",70,1,0,2.0,10/27/2018,"Food (meat) was undercooked and raw, despite specificity it should be well done. One side dish was forgotten, and they brought us the wrong check at the end. If one of these things happened on their own, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But all three in one short visit discourages me from returning.",,,
5,Sid B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",53,8,6,4.0,4/26/2018,"Great spot in Hamilton heights. Staff, drinks and of course the BEER simply amazing! Kyle the bartender very courteous & friendly. A must check out!",,,1
6,Robi O.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/19/2018,This is use to be my favorite bar. Use to be a very chill and laid back place to grab a drink and listen to  cool music. Now the music sucks and it's a bore to stay. BRING BACK THE MUSIC!!,,,
7,Kathleen S.,"New York, NY",26,409,63,3.0,4/28/2018,"The waitstaff is delightful.  They make the place.  The fish and chips were quite good and my bf was happy with his lamb burger.  The bathroom sink overflowed, they had no coffee and I didn't feel like our table got a good cleaning---so maybe won't jump back on a train to come 50 blocks uptown, but I really appreciated the smiles on the servers faces and the attention to detail when taking our orders.",,,

Updated review","Every Tuesday is this new jazz session from 8-11pm. Its perfect for dates, group of friends or a solo excursion into town with style. This is a true celebration of the essence of Harlem and Hamilton heights. Harlem that's been known for decades of jazz do not have enough of it in its millennial state and since history tend to repeat itself we are going to learn you about jazz if you don't know :).About The Music:I believe music can communicate an entire past to the present. Proof was in "" that old feeling"" song from 1938, vogued and reused in 1952, play in my visit at the Draft House in 2017. I received this song without hearing the titled or  lyrics but the content later on explained why I cried to it without having a clue what and where it was referring to. Even without having a clue who made it and how it came to life or anything it touched me deeply.  But the language of music communicates to us like any other language. The song was a speech in a language I understand musically. It  was a perfect song for the moment and in sink with the happenings. Bringing  me joy I didn't  know was in that form.So yes draft house tuesday. One thing you are doing right for sure. Keep it jazzy. Spoiling NYC with such a large orchestra  that player on the bench waiting for  their turns like on the nfl. After all it's a draft related :) St Nicholas legendary pub was my bar next door and jazzy iconic venue landmark I went to often to listen to jazz ( a place every major jazz icon played at when they started)  for 8 years and it was closed. Now I have hope the jazz torshe can be carried here if you try. About Food:The new angus burger is with a higher quality Patty why smaller and you now have lunch specials that includes taco it cesar Salad or Angus burger or veggie burger with a beer for just $14 all together. Perfect for corporate, bankers, teachers, workers around at lunch. Yaaas I'm liking that special. I tried it 3 times and was great.",,,
9,Peter K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",558,633,2140,4.0,6/12/2017,"I am constantly looking for new places by Columbia that I can escape to after work and: 1) not be bothered by undergrads (no offense); 2) has a good vibe; and 3) has potential outdoor seating. The Draft House became my recent favorite.Located just a few minutes up (or about 10 minutes down) from Columbia is this chill spot, related to Anchor Wine Bar a few blocks away. There are seasonal happy hour beers on tap and decent snacks (the fries are good and the quesadillas aren't too bad either) although their menu selection has apparently decreased over time (no more pizzas). There is usually ample outdoor seating (although being situated next to a smokeshop tends to have its down sides). The clientele is usually very chill and friendly and so are the staff. Service can be a little slow when the place gets busy but it's usually forgivable.  The music selection can vary as it seems to be coming from someone's personal collection. The last time I was here Ace of Base and 90s Madonna came on one after the other. LOL.Cheers.",1,1,
10,Yanill P.,"Manhattan, NY",579,353,1281,4.0,9/27/2016,"Cool place! I went on a Sunday and they had football on. Additionally, they have Sunday specials during NFL games. Happy hour from 4-7pm which included $5 wines, well drinks, sangria, beer, etc.. We ordered a couple of Jalapeño Margaritas which were not on happy hour. They were deliciously spicy! Cocktails average around $11. They have outdoor seating and the decor is unique. Service was on point. The wings were actually better than I expected. However, the Margherita Pizza was disappointing. I plan on returning soon to try other items on the menu. Thumbs up :)",8,4,7
11,Darshan M.,"New York, NY",116,37,15,4.0,4/25/2017,"Every neighborhood needs a Draft House! Walked in here on a rainy Tuesday night , craving a veggie burger and something unexpected. I was not disappointed !Ambience- cute, relaxed, and sports bar-like but also romantic with candles. To me , it represents the perfect date spot, also because it's right around the corner from where I live ;) People seem quite friendly in this bar. It they also give you your space if you'd like it. Tonight I didn't, and instead made friends with a lovely teacher-cum-poet who bought me a beer ! Food - I had a pretty competent veggie burger with fries. Not bad, did the job. Also had a delicious IPA with my meal, named savannah I believe. My partner in crime for the evening was enjoying her fish tacos and her mule . The other diners near me were having grilled fish and a steak, both of which looked quite competent too. I'd have liked to have seen some of the advertised pizzas floating around the restaurants but sadly, I didn't see them on the menu. Hopefully they will have pizza the next time I go thereService - nice, friendly, prompt, attentive, and (importantly) cute ! A+ for AJ and TaylorValue - The prices are fair, they have a happy hour which I missed but I paid about 25$ for my beer and veggie burger (with tip) which I was very pleased with. I'm stuffed as I'm writing this! In conclusion, if you are in Harlem I would highly recommend you go here because the people and ambience are lovely!",3,,
12,Stephanie L.,"North Hollywood, CA",4,11,2,4.0,12/11/2017,I have been to The Draft House a few times and have enjoyed my experience both times. Everyone was very friendly and the selection of food and drinks is great. The most recent time I got the lamb burger which was okay but I wish it had a little more flavor in the burger. The mule I got to drink was large and strong which was great! Our server/bartender was Colin and he was hilarious! Good place to go with friends for a drink or a quick bite.,,,
13,Johanna R.,"Manhattan, NY",54,65,38,3.0,8/12/2018,"I like coming here because its like a fancy beer place. I know that sounds silly but the outside seating is sooo freaking chick. I went here the night after my birthday two years ago and amazingly there was outdoor seating ( it was a December) so you know it was cool. Also, i go through beer phases and the beer is good here but I'm a little annoyed I never left this place drunk. I mean thats how i rate beer places by the level of intoxication. Please don't judge me hahaha. I had the pizza from here because i cant eat heavy food and drink beer. Beer is very filling. Ummm I dont know this is always my last resort in the case I cant find anywhere else to go. I have never sat inside so maybe its a different atmosphere and perhaps I can give them a better rating. No music or at least music I can relate to a bit. The neighborhood is going through gentrification so a lot if things are changing. So i understand that they wont be playing bachata here lol . Its a lil boring here for me its more of a beer and talk draft house.",,,
14,Tee G.,"Hudson County, NJ",97,99,72,5.0,2/2/2017,Great little neighborhood spot.  Soft shell tacos were delicious as was this wonderful passion fruit margarita.  The service was good and the complementary sample of the soup of the day (carrot) was absolutely delicious! Two thumbs up!,,,
15,John S.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,22,15,5.0,3/23/2018,"I love Nate!  He came over and introduced himself, checked on us and wasn't even our server. Food was good and decently priced. Go for the bottle. It's the best value.",,,
16,amanda n.,"Cincinnati, OH",8,24,11,1.0,11/5/2017,I ate here a few months ago and the pizza was absolutely disgusting. I won't come here again,1,3,
17,Katie J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,7/1/2018,"Cute spot. Food isn't bad but it's ridiculously overpriced for what you get. Service was ok, cocktails weren't bad (but slow) and moderately priced for NYC.",,,
18,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,8/31/2015,"Came here twice, both on a Saturday evening.Ambience: Decor is rustic and simple. Crowd was diverse in race and mostly below 40. They play 80s and 90s music after midnight.Service: Waiters and bartenders were attentive and polite. If you're not sure what beer to get, they will gladly let you have a taste. They only have one bathroom so the line can get pretty long.Food and drinks: They have over 10 beers on tap in three different size. We had the risotto and mozzarella balls and it was delish. We also had the bison burger with fries and it was quite juicy.Overall, good addition to the neighborhood.",1,,1
19,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2209,8239,4.0,5/11/2015,"This is a newly opened place so it's still a work in progress, but I like most of what I see.Came here with friends to scope it out as a potential venue for beer club but it's kind of small so I don't think that would work out.  However, if you're in the area and want a quick bite and some great beer, this is a good place.First, I love the decor.  Lots of wood and metal and cool lights.  Very nice, comfortable vibe.  With the windows in front open, it really gives the place a warm, welcoming feel.  The beer list is very good.  They have something for everyone.Food is currently limited.  We had the suppli and salted codfish.  They were out of patatas, which was disappointing and the pizza oven isn't installed yet, so food options aren't the broadest at this point, but we liked what we had.   There's a sign with an arrow that says ""beer garden"" but that's just for display.  There's no garden.  I think having that is a bad idea because inevitably everyone asks ""where's the garden?"" and to respond ""there isn't one"" is kind of a lame answer.  Take it down.Our server was very nice.I'd definitely go back here again.  It's a pretty quick trip from midtown, although it's an uphill hike from the A/B/D trains.  However, it's very close to the 1 train (although that's a slower trip)Thumbs up!",5,,4
20,Isabel V.,"New York, NY",73,57,56,4.0,3/9/2017,In the past I didn't have a great experience with ordering from here but when my fiancé and I enjoyed a happy hour and dinner.

21,Rosa C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",44,3,5,4.0,10/2/2017,"My family has been in this neighborhood for about 50 years. We welcomed and DIDNT welcome the change of gentrification. This bar was once what it is now NOT, it changed from offering completely truly Italian food (brick oven pizza) TO NOW MEXICAN FAST FOOD - tacos.. yada yada WHAT makes me come back?? The people that run the place! AJ is the best bartender, an epitome of hospitality and professionalism... the love child of Woody, Sam and Carla ALL IN ONE!!!!",,1,
22,Saige D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",148,32,6,4.0,8/2/2017,"I love the Draft House! I've been here multiple times with friends. The drinks are delicious, the food is great, and I love the outdoor seating. They have decent happy hours. I go some days and grab a sangria for just $5. It's getting four stars because I think it's over priced. I go in and expect to pay at least $35 if I want a drink and meal. But i do recommend the Draft House!",2,,1
23,Mariel P.,"Brooklyn, NY",440,118,774,3.0,1/28/2016,"Nice spot especially the way the bar rolls around and you can sit at the end of the bartenders side, but this place can be pricey. I went for happy hour on a Wednesday and only wine (including sangria) and certain cocktails qualify for happy hour--not the beers which most people come in for especially being that it is ""the draft house"". The sangria wasn't the best which I was expecting being an American (I think!) bar and the food can be pretty pricey. Also, my partner ordered his favorite bourbon which came in a very small glass, 5/8 of the way full (to be very exact) and it had no foam as it should when it's mixed so it did not taste great.The beer was good although I do wish if we're part of the HH.",4,2,3
24,Maureen L.,"Manhattan, NY",235,93,3,3.0,3/30/2018,"I so miss the days when Draft House served pizza. The beer selection is still great, so I like coming by here to have a drink. However, their burgers and other food offerings are just fine, not great. Their pizzas were amazing - there was a salami one I used to get, and I could put the entire thing away in one sitting, with several beers. I would give five stars if they brought back the pizza.",,,
25,Kat J.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",40,5,2,5.0,5/8/2016,"Have been here a few times in the evening for drinks -  they offer a nice selection of beers on tap but I don't consider myself a regular or ever really compelled to write a review. BUT,  I just had brunch for the first time today here and was pleasantly surprised! The salmon benedict and the waffles were really yum and looked beautiful. The service was great (everyone was very friendly and attentive) and there was no wait to be seated. If you're looking for a less crowded alternative to the Grange for brunch, give this a try!",,,1
26,Wendy M.,"New York, NY",64,47,6,4.0,6/25/2017,Great addition to a neighborhood that was sorely in need of a pub where you could go in and watch a baseball game.  Had excellent sangria and delicious fish tacos....will definitely be back.,1,,
27,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",335,287,1018,4.0,10/7/2016,"I recently went to The Draft house for happy hour after I've passed it a few times walking from At the Wallace to the bus. I love the way it looks with the distressed wood and white tiles. The open windows with chairs lining the inner and outer counters added to the open airy feel.  Happy hour includes $5 beer (Oktoberfest when we went), wine and sangria plus $6 well drinks. Happy hour normally is between 4-7 but extends to 9pm on Wednesdays or whenever a football game is on. Our bartender was incredibly friendly and willing to give us small tries of the beers before buying. He was very attentive but not to the point of being overbearing.  He never let an empty glass sit there long which is always appreciated. I will definitely try this place out for a bite to eat soon. All of the food that was served around us looked tasty but I already had dinner plans.",3,1,2
28,Antoine P.,"New York, NY",4,27,1,2.0,8/11/2017,Had dinner here with friends. Ambiance and service was great. The problem is the food. Ordered the Fish N Chips which came with fries and my friend ordered the Calamari. Never saw and ate food this oily. I understand that our food had to be fried but tons of oil were left on the food making it very unappetizing. The taste and flavor of the food were also very mediocre. Serving size was quite small as well. Had to order a pizza down the block. Will only come back for drinks not food.,,,
29,Andrew H.,"WOODSIDE, NY",149,38,25,5.0,10/24/2016,"Came here with some friends this past weekend. We were looking for a good way to start our evening before heading out onto the town. The Draft House was somewhere we've been wanting to check out and it was well worth it. Although at 1030pm on Saturday it had a dead vibe to it, we stuck around and grabbed a seat at the bar.A rather large beer list, as they should considering it's The Draft House, me and my friends opted for their specialty cocktails and they didn't disappoint. I have a version of a Moscow Mule which was spot on. I tasted my friends cocktails as well and every single one was delicious. The bartender was very friendly and catered to our needs. When we called it a night and asked for our bill, the bartender gave us a shot on the house, which is always appreciated (and good for an extra star in this Yelp review).Didn't get a chance to try the food, though everything sounded really good and affordable too considering the higher end look that this bar has. The music was also spot on, which makes the environment that much better. In an area where more and more bars are popping up, this will be added to my list of go-to's when I'm up in Harlem.",2,1,
30,Vincent L.,"Orlando, FL",48,75,10,4.0,2/26/2016,"I stumbled on this place by accident.  I live in the neighborhood and it's probably only one of several trendy restaurants in the area.  Ambience is very relaxing, rustic, and ""homey.""  Their food is pretty good. I like their happy hour (reasonably priced well drinks).Overall, staff is very nice. :)  It is definitely becoming one of my neighborhood favorites! I highly recommend it.",,,
31,Adam S.,"Irvine, CA",564,4,0,1.0,4/5/2017,"I live around the corner from Draft House and I so badly wanted to this chic, sexy place to be my local hangout. However every time I visit this establishment I am disappointed with their drinks. Every drink I've ordered at Draft House has been very watery. I've even asked the bar tenders if the booze is watered down. I have a hard time spending my money at a business who charges the same price for drinks as other NY bars but skimps on the booze. Howevery their food is pretty great. Again, I really wanted this place to be my local hangout but I just can't bring myself to spend my money there.",3,1,

34,Paul D.,"Manhattan, NY",3,65,1,4.0,4/11/2017,It's tragic that this place stopped serving pizza. It was one of the top 3 pizzas in the city. The problem is that there are allot of midwestern transplants here who have never had real pizza before and compare it to dominos. They give 2 stars becuase theres no dipping sauce. I've seen the same thing happen on yelp with a pizza place in Brooklyn that for almost a century has been highly regarded. Great beer selection.,2,,
35,Kasi K.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,98,14,3.0,11/26/2016,"I've been here a couple of times now, both times I've had a decent experience. It's usually decently busy in there but I've always been able to get a seat in the back, where it's super cozy especially in the colder months. The servers are very friendly, and you can get samples of beers before committing to one so I can definitely appreciate that. The menu is rather extensive, though I like to get their pizza because it's quite good. I didn't expect that from this restaurant! My husband keeps ordering different stuff and he hasn't been disappointed yet. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and it's a good spot for watching sports games.",,,
36,Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",214,279,121,2.0,6/27/2015,"Not a huge fan.PROS:They give you samples of the beer and the wine. So you can try as many as possible before placing your actual drink order, if you don't mind being annoying. I do, therefore i only tried 2 and settled for the latter one because I was annoyed, I can imagine my waitress.They have pretty good food. I ordered the burger and it was pretty perfect, fries not so much. 1 pitcher of beer, 2 normal beers, one wine, 2 drinks, a shot, wings, and a burger - $90 bucks. Not too bad.CONS:The waitress was pretty nice but it wasn't the best service that I've had. She was all over the place and some of the things I said were followed as regarding my order [it could have been the kitchen not her]If you order a drink and do not like it [even if they recommend it] they do not do a courtesy switch. That is beyond me. I ordered a drink she recommended but i hated the proseco aftertaste it was nasty. Apparently they have a rule: ""you have to drink every drink we bring to the table."" I didn't like this. Thankfully the person I was with drank it for me. No pizza oven yet, OTHER:its an okay place to just chill and drink beer if you are not looking for anything else. IT had a nice ambiance and the bathroom was impeccable",3,,

They also have plenty of other drinks readily available including a sangria.Yes the pizza oven is open now. The pizza crust needs a bit of improvement but overall the food here is quite good - burgers, fish, pizza toppings, fries - all very good and make a for a good lunch or dinner. Great addition to the area. I'll be back!",,,
40,Yvonne P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,39,22,4.0,7/25/2015,"The bartenders and staff get five stars for their friendly attentive service. The beer and wine selection is quite varied for both on tap and bottles. The sangria is delicious! There is an interesting cocktail menu but the prices for those are a tiny bit steep. I've only had the food once, a deep fried grilled cheese, but will definitely be back to try the brick oven pizza and explore the Italian-American driven menu further. Honestly, knowing that the same people own Anchor restaurant across the street make me more inclined to have food at the restaurant and continue to turn to Draft House to enjoy a few drinks with friends. Overall, The Draft House delivers a good time whether you go alone or with a group!",1,,1
41,Mel C.,"Manhattan, NY",56,42,21,3.0,4/30/2015,"Today is the soft opening. The layout of the place is clean, modern, and inviting. The beer selection is lovely with about 20 beers on draft. They offer beer by the half liter, full liter, or pitcher. They also have a small wine selection as well as a cocktail list. The kitchen has yet to open, but once it is I will update my review. I'm sure the food will be promising as it is the same owners as Anchor Wine Bar down the block, and I have enjoyed many meals there.

Rustic decor.Service was absolutely awful for a Friday evening and it was slow at the time I went. We sat down and order drinks and the server never came back until we signaled. The server thought we weren't going to order food and didn't even bother to ask. Another server delivered the food and argued condiments were given without even checking. It's irritating when it's slow and the people working go to work just to socialize. Service is likely better at the bar. Lazy servers. The only tables getting decent service was a table (1 table) near where they were socializing.Way too many options in Manhattan to keep going here. TYRON PUBLIC HOUSE is way better. Amazing food and awesome service and ambiance not to mention a better selection for draft, bottled and cocktails.

Updated review","I went back here recently and although the sangria seems to have gotten stronger, the food has definitely gotten worse. I had a burger and fries and both were awful. The fries were barely cooked and were super light in color and soggy and the burger was disgusting and super small. The bun completely dwarfed the patty, at first I thought they forgot to even put the burger on. I can think of many better places for a burger that won't cost $13. If you live in the area and just want to watch a game and have a drink, then it's still decent for that but I definitely don't recommend the food.",,1,
53,Joshua M.,"Manhattan, NY",172,27,3,3.0,6/18/2017,"Once upon a time, Draft House slung the best personal sized pizzas in the neighborhood, worth every penny. However, nowadays they sport a shortened menu. The last few meals there have been progressively worse, culminating in a stale, refrigerator-infused flavored, over-priced slice of cheese cake. Still great for the beer and drinks though!",,,

56,Michela W.,"Silver Spring, MD",341,9,0,1.0,5/14/2016,"No MAM.  Just moved into the neighborhood and wanted to grab some easy protein and veggies somewhere close. Walked in and had to ask someone already dining to see their menu after not being acknowledged by anyone.  I would've left but I was just getting over a horrible a viral infection and had barely any energy. I order the ribs with a large mixed green salad. The ribs were supposed to be from the grill and I'm pretty sure they meant George Foreman knock off because besides a slight drying out, there wasn't a grill mark in sight let alone any grilled flavor.  And then these ""grilled"" ribs were literally drenched in bbq sauce that I'm sure came out of a industrial sized can.  Yum! But let's talk about the cut of meat because there wasn't even a slight trimming of fat or anything.  I've had cleaner cuts of ribs from Friday's on a drunken night in college.  Very Cro-magnon. And then my lovely mixed green salad which was actually a mixture of spoiled and fresh arugula accompanied with 2 cherry tomatoes, each cut in half of course, and 1 of which had a white creamy substance all about the body.  And the dressing!! Nothing compliments that peppery taste of Arugala like basic EVOO and black pepper.  Yum again.  NOT. I can't imagine that I'll ever be going back.  So disappointing.",,1,
57,Jonathan M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,2,5.0,2/7/2016,"Great Place! Amazing Staff!I recently had brunch here and everything was borderline perfect. Our server was Julia who was very attentive to our needs and suggested The New Yorker breakfast pizza with smoked salmon and cream cheese (a must try). Damon was our bartender and his energy really set the atmosphere. Great drinks, just the right amount of alcohol, and beers are always phenomenal.Funny thing that during my visit I was the victim of debit card fraud. Someone made atm withdrawals in a downtown bank while I was enjoying brunch. A police report was made and the bank refunded the money thanks to the owner Fabrizio who supplied the police the video footage of my whereabouts during the transactions. I want to say thank you and recommend this fine establishment to anyone and everyone!!!",1,,2

It wasn't crowded but there was a good number of people there and the vibe was very chill.I got a couple beers and was very happy with my selections. I was hungry so I decided to get a margherita pizza. That wasn't the best decision, while it was large for the price ($12) it wasn't cooked very well and there were like 2 pieces of basil on top...All in all it's a pretty decent place, I'll definitely be back for a glass of wine or a beer but I probably won't get food.",2,,1

The setup is cool with an extra long bar and the beer selection was excellent. Got the brick oven pizza which was excellent. Also liked that they had liters and half liters of beer in steins. The bartenders were good also. Only thing that isn't great is the back seating area is secluded and awkward, so get a spot up front. Will deff be back for the pizza and beer. Nice seeing more and more spots pop up in Upper Manhattan.",,,

Now call me crazy but if I'm paying for my food and I'm not happy then hell yea im going send it back ... guess I should have ate it because what I got back was pure lettuce and what seemed to be scraps from the bottom of the deep fryer ... this was a complete joke . I've been coming to this restaurant since it first open. I'm not here for cooks that think a  customer shouldn't send their food back if it's not to their liking .. I like spending money in my neighborhood... happy I don't have to travel but this was  a joke,,,

63,Arielle R.,"New York, NY",58,21,9,1.0,5/29/2015,"I live in the neighborhood and met a group of friends here after work on a Friday night.  Ordered the fish and chips. I kid you not, the ""fish"" in the ""fish and chips"" is 3 fish sticks that look and taste like they came out of the frozen food aisle at Pathmark. Cost $15. Absurd. As if the food wasn't bad enough, the waitress came up to our table of about 10 people or so and told us we needed to be quieter. It's a BAR.  On a FRIDAY NIGHT. You're called The DRAFT HOUSE. The music they played was louder than any of us, but for some reason she felt the need to single us out. We were the only people of color in there at that time so...draw your own conclusions. Anyway, one of my friends ordered chicken which never came. When, after about 30 minutes of waiting he pointed out to her that he didn't get his food, instead of saying ""Oh, I'm so sorry about that, I'll see what's going on,"" our waitress blamed it on the cooks by saying ""Oh they probably got confused, you know how it is, English probably isn't their first language."" In a neighborhood full of Spanish-speaking folks maybe you don't want to disparage Spanish-speaking folks to a table of ethnic minorities who, for all you know, may also speak Spanish. I called her out on it and, after giving us our check (which she first had to fix because it contained an extra item that we hadn't ordered), she told us not to come back. Cool. Hadn't planned on it. If I'm ever in the mood for microwaved fish sticks and offensive comments, I can get both a lot cheaper elsewhere.",10,3,

Good selection of drinks and love love the pizzas. I'm slowly working through the menu. Cesar salad is hit or miss (the chicken on there is delicious), fish and chips were ok, rice balls are good if you eat them there (not delivery), Mac and cheese is super rich and delicious, and I've yet to have a bad pizza there.

66,Stevie R.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,17,4,1.0,6/1/2015,"I went there last night with my roommate and friends. The service wasn't that great. Had to ask the waiter several times just for water. The waiter came back to me to ask what my order was 10 minutes after I placed it. My roommate ordered the fish and this morning he is puking his guts out. He said it was the fish and wasn't feeling to hot on his way to work. My friends boyfriend ate there the other day and his credit card number was stolen from one of the staff members and was being used in Brooklyn where he never goes. Best advice is, first impression is a lasting impression. I believe the owner was there. Instead of seeing how his clients are doing he was more concerned playing on his phone.  Yea I am not coming back.",2,3,
67,Camillie M.,"Delray Beach, FL",191,11,13,2.0,3/15/2016,"I'm hesitant to give one star. My brother knew right away he wanted tangy wings and ordered with the waitress. She nodded somewhat confused(she didn't realize there were tangy wings on the menu), he repeated the order to her and asked if it's available today, after she glanced at the menu she said ""oh yes sorry"". I waited to order a cocktail, my boyfriend got a Lagunitas on draft which he says was delicious, my brother an old fashioned, which he says was watered down. I was going to give it a chance but the bartender was eating pizza at the bar the whole time which turned off my mood for a cocktail even more. We ordered two pizzas one sounded delicious with potatoes and sausage but the potatoes ended up being chopped French fries and the crust had the burnt scraped off of it. The other was with prosciutto and walnuts  it was pretty weak, so close to being good but no crisp whatsoever and again somewhat scraped. The best thing we ordered was my Lamb burger cooked to order came at a perfect medium- the fries though were extremely lacking. The best description I could give: somewhat crispy, greasy cardboard. I won't come backHere but might consider ordering a lamb burger to goNo fries sub salad. Oh by the way, she forgot the wings and when we mentioned it to her she was extremely confused and did not remember the first conversation my brother had with her when we sat. She wasn't too happy that she had to add it to our order it was really weird. My bro and bae like them a mildly sweet orange marmalade- too vinegary for me.",,,
68,Chrissy E.,"Manhattan, NY",198,50,4,2.0,10/17/2016,"Food is inconsistent. Delivery experiences have been subpar (one time, for instance, the hamburger we ordered was inedible and the dessert was stale/spoiled). Rude service over the phone when they refused to refund us or help in any way. Have since had the pizza again which, while fair in terms of taste, crust, and ingredients, was also not the best in the neighborhood. I believe the owners of TDH also own or oversee Anchor Wine Bar, where we've had a great experience and truly appreciate the food. NOTE: I previously posted the above information after having given TDH the benefit of the doubt many times, and subsequently received a Yelp message from either an employee or a supporter of theirs harassing me for this assessment. Very bizarre. Last I checked, this was a website for reviews and it is generous to give an establishment multiple chances. For the record, we are native New Yorkers who know good pizza and good food overall, and we are very welcoming to local businesses that care for their community.",,,

Your choices are liter or half liter or pitcher. Bartenders was nice and friendly. I will go back and try this place again, to try the food.",1,,

75,Nara A.,"Manhattan, NY",71,12,47,4.0,9/26/2015,"This is a great place to grab a beer and catch-up with friends. It's located on Broadway which is close to the subway nearby. The place is relatively small but they've utilized each space they could, so there is ample room to seat at the bar, table seating, and outside seating during the warmer months. Ambiance is laid back and not too noisy which is great. They play mellow trendy music such as The Fray and Coldplay which isn't very loud and enhances a relaxed atmosphere. The beer selection is great. My fiance is a fan of IPAs and he found what he liked. I, on the other hand, like light fruity beers and they have a decent selection of Belgians and ciders. It doesn't look like they have an extensive food selection. The waiter said they're waiting on permission to turn on their gas to start using their brick oven to make pizzas. Once they start serving pizza, it would really complete their menu. We ordered fried risotto and cheese appetizer which, unfortunately, wasn't good. Our server was extremely attentive and polite. Overall this is a nice addition to the neighborhood since there are maybe one or two more places like this where you can feel that you are (almost) somewhere down-town.",,,

I found it weird that a place named Draft House wouldn't have a TV with the game on but ok, I guess. The food I found was meh. My order didn't wow me but my expectations might have been inflated because the appearance suggested this wasn't going to be your dad's  bar food. Do try the lamb burger.

80,Nidál A.,"Manhattan, NY",23,2,0,4.0,5/23/2016,"So I don't really write a review that often, only when I feel like it. But when I do, I am very critical and very honest. I went to this place today and order the salmon steak (medium). This comes with salad and fries. The salmon was excellent. And certainly for the price of just 15$.  The fries were great, not soggy at all as you would expect them to be at bars. The salad was a bit too salty for me, but then I personally don't really like salt that much so you can ignore that. Great customer service from the gay guy with glasses. He is the host and greets everyone that walks in. Very nice guy. I noticed that this place attracts gay customers ( which I don't have a problem with at all ! ) But maybe you feel uncomfortable seeing guys kiss, I don't know. I arrived there 5 minutes before end of happy hour, which finishes at 7 pm! What I read in another review is that the happy hour is only for wines and sangrias. They have beer too now, but only the seasonal beers, which is 1 kind of beer. It's a black beer, quite bitter and strong. During happy hours they are 5$. ( the sangrias too ) I thought that was quite a pity, only 1 choice, since it is a DRAFT house. I give it 4 stars because the desserts did not have any descriptions ( yes, I am very critical ) and the server couldn't describe to me that clearly either. CONCLUSION: Definitely visit this place. Get the salmon steak. I recommend it. If you come before 7 pm, get the seasonal beer. If not, they have a wide range of draft beers so you're good.",1,,

On a not so busy afternoon? Just ridiculous. And it's not like after waiting for half an hour you're delivered a Minetta Tavern or Shack Shack or even Old Homestead worthy piece of beef. It's just flavorless blah on the plate, with a side of pickles. Seriously, that cow never grazed in the sun or drank from a mountain stream. The waitstaff speaks their own language.  ""Your order will be right up!"" delivered with an innocuous saccharine smile translates into Five more minutes...probably. I have no idea what the problem is between the front of the house and the kitchen all I know is that there is one and its huge.  You, hungry  consumer, will pay for it--with your irritation and more importantly, your hunger.  Stay away.",,1,

The pizza was huge. I couldn't finish it. The organic chicken was well seasoned and the fries were crunchy. They have a good variety of beers available too.

I ordered an A drink which first was served to me in a way that was not appetizing. It looked as if I be drink was sipped by someone else prior to receiving it. This is a favorite drink of mine so I am very familiar with how it should not only look but how it is served. When I mentioned it to the waitress she seemed unenthused to want to make sure I was satisfied. She deferred every question I had to the bartender who didn't even bother to try to rectify the situation. He instead told her to tell me that's how he make them.  I pretty much had to deal with it. It's not as if my table was not spending money members of my party had drinks and food. I couldn't help but feel as if they did not feel like my order or satisfaction was worthy. In short there are way too many other bars in the neighborhood for a fraction of the price, that have more authenticity, with few friendlier and more experience staff. This bar although may have potential have nothing that sets is apart from the rest. Stick with the tried and true restaurants in the neighborhood with staff that care and a more reliable outcome of an enjoyable experience.",,,

The ""risotto balls"" were indeed a mistake they should've 86'd once they found out they ran out of risotto. The balls were essentially a mound of white rice (can't fool me, dudes) with an unmelted cube of mozzarella cheese inside. We were pretty zooted so we ate them anyway. The sauce was pretty good.

The server completely skipped over someone when taking drink orders. He then brought out the wrong drinks to the wrong people. Next, he took our tables order (there were 7 of us) and didn't write it down. Not a problem, except several people at the table wanted the same thing but customized differently (e.g., angus burger with Gorgonzola vs fontina, medium vs medium rare, etc.) He came back to our table 5 minutes after ordering and said that he ""was missing an order from someone"" and started repeating orders but he got half of it wrong. We didn't see him again after that. When our food came out is was by a new server. She dropped off the food, and half of the orders were either missing something or completely wrong. She apologized and then came back to check on us a few bites in. By the time we were done, she brought out a round of shots from the bar that were on the house (we didn't order them). She dropped the check and gratuity was already included on there. When there are this many problems with a table, it would be prudent to remove automatic gratuity, not provide a round of shots. The food, the drinks, service, and environment are not unique enough to bring my friends and I back for a second time. Would not recommend (and will not be recommending) this establishment to others if this is the management's stance.",,,
99,Scott J.,"West Valley City, UT",143,358,3,4.0,7/20/2015,Great bartenders. Good food and fast service. Unfortunately when we visited 7/11/15 they did not have their pizza oven working yet.  Waiting on ConEd to hook up the gas. Excellent beer and cider selection. Will definitely return!,1,2,1
100,Josh T.,"New York, NY",99,5,3,5.0,10/3/2015,Can't say enough good things about this place. I had a birthday get together here and to say the service was accommodating would be an understatement. Shout out to Carlos and Lauren! So friendly and attentive.. Incredible beer and a really cool set up. Run don't walk!,,1,
101,Erin O.,"New York, NY",11,34,0,3.0,11/18/2015,Great drink / beer selection. Fun lively music. The food is tasty but expensive. I would come here more often if the food prices were more reasonable. It has the relaxed bar-like environment so the food prices should be set taking that into account.,,,
102,Josh H.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",19,36,25,2.0,7/17/2015,"First off, I really wanted to like this place...The Draft House has been open for a little bit now and constantly passing it since it's so close to my apartment. One night we decided to go for dinner there to check it out. We went on a Thursday at 7pm and there wasn't too many people so we got a table right away. The guy who showed us to our table was extremely friendly so we were off to a good start....Then, our waitress comes. She brings the menus which are the size of place mats - one side for beers/drinks and the other side for food. Of course I get excited about this because a big menu at a new restaurant gives me plenty of options! However, I stay on the drink side so I can order my huge glass of beer.....HUGE. For $13 it was definitely worth it. After ordering the drinks we flip over to the food portion of the menu. One thing that annoyed me was that I could not find (and I'm usually a pro at this) ANY version of their menu online. I typically don't like to be blind-sided when I dine out because there's nothing worse than getting to a restaurant, looking at the menu for the first time, and there is nothing on it I want to eat. But I can see why there was anything to publish online....THE ENTIRE MIDDLE OF THE MENU WAS CROSSED OFF! The menu was broken down into 3 parts. The entire left, all salads/starts, middle (again, crossed off) was pizza, and right was burgers and other entrees. So basically if I didn't want something fried or a burger than I was screwed. Luckily, it's been a minute since I've had fried fish and I saw a couple pictures of them already through previous reviews. My boyfriend orders a veal hamburger. I think both of us just really wanted the fries. Our waitress at this point was ok. She could have used some more things to do because she was hovering hardcore. Our food came out quickly and it looked pretty good. I really do like how they serve the food on a tray, fries in a wire basket, and the rest of the entree just hangin' out. What I didn't like about it was how cluttered it was: 2 fish patties, 3 sauces, a side salad, and a basket of fries! I felt like I had to eat in sections. Eat my vegetables first because they're taking up a quarter of the plate, then move the basket off the tray because the leftover oil from the salad was everywhere. Move the sauces to cover it up. Move the fish things off each other so all of the grease could be soaked up by the wax paper lining the tray....very complicated for a meal that was that remarkable. Now is the juicy part: My boyfriend finished his veal burger as I was halfway done with my fries and first fish filet but we both had plenty of beer. It still wasn't busy so I didn't feel pressured by a crowd piling at the door or hostess staring at me. However, our wandering waitress comes over to our table while I have my fork and knife in hand and says,""So, can I get you your check or did you need something else?"" I have a half basket of fries, one entire fish filet, and there's two beers that have plenty left in them!!!! At this point I already have tried to ignore her hovering and wiping her nose with her long sleeve t-shirt that she keeps tugging over her hands. This just had me at a loss - sure I want the check, but let me finish this meal and beer before I see how much money I will be wasting...I told her yes I want the check. That last interactions really made this entire experience very poor. Including the extremely loud music and the limited menu...I just am not impressed with this place. A new neighborhood place needs to have a couple things in my opinion and this just didn't do it. Although I think that 99.9% of Harlem Public's staff is scatter brained a bit, they know how to serve a mean burger, a good beer AND other food than burgers. I'll continue to walk the couple blocks to Harlem Public. TIP: fix the issue with that girl asking if I want the check. I know I'm not the only one who doesn't like to hear that unless the meals are finished or I ask for it.",,3,
103,Joe L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,2.0,2/10/2016,"Note: This is a review for an online order through seamless not an actual visit to the establishment (which looks lovely btw). I ordered the Caesar and pollo salad and it was God awful. The dressing was one of worst things I've ever tasted. It tasted really fishy and oily, like they threw some fish oil caps in there. The chicken and bread (no croutons) that came with the salad was really good and the only reason I am giving two stars. I do not think I will order again, I literally threw away all the lettuce and just ate the chicken and bread. I paid 12 dollars for a few pieces of chicken and bread. Horrible.",,,
104,Michael P.,"New York, NY",60,6,1,5.0,12/26/2015,Atmosphere. Check. Delicious food. Check. Generous draft portions. Check. I've found my new favorite spot in the neighborhood! A Brooklyn feel with a Harlem location.,,,
105,Truth N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,4.0,1/28/2016,"I really enjoy this place. I prefer it to, dare I say, Harlem Public (though, I'm a fan). The usual crowd seems down-to-earth and the staff is always friendly. The overall vibe is warm and welcoming. And I've met cool people from all walks of life here, which is a huge plus.  They have an awesome drink list, but the food is a hit or miss. The first time I ordered the long-awaited brick oven pizza, it was soft, doughy and bland. I think it just needed to be left in the oven longer to get that tasty crispiness. Still, it's a nice spot to hang out with friends and meet people from the neighborhood.",,,
106,Ketty B.,"New York, NY",120,3,0,2.0,11/6/2016,"I was taking a walk when I saw this place and I walked in since I hadn't had breakfast. The waiter/bartender that served me was attentive and even made accommodations for me to order a side of scrambled eggs which is not in the menu. Everything was going well until I overheard him speaking with two patrons about a typo on the menu. Instead of it saying Bloody MAry, it said Bloody MOry. His response was that the manager that drafted the menu didn't speak English as a first language and that this person should've asked for someone that ""Speaks English"" to help as he continued to boast about this person not really speaking english I felt uncomfortable.  I wasn't going to say anything but as I was about to leave after paying for my food I confronted him and told him it was unprofessional and very offensive. Menus go through many revisions where the error should have been fixed but to chalk it up to a specific bilingual employee whilst speaking with customers is completely inappropriate. His response was that the patrons are his friends as if that made it okay. If you have a business in such a historically diverse neighborhood, your employees should be more sensitive and show more respect to people of different backgrounds.",,,

Updated review",I used to love this place but today I came in and now they have tv's and rap music playing it completely destroyed the experience. It was relaxing low music before with no distractions and was a very intimate setting but I jmguess they are more interested in getting the local goods in instead of a good clientel.,,,
112,Owen T.,"New York, NY",599,100,19,3.0,8/11/2015,"YAS to the beer selection.

113,Mike V.,"Manhattan, NY",53,12,0,1.0,8/21/2016,"The service at The Draft House is glacially slow at every point of service. The servers are slow to come to the table to take the initial drink order, and if I could give you some advice about ordering drinks there, if you do it, order two at once because you are going to wait a loooooooooooong time for the drinks to show up. You will be able to look into the establishment from your seats on the street and see the bartender slowly plying his trade, and eventually your drinks will filter slowly out to the table. The food for our order took forever to arrive; easily 30+ minutes, which would have been prime drinking time had the server ever made it back to ask us if we wanted more to drink. Our party had 2 gummy-doughed brick oven pizzas, a caprese salad made of flavorless, unripe tomatoes from C-Town, a hot and limp caesar salad, a burger ordered at medium rare that sat in the window til it made medium well, and a half chicken roasted to the point that it was starting to become stringy as jerky. The french fries accompanying the chicken and burger were soggy, limp, and cold in wire baskets that sweated oil onto the plates. One woman in our party was left waiting an extra 20 minutes for a verdure pizza that came out fitting the mushroom pizza's description.The cost of the food at The Draft House makes the poor service and execution seem even more insulting. This is a place that is very handsome looking, and it's a pity that the ownership doesn't take the care to make sure that their business is in competent, efficient hands.",,,

118,Elspeth T.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,4.0,9/18/2015,"The atmosphere is super nice, the staff is amazing, the food is ok. I got a veggie burger which I thought was a bit heavy, very beany and seasoned...but that is just a personal opinion. Im sure there are people who like those kinds of veggie burgers. The fries are yummy. My friend got a regular burger, cooked perfectly, and as she said ""the brioche buns are perfect because they don't fall apart like regular buns"". So one mans ""MEH"" is another's ""YUM""! Defiantly worth a try to see your yourself. I felt like a pain in the ass because I had been here once before and had a beer I liked, but I couldnt remember which one, and kept tasting...tasting...until I re-found it...but the server was super professional and very friendly and put me at ease for what I knew was me being an ultra ""flip-flopper"". So a shout out to the wonderful lady who served me and my friend! I wish I had gotten her name.

Updated review","Taking away one star due to a rather unpleasant experience at brunch this past Sunday.   The food and service were great as usual, however they had a DJ playing club music at an extremely high volume.  I could not even hear my friends speak.   I'm not sure what kind of brunch vibe they are going for, but I prefer a more mellow, chill brunch experience.  I hope they re-think the DJ idea, or at least the volume and type of music played.",1,,

I've only been a handful of times but from my second time there I was greeted by name, which I LOVE! There's some out of the way beers on the menu, but if you tell your bartender what you like to drink, they're really good about matching it to what they have. I'm in love with their little tiny tasting mugs...keep threatening that one is going to end up in my purse! Only had food once twice and it was lovely. Delicious fried rice balls, cod fish balls (which are HUGE!!!) and the wings. No complaints from me....fried food and huge steins of beer are a plus in my book! Will definitely be back...again and again.",,,
122,M J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,6/23/2016,"Very inconsistent. Very good two weeks ago. Lousy this time. Ordered the fried mozzarella & ham sandwich. Doesn't that sound really tasty? It's served with a microscopic portion of tomato sauce for dipping. So, I was expecting a HOT AF sandwich.  Nope. Ice. Cold. Sent it back, asked for it to be heated. Server says, is it cold? A sign that he wasn't listening. So I had to repeat, ""this is cold"".  Cheese sandwich comes back STILL cold. Hard to believe because they have that raging fire burning in the brick oven .... must just be for decoration? Also had the 1/2 roasted chicken. Last week it was nicely browned, hot, and juicy. This time the chicken was luke warm, dry, and not browned.",,,

126,Felipe V.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",1,26,0,1.0,4/9/2016,"I know beer. I brew it. I drink it every style as much as I can sample. I can't even begin to critique this place without damning it for the beer quality. This is not a knock on any brewery dispensed at this place it's draft houses fault. The beer tastes horrible, it is a sanitation issue! I tried many different beers on tap and all where tainted. I believe it is a lack of tap line cleaning and sanitation. The beers all taste like stale moldy bread with chemical after tones. Pure laziness. I wanted to bring to light the issue but the wait service was so quick and unconcerned I would have to make a scene. Shameful. The taps should be cleaned regularly and tested daily. To treat beer this way pisses me off and to serve customers under these great beer names is unimaginable. Disgusting. Do not come here. I will be contacting the breweries being served here to let them know. I have years In the beer industry and have not come across something so fowl in awhile.
