0,Courtney B.,"New York, NY",25,103,92,5.0,8/15/2018,"I've been wanting to try Virginia's for quite some time and finally made it in for NYC restaurant week. This place surprised me with their awesome cocktail menu, great wine list, and delicious menu. I started with a beet salad that was very simple but flavorful. All ingredients were very fresh. We also split an order of shishito peppers that were very good but nothing spectacular. For my entree I had to try the infamous Virginia burger and it did not disappoint. The meat was very tasty, with cheese and caramelized onions it is definitely a must order, especially now that it is available at table service (used to only be available at the bar). My friends ordered the corn ravioli that looked amazing and they raved about. I ordered the dark chocolate mousse for dessert which was light but very tasty. I'm not usually one to order dessert but I would definitely get this again!I am a big fan of Mezcal and tried one of their spicy cocktails that surprised me with how delicious and flavorful it was, packing a nice punch too. The service was great, our waitress was attentive and very nice, and the ambience of the restaurant is casual but nice. I would definitely recommend this spot and there are great bars nearby to go to after dinner. I'm excited to return and try more items at Virginia's!",1,,1
1,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,9/25/2018,"Virginia's is a sweet little spot in the far reaches of Alphabet City. The menu falls comfortably between Italian and contemporary American, with hearty options like meatballs in tomato and mint sauce or chicken milanese tempered by farm-to-table offerings like peach salad. The vibe is classic and unpretentious, with old-school cocktails complementing mustard yellow leather booths and vintage menus carefully lining the walls.I came here with my boyfriend for a nice weeknight dinner, and the crowd was sparse, though it's typically a packed house on weekends. We started with ricotta toast ($10), a perfectly balanced composition of airy whipped cheese, assertively crunchy grilled brioche, and wildflower honey, sprinkled with chili powder and thinly sliced shallots. It's such a simple, well done dish; lightly decadent and faintly sweet.I followed this with the much-lauded burger ($18), a juicy patty on a buttered grilled roll with generous helpings of caramelized onion, melted cheddar, and mustard. This is one of the better burgers I've had in New York, though its juiciness came at a cost-- the wooden board doesn't catch the significant drippings (just switch to a regular plate, my guys!) and I had to track down a waiter for paper towels.My boyfriend's fish dish ($25ish) was well-handled and accompanied, though not a rave. Portion a bit small.Service wasn't super present. Food was quick to come out once we ordered, but hard to get the waiter's attention for ordering and the bill. The decor of the room is nice and I like the lighting, but they seated us in an entirely empty section on a slow night so it felt pretty dead.Overall, this is a lovely, if somewhat pricey, option for a date night or nice parent dinner. It doesn't have that many draws beyond the burger, but you'll find dependable execution and quiet charm in spades should you choose to make the trek.",5,1,5
2,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,9/6/2018,"I happened to wander in during Restaurant Week. Usually I ignore said week; I like ordering what I want and would rather just pay full price to get it, but I was specifically here for the burger and since that was being offered it happened to all work out perfectly.LJ was my bartender and server for the night. She was great and we talked on and off the entire night while I munched and got buzzed. The prix fixe menu started off with a bass poke with radish and scallions. Light and clean, perfect for summer. The famous burger comes with cheddar and an onion marmalade. It was a rich, chewy, buttery, decadent thing. I honestly can't say why it's superior, or what makes it so luxurious, because it's simple with its additions, so I'm thinking it must be the meat itself. I'd like to hear a chef talk about it. The fries were extra but I had to get them, they were super skinny and super crispy. I don't usually order dessert but it came with the meal: a slightly stiff flan that I don't remember much because I was more focused on my drinks anyway.The cocktails were smooth and refreshing, my favorite was a basil gin drink that I wish I could say more about. I took photos of every drink and only realized later they all look very similar and are of no help reminding me which one tasted like what, sorry!The burger at full price is not cheap at $18, and the fries are an additional $9 which I do find to be excessive, regardless of how good that burger is. The pricing is a little all over the place. Overall the burger deserves the hype it's been getting and is worth making the trip out to try.",1,,1

Updated review","The owner/manager in his response implies that I must have been mistaken about portion size, since all proteins are portioned to 8oz.  Given the 3000+ meals I've eaten out over the past 10 years, I'd like to think I can judge 4oz versus 8oz, but I'll let you be the judge, so I'm posting two pictures from my meal.  The first is of the wagyu beef dish.  First, note how its not medium rare, as ordered.  Second, the dish consisted of three cylinders of beef, each being slightly more than 1"" in diameter, and about an inch in height (compare to the size of the fork in the photo, which was a normal dinner fork).  Does that look like 8 oz to you?  It doesn't to me.  And it certainly wasn't filling enough to be 8oz, which is a good amount of protein.  Then look at the pork compared to my wife's hand - she's 4'9"" tall, and doesn't have particularly big hands.  Pork consisted of one cylinder of meat, along with two small pieces off to the side.  I always try to be fair in my reviews, but when called out, I'll always back up my statements with whatever proof I have ..",,,
5,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,150,4.0,6/9/2018,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a weeknight. The place was pretty packed, but we were able to be seated right away upon arrival.We were both pretty hungry, so we decided to split a few dishes:Pork meatballs (3.5 stars): These were actually very good--the flavor was there with the meat and the sauce provided a nice kick--but I thought that they were severely overpriced ($14 for 3 small meatballs).Burger (4.5 stars): The burger is this place's claim to fame and I can definitely see why. Not the biggest patty you've ever seen, but definitely a must-order when you're here.Chicken milanese (4 stars): This dish was a great portion size and was prepared well. Even the arugula it was paired with was fresh and tasty and paired nicely with the chicken.French fries with roasted garlic (3.5 stars): The fries are probably a 3--they were served a bit cold, and the roasted garlic aioli was a solid 4. Overall, this is a cute spot in the East Village that is definitely worth checking out, especially if you're pining for a solid burger. A bit on the pricier side, but the service and atmosphere were great.",3,2,2
6,Kati B.,"New York, NY",77,114,49,5.0,9/23/2018,"We went here with a Gilt city voucher after hearing good things about their food. There weren't a ton of other people eating there but there were people at the other restaurants nearby. I had the Ricotta toast as an appetizer and the burger for my meal. Both were very good! I will definitely return for both in the future, even without a deal.",,,
7,Allison G.,"New York, NY",142,293,141,4.0,12/6/2017,4.5****Came here with a gilt deal and it was one of he best meals we've had! It's a bit of a walk from the train though but totally worth it! For appetizers we had the steak tartar and the crispy chicken thigh. Both were delicious but we loved the steak tartar! The flavor was just so rich and melts in your mouth! For entrees we had the steak and duck. The duck was definitely worth trying! It was crispy on the outside but very tender on the inside. We would definitely be back!,1,,1
8,Ben D.,"South Orange, NJ",74,203,1310,4.0,5/8/2018,"Smooth lower east side spot turning out some big flavors.  The whipped ricotta is a great starter.  Served over a perfect brioche with raw honey, this is a meal within itself.  But save room for the Virginia's burger, topper with Cabot cheese and onion marmalade, this burger has an aged flavor that rivals some of the best in the city.",2,,2
9,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/19/2017,Came here for restaurant week and loved it. The spot is so cozy and seems good for both small groups and large parties. I loved the uniqueness of every item on the restaurant week menu. I need to come back to try the burger because I hear great things.The service was also excellent. There was a mixup with our reservation so we had to wait about 20 minutes and they served us free bubbly at the bar while we waited!,1,,
10,James S.,"New York, NY",12,92,327,3.0,4/14/2018,"Pretty good burger and very addictive French fries, but very, very expensive. The burger was $18 by itself, added an egg for $4, and fries for $9. That's $31, plus tax and tip pushes the total close to $40. Normally I don't balk at restaurant pricing, but this was egregiously excessive. On Avenue C, no less. The terrible value for a simple burger and fries compels me to give no more than three stars.",4,,
11,Maia H.,"New York, NY",180,125,83,4.0,11/27/2017,"Short version: We came for the burger. The burger was pretty freaking good. Longer version: BF and I came here on a Saturday night (Thanksgiving weekend) and had no wait to sit at the bar. I ordered a fancy cocktail and he ordered a beer - both were good. I loved the seasonal eggnog in my cocktail. For an appetizer, we split the tuna tartare. This was probably my favorite dish the entire evening. The crunch of the quinoa and the flavor of the seaweed strips and sauce was unbelievable. I wanted more immediately. We both ordered the burger, mine medium and his medium-rare (the chef's recommendation). This burger is constructed in a way that lets you appreciate the meat and the flavor is killer. I'm a fan of pickles, so was happy with the big side of them but would have loved a small thing of fries or a salad or something to go along with. Overall, this place is a great date night spot that provides a solid burger. It isn't my favorite in the city, but it would be top 10 for sure.",1,,

Updated review","Update March 2018:Took my family here for dinner and it was delicious! We had the duck, steak, and skate - no standout because they were all amazing. We also had the mussels and the chocolate ganache dessert with Thai ice cream. Mussels were so so good, the ice cream was great but the ganache was a little too sweet for us (though we still ate it happily :). Drinks were also good, get the mezcal! Will definitely be back to try the burger.",4,,1
13,Anna D.,"New York, NY",20,48,17,4.0,1/20/2018,"Food. Amazing. Got the duck and steak (duck was the standout for me). It all came out very quickly. Almost too quickly. We were in and out in 30 min it felt like. Service. Good. Nothing to write home about. Space. Very tight. Note for Pulsd deal redeemers, make reservation via email. They limit the times available to Pulsd users vs. other customers. Would come again without coupon but not in a hurry. Great food. Okay dining experience. Location could not be closer to where I live so maybe for a casual night out when we're craving a solid dinner but would not recommend for a special occasion.",,,
14,Lisa G.,"Port Chester, NY",37,3,5,5.0,4/24/2018,"Virginia's makes my favorite burger in NYC, hands down. Thinking about it just makes me salivate. I've had it maybe 10 times and I can't get enough. And if you're not a burger lover, they have plenty of other great options. They always have good seafood and vegetarian selections too. On the current menu, the steak is also AMAZING. And whatever toast they're offering when you go, be sure to get it! Love their local focus. The brunch is as good as it gets (and for a great price with lots of great wine and drink deals during brunch). Their egg dishes are seriously brunch goals. To top it all off, the drinks list is great and the space is warm and cozy, great for dates, girls night out, or special occasions.",1,,1
15,Ron G.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",153,22,0,3.0,7/8/2018,"Want to start this review by saying we discovered Virginia's through a pulsd deal. We tried to make a reservation on a Saturday night. When we called to make the reservation, the earliest time that they could get us in for was 9pm. We asked if they could get us in for any sooner and we were told that earlier times were ""reserved for people who pay full price"". I can understand, but at the same time, it was an extremely rude thing to say to a customer. Why even offer a pulsd deal if you're going to be rude to those who purchase them and basically shame them for not paying full price...We canceled our plans to dine there. Despite that experience, we decided to give it another shot. When we did, I didn't necessarily think it was worth the price. The portions were super small. The burger (i guess they are known for this) was just okay. They did not ask me how i wanted it cooked and it came out well done. We looked at the menu ahead of time and they took off the options to order a few of the items we were hoping to try and the updated menu was very limited.",3,,
16,Ayumi W.,"San Francisco, CA",394,175,325,4.0,8/14/2017,"I came here for restaurant week. The staff is very friendly and definitely loved the vibe! Intimate, date restaurant. I had the skate though it was slightly salty. Still tasty! The quinoa market salad was very delicious and light. It was a nice dinner but also not a place I'm DYING to go back to, but I'd still recommend - hence the 4star.",2,1,1
17,Adam C.,"New York, NY",377,175,58,5.0,7/8/2017,"Top notch burger without a doubt. I've been to most of the ""best burger"" spots in NYC and this is definitely now on the list. Perfectly cooked and charred, not too juicy but enough to give off tremendous flavor. A bit expensive for not having fries but that wouldn't stop me from going back. Certainly worth a trip!",2,1,2

19,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",383,633,1398,5.0,7/17/2017,"Went to Virginia's for brunch and our big group had a great time! Fun fact, Virginia is the owner's mother's name. I think it is a lovely tribute! Another fun fact, besides the bread, they make everything in the house (is that the reason why they don't have ketchup??).The restaurant is pretty small, and weirdly can accommodate a lot of people! The staff was very courteous and professional and the food succulent! For appetizers we were offered a puffed salad with quinoa or an avocado toast. I went with the toast. The bread was delicious and the seasoning on point! Our main course were a frittata, poached eggs over corned beef hash browns, and the house burger with caramelized onion jam. I got to try the hash brown, sooooo yummy!!! It's an easy thing to make, yet I find that it is very often totally missed. This one was perfect! The potatoes were all crunchy and there was a lot of meat in there! I loved it!! I also got a bite of the burger: succulent!! Seriously, succulent! You can tell that the meat is freshly ground and of higher quality than your average steak. The brioche bun was great, the cheese and the jam, excellent. The only thing missing from the burger was a few French fries. Seriously, even though the little sliced up pickles were great, a burger should come with a few fries, doesn't have to do much, but really, gotta add them. Desert was a berry crumble with homemade whipped cream. Omg. Totally hit the spot between healthy and treat! Loved it! Now, I want to come back at night and check out the rest of the menu, because this brunch dears, was GREAT!",1,1,2
20,Crystal D.,"Manhattan, NY",6,36,49,4.0,9/16/2017,"Came here for a Saturday brunch (only day they serve brunch actually). Very intimate but open ambience. The staff was very friendly and super attentive. We shared the corn beef hash, little gem salad & brioche french toast. Oh, can't forget the side of  brown sugar bacon. All was excellent tasting! The bacon might of been my favorite. Crisp, chewy & slight sweet hints of brown sugar. 2nd favorite was the salad because it had crispy quinoa. Sooo good. Would definitely recommend for brunch & will definitely go back!",,,
21,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,5.0,7/28/2016,"My trip to Virginia's last night was far worth the walk to Avenue C! Alphabet City has so many great hidden gems that are far enough off the beaten path that make them so worth the trip over there from time to time. Virginia's is seriously not to be missed. Let me be clear, we came here for the burger, and OMG we were not disappointed. The bar is small, fits about 10 people at best, and is where you need to be if you want the burger since it's on the bar menu only. The rest of the menu can also be ordered at the bar. The restaurant itself is small, but not tiny, and very minimalistic and classic. Nothing too fancy about the vibe. The staff were all very friendly and outgoing. The bartender, Eric was super friendly and totally fit in to the east village relaxed vibe. We were going to order 2 burgers to split between the 3 of us and 2 smaller plates, but Eric talked us out of it, and basically said he'd like to watch us fight over 2 burgers because they are that good. We cancelled one of the smaller plates and went for the gusto - 3 burgers, all medium rare. SO glad we changed our minds! We also started with the caramelized cauliflower which was awesome and definitely unique. I'm sure the regular dinner menu is great too, and according to Eric, everything on it is amazing. The burger was pretty simple with no fancy toppings, no sauces; just Cabot white cheddar and a Vidalia onion marmalade. It needed NOTHING more. The meat was flavorful and the onion marmalade added a touch of sweetness. I ate every. last. bite. It came with nothing but a little side of pickles which was really all it needed. It comes with a price tag of $18, which isn't something to just blink at, especially since it comes sans fries or a side, but it was absolutely worth it. This truly is now on my top list of favorite burgers in the city. Don't take that statement lightly.",5,1,4

Good quality of beef, great bun, very good cheese, and delicious caramelized onions. Definitely top-5 burgers I've had in the city. It doesn't come with anything other than a few pickles, so the price tag is kinda high. However, it's a very sizable bun that will fill you up if you're not starving.

The place was somewhat confusing to get to for me because they have the exact same address as another completely different Italian restaurant next door... just look to the left of that place to find Virginia's. The restaurant has a cute, homey atmosphere. From the restaurant week menu, I got the chicken liver mousse, risotto, and panna cotta. All were fantastic! Super tasty and great portion sizes. Others in my party opted to order from the regular menu, which was great that they allowed us to mix and match. The burrata and octopus small plates were also very tasty. The tagliatelle with sea urchin and crab was probably my favorite dish of the night. The pasta was perfectly made, there was a lot of uni in the dish, super unique, and it was truly fantastic - available in small or large portion as an entree. The lamb was slightly over done but still good. A nice touch at the end were these dark chocolate cookies that are given as a treat at the end of the meal (they kind of look like pine cones), but they were super yummy also!Restaurant week is $42 for the three courses; other pricing is also reasonable ($20-$30 per entree). We also had a bottle of their red sparkling wine, which I'd never tried before but did enjoy. Service was good and friendly. The only weird thing was my friend asked for pepper to season his meal. They brought a whole pepper grinder and then asked if he was done with it afterwards. He wanted to keep it for his entree too, but they said it was their only one... the host said that we could keep it but then the waitress swiped it away when she came by next.Will definitely come back for a yummy, decently nice meal without an outrageous price tag!",2,2,2

28,Helen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,438,1260,2.0,2/3/2017,"Strictly commenting on the restaurant week menu... Food under-performed and we were shockingly disappointed due to the glowing reviews. Chicory salad was okay, the oranges were delightfully sweet but the plate was surprisingly small. Chicken liver mousse was the better option. Friend thought the risotto was decent but is decent all you want? The duck confit was a huge letdown, especially when I was expecting something decadent, succulent, and all kinds of other positive -ents but sadly, this dish failed to satisfy me. It was incredibly salty and the meat was tough to fork apart. The items that sort of saved the dish were the beans and sausage bits. It's unfortunate the star of the dish didn't shine. For dessert, we had the panna cotta and apple with oats; this part of the meal being the only area my friend and I can agree was acceptable, sorta. Considering the dessert was the best part of the meal then that really says it all about my restaurant week experience with Virginia's. The staff was friendly and welcoming, but they kept messing up with who ordered what. The entire night my friend got my food and I got hers. You'd think they only got confused once but nope, they messed up every time they came over with the plates. It was comical and odd at the same time. If I was a hard-ass I would've just ripped them a new one every time they made the mistake but I'm not so I didn't. One extra thing to note is we ordered cocktails and a side of brussel sprouts, and they were great.",1,2,

The space is cute and the service is great and the burger is out of this world! I would argue that it is one of the best burgers in NYC right now. The jam, cheese and juicy burger are perfectly blended and not to mention the perfectly toasted tasty bun! I haven't been so pleased with a burger in a really long time and this one knocks it out of the park! I got the crushed potatoes on side which were great but totally overshadowed by the star! My burger came out a little to rare for me at medium so if you like it cooked a normal medium I would suggest medium well. They threw mine back to cook with no complaints and it came back perfectly cooked after a few more mins!

32,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,5.0,10/23/2016,"Ever since I've seen the burger on Instagram, I have been DYING to Virginia's. I finally was able to try their master piece last weekend and it was everything that I imagined it to be and more. We arrived at around 6:15 pm on a Saturday and surprisingly, the restaurant was completely empty. Tip - the restaurant isn't tricky to find, but it is a bit confusing on where to enter. You'll walk past their closed door thinking it's a side door and end up peeping into the next opened door (which happens to be a different restaurant), so just pull on the first door you see when you see the Virginia's sign. The restaurant really is that small. My boyfriend and I both ordered the famous burger - his medium, mine medium rare. Not sure if it was an off day, but service was lacking here. The bartender didn't ask / remember who ordered what burger and just handed the burgers to us. My boyfriend ended up with the medium rare, while I ended up with the medium. Granted, both burgers were amazing (we both switched halfway), the medium rare was amazing x1000. It was so juicy! I shamelessly wiped my bun in all of the glorious drippings. Virginia's burger easily became my favorite burger in NYC, beating out Rahoul's and the Le Matt from Emmy Squared. Despite its sauce, you can hands down still taste the purity of the beef patty. It's also complemented by an oh so soft bun, which is also toasted to perfection. You also don't leave the restaurant wanting to crawl into a ball from being overly stuffed and the heaviness of a meal that you just had. My only compliant would be that you're paying a whopping $18 for just a burger - would love the accompanying side of fries (you can't order a side of fries either), but hey for the best burger I've had, I'll sacrifice fries (and boy do I love fries). Yes, it's a bit far given its location on Avenue C, but you HAVE to come here for the burger. They're known for their burgers for a reason.",5,3,5
33,Eve C.,"Manhattan, NY",343,856,805,5.0,11/9/2016,Go with maybe one other person and find a spot at the bar. Get the burger. It's simple and it's so juicy and delicious. The simplicity of the burger really lets the beef shine. The bread helps soak up all the juices but you will still have juices run down your finger. Just ignore social graces and lick your fingers. You don't want to miss any of it. The service here is warm and welcoming. It's a great place to just have a great bite. It's relaxed just a great place in the neighborhood.,4,1,2
34,Laurie S.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,4.0,7/26/2018,"Received a lovely gift certificate from my friend Mary of $150 to Virginia's Restaurant and have wanted to eat there since it opened. I read about their eclectic dishes, and many piqued my interest. So tonight my husband and I made the trek there (about 2 minutes away!). It was a good time to go (6:00 pm) because most people don't eat this early in the East Village, but since we're oldies, this was perfect for us. We ordered one starter off the regular menu, and the rest off the Restaurant Week menu. I so wanted to taste the wagyu meatballs, because I hadn't ever tasted wagyu beef, but trying wagyu in the form of meatballs was very dumb. A meatball is a meatball is a meatball. Once you add breadcrumbs, egg, cheese, etc.... cover it with tomato sauce, this is no platform for wagyu beef. I should have picked something else. Appetizers: the poke bowl, which was sea bass, some fresh mozzarella, and supposedly watermelon. Whether it had watermelon or not, I couldn't tell you, but the poke bowl was deliriously delicious. Too bad only had one, I would have wanted 9 more. My husband had Heirloom Tomato Toast, Roasted Garlic, Basil, Pecorino. Since this is not his kind of dish, I was shocked to find out how much he liked it. Main course: their burger, was not all it was built up to be. It was very good, cooked well, juicy and on a good brioche bun. No, there were no fries, but if I added another $4, there could have been bacon. There WAS some Cabot Cheddar hiding out, but it was not pronounced. Abhorring anything sweet on my burger, opted out of the onion marmalade (though I do love a nice raw Vidalia slice). On the side of the burger was a teeny, tiny cup of a few see-through slices of slightly pickled cucumber. Hubby had Local Corn Ravioli, Chive Oil, Crispy Shallots, Thyme, which he enjoyed very much. For me, the shallots were too strong, and overtook the flavor of the corn. For $42 each, we had our choice of two deserts: Tahitian Vanilla Bean Flan, with Toasted Caramel, and Bitter Chocolate Mousse. The flan was really nothing special, plus the portion was very tiny. My chocolate mousse was better, the best part being the bottom. It was a Devil's Food cake bottom, and I wish the whole thing would have been Devil's Food!Would have to say, Virginia's is a refreshing upscale eating establishment here in the EV, however, I can only rate it at 3.5 stars, as opposed to 4, and forget 5. Didn't check the bathrooms, have no idea whether they're accessible, but the two steps coming into the restaurant could be changed to a ramp so that vertically challenged people could visit. Staff is courteous and helpful.",,,

This place has been on my burger list since I moved to the east village. So you can only order the burger if you're seated at the bar. The bartender was just so down to earth and really nice. He was very confident that this would be probably one of the best, if not the best, burger we would ever had. Honestly, he isn't wrong. This was one of the best burgers I've ever had. And for NYC, reasonably priced. It seems to find a very fancy burger for under $20 is a steal. Their burger is topped with Cabot cheddar, vidalia onion marmalade, and a bone marrow aioli. Seriously? That just sounds amazing typing it out. It's like having a juicy tender steak in buns. You have to just try it for yourself. I don't know what I can possibly tell you to describe the joy of eating this burger. Go eat it. ASAP.",2,1,1

Virginias did not let us down.Not only was the food beautifully presented, but it tasted amazing. I am a huge fan of corn and decided to go with the Barbecue Shrimp, Corn, Pickled Mustard Seed, Peach appetizer. What a wonderful way to start my meal. For my main I had the fish which was good. And desert was a delicious Market Fruit Crisp, with Oats and Honey Ice Cream. Sad to say that the menu is always changing here, so I don't know when Ill be able to get this again. On the bright side each menu item is delicious and I'll be back to try some new things. This place is only wine and beer, but they make great cocktails with their options.

We arrived early and had a quick drink at the bar. I strongly suggest the ""ginger spice and everything nice."" The summer melon also looked good though I didn't get to sample that one. For dinner I had the ricotta toast, falafel, and s'mores dessert. My highlight was definitely the dessert. It had a toasted marshmallow with sophisticated graham cracker crumble and cold chocolate moose on the bottom. Just so freakkkking good. As for service, their sommelier came over to offer suggestions on the wine menu which I thought was a nice touch. Our waiter was attentive, the waters were constantly refilled by a busboy and the bartender didn't miss a beat when offering suggestions on their all beer and wine menu (no hard liquor here folks). Please note that with a few drinks and dinner you will round out a bit of a hefty price tag. Def save for a nicer occasion.All in all, lovely experience.",3,,1
42,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",285,201,532,4.0,6/3/2015,"I came here with my parents and their friend last Friday night.  It was an early dinner, at 6, so the place wasn't too crowded when we got there.  The place isn't huge, but there's two rooms and a bar.  The window in the front was wide open, which is nice to have when the weather is nice.  The tables are a bit close together, but while we were there no one sat directly next to us, so it didn't bother me at all. We weren't too familiar with the wine list, and weren't looking for something too expensive, so the wine guy (sommelier just doesn't sound right when I say it) helped us to pick out something we liked.  He found us a bottle of Riesling that wasn't too sweet, and all of us enjoyed.  On to the food!  We all got our own appetizers and entrees and split desserts.  I got the sweetbreads!  When I found what sweetbreads were I never thought I'd like them, but I tried it for the first time at WD-50 and have been hooked ever since.  I hate when people say this, but it really does taste like fried chicken.  It was really good here too.  It was accompanied by peas and apricots at the bottom.  For my main course I got the Atlantic striped bass.  It was really good.  The skin was nice and crispy and the fish was cooked well.  It was in a broth and had clams and potatoes underneath the fish.  For dessert I shared the Austrian (I think, it was a special) layer cake. It was good, it kind of tasted like marzipan.  I would have liked a chocolate dessert, but they only had a chocolate beet cake and my dad despises beets.  I'm not a fan either really, so we went with the special. Overall, food was great!  It was a nice little spot.  It's kind of out of the way, being close to the corner of Ave C, but I'd like to go back sometime.  The menu is not huge, but I feel like everyone should find something they like.",3,1,2

Mushroom risotto pretty yummy. Brussel sprouts were standard and the scallops were also just ok. Nothing too unique honestly. The byrrh cocktail was very good.What I noticed was how they kept trying to rush us out. We were four girls catching up on a Friday and I saw no reason for them to keep pulling our semi-full plates away. I find that such a huge difference vs dining in Europe. There you're expected to linger. Here it's like a big revolving door. Granted, sometimes I'm in a NY rush and I'm in and out.

But you'll figure it out when you see a menu next to the door. Anyways, onto the food... We started off with a shrimp appetizer which I thought was perfectly cooked just like the scallops I had for main. The shrimp were crispy on the outside and very moist and tender when you take a bite. The scallops were nicely seared and bursting with flavor. I loved it!

55,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,3.0,7/14/2015,"KenScale: 7.5/10Virginia's recently opened on the quiet corner of Avenue C. I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant as it had some high-profile names (ex-Per Se Sous-chef Christian Ramos and Locanda Verde vet Reed Adelson) showcasing modern American bistro food. I thought this could be the kind of neighborhood place I would love to go again and again and wish no one would know about. While the food overall was all good, though, I didn't see unexpected magic coming from the kitchen. The starters I tried were both good, Grilled white shrimp came with peaches and purple pole beans and provided a nice crunchy texture. Seared cuttlefish also had an interesting texture and worked well with asparagus and green garlic. Neither dish was particularly ground-breaking, however. I guess I was expecting a bit more vitality and versatility in flavor, and cuttlefish was a bit on the salty side. The large dishes were a bit more underwhelming. I was really eager to check out the roasted duck breast, but it came away a bit on the tougher side to my great surprise. I have grown to love the tender texture of perfectly cooked meat, and came away puzzled, and the fermented soy bean, breakfast radish, and plum didn't add much to the meat. Atlantic striped bass, accompanied by saffron, cockles and potatoes, was nicely cooked, but bass is another one of those foods I'd grown to love and tried truly outstanding dishes elsewhere, so perhaps my standard had become unattainably high. I am all for a simple yet well-executed meal, but the one at Virginia's felt a bit inconsistent. Raw honey panna cotta came with blueberry compote for a nice, delicate flavor, but it wasn't particularly memorable.Getting a reservation at Virginia's wasn't particularly hard, although the space was nearly packed in the course of my meal. The restaurant has a full bar with fairly standard cocktail menu and some nice wine selections. I did like the neighborhood vibe of the restaurant that gives the cozy vibe of the increasingly gentrified Alphabet City. I really wish I could've liked Virginia's more, but I've been to other American bistro places lately that I would give higher score for consistency. Perhaps I would visit again once the kitchen settles down a bit more?",8,,1

57,Maria C.,"Forest Hills, NY",108,151,0,5.0,9/11/2016,"Okay. We have all eaten at a lot of restaurants. I have personally eaten at a lot of restaurants, ranging from the grittiest holes of Los Angeles to the crunchiest farm-to-table joints of Portland, Oregon, to some of the most renowned restaurants of New York City, and many, many places in between. But this is honestly one of my favorite restaurants of all time.On a scale of unique flavors and inventive combinations, Virginia's is a 10, no question. Things happened in my mouth that I never expected nor imagined could happen. So lemme just tell you what we had:Lamb Tartare. I mean, what the fuck. This dish seemed to contain every ingredient I could want in one dish; lamb, Greek yogurt, harissa, pistachios, dill, parsley...god it was just heavenly. And of all the tartares and carpaccios I have tasted, this one was most unique for the fact that it tasted almost nothing like lamb once it is cooked. I happen to love lamb, but I was surprised at the mildness and ever-so-slightly chewy texture of the raw cut.Roasted Cauliflower. At first this seemed pretty standard, but when you really got into it, cutting the florets apart and bathing them in the dressing, scooping them into your mouth with pine nuts, speck, and tiny morsels of cheddar, this dish ended up being the perfect veggie starter.Grilled Red Wattle Pork Chop with fava beans and charred corn. I don't even have words for this dish. Just imagine eating a fat juicy gorgeous chunk of bacon but better than any bacon ever. I am obsessed with fava beans, so this really hit a homerun for me on every level, and the sweet, fresh, still crunchy corn was exactly the compliment that smoky pork was begging for. I just don't know how to stress this enough: order the pork.Lastly, we had a beautiful cut of fish. I can't even recall what type of fish, but it was served over a bed of legumes and perfectly offset all of the other amazing rich flavors, but it is mentioned as somewhat of an afterthought, since it did not quite reach the incredible heights of the other dishes. (However we still cleaned the plate to a near shine.)We shared both desserts on the menu and all I can say is that this is a far cry from your boring creme brulee. There was black sesame ice cream with some kind of frozen raspberry compote which was so surprising and addictive that as soon as it was gone I wanted another serving. The dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, banana, and brown butter was basically the best chocolate dessert I've ever eaten. I mean c'mon. It is just perfect in every way. The texture of the chocolate and crunch of the roasted peanuts became my whole world during the beautiful moments that my tastebuds were allowed that experience.Needless to say there was scarcely a remaining trace of food or sauce on any of the plates that were delivered to our table. We had a beautiful bottle of white wine which complimented every bite.Finally, I have to give high credit to the service. Every single person who works at Virginia's is someone you feel like you can talk to. Our server was an angel. The manager was incredibly friendly and attentive. The bartender was both funny and personable. The guys in the kitchen were visible and, well, they turned out some of the best food I've ever tasted. I want to personally congratulate them. I just cannot wait to come back to Virginia's.",1,1,1

There is no way to explain how impressed we are. We walked into an empty restaurant (still is btw, almost 8pm). You wouldn't know it. The staff from the wait staff to management are all so on point, not cracking a bit under the obvious nerves of a brand new restaurant on its second day, waiting for the people to come. Come they will. I have no doubt this is going to be the place that Alphabet City knows to go to for a very un-alphabet city dining experience. Everything is perfect. Every dish is constructed perfectly. Perfect. Got it? It's perfect.I would list the dishes we had, but there's no point.

60,Victoria L.,"Bayside, NY",115,103,294,5.0,5/26/2015,"We celebrated a dear friend's birthday here last week and quite honestly, I was very impressed with the service. Based on the previous reviews, I went in with high expectations and they were all spot on. We had 7:30 reservations but my friend was running late so I waited at the bar until we were ready to be seated. When my friend arrived, they transferred my bar tab to my table without any fuss and treated me like I was a regular by knowing my name based on my reservation, despite the fact that it was my first time here. Even though the space is tight, and we were less than 6 inches from the tables next to us, the dinner still felt intimate enough where it didn't feel like we were sharing our meal with the strangers seated along side us.For us, however, we were there to celebrate and so that night it was like our motto was, ""the more the merrier"" and true to form, we ended up making new friends with the couple seated on my right, as if we suddenly became a four-top midway through our meal. I honestly wish they had more vegetarian options. I accidentally ordered two appetizers based on the description on the menu without realizing there was meat. To start, we ordered: Caramelized Romanesco (sans Speck). It was fine but would have probably been better served as it was intended.We also ordered the Mizuna salad, a Japanese broccoli type dish (which was probably the best thing on the menu) that no longer seems to be available.And the Crispy Sweetbreads. *Caution! Turns out this isn't actually a sweet bread as the name implies, but we found out too late and took a bite before realizing the texture seemed off.. turns out it's veal! My bad.. (we're both vegetarians - sorry!).For sides, we ordered the Crushed Potatoes (which was more like very creamy mashed potatoes) and it was smothered in chives giving it a really awesome crunch. I actually really loved everything about it. We also got the Roasted Mushrooms but it was a little too salty so I had to balance it out with a mouthful of the potatoes with each bite.For our main, we split the Gnocchi and it was delicious! It was creamy, soft, savory and I really appreciated their plucky size because it gave them a nice mouth-feel.The Chocolate Beet Cake was actually very good. The portion size seemed extremely small, even for fine-dining plated dessert standards, but nevertheless, I enjoyed the entire 3 bites it yielded.We also got the ordered the Raw Honey Panna Cotta, which was fine.",3,1,1

I had the virginia spritz cocktail, which was an amazingly refreshing citrusy and not-too-sweet spruced up version of a wine spritzer. The meat and cheese appetizer was delicious, as well as the scallops and steak. The portions are fairly small so it's nice to order multiple menu items between a table and sample. Something was a little off about the ambiance that I couldn't really put my finger on - maybe the lights were too bright or the rap music? - but with food that good it's fully worth the trip.",2,,2
63,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",125,291,1096,4.0,5/14/2015,"For a one week old restaurant, Virginia's exceeds my expectation in every perspective. I came in on a Tuesday night at 8 with no reservation and we were promptly seated at the bar. The decoration is warm and cozy, typical East Village/Alphabet City style. The yellow  leather seats set against the white brick wall, reminding me of the Hamptons. I like that they opened up all the front doors - even sitting in the back of the room, we could still feel the breeze. Menu is not big but very well thought of and intriguing. Mostly small and medium plates so good for sharing. It is new American cooking but sparks Asian influence here and there. Good thing, my friend was starving so we just ordered any thing catching out eyes :)We started with couple small plates:- Grilled white shrimp. 3.5/5  The real star of the dish is the dressing which appears to be green peas purée . Simply seasoned with sea salt, spring herbs and decorated with Asian pears. It's healthy and seasonal. The reason of 3.5 is that the shrimps were slightly over-cooked.- Crispy sweetbread. 3.2/5  I had high expectation for this dish yet I was not as impressed. The breading was a tad too thick for my taste; and it was not crispy but almost rock-hard - think a frozen chicken nugget. That is how hard the crust was. I could barely taste the sweetbread itself. on the other hand, I love the dressing and the accompany  pea leaves and charred lemon. the color is simply delightful. I wish the taste too. - Seppia a la Plancha 3.8/5 This is good but not mind-blowingly good. Savory, toothsome seppia goes well with the sweet, earthy asparagus and green garlic. We ordered a bottle of Varron Cotes du Jura Chardonnay to go with the small plates. and it worked out perfectly. Adding one note, wine list is well curated and reasonably priced at Virginia's.Now move on to the bigger ones. - Gnocchi with morels, fava beans, top it with shaved parmesan. I am not a fan of any pasta; but this one will get my vote. The texture of the gnocchi is al dente! The dressing is savory and fragrant. It is also a nice transition from the lighter, smaller plates for the meatier entree to come.We switched to Les vins contés R14 for the main courses. it is a lovely red blends, ruby red, robust plum, raspberry notes, soft tanning.  - Seared scallops. The scallops are huge!  Perfectly charred outside yet still juicy and buttery inside. Cutting it in halves are effortless; putting in your mouth , it melts like butter! Very satisfactory. This dish itself is worthy coming back for. - Now the star of tonight's dinner: roasted duck breast, seasoned with fermented soy bean, accompanied with breakfast radish and plum. The skin is light and crispy with a thin line of fat adding richness to the dish but not feeling heavy at all. The meat is soft and juicy. The fermented soybean adds earthy, savory taste to the bird; the accompany plums are tart and sweet, great contrast to the saltiness of the soybean sauce . Along the main course, we order two sides, the roasted mushrooms and crushed potatos. All good. We finished up with the chocolate beet cake, with Beet Cream, Oaxacan Chocolate, Amaretti. it was lighter than regular chocolate lava cake. if you like dessert, def go with this one.Overall, I am very impressed about Virginia, giving the fact that they just opened a week ago. Food are well designed and perfectly executed. And services was friendly and prompt. The bar tender, Ginger, is a total sweetheart, who took care of all our orders, questions and drinks! I wish I lived close enough to come back often.Don't say I did not warn you. Words are out, make your reservation before it becomes too difficult to :)",2,1,2

66,Jacob G.,"New York, NY",9,3,2,4.0,3/27/2017,"I had a couple friends visiting me in the city from San Francisco and we went to Virginia's on Saturday night for a celebratory birthday dinner. The atmosphere, decor and service were great. It wasn't too loud or too quiet, which is a surprisingly hard balance for so many restaurants to find. We started with cocktails, which were all excellent. Both my friends ordered off their house cocktail list and received tasty, inventive drinks. I had a martini that was made perfectly to my specifications. My only complaint was that two servers asked us multiple times if we were ready to order food, though we had said we'd like to order after our drinks. Food-wise, we were impressed. For a starter we split the burrata with salsa verde which was fresh and light. For mains, my friends had the Amish chicken and seafood tagliatelle and I had the duck confit. I thought the chicken was uninspired and not very interesting, though my friend liked it well enough. The tagliatelle was very good - slightly sweet, earthy and spicy. The duck was by far the best dish we tried. I want to go back for that alone. We didn't have dessert, but stuck with digestifs instead so I can't comment on them. I will say there were only two dessert options and neither seemed particularly enticing (the have a good selections of 'liquid desserts' though). The wine list was fairly limited, so if you need 20 pages of options keep that in mind, but it's a wide enough selection that it should have something for everyone. Next time I'll try their bar menu.",,2,

These were supposed to include creme fraiche and chives, but neither were to be found. I would understand if these were simply an included side item to my burger but when I order them separately at that high of a price i expect a full portion with nothing missing.

69,Michael S.,"San Francisco, CA",380,120,43,5.0,12/2/2015,"One of the best meals I've had in New York in recent times. I enjoyed every aspect of the meal, from the creativity of the dishes to their wonderful flavors, the excellent service and the lovely ambiance. This is on my short list of restaurants in the city that I'd consider dining at multiple times.Of the five dishes we ordered, I thoroughly enjoyed every single one of them.  Not only were they each delicious, but they were all something out of the ordinary. I never felt like I was having a dish that I had also had somewhere else once. I'm nothing close to resembling a vegetarian, but surprisingly some of the my favorite dishes of the evening were vegetarian.For appetizers we had the caramelized romanesco, the shrimp, and the cuttlefish. The flavors in the romanesco and the shrimp were absolutely fantastic. Entrees consisted of the butternut squash risotto and the scallops. The risotto's texture and taste were extremely well done. The scallops were delicate and had a wonderfully buttery taste. Every dish was also wonderfully presented. Some reviews have complained about the portions being small. However, they were just the right size to enjoy what they had to offer without becoming overbearing by having too much of it. With three appetizers and two entrees we were sufficiently full by the end of the meal. Considering the entrees were all priced below $30 I feel five dishes for two people isn't unreasonable at all.The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were able to find several glasses of wine on the menu that looked interesting, and they were served in Riedel glasses. Decor was classy, but the tables were quite closely arranged. A couple was seated next to us about three quarters of the way through our meal and ended up having a small argument a few minutes into their dinner. Luckily we were finishing up and got to the dodge the bullet of hearing the entire ordeal.The restroom was very clean and smelled quite nice.",4,3,2
70,Wayne C.,"New York, NY",160,84,61,4.0,1/28/2016,"First things first, did I feel out of place for not ordering a glass of wine? Of course I do. Let's be real, this place is theoretically not for anyone under 21. I had a hard time to settle with tap water and continue drinking my Starbucks latte without being stared at, which trust me, wasn't a pleasant experience (they came to me three times trying to get rid of my coffee!) I don't know if it is this place's fault or maybe just because I'm in East Village and nobody adores Starbucks. Or maybe it's just me being picky.Otherwise, things are pretty solid. Our uber ride came a tiny bit late but we had no problem settling for a nice table. My burger was nice, just as nice as everyone else cited, and my buddy's sandwich turned out quite nice. Very juicy, very satisfying, and stimulated my taste bud just enough for me to not grab a dessert at the end.I'd love to say this place is casual, but even without the wine, it went a tidbit above my budget. Saw a table of wealthy, presumably Jewish gentleman, who seems to be having the time of their lives. That's how I will show up here the next time.",1,3,2

The portions are not filling at all (and please do not think that it is the reason why I didn't like the food; would there have three times more food, I would have found the food just as unsatisfying). Not much flavor, and the only flavors I tasted were actually not the kind of taste I wanted in my mouth.I would unfortunately not recommend this place however the place is really cute and cozy.",7,,

And I can just imagine the obnoxious behavior of these pompous brats and Virginia's staff has my sympathy.....how dare they tell other people how they should run their businesses...gross presumptuousness.Our dinner was fantastic. We tried so many different things and loved them all.  The beer and wine selection with educated suggestions was a treat.  And yes....that burger you've been hearing about is that good - BUT ONLY AT THE BAR.  Don't be an ass - if you want the burger, sit at the bar.Service was attentive and fun.  The staff obviously has a great respect and joy for Virginia's and it shows.I can't wait to go back...and I'm torn about where to sit...but I keep thinking about that burger!Thank you Virginia's for making my birthday dinner and extra special treat in every possible way!",,,

The juiciness that oozes from this thing is amazeballs. What makes it extra special and flavorful is the vidalia onion marmalade...sweet but not too overpowering. And that cheddar cheese mmmmm.

Food wins. Experience = 2, thus the 3 stars. From what I witnessed, I give them until February/March 2016.I have written very few reviews, two of my predicted fails resulted in exactly that.

We tried all of the sides: potatoes, squash and Brussels sprouts and all of them were great.  We also had the pickles, which were very good.  Our group tried both of the desserts, the chocolate one and the black sesame pudding one and both were great.

It took over a fairly crappy pub that had mediocre food and never had any people in it, so seeing a nice restaurant like this pop up was a welcome sight. Well, had dinner here finally tonight and man, was the food fantastic. My boyfriend and I started with the shrimp and peaches, which was delightful. I wish there were, oh, maybe 6 shrimp instead of 4, for the price, but it was great.I had the sweet corn risotto and he had the hangar steak. We got the potatoes on the side. Those potatoes were amazing! so so so good. I loved my risotto; im a big fan of risotto in general, but often they are a little too creamy and very heavy. Not so here, it was just perfect and delicious. Even my boyfriend was in love with the couple bites he took.The steak was very good; he ordered it medium rare, and that it was. But even better than the steak was the Argentinian chorizo served on the side. Wow. I could eat just a plate of that!On top of the food, VERY friendly service. They were really kind to us with being neighbors, and everyone just seemed so pleasant and attentive. Couldn't ask for better.Pricey? a little. Delicious? YES. And we were glad to see it's been busy.

I'm a food and beverage photographer whose photographed in some great kitchens, so I don't think the euphoria of the celebration clouded my experience at Virginia's.  Again and again the food and staff will draw us farther east than we would normally be willing to go.Must have: Caramelized Romanesco",1,,1

114,Vveerrgg E.,"Toronto, Canada",32,24,3,5.0,8/1/2015,I almost don't want to leave a review its soooo good. We came as a party of 4 and had one of every main. Shockingly good. Sampling 7 dishes and desert. Wow... Amazing. Definitely a new gem to the neighbourhood. Would come again and would definitely suggest it to anyone looking for an intimate night on the lower east village.,1,,
115,Hadley H.,"Boston, MA",65,76,56,4.0,10/13/2015,"You definitely must get the seasonal risotto entree to split as an appetizer--it is unbelievably good. Their wine selection is also interesting; cocktails are a bit on the weaker side. I am withholding a star because despite the expense, the portions are definitely smaller than I would have liked.",,,
116,Julie B.,"Bronx, NY",1,8,0,5.0,7/29/2015,"Had a fabulous meal here tonight!  The shrimp was delectable, the romanescu was succulent and the risotto was to die for. Pair that with awesome and friendly service and quite frankly I could eat here every night",1,,
117,Michelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,12/3/2015,"This restaurant is amazing, last night was my 2nd chance to dine here and the food is nothing but excellent. The bar menu that includes a burger on it is one of the best I've ever had. The brussels sprouts were on point as well. Between what I ordered and what others did, there wasn't a single bad bite. Love the food and the setup. The ambiance is great too. My first time dining there was a larger group for a birthday party and they did such a great job hosting and accommodating us with a special menu. Can't wait to come back!",,,
118,Olivia C.,"New York, NY",10,23,0,5.0,11/11/2016,"Um. Wow. I went here with a group of people that would normally not venture into this neighborhood, and it was honestly one of the best meals i've had in a long time. The decor is very quaint and chic, and the space is small. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming and the drinks were absolutely fantastic. Although we were not able to order the burger (served at the bar only), we instead did the Amish chicken and steak, mashed potatoes, spaghetti squash, brussels sprouts, Pate, and the Cavatelle (UNBELIEVABLE). Everything was super tasty and again, the service was great. I highly recommend Virginia's for Date Night or for girl's night out! Its awesome. We went to the Wayland afterwards for a nightcap.. great evening. I'll be going back to try the burger!",,,
119,Alexander S.,"Pinckney, MI",3,32,3,5.0,10/31/2015,"Fabulous restaurant. I wasn't expecting such refined and complete cuisine. After receiving the appetizers, I assumed that the entrée wouldn't come close. The shrimp, the duck spread, and the cuttlefish were all fantastic, but reminded me of a restaurant that does not follow up as well with its bigger desk. Yet, the beef was fantastic and assuaged my foolish assumption.",,,
120,John B.,"New York, NY",224,2,0,5.0,11/18/2015,This is such a cute little restaurant. The food is great and the service is awesome. Definitely a place to try.,,,
121,David G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,1,3.0,5/26/2016,"Food was fine. Burger is only available at the bar, so didn't try it. Seems to be quite an arbitrary distinction, so much so that it's just nonsensical. Probably makes it more exclusive, four bar seats were full the rest of the place was empty. Likely not worth the risk of coming in case the bar is full.",1,,
122,Shivani B.,"Manhattan, NY",21,59,37,5.0,7/17/2015,"amazing food, great service and hip-hop playlist.  highly recommend the caramelized romanesco starter - one of the better dishes i've had in awhile.  the corn risotto is incredible as well.  get a reservation while you can!",,,
123,Andrew M.,"Brooklyn, NY",161,31,2,5.0,5/12/2015,"I was very eager to try out Virginia's after reading who was behind it all. It did not disappoint. The decor, service and food were impeccable. I had the cuttlefish appetizer and the striped bass - both were divine. I strongly recommend making reservations. If you have 4 or 5 people ask for the corner crescent moon table. I will be back soon!",1,,
124,Allan W.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/29/2015,This is a real find in a far off corner of the East Village. Amazingly subtle and rich food with lots of surprises  and moderate prices. The staff is professional yet friendly and the space is simple but warm. I think that they use locally sourced ingredients  and  make changes to the menu with the seasons We had the romanesco and the cuttle fish appetizers which were both extraordinary. For our main courses we shared the hanger steak and the bass- both fabulous. Our friends shared the corn risotto as an appetizer and raved about it. The wine list is interesting with fair prices. This was our second visit and we will be back again soon. Parking can be found on the streets most evenings- subway is a bit of a hike.,,,
125,Nicole M.,"New York, NY",13,144,12,5.0,7/1/2015,"Great vibes and great food. Out of everything we ordered, the must-orders are fava bean toast and raw honey panna cotta.Beautiful setting with exposed brick and beams but still sleek. Great playlist.Will definitely be back to this secret little spot.",,,
126,Zoe M.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",3,4,0,5.0,7/17/2015,"Attentive but not overbearing service with well timed coursing, thoughtful menu suggestions and personable staff. If you want a transcendental meal I recommend including the shrimp, the duck and the hanger steak with a side of the smashed potatoes. This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood with a carefully curated menu  and staff. If they are already knocking so many dishes out of the park I look forward to seeing how they grow and evolve.",,,
127,gerald s.,"Long Beach, CA",4,135,6,5.0,6/17/2016,"A lovely place to dine in the east village. The service was most pleasant, atmosphere conducive for socializing with friends and the food was very tasty. Really enjoyed our dinner!",,,
128,Elena K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,2.0,1/6/2016,"I don't understand how Yelpers are saying this is the best meal they've had in NY. The grilled shrimp appetizer is literally shrimp that was sauteed for 5 minutes and put on a plate with cocktail sauce. The burger is AMAZING, but its the only thing worth going for and they only serve it on mondays. I had the seabass and it was way too fishy and at best 3oz for a 20 something dollar fish! The service was great but not a great food experience over all. I'd skip it and go to gnoccho around the corner.",2,,
129,Daniel F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,0,5.0,7/4/2015,Easily one of the best meals I have had in NYC so far. The only issue I had was the tables were incredibly close together. I ordered the Oyster Ceviche which had great flavors but very small portion. Then I had the duck. This is where I give it five stars. That was the best duck I have had ever. The duck itself was perfectly cooked and salted and then when you mixed it with whatever was on under it (seemed to be some plum yogurt spicy thing) it was delectable.,,,
130,Chris H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,6/26/2015,"Excellent meal! -- so much so that I finally created a Yelp account to write this review. They only opened recently, so don't be worried if they're not packed at dinner time. I'm sure they will be soon!We had:- Grilled cuttlefish - Toast with some sort of veggies (can't remember exactly)- Scallops- Duck- One of their cocktails & an IPA on tapEverything was prepared perfectly, the service and ambiance were great, and the price is fair. If you can make it to Avenue C (and it is a trek!) Virginia's is worth it!",,,
131,Robert C.,"Cazenovia, NY",0,2,0,4.0,7/26/2015,"Great neighborhood bistro in NYCThis is a great little (literally) restaurant in the far East Village, an American neighborhood bistro that will challenge you a bit and please you a lot. It's tight, bordering on communal, but offers really interesting very seasonal food and an exceptionally thoughtful and diverse wine list. We split the corn risotto entree as an app - sweet corn, chanterelles, etc - summer farmer's market in a bowl. They gave us an order of the caramelized romanesco gratis - really good. Hanger steak and very gingery scallops were delicious. BTW, nothing is over $26, I think - and the wine list is really unusual. Try the white Txakolina if you haven't had it before, really nice. No liquor license yet but they're making up for it with some interesting wine-based cocktails. It's the kind of place you'd kill for in your town and it's what makes a visit to NYC special. And the soundtrack is great, too!",,,
132,Bill R.,"New York, NY",1,9,0,5.0,7/19/2015,"Tucked away off Avenue C on 11th Street, Virginia's is a great addition to the neighborhood. We had a foursome and were comfortably seated at the banquet at the front of the restaurant. Our server had a great vibe and had an intimate knowledge of everything on the menu, including the cocktails. Appetizers and main course did not disappoint. Scallops and hanger steak  were done to perfection. Nice job.",,,
133,Mary Lee W.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,0,4.0,7/19/2015,"Hard to not give this new restaurant Virginia's FIVE stars but I will hold out until I visit again.  Incredible food and service; the only negative was that it was a little warm in the restaurant; hence the four stars.We had a party of 5 and each got something different but shared everything among the group.  The sweet corn risotto was over the top as were the starters of grilled Romanesco and grilled white shrimp.  Other favorites were the hangar steak and duck.  The striped bass was equally delicious as well.  Great, cozy atmosphere with an attentive staff.  I highly recommend Virginias!",,,
134,Blaire H.,"Manhattan, NY",170,29,87,4.0,5/1/2016,"Went here last night for dinner with friends. A good date spot, and friendly staff. We got the crab toast which was delicious as an appetizer then each entre. The pork and steak were pretty good, but a bit on the salty side. The cod was awesome. Overall, I would go back",,,
135,Phoebe C.,"Chicago, IL",23,74,0,5.0,1/24/2016,"This place is a fantastic little gem. It's small overall and the dining room is divided in 2. White brick walls and tan leather seating. Very cozy and modern at the same time. Food is fantastic. I went with a group of girls and then back again with my husband (only a week later- yes it was that good). Between the 2 visits i saw or sampled almost the entire menu and everything was delicious. For entrees I personally had the scallops one visit and the sea bass the other visit. Both were very good. Others had the steak, and the pork and only good reviews. Table shared a variety of sides and apps (romanesca, eggplant toast, Brussels sprouts, shrimp, mushrooms), and all 3 desserts. Everything was fantastic. The icing on the cake was the playlist- everything from. Lauryn hill and d'angelo to Rick Ross. Only in NYC can you put great music with great food so wonderfully.",1,,
136,Buck D.,"New York, NY",12,2,0,5.0,5/31/2015,"Last night we found heaven! What a find a small intimate space with a great feel, for a party of six ask for the circular booth at the front of the house.    Menu small but difficult to select as all sounds wonderful with seasonal supplies!  Staff have been trained wellwine selection great and a reserve list.  Food was some of the best I have had in ny ...... Casa Mono , momofuko class!  Go team we will be back and already told at least 6 people to GO!",,,
137,Benjamin A.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,5.0,5/25/2015,"Virginia's was a fantastic dining experience. I went on a busy Saturday night. It started with amazing (and surprisingly well-priced) cocktails. We tried a variety of different dishes, all of which were great. My favs, though were the carmelized romanesco, gnocci, and hangar steak. Great date place!",,,
138,Amy L.,"New York, NY",0,23,3,2.0,6/30/2015,"After reading the reviews of this new restaurant, I had high hopes but sadly they were put to rest.  The space is very tight.  It seems they crammed as many tables in there as possible so the result is that you are dining about 3 inches from the next table and the tables themselves are small.  We each got a glass of wine to start - decent pour.  No bread, olives or anything is offered prior to the meal. The apps were a decent size. I had the caramelized romanesco which was very good.  My wife had the oyster ceviche which was also very good.  The problem we had was with the entrees; very small portions.  The striped bass we ordered was decent but was only about 3 ozs. The roasted duck breast was good but minuscule. We didn't order dessert.  We got the impression that everyone from the hostess to the waitstaff thought they were working in a fine dining establishment when clearly, they are not.  The food is fine but not great, doesn't even begin to ""wow"".  Given the price point to portion size, along with the uncomfortable seating, we will not be returning.",4,,
139,Gabriela N.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",68,53,2,5.0,12/23/2015,Everything was excellent from the shrimp and duck app to the steak and bass entrees. Also had the sticky toffee dessert yummy! Make sure to get the potato side which was beyond ~ I want a bucket and so was the Brussel sprouts.,,,
140,V G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,2,5.0,1/13/2016,"I'm a bit biased, because this is the restaurant where I got engaged, but the food is magnificent. It's a great spot for a romantic meal and the service is terrific. If anything could be added, a nice touch would be to add bread or olives to the tables when you sit down, to enjoy with your cocktails while perusing the menu. The ginger cocktail was fabulous I had there last time.",,,
141,Jenny K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,98,57,4.0,2/25/2016,The restaurant is far east in Alphabet City so I was hesitant about going. I'm so glad I did because I had a great time! The food is delicious and the ambiance is really fun and casual. It is a bit loud but fun. They don't have a liquor license so they make wine-based cocktails which are delicious. Their infamous burger is only served at the bar though so sit at the bar if you wanna try it.,,,
142,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",175,20,5,5.0,11/21/2015,Delicious! We had the duck and cuttle appetizers and the scallops and hanger steak as the main. Everything was perfectly cooked! The only thing I didn't love was the cuttlefish.,,,
143,Cheryl L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,5.0,8/19/2015,"The dishes were fantastic, and the price relatively reasonable for this high level of cooking. I went with a group of 4, and we were able to taste almost everything on the menu.  What stood out for me was the smoked salmon, the sweet corn risotto and divers scallop!  Will return.",1,,
144,Rachel K.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,1,5.0,7/25/2015,"I dined here earlier this week and from the service to the food it was an overall great experience. My friend and I started with the scallops which were cooked perfectly. We also both enjoyed a nice beverage from Stillwater brewing..the beer selection consisted of quality craft beers from the east coast. For our entree, I had the stripped bass and my friend had the steak and both were excellent. We skipped dessert but had a great espresso to top it off! I will be coming back!",1,,
145,Ethan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",178,62,5,5.0,6/20/2015,"I am totally a fan. Walked in and was super impressed by the casual elegance. I came here with a friend I haven't seen in a long time and we were both dressed casually, but I could definitely see taking my wife here for date night too. Service was excellent -- on point without being over bearing. We both had appetizers -- I had a romanescu salad and my friend had grilled oysters. Excellent -- especially my salad. My friend had gnocchi and I had scallops for our mains. Perfectly cooked with a sear on the outside and juicy on the inside. We had roasted mushrooms and mashed potatoes as sides -- the mushrooms are so hearty it was almost like having meat. Delish. Desserts were terrific too. One nit is that they don't have a full liquor license...oh well, we had to stick with their excellent and unusual selection of beers (and I had a great glass of Chardonnay with the scallops.) Overall -- a great place -- these guys are upping the game on Avenue C.",,,
146,Steve H.,"New York, NY",1,22,0,5.0,7/16/2015,Wonderful charming spot with excellent cuisine. Went for anniversary dinner ... Had the sweet corn risotto to start and split the hanger steak with chorizo and the striped bass. All three of the plates were amazing with nuanced flavor profiles. Reasonably priced wine bottle and thoughtful service made it a great night,,,
147,Heather O.,"Long Island City, NY",66,1,0,5.0,5/20/2015,"My experience dining at Virginia's was very enjoyable. For a new restaurant, they really have their act together. The waitstaff was pleasant, attentive and informative about the menu. The service was great. The atmosphere was relaxing and the decor was nice. The drinks selections were good, especially the wine list. But the main attraction - the food - was simply fantastic. Fresh ingredients combined in innovative ways bursting with flavor. Really top quality. I highly recommend eating here!",,,
148,Amy W.,"Kennett Square, PA",0,2,0,4.0,2/22/2016,"We visited Manhattan for a couple days from Philadelphia to see a show and enjoy New York. I was looking for a small casual restaurant with good food without pretense. I found Virginias and made a reservation for my boyfriend and me. At the last minute my "" New yorkophile"" friend wanted to join. The restaurant changed our reservation for 7:00 to three people no problem. When we got to the restaurant the two long rows of squished tables were EMPTY. not a sole. Being responsible for picking the place I panicked and really thought about leaving but we sat down. The menu is small but diverse. The wine list is very interesting and accessible. We picked out three wines and then asked the sommelier for a recommendation, he was great and we settled on a wonderful Carignon. My friends had the scallops and I had the fish special. It was a TERRIFIC meal! I cannot recommend this place too much. Oh yeah, half hour after we got there EVERY TABLE was filled.",,,
