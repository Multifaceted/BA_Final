0,,5/23/2018,0,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Karl F.,0.0,5.0,1,"Billy's Hot Dog Cart is the best - probably one of the friendliest vendors in NYC and he has the best deals I've seen!  I live in the neighborhood and took my 2 nieces and my nephew while they were visiting from out of town.  He engaged all of them in friendly conversation and even threw in some free candy and a Snapple for the kids!  Never happens in NYC...Best deal I've seen for a hot dog ($1.50) and sausage ($2).  Walk across the street into the park and expect to pay double.Thanks Billy, will definitely return.",3
1,,11/19/2018,73,,"Plano, TX",Jessica O.,1,5.0,12,"Billy is great! My husband and I were walking through Central Park and decided we wanted a NYC hot dog. We read the reviews and even though it was quite a walk, it was totally worth it! The hot dogs were delicious and at a great price compared to the other mediocre carts we had been too. Billy asked us where we were from and talked to us for a while. He was so kind and a joy to talk to! I would recommend this one a hundred times over and we will probably go back before we head home!",

No wonder people return to his cart again and again. Bill is the best.",1
4,,7/9/2018,0,,"Truckee, CA",Regina C.,1,5.0,2,"Billy was super cool and nice! I had a  conversation with him. He was so generous with my FRESH pretzel and ice cold Gatorade. If you ask me, Billy and his hot dog cart are the best in the city! Go there!",1
5,,10/27/2017,9,,"San Diego, CA",Jenny C.,6,5.0,6,"First time in New York and I had to get a hotdog off a cart.  While walking with a friend through Central Park I notice the beautiful blue and yellow umbrella to the right. We had to stop. We cross the street and I could smell the freshly carted meat in the stand. I was scared to order as I have never ordered a hotdog from the carts before. But Billy was amazing and was super helpful in giving me my order quickly and efficiently. He was so nice and when he thought I was short changed, he almost gave me a deal. I had the correct amount, and the hotdog was delicious. It completely exceeded my expectations and I would love to eat another one of his hotdogs. For $1.50, what a New York steal!What a pleasant start to my day, and I can't wait to return, to both New York and this hotdog stand.",3

8,,1/4/2018,0,,"Chino Hills, CA",Brandon A.,0,5.0,3,Billy's hot dogs are the best deal in all of New York! Spent all week looking for a worthy hot dog place and we finally found it. $1.5 got dogs where everywhere else is $4 and up. Such a nice guy even hooked me up with a free drink and some M&Ms. Highly recommend!,2
9,,8/3/2017,9,,"Manhattan, NY",R And D M.,0,5.0,66,"Jumping on the bandwagon and leaving 5-stars.  On the walk to my son's pediatrician, we stopped for a 'dirty dog' based upon the Yelp reviews.  What a pleasant and enjoyable experience.  Billy is a very nice guy, and his hot dogs were very good.  He is also very accommodating--I like my mustard and onions placed in the bun before the hot dog (as opposed to being on top of the dog) and he had no issues with my eating style.  Also, the prices are very reasonable for a quality dog, and much less than in Central Park.",1
10,,9/10/2017,1,1,"New York, NY",Lisa S.,0,5.0,37,"Best hot dogs in NYC. Nicest vendor and a really good person.  Billy is a neighborhood icon. Even has fresh pretzels, a real rarity these days!",
11,,10/8/2017,0,,"Austin, TX",mark m.,0,5.0,37,Saw the fantastic reviews of other Yelpers so we gave Billy a try. My first dirty water dog in NYC and it was a great experiene. What a nice man and he has 1.50 NYC dogs. If you want a great hot dog give Billy some business and take your dogs across the street and experience Central Park with your delicious treats. Can't wait to have more dogs when I go back to NYC!!!,

17,,1/1/2017,0,,"Astoria, NY",Renny B.,0,5.0,6,Nothing better than a street dog here at Billy's Hot Dog Cart. Delicious hot dogs and pretzels. Billy the Owner of the Cart is super nice. Come try it out,
18,1,7/15/2011,575,,"Brooklyn, NY",Neil B.,1097,5.0,983,"$1.00 for a delicious ""dirty water"" hot dog.  Billy is a gentleman originally from Greece who has been selling hot dogs on this corner across from Central Park for years. He works to stay busy, so making money is no longer his top priority. If only the ride from southern Brooklyn to upper Manhattan was not so long :-(Update 2013: Price is now $1.25 per dog but still the best deal in town!Update 2015: Dogs are now $1.50 but he has a buy 2 dogs and a soda for $3.00 deal that can't be beat!",3
19,,7/5/2015,49,,"Manhattan, NY",James M.,0,5.0,9,"My go-to Hot Dog stand. With the serious shortage of food along Central Park West, this is a diamond among them. Awesome, friendly service from Billy, a chatty Greek guy who keeps up with current events. And the PRICES! The prices are amazing! $3 for 2 ""dirty water"" hot dogs with whatever you want on them, plus a can soda. That's the same price as 1 hot dog right across the street in Central Park! He also offers a variety of chips and candy. Best hot dog cart I've been to in the city by far.",1
