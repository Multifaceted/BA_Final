0,Darren Y.,"Syosset, NY",427,102,22,5.0,9/30/2018,"One of the coolest stores I've been to. Kinokuniya has three floors, each selling various things for different kinds of people. This is primarily a bookstore, but there are also artist tools, toys, snacks, and so forth.The middle floor has mostly general Japanese books. The bottom floor has artist tools, kids books, nonfiction books, supplies, and so forth. The top floor is my favorite floor, which includes a cafe (offering a bunch of snacks, meals, and drinks, as well as seating if you're having a hangout there for a bit) and a ton of manga/graphic novels/figurines. Here, you will find both popular manga and manga that you've never heard of before if you're looking for something new.Overall, fantastic and versatile place for people who have an interest in Japanese culture. Definitely check this place out if you're nearby.",,,
1,Angie G.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,8,3,3.0,10/13/2018,"Before all else I would like to say as one that works in an art store I LOVE Kinokuniya's selection of various stationary and gifts. The art books are also a huge joy and I've been a frequent customer for over 7 years.However the past 2 times I have visited another treat I adore is their cafe upstairs. The food is always neat, delicious and unique. After purchasing some food and a boba tea to go I was immediately scolded*, not asked by a security guard to leave because I had food while already on the way to the downstairs level to exit. I recommend this location so much but now I'm worried this stern approach will not work for myself or others I suggest the shop to. It's embarassing and uncomfortable to be followed downstairs for food I purchased within the same location. While I understand wanting to protect merchandise, this is certainly not the way to go about it. Summary: Great Selection; Clean and Organized Product yet Overbearing/Rude Security.",,,
2,Sarah M.,"Manhattan, NY",7,10,1,2.0,10/9/2018,"They have a good stock of a lot of items, and plenty of cute knickknacks but the past few times I've been have resulted in poor customer service. On one visit, while searching for a specific book, the representatives on the floor were passive, dismissive, and more interested in keeping a conversation with each other than answering a simple question about stock. I asked about an author I was having trouble finding and the response consisted of a descriptive account of how the wording of my question was wrong and that if I didn't see it, it wasn't there. The most recent visit consisted of being told to throw out my drink, which was the reason for my stopping in, or leave when I stopped on my way out to look at a book on display. Mind you, this man ran from the front of the store and then followed me to make sure I left. I really want to like this place, but being left with a bad taste after two consecutive visits is very dissuading. TL;DR: stock is great, customer service is seriously lacking",1,,
3,Sakiko E.,"Torrance, CA",8,67,186,4.0,9/29/2018,"Stylish Japanese bookstore that comes with the variety of Japanese/English books (including store picks to manga), quality Japanese stationary goods, unique Japanese gifts, and the relaxing cafe.You can come here for a quick exposure to the Japanese cultures or unique books in Japanese. There is a public bathroom too. You can get a book or magazine and walk over to Bryant park and read there too.They cover most categories but it's not a big bookstore. I say they go for a quality over quantity. Their selection of Japanese magazines downstairs makes you feel like you're in Japan!  As for the stationary section, I could not locate the frixion pen ink refills of the color I like but I can see myself picking up random fun stationary goods if I come here more often. I also loved the waza store located downstairs featuring very unique Japanese items that seem suitable for gifts. You can smell newly arrived Japanese essential oils if you lift the glass bowls. Some woody blends were so pleasant! I'm excited to check out this place again.",,,
4,Hyuna L.,"Queens, NY",2,50,32,4.0,8/1/2018,"Even though this Kinokuniya is right in NY, it really feels like a Japanese bookstore. The first floor is mainly English books, the second floor has Cafe Zaiya and a manga, and the basement level has stationery, magazines, and a very huge variety of Japanese books.The bottom level has a small store (The Waza Store) that sells authentic Japanese products, such as furoshiki and cute pins. Although the products were beautiful, most of them were incredibly expensive... also the woman working there was a bit too pushy. I told her that I was only there to look (especially after I saw the prices of the products), however, she kept following me and talking to me about the products and the prices and whatnot... I felt like I was being pressured so I left. The bottom level also sells stationary. Notebooks, cards, clear file folders, stamps, pens, pencils, binders, origami paper, you name it. They even sell those cute craft kits (that let you make tiny animals) that you can buy in Japan! Every time I come here, the stationary section at the bottom level is ridiculously packed. That's how much people love coming here to see the cute stationary!!The second floor (the top floor) has a cute little cafe called Cafe Zaiya. They sell a variety of sandwiches, bento boxes, pastries, and sushi. You can also order coffee or tea here. Right outside the cafe, the second floor mainly has manga as well as other various knick knacks, such as Studio Ghibli merchandise and Funko figures.I have to say though... this store is very expensive. It would be accurate to say that for the things sold here, they charge about 150%-175% of the price in Japan. For example, a book that is worth 1400 yen in Japan (about $13-14 USD) sells for about $22-24 here. I understand that it must cost quite a lot to ship books from Japan to the US... I have tried to order books from online vendors such as CDJapan (that charge for shipping by weight) and even ordering one magazine (work 500-600 yen) would rack up at least a $10 shipping charge... but for some of these books, I would rather just purchase them from Amazon Japan.",2,,
5,Emily W.,"Forest Hills, NY",69,111,762,5.0,6/20/2018,"Kinokuniya is a great book store to hide away from the business and chaotic tourist environment. I always come here when I need a break from work. As a stationary fanatic, I love going to basement. Cute notebooks, cute pens, pencils, folders, binders, cards, stamps, toys, and so on, they have everything here. I also enjoy browsing the books on the first floor. I especially enjoy skimming through the many Japanese books that have been translated into English. Lastly, the second floor is pure anime heaven. From books to anime merch, you will lose track of time walking around. The cafe also offers a great selection of drinks and food.",4,,
6,Nico B.,"New York, NY",90,44,139,5.0,9/15/2018,"Kinokuniya is a cool store. For those who are fans of everything Japanese, this is your place -- but even for those of us just looking for a unique or interesting experience, this place has a lot to offer! The main (middle/ground) floor has a variety of general books, Japanese cultural books, and odd-but-funny novelty items. For the generalists, this floor may be the only place that peaks your interest.The top floor has a cafe with Japanese-oriented snack and meal items (which didn't look too appetizing to me, but is a nice convenience if you want a place to sit down). The top floor also houses a massive manga, comic, graphic novel, anime, and related-novelty selection. You'll find all of your mainstream favorites here, but also some fringe series for those of you who go delve beyond the popular stuff. The bottom floor has Japanese-related cookware, clothes, and of course, books--tons of Japanese books. This floor will likely mean the most to those can can read Japanese, otherwise it probably won't have much to offer the non-speaker.Overall, this is a cool shop that succeeds at everything it aims to. The cafe could be better, but its a great offering nonetheless. Recommended!",2,,
7,Paul B.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",12,228,102,5.0,8/20/2018,"TL;DR - A taste of Japanese culture in NYC, but also just a great store all round.We came here on our visit to NYC because our last long haul trip was to Tokyo, and since we loved it so much we thought it would be nice to see a slice of Japanese culture in the big apple.First thing to note - although it's a ""Japanese"" store, they sell lots of books in English so the language barrier isn't a reason to skip this place. The ground floor is essentially like any other good quality independent book store full of nice titles and gifts. The top floor is then devoted to manga, and also features a small coffee shop. The basement has lots of gifts and crafts, and this is where most of the Japanese (and Chinese) literature can be found.The store is gorgeous and full of wonderful finds.

I'm sure I'm not the only person with books in my bag, yet I was stopped. Others were allowed to leave with no issue. We were the only black people in the store at the time. We were just in Book Off with other shopping bags, and they were polite, greeting us both times upon entrance and exit. I will be sure to spend my money at their store instead, going forward.I hope someone stole something and walked out as we were being profiled. Serves them right. I would have been less incensed had the jerk apologized. Customer service goes a long way.",11,1,

I was chased out of the store by a very rude, loud, and overbearing security guard for having a sealed beverage container in my hand. I left and went to Barnes and Noble on 5th and bought the same books (for cheaper), and no one said a word about the water bottle I carried in.I won't shop here until this security guard is gone or told to calm down a bit. I can't believe the store is letting this guy be the first impression for customers entering the store.",1,,
13,Isabelle L.,"San Francisco Bay, CA",16,164,83,5.0,9/16/2018,This is my go-to place for gifts. They are cute and creative. It sparkle ideas and it's more of a museum than shop to me. They have great coverage for Japanese comic books if you are also a big fan like me. However most of the text comes in Japanese and so it could be harder for non-Japanese readers. They have a little coffee/cake place inside and I'll try it next time.,,,
14,Luan P.,"Philadelphia, PA",189,233,2168,5.0,10/2/2017,"This is a dream come true for those who love manga and comics. Kinokuniya is the most comprehensive Asian book/manga store in the East coast. I often order books from here but this was the first time I visit the store in person.The store is split up to three different floors. The lower level offer souvenirs like hand made bags from Japan and Japanese novels and magazines. The ground floor is your English books, and they are set up like Barnes and Nobles or Borders. There is something for everyone here. The heart of Kinokuniya however, is on the top floor, where all the manga and anime stuff is at.The manga are divided into two sections, one for English reader and the other, authentic Japanese imported manga. There are whole collections of series and boxed set that will make any collectors smile. They also offer anime art books and toys and DVD and blu ray. There is a small coffee shop upstairs for those who like to enjoy some drinks or snacks while reading.This is the bookstore to check out, especially if you are already exploring New York.

It's part of a Japanese book store chain, and the prices are hiked up in comparison to Japan, but it's worth it with all the great finds here.The store is divided into three floors. The second floor has manga (English and Japanese), CDs, art books, and a cafe. The main floor has English books.The bottom floor is where all of the best things are. There is a wealth of Japanese language novels, and if there is a novel you are interested in that they don't have, the staff can order it from their Japanese locations and send it to you. Everyone here is very helpful.There are also Japanese language learning books on this floor, including JLPT study books.I highly recommend Kinokuniya for all of your Japanese novel needs.",1,,1

The main, street-level floor functions as a normal bookstore, while the upper level is more dedicated to anime and manga and associated merchandise, in both English and Japanese. The basement, accessible only by elevator, is my personal favorite part of the store, filled with a wide variety of books in Japanese, as well as stationery, magazines, crafts...

22,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1269,914,4.0,3/9/2018,"Located right across the street from beautiful Bryant Park, Kinokuniya is a bookstore specializing in Japanese publications and more.  I had visited a couple times before with friends, but to be honest it was not until my most recent visit that I really paid much attention to what the store had to offer.  When you first walk in you are immediately greeted by a virtual tidal wave of Japanese books.  Turn and you'll see the cashier area with display cases that have (among other things) a unicorn tape dispenser and a pencil holder shaped like a building in Soho.  Keep walking and you will see books on a variety of topics from fiction to feminism to (no joke) war.  Towards the back are a series of cute, blind boxed collectible toys.Want to see more?  Head downstairs (via stairs lined with books of cats with various objects on their heads) and you get to a magazine section.  Near that is a reading area and a section with ridiculously cute erasers in the form of sushi, emergency vehicles and more.  There is a lot to see and browse through in this store, and it all comes off as terribly charming.I had come to Kinokuniya to see if they could help me obtain a magazine from Japan that I had not been able to find online.  When I went to the information desk the young lady there was super helpful.  I was expecting speculative looks or just a gentle brush off.  Instead as I pulled up the cover of the magazine on my phone and showed it to her she looked at it and got right down to business tapping away at her computer trying to find it.  And she did.Minutes later she had ordered the magazine for me and taken down my contact information.  No down payment necessary.  A week later, the magazine showed up and I picked it up from the cashier.  It was one of the smoothest ""preorder/pickup"" experiences I have had.  I highly recommend Kinokuniya for any Japanese books or magazines you may be looking for.",1,,1

Maybe they don't get paid much or something, but it just never felt welcoming the last 10+ times I've been here.

I would classify all their comics as 'reader' copies since they are organized very half haphazardly and without boards to support the comics. All of the comics suffer from spine damage because of this. Whoever is responsible for the organization of the comics is doing it wrong. Comics are MEANT to be read and perused through.

The ground floor had a lot of regular books that I didn't really bother looking at, since I was mostly on the lookout for manga/anime. But there were a few cat photo books that caught my eye. If only I could have bought them all!Finally, the bottom floor had a lot of stationery/pretty collectibles from Japan. I was very tempted by some of the little showpieces and snowglobes. I passed on them this time, but given I'm still thinking about them a few days later, I'll definitely need to come back and buy them next time.Overall there is such a large unique selection of products at Kinokuniya, far more than I ever expected to find. It ended up being the highlight of my NYC birthday trip, and I can't wait to come back.",1,,1

41,Katrina M.,"Bronx, NY",155,35,55,4.0,8/11/2017,"My friend introduced me to this place a few years ago and I haven't stopped coming here since. It is located directly across one of the sides of Bryant Park.Not only does it house an EXTENSIVE Japanese manga section but it also provides plenty of books for all your needs, from fashion to NYC tour guidebooks. One of my favorite things about Kinokuniya is that they also sell really nifty knickknacks: boxed toys, unique home decor and sassy wallets amongst the many miscelleanous products they sell outside of their book collection. If you're into purchasing collectibles, they have a lot of anime collectibles available for purchase that were imported from Japan and Southeast Asia.There's a cafe upstairs also and none of the employees from my experience have been sticklers about how long you stay in the cafe. Kinokuniya is a great book store; it is well organized, neat and unique. I highly recommend coming here especially if you adore Japanese culture--this is the place for YOU!",1,,1

I was so happy when I saw that they had the whole collection of InuYasha manga in the Vizbig collection. I did find some InuYasha DVD's but they were super duper duper overpriced ($50+, at Half priced books or amazon you can find it for less than $20). I really enjoyed coming here.",,,

It's crowded, but the crowd is not too polite. The bathroom is covered with graffiti, which could be cute, if it weren't that the whole store feels like it's lower now so the graffiti feels like a sign of decay instead of a style.They still have a good selection of Japanese books and other Japanese items. There used to be a lot more of a Japanese history and other Japanese book selection. Now much of the store is given over to the same sort of American books you'd find in any other independent NYC bookstore.

I picked up a Pusheen plush keychain for ($10).The staff are all very nice, they also have an info desk if you need help with anything on the bottom level. Regarding the bottom level, the aisles are a little cramped- if you have crutches or a wheelchair, it may be a little cumbersome to get around. What's nice about this bookstore is that they have Cafe Zaiya on the 2nd level, so after you get tired/hungry browsing the store, you can grab a bite to eat!

I didn't get to check out the basement and first floor as much as the top/second floor, but otakus would love the second floor and may even purchase something. For casual fans, the prices are higher than one may expect, especially branded products like Studio Ghibli merch, but it is worth it to take a look around this floor to see what's new since you may find a new manga you want to read, albeit from another cheaper source.

I can be in there for hours. It can get a little overwhelming because there's just tons to see. It's also pricey, but all worth it. If you haven't been here, take a visit. You'll enjoy it.

57,Igor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,142,0,1.0,2/22/2018,"One of my friends had this happen to themLet me start off by saying that Kinokuniya is one of the cutest bookstores and I love browsing the selection of books (and snacks) during my lunch break. That being said... I was in there a few days ago (with an unopened bag of popcorn that I had just purchased from CVS) browsing different sections. I was in the cooking section looking for a perfect birthday gift for my beer-loving friend, then went downstairs to the first floor to check out the fun trinkets. I didn't really find anything suitable so I decided to leave. As I was coming up the stairs, I zipped up my coat and threw my hood on as I was leaving the front door to prepare myself for the outside cold. Within seconds of exiting, I hear a voice calling out ""Excuse me!"" At first, I didn't respond as I did not think it was directed towards me, then I hear it again, so I turn around and see the store owner (I recognize him from previous times I've been in the store), the security guard and another worker behind them still inside the store but peeking their heads out the door. The security guard motions me towards them and asks to check my pockets. Now, this is my gut reaction because I was so shocked - but I showed them that I had taken nothing from their store - but in retrospect, I should not have obliged so quickly. They had absolutely no reason to suspect me for theft... aside from the fact that I was carrying a bag of popcorn -which they do not sell in the store! Upon seeing that I was INNOCENT, they shook their heads and 'dismissed' me. Not even an apology. I felt extremely embarrassed and humiliated for being treated this way and wandered off in shock. It was extremely rude of everyone at Kinokuniya and I feel to have at least been provided reason of suspicion or an apology. Do not go in this store unless you like to be treated improperly and spend money on overpriced items.",7,,

A different employee was flat out rude to me and my sister during two separate visits. A young women that was working at 7pm today was extremely rude and lied to us about the products in stock. The first time we were in the store, she told us the Love Live keychains were sold out, which is acceptable but she didn't even check the item tables to make sure. A few hours later we came back and a different woman working there found the keychains in one minute. On a separate day I asked her where the Yuri on Ice keychains are and she said they were sold out in a rude tone. She didn't check this time either.  My sister checked some drawers and the rude employee told her to stop because it was staff only. My sister said she was looking because last time when she said they were sold out, there were several boxes in the drawers. In response, the employee lied, saying she said before that the keychains were ""in inventory"" and not sold out.On our way out of the store she told my sister to follow her. We thought she was going to help but instead she brought her to a drawer and said ""it says staff only. That means hands off."" I understand that we shouldn't have gone through the drawers but the employee never looked for the keychains herself.

I was looking for a particular item I couldn't find in San Francisco's Kinokuniya (which is larger but hella disorganized; two young women took 20 minutes to find a journal I was looking for because they needed to search it out on the computer instead of actually just finding it on the magazine rack). I asked a young numbskull Asian worker guy downstairs whether they had the product and he said, ""Uh, no."" THEN I FOUND THE PRODUCT two aisles down. I confronted him about it and he shrugged and said, ""Okay...."" Useless. Don't work in a place if you're as competent as a geoduck on ice. Then when I went to pay upstairs, this young white woman was the cashier and she does not even greet the customers. Even after I said hello, she just acted like she was in an airport hangar with headphones on to drown out the sonic blast. Seriously, does she know anything about Japanese service conventions? There was a Middle-Eastern guy behind me and he also had the greeting-less service and cold-to-neutral treatment; I peered at him as I was leaving and he looked puzzled too.

Updated review","I definitely need to update my last review (from 2013) since so many things have changed since then.Namely, their security policies are much different.  Back in the day before they changed buildings in the 2000s (anyone else remember when they were one large floor with an upper balcony area for stationery?) security was relaxed without people hovering around constantly.  At some point after they moved, it was simply awful and I was constantly followed and harassed.  They also had an extremely strict policy regarding photography in the store.  (If you were caught, you'd be chewed out immediately).When I went back to visit several times this year, I noticed there was only one security guard who thankfully no longer stalks people throughout the store.  I also noticed that photography is now allowed as long as you're polite and don't bother other customers.  Yay!As for the goods?  The same quality merchandise as usual.  The ONLY thing I really miss that they changed over the years, is their music section.  When the West Nyack store was open, both locations had a really fantastic J-pop area.  It was small but the music they carried was diverse and up to date with new releases.  With the move, the section dwindled and with the exception of Vocaloid and Love Live cds, nothing's really current.  I was hoping they would have changed this.. but alas, disappointment.  Granted there's a Book-off close but it's not ideal for new releases, either.Their selection of magazines and is still awesome!  They also carry a somewhat up to date selection of idol related photo books.  The prices are upcharged but hey, it's to be expected. Still a Kino fan after all these years!Also, I had no idea until I noticed a small sign, but the elevator actually does take you to the top floor if you request assistance for those with baby carriages or disabilities.",3,,

87,Myron F.,"Webster, TX",0,6,6,5.0,6/19/2018,This is my 3rd day in NY and out of all the other places I've been so far this is definitely my all time favorite!!,,,
88,Matt L.,"New York, NY",113,544,548,3.0,8/1/2016,"Kinokuniya is in kind of an odd place, considering it's next to bank of America and all these other major corporate offices. Despite this, the actual place is pretty cool. There are three floors: a basement level, with a lot of gifts and other items that you can as souvenirs, a ground floor where you can buy regular, English books, and an upstairs level, where there is a cafe, and manga. There is manga in Japanese and English, though there is obviously much more English stuff than there is Japanese. This place is great, because there are just so many things you can do here. The cafe is a little bit lackluster from some of the actual Japanese cafes in Tokyo and whatnot- you can't order food, but they have a few premade foods that you can buy from the fridge, such as onigiris and breads. The cafe also serves coffee and tea so that's good. The seating area is a little crowded and jam packed so there's basically zero privacy. I wouldn't recommend it if you wanted to have a chat with someone, but it's okay for just sitting down.The book section on the ground floor is pretty unremarkable from the standpoint of being a bookstore in NYC, and the selection isn't very wide. Most people come here for the manga on the upstairs floor. The problem with this place though is that they plastic wrap all their books, so you can't actually read any of them until you buy the book. It's kind of a shitty move, but I understand why they do it. I have to say that this is the best collection of manga and manga related products that I've seen in America, so their collection is pretty decent. You can also buy posters and dvds, things like that. I think they also have some apparel as well, though I didn't take a lot of time to look.Overall, an interesting place if you're already into Japanese popular culture. If not, it's just an average bookstore with a mediocre cafe upstairs.",1,1,2

I especially enjoy their Cafe Zaiya upstairs , they have a good mix of snacks like their onigiri , assortment of buns/ bread/ and their pre-made microwaveable meals ( my favorite is the chicken katsu over rice.I spend most of my time browsing their comic sections and they also have a decent anime / manga department on the second floor. They have a nice display of Kotobukiya statues and a humongous Funko pop collection as well.

94,Tom G.,"Rutherford, NJ",167,218,2224,4.0,4/9/2016,"In Manhattan If you are north of Chinatown, finding any Asian books or gift shop is close to impossible with this city's  urban labyrinth of buildings and people. Lucky for me that I am near this little gen of a Asian variety store across the street from Bryant Park .I'm a window shopper at heart and one of my favorite eye candies is to see cute Chinese and Japanese gift items, dolls, craft, tea pots, I personal have a extensive collection of dragons and foo dogs. At least with Kinokuniya I can satisfy some of those cravings for Japanese oriented heritage items even if it's mainstay is books.  The store is pretty big but dense and has a few areas where yo can sit and read.  The store spans three floors including the basement level. Kinokuniya is not just a book store and is really comprised from smaller stores inside vs departments.The first floor has mostly books and magazines like fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, and art books, many of them you can find in English so you don't have to know Japanese to come here. Not everything is stored  on shelves, they are display stands and coffee tables with items for sell including some of the more collector books, And they also have events, book reading, signing, music and other small get together with listings for upcoming events at the entranceOn the second floor there is a and small cafe, Zaiya, with cold and hot food and drinks but they are closer to snackes size portions. So this is not a spot to get a big lunch and be waited on. The second floor also also a massive manga and anime section mostly imported from Japan of books, and has models and and collector figurines.The basement is my favorite part of the store and were you most likely find me at browsing around. This floor has crafting supplies, cute stuff and plastic knick knacks, figurines, plushies, paper,  crafts, decorating items, music boxes, anime, manga, blind boxes, art books, stationery, pens, pencils, Asian notebooks, washi and chiyogami, origami paper. and gift cards. There is just to much to list and yes more books.This is were I got the tiny lucky cats, and pandas that I give to favorite buddies. There is even another side store in the basement called Wasa, with upscale wallets, shirts, tea pots, bags, etc. The price range range at Kinokuniya are from a less than a dollar to $80 or more for items. You can also find a bargain or two but this place is not a discount store.I make it a point to come here every few weeks since they don't do a lot of changes on the items, usefully they wait for something to be sold out before bringing in something new to replace it. If you are ever near midtown Bryant Park, I say you should check Kinokuniya out, even if you don't buy something now a time will come when that perfect gift idea will bring you here.",2,4,6

96,Alice F.,"New York, NY",103,32,0,1.0,2/22/2018,"Let me start off by saying that Kinokuniya is one of the cutest bookstores and I love browsing the selection of books (and snacks) during my lunch break. That being said... I was in there a few days ago (with an unopened bag of popcorn that I had just purchased from CVS) browsing different sections. I was in the cooking section looking for a perfect birthday gift for my beer-loving friend, then went downstairs to the first floor to check out the fun trinkets. I didn't really find anything suitable so I decided to leave. As I was coming up the stairs, I zipped up my coat and threw my hood on as I was leaving the front door to prepare myself for the outside cold. Within seconds of exiting, I hear a voice calling out ""Excuse me!"" At first, I didn't respond as I did not think it was directed towards me, then I hear it again, so I turn around and see the store owner (I recognize him from previous times I've been in the store), the security guard and another worker behind them still inside the store but peeking their heads out the door. The security guard motions me towards them and asks to check my pockets. Now, this is my gut reaction because I was so shocked - but I showed them that I had taken nothing from their store - but in retrospect, I should not have obliged so quickly. They had absolutely no reason to suspect me for theft... aside from the fact that I was carrying a bag of popcorn -which they do not sell in the store! Upon seeing that I was INNOCENT, they shook their heads and 'dismissed' me. Not even an apology. I felt extremely embarrassed and humiliated for being treated this way and wandered off in shock. It was extremely rude of everyone at Kinokuniya and I feel to have at least been provided reason of suspicion or an apology. Do not go in this store unless you like to be treated improperly and spend money on overpriced items.",2,,

(Which was back when I was in grade school just an FYI. So my knowledge with this company stemmed back from when I dealt with overbearing parents)I've always struggled with how difficult it is to learn Japanese from an ""American"" standpoint. Most people think I'm mixed race, so I often times have fluent Japanese speakers talk to me in their native dialect. (Regional differences are obvious when you've worked at enough Japanese companies. For example, people from Osaka are stereo typically known for having a southern drawl that Southern Americans are known for having.) Often times, I would feel horrid for not being able to help travelers/tourists since I know how difficult it is to be Asian-American in a society where people expect you to be ""fluent"" in English and to ""drop your accent."" (Which is inherently racist, by the way.) From the moment I watched Pokemon, Digimon, Gundam, Rurouni Kenshin and Cowboy Bebop on the Toonami television block...I knew I wanted to excel in one of the most difficult languages known to me. I grew up learning 2-3 languages when I was a kid, so Japanese naturally was one of the languages I wanted to somehow ""master."" But the truth of the matter is: Japanese is not a language anyone can ever master. Everyday, just like the English language, new words/characters/slang is being embedded into a very fast-paced cross cultural world. Kinokuniya's store is at the heart of when I consider Midtown Manhattan/Broadway/Times Square area so during peak hours, it is near impossible to navigate. But I just like to think I'm in some Murakami novel and make it hilarious for myself and patrons when I literally can't get by some weebs. (a.k.a. Kids that shout out KO-KNEE-CHI-WAHHH while subsequently ruining the speech/writing piece I was recording.) The staff has changed vastly throughout the years, but one thing remains, is that my love for learning has never diminished when I graduated college. If anything, Kinokuniya has helped me realized my passion for teaching and learning in a world where people can only look down on Asian-American woman for being supposedly ""weak"" or ""passive."" (These are phrases I've constantly heard as a former server/host/barista/etc) This is probably the longest review/letter I've ever written to any company/book store on yelp but there are a few college friends of mine that have grown into the best teachers I've seen because of their dedication to learning.

I never had a need to return an item until today. I purchased a Star Wars English-Japanese Dictionary mistaking it as being aimed at English speakers learning Japanese when in fact it is for Japanese speakers learning English.Upon trying to return the dictionary and receive a refund, I was told that the store does not give refunds but only store credit or exchange for another item. That's an unsatisfactory and unpopular policy given that books can be attained and returned at Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and other bookstores around NYC and at cheaper prices. This policy gives the impression that holding on to customer's money is the priority rather than ensuring repeat business from customer. On this policy alone I would recommend others buy their products elsewhere.This experience adds to the disappointment at finding that Kinokuniya does not carry Japanese language calendars or planners. English language calendars and planners can be attained at any regular bookstore. One expects to find Japanese items at a Japanese specialized bookstore.It saddens me still that Asahiya Bookstore is gone and this experience makes me miss them all the more. Asahiya was a better and customer friendlier bookstore with a wider range of products. Similar to the old Book-Off near the central library, you were always greeted cheerfully at Asahiya.After the move to Bryant Park, Kinokuniya seems to have engaged in having security guards racially profile and trail certain customers also.

Downstairs level contains all 日本語 without translations. They also have nice selection of school and office supplies, diaries and gift ideas with vendors offering other crafts and things.

Every time I've been here, I've only intended to kill a few minutes by browsing the shelf of Japanese novels, but always, without fail, I end up spending an hour wandering through all three floors.You'll find a treasure trove of both classic and popular Japanese fiction on the main floor. There is no better place that I know of in Manhattan to buy Japanese lit. There is also a huge selection of manga and anime on the third floor. You'll also find regular fiction / non-fiction, which you can normally browse in B&N and other bookstores. Price-wise, I don't think this is a steal, but it's not more expensive either.While you could easily spend all your time on the main floor, don't forget the basement and the third floor. The basement is mainly dedicated to Japanese-language books and periodicals. It also has a lot of Japanese-style gifts: notebooks, pens, little imitation sushi erasers, et cetera et cetera. So kawaii. It's easy to end up buying a handful of ""gifts.""Stop by the third floor for a snack / meal / drink at Cafe Zaiya.

While we were perusing the downstairs section, we came across a section of japanese socks. We we're getting a gift for my sister-in-law and thought the socks would be a nice add-on. Not even 30 seconds after arriving at the section, a young man who worked there came to the section, hunkered down and stayed examining the cubby with extra socks. He stayed there for the entire length of time we were looking at socks. Moving socks around and pretending to work. I hadn't thought anything of it until we left that section and looked at stamps. Again, the same worker followed behind us. Anything we touched as we started to leave he would look over. I've never had this happen to me before but my wife let me know that it happens to her in the store all the time. I'm a very pale Hispanic and my wife is mixed with light-brown skin. I've been coming to this store for year and never have I been followed like today. I feel my wife only comes to the store cause I suggest it but after today I very much doubt I will return.",1,1,

Definitely went straight to the manga section....they had books my public library didn't and I wanted to finish the series... Their stationary section is super cute, but I don't need any more pens or notebooks, even if they are super adorable. I would prefer using up all my stuff first. Next time when I run out I don't mind coming here to get it. Drop by if you want a book or snack. If anything that made me laugh was they actually had the book ""Selfie"" by Kim K...which I thought was ridiculous and not necessary. A picture book....of her life...this to me sort of shamed the idea of bibliography... -_-...I would much rather pick up a book about someone who did something to change the world in a most positive way then a book about her...partying and pretty pictures with whoever...That was a little disappointing to see.

All the manga are also very nicely organized. The first floor is mainly books, second is all about manga and some merchandise and lastly the basement is stationery and also books translated in Japanese.I could have spent easily hours there. Simply loved it.",,,
176,Lizi C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",34,492,83,5.0,12/25/2014,Awesome Japanese bookstore. There are a lot of interesting books to browse through. The bottom floor has interesting stationary and knickknacks. Love the little motion flip books although they are super expensive. The top floor has a ton of anime. Seems like a great selection of you are interested in anime. Very neat store.There's also a cute little cafe on the top floor with bento box lunches and prepackaged food for sale.,,,
177,Mary N.,"New York, NY",1,21,7,5.0,10/16/2016,First time visiting this store today and I spent nearly 2 hours browsing the entire store. So much to look at and I love their selection of stationery and kawaii items. Definitely will be back to browse and buy more things from them.,1,,1
178,Casey P.,"New York, NY",36,375,34,5.0,8/4/2015,"This is certainly the best place in the city for Japanese stuff.Their selection of design books, Ghibli movies (Pom Poko, The Cat Returns, Porco Rosso), anime figurines, and English manga is fantastic. They had two manga series I've heard well of as being philosophically deep -- MONSTER and 21st Century Boy. And they had comprehensive collections of both. They also have an even larger selection of Japanese manga. I do wish they had a bigger selection of English yaoi (BL).There are also tons of random things, like anime character keychains, a poster of cameras, and a cute little portable battery pack. They've got dope Japanese music playing in the background.The staff member I asked for help was nerdy and cute and he actually knew where MONSTER was. Imagine that! Retail employees in Manhattan rarely even know what they're talking about.They close at eight; I wish they'd stay open later so I could browse all night!A must-visit both for tourists and locals.",2,1,1

They almost did get me on numerous occasions, especially the basement area which boasts quite an extensive collection of stationery. If you're a fan of anime and/or video games, you'll enjoy the upstairs. And the ground floor is a bookstore sure to please readers and non-readers of any interest.",5,1,1

181,Laura C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",753,760,1634,4.0,8/19/2014,"Kinokuniya is going to be very hard for me to resist as I work nearby. I bring a book everyday to read on my trains and sometimes I finish the book on my way in and am left empty-handed for my ride back. But now that I know was Kinokuniya has in it, this may very well change.And the fact they have a Cafe Zaiya on the second floor... oh man...I went in just to peruse and was pleasantly pleased that the second floor is all comics, it is mostly manga and anime, but there are a couple of shelves to the Western giants too. I picked up a copy of Marvel's Civil War (I'm meaning to collect all of the other Civil War's but that is when I strike big with the lottery). It was slight pricier than I've seen it elsewhere, but I still needed my hands around it. The store is well decorated and has some really awesome artwork on the walls (the mural going up the escalator to the second floor on neat). There's a lot of fashion books (with the proximity to 7th Ave that makes sense) and also best sellers and great coffee table books. There aren't too many bookstores left, and even the slow decline of B&N makes me nervous that one day I won't get to walk in any bookstores. I'm really excited to have a new place to go and learn more about the books they carry.",1,,

Blah, we spent almost 2 hours and around $125 each on kink knacks and goodies. The spacious three floor ""bookstore"" is packed with goodies. On the lowest level, they have stationary, little toys, arts and craft and majority of the Chinese/Japanese reading material. The main floor is mostly English books with knicks knacks near escalator. The top floor has anime/manga/comic book merch, teaware/silverware, knick knacks and a cafe.  It's definitely a fun place to kill a bit of time and get a snack.",3,3,1
184,Sabrina H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,47,14,4.0,10/13/2014,"Stumbled upon this place while showing a family member around the city and I could almost NOT leave! I have no idea how I had never heard of it or been in here before. It was amazing! I am a huge reader of japanese fiction or historical fiction, and also of course all things 'kawaii'. It's pricey but it's worth it. Everything is laid out beautifully, and they gift wrap beautifully. The only comment I would make is that the staff could be a little bit more friendly but I went on a weekend when it was probably busy and everyone looked pretty tired. I will definitely be back for sure. I felt like I was on a trip to Japan when I walked into here, and I feel like if I ever need any books about Japan's history it's a great place to check out. Everything is just stunning. Plus, Bryant Park is near by and on a sunny day you can't go wrong.",,1,

I couldn't figure out how to use this Japanese style binder so I went up to him and I asked him how to use this. With an annoyed face, he snatches it from me and quickly did it without informing me instruction on how to use it. I regret buying it even tho I figure it out myself since he was annoyed by me and did not actually help me at all. I don't recommend asking people for help here.

I've been a fan of anime since I was a kid and this place has it all! I even found a few books that had just been released in English. (no, I don't speak Japanese) Very helpful staff too. Three floors of everything you could want. There is even a small cafe upstairs if you want to grab a tea or some sushi. I bought several items but enjoyed browsing all of the cool merchandise just as much.",3,3,3

Even if you're not into Japanese media, this cutesy book store is still worth the trip- they have a ton of popular books and other interesting reads in English. They remind me of a small and quirky Barnes and Noble! The staff is kind (don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, but they are nice if you need help and when checking out) and the cafe on the top floor is amazing! I recommend the matcha latte and the red bean/mochi bun- super yummy and authentic :) Definitely gonna become a regular!",,,
190,Ethel M.,"Washington, DC",6,21,18,5.0,12/15/2015,"This is the cutest store in all of NYC!!!It's three stories  talk and while I didn't make it to the top floor I believe it's a bakery. The second floor is full of books. I spent most of my time on the bottom floor but didn't get through all of it. I'm a stationary and you can spend so much time here just joyously combing through items. I resisted the urge and walked out with just one washi, some folders, and a notebook. Some of these will be Christmas gifts!Depending on what you're looking for, you can probably find it. They have a wide assortment of craft tools ranging from pencil cases, origami, watercolor stuff, and calligraphy. Not to mention ceramics, stickers and all sorts of toys. One question I have is how often they stock products or bring in new ones. I was hoping to have a great selection of stamps and washi, but I was left a little wanting on that end. The other thing to note are the prices. Certain things are a tad expensive, but I wouldn't say outrageous considering they're imported and very unique. Aside from those two issues, I can totally see myself going to NYC just for this store.",,,

192,Jessica N.,"Quincy, MA",241,146,66,4.0,4/22/2015,"Went to this bookstore to check out all the plushies that everyone was raving about. There are 3 floors so you have quite a selection. i spent most of my time on the bottom floor as I was looking for pens/pencils for a friend. The pens that they carry are definitely more pricey than other pencils/pens you can find elsewhere. So go with the ones that you can't find anywhere else. Most of the books on this floor I believe is in Japanese, so I couldnt pick up any and look through them, because I don't know how to read japanese .The main floor is the one where you actually find more books in english. They have a lot of random stuff on this floor too. One of the little treasures I found were the 1/100 scale paper models that they had. I bought almost all of them, although they were a big pricey for little pieces of paper. The third floor for me was probably for me where I felt most out of place as it was all anime/mange and all that good stuff. The cafe is located on this floor so it is crowded but talk to everyone and you will have a bunch of friends by the time you leave. Honestly, not my scene, but definitely would come back. I kind of like the vibe here.",3,1,1

The top floor is the best, the best place for an otaku/anime lovers and there is also a small corner of Cafe Zaiya, a place to chill with friends and eat some bento, Onigiri, Japanese style sandwiches, and some Japanese desserts. The bottom floor is very calm and quiet, a place to read quietly and have Japanese magazines, pen, pencil, notebook, etc. I reccomend this place.",,,
194,Lynda N.,"San Jose, CA",70,10,0,4.0,4/4/2015,"I've gone to the Kinokuniya Bookstores located in San Jose, San Francisco, and Tokyo, but the one in New York is by far the biggest one I've ever been to in terms of the U.S. Oh my gosh, there's three floors, and each floor has a variety of items and merchandises, from novels, to mangas, to stationery, to DVD's, to etc! Compared to New York's, the one in San Jose is just a small and compact little Kinokuniya Bookstore, while the one in San Francisco is about two floors. The layout of each floor and section in Kinokuniya NY is organized, and the shelves are labelled, so you'll be able to find the stuff you'll need (or want) if you explore and look around. My cousin stopped by here last Saturday in hopes of finding any Vocaloid CD's, but he was out of luck. Maybe the store was out of stock?",3,1,1

This is far more than a bookstore. There are fun unimaginable gifts that are fun to look at even if you don't buy. Make sure you go downstairs to see the hand made wallets, lapel pins, and bags. They are impeccably crafted, stylish and make great gifts. The staff is spirited warm welcoming and so kind.",,,

I love coming here to check out their stationary section on the lower level. They sell everything you can imagine... books, magazine, folders, pencils, pens, traditional calligraphy brushes, high quality origami paper, and the list goes on. There is something for everyone. On the ground level, you'll be enticed by their adorable stuffed animals and unique collectibles in the back as well as the endless shelves of books. The third floor is for those who seek a moment of recovery from browsing around and wish to feast on some sandwiches and cold beverages before they continue their journey..

The bookstore has really amazing one of a kind, authentic and usually imported Japanese items. It's a must see for enthusiasts of Japanese culture. The only irritating aspect of the store are the security guards. They assume that everyone is there to steal and that no one is there to buy anything. They follow you around, give you weird glances and have no problem asking you to step away from merchandise if they feel that you're getting too close. Also, leave your phone in your bag. They have an insanely strict policy about taking photos which is a shame because i often find a lot of inspiration from this store. Other than that it's a really lovely spot to enjoy in midtown right across the street from Bryant Park.",2,,1
199,Monique D.,"Flushing, NY",3,31,21,4.0,4/6/2013,"""Yay! I'm a fan"" - indeed! Kinokuniya has a lot to offer from books to cute/funny stationary items like the ""Oyaji"" folders to Cafe Zaiya located upstairs for a variety of edible goodies from bento boxed type of meals to green tea cake rolls, you'll probably end up purchasing something even if you just intended on browsing the fashion magazine section. I come here specifically for their Blue Q accessories, I absolutely love them and love how they're made from recycled rice bags! I also bought the cutest little panda coin purse and hot pink/neon yellow-greenish headphones from here too (people always ask me where did I find them haha).I like going through their manga section as well as they have a nice variety of manga in Japanese and in English. And they have markdown sections throughout the store to ranging from 30% to 75% off (I got my Flame ""Fundamental Loop"" single from here for $1.25!! Price was originally around $10!  :-P).Also if you're big into photo books, especially on Japanese architecture and street/graffiti art, they have a nice section available to browse through as well (I love this section, as well as the magazine section on the first floor). The basement offers the Japanese books as well as Japanese language books/study materials, the stationary section and a ntt/Docomo service area (Japanese cellphone provider).Now, with the good is the bad - prices. The books at Kinokuniya can have you a little stunned due to how much some of these books (as well as music CD's and anime) are going for. And you'll be even LESS likely to buy any books from here without checking out Book-Off first. Example - a Japanese book I wanted was $25 at Kinokuniya, at Book-Off? $1.Another bad thing is if you're a decent looking Japanese woman or hanging out with a decent looking Japanese woman...be prepared for the guys who hang out at places like Kinokuniya or Book Off trying to pick up Japanese women. I unfortunately went with a woman I was tutoring in English and a man sitting across from us interrupted us, first inquiring about my lessons for her then trying to request she be HIS language partner (dude was like 60 and she's in her late 20's/early 30's), then as we got ready to leave he starts asking for her number...when she declined (and she kept looking at me, I sent mind messages telling her ""No!! Go for the throat!"" Lol) he gave her his number, almost begging for her to call him haha.We gave Kinokuniya two more chances, and both times we were interrupted so we never went back for tutoring.Other than those 2 issues, (well during comic/anime conventions the place gets even more crowded with cosplayers - not an issue for me but some people find cosplayers to be annoying haha) Kinokuniya is a cool store to check out to see what you can find.",4,2,1
