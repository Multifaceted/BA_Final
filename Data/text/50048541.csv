Long lines but moved pretty quick, we got the Shack stack & cheese fries. Lorddd all mighty that is a great burger, I am not a mushroom fan but this burger is delicious combined w the fried mushroom & cheese yummm such great taste & combo on that nice soft bun hard to go wrong with this burger. Cheese fries were really good as well. Good to know they have beer didn't get any this time around but have had the Bluepoint toasted lager before good beer. This shack is not very big but they do have some standing room along with some seatings. Service is quick enough & prices are high for burgers & fries but they are very good this is one of those places u get to splurge a little not like u can eat this stuff every day worth the try from time to time.",8,3,5

This time Friday 8pm ish it was crowded and my food came out surprisingly very quickly. Biting closer to the middle I noticed it was getting rare I had to completely remove the middle and only ate the rest of it, place is wayyyy too packed for me to go back to kitchen to refire it. It was not a satisfying meal... next time I will specifically ask for medium well.",,,

I mean really love burgers!  If my kids had a choice they would rather have burgers over rice and noodles!  I know I have seriously failed as an Asian parent:(Coming to New York, there was one burger chain that we really had to try and it was Shake Shack.  Serving their famous ""smash"" style burgers, the burgers have a great crust but still juicy patties that are topped off with a variety of toppings.  The ShackBurger is their signature burger with a smashed patty, processed cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and their signature Shacksauce.  Dang what a great combo!  But they have many other versons as well along chicken burgers, hot dogs and frozen custards.The food here is fantastic and truly enjoyable.  Staff is also very friendly at this location.  If you've never been here before, let them know and they'll start to sing a song and cheer you on your first time here:)4/5 for some solid burgers!",17,6,12

Ordered a Sch'room burger ( fried mushroom stuffed with three cheeses) cheese fries and lemonade. I thought I was ordering a cheeseburger with mushrooms on top, no folks I didn't all of a sudden turn vegan;)Tasty burger to my surprise. I ""almost"" didn't miss the meat, operative word is almost. However one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted. Star of the show was the cheese fries, the were of the crinkle cut variety and the cheese was likely processed but I didn't care lol.I was shocked of how busy this location was because there are Shake Shack's surrounding the entire city. I couldn't even find a seat but I was happy standing in the end.",2,1,1
5,Armin A.,"San Ramon, CA",123,14,5,5.0,10/15/2018,"Ordered Shack Stack, Chick's Shack, and cheese fries. Reasonably priced and delicious. Their shakes are the bomb! Fast service, Should give it a try.",2,,
6,Fazil A.,"Los Angeles, CA",820,164,91,3.0,9/17/2018,"First time eating Shake shack in NYC. There's one down the street from my house in Hollywood so I eat it somewhat frequently. As I was standing in line wondering if it would taste the same, 3000 miles away, I spotted the notice on the wall stating that they source their product locally. I ordered the same thing I always do and It seemed as though it actually tasted better in NYC. I can't be sure whether it's the nostalgia of being in the city or if there's an actual difference. Maybe the faces paced, first come seating adds to the experience. It probably does. As a tip, don't be afraid to share a table with a stranger, as there may not be an option.",1,1,1
7,Nadia D.,"Maplewood, NJ",24,96,146,4.0,7/29/2018,First time ever at shake shack...I went on a Wednesday night with a group of friends. The line was massively long and there were practically no seats. It's a very popular place to eat here in the city. The price is a bit up there considering it's just a burger/Shake spot. You can get the same quality got half the price. The food taste great though. I ordered the ham burger ($4.99) and had some of my friend's cheese fries which were around the same price. I'm not sure if I would come back here because it is so expensive. I came here for the first timer experience. I did enjoy myself and the service was great. The atmosphere is pretty social as well.,,,
8,Mike J.,"Cincinnati, OH",6,56,71,4.0,7/7/2018,"Shake Shack ReviewLocated right near the Path, this is a great last minute stop to get a snack (Burger) or shake before heading out of the city.  We stopped there after a show on Broadway and a day all over Manhattan.You go through a Que while ordering off the menu in a take out style. They make the meal, then call your name. There is no waiter service.We got shakes (a custard, sweeter base) and burgers w fries...it was all solid. My friend said...""the Shake was really thick, and more chocolatey than you usually get in a shake at a chain.The Shack Burger came a bit smaller than the typical Burger (you can order a larger size)...but it had been handmade right there, and you could taste it. There was no sense that they opened a freezer and simply plopped a pre-made Patty on the griddle. It came with the Shack Sauce lettuce, tomato and cheese, on a sweet (honey?) bun.The fries were crinkle cut, hot, and evenly cooked, not saturated in grease. They were just right with a nice crunch to ease our hunger pains and make us wish for another order.They are big on sourcing the food locally and direct from farmers when possible.The only goofy thing about the entire experience is the seating. There are stand up counters were some eat their meal, but most people stand waiting for their orders.Then there are a few booths, and open tables were people struggle to share with people they don't know. The result is this goofy constant presence of people hovering around, waiting to nab a table as one opens up. This is bothersome because you constantly feel pressured to rush through your meal, as patrons hover right next to your table.If they could fix this problem, things would be a bit better. But, if it is mid day or afternoon and it's temporary, I suggest you just take it to go and eat across the street at one of the tables outside.Try a Shack Burger and fries...it will fill you up!",,,
9,Aya E.,"Elk Grove, CA",579,432,1051,4.0,7/5/2018,"You already know my first meal back in NYC had to be good ol' Shake Shack. I was in the area around lunchtime and once I saw the green neon sign of the burger, my New Yorker self gravitated towards it!Shake Shack is always busy but the line goes by quickly. We decided to split the Shack Burger ($6), Chicken Shack ($7), and French fries ($4). Within about 5-10 minutes, our food was ready.The quality of food here is always great! The buns are warm and soft. The protein is well cooked. The hamburger was juicy and delicious while the chicken was crispy, tender, and also delicious. The fries are always a solid choice to make the meal feel more complete. However, I think the portion of fries given can be improved, especially when you're paying like $4 for it.Regardless, I'm a huge fan of Shake Shack and make an effort to come here whenever I'm back in NYC.",,,
10,Dipika A.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,36,43,4.0,9/13/2018,"Holy moly!!! Vegetarians, do yourselves a favor and get the 'shroom burger. It's the only main veggie option on the menu, but you will not regret trying it. I'm not a big mushroom fan but I was walking past this store at about 9p on a weeknight--the line wasn't long like it usually is so I decided to give it a try. I'm so upset it took me years to finally try this (I always thought it was overhyped)!! It's a delicious perfectly fried ""patty"" of a portobello mushroom stuffed with gooey Muenster cheese. Comes with a leaf of lettuce, tomato, and a special sauce. I'm drooling thinking about this again. I knocked off a star because portion-wise the burger itself ($7.50) is super small, but I also got fries with it ($3) so I ended up being full.",,,
11,Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",221,402,320,3.0,8/25/2018,"This shack location definitely wasn't my favorite. The majority of space at this specific location is standing tables, which I get because of the crazy amount of foot traffic this place gets, but the time square location seems to do fine and definitely has a ton more options as far as seating goes. During the height of lunch hour it took about 15 minutes for my food to be ready, which isn't that bad considering the place was jam packed.",1,1,1
12,Mike A.,"Louisville, KY",248,262,2941,5.0,9/1/2018,So this is my first time to Shake Shack. I have heard the hype and the rivalry east coast vs west coast. Shack vs Out. This was a true true test in burger dominance and finally put to rest of who is the best. So here is my opinion and the burgers are equal. Both burgers seemed similar with Shake Shack being the bigger burger but the frys dominance goes to Shake Shack because the frys are thick crinkle cut.  In n Out frys are good but not as aesthetically appealing as Shake Shack. Winner is Shake Shack!!,,,
13,Tom T.,"Toronto, Canada",496,82,1838,4.0,3/30/2018,"Shake Shack always delivers, no matter the location! Tasty shake burgers with cheese and of course their fries!

14,Jessica K.,"Oakland, CA",15,76,108,4.0,7/23/2018,This place was super busy. We barely found a place to sit. If you're coming with group of more then 4 people be prepared to sit wherever you can find seating. I ordered the regular burger but protein style (lettuce wrapped). This is how I usually prefer to eat my hamburgers. My husband ordered a regular burger with the bun. The burger itself was a bit small for what you pay. Shake shack gets compared to in and out a lot. I think in and out still takes the win for taste and price.What I did like about the protein burger was the lettuce that was used. Shake shack uses a green leaf lettuce compared the conventional iceberg lettuce. The green leaf lettuce holds the burger together a lot better.,1,,1
15,Ellie B.,"Brea, CA",3,22,510,5.0,9/28/2018,"I'm not big on burgers. Don't judge me. However, if I ever happen to crave a cheeseburger (rarely) or just get some In N Out after arriving to LAX (tradition) I'll head to the closest In N Out. I decided to give this place a try. The burger was delicious. It was on the edge of becoming too salty but overall it was good. I wasn't a fan of the shake. I still prefer my In N out strawberry shake and fries for sure! The place was packed but the employees managed to get the line moving pretty quickly. Surprisingly my order was out after 5 min. Other people that had ordered before me were still waiting for theirs. Maybe because they had some special requests??? The menu is more diverse (?) than In N outs so that's kinda cool. There are limited places to sit or stand to eat. you'll have to squeeze your way by.",,,1

20,Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",790,636,554,2.0,11/14/2017,"I have no idea what all the hype is about. And I have lost a little respect for Anthony Bourdain as he recommended this place as a top hamburger destination.These were honestly the worst cast casual burgers I have ever had. Where do I begin? Let's start with the grease...it was disgusting how much grease was on this burger. The burgers were literally sliding around the tray there was so much grease.Both my husband and I ordered double burgers and we shared a side of fries. Aside from the grease, the burgers had way too much cheese. I didn't think that was possible but it really drowned out any other flavors.The fries were so obviously cheap frozen fries that you buy in the supermarket. They were soggy and bland. I didn't give a 1 star because at least the service was good. They were fast to bring out the food and cleaned our table very soon after we were done eating. No more Shake Shack for us.",8,3,6

23,Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1934,1087,4828,3.0,11/4/2017,"I love Shake Shack but this location let me down. Having previously frequented the UES location, I was saddened by the poor quality of this one. I ordered my usual - single shack burger with cheese without the shack sauce, fries, and a shake. I tried the chocolate cookies and cream shake that they were featuring.The place was busy, as usual but I seemed to have caught a quick lull in the service given that for a brief moment, only a few of us were in line. Lots of people were waiting on their orders. I ordered my meal to go and after waiting approximately 15 minutes, it was ready. The burger was unfortunately unseasoned and haphazardly put together and the shake was bland. All I could taste were cookie bits. This was disappointing overall as I'd been looking forward to sinking my teeth into one of these burgers during my brief visit to the city. Although I doubt if I will revisit this location again, I will say that the employees were doing an amazing job trying to keep things clean in the dining area.This experience may have tipped the balance back to In-n-Out...",12,8,10
24,Elisabeth B.,"Charlotte, NC",171,486,69,4.0,6/7/2018,What I like about this Shake Shack as they have menu items that my local Shack doesn't have. More dessert options and flavors and just an overall more extensive menu. The line moves fast so get in it and get a chocolate malt milkshake. The bathroom code is on the bottom of your receipt.

But then again Shake shak has not made a name by being just another anything. This revolutionary fast food is good food with efficient service in a good ambiance.

I ordered a ShackBurger, fries, and a chocolate milkshake, and I must say that they set my standards for milkshakes pretty high.The food took around 20 minutes for them to make, but again, it was pretty crowded. It was also extremely difficult to find seats (most of which were filthy), and many people ended up sharing tables.I'm sad that there isn't a Shake Shack close to me, but I'm hoping they'll open one soon.Overall, I had a pretty good experience here and I'll be sure to come back the next time I'm in NYC.",,,

I don't know what I was doing my whole life & why I've never tried Shake Shack before!First off, this location is super convenient! Right on Broadway! I thought it was going to be PACKED, but, thankfully, the line wasn't too long and we found a table right away! After seeing all the pictures on Yelp, I knew what I wanted before we even got here: a Shack Burger, fries, and a 50/50! I ordered and paid and was given a buzzer to notify me when my order was ready. Once my buzzer went off, I was soo excited! I personally LOVE crinkle cut fries and these fries were PERFECT! Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside! Loved the fries!! I'd definitely give it a 5/5! Next time I gotta be a little bit more adventurous and try their fries with cheese sauce and maybe even bacon! Also would like to note, their small fries is a pretty big portion! I couldn't finish all of mines.As for the Shack Burger, loved the fresh lettuce and tomato, and the melted cheese! The burger itself was on the smaller side but it was the perfect size for me! For those who have a bigger appetite, you may need to get a Double Shack Burger. Although the burger was good, I was a little disappointed by the lack of Shack Sauce. It definitely needed more flavor and I had to resort to putting ketchup in my burger because it was a bit dry from the lack of sauce. 4/5 for me.Since it was around 30 degrees outside and I was freeezing, I didn't get to try any of their shakes or frozen custard. Ugh! I regret it now but I will be back again to try it!Overall, definitely a fan! Love love love their fries and will be back to give the Shack Burger another try! Or possibly I'll try a different burger! Either way, I will be back again!",2,2,1

I didn't even eat it right away, took the 15 min train ride to work from Penn and it traveled fine. Your order (to go) comes in a paper bag but lined with a to go box as the bottom. It holds your burger, fries, sauces, and drink, just fine!My favorites are the original Cheeseburger shack and the Shroom. Also, my other guilty pleasure, fries any way (with cheese, plain, or the bacon option). So good. Sinful but a must.So even after consuming this thousand calorie meal, if you have stomach space, order the signature custard or the ""flavor of the month)... Always a great treat.

We waited close to 15 minutes for a burger, a hot dog, 3 shakes and fries. I had stopped in with the kids before a show and the number of people standing around waiting for their orders should have been an indication that they weren't moving things along. People are waiting along the corridor with the condiments and napkins so that you're constantly jostled while trying to get what you need. Then you get the tourists who think they can guilt you into giving up your seat - while you are eating! - because they brought their toddlers with them.Honestly, the food was mediocre, the crowds were stifling, the staff looked miserable and I wasn't impressed. Well over $30 for 1 french fry, 1 burger, 1 hot dog and 3 small shakes. I'm used to NYC prices but that's ridiculous.

The veggie burgers is ok not a big portobello fan.  The cheese fries are average would stick to regular fries instead. The cheese sauce seems like its canned. and there milkshakes and especially the Empire state concrete its the bomb. Definitely a popular spot so to save time order online and pick it up. Otherwise staff is good and service is great. It does have plenty of seating which helps in New york.,,,

The condiment counter was a mess and all of the ketchup dispensers were empty. When I got back to my hotel, I found I received a chocolate shake and single burger instead. I was not about to walk all the way back, so I called to inform them my order was wrong, selected the option for manager, and no one picked up. The food was mediocre at best and I threw away the shake. Not worth the almost $20 I paid, especially since my order was wrong. I don't see what the hype is about this place. I'll never return.",,,

Great taste and sear on the beef patty. Fresh toppings and a delicious bun didn't overpower the burger. I really liked the Shack Sauce too. The seating was full, but there were lots of standing tables, so I was able to find a spot to eat.

One night after work I was too tired to walk too far for food and I happened to find a Shake Shack only 3 min away.. and although I wasn't in a Burger-mood, I decided to give it a go. I brought it to my hotel, and put a fry in my mouth while I was cleaning the dining table and BAM! I stopped, everything moved in slow motion as my taste buds exploded with delicious flavor. I couldn't believe how delicious just the fries were, so i took a bite from the burger. I'm from the west coast, and IN and OUT is king, but I then realized I betrayed my #1 fast food burger fave and decided then, Shake Shack was better.. (sorry west coast peeples).

61,Jerome T.,"New York, NY",99,370,3040,4.0,8/14/2017,"There's two kinds of people in the world: those who understand that Shake Shack is the best fast food burger and idiots. Which one are you? Download the App before coming here, so you don't have to wait in the ridiculous line with the rest of the herd. Give them at least 30/45 prior and when they text you your order is done, you walk straight to the front of the line like a baller, where perfection awaits. So, why is this better then most? It's the blend of the meat they use to make the patty, Gyna. The original perfect blend of meats came from Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors from only the best beef the local market offers; that's reason enough for the higher price.Get it without sauce. A burger is about the meat, so if you put a lot of bells and whistles on it,  you will miss out on why this patty is better then the competition. Most of the time, I just get a double naked. Pause. Yes, nada. Porque? Because, a true burger lover wants nothing between his/her tongue and that ridiculous, rich, beefy blend. It's not fine dining, but it was birthed from it. The comparisons to any other chain burger joint are apples and bowling balls; that's like comparing Cleveland to NYC. If you don't get that, then clearly, Shake Shack isn't for you.

There's only 1 line at this particular store. Normally there's two, one for orders and one for shakes. Here you just get on one line to order. It usually goes fairly quickly regardless of how long the line is because all the registers are usually open. They have burgers, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs and drinks (shakes, coffees, etc.). I usually get their regular ShackBurger, this is their take of a regular cheeseburger with 'fancy' sauce. I tried their chicken sandwiches and I'm not a fan of it really. Feel as though the breading is a bit much on the chicken. You get more flour than chicken itself. Now as a new item, they offer BBQ chicken sandwich or burger, BBQ Shackmeister. I must say its pretty good. BBQ sauce, fried onions, cheese and patty. You can get it either a single or double patty. I've only tried their shakes, strawberry and black and white (chocolate and vanilla). The consistency is good, thick but soft enough to sip through a straw. It's not too sweet either. You really taste the flavor not all sugary. But a shake cost as much as a burger. So take your pick. There's plenty of seating inside, booths, bar tops and long communal tables. TVs for entertainment. There's an app now so if you order via the app you can just show up and pick up.",1,,

This Shake Shack was very organized - the flow from lining up to ordering to waiting went very efficiently. They always give you these handheld buzzers to notify you when your food is ready to be picked up. When my buzzer went off, it was great to see that the everything was packed and ready to be picked up when I reached the counter for my orders. The entire process only took about 15 minutes. I went for the classic ShackBurger and Cheese Fries. - ShackBurger: It comes with lettuce, tomato, and cheese topped with ShackSauce. The patty was very juicy and tender. The bun was nice and soft as well. ShackSauce reminds me of a mild sweet and sour sauce with a mayo-like consistency.- Cheese Fries: I usually don't eat fries, but these thick, crinkle cut ones are my weakness. They're not very salty or dry. They also come out nice and hot so that the cheese melts nice nicely. Overall, dining in seems to be a challenge. The restaurant has a decent amount of seating, but it doesn't seem to be enough to meet the demand. Luckily, I only came with two other friends, so we were able to find seats and dine in.",,,
92,Igor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,142,0,3.0,4/16/2018,It is a good burger but I wouldnt call it the best burger out there. It is just ok. Usually the wait to get a burger is not worth the taste of the actual burger. The fries are not worth it. I would just get a double and a shake and call it a day.,1,,
93,Chloe B.,"New York, NY",45,34,160,5.0,7/1/2018,Great food!! You tend to wait a little bit for your food - they don't seem in too big of a rush. Finding a table isn't too hard either!,,,
94,Lee L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",58,510,18,4.0,4/17/2017,"On our recent visit to NY, my sister-in-law insisted that we eat at Shake Shack.  It was one of several ""musts"" that she gave us during our week-long stay.  After a disappointingly slow experience just to get drinks at the 8th Ave. location, I wasn't sure that I wanted to brave the lines again.  However, our craving for red meat and frozen dairy desserts got the better of us, and we gave in to temptation.  I wasn't particularly optimistic when we arrived - right at noon - but the line moved much faster than the other location.  We had our food - burgers, fries, concretes, and a beer - in less than 15 minutes.The burgers were very good.  The way the patties are formed remind me a bit of Smashburger or Culvers.  Fries were nothing special.  The ""Give My Regards..."" concrete was really good, but all the toffee and chunks were at the top and not mixed evenly through the whole concoction, so after greedily eating away at the top we were left with mostly vanilla soft-serve ice cream for the rest of it.  Still good though.  We'll likely come back on future visits to NY.",,,1
95,Mari B.,"Manhattan, NY",19,4,0,5.0,6/9/2018,Went to this location for the first time. Often frequented the location on Madison Park. I did not wait long at all for my order. Kevin was amazing in handling my order. The environment allows customers to share booths. I would highly recommend it.,,,

It would have been cool for them to use something from one of the great nearby bakeries from Korea Town as opposed to this decent bakery from the West Village, but it's still fun to have the location-specific flavors to try with the always excellent custard.",18,10,14
97,William W.,"Brentwood, TN",127,246,227,5.0,3/22/2017,"This is the ultimate comfort food! The Shake Shack is an icon in New York, a single location for years before other stores began popping up everywhere. And yet as the franchise branches out, even as far as Tokyo and Seoul, the quality is never sacrificed nor diluted.At their Broadway location, the french fries are nearly perfect with a crisp outer shell, significant ridges, and a soft interior. The chicken sandwich is unbelievable, of utmost crispness and tender inside between one of the softest buns you'll ever eat. The strawberry shake with extra whip cream was phenomenal, and it better be since it's the restaurant's namesake.You can see Times Square from this location, just blocks away, and yet the area around the store seems so peaceful in contrast to the center of the universe. You will not be disappointed with a visit here.",1,,
98,Kadeem C.,"New York, NY",50,131,387,5.0,10/5/2016,"You honestly cannot go wrong with Shake Shack.  Its been around for a few years, and still shines bright.  Whether it's their always changing concretes, shakes, or sandwiches/burgers.. to their classics that just don't need changing.  The staff is helpful, and seems to be having fun in a fast paced kitchen and the front of the house staff always keeps the tables clean, and comes and gets your trays when you're done eating *suggesting that you now leave ..WHEN there's lots of other customers waiting to sit and eat*( I am FOR this).I had the chicken sandwich + cheese fries: it was really good. The cheese on the cheese fries was super delicious + high quality.    The chicken was tender, and perfectly cooked. It had gold flavor, and the sauce and toppings added to it boosted it. (Excluding the pickles, because I hate them.)  The sandwich is a 5/5 for me, BUT it's not the champ over chick fil A.. sorry guys but great idea. I can now get my chicken fix at any Shake Shack :)",,,
99,Ping F.,"Manhattan, NY",101,232,1444,5.0,6/3/2016,"So happy that I don't have to walk all the way to the Theatre District for Shake Shack!I was craving bacon and beef, therefore Shake Shack was the ideal location for lunch.The line was out the door, but it wasn't a bad wait because the line wasn't very long once we got inside.  My advice is to know what you want before you get to the cashier, that way the line will move faster.There are so much more tables in this Shake Shack location.  You don't have to speed walk and sit your butt down early to claim a table (even though my friend and I did that, old shake shack habits die hard).  One of the employees came by our table to wipe it down and apologized for not cleaning sooner.  She was very nice and sweet, we chatted a bit.  Fyi, this Shake Shack location is very clean. The burger was delicious! Maybe it's been a while since I've eaten bacon and beef, but it was so good!  I ordered a Smoke Stack burger with lettuce and extra tomatoes. I can still remember my first bite into the burger as I'm typing this review....pause, reminisce...yea, I could go for another burger soon.  The bacon was extra crispy, and they don't skimp on that ingredient.  The beef patty was medium well, juicy with the just off the grill taste.  I love the slightly spicy shacksauce on the burger. The strawberry mint lemonade was good, a little bit tart, and a little too sweet.  But it'll do.  I prefer strawberry lemonade.  There is a water fountain and cups off to the side for people who do not want soda or alcohol. I was surprised to see a bathroom code listed on the receipt.  So, if you gotta go to the bathroom, order something first!  I suggest a burger!",2,,1

This review is about one particular man named MARK working on February 27, 2018 at around 10pm. I have never experienced such great service! He started by helping us find a table which most people could care less and have you find your own table but not Mark.  He came and found us just to let us know there was a table available.  He then would come by every few minutes to make sure we didn't need water or anything.  He cleaned up our table fast and as I see him walk around giving other guest the same amount of attention and service as he did us I had to give him a tip before I left. I offered him a tip but he declined and I ever said I could hide it under the tray and he can secretly take it without anyone knowing but still he proceeds to decline! Who does that!?!?  Anyone would seriously be lucky to have someone like him work for them.  Thank you Mark for everything.  You made our dining experience great!  :)*SHAKE SHACK ON BROADWAY AND 36th or 6th?!

The lines are never that long and if there are a few people in line they get the orders cranking! Service has always been pretty friendly! I got the ShakeBurger and got it as a double since the patties are a little small. Also the crinkle cut fries are always money and covered in just enough salt to make you want more! I got their mint cookies and cream shake. There was hardly any mint in it and more of a cookies and cream shake, but that's ok because cookies and cream is the best shake out there! The burgers are always full of flavor and extremely tasty! Awesome place to go if you are on the run and need something quick!",1,,

106,Mahmood S.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",46,177,304,3.0,7/21/2016,"This review is based solely on a single shake I've had from this location. Specifically the chocolate Oreo shake.The line was short and so getting to the cashier took a relatively short time. The wait for the shake wasn't all that bad either as the device buzzed within five minutes. The shake I got which was a large, wasn't as big as I expected. In fact a large shake here is actually a medium at best as compared to other brands and shops.Shake shack somehow ends up charging a similar price to others who's shakes are both bigger and better. Really the only place I can think of that is a similar price and doesn't taste as good is Jamba Juice.In any case, without comparing the shake to anything, it was good. The shakes flavor was there but it was light, not thick enough for a spoon, in fact thin enough to drink with a soda straw.Milkshakes shouldn't be that light, and with a small size I expected it to be heavier.All in all if you want a milk shake I would go somewhere else. If you're trying to have a milk shake after a greasy burger and fries, than maybe a light shake like the one served here is a better choice than the heavier alternative. So no if you came for a shake.Yes if you came for a meal + shake.One day I'll get a meal and shake combo and update this review, till that time comes, 3/5 is a fair rating.",,1,

We also had the cheese fries and a couple of beers. Ok.. a fast food joint that serves beer? I'm sold!! And!! They have a dog menu if u bring your furry friend along!

I pinched myself to make sure it was real and that I hadn't begun hallucinations from hunger. To my relief it was. The line was unusually empty for 5:15 in the middle of the week. I scurried in line and immediately placed my usual 'Shroom burger and fries'. Extra hot and fresh crinkly fries. A breaded and fried Portabella oozing with cheese on a bed of lettuce and tomato nesting on a soft potato bun. My buzzer went off and it was out in no time. Simultaneously, the once barely bustling shack was now full of ready to eat patrons. And as a result, not an empty seat in sight. There's a scarcity of seats in this location. Yet a long table lining the center for a quick stand and eat. Needless to say, I stood and ate as I suppose New Yorkers do right down to the last bite.",3,4,3

I've even been to two locations in Dubai. I know the food, I know the level of service. I always order my food the same way. Today I asked for mustard on my burger. I don't like it as much when you take the cold mustard out of the pump, but when they do it in the back, the burger right off the griddle, warms it up and it absorbs the flavor. I asked for my burger with mustard, as always. Guys says we don't do that. I say I order it like that all the time. He says nope we don't do that. You get the mustard on the side, it's the same. I say it again, that it's different please do so and I always get it that way. Then the guy at the register next to him says ""no, Chicago dogs only"". Then the two of them start arguing with me. I ask what's the big deal? I've never had this issue - they always do it - at every location I've been too, and by now I've had so many Burgers this way I can't even keep track. Then the guy who chimed in from the next register yells out to some employee standing by the door : ""Cory - tell this guy we don't put mustard on the burgers"" and he says yea we can't.

I've experienced better"" and that's mostly due to my experience not the food.Don't get me wrong the food was fantastic! But some changes have to take place for this place before people start to skip on the idea of eating here. This place gets overcrowded fast. They need to implement some sort of system where they only allow a certain amount of patrons in at a time so you don't have people fighting for a seat and standing behind you as you eat waiting for the chance to take your seat.Although I didn't have any issues with the staff I noticed they mostly seemed miserable. Why? What really did it for was the trash heap. Some lazy employee opens the door to the trash receptacle and allows all the trash to fall out. Food scraps, soda, an god knows what else is what I had to watch as I enjoyed my delicious double stack. Tables aren't cleaned all that often which is made your responsibility when you take a table from someone else.I'd suggest maybe hiring some sort of dining room manager who could help move those who are done eating out of the restaurant as there were many tourists just siting there.I'd suggest Shake Shack but definitely another location.",3,1,2

Burger wise - it definitely can compete with In & Out's, but I have to give a slight edge to my native chain. Don't get me wrong, Shake Shack's burger is great, I just think In & Out's is slightly better. That being said, there are definitely more selection at Shake Shack, so hands down it is the winner in that category. Do many to choose from, and so little time and not enough $$$ to try them all! Also, the fries are very yummy! I actually do not like the In & Out Burger fries, even with the animal style, but I love Shake Shack's version of cheese and bacon fries! The potatoes are thick, then topped with cheese and real chopped bacon bits! And the shake...just gotta order it to know what I'm talking about!!!I love the fact that I got to try three burger joints in the different parts of the U.S.: West Coast = In & Out, South = What-a-Burger, and East Coast = Shake Shack!

They could many more customers if they rethought all The 4-6 person tables and went with more community tables with CHAIRS.  Eating standing up is NOT a pleasurable experience.  Burger is typical flat top thin patty burger nice potato bun, think a&w or Stewart's root beer drive up joints throwback from the 50's or in and out burger.  It's good, the cheese sauce on the fires though is unique and delicious.  They need to slap that on a burger, or let me order on the side to dip into.

The garden dog comes on a hotdog bun with mustard and layered with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cucumbers. It was actually a really tasty combination and taste so much likes hamburger with all the fixings that I didn't even miss the meat. The fries were hot, crispy and delicious with ketchup.",,,

I left wondering why Shake Shack was so hyped up when it just tasted like a normal fast food burger. Because In-N-Out tastes better in California, Shake Shack must taste better in New York. We stopped by this place out of convenience while shopping. I will have to say that the burger was a lot less greasy than I remembered. However, it still tasted like a normal fast food cheeseburger, albeit more expensive. Either I was super hungry or the burgers are really small. Go for the double ShackBurger. The fries were starchy and not crispy. Not sure what the hype is about. I am still not a fan of Shake Shack.",1,1,

Updated review","Ok So normally I will give 5 stars to a good place but I am only giving 1 stars for the great customer service! The workers were great! The food was a disappointment. The burgers were small and the taste was bland, prices were high. So this is another hyped up burger joint for no reason :( Carl's Jr. has the best burgers!",,,
141,Cristina V.,"New York, NY",247,87,43,5.0,7/14/2016,"Okay, I've been a fan of the Shack for a long, long time. I've had the Shackburger, the SmokeShack, the ShroomBurger but after all the hype I decided to finally try the ChickenShack and I am SPEECHLESS. Having grown up in the south, I am no stranger to the fried chicken sandwich. As a long time Chick-Fil-A customer, their chicken sandwich has always reigned supreme for me, but the ChickensShack has just eclipsed it. Nestled between two slices of fresh, fluffy potato bread is the buttery-est, crispiest, crumbly-est chicken patty I've ever tasted. With subtle flavors of pepper, paprika, and buttermilk the chicken has the perfect hint of spice and gives a mouthful of flavor. The chicken was tender and moist, and the breading was not overwhelming but rather light, adding a nice crunch between bites. Tying all of the flavors together was a generous spread of buttermilk-herb mayo. As a person who absolutely detests mayonnaise, I was pleasantly surprised by this delectable sauce. This mayo is more like a buttermilk ranch dressing - and adds a creamy, full-bodied richness to the chicken. The lettuce, refreshing, acting as a neutral separator from the fattiness of the sandwich. Atop the small heap of lettuce are two crispy pickles, which are not too sour but pair perfectly with the savory treat. This thing is incredible. Five stars for the ChickenShack. This is the most mouthwatering piece of fowl you'll lever have.",2,,
142,Janice L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",232,135,251,4.0,5/7/2017,"Living in California, apparently Shake Shack is like our In N Out. This location was extremely busy, and it was extremely difficult finding a seat to sit down and eat. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a table available, and had to stand up and eat, which I am not a fan of. Shake Shack to me, is not anything spectacular. The Shack Burger is simply very similar to In N Out. However, I did really enjoy the thick cut french fries from Shake Shack. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside :)",,,

Burger and chicken burger were all good, but the shakes were awesome. I normally don't like shakes, but they are thick 'n creamy that its like slurping very indulgent ice cream from a straw. How can you go wrong? Not quite 5 stars as that's reserved for our hometown favorite In-N-Out. Better shakes at Shake Shack, but for a fast food burger joint, In-N-Out any day.",,,

The manager came out to tell me and apologized to me even though it was my fault. Then he asked if I could purchase a burger at full price, and he will give me a voucher for the next time I come. Of course I said ok. The food came out fast, and he personally came out to apologize again and give me my voucher. Once again it was not even his fault. Super nice guy.

My low star rating is for the service and management at this particular location. Look, I get it- You're busy and it's definitely a busy area with loads of orders and customers. However, waiting 20 minutes for an ice cream order is unacceptable especially when our buzzer was ringing and we repeatedly told the workers that the buzzer had been ringing. We repeatedly told them to go check and all they said was ""it's coming"". Eventually, we flagged down the manager who went back and found it just sitting there. By the time it got to us, it was all melted and dripping. There are so many shake shacks in the city. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. This location is just not worth it.",1,,

I wouldn't be standing there if I got my food!!!  Do you know how many shack burgers went out before I got mine? Eight.  Eight burgers they could've slapped some bacon on and I could've walked away sooner.I was also missing cheese for one order of fries and a whole order of fries [that I didn't notice until I got back to my office.]  This girl Deja [not sure on spelling] rolled her eyes when I asked for cheese, as if I'm inconveniencing her.  When I finally got my one burger I was missing, 25 minutes later, she did this Beyoncé head flip and said ""here.""  She firmly placed the burger in my bag and walked away.  Sorry Deja, I didn't know that it's my fault that you can't properly check a bag.I was not the only person that had a problem, at least six other people came back to say their order was not correct and that they were missing food or half their order.  One woman was given a completely wrong to go order and she could've had a food allergy!I won't be revisiting this Shake Shack until I know their customer service has changed.  Unbelievable.",1,,

Upon entering I had to wait in a line that started outside but it moved fast and got us right in! The menu was easy to understand and prices were very reasonable. After ordering it was like the hunt of our lives to try and find seats. Everyone something would open it would be a mad dash to see who could get their first. Luckily we scored an awesome booth to wait for our good in. The wait was a little long and the beepers that they gave us didn't work so we had to wait to hear our names. But boy oh boy! The wait was worth it! I ordered a cheese burger and friends with a chocolate milk shake. The 'shack sauce' on my burger made the whole thing! I didn't want it to end! The fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned. I will deff be making another trip there next time I'm in town!,,,1

There were a few little char marks on it hotdog which is just how I like a hotdog. Give me the char! Oh yeah! We got ours with some melted cheese on top...they don't have chili, but its not everyone's thing. It was still delicious. I had the chicken sandwich and it came with pickles and a buttermilk-herb mayo that was so tasty. It was different in a very good way. It gave the chicken another layer of flavor goodness. For a chain, I was certainly impressed. The shake not so much. We both got the chocolate cookie shake and I didn't like the chocolate flavoring. It was a little chalky to me. My gut told me to order the peanut butter shake, but I couldn't withstand the chocolate and cookies temptation. The young lady who took our order was very pleasant and helpful. The place was packed which is always a good sign of good food. There was always a person tending to the cleanliness of the restaurant which is very important when so many people are in there.

He said it was really greasy.  He also complained that it was really small.  We all agreed that the Chocolate cookies n cream shake was the bomb though.  Perfect consistency to drink with a straw.

The line was not bad at all, but the place was definitely packed. After placing our orders, my cousin and I somehow miraculously were able to grab a booth in the back, so we were nice and comfy while waiting for our food and while we ate.With such a convenient location (until the one inside Penn Station opens up), I'll be sure to return on many occasions and will be trying the ChickenShack because it looks delicious!!!",,,

I tried this location yesterday for lunch and I can say that they def have everything on point here. I ordered the new chicken sandwich and I was thoroughly impressed! The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, and a big healthy piece of chicken to boot. A little bit more mayo than I would have liked, I'll just ask for less next time.

There wasn't a very long line (which is apparently rare), and I ordered a Smoke Shack burger with a Black & White shake for around $13. The price point was a little high considering what I'd ordered, but the quality was better than typical fast food chains. However, I didn't find the shake to be anything special, which is interesting considering the chain's name. What impressed me about this location was the service; one of the staff members went out of her way to seat us in an otherwise packed restaurant, and brought over condiments as a courtesy. She was really attentive, and genuinely enjoyed helping us. Overall, I recommend visiting Shake Shack at least once, and think its service outperforms its food.",,,

They offered sooooo many flavors and it was so hard to choose! If your not in to burgers, they also have hot dogs and tons of other foods to choose from ( I think they even sell dog food!!) my only complaint is the bathroom, this place is obviously really popular, and a lot of people need to... ya know.... They only have 2 toilets, and the line builds fast. They should really consider building another one, or expanding the current bathrooms. Overall good experience, hope to come back to NYC!^o^",,,
187,Natalie M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,55,10,3.0,7/23/2017,The food here is always delicious and fresh. Service is ok the workers are all young and careless about good customer service they just work hard to get orders out.,,,
188,Kaley T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",61,1,0,3.0,3/15/2018,My burger was cold and the meat was not fully cooked. The floors were also very greasy and slick,,,
189,Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",799,2685,266,4.0,8/27/2016,"Still just as tasty as I'd remembered from my time in NYC.  While the Shake Stack was smaller than I recalled, its cheesy portabello was nonetheless derricious and the egg bun fantastic.",2,1,1
190,Cynthia B.,"San Leandro, CA",28,44,55,5.0,12/13/2016,"We had to stop by the famous shake shack after a long day of meetings, coming from California I can say it's very similar to in n out but of course they are NOT the same. The bun size is very similar, ingredients on the burger were so fresh and that's always a great thing. Fries were freshly made and lemonade was so delicious. Downside is the wait as it's very busy but what more can you expect if the burgers are so good and the girl taking my order was so friendly and assist me during my first time visit.",,,
191,George D.,"El Paso, TX",17,137,42,4.0,7/17/2017,Cool place to come a get a shake. Black and white is the best.  Really just a stop in place but the atmosphere is hip and fun.,,,
192,Omana M.,"Hoboken, NJ",223,33,5,5.0,7/1/2017,"The best part of out of town friends visiting me is that I have an excuse to visit shake shack. As a vegetarian, their mushroom burger is a great, different option from the normal veggie burger everywhere else. Their fries are pretty much perfect, and when you pair it all with the coffee milkshake, it makes one delicious meal.",,,
193,Gabby R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,88,22,4.0,12/28/2017,"Friendly staff, clean location. Very crowded though.",,,
194,Mike Y.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,140,519,4.0,6/30/2017,Just crazy busy. Lots of tourists and long wait times.But fries we had were good and the milkshake as well.Nothing exclusive however.Free refill on the lemonade - that was refreshing !,,,
195,Michael L.,"Houston, TX",117,780,260,4.0,9/3/2016,"Out of all the NYC locations, this one had the shortest line except @ JFK which is surprising given the location.  This is not to say it doesnt get crowded because it definitely can.  Will not go into the food because I have a theory that ppl either love it or not fans of it at all.  Me and my wife love it so we are no strangers to shake shack.   My only gripe with this location is that the suspended light bulbs from the ceiling obstructs the view of the TV hanging.",1,,
196,Shalisha A.,"New York, NY",52,63,0,2.0,7/29/2017,"Burgers are super juicy and delicious.  However, it's often jam packed and therefore takes long to get your food. It's also very expensive, and you don't get much bang for your buck.",,,
197,Nadja D.,"San Francisco, CA",31,6,0,5.0,8/15/2017,"Excellent service, the staff were really friendly! I was hardcore craving burgers and fries and this place did not disappoint! The shakes are also awesome!!! Thanks Shake Shack!!",,,
198,Sunny P.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,8,1,2.0,7/18/2017,"The service was upsetting. I ordered online and they ""forgot "" about my order. Instead of making my order on the spot for me. I stood there for an additional 30 minutes before someone gave me my food. Not going to this location anytime soon.",,,
199,Marrianne B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",68,26,6,5.0,6/3/2017,"Yummmmmmm. Visiting from So Cal, where they have popped up other Shake Shack locations, nothing beats having it in NY. We finished shopping at Macys and walked over to this location. Line was long, but fast, it took some time to find a table and get our food. Worth the wait. Will be back.",,,
