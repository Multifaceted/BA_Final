1,Zehra M.,"New York, NY",138,98,157,3.0,7/11/2018,A solid happy hour spot to spend time at with coworkers. They have a nice outdoor space and pub-like indoor seating depending on your preference and if you can snag a table. I'd recommend making a reservation in advance if you come here with a large group as the place gets packed on Thursdays and Fridays. Service could be drastically better and you'll be swimming among a sea of finance bros.,,,
2,Tom L.,"Coxsackie, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/2/2018,Don't order the sandwiches. They are not good. The entrees looked and tasted good. The poutine was tasty. I am 53 years in this city. If you can't make a Reuben Sandwich you've got issues. The grilled chicken sandwich looked like chicken roll. Waitress was good but overworked. All in all not a good Irish Pub experience.,,,

Updated review","Look I tried to be nice last time. Not this time. So here were my problems with this visit.1) Nine bucks for a bottle of Corona. I mean seriously, do me sideways with a pineapple. I am not sure I have ever paid more.2) Change was 11 ones. I am not going to a freaking strip club but the server's response was ""Well that is all I have in the till"". So no fives, no tens. Yeah, no. Look, if you really only have that then that is garbage, if you're trying for a 2 buck tip you will be disappointed by the zero tip.3) Saturday night. Dead. Really. Ten people in a space for 60. Maybe they know there are places in spitting distances you will pay 6 for a bottle.I do not normally do zeroes,  I understand service industry can be challenging but you guys are taking the piss. Stay away.",,,

5,Grace G.,"Roseville, CA",53,381,1079,1.0,6/17/2017,"Never again. We walked into this spot around 11pm after our show. We are from California. Not from here. So, if this is a local spot with their own ways of doing anything, we have no clue cuz no one took the time to tell us. We sat down at a bar top. This place was dead. Maybe 7 people in there. Lo.The server running around never said anything to us. The bartender at the bar 2 feet away from us never said anything. We were not greeted at all by anyone. Even if they have a thing where you order at the bar, no one said anything....not even hello. So yeah, that was our visit. We sat around for 20 minutes chilling. No one cared about us at all. We walked out. So, I can't review the food or the drinks....just the service...and it sucks here. From out of town, looking for a cool spot to hang out....go somewhere else.",6,2,1

Fish and Chips excellent made with Cod just like in Ireland. The night life is great here. A lot of kind wonderful fun people from Ireland that make you feel at home.  The Irish breakfast is authentic and shipped in from Ireland. A must try. Very cool patio area, summer and winter.",,,
7,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",748,432,173,5.0,7/26/2017,"I love this bar purely because it fulfills my childhood dream of being an old timey train conductor. It's storefront is completely unassuming--but when you enter, prepare to experience antique-y train station aesthetics, dim and narrow corridors, seriously cool ambiance---oh yeah, there's also drinks too, I guess. After I eventually got over how cool the inside of this bar was, I was finally able to settle into my post-work drink and meal. The choices are solid, and the food was decent too--just your typical pub fare, but no complaints here. What's also great about this bar, is that there's tons of space--they even have a whole back room which is kinda half inside, half outside. This was slightly unfortunate that day because our chicken tenders and fries were getting par-drenched by the rain while the awning failed to cover us entirely. But otherwise, every aspect of this bar is train-stakingly perfect. Pun intended.",,,
8,Wagner C.,"Mineola, NY",229,15,1,1.0,5/23/2018,"If I could leave less than a 1 star rating I would. The place is nice however the wait staff leaves much to be desired. I've been about 3 times only bc my office is down the block. Every time I've been here I leave aggregated with how long I have to wait to be attended to and once attended to it takes for ever to get your food or beverages. Word to wise if your goin to be coming in to this establishment you should order your drinks 2 at a time and ask for ur bill half way through ur stay bc you'll be waiting at least 15 to get it. In my last visit I sat in the outdoor patio and asked for my bill when I was getting ready to leave after waiting more than 10 minutes I walked right out without paying my bill and without anyone even noticing. Great job guys, keep up the good work.",,1,
9,Michael D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,6,1.0,8/23/2018,"This is a nice place and has a great outdoor area. But someone really needs to work on fixing the service here.

10,Pamela K.,"New York, NY",249,279,190,4.0,1/6/2017,"I see the 3 star rating on this place, but I'm going to go 4 (and here's why):(1) Spacious: Never hard to find a seat, indoors or outdoors(2) Huge outdoor space (with bar): Where can you find a bar with an outdoor space, let alone a big one, that is open in the summer and closed with heating lamps in the winter(3) Service: Consistently well-staffed so you're never waiting too long for a drink/drink order to be takenCome on, people. It is HARD to find a bar you can count on, that isn't a total sardine-fest or that doesn't have a bar line so long it makes your eyeballs want to fall out.Drafts are $8 (with tax). They also have Magner's cider on tap.Note: Located in the Fitzpatrick Hotel, but Wheeltapper has its own separate entrance (can't miss it).Thanks, Wheeltapper for being a solid spot!",3,1,2

15,Jayleen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,3.0,3/11/2018,"Let's see. A friend and I, after attending an event, and very hungry, saw the Wheeltapper and decided to endeavor. A generic looking pub. Upon walking in around 6:45, we saw that the location was full! We had a drink at the bar and then sat at a table. We were greeted by the sweetest waitress. She had red hair. I can't recall her name, but I would come back just for the impeccable service she offered us. The food was expensive for a pub. $22 for a quinoa salmon salad. A bit high. The waiters seemed rushed and busy for a Sunday. Absolutely swamped. Honestly, I only wrote this review is because I too used to wait tables, and it can be tremendously hard to keep the service at 100%. The red-headed girl did exactly that. Otherwise... this spots is chill. Not amazing but not terrible.",,,

Updated review","UPDATE: This place still blows. Gets super crowded because it is a default for offices in midtown, but it just sucks. Service is just so so bad. They will continue to exist from hotel guests and nearby offices. Don't do it!",,,
17,Robert R.,"Atlanta, GA",51,246,0,5.0,5/29/2017,This pub is attached to/next door to the Fitzpatrick Hotel. This is a great place to get a pint at the end of the night or breakfast in the morning. The staff are very welcoming and the pints are cold.,,,
18,Teagan R.,"New York, NY",186,242,50,4.0,6/13/2017,"Really fun bar in midtown - it's nice because they have an outdoor space (with heaters, weather depending). I've visited the Wheeltapper a few times - before venturing out to CitiField and even on St Pats (while meeting up with a friend in town). They have great happy hour deals and the service is pretty good. Can't say either way regarding the food.",,,
19,Malcolm R.,"Brooklyn, NY",485,165,219,4.0,9/20/2016,"Pretty nice outdoors area (that is almost always crowded near happy hours), decent selection of beers, and better food than you might expect. It's one of the better bar options in the area. A bit more upscale than your average Irish place. The outdoor space includes space heaters and often seem to be a server short of being able to meet the demand - at times you'll be waiting a bit for drinks, but overall it's worth it given alternatives. The inside features cozy wooden walls and there are multiple booths along with bar seating.One great thing they offer is a ""in a hurry"" lunch special that promises to get you in & out in like, 30 minutes or something.",1,,
20,Daniel A.,"Abington, PA",0,56,20,1.0,4/8/2017,"Ok. $16 for 2 small pancakes that took 20 minutes to make. We asked for some bread for our hungry 2 year old while waiting for the pancakes and they charged $4. Ordered 2 coffees= $8. Waiter said ""it's a good portion"". $8 a pancake for small, sad food. Lesson learned.",1,1,
21,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,2.0,9/7/2016,"Wheeltapper can be easily missed if you aren't looking for it - it has a relatively nondescript storefront, and inside, the front bar is relatively small. But if you wander back, you'll notice more space, and then voila - you are outside! It's a nice little respite from the hectic nature of Midtown, but given how packed it can get outside when it is nice, it may not feel all that relaxing. The beer selection is okay, but the Lagunitas IPA on tap was quite flat, and the bar food is pretty much that - pretty standard. The mozzarella sticks were quite nice, and the chicken quesadilla was cheesy and filling, but the food did not particularly stand out much either. Another downside is that although there are tarps that can roll out when it starts raining, it ends up making the space underneath extremely stuffy and humid...not a great feeling or situation.I wouldn't mind coming back again, but to be honest, I'd probably stay inside and enjoy one of the booths next time. The (very) wooden finishes indoors give it a bit more of a retro feel that is more enjoyable than being surrounded by nondescript buildings on the back porch.",1,,
22,Alli K.,"New York, NY",96,228,232,1.0,9/23/2016,"Location. Location. Location. The Wheeltapper Pub definitely has this one thing going for it. If you're looking for a place close to Grand Central that is good for groups, takes reservations, and isn't going to break the bank, this might be your joint.If you're looking for good service and a good experience, this place might not live up to your high expectations. I went to the Wheeltapper with a group of colleagues. We had a reservation for six on the patio. It was dinner time, and we were hangry... No seriously. HANGRY! The patio is very nice, and they even have retractable awnings for bad weather. Although our reservation was for six, there were only five chairs, and they were crammed at an awkward table in the corner with a huge pole and a mini tree making it difficult to maneuver. They added a chair no problem, but it was a tight squeeze.We were given happy hour menus, and when we asked for regular menus as well, we were given two. Two menus for six people. Then after about 10 minutes they took one of the menus away. One menu for six people. It was almost like they didn't want us to order food... We ordered a round of drinks, appetizers, and six entrees. It took more than 30 minutes for the appetizers to come out, and then almost another 30 minutes for the entrees. One entree was completely forgotten about, and that person didn't get her food until everyone else was done eating. Two people at the table ordered burgers with gruyere cheese. The burgers appeared with Swiss cheese. There was some sort of party going on on the patio, and the music got pretty loud. The only upside to the evening was that there was a vendor giving away free Guinness and engraved Guinness glasses. None of had the drink, but we did get some glasses, which was pretty nice. I doubt this is a regular occurrence though. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. But, like I said.... LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION!",,1,
23,Noelle T.,"Nolensville, TN",145,372,292,3.0,10/21/2016,"I didn't seek out the Wheeltapper, I was staying in the adjacent hotel and found myself hungry at 10:00pm. Of course, I ordered the Bread Pudding (See My Sweet of New York list.). Bread pudding happens to be my favorite dessert so I have high standards. The bread pudding was properly soaked, but it didn't have a lot of flavor beyond bread. The ice cream was typical of a chain restaurant, you know the kind they usually give kids for free at places like Cheddar's or Applebee's? (The kind that tastes like chunks of ice and air.) In general, the Wheeltapper was a little smokey and seemed more like a pit stop for a drink than a place to eat. If you want a beer, give this place a try. If you want a meal, look elsewhere. There are so many proper places to eat in NYC, why settle?",,,
24,Mariya M.,"Rego Park, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/8/2018,"I agree with reviewers who complained about wait staff. Not even a full bar. We were waiting for ten minutes for table to be cleaned. The glasses were picked up the table never wiped. Did it myself (was too tired to look for another place after half day of walking). Another 20 minutes for menus. It was 4 of us, we got 3 menus and 3 sets of cutlery. Why? I really did not understand. They serve bar / finger food, we asked for napkins, never got it. Why soup is coming with a main course. Yes we asked for appetizers to come earlier. We did not think we will have to eat our main course cold because our soups came together with soup. Why do you put several sides on the menu and don't ask what person want for the side. Why you decide for us for our money. The french onion soup was so spicy, could not taste anything beside pepper.  Chips on the other hand were super salty (inedible). What can I say at the end. We'll never return.",,,
25,Joanne W.,"Highlands, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,6/7/2018,"Ate here yesterday with friends.  Good burger but I asked for mashed potatoes instead of the fries and was charged $6 extra for them.  The worst part was when we got up to leave, there was a huge, and I mean HUGE, cockroach crawling out from under our table!  We'll never go back to this place that's for sure!",,,

After a 3 Star review I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat here...but the food and drinks were absolutely fabulous! I got the cedar plank salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.

I found a table in the corner and we waited quite a while until I flagged a server for drink menus. 15 minutes later I flagged another guy to order drinks, and he did not look pleased we had vouchers.I got the Barefoot Beachcomber, made of sparkling wine, coconut vodka and pineapple juice, $14. Stephen had a Guinness on draft, $8.Service to get the drink was slooooooow, and we never found anyone to cash us out. Assuming it's 100% free, I left $3 tip and walked out.",2,1,1
30,Julie C.,"Beacon, NY",47,36,32,4.0,2/5/2016,"I would give this place a 5 star, except for the twice lost reservation.  Confirmed in the morning and they did not have the reservation we made the day before in person and even though we made another reservation the morning of, they did not have the reservation when we arrived.  Not such a big deal waiting 15 minutes, except when the pub is jam packed and louder than a day care center with 200 gleeful children.On to the service and the meal.  Service doesn't get better than this.  We were a party of 7 and while the place was full to capacity, we never felt as if we were lacking service.  We ordered the potato skins and asparagus as an appetizer and I have to tell you... The best potato skins I have ever had in my entire 54 years.  5 out of 7 of us ordered their most famous Fish n' Chips.  I have been fortunate to eat fish n' chips around the world, but this place has somehow mastered the fine art of fish to batter ratio like I have never experienced.  The fish is so white, moist and fresh (that sounds odd) - but really people.  It is by far worth the noise, worth the double lost reservations.  In fact, as I write this on a very snowy morning... I am dreaming about having this again for lunch.  Bottom line: have a few cocktails or not. You will wind up being part of the party of noise. Highly recommend this place for the best Fish n' Chips known to (this) womankind.",1,,1

I've been a number of times and it definitely is a great after work spot. The best part about the entire place is the back patio. There's a really large area outside in the back. In the summer it's awesome and even when it gets a little chillier they keep it open and have heat lamps. Also, they have this retractable roof that they can put on and off if it's going to rain or just not nice weather, so people can still use the back patio. It's a great feature! The location is awesome and they happen to have some awesome beers on tap. I personally always order my favorite drink, which is blueberry stoli and seltzer. So happy they have blueberry stoli because most places don't. Would definitely recommend stopping by if you're looking for a drink spot near grand central!",3,,

We arrived and it was packed and only ONE waitress was on staff. She was so busy that she seemed furious to have one more table to deal with when we arrived. When she took our drink order, she sped us along and almost left mid-order because it was taking more than a second for my friend to decide. We then waited twenty minutes for our drinks to arrive. Then another twenty before she took our food order. Then we waited FIFTY minutes for two burgers and nachos which were horribly overpriced, clearly reheated, and burnt to a crisp. We mentioned this to the waitress and although we said we would still eat it (as we were starving and didn't want to wait again), she immediately grabbed it away and said she'd come back with a new plate. The new one took 15 more minutes to arrive. And even after all of this, they took nothing off our order and didn't apologize once for anything that took place. Never going back here.",,,

In stead of the 2 mains with avocado we order now 2 appetizers and a side dish of chorizo sweet potato fries and 1 one main dish remains the same. Now we don't get our free drinks... We asked the waitress, for it was not our fault that we had to changed plates, but no, that can't be done.And we wait for half an hour. Then somebody of the staff tells us that our food is really on the way but they had to make the fries from scratch. Another 20 minutes later our food arrived but in stead of putting it nicely on the table it was rudely put on top of cutlery, not in front of the person and altogether uninterested. When pointed out that we were a bit confused by this treatment our waitress pointed out that we just had to rearrange the placemats, the cutlery and the napkins. The turkey melt was small and dry. The quesadillas were nice. The sweet potato fries were not fries at all but normal baked potatoWhen asked for the check, it is presented to us with the info that the one drink that we consumed which was not going with the menu is on the house because it is my birthday.

38,Myrna C.,"New York, NY",407,154,63,1.0,6/12/2016,"Wow. What a weird experience here at The Wheeltapper Pub. I would give it 0 stars if I could ...Came for a goodbye party for a co-worker leaving. I started off the night with a Malibu Coke. Their drinks come out in large glasses, which is nice, but it ends up being so diluted. Not that I mind since I don't really drink much to begin with, but if Malibu didn't have a distinct pineapple / coconut taste to it, I would have thought I was drinking straight up Coke. Also, it was super difficult to hail the bartender's attention. He had already turned to someone else who showed up after me, and I pretty much had to tell him I was here first before he started paying attention to me. My other friend stood there for so long and he never once acknowledged her. It wasn't until someone else came up to order and he had to order her drink for her.However, as if that wasn't enough, we ordered a few appetizers to share and they came out on the table. One of them didn't seem like something we ordered but we were like, hm, maybe someone in our group did and we didn't know. Just as I was picking the food off the plate, a waiter came by and said ""This is not yours."" The potato was in mid-air and I awkwardly looked around, unsure of what to do. I thought, okay, if it's not ours and you don't want me to eat it, I can put it back, but you can't serve this again, so I'm not sure what to do. My boss told me to just eat it. We would pay for it if we were charged for it. However, the waiter rudely grabbed the plate out of my hands and said again ""Don't eat it!"" I was shocked at how someone could treat their patron in this way. They are just going to throw it out anyway, why do you have to do that? Unless they are serving it again, which that is just disgusting. We also found a random piece of calamari in our mozzarella sticks.Most definitely not coming back.",1,1,1

While most of staff is good and you don't have to wait long to get your drink but if you go to the patio (courtyard), you always wait ages to get your check and most of the times you need to go yourself to the bar to pay. They take it as a non-written rule indeed. The blonde waitress however is really rude. Try to avoid her.

Their service is definitely hit or miss - and I've have the super quick and attentive and the super slow. I feel like if you come in here knowing what to expect you won't be disappointed and take it for what it is. I like enjoying my time without anyone pestering me. The bar is super chill. The back terrace is a great place for a late lunch when the rest of Manhattan is working and you are just enjoying your time in a little secret garden.",,,
46,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2209,8239,2.0,12/7/2012,"This is a decent place to grab a drink after work in the GCT area.  However, in the winter I don't recommend sitting in the patio area.Went here to catch up with an old colleague and the front part of this surprisingly deep place was packed, but the lady said we could sit on the heated and covered patio.  That was fine, so we went and grabbed a table.  Service was friendly although the guy never seemed to understand what we wanted, even if we pointed to it on the menu.  I was less than thrilled with the pedestrian beer selection, but went with a winter lager and it was okay.Ordered sliders and nachos.  Waiter comes back and says they're out of sliders!  Denied!  Went with the chicken quesadilla instead.  Took a long time (like 45 minutes) for food to come, but whatever, we're just catching up.  Once it got there, food was actually okay, although the quesadilla was kind of cold so I knew it had been sitting awhile.This is all fine, but slowly, the place starts filling up with cigarette smoke and I realize that tons of people are smoking.  Mind you, even though it's a patio, it's covered and heated and in 35 degree weather you can sit there with just a shirt on so it's not outside by any stretch.  That was kind of a turn off.  The final turnoff was poor Sameer.  He and his bros were pounding shots at the table next to us, because, you know, they're awesome.  So he takes one tequila shot and then immediately vomits.  But because he's a tough dude (and he succumbs to peer pressure easily) he took another one and kept it down. Way to puke and rally, Sameer!Maybe it's just me, but when I'm having a friendly meal and beer with a friend, I'm not so much into being surrounded by vomit and cigarettes.  I know I was on the East Side so I should have expected as much, but that's just not my scene, bro.Also, six beers, nachos and the quesadilla totalled $80.  The food alone was $30 and would have been a value at $15.  At $30, just way overpriced.If you go (and you're not a smoker or a puker) try to get a seat inside.  That probably would have been at least 3 stars.  But outside...I would not tap that.",4,5,

He was super friendly and accommodating to all of our requests and didnt mess up any orders- very impressiveThey have a good beer selection (cannot comment on wine because I didnt have it that night). The food is also great- we got nachos and mozzerella sticks and both were delicious. The nachos were made with blue corn chips instead of regular ones which gets extra *s in my book!

Have you been to a bar and asking for water, she would stand there pointing to the water pitcher on the table and say ""do it yourself"". She would just stand there do nothing. Later when you ask her for help, while she being completely useless and unhelpful, she'd roll her eyes and interrupt when you try to ask someone else about it. Honestly, it is truly a shame for wheel tapper to be a quite cute spot for happy hours for many to tolerate a staff like that to ruin it for customers.

Updated review","I stopped by on a Saturday around 5:30, and the pub was nearly empty. I was told the patio outside was open, and it really is a gorgeous patio. It took almost 10 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge us and bring us menus, even though we had passed him on our way out to the patio. He barely spoke above a whisper the entire time (dark haired guy - bill said Ziya). After about 10 more minutes, someone else brought my drink out. It took another 10-15 minutes and another request for water for him to bring waters out to our table. When he did, they were in the smallest glasses I've never seen with no ice...must be too much work to ice an iced water. The entire time he seemed more concerned with a larger party in the corner and the potential tip he was going to get out of them. Once we ordered our food actually came out fairly quickly. There was nothing spectacular about it, and especially for the prices, and the fries that they charge an additional $5.50 for were overdone.  Both burgers were overcooked as well.  Our food was, once again, brought out by someone else. At that time, our waiter had to have walked past our table (to the large party) a minimum of 12 times without ever acknowledging that our food arrived, asking how it was, or refilling drinks. We had been finished eating for close to 20 minutes before our waiter ever came over, and that was only because we stared him down. He then dropped off our check with an automatic 15% gratuity added. As a waitress, I'm well aware of how gratuity works and have never seen it on a party of two before. I also have no problem paying gratuity (plus extra) if the service warrants it. However for someone who barely spent 2 minutes at our table, there was absolutely no reason a gratuity should have been added other than to try and make sure he received a tip he in no way deserved. I asked a manager to remove the gratuity as I felt the horrendous service hardly warranted the waiter receiving an automatic 15% tip. Unfortunately, once it was removed the waiter brought it back over to our table and was very rude about us ""not wanting to pay a tip"", as if there was no way he could understand why we felt he didn't deserve the amount of the gratuity. I would sincerely recommend taking your business elsewhere. Management seems to know what they're doing, but the service staff is terrible and really could care less about their guests.",,1,
66,Matt V.,"Manhattan, NY",36,173,158,4.0,3/13/2016,This has become my midtown east goto spot for casual day drinking. This watering whole on the ground floor of the Fitzpatrick Hotel has a definitely strong Dublin vibe. There is a very impressive selection of draft beers pumping on an old fashioned tap with very friendly staff. I have tried their sandwiches and nachos and really enjoyed both. There is a backbar and also an outdoor area in the rear that is big with the midtown happy hour crowd.,1,,

70,David Z.,"Long Beach, NY",76,42,8,2.0,7/25/2014,"After many years working in Midtown I treat menu prices the way I treat fiction- willing suspension of disbelief. So, I won't bemoan the ridiculous $16 Reuben or $15 BLT (no fries, those are $5.50 more, but hey, it's Midtown, right). The one thing about overpaying for basic food is that it should at least be good. Maybe not great, maybe not the best sandwich you ever had, but at least not total crap. Or, even if total crap, at least promptly delivered by a friendly server. Or, even if total crap that takes too long and is delivered by an unfriendly server, at least you get what you ordered. Unfortunately, The Wheeltapper failed to meet even the lowest possible standard. The food was overpriced, took 45 minutes to get a salad and 2 sandwiches, the server didn't seem to have much interest in his tables, the quality was terrible and one of us got the wrong food (to be fair, they did take the appalling BLT we didn't order off the check, bringing the total for lunch for 3 to a mere $60 after tip).Funny enough we had a similar experience a few weeks ago, but we figured it was a fluke. It wasn't. So I guess the best thing I can say about The Wheeltapper is that it is consistent.",2,1,1

It was a Saturday night when I came here for a quick bite to eat before jumping on the train at Grand Central. When I arrived, the place was a ghost town; a few taken tables scattered throughout the multi-room bar area. Our server came to take our drink order while we waited for the remainder of our group. Upon checking out the menu we realized the choices were quite limited, though I will say the wings were quite tasty. The service for the remainder of our time there was atrocious... the bartender refusing to leave the bar, and the one waitress engrossed in conversation with some regulars; she was actually sitting at their table with her back to us. Awesome! Besides that the prices were pretty steep for what you got portion wise, and the beer selection was pretty lacking (in quality, not quantity) for an English pub.Not really surprised this place doesn't get crowded; even on a Saturday night and in such a prime location.

The food was a bit greasy and unappealing, but I am not a bar food person- they didn't have one healthy appetizer item on the menu.  Chicken satay would have been nice.On the whole though, the group had a great time, and I would recommend it for a good time.",,,1

The back porch, which you get to by going through the old hotel, is cleverly decorated like an old railway with girders and cables and whatnot. I thought it was an excellent idea.

Bartender at front bar was great.  THE BAD-warm beer!  This is unconscionable at hotel bar charging these prices.  Both the tap and bottled beer at the back bar were warm. Smithwicks was sour, and other tap beers were flat.  You can tell this place doesn't care about the product, only about the profit.  Beer at the front was colder, but not ideal. Will not return.",,,
95,Cynthia L.,"New York, NY",0,41,10,4.0,12/5/2013,"Solid pub in Midtown East, close to GC to get drinks.  I'd been here many times before I made this reservation with Nisha in their food/bev team about a week ahead for a semi-private area for about 30.  She didn't even make us put down a deposit or sign any contracts.  Easy peasy.Our event was holiday drinks / final toast to the year - just drinks for 2.5 hours from 5pm.  Nisha arranged a nicely cordoned section of the back patio with seating and tables, and the bar to ourselves, exactly as I'd requested.  She had even arranged ""Reserved for --"" signage on our tables with our company name.  The patio was really festive for the holidays and nicely decorated with lights on trees and the heat lamps on with the patio cover up, so the warm air was nicely held in.  Noise/music was ambient so we could easily make conversation.Service was dependable and friendly and drinks were priced about $7 for bottled beer, $10 for call vodkas, and $9-11/each for shots.  We wound up spending roughly $45/person, (incl tax/tip; I saw the itemized bill the next day).I notice in the other reviews that smoking is permitted and agree that indeed would have been VERY unpleasant (and it's unfortunate they would allow that) but we didn't experience any smokers last night.   It couldn't have been a nicer, more laid-back, or easier to arrange place to go for casual, well-located and reasonably-priced team drinks near the office and we definitely plan to go back.",,,

The response of the manager on duty was one of 'not my problem. You can all sit inside if you want'. His staff actually made a huge effort to find a way of squeezing 20 people into an unreserved area but it soon became unmanageable and uncomfortable and we had no choice but to move inside - defeating the whole point of reserving an outside area on a summer's evening. The attitude of the duty manager was nothing short of appalling - no sense of customer service, no apology, no effort to find a solution to a problem he was responsible for fixing. Just rude, arrogant and dismissive. The location means this place will always have customers - but that doesn't justify crap management.",,,

The veggie ""sandwich"" JB got was just a pile of vegetables and a bun, and the burger I got was sub par at best. Messy and tasteless, a bad combination!

It's a fun place for after work drinks, but the patio gets minimal sunshine, so it's a lot chillier than you might imagine.

However, service is very spotty.  I ordered two beers and didn't see the waitress for at least 20 minutes.  To bypass this, I ordered my next beer at the bar and I was charged an extra beer for no reason.  A ghost beer, if you will.  And oh!  They will!  I corrected the fat fingered bartendress of her mistake and moved on.  However, I've seen plenty of ghost beers in my time.  Bartenders who, with a quick slip of the hand, find room within their poorly developed conscience to add an additional item or two to your bill in an attempt increase the contents of their tip jar.  I know most would-be victims haunted by the ghost beer would just sign the check and not even think twice.  Alcohol reduces the senses.  It happens.  I know that and others know that.  But you know who else knows that?  The bartenders know that.  Be wary when coming here.  I wouldn't come back here unless someone decided to host a party here, but even then, I would come up with some strong alternative suggestions.  If you don't have to catch a train at Grand Central, there are so many other bars where the ghost beer does not haunt.  It's worth it.  I'm scurred of ghosts!",1,3,

I like the color of the walls inside, its most definitely less overwhelming then the obnoxious wall hangings in those shenanigans type restaurants. The bar has a rustic feel and has cool color tones. While at Wheeltapper I had a few Magners here while I was waiting for a friend to come in and party on a weekend.

We should have left immediately as the place was warm and humid inside (maybe broken a/c). But being lazy drunks we chose to order a round or two and grab a booth. The place was filled with a few stragglers and some pals of the bartender.After our first round we decided to get more drinks. The bartender tells us that it is last call. This is where ""Meh. I've experienced better"" comes into play. It was only 12:45am. Yes I understand that if the place is empty the bartender can close whenever he or she feels like it. But why let us in a few minutes earlier?So we get our second round of drinks and then found out that it was no longer last call. Why? Well because the bartender's other friends had stopped in for some drinks. Fine by us. As one of my friends goes outside to smoke, he asks the bartender if he is still closing soon. The guy says no and my friend walks outside.Well a few minutes later I get a call on my cellphone. It is my friend locked outside the bar. Apparently the bartender ignored him trying to get back into the bar and decided to instead talk with his friends. So I came over to let my friend back into the bar. As I was about to unlock the door the bartender screams ""do not let anyone else in!"" I explain it is my friend who was already here. The guy says ""no one else is allowed in.""  I tell him too bad because my friend was already here and just bought us all a round of drinks. He then realizes it was indeed the guy he just spoke with and instead of apologizing just laughed and said finish up. I grew up in pubs, some of my best friends are bartenders, and you just do not treat people like this.This shitty bar was sucking from the moment we stepped into it.

143,Penelope J.,"New York, NY",24,193,50,2.0,10/28/2008,"I met a friend here for happy hour--and the place was sedate. Drinks prices were average for the Midtown area but the overall vibe was sort of depressing.Even though there were a few people sitting at tables, no one was really talking...it was bizarre. My friend, who is a regular at this bar for happy hours, said that 'they must be having an off night' [I think she was lie-telling and she really just enjoys dismal, morose bars ha].I don't think I'd come back for another happy hour...",1,1,1

145,Nico P.,"San Francisco, CA",125,22,2,2.0,9/17/2011,"Dark wood everything gives this place a nice vibe, I'm sure it's fun to hang out for a drink at night. But we were there for lunch, and it was overpriced and not great.  Had a tuna steak sandwich that was preposterously over-salted. Others around the table had dishes that were better (a ginger carrot soup, fish & chips, and a hamburger) but not great.",,,
146,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1048,1343,4446,4.0,6/28/2007,"The Wheeltapper is an Irish pub attached to the Fitzpatrick Hotel.  At the suggestion of one of our project team, we came here for happy hour and dinner after our project launch to unwind, hang out, and get to know each other.The place is pretty well-appointed on the inside, with lots of wood paneling and a good mix of booths and table seating.  When we arrived around 1830, it wasn't terribly busy, nor were there hordes of people when we left, around 2030 or so.  Our group ended up out on the back patio, which is somewhat like a quasi-alley, except that it's entirely enclosed by the outside of building walls on all sides.  One can look directly upward to see emergency exit stairs and building roofs, with a little patch of sky in the midst of the concrete/brick ugliness.The food here is pretty standard pub food.  Lots of fried things, a number of appetizers, burgers, salads, steaks, and a limited seafood selection.  The Manhattan that I ordered was done up quite well, although one of my coworkers stated that the gin and tonic she had wasn't quite as good as the ones I've made for her.  If not for the fact that she and I have been friends for ages, I would have attributed her statement to flattery, but I'm certain she would have readily told me if she thought the Wheeltapper staff's bartending was superior to mine.Our crew ordered various starters: quad sliders (simple and solid); calamari (the good stuff, with spicy sauce); bruschetta (fresh ingredients with balsamic vinegar); and onion rings (giant juicy ones, with crunchy breading).  No complaints on the food there.  A few folks ordered real entrees, and I had part of a tuna sandwich on a croissant, served on a bed of salad.  The serving sizes for meals here are pretty ridiculously huge, but the price is also correspondingly hefty.  A sandwich entree will run ~$15, with more extravagant dishes (steaks and seafood) going upwards of ~$30 or so.I'm glad that I wasn't footing the bill, and I'm glad that I came.  With the exception of some pretty spotty service (maybe it was because we were on the patio?), everything else about the experience was peachy.  Decent for a company happy hour, can't say I'd bring friends here for drinks or food, though.",1,,1
147,Sean M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",30,46,3,5.0,4/27/2011,"This is the perfect spot, literally one block from Grand Central Terminal. They pour an awesome pint of Guinness, and it's a nice venue with great food. It can get crowded sometimes so get there early. Avoid the weekends since it is connected to a Hotel, it gets busy with the tourists.",,,
148,Melissa M.,"Mooresville, NC",9,119,20,3.0,4/25/2011,"Friendly staff, quick service, decent food - including a free range chicken option for dinner. For a hotel meal this was very good. I had dinner one evening and breakfast the next morning. For once in a hotel my ""Irish oatmeal"" actually WAS Irish oatmeal. My one egg had a yolk so yellow you'd think it came from my own farm. Dinner for three was reasonably priced, appetizing, and quick. Drinks were reasonably priced for Manhattan and not ungenerously portioned. I would not only stay here (The Fitzpatrick) again, I would eat here again, any time!",,,
149,Tim Y.,"Lawrence, KS",13,31,18,5.0,4/23/2011,Great NY bar to catch some friends after work. Love the outdoor heated area.,,,
150,Jason R.,"New York, NY",49,261,13,3.0,4/23/2010,"The Wheeltapper is a normal after work happy hour place. Its close to GCT which makes it popular with commuters. They have an outdoor area which is rather big.  Nothing really special about this place, nothing really stands out.  Beers are a bit expensive about $7 each, and no happy hour specials.",1,1,1
151,Susan D.,"Bronx, NY",0,58,0,1.0,11/15/2011,"Went here for a lunch yesterday & quite honestly, the food was not very good for the prices they charge.  Their burger does not come with FF & if you want the FF, you will be charged another $4.50 - really ??  The roll the hamburger came on was semi-stale hard roll.  The prices are outrageous for lunch based on just your basic food selection.  It's a pub for crying out loud  - not the Palm.......",1,,
152,Jaime Z.,"Queens, NY",0,52,0,1.0,8/23/2012,"Ugh - worst Bloody Mary ever! It took a long time to be acknowledged, although the place was empty on a Saturday @ Noon. I was early for a train to CT but not THAT early. Anyway I have no idea what the bartender put in the drink but it tasted like she made it out of Tabasco Sauce and ice. I paid when I finally got the drink since it took so long to reach even that point. Anyway $12.00 with tip for an undrinkable Bloody Mary. I only got through about a quarter of it and left. Lesson learned. I am sure it's a different experience at night when things are well underway but avoid at brunch time!",,,

154,Garett N.,"El Cerrito, CA",107,542,0,3.0,3/7/2010,I've come here a few times for some post-work happy hours. Typically decent service and they seem to have a good range of drinks available. Recommended.,,,
155,Paul H.,"Austin, TX",4,65,0,4.0,3/26/2010,"If you're looking for a taste of the U.K., this is a good place for you. It's a pub and you should expect nothing more. Given that there are million pubs out there, this place differentiates itself in a few ways that I like: - Good seating (booths, community tables, bar) - A few sections that makes it feel like two pubs - Location (convenient to all) The pub grub is OK, but you really shouldn't go to places like that fine dining anyway. It's about the beer, whiskey, social and nothing more.",,,
156,Lorenzo B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,2,4.0,10/5/2009,Loved it! finally we found a place with very good food and with a real pub feeling.We went there with some friends who's office is in the area only to have a drink after work and we ended up spending the entire evening!Food is really good and the staff is very friendly.The patio in the back is really cool and most of all BIG! plenty of space for everyone.definitely going back soon.,,,
157,Mika Z.,"Queens, NY",14,371,503,2.0,1/17/2010,"I went here for drinks and we sat at the outside patio area. It's covered with heating lamps. The only drawback is that they allow people to smoke in this area. I paid about $9 for a glass of wine. The service was mediocre. The appetizers were terrible and not worth the price paid. We had ""House Made Potato Chips""/All natural no preservatives with warm Gorgonzola blue cheese sauce ($8). The cheese sauce had the consistency of water and all the blue cheese crumbles were at the bottom of this liquid cheese. I agree with Ben W. the chips are overcooked and unseasoned and they tasted like burnt french fries. We also ordered Bruschetta with Tomato and Basil ($8). The bread was tasty and made just right, not too hard and crispy and not soggy from the toppings. It was mainly tomato and I could barely taste any basil and I would like it to have a bit more garlic. The only thing that's cool about this place is the patio. Hopefully, they can make certain sections of the patio non-smoking for patrons that don't like smoke blown in their direction while drinking and eating!",1,,1
158,Twistidfunk y.,"New York, NY",0,43,0,4.0,3/12/2010,Cool pub.  Very cozy place with decent burgers.  They have a patio which is a huge plus and the afterwork crowd comes to let loose.   Can't wait for nice weather!,,,
159,Ian C.,"Long Island City, NY",54,386,3,3.0,7/25/2009,"I've been here a couple of times since it's really close to work. But it's not a place we go to often because it's kind of expensive.  It is a hotel bar, though, so it's kind of expected. I remember when we went here the first time, I was thinking about how small the space was.  Then I came here another time and realized there was a whole outdoor section that's pretty much open year round, so it's a lot bigger than I originally thought.  Even in the winter, it's covered and there are heating lamps.  And just yesterday, a bunch of colleagues and I went here and hung out drinking under the blue sky with brick buildings surrounding us.  As for food... when we wanted to order onion rings at 4pm, they didn't have anymore... that sucked because we really wanted that.  The chicken tenders were pretty good.  The honey-mustard sauce had a nice kick to it. Overall, not a bad place to sit outside and drink.  But not really a place to spend the whole day or evening.  Plus, the outside area closes at a certain time.",,,
