0,Kevin N.,"Forest Park, IL",20,91,175,3.0,10/26/2017,"Busy ABP located in the hospital. Not the best but this is a bit better than the Garden Cafe, however, it is more expensive. It also is quite busy during lunch time.ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 5/10Small and cramped, always feel awkward while waiting for your order because there is basically no room to stand around. No seating at all by the ABP.SERVICE : 6/10Average. I know they're busy, but they still don't really act like they are trying to push the pace at all.FOOD: 7/10The one redeeming quality is that the food is actually pretty decent. It may be a bit more expensive than the hospital cafeteria, but often it's worth it.PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 7/10Only because within the hospital, for a quick lunch, this is one of the few options available. If I have more time, I'd rather just run down 69th or 70th street and grab something better for a similar price.TO EAT OR NOT TO EAT: I guess if you have no choice then it's okay.OVERALL: 6/10",,,
1,Kate S.,"New York, NY",76,679,3081,4.0,2/19/2018,I have to say that the coffee here is fine and the mac and cheese is really satisfying when you're in this hospital visiting a family member and do not want to go too far to search for caffeine or food.,2,1,2
2,N J.,"Massapequa Park, NY",0,9,1,1.0,2/4/2018,"This place is disgusting. Staff unhygienic, eating nuts and other foods from the shelves as they work at the register, salad frozen, glass door for pastries is broken so you're lucky if you don't cut yourself on the glass, can't even close that broken sliding door so flies are all over the pastries. Gross. The broken glass door has been an issue for months. The only reason this place has any business is because it's in a busy hospital.",,,

The people are nice, but let me just summarize some things that i've been told which make my BP rise.1.) We are out of avocado2.) The oven is broken3.) We have no more cheese4.) we aren't accepting credit cards5.) We have no more bread6.) closed for construction",,,
4,Sharon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,733,856,3.0,10/22/2015,"Located inside the hospital building, Au Bon Pain is very busy with customers but has slow service. The line for hot food is long but there are many prepackaged food options such as sandwiches, fruit, soup, and salad. The morning oatmeal is thick and pasty but there's brown sugar, cinnamon and dairy or soy milk at the coffee station to doctor it up. The coffee's not bad, and there are a few different kinds. The seating area across the lobby has a cluster of electrical outlets in one corner, so if you bring a laptop also bring an extension cord.",2,2,2

7,Michael S.,"New York, NY",3,29,2,2.0,7/31/2016,"Got the Italian Wedding soup after trying to find something without cream or hot spices. Turns out the chef somehow snuck some chile pepper flakes into it, even though they list the ingredients above the soups and it says nothing about that. You can see the red flakes once you notice the extra kick and try to figure out the source. I looked up Italian Wedding soups online and could not find one that included chili peppers in it. They should really chastise the chef who thinks it's okay to just throw some spicy peppers in a dish without letting the customer in on it. The cashier couldn't hide his utter lack of interest in the matter and when I found the manager to discuss it, she said she had no control in the matter. She was going to tell the GM about it, so I will remain hopeful that others will be spared a spicy soup if they are not fans.",,,
8,James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2729,1914,8247,3.0,7/7/2015,"There was no line when I was here, which is amazing for 7:45am. I just had a cup of joe, but they had many other options for both breakfast and lunch that looked good, with sandwiches priced at about $7. They also had soup and delicious looking pastries. It's a very small location. I like the option of putting soy milk in my coffee, which is offered for free in the self-service stand outside the shop. Located right inside the main entrance to the hospital.",4,3,5
9,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,3.0,1/11/2012,"Last year, when Au Bon Pain decided to sweep into Cornell and take over the various ""Garden Cafes"" around the different buildings, I was excited yet curious. Excited that I would have some commercial company spooning out baked goods just a few flights of stairs down from my downtown office. Curious as to how it was all going to pan out, if things would change drastically.Well, a good year or so into it, and I'm pleased...enough.Au Bon Pain has taken over three areas of NY-Pres. / Weill Cornell Medical Center: there is a 24 hour operation in the East 68th Street Entrance Lobby, a morning / afternoon operation adjacent to the East 70th Street Lobby (Starr Pavilion Lobby), and a morning / afternoon operation in the R.O. Perelman Heart Center Lobby in the center of the 4th Floor, Greenberg Pavilion. The latter two (Starr Pavilion and Heart Center) both have the basic pastries, coffees and Harney Teas, and a few sandwiches / salads / snack containers. The 24 hour operations boasts all of that, plus soups, made - to - order sandwich bar, and the largest selection of pastries (cupcakes and other more ""desserty"" pastries included).Due to the high volume of customers hospital-wide, both staff and guest...and the occasional patient, items do tend to run out quickly. It can be very hit or miss. I won't lie: I've hit all three operations just to get my precious brie and cracker snack containers. One may have none, one may have only containers of grapes and watermelon, and the last may only have hummus and cucumbers. This seems to change constantly. Consistency is not their strongest suit. However, if you want to talk about pastries and desserts, the 24 hour operation has squelched my sweet tooth on many an afternoon. I must admit, though mass-produced, their Red Velvet Cupcakes, Chai Whoopie Pies, and Chocolate Mocha Whoopie pies are damn near ecstasy-inducing. The Heart Center operation provides an ample amount of seating for guests, while the other two are definitely for ""grab 'n' go"". The 24 hour operation is so painfully cramped and crowded, I'm surprised people are not constantly spilling hot coffee all over each other.I do not this place enough to ever get an actually get a meal from any of the three, but they provide me with a nice snack break when I don't feel like walking over to 1st Avenue to Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks. This franchise is a welcomed addition to the campus, and it certainly serves it's purpose: providing food to hungry people.",2,1,1

Updated review","Had to stop here a second time for something to eat while waiting. Ugh.... still flies. Don't know why they don't take care of that.The sandwich lady this time was nicer and actually offered to warm up my roast beef... just the roast beef. The rest of the sandwich was cold and hard, but at least the meat softened up the cheese a bit.",,,
11,Jiahui L.,"Manhattan, NY",32,355,40,2.0,7/20/2012,"Get:~bran muffin (3 stars): solid, with some raisins, decently moist inside, and some not crispy anymore oats on top to garnish.  Definitely not for the muffin top lover, as it's got nearly the same consistency throughout, but it's one of their better wares. $2Skip:~scones (2 stars): not biscuity enough nor moist enough, just kind of dry throughout but leaving that aftertaste that processed foods often do.  $2Needless to say, there are definitely way better bakeries out there, but when you're stuck in lectures until 1pm, sometimes there's no better alternative.",,,
12,Aeeza L.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",18,90,1976,4.0,7/10/2013,"This place always has plenty of pastries on the shelves, and freshly made wraps and sandwiches are mostly good. Soups are always a good choice. My favorite is the veggie soup and almond croissant. It is what it is. I gave it 4 starts because without it, there won't be any place to get food in the hospital and the medical library without walking out of the building.",1,1,1
13,Chelsea D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",715,526,1682,2.0,5/11/2012,"The food is good, just like it is at all ABPs.  The soups are fantastic, and the macaroni and cheese is also delicious.  But that stuff is predetermined and premade, so the service is what really matters.The lines move slowly here, and that's on the weekends.  I can't imagine what it's like when the hospital is busier during the week.  The place is also short and narrow and with more than a few customers, no one comfortably fits.",3,3,3

Updated review","a decent place to grab something to eat when visiting the hospital which i personally do not like to visit but that's life. the location is on the left side of the lobby across from the info desk with an inclosed area to get a sandwich, soup, coffee, water , soda , yogurt, some fruit, pastries, etc. when it's busy the  2 cashiers  keep the lines moving. the seating area in the lobby has enough tables to sit or you can go on any floor like i do and find the lounge area to enjoy your soup and chicken salad wrap . for a big hospital like presy. i am surprised that there is no big cafeteria on the premises like the one on general hospital or another fictional hospital . the prices are about the same as other bon pain in the city and even though the size and selection is not extensive as other spots it's still better then trekking along 1st and 2nd ave looking for food. overall a 3 star rating .",4,2,2
15,James A.,"Manhattan, NY",9,465,214,3.0,1/8/2012,"This is a basic version of a typical Au Bon Pain, inside of the hosptial lobby.  They have a fresh sandwich section and a bunch of other items that most people would want.  They do not have a full variety or a major stuck, but it is good enough.  About 50 feet from the store are a bunch of indoor tables to sit and enjoy your food.",,,
