0,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,528,127,3.0,10/26/2018,"Hey so it's KFC, it's fast food, it's in the middle of the busiest hood in nyc Times Square, it's a food court style setup, so yes expect not the best operation. It's small, and there is usually a line. It's expensive for what you get, but hey as one of few KFCs in all of manhattan, can't complain. I came here once because I needed my KFC fix. I waited probably 15 minutes in line. The register dude was semi-incompetent. But end of the day I got what I wanted with little fuss.",,,
1,Bob G.,"San Francisco, CA",19,1,0,1.0,11/11/2018,"Security needs to be improved. Homeless man stole two tenders and macaroni from my table. Staff refused to replace it. I know they're covered by ""not responsible for lost or stolen items"" policy, but they had a chance to make an unhappy customer feel better, and they chose not to.",,,
2,Emily J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,10/5/2018,"When I went, I was immediately served and helped out mistake in ordering. The server was nice, giving me an extra piece of chicken and was patient with me. I recommend this place for a quick and cheap meal!",,,
3,Andie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,638,92,2.0,11/16/2017,"A collection of four fast food places in one location - Pizza Hut, Tim Hortons, Nathan and KFC. All of the stores are close together and share supplies which makes me think that one person own all four franchises. There is always a line even after the lunch crowd is over. The staff is always slow and disorganized while the food doesn't taste fresh especially for the city price. Other fast food chains have fresh and hot tasting food with more affordable prices.",2,,
4,Diego M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",46,5,1,3.0,5/30/2018,"My nephews really like this fried chicken so we go to KFC at least once a week. The kids enjoy their root beer floats and they often get either the 3 piece tenders, the popcorn nuggets or the macaroni salad. When they get one of the chicken dishes I usually order a few sides to go with them. And although the kids always want fries sometimes I get them mashed potatoes with gravy, corn or cole slaw or bisquits. You never have to worry about breaking the bank at this place and that's something I can't complain about. Servings are reasonable; you get a lot and the environment is friendly. Not bad at all for a fast food restaurant.",,,1
5,Alex M.,"Short Hills, NJ",237,3,0,1.0,7/26/2018,The line doesn't move. It doesn't really matter whether their chicken is good because you need to wait 45 minutes to have a shot at getting any. The service was slower than a real restaurant. The Colonel would not be pleased.,,1,
6,Sungmo Y.,"Rego Park, NY",4,7,2,1.0,9/7/2017,"All of the registers clearly say that if you don't receive a receipt, your meal is on us. Yet I just experienced this and cashier just stared at me like I was crazy. I almost left the store when I looked in my bags to see if she put the receipt in them, but it was not there. So I turned back and went to the register, waited like 5 minutes until the cashier who took my order was done with next customer, and politely requested her to keep the promise. Yet all I got was a nasty stare. My receipt was thrown in garbage that she had to dig in to grab it. Why advertise something you won't keep?I demand somebody from management addresses my issue. I would like a refund.",1,,
7,Destiny R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",15,2,1,1.0,7/25/2018,"First and foremost, this KFC is very messy and unorganized. I came here for the first time on my break since I work around the corner and the manager was very rude. I received the wrong meal and when I went to tell them , the manager insisted on helping me. My cookie was hard as rocks, almost broke my teeth eating it. The service here sucks! Customer service isn't that hard people!!!!! Especially if you're working in such a busy place! I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",,,
8,J K.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,3.0,6/9/2018,I go to this KFC often for their wings.  Counter staff are always friendly.  Not giving it full 5 stars mainly because the place itself isn't well kept up (it shares with other food venues).  But typical for Times Square area.,1,,
9,Jackie B.,"New York, NY",1,27,20,1.0,11/7/2017,"Ordered food here about a week ago. Chicken was dry and the macaroni and cheese was MOLDY!! I spit it out as soon as I tasted it. YUCK! Almost stopped me from going to KFC altogether, but definitely stopped me from coming to this location ever again.",1,1,
10,Torterry C.,"Berlin, Germany",100,572,2416,3.0,1/7/2016,"I have been to many KFCs before, but I haven't been to one which is right next to Pizza, this is a prefect place for my friend who happened to like them both. The place wasn't big at all though, it seems to me more like a pick up station than regual KFC. But it still got most of food you can order on the regular KFC's menu. Since its location really close to Times Square, that means it could be really crowdy sometime. There have only 2 seats on the ground floor, you can find the seats at the basement. This place also open 24 hours, quite convenient, if you got hungry at the midnight.",1,,1
11,Matt V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,1,1.0,3/17/2018,This kfc is the worst you need to shut this place down. The service is horrible the food the sell is not what u get,,,
12,Aaron C.,"Bronx, NY",116,9,5,3.0,7/4/2016,"I usually come to this location on my break. It's not the most clean looking location but it's convenient and there's normally not a line. But today, July 4th, there was an extremely long line of 14 people. One cashier and two people in the back. Manager on duty, Adou, is walking around the seating area while the one cashier, Kady, rings customer and preps the meals. No effort to help her by opening up a second register or help prep the meals while she rings. And when he finally decides to assist her, he takes 10 minutes to count out a drawer instead of just taking card transactions. This experience definitely turned me off but on a positive note, the cashier remained super positive and friendly and my meal was prepared extremely quickly, thanks to her. Solution: more efficient manager!",1,,
13,Dawn L.,"New York, NY",661,17,0,1.0,9/23/2016,"Worst fast food experience in my life!  The girl at the register forgets to include the cookie, which is part of my meal, and then they serve ROCK hard biscuits that bent my fork.  While I'm eating the idiot that sweeps the floor brushes the broom on my foot (which is in the air)  twice!!!  Disgusting.  Food is low quality.  I have offically converted to Popeye's after this horrible experience.  How are they able to pay rent serving this kind of food?",2,1,1
14,Steven W.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",61,1,0,1.0,3/17/2017,I wish I could give this place half a star. They only sandwich/burger was the little burger. Terrible tasting food. I understand now why KFC in America gets a bad name this food is disgusting! You all need to try KFC is Australia! Why the hell so I get wedges instead of the KFC famous fries!,,,
15,Vinnie F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,1.0,9/12/2015,"This place is dirty smelly and if you decide to eat here you will vomit. KFC is one of my f favorite restaurants, but this was horrible. Also if you like KFC and your near this place, just stop by McDonald's. Trust me it is the better choice. Even though McDonalds is not healthy. Also what a dump.",,,
16,Kamiar N.,"Linköping, Sweden",0,2,1,1.0,7/14/2015,"One star is even too much for this place. Smelly, dirty, disgusting place. The worst place to go in the first day you visit new york city. Don't even think about it.",,,
