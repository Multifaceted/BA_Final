When I walked in I was actually pretty excited to see the selection of cheeses, crackers, and a nice range of snacks ranging from healthy to indulgent. Plus it looked pretty clean for a NYC convenience store. We came up to the counter with some crackers, cheese, two small bags of snacks, two protein bars, and one bottle of Andre (yea, the $6 cheap stuff.) With no prices on the items, we were still expecting like $40 tops for it all. That's when the clerk blurted out $70 dollars. OHMYGOD, what now? It turns out they're charging $30 for a bottle of Andre. Are you kidding me?! Â Besides that, all the other items were priced way higher than normal, even for NYC convenience standards. We put the bottle back and spent $40 dollars on just those 2 bags of snacks, a tiny box of crackers, a little cheese, and 2 protein bars. LMAO. We honestly should have just walked out.On top of it all, the guy who was checking us out was a total jerk about it! When we questioned his pricing on the ""champagne"" that's literally no more than $10 ANYWHERE, he got real sassy. Based on service and prices alone, I have no idea why anyone who spend their money here.",24

While the staff later admitted they just didn't bother checking - the owner was a profane SOB who couldn't have cared less about poisoning customers. If I wasn't having a violent allergic reaction I might have noticed just how bad the food was. Typically trashy of the Times Square thereabouts.,

This past Wednesday 10/17/18, I went in for a smoothie. It was made for me and given to me which I then took over to the cashier to pay for. Upon giving her the $10 bill she looked at it funny and then tore a piece and said she didn't want to take it. I was very confused because it wasn't a big bill nor had she done anything to determine the bill was fake. It just so happened a lawyer was also there and she told them it was illegal to reject my money without any proof of it being fake. I was not only embarrassed but i also felt racially profiled because there was absolutely no reason to reject my money. I asked to speak to the boss who was very rude. He said he didn't want to take the risk even though he didn't know for sure if it was fake. He also asked the lawyer why is she butting into this business which has nothing to do with her. After he threatened to call the police, which I told him to do so if he wanted because he was the only one doing something illegal, he gave the $10 bill to one of the employees and made me wait in the store while he took it two blocks down to chase bank, to confirm whether or not it was fake. The employee returned with a newer $10 and said that the bank confirmed THE BILL WAS REAL AND IT WAS JUST AN OLD BILL. I didn't even receive, at the least, an apology for the way I was treated. I would not recommend anyone going here not only are they more expensive than other deli's in the area, there have been times when I didn't get a certain fruit for my smoothie because they were rotten and another coworker of mine stopped going there because they put rotten avocado on her sandwich. They are also extremely rude and unprofessional. If you are going to reject money then you need to have the PROPER WAY TO DETECT AND PROVE IT IS COUNTERFEIT. I have told everybody at my job not to eat here anymore and I will continue to voice this because the way I was treated over a REAL $10 BILL WAS A DISGRACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will also be filing a civil lawsuit. I do not recommend anyone eating here.",2

Updated review",223,1,"Manhattan, NY",Rod B.,0,1.0,20,"Just spent half an hour at this place watching a ham sandwich getting carried back and forth from the deli to the cashier and back three times, with no one telling me why I can't have it or even willing to talk to me.The owner was the cashier, and rings me up for $12-something. I show him where it says ""PREPAID"" -- for $8.66. He says ""forget it, forget it"" and slides my sandwich aside. I said I paid and you have my food, what gives?""Forget it, forget it!"" louder now, and yells to the deli guy. I walk over there and the guy turns around, refuses to acknowledge I'm asking him what in the world is going on.I call Seamless and they talk to the owner, who lies and says he never got the order. They resend it immediately so he has to admit he has it, but still won't give me the sandwich.They get back on the line with me and I explain I've now been watching the sandwich get passed around for 15 minutes. Seamless calls again and all hell breaks loose, with the 3 people panicking and yelling at each other. None of them will pick up the phone.I'm already home 10 minutes later when the rep comes back on the line. I say let me guess, they didn't pick up. Yup.Bottom line:THEY MAKE UP PRICES ON THE SPOT, EVERY TIME.IF THEY GET CAUGHT, THEY REFUSE TO SERVE YOU. What a business plan.Un-frickin-believable at this place. Just mind-blowing.

We took 2 bottles of 1 liter Palm Spring water instead of fiji, evian and smart water. When the cashier rang it up, it was $9.80.

9,,8/16/2018,0,,"Boston, MA",Nadia S.,0,1.0,1,"I visit this Cafe quite often as I work in the area. Instead of the usual salad with unlimited toppings I decided to go with a beef teriyaki stir fry. I followed the menu noting the additional cost for udon. Only after I finished paying in advance while my food is cooking did the chef note that I owe even more money. I ask politely what was the additional cost and the cashier said the udon was more expensive than what was listed. The chef then contradicts her and says it's because of the additional vegetables added. I proceeded to ask where it was listed the number of vegetables I am allowed to get - because how else would one know it is limited - since it isn't listed on the menu. The chef then informs me that I am somehow miraculously supposed to know this and that I should have asked him if I was unsure. He says the way I should have known it was limited is because it didn't say unlimited toppings. This service provider knew adding more vegetables would increase the cost of my meal yet chose not to let me know as he added to my bowl to cook. To avoid a scene I paid the extra even after paying the first round and expressed how upset to both the chef and the cashier. On top of that they literally poured so much extra teriyaki on the bowl that it is not even edible as it is a teriyaki soup. I would avoid going here unless it is for the salad. If you do venture into the store and get a stir fry make sure you ask because according to the chef you ""should know"". I left frustrated and upset with the poor customer service.",
10,,5/10/2018,0,,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",Gary S.,0,1.0,1,"goZero stars. The Asian man and woman who are manager and cashier are rabid racists. It would be more appetizing to drink raw sewage. I went to pay for a salad with a $50 bill, and the cashier accused me of having a fake bill. To prove a point, since I got the bill when changing my paycheck, I went to Premier Deli. They have a machine there and a pen that they could use to prove that the bill was real. On the other hand, the cashier and manager refused to give me any reason why they thought the bill was fake, and threatened to call the police instead of even giving me the benefit of the doubt by even asking me ""did you know that this bill is fake?"" This is why I am no longer a regular, paying customer.

Updated review",5,,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",Natalie D.,2,2.0,26,"I am saddened to say that i will no longer be a patron of this delicious food variety haven after I've been given attitude twice by two workers there. I understand they are trying to uphold sanitary standards but it would be nice for them to provide sampling cups for those who may be sensitive to ingredients in the food and deserve to sample them to test the tasting waters thereby saving their health and money for themselves and the cafe if the food is to be purchased and wasted due to health concerns. Some places also provide samples to make a cafe a welcoming environment and because people are hungry and want to sample the plethora of goodies before committing to purchase Â any of the delicious foods there. If Zabars can do it, so can you. Lastly, they are not flexible in terms of returning items at a last minute. One worker there gave me an attitude when i returned my salad bar container of food but thankfully the manager handled the Â situation with no issue. Bottom line folks, educate yourself on food sensitivities and offer varieties for those who are sensitive, be more reasonable in terms of sample offerings for hungry food sensitive folks, revamp your customer service and have prices on all your items for purchase and maybe then you'll have my business again and increase your patron count. Good bye from me!! I wanted to like you because of your delicious variety of foods and nice seating area, but I can't because of the issues mentioned. Good bye",

A bottle of coke is 11 dollars, and a small serving of gummy bears is $8. Just let that sink in for a minute. Not only is everything insanely overpriced, but the owner is incredibly rude. On another encounter (stupid me for deciding to give it another chance), my order came out to be $7.99 while there's an $8 card minimum and he refused me service. I have never seen a more disrespectful owner and I will never step foot in Oliviero again, no matter how urgent. Please stay away.",

I was unsure at first how and where to order each item. Ultimately I ordered the as which from the guy right there after he asked to help me and I ordered the juice with the cashier.

The guy behind the counter told me the sandwich price on the board is JUST FOR THE MEAT and I had to pay extra for the bread. What a ridiculous lie!

44,,8/25/2015,0,,"New York, NY",Jay P.,0,1.0,15,This is a nothing special typical overpriced korean ripoff deli. The food is just aight but the price is not just aight due to its touristy location. Moreover this korean old cashier guy is rude and dishonest. I grabbed chicken teriyaki on my way home from work. It clearly says 7.95 on the board but he charged 8.95. It's not that I did not have a dollar but it was just wrong so I told him that I got chicken teriyaki. He started arguing with me that it is bulgogi which was on a different section of the menu board. I pointed it out the right section and it says 7.95 for chicken teriyaki. He looked at the container and said it has rice so it is 8.95. Who sells teriyaki without rice?! A dollar is a dollar but the way they do business and the way they argue with a customer is outright cheating. I live so close to this place but I am not going back. There are so many typical mediocre korean delis around this area anyway. What a shame!,4

Cashier working in the afternoon shift wasn't friendly. I felt like she purposely overcharged us thinking I wouldn't notice. Total came up to $34. On the scale our food came up to $20. $20 jumped to $34? Accounting major and math genius here, no way tax would be that high. My husband questioned her, I was of course right. She overcharged us by at least $10. Decided to sit down and notice their grade sign. Also been in the restaurant industry at least a decade, said ""grade pending"".

Then there is a buffet area you can load up on salads and sides, to be weighed for the price. Then go pay at the register [grabbing packaged treats from their mini grocery store first if you'd like], and try to find a seat, because there's not many, and it's probably packed.

The salads are the same size as everywhere else but they put in twice the amount of chicken as any other place I've been too. Need that protein.I had a buffalo chicken panini once and it was pretty good. The buffet food looks awesome, it looks better then any other place I've been too...But I never get the ""by the pound"" buffet lunches because they end up costing me $15. They have a sweet little pasta corner too where you pick a pasta, meat, and sauce and get a lunch sized portion for like $8 or $9. I never had it, but it's the only Â deli (aside from crappy Europa cafe) that I've seen that always has a line for it.Again, the salads are awesome here. Place is clean, staff is friendly. But they don't have hot sauce by the salad bar =(EDIT::Also has amazing breakfast sandwiches. Every deli pretty much has the same breakfast. But at least Oliviero overstuffs it with eggs, doesn't skimp if you order turkey/ham with it, and have the option of salsa.They now have hot sauce by the salad bar. And I have eaten their buffet and it IS as good as it looks. I had a panini one time too. It was good, but just very small.
