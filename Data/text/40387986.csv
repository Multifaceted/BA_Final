0,Nicole Z.,"McKinney, TX",40,66,525,4.0,11/15/2018,"There was nothing.  Literally-nothing-left on my plate at all. Petit Dover Sole with light, aromatic lemon-butter sauce.  Meaty asparagus with no tough spots.  Sliced focaccia with a salty, soft, ""take another bite!"" feel to it.  I devoured the plate.  The wait for my meal was obnoxiously long but very much worth it.  The butternut squash soup was fine, but pales compared to the lunch.  One neat thing - they had an excellent looking, fresh vegan bar for those who were interested.",2,,2
1,L R.,"Tampa, FL",33,133,157,4.0,11/3/2018,"After learning there was an hour and a half wait at the restaurant next-door, Cafe Fiorello was able to seat us within 10 minutes. We sat outside to take in the hustle and bustle of the city.   There were lights strung overhead giving the place a touch of intimate ambiance with the hum of city buzz. My husband appreciated the calamari since there were more rings than tentacles.  With the three of us he usually ends up eating the mini sea creatures since our son and I only eat the rings. The spaghetti with olive oil and meatballs ordered for my little guy seemed to have dried slightly indicating it may have been under a warming lamp too long.  My husband enjoyed his clam pasta dish stating it was fine.  My chicken piccata was airy and fresh with zest. I was expecting to be presented with a small piece of piccata chicken and half the plate filled with pasta and a cheap vegetable. So I was pleasantly surprised when my plate was filled with a hammered tenderized piece of chicken with the perfect crispy texture, tangy capers, tart artichokes and lemon beurre blanc sauce.  I added plenty more lemon spritz to the dish. It was the best dish of the evening. Our server was a bit abrasive and we wondered if he listened correctly or received our order correctly.  The calamari appetizer took a very long time but our server did in fact handle our orders and the meal was a success. The restrooms are located inside to the right down the narrow hallway. They are acceptable and clean, small, nothing over the top.I noticed the manager was attentive to the entire restaurant indoors and outdoors.This restaurant was much quieter than the one next door. It is always nice to be able to chat over dinner rather than shout. :) Overall we are content with our experience.",1,,
2,Ryan D.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",173,11,0,4.0,11/1/2018,"The food (some sort of pasta -- I don't remember exactly what, but nothing fancy or anything) was very okay, unmemorable. But it's a nice, cozy preshow dinner spot, + I'll be damned if this wasn't some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. + I've had a lot of tiramisu. Fiorello's is grade-A Italiano Autentico. See, it's easy to screw up tiramisu: you need perfectly espresso-soaked lady fingers, the right ratio of mascarpone to ladyfingers to espresso, + that extra zing -- whether it's Kahlúa or chocolate or both -- needs to seal the deal. + if any one of those is off, the whole dish goes down. But Cafe Fiorello does it right. If you're in the Lincoln Center area or are just really craving tiramisu, here's a gem to remember.",1,,1
3,Geoff S.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",0,63,32,5.0,10/12/2018,"Wow. My wife usually won't go to Italian restaurants because she doesn't want to pay restaurant prices ""for spaghetti."" Well, Cafe Fiorello is in a whole different category. This is cuisine. While many menu items are familiar, by name, it's unlikely you've had the food prepared this well at home.My latest trip was for lunch. First, there is a family-style warmth to the welcome you get when you arrive--sorely lacking at most other restaurants. Then, because it was a little breezy/chilly I gave up my usual sidewalk seating and sat at the Antipasto Bar inside. I wasn't in the mood for a salad type of experience but the more I looked over the selections, the more I knew I had to try a bunch (your choice of 3 or 5 selections). Of course, I went with five. Wonderful!",,,1
4,Mona M.,"Seattle, WA",176,222,1267,5.0,9/13/2018,"Food 5/5Drink 3/5Service 3/5The four of us came here for an early dinner. We mainly came for their Truffle Pizza which did not disappoint! We were seated in the compact booth near the back of the restaurant. I do like the interior inside and it has that upscale feeling but the service wasn't the greatest during our visit.. tends to be very slow and confusing. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen most of the time and if we flagged down a different waiter they'd just say ""oh I'm not your waiter"". It was so slow that we watched two different groups sat down next to our table and walked out of the restaurant after waiting too long for someone to come to take their order.For starter we ordered their housemade burrata cheese & prosciutto di parma which was simply out of this world, it was very good. And I'm not ashamed to admit that I took the last piece of the prosciutto without offering my friends first and I have no regret about it haha! We also ordered branzino al forno (butterflied) that was served with charred peppers, onions, lemon but the fish was on the dry side and still tasted ""fishy"" inside. This one was probably the least favorite at our table.The four of us shared TWO pans of the Fresh Black Truffle pizza with eggs add-on that makes it even better. This pizza was very good. All of us were eyeing the last piece. We also ordered the spaghetti carbonara which was excellent with the guanciale bacon and egg.For drinks, our friends ordered both the red and white wine, while we got the cocktails which were just okay but came in great presentation as expected. I got the Venetian Spritz because I was sold by the ""passionfruit"" ingredient in it (my go-to ingredient in drinks).. the drink did not taste bad but not that great either, would have preferred the passionfruit to be stronger. My guy tried one of the mojito which also left a lot to be desired. Price is just a bit little on the higher side. Our bill rounded up to about $250 total. Overall, drinks were not bad, service could be better, and food was outstanding. Would I be back? That's a hell yes.",43,25,42
5,Susan M.,"Narragansett, RI",74,243,306,4.0,9/27/2018,"Fantastic. Delicious. Very busy. Made Reservation on Open Table last night. With over 6 thousand reviews and close to 5 star rating this was a must try. The staff was very friendly, professional, and accommodating (we asked for a booth instead of a table- no problem). The servers were attentive and quick, as was the waiter. I ordered the Spicy margarita and it was amazing. The served focaccia bread and provide olive oil on table. Salty but very good. We started with the caprese salad which was delicious! Perfectly ripened tomatoes  and creamy fresh Mozzarella cheese! The veal Milanese....(drum roll)  ... the best I've ever had! Thin, crisp, large portion of veal topped with fresh greens that were lightly dressed with a lemony taste. I cannot wait to go back for it. The optional additional spaghetti pomadoro was the perfect accompaniment for veal. Note: one review said that the portions were large and that splitting is a good option. We intended to split and the waiter talked us out of it. There are 2 prices on the menu; one is the portion I described and photographed, and the higher priced option is a ""bone-in version"" which the waiter said was slightly larger. We code the smaller portion which was HUGE. We each only ate half of our meals and were staying at hotel, so as much as we would have enjoyed the leftovers, we couldn't take them. We were completely full after bread, appetizer, and eating only half. We WILL share next time. I am excited to return   Prices are high - $31 for veal Milanese plus $7  for pasta and $17 for a glass of wine. It's New York! We sat indoors, but there is a outdoor seating available (weather permitting) and a lively area surrounding the bar. It's a little noisy and the salt pepper and oil were a little grimy to touch. For that -.5 star for cleanliness/upkeep and -.5 for atmosphere. I recommend Cafe Fiorello and will def be back.",,,
6,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,5.0,9/30/2018,Fantastic post or pre show option by the Lincoln center. The food is excellent but the service is the best. The pizzas and pastas are fantastic. Definitely recommend the Tagietelle with the beef ragu - tender pasta with a savory and meaty ragu. The margherita pizza is also a tried and true classic with a thin chewy brick oven baked crust. The antipasto bar is the hallmark with the option to pick 3 for 19 or 5 for 25. The octopus ceviche isn't listed as an option but it is so be sure to get that!Our server was fantastic.  Attentive and very energetic - he even gave me an extra pack of bread to take home since I loved the seasoned focaccia so much. Definitely the best service I have had in the city.,2,2,3

9,Tyler L.,"New York, NY",357,922,1278,3.0,8/21/2018,"This is a fairly popular Italian restaurant near Lincoln Center. Due to its location, it is a bit pricier than others. Expect to pay around $20-$30 for most entrees. I had their veal parmigiana and their famous lasagna. Portion sizes were big and I was definitely stuffed at the end of my meal. However, I have had better Italian food though.The veal parmigiana was the better of the two entrees. It was very saucy, cheesy, and the meat was perfectly moist. However, it was way too salty. The lasagna was also too salty as well as being insanely greasy. It was not normal lasagna either. Theirs is shaped like a flat, personal pan pizza and they basically baked several pasta squares together and poured sauce and cheese over the middle of it. It was not the thick multi-layered lasagna like usual. The squares of pasta were hard and chewy too - not soft and moist like lasagna is supposed to be. It seemed like the pasta in it was under cooked. I definitely would not recommend that dish.",,,
10,Priya G.,"Richardson, TX",165,28,18,5.0,7/29/2018,"Had a wonderful time here! A bit pricey, but worth it! I'm vegetarian and came with a group of three; had the black truffle pizza (six pieces), burrata, a bottle of sauvignon and chocolate mousse (came out to 113 without tip). Had to wait approximately 15 min to be seated at 7 pm on a Sunday in the summer.Food was great, wine recs by our waitress was perfect, service was pretty good (our poor waitress was clearly overwhelmed and killed it nonetheless) and we ate outdoors - it was lovely (summertime).

Cheesecake Factory would never be lived down.  You're the new century gangsta--your fortunes were made clearly legally, within the confines of all legal rules, yet you would like to think you took part in making those rules.  But those younger days, when you were nothing.  Nothing.  .....Cheesecake Factory was damn good wasn't it?Cafe Fiorello.  The Cheesecake Factory of the modern gangsta.~~~We sat there, sizing each other up.  Half a century ago our families found common roots, but what a long time ago that was.  Today middle-class never felt so bottom.A couple years ago we found ourselves under the watchful eye of 2 snipers and dozens of plain-clothed killers atop an Yosemite hill, happy as hell to finally stand in the glory of then-President Obama.  Yet I did not dare utter anything of that day this night for our friends, sitting across from the table dining with a sharp fork and a very sharp knife, are personal friends of The Trump (or at least within the narrow definition of ""friend"" that you would expect any associate of Donald to have.)My Manhattan was absolutely delicious (and really,... really.  What do you expect of any true gangasta playplace?), and amazingly Calamari, the ubiquitous American Italian appetizer, was somehow greater than almost any other.  Artichokes were also stellar--they were so thoughtful to even remove all inedible, fibrous material so you don't get that trigger finger slippery... you know, cause sometimes that matters...But when I saw my Veal Pepperoni Parmigiana arrive, basically a frickin' pizza made with a chop of veal instead dough, I was instantly reminded that I was not here just to eat.  Legit Italian restaurants don't serve veal topped with pizza, and with a price tag suitable for suited men.  No, as I sipped my 2nd Manhattan generously forced upon me by now the obvious host, I played a dangerous card...""What do you think of Trump?""The Lady's eyes opened wide, and she sat straighter than what was already an impossibly straight stance.  Her head cocked 20deg clock-wise towards me until our eyes met.""I do not believe he is as everyone believes,"" confidence bellowing along with the words.  ""He is generous, kind, and I do not believe he is racist at all.  I am after all Taiwanese, not white.  He has even consulted my husband [the equally confident man sitting by her side] about the Taiwan / China relationship [so that he may make proper decisions during that controversial time.]""We went on, and I was happy to see that my head still stood upon my neck and all knives were only stained with the juiices of our cooked meat.I nodded repeatedly that night as I was sure any further words would not be worth the gamble.  And nearing the inevitable, the table cleared, end the waiter walks to my side...Plop.  Two clumps were thrown onto my plate like the mashed potatoes of my elementary school years: one white, one brown from a metal bucket.  And then they were gone.  The ""Bucket of Chocolate Mousse"" as literally described was served.It was time to finish, as the circumstances firmly suggested.Remember, your life is a privilege, not a right, as your life is but a page in another's.4/5#newyork #italian #star",76,56,61
12,Ashlee S.,"Brooklyn, NY",773,371,28,3.0,6/22/2018,"Pretty decent food but overpriced. I understand it's New York and a more expensive area but the beverages and food here are overpriced especially in terms of quality. I got the salmon burger and while flavorful, it wasn't cooked well this fell apart leaving me to eat it all by fork. The bread was also extremely soggy. My negroni was good but I've had better for $16.  My friend got the calamari and he liked it well enough as it did my dad with his burger.",4,,2
13,Hannah E.,"Long Beach, CA",1394,1376,51,2.0,6/16/2018,"If you're an Italian place and you cook the pasta in your linguine with clams so long that it falls apart in the barely-there watery clam sauce, you kind of fail at being an Italian place. Sorry. That's beyond 'not al dente' and all the way to 'I'm 12 and I just learned to cook pasta in my kitchen'.I'll give them their pleasingly oily roasted cauliflower, and I also admit I was the only one at the table not to love their fried artichokes. Actually, the cold bar stuff was generally fine. And I LOVED their focaccia bread.If you like desserts the size of your head, this is also a good place to sate your craving.",2,2,3

17,Steve K.,"Linwood, NJ",23,244,230,4.0,12/29/2017,"We had a great dining experience at CF. The prices here are a ittle steep but makes sense considering the location of this restaurant. The beautiful preparation at the bar of antipasti made you want to sample them all. The assorted vegetable dishes were offered in three and five samplings for $19.00 and $25.00 respectively and were all delicious, but the star of our dining experience was the Italian wedding soup $13.00. This exquisite soup loaded with vegetables and the most delicious little meatballs was the best that I have ever eaten!Margherita pizza and a side appetizer of short rib meatballs were also good. The pizza crust was thin, almost waferlike, and the meatballs although tasty I found them to be slightly lacking in flavor compared to the ones in the wedding soup.We were happily surprised with Cafe Fiorello after going to another   originally planned venue which would have had us waiting for at least an hour. A lot of times the best laid plans because of time constraints have you make  a detour, having a four year old in tow was one of these situations.Th only thing that prevented the additional star was that since the place was so crowded we had to sit at the bar close to the entrance where it was a litle cool from the door openings, and being jostled by other patrons passing between the entrance, the cashier and the main dining area.",1,,
18,Major L.,"Washington, DC",19,37,163,4.0,1/6/2018,"Harsh winter and cold wind brought us to this cute Italian restaurant near Lincoln Center. The center salad bar kitchen provides customers visual satisfaction and food aroma filling the restaurant. This restaurant is pretty packed during dinner time, so I recommend making a reservation beforehand. The service is good, but it might get a little bit slow (hard to find our waiter) during rush hours. However, I am impressed with the speed of they serving foods. They managed to complete an order of two entries within 15 mins during the rush hours dinner time. We ordered seafood risotto ($29) and salmon ($27).For the seafood risotto, I enjoyed the scallops, shrimp, and squid, which were full of the plate. They were very generous in giving me several whole scallops. The taste of the chess and seafood was very mellow and smooth, which the cheese doesn't cover the taste of sweetness from seafood (...some cheesy dishes can being filling and plain after the second bite, only cheesy taste). Highly recommended to seafood lovers. For the salmon, it's very well cooked and seasoning. The salmon was fresh not frozen because there wasn't any fishy smell. There wasn't over exaggerated decoration or seasoning so that you can taste the natural flavor of the salmon. Also recommended to people who like a fish filet. Overall, I would recommend to people who enjoy Italian foods and also a good place to hang out with friends and family.",,2,

The last time I went, I got the octopus as well. It wasn't my favorite as it was cooked too much. Their pizzas are good but the pastas not so much. Their appetizers are very average. I have gotten their cheese cake for desserts several times. It is not the greatest cheese cake but the portion is huge and great to share with the table.

By this time my son and wife left the hotel. When I called back, Sandy was not so sorry. She said she would have the cutlery delivered right away. After 15 minutes, I told her to just bring me a new lasagna, because no one should have to eat $30 cold lasagna. I also told her my room number and have it delivered directly to my room since I was in bed. About 15 mins later I get a call from the front desk, my food has arrived. Oh man!

But this place boasts some of the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. I know that's a heavy promise to uphold. I also know that I rarely ever order anything sweet like french toast or pancakes for breakfast when things like eggs benedict (which I still ordered anyway), omelettes and burgers exist. But holy smokes. I was torn between cannoli and hazelnut. I'm sure you can't go wrong either way but we finally decided on hazelnut - the butter oozes into the maple syrup and the nutella hazelnut spread into this well of the fountain of fatass youth upon a glorious mountain of fluffy huge cakes. Whole hazelnuts adorn the dish. I was so impressed. Even though I was completely full and split this with someone, I kept diving in for more wishing it would never go away and that it could actually physically hug me. We also ordered both the smoked salmon and the bella (prosciutto cotto ham, burrata mozzarella) benedicts. Both were great. The salmon was super fresh and the ham was very fancy. The hollandaise sauce was above average and had a zesty lemon taste as a well prepared version should. This was a very sober meal accompanied with coffee so I can't speak for their drinks other than the coffee was just fine. The service was served with a smile and pretty good. The views of Lincoln Center in the background and the amount of people watching from the curb on a brisk spring morning were excellent. I also hear they serve an entire lobster on a pizza for people wondering about their dinner here. Such decadence. I think I overlooked this place before when passing in thinking it was a place for tourists to leap inside from their nearby hotels. But hell no. The food was great.",3,2,3

To the defense of the Cafe Fiorello, it looked like everyone else was receiving great service. There was a female server that was picking up the weight of our server and I hope she gets more money to take home. Our server (Giorgio) had to be asked numerous times for water. It took forever to get him to take our order. He was off to the side texting for a good five minutes while we were ready to order. He climbed over the little wall to get to us. (Bizarre) He had no clue what was in the dishes and when I asked about the salmon he read the description off the menu. (We could have done that) When we asked for the check. . . He disappeared for a good ten minutes.  We were hoping for something sweet after dinner but our plates sat empty on our table for 17 minutes so we ran out of time. We thought we were then going to try and run by a Frozen Yogurt place for something sweet but he took so long we had to chance that too. I'm sad that the experience was so crappy.

Updated review","I agree with some of the other users who mention how this restaurant has lost something over the years. I have been dining in this restaurant for about 10 years now.  I used to really enjoy it.  My favorite dish was the Pear and Arugula salad.  The lamb shank osso buco with homemade pappardelle was fantastic as well. Either this restaurant has changed it owners/chef or it is going through a serious identity crisis. My last 3 visits have resulted in practically 3 different menus.  Some of the items have remained but many of them have changed. I was very disappointed to find out tonight that the pear and arugula salad has been changed to a beet and arugula salad (which I tried but was disappointed).  When I asked the server why; the only response that I received was that the pear salad was a customer favorite.  If this was the case I do not understand why it was removed from the menu. I understand that restaurants need to adapt in order to stay contemporary.  However, I would caution this restaurant to not overthink their menu.  If something is good (and popular) then keep it on the menu. P.S. - My risotto was gummy but everyone is entitled to an off night every now and then.",,1,

They have 2 waiters running 15 tables and they cant even handle two at same time they seem overwhelmed and rushed ... after going there for all these years I am finally giving up every last hope I had for this place.

The service was impeccable, if  not maybe a tad overbearing, but is that really a bad thing? The food came out extremely quickly - here I was thinking that the meal would last forever! The chicken Parmesan was fresh tasting, with lots of cheese. A very generous portion; I took the rest of mine to go. The decor intrigued me. It's a mix of standard Italian American, with dark red leather booths and little lamps on each table. The artwork however was modern, as were the lanterns around the ceiling lights. I appreciated the contrast and that they were merging styles. It works.Definitely order the bucket of mouse. They literally bring a bucket of whipped creme and a bucket of mousse and give you generous helpings on a plate that looks like it wouldn't have been out of place in your tacky Brooklyn grandmothers kitchen circa 1970. Was very simple and delicious.Finished out the evening with the maitre d' coming around offering free fresh baked cookies from a pan. Would definitely return if I was seeing a show.PS did I mention the bathroom had a legit mouthwash dispenser and paper cups?! I've been in many a high end restroom, and never seen this contraption.

59,Ada L.,"Somerville, MA",1,55,0,2.0,2/21/2018,"I came here for a pre-opera dinner and picked it because it's directly across from Lincoln Center, has a good reputation, and serves a good range of options at the uncomfortably early hour of 4 PM. Maybe I came on an off-day? I fail to understand the hype. First of all, the drinks are outrageously overpriced for mundane beverages. $16 for a plain gin and tonic? Really? I wanted an Aperol spritz, which would have set me back $17, but mysteriously for an Italian restaurant, they were out of Aperol. The main dish I ordered, chicken & black truffle fettucini, was a huge let down. It didn't taste like truffle at all, which is the only reason I wanted it in the first place. In fact, it was largely flavorless. Just a few sad shreds of chicken breast. I barely made a dent in it. I considered sending it back, but I had to leave for the show. The waitress didn't seem to think it was strange that there was so much left on my plate.The caprese salad and chocolate mousse that bookended our meal were fine, but, I mean, those are really hard things to mess up. If the meal is good, I couldn't care less what it costs. But I really didn't feel like I got what I paid for here, and regret that I wasted $80 something bucks on a meal that I didn't enjoy.

Which brings me to Cafe Fiorello.It was Saturday night and we decided to wing it.  After all -- not everything in life is better scripted.   Sure -- the City was packed -- as were all the usual local haunts, including this one.  But the maitre d and an engaged fellow behind their cool food bar put two flutes of Prosecco in our hands while we waited for seating at the bar.  A few moments later,  with a wink and a nod, our flutes were refilled and we were seated at the food bar and yapping away with a Latvian/Chilean couple (by way of Venezuela) sitting next to us -- getting pleasantly buzzed on the wine and the atmosphere. The servers made sure we were fed in time to make our show and the meal was better than expected.Serendipity works.The lobster agnolotti was terrific -- nice pasta with plump chunks of lobster -- dressed in a  lemony beurre blanc.  I would eat this again.  The tortelloni bolognese was less to my liking -- under seasoned and under cooked -- but I quibble.  Considering the service we received, under less than optimum conditions, everything probably tasted better than it was had we spent 90 minutes picking at it.  Even the bread basket -- with seasoned focaccia and flat bread -- tasted exotic. Yes, the tariff was steep for pasta ($40 per with tip) -- but expectedly so and worth it for the convenience of a two block walk to the theater.It was nice, and because it was nice, I would try it again -- maybe next time, with reservations, and a deeper look at their menu.",10,4,6

After years of consistent 4+ star experiences as a Lincoln Center standby, the most recent visit was 2 stars at best and knocks it down to three stars overall. I hope that the recent experience was an aberration, but, unfortunately, it had the markings of a once-proud institution in decline. First, the service fell below prior standards. While our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive when she was at the table, the system of rotating the main waitress with other servers seemed to break down and leave longer-than-acceptable intervals before drinks were served, water was refilled, and plates were cleared. Second, there were signs that the restaurant is trying too hard to nickel and dime its patrons. The delicious flat bread that used to come to each table for free is now available for $4, with less bread and less deliciousness. The slightly less expensive ""after 9pm"" section of the menu is enforced with military strictness -- don't even think about ordering at 8:15! Third, and most importantly, the overall food quality was down. The salmon was particularly mediocre -- overcooked and tasteless. I am still giving Fiorello's three stars out of respect to its past excellence, and I hope those leaving 4+ star reviews are more representative of today's version of the restaurant.

Even if they are a little slow, you can run across Broadway and make the curtain. BTW the Met sells ""turn-back"" tickets, so it's often in the 1st 15 rows.

This dish has been one of the most unique ones I've had - its not your standard lasagna. The sauce, meatballs, and pasta all just mush up and blend in your mouth.

We told the waiters about our time crunch and they weaved us in to a table. We weren't that hungry to start so we only had appetizers. I ordered the vegetable soup and he ordered the prosciutto plate. Our meal came quickly with a complimentary basket of hearty bread. My soup was delicious and hearty. It's more like a vegetable stew with a mashed potato sort of consistency. My boyfriend was extremely pleased with his plate.

The vegetable carbonara was very fresh and very tasty- It had broccolini, asparagus, lima beans, garlic mushrooms, burrata cheese and a perfectly poached egg. The cauliflower milanese and zucchini parm were also excellent! The server was very attentive and made sure we would be out in time for the show. Not to mention the waitress going around with FREE freshly baked chocolate chip cookies- still piping hot on the cookie tray. The only reason this spot gets 4 instead of 5 stars is it's a cramped space. Very tight quarters. Otherwise, perfect spot to grab some delicious (vegetarian) food across the street from Lincoln Center. I'd definitely come back even if I wasn't attending a show.",1,,
88,Samad J.,"New York, NY",1,14,5,1.0,8/14/2017,"Despite the subpar and inattentive service, my wife and I regularly bring friends and family from out of town here for the fun outdoor atmosphere and the delicious bottomless chocolate mousse. Not tonight though...As usual, there's no clear hostess or organization, so we wandered inside where someone directed us back outside to wait on someone else for a table assignment despite a minimal weeknight crowd.  Worth it for the table side mousse, we thought...Like always, one waiter brought us water and bread and another took the bread right back when we said we're here for dessert. Lol, whatever. Another waiter arrived without menus so we ordered the mousse for the table to get the ball rolling. Half an hour later a tiny plate is brought out and a minuscule scoop is dolloped onto it from the massive bucket. Within seconds, the four of us devour it. Expecting a waiter with the bucket to quickly return for a refill as has occurred every other time we've visited, another thirty minutes go by. We think a small first portion is okay if they'll be refilling it regularly. Finally we flag down a waiter who ends up taking our plate instead of bringing the bucket back to the table. We motion to yet another waiter to bring the refill. Eventually another mostly empty plate makes its way to the table, this time without the table side bucket service. One more time we gobble up what we were served. Repeat. I call over the general manager to figure out why tonight is so bad. He says each refill is an order of the dessert, and it's never been bottomless! (It's one thing if the policy has changed, but I've had bottomless chocolate mousse here more than once! Why would I make this up?!) I ask for the dessert menu and the check which shows multiple orders of the mousse, neither of which was close to the ""bucket"" size described on the menu. Total waste of money. Terrible management. Disorganized, disinterested, and slow staff. I won't be back.",5,1,

Not only were we able to sit at the bar and see all of the yummy foods prepared to serve by the most gracious bartenders ever, but we were able to roll ourselves out after to catch a cab. The olives soaked in the freshest virgin olive oil and lemon were a perfect pairing for the Gavi and the provolone potatoes, roasted mushrooms, and the cauliflower were the best thing I've eaten all week. The lemoncello  (too drunk to spell that right) was a perfect finish with the chocolate mousse and fresh whipped cream. Wow... yes.",,2,

91,Jennie L.,"Austin, TX",6,11,1,4.0,11/23/2017,"The carbonara was really good and the guanciale was cooked perfectly, but had a slightly weird after taste. The Thanksgiving special was exceptional. The pumpkin pie had a very good caramel beneath. The salmon benedict was alright. The fettuccine  bolognese was good as well. The staff were very friendly. It's conveniently located and the menu is varied. The artichokes (carciofi alla giudeia) on the Thanksgiving menu were amazing, and I would strongly recommend them.  Service was spotty, but our waitress was receptive once we asked her for things.",,,

I came here in November 2015 after spending the day at an event in the Hearst Tower, and I was SO hungry that I had a headache. I was dressed up and told the waitress I was hungry, and she seemed very empathetic. Before I knew it, my food was ready (and very fresh) and I was thrilled. I asked her why it was so quick and she said that she told the chefs to prioritize my order since she could tell I needed to eat - talk about going above and beyond. Overall, I'd definitely recommend. Food is delicious (including the specialty bread basket they bring you while you wait) and staff is a joy.",,1,

When I dine here, I prefer to sit in the bar area because it's not as formal. There is also much more light during the day in the bar section. The bar has a small section of anti past daily. I love when there are grilled vegetables but there's a heavy hand of oil and seasonings for my liking. One of my favorite things here are the thin crust pizzas. Give the meatball pizza a try! They are very thin and crispy - SO good. They can become a bit pricey. The food is good - well made Italian food. The portions are decent sized - not too big, not too small. I personally feel the menu never gets switched up. I have food allergies and I find it hard to stick to the menu, most of the time, when I come here time to time with family or friends.",,,1

Beautiful big desserts and a spiked coffee are the highlights of my dinners here. While the waiters are usually talented individuals who are opera singers themselves, the clean up crew is quite annoying. They hover around the tables like vultures around a carcass. They need to take a chill pill. Management is very pleasant and often gives out free treats to the customers. My only complaint is the bathrooms are a tad small.

My husband had the Pesto Ravioli and I honestly think his dish out beat mine! It was very savory and filling (so he said). We couldn't get a seat outside (when the weather was nicer, of course!) but the indoor seating we just as nice and comfortable ...with people watching restricted to people walking by and those coming and going from neighboring tables.

In the end, I left the meal satisfied. Calimari was bland and uninspired, but tordelli was transcendent, if disappointing on the P2P (price to portions) front. My friend's ultra-thin pizza was delicious, however, as was the  chocolate mousse we shared at the end. They bring the stuff in these huge buckets and just pile it on plates for you. Atmosphere and 'crowd energy' are definitely a plus. Service polite but flirting with the intrusive, unless being asked how you're doing 4 times is your kind of thing.

Updated review","I hosted a large party of about 25 adults and several children in Cafe Fiorello's private space for Thanksgiving dinner.  The process leading up was seamless.  Communication was great and management was amenable to our needs.  We pre-selected wines and arrived early on Thanksgiving to set up.  Service was stellar.  We were served by Oscar, Fabrice and Alook.  All three were excellent and took great care of us.  They were patient with our large group and with our boisterous children.  The food was excellent.There was a mistake on the bill that went unnoticed for several days after the event.  When I contacted the banquet sales department about this situation she rectified it to my satisfaction in less than an hour.  I would not hesitate to host another large event here!",2,1,

And it arrived a good 15 minutes before our friend's vegetable plate.  Why not spend that 15 minutes heating up the pizza?I certainly don't intend to make this definitive; I'll go back, hoping that last night was an anomaly.

The service was excellent and seemed to be well coordinated from the host, servers, waiters, and even the coat check. I was dining here during the holiday season so of course it was packed even around 4:30 pm. They were ready for the rush and well staffed.I ordered the veal scallopini marsala which was excellent. The dish came with 3 pieces of veal which was plenty. My girlfriend ordered the eggplant which she enjoyed as well and found it to be not too heavy. We went with a side of spinach which was sautéed nicely in garlic. The best part was the tartufo ice cream dessert. The dish featured a shaved dark chocolate layer covering the chocolate and vanilla ice cream. This variation of dark chocolate shavings made it pair well with the ice cream and whipped cream.The restaurant tended to get a little loud due to the holiday rush and since it was close to show time at Lincoln Center. I would definitely visit Cafe Fiorello again.",1,,1

Coffee and tea was brought to the table well before the meal causing it to be cold when needed and we had to ask for the milk twice. Our utensils were removed at the end of the appetizer but we had to sit and wait until we found our waiter to get utensils to eat our main course.  People around us who sat down after us had their main course (in one case the same as our order) well before ours arrived. One main course arrived (the vegetable anti-pasti )  sloppy on the plate and luke warm.

I don't think the flavors are out of this world, but it isn't bad either. I'm kind of indifferent.Things to know:1) Portions are extremely huge and if you share a plate there is a surcharge2) 35 min per a person3) lasagna is an open face baked version (very popular)4) order any of the seafood meals but I suggest going with anything that is serves table side like the seafood risottoThis is a restaurant staple in the area, but there are def better restaurants.",4,,2

Updated review","I finally made a return visit after so many years. Unfortunately, this visit was less than stellar.After we were seated, the evening started with dirty silverware. Two of the forks and one of the knives at the table had visible specs of food or smudges on them. I asked for replacements which were promptly given.The bread was tasty as before! They happily gave us another refill and we basically filled up on that for the hour.I once again ordered the lasagna, which I have two previous times. Sadly, what they brought out was distant memory of what I remember. Half the dish was a soggy mess, the flavor was not up to what I remember, the ricotta vs mozzarella ratio was worse than before, and it came out luke warm instead of hot!The service was good but not great but I'll blame us since we were waiting on two other people for about 20 minutes. I can't really knock them for that but it took him a long time to actually get out real order after they arrived.Sadly, I'm not sure I'll ever make another visit. At least, I'm not as eager as I once was. Disappointing but at least the bread was excellent.",,,

It was a really busy lunchtime rush but our waiter didn't exactly seem eager to do his job. He seemed to run away whenever we had a question. I'd gladly go again but I don't want him to wait on us. We ordered 5 vegetable options of the antipasto and each seemed better than the last. We ordered mushrooms, broccolini, asparagus, the squash tart and cauliflower steak. They were all fabulous and I'd return just for those.We also ordered an Italian Wedding soup and the Pesto Broccolini pizza. I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza and this was easily one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The crust was so thin and so crunchy. The pesto was perfect and the broccolini gave a nice crunch. We ordered a large pizza but it felt light, not heavy like other pizzas. We could've eaten the whole thing! I look forward to coming back and trying more items!",,,
132,Pia A.,"Marina del Rey, CA",80,122,289,3.0,7/2/2016,"Went here for lunch. Ordered their short rib pizza and the basil pesto ravioli. The pizza was alright. It had four meatballs and some short ribs on top of each cut. The ravioli was blah. I was looking for a nice flow of flavor and it didn't have it. I thought it was saltier more than anything.

I had to hold up my arm for water, ice, grated cheese, a spoon and THEN whenthe rude waiter tossed the check at my table, the pen went flying and he was gone,gone, gone.  I had to search my purse for a pen or I'd still be sitting there.Also could not find a host at the front desk to complain - where were they all?SO DISAPPOINTING, as a friend and I had dinner and drinks there several nightsbefore and Ray, the lovely and happy waiter, was wonderful and the food was good.That's the only reason I went back for lunch but I won't be going there again!Too many restaurants along B'way and Columbus to be treated rudely and to havebadly made food.  Did someone drop a salt shaker in the pasta sauce while it wasburning????

135,Amanda M.,"Zürich, Switzerland",1087,845,4910,4.0,12/10/2013,"This is the one place on my trip to NY that I'm quite torn over. I really REALLY want to come back for a lunch or dinner here, because the options look really incredible. My boyfriend and I visited here for their brunch. We somehow beat the church crowd and arrived Sunday morning to a somewhat empty restaurant. The place definitely reminds me of a hoity toity fancy schmancy place where rich people bring their children after church. That sounds weird, and nothings wrong with that, but it's the impression I got. And that's cool, man. The prices suck. I'll just go right out and say that the pries are really freaking high. But I want to come back. Those pictures of their lobster pizza and home-made lasagna make me drool and I want to try a piece of those babies even if they cost a lot. Was their brunch good? yeah. Yeah it was pretty stinkin good. They charge an arm and a leg for a Sicilian Breakfast- hummus, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, olives, and focaccia (psh, those jerks don't even post the prices on their website because they know it'll scare the customers away! hah! I think it was something like $16. bastards.) sorry for calling them jerks and bastards. I take it back... back to the Sicilian Breakfast. It was good. The eggs were normal. But that hummus was the best hummus I've ever eaten- really. It had these amazing huge chunks of olives with some juicy tomato cubes and the focaccia, damnit, was a really good focaccia. Ah, they even offer free mimosas. I almost forgot about that. Double points.  The eggs Benedict with prosciutto was also quite good, but nothing that I would feel the need to try again. Honestly though, despite the high prices (can you tell I'm struggling?), the service was pretty good, even when things got a little cray, and if I do come back to NY for a longer time, I'd really want to give this place a shot for their antipasti bar, lobster pizza, home-made lasagna, and seafood risotto. Boom, I got my next visit covered!",1,2,1

Updated review","When I boast and brag about a place, I never expect to be completely humiliated, and that is what happened here yesterday. First, let me say that the hosts outside were fantastic. Very polite, very warm and welcoming. The food still remains incredible. I had the Lobster and Shrimp pappardelle ($38) and once you see the actual dish you don't mind the price at all. We also ordered the spaghetti carbonara ($25) which was superb. But the service? What happened here? Our server never checked on us and forget my second prosecco. The service was just really bad. If the price of my dish were $25 instead of $38, I would come back for it because the value would be enough to disregard terrible service. shame. I spoke so well about this place, Anyway, like I said before: the food remains incredibly good, so come here if you want great italian food and don't care too much about service. Hopefully you will have a much better experience.",5,,

Updated review","I picked up pizza ToGo Monday night right before closing. I sat down at the bar to wait for the pizza to finish and the name plates on the bar ripped my formal gown as I sat down (I had just come from a gala). I had just purchased this gown and when I said something to manager and started crying he essentially just walked away and didn't even apologize. Although your food is good, I believe customer service is just as important and the fact that you ruined my dress and it made me cry and the manager didn't even say sorry or offer water and just walked away ruins the restaurant for me. Ironically, your wait staff was nicer than your manager. We had planned on coming back to your restaurant but we will not anymore. Update: I went in again tonight because my boss wanted Italian food and I told the manager on duty, Amine, about my experience the night before and he apologized over and over for their sign ruining my brand new goen and apologized for there staff member the night before not having any concern for what had occurred. I really appreciated the apology from Amine. Thank you.",1,1,
140,Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",214,279,121,3.0,4/12/2015,"Last night was NOT a good night to come here. They had NOTHING. How can that be right?There was no fish, no asparagus, no lobster, no tiramisu cake, no eggplant...it was ridiculous. I do not know why they did not close for the night if they ran out of half of the menu. If you see the menu, it is not huge. There are very limited things to pick from, imagine with half of it missing. FOOD:I ordered the meat ravioli, it wasn't bad but it was not amazing. The shells were very tough, the should have cooked it more. The meat was not bad, not too flavorful but the sauce was good. My uncle ordered veal w asparagus since they had no fish or lobster and thats what he wanted; he said it was good. SERVICEBarely came around and took a while to get my drink. He stated he didnt hear me although he repeated it back. He wasn't horrible but I was not impressed.PRICE:Pretty expensive. Especially for the portions, our bill was over 100. I won't go back.",4,2,

The location is perfect service is great and food is always very good! Last nite we had the short rib meatball appetizer. They were tender flavorful and the sauce was delicious! We went during the January 4th blizzard and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Looking for comfort food I had the margharita pizza and it def served its purpose. Full of flavor with a light crust it def hit the spot. My husband had the spaghetti w short rib meatballs and was not disappointed. Portion was just right. My daughter had the prosciutto and arugula pizza and found it to be perfect! We ended the nite with the lemon pie and it was an unexpected delight!! Carmelized top and crust and creamy lemon filling. Will be craving this for a long time! My only disappointment was the very small wine pour . My daughter and I each had the house Chardonnay and I doubt it was even 4 ounces at $17 a glass. I would def recommend for the location food and service but would be wary of my drink choice,,,

147,Efren O.,"Manhattan, NY",4,10,0,2.0,8/3/2017,"While I have been a fan of this restaurant for years,  I was incredibly surprised and annoyed tonight while dining there.  There was a table with several toddlers who were possible the loudest screaming toddlers I have ever encountered inside a restaurant. They were not just a little loud. They were screaming at the top of their lungs for at least 10-15 minutes. It was clear that the parents thought nothing of it and that it was ok for the entire restaurant to have to listen to this. This was surprising given that they were right by the door and the weather is nice outside. Management did absolutely nothing and it was obvious to all of us.  Our conversation at the bar was seriously disrupted and we were disappointed with the situation. Honestly,  is an entire restaurant supposed to just sit and bare this? Highly disappointed with management and will not be coming here for a while",1,2,

Make sure to make a reservation because this place is packed. On a weekday around 7pm there was a 30 minute wait. Still, the host was very nice and accommodating and offered my party some complimentary prosecco while we waited. The pizza and pasta are both very good here. I particularly like the pesto ravioli, which came highly recommended by the waiter. The tordelli bolognese and lasagna (a house specialty) are also delicious and were recommended by the staff. My friend also loved her veal osso buco. We also got fried calamari which was just ok. The prosciutto di parma & arugula is a favorite pizza of mine, though really you could stick prosciutto on anything and I'd love it. One issue - certain tables are in less than ideal locations, so people kept banging into me all night. That discomfort definitely helped knock this review from 4 to 3 stars.

This is what I've experieced: Great location across the street from Lincoln Center. Menu is decent and does not seem to change much over time, which in my view, is a negative when you just have an ok menu. Their appetizer bar is their strength; you can combine different very tasty vegetable dishes at will while seeing the selection, and being able to chat with the bar waiter, ask questions, etc. Staff at the bar is fine but service in general is the weakest I've seen. From forgetting things, to forgetting about you, to bringing you the wrong dish. Turnover seems to be high and the quality of their waiters/waitresses is all over the place, from very bad to very good. Seems to be a consistent theme, waiting staff is not professionally trained, does not have the right attitudes, with exceptions (as usual). Take away the location and the appetizer bar and they would have gone out of business a long time ago. Lunch time seems to be the weakest time. Nightime staff is better. Pricing is reasonable for NYC. I wish they learned how to train their staff like Bistro Boreal in Quebec City.

A bus-boy soon arrived to ask if we preferred still or sparkling ($7.95 for sparkling we later discovered ). Perusing the brunch menu before our waiter arrived neither of us could find anything particularly appealing or novel for our tastes.  Michael, our waiter helpfully answered our questions  concerning the menu items and took our  beverage orders. During our visit we found him to be professional, efficient, and open to a little friendly banter. Not finding anything particularly exciting on the menu, we ordered the scrambled eggs with maple cured bacon, and their take on eggs Benedict; Bella Benedict.  Both of these choices were accompanied by a small, tasty house salad and potato's that had a texture suggesting that they had been sitting around under a heat lamp too long. Both of these items were good, but not noteworthy.

Updated review",We got the spaghetti carbonara and the margarita pizza. The pizza was great as it has bits of burrata on top as well as tomatoes. Very tasty!! The spaghetti carbonara was good with the poached egg on top. I wasn't a fan of the type of bacon that came with it though as it was mostly chunks of fat. Would love to go back and try other things. It was nice that we got a basket of muffins and pastries with the meal that we were able to take home! My mom and I were bummed that our iced coffees were so small.

Second, the menu said the pastas could be prepared gluten free upon request, but we later learned that ONLY the spaghetti could be. If this is the case, don't make a point of writing on the menu that they can be prepared gluten free- that's misleading. We made our decision to go here based on this. It was 95 degrees out (hottest day of the year so far) and weren't given water. There are a number of better options in the immediate vicinity of this restaurant. If you're looking for weekend brunch or lunch, go to The Smith, Atlantic Grill, or Bar Balud instead.",1,,

We were greeted by Charles the manager also same name as me as my wife told him it was my birthday.  We were immediately seated at a great table and serviced by Kaji and Kevin absolutely the best wait staff we have ever had.Our orders were served quickly which was a great selection of the finest grilled vegetables and entrees that were truly fantastic a must other spaghetti with bronzini and their ravioli. They comped our liquor and desert and we both will be sure to visit Cafe Fiorello in the future, we both haven't been able to stop telling people how fantastic this restaurant was.  Thank you Charles Kaji  and Kevin for a truly an enjoyable dinner.",1,,

174,Alla K.,"New York, NY",68,76,0,2.0,4/18/2016,"Average. That's pretty much how to describe it; we got the pizza which was alright and cold, the spaghetti and meatballs entree, which i really liked but this portion wasn't even enough for one person. We also got the chocolate pizza for dessert - don't order that, it was cold and just bad. There was also no silverware on the table when we sat down. The good part was the service, our waiter was fast and very nice. Would not come back.",,,

Updated review","I'm updating my review - they changed the price of two meatballs from $12 to $9 and give the option of four meatballs for $17.  Also, Michael (or was it David), the maitre'd, was so kind to recognize that i was a regular and squeezed a table for two in despite the fact that we had no reservation.  Also, five stars alone for the complimentary focaccia and great service",1,,
177,Sally A.,"Briarwood, NY",24,35,36,3.0,2/8/2015,"Came here with 5 friends for dinner. . It was easy to get reservations,  and seating was quick. .free coat check. . The food was ok.. their special ""open faced"" lasagne. . Well it's just a lazy dish. . They basically layer the pasta on a large dish,  then they put all the toppings on top. .. super lazy,  not lasagne at all. . To be fair the ingredients were yummy... in the center. ..We also ordered a supreme pizza. .pepperoni,  sausage,  meatball. .. it was okay. .. not $30 wroth at all! The caprese salad was okay. .. the mozzarella was a Lil too creamy for my taste. ..We also overheard a waiter telling another waiter to just go in the back,  take off the unwanted mushrooms that a customer complained about,  wait 5 minutes and come back. .yikes!!!!!!!!The highlight was seeing Bill Cartwright at the next table. .",,,

In fact, it's where I had my first prosecco (back when that was exotic!)Last night, our host and waiter were just wonderful. They were warm, and funny and took wonderful care of us. We stayed far too long after we had eaten and were never made to feel we should move it along. I just love the remodeling (and the new bar!) and am very much looking forward to the recent addition of breakfast service.",,,
179,Sherwin C.,"New York, NY",6,7,4,3.0,3/1/2016,"I was looking forward to trying this place for a while since one of colleagues love this place and I've heard good things about their pizza. Finally made it there last week. We got seated right away. While we were looking at our menus, a server came by with free truffle mini muffins. They were delicious and who doesn't love free food!The meal we had was not terrible but I'm not sure if it was worth the hype. It could also be what we chose on the menu. We ordered the goat cheese pizza and the cappelletti. I was not a fan of the pasta but the pizza was not bad. It just was not what we expected because instead of goat cheese crumbs spread throughout the pie, it was large chunks placed on certain slices. My colleague ended up picking the slices without cheese because she thought it was too much goat cheese for her. I think this is just personal preference though. If I come back again, I'd probably try their other pizzas.",,,
180,Kelly H.,"Orlando, FL",860,396,630,5.0,4/5/2012,"Yum!I was on vacation and we walked by this lovely spot on a Sunday afternoon (around noon or 1:00) and we decided to get some lunch.  Turns out they serve brunch on Saturday as well, which was great.We were greated by a wonderful waitress who welcomed us by letting us know we each got a complimentary drink with our choice of a bloody mary, mimosa, or bellini.  If you're not sure which one to get....I highly recommend the bellini.  It was absolutely delicious and I wanted more.  And let me tell you, the complimentary drink  is a steal considering if you want a second it will cost you $12.00.The bread basket was great!  I will start off by saying that I do not eat bread, strictly because I do not like it and so I never care too much about the bread they bring out, but to my surprise...I found some marble pound cake in the bread basket that was buttery and delicious!For my meal I had the meatball thin crust pizza which was very good (although not as good as the thin crust pizza I had at Tappo) my friend has the fried ravioli (which he said was AMAZING) all I could hear the entire meal from him was ""mmm""  ""so good""  ""oh my god"".  We were very full by the end of our meals that we did not get dessert, although I kind of regret that after seeing the cheesecake the woman sitting next to us had.  I was in mid conversation when it was brought out when my jaw dropped and lost all my concentration on what I was saying.  My friend had to yell ""Hey Kelly"" for me to stop starring at the dessert next to me and get back to reality!",2,3,2
181,Amanda J.,"New York, NY",128,3,0,3.0,5/23/2017,"I wish I could give Cafe Fiorello 4-5 stars but my latest dinning experience was not that great.  My fiance and I came here for brunch around 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, 5/21.  The outdoor seating area was pretty much dead so we decided to eat outside.  Our waitress was nice when she first greeted us and took our order but throughout the meal she was nowhere to be found.  We also had to ask for water, meanwhile every other table around us had bottle of water and drinking glasses at their table.  The worst part of the experience was at the end of the meal.  Couldn't find our waitress for 25 minutes to get our bill.  I had to go inside and find a manager and ask for our bill.  As someone in the food and hospitality industry and having been a waitress early in my career I understand how you may have tables both in and outside of the restaurant but if you can't keep up with the few tables you have outside then there's a staffing issue.  Food was great but they really need to work on their level of service.",,1,

We came here at 11pm after an opera show and was immediately seated, but it took 30+ minutes just to get someone come over to take order. Food came out quickly and we started eating around 12:15. The waitress who never looked at us before ordering asked us five times during the course of ten minutes how we were doing with food, and as soon as the last bite was gone they took the plates away. I understand that the closing time is 12:30, but it is not our fault that we only got our food 15 min before closing.",,1,
184,Nazreen S.,"North Vancouver, Canada",16,31,26,1.0,6/27/2015,"I am writing this review as I am sitting at this restaurant. Safe to say I'm baffled by their customer service. Firstly, we walked in and waited 5 minutes before any of the waiters decided to come and greet us or sit us at a table. 3 or them looked us straight in the eye and walked away. Secondly,  we sat down and I asked if they had any fruit salad. Or any kind of fruit. It's a valid question when you sit down for breakfast. The waiter seemed so offended. I said ok thanks. Il get something else. He stood there staring into me more  offended and walked away. My fiancé was not happy with this at all. He wanted to get up and leave. I let it be. It was already a late breakfast and I didn't want to leave and make a dramatic exit! Another waitress came and she seemed nicer. On a brighter note the food was good according to my fiancé. Good coffee too. They offer complimentary cakes and muffins. I was so put off by the waiter's attitude I did not want to eat anything here. This is the first time I have walked out of a restaurant without a sip of water. I also get why the place next door (smith) is more packed. We went there on our first day at NYC. Please read my review on it. Way way way better and excellent customer service.",4,2,1

186,Eric C.,"Morrisville, PA",0,29,0,4.0,12/11/2016,Someone in the kitchen knows how to flavor with spices. Delicious! My wife had the antipasto (three veggies and a double order of shrimp and scallops. I had the short rib meatballs with pasta. The antipasta had wonderful distinct flavors with the squash ricotta tart being the absolute star of the show. The shrimp and scallops were served cold with some chopped salad; all of which seemed to come from a flavorful vinaigrette marinade. My shortrib meatballs came as a pair on a small bed of very flavorful spaghetti.  Everything spoke of a deft hand with seasonings. The food was 5 star but slippage came from a significant time lag between the arrival of my dish and that of my wife's.,,,

190,Beth P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/20/2017,I had the worst dining experience last night in this restaurant.  My brother and I were going to a play at Lincoln center and made a reservation there because it is close.  They seated us and it took awhile for the waiter to come.  He took our drink order and a good 20 minutes went by before he came back with the drinks.  Then he took our dinner order.  It took another 25 minutes before that came.  We both ordered veal parmigiana.  Mine was cooked and not bad tasting.  My brother's was completely raw and uncooked except for a little on the edges.  We asked for bread 3 times and it never came.  I ended up splitting my meal with my brother and he put his plate on the edge of the table so someone might notice and come by to ask if everything was all right.  No one ever did.  The waiter came back when we were done our food and my brother told him his meal was not cooked and he had eaten half of mine so he didn't want it.  The bill came and my brother's meal was on it.  The waiter told him that he needed his manager to approve taking it off which he did do.  I would not eat in this place ever again.,,1,

193,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",95,448,0,4.0,1/5/2014,"After slipping all over the sidewalks today (I know understand what ""freezing rain"" is), my husband and I ducked into Cafe Fiorello for some brunch.My thoughts:* Location / Ambiance are fantastic. Not many restaurants can boast a view of the Lincoln Center. Inside is cozy and clean.* Food is good. Not fantastic but good. The antipasti platter is my favorite but just know the quantities are pretty small for the price. I highly recommend the fava bean / peas combo - so good. Avoid the asparagus - really tough and too greasy.My husband had an omelette - he ate the whole thing which means he apparently enjoyed it somewhat. (One never does know with him.) The complimentary bread basket was very tasty, and the waiter walking around handing out freshly baked chocolate chip cookies was a nice touch.* Prices are high here - no getting around it. I guess they need to pay for their view somehow.* Service is good. Nothing to write home about but the server was friendly enough.Overall this place is convenient and their vast menu works since my husband and I are rarely on the same page when it comes to what we want to eat. I highly recommend Cafe Fiorello!",1,1,

We ordered several appetizers and entrees. The waiter got our appetizer order wrong twice. On the good side he was very nice about correcting the order. The salads were overdressed and seemed to be missing ingredients listed in the menu. The open faced lasagna was huge but not very good. My wife sent her soup back as it was mushy and tasteless. My mussels were okay but too salty for my taste. For the money there are definitely better places to go. The service was very friendly and they did get us out in time to get to the theater.",1,,

The ""Lasagna"" - even though I do get its supposed to be deconstructed - was a plate of MUSH - HELL NO.  The Veal Marsala with mushrooms - three little pieces of veal - hardly any sauce and like 6 mushrooms - HORRIBLE TASTELESS RIPOFF.Go down to Little Italy and get a real meal.",,2,

I wanted to order a cheese burger but it was before 8pm. The menu only allows sandwiches and cheeseburgers after 8pm. Ok so I picked chicken parm and should have just not bothered to take a bite. It was slimy gross with so much oil and garlic I could have vomited right there and then. My daughter wanted something that was not made with gluten or dairy. Other then lettuce, there was nothing. I asked could they just put a piece of chicken on the grill plain. The waiter said no because ""They don't have a grill""... ?? what??? How do you not have a grill in this restaurant. Do they order their food from somewhere else to be delivered to them? There was 6 of use and only 2 had a glass of wine ....and all of us had inedible disgusting varieties off of their menu. Bill was over $500. A complete waste of money. I know it's NYC and expect the bill to be high, but it hits you hard knowing the food was awful!!  I would have rather given the $500 to a homeless person in front of the restaurant sitting on a cardboard box.... The Smith next door is much better. We should have gone there. Will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS WASTE OF A DUMP!!!",,,

Updated review","Tried this place one more time due to convenience. This used to be a refined place.Now it's a super loud place with tables crammed so close together, the waiters can't get through without bumping into you.High prices for mediocre food.Endive salad not fresh. Pizza fair.Yelp should get rid of the reviews from over 3 years ago... then it would not have as many stars",,,
