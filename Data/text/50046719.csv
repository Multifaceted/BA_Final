0,Chelsea L.,"Albany, NY",3,12,1,5.0,10/25/2018,"Honestly the best vet I've ever been to. My cat Wolfie was not feeling too well after he had an injured front leg, and was limping so we took him to the emergency vet. They pushed lots of treatments and diagnostics on me, and offered no real answers or solutions. They prescribed him pain killers and sent us home, not to mention charged a lot. I gave him the pain killers, and at that point he stopped eating. So, I took little Wolfie to the Dr. Matute here at Animal Hospital & Clinic of Jersey City. She was amazing! Seriously a god-sent doctor; kind and caring and super helpful. She listened to me and listened to Wolfie and helped figure out a treatment plan to get him well again. Our Wolfie is now on his way to feeling better and it's all thanks to Dr. Matute and the staff here. They even followed up with calls to check in on Wolfie. I'm so thankful I found this place, and so thankful for the amazing service! Not to mention the reasonable prices that aren't pushed on you, and are completely explained beforehand. Can't say thank you enough!! I will definitely be making this my go-to vet.",4,4,4

The treatment we received was satisfactory. And, as most vets, they provided us with treatment options and quotes for overall costs. I liked that doctor was honest about the treatment and testing that we did and did not need.In comparison to our vets at Banfield who we go to for preventative things, it is very easy to get any sort of appointment here. We also live nearby, which is convenient.",17,13,14

We saw two different doctors, both were super nice and really knowledgeable and genuinely cared about my Chucky. Front staff are friendly; making and rescheduling appointments are easy. Location is great for me. Parking on the street sucks but there is a parking lot, which is helpful. They're reasonably priced but I know my pet is getting great care so it's totally worth it! Pickup hours are great as well. And they called to check on Chuck after his surgery!!",7,6,6
3,Jersey N.,"Newark, NJ",22,83,487,5.0,8/28/2017,"We have been coming here for years I will say over 15+ years. They were my vet for Lil Man they're took such great care of him of course they would have to continue to care for my cats Becca and Sassy. When I first took Lil Man here I think I was more nervous than him. I was so nervous I didn't go in the room with him and Doc but my wife did. They assured me everything would be ok you would have sworn I was the one getting needles. They gave Lil Man all his needed vaccines to get him updated. Sad to say Lil Man is no longer with me. Becca and Sassy are now their patients. The one cool thing they do is call the pets name when it's time to see Doc. They are the only vet that Sassy has been to for the most part. Both cats are relaxed in the rooms. There are three examination rooms Dr. Buchholz speaks with volume. They give you a breakdown of what vaccines are needed what test should be done. Yet they don't pressure you into anything to fatten their pockets. You can board your pet there when you go on vacation they also do grooming. It's a great place to take your pets in you are in the area. Even if you're from the Ironbound section of Newark, Kearny, Belleville and Nutley.",19,12,15

5,Carla R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0,1.0,11/30/2017,"We have been going to this practice since we adopted our mutt, in fact it was a recommendation from a friend. Our beloved pup grew a pretty nasty looking wart so we decided to bring her in to inquire about removal. Shockingly, we were quoted almost $1,200 hundred dollars. They insisted that our dog needed to be put under anesthesia in order to do so, now... I want to be clear that if we felt it was necessary we would have absolutely taken any measure to make sure our girl got the best care. But, anesthesia for a wart seemed extreme, especially because she have the gentlest, most docile dog in the world. Anesthesia is the most dangerous part of a medical procedure whether it's a human or animal so we decided to get a second opinion. We researched and found a vet about 20 miles away with a great reputation, we had a consultation and they were able to remove the wart that day for under 200 dollars. No anesthesia, just a couple of stitches and some pain killers. We were extremely disappointed with the outcome of our appointment with Animal Hospital & Clinic of JC, just a warning to anyone out there.... it's worth a second opinion.",2,,

10,Ashley B.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,2,0,1.0,9/17/2017,"After visiting this vet exclusively for four years, they have officially lost our business and any hope of a future recommendation.  It took $1,000 and four vet visits for the various vets we saw (you tend to not see the same one) to still NOT heal our dog's open wound on the top of her paw.  Vet Visit 1: On the first visit, they insisted she had allergies and inflicted the wound by licking herself too much.  We were convinced this was not the case (we've had her for five years with NO signs of allergies) but we felt that the vet was not listening.  After this first visit, we were prescribed several expensive antibiotics.  We are told to keep our dog in a cone until it heals.  We tell the vet that we think there is a bur under the skin as we find these on her fur often from the plants near where we live.Vet Visit 2, 1 week later: After over a week, our dog's wound is still bleeding and pussing.  We take her back in and they keep her for an entire day and decide to open up the wound and put her under anesthesia.  They clean it and say that they didn't really find anything.  We are prescribed even stronger antibiotics and soaks for her paw.  We mention the bur again and ask if that can be the problem, they insist  they didn't find anything.Vet Visit 3, Another week later: They're still not sure why it's still bleeding and not healing.  We are prescribed more antibiotics, soaks, etc. that are not healing the dog's paw.  She has now been in a cone for over three weeks.  Vet Visit 4, After 4 weeks with an open wound: We are now told that she needs to be prescribed steroids for the swelling since her body is probably not reacting well to the injury.  We decline to buy them and make an appointment at a new vet--Metro Vet.This new vet finds the bur that had entered the skin of her paw within a few minutes and only charged us $100.  To make matters even worse, we felt like we consistently received poor care and were just quickly moved along each time by a different vet at Jersey City Animal Hospital.  We thought all along that there was a bur in the injury and that is EXACTLY what the new vet found.  The vets at Jersey City Animal Hospital did not spend enough time looking at the injury and listening to our concerns and ideas about what could have caused the injury.Day 2 after the new vet removed the bur: Our dog is practically healed after the bur was removed and was not prescribed ANY medications.Go to Metro Vet in Jersey City.  Much better care, the doctor spends more time with you, listens closely, examines more thoroughly and the office is much cleaner.",2,,
11,Niya R.,"Montclair, NJ",560,138,1248,5.0,10/9/2016,"Funny story : We went to get a coffee one Saturday morning and decided to drive to PA to see some puppies (just because we were bored and wanted to test drive the car). We came back home with a 18 lb eight week old labrador retriever puppy! What can I say?!We noticed our puppy had little flying bugs on him on our way back (no idea what they were then, only later did we know they were fleas, We were that ignorant about dogs). We called in several vet clinics before we went home, to see if they would perform a routine exam on our puppy and medicate him for the fleas, but no luck. Animal Hospital and Clinic of Jersey City was so wonderful to squeeze us in when we told them we just got a puppy and we had no idea what to do then.We were seen almost immediately. The doctor and the assistant were so wonderful to us and the puppy. We got some of his shots that day and they were patient with our every little silly question. They even threw some freebies in for us. The subsequent appointments, we were seen by Dr. Lawrence Buchholz, Oh what a delight. Our puppy loves him and we wish he was our physician. He is warm and friendly and was always kind enough to see us on short notices. His passion and love for the animals is so evident and I am sure the pets sense it as well. The staff is lovely and so welcoming. The entire team is wonderful. Though I now moved 40 minutes away from the place, just the staff and the doctors make the drive so worth it.",21,18,19
12,Katie M.,"Manhattan, NY",16,10,1,5.0,6/29/2016,"The review is long overdue, but I always wanted to write something positive about a sad time in my life a year ago. I visited the clinic twice with my 18 year old beloved cat, Milly. Upon my first visit, it was probably apparent to Dr. Buchholz that Milly was close to the end, but he did what he could to help me buy some time and accept the inevitable. Two weeks later, she was clearly struggling and I brought her back. I still didn't know when I brought her in that it would be her last day, but Dr. Buchholz helped me realize that the final act of love would be to let her go. The whole office was incredibly kind and patient with me on the hardest day of my life. I'll always be grateful for that. They even sent a card to me after Milly's death that offered a lot of comfort and I still have on my refrigerator. I highly recommend this facility and Dr. Buchholz. One final note because people seem to bring up cost. I found their prices very reasonable, but I'm also a person who would spend anything necessary to help a beloved pet if we're given excellent care - which we were.",34,18,22

He was extremely thorough and was helpful in keeping me calm (more than the puppy lol). The pricing is laid out very clearly by the doctor before you pay and before you get any treatments done which I appreciate because we're going thru a $$ issue so I'm glad i didnt get a massive bill. Luckily I'm 15mins by foot and 5mins by car so this is definitely going to be the go to place for me now that i moved to the neighborhood,20,19,20

15,Christine A.,"Massapequa, NY",0,13,0,1.0,4/1/2018,"This place is ridiculous. All of the dr's are extremely young and have no compassion for pets. I went 3 times and had a bad experience each time. One time my dog had a severe ear infection. It was obvious and I went there for treatment. She offered me a 50 dollar ear ointment that I already had at home. I told her I had it already but because I'm already here and I'm paying $50 dollars for the visit, if she can just clean his ear quickly. She said I had to pay another $20 for the ear cleaning. I told her I was already paying $50 and I'm not getting anything from the visit because I already knew it was infected and I had the ointment already at home so it would be nice if she can just clean the ear. It would've taken her two minutes but she insisted I pay. There was 0 compassion, and the place smelled on top of that. I ended up going to a different vet a few months later, and the dr cleaned my dogs ear WITHOUT me even asking!! Seeing that doctors compassion made me remember how poor the service was at jersey city animal hospital. I don't recommend this place.",1,,

They always give me a breakdown of possible costs before they do any tests. There's short wait times, unlike other veterinary clinics I've used.

They treated Manny with kindness and respect.  He boarded there and was groomed.  They gave him meds to help his fear of cars and travel.  Manny and I live in Minnesota now and I hope our new vet is half as good.  The prices didn't seem too inconsistent with what I have always spent on vets.  They also had parking, which was a huge bonus.",27,20,23

The last two times I've visited they've followed up on the phone a few days later just to make sure my cats had responded well to treatment (one cat had an eye infection and the other an ear infection), which they did.  I live around the corner from this vet so it's very convenient. Before I tried them, I read some of the bad reviews here and instead schlepped my cats to Bayonne and Downtown JC. Finally, I decided to give this place a go after meeting someone on the bus who swears by it and brings her dog in all the way from Grove Street. I'm glad I did as they are more affordable and just as good if not better than Bayonne and Downtown! The only reason I've not given them 5 stars is that it's a little bit no frills appearance wise. They could use a decorator to make the place feel a bit more inviting and warm.",31,28,28
20,Maritza K.,"Jersey City, NJ",38,36,5,4.0,10/14/2014,"I have read the other reviews and can only go based on my experience thus far. I have stuck with this group of vets for approximately 4 years now. I find the staff to be very courteous, respectful, and professional.  I have used the clinic for vet needs and from time to time, for grooming needs as well. I don't have any complaints regarding the care my numerous dogs and cat have received through out the years. I would rate the higher but have not for the only reason: the grooming environment.  I just have concerns that some of the appointments made with the groomer are for these HUGE and very loud dogs and meanwhile my toy poodles is frightened to the point of having a little seizure. My only suggestion would be (and I know this is hard to accommodate) is to book appointments carefully: don't book appointments for a mastif to be groomed while a yorkie, toy poodle (basically a small dog) has to wait in a cage and endure having a huge animal act the way it does while getting groomed. Don't get me wrong, the grooming services are satisfactory, I just can't deal with my little pups (and they ail always be little pups) in the same space as a huge and loud dog. So to conclude: **the doctors and staff - amazing! **Grooming - satisfactory.  **Wait time - depends, usually wait time is not a problem**Prices - well I don't know a vet who is dirt cheap. This place I feel is fair and they will provide an estimate before moving onto whatever needs done**they have free parking next to the clinic!!** will send you reminders for when vaccinations are needed",35,29,30

There are so many vets that see your animal, usually never the same one. That wouldn't be a huge issue if they all had the same experience. There have been a couple of visits where I felt the veterinarians weren't too concerned or informed. I am not a fan of immunizations due to their side effects but I understand that I have to keep my pet out of harms way. At an annual check up my dog received, Rabies, Distemper, and Lyme which I was told from an outside vet that Lyme is very strong. I have a small dog and I asked the Veterinarian if all of these shots would be too strong for her to take. I also added that I would be going on a hike with her the next day. The doctor told me, ""No she may be tired today but should be perfect by tomorrow."" She gives her all the shots on one leg and the next morning my dog is panting and shaking and limping. She wouldn't even eat. After calling 24 hour hospitals, I found out that most Veterinarians don't give animals vaccines in the same spot to help the pain and some recommend not giving them all at once. Which makes sense to me because that is what I asked her. I have been to Secaucus Animal Hospital and their doctors are more concerning, kind, and fill you in on what is best for your pet. I went back to explain to them what went wrong (I did this calmly) and the receptionist gets defense telling me that animals get vaccine reactions in just a few hours. Instead of being helpful and sympathetic. This blew my mind but I remained calm and made sure not to see the same doctor, Dr. Ashley Beard. If you care about your pet, be sure to ask them for a very good doctor and hope to get the same one every time. Pros - They tend to see you quickly and they have a few helpful staffCons - Unexperienced doctors who don't show much concern",5,,

Just wanted a definite diagnosis and perhaps some medicine to ease his suffering. Instead they gave me a print out of all the various tests they wanted to perform including ones for kitty AIDS, Cancer, Diabetes, etc. at a cost of over $500! I'm sure they could tell that this cat did not have long to live but all they seemed intereted in was how much money they could get from me. Avoid at all costs....",3,,
27,L S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,1,1.0,5/13/2016,"I came to this clinic because it's close to our apartment and we're kinda new to the area, meaning we didn't need a vet for the 1yr we've been here. Our male cat started losing hair on his tail, he has a really bushy tail so for him to start going bald was noticeable. I called and made an appointment for the weekend and was very disappointed. The place smelled like wet dog,which i guess is normal for a vets office but anyways and then we had to wait for 40min to see the vet. When we finally made it in to the office she had inspected him for 30 seconds and told us he is fat. She asked if we free feed him, which i said yes although I do control the amount he eats but she never asked that just made a comment about if i ate whatever i want i would be fat too! I did not find that appropriate at all. She believed my cat was stressed, she never asked about his diet how much or what he eats and further more his shots were expired but she apparently did not read his papers!!! She then left and sent the tech in who told us all the tests the vet recommended which were allergy shot,urine,blood,full body xrays. I asked what does full body xrays at $500 have to do with him losing hair on his tail? No one had an answer. I left with my baby having an allergy shot and urine test both which did nothing. I changed his food a month after the vet and his hair started growing back. If the vet was so concerned with him being overweight you think she would have done her job by recommending a diet for him instead of insulting me,she never even asked what he eats! Which by the way is 3/4 cup of dry purina indoor and he is 14lbs because he is a big cat. She Never even checked the dates on his shots. Awful doctor i wouldn't trust her with a dead squirrel, doesn't care about the animals only the money for the clinic and clearly lazy!",3,1,

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and the facility is always totally clean and tidy. Dr. Lugones is awesome -- she is very thorough and does not skip anything when it comes to testing and trying to diagnose a problem. We have also had one of the pups groomed there, and the groomer did a fabulous job! This place deserves 5 stars for that alone -- Scooter gets bored while being groomed and tends to try to lay down and flop on his side for a nap.  He did get a little bandanna after his summer haircut -- though that was donated to his sister, Dottie (it was neon colors, a lot of pink, Scoo says he doesn't wear pink. Only red and black.). She hates taking it off!Dr. Lugones also helped us when Dottie was gravely ill (story is under my review for Oradell Animal Hospital, which is a fantastic place as well!). Her attention to detail helped us to cover all the little parts of Dottie's illness (caused by a compromised immune system).  She is GREAT with the dogs, they love her! Hopefully she'll also be the one to do our cat's spay next week (yeah we have a full house.............)Overall, this place has improved a lot over the years (my BFF used to use them long ago) and has a great team now!

Even after we explain that puppy feel absolutely good and act normal, doctor Buchholz did almost the exact same thing that we already did at the Emergency, even though we said and showed hem the Bill so he can understand what steps we already did. The Hospital was 275$, and the Animal Clinic charged us AGAIN 230$ !!!! for different injections and pills. Without any exam, only after we insisted to make a poop exam, he agree to do that. On next day clinic call for said that puppy got some parasite and we need to pic up our medicine, and charge us again for 65$!!!! same medicine on amazon cost 14$!!!!!! Animal Clinic & Hospital doesn't care about health of pet, only about money!!! they dont care that our puppy already got medicine and actually its never good to take a lot medicine, that she is actually okay, didn't hurry to make exam for find the reason of our problem, just try to get more money!!!! if you care about your pet be careful when choosing a vet!

I've experienced better."" because it used to be a better place but over the last two years it has changed; not for the good.I grew up a couple of blocks away from JC Animal Hospital.  When I was a kid, you did not go there.  Not clean and horrible pet care.  10 Years Later.  Seemed better.  Friendly doctors who seemed to care.  Also, their Visit charge was only around $30 compared to other vets and they didn't charge for multiple visits for the same issue.2011.  Visit price is now $56, just as much as any other vet in the area. The vet seems to have a revolving door for their doctors.  Dr. Conner and Dr. Yoo left and now it seems to have new doctors every month.  When you are there, you will talk more to the techs and assistants about the ""Estimate"" then you will to the doctor about your pet.  Last time I was there, the estimate had frivolous items on it so I had them removed.  When I received the new estimate, one of the tests I decided to keep was at a new and higher price.  When confronted about it, they denied it till I had them dig the original estimate out of the trash.  Price went up $50.  My pets have never been hurt or harmed by them, and they do follow up when they say they will.  The personal part of the practice is gone; it seems just to be about the money.Finding a good vet is like finding a good mechanic- Need someone who does good work and won't try to rip you off.Have Fun",12,,
36,Dennice C.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,4,0,5.0,1/3/2015,I live in Hoboken and even though there is an animal hospital in Hoboken they way over priced my dog stoped eating for few days i brought my dog here in desperate situation not knowing what was wrong thinking my dog was dying of old age THE SERVICE I GOT WAS WAY BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS the doctors are amazing they were very fair with prices and honest they didnt make me waste  money on nessesary tests and performed only the test that my dog needed to find out whats wrong my dog had an really bad infection and she was near death she was giving antibiotics right away and treated with propper care. This is the best hospital around because doctors actually care about your pet and not trying to rip you off. Im only bringing my dog here from now on.,8,8,8
37,Tami K.,"Jersey City, NJ",50,34,3,5.0,10/16/2013,"I brought my little kitty in today here at jersey city animal hospital, I was worried that my cat might have ringworm. I noticed the blatant similarities of her sores and loss of hair compared to pics on google and was so worried, I simply asked for a basic check up and a honest opinion, I was worried that they would try to up charge me for tests and lab work NOT THE CASE HERE! Bianca and I saw Dr.Gaylord, who was very professional and you can tell he really cared. I agreed with him on every level. I would of loved to find out what was really going on threw tests but I can not afford that whole mess of what Is probably obviously a fungal or bacterial infection, shampoo antibiotics and a little cream and we were on our way,, he even told us to come back in a week free of charge for a minute check up, so Amazing. My husband and I rescued her off the mean streets, and everything is fine  I am so relieved to find a AWESOME vet so close to home!!!!!! Can not recommend enough!!!!! ( I might be wrong about the ringworm. But better safe then sorry lol do not hesitate because of the location , I am from the squeaky clean suburbs of Monmouth county and can tell you one thing ,,, you can trust these guys (-:",30,29,30
38,Sandra S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,3,0,4.0,8/30/2011,"I disagree with the other post. I had a sick cat that I ultimately had to put to sleep a few years ago, at this hospital. The cat had a growth on her leg that tested positive for cancer. Instead of putting me through extensive, unnecessary treatment that was painful for the animal - the vet (whose name I don't remember....young Asian guy) walked me through all of my choices in the beginning, clearly explaining every option.In the end, I chose to forego the painful chemo treatment for my pet - and when she became visably uncomfortable, I put her to sleep - with the support of the hostpital veternarians and staff. I feel like they were very straightforward and professional providing guidance through a difficult decision.",31,29,30

40,Michael O.,"Bayonne, NJ",42,39,3,1.0,8/26/2010,"This clinic was great at first.  I would agree with most of the positive comments posted for this place, with an exception.  The price was a little pricey but convenient.  Just recently took my puppy over there for a checkup due to some breathing issues.  The clinic charged us over $200.00 for an X-ray and antibiotics.  There was no clear explanation on why my dog needs to take antibiotics since the X-ray clearly proved there was nothing wrong (so they say).  So, they forced us to get the antibiotics, but wait here is the kicker.  They were about to charge us over $400.00 for a series of medication for my puppy that we never received.  Wow, really?  When we tried arguing they said they dispensed the medication during the previous appointment.  I remember the last appointment, my puppy received his shot, veterinarian suggested taking a series of medication, I agreed.  Went to the front desk paid my bill and didn't receive anything from the receptionist.  I even said ""if that was it"" she said yes and I went to my car with the bill.  I know it was my fault for not checking but, still. If these people really cared about the animals they would have given at least a discounted price or something worth compromising.   I guess there are crooks working behind the counter too in Jersey City besides the streets.  Go here at your own risk, wonderful staff (some of them), and good facilities.  Just be careful of the over charge and make sure you check on the bill on what you are actually paying for.",11,5,
41,Jcfan J.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,9/5/2012,"My family has used this hospital for 2 generations (of people) and 3 generations (of pets)...both my parents and I wouldn't go anywhere else. They came here before Dr. Buchholtz took over, and it was ok then, but Dr. B has always cared for our smallest family members as if they were his own. Over the years everyone at the hospital has been kind and compassionate. We have sent many of our friends there, and they are always treated well. They (and we) have seen various doctors, and they have had all good experiences (well some werent good, but thats because we have had to put pets to sleep over the years. Any pet owner knows how hard that can be, but the level of compassion at this hospital has always made it easier). Dr. Buchholtz has always answered any questions we had, and explained what was going to happen before it does. Rose, the office manager has been great also. As long as I have pets, they will always go here!I guess yelp doesn't like my reviews as they have all been pushed to their ""filtered"" page...I don't know what their filter looks for, but I guess they are telling me something! Seems pretty weird that a review site would remove reviews...",27,26,26
42,Lu L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,3,5,2.0,11/1/2014,"I dont know how to rate this place. I feel like the people are nice, but provided me nothing.. I have a RABBIT, and luckily, found this place can take care of rabbit. It is suggested that to take the rabbit for a ""regular check"", get to know about the vet and set up record for your rabbit. They told me it would be $62 and I accepted. However, it was just an observing check lasted 20mins included waiting for vet comes out, and say goodbye. The following days I searched online what should I have in regular check? Mostly the hospital would examine the feces to check whether there's parasite; Also they need a mirror tool to check rabbit's molar teeth, because we can only observe incisors without the mirror. Teeth are fatal important for a rabbit, may kill them if developed unproperly. There could be more things to check. However, during my rabbit's body check, the only instrument is a weight scale... a blanket and the vet's glove. The vet was doing nothing else than what I usually do. They didnt even ask me if I want some more check, even if for additional money. Seems like they couldnt do that at all. They just told me he's healthy, no comments suggestions questions. I felt weird the second day after I paid $62.. is that all? for 62? More importantly, are they capable to help my rabbit in case he really gets sick? I'm really doubt.",,,
43,Casey K.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,4,0,1.0,7/2/2014,I brought my cat in due to signs of a UTI. The cat was given fluids and an antibiotic. The cat began urinating regularly but almost instantaniously began sneezing and wheezing. When I called the vet to discuss it and get their input no vet would get on the phone with me or call me back. They would only speak with me if I made an appointment. I did not want to do this as I have another cat who has been aggressive with the sick cat since my last visit there plus the stress of a vet visit alone can make a cat sick. The office was not clean and I was willing to give them a second chance anyway until now. I did not matter to them when I called back as no one would speak to me. I called my old vet and he got right on the phone and agreed that I should not bring the sick cat in and cause unnecessary stress. He helped me over the phone even though he is not the vet that I recently paid over $200 to.,3,,

45,Susan N.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,27,0,4.0,9/18/2012,"We have been very pleased with the vets here. We've worked with several vets over the last four years, most recently Dr. Green, whom we love (and our one cat, in particular, loves!). One of our cats has had a lot of health problems, and we've seen vets at five different hospitals/clinics over the past four years (some because we needed medical care after hours, some because we needed medical care beyond what is provided here). This clinic has been our favorite. The vets, techs, and receptionists are almost universally very caring. We can always get in on the day we want to, and we rarely have to wait much beyond our appointment time. We always know the estimates in advance; the vets go through all of our options, and don't push for us to spend the most money. Rather, they talk about the best path to balance the optimum care for our pet with what makes sense from a practical standpoint. For example, an expensive diagnostic test might let us know she has one of two conditions -- but both are treated with the same medication. So, they decide just to treat her without the test and see what happens. Other vets have not spent the time to figure this out with us and look at the whole picture. As a result, our very sick cat has survived, with a good quality of life, well beyond what we would have expected.",33,30,29
46,Christina S.,"Jersey City, NJ",97,6,0,4.0,2/20/2010,"I recently took my 5 month old kitten here for routine shots. I was very pleased with the service I received. I was able to make an appointment that worked with my schedule and the place was not too crowded even though it was a Saturday afternoon. It was very clean. The doctors assistant was very helpful and nice and was playing with the kitten throughout the whole visit to keep the kitten occupied. She and the doctor were very helpful with my situation. I had went to a different doctor once before to get the kittens first shot. I did not have the paper work with me, so they talked me through what happened at the previous vet to see what else the kitten needs. I also received a great surprise. I had not checked this out myself, and took the word of the previous vet, I was told that the kitten was a female, in this vets office, I came to find out that my little girl, was actually a boy. The Dr's aid helped me through the shock of this big surprise, I felt bad as an owner for not realizing it myself and she assured me that because he is a kitten, it is hard to tell. The doctor was very friendly with the kitten, he even picked him up and showed my kitten love. He explained to me in detail, and in terms that I can understand, how to care for my kitten. he also discussed with me the pros and cons of a decision that is very hard for me to make, to declaw or not. I have now made my choice of what I will do and feel confident in my decision. he also drew me up an estimate for for me to take home and review for any upcoming procedures/shots that the kitty needs to have. The only thing that did not have me exceptionally happy was that it was a bit more expensive than I had thought. My previous vet was less then half this price, but you get what you pay for. I would still recommend this to anybody that has doubts, I had another cat, who stayed at my mothers house after I moved out, I've been to a couple of different vets with her and overall, I have never been this pleased.",36,30,31
