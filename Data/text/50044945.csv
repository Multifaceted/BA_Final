Friends and I always like to check out new places to eat and when we do find a place we enjoy.... we feel lucky.This place is different.... this place is just A-mazing. Excellent service, quality is top notch. I would go to this place even if their prices are higher!Business side of me will put this restaurant to a higher end scale. Put a higher price, have some more reviews from famous commentator/person this place will be more popular in no time. Better check out this place before they really get busy and get a longer wait time!Will go here again and again everytime I am in the hood.",2,,
1,Jamie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,0,2.0,11/18/2018,"Been a regaular here for a year and a half now. In the recent months the staff has changed and we've been given to-go orders of other people's food, and have recieved very strange service.Hard to let this place go because the food is wonderful! The new gentleman at the front who often is wearing hat is a huge problem for this business. They haven't gotten our order correct in months and we used to come here 3/4 times a week and tip well.We are so disappointed, we used to love this place. Only worth going when certain staff is there or it is a sad experience!",,,
2,Kitana M.,"Manhattan, NY",91,30,11,4.0,8/30/2018,"This food was pretty amazing for East Harlem. Probably the best place I have been to in my area . It's a super cute tiny restaurant. The servers were nice and our order came out perfectly. I loved the home fries and the corn bread. I ordered a latte which tasted great. I was a bummed out because our server didn't know how to do latte art like I saw on Yelp, but it tasted great and they gave me sugar on the side to make itSweetened to my liking. The only thing I would recommend changing is the bacon. It was way to crispy and just kind of fell apart the second I touched it.  Also stay away from the rolled omelet if you like your eggs dry my eggs were good but very wet.I will definitely be back and I am super excited to try their lunch and special cakes!",,,

Pancakes were the highlight, melt in your mouth with an incredible flavor. My friend got the egg roll omelette which was also incredible and came with potatoes and grilled cornbread. We also got a slice of apple pie which was just the icing on the cake! And the best part? This place is super affordable! I have never been so happy during and after a meal. Cannot wait to come back for more!",,,
6,Michelle X.,"New York, NY",407,150,741,4.0,6/8/2018,"This is one of my favorite lunch spits to come to in this area. I've been here multiple times and have ordered the fried chicken here more than half the times I've been here, because it is that good!The food menu here is small but still has a lot of options. The small menu allows the chef to crank out great food  consistently. Every item I've ordered here, I've enjoyed: the fried chicken, the chicken tenders, the fried, the salmon sandwich, and the coconut cream pie. I've always been curious to try other items here too but the fried chicken is always too tempting for me to turn away from. The mash potato it comes with is a great consistency also, doesn't taste like the instant mash potato junk.",3,1,2

8,Melda Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,1,1,5.0,10/27/2018,"This was the best place to get breakfast/lunch in Manhattan. Everything on the menu is SERIOUSLY SO SO GOOS. It felt like true liquid gold in my guts :) besides that, the crew is amazing and super friendly. They are the best at approaching customers and give you the ""home sweet home"" feeling. We stayed in NYC for 2 weeks and have seriously spend every morning at Yura's (whether it was take away or dine in). Above all, the prices are way too low for what you get. 2 persons can have breakfast with all kinds of sides included for just $25, whilst you'd pay the double price for the quality and amount food you get at other places.I will come back to NYC, and will sincerely visit Yura's blue plate over and over and over again. The best cornbread in town will be missed!",1,,
9,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,5.0,3/4/2018,"I mean what can I say? This place is truly a gem and one of my favorite places for a quick chill breakfast.  I found them on Yelp when I was searching for a breakfast minus the turn-up crowd to get up with a friend and chat.  They serve breakfast EVERYDAY ALL DAY and they have WiFi.  Great place to get some work done:)My favorites include their pancakes, hand rolled omelettes, and home fries.  The pancakes are light and fluffy, the omelettes are completely customizable, and their home fries are seasoned to perfection.  They have a barista on staff to make all your coffee dreams come true, and sometimes get some latte artwork. They get busy fast so I recommend arriving before noon on the weekend. Although I have seen a lot of large groups here I do not recommend  it UNLESS you have a backup.    :)",2,1,2
10,Liselle L.,"New York, NY",292,135,262,4.0,7/2/2018,"We intentionally went out looking for Love Cafe but it was closed on Sunday (oops) so we went here! Fortunately for us, there were a lot of tables open, but then again it was 8:30 AM on Sunday. This is a quaint cafe that seemed to focus mostly on eggs for breakfast, but also served options such as french toast and pancakes. My order ended up being an egg and sausage sandwich. The egg was fried just well enough to be cooked but was still runny enough, making the yolk run with every bite. I picked turkey sausage and it tasted good as well. The bun looked more like a burger bun you see in restaurants - large, fluffy, and with lots of sesame seeds. It was soft, but the egg yolk running down made the burger bun even more savory and soft. My boyfriend ended up ordering some over easy eggs, home fries, and toast. The toast was toasted well enough to be crispy but also soft on the outer edges. It even tasted great when we dipped the bread into the over easy eggs! The home fries were seasoned well with salt and pepper! Overall great meal for breakfast, brunch, or lunch! Yura's Blue Plate is a yes in my book!",2,1,1
11,Andrew H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",79,11,27,5.0,7/22/2018,"This place is one of the best values that you'll find in Manhattan. It is a hidden gem in the heart of Harlem serving great breakfast and lunch food. The food is nothing fancy, what you see is what you get. Yet it's delicious and super affordable. My wife and I got coffee, pancakes with berries, sausage, bacon, eggs and toast with a side of avocado and it was 22 dollars! The service was great and the place is super quaint. Everyone was super friendly and quick to respond to questions or requests! We may have found our new favorite spot. I definitely recommend!",1,,
12,Sonia S.,"Manhattan, NY",259,131,81,4.0,3/27/2018,"Came here on a Friday afternoon before a Target trip and it proved to be an amazing decision. The wait staff was awesome, we had 2 guys serving us and they were so attentive and nice. In terms of food I got:- grilled turkey and Swiss on rye: wasn's a huge fan on the spicy coleslaw...but that's a personal preference and my general distaste for coleslaw- mac and cheese: SO cheesy, after all it is called ""4 cheese""; i found the overpowering taste was gouda-smoky tomato soup: they haven't had it every time I've gone, but when they do it is a must. It has a very strong chipotle flavor and is so creamy. A few weeks later I cam in for brunch: - buttermilk pancakes: very solid, nothing to special but hits a sweet spot- latte: again very solid, even with almond milk it was delicious Now the real star of the show: deep dish french toast. They forewarn you that it tastes similar to flan and that's the perfect description. It is so delicious. Ive brought every member of my family and friends here and will continue to. The wait staff is always SO friendly and efficient. It's close to home and delivers an amazing experience every time.",,,
13,Michael K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,5.0,11/11/2018,This would be classified as a neighborhood gem... just mad it took me so long to come here. Came for breakfast with a quick neighborhood search for breakfast and 20 mins later we were having an awesome breakfast!Can only comment on the rolled omelette - awesome! But peeking at other plates makes us want to come back agin to try other stuff. The staff was friendly and attentive!!,,,

Updated review",Yura's is one of my top spots in East Harlem. I work in the area so I visit this place regularly. I've tried everything from their buttermilk pancakes to their fried chicken with mashed potatoes. My meals are always perfectly made. Sometimes I wish the portions were larger but I think that's just me being greedy. It can get pretty busy during lunch time but the staff tries their best to attend to everyone. Yura's Blue Plate is a must try! I promise you won't be disappointed.,1,,
15,Michiru K.,"New York, NY",105,68,104,5.0,11/27/2017,"Came here on a Monday for brunch. I ordered the deep-dish French toast (YUM!) and my friend got the rolled omelet. You get to choose 2 fillings (he got pork sausage and cheese) and it comes with a side of potatoes and cornbread.Pros:- We didn't experience a wait. We were seated immediately.- Cute Place. Exposed brick wall, rustic wood furniture, very quaint!- Inexpensive food. We ordered 2 entrees and 2 coffees, and after tax and tip, the bill was only $25- Deep-dish French Toast! Omg! It's delicious! It's basically a flan, but hey, no complaints here!- Really convenient location. It's just off the 6Cons:- There seems to be only one waiter. Not a big deal since it wasn't busy when we dropped in, but I'm wondering if it'll be an issue when it's a full house.",,,

I was so surprised by how cheap and delicious everything was!! The pancakes were fluffy, buttery and to die for. Even the lattes came with latte art which was too cute. My friend order the deep dish French toast and that was delicious,, along with the omelet. There was a little wait when we arrive because the place is tiny, but we only ended up waiting about 15 mins or so. If your in the area definitely stop by!",2,,
17,Maria M.,"Miami, FL",351,4,4,5.0,4/9/2018,"This is one of my regular brunch spots! What you see is what you get - delicious food for a great price! Staff is always attentive and if you feel differently, its such a small place all you have to do is speak up and they'll get you what you need. Food quality and flavor is consistently great! Prices are pretty low in my opinion, for NYC. I've def been to places serving similar food - without all the flavor - and much higher prices. My usual: egg white omelette w/ onions and cheddar. Plates come with corn bread and potato hash - which are both so delicious. I always add a side of avocado and get a coffee and my bill is $12ish dollars. Can't beat that in my book!",2,,
18,Dora D.,"Kirkland, WA",51,89,602,5.0,9/8/2017,"Boy, was my inner 5 year old delighted to have tried this place!Walking in, the space felt open, despite its size. The servers were friendly, which added to the warmth of the space. When I saw the menu, I knew I came to the right place for that cloudy day.I started with the Mac and Four Cheeses. It tastes just as good as mac and cheese found at some higher end spots. Delicious blend of cheeses and nice texture from the toasted onion (?) bits sprinkled on top. The consistency was also great - thick enough not to leave a soupy mess, but thin enough not to get stuck on its way to your stomach. Great pick.For dessert, I ordered the Deep Dish French Toast. This dish is very sweet, so I didn't find myself adding any syrup to it. It looks just like any other French toast. However, it crumbles on your tongue like jello, but has the same density as pudding - if you like flan, order this!The menu is small, but I'd recommend this spot for all your rainy days.",2,,1
19,Nina Z.,"San Francisco, CA",4,3,2,5.0,9/9/2018,The place is great! We've had breakfast there 3 days in a row and we plan to keep doing it until our 7 days vacations is over.,,,
20,Lily L.,"New York, NY",324,238,31,4.0,7/23/2017,"As a resident of the neighborhood for 5+ years, I welcomed Yura's Blue Plate to the neighborhood. The neighborhood doesn't really have too many places where you can really sit down for brunch. There are a few things that need tweaking, but generally I've had positive experiences here. Pros and cons, here we go!Pros: - The food is tasty, and they have a good mix of healthy and ""cheat day"" meals. You can get a Salmon Avocado BLT Sandwich that's loaded on multigrain bread, or fried chicken. - The staff is awesome. They're super friendly and helpful. - Everything in the restaurant is made in-house except for their sliced bread and their rolls. Pies, cornbread, desserts, and everything else is made on-site or in their kitchen next door (same block, but unmarked location).- The prices are fair and not exorbitant. Cons:- More of a cosmetic thing, but a lot of their dishes come with at least 2 side items. Their side item portions are pretty limited, and it can look as if they're being cheap (I think I saw another Yelp user comment about how the toast is half a slice of bread). However, most places don't even give you two sides. Usually it's one. However, I think most people prefer to see one heaping side than two small ones. - Their coffee is not super strong. I recommend getting an extra shot if you're ordering a latte or cappuccino. I feel like this is a missed opportunity so hopefully they can remedy that soon. - The location can accommodate about 25 people at max capacity, and it's not a big place, so it can get pretty loud and crowded. I haven't had to wait yet, but at the rate of its popularity, that might not be too far off in the future. All in all, I'd be interested to see how this place grows and matures in the neighborhood.",3,2,3

Updated review","Have returned since my last bad experience. Thus far the food has been GREAT. I still get the tea even though it only fills half the cup bc who could argue when it's $1.50 (plus you can always ask for more water and I've overheard servers offer more water when running low which is very nice and considerate.)The salmon BLT is AMAZING highly recommend. The French toast is...different and if you love sweets it is definitely for you, but since I hate overly sweet food it's a miss for me. The texture of the French toast is of a custard not a bread but the concept seems yummy overall. Prices are almost unfair to them LOL so you'll def eat well on a budget. Service is still a bit awkward and slow but easily overlooked with the exception of Edder who is always professional and friendly. All in all love this spot--the food couldn't be any better. I've also heard the cakes are pretty good, will try that next.",1,,

Yura's Blue Plate is such a gem! I ordered a cheddar and avocado omelette which comes with home fries & 2 pieces of corn bread (their corn bread is SO GOOD) and the deep dish french toast. The breakfast overall was delicious AF and very inexpensive! Their french toast was different - tasted like Flan so although very different than the regular french toast - it was still really good!! Also, the staff was super friendly attentive!! The servers and the cooks were really nice!! Side note: Reading some other reviews really saddened me - I didn't witness any berating or maltreatment of the staff (thankfully!) - hopefully things have changed and those incidents no longer happen!",5,,2

It came with a side of mash potatoes and cole slaw, which were portioned pretty small. The chicken pieces were rather small as well. The taste is amazing though. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in NYC so far (beating Amy Ruth's), and the sides were great. I wanted more! I had room for key lime pie and it was FANTASTIC. Not too sweet, not too sour. Our waiter was great as well. I will be back to try something else even though the portions were small for the fried chicken plate.",2,,
30,Lynn L.,"Manhattan, NY",82,153,75,5.0,9/2/2017,"Today was the first time we came here. We have lived in the neighborhood for 6+ years. We ordered:1. Buttermilk fried Chicken with mash mash potatoes and coleslaw 2. Tuna salad sandwich with roasted tomatoes and cranberry juice. 3. Grilled chicken Breast Panini I don't really know why we never came to this place for lunch or brunch. The menu is pretty simple and yet with a range of wonderful choices. What particularly struck us was the price. The prices are exactly what they should be for those items. I'm sure i'm not alone in experiencing brunch and being sorta shocked by the menu, convincing yourself that it's going to be fantastic, which justifies the outrageous prices. Sometimes it is, sometimes its not. Yura's Blue Plate prices are super fair! The fried chicken was smaller than what i had in mind (mini-drumstick), but the flavor was very good (there were also 3 pieces, so pretty good portion), chicken skin was crispy and the meat was tender, juicy and fresh. Tuna salad sandwich was delicious (according to my husband) and my mother in law finished the panini and complimented the fresh pesto. Great experience, GLAD we came, GLAD y'all are here in East Harlem! We appreciate you!",1,,1

The omelette was cooked well and the turkey sausage had great flavor. The avocado was ripe and was a decent portion and the corn bread was freakin' delicious!Add to the fact that all of the staff were super friendly and had no issue with me subbing out the potatoes and it was an A+ lunch.

I also split the Deep Dish French Toast (&6.50) with my friend and honestly I would totally go back for that solely.

But we have been looking for a no-fuss, simple breakfast place in the area, and I thought we should at least give it a try. I don't regret trying this place, but it was an eye-opening experience for sure. I must agree with the several other Yelpers who witnessed the guy who seemed to be the owner belittle his (lovely) employees right in front of us. Yes, thanks to the cooks and service staff, the food was delicious, and the service is excellent, but my SO and I were both uncomfortable to see how the (white) owner is incredibly condescending and nasty to his staff -- in plain view, no less! The owner's behavior was so offensive that I felt complicit in institutional racism watching this nasty white guy yell at his hourly employees who were all POC and behaving with the utmost professionalism despite his abuse. We don't feel comfortable supporting a business that doesn't treat their staff with respect. I have worked as a server, and it was shocking to see this person humiliate his workers right in front of us. If he is this bad in front of individuals whose money he wants, I don't want to imagine how he is when nobody is looking.",16,,2

Two beers (PERONI) a burger, grilled cheese, and two mac and cheese. This was shared between me and my boyfriend. When we arrived the food came right out! It was delicious. Now this place is normally a brunch and breakfast place and I could not for the life of me figure out why she wanted to go here for dinner, but with the excellent service and tasty food it was worth the trip. The server although way past his out time was very patient. He even offered us dessert after we have finished our meal! Top notch service. I would return her and bring friends because they were so hospitable. Thank you for the wonderful atmosphere, service, and delicious food.",3,,

This place is insanely cheap in price. I ordered the everyday eggs over easy with some avocado and bacon and it came with some home fries that was amazingly delicious.

The food here is pretty good 4/5 I'd give it. But what frustrates me the most about this establishment  is not only the over priced food items, but the lack of attentiveness among the staff. On everything I love, the last 3-4 orders I've placed here has been in some sort misconstrued. I received onions instead of mushrooms in one instance, on another occasion I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese with black pepper and instead received received scrambled eggs that were plain and dry as a cracker. If you're going to over charge food items, get the order correct the first time. That's all I'm saying ‍",,,

I got the omelette and a glass of champagne. The omelette was on of the lightest, fluffiest omelettes I've ever had! It has plenty of filling without being too much. Potatoes were small chopped instead of big chunks (which I like) and had good flavor. The kicker was the cornbread! They throw it on the griddle so it gets a light crunch to it. It was soooo good!!! All for $6.50! I was full halfway through my meal but it was so good I ate it all until I was miserable (in a good way)!I'll def be back to try one of their specials!

We are back for our second breakfast today. It was that good. An omelette with two toppings, corn bread and the tastiest home fries for $6.50 simply cannot be beat. My husband had the egg sandwich on an egg roll with tomatoes, cheese and turkey sausage was incredible. We shared a side of the Mac and cheese (recommended from prior reviews) was one of the best I've ever had. This is one of my special dishes so this accolade does not come often. The employees were gracious and friendly. The ambiance is warm and inviting. Seriously folks, if I lived here I'd be here almost every day. Come on over and check this place out.

79,Sadia Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,1,1.0,2/25/2017,"The Worst experience I've ever had! The owner (probably his son who operates the place) is an emotionally unstable and aggressive man with a Horrible attitude!!! I've read many comments being him being rude to staff and yelling at them in front of a guest but doing it to a Customer??? This is Unacceptable. First and Last time there and here's our convo with him (Michael) went:-Hi, could you pls check on our order, it's been about 30 min"" - I said nicely and with a smile-Seriously? 30 min? - in a very sarcastic way and he went to check. Comes back ""it was put in only 7 min ago. And you're saying 30. We both know It's a big difference, right?"" -well, I had a phone call right after I ordered 25 min ago (showing it to him) seems like it. -and you ordered right away? Let's be honest here, it's been 7 min and you should know that... At this point I thought I was done with him and I just nodded but he was keep on going lecturing me and being really sarcastic in a bad way for like another 4 min while I was silent. After we got our order, my mood was ruined and when he was next to me I said:-you know the way you handled the situation wasn't nice. I myself work in the restaurant and this is just not a way to treat customersAnd he just started Harassing me!! That I don't get his jokes and I am the Only one in his life who unable to do so and it's not his problem. Literally, that's what he said. He was Yelling at Me. I'm like ""I don't care about waiting for food, I'm saying you should watch your attitude"" and he was keep on arguing and yelling at me until I decided to leave...Advice: AVOID.

81,Randi W.,"New York, NY",38,16,0,5.0,11/4/2017,"FOOD, SERVICE, AND AMBIENCE OUTSTANDING!!!  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  There is always something great to be had there.  Always something different in terms of specials, and I've never had anything that wasn't good.  Breakfast is outstanding with great omelets that are served with a side of cornbread, deep dish french toast that is more like a sensational bread pudding, and daily specials.  They frequently have a salmon special, a chicken picnic sandwich, and heavenly pies.  All meals are priced and portioned right and super fresh.  Meals are NOT huge but are also not expensive.      Idowu, who is a manager (I think, if not he should be one) has an awesome smile and always makes me (and the other customers too) feel important.  Keep up the good work.  My only suggestion would be to add fresh brewed ice tea to the menu.  Currently they do not serve ice tea in any form.",,,
82,Tjade G.,"Grapevine, TX",0,4,1,2.0,6/16/2018,"We went for breakfast. The food was absolutely mediocre, and the menu was basic to begin with. We went because my husband wanted French toast. DON'T GET THE FRENCH TOAST! It's not French toast, it's French goop. The consistency was similar to creme brûlée. He hated it. It also comes a la carte (with no sides) for a super high price. I got an omelette because their menu was so boring and small. Although the food sucked and was not worth the price, that wasn't the worst part. When we walked in, we sat at a four-top table because the guy said to sit anywhere we want. Then my husband and I sat down on the same side of the table, and the server came up to us and said we had to sit facing each other. He said that if they got busy that he would have to pull the tables apart. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!?!? DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME THAT YOU ARE MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING MONEY THAN MAKING ME HAPPY AT YOUR RESTAURANT. The server literally said something like, 'sorry I have to make money guys'. My husband and I have a ritual at restaurants to sit next to each other instead of across from each other. AND YOU RUINED THAT FOR US! I wonder if we would have actually enjoyed our time there besides the French toast had you not pissed us off so greatly when we walked in. THATS WHY I ONLY LEFT YOU THREE DOLLAR TIP! If that is the way you guys run things there, you don't deserve our business. Good luckBtw IT NEVER GOT BUSY WHILE WE WERE THERE. ONE MORE TABLE SHOWED UP AND THAT'S IT. Maybe it's because it was 9am in the morning and there was no need to police the seating arrangements. Who knows. Maybe it's because this place isn't that great.",,,

Came here with my boyfriend in the morning and it wasn't too packed. There was only one server and one cook. We ordered our food and it came out in average time. The food itself was pretty decent. I got the everyday eggs made sunny side up. They made them perfectly. It came with a delicious piece of buttered toast which was a little small and some potatoes. The potatoes were seasoned nicely. My boyfriend got the omelet with cornbread and potatoes. It all looked delicious. We also shared the french toast at the end. It is very different from what you would normally expect french toast to be like since it's a little more like a pudding consistency. It was delicious nonetheless.,3,2,2

I tell my date that I want to leave ... on the way out the door the tall waiter tells me to have a good day as if I didn't see and hear him talk crap about us. Sometimes humans make me sick.

The food is AMAZING, and the prices are way lower than typical NYC prices. We could have breakfast for two with coffee for less than $25. We are bartop sitters, and the girl who usually helped us was so amazing, remembered our order, and always made pleasant conversation. However, like many other reviewers have stated the GM or owner, whoever he is, had a tendency to make the stay unpleasant for us. At first he would repeatedly ask us if we wanted dessert when we asked for the check (which, no, I don't think I need pie after a plate of pancakes at noon thank you.) And he spent so much of his time belittling the employees for everything. It almost seemed like he was trying to make them look bad to make himself look better? It was very strange. One of the servers even remarked at one point that ""its like he thinks I don't need this job."" referring to the fact that customers might tip her less based on his bullying remarks. Whenever he wasn't around, this place was 5 stars and we would stay and chat and have another cup of coffee. When he was, we ate our food and practically ran.",2,,

Its a tight squeeze. Always packed (but thats a good sign). Full menu options but not many for vegan/vegetarians.

104,Megan M.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",284,66,5,2.0,8/7/2016,"The food here is great, however I have been there 3 times and watched the manager berate and belittle his employees in front of the customers. During my first visit, he interrupted the waiter while he was taking our order by screaming ""Red Flag! Red Flag! Now what are you supposed to say if they order the French toast?!?!"" His tone was rude and infantilizing and put us as customers in a very uncomfortable situation.  This time, I was sitting 2 ft away from him as he yelled at a waitress for running a card instead of refilling coffees. When she tried to explain herself, he cut her off saying ""I don't care- do your job."" Not okay to have these conversations in the restaurant in front of customers. He also made the coffee bar lady re-pour glasses of water that weren't done to his exact specifications. Someone came in asking if they could leave some fliers for a fundraiser for children's cancer research and he wouldn't give them the time of day. Way to connect with the community. Also I waited over 20 minutes sitting at the bar for a couple of to-go breakfast sandwiches. Nobody offered me a glass of water, coffee or anything while I was waiting. I will not support a business that treats its staff like dirt. Sorry Yuras- you lost my patronage.",15,,
105,Joseph M.,"Santa Monica, CA",37,11,1,3.0,8/7/2016,"The food here is great and very reasonably priced! I would be giving this place 5 stars except the owner/manager treats his staff so terribly that it almost ruined the whole experience. He was yelling at his wait staff right in front of our table for minor mistakes after already asking for our patience because the waiter was brand new. We were not concerned about the waiter not telling us the specials but we did feel very uncomfortable when we were suddenly forced to watch him get yelled at by the owner/manager. Again, the food is really good. I'd be return much more frequently if I were not afraid I would be subject to another incident where the manager goes off on his staff in front of customers.",10,,
106,Corey A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,1,1.0,9/4/2017,"My boyfriend and I walked in and asked the cashier how long the wait to sit was. She promptly pointed to an empty table and told us to sit there. A few minutes later another employee walked up and told us that other people had actually been waiting for this table and we would have to get up and wait outside on the sidewalk. It would have been nice if the staff here were not completely incompetent and could work effectively together, instead of giving false promises and empty stomachs.Xoxo",,,

I usually have my breakfast, coffee, get some emails done, and have a casually pleasant morning with the staff. They all seem like great human beings. Recommend the frech toast and the mushroom burger. Best on weekday if you want to feel the vibes I described :)",,,
108,John S.,"Lutz, FL",35,26,55,5.0,6/30/2017,"I have to say this place was a great restaurant.  Good food and the service was top notch.  My kids had the fried chicken which I tasted and was phenomenal.  I had the omelette with mushrooms, ham, cheddar and onions.  Truly amazing!  The sides were mashed potatoes and toasted cornbread.  Wow!  I will come back.  I read some of the reviews and was hoping to see some drama  that happened in the past but did not see none.",,,
109,Adri H.,"Bronx, NY",0,14,0,1.0,2/11/2018,"First the deep dish French toast isn't explained that it's more like bread pudding texture than French toast, a texture I do not enjoy. If the French toast would of been described like that on the menu I would not have ordered it. Second, the French toast came out so hot it really burned my tongue to the point that it was hurting, no warning that it was burning hot, how would I know?  French toast isn't usually super hot to begin with. Scrambled eggs were not good. Will not be coming back. The lack of explanation on the menu and the lack of warning of the extremely hot food item that BURNED my tongue is enough for me not to return.",,,
110,Lauren C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,10,4.0,1/30/2017,Yummy yummy French toast! Didn't love the home fries though. The service is great and food came out quick! The restaurant is clean and super cute!,,,

Anyway, my only complaint is one of the woman who work there with blond hair, when ever she's there the service is really slow. Her lattes suck, her attitude sucks, customer service sucks. Other then that I haven't tried the food but it looks yummy, maybe one day I will.",1,,
114,Linda F.,"Bayside, NY",1,13,0,3.0,3/10/2017,"I love the food and I eat here often, but the service is inconsistent. Most servers are competent and friendly,  but there is one particular server who rubbed me the wrong way.  I paid my bill and was ready to go. My friend was waiting for her charge.  She politely asked for her change and the woman behind the counter told her to, ""Chill!"" My friend went to the bathroom and I heard the women say, ""Don't rush me.  Who does she think she is?"" We are regular customers, but after that experience I haven't been back.  It is a shame because the food is amazing.",2,,

116,Ollie G.,"Two Bridges, Manhattan, NY",27,23,9,5.0,11/10/2016,Awesome spot. Fantastic food for the price. Grilled cheese with bacon all the way.  The burger is also a steal for 10$. Don't expect fast service. Sit at the counter for the best service. It's also pretty funny to see Michael the manager get pissed off at the employees. That's life hahaha!,,,
117,Devin O.,"Brookfield, WI",0,55,12,5.0,5/18/2017,Food was fantastic - the rolled omelet cheese had amazing depth. Smashed fries and cornbread are no joke. Turkey sausage is juicy - hard to do.,,,
118,Lissette G.,"Jupiter, FL",0,4,0,5.0,6/11/2017,"I was born and raised in this neighborhood in the 70s. Moved out of NYC almost 23 years ago. However, this area has always brought me memories of amazing food experiences so my expectations were high. I was headed back to the airport and needed something special for the last food experience of this trip. I totally got it!  Great vibe, nice decor and the best French toast I've ever had. We also asked for a special order of over easy eggs, spinach, avocado and toast, and it was perfectly cooked. Coffee was great too! The food was more than worth what we paid. Cost was so reasonable for the both of us. Thanks Yura for investing in my old neighborhood!",,,

120,Salina S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",79,29,2,1.0,3/25/2016,I hate to do this but I am l:Initially when this adorable cafe opened no one knew about it as it was new. Hard workers however now that the pace has picked up they have forgotten about the essentials which is customer service. No matter what business you are in customer service is key. I have patiently been waiting for 15 min to be attended to while customers that have showed up well after me are near done eating. The love cafe around the corner  has managed to consistently attend their large volumes of customers with amazing service. The food is great but I can live without the bad service. Back to love cafe I go.  Props to the male server for realizing I was there. This place would be better off without Michael working there seems as if he is causing customers to never return.,7,2,1

126,Sarah A.,"Manhattan, NY",6,7,0,3.0,5/25/2016,"This place is a solid three stars. Good, cheap, quick breakfast. A great new spot in East Harlem. The hashbrowns are a little salty, but not a big deal - just mix them with your eggs or a side of greens and you're good to go. (The coffee is terrible; just fyi.)It's right by Costco, so it's easy to have breakfast and then head to get some shopping done.",,,
127,Alan B.,"New York, NY",2,3,1,5.0,2/19/2017,This place is a little treasure hidden in Harlem. We were so happy to find this restaurant and get some delicious brunch. The atmosphere is wonderful and the service was quick and friendly! Yay!,,,

About 5 minutes in, I assume the owner asks the waitress ""What's he doing?""(pointing to me sitting at the table, drinking coffee).  I promptly paid my bill and left a minute later.",4,2,
129,Serenity G.,"Manhattan, NY",13,2,0,3.0,9/17/2017,"It's really nice to have a place like this open in East Harlem, the food is decent and the prices are low. I was really hoping to make it a regular brunch spot, but unfortunately the service is disappointing. I asked for water as soon as I was sitted (and several times thereafter), but I didn't receive anything to drink until after I finished eating. The servers don't check it in to make sure everything is going well either. I've been to the restaurant twice and both times the service was crappy.",,,

131,Gabrielle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,9,11,3.0,8/28/2016,"So first things first, I agree with all the reviewers and say the manager is rude to his employees. I really don't like seeing that happen, especially when people rely on these jobs to help their families. The food was great; I had the deep dish french toast, which was fantastic as it tasted like flan. Someone needs to teach this manager some respect and courtesy, because, as a first time customer, when I walked in and asked if and where the bathroom was, he was sarcastic to me. My waitress was fantastic though, and very courteous to my friend and I.",4,,

134,Juliet H.,"South Orange, NJ",65,82,26,4.0,12/11/2016,"I'm a big fan of this place for whenever we wake up too early for brunch and just want a simple breakfast. I like that they keep everything simple and the pancakes, eggs, sauasage and everything is very tasty.  I wasn't a big fan of the french toast but I was told ahead of time it's not a typical french toast (weird pudding texture). The waitstaff are all really nice and accomodating and the food usually comes out fast. We have been a few times when they were understaffed and had to wait but it seemed like they just needed some more people.",,,

The inside is so cute and clean. We all tried the best pancakes I have tried EVER!, the French Toast was stuffed with vanilla flan and was out of this world delicious, the house potatoes and grilled corn bread spectacular! The coffee was strong and freshly made. Mimosas were perfect and only $4.50 a steal! I'll definitely make this my brunch place every time I'm back in NYC.",,,
136,Eva S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,1,5.0,10/29/2016,"Stopped by here for an impromptu breakfast with a friend. I was low on cash but didn't want to rain on his, ""I need some breakfast""parade. I readied myself to just have some coffee, and maybe a piece of toast...but then I saw the menu! So affordable! And the plates hitting the tables all around us...they smelled amazing! They looked great! And our server was so friendly. Everyone who was working was really friendly, actually. My friend had a stack of pancakes with bacon and eggs, and he reported them delicious. I had a poor gal's breakfast of butter and jam on toast, some potatoes, and their roasted tomatoes (OMG) and endless coffee, and ate like a king for about $10. CANNOT recommend them enough, what a welcome addition to the neighborhood!",,,

Also, I would like everyone to know the reviews that speak of bad service must have been addressed because the waiters were extremely friendly and quick with service. The restaurant is set up so the grill can be viewed by everyone, which always makes me feel more comfortable because you know they are cleanly.  The food was amazing as well. I tried the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich that had more flavor than any breakfast sandwich I have ever had. My boyfriend tried the deep dish French toast, that was sort of like bread pudding served warm with a cup of syrup on the side. Both dishes were amazing, I will definitely be going back soon!",1,,

Every single thing on the menu is home made and very very good - not surprising as they have other locations and a thriving catering business. We had soup, mains and even dessert - all were amazing.
