We had a lovely table by the window and chatted the night away.He got the lamb chops, which I tried and were delicious. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. If you want to be transported to France for a few hours, this is the spot to go.",,1,2
1,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",276,412,694,3.0,10/26/2018,"Four girls came to La Sirene for a birthday celebration and really to catch up on life. La Sirene is a French restaurant tucked super west and it was a super friendly staff that walked us through the menu and allowed us to chat the night away. I really came fro the pan fried foiegras which they did not have on the menu that night which made me super sad. Comparing it to the ultimate French menu that I absolutely love and miss from Paris, there were certain things that hit the spot for me which includes the escargot and French onion soup. Escargot garlic and olive oil was best paired with the bread! I wasn't a fan of the steak tartare in terms of the flavor pairing, the chicken was a little dry for my taste, gnocchi was super cheesy which wasn't a bad thing, and the steak was just on par. I would probably still return to have the pan fried foiegras when it comes back on the menu to give the restaurant another shot! The restaurant accepts cash or Amex only (because Amex helped the owner thrive and allowed him to create his business with no credit when relocating the America). This concept was beautiful and made us understand the story, great share!",1,,

3,Richard M.,"Stamford, CT",13,48,5,5.0,11/10/2018,"This place is absolutely wonderful! We started with the mussels. The sauce was quite light and although quite delicious,I thought it could have used a bit more garlic and butter. For main, the tenderloin with foie gras was fantastic. I can't wait to go back just for that. Finally we finished-off with the profiterole's and banana Bruleé... both wonderful! The ambiance is very warm and the service was very attentive/friendly. An added bonus is that they are BYOB all nights except Friday-Sunday. Highly recommended!",,,
4,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",408,733,596,4.0,8/17/2018,"Good French bistro food.Came here for restaurant week. I ordered the Paté de Campagne and the gnocchi with truffle cheese.The Paté was very good. It was clearly fresh. The flavors were not too irony. The texture was smooth but still robust enough to stick well to the baguette. The accompanying pearl onions and pickles did well to balance the savor of the Paté with a sweet and tangy flavor profile.I should not have ordered the truffle gnocchi. It's really not a French dish. There was no protein. It just wasn't well balanced. For what it was, gnocchi in cheese sauce, it was ok. The bechamel was a bit gritty/broken but still had a nice dairy flavor. The truffle flavor was generic truffle oil, which is to be expected in this setting. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't incredible. I'd like to try one of their more traditional French dishes.Overall I enjoyed this lunch. The service was excellent and the food was pretty good.",2,,2

6,Brian P.,"New York, NY",63,105,292,5.0,5/6/2018,"This place is a small gem. The restaurant is a small converted hole in the wall that is now serving some of the best French food I've had. To start the appetizers who all great. We ordered the mussels, ravioli, and escargot. The escargot has a great flavor, buttery as delicious. The mussels we ordered the creole style which is filled with chorizo and light cream. My favorite was ravioli which has truffle shaved on top. The portion is small, but the flavor profile is massive. For my entree I got the filet with foie gras, cooked medium rare. Wow, this was so tender. The combination of the fillet, foie gras, and sauce was a bite from heaven. Dessert, Big Profiteroles. I was thoroughly surprised on how much I enjoyed this. Light cream with chocolate in a pastry? So good. It's AMEX and cash only, so make sure you have those on hand. It's commendable of the chef to only accept Amex as they were the only ones to help him build up his credit when he was just starting out in America. Will definitely be back!",,,1
7,Mikhail V.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",36,356,244,4.0,8/17/2018,Came here for a little get together from work.Ordered practically every item on the menu since there were so many of us and noone left disappointed.  To be quite honest the bistro is very similar to those I've visited in France.  it definitely follows the authentic recipes and presentation.  The wine list is very well picked.  Not particularly large but nicely represented Bordeaux and knowledgeable staff to help with the pairing.  The place though feels a bit cramped when seating such a large group of people (15 of us were there) I would think a slightly larger space would be good.  But if you're a party of 2 or 4 it will feel nice and very cozy.,,,

The sauce is so freaking amazing that I dipped my bread in it and savored it for a good five mins. The octopus was okay, too soft for my liking. Pork tenderloin and hangar steak were both delicious!

I've walked passed here and didn't notice before...But was just explained they usually dont open for lunch and only during Restaurant Week they're open for lunch.  Around 5:20pm...Empty..But by 6:25pm a good amount of the space was already filled with people...6:45pm..Almost full house..The atmosphere is dim and dark, great for romantic dates. :) And when they start cooking...The creamy sauce will intoxicate you in the air...Even as you leave the restaurant...The menu provided was one of the most personable one I've ever had the pleasure of reading; it bares the soul of the owner, it has character! :) Makes you feel like someone you know opened the place...He really used that first intro page of the menu lolSampled from the restaurant week menu...I was seated, and provided with half a loaf of bread with olive oil after my order was placed.Their ravioli was highly recommended! It was fantastic!! The portion might seem super small but the taste is beyond it's size.The raviolis are super tinny, like the size of a piece of rectangular gum, surrounded in this light but very creamy sauce. And then the ravioli just kicks you in the mouth with its awesome flavor! The dish let's you tastes all the individual flavors and how they co-mingle, I loved it.The hanger steak cooked with garlic, lightly seasoned but perfectly paired to mingle with the four veggies...The flavor on the steak is light so those that love salt...You may want to add more. But you'll apparacite the quality of the meat, it didn't have me struggle like pieces of jerky with some bites in other restaurants.The dessert was a mix of the two different cream puffs:  caramel vs dark.chocolate. They were nice enough to let me mix one of each for dessert.Cream puff with vanilla cream filling, hardened caramel topped with powdered sugar... The hardened caramel on top had a hard candy feel that gave it a crunch with every bite.The dark chocolate one, had ice cream for filling and this pairs well with the whipped cream and mint. However, not my favorite...The pastry part of this one felt off.... I'd recommend the other one.And they gave the check with a lollypop lol..That's cute hahaha (watermelon flavor )FYI:*Amex and cash only was said soon as I walked in. *They actually have a wall space next to the hostess to hang your coats.*They check on you and explains the dish rather quickly but tells you everything about it. So listen carefully or ask for a repeat lolCon: If you come early when they first open, they're prepping the onions for the soup; because they have an open kitchen...Your eyes will get very sensitive like mine and tears may emerge besides the stinging discomfort.Side note:I don't know if there's a full moon tonight or cause this place is so close to Chinatown...This place became packed with Asians... Like more than half the restaurant...Felt abit weird for me...",3,1,1
10,Cathy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",151,52,0,3.0,10/2/2018,"Personally not my favorite French restaurant in New York. I usually judge based on how the escargot, which is probably not the best factor. The escargot was very plain and bland. We had the escargot, ravioli, rabbit, and the tournedos rossini. The ravioli and the filet mignon was really good. Ravioli was delicious and the truffle flavor definitely came through. The filet mignon topped with foie gras seems overly decadent but the flavors are just amazing. Definitely the entrée to get and their most popular dish for a reason. The rabbit was unmemorable. This was a solid meal but with the number of amazing French restaurants in the city, I just don't think I would be returning.",,,

I don't think I would've been filled with just the duck). What was outstanding for me were the ""ravioles de royan au comte,"" tiny ravioli in a cream garlic truffle sauce. I wish they had them as an entree and not just an appetizer. The onion soup was ok, not remarkable or memorable.

I can't resist.  The filet was perfectly medium rare and the added foie gras on top basically made my eyes roll back.  I usually don't prefer filet mignon, but this one was so flavorful and nicely seasoned on the outside.  That foie gras though...For dessert, we got the ""banana pudding"" which was like a banana creme brulee.  Nice take on banana pudding... they even put a candle in it for me!I'm usually skeptical of French cuisine given I've had some pretty mediocre French food, but La Sirene definitely takes the top spot.  I will be back for that filet/foie combo.",13,3,10

When we came in though, the restaurant was less than half full.We were immediately brought copies of the menu and decided on what to order soon after. We decided to have the goats' cheese tartlet, Tournedos Rossini, and cassoulet. My boyfriend and I shared the goats' cheese tartlet, which was served to us not long after we'd ordered. The tartlet was crisp, warm and delicious. However, our main courses were less appetizing. There was nothing wrong with the tournedos Rossini, but it lacked that wow factor. My boyfriend felt the same about the cassoulet. The cassoulet had been described on the menu as an extremely rich and heavy dish, but he said it tasted extremely bland for what the dish actually was supposed to be.

The mini Ravioli filled with conte cheese in a truffle sauce was delicious.The gnocchi (French Mac 'n cheese) was tasty, although the pasta was a bit too soft (better if it had been al dente)The 2010 Medoc red wine was a great pairing for our meal.Overall: Good food, fairly priced and nice service",1,,

The duck breast was cooked well and tasted good. The potato sides were also fine. Both desserts weren't good. Apple terrine was too tart and the scoop of ice cream wasnt helping. The dough that was on the bottom was hard and didn't taste good. The profiteroles were just terrible, mostly because of the added chocolate that tasted burnt? unsweetened? Not sure but it was all I could taste and it was bad. (The ice cream inside was fine).Also, the vegetarian options were somewhat limited.

These tiny squares of pasta are delicious. The truffle flavor comes through intensely. I chose the quail for my main. This magnificent dish combines two of my favorite things, fowl and cooked fruit. The skin is crispy and the meat is rich. The apples taste dark and sweet. While the sauce may appear overpowering, it is quite mild. There are some bones in the quail. The tart tatin flambé is dramatic, as it is engulfed in blue flames. Not every drop of the cognac cooks off, so the dessert tastes a tad boozy.The Kwak Belgian ale makes a nice accompaniment to the meal, malty with notes of fruit.",1,1,1
24,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",413,306,542,4.0,3/28/2018,"Intimate little French restaurant in Soho that's been a neighborhood staple for years. I first came here in 2011 and had one of the best meals in my life at the time (low bar as I was a poor student), but my recent dinner here reaffirmed that memory.Easily secured day-of dinner reservations for 3 at 7PM. The restaurant was near empty when we were first seated, but filled up through the course of the meal. Started off the meal with a bowl of French onion soup and escargot - both delicious and super rich. I desperately wanted to pour the garlic pesto oil from the escargot into my mouth, but decided using the complimentary bread to soak it up was a more civilized choice. For mains, the three of us split the Cornish hen, filet with foie gras, and roasted rack of lamb. These came with two giant plates of vegetables (mostly squashes prepared in various ways) - definitely overordered, but we gladly finished every bite. My favorites were the Cornish hen, which came on top of a rich stuffing, followed by the filet which was almost too decadent with that amazing foie, and then the rack of lamb.No dinner is complete without dessert, and for that we split another three things - the croquemboche (fine, but nothing special), strawberry tart (enormous and delicious, 100% get this), and sorbets (coconut and mango).This was all paired with a very reasonably priced bottle of red wine that the waiter picked out for us, but I understand that they also do BYOB during the week.Service was not as attentive as I would've liked, but there were only two people serving the entire restaurant so they were understandably busy. Things got noticeably better once the restaurant cleared out a little later.Total for everything, including tax and tip, rang in at under $100PP. Definitely a bargain!",1,,
25,Mel T.,"New York, NY",415,1213,2873,3.0,8/5/2017,"**Restaurant Week Summer 2017 Review**My sister and I made a reservation through Open Table the day before and there were plenty of times available. We came in at 7 on a Wednesday and one of their dining rooms was full. And when I say full, I mean cramped, as in we were pretty much sitting elbow to elbow with strangers. It wasn't until I went to go use the restroom did I discover another dining room, which was almost empty. I guess they did that to make it seem more poppin than it actually was.To start, I had the Pate de Campagne Maison (served with cornichons, dijon, and pearl onions). My sister had the Ravioles de Royan (stuffed comte cheese and garlic little tiny raviolis with cream and truffles). The pate had too much of some type of seasoning - couldn't quite put my finger on what it Waals, but the pearl onions and side salad it came with definitely helped balance it out a bit. On the other hand, the ravioli was amazing. They even had whole pieces of truffle in it. The portion size would was perfect for an appetizer because anymore, and it would have been overkill.For the main, I had the Steak Tartare with Toasted Pugliese Bread, and she had the Pan-Seared Hangar Steak. I enjoyed my steak tartare but after finished about a third of it, it was a little much. I think this would have been better in a smaller portion, as an appetizer instead. The hangar steak was chewy but the flavor was excellent, as they cooked it in a generous amount of fresh garlic.For dessert, I had the scoop of Cranberry Sorbet. It was nice and refreshing after a heavy meal like this. I was only able to eat about half though because it was pretty tart. My sis had the Banana Brûlée (french vanilla custard with fresh sliced bananas and smashed graham crackers), which she loved.Not sure I'd be back, as I'm not a fan of cramped restaurants and I only thought the food was better than okay, and not great.  Tip - a glass of their house Bordeaux was $9, which wasn't bad at all, for its quality.",4,,

27,Tim E.,"Plainfield, NJ",1,15,167,5.0,2/11/2018,"Intimate spot, plenty of table-for-two's, quiet ambiance. They are BYOB Sun-Thurs, a great option if you prefer to avoid the mark-ups other restaurants offer. The menu was pretty quintessential with a staple of options to try. We went ambitious, heavy on appetizers and just one main course to finish up. For starters, brought in pairs, the Poires rôties au Bleu Fondant (roasted pear topped with crisped Bleu Cheese), accompanied by Steak tartare. The pears were delectable, and balanced. Topped with balsamic, and bleu cheese of all things, who'd have thought, but the French of course, such a complex formula to result in something so enjoyable! For me, a big star in the sea of plates to come. The steak tartare, i'm not as experienced with, but felt it was a solid choice overall. It was a bit intense on the onion side of things with a few large chunks, but the beef was extremely soft and mild. A few more pieces of toast would have been appreciated. Then onto the Escargots à la Bourguignonne and Seared Foie Gras with Balsamic Duck Glaze. No surprise, the escargot were on point, and uniquely served from the shell. Honestly, not much to say there, i've never had a bad order anywhere... butter... garlic... perfect. Foie Gras seared is my favorite way to have it. Came as 4 slivers in a pool of Balsamic glaze, which for me was ok. Spread over toasted bread, was delicious. I didn't go heavy on the glaze as I didn't think it was necessary nor did it add much overall. Finally, the main course of Carré d'Agneau au jus de truffles, or Rack of Lamb w/ rosemary and truffle. Recommended medium cook but came out medium-rare anyway... and was phenomenal. Highly recommended, so tender, melty, and delicately flavored as I come to expect with French preparation. Only knock is that the portion was quite small, just 4 tiny portions... totally craving more! Also just a touch lukewarm, but didn't take away from the experience. This was the highlight of the night, with the Pear, a surprising runner up. Finishing off with a 6th course was the Croquembouche au Caramel, puff pastry. The crisp caramel coating really elevated what can sometimes be a mushy/soggy experience. It was great, but i suspect from that experience that any choice would have been excellent. I've probably gone too long now. To wrap it up, defn hoping to go back and try their Linguine aux fruits de mer, and Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison. As i'm from NJ, wanting to revisit says a lot considering the endless options in the city!",2,,

Only reason I docked a star was because the filet mignon had too much sauce poured on top and the foie gras + filet mignon + truffle combination sounds like a good idea on paper but actually is just very overwhelming. Worth a try though!,,,
33,So Young K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,7,5.0,8/5/2018,"For the 2018 summer NYC restaurant week, La Sirene opened the door of my first french cuisine experience. The atmosphere of La Sirene was very warm, cozy but cool, little bit of thrill because it's the first time in forever. The servers were very nice, kind, took care a lot of things while I had dinner.Let me talk about the food even though I'm not a food columnist. I started with wine. I ordered two glass of house something and 100% melbec(?) -again, I'm not a wine columnist. Amazing.Second was escargot. OMG. Where can you find this taste in the world? (In france). So far, this is the #1 escargot dish in my life. ( I cannot compare with others cuz there is no other) it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Third, the main. Hanger steak and hen dish. You will easily find on the NYC restaurant week menu. Another world of the steak and chicken cooking. What did I eat before for steak and chicken? Korean BBQ and fried chicken? Yes, still I can give up that heritage, but it was melted in my mouth. (Can't believe it? Try it)Finale, desserts! Did you know that your stomach have another space for dessert? I found it today. I had banana brûlée, cranberry sorbet. Perfect ending. Forgot to tell you this. When you try a french restaurant, please try the french onion soup. I forgot to take picture of it but, that comforted me and welcome me so warmly. See y'all!!",,,
34,Xinyu L.,"San Francisco, CA",112,177,846,5.0,8/7/2017,"Great value during the NYC Restaurant Week! For the appetizer, we ordered the French onion soup (very heavy) and homemade pare de campagne. Since the escargot is their signitue dish, we also add that to our meal. The butter and garlic sauce is very delicious. Feel free to ask for more bread to dip with it!For the entree, we had the seared pork tenderloin with cranberry sauce. The French way of this pork is very tender and juicy! We also selected the steak tartare, which is grind marinated Raw Beef! Huge portion! Certainly a dish not for everyone, but definitely worth a try. For the dessert, since we had four people, we decided to try them all - Banana brûlée, croquants caramel, profiteroles, and coconut ice cream. Their desserts are the best among several restaurant week restaurants I went so far! Highly recommended!",,,

I did make a reservation and didn't see the warning although  it is possible that I missed it.,,,

The pork and the hanger steak were divine all served with vegetables cooked as they should be with butter but not heavy and crisp unless pureed.  You should eat here, too.   A small place where you can get the bistro menu or fondue on the taureau side of the house which I need to try my next time in town!",,,

It was so flavorful.For main, I got pork tenderloin with cranberry sauce while my husband had seared chicken breast. My husband was quite happy with his choice. I thought at first my choice was dicy since I was not sure how cranberry sauce would turn out. (I don't like the one in thanksgiving.) I was glad I chose pork because it was so tasty. Pork was tender, the sauce was slightly sweet and paired well with the meat. And the vegetables! They gave us some veggies as sides, which seemed cooked simply, yet all had good flavor. Delicious! Finishing our meal with Ameicano and espresso w/ cognac, we felt so glad we came to this restaurant. All in all, food was great, and service was prompt.

We both had the peach cobbler for dessert. We ordered a side of escargots as well. Comes in the shell. So delicious- very herby and garlicky. Don't forget to come with cash or your Amex card.

40,Gong L.,"Manhattan, NY",67,5,17,3.0,10/30/2017,"The thing about this place is that they serve REALLY GOOD steak, including filet mignon with foie gras and truffle slices on the top - incredibly flavorful and deluxe taste.  The hanger steak was also juicy, fired garlic on top also add texture and flavor to it. Then apparently I would expect a French restaurant to serve really good quality mussel with savory sauce so that I could dip my bread in it. However, the mussels weren't fresh and had sand in them. The creole sauce was just okay. Could pair with bread but I would expect more from a Michelin Star place. Regarding the seafood linguine, the overall flavor was too sour and did not blend with the seafood and linguine very well. Also, there was only ONE scallop in the whole dish but too much linguine, which made me doubt whether this place was trying to fill me up with these linguine. Indeed, I would recommend trying their steak/poultry dishes, but leave the mussels and seafood linguine out from your choices. Amélie (another French place in west vill.) has better options regarding seafood and mussels.",4,1,

We tried the seared foie gras (it wasn't good) and I found it to be too fatty and not in a ""fatty goodness"" kind of way but the opposite. I was expecting delicious rich flavor and that wasn't what we got. For $25 it was disappointing and I wouldn't order it again. We also ordered the octopus appetizer, the filet mignon with foie gras, the seafood linguine, and the strawberry tart. The rest of our savory meal was good and the dessert was just okay. I didn't see the point of adding the spice messily onto the plates. They didn't serve any purpose except for looking messy and dirty. Overall, we had a nice time but won't be back.",1,,

So I came with high expectations. And of course, that is almost always the start of terrible downfall. I had the grilled octopus salad (with mushroom and tomatoes) to start and the Seafood Linguini as the main, per the waiter's suggestion. Both are good, but not great. The octopus salad was definitely better than the linguini. While the seafood is actually pretty fresh, the linguini noodle and sauce is actually bitter. I had to remind myself that I should just not bother getting seafood outside of the Pacific NW, because it's surely going to disappoint. The service was good, but given the price, I would not be inspired to go back.--- update ---owner contacted me and gave me a run down of what he thought went wrong back in the kitchen (new line cook, not enough reduction) and offered a refund. As a someone who did my masters in operations, this impressed me that he diagnosed a production issue and took care to make things right for the customer.

We shared the mussels with chorizo and some cream. Really good! And fresh!We ordered the filet mignon, lamb, seafood linguini and rabbit. I would say my favorites were in the same order. The rabbit had more of a gamey taste to it, and even though it's only my 2nd time eating rabbit, I didn't enjoy it. I will say that I LOVED the veggie platters! Thanks to the yelpers I knew we could order more...They had chayote, cauliflower, carrot puree (i need this recipe b/c it was amazing), and our 2nd batch had kale. delicious and buttery veggies. :)Our waiter was super kind and not stuffy as you might think as they serve French food, and service was great!

On top of our pre-fixe menu, we got an order of the ESCARGOT WHICH IS A MUST!! Hands down the best part of the meal. I can eat that for the rest of my life. They give you bread so you can dip and inhale the garlicky and buttery concoction. We got the French onion soup and a house pate as appetizers, which were pretty good. For entrees, we got the seared pork tenderloin and beef tartar, which were incredibly delicious. Desserts were banana brulee and puff pastry drizzled with caramel. If I come back, I'll probably just do a lot of escargot and the entrees because those were phenomenal.",3,,

Staff is super friendly and have a sense of humor.Escargots is a fun eating experience for friends who haven't tried it. The best part of the dish is sopping up the garlic butter with bread. Otherwise, the snails themselves were cooked well, but not memorable.The house pate was smooth and rich--coppery taste of liver not as strong as I'm used to. The pickles and onions were a good accompaniment, as were the ripe mangoes in the salad.I wasn't impressed with the beets, but ordered it to cut the fat in the other plates (FYI there are complimentary veggie sides for mains). Loved how fresh they tasted, but in the end, it was boring in comparison with everything else ordered.Raviole...:D a little fancier (flower garnish) than how they presented it in Le Village (RIP) but just as amazing as I remembered. Get it.On to the mains: medium rare filet mignon topped with foie gras was perfect as presented. If you're like me and don't much eat meat, a small bite is sufficient to savor all the flavors. I felt the polenta cake neither added to nor detracted from it.I got the kassulet to compare with the vegan one I had at Le Village--I prefer the meat-free version. Might have liked it more if it had more veggies for texture. However the juices/drippings are incredible! Sip or dip it when it's still hot and it's all the flavors of the casserole concentrated in a perfect mouthful. I would gladly order purely broth if that were an option!I can't remember enough about the dessert to comment, except that both the banana brûlée and meringue were light (but sweet!).",,,

My biggest fear was being cramped in between couples but luckily we were placed in our own intimate two seater. When we were given the menus, our waiter briefly explained the menu... his attitude seemed very nonchalant. He barely smiled and questioned my friend's choice of wine. It was very off putting for me. Aside from our waiter, I ordered the French onion soup, the braised rabbit, and the banana brulee. My friend ordered the pate, salmon, and profiteroles. My French onion soup was amazing! Delicious. The braised rabbit was lacking something, I know rabbit isn't a very meaty animal but it just didn't do much for my flavor palate. It was drizzled with a heavy mushroom sauce that didn't do much to compliment the rabbit. The banana brulee was okay; I always prefer my brulee with warm custard instead of super cold. There was a graham cracker bottom which was surprising since traditionally it isn't really made like this. My friend liked his pate, I didn't really. It was too grainy for me, it reminded me of meatloaf. His salmon was delicious! Amazingly crunchy crust paired with a great mustard sauce. His profiteroles were good but yet again, nothing special. The dishes came with a side dish of carrot pure, cauliflower, and sweet potato. Delicious! Overall, my experience was so/so. There were some things that I liked and disliked.

When I eat steak, I like to see blood and hear it scream. I asked for medium rare but it was probably medium. No blood and kind of tough. I wish I had ordered it rare. A few days later I had a medium rare burger at another restaurant which was perfectly cooked and the contrast was obvious. The wine reduction sauce on the filet was delicious!As I stated above, the staff was great and the chef takes pride in his work.

Might I add that they also have the most delicious carrot puree? APPS: The little raviolis in truffle cream sauce were amazing; served in the tiniest little pot so everyone only gets a bite if you're sharing. The Baked Goat Cheese tart was surprisingly very good, large portioned, very creamy and savory with a nice bit of jam for sweetness. ENTREES: The pan roasted quail was very juicy and tender, sautéed with a really nice tangy fruit sauce (which can get slightly overwhelming towards the end). The duck breast with cranberry glaze was also made exceptionally well. The rack of lamb was not bad, cooked well but didn't have as much punchy flavor as the others. The Cornish hen dish was pretty standard. The entrees come with a little veggie tray, which is where that carrot puree makes an appearance. It is SO GOOD I asked for a big bowl of it on the side (and I got one!). DESSERT! The strawberry tartlet and tarte tatin (apple tart) were both not bad. For an extra $3 you can flambée your apple tart, which makes quite the entertaining spectacle but doesn't do much for the tart. My favorite is the ""Iles Flottantes au Caramel"", like fluffy marshmallows in a delectable cream sauce with caramel, MMM!The owner seems like quite the character, I love his little commentaries on the menu.

My date didn't like it all too much. But her french onion soup was awesome. For my entree, I had the salmon. Skin was nice and crispy and the saffron complimented it really nicely. I might steal this recipe. Maybe. Or maybe I have already. We were also served a platter of carrot puree, cauliflower, sweet potatoes and something else. It helped mix and match the flavors a lot.Finally, dessert. I had the uh...profiterolles (how do you pronounce this?). It was nice but after a while the dark chocolate overwhelmed the rest of the dessert. But my date mixed the whip cream with the ice cream with the dark chocolate.

The comfortable but quaint restaurant has seating in the front and in the back. Everything on the menu looked delicious but I settled for the braised rabbit and my friend got the fish. To start we did the watermelon feta salad. The salad was refreshing and summery with the saltiness of the feta. I'd have to say I love this dish and will have to make it during the summer months.  Now we all know French food is all about the sauce and the one that came with the rabbit was velvety smooth with a side of rice. While the portions weren't very big it was enough to ease my hunger. The fish was white flakey. The entrees came with side of vegetables that was also very good. We decided to splurge and get the dessert sampler. It is French so it couldn't be that big right?It wasn't but it was a perfect bit size morsel of goodness enough to satisfy the sweet.

We also had the curry mussels, which I used to drench my bread in as well. Surprisingly, the curry flavor wasn't overwhelming and the diced apple created an interesting combination.For our entrees, we chose the Seafood linguini with White Wine Saffron Sauce and the Seared Filet Mignon Topped With Foie Gras. The quality of the ingredients and the flavors of all of the food was top notch.I was so full but my friend insisted on ordering dessert.

(We are piggies). I then ordered the best thing on the menu, at my Russian boyfriend's strong encouragement: soft pillows of truffle and cheese ravioli. The service here is amazing. We ordered the homemade ice cream - the waitress knew I wanted it - and the banana creme brûlée. The food is just as good. This is the kind of place that I love discovering and returning to again and again... we will be back, and next time we will pay with crypto currency!",,,

I actively declined the offer. The food was delicious. Escargot needs some work but the portion and the bread are outstanding. I enjoy bread with super soft interior and hard exterior (screw wonder bread). We got a bottle of wine as well which doubled our bill and it's kinda saddening. They do charge a $10 fee for uncorking your own wine and a weird byob rule which is so confusing. You can byob only if you don't order pre fix and only on weekday excluding Friday and weekend. The waiter is wonderful. He knows his stuff and give knowledgeable suggestion.,,,

Don't eat the bread they bring out before the meal without dipping it in the ravioles' sauce.The rabbit was soft, tender, juicy. The cherry sauce was not too sweet and did not overpower the taste.I was hoping the banana brulée was more ... banana. Quite tasty, but not as strongly banana flavored as I had hoped.$64 for the above.",,,
75,anjali s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,0,3.0,9/26/2018,"The food overall was great. The ravioli appetizer, mussels, lamb and fish of the day were great. Where things fell short include that the two red wines by the glass we asked to sample were both really stale, obviously they had been open for a while. We ended up having to order a bottle just to ensure the wine was fresh though neither of us wanted more than a glass. Service was super slow - not sure if that is on purpose but it took an extremely long time to put in our orders and get served. The French onion soup was fine, nothing to rave about. I specifically told the waiter I was allergic to parsley and my lamb arrived with parsley on it. Not impressed with the service. I would give a 3.5 on this one.",,,

Both tasted on point and delicious Dessert: we waited about 20 min for dessert but they were gracious enough to discount one of our drinks for the wait (bonus points for customer service) had the banana creme brûlée which was amazing and the profiteroles which were ok but not amazing.

At the end of the dinner, after my husband paid and signed, he realized the waitress didn't bring his credit card back. As the restaurant is small and dark, it's possible that the card dropped from the folder on the way back. Instead of helping us finding the card immediately, the waitress insisted that she brought it back. It is quite interesting because we have no reason to lie about our credit card missing. Anyway, we've waited for 20 mins; nobody got back to us. We just left. My husband called the credit card company for replacing a card and disputing this charge. One month later, credit card company got back to us, in favored the restaurant side. Because the restaurant claimed that they gave the card back, it is my husband's responsibility that he lost the card. They lied about the whole thing. I am so shocked that a business could be so shameless. The existing of this restaurant is a shame for the entire NYC restaurant business.I've worked with French people. Some of them are super nice. Some of them are ""shameless"", as there's no such word in French. The owner's respond just confirmed my opinion on some of them.",1,1,

It's a free country and their food and service are worth every penny and or Bitcoin you can spare. Don't have cash and you brought an ATM card make sure to pull out at least 100$ so you may enjoy the apps the entree and dessert with your wine. I didn't have my ATM card.

Yelped it, saw the delicious drool-worthy food and we booked it! La Sirene serves up excellent French food with Parisian flair. The waiters and hostess were fluent in French and very knowledgeable about their wine.They were very accommodating when our party of 4 expanded to a party of 6. And the Open Table booking was seamless to use.We ordered their famous escargots, seared foie gras, seafood linguini, tournedos rossini (filet mignon topped with foie gras), rabbit stew, duck breast, and hanger steak. We picked out two wines: one Rose and one red. The Barbanau Rose from Cotes de Provence was a light fruity Rose. Great with the escargots. Probably delicious if we ordered the baby octopus. The Pinot Noir, Henri 2011 was a light acidic-sweet red that was great with the filet mignon. The apps were amazing! Butter, garlic, and parsley stuffed in medium size escargots. This was savory and perfectly cooked! I wanted bigger snails after cooking but the snails were tender and soaking in buttery garlic. So good! K took bread and sopped up the leftover sauce. The seared foie gras was buttery rich and tender. The reduced wine sauce was the perfect sour-sweetness to cut into all the delicious fatty foie gras. K's tournedos Rossini dish was much better than my tender seafood linguini. The linguini was topped with plenty of fresh scallops, shrimp, mussels and clams. But I was in the mood for foie gras. That buttery cool foie gras melted on top of the seared buttery soft filet mignon. Heaven in a bite! K shared but I wish I had ordered my own!I certainly could not finish my seafood linguini after all the foie gras. Thankfully, K helped me out! I really wanted to order the Winter Warrior's dish but I was so glad that I didn't! I have to come back! To try everything else on the menu! Love it!",13,5,10

They would either have to move the tables forward and back or crawl and climb out of their seats. We all went with the $65 prix fixe meal, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert.Roasted Escargots- Immensely full of flavor. I kept dipping my bread in the sauce.Sensual Little French Ravioli- This arrived in a tiny red pot. It was adorable and tasted great. The truffle taste was light, which is what I prefer.Seared Filet Mignon- It was delicious, but I enjoyed the hanger steak more.Seared Hanger Steak- Wow. Juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned. I loved it.We all received complimentary side dishes of vegetables. They were okay.Fresh Strawberry Tart- The crust was way too hard, and the strawberries were insanely sour.Dark Lava Cake- Too bitter for my taste.

A really cute little intimate restaurant serving some great dishes out of that kitchen.  We even got a table side visit from the chef towards the end of our meal, so glad he stopped by to see us!  Thanks for a wonderful evening.",2,,
95,Christina Y.,"New York, NY",100,38,31,4.0,10/11/2017,"Stopped by for dinner this past weekend, and it was an overall good experience. The servers were attentive and constantly checking on us throughout the meal. We started off with the Sautéed Baby Octopus and Moules Marinieres as appetizers and both were very well prepared. The octopus was still tender and paired nicely with the mixed salad it came onto of. The moules were delicious and we even asked for extra bread to dip in the sauce. For the entree, we split the seared duck breast and the filet mignon with foie gras. The duck breast was nicely done overall, i personally think it was cooked a bit longer than necessary so the meat was a bit tougher than what I was used to. The filet mignon was done perfectly. although my girlfriend thought it was a bit too salty. When ordering, we were wondering why we didn't see any sides, but after our entrees came, the server brought out a plate of various vegetables. It was a nice mix of squash puree(?), broccoli, haricot vert, and potatoes. There should be an indication on the menu about the vegetables because we had almost ordered another appetizer thinking we didn't have enough food. Lastly, we got a complementary dessert of banana brulee due to some mishaps. I wish they had told us about the dessert beforehand because I'm mildly allergic to bananas. After one bite, I realized what it was and couldn't eat anymore of it. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would go back to try something else.",1,,1
96,Suzanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",288,58,130,5.0,11/6/2016,"I was in the mood for French food, so my boyfriend made a reservation at La Sirene to celebrate our one year anniversary. We started off with two appetizers, the escargot and the goat cheese tart. The escargot came drenched in butter and garlic (the waiter came by to tell us to make sure to dip our bread into the sauce, which we happily obliged), but the real star, in my opinion, was the tart. Goat cheese happens to be my favorite, so I might be biased, but I would definitely come back for that tart. For entrees, we ordered the cassoulet and filet mignon with foie gras, which were accompanied by four complimentary veggie sides. The cassoulet was as rich as the menu forewarned and came piping hot. I am sadly prone to burning my tongue, so we started on the filet mignon first. Usually, when I order filet mignon at other restaurants, it comes charred and burnt, but La Sirene's came perfectly cooked. The foie gras also melded very nicely with the steak. Boyfriend said it was one of the best he's had also.Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert, so in retrospect, should probably have only gotten one entree (we ended up taking most of the cassoulet to go). But I'll definitely be back for the goat cheese tart and to fulfill my sugar cravings another time!",,,

The story of Chef Didier Pawlicki is shared within the menu, and his restaurant is warm and welcoming. For restaurant week or any other time, eating here is a must for French cuisine. Whether you indulge in the banana brûlée or are enjoying the gnocchi with black truffles and a glass of wine, your waiter will likely ask you if you want to scoop up the remaining sauce or last bite (as you should)!",,,

I liked the mini raviolis. The sauce was amazing. I couldn't help myself and dipped the complimentary bread in to finish the sauce. The watermelon salad was refreshing as it is just several pieces of watermelon cubes with feta and mint leaves. My entree was the filet mignon with foie gras on top. Deliciousness!!! My friend had the rabbit, which was not as tender as I thought, and the steak. I thought they were all very tasty. We ended the meal with the petit desserts.Would come back for escargot.

100,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",751,433,173,5.0,6/1/2016,"La Sirene is as delicious as its Yelp star rating is impressive! French food is often inflated and bougey in New York City. It's hard to eat it on anything other than a white tablecloth in a dimly lit restaurant. But La Sirene is different. Its modest interior and charmingly conversational menu is--in my opinion, refreshing. The escargot is good--it might very well be from a can, but it still manages to be delicious and comparable to the escargot I've had in France. So much can be said about a restaurant by its bread--they had to refill ours three times. Needless to say, very fresh bread. We order the torissimo, which is their signature dish--a disk of pate atop a steak with au jus. SO FRENCH--but it was delightful. I would recommend this for anyone who is a fan of pate. I am not, so I wouldn't say it converted me, but I can see the appeal of this dish. I had the seafood linguine, which in my opinion--was the better dish. the seafood was VERY fresh, and the pasta was delicious.For dessert, we had the banana pudding brûlée, which was light and delicious! Though the menu isn't the CHEAPEST meal around, it attests to the quality of the food, and not just for bougey flare. If you're contesting between La Sirene and Tourneau, I'd definitely go for La Sirene!",2,1,2

The waiter was extremely helpful by providing us the suggestions on their signature dishes. We shared their renown escargot and grilled octopus. Oh my god, definitely the best escargot I have tried in the city! It carried a light garlic flavor that mixed perfectly well with the better; however not at all greasy. Both of us opted for the duck breast as main dish - amazing! The cherry sauce and soy sauce made a perfect combo; and not to mention how tender the duck meat...my suggestion here is to go with medium rare, as they tended to overcook a little bit.Will for sure revisit, given their prex-fixe also made my mouth watery!

118,Chloe L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,56,0,3.0,7/14/2018,"We came in during the French Restaurant Week, however I don't think that's really a factor in this review, as the service was attentive but we were just not impressed by the food itself. I had the escargot (snails), the pollock and the banana brûlée. My bf had the ravioli, hanger steak and sorbet. And tbh, none of the dishes was up to our standard, and all we were looking for was simple authentic French food...(and my bf is French). Overall the entrees were too salty and they all came out with some type of sauces that we were not a big fan of. The appetizers were ok, but again, not impressive. The desserts were another disappointment... the banana brulee was somehow a twist of a traditional crème brûlée, however I think I appreciate the traditional version better as the simpler the better, unless you can be 100% it's a creative triumph. The sorbet was home made according to the menu, but it's a bit doughy. Additionally, the wine glasses were warm, which was not ideal at all though I understand that they might just came out from a dish washer. But as a $$$ restaurant I think they should pay more attention to the details. It was a cute restaurant and I really wanted to like it, however the food was just underwhelming...",1,,
119,Sam S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,56,1,3.0,2/28/2018,"This place is kind of meh. A friend and I came for restaurant week super excited by the great reviews, and were really let down.To start off, the ""restaurant week menu"" pre fix essentially added up to what'd you'd pay if you just ordered a la carte, minus two dollars or so. So we went in feeling a little ripped off, but were nonetheless excited for the excellent food we'd read all about. We went classic french and got french onion soup/pear salad as our appetizers, steak for dinner, and sorbet/profiteroles for dessert.My friend summarized the food well when she said a lot of it ""was like wedding food."" The french onion soup was great but the salad was kind of sad, basically some leaves with mediocre dressing and a lukewarm, mildly flavored pear dropped in the middle. The steak was alright, not so tender and not salty enough. Pretty meh.The profiteroles were excellent and the mango sorbet was fresh. That made us happy, but I kind of wish the sorbet was an assortment of the three options rather than ""one big ball"" as the waiter described. Then there was the service, which was mediocre at best. We felt rushed in and out, the waiters were fairly brusque (read: fairly French), and it just didn't seem professional. The decor was also a little gloomy (not so opulent or elegant), and the candle on the table was fake which bothered me lol. So, if you're reading this Didier, up your game! We could tell that a lot of love had been put into this restaurant, but it didn't shine through. As a somewhat pricey restaurant in Tribeca, this place should be more consistent food wise, way better service wise, and just a few touches on the ambience would make a world of difference.",1,,

These are the things we chose:- Ravioli (literally one of the best things I've ever eaten)- Pate de campagne maison (amazing, burst of fresh flavors)- Hanger steak (cooked perfectly, and seasoned soo well)- Cornish hen (I thought it was a bit tangy, and didn't like it.. but the meat was tender and my friend loved it! The portion size on this one is humongous)- Banana brûlée (quite good, not the type that will make you dream about it though. I liked having actual banana slices in the brûlée)- Profiteroles (least favorite actually. The dark chocolate sauce could have been much thicker. It felt more like out of the bottle)Service was incredibly warm, and overall thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Will definitely be back.",1,,

Updated review","This is my second time at La Sirene, and the food as usual is amazing. Two members of my family decided to go with the Prix Fixe for restaurant week, while the other two ordered other items on the menu. Remember to bring cash or AMEX! A very enjoyable experience with my family. Despite being asked to move to a different table after we finished dining (Around 7pm, we arrived at 5pm, the waiter was very apologetic and offered another table for us to be seated at! If you like your escargot or mussels (Get the creole sauce) definitely stop by this place! It might be out of the way, but it's worth it.",1,,

125,Paul Z.,"Manhattan, NY",11,92,14,5.0,12/18/2016,"We went to Paris last night without leaving New York...via La Sirène. What a treasure! We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. (This is not something I would recommend as the restaurant became quite crowded later, but we were on the early side, just having left a Sunday matinee performance.) The cozy bistro atmosphere immediately brought about fond memories of trips to Paris. Our server, Jeane, was a jewel, too. After allowing us ample time to choose and discuss our food selections she expertly and patiently helped us with a delicious Bordeaux wine selection. Our first course arrived: beet salad with brie and delicate greens, classic onion soup, and pâté de campagne with Dijon and cornichons. The beet salad was prepared exactly the way I like it; I was able to taste the full flavor of the beets without having them overwhelmed by an excessive amount of dressing or unnecessary adornments. It was simple and delicious. The onion soup was without reproach, and the pâté, pure heaven. Our entrées were roasted Cornish game hens, roast duck, and cassoulet. The hens were succulent and moist and served in a rich broth with pearl onions. The duck was tender and delicious and presented with an intoxicatingly rich, dark reduction sauce. But it was the cassoulet that really transported us to France. It is an extremely rich and flavorful dish with duck, duck fat, sausage, bacon, and white beans in an unbelievably scrumptious broth. This dish alone is worth five stars. Dessert was a beautifully prepared tarte Tatin served with a scoop vanilla ice cream. Even though one in our group felt it was too sweet, there was not a single crumb left on the plate!As I have already mentioned, the service, with many thanks to our very charming and intelligent server, Jeane, was impeccable and made even better by being completely friendly and without any pretensions. The ambiance at La Sirène is lovely for a quiet romantic dinner or invitingly quaint and comfortable for a party of friends. It is lively when crowded, but somehow you can always hear your dinner conversation without strain. Next time you want a French bistro experience without going to France, go to La Sirène!!!",2,,1
126,James C.,"Manhattan, NY",154,46,3,5.0,5/9/2018,"Lovely little french spot tucked away in greenwich village. The escargot was buttery and delicious - must have finished an entire loaf of bread dipping. French onion soup was on point. Rest of meal (ravioles, duck margret rossini, and banana brule) was also flawless.",,,
127,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,43,16,5.0,8/9/2017,"I came here during Restaurant Week for dinner. I'm always a little nervous about Restaurant Week reservations because I tend to find the service sub-par, but La Sirene was awesome. It's a cute little space with nice ambience. The food was fantastic. My mom and I both had the tiny ravioli appetizer to start, which was my favorite thing of the night. It was served in a delightful miniature pot, with top and all. They were decadent and it was a pretty sizeable portion. So good. We split the hanger steak and the salmon for the main course. I would say the salmon was a bit better, but both were good. They were also served with a small plate of various vegetables for the table. Dessert was profiteroles and the banana brulee. I'm not a huge crème brulee fan, but I could eat this banana brulee everyday. It was like banana pudding, with real pieces of banana, covered in a crispy sugar top. What's not to love? To top things off, the wine list was very reasonable. We ordered a bottle of the house white (Pino Grigio, I think) and it was only $35 but surprisingly good. I will definitely be back.",,,1

129,Elizabeth S.,"Clifton, NJ",0,7,0,2.0,1/26/2018,Escargot and ravioli appetizer were good. Had the salmon as a main course and it was salty and flavorless. There are so many better restaurants in soho. I'd save my money.,1,,
130,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,11/16/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10New York City has no shortage of French restaurants but it is surprisingly difficult to find a reliable, unfussy French bistro that cares more about the quality of food than the glitzy atmosphere. In SoHo, Balthazar has been the French bistro everyone knows about, swarming with tourists on a nightly basis, but my experience there this year in terms of food was quite mixed. If you are in SoHo or nearby area and want to explore the French bistro cuisine, I'll give you a hint: go to the western side of SoHo and step into this charming space with the sign ""La Sirène"" on the front. It has had a loyal following since opening almost 10 years ago, but for some reason it has also been hidden quite well under the radar. On a recent Saturday visit with my girlfriend, I had a lot to like about the food coming from the kitchen.The menu at La Sirène is a collection of simple bistro classics. You've probably seen a lot of these and eaten a lot of these already. For bistro food, however, it is not always easy to be successful in execution department, which thankfully this kitchen is doing well. Roasted escargots with butter and garlic sauce had the nice texture without overpowering richness. I haven't seen mussels steamed with curry before, and enjoyed the spicy kick instead of creamy sensation that brought something unique to the table. My girlfriend and I happily dipped the remaining bread to the curry. The best appetizer of the night, however, clearly belonged to baked goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles and grape. It was a sensational dish that my girlfriend couldn't stop raving about, with the silky smooth goat cheese (which I'm not even quite a fan of in the first place) working so beautifully in the tart form for elegant balance in flavor. Tournedos Rossini, a classic meat dish consisting of filet mignon topped with foie gras and red wine truffles sauce, was another winner, with the juicy, tender filet mignon really shining and the foie gras and truffles sauce adding a level of richness that added to the texture (although my girlfriend said she wished the sauce came out a little less heavy). For dessert, we chose and absolutely loved croquembouche au caramel, basically a stuffed choux (a pastry dough) filled with French vanilla cream topped with caramel and sliced toasted almond. It was pure decadence with the delightful mixture of vanilla cream and caramel crust.     Getting a reservation at La Sirène isn't too difficult, but the dining space quickly filled up so I would still recommend booking in advance. The restaurant takes only cash or AMEX credit card, so be aware. It has been long known for a BYOB place from Sunday through Thursday (although now they seem to charge small amounts for corkage fees); I will certainly go back during one of those days in the near future. I was a fan of the cozy, inviting dining space that seems perfect for an intimate date night or casual get together with a group of friends. If you're looking for a satisfying meal with soulful French bistro food, La Sirène is one of the viable options I would be glad to recommend.",5,,2

Went there to celebrate my husband's birthday today and ordered the the Escargot (favorful, not oily, really refreshing), Creole Mussels (great sauces) for appetizers. Ordered the hanger steak and rack of lambs for our main dish...both highly recommended. Lastly had the dark chocolate lava cake for dessert, staff were very kind to put a candle on the cake when served. Delicious! Staff were helpful and attentive throughout our meal. The only reason I took off 1 star is they messed up my change. Paid cash but was short changed $10. Realized that the math was not right on our drive back home.

137,Renee N.,"Atlanta, GA",0,12,0,4.0,7/26/2018,"We were here for restaurant week last night. The host was very nice the afternoon of our dinner when I called and he accommodated my request to add one more guest to our four person reservation. The space is very much a bistro - small and fairly narrow. Not a good space for a quiet romantic dinner as it was loud but it was a great environment for our group. Several of us ordered the Ravioles de Royan, tiny raviolis with garlic and truffles in a cream sauce, as our first course. It was heavenly and the portion size was perfect. My husband and his brother got the French onion soup which they were also very happy with. For entrees my BIL and I chose the Oven Roasted Cornish Game Hen - it was so tender and savory in the au jus. My daughter and hub both ordered the Pan Roasted Norwegian Salmon, also a big hit. My SIL got the Braised Rabbit Dijon a la Creme - she said it was OK but did not wax lyrical. The restaurant was extremely generous with its side vegetables - brought three long dishes of a pureed carrot, haricots verts and potatoes(?), all of which were just as good as the entrees and thoughtfully presented. I thought that was nice since restaurants don't typically serve you sides along with your entree during RW. For the last course we shared an assortment of Banana Brulee, Croquants Caramel and Profiteroles - all were outstanding. The only reason gave 4 stars rather than 5 was that it took very long for the server (who was extremely pleasant) to take our order. To be fair he appeared to be one of only two servers in the restaurant. After that, though, the first course was promptly served and the remaining courses were perfectly and appropriately timed. I would definitely return here on my next visit to NYC. In this case, RW served its purpose for La Sirene - to encourage patrons who never would have otherwise known about this little spot to try it out, and come again to try other options after RW has come and gone. Highly recommend!",,,

The goat cheese tarte was very nice as well. Next I had the pork loin dish with a delicious sauce and morel mushrooms. The pork was very nice and tender.

It's not something I am into (prefer huge modern restaurants) but this will definitely be a charming romantic date spot.Since there were 4 of us, we did manage to try a fair bit of the menu. Service was personable and warm.RW MenuApps:Pate - more used to raw set pate. This was more like a cooked meatloaf. Very salty and aggressively flavored but I love salt and meat. Mini Ravioli in a cream truffle sauce - Yum yum yum. Presentation was super cute in a tiny cocotte and there was 1 teeny slice of actual truffle which I prefer over the bastardized truffle oil.Poached pear with blue cheese - I need to learn how to replicate this. This was ultra simple but the flavors just work. Entrees: Braised rabbit  - this must have been a gigantic rabbit because you get a full leg of rabbit - slightly gamey but closer to the taste of chicken. Hanger steak - this was the 1 miss. Steak was more well done than the middle rare ordered. I don't like it when restaurants slice your steak for you. If it's an individual size portion, I want to slice my own steak so that it stays juicy to the last moment. You want the juices on your plate not on the kitchen's cutting board. Vegetable platter - simple plate of vegetables with loads of butter. Zucchini, green beans and Puréed carrots made me so happy.Desserts: Profiteroles - one of the best I ever had.Banana creme brûlée - Love that they didn't over-torched the sugar and there's a decent layer of custard with a piece of banana hidden in the middle.

Honestly stumbled upon this quaint restaurant for dinner because the place I wanted to eat at had a holiday party.=we had a really great meal here!! We did not have reservations at 7pm on a Tuesday but the two waiters/host (I guess they were short staffed?) were very accommodating. I love the first page of the menu - the quirkiness of the chef/owner really made it personable. We had shared the french onion soup (good and cheesy) and mussels creole style (the chorizo helped with nice smokey flavors you don't usually get in a french mussels dish, sauce was very delicious - I contemplated just drinking it straight up but used bread as a vehicle instead - have to stay classy).  We also shared the hangar steak (eat it while its hot!) and the Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (super hearty, cannot emphasize how perfect it is for a cold winter night - the duck meat was falling off the bone, bacon and sausage gave us the right smokey flavors. It was a little fatty but soo good). The dish came with a side of vegetables. Lastly we were very curious about this Dr. Davidson and why he keeps requesting this dessert with a long name ""Iles Flottantes au Caramel et Anglaise Parfumée au Grand-Marnier"" - who is Dr. Davidson and how did he come to pick a dessert that was so special? This dessert was so light, it was a perfectly sweet way to end our meal. Don't knock the House Bordeaux - really easy to drink and was able to stand up to our hearty meal.

158,Pinky C.,"New York, NY",524,482,1140,4.0,9/12/2015,"What an adorable place.  The vibe of La Sirene is so comforting and homey once you step in - we had a party of 8, so we got to sit near the back side of the dining area.  Staff were attentive and were helpful at getting our bottles opened up when we did the BYOB.  The menus I wasn't too fond of - too much text of weird descriptions - almost like reading an entire novel of the food (ain't nobody got time for that).  Appetizers: Foie Gras Au Torchon, Recette Maison The foie gras was absolutely out of this world. Perfectly cooked and it made my taste buds jump for joy !!! The sauce with the foie gras was amazing as well, I really wanted to drink it all up.  I dipped the bread in it haha.   Escargots à la Bourguignone The escargot was also super flavorful - with a real punch.  It was really hot to touch, so be careful you don't burn your fingers in trade of amazing taste!  Poires Roties au Bleu Fondant The pear + cheese dish tasted like the texture of a potato!! I've never had a pear like that yummy!!Entree: was actually why this review wasn't a full 5 stars - my duck confit was really only mediocre - I was saddened that my potatoes were almost tasting like home fries (those diner styles) It really wasn't the "" Diced Apple Sautéed Potatoes"".  Nothing much to say about this one  -- I wish I ordered the Seared Filet Mignon Topped With Foie Gras it looked sooo good.. *DroolSome of the sides that we got, were really delicious - especially there was one like a squash mashed -- and the green beans yum!!! Fresh and home-made tasting.  Desserts: Tarte Tatin (flammable) was definitely the show-stopping dessert, but it was not as delicious as the Banana Brulée which was one of my fav desserts of the night.  Lava cake was good too.  The most unique one was Iles Flotantes au Caramel et Anglaise Parfumee au Grand-Marnier - The texture was like eating a cloud.  Not to sure about that one.  Choux Chantilly  was also only ok, because I'm not much of a puff pastry person.Our waiter was also nice enough to take 3 photos of our group for us :)  Thank you for the delightful night and delicious food!!",1,,

We were there during restaurant week, ordered a bottle of white wine, and each had the watermelon/mint/feta salad (excellent and now I want to make it myself), the wild Alaskan pollock (pan roasted, tender, delicious), and the dessert plate (most of which was too sweet for me but very nicely presented).

All in all, it was actually really delicious, extremely filling. I ordered the hanger steak, which was cooked to perfection (medium rare), but I also tried from everyone else's plates like the filet mignon with fois gras, seafood pasta, and the duck cassoulet. The duck cassoulet was a little much, with so much packed in, but if you're down for that kind of thing, go for it. The seafood pasta was delicious, with a good amount of seafood in it. We had also gotten the muscles, escargot, and steak tartar as apps so I was already getting extremely full from that. I believe if you want to make a reservation for more than 5, you have to call them, but otherwise doing it through yelp was extremely easy. They also call you to remind you that they only take cash, check, AMEX, or Bitcoin, and the BYOB is ok except for weekends and holidays I believe.",,,

It's rather small and seems pretty popular, but we went right at opening time so it was pretty empty.The food is great. Their French Onion Soup is one of the best I've had, with a thick bread/cheese layer on top. The escargots appetizer was also very good. Heavy on the butter and garlic but a ton of flavor. For the main dishes we got the pork tenderloin and pollock, and had the banana brulee for dessert.The prix-fixe menu included a complementary wine, but we chose to not get wine, and the chef/owner personally came out and offered us a second dessert.

FYI- this place is BYOB majority of the week (excluding fri and sat). the escargot was not on the restaurant week menu, but my cousin and i became obsessed with snails on our last eurotrip so it was a must! for entrees we had the steak with butter and fresh herbs, steak tar tare, and pollock. they come out with a shared plate of veggie sides. the carrot mash was to die for. i need this recipe asap! full of cream and butter, seriously transformed the carrots. the steak tar tare was definitely a highlight. it had a unique flavor to other tar tares i had, almost like a spicy mustard? really good. dessert was sort of underwhelming, but was so full didnt really need it anyway. the location of this place is pretty discreet and really close to holland tunnel. unfortunately not the best area for post dining drinks but walk a few blocks and there are lounges etc.",,,

The food didn't necessarily astound us, but I imagine the food during non-restaurant week and perhaps dinner would be outstanding. As it was brunch, my friend and I ordered the pate and French onion soup, gnocchi and croque Monsieur, and had the same dessert of sorbet, banana brûlée, and some sort of cream puff.The good: the croque Monsieur, as recommended, was quite delicious even though I dislike ham. The side of French vegetables was appreciated-- they even gave us a refill! The French onion soup was pretty good too- although how do you mess up onion soup? The portions were large throughout- some restaurants skimp out on restaurant week, but not la sirene.The mediocre: Pate. Nothing special about this.The less-than-mediocre: The side salads- either I couldn't taste the dressing or they were just underdressed? And it was the same salad that came with appetizers and main course. The gnocci was a bit too heavy for a Sunday lunch- we ended up taking it home. Something about the service was off, but I can't pinpoint what- they were certainly attentive, but a bit awkward perhaps.I definitely see the merit in this restaurant, but perhaps would be a better experience without restaurant week.",,,

However much alike to the native New Yorker, I understand the scam in restaurant week menus and decided to opt for a la carte. We went for these dishes below: -Escargot - While I am a fan of softer escargot that is on the more buttery side, this dish was a bit different from what I expected. I did like the flavor but a part of me felt like this looked better than it tasted-Ravioli with truffle oil - this dish was tiny! However, it was still packed with creaminess and the truffle oil made it pretty tasty. I enjoyed dipping my bread into the leftover cream sauce-Cassoulet -beans, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon & Pork sausage- I really liked this dish. I shared it with a friend and it was the perfect portioning. The beans were really flavorful and the topping was crispy. The duck tasted like chicken, but I am guessing it was because of the way it was cooked. -Profiteroles - I love this dessert. If nothing else, I would just get this by myself here and eat it if I am down and my day would be instantaneously better.

180,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1108,1107,4.0,1/25/2016,"** Restaurant Week 2016 Review ** La Sirene is another one of those long-time bookmarked restaurants on my list. When my coworker suggested Restaurant Week Lunch at La Sirene, I quickly hopped on OpenTable to reserve us a spot.When we arrived at 12:30PM for our reservation, the restaurant was packed. Almost all the tables were full. We were seated in a table-for-two and given menus to look over. We took this time to sneakily look at our neighbor's dishes to help us make our final decisions - we're both visual eaters.Since it was so cold outside and neither of the salads looked appealing (too cold to eat something cold!), we both opted for the French Onion Soup with roasted bread with Swiss au gratin. It's a different take on your typical French onion soup since the cheese was on the bread instead of the soup. The soup itself was excellent and tasted great soaked up with the bread. I just wish there was more cheese!I opted for the Gnocchis A la Parisienne, or gnocchi in a truffle white sauce with Swiss au gratin. It's basically a French mac and cheese with Swiss cheese and truffle sauce. When the dish was served, it was still bubbling - so definitely be careful! It's super hot! The gnocchi was really good - they were soft and pillowy. It really hit the spot on such a cold day.My coworker had the Steak Tartare, which they grind themselves in-house. I had a few bites of it and enjoyed it. It was perfectly spiced and flavored. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for a good steak tartare!For dessert, La Sirene served up a mini selection of their house desserts - Banana Brulee, Choux Chantilly, and sherbet of the day. My favorite of the bunch was the Choux Chantilly, which was a light choux puff pastry with whipped cream. The puff pastry was soft with a bit of a crunch and the whipped cream was light and airy. The Banana Brulee was interesting take on a classic crème brulee, using banana pudding instead.There were two waiters in my section and they seemed a bit frazzled. I don't know if they numbered the tables wrong or what, but the table next to us got all three-courses wrong. Several other tables also received late or wrong orders - we almost got two rounds of dessert! Perhaps we had just caught them on an off day?

For the meal, my first course I got the ravioli because on the menu it said rare find. I'm so glad I did!!!! Literally melted in my mouth and I could taste all the flavors and the truffle kick was amazing!! Main course my friend and I shared the pork tenderloin and hanger steak. There was a slight mishap and he thought I said pollock instead of pork but the waiter corrected it right away and brought my pork in a timely manner. The hanger steak was another mouth-gasm. Perfectly flavored and cooked right. The pork was also so tender and the sauce on it was amazing as well as the morsels. We were also served vegetables on the side and my favorite out of that was the purée thing. Then we got our dessert and omg was that amazing as well. The banana creme brûlée was so bananey, it tasted so good. The ice cream portifello was amazing! The chocolate sauce on it melted in my mouth.

185,Leo C.,"Forest Hills, NY",219,304,1491,5.0,3/21/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants.Always start with the escargot with butter and garlic. Very standard recipe, but executed with perfection. Butter penetrates the meat and chunks of garlic with herbs delivers the extra flavorful hit. Also get the moules rochelaises (Mussels with curry) since ordering it with red or white wine is easy to do anywhere else. The curry is very subtle, the taste is first and foremost seafood then the slight curry and citrus of the apple round it out. The foie gras is some version that's cold, not my thing, still prefer it hot. Pate is also pretty standard pate that I can get elsewhere, but I enjoy the little pickles and tidbits that come with it. Really delicious. Tried the hanger steak and rack of lamb. Both were cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and presented beautifully. However I feel like you can get equally as great rack of lambs and hanger steaks else where in the city. For all intents and purposes they were seriously awesome dishes that should be described more, however I feel like the standout dish and my regular go to entrée at La Sirene is the kassulet toulousain de la maison. Pretty much a casserole of thick cut bacon, duck, sausages, the starchy veggies all braised in duck fat. Oh so fattening but packed with so much flavor. The best are the starchy veggies I mentioned soaking up all of the fat. I mean all of it. Only have tried the chocolate cake fondue thing for dessert. Supper moist and soft. Very rich and sweet, so steer clear if you're into non-sweet desserts. Use to be totally byob, but now it's only on certain days plus corkage fee. Order a ton of food and they don't charge a corkage fee, at least in my experience.",1,1,1

Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, I was surprised how empty the restaurant was, because we were the only table there from start to finish.The restaurant is authentic. French style, French waiter and French menu, which isn't that easy to find in the city actually. My wife and I ordered our usual French favorites - french onion soup, escargot, mussels and beef tartare. I would give beef tartar a ""good, but not great"" because I really think it could use a bit more flavor, maybe drop a quail egg on top of it or something..and the rest were all ""excellent"", especially the mussels and the soup.Everybody, any restaurant can make those two dishes, but I bet you can't find many in NYC that does it better than La Sirene. The soup was super hot (you'd be surprised how many others bring over the soup in room temperature), very flavorful, cheese was awesome and the croutons were just perfect. The signature mussels was one of the freshest I've had in a long time, they were tender and crisp, and I loved the curry/apple combo, just hands down awesomeness.

190,Arentha C.,"Manhattan, NY",19,103,282,4.0,1/18/2016,"Bravo to the owner! First for serving first-class French food, second for taking RWers as seriously as regular diners, which is more than can be said for other places in town. The entrées alone come in five different types of meat - chicken, pork, beef, fish and rabbit. Each diner also gets all three desserts on the menu - very generous.The Foie Gras was absolutely among the best I've had - buttery, firm, flavorful and not too fat at all - temperature was controlled delicately at a level that cements the flavor just right but also melts instantly on the tongue. Raviolis were also top-notch - the cream/truffles sauce that they are drenched in naturally complement the cheese and the garlic.Braised Rabbit and Pork Tenderloin were both tender, layered and well portioned. Though in hindsight, we would also have liked to try out the steak. All three desserts were wonderful, with the Profiterolle really standing out as some of the best ice cream with melted dark chocolate out there.I loved this restaurant for its taste and decor. From interior design to music selection to the staff, everything and everyone exudes the French essence - laissez faire, class and sophistication without trying too hard. Even the owner's quirks - like only taking AmEx cards - are explained in such a disarming manner that you can't help but be charmed.This is Restaurant Week at its best - we will definitely return.",4,,
191,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1075,1948,46,4.0,12/23/2015,"La Sirene means ""mermaid"" in French. A very unassuming place, serving up very decent French food. Last week, I was in the area with some friends and after looking at various places on OpenTable, we ultimately decided on having dinner here. Oh, the paradox of choice. If you're not paying attention, you will miss the entrance to this restaurant, their location is very close to the Holland Tunnel. I've passed by on several occasions, always curious about the place. Service was attentive here. Timely and not obtrusive. For appetizers, we shared the roasted escargot with butter and garlic sauce. Definitely on point here, well executed and not chewy. I highly recommend this dish. The seared pollock with mixed peppercorn and brandy sauce was a bit of a letdown. But then again, pollock isn't the liveliest fish, so I guess I would have to be the one to blame for choosing this dish. Originally, I was interested in the moules, however, the owner is a bit quirky and doesn't serve it with frites, so I passed on this option. My friends enjoyed their meat dishes, I believe it was hangar steak and filet mignon. For dessert, we shared the profiterole, but I am not much a fan of profiterole, so it was just okay for me. And for a dinner with 3 people including 3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and a desert and w/ a generous tip, the final total came to $200. A very decent place at the bottom of the Island for solid French food with a mature crowd and ambiance. I would highly recommend this place to bring friends, a date and even business partners.",10,4,8
192,Meg E.,"Bronx, NY",6,20,60,3.0,1/21/2016,"Firstly, I was ecstatic to learn that La Sirene was part of NYC restaurant week's repertoire. I've heard/read nothing but rave reviews about this establishment. My boyfriend and I arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, and was immediately and so graciously seated upon arrival by the adorably charming owner(?). Okay, so everything was peachy AT FIRST. We got our complimentary bread, which is always a plus (nothing special, okay bread and literally just plain oil for dipping) Then our appetizers arrived. My man ordered the foie gras and I ordered the ravioles de royans. Both were decent. The ravioles I ordered wasn't a stand-out dish, though it was presented in a cute little cast iron pot. In terms of overall flavor, I couldn't really complain about cheesy pasta (but again, nothing special). Smooth sailing, right? After 30 minutes of waiting for our main course we were getting a bit antsy. But, we refrained from complaining to our waitress because it was a pretty busy night. AFTER ANOTHER 25 minutes (55 minutes in total) our waitress approaches our table to apologize for the wait and informs us that the kitchen was ""backed-up"". I mean, I guess. 15 minutes after that (an hour and 10 minutes in total), we finally received our main courses. By this point my boyfriend and I were justifiably irritated and the waitress didn't seem too apologetic. I understand the kitchen can get busy especially during Restaurant Week, but the fact that our waitress waited so long before informing us about this issue was unacceptable. As for the food, I had the rabbit and my boyfriend had the steak. My dish was really cold, as if it was sitting on the countertop for a while. Everything on my plate was the same temperature, and pretty off-putting. My overall experience with this dish was anticlimactic, considering I've heard so many positive reviews on the rabbit. The side dish (meant to be shared) consisting of roasted veggies was tastier than my main course.The desserts arrived so much quicker than everything else, and to my chagrin the best part of the entire experience. All three desserts on the restaurant week menu were delicious. General review: Food: 3 stars Service: 2 stars Disclaimer: This review is solely based on  the Restaurant Week dinner menu and could totally NOT be the case on any other day.",3,,2
193,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,1053,63,3.0,6/14/2016,"Very French I'd say... nice ambiance with I'd say a very French type of experience. We started with the ravioli as a shared app (wonderful), and then we shared the filet mignon with foie gras (slightly overcooked but good) and the rabbit stew (good). I'd say all the dishes were well made and we'd be happy to come back if we were craving French food and we were in the area (and had money to burn).That said, not the biggest portions or the smallest of prices. Like I said- very French...",,,
194,Brett B.,"Bergen County, NJ",2,32,53,5.0,8/26/2016,"I went to La Sirene during restaurant week with friends. The pre-fixe dinner was 3 courses for only $42. AppetizersThe watermelon and feta salad was perfect for a hot summer's night. The watermelon was nice and ripe and the salt from the feta cheese created a great combination. The raviolis were like tiny cheese treasures accompanied with out of this world truffles.  Entrée'sThe Alaskan Pollock was cooked very well. It was seared on the top but the meat of the fish was still juicy and flaked off as it should. The fish was surrounded in a light addictively delicious cream sauce. DesertFor those who just can't figure out what to have, La Sirene offered a 3 desert plate as a part of their restaurant week pre-fixe. The banana pudding was very similar to a crème brulee, served warm. The dark chocolate on the puff pastry was what chocolate should taste like. More coco and butter tastes than sugar.  Overall we had a great time there. Even though the place was packed, at no time did we seem pressured to leave. Be forewarned, this place is cash, Amex or Bitcoin. There is a conveniently located ATM right outside the restaurant.",,,
195,Alexa S.,"New York, NY",738,187,194,5.0,1/27/2016,"I finally had the pleasure of trying La Sirene tonight! I've had La Sirene bookmarked on Yelp for over a year now and haven't had the chance to visit. When I noticed that La Sirene was taking part of Restaurant Week, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to try it out. When walking in you can tell that this restaurant had a warm/cozy vibe. The decor is very warm and inviting. It almost felt like I was actually inside a restaurant in France. For the restaurant week menu, so many of the appetizers stood out to me. I decided to go with the french onion soup as that is one of my favorite soups. I loved it! It was very different than some other french onion soups I've had, but it was delicious. I loved that there was a piece of bread with melted cheese that came with the soup. I also tried a bite of my friends ravioli that was offered on the Restaurant Week appetizer menu. It was also excellent! For the main course I ordered the hanger steak as did the two friends I was dining with. We all ordered the steak cooked differently and they were all cooked perfectly! I loved the steak and also really enjoyed the vegetables that were brought for the table to share. In particular, I really enjoyed the cauliflower and the pureed carrots. The desserts were my favorite! For the Restaurant Week menu, each person was brought a sampler plate of three desserts. It came with Banana Brûlée, a Profiterole, and a dense type of banana cake. Each one was tastier than the next, but I do have to say the Banana Brûlée was perfection. It reminded me of a fancier banana pudding. I really loved it and wish I could've had some more! The Restaurant Week menu was the perfect amount of food and everything was excellent. I saw many tables in the restaurant having the fondue, which is something I definitely need to come back and try. It looked amazing. I'm so glad I finally had the chance to visit La Sirene and I can't wait to come back again soon!",2,1,1
196,Bessie S.,"Washington, DC",0,4,1,5.0,11/18/2017,Great! My family went here last night. The food was great. The service was delightful. We'll be going back.,,,
197,Edd H.,"Aurora, CO",2,6,0,4.0,4/5/2018,Excellent food. I took the family and everyone came back impressed.  I had the French Onion soup to start which was great for a cold spring day.  My entree was the lamb chops which had to be the most tender chops that I have ever had.  The restaurant is a small neighborhood joint which means you avoid the tourist crowds.  I definitely recommend if you are in town and looking for some great and reasonably priced French Food.,,,
198,T K.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,15,0,4.0,4/28/2018,"Standard bistro food but served in a very relaxed atmosphere that feels welcoming--even familial. No stress, no attitude, no worries...just nice food in a nice atmosphere.",,,
199,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",0,53,0,4.0,11/2/2017,"Quite a nice little establishment; I had the little Le Creuset of mini-ravioli as an appetizer and the lovely filet mignon topped w/fois gras and a perfect red wine sauce.  If you are looking for a fine meal without any pretense, this is one of those places.  The food was great, the atmosphere relaxed and the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  We went back about two or three weeks later for a similar experience (and b/c our youngster got tired of hearing how good it was...!)",,,
