0,3,9/21/2018,342,1,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",Deana B.,295,5.0,101,"Cibar is a great little cocktail bar tucked away on Irving. They make an amazing Old Fashioned here (sans sugar) and they are even better when enjoyed during their happy hour that goes until 8:00pm. During Happy Hour these are only $10 and they certainly sneak up on you.Cibar is perfect for a date or catching up with friends. I also see a good amount of small, intimate gatherings here. The bartenders are super nice here and know how to make a mean drink. Overall, come here for happy hour and stay until you've realized you had one too many Old Fashioneds : )",2
1,,10/26/2018,211,,"Jersey City, NJ",Jesse S.,96,3.0,109,"Dear Irving was closed for a special event, so we ventured across the street based on the good reviews. It was happy hour so we started ordering away. The happy hour cocktails were less than impressive. Tried both the gimlet and the old fashioned and forced my way through both. Couldn't decide if they were poorly mixed or bad quality alcohol. Based on those two, I didn't even bother trying anything else. I will say I had a sip of the beer of the day and it was decent. Service was slow. Had to flag down a server to get a refill of water or order more drinks. They did however make a point to come around just before happy hour ended, which was much appreciated.",

Would highly recommend Cibar if you want to avoid Dear Irving.The bar tenders are much more social and provide the perfect personal touch to deliciously crafted cocktails. Although the menu isn't as creative or exhaustive as Dear Irving, you'll still find extremely unique drinks such as a frozen grape cocktail. Try to snag a spot on the plush couches across from the bar - it provides the best people watching while sipping a cocktail and catching-up with an old friend.",
3,,3/17/2018,113,,"New York, NY",Melville G.,593,4.0,326,"Cibar is great little lounge style bar! We stopped by for a couple of drinks before dinner, and we were pleasantly surprised by what we found here!The first thing you notice is the amazing decor. The place is done up in a middle-eastern, moorish sort of way which we thought was really elegant. It was a bit packed when we came since there was a private event going on. We got a seat near the entrance but they graciously accommodated our request to move a bit closer to the fireplace as the spot opened up a little later.Our server was really sweet and friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. The drinks here were a slight let down though, the cocktails though strong were a bit unbalanced with one flavor standing out over the others. Maybe we would have had better luck with some other drinks.Overall an above average cocktail bar in this area, I would be willing to stop by here again.",2
4,,7/23/2018,4,,"Queens, NY",Eli B.,69,4.0,59,"We came here over the weekend for drinks for a friend's birthday. It was pouring rain so the place was completely empty at 10pm on a Saturday night but definitely alright with us as we wanted low-key. They have a variety of different cocktails that cost $14/each but some were very good, others were O-K, depends on your preference. The food was quite pricey but we tried a couple of different appetizers to complement our cocktails. The lounge is very laid back and was a nice place to converse with friends over a few drinks.",
5,,2/25/2018,67,,"District of Columbia, DC",Juan-Luis P.,13,5.0,29,"Great bar between gramercy Park and LES. The cocktails are very well done, the service is great, the music and the ambiance in general is perfect to spend a fun night but still not too crowded. The crowd is in their 40s I guess. Try the Manhattans and order some appetizers, you won't regret.",1
6,4,11/5/2017,947,2,"New York, NY",Jackie S.,3018,5.0,751,"VERY impressed with Cibar! It's 1920's swanky meets Alice in Wonderland topsy-turvy, with an awesome cocktail menu and GREAT music. Who knew this was tucked away on Irving?! A hidden gem!It's beautiful inside, and despite the upscale feel, it's not snooty in any way. The vibe was excellent, as were the drinks. I had the Cognac French 75 which was great, and different. Service was really good too.I'll definitely be back.",7
7,,9/2/2018,118,,"Brooklyn, NY",Kay L.,10,5.0,22,Beautiful beautiful place! Happy hour was wonderful! Loved lounging with my close old time friends. Staff was friendly and the food was delightful! Looking forward to visiting this gem again soon!,

Seeking a cute spot for cocktails, we found Cibar. Adorable but sleek decor, happy hour, & good music. If you are in the area, check out this place for a different scene.",
9,1,2/18/2018,142,,"Los Angeles, CA",Alyssa H.,28,4.0,542,Came to this bar by accident but actually it was pretty rad. Irving street is a great location. Happy hour until 8 pm. When we came at 6 on Friday it was only empty and at first the decor seemed random (Moroccan + Asian + disco) but as it filled up it actually became fun and unique. The bartender was not overly friendly but the drinks were actually really good!,2
10,,8/2/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Cindy C.,0,5.0,19,"This is my go-to place! I love the ambiance, service, and drinks! I always have a great time when I come here. You have to try the Gimlet! A MUST TRY!",
11,,3/12/2018,26,,"FLUSHING, NY",Kevin L.,174,1.0,109,I had a reservation at 8:45PM on Saturday and I really didn't need one. The place was empty. The bar was small with maybe 10 tables. A couple arrived 15 mins later sat next to us. He said the reason he was at cibar because Dear Irving the bar across the street didn't have any tables available. The service and drinks were average. They didn't have woodford bourbon for my old fashioned!! The place is between a regular bar lounge and a dive bar. The place was dark. The atmosphere was blah. No vibe to this place. Would I come back? I don't think so.,
12,,8/31/2017,134,,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",Sam K.,351,4.0,190,"Cibar's eclectic decor drew me in - mismatched chairs with decorative throw pillows, big comfy chairs, little tables for 2 and a mirror tiled bar lit with pink lights. It's a basement bar along Irving, pretty easy to miss and pleasantly surprised when I found it.They do have a happy hour with a few minimally discounted cocktails, but no bargain to rave about. Drinks we all about $10+ and they had a pretty all over the place assortment of snacks (price wise and food wise- no common theme or cuisine). Truffle Popcorn was an app standout- and the chips and guac (3x chips to guacamole ratio) were good but nothing special.Drinks wise I went classic here and ordered a margarita, then another, and maybe one more so you know it was good! I can't comment on the balance of the more specialty cocktail offerings, but there were a lot of pretty fruity pink drinks being served up so if I head back that way I'd dare to be more adventurous!",
13,,9/28/2017,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",M L.,61,4.0,40,"I came here for my birthday event and my friends and I had an amazing time. They have happy hour until 8pm, they have a food menu which was important as most of my friends just got out of work and were hungry. The place was spacious and non pretentious. The ambiance was great! It did get really busy around 8-9pm on a Friday night but it wasn't uncomfortably crowded. Our waitress was very attentive and nice. Overall, we had a great time, my friends came up to me and told me they really enjoyed Cibar. I would definitely come back again. It is low key and can be an intimate place for a date or just to catch up with a few friends too.The only reason why I took one star off is because they forgot to make note that all my friends will pay separately. So initially, everything that was ordered was on my tab. The waitress was nice enough to divide it up amongst my friends who needed to leave. But for some reason, at the end of the night, the whatever was left over was still a lot even though everyone paid their share. So In the end we had to still pay for it.I reserved 15 seats via email. The owner was very responsive and accommodating when we were communicating about the reservation. I did mention twice that everyone would be on separate tabs. So I don't know why it wasn't written down. Again, we had a great time. I really enjoyed everything Cibar had to offer and hope to go back. But if you're looking to reserve a table or something along with any special requests, make sure to double check with them when you arrive just in case.",2
14,,5/7/2016,526,1,"Los Angeles, CA",Bree M.,677,5.0,441,"Possibly the only thing I like about NYC so far. Came here for a shoot earlier in the day--the interior is beautiful and unique. Mirrored mosaic walls, comfy seating and they served us coffee in dainty tea cups with saucers. It's a quiet respite from the busy streets outside. Came back at night and tried a Smokehouse cocktail--SO GOOD. And still an oasis of chill compared to any other place I'd been on my working trip.",4
15,,4/23/2018,3,,"Brooklyn, NY",Bernadette P.,10,5.0,21,This was a very pleasant find in Gramercy. I was trying to find a laid back but classy bar/lounge for my friend's bachelorette party and this was one of the few that did not require a ridiculous minimum tab charge. Jennie was helpful in setting up a reservation for our group. We were able to reserve a couch area and it was so much fun! I really love the unique mosaic decor and the fact that this place is in a brownstone/townhouse. We ordered some drinks and a bunch of shots and had a great time. Bartenders were friendly and attentive. I definitely plan to come back to have drinks in the garden area now that the weather is getting nicer!,1
16,3,3/9/2016,815,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Ingrid S.,10936,4.0,1317,"I knew I would like this place when I saw outside the doors they had a complimentary doggy water bowl attached to their menu sign. Both adorable and really convenient. Though, I saw no dogs at the open bar event I went to a few months back in October. The space is chic and has both ample space, a nice lounge area, a disco ball-esque chandelier, and a back patio for warmer months. They had the twinkly lights going on. Cute little tables with a very funky decor. A chair in the shape of dark red lips, many clustered different tiny tables and petite chairs. It's whimsical and girly if anything in decoration. I imagine this would be a great place for a girly gathering or if you are caving into impressing your chic for the night on a date. At this particular event we were happily welcome to try any of their happy hour cocktails and wine on the house. The cocktails were honestly really really delicious. My favorites in particular were: The Hierarchy of Gifts: Prosecco, Lemon Oleo Saccharum, and Peychard's Bitters as well as some kind of special cucumber spicy margarita the bartender made that night off menu. Their old fashioned was good but a bit too strong. It will grow some hair on your chest. And the Ok Cupid's (something I can never wrap my head around and believe in) Cosmo was delicious but girl drink drunk in a cup. The bartender used quality ingredients and mixed all the drinks with excellent precision. Never got flustered with the amount of people and was quite sociable and friendly.A few sampler appetizers floated around. I mostly ate a lot of cheese and bits of brioche but they make seriously one of the best cheeseburger sliders I have ever had in my life. RANDOM. I remember this more than anything else at the event and how juicy and decadent they were. Salivating right now thinking about them. They also served a variety of squash flatbreads and mini wiener dog things. Pretty great place. A bit pricey but its nice for one of those special nights out. Cocktails are marked down from $14 to $9 during happy hour until 8pm. They also have a cocktail on their normal menu called the Ron Draper that I am incredibly tempted to come back and acquaintance myself with.",6
17,6,2/19/2016,950,5,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Stephanie P.,25541,4.0,1044,"Came here awhile back for a sponsored happy hour event. I really love the feel inside - beautiful interior that does a good job of being both funky and classy. Lots of worldly details that look like things brought together after a whirlwind of travels - I realize Cibar probably just worked with a good interior designer, but they did a great job of capturing that feeling of wanderlust and originality. I got to try several cocktails and food items here. I notably asked for an Old Fashioned (my favorite classic cocktail) and it wasn't bad - but it was very strong and missing the complex flavors I appreciate in an Old Fashioned.They had a fantastic cheese and meats selection and I kid you not, Cibar has some of the BEST beef mini-sliders I've ever had. Perfectly cooked medium-rare and wonderfully seasoned. I would totally recommend this place for a girls night out or date.",8
18,,8/15/2016,418,,"New York, NY",Jennifer R.,3232,3.0,354,"We came here for happy hour on a Monday. It was $7 house wine (Turkish blends) and $9 cocktails. I got the house white wine. It was similar to a Sauvignon Blanc, but nothing special. The space is super cool. There's a disco ball, long bars, pink tabletops, comfy chairs and an outdoor garden area.The service was really confusing. We weren't sure whether we were supposed to have a server or get drinks at the bar. Half of us got drinks at the bar. Half of us had our drinks delivered to the table. Only a few of us got water cups... So, honestly not sure if it's bar service or servers during happy hour.If you check in on Yelp you get 20% off, but not happy hour or specials. This is a cool spot, good for chatting intimately or in groups, but I wouldn't rush back here.",
19,,9/24/2017,566,,"Queens, NY",Corinna W.,406,3.0,236,"Cibar is a nice little place with some fancy, dark decor. I like the music. It's not a go-to for me, but I can see the draw for some people.",
20,,1/7/2016,139,,"New York, NY",Colleen D.,351,4.0,144,"I've been to Cibar quite a few times. They recently renovated. The cocktails have all been good, although I wish they'd bring back the chocolate martinis - those were the best! The music selection is always good. Atmosphere is great. Great place to meet up for cocktails. They also have an outdoor patio open in the warmer months.",1

22,,2/22/2018,0,,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",A R.,1,2.0,15,really not impressed with this place. I went to this place for my bday on a friday night. They must not have had an event that night because i didnt even hear any music. The location is physically nice but the ambiance i didnt like. My friends and i literally had 1 drink at the bar and started googling places we could go to nearby last minute to have fun and dance.  This would be a better place to go to if you are like on a date or with friends from work where you can sit down relax and talk.,
23,,9/23/2015,488,,"Hoboken, NJ",Michelle C.,4003,5.0,107,"Absolutely adore this bar! My friend and I randomly went to this place. The bouncer recommended us to order ""swipe right"" cocktail and said we would not regret it. He was totally right! We loved the cocktail. It was light in taste and refreshing while we slowly get tipsy. There is a small courtyard outback - it is pretty neat!  It's rare to find such a scene in NY.  Our new spot!",2
24,,12/4/2017,0,,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",Sara W.,0,5.0,6,"I held my husbands 30th birthday party upstairs in the private tea room, and i cant tell you how amazing the evening went. Jennie and her team went above and beyond. The night was truly perfect. From start to finish she was a total delight to work with, and made sure we had everything we wanted. I would gladly hold another event there. Thank you Jennie and Cibar Lounge for an amazing evening!",1
25,6,5/27/2016,268,2,"New York, NY",Lisa F.,978,4.0,434,"Wonderful lounge with fabulously dimly lit cozy romantic ambiance inside and a quaint little outside garden patio great for meeting friends.My friend and I had both been here before at night - but was our first time sitting outside and it was a perfect spot for conversation starting our girls night.Outside patio has rustic lamps and lanterns, flowers, sweet floral tables. Very cozy. Seemed many of the women had the same idea to meet at an outside garden spot with friends as it was mostly pairs and groups of women, along w a few couples on dates.We had a Mezcel drink - which they modified from their drink specialty menu based on my request for less citrus more fruity preference  - the added spicy honey gave it a perfect kick. The small plates menu selection while the truffle popcorn smelled and looked amazing - could be more expansive ... We opted to have a drink then go elsewhere for food as we were hungry and the menu was limited. Highly recommend for drinks and amazing ambiance both inside and the charming outside patio- both great for meeting friends or a date.",7
26,1,5/8/2015,757,1,"Princeton, NJ",Kevin M.,1561,3.0,900,"This is a cool little place tucked away in the Flatiron/Gramercy area that you would probably never notice. Looking like a brownstone, it's a bar/lounge that is especially a good place to come in the warmer months.The inside is decked out in contemporary fashion and there is also a front deck and back patio. The back patio is especially nice as there are a handful of small tables and its shielded from the traffic and noise that comes with the front deck. The front deck is nice as well, but the back is definitely better. The place has an overall lounge vibe and it turns up a few notches after about 7pm.The drinks are just ok in my opinion. I had ""the bareback"" drink which was interesting but not memorable. I also tried a few others that were just ok. If the cocktails were a little better, this place would def get a higher rating from me.Overall it's a pretty cool place from an outside seating standpoint. Thus in the winter months I prob wouldn't venture here just for drinks or inside atmosphere. I'd pass by again if I'm in the area and want a glass of wine or something, but otherwise, I'd go elsewhere for better drinks.",5
27,1,5/27/2016,199,1,"Manhattan, NY",Michael O.,8,5.0,13,Music playing a fun bar to sit at or outside garden to sit at oh wait there is more creative decor inside like a fireplace with lip chairs and fun drinks. I mean legit date spot or just fun place to chill and get drinks. They have happy hours too.Highly recommend,3
28,,9/1/2016,495,,"Manhattan, NY",Alicia C.,740,4.0,794,"Been here twice and the staff is very accommodating at the drinks area great. I love the ambiance here too. It's mix of disco and Middle Eastern style. Lots of bright colors and Arabic gothic patterns but then mirror ball walls and lights. I love it since it's very eccentric. The happy hour is great 5-8PM with a good cocktail list. The vibe gets more loungey as the sun sets. DJ starts to pipe through the beats closer to 8PM and on. The waitress was super friendly and fit our group in a comfortable spot and moved us to an even better one opened up. I've only been for drinks so can't comment on the food, though some folks ordered the truffle popcorn and I got a nibble and that was delicious! I would 100% come back here another time, it's a great spot in a convenient location. A place that you can definitely fit into all parts of your evening. Deal Seeking Diva tip: Happy hour cuts the cocktail prices down $3-$4. Pretty good deal for specialty mixed drinks and it's for 3HRS (5-8PM).",1

Don't tell too many people about this because it's got too much character for the scenesters to spoil.Come here on a date, with coworkers or friends and enjoy the OK Cupid Cosmo. It's as perfect as the bar itself.Note: 2 single stall bathrooms are located at the back right of the bar. Took me a while to find them...",1

But I wish there was better music playing rather than typical music you hear on the radio. Service was really good and the ambience was really nice. I was very disappointed but the cocktail menu though! I thought there would be better choices , i personally didn't like what was on the cocktail menu. But I would go back another time.",1

I treated myself to a frozen aperol spritz from the full priced menu and was very pleased as well. It was dark, cozy and bumpin on a a Thursday night let me tell you. I would say if you and your party want a seat on a busier night make a reservation in advance. A big group was also there celebrating a birthday, and it looked like they were having a great time. Anyways, I would definitely check it out!",
32,,1/30/2017,9,,"Denver, CO",Kirsten C.,32,2.0,169,"Stumbled across this bar because dear Irving was closed. While they tried to jazz it up with chandeliers, loud music, and gold tile, it looks like they took a random empty retail space and planted a bar and some seating. THis place has the potential to be so much nicer. I get that you have miscellaneous chairs, but for crying out loud - don't get ones that look like they should be in my grandmothers backyard. Cocktails will run you $14 and they were pretty decent!",
33,,8/20/2015,153,1,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",Anna G.,141,4.0,75,"This place is really a hidden gem in Gramercy. We decided to try it because of the access to a backyard patio, which didn't disappoint. We got there about 6pm on a weeknight and there were only about two people in the place. It's dark inside with exotic decor and the small outdoor patio was cozy and cute. The Happy Hour specials aren't bad with a glass of wine at about $7 and other cocktail specials, which lasted until 8pm. Win! We ordered some shishito peppers which were very well grilled and the serving size was quite large. We also had a nice cheese plate that was decent in size and selection. This is a good spot for catching up with some friends for a decent drink and a few small bites either before or after dinner. The place was packed by the time we left around 10pm. Go enjoy the patio while it's still warm!",5
34,,2/25/2016,75,,"Brooklyn, NY",Julissa A.,59,3.0,108,"I love the Decor of the place. Dark walls that become illuminated with glittering rose gold that give the ambiance a sultry morrocan vibe. I've never eaten here I just come over for martinis and neurons cocktail. The service does what they have to do and that's why they don't get the additional two stars. It seems the bartenders work separate. If I ordered a drink from one bartender and ask for the second one to make it for me, it wouldn't happen. I feel is they worked together customer service portion of this place would improve. The the decor is my favorite part of this place.",

Staff did their job but weren't friendly. I ordered a margarita and it was okay. I wanted to order food after looking at the food menu but was informed the chef did not come in that day so they would not be serving food. One employee told my friend that if we were hungry, we could bring in outside food. Two minutes later, another employee reprimanded a group for bringing in outside food. I don't think I'll be back.",

I had my coat on the whole time I was there. It looks like a great place to grab a few drinks when it's warmer since they have their own little garden/seating area out back. They also have a small place to sit in the front too.I forget what kind of Martinis we had but they were good. A little on the pricey side but good.Can't say anything about their food but the goodies that we ate from the guest chef were quite good. Just thinking about it is making my insides smile happily. The guest chef was a total sweetheart too and was very hospitable. The Guest Chef, his food, his friendliness all get a 5 from me. Cibar... I'll give you a 4. Maybe I'll come back once it's warmer out.",1
40,,5/11/2015,860,,"New York, NY",Molly T.,1415,4.0,443,"This place complete surprised me. I was expecting a tiny, intimate cocktail bar - speakeasy-esque, maybe. While there is a small back room here, the main part of the bar is actually quite spacious. While the drinks weren't mind-blowing, I loved the vibe here.The Gramercy area doesn't exactly scream nightlife. So this was certainly a find. Two things I love: dancing and swanky venues. The issue with these criteria is that they often are most found in clubs. I. Loathe. Clubs. Everything about them. So while Cibar wasn't  a club atmosphere, it had all of the features I long for - and never seem to find. Cibar is intimate (dark, comfy seating) yet crazy energetic. I wasn't here to dance on this particular occasion, but there was a mini dance party going on in the front of the bar while I was sitting closer to the back. We were there around 10/10:30, so it's quite possible that it gets rowdier here as the night goes on. But in this particular instance, the crazy was contained.If I'm remembering correctly, I ordered the Bare Back, which was so-so (my uncertainty was not due to intoxication - it was just a forgettable drink).  It was a whiskey kind of night for me, but in retrospect I should've went with one of their gin cocktails.

Atmosphere and location is nice.  You'll be able to get a nice drink AND be able to hear your friends.  Plus the patio is really nice in the summer.  The one big downside is that some of the waitresses aren't going to help you out if you don't already know what you want.  The last time I went, I tried to ask her about their  whiskey selection (which is 2 pages of their 6 page menu, so you'd think she'd know a little something), but this exercise was pointless.  Even though this was 5:30pm on a Thurs and the place was almost completely empty, she gave me a sortof a hurried/annoyed/rude look and didn't tell me anything other than ""[...annoyed sighhhh], people usually get Johnny Walker"" and then refused to answer any other questions.  My friend eventually had to step in to give me some insight into what I should get.  Maybe I should have tipped her instead?!Some of the staff is good, so I guess one bad experience isn't indicative.  The first time I went, the African American lady with the purple highlights was really friendly and awesome, so I guess seek her out if you can.",21

Updated review",4999,6,"New York, NY",Phil H.,12684,4.0,3286,"About five suffering bastards, a blackberry martini, and a Brooklyn lager all I can remember is some drunk Scottish guy plopping down at our table and being the entertainment for the evening. After the Whitesnake concert at Irving Plaza, Stacey, me, and the uber-cool Amal were still in party mode so we walked across the street to Cibar for some drinks. Was not too crowded with a few couples strewn about and what seemed like a bachelorette party. About 8-10 of these girls were dancing and there were two of them really grinding away at each other basically having sex. Girl on girl action! But one of them was about 6 feet 8 and the other was about 5 foot 3. Looking closer I could swear the tall one was a dude. Was I really that drunk? She/it had women's clothes on. Whatever.The real fun was the drunk Scottish dude who just would not leave our table, even with Amal clowning him hard the whole time. We could not stop snickering and kicking each other under the table. The best is when he told Amal - ""I want to take you back to my sex pad in Tribeca and make Scottish love to you"". I almost peed my pants at that point! He finally got the hint and wandered away. The dude was totally clueless. Surprised Amal did not punch him, but he was harmless, if totally confused. This was my third time at Cibar. It actually is a nice place to hang out, weather with a group or an intimate evening for a couple. Dimly lit, large candles, flower arrangements, nice seating, great cocktails, cool music. Even a back patio to chill out on. A bit pricey, but good quality drinks. Appetizer food options on the menu to snack on also. Pigs in a blanket and nachos - oh yeah!Still, I keep thinking of the movie Braveheart today. That dudes name was William. Yup.

Atmosphere was perfect for what I was looking for (chill, laid back but with some good music playing) and the location of the bar is fantastic. Gramercy is a beautiful area as it is, but Cibar definitely finds a way to stand out and differentiate itself amongst numerous other bar/lounge/tavern options. The one thing I must note is the outstanding service/staff. I called ahead the previous day to reserve a table and explained that it was for a birthday. The girl I spoke to on the phone was polite and went the extra mile by reserving us a table right in front of the fire place. We also brough a surprise birthday cake for her, which the staff was more than happy to handle for us. We gave them the signal, and they came out, candles lit, singing happy birthday. I can't say enough how hard it is to find such an accomodating staff in NYC. Drinks are priced as you'd expect in the Gramercy area. $15 for a martini, but they're made well and poured for you right at your table. These are their specialty, so if you go, get one. Personally I suggest the VSOP, it was awesome. Anyway, we'll definitely be going back. Kudos to all the wait staff for making my girl's birthday a memorable one!",4

Very chill atmosphere and plenty of room for all of us to sit together.

The watermelon one comes with freshly pureed watermelon. It's got a nice tartness to is that's rather refreshing. The lychee martini was my go-to of the evening. It had the right balance of lychee flavor and delightful vodka. Very smooth and it was very easy to have 3 of these babies (@ $15 each)What makes Cibar so awesome though, was the service. We had a fairly large group of about 12 or so. The server came around at the beginning and wrote everyone's name and order down so that she could give us all separate checks at the end of the evening. Pretty badass.

We were swiftly greeted, sat and told about the favorites on the menu. We were sat by the fire, but did not get wonderful seating. The comfy arm chairs were busy holding others' scarfs, hats etc. so we had the chairs that made us look like the center of a live art class (with a table that was just above the height of the seat. It like sitting on a preschool class!)My fiancée ordered the Black and White Russian whilst I had the Suffering Bugger. Both were excellent cocktails - the bugger comes with a flaming shot of 151 in the bottom. The cocktail is then poured over the top. Wonderful presentation and very tasty too. We ordered pigs in blankets, which were ok. A good snack to go along side the cocktails.Just after our pigs in blankets, our server was moved on to a high rolling couple, who ordered a very expensive bottle of wine, to taste and send back, and the same again with the next bottle and so on. You know those folks... Anyway. The serving staff were busy attending to their needs and dislikes and we were left with a wonderful guy who seemed to have come out of the kitchen. He liked to try and take cocktails with drink still in them and, although it may have slipped, the bill was thrown on to my lap to pay up and get out!The service kind of sucked at the end which cost the 5th * however I do not think that'll be an issue given the amount of $$$ the other couple were spending!!!

The guy who informed us of this directed us up some steep steps, however, and into a quaint little building. He told us to go into the back room. Mendl's was the name on the menu.Our waitress was chatty and very pleasant. She didn't rush us and gave us recs on the appetizers we were looking over. Our drinks came quickly and she always had something interesting to say when she came over to see us.Mendl's had half the drinks that Cibar's menu boasted (but the same drinks), and they offered about 5 appetizers in total. The apple and Brie quesadilla is what we ordered and between the three of us, we split it and were satisfied. Didn't taste the cheese, and there was only one thin slice of apple in each triangle. I think there was some sort of apple jam in it, and it dripped onto my arm with the first piece. Wouldn't order it again, especially for $12.My friends both ordered some vanilla martini and I ordered the pink lady. The drinks were strong, which may satisfy some people--especially for the price. I couldn't finish mine because the booze overwhelmed everything else. My friends also didn't finish their martinis either, for the same reason as mine. We didn't get the happy hour prices, unfortunately, but we had a good night regardless so we didn't mention it to our waitress. It was a bit pricey.When we got the bill, it said Cibar on it. Our waitress also ran out once we left and went back into Cibar, which is why I'm assuming that they reserved a room at Mendl's for regular customers. I'm still curious about what Cibar actually looks like, but I discovered a pretty cool place to check out again during the day for tea service.",1

There wasn't enough room to sit inside (a bunch of tables with reserved signs), so they sat us outside- a very tiny space, right under the fire escape. It started to rain so they let us in, and let us sit at the reserved table by the DJ. This place could be a mix of things, a hopping place to start off the night on a weekend, but I can also see it as a more intimate place for a date, given the flickering candles on every table, and a very relaxing happy hour lounge.We all got the blood orange gin cocktail. One friend got a lychee martini. Both drinks were pretty solid. Prices were on the high end, around $15-$16, but I definitely want to go back for happy hour one day and also see how their appetizers stacks up.",

In all major aspects, this place was just right.They have a nice lay out, great atmosphere, classy yet comfortable vibe and an outdoor patio. I am a big fan of outdoor patios, so to me, this was a huge perk.This would be a perfect place to have a first date (we counted 3 of them happening while we were there). The mood lighting is nice and the crowd is more young adult instead of college kids. Good drink menu, fast service, and chill place. I would go back.

Updated review",148,,"New York, NY",Rebecca A.,39,5.0,366,I know I said this place was off my list but I came back here recently with family who was in town and my perspective is totally changed.  We ended up sitting outside in the somewhat hidden outside garden area which is an amazing spot.  I had a really delicious cucumber margarita and my aunt loved her blackberry cosmo.  I have to say though I think what truly changed my perspective of this place was our waitress.  She saw that my 4 and 2 year old cousins were trying to grab blackberries from my aunt's drink and after asking my aunt if the kids could have fruit she brought out a plate full of an assortment of berries and some apple slices.  I thought this was such a sweet touch. Can't wait to sit outdoors when the weather warms up and I return :).,1

I love summery fruity cocktails and they have a wide selection of them. One really fun (and tasty!) drink is The Suffering Bastard, which is a mix of exotic juices and rum and a flaming floater.

Lonnie, the event manager, is absolutely amazing. His kindness made me feel at ease and his superb attention to detail made everything come together so well.

The other drinks on the menu also sounded fun, but I didn't get an opportunity to try more.  I think next time I would like to try the mojitos and probably the lychee martini. My table ordered the following appetizers.  There are only appetizers at this place, but a few plates of these can definitely fulfill one's hunger, as it did mine (didn't have to have dinner afterwards):Hummus plater = Normal, nothing to extraordinary, but it was a good and healthy option for the night. Mini burgers = Delicious.  When I bit into the burger, I questioned if it was made out of kobe beef.  The beef was thick even for a mini burger, medium-rare (my choice), and packed with a lot of flavor.  Mini pigs in a blanket = Very good.  These were sooo addicting.  The sausage used was not too salty, which is a thumbs up.  It didn't help that this was also bite-size as I probably popped around 15 of these in my mouth before I realized it was time to stop. Quesadilla = Also ordered a quesadilla dish, which is by far, my most favorite dish of the night.  Don't know the exact name as my friend ordered it.  But there was a slice of apple in each quesadilla slice, along with apple sauce to spread on top.  The sweet taste of the apple sauce combined with the salty mix of the cheese definitely had me eating at least a quarter of this plate.",1

Dim lights and simple decor with candlelights.The only highlight of the visit was a serene garden in the back. So,if you wanna sneak away from noise into more intimate oasis, here it is.

Arriving at 7:30pm, I was surprised how open it was...not crowded at all. There were actually seats available at the bar, unlike other bars on the same street.The ambiance is cool, dimly lit (they expect you to read their menu by candle light and there's no way around it), romantic I guess...the two people sitting next to us were definitely on their first date, of which we were eavesdropping. It didn't appear to be going very well.I'm kicking myself now for not trying their martinis, because those are supposed to be their staple. I asked for a glass of Rioja instead (they're most expensive red by the glass) and it tasted like garbage. Really, just awful. $10 a glass and it tasted like $8 a bottle.For a place that charges $15 a martini, you have to have a better selection of wine.You know what else was garbage? The music. The selection the DJ (yes, there was a DJ and he looked way to old for the job) was playing reminded me of a wallpapered room from the 70s. It was awful. Every so often there would be an OK song...but the rest was just awful. It totally messed with the ambiance of the place. Oh, another garbage point. The seating in Cibar is ridiculous.

Though it's not the new kid in school, or donning the trendiest skirt, it's the sort of classy cool that lasts and lasts.Dim-lit at all hours, you'd never know about the charming outdoor garden hidden in the back at first glance. Reading through the menu items: nachos, Pigs in a Blanket, sliders. Little would you guess that each of these traditional bar food items comes out elegantly presented, absolutely delicious and even somehow, refined. The menu of martinis is the icing on the cake. Since I'm a big martini girl, something about the selection here puts a smile on my face and almost everything I've tried has been perfectly on point. While I tend to stick to the typical Dirty or watermelon concoction, I've also explored the Lemonicious and Suffering Bastard (part of their Yelp Drinks menu) and really was happily impressed. Settling into those velvet couches, surrounded by candles and dim lanterns, martini in one hand and mini burger in the other, I wonder if this place was made just for me. It wasn't. I do wish my budget could handle a diet of $16 martinis every day ... but for now Cibar fits the bill for romantic dates, or some chill time with the girls. Cheers!",14

We transformed the place into a spa with the help of the amazing staff, especially Jenny who did everything from moving furniture to setting a beautiful cheese platter, helping me serve food, drinks and even dj-ing. I can't thank her enough for an incredibly successful party. A lot of my friends mentioned it was the best kids bday party they've ever been to and I credit it a lot to the cozy space and flawless service. I really recommend it for any type of private event or gathering, as long as you have Jenny and Lonnie (manager). And of course just for chilling any night of the week.

We grabbed seats at the bar and the bartender was nice and accommodating. As I sat observing my surroundings, I also noticed the DJ in the corner who sort of disappears in the darkness, but clearly enjoys what he does and was a positive addition to the bar's chill atmosphere. I sampled two of the three cocktails on special and, to be honest, they were completely average. They weren't anything to write home about - especially considering that the last time I was charged $15 for a cocktail (which is what these babies run when they are full price) was at PDT and those were the most decadent and interesting drinks I've ever had the privilege of consuming (and then paying for over the next three months on my AmEx). I definitely wouldn't pay $15 for the cocktails at Cibar, but considering what we did pay, everything was fine. By the time we left, the bar had filled up considerably with a more diverse crowd of both groups and couples.

I opted out of sitting outside because it was just the slightest bit chilly that night. Immediately I loved the vibe: it's sexy in an understated way. As soon as we sat we got menus. They have quite a few options for martinis, but unfortunately my budget did not allow me to try more than one. I suppose they are typical New York prices, especially post-happy hour. I got the blackberry cosmo and my friend got the chocolate martini. Both were equally delicious! Not too strong, not too weak, it was just right. I also tried the berry sangria, which also carried the right amount of punch. The staff checked up on us periodically and had our cocktails ready in literally seconds. Service was really fantastic. The music isn't music I normally would listen at a bar (I think I heard Billy Joel?) but it worked. There was plenty of seating even though the bar was moderately full. Four stars because the drinks were slightly above the price range I'm used to (I'm a broke college student working for pennies, don't judge me) but I definitely want to come back!

Ample comfy seating. I should have taken a seat but instead I made my way to the bar for something refreshing. The suffering bastard sounded really tempting but it was made with 3 kinds of rum... and I broke up with rum that time I forgot where I lived and drank on an empty stomach... so i chose the sangria instead. It was refreshing. And really, if you mess up a sangria- you should not be serving alcohol. I made my way to the bar where I spotted some gorgeous platters of food.

It has a good location and a decor that gives you a chance to relax and enjoy your drink. It has a decent menu of cocktails and the service and the presentation are both very good (although at times the servers seem a bit confused and overwhelmed). At first glance, Cibar has a winning formula.But the longer I was there, the less comfortable I was. Unlike the best cocktail lounges, Cibar draws in a huge, unruly crowd of post frat revelers who probably don't even know its a cocktail lounge. They stand around drinking beer as if they were hanging out in any generic dive bar. The whole experience was wasted on them and they killed the mellow mood of the room.

Again, it's all too easy to find a poorly made lychee martini though I always try; this one was well-balanced and the addition of the lychee and warm orange rind made this worth the $15 price tag. (Well, almost.)All in all, a good flatiron/union squarish martini joint...and with a crowd of mostly 20-30 something good looking guys and gals, it's equally suitable for drinks with a girlfriend, a pre-dinner amuse or a date spot....similar to the vibe and feel of blue owl on the east side minus the snoody bartenders.",1

Went here for my first Yelp social event, which was fantastic BTW, last night. As for the bar itself, I thought it did a pretty good job accomodating us, although having never been to a Yelp event before, I can't really make a comparison to past venues. I enjoyed the pizza, as well as the drinks. However, I have to say that they are a bit on the pricey side. Another down side is the atmosphere. Specifically, the music. On the one hand, I want to congratulate them for not saturating their patrons with Lady Gaga and L'il Wayne mashups. On the other hand, blaring music, even music you happen to enjoy listening to, isn't all that conducive to lively conversations. Still, I enjoyed myself and would probably return, all things being equal. Caveat: when you're checking out for the evening, be aware that the gratuity is included in your tab. Kind of removes an incentive for good service, but on the plus side, our waitress was great that evening so I didn't really have a problem with it.",1

I love that they specialize in Martini's and the special attention they pay to their Martini glasses. It's the attention to detail here that gets me every time. The decor makes it the perfect date or intimate spot to go to. Chic, warm, sexy, cozy, trendy, and just plain beautiful. Perfect in every imperfection, if it has any. My favorites here are the Chocolate Martini and the Raspberry Kamikaze Martini. Now I'm not much of a Martinisseur but whenever I do get to pay Cibar a casual visit, I HAVE to have one of these delicious love potions. You see, I'm convinced that these are love potions/aphrodisiacs made by angels disguised in form of their lovely staff in order to bring love to any first daters that happen to stumble inside this magical lounge. IA must-go-to in the cold winter months for the fireplace and the warmth; it feels very much like the type of lounge I would expect to find somewhere in Aspen during ski season. In the Spring, Summer, and Fall, it is equally as beautiful to be in there alongside someone you require a bit of populated intimacy with. I give this place 4 stars because I am extremely biased, but in my book, this place is a solid 5 hands down. They could do me no wrong and for that I will ALWAYS recommend Cibar for the lover in you, especially if you have never been. I promise you that somewhere down the line, you will be back.

Both were pretty delicious, but the Pink Lady, which was ketel one citrus vodka with strawberry lemonade and rimmed with sugar, was the best drink I have ever drunk!!!! HIGHLY recommend it. I then ordered a Suffering Bastard, which was captain morgan's, malibu, ""exotic juices,"" and 151... which the server proceeded to light on fire!! SOO cool. And so delicious.

As for alcohol, they have a menu that's comprised almost entirely of martinis. That doesn't mean you have to order a martini, though. I had the suffering bastard, which has the impressive distinction of being on fire when it arrives. I did expect a drink named suffering bastard to have a little more kick, but it was a smooth, pleasant drink. That's not a complaint, though.Drinks were half price for Yelp Drinks Week. With that said, they were 8 bucks each. For those of you who remember your multiplication tables, 8 x 2 is 16. That's 16 a pop for a martini--that's a lot, even if the thing has a fiery float of 151 in it.Overall, it was a good experience, good company, and in spite of the cost, I'd go back.",

It wasn't overly crowded on a Friday night so finding a table wasn't a problem. The drinks were solidly above average. The food was actually really good. The Bad: The drinks were just a little more expensive than I think they were worth. These are $15 martinis and I'd say they're more like $12 quality. Also, the place was very loud. It wasn't crowded but people have to scream to hear each other. It got a little annoying.",1

Took a second to find the place as its a step down from the street, but once I entered, my mood completely changed as I entered the dimly lit space. Although it was raining outside, the ambiance was warm and inviting. The cocktails were phenomenal. If you're in the mood for a dessert drink, like my date was, try the Key Lime cocktail with the sugar-graham cracker dusting around the rim. I stuck to whiskey-based concoctions and was pleasantly surprised. I'll definitely be back for some outdoor cocktails once summer rolls around again.",1
181,,7/30/2010,22,,"Manhattan, NY",Christopher G.,0,2.0,50,"I've walked by this place a billion times and it has good reviews so I decided to try it out.  The ambiance and the space is really nice and the outdoor area is very charming.  The biggest disappointment was in the drinks.  They seem to specialize in martinis but about one or two actually contain gin on the menu.  What is this vodka garbage?  That isn't a martini.  Ok, it comes in a cocktail glass, but that doesn't make it a martini.  Also, when me and my lady ordered the drinks, they were glasses full of sugary syrups with practically no alcohol in them.  We stayed for two drinks and honestly I would have had to have about 6 more before I even felt a buzz.  I don't mind paying $15 for a cocktail, but these are not well-balanced in the least bit.  Also, when I asked for a recommendation and that I like strong and not fruity drinks I was given what tasted like lemonade with ice in it.All in all a nice place to sit with people, but I don't like paying mixologist prices for fruit drinks.",2

Despite the fact that my friends and I walked right past it several times wondering how we could have missed it (the bouncer eventually flagged us down when he heard us shouting at each other about which way to go). It has a great vibe, it's a lounge but not it's not too crowded or pretentious. Love the dark lighting the varied furniture in plush fabric. The drinks were well mixed, too. Prices are about what you'd expect from a lounge in the city ($10-12 mixed drinks, $8 ish for beer).We had a good time, the crowd wasn't bad either. Some people were very dressed up, some about halfway so. I definitely want to go back to try the patio which was closed when we were there.",3

I was there for the Bour Tour Event and was about to go back for the UYE a few days later but didn't.  I was kind of confused with the Suffering Bastard.  I thought the name sounded coolbut it was not something with extreme alcohol content.  It seemed that it contained three different types of rum and did in fact taste good.  It was Yelp Drinks week so it was half price drinks though for pretty much everyone and actually for us we got to try a drink for free with the drink ticket right before the bus ride started. Lol, now i am having a flashback of that night, how I did not get on the crazy insane Team Three Way Bus...I stayed on Team Boring Bus, team Let's Do Our Taxes Here.I should've probably gotten the Sangria but at least I got to see the process of making that Suffering Bastard, you know the lighting it up show.  In general to me, $15 a drink is a bit much.  Sangria though might be worth checking out.",

If you do happen to find it though, you won't be disappointed.I went in here with a friend because we purchased two tickets to a Martini Making class that they were hosting at the bar. All of the bartenders I was in contact with were very nice and not as standoffish as I am used to.It was open bar for the time of the class... so of course we made sure we tried every martini. There wasn't a single one that we didn't love. The lychee one was AMAZINGly delicious.The catch... $15 for a martini. A little too steep for my taste. If they weren't free as part of the package, I would have had one and peaced out.Other than that, the atmosphere is dressy but laid back. It's so dimly lit that I lost track of the fact that it was still early until I stumbled out and realized it was still daylight.",

Sure why not, this little place has no signs. You walk in and there's plenty of chairs and lounges to sit on, with a wonderful 25-35 crowd enjoying their happy hours.

The decor is beautiful, lts of nooks for quiet ""conversations."" Plus a patio is always awesome. Drinks were inconsistent. The suffering bastard tasted like being 16 again, aka, 151. The blackberry sangria was good but nothing special. Food was satisfying, but again, not special--all of it was missing something. For example, brie and apricot quesidilla needed some more salt, a bit of ham in it would have been wonderful. The service, I must say, was excellent. The hostess, in particular, was very attentive in a respectful way.",

There is an adorable, but SMALL, patio in the back. However, and this is a deal buster for me, its wayyyyy too pricey, especially for what it is. Every martini is $15 and the wine is marked up by over 200%. Seriously, a bottle of the standard Vueve Cliquot Yellow Label is $110. The suffering bastard is served on fire, so if you are going here and willing to pay $15, I'd definitely recommend that.",

The amobiance is awesome with beautiful, well dressed people, and a DJ playing eclectic 90's music...I love how now 90's music is oldies...but I digress.  The drinks were fantastic, and our favorite was the cucumber martini.  They were strong, cold and served at the table in a neat little shaker.  Nice touch Cibar.  The portions of food are generous and really innovative.  I recommend the pigs in a blanket and the cheese plate.  We loved it and will definitely be back.",

This filled the bill nicely in a neighborhood that has numerous choices. Bar area is nice and romantic and well laid out. There is also a garden open in the back during season. Cocktail menu was great with many martini selections. I had a concoction called The Urban Cowboy which was tequila, Grand Marnier, pineapple juice and a peppercorn/ground cinnamon simple syrup with a cinnamon frost around the rim.It was incredible. Also nice selection of appetizers to soak up some of the alcohol with the best pigs in a blanket ever! Highly recommended spot.",

Place is small, chill, dimly lit, not crowded, very chill, little couches to sit or high chairs at the bar. Good fast and friendly service from the bartenders. I guess you could bring a date here after work just to start the evening and have a nice chat, not to spend the whole night though. I have no problems with Cibar.",

That instantly left me with a WTF attitude about the place. But otherwise, all the other drinks I sampled were pretty good....and served in proper martini glasses. If you are feeling a bit nibbly, the fruit & cheese plate was quite excellent and generous, and it actually contained much more variety than the restaurant versions I typically get. Can't comment much on the backyard garden--it was full when we arrived, but it did look lovely, even though it apparently closes at 11pm to respect the neighbors. Now that I think of it, I have no idea what their bathrooms look like. How did I put away 4 drinks and not need to go???",
