0,Diana H.,"New York, NY",1,3,0.0,5.0,11/14/2018,"I selected this venue for a client event in mid October. This review is long overdue, but my experience with Sony Hall and it's staff was so great - it was important to me to share my feedback!The space itself is just gorgeous and feels very high end. There are details and ""surprises"" throughout the space that make it unique and fun. The stage and lighting are beautiful and offer a true WOW effect when you walk inside the room. There are also a handful of branding opportunities throughout the space, which are perfect for a corporate event.I had the BEST experience working with Jason Kaciupski (Sony Hall's Event Manager). I've hosted MANY events, all over NYC, and Jason was hands down the best that I have worked with. He knows the venue, his team, and offered GREAT suggestions on how to enhance our event and make it more memorable. No ask was too big or too little - and he helped solve issues along the way. I felt like I had a partner during the planning process all the way through the event, and genuinely did not have any worries working with him. On to the food. Admittedly I was a bit nervous - as I'd never hosted anything at Sony Hall and at first glance it doesn't seem to be a food destination. Chef proved me wrong! The food was DELICIOUS and definitely one of highlights of the evening. Our attendees raved about it on-site and in the surveys that went out after the event. The short ribs and corn bread are a MUST!Overall, I had a very positive experience with Sony Hall and will be back at my first opportunity.  I am happy to share more details with any planners looking at Sony Hall for their next event!",,,
1,Thom G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,20,0.0,2.0,11/7/2018,"Went to see Petula Clark. The show was great though the sound system was very bad. Had VIP seating but to the side with speakers on the floor right in front of us. Her microphone was horrific and it took the sound guy half the show to equalize everything. Now, about Sony Hall. All of the seating is jammed in together. You cannot move, you cannot even swivel without alerting the people around you. Don't even get me started on how different hosts had different seating instructions when finding seats for people. Our waitress was horrible.  We were there for 25 minutes before she even made it to the table, then it took a half an hour to get our drinks. She never stopped by the table again. One of the other waiters said she was really busy and offered to get the wine for another couple at our table who never even saw her though they were there 45 minutes before the show. The tip is already added into your bill, but they say you can raise or lower it. I lowered mine - not nearly enough. The food is serviceable but at $21 for a hamburger it better be one of the best I ever ate, and it was not. 5 Guys has better burgers. Overall, the show was worth seeing but the venue is not worth going to again unless you get a really discounted ticket. And eat before or after the show. I am not inclined to see someone playing in this venue.",1,,
2,Ralph S.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,107,1,4.0,11/7/2018,"Went to see Petula Clark!  This is my 3rd concert for her that I have gone to, and and well, she is getting old but still rocks it out.  Maybe not like the 1st one!  Anyhow, this is meant to be about Sony Hall.  I have read the reviews - and it in our tickets get there early because when seating runs out it's standing room only.  My wife & I hung out in the lobby of the Paramount Hotel (it's all the same building) from about 5 pm until just before 6 pm since it was raining.  Got in the line, and were seated by 6:30 pm   This event did not end up standing room only - so - I am thinking everyone got a seat that wanted one.  The location has a history, and everything pretty much goes back in time.  My wife really liked the place!  I am a security nut, so I know I am three flights down and not sure where the two doors marked ""Exit"" go, and there is no security screening at all.  I am pretty much used to that everywhere else. Saw one guy that looked like security walk past. Now, getting on, the drinks came quick enough.  Our waiter never stopped moving, so no complaint.  Food was wow.  Pricey - but it's NYC - but good.  Saw a lot go by being served.  I just went for the burger and it was exactly as I requested.  Tried to get regular potatoes instead of fries, but no luck there, fries were delivered.  The ketchup was ""wow"" with the fries, and I don't eat ketchup on my fries.  Wife's Cured Meats, Local Cheese, marinated olives,fruits, & honey was really large and really good.  The honey was well, special.   Make a note gratuity was added right onto my check. On the concert, I enjoyed it but thought the mic provided for the singer sucked.  Made up that the people seated next to us on both sides loved Petula Cark and we shared our experience.Go back again?  Well, maybe if it's somebody I really want to see.  Only get to NYC a few times a year, and I would rather go to my town's Casino        10 minutes away than bus to and from the city.",1,,
3,Percy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",417,207,417,4.0,11/18/2018,"Oh my! I'll just say, do yourself back favor and arrive early. Also, the location doesn't have a big flashy sign so if you've never been (like me) you might be confused as to it's location. Because it's sandwich in between two theaters it's hard to notice. Don't get lost are discouraged because it's right next to the Hamilton store. The venue is nice but as I mentioned, you need to arrive early.",1,,
4,Meline V.,"New York, NY",629,280,582,1.0,10/14/2018,What a horrible deceiving place. I purchased tickets for Madeline Peyroux concert to find out that I don't have a seat and I'm asked to stand at the bar. When I asked for refund they told me to contact Ticketmaster. This is outrageous! Managment is rude and not cooperating they claim that this is between Ticketmaster and me. Who releases the tickets for sale? Why are they listening tickets for purchase when the concert is sold out? This is a shame! I will never come back! I'm placing dispute on my credit card charges. Horrible experience!,4,2,1
5,Ishween S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,6,1.0,10/14/2018,"This is the worst organized venue I have ever been to! The show was starting at 7:30, we got there at 7 & were told all the general admission seating was taken so we'd have to stand! I didn't pay $60 per person + taxes and service charges to stand at the back for 2+ hours - this is supposed to be a supper club with table seating.  Spoke to 2 different managers, neither of whom was interested in helping the dozen or so people before us with the same problem and many more who came in after us. Meantime there were tables and seats wide open which were being saved for ""vip's"". Nowhere on the ticket did it say first come first seat nor did it indicate doors opened at 6 pm. Very badly managed location - I will never return...and strongly recommend staying far far away!As an aside the servers and waitstaff were super sweet and tried to help get us seats but management still tried to interfere and get us to give up our seats...not sure what kind of a power trip these people are on!",1,,
6,Sybil S.,"Chappaqua, NY",1,77,12,1.0,10/1/2018,"I'm reviewing this now as an Event Space and not as a Music Venue.  This is simply a terrible event space and even worse if the event includes food.  Bar was not ready even 5 minutes before start time and bartenders were mostly very unfriendly.  The chairs and tables felt like an elementary school, they were so uncomfortable.  But the worst part is the food - practically inedible! Overcooked , boring, and not plentiful.  And just as bad was the service.  Half the room was served and cleared before the other half was even served.  The A/V was not synced properly and the quality of the video screens was third rate.  Step it up, here, or move on to another business.  This building has legacy and you are ruining its reputation.",1,,
7,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,1.0,4/5/2018,"I was less than impressed with every aspect of this venue. I went for its first official show on March 31 to see Mura Masa. First issue, the setup. When you walk in the bar is right in front of you, and the only way to get to the main floor and stage is to walk through this birth canal between the bar and dividing wall for the VIP area. This means fighting through 100 people trying to get drinks at the bar to squeeze through a 4 foot gap. Even the bouncers couldn't get through. Why you would ever build this layout is baffling to say the least. It was a serious congested mess all night. Second, at least for Mura Masa, not sure its like this for all shows, the show was 18+. Within 5 min of walking into the place while standing in line at the bar i had two different people ask me to buy them drinks because they were 18. I get it, i was 18 once and probably would have done the same thing but having to ward them off seriously detracts from the experience.Third, the actual design is nothing to write home about. Its a simple rectangular room with a bar at the back. Nothing interesting or special about it in any way, which is not a big deal but its nice to have some variation especially to set you apart from every other venue. Lastly, and most importantly, sound and lighting. The sound was crap. Way too much bass. Bass speakers are right at the front at hip level and they just pump raw bass through the crowd, and by the time it gets towards back of the room its just pure bass and thats all you can hear. The mids and highs are almost inaudible. And the lighting, more like what lighting? Its not existent. Above are simple rotating cans and a disco ball. Boring. And the stage backdrop is the worst part. It consists of like 10 LED fractals that are meant to look like neon lights. They flash and alternate as they slowly scroll through a color spectrum. Could not be less dynamic or interesting. You would thing they would at least invest in an LED panel wall where any visual can be applied but its just this static array of light bars in a half circle. I was bored within five minutes let alone a whole show. Didn't play well to the artist whatsoever. I can't comment on the food but the drinks were simple mixed drinks no different than anywhere. Prices avg for the city. Some bottled beers. Overall I think this place is going to have some great artists, and the space is pretty intimate which is cool, but there are just so many botched aspects from layout to sound/lighting to age limits that i'll probably never see another show here. Most artists play at multiple venues on multiple nights when they come to NYC and I'd rather see those shows at output, playstation, or even terminal 5 than sony hall. Its really a shame.",7,2,
8,Jeff K.,"Mount Kisco, NY",0,54,0,4.0,9/24/2018,"Was here a few weeks ago on a weeknight to see King's X, a band we've seen 50+ times at nearly a dozen different NYC venues. Love the faux distressed entry that gets more polished as you go down the stairs. The fallen chandelier at the bottom takes a minute to figure out since it's 'out of place.' The low ceilings and cave like setting opens up into a cool art deco/speakeasy type room that harkens back its history as the Diamond Horseshoe Review in the 1930s. It feels like you discovered a secret below ground venue.For this show half of the floor space had tables, but there was plenty of room to stand in front of the stage if you choose. The room was lined with comfy looking booths and more permanent looking tables. I liked that there was a lot to look at beyond the stage with art-decoy ceiling decoration and lighting. Sound was excellent and sight lines were good from all over, including the raised area at the back. I expect to see more than a few live videos shot here in the future.The one thing I never understood about 'rock' concerts in venues like this is the use of a bathroom attendant. Really? Maybe at your more high end events, but not at a rock concert.",,,
9,David M.,"Mt Kisco, NY",133,75,20,5.0,10/12/2018,Good food music drinks just a little pricey but it's midtown so no biggie . Yes it's middle of tourist area lol,1,,
10,Alize P.,"Bronx, NY",1,5,0,4.0,10/14/2018,"Alright folks, it was well worth it!  The show and the food, the orange juice watered down, tea ok, but no unlimited mimosas or at least one mimosa drink at half price from $18, whats a Brunch without Mimosas? Nevertheless, great Gospel entertainment Amen!",1,,
11,Neighborly N.,"New York, NY",0,61,18,5.0,9/29/2018,Awesome performance space with a great view of the stage from any seat in the house. I must make a point of returning often. Highly recommended by me.,,,
12,Marquia F.,"Troy, NY",10,30,17,5.0,4/20/2018,"Came to Sony Hall to see the Read Live with my friends. The food we had (French fries) were extremely good. Crispy on the outside soft on the inside.  My friend fell ill (fainted) during the show and the staff was extremely helpful and attentive making sure my friend gained consciousness and was comfortable. When the incident occurred a second time, they staff was great once again and offered us a chance to come back for the show that is happening tomorrow night. Thank you so much for being accommodating  and helpful while we were at your establishment.  We look forward Tom attending another event at this venue.",3,2,

15,Dee A.,"Tarrytown, NY",0,5,0,2.0,6/25/2018,"Was  there for a concert on Friday. Not a bad location although 46th street is NOTORIOUS for towed cars so make sure you read the signs. Now about Sony Halls, seems to be the new ""Webster hall: just not nearly as big and spacious. Drinks are expensive and water down, my margarita tasted like Sierra Mist.I got VIP for said concert on Friday, at the door they didnt even mind that my ticket was VIP which meant reserved seating, I was just told to go downstairs, I mentioned to some guy who worked there about my ticket, said I could go up some so called vIp said, there was NO reserved seating, most of the people that were sitting and standing around there didnt have VIP tickets, I normally do VIP now because Im beyond the days of getting smooshed by crowds, people stepping on your feet, smoking in your face, spilling drinks on you, just for it not to matter. Waste of $60. Not sure if I would go to that venue again, and IF I do (the artist would have to be amazing) I will never waste money on VIP. They never checked to make sure who has VIP ticket or not and belonged where. Ridiculous.",9,,
16,Joan R.,"Manhattan, NY",15,148,17,3.0,8/23/2018,"I had tickets to see Morris Day at BB King's but when that closed it moved to Sony Hall. First had to walk down a lot of stairs then into a large space with a lot of tables that were too close together. I understand from other posts that the AC was broken but there was no announcement, it was really hot and I think we should have been compensated. Loved the show, the servers were great and loved the sliders and the wine. Not sure if I will go back.",1,,

19,Rosh L.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",2,38,14,5.0,6/20/2018,"Superb ""Dinner Club"" set-up to see your favorite performers...a bit hard to find due to minimal signage but classy and fabulous inside. I enjoyed seeing ""Manhattan Transfer"" perform there this evening. Food is okay, they should hire Stephen Starr to take over that aspect. Other than that, it's a pleasure to sit at a table with others and enjoy a civilized night out. Two thumbs up!",4,1,
20,L L.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,55,95,5.0,6/25/2018,"Went to see the Read Live w/ my two favorite podcasters and the venue did not disappoint. We were late to the show and had bought VIP seating so the staff had us wait while they set us up something special on the balcony with  that were the best in the house but I'm sure I didn't pay enough to have but thanks to staff for making it work and comping a free drink for our wait. The staff buzzed about swiftly and even with spiraling stairs separating us from the crowd they were VERY attentive. Maybe because it was New but it was clean as far as venues go and plenty spacious. Now, the  that made me give this place a 5  rating instead of the 4 I would've given it because although the location is accessible it's hell for out of town parking. There was a tall, aggressive woman that was there on behalf of the talent and she was treating a staff member like shit. She complained about the signage and its placement but was loud and disrespectful of the young man trying to help her. He impressed me. He held his tongue best as possible and although he did not cower he did not return the disrespect dished Out to him. Whoever he is deserves a raise. I'm a product of and consider myself a strong woman but she took full advantage of the dynamic difference in that situation & acted horribly. He was polite, poised but still firm in his own right and for that reason, that stellar staff member you guys get a 5! God bless him & his patience because she could've gotten all that she asked for from him & I wouldn't have blinked an eye.",3,,2
21,Joe N.,"New York, NY",0,20,0,2.0,7/1/2018,"I had the great pleasure of watching Sergio Mendes, the master of Bossa Nova, perform here last night with his wife and great band! Although I loved the show, the space is so congested!! The food is terrible! I actually had to return my salad and the fish taco was inedible! In addition, after the show was over, I actually had to hunt down my server in order to pay. They are obviously short staffed. If they can fix these issues, I will be a regular customer because they book a good variety of performers and it's still less of a zoo than some of the larger venues in the city.",2,1,
22,Yeli M.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/30/2018,"DO NOT COME TO THIS VENUE!!! THEY ARE THIEVES! I went to see a performance in June and decided to sit at a table with my husband, brother and sister in law.  We ordered a few appetizers and some beers.  When the bill arrived I paid for everyone.  We were going to split the bill afterwards.  The next day I noticed that the I was charged not only for my table but for another table as well which totaled 600 dollars!! To my debit card!!  I immediately called my bank to fight this charge and had them send me copies of the receipts because obviously it was a mistake. The bank said Sony Hall denied my dispute. I called Sony Hall several times to try to get this fixed and left several messages to the manager. The person on the phone would either give me the run around and the manager never answered my calls or returned my messages.  I then went in person with my receipts to speak to the manager ERIC.  I showed him my receipts and he saw that it was 2 different tables with different number of guests and one receipt did not have my signature.  He seemed very nice and understanding in person, took my information and assured me I would be refunded immediately.  (I told him i would give him my debit card and he said it was not needed that it would go back with the information he had) 3 weeks later....still no money back..I emailed ERIC the manager.  He said give it a few more days and offered to have me come back for a free show...1 week later still no money back...ERIC now does not respond to any emails and NO i don't want to ever see a show there again!!

Being a fan of Betty LaVette, we have seen her in multiple venues, but seeing her here, we walked out before it was over, the sound system is that bad.  Huge bass, very loud, zero finesse.  Betty asked the sound men for adjustment after the first song, to no avail.  They are one size fits all. She had to scream not sing. Plus there was an unannounced first act, so we had to sit for over an hour waiting for Betty. And they were out of most of their wine choices - what? and waited forever to get a drink.  Never again.",1,,

While the venue itself is nice and the staff is helpful, the amount of people smoking marijuana made the experience unbearable. I don't know what instructions were given to the staff about removing individuals who smoke marijuana, but most of the individuals who were smoking marijuana were standing very close to the stage. My only hope is that the staff and management will do a better job of ensuring people do not smoke marijuana and ruin the experience for others.  The venue is small enough to monitor this behavior.",1,,

After we finally ordered, the waiter came to tell us that the health department just shut them down and there is no food avail at all. They won't let us bring food in either.

Didn't order any other drinks so am unsure of their prices.  I did appreciate that they placed small pitchers of water on all the tables.  The waitress was professional, very attentive, made sure my credit card was charged correctly.  Food arrived quickly. Ordered the tuna sliders, which were small but tasty and perfect for the hot, humid evening.  For dessert, ordered the Crème Brule Cheesecake, which was as decadent as all out!  The food and drink are on the costly side but it was excellent, so no complaints.  For two glasses of wine, the food and dessert, total cost was $64.00, and left a $15.00 tip.  As to the concert, the sound and lighting were perfect, not too loud.   Gordon was in good form, did not keep us waiting, and it was nice to see him again.  This was a great place to see him.  Only downside was that he only played for 90 minutes, but he played all my favorites!I will definitely come back again to see someone else and to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  The only downside is that Sony Hall should invest in better tables/chairs.",4,,1
