The homemade tortilla was a huge plus AND it came with a cookie. They really go the extra mile. I would say it's a little expensive but to me it was worth the few extra bucks. I hear they do great deals on mealpal so maybe I will be doing that soon! Did I mention it comes with a cookie? And the cookie is BOMB? Well it is. Love the entrance. I almost walked into a freight elevator, but I eventually found it. This place reminds me of Its Better Being Underground R.I.P.Just go here.",,,
1,Sammi M.,"New York, NY",188,6,0,4.0,9/8/2018,Got lunch here per reccomendation if a coworker. I ordered the Late Night- really good sandwich! Kind of place your goto for a specialty sandwich. The free cookie was delicious too!I recommend calling in and ordering or ordering from seamless/grub hub. Its literally a kitchen that you get to from the door in between the hotel and planet fitness - definitely worth it!,,,
2,Faith J.,"Madison, NJ",0,7,1,5.0,8/18/2018,"Yum yum yum! Clean and delicious Just ate ""The rancher"" is so dang good Everything I've gotten in the menu has been pretty good. Not one item has been a let down .",,,
3,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",155,353,1310,4.0,10/17/2018,"I discovered this place through Mealpal. I've had a few of  salads and sandwiches. My absolute favorite is the crispy Chinese salad. The chicken is flavorful and actually crispy,  combined with the shredded cabbage and yummy sesame soy dressing is such a delicious crunchy combination. They also give you a delicious cookie with your order. It's totally worth the strange journey of finding this place. Don't come here expecting a place to sit and enjoy your meal, this is strictly a pick up/delivery only place. The staff here is  always nice and friendly.",4,1,2
4,Jane Y.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",289,185,1611,4.0,8/9/2018,"Following a friend's referral link I signed up for Mealpal on a whim.Having had the account and realizing the meals expire based on a 30 day cycle I reminded myself to try it out.The app itself was easy to navigate, selections are plentiful and you enter your location which populates multiple nearby pick up spots.What I didn't expect was the Mealpal pickup was sandwiched in betweeen a hotel and bar in an unmarked glass door, down the stairs of concrete halls and into the back end of a restaurant. A little uneasy getting there and I hesitated a few times on my journey to Mealpal but it was fun seeing post it notes and signage directing you there and joking suggesting they were not a kidnapping ploy. Umm...ok I guess. Not really funny but also eyerolls after the fact because the set up is funny.The burrito was good, freshly prepared and so economical. Not sure I'd jump through hoops for a Mealpal Lunch again but thanks for the jitters. Nothing beats hot humid concrete underground stairways to get to a nyc food program prepped meal.",7,4,6
5,Yuya M.,"Forest Hills, NY",68,102,495,4.0,7/8/2018,I come here frequently using my Mealpal.  Couple of cool things about this place.  It's located on the lower floor next to a hotel and a gym.  It's difficult to locate but there are signs all over once you're inside the building to guide you around.I'm not sure if this location in particular has a seating area because you have to walk through the kitchen area to pick up your mealpal.  The food is always great and the staff are friendly.  They offer two different types of food to pick on a daily basis and the food is really good.Varieties of food include wraps and salads.  It also comes with a cookie!,1,,
6,Aricka L.,"Santa Maria, CA",217,189,553,5.0,6/21/2018,Had breakfast served while we were staying at the renaissance midtown and the avocado toast was the best I've had! My husband had the egg sandwich with a side of bacon (A generous side I must say),2,,3
7,Jonathan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,92,130,2.0,1/16/2018,"TL;DR Frank's favorite - not my favorite. Super salty and drenched in sauce. I will very likely come back and try something else because it has many good reviews. One of the most fun ways to enter a venue.------Entrance: in between renaissance hotel and planet fitness. Black door. Once you go in just follow the signs. The signs are hysterical btw! Venue: you're led into a kitchen and u either place your order to go or pick up if you ordered in advance. My order: Frank's favorite which has crispy fries buffalo chicken, shaved celery, romaine, cherry tomatoes, bleu cheese, flour tortilla.Results: I was not happy. The wrap was drenched in sauce and it was so salty. The sauce felt intense on my tongue and that's when I knew this was packed with sodium. I ended up drinking 6 bottles of water and a cup of tea. My team that went with me saw how I didn't feel well. I'm definitely not getting this again.",2,2,
8,Lina F.,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",154,304,538,3.0,2/28/2018,"I ended up quite dizzy after my journey to pick up my lunch.  For $19, i ordered the rancher (at the suggestion of the staff) and old bay fries.  The rancher had a rather wet, mushy texture.  It was also a bland if it was lathered and bathed in sauces.  The fries were like room service fries since after all this is the hotel kitchen.Many of the orders came from people on Meal Pal and other sites.  Hence the popularity and probably the affordability for the millennials.  I wont be trekking back through the labyrinth of doors and stairs in the future - I am too old for this stuff! Haha",,,
9,Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,112,10,3.0,11/1/2018,"Went here on a meal pal lunch and was super excited to try the rancher because of all the great reviews on yelp. I was excited going down the back alleys to get to the kitchen to pick up my mysterious veggie burger. When I sat down and opened it, I was underwhelmed. When I bit into it, I was underwhelmed. The break was hard and crunchy and the burger was way too dry. When I got some slaw it helped but there wasn't enough. The sandwich is also very small (because of the tough flat bread, a texture I don't want with my burger). The slaw was good but I wish it had more and maybe soaked into the bread a bit. They did give me a cookie which was very tasty but I was still hungry after my burger. I would maybe try it again and get the other veggie sandwich but overall I was very disappointed",,,
10,Lauren T.,"San Francisco, CA",2,7,5,4.0,7/10/2018,"Got a cobb salad here through MealPal. The portion size is on the smaller side but decent if you're not super hungry. It came with a chocolate chip cookie which I didn't know so that was a nice treat.The entrance is a bit obscure. It's situated between a hotel and Plant Fitness. You have to walk through some stairs and corridors to get to what I believe is the back of the kitchen. There is signage to help you get there.Overall, the flavors of the salad were good, but portion is on the smaller size and location makes it difficult to find.",1,,
11,Jessica B.,"Huntington, NY",100,128,113,5.0,8/20/2017,"Ordering from My Belly's Playlist is quite the experience. In case you didn't know, to get to them you have to go through the side door next to the Renaissance hotel on 35th and walk through a series of hallways until you reach the kitchen in the basement. Trust the signs when you go. They'll lead you in the right direction, and it's a fun little adventure. I ordered the Rancher and was not disappointed. Actually, I was a little disappointed because I read an old menu and thought it came with an egg on it, and it did not, but other than that it was delicious. The black bean burger itself was fantastic. It was incredibly flavorful and definitely substantial. There was something about the mixture of  cheese and sauce on the patty that was so creamy. It was so good. The slaw added nice flavor and a good crunch, and the bread was perfect because it was thin and it didn't take away from any of the other flavors.  I also loved that it came with a little cookie, which was also delicious. I will definitely come back!",,,1
12,Danielle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,31,4,4.0,1/10/2018,"I'm always on a hunt for decent lunch places in the area and I stumbled on this random spot on Yelp. The reviews mentioned that it's very much hidden and I LOVE the ""underground"" way of getting there lol. It's in the kitchen of the Renaissance Hotel and the people there are ALWAYS nice and accommodating. Every employee asks if I've been helped and assist me as soon as I pop up in their kitchen lol. I ordered the Chop Me Up salad with grilled chicken today and it was really good. The first thing I ordered a few weeks ago was the Asian salad and idk why I though the base of it would be lettuce but it was cabbage and I wasn't displeased about it. The crispy chicken was nice and crisp and the dry noodles added a great texture. The dressing was also really good but one serving is enough. The chocolate chip cookies are also very yummy, not too crunchy but not soft. I will certainly be back to go through their whole menu",1,,1
13,Clarissa B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",380,147,45,5.0,7/1/2018,"I'm pretty sure business has skyrocketed due to Mealpal. I like to consider it a ""exclusive"" sort of thing where I know the location of this basement hotel pickup area when I order. It's one door down from the Renaissance hotel entrance and down a grunge of stairs. Im sure I could call in and order pickup but I can't find a tastier dish than their Crispy Chinese Chicken Salad on Mealpal. There's something in their sauce which just blows me away every time. The textures in the simple salad- peanuts and greens topped with a portion of panko battered chicken. It sounded fine when I first ordered it but now I obsess over the next time it appears on Mealpal. Their branding is also on point- they stamp their bags and have stickers to label their items in a sort of Alice and Wonderland way. Well I found wonderland and it was in the basement of a hotel down stairs that have seen better days. I've come here probably 6 times and will be back again.",,,
14,Greg A.,"Patchogue, NY",25,20,11,5.0,6/13/2018,"Hands down the best grilled cheese I've ever had. It's definitely hard to find, but worth it. You have to take the door to the right of the hotel, head down a flight of stairs at the end of the hall, head down another hall and enter a kitchen to the right. No storefront or anything, but the staff is friendly and very willing to help. The fries were seasoned deliciously and it was a big serving. Very satisfied.",1,,
15,Baldeep D.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,15,1,5.0,8/30/2018,"Very good place for takeout, and room service from the Renaissance Midtown. Finding it is like solving a maze puzzle, just follow the directions given By several reviewers.",1,,
16,Janice H.,"Flushing, NY",80,15,0,5.0,8/1/2018,"I came here twice for Mealpal. I loved it both times. I've had The Rancher and a burrito. They always add in a chocolate chip cookie which makes me love them even more. The entrance is hard to find and I definitely wandered cluelessly around the hotel lobby for a bit each time, but it's the glass door between the hotel and planet fitness and then follow the signs to the basement.",,,1
17,Thomas K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,5,4.0,11/30/2017,"My Belly's Playlist is a hidden gem. Located in the basement of Renaissance New York Midtown hotel. This little kitchen offer a wide range of meals ranging from Chinese influenced salad, various sandwiches, and a few vegan options.Through my mealpal plan I ordered the Crispy Chinese Chicken Salad. The salad was made up of various cabbages, carrots, peanuts, and very crispy chicken with a sweet sesame dressing.It was delicious and provided a satisfying amount of crunch due to the all the ingredients. Check them out if you have a chance.The only dig I have against MBP is it is located in a sketchy basement which is pretty hard to find. Therefore, I recommend ordering takeout so you don't have to navigate the hotels basement to find your meal.Also they typically provide a cookie with lunch but didn't this time... very disappointing.",,,

I go in thinking I'm gonna sit down but the entrance was through the kitchen, which I thought was pretty cool! Ordered a Belly Burger with fries, tasted great, and the guy helping me was real nice. It's mostly for pick up and delivery so the service was fast. A LOT of people seem to not like that fact that the entrance is a single door between the hotel entrance and Planet Fitness, but those people need to realize that rent is not cheap. Will come back! But I will definitely order delivery.",1,,
20,Isa B.,"New York, NY",131,4,1,5.0,6/17/2018,I just ordered the rancher from here. I really enjoyed it! I love a good black bean burger- the sauce made it extra tasty. It also came with a free cookie (which is a plus)..,,,

First time was the Seoul Food sandwich.. Too much kimchee for my taste but still a good sandwich. 2nd time was the doppelganger which was really tasty! 3rd time big mistake.. Please learn from me and DO NOT order the cheesesteak egg rolls! When I got my bag I noticed it felt light.. I look in the bag and said to myself ""hmm they must have forgotten my food and just gave me the ranch Dipping sauce!"" not realizing my food was in the small container where a dipping sauce could fit! Saddest egg rolls I've ever seen in my life!! I bought them for lunch but didn't know they would be so freaking small.. Like an inch? You get 6 for $10 total waste of money! Plus they were over cooked.. I had to laugh to keep from crying because I'm still hungry!",,,
26,Destiny H.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,22,26,3.0,2/21/2018,Th idea of this place is awesome sauce but I was a little disappointed. To walk around to look for this place was the best part over everything. When I got to the place I felt like I walked in on somebody's restaurant kitchen. I was fine with that but if they had some type waiting area to wait maybe I would have felt better about it. The food was okay but the price was kinda high for what you get but hey that's Manhattan for you lol.,,,
27,K S.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,5,5.0,10/22/2017,Great food! I ordered the Frank's Favorite wrap & the Old Bay Fries for a late night snack thru Uber Eats. They were both delicious & still hot when they arrived! The quality of the crispy chicken was great & the Old Bay seasoning was excellent on the fries. They also include a free chocolate chip cookie when you order a certain amount (apparently not much as I only ordered two items & received the cookie).This is a great go-to for a sandwich or snack. I'll be ordering from them again.,,,
28,John Z.,"New York, NY",8,35,1,4.0,7/21/2017,"A real hidden gem in the heart of the Renaissance Hotel. This restaurant is actually the hotel kitchen, however, if you step outside and go to the first door to the right of Planet Fitness, down this hallway and down a few steps, there it is! The wings are excellent and I got it a couple of times in fact. It is reasonably priced considering it is in Midtown. I would also recommend the burger if you wanted a quick bite. I was mainly here during a business trip, so for fast food I wanted back in my hotel, this was decent.",,,

30,Allison H.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,5,1,5.0,4/20/2018,"This is my favorite lunch place in the city.1. It is fast and part of MealPal but they don't jip you on portions (!!!) 2. Everything I have had on the menu has been genuinely delicious and different from your run of the mill lunch spot. I like the salads particularly -  crispy chinese chicken, belly's cob, and ""chop me up"" are all great.3. MBP has great packaging that makes eating from the containers easy. There is nothing I hate more than the plastic salad bowls packed to the brim preventing you from tossing salad dressing. 4. They give you a cookie with every meal. Who doesn't like a little nosh after a salad...? 5. All employees I have interacted with are friendly and efficient. 6. It is very ""New York"" to have to go on an adventure to pick up your meal (it is located in the basement of the Renaissance Hotel). They have a sense of humor about it and you should too - it's your lunch break after all.Also...I feel like it was fate that I used to work in FiDi and always went to MBP and now I work in midtown where there is an even more convenient MBP. Fingers crossed I will always work in walking distance.",1,,

I got the email notification saying my order was being prepared and should be ready by 1pm. Showed up to the location and couldn't find the door, called the restaurant to ask how to get in and got some very disjointed directions...""walk in the door next to the planet fitness"" (ok this is new York, there are 100 doors on each block). Me - ""So I walk INTO the Renaissance lobby?"" Guy - ""Yes."" (side note, it's not in the Renaissance.) Anywho!Finally got to the basement/kitchen only to have ten different people ask me for my name, flip through pieces of paper to find it, and ask how I ordered. ""Seamless, for pickup."" Insert confused looks. ""Mealpal?"" ""No...Seamless."" ""Seamless and MealPal, yes?"" ""I ordered it on Seamless and here is my confirmation number, I don't know what else to tell you."" Insert MORE confused looks.Long story short, I stood there for exactly 22 minutes while these people spent time running around and trying to figure out where my order was in the system instead of just ACTUALLY MAKING THE SALAD and handing it to me. What's worse is there were no less than five people just standing around while people were fumbling with the computer and papers. I am not sure that they are aware that their business is actually on Seamless.com.Once I got the salad, it did taste good (and so did the cookie), but they still managed to mess it up. They gave me a MOUNTAIN of cabbage and no Romaine, as specified on the menu. Also, my boss ordered from them last week and they sent her something completely different than what she ordered, even though the order ticket and the box had the correct order on it.

Updated review","One of my favorite spots in NYC for sandwiches.  Worth every penny, they deliver, always changing up menu with specials and limited time only items, so there is always something new to try.  They bake up off-the-hook soft baked chocolate chip cookies.  Check picture of chocolate chip cookie sandwich filled with in-house made fluff and dipped in chocolate.  Good bread, quality ingrediants, everything you would want to fill an empty stomach, worth every penny.  Feeling lazy, order delivery on their website!!!",,,

This looked like a good bet, with a great variety of healthy choices. I ordered soup and a kale salad with butternut squash, cranberry and goat cheese with a side of chips. Shortly after my Oder went through they called to let me know my soup choice wasn't available, and offered me 2 others. I made another selection and headed off to pick it up. They called while I was on my way to let me know the order would be ready just a little later than promised. No problem, as I was still on my way. Then, I couldn't find the restaurant! No sign at the address I expected. I have a call and they let me know they are in the Renaissance Hotel, and if I just waited in the lobby they'd bring it to me. After only a short wait they appeared with a bag of goodness. The cheddar corn soup was delicious, and I'm only halfway through the salad and grabbed my phone to write this review. Bonus: a cookie in my bag!Will remember them when I'm in the neighborhood.",,,

The chicken patty that they used had a terrible texture, was overly salty, and tasted like something that was manufactured in a lab.  The glazed donut was of poor quality and fell apart complete within seconds of picking it up. On the bright side, at least they didn't screw up the egg. I would save your money on this one. Not worth it if it was free.",,,
49,Alaina H.,"New York, NY",18,4,0,5.0,2/8/2017,"This is a perfect hidden gem in Midtown West. I order from them through MealPal almost 3x a week for lunch. At first I was sketched out because it directs you to pick up your order in the basement of the Radisson Hotel. After going once, I realized how friendly and attentive the staff was in getting my delicious order ready to go. First of all, the cookies that are always included in my lunch are to-die-for. My favorite dish so far has been this Asian Cabbage Chicken Salad (contains peanuts). It's a different style of salad and they give you the peanut dressing on the side, but overall its really tasty (and healthy!. Highly recommend checking this place out!",,,
