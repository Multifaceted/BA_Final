0,Lauren R.,"Gainesville, FL",26,1,0.0,5.0,11/10/2018,"I went to Bar Centrale with my husband and daughter the last time we were in New York. We read ahead about the importance of making a reservation exactly one week ahead, which we did. There are several people on here that have given one star reviews, because they walked in without a reservation, saw empty tables, and were upset if they were rushed to finish their drinks. These reviewers do not understand that the reservations being held are for after theatre tables, so they need to sit empty or those without reservation need to hurry up for those people showing up after their show to have their table. It's a pretty small place, so every table is accounted for. It was a real blast. We had champagne, oysters, nachos, and a few other appetizers. all were fresh and delicious. Just what we needed for a late night snack after our show, which was Anastasia. We were seated in the front room near the bar. I think the actors are likely to be seated in the back room. After we had been there for a while, we were excited to spot Laura Linney as she was leaving. The next time I go, I will ask to be seated in the back room!I also see some reviewers complaining that their food, such as pasta, came from the restaurant next door. Well the restaurant next door is Joe Allen, and Bar Centrale and Joe Allen are owned by the same people. If that's where some of the dishes come from, that makes sense--expands the menu if you can get some items off the Joe Allen menu. I would not be worried about that.",,,
1,Kelsey H.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,5,1,5.0,5/29/2018,"Call for reservations 1 week in advance. When we called for reservations, we told the hostess what show we were seeing and she knew exactly what time to put us down for. It's a cozy, convenient, affordable, little spot to have drinks and food after a show. This theater district bar as a great vibe and ambiance. I will definitely be back!",,,
2,Brad H.,Fair Play,65,459,93,5.0,5/12/2018,"A cool speakeasy in the Theater District... Call ahead exactly one week before for reservations since they don't take them further out.  We stopped in before our show on a Tuesday night and the place was full.  I expect the same is true any night, so don't attempt without reservations.Remember the address since the number on the door is the only indication that you are there.  It looks to be a brownstone apartment from the outside...The food, as one might expect, is better than most bars.  We had lobster and shrimp dumplings followed by skirt steak.  Both were well presented and tasty.  They were on the small side, but this isn't about the food.Yes it's a bar... Drinks were expertly prepared and generously mixed.  Service was pleasant.I suggest that gentlemen wear a jacket, but it's not required.If you are here to see a play and want a refined bar to enjoy before or  after, I highly recommend Bar Centrale.",,,
3,Johnny P.,"Bronx, NY",0,28,16,5.0,10/12/2018,"Up the unmarked staircase between Orso and Joe Allen is this little hideaway, away from the throngs of Restaurant Row- just looking down on them all if you get a table up front near the windows. An excellent place for drinks with a pleasantly restrained friendliness from the staff and a tasteful yet unobtrusive music soundtrack to make it all the more delightful. The Manhattans were delicious too. A class act.",,,
4,Samantha K.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,161,42,5.0,4/8/2018,"A friend wanted to go here and made us a reservation, we were a bit late for it (which we acknowledged when we walked in) and they were very nice about it. The hostess was super pleasant and we had a personable chat about where we were coming from and what we thought of the show. The man doing coat check was equally friendly. The atmosphere is dim but not dark and it's go a very intimate vibe, lots of seating and a nice bar set up. The booth we were given for 3 (with a 4 person reservation and a latecomer) was spacious and beautiful. The music was either unobtrusive or not present, I simply can't remember, but it made it easy and nice to have a conversation. Our waiter was one of the nicest I've ever had in the city. Not only was he knowledgeable but his timing was always perfect, and even stopped to talk with us for a few minutes. We got the chickpea fries and the deviled eggs, both of which were fantastic and full of flavor. The way the drinks are served is innovative and the presentation is excellent. We were not rushed out even when we stayed well past closing (I didn't realize it has gotten so late, I don't like keeping the staff past posted hours). There were still other guests there at the time and the staff was pleasant to everyone. I will definitely be back here! I'm a little appalled by how many one star reviews I see on here, I was so excited to write a positive review, we had a great time!",,,
5,Justin R.,"New York, NY",170,3,0,1.0,10/25/2018,"I've never felt more unwelcome, more uncomfortable, and more rushed to leave an establishment.  3 friends and I arrived around 8:30pm on a Thursday night. The place was practically empty yet we were told that they weren't sure they could even seat us because every table was ""reserved"" for the ""after theatre crowd"".  After the hostesses considered seating us at the bar, she finally decided to seat us in one of their several empty booths.  We  ordered food and a round of drinks.  The waitress was clearly annoyed when we ordered a second round and reiterated that we had to leave by 10pm.  I am so sorry we even stepped foot in this place... don't waste your time and money here.  Not worth the price and the anxiety.",,,
6,Vaani S.,"San Diego, CA",1091,244,582,4.0,5/22/2017,"This place will give you an okay-ish speakeasy vibe.Food: Not that great but I guess you are not going there for the food.Drinks: Strong. Nice and flavorful. The whiskey sour was good.Ambiance: A cool dark place. Looks neat and posh.Staff: The waiter was not very skilled, he could not tell what was special there, he would run to the menu every time we asked for some suggestion.In-all: it's a little toward the pricey side but the place is a treat.Recommendation: As you can see that there is not much to write about this place so I would say, take a judgment call, though I assure you didn't miss out on anything if you skipped the place. Though there is nothing special about this place, it's just a good feeling sitting there and sipping on your drink over a long conversation. Would say it is more of a ""Date night"" kinda place.",1,1,1

However, the hostess was rude and condescending. I get it, it's supposed to be a ""hidden"" spot but being rude does not make it special or exclusive. They would do themselves a favor by getting friendlier staff to be at the front of the house.",4,,
11,Thomas M.,"New York, NY",0,35,74,5.0,11/25/2017,"Bar Centrale is just awesome. The service is great and the atmosphere is quintessential old New York but go for the food. The small plates are just fantastic. The guacamole is better than what you find in most Mexican restaurants, the shrimp and Chinese mushroom dumplings have a delicate wrapper, are plump and delicious, and the charred skirt steak has a perfect crust and is tender and juicy. The drinks also deserve high marks! Although a pre/post theater favorite, make it a point to go when you are not going to the theater and enjoy the experience.",2,,

17,Jessica S.,"Providence, RI",0,10,1,1.0,11/5/2017,"Saturday night after seeing a great show, we found Bar Centrale on Yelp and decided to try it out. Cool, inconspicuous entrance. And that's the only good thing in my review of the place.. The hostess was rude! We walked in without reservations, the bar was pretty empty but apparently reservations are needed regardless. The hostess did not convey that information in a friendly manner. She is the type of person that makes you truly dislike the humanity that exists in NYC. Bourbon Street is definitely much friendlier and has an amazing interior structure.",3,,
18,Tyler S.,"Las Vegas, NV",87,19,15,5.0,8/7/2017,"Such a cool little place right down the street from the Richard Rodgers theatre. We went here right after seeing Hamilton. I had a very good whiskey sour, potato skins, and corn on the cobb. This place is the perfect hidden gem in NYC.",,,

20,KieRsten A.,"Forked River, NJ",75,2,0,1.0,1/29/2017,"I wish I was able to say that my drinks were wonderfully handcrafted, but I could not say that at all. My husband and I went on a hunt to find this place for my birthday, since we both love speakeasies so much! However, this place did not allow us to give it a try.When we walked in at about 830, there were about 5 people at the bar and there were more than a few open tables, it was practically the whole place to be precise. The woman asked us if we had a reservation and we did not, so we left. The unfortunate part about this is that I understand the concept of the speakeasy, your goal is to keep it hidden and  to keep your regulars, but what happens when your regulars don't exist anymore, what will happen, when you will need to fill these gaps with new customers?I was highly disappointed about this place, since I took my husband to Philly to go and find speakeasies there and we spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars, and here we could not even get our foot in the door here. Maybe it was better off that we went to another hidden gem that served us great cocktails and gladly accepted our business.",3,3,
21,Greg S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,33,0,1.0,12/15/2016,"Walked in at 9:15 for a cocktail.  They're known for their Sidecars.   The bar was full, save one seat, but EVERY table in the joint was empty.  Oh, they don't allow standing.  The less than friendly woman who works the front door decided we weren't going to have a drink.  She said the tables were all booked.  I reminded her we just wanted a cocktail.  It wasn't even 9:20 and even if a post-theatre rush was on the books, it wasn't gonna materialize for another hour.  There were eight empty tables.   Eight.  Was everyone pouring in at 9:30.   If they had a private party, a plausible excuse, she sure didn't offer it up.  Don't know why they're so mean.  But you know when you're being lied to and I didn't appreciate it.  Came back to our hotel where a jazz combo was playing in the lobby bar and had a much better time there.",10,3,
22,Cathy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",294,408,1172,2.0,1/14/2015,"Very hard place to find. I'm not sure if there is usually a sign here normally but when we went there was no sign and it looked like we were going up to someone's townhouse. I expected a speakeasy-ish type bar because of the entrance. The menu had no description of the drinks. When we asked the waitress what was in each drink, we thought she would be happy to teach us about the drinks as they usually are in other speakeasies. However, she impatiently said well cosmo is ____, manhattan is ___ and acted like we should know what they were. My friend and I proceeded to tell her we know what those are since they are common but other non-common drinks we didn't know. In the end, we had to google the ingredients in the rest of the drinks. It wasn't like she was busy either as we were the only ones there. I ordered potato skins as an appetizer and I would not recommend that as it was a dollar a potato skin and it was nothing that a regular sports bar could serve for half the price.",4,3,2
23,Ying D.,"Manhattan, NY",49,3,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"If I could rate a half star, I would have done that for its food and wine. The post-sales service was horrible. I accidentally took the wine glass with me when I said hello to my friend at the bar gate and some woman just took away my glass of wine right from my hand in front of my friend without asking me if I would like to put it back on my table. That was horribly rude and embarrassing. I would never recommend this bar to my friends anyway.",2,,
24,Danielle F.,"Orange County, CA",624,418,642,1.0,8/10/2016,"Oh Bar Centrale how I wanted to like you SO much, but your hostess with the super short brown hair ruined that for me. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think you're exactly my vibe. I just can't seem to gel with an establishment that yells at their patrons. It's too bad because I was ready to chill there all night and buy all the drinks. This was our first visit and yes, I understand it was a high class place, but there is zero need for a hostess to bark at a customer regardless of the situation. My sister, friend and I were dining and drinking when my sister spotted a famous person. This being her first visit to NY, she was excited. She jumped up and asked for a picture. She chatted with him for a few minutes then he left. The super short haired hostess was having a drink at the bar and raised her voice to my sister as she walked by, ""just so you know, we don't do that here, don't ever do that again"". But it was in the most condescending tone ever. So, here is what was irritating... Her tone & the fact that there was no way anyone should have known these supposed rules ahead of time. We were all infuriated at the tone and rudeness of the hostess that we wanted to leave as fast as we could. We paid the bill and upon exiting, my sister apologized for her excitement, but suggested that the hostess was rude with how she instructed her to behave; to which she replied, ""ok"".At this point my blood was boiling with the fact that I had given this establishment any amount of money to breed this type of customer interaction from its employees. I couldn't wait to head down the street to a less pretentious bar, with far less attitude. I 100% understand that the hostess was upset that my sister approached the famous person; however, THE FAMOUS PERSON WAS HAPPY TO OBLIGE!Also, there was literally no way for anyone to know that ""we don't do that here"". There aren't any rules posted and if that is in fact the case, when seating us, she could have politely explained that if we see a famous person to sit tight. She really put a damper on our evening. Maybe it was because she was drinking while working or because she was on a nightly power trip, but she had issues. Home girl needs to learn to assume innocence instead if yelling at a customer. Definitely WILL NOT be back. Waste of money and time. Thumbs way down.",24,14,7

You can sit at the bar, the tables, or for larger groups, at the booths. I would not recommend coming in groups larger than 4.They don't have a cocktail menu but they have the standard drinks. I had a cosmo and it came in a glass and a small pitcher with extra cosmo, submerged in ice. That way, the extra cosmo would remain cold. Love it. Drinks were $16 a piece which is quite standard for Speakeasies. At least it was strong so one strong drink + empty stomach = tipsy.",8,2,4

My Wife and I travel the world for work and for pleasure, making a point to seek out the local speakeasies everywhere we go. While we recognize that the idea of a speakeasy calls for exclusivity, we were shocked by how poorly we were treated- in our own neighborhood of all places. Upon arrival, without a reservation to be fair, we were told there was no availability.. despite every single table being empty. We accepted the ""fact"" that every table was ""reserved"" and decided to take a detour to another bar. While we enjoyed a drink elsewhere, we decided to give them a call to ask for availability over the course of the night. We were told there was none. You know how sometimes you can just feel you're being lied to? This was that. As previously mentioned, we visit exclusive bars all the time.. we know when a hostess is faking ""capacity"". The hostess working the door was unpleasant at best, and the bar itself had absolutely no personality whatsoever. It was a room full of bottles of liquor- nothing more, nothing less.

48,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,5.0,7/15/2013,"Swanky but casual hidden cocktail lounge in an old townhouse. No seriously, you might walk right past this place if you really don't know to climb the front steps of what looks like someone's home and push in the front door, part the velvet curtain, and peek inside. Amal D and I felt like Scooby Doo and the gang investigating some haunted house that we were not supposed to be entering. So glad we did though as we enjoyed an outstanding evening here!Sure, it's a bit pretentious as we were greeted by a lady who asked if we had reservations. Even though the place was empty I decided to play along with the game. In a polite manner and charming smile I explained that we didn't have any but if there was a way to squeeze us in we would be grateful. She offered us a spot at the bar and we happily took a few seats. Personally, I enjoy being at the bar anyway. You get to watch the mixology, and chat with the bartender who was a really cool dude. You get to take it all in at the bar. As old standards from the 40's played overhead, and the small flat screen above the bar had on a vintage b/w Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn movie it really set the tone and ambiance for enjoying the two Old Fashioneds we ordered to drink.As the night progressed we became a bit hungry. I had noticed some tasty plates of food coming out to those around us. They offer a small menu of eclectic bar bites and some entrees. We ordered a few. Curried Deviled Eggs were delicious, and the Maine Lobster & Jumbo Lump Crab Meat Sliders were awesome! I really wanted to take pictures but put away the camera phone as I did not want to look like a tourist. We just kicked back and enjoyed the moment. Plus, the service was great. Our food came out lightning fast, and the bartender took care of us all evening. We never felt rushed or pressured to finish up.   Bar Centrale is one of those speakeasies that is cozy and comfortable. Above a place called Joe Allen. It's a sexy little enclave. A mix of booths and small tables to sit at. Kind of a retro 40's appeal and look. Reservations are suggested. Expect speakeasy prices here but pretty much the norm for this type of NYC establishment. If you can't handle the prices, or pretension, better off hitting one of the cheaper dive bars in Hells Kitchen a few feet away. It's a terrific spot for a pre or post theater cocktail and bite to eat, and a hidden gem among the Theater District restaurant row establishments. I'm all about these kinds of bars, just as much as I love a good dive or pub. Just deal with the pretentious air of getting a seat and you are in for a nice time. Definitely a place to escape the Times Square madness, for a date, or fun night out with a friend or two. Plus, you just might catch a few celebrities or Broadway elite in here. Just this evening it seemed half the cast of Mad Men were in here enjoying some cocktails. Boom!",11,8,10

The service was sufficient enough but he was wearing torn up black pants and offered zero server qualities (eg. personality). He was simply an order taker and managed to mess that up. He drops the wine off and says ""this is a no service restaurant - you can pour it yourselves. As much or little as you want"". That's fine with me -- the bottles were affordable and I can manage that.Takes our order -- forgets to ring 1 item in. Again -- no complaints to him. I simply asked where it was. No apologies offered except ""Yeah - it'll be just a minute"". 5 Minutes later it came out but we'd almost finished out mains by then. We accepted it of course but again -- no f*cks given by the server.The food is the major issue. $18 for a rock hard, cold chunk of Salmon thrown on the pinch of Arugula? Terrible. It was sooooo over-cooked and straight from a VERY cold fridge. Chick Pea fries were flavourless (great idea just not executed well). Hummus and Veg plate was a small handful of vegetables for $14. I can go on and on as we ordered quite a few items. Nothing was memorable aside from the bad service.They hand write all their cheques which makes it all very questionable. This isn't a small diner where my bill is $15. They won't split bills or even let you keep a copy of it. Honestly - this places needs to focus on their customer experience. There's a lot of competition out there and you're barely visible on 46th.",4,,

And we actually wouldn't have even gone in (it looks like the entrance to a townhouse) except we saw other people walking in.We sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails and split the crab cake sliders. The sliders, though small (only came with two), were really good as they weren't loaded down with dressing, and the crab was VERY fresh.

Atmosphere: The place was nice and cosy, but aside from that,  everything was terrible from the service to food. First, we were ""greeted"" with utter rudeness. Our friends had made reservations earlier that day, and were seated across from the door. Upon entering, we mentioned the reso name to the hostess, she said that she did not have them on the list. So we pointed to where they were sitting with a description of what they looked like, she walked past them to a random stranger at the bar, came back and said that no such person existed... Food: We ordered a hummus and vegetables appetizer. Being middle-eastern and having prepared hummus many times, this tasted nothing like hummus, it was simply a bowl of blended can of chickpeas; I didn't taste a hint of tahini, garlic, or lemon juice.  We also ordered a plate of salsa and chips, the salsa was TOO spicy - again, as a middle-eastern we can handle our spices. This was terrible. We had a thin crust pizza, it wasn't too bad.Unfortunately, gratuity was included in the check, otherwise we wouldn't have paid as much of a tip as we were forced to pay. Also we were a table with 5 people, and they wouldn't take more than two credit cards, which I've never problems with in any other restaurant.",4,,

As if that wasn't bad enough my friend ordered the lobster quesadilla and has been violently ill since for 3 days.  I called the restaurant on Sunday and Manager just said she was sorry and that she hadn't heard of any complaints from anyone else and that was that.

Updated review","I love the idea of a speakeasy, and when we found ourselves with some extra time before a Broadway show, I said ""I know a great speakeasy in this area where we can get a pre-theatre cocktail.""  It was my second time here, and thank goodness, because it is the type of unmarked place, found on the 2nd floor of a brownstone, above a restaurant, and you can easily walk past it.  There are no drink menus - Bar Centrale specializes in classic cocktails like the Cosmopolitan, the Manhattan and the Sidecar.  We had decided to sit at the bar.  Sitting at the bar is great if you don't know what cocktail to get - and gives you the closeness to ask the bartender what he or she is best at making.  Our bartender for the evening said he specialized in the Cosmo and the Manhattan, but that a lot of people come to Bar Centrale and ask for the Sidecar.  Cosmos are my go-to drink of choice, but I decided to try something new, so I went with the Manhattan.  It was pretty good and very strong.  I forgot how expensive it could be here, $14 for a drink - but the presentation is always a hoot.  You get your glass and a side carafe in ice, but don't use the ice for your drink - it's there just to keep your drink cold and contains a little bit of salt.",,1,
70,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",51,755,127,4.0,2/18/2011,"If you're in times square and looking for a quiet respite from the touristy madness, Bar Centrale is your place.  In an unmarked building upstairs from Joe Allen's you'll find spacious rooms and plenty of tables for 4 where you can get excellently made standards like Side Cars and Rye Manhattans.  As a nice touch, they serve up half your drink in a small glass, and keep the other half on (not in) ice so it stays cold.The staff however is wholly unimaginative.  When asked for something ""citrus-y with gin and st. germain"", they look confused, ask for more direction, and then you literally get back a drink with gin, st. germain, and lemon juice.  So stay away if you're looking for creativity and inspiration but if you know exactly what you want, come on in!",3,,1

Despite the fact that we had made a reservation, we were greeted with rude service, including a constant reminder of the reservation they had for the table at 10:30pm. Eventually we were full-on pushed out of the table, despite there being several other tables open at the moment.The place was filled with B-List Celebrities, so the staff must think they are too cool to care about everyone else. The drinks are wildly overpriced, and the food was too spicy. They should learn to space their reservations out properly, and teach their service staff some manners.",1,,

I kept having visions of Bogart greeting me in a white tux. While it's classy it didn't feel too highbrow or pretentious. They let me in so it's obviously not that exclusive (I'm pretty sure I only got in because of my cooler, classier companion Madhuri ).Just to be clear, while it is an unmarked speakeasy, they do traditional cocktails here. Sidecars, Manhattans and Cosmos (?). You won't find the more exotic cocktails (like at Huckleberry, DOC) here.Fine with me because the sidecar was best I've ever had. I was a little taken back when bartender instructed me on how to drink it,  but seeing the presentation of the drink in a beaker on ice, glass with sugared rim, it was obvious he was a perfectionist. I usually like to sample a few different things but I stuck with the sidecar because it was so good.The food was a mixed bag. The fish taco was very good, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The guacamole was well guacamole. It wasn't bad but didn't really stand out.The worst part of the night is leaving here, pushing through the throngs of people on your way to subway realizing you are in fact still in Times Square.",7,4,8

Inside is nice and the drinks were pretty good, but kinda lackluster in total. Not a bad place, but definitely not somewhere I'd rave about.

So many food-items were cold -- but I doubt this is the reason the chips were extremely stale or the hard-boiled eggs were extremely over-cooked (not to mentioned EXTREMELY over-priced), or the tartares were still cold in the middle (they should at least be room temperature!), or that everything else was just bland bland bland...Our waitress was extremely inaccurate, lacking any attention to detail whatsoever -- I ordered a Sapphire and Soda but was given a Tanqueray and Tonic (which isn't an easy mistake to make, right? or maybe it's just me...) and my friend ordered a Clausthaler but was given a Stella Artois, and after he sent it back he was then (believe it or not) brought-out an Anchor Steam...Despite all the many errors and confusions and misunderstandings, nothing was ever offered to us ""on the house"" or complementary... And nothing here is cheap... Yet we had to wait and wait and wait, yet there was confusion after confusion after confusion...And then there's the ordeal with our waitress constantly auditioning for my table-mates... A spin here, a leap there, some horrible antiquated rendition of some line from whatever thing whenever it was absolutely least appropriate...And then there were the buffoons who tumbled and stumbled on their way to and from the W.C. -- yes, they call it a Water Closet, and since there's absolutely nothing warm or charming about this place whatsoever, at least to me, it basically makes this place come across as the most affected self-involved least-gracious ""poseurs"" I've experienced in ages...

Apparently this place prides itself on classic cocktails, so we ordered sidecars-- my favorite drink. However, the drink was much too sweet and I couldn't finish mine (this never happens to me.) A good sidecar should only get its sweetness from the sugar on the rim, not fro the drink itself, and I feel like they sugared up the actual cocktail.It's a cool space inside, but I felt like there was a disconnect with what this place should be and what it actually is. For a ""hidden"" spot, I wanted it to be set up more like a cozy, sexy bar- not a restaurant with diner-style booths and overly bright lighting. I wouldn't really think of it as a restaurant, but when we first sat down we were presented with food menus, and we had to ask for cocktail menus.

Contrary to what others have written, I found the staff to be quite friendly and chatty as I sipped on my raspberry something and vodka concoction. The shaker contained enough for two martini glasses full, so at $16 I didn't find that price daunting. The only suggestion I'd make would be if you're not going to provide a drink menu, the bartender should have some suggestions ready for the newcomer instead of the fallback line of ""I can make anything you want.""",,,1

It's easy to find, despite not being marked and has a cool, low key vibe. We ordered a charcuterie plate and the chickpea fries, which we were all impressed by. The glasses of wine are actually small carafes of wine, so you really get about 2 glasses per order. The only downside is that the staff was really condescending and rude throughout the evening. The hostess proclaimed that there were not any tables available since we'd not made a reservation, yet the place remained empty save two tables for the entirety of the three hours we were there. The bartender was short, lacked any kind of charm, was indifferent to requests for information on the menu, and became irritable and rude when glasses were needed to read the check. In the future, I'd skip it and check out the multitude of other spots on this street.",3,,

95,Dennis S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/10/2016,"I've never been treated so rudely by a restaurant in my entire life. We arrived with reservations previously made and all we asked was for a booth. It was very clear that the hostess with the blond hair had no intention to accommodate us. In fact her rudeness was beyond belief for someone in the hospitality industry. She said that all the other tables were reserved. However when I asked whether we could reserve a booth for the subsequent night she indicated that there are no reservations for the Booths and that she determines who sits where. Perhaps if I gave her a $50 bill we would've been able to sit at a booth. Her attitude and telling us "" I Gave you two tables to choose from and that's it! "" This is below description of rudeness. We chose to leave.  I think New Yorkers could spend their money and better establishments that really care about customer service.

When you get in there is a nice lounge area and the atmosphere is great. We were lucky when they took us in as a walk in. Later we found out that to make a reservation you should call well a week in advance. The Tapas were excellent. We had oysters, Fish tacos and steak sliders. All very good.

If I'm spending this kind of cash on drinks, I should not know more about the drinks than the bartender.  I'm sorry, yes, I describe myself as a bit of a liquor nerd, but at a place like this, the cocktails should 1) Be measured, so that the portions are correct and the drink itself is tasty. 2) Have a larger selection of base products, I should have a selection of Ryes for my Manhattan.  Not just one - Oh and the Marker's Mark.

99,Patricia C.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",26,9,12,5.0,12/3/2010,"Bar Centrale, oh how I love you. Your speakeasy entry up the steep, curved-edge steps of a brownstone immediately transports me from the garish glare emanating from the surrounding Theater District to a more civilized, cultured place and time.The heavy velvet curtain parts and the always pleasant hostess greets me. I've called ahead to inquire about whether there's room for two, usually, and now that we've arrived we check our coats and step up into the anteroom. In the distance zebra-covered high bar stools beckon as black and white classic movies with the likes of Humphrey Bogart play on a small corner tv. These touches of flair are mellowed by a tasteful decor of wooden tables, low-backed chairs and a fleet of commodious booths covered in a luscious, touchable fabric. Be sure to check out the matchbooks from historic NYC hotels and restaurants under the glass of the large table by the bar.The wine list impresses me, and I've had a generous carafe or two over the course of my visits. But lately I've enjoyed the classic cocktails, such as the Sidecar, made by the nattily-groomed bartender. A flared edge highball glass thickly rimmed with sugar arrives filled with an inch of the citrusy elixir, and it's accompanied by a glass that's been converted into an ice bucket to keep a tiny carafe of more chilled. This amounts to two drinks, easily.The slim, leather covered menu opens to reveal a wide range of small plates, and my favorite is the fish tacos, which are served with little piles of finely chopped tomato and red onion and a bottle of green hot sauce. The first time I visited I was impressed that the housemade hummus was served with unusual vegetables like fennel, radish, endive.  I always appreciate these upscale, refining touches--they make the food well worth the price tag. Good food in small portions costs more to restaurants to make, which I gladly pay so that I can have wide-ranging options.  Your staff is phenomenal. They have personality and humor, often, yet are unobtrusive and efficient. Plus, they look quite official in their white shirtwaists and black ties. There's many a night that I've been there as the entertainers--often quite famous-- from nearby shows quietly slip past to a table in the back. But moreso, I love you for being the ideal setting for fantastic, deep conversations punctuated with belly laughs and enabled by your gracious, refined, accessible surroundings.",2,,

Anyway, the place was nice and intimate. My friend had been there many times and knew the woman at the door. She allowed us to join the people we were meeting at their table. As I walked in I saw the who's who of the broadway and off broadway community (celebrities, I suppose).  It was surreal for me.  Our table already had drinks and I ordered a glass of merlot. It was delicious! The server was attentive to our table (though I'm not sure if that's because of who I was with). The food was ok, though nothing amazing.  I'd really like to come back to Bar Centrale before the shows let out when they let in the 'everyday Jane and Joe's'.  I didn't pay for my drinks so I'm not sure how reasonable the prices were but because of the 'exclusivity' of the joint, I'd assume they'd be in the higher price range.

Allen & Delancey).  BC reminds me of a modernized Lenox Lounge--art deco-style in design, done up in a purple and zebra-skin palette.  They have a full bar, and though our eyebrows raised in worry when our server told us they were known for their cosmopolitans, they actually made a delicious Manhattan that pleased even J, who is no softy when it comes to classic cocktail evaluation.  The menu is an amusingly eclectic mix of simple comfort food--shrimp cocktail, guacamole, grilled cheese with bacon, steak tartare, veggies & hummus, pizza.  My lamb meatballs, though under-seasoned, were fresh and tasty, and our sauteed brussel sprouts with pancetta were excellent.

When I get a recommendation of a new spot I give it a try. Bar Centrale was the most recent suggestion of a friend who spends a lot of time in the New York's Theater District.When we were in the area we decided to give it a try. One thing to remember; any place you want to visit in the Theater District will be packed before and after the show times so go around 8 pm the curtain call. Bar Centrale is located on the 46th street between Eight and Ninth avenues, also called the Restaurant Row where restaurants of various cuisines line both sides of the street. You won't see a sign on the door but the Bar Centrale is located next door to Joe Allen's restaurant. Walk up the steps to a pair of impressive doors and enter. During the colder months you have to make your way through a really thick black velvet curtain. Once in you'll be able to check your coat and step in to room where time seemed to stop in the New York's glamorous times. Cool jazz is the soundtrack to the 50s black and white movies playing over the bar.Bar Centrale requires reservations unless you go there at their off-peak times which are during the theater but you will have to finish up by quarter to 10, people with reservations will start coming in after their shows around 10 pm. Because we didn't have a reservation our hostess sat us to one of the few booths available with the condition that we will need to clear it by 9:45. We were there only for couple of drinks anyway so it was better than we expected.Overall we ordered two rounds of Martinis. We weren't going to order any food but once the vodka started to make its way to our heads and more we looked at the menu hungrier we got. We decided to order the Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, watercress vinaigrette and pizza bread crackers for $16, Guacamole with corn tortilla chips for $13, Lamb Meatballs in tomato and basil sauce for $14, Flatbread Pizza with mushroom, goat cheese, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and truffle oil for $14 and Baja Style Fish Tacos for $16.  We would have ordered more but we were already getting the full. Next time we'll definitely try the Lobster Roll and the Pork Sandwich, they certainly look delicious being served at the next booth. We thought that the food seemed a little more expensive than comparable places but then again this is an upscale location with an impressive ambiance so you do get what you pay for.",2,,

130,J S.,"Alexandria, VA",186,350,72,4.0,5/30/2010,"We were in the area and needed to eat.  A couple of friends in our group of 6 had heard of this unmarked place so we decided to see if we could get in.  It was around 8 on Saturday night and we had to be out by 10 since the table was reserved but it gave us enough time to enjoy a few drinks and get a ton of plates.  We tried the chorizo, guacamole, flatbread, samosas, steak sliders, and grilled cheese.  All of it was solid and pretty tasty.  The wine selection is really nice and comes in a 1 1/2 glass serving.  Overall I'll definitely be back if we can get in - nice atmosphere (if not a little bit stuffy), good food, and away from the crazy theater crowd.",1,,1
131,kiley b.,"Atlanta, GA",1,2,0,1.0,7/15/2012,"I would give this place zero stars if I could. The owner was incredibly rude after refusing to accept more than two credit cards from our group. This was in spite of the fact that (a) there were no other full tables in the entire place at 10 pm and (b) they had made no mention of this policy when our large party reservation was made or when our table was sat. While the waiter was nice, the food was very mediocre. Most importantly, I was truly blown away by how rude the owner was to our group. There are many fabulous bar/restaurants in New York, so spare yourself the risk of having a bad experience at this one.",,1,1
132,sue l.,"New York, NY",1,25,9,5.0,12/16/2010,"one of my favorite places in hells kitchen.  yes, they can be a little pretentious but i think they need to be sometimes.  often see a lot of pseudo celebs here and they try really hard to keep it a nice quiet classy joint.  just make a reservation in advance and you'll be fine.  if you go on a friday night without one, you cant even have a drink at the bar as even the bar stools are reserved.that said, the drinks are amazing, as is the food.  love the empanadas and the shrimp quesadilla. not a huge fan of the cheese plate here though. drinks - sidecars and martinis are perfection.  and the staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  :)",,,

But don't get too drunk, or you'll end up unable to look away from Broadway's A-list. Or perhaps you will have a great chat with Megan Mullally and get checked out by Bob Saget. Oh wait, you're not me. Ha. I totally puked that night.",4,12,6

The fancy takes on fast food, the fact that there's no sign. That being said, the service was excellent and the food was pretty good. Might I recommend the sauteed chorizo?",,,
136,Hilary L.,"New York, NY",26,48,0,4.0,3/20/2009,Hard to find so it keeps out the average pre and post theatre riff-raff; the bartender makes a MEAN vodka soda; they have funky tiger striped bar stools that I would own if I were rich.,2,,1

138,Kenna T.,"San Francisco, CA",75,173,1,4.0,4/22/2009,"i was there twice last night - pre- and post- HAIR. i know that sounds weird, but the first time i was there with my friend and then we talked it up so much when we met our other friends at the thee-ah-tah that they wanted to go after.the first time we sat at the bar, had champagne and a sidecar and then the cheese plate. yummy. the bartender was courteous and friendly. the second time there were no openings at the bar, and the hostess told us that all the tables were taken. sad face. but, when we were leaving, she came out and told us that there was a cancellation. woopeee!so in we went, around the corner and to the back, and the four of us sat cozy-like at a mini couch and mini wheely chairs. we got more champagne and more sidecars, lobster quesadillas and potato skins were ordered by my table mates, i tried to eat the tabbouleh but for me it was too salty, even with the feta on the side. oh well, it was nice they had a few vegetarian options on the menu! and i think there were hooks in the bathroom, but since there is a coat check as soon as you walk in, and i left my purse with my friends, i admit that i was less than my normal eagle-eye-mcgee on checking out the hook sitch. there are hooks under the bar, sweet.so we admired the decor and the upscale crowd and yes even the A list celebrity that i chatted to on our way out was super handsome and funny and charming and had a *fantastic* man purse. thanks bubba for the reco. keep 'em coming, yo!",1,,1

140,Matt D.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,4.0,3/2/2010,"Rock solid for the location. About 11 seats at the bar and 10 four-tops. Reservations required during pre-theater if you want to eat. Food looked quite good. Excellent cocktails as everyone has said. If I'm in this neighborhood, I'm definitely going back.",,,

143,Clint A.,"Long Island City, NY",29,113,3,4.0,10/28/2007,"As stated by the last reviewer, this place is impossible to find which is my kind of place. It has a very intimate and  salon type feel. A decent selection of wines as well as a full bar and a small menu of apps to nosh on. It appears that those who know about it frequent often because it got crowded and quickly after work. I was there for drinks with business associates. The place opens at 5, we go there at 5:30 and there was only one other table in the joint, but by the time we left at 7:30, it was full up. A nice place for a drink before the theater if you don't want a full meal or have reservations elsewhere after the show.",1,,1
144,Joseph Z.,"New York, NY",1,2,0,1.0,3/23/2012,"An otherwise lovely evening turned sour when the check came.  The place is nice, the food is yummy and the drinks are good (albeit a bit overpriced).  And I must say, I even respect the manager's convictions on how she wants the place run.  However, it might have been wise to inform a large party that only a maximum of two credit cards will accepted at the time of payment when the reservation was made (or at least put it on the menu next to ""No Amex Accepted"").  Sure, I can understand that paying with eight credit cards might be a nuisance, but being obstinate about not accepting three was a little excessive.  Then after piecing together the cash to add to two credit cards, we were then accused of short changing the restaurant by $20 (the bill included an 18% gratuity).  I doubted we made a mistake at the time and when I woke up this morning to find the correct amount still on my calculator app on my iPhone (which I used to tally everything up before handing it to a male server), I have no doubt we made no error.  Now i understand why the male server refused to look at me while I was discussing the issue with the manager (who I am presuming by the posts below is Mary).  Mary, I respect your convictions, but you need to respect mine.  No mistake was made.  If your server has enough guts to look me in the eye, I will be happy to come by and discuss this matter further with him.  Otherwise, you have no worries that I will darken your door again.",4,,
145,Valerie S.,"New York, NY",32,283,0,4.0,3/31/2010,"Some friends and I had gone to see Hair the Musical and needed a place to chill while it rained and before we built a hunger for some food. We went to Eatery for breakfast and all those eggs really tied us over for quite a while. My friend looked up bar/lounge areas near Times Square on Black Blook and came across this place. We initially passed the place since there is no signage for this bar, but you'll know you're in the right place based on the address. The front is a stairway to a door that looked like a regular brownstone, but instead of a cute, swank, bar/restaurant with booths and tables along with a bar. They sat us at a cozy booth together and ordered drinks. They serve their wine in qtr liters, so like a glass in a half and they give you a wine glass with a little pitcher to pour as much or as little wine into your glass on your own. If you order a cocktail, they will put your little pitcher on some crushed ice in a little bucket to keep your drink cold. We noticed that they had wasabi peas at the bar so we asked our waitress if she could bring us a bowl for our table. An hour or two later, we had racked up about $100 in drinks amongst the 4 of us and decided it was time to get something to eat. Each drink is about $11-14 depending on what you order. I really like this place and it was perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon with friends.",,,
146,Sae L.,"Palisades Park, NJ",0,6,0,4.0,8/16/2010,"despite all the negative reviews i've read, i stopped by the place after a museum exhibit visit. i try to avoid the time square area as much as possible but i've always wanted to try bar centrale.the hostess was kinda rude and made us feel like we weren't being appreciated but.... as we sat by the bar since the tables were all full/reserved, the bartender was extremely friendly. he explained all the signature drinks of the bar, and made a special drink for my friend who didn't want strong cocktail - he presented our drinks in these cute jars filled with crushed ice to keep them chilled. the food was awesome as well. i'll def go back and recommend the place to my friends.",,,
147,Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,619,238,4.0,6/4/2007,"This bar is impossible to find unless someone provides you with the exact street address, or is waiting for you outside. This bar is intentionally hidden since it specifically caters to its loyal theater-going crowd of New York yuppies and old fogies. There is no street sign with its name, just the number. Except Monday nights, they accept customers with reservations only... Why Monday? Because there are no theater shows on Mondays. They have an excellent beer and wine menu, delicious finger-food and appetizers, and the most fun bartenders and waitstaff. It is probably a great place for a date since it's got somber, mood-lighting and is rather chic inside. It is expensive, so be ready to hand the credit card over without even looking at the check, trust me it's better that way. It is a tad pretentious though but that's something that comes with its primary clientele, i.e. musicians, actors and theater aficionados.",9,6,7
