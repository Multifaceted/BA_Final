0,Staci S.,"Dallas, TX",84,20,10,5.0,11/16/2018,"Honestly orgasmic. Stumbled into this unassuming place and easily my favorite low-key place that's perfect for grabbing a bite and drink solo at the bar. The atmosphere and staff give a truly ""Cheers"" vibe. Have had almost everything on the menu and the only complaint is from my waistline ;) The menu is concise and tight with very well developed recipes. The bartender, Morgan, is super personable and good at concocting things on the fly. Request an 'off-the-menu' speciality shot called a hallaback shot from him (whiskey with a special jalapeno and pineapple chaser) - you will not be sorry. Amazing neighborhood place.",,,

Just how I like them. Not floppy or greasy. They are not cheap but worth it. We also need to talk about their in-house scratch made RANCH DRESSING. I went to college in Ohio and they slather bottled ranch dressing on everything. Hence, my true appreciation for Royale's flavorful, fresh, perfect consistency, herbaceous, zippy ranch!!!! So underrated. This place rocks. Order or go here few times a month.",,,1
2,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,3.0,7/27/2018,"I co-hosted a party here in the back courtyard area. The staff was very accommodating with allowing guests to open their own tabs and service was pretty good considering the size of our party. The burgers and appetizers we ordered came out quickly and were pretty good. They were a little pricey for not being served with fries (must order separately) which is definitely one of my pet peeves with burgers because you need fries with burgers! The only other thing I didn't like was that there was only 1 bathroom (for females) and the place allows for a crowd in the back outdoor area, so there was quite a line!",,,
3,Marc B.,"New York, NY",96,12,1,1.0,10/2/2018,"Bland food, don't bother, I went for some of the good reviews but the burger is C-  and pretty bland and pass-able at best. The burger bread was slightly stale and the onion rings were terrible, I was hungry so I ate about half and felt  sick walking away, parts of the onion rings didn't taste fully cooked. And are just plain bland. I don't usually write reviews but save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere or just get a drink at the bar, which is what this place is.",,,
4,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2412,5152,4.0,4/14/2018,"If you think you're sick of pickle backs, take a trip to Royale and get reinvigorated. Each whiskey // pickle juice shot gets accompanied by a crisp piece of bacon to bring this beloved NY shot to a new level. I led with that because anyone who's lived in the area knows the basics: they have great burgers, an awesome patio, and generally a great crew of humans that pop in and out. It's the kind of bar where most will have a great time, especially when those piggy backs are involved.",6,2,3

The food is definitely pub fare, everyone ordered the burgers, one kale salad. The kale salad looked really sad, definitely stick to the burgers. I got the veggie burger and it was pretty good! Nothing particularly bad about it, your basic run of the mill burger, the bun was a brioche, and typical lettuce, tomato and onion. The waitress was incredibly hard to get attention, and I didn't get the first drink until about 30 minutes after sitting down. I think they are just understaffed she didn't seem lazy or anything. The fries were good, we ordered both normal and truffle, but the truffle fries were basically normal fries with some dust of truffle salt. The outdoor patio out back is pretty nice! But it's enclosed in buildings so no major view.",1,,

7,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",90,757,5502,4.0,7/16/2017,"It may not look like much, but trust me, it was good. It's a pub. It's a hole in the wall. Nothing glamorous. Frankly, I don't visit many hole in the wall spots and was in the area catching up with errands but also, didn't want to drive away from Alphabet City. In comes Royale with a Veggie Burger in their menu and a decent cocktail list. Dual entrances and then it opens to a mid 20s to early 30s crowd. For a slight second, we had this freaking, dazed and confused look in our faces. Not even 20 seconds later, I was like, f%ck it- and went in. No frills design- really. Plain square dark wood tables with neon green panel ""cowboy doors"". Started with Caipirinhas and The Man's, was Basic- while mine, had the ""wow"" Mango factor. Menu pleased almost every palate with nice selections of Salads, Sandwiches and Appetizers and obviously, Burgers- which are already hooked up with the classic, lettuce and tomatoes (and can choose 'Toppings' from their add-on list). I didn't expect for my Veggie Burger on a Brioche Bun to be good- and it was. Went with Sautéed Mushrooms (that were fresh and not canned) and Gruyère Cheese that made the whole combination, a masterpiece with no complaints from The Man's Burger. Truffle Fries, tasted real good and earthy with the Truffle Oil. Drinks were very good with natural ingredients and powerful- but the downer was, too much ice. Music was a real a nice treat with a mix of old-school R & B (Boys To Men, Jodeci) and Indie Pop. Except, the music was way too loud for Royale's small space and was screaming at the servers while ordering. The girls were very nice throughout the evening. We did shots before heading out, and one of our servers even said it was ""cool""- but was that her translation, to say that we were brave for being around their young crowd? It's all good- and was all in jest. At first sight, Royale is upbeat, but I just looked at Royale's surface and not knowing how good it was going to be inside. The humblest spots, are usually, the perfect experiences and made the best, of our Saturday night mingling. Buenas Noches.",14,6,13

Good fries too!Pretty good IPA choices on tap to wash down the deliciousness!

Not only is Royale wallet friendly, but the food is also great and the drink selection is awesome. The atmosphere is casual and my friends and I really enjoyed being able to sit on the outdoor back patio while watching a World Cup game. Our servers made sure we always had drinks and our food orders didn't take long- even though the bar was pretty full. Overall, very impressed and worth the trip to Alphabet City.",,,

I love the burger from this place - it is one of the best burgers in the East Village by far. However I have one BIG problem with this place. When you go to the restaurant they give you PLASTIC utensils and cups ( not just when you order but IN THE RESTAURANT) I cannot imagine how much waste this restaurant generates. SO BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.Please change this!!!!!!!!!!,,,
12,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,3.0,4/11/2017,"Alphabet City might be far away, but it's worth the walk for the plethora of interesting food options. This bar doles out Jules-worthy burgers, as well as large snacks to go along with your standard draft selection.Saturday afternoon and more than enough room at the bar or tables. Quickly got a menu and ordered the Royale with cheese ($10) and a side of Onion Rings ($5). Price is a little on the high side for the neighborhood, yet was motivated by all the pictures. Decided on a Fat Tire on draft ($7) while waiting for my food. And wait I did, as the server explained later that the onion ring batter was still being made. No matter, was willing to wait for some good grub. Food came all at once - a well-sized burger with melted cheese on a medium patty and your basic toppings. The meat is very tasty and just a solid all around burger. Onions rings on the other hand looked like it was on the burnt end, and tasted as such. Extra crispy and overly breaded, it was hard to get through. Managed to finish a few with the table hot sauce.People behind the bar are really nice, as it feels like your friendly neighborhood bar. Solid pub if in the area.",4,2,1
13,William G.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",46,20,134,4.0,6/22/2018,"I've been looking forward to eating a burger at this place for a long time.  My wife and 2 kids bacon burgers and mushroom burgers.  All of our burgers were delicious!  And so reasonably priced especially for the east village.  The burgers were tasty and cooked medium well to perfection.  We accompanied the burgers with fries which were enough for 2 and onion rings. I haven't had onion rings this good in years. These are not Burger King rings, these are the real deal. Fried beer battered and so crispy with real onion inside. It went perfectly with my Fat Tyre draft. My wife had the shimmy shimmy pasión fruit ginger drink. It was so refreshing and unique. Can't wait to go back. Try to sit in the outdoor area outback. It was nice being outdoors yet in a private setting.",,,
14,Nicole M.,"Edison, NJ",411,104,65,4.0,8/11/2018,Came here with a friend. Service started off rocky we had to seat ourselves and look around for someone to acknowledge us. My friend got the bacon royale burger with truffle fries and I got the royale cheese burger with the beer battered onion rings. We both got the gruyere cheese. The burger is good. The brioche bun is a nice touch and i liked the gruyere. My friend love her truffle fries and the onion rings are ridiculous.  I would come back and probably get a beer next time,1,,

16,Sara R.,"Rockville Centre, NY",218,58,1057,5.0,4/14/2018,"LOVE Royale. To drink- I usually get the John Daly (sweet tea vodka with lemonade - basically an Arnold Palmer 1/2 & 1/2). I also tried the Shimmy Shimmy Coco Punch, it's yummy! For food, I order the Bacon Royale Burger with cheddar, add ons: avocado, caramelized onions & sautéed mushrooms. Moderately priced as far as NYC spots go, the burger runs me about $15. (Burgers start at $8.50, add-ons are $1-$2 each.) In my experience, the burgers have always been expertly prepared to specification (ex: rare, medium rare, etc). Fries are great, the truffle fries are popular and seem well received- personally, I'm not a huge fan of truffle, it's too rich for my taste... so the handcut fries hit the spot for me. The beer battered onion rings are to die for. Get them. Die for them. They're so damn good. Chicken fingers are great to start with, housemade bbq chips are fun! Definitely a sweet spot for a casual hang with friends. The restaurant is small-ish but the courtyard is spacious! Try to come by on a sunny day, if you can. Great food, great service. All around a good time. Eat well & drink up at Royale! :)",,,

18,Alyssa D.,"New Milford, NJ",160,130,441,5.0,11/27/2016,Little bar with a huge punch.The burgers here are fantastic! Definitely on my list of must try places for all you burger lovers in the area. Came here around 2am last night and were one of the last people inside - but definitely last to order food. Felt kinda bad after that we were eating there while they were closing but they did not once make us feel rushed or unwelcome which was great. Juicy burger on a toasty bun. That's it! Nothing fancy no fancy sauces no fancy fixins just a good ass burger with some juicy flavorful meat. The fries were great too. Came with a side of what was I think some kind of truffle aoli?Would most certainly come back for that burger!,2,1,2
19,Marcus S.,"South Orange, NJ",238,400,1480,4.0,9/3/2016,"Came here for a lunch special that appeared to be promoted by Jack Daniels (not someone named Jack, but the whiskey) the lunch was a southern/barbacue sorta spread with cornbread, cucumber salad, watermelon, sliders and of course ribs as well as some other eats. All the food was pretty good, maybe not as of your family put it all together but definitely satisfying as if you went to bbq. The food was buffet style with all you can eat which made it a heck of a deal and not bad tasting at all. The sliders, pretty standard bar burger, the all the sides I mentioned again were all fine but the ribs hit the spot, just enough sauce and good smoked flavor. The highlight for me however was the Mac & cheese. It was exactly how mac and cheese should be. Hot and cheesy, emphasis on the cheese. The featured whiskeys were ok, one was cherry inspired and the other watermelon which were ok, not a big fan but it came with the meal and can easily say that the deal was awesome. If they have anything like this and you like food, I'd say go for it. It puts it a step up from your usual burger bars.",5,4,5

The service is fantastic, authentically friendly and unpretentiousness. Full of a mix of neighborhood locals and random passer-bys. Kinda place the government should subsidize (make America great again and keep it that way)...Update: And they just gave me a free drink? Without a complaint or issue. That kinda thing just don't happen anymore.",4,,

23,Paula S.,"Toronto, Canada",44,334,23,5.0,7/13/2017,"Onion Rings were everything an onion ring should be plump, juicy and greasy in a good way.  They reheat very well the next day too.  Fries were equally as good although they must be eaten immediately and they do not reheat well.  We also tried the burger it was huge and perfectly seasoned with sauteed onions. The beef used was very fresh.  We would revisit especially for the onion rings.",1,,1

They have a great outdoor seating that is quiet and comforting!! The burgers here are dope as fuck. The onion rings are BOMB. But almost as importantly the service is great. The waiters are always chill and nice.Whenever my friends want burgers and I can convince them to trek to C. It's my number one choice.Try to come in the afternoon though.,1,1,1
25,Alex F.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,1,0,1.0,5/3/2018,"After reading the great reviews for Royale, my boyfriend and I were eager to check this place out. Upon arriving, there was a 30 minute wait, which was totally fine - we just sat at the bar and ordered a drink from the inattentive bartender. When we were seated on the patio, we shared a picnic table with a four-top, who sat down after us. A few minutes of sitting later, the four-top gets their drink order taken; we have yet to be greeted by a server. When the server comes back to take the four-top's food order, 10 minutes after we sat down, we flag down the waitress, who thankfully takes our order as well. Flash forward to an hour and fifteen minutes later and we still haven't gotten our food. The four-top has finished eating. I can't even tell you how the food was because we ended up leaving after the waitress told us our ticket never made it to the kitchen.",2,,
26,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1212,6226,4.0,7/26/2016,"NYC can get a bit steamy for a few weeks each summer and on those sweltering nights there's no better spot than the back patio at Royale. Don't worry too much about space, as there are two levels, so they can accommodate larger groups and it's fairly easy to snag a table out there. Need to wait? No bigs, the bar inside is plenty capable of keeping your attention for a while and is not at divey as expected. Grab yourself a cider with a cup of ice, a piggy back shot (pickle back + bacon), and a royale with cheese and I dare you to not have a chill time back there. A welcome spot (mostly) away from the riff raff of 'bet city.",23,8,16

The beer selection is a little on the weaker side but they have a fairly extensive whiskey selection.The beers were decently priced a buck or two cheaper than what you might find elsewhere in East Village. Service was quick and efficient although there weren't too many others in the bar on a Monday night. I ordered the chicken tenders, which turned out to be surprisingly delicious and plentiful for $10. They seemed to be a little skimpy with their bbq and honey mustard sauces though so not sure what was going on there. Overall, nothing to complain or rave about during the experience.",,,

People in NYC are pretentious sons of bitches.I'll call a spade a spade. I've heard many a SoHo loft dweller denigrate new restaurants because the chef isn't well known or the beef isn't made by someone with a name who sounds like the actor that played Mr. Miyagi.Royale doesn't have Pat LaFreida beef.  What they do have are delicious fucking hamburgers. The beef is juicy. The buns are delicious. The fries taste hand cut and homemade. The onion rings are beer battered in house.However my superlatives really have to go to two things. The caramelized fucking onions. These guys don't just throw some onions in a pan and let them get slightly burned and browned and call them caramelized. Hell no, son. They do their onions right. They've been slow cooked down to a sweet and jammy mess that pairs perfectly with their gruyere cheese. yes they have.I also want to give a shout out to their massive outdoor space which is oh so perfect for hanging out in when the weather is good. They've also got some solid drink specials. I'm fortunate to live less than four short blocks from this gem.",2,1,3

You can choose between American, cheddar, and gruyère cheese for the burger. The burger comes with pickles, tomato, onions, lettuce and bacon. The burger was a pretty solid good burger, although I felt like the bacon was a little too hard. The beef was still juicy and tender and I ordered medium well. Next time I will try a different cheese. Unfortunately, couldn't rate this place a 5 star for burgers because of all the burgers I've had, shake shack still holds #1 for me and I'm forced to compare every single burger to it. There just hasn't been a burger spot I've tried that has beaten shake shack so far..just waiting for that day to come! As for the onion rings, oh em gee! Sooooo freaking good, a must get.

Rebecca and I frequent Alphabet City, the East Village, and the Lower East side on the regular since we live close by. One of the greatest things about ""Lower Manhattan"" (excluding the suits in FiDi), is the cheap, delicious food.We stumbled into Royale on a Friday night and found ourselves amidst one of the greatest Happy Hours in NYC. $3.00 Beers and $3.00 well-drinks. I'll be cliche in saying ""HARD TO BEAT THAT IN NYC!""A couple more things to keep in mind:1) Friendly staff. Passion for their food (most importantly, their burger).2) A pretty solid beer selection. Anytime I can get an Ithaca Flower Power for $3.00, it's a good day. (and night) (and usually a rough morning).3) The Bacon Royale Burger is unbelievably good. It's $9.50 and it comes with mouth-watering beef cooked anyway you'd like, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and cheese.Basically, what I'm saying is: go there with $20 and you will devour an unforgettable burger, drink two casual, yet powerful beers, and leave a healthy tip in the process.

So depending on how you like your food, this could be a hit for you. For my taste buds, not a fan. Burger is around 3/4. If they had like a thousand island dressing - id say definite 4. If you are ok with just ketchup, then you'll like this burger.",1,,
48,Brian T.,"Manhattan, NY",106,11,0,4.0,6/11/2016,"Real winners circles are deep fried and made of onions.Food: Ordered nachos, onion rings and a Royale with cheese. The onion rings, oh man the onion rings, are heavenly. If you're one to appreciate a fine beer batter, please try these onion rings. Nachos and Royale with cheese were good but unfortunately did not blow my socks off. The Royale with cheese oozes with juicy goodness but lacked some salt and proper crusting. Nachos were not terrible but paled in comparison to those deep fried halos. Service: This place has a family feel and a wait staff that is welcoming. They went out of their way to make sure the customers were comfortable and did their best to accommodate all parties. Space: Garden outdoor seating is available but quickly filled. Inside has a bar area and tables.I'm thinking bacon will solve the problem I found with the crunch and salt that I missed in the burger. Fortunately they have that available as well as a number of fixins. I will have to come back for those onion rings at some point. Until then all I can do is dream.",1,,2

Despite that, we were extremely happy with how quickly our burger and crispy chicken sandwich came out. I definitely preferred my burger to his fried chicken sandwich and we also split the fries, which were huge but tasty. We were probably the only ones not drinking and managed to polish off everything really quickly, which I regretted afterwards, but it was nice to have a date night again after so long. :)It's definitely a very far walk from the train so I don't think I'd do it again unless I were for some reason nearby.",,1,

56,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,10/9/2014,"I'm a big fan of Royale. It's a pretty no-frills bar/restaurant, but nicer than most dives in the city. The location itself is a little bit out of the way, so beware of sketchy people outside when it's late. I like how it's rarely ever crowded, and I can get a really good burger and a huge basket of fries for about $12.50. The waitstaff is very casual, yet attentive, and are usually very efficient with drinks and food. Anyways, the burger is fairly standard, but very tasty, and the ratio of meat to bread is perfect. I usually get the Royale with Cheese or if I'm feelin' frisky, the Bacon Royale. Really hits the spot with that cheesy, meaty goodness. The tomatoes, onions, pickles and lettuce seem a bit overkill, but if you remove some of the onions and tear the lettuce down, the texture is pretty good. The side of hand-cut fries comes in a pretty big basket, definitely worth the $4.50 or so they charge. Onion rings are decent too, albeit on the greasier side. Also, the ring is pretty much 95% fried dough and 5% onion, but then again, who eats onion rings for the onions anyways? Anyways, if you're feeling hungover, the onion rings actually will really hit the spot. Beer selection is decent, and they always try to have a good rotating seasonal on tap, just to mix it up. I'm not a huge fan of Pork Slap, but you can get cans of 'em for cheap if you make your way out here for happy hour. If you sit at the bar, there are a couple TVs for watching games, and the bartenders are always very attentive. During the summer, they do have a patio, so you can enjoy some food and beer outside.Come here for a relatively low-key burger and fries.",3,,1

I did try the onion rings which were disgusting. They were so incredibly oily I wouldn't even finish a single one. I ordered a French onion soup which also turned out to be a bad move.

I've been using these coupons for almost 2 years, and I know well that it's only the case when it's specifically indicated on the coupon ""Dinner only"" or ""Valid only for dinner"". On this coupon there was nothing like that. Also, why would they offer just a $5 dollar coupon for dinner? Nobody does that. It wouldn't make any sense.Conclusion: they were bullshitting me. I asked to speak with the manager, and it took 2 minutes for the woman (who was standing right in front of me) to stop having her private conversation with a male customer she seemed pretty interested in, turn around and talk to me. With attitude, she confirmed what the bartender said, neglecting to care about the clear contradiction with what they had advertised on Scoutmob.At that point, I told my buddy (who hadn't touched the beer either): ""Let's leave.""

We were greeted by a very friendly bar tender and quickly ordered our first beer. After about a half hour we decided to go ahead and order the famous burgers. The burgers lived up to the hype. But, I was more pleased with the overall experience.We ended up staying at Royale for 5 hours seated at the bar and watched both NFL playoff games.

JUST EAT THE SALAD, COLLEEN. Even though everyone else is having somuchfun with the burgers, just relish in this awesome little bucket of leaves. Sigh. Detoxing sucks. A burger and an Allagash!? My world. But instead I enjoyed a salad with bleu cheese and walnuts sprinkled with chicken, which for a place with burgers out the wazoo...ain't so bad at all. In fact, it was fresh and had flavor, and the chicken was great. So, kudos...it could have been a lot worse for me! Service was great, and the back patio is a treat.

Worth the journey.The venue is a cozy bar. Nothin' fancy. No suits. No hipsters. Just regular people. At least not both times I went at night. Like many other bars in the area, the inside is relatively long and narrow. Unlike many other bars in the area, there is an outside... with space heaters. Lots of 'em. So winter is no excuse not to come here!OK enough's enough - onto the food. I had the Bacon Royale. Sona P. had the Veggie Burger. Another friend had the Crispy Chicken sandwich. As per Sona P., the veggie burger was surprisingly delicious. Surprising, because so many places have shite veggie burgers. My friend said that the chicken sandwich was ""the best I've ever had"". Now for the Bacon Royale.My burger sure looked pretty (see pics). The portion was just right, and the proportion of the bun to the patty was spot on. The most glorious aspect, however, was the bacon. I don't know how many strips of victory were on this thing. Even looking at the picture I took doesn't help. Alls I know is that every bite of this scrumptious masterpiece provided me with a taste of these lil' Wilburs. The patty itself was delicious and filling. Definitely up there. Where it ranks exactly will require some more taste tests.And as a side note, on the side dishes... get the onion rings. $4, but fantastic and shareable.Oh, and I think my party of 9 crashed a birthday party. Correction: my party of 9 crashed a birthday party. They literally rented out the back and had pre-paid for a ton of burgers and stuff. Oops.Travel time (T_T) / But the distance keeps it a secret!

101,Katie R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,14,3,1.0,4/19/2015,"My friends and I were heading back into Manhattan after a Brooklyn afternoon, and my brother suggested Royale.  He and his friends frequent here for hockey game, and spoke highly of their food, his favorite bartender, Katie, and the fact that it's where he goes to watch hockey.  We sat in the back patio, which is an awesome space, and also has a large tv, where we hoped to watch the 2nd game of the Pens/Rangers series.  Since my brother often goes here for hockey, we politely asked a waitress if she could put on the game. ..Maybe she had forgotten, but we are in fact in NYC, and everyone around us self-proclaimed themselves as Rangers fans and wanted to watch the game.  The waitress, (who we later learned is named Aviva), walked away without responding, so we figured it strange and asked another waiter.  This waitress then came back after several requests.  We forgivingly asked her again, thinking maybe it had slipped her mind, and all she blurted out was that ""This isn't a hockey bar."", snidely.  My brother respectfully stated, ""Well I come here to watch hockey all of the time...so it kind of is.."" and she actually submitted to a toddler-like tantrum, blurting, ""NO IT ISN'T!!!!!"" and welcomed immature bickering with us, customers.  This actually went on for the most awkward minute of my life, while a professional began screaming ""NO TI ISN'T!"" at us without attempting to problem solve or appease to customer request.After solely coming to watch the game and get food, my brother went into the front bar to watch it, and opened a tab inside...She left again, to return and curtly dictate to us, ""This is a democracy.  I have to ask everyone if they want the NBA playoffs or hockey."" Mind--no one was watching the NBA playoffs that were already on, (need I even mention that neither team was a NY team...) and each group had expressed interest in watching the Rangers...We then asked a waiter again, who very nicely smleld and put the Rangers game on.  She noticed this, and stormed off again.  When we got my brother to tell him the game was on, this waitress returned to yell at my brother that he had to close his tab at the bar before he could come back to the patio, and that there was a minimum he had to spend as well.  He responded that he had only opened it becuase of her refusal to put on the game in the back, and she refused to serve him at the table unless he spent the minimum and closed it.  Trying to ease the situation, he asked if she could carry his mere $5 to our table's tab, and she again refused, and walked away again.  We explained our situation to our sweet waiter, who understood, and assured us he would fulfill our requests.  We ordered several cocktails, beers, and 3 rounds of shots..The cocktails were surprisingly very good, and savory and enjoyable.  Not too sweet and did not taste cheap...Additionally, we bought 3 sandwiches and burgers, onion rings, 2 orders of spinach artichoke dip, french fries, and more to snack on as the night went on...Our food was pretty good actually, but took over 40 minutes to come out...Luckily it all was very good, which made up for the horribly long wait.  Our server Lionel, and our waiter, Sheldon, were extremely helpful, and kind.As our bill came, this previous waitress who had been extremely malicious and inconsiderate to us already, stormed back over and commanded my brother close his tab in the front, loudly, creating a large scene in front of the entire patio.  We tried to rationally and calmly explain what our waiter had agreed and discussed with us, and she continued to loudly exclaim her issues with us, and completely berated us.  It was quite uncomfortable, highly unprofessional, and an awful first experience to this bar.  In fear of running into this type of situation again, I don't plan on returning, as I felt almost harassed by this young woman...Our waiter had obviously heard this commotion and politely expressed our situation and solution, but she continued to degrade us in front of the patio.  We calmly asked if we could just speak with our waiter, and if she could exit the conversation, as she was making a large, grandiose scene of a small misunderstanding.  She then huffed, and stomped off to the front bar.  Our waiter, calmly apologized, and simply transferred the $5 beer to our tab, and returned my brother's card.  I asked for a business card and where to lodge a complaint about this insane situation we had just experienced.  My boyfriend and I are frequent foodies, and I have never experienced such an uncomfortable, unprofessional, and malicious situation as a customer.  All in all, I would suggest going here for casual food and drink, but hopefully you are not under the wrath of the anti-hockey waitress!!!  Ask for Katie or Sheldon and I would suggest perhaps going to a more hockey-friendly bar for a game, because ""IT'S NOT A HOCKEY BAR!!!!""  As we were later told, this hockey-hating waitress was actually the manager.  Gasp.",1,2,1

We went at around 4:30 p.m. The front was nearly empty aside from one other group who left and a couple of people who came in for takeout. We took a seat and the waitress came over and tossed some menus in front of us on table. I smiled and said thank you. She said nothing.She came over a few minutes later and asked if we wanted something to drink. We ordered drinks and also told her we were ready to order our food (she loved that and became a slightly warmer person). Drinks came out quickly. Food, not quick at all.We ate, she came back over at one point, and we ordered another beer to share. Well, that went well. She was nice enough.A little while later, we had stopped eating and the bartender came over and proceeded to try to take everything away, including my almost, but not empty glass. He never said a word, just grabbed it. When I said, I'd keep that he was still mute and just handed it back to me.Then he and the two waitresses sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and bitched about another coworker or manager or owner (who knows). I tried to make eye contact with the bartender who was in my line of sight. Even when I am nearly certain he was looking at me and I subtly held out my card and mouthed check, he did nothing. Finally, the waitress turned around from their ongoing conversation and got up. She printed out the receipt and tried to drop it on the table but I handed her my card. Well, after she ran the card, she tossed the card receipt (merchant copy only) on the table. No copy for me. We signed it and the three of them continued to sit at the bar and yap away. No one acknowledged us on our way out. There were at least two tables seated on the patio, too, but their priority was clearly taking a time out before the evening crowd comes in.The food is as good as it was when I started going there years ago, but the service was a damn joke.

But, before you venture out into trying the entire menu, DO NOT leave without trying the most mouth-melting juicy cheeseburger you will ever sink your teeth into in Lower Manhattan  - The Royale w/Cheese.....I love this burger as much as I love New York!! I recommend the Onion Rings, French Fries and a very appropriately recommended Porkslap Ale; just because without them, your will not have that out of this world experience that has me dreaming of a one-way ticket from San Diego for just 1 bite! Believe you me.....its worth every single calorie and every hour on that plane! So the final word is...get the burger, get the fries, the onion rings, wash it all down with the Porkslap Ale and leave amazed and satisfied...I sure did!!I know you will agree with me on this one......have a bite and a sip and enjoy!!!",,,

Anyway, I ate here entirely sober on a Thursday evening and ordered two Royales with American cheese, medium rare. We got some onion rings on the side too.The buns were dry and sort of stale: not my favorite sort of bun to sandwich a burger patty on. Then again, the meat was so greasy that the dry bun might've helped soak it up. I don't mind my meat greasy, usually, but the fact that it wasn't very flavorful made it seem like I had a mouthful of grease.The onion rings were interesting; it was coated in a light shell of batter and were quite refreshing.Service was quick and efficient, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Loved the outdoor seating.Maybe this place would be better for drinks and a burger.",1,,1

Now, $9 is for just the burger, no sides.  However, their order of fries or onion rings ($5-$6) is plenty to split between two people.  And they have plenty of affordable drinks.  The $4 cans of Porkslap being my favorite of these options.  All-in-all, pretty affordable, and massively delicious.",2,,1

They are not the stale, machine-made fries. They are fried to a degree of crispness that you rarely taste and they come in a big basket.

We showed up late for our reservation with almost twice as many people as we thought, and they shifted things around to make it all work nicely for us. We proceeded to reward them handsomely by ordering many, many rounds of Pork Slap.The TV on the back patio was the perfect way to kill a Saturday evening, and try as we might to clean them out of beer, a steady stream kept finding it's way to us with no end in sight.

I fancy myself a burger enthusiast, so when my burger spies informed me that this place was worth investigating I made the trek to Avenue C. When you first walk in, the crowd seems a little rowdy. When I say ""rowdy"" I don't mean 22 year old girls taking zombie shots and yelling ""WOOHOO!"" I mean gruff old men who have bar brawls when they are bored. Upon further inspection the old guys are harmless even friendly. Maybe the place just has that bar brawl lighting...Sitting in the back patio was an anxious expereince as well, but it wasn't their fault. They have both an covered and open air section. We got to sit in the open air section while thunder clouds hovered over our meal. It took a couple of Johnnie Walkers to ignore the  threatening clouds and enjoy our burgers.As an enthusiast, I will say that the burgers are quite good. The meat is spiced well and juicy. The onion rings are huge, crispy and salty. They are not good for you, but you should eat them anyway. The service is good, although it was a bit redundant. We would give one waitress our drink order and then someone else would come to take our drink order...twice. I don't mind attentive service. I just hope someone else wasnt' getting ignored.

I've had much better at other places in the city. I thought the burger was kind of small and it wasn't that tasty.  I felt like it lacked seasoning or something - it was too bland. I don't know, I just didn't like it. My friend had the chicken sandwich which was super thin as to where they pounded it so much the bun was huge in comparison to the meat. The fries were okay.  However, I did like the happy hour specials - $3 or something beers for before and the server was nice enough to give it to us at 7:01 p.m.Good happy hour alcohol specials, but not so much the burgers - I did not think it lived up to all its hype.",1,,1

Pretty good. But before that, I had arrived early and was waiting for this fancy so-n-so to show, and to my liking and pleasant surprise (aside from her play-your-cards-right dress) there was a bench right outside for me to relax upon whilst i waited. the front of this burger bar was open to the sidewalk, which i thought was nice as well. I eventually went in an ordered a Jameson & ginger while waiting and was a bit surprised it was only $8. This was after 8pm on a Saturday night. And it wasn't weak either. Other tasty drinks had throughout the night included an Old Fashioned and some Drunken Arnold Palmers - nicely done as well.The other thing about this place that i LOVED was their selection of music: 90's hiphop. and i'm not talking all the mainstream stuff, i'm talking mostly the joints you're only gonna know about if you bought and listened to an entire album, plus delved into the underground a bit. it was seriously making my night. there is also an outdoor area out back for the smokers, which i can appreciate, but i didn't go out there, so i can't tell you about it, other than they close it down around 1am.i would definitely make my way back here for the excellent service, drinks and music.oh yeah, there's also sports showing on a few tv monitors but i'm not one for paying attention to that.",14,13,11

Nor is it a fast-food burger-- it sort of rides the in between.  More than anything, I like Royale for the vibe-- pork slap in a can, outdoor patio seating below space heaters, and a friendly wait staff.  This is DEFINITELY not the best burger I've had in the city, but its a good one and a cheap one at that. $9 for a bacon cheeseburger.

An unassuming restaurant tucked away on Ave C, we came on a Friday night for the cheap happy hour draft beers and the burgers and left happy and satisfied. The place was not crowded at all and we grabbed a table in the outdoor patio in the back. It has just rained and the waitress was nice enough to wipe down the seats and table for us, even though we were probably the only people there. Which is strange, because this place is the bomb-dot-com.Firstly, they have a $3 draft beer happy hour until 7PM. For me, that's unheard of. What a deal. And normally their drafts are $6 anyways. Secondly, they do burgers and they do them pretty well. The burger was pretty juicy. You can order fries and onion rings on the side. The onion rings, which were lightly battered, were especially good. But most importantly, I thought the service was awesome. The waitstaff was friendly, helpful and seemed actually happy to be there.

Food is well presented and nothing is sloppily made in any half ass manner.The place is dark and unassuming like all the other bars in the area.There's a backyard/terrace. It's heated in the winter time so no worries there. Cool place to chill out. Ask what kind of beer specials they have, it's not always the same.",,,
179,JD M.,"Manhattan, NY",287,5,7,2.0,8/27/2012,"Good place to come if you wanna booze in their backyard patio. did that once and had a good time. the only reason for the 2nd star is their outdoor spaceif you want to come here casually on a Sunday and just enjoy a beer or two, don't bother - the servers will give you attitude and act frustrated when you aren't interested in another beer the moment you've finished the one before.also, $20 minimum on credit cards - which is technically illegal and should be stated up front. when we resisted they threw a hissy fit and apparently needed to 'call the owner'... when they finally swiped my card and dropped the check off without saying a word. like it's skin off her back if i don't pay with cash? seriously.",,,

182,Kaitlin K.,"Pasadena, CA",6,39,22,4.0,4/21/2012,"I live two blocks away from this place and in the years I've been here, have never tried it. I went out for a late lunch with some friends and we felt like burgers and had heard great buzz about this place and went. Now, this is not the greatest burger I have never had. The honor of ""Best Burger In NYC"" for me goes to Korzo on 7th. That being said, it was a really good burger. It was a ""normal"" burger in the fact that it didn't have weird stuff on it like rosemary pineapple aioli or something. I was craving something traditional and that's what I got. The proportions of cheese to meat to vegetable to bun was good. It really hit the spot. Also, it was not overpriced. The location is also nice; I've never stopped in because most times it's packed on a Friday night, but we went in on a weekend and were the only people in there. The service was prompt, the food was good and they played nice music (anybody who plays The Black Keys is good in my book). Sure, it was a little loud at points, but not terribly so. Alphabet City is sort of a dry area for good burger places that aren't very expensive. Korzo is great but pricey and I don't have that kind of money for every time I want a burger. Anybody who says that Veselka has a better burger just... does not know burgers, period.",,,

184,Monica J.,"New York, NY",121,151,32,3.0,4/5/2011,"It was one of those rare, VERY rare, weekends where my schedule didn't consist of me spending all the daylight hours inside of an office and only being let out once the sun had set. In fact, I only had to go in on Sunday evening, so I decided to make the most of it. By 3pm all three of my roommates had returned from their trips and finished running their errands and we found ourselves soaking up the sun on the roof of our apartment building and drinking beer. Ah, if only every weekend could be this way. It didn't take long before we all realized how hungry we were (funny how beer will do that to you, eh?) and started searching for a place to grab dinner that offered outdoor seating. After much yelping and menu scoping, we settled on Royale, which -to be fair- one of my roommates had suggested early on but which, of course, we didn't actually settle on until 30 minutes had passed and all other options had been fully vetted and tossed aside. So we walked the two blocks over from our apartment (I do love living in a city where 4 blocks is the threshold for walking anywhere). From the outside the place seemed a little dingy and the interior was quite dark, but we just walked straight on through to the back patio. A big screen tv and space heaters set the perfect mood for a lazy Sunday. I just kept looking up and being amazed that the sun's and my schedule finally coincided!!  They have a decent selection of beer, with a few offbeat names, at quite reasonable prices. However, I wasn't feeling up for a can (I thought I had left those behind in my college days?) so I decided to go big and get the Guinness. Never as fresh as the flavors I found in Ireland but it definitely got the job done. After seeing the waitress walk by with one of their burgers, one of my roomies and i decided that splitting would be the best option as I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to finish an entire one myself! This also meant we could splurge and get the burger with bacon AND cheese. Oo, so indulgent.  And sure, let's throw in a basket of fries with that.We ordered our burger medium rare, which came out more medium than I would have liked, but was still satisfyingly juicy. The fries were good once we sprinkled it with salt. Again, satisfying for sure, but not something I would write home about. The waitress was adequate, not particularly friendly or attentive - for instance, she thought it appropriate to bring out 3 glasses of water instead of 4. Perhaps they only serve water to patrons that also order a beer (one of my roommates decided to forego the beer during our meal)? Or perhaps she's still learning to count? Either way, she did her job, and I guess that's more than you can ask from most establishments here in the city. Major downside: they only take cash. That's big a one for me as I hate carrying around cash. This is decidedly a good neighborhood joint. If you find yourself walking around Avenue C on a random sunny day, sure, go ahead and stop in to treat yourself to the bacon royale and a side of fries, but don't walk 4 blocks to check this place out.",1,1,1
185,Douglas C.,"Manhattan, NY",70,8,0,3.0,7/15/2011,"For the well-traveled and bedraggled burger hound, here is a comfortable spot to visit for a very good burger. But there are some setbacks. The Good:Burgers and chicken tenders are very good, cooked exactly the way you request, and delivered hot, thick and juicy. The staff is attentive, friendly, and knows how to please. If you want to change the tv channel, you can ask, and your request will be granted, usually, if there are not too many people there.Within walking distance from the L at First AvenueThe Setbacks:The space doesn't feel comfortable. Something about the cement floor, lack of careful lighting and the sometimes sticky bathroom floor. The restaurant is right below some apartments, so they have to close down the really lovely back patio pretty early on the weeknights. When the weather is really nice, this sucks.They have this exorbitant card limit on credit cards. You have to spend twenty bucks, which makes just dropping by and picking up one burger on the way home from work an expensive proposition, so I pass on that. Overall, this shapes up to be a great neighborhood bar / restaurant with unbeatable burgers. Take friends here after a kickball game, or after a run around the track on the East River. Stay all night and drink beers. Tends to clear late night, though, with another big wave coming in later.",1,,

What looks to be a pretty standard nyc bar (i.e., not super dive-y but definitely not swanky either) serves up a solid burger and beer. The meat and cheese--aka the most important parts--juicy and melty. Good job. Two little and pleasant surprises? The toasted sesame seed bun and bibb lettuce leaf. All right. Not too shabby. The bartender/waitress was nice. Other patrons kept to themselves. BBall was on. ::shrug::Didn't wow me so no 5. It did hit the spot messy burger + beer wise with no silly waiting for a table, so you'd think it'd be a 4. But the fries weren't very good, and they got a C sanitation rating.

I came here on a Friday around 7:30 (which sucks because Happy Hour is 4-7).  It was a good full, but not so packed that we couldn't find a table.  The waitress came pretty quickly and we learned about the $5 beers on tap.  And it wasn't just bud and bud-lite, they had a very good selection.  We each ordered a beer, a burger, and we shared one basket of fries ($3).  Everything came out pretty quickly.  The burger was solid.  A good bun, fresh fruit, melted cheese.  The patty was juicy, but could have been better.  I got it done medium, but probably should have gone with medium rare.  I took the first few bites without condiments, and then added ketchup and mustard.  It was not amazing, but it was a very solid burger. The five stars are because I could definitely see this as a regular place.  A good bar that doesn't seem empty but is not so full that you can't sit down or move.  The music was good, but not so loud that you couldn't talk.",2,2,3
192,Ann T.,"Huntington, NY",23,149,0,5.0,10/11/2013,"Royale is the best. They don't charge you to reserve a space in their awesome and spacious backyard (with heaters) for a party, you can just start a tab or have your guests start their own. Also, their burgers and onion rings are really good (and whatever that onion mayo thing is that comes with the chips).

It's always difficult to decide where/what you want to eat when you're hanging with a group of friends. Add numerous complimentary and paid drinks to the mix and you're pretty much screwed up the butt, no homo.A brief recap of how we decided:""Where are we eating?""""I don't know, what do you want?""""I don't know, what do you feel like?""""Hm, not sure. Ask them."" (points to other friends)""Hey, what do you guys want to eat? Burgers?""""YEA! I've been wanting burgers for so long!""""Okay, cool!""15 minutes later...""So, where are we eating again?""""I don't know, ask them."" (points to other friends)Somehow, emphasis on how, after we finally deliberated on the restaurant, we managed to get ourselves to Royale.The seating outside is spacious and pairs well with warmer weather although they do have heat lamps. I get cold easily. They even had a generously sized flat screen TV for us to watch the World Series, but who was watching that anyways? I ordered the Royale with Cheese, medium rare. The burger came out with bacon and I said something to the server without thinking (doh!) and he took it back (double doh!). I got the ""why did you open your mouth when you could have gotten free bacon"" stare from one of my friends. The burger actually came out more medium (very faint pink) but it was still really juicy and tasted extremely fresh. I wouldn't be surprised if they grind their meat per order.One of my friends sitting next to me ordered the Bacon Royale and hers came out medium rare when she ordered it medium, so there was a slight mix up. We shrugged it off and continued to eat.For around $8 a burger, Royale definitely sets itself apart from the rest. Inexpensive, quality food with great taste. You could come here everyday to grab a really ridiculously tasty burger but that would lead to adverse affects to your health. I would still recommend it. You're going to die anyway might as well go out with a stroke. I mean bang. I mean.........I gota go.---------------------------*Slang term for excellent, cool, awesome.

Chips with french onion dip: pretty good (and I'm not even into that whole chip dip thing). French fries: delicious.It is never crowded (at least the several times I've gone during weeknight evenings). They have a back patio.
