0,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,5.0,11/4/2018,I've watched many beautiful operas here and recently enjoyed Tosca. I've sat in many different locations and I have to caution people against sitting too far up and on the sides as the visibility is really poor. Anything in the center or lower levels offer better views of the stage. Great staff here. Box seats on the sides tend to be really cramped with very little leg room or space to pivot your chair. I'm always amazed at the beautiful and polite way in which people enter and exit this venue. It goes without saying that the interior is magnificent and grand. Tickets are available at a variety of price points from $30 standing room only to upwards of a couple of hundred dollars. The discounted standing room and back seats go on sale at noon day of the performance online (or four hours prior to matinee). What a wonderful cultural gem in NYC!,1,,1
1,Marietta C.,"New York, NY",49,130,2824,4.0,11/8/2018,"Delightful place for the opera. Comfortable seating. Nice venue.This was my first time going to the opera and we just couldn't wait! For our first time, we picked La Boheme. Despite rushing after work to head here, trying to find parking, running in, we still managed to get there too late: right at 7pm when the show started. They're very strict at letting people in once it starts so you have to wait for the second act to go in. We were bummed to miss it and thought we would just have to waste the first 30 minutes of it and be lost forever. They're prepared for all the latecomers so they have a room, kind of the size of a movie theatre room, where you can watch it in a big screen and not miss a thing. Once we got to our seats, despite them not being the best seats in the house we still had a great time. The seats are comfortable and you have subtitles in at least 5 languages (English, Spanish, German, Italian, french). We had a great time and can't wait to be back for our next show in March!If you're super confused and stuck on what to wear like I was, you can't really go wrong with anything. We decided to go with cocktail attire but there were many people dressed formal as well as casual with jeans on. For a nice night out at the opera I definitely think you should go all out and stay classy. Might as well right?",1,,
2,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",62,267,845,5.0,8/25/2018,"As a New Yorker, I've always loved The Met Opera for the talented legends that grace our presence. The interior is elegantly designed with the high ceilings and chandeliers. This is simply a black tie affair with women in their gowns and gentlemen in their best suits. Some folks opted for a formal attire. Being on time is key since they won't let you in once the opera commences. The staff let you in during the remission.A few years ago, I watched the last show of the season for La Traviata! It was so exquisitely well done, I was overwhelmed with a sense of appreciation for the arts. So much that we went back again for another show with our friends. The beauty of living in NYC is having access to the world top notch shows and performances. I can't wait to go back again!",1,,

To bad I forgot my big boy binoculars :c either way, I was still able to see ok. The inside of the Met is so so full of wanderlust! I will visit again when I'm in the area(: Just a tip, I bought a ginger ale at their bar and tried to bring it in...but they don't allow certain drinks to be brought inside the theater, so I had to chug it down but no problem.",2,1,1

5,Doug D.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",681,441,1262,5.0,4/19/2018,"The Met belongs to one of the most premiere performance halls of the world.  It's the primary reason I will go to New York.Their performers are really top notch in the world.  Every operatic great has performed there throughout their long history.  Just ask Maria Callas, Joan Sutherland, Jussi Bjoerling, etc . . . Their stage settings have gotten more and more sophisticated.  Any student of theater would be impressed seeing them.If you know how to spot them, you will see billionaires, C.E.O.'s, famous politicians, etc... in the audience.The only thing is that ticket prices are high, and the acoustics could be better.  But who cares.",42,22,37
6,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,5.0,4/16/2018,"I went to my first opera earlier this year to see Madame Butterfly. First, the structure of The Met Opera House will blow you away. I know you've likely seen it on television, in movies and read about it in books but there is nothing like the first time experiencing it. A friend and I got cheap tickets. Granted we were seated way up top but it was still a remarkable experience. Also, we are both underpaid, overworked millennials, so we ""ball on a budget.""The performance was absolutely enchanting and entertaining and still amazing from where we were sitting. We did make the rookie mistake of not using the translator until toward the end of the first act. We both looked at each other and was wondering why the entire audience burst into laughter. I thought to myself, ""dang, everyone knows Italian but me?"" lol",1,3,
7,Robert C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",654,755,6197,4.0,11/20/2017,"Wife and I went to see Madame Butterfly at the Metropolitan Opera.   My previous experiences with opera were with the Gilbert and Sullivan plays at the Lyric Theater in San Jose.  The Metropolitan Opera is dazzling with floor to ceiling glass windows on multiple floors, amid acres of red carpet, elaborate wall designs and golden chandeliers.  Security everywhere.  We got two orchestra tickets each regular priced at $137 for $83, before $15 ticketmaster and restoration surcharges, on goldstar.com.Younger crowd than in San Jose, with lots of people dressed to the max, including ladies in skirts showing bare skin in 5"" stilettos, despite the 40 degree weather.  Inside, seating for 4,000 viewers, with 5 levels of mezzanines and balconies, dress circles on both side walls.  Truly spectacular setting.We sit down, with empty stretches of seats here and there.  Turns out that late arrivals are not seated until intermission!Opera in Italian with closed captioning subtitles in individual electronic screens on the back of the seats.  Need subtitles even for operas in English!Saw Madame Butterfly, a story taking place in 19th century Japan.  Japanese lady married to an American naval officer.  Officer cheating on wife, wants a divorce.  Brings home another wife, demanding full custody of the child.  Despondent Japanese wife commits hari kari. Two intermissions.  We had different neighbors after each intermission.  Wife said that the first couple had moved forward into the empty seats.   A second couple missed 2/3rds of the play.  They waited until the end of the second intermission before evicting the first couple, who had to find their original seats in the dark!  Saw some interesting shoe styles with a guy in a suit wearing leather fluffy mule shoes.  I find out later they are $1000 Princetown leather slippers by Gucci!  Check out my pictures.  And I thought my $150 Hoka Bondi 5 shoes that I was wearing were pricey!Exceptional ambiance and setting, with great singing (as far as I can tell, as I am no Opera expert), costumes, and background props.  Will be difficult going back to Gilbert and Sullivan at the Lyric theater in San Jose after this!",24,19,22
8,Carolyn C.,"New York, NY",322,62,460,5.0,1/5/2018,Absolutely five stars - the music and production doesn't get better than this! Worth reading the synopsis beforehand if you're not familiar with the operas. Best kept secret is that the Met makes their own podcasts so you can try to find an episode about a show you want to see to get more insight about the background of the opera.,1,,
9,Paul L.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,898,22019,5.0,11/23/2017,"Seeing Madama Butterfly was timely considering all the justifiable male-shaming compressed into the past few months.  You know the storyline of this one: man marries girl, knocks her up, abandons her then returns years later with his new wife to claim the child.  The gall of him!  Where are the social workers and the lawyers?  Sadly, justice is nowhere to be found but that's what operatic endings are all about.  This was a great production and I enjoyed it mostly; hey, the old woman next to me decided to hum along through some of the production -- when she wasn't nodding off on my shoulder -- and she really didn't have the chops to keep up.  New Yorkers are so cultured.I'm 6'2"" so squeezing into some of The Met's puny seats involves a pry bar -- I don't always have one handy for cultural events -- so I don't attend as much as I would like.  However, if NYC hadn't turned suddenly blustery lately, I probably would have attended two other operas over the next few nights.  The voices, the set designs, and acoustics at The Met are addicting.  Think you don't like opera?  See one in person.  You may change your mind.",2,,1
10,Sarah W.,"Manhattan, NY",10,25,16,5.0,12/19/2017,"Lovely, classy night out. Beautiful, meticulously designed venue. Delightful performance of The Marriage of Figaro. Good things to know for a first timer: Strict start time. If late, you cannot enter until intermission. There is a sitting room where you can watch on a feed until then. Translator for each seat. Don't understand Italian? No worries. Each seat has a little personalized subtitle screen. See the emotive actors' faces. Where it doesn't matter necessarily to see faces at the Philharmonic, it is essential at an opera. If sitting far away, bring viewing spectacles, especially if you sit higher up! We sat only halfway back from the stage floor level, and even then we were glad to have binoculars. My husband brought his full on, bona fide hunting binoculars. I was initially embarrassed by them, but once I zoomed in on the dynamic faces, hubby had to fight to get them back. Move closer. If you have bad seats, and it's a slow night, move to an open, closer seat after intermission. No one seems to care. Don't have a top knot. I had my hair in a top knot and a lady asked me if I could take it down because it was blocking her view  Oops.",3,,
11,Tricia M.,"Davis, CA",101,396,746,4.0,11/22/2017,"We came to see the Met Opera's performance of Turandot. It was truly a spectacle - the set design was spectacular, depicting old China, very regal and opulent and the costumes and performances were first rate. Intermission drinks were pretty steep (A glass of Prosecco was $15! Full intermission drinks menu here: diningatmetopera.com/Fil…) - we ordered anyway, but man, two intermissions and two rounds of drinks were $$. Great people watching in the lobby!",3,,
12,Kimberly B.,"Silver Spring, MD",20,136,912,4.0,5/21/2017,"This review is only on the venue not the performance. So I went on Sat night for an ABT performance of Don Quixote when Misty Copeland was performing. My tickets were at will call. I arrived at 7:15 because I saw that doors open at 7:30. I easily retrieved my tickets from will call. My issue was the queue to get into the theater wasn't a line at all. It was a mass of people aimlessly pressing in waiting for the doors to open. The guards there were encouraging folks to move forward until the doors were open to keep the main doorways open. It was a mess and it was hot. In hindsight, I should have just waited until they opened the doors and then went to sit down. Since the seats are already assigned there's really no reason to be all bunched up. You go through a security checkpoint before you enter. They let us go through security and then we were told to wait a few min more before the theater doors opened. My seats were in the orchestra level in the front on the left. I had no problem viewing anything and enjoyed being that close. After the show was over it was another mess exiting the theater. I'm not sure how you enforce order on the departure but almost feel like they could dismiss by levels to avoid clusters. No videos are photos are allowed during the performance which is expected..however, during curtain call people were taking photos and videos. So I did it too and an usher was right next to me and didn't say anything to us.Bottomline: be prepared to be pressed against before or after the show unless you delay your arrival or departure. Certain seats will limit your view of the stage (extreme left or right) so pay attention to the seating chart.",3,,

Updated review","Great customer service - I called today and asked a few questions about their tour, seating, sponsorship and all answers were spot on and helpful.  Romeo and Juliet on Tuesday night- psyched.UODATE: This venue was very elaborate and people seemed somewhat full of themselves . The venue itself was fine and was as expected.  My seat was available, the ushers were a bit snooty and the concession drinks are ridiculously priced.  I came to see a performance not to support the salary of 10 people.  Overall,  the 1965 building needs some work and hopefully will get some.  The opera was good and orchestra was in point. Their met titles on seat backs is cool too.  Would come back prepared with snacks and a bottled water.  The shop had a great selection of souvenirs and gifts.",2,,
16,Brittany P.,"Branchburg, NJ",207,123,500,5.0,6/25/2017,"The MET will always be a place near and dear to my heart, and a place that everyone should experience at least once in a lifetime. I've been going to the MET since I was 6 years old. Having started dance lessons (mostly ballet) at the age of 3, my mother took me to see American Ballet Theater perform. I imagine at that time I wasn't the best sport sitting through a 3 hour performance, but those trips to the MET with my mother became a yearly tradition. The older I grew, the more I was able to appreciate what this place stands for. It is New York City's home of the finest talents, a place where people of all ages, races and backgrounds can come because they all share a passion - or least an appreciation - for the performing arts. We typically order ahead in the fall for the following spring's performances and have our tickets mailed ahead of time, so no issue with ticket retrieval. If you come for a Saturday matinee (2pm) be sure to arrive around 1pm so you have time to explore the Lincoln Center Plaza, take pictures by the fountain, use the restrooms and make your way through the lines in time to be seated comfortably prior to start.",3,,1
17,Deborah K.,"Riverside, CA",16,3,0,1.0,7/5/2018,Extremely disappointed.  60 seconds late due to NY Subway & they made us wait until Act II to be seated along with others who were as much as 40Minutes late.  Uncalled for given our seats were in the back of the Dress Circle section and we paid full price for them.  Lesson in how not to treat patrons.,,2,

Updated review","The MET opera that I have grown to love over the years.As expected, everyone was here to see and hear Plácido Domingo, who was amazing tonight, but the star of the show was Olga Peretyatko as Violetta Valéry. What a performance. She was a last minute replacement for Carmen Giannattasio (who was sick). She arrived from Russia the day before in preparation for Rigoletto in couple of weeks and had only four hours to prepare for La Traviata tonight. Quite remarkable.Standout performance also from the Brazilian tenor Atalla Ayan as Alfredo Germont and Nicola Luisotti, the conductor of the MET Opera.",5,1,4
21,Mitch R.,"Brooklyn, NY",545,7,0,5.0,2/11/2018,"Seeing Wagner performed at Lincoln Center was an incredible experience. While I wouldn't recommend a 5 hour tragedy opera for a first date option (or even a second), it is the perfect excuse to put a suit on and not look at your phone for a while.Lincoln center is an experience in itself - an already-impressive facade opens into a hall covered in red velvet, gold railings and filled with pretty people in tailored suits, some tuxes and evening gowns.I'm not qualified to speak about the performance of Parsifal we saw, but from my rookie point of view it was nothing short of a spectacle. Every aspect of the production was center stage... Bravo!Pro tip: Get there on time! Also, to be frank, don't be cheap on the seats - go big or go home.",,,

You will miss everything that haopens in the sharp stage right, but it is worth it. The people who work there are sort of curt. Rushing you without a smile, and demanding to know where you are going. They could smile a little more Maybe that is the culture. Overall the building is beautiful and I enjoyed Don Quixote.",1,,
24,Jane B.,"Buffalo, NY",268,397,4840,5.0,4/27/2016,"I recently attended La Boheme (my first opera) at the Metropolitan Opera House and I became an immediate fan!  I was truly taken aback by the beauty of the opera house.  Standing outside the opera house at night with the fountain lit up was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen!  The inside of the house is just as beautiful.  The chandeliers are gorgeous, very unique.  There are also two original Chagall paintings on the walls.The seats were nice and comfortable.  The opera was in Italian, so I appreciated the option of having subtitles flash on the screens in front of our seats.  It was cool because the screens were set in such a way that only the person sitting directly in front of them could see the words.  This prevents others who do not wish to see the subtitles from being distracted.The voices, music and set design of La Boheme were breathtaking.  The story was easy to follow with the subtitles.  I also liked the multiple intermissions between acts.  It gave us a nice opportunity to explore the building and walk around the balcony.  I hope to return again soon for another show!",6,2,5

Updated review","The National Council Audition Finals were truly spectacular and the sold out audience frequently went wild because of the superb quality of the contestants.On the other hand, Fidelio was a great disappointment: the staging was boring and poorly conceived, the use of a modern venue and costumes was lackluster, and the voices, except for Leonora, were surprisingly weak.Meanwhile, a tip on seats: Unless you want to pay a high price for awful seats, do not choose the back rows behind  the Grand Tier boxes. These are not really 'partial view'- instead, they are virtually no view unless you stand up.As I wrote before, the women's bathroom situation is deplorable!",2,,1

27,Courtney D.,"New York, NY",641,88,519,5.0,3/10/2016,"The opera is one of the most underrated city attractions. Who: There are three crowds of people who attend the opera. You have the NYC elites who throw money at anything. You have the theater lovers. Then, you have the tourists who are completely under-dressed.There are big efforts to get a younger crowd into the scene. What: The Metropolitan Opera houses the best talent in the world. The Metropolitan Opera requires heavy strong voices because there are not any microphones to amplify the performers voices. So, remember to clap loud for your sopranos who are able to carry on for hours without any amplification. The performances are likely to be written in Italian. I would recommend reading a summary of the entire play before you go and watch it. When: There is a show playing everyday. They rotate the operas so the performers can rest their voicesWhere: Lincoln Center. The UWS can be a pain in the neck to get to. I recommend eating at Joanne's Trattoria beforehand. The opera house is one of the most impressive architectural structures in NYC. The chandeliers are like nothing you have ever seen before. Be sure to check out the exhibits in the basement and the wall of opera fame.",5,2,2

I can tell you all that the San Francisco opera house is more stunningly opulent and lovingly adorned than the Met. The performance of Tosca was fantastic- the sets unparalleled and as usual, all performers were first rate. Attending an opera at the Met is a must- you will not be disappointed.",,,
29,Linda L.,"Seattle, WA",103,268,316,5.0,1/9/2017,"The MET is one of my favorite places in the world. I've seen a number of productions over the years and I'm still awestruck every time I go. For instance, recently I saw Nabucco, and they actually set the set on fire during the scene where the city is taken.Their occasional abridged, English-language adaptations of opera favorites like The Magic Flute or the Barber of Seville are a great way to introduce friends to opera. Student tickets are available for $25 for most productions. But even when those sell out, you can go the day of any performance to the box office on the morning of the performance to get standing room tickets for $25. Those tickets are seriously worth it, and honestly, the standing room location is pretty comfy for what it is. Best value for what you get I'd say. Not that there's anything wrong with the Grand Tier... heck, if I had the money I'd get seats there more often. ;-)If you don't know Italian or whatever the language your opera of choice is in, fear not! Every seat has its own subtitle screen that can be adjusted to display titles in English and usually a few other languages.",3,,2
30,Shen Q.,"San Francisco, CA",722,115,507,5.0,1/20/2017,"Met Opera is the epitome of opera art, thanks tremendously to America's hegemonic position after World War II (while the European artists were all fleeing to America). I have been to Opera Garnier, Opera Bastille, Opera Prague and despite their historical intimacy with where opera was rooted, Met has the best production team and singers as well as the most beautiful modern architecture to house this European tradition in a modern metropolitan city.Needless to mention, the singing is the best in class. Whether it is the main character, or a random character who just has one line, quality of singing is almost impeccable.What really impresses me and what sets Met Opera apart is its creative staging. As we know, opera art is passed down on via music score and libretto while the stage setting is somehow up to interpretation. Met Opera has taken advantage of this opportunity really well to recreate this traditional art to modern audience. For some shows, it has retained the historical authenticity (e.g., Don Giovanni, La Nozze di Figaro) but for some others, it has completely come out of the box to use modern stage setting (e.g., La Traviata, Rigoletto). If you are looking for visual extravaganza, Met Opera also has something for you (and even better than Broadway show). For Turandot, it literally recreated a Chinese palace on the stage; for Aida, it even brought a horse on stage while the army was preparing to set out; for die meistersinger, a little village market was moved indoors. You are surely to be amazed.Several tips on attending the shows: 1) If you are a student, remember to get student membership with your student ID. It's entirely free and with that, you can buy orchestra tickets for just $35. If orchestra tickets are sold out, you can bring whatever tickets you have (even family circle) and go to the box office right before the performance and tell the guy/lady there you want to switch to better seat in orchestra. They will do it for you!2) Come ON TIME! I came here once slightly after the performance started and wasn't allowed in until the end of Act I (like 1/3 of the entire show).3) Bring binoculars if you are sitting way up and/or way back. You can hear everything clearly because of the acoustics but you won't be able to see clearly because the opera is HUGE!4) Eat something if you plan to eat afterwards. Opera is usually 3+ hours and you will probably be starving if you wait towards the end. Bring some little snacks or just buy at the bar, which might charge a little more than usual.",2,1,1
31,Elizabeth C.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,144,1080,5.0,1/21/2016,"AMAZING!! I saw La Boheme on Tuesday night and loved it! My boyfriend and I had a great date night here. It's super fun to get dressed up--some men were even in tuxedos. Our tickets were at willcall and it was easy to pick them up. We then scanned our tickets with the usher and went through a very fast security check (it was barely anything at all.) The interior is absolutely gorgeous. I really loved the whole experience! We sat in the family circle section because it's supposed to have the best acoustics, but next time I'd like to sit in the balcony. I realized that the top bit of the set was cut off from viewers in our section! Still, the sets were the best I've ever seen in any kind of production. Seriously stunning. I really don't even know how to describe them because they were so gorgeous, elegant, and detailed. Each seat has little individual subtitle screens in front of them, and they're available in English, Spanish, and German. These were great! They're made so that only the person sitting directly in front of it can see it, so they don't distract other viewers. There were two intermissions of 30 minutes each. The only negative thing I have to say is that they should put more stalls in the restrooms, and also maybe expand the bar somehow! I spent the first part of intermission just waiting in line. We still had time to admire the view from the balcony and make our way to one of the lower levels to get drinks, but as soon as we got them, we had 5 minutes to get back upstairs. Unfortunately, we had to drink them really fast and sit down again. Overall though, I had a really great time here and would love to go back. Everyone working that night was great and the entire venue is amazing and classy. The tickets are affordable, too!",3,2,1
32,R. K.,"Valhalla, NY",12,470,1,4.0,9/12/2017,Visually what's not to like about The Met. The handsome outside area - the beautiful inside lobby and stunning architecture. Attending the Rock Opera Quadrophenia sitting in the lower balcony we found our seats comfortably overlooking the stage. The acoustics were terrific as music and lyrics were clearly heard. Aesthetics aside there are interior issues in this building - particularly the extremely small bathrooms. With ridiculously long lines one can miss part of the program. I actually had to venture to another floor to wait on a shorter (yet still long) line. Also the refreshment areas at intermission become a burden as well due to (yet again) long lines.Parking - while expensive ($49) is around the corner on 62nd Street. Easy access out and about - especially if you're going to the Henry Hudson Parkway.,,,
33,Charles C.,"Fall River, MA",0,7,0,1.0,12/21/2017,"I have a complaint regarding my experience at the Metropolitan Opera. We attended on 12/17/17 to see Norma at 1pm.Since we are from out of town and had difficulty using the public transportation, we arrived at 1:04pm. We were told that the show had started and sent to the auditorium with the closed circuit television.  We were told that we could not proceed to our seats until Intermission.When we got to that auditorium, we found that indeed the orchestra had started, but the opera singers did not start for another 10 minutes. I am very upset that this is how they treat their customers! There are other options. For example, we could have been let into the standing room area. I had purchased seats in the second level box. It would have been easy to show us to the box with no disruption to any other patrons or the performance. Instead, we paid $356 to watch half the opera on Television.The auditorium where we were sent to watch half the show on Television did not even have subtitles for the performance. This is a horrible way to treat customers, and this was a horrible first experience at the Metropolitan Opera.I have no intention of ever attending the Metropolitan Opera ever again.I expected more, especially at the prices that they charge. I noticed that there were many empty seats for this performance.

Sometimes the contemporary staging works brilliantly, and sometimes it doesn't.  But even when the producer's vision is imperfect, the crew executes perfectly, the cast is good, and the show turns out pretty solid.For opera aficionados, the Met is a must visit.  For those who aren't opera buffs, don't be intimidated.  At the Met, the views and acoustics are good enough from even the cheapest seats, the subtitle screens work great for those who want them and won't be a distraction for those who don't, etc.  And, these days, one won't feel out of place no matter what one wears.  If you want to get decked out black-tie style, you'll be in good company, and every show has some people in sweats, for those who want to keep it comfortable (and there are people everywhere in between).  Personally, I'd encourage people to sport business casual attire at the minimum since I think you lose some of the experience of the beautiful venue if you're dressing for the gym, but don't let attire keep you from seeing a good show (I dress up in semi-formal attire when it's convenient, but if I have a long train ride up, I ditch the jacket for clothes that will be comfortable for the ride, and I've never felt underdressed at all).Anyway, they bring in the best soloists, they have a great chorus, a wonderful orchestra, a crew that executes perfectly on the staging, and a venue that's beautiful and comfortable with pretty solid acoustics.  Definitely worth a visit.",2,1,3

The three-hour ballet displayed some of the most fabulous, intricately-detailed costumes I've ever laid eyes upon. The dancer playing Princess Aurora had many solos to show off her immense talent, but I found the scenes with the Wicked Fairy Godmother most entertaining (leave it to me to side with the wicked.) As gorgeous as the production was, I have to admit that The Met itself is a scene-stealer. It's the biggest character in any performance, as the heavy gold curtains are the first, & last thing you see after the cast's final bow. The grand, gold stage & the grandeur of the auditorium space is so dazzling, it must be experienced at least once when in town. Enter the glass structure with stunning starburst chandeliers & red-carpeted staircases & you're in for a visual tour de force.

This show is my all time favorite due to its saucy story, great music, and also the kind of mysterious background of ancient china. This is also the first opera I watched when I was a teenager. The first time I watched Turandot is DVD version of 1980's Domingo and Eva Marton MET version, which is so astonishing that i watched 20 times. This is also a tragic idea because no modern version in MET now can every compete. It has to be both good at singing and performing to make a good opera. Unfortunately, yesterday's tenor is very good for singing, but terrible for performing. Not drama enough, especially during the riddle part and the suicide part. He's just standing there, not nervous at all. When he was persuading the princess, he didn't show eagerness or strong love. The soprano had an extremely narrow voice, which is so mediocre. There is not enough emotion, and I cannot have any empathy. The music of this opera at the end when the princess try to rationalize is quite splendid, and if it was combined with good voice, you can feel deep understanding and thrilling.

44,Bill S.,"Litchfield, CT",202,588,1,5.0,1/9/2017,"The Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center is Valhalla for many operaphiles. It is the premiere America opera house and ranks among the world's finest. It features distinguished artists and performances from September into May, an extraordinary lengthy schedule. Even for those with only a mild interest in opera, it is a must-see for its prominent role in American culture over a century and a half. Ticket prices are usually hundreds of dollars (and thousands for special engagements), but day-of tickets or standing room tickets ($25) are often available by checking with the box office. A backstage tour offered at various times during the year is a delight no matter your knowledge of Verdi or Wagner. The auditorium seats 3,800, making it by far the largest major opera house in the world. Many veteran opera-goers find it an impressive, elegant interior, though some others find its glories aging poorly. There are worn parts here and there, but overall its gold and red opulence is difficult to deny. This is not a review of specific performances (we'd suggest avoiding Yelpers whose commentaries are mostly focused that way); We've seen hundreds of performances since our first visit in 1968, and while most have been memorable, there have been bad evenings. But the casts are often of high quality, more so now than decades ago when the secondary casts were occasionally lamentable. The chances are that if you go now you'll hear excellent singing on just about any evening. The same is true for the conductors and the orchestra, which now ranks among the best orchestras you'll ever hear, in or out of the opera house. The dress code is easy to follow: anything goes. Seriously. You'll find high fashion, tux and long dresses alongside jeans and sweaters. And as long as your attire includes shirt and shoes, you'll get in. Don't worry about style; focus on the opera. There are snack stands on three levels; sandwich and drinks (alcoholic and otherwise) are available before performances a d during intermissions -- which last about 25 minutes on average - but they aren't cheap. There is a stylish and very pricey restaurant on the mezzanine level. the food is decent if unexceptional, and reservations are necessary. By the way, we've always found the restrooms for men and women to be way too small. Expect long lines during intermissions and don't dawdle or you might get locked out of the auditorium (the Met is very clear that if you aren't inside the auditorium when the performance begins, you won't be admitted until there's a suitable break; remember this). If you're going to NYC, you owe it to yourself to see a performance at the Met. If it's not opera, you can always see a ballet there in late spring, but er believe that since it's an opera house, go for the singing. Check out the schedules online and prepare yourself for a unique experience, one you won't find anywhere else.",2,1,3

They also have free water cups and water fountains. The chandeliers inside have a very modern look. There is an open lobby where you see several levels of stairs and terraces on the inside of the building. There is no dress code, but everyone seemed to be wearing formal attire. Suits or portions of suits on the men or otherwise dressed nicely. Many dresses and various open-ish dresses on the women, despite the cold weather outside.

Obviously the 1st tier holds some of the best seats both visually and acoustically.Also, the stage is a decent size, actually, for the city it's quite large.

Thankfully, our seats were equipped with screens that provided me english subtitles the entire night. Storyline was great and I highly recommend Rigoletto even though it was a tragic romantic opera.

54,Edward M.,"Corning, NY",53,936,2941,4.0,1/17/2016,"Classical opera is a tough business, it requires a full orchestra and chorus, soloists whose voices can fill a large auditorium without amplification and state-of-the art stagecraft; it's expensive to produce, and difficult to fill the house. Decades ago we used to go more often, but prices weren't as high then, fortunately, now the Met often has $25 day of tickets available, and thus we sometimes go back (this time to see The Pearl Fishers, and sorry, but The Times' rave review wasn't warranted; there's a reason it's been decades since it was last staged there). The Met had a grand house which they torn down in the 1960's when they made the move to Lincoln Center. Although the Met is grand opera in the USA, the house itself has a slightly dated look, with a somewhat garish lobby and somewhat faded auditorium. That said, it's as good as it gets in the USA, and a distinctly American house. Many European cities have historic gilded opera houses (such as Paris' jewel-box-like Garnier) and some have built new houses with mixed success (including the architecturally unfortunate Opera Bastille, also in Paris), but the Met is one of the few purpose-built Opera houses in the USA still in use for that art form and everyone should get there, at least once, no matter what their cultural background or musical tastes!In terms of logistics, Lincoln Center has (pricey) underground parking; if you get lucky you may find street parking, particularly heading west toward the river, but don't count on it. You can also take the #1 subway line to 66th Street/Lincoln Center. The Opera House is accessible, but be sure to make appropriate arrangements when booking tickets for an accessible seat. Some, but not all, facilities are accessible as well. There is fine dining as well as a separate bar on the Grand Tier and upscale grab and go food and drink on both the orchestra and lower levels before the curtain and especially at intermission. If you wish to leave the house during intermission be sure to obtain a reentry ticket first (it is separate from the ticket that is scanned when you first enter). Unlike many European opera houses, the Playbill program book is complimentary in NYC! There is a gift shop, but it is entered separately from the Opera House auditorium (no ticket required).",1,,1

If I'm backstage, tell me about scenery, lights, costumes, etc. There was so much fascinating stuff to see, but we were offered minimal information. Oh, and they have you sit in the auditorium for 20 minutes learning about the Old Met building. Huh?",1,,

75,Isabella W.,"Queens, NY",394,513,228,5.0,1/30/2014,"I believe everyone should go to the opera at least once in their lives (even if it isn't your thing): Chose a desired genre, score a decent seat and dress up a bit. The Met is beautiful and classic, and being amid all the attendees is an experience.Do your research regarding the seating when purchasing the ticket. Not all of Orchestra section is great. How much are you into just listening to the show live versus seeing all the stage set and the singers? Maybe Family Circle is for you. Do you have a compact low power binocular? Bring it. While you don't need to use it all the time, it is fun and cool to check out more details that can be hard to catch if you are not sitting up close. Afraid that you might get too bored? Chose a production that is more of a ""spectacle"". Afraid that you won't understand what the heck they are singing? Fear not, there are subtitles!It is very easy to easy to get to Lincoln Center by subway (and they have a basement level parking garage, for a not small fee...). I recommend you to arrive 15-30 minutes before showtime as once the curtains are withdrawn, you won't be allowed to enter. You will be directed to the side room where they have the live broadcast of the play in HD (no subtitles) until the intermission.I heart The Met.",6,3,5

We saw Madama Butterfly, which is an extremely tragic story, but the minimalist set is unbelievable; it really comes down to the genius lighting and vibrant colors. The translation displayed on the seat ahead of you (same concept as on airplanes), was extremely helpful at times. I tried to glance at it every once in a while because the translations aren't as beautiful as the music. My only complaint is that my family was siting in row F on the second tier and the acoustics of the place didn't project the sound loud enough. I was expecting for the opera to go right through me, but I think it was a bit lacking because the volume was too low for me (my family had the same sentiments).

The performance was great and the cast was hilarious. It's one of my favorite plays so it was interesting to see it as an opera. The venue itself is beautiful. My eyes kept being drawn to the amazing chandeliers. I wouldn't recommend getting the seats in side boxes though. You're missing part of the stage. Also when you have to look at lyrics, you're angled in such a way that your neck is constantly moving sideways up and down to see what's going on on the stage.

I'm no connoisseur, but I try to make it out once a year, and I've had the privilege to see amazing productions like Aida, Faust,  The Flying Dutchman,The Magic Flute, La Traviatta, and most recently, Eugene Onegin.The red velvet seats at this location, which opened in 1966, somehow look both vintage and immaculate every season. Everything from the entrance with its Chagall murals, starburst crystal chandeliers, cantilevered stairways, and the massive but somehow still intimate auditorium, with the holiday touch of the classy X-Mas tree and train set sitting on the second floor ledge outside....is just right.It's a great shoulder-rubbing session between Old New York and the 21st Century Gotham, old money and new, foreign and local.

83,Jen K.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",1,95,5,1.0,3/15/2015,"NO. Just no. I was subjected to this bad boy for the three years I lived in NYC. Wait, before I continue: I love opera and have been to most of the major houses in North America and Western and Northern Europe. I grew up listening to and attending opera. I currently live in Copenhagen and I am deeply in love with BOTH of our opera houses. But I HATE THE MET. I hate it so much that once I ""get started"" I often rant on and on about it until I cut myself off. If I could give it negative stars, I would. I say this having been there tens of time and having been a subscription holder. With that in mind, I am not sure where to start. There's just so much wrong! There is a very good reason for why the Met stopped shipping Opera News to its guild members: Opera News was tellin' it like it is (it is horrifyingly bad and shameful) and the Met retaliated by breaking ties. Ok, let's start withThe Gizmo. Maybe they've fixed it in recent years but it used to be so that if you were sitting in orchestra, you would hear whirring coming from The Gizmo (a large piece of machinery that was custom built to drive the Met's stage pieces). Yeah, in the best seats in the house whirring and grinding would interrupt beautiful arias. Because of that I started buying tickets in Family Circle. But guess what? People routinely eat in Family Circle!!! Yeah. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. I attended tens of performances at the Met and it was ROUTINE that someone would freaking break out a damn sandwich and eat it. Chocolate was also popular, complete with crinkling wrappers. I still hear the crinkle of those damn wrappers in my nightmares. What are we, animals? God, try that in Europe and see what happens.  Oh and the sets? I kinda almost exactly never saw a set that I thought was amazing. Some were passable, but many were laughable disastrous manifestations of sheer WHAT. They'd often try to blend classical staging with modern staging and get it all wrong. I remember Cosi Fan Tutte basically had big piles of dirt on stage the whole damn time. That is not avante garde (I love a good avante garde production) that is an insult. The direction and blocking were... How to put this? I mean, opera is normally tragic, right? But not in the sense that it's ridiculous to watch which is what it normally was. It was just often... Awk-weird. That's an ok way to put it. I also rarely attended a performance without major blocking and/or set-related mistakes. Memorable ones: during Die Wauker, during the climatic ride of the Valkyries one of the poor Valkyries fell off her Gizmo driven rocking horse, through the hole it rocked into in the stage and was hit on the head with it. AND THE AUDIENCE LAUGHED. Again, what the f*** people, are we ANIMALS? Seriously, she could have been injured and people laughed. It was gruesome. She was ok, but still. Also, I do not know when the house has last been renovated but it is a disgrace. I felt deep shame when I would take Europeans here and I would often apologize saying something along the lines of ""I know, I know, this is supposed to be our grandest house, I'm shocked too, every time I set foot in here I am shocked"". The paint is literally flaking off the ceiling, the carpets are threadbare. For chrissakes there are even ASHTRAYS in the crowded bathrooms still. Ashtrays. From, like, the 60s when smoking inside was still legal. Egress is a horrible pain. In most major houses, even the old ones like La Scala, they've been revamped so that you can get out with relative ease. If there is ever a fire in here, hundreds of people are going to die. Do NOT check your coat and expect to get out in the rush directly after the show in any reasonable amount of time. Wait, what am I saying: do NOT go here in the first place. That's a better solution.  Wait, ok, fine: the music was often good. The conductor (Levine) was good and the performers were often good. I felt bad for them, but that just couldn't make up for how cartoonishly horrible the rest of it is. Also, I feel like the acoustics are only middling and not ""superb""  by any means as so many on Yelp seem to moan on and on about. I don't think they're the lowest point of the whole ordeal, but I also didn't think they were great or even good comparatively. In fact, I think they suck and should be revamped as at least one house has done-- forget which one, but it IS possible and SHOULD be done to the Met. In fact, the whole damn thing needs an overhaul. I would, frankly, suggest firing everyone, tearing it down and starting anew. Also, on one last positive note, the ushers were mostly nice and decently trained. Which IS a major plus. But I don't rank opera houses by how nice the ushers are, I rank them by how good the experience is and this is the bottom of the barrel in terms of major opera houses I've been to. Frankly, it's a disgrace and it frustrated the HELL out of me for years. Good riddance.",7,5,1

98,Sabrina L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,0,5.0,1/16/2016,"Think of this as True Confessions of a Lifelong Opera-Lover.I spent my childhood singing and a portion of my adulthood stage managing, so I've spent a lot of time onstage, backstage, and in the audience at San Francisco Opera and Chicago Lyric Opera. Those houses, where I ""grew up"" with opera, will always hold a special place in my heart. They're smaller houses that draw big names and mount robust seasons, and that's a treasure.But man, there's nothing like the Met, which I've been subscribing to for three years now. Designed to look like a jewel box, the facilities are amazing, and the chandeliers are truly magnificent. (One of the best parts of going to the Met is to watch them rise up into the ceiling right before the overture begins--don't miss that. It's easy to be lost in your program at the crucial moment.) The productions are high-value and world-class, the singing incredible (if you can see Jamie Barton in anything, do it--she's a rising star), and the repertoire more interesting than what you'll see in houses with fewer productions annually. Met audiences care more than other audiences--see the very vocal protesters in the back of the theater for The Death of Klinghoffer earlier this season, for example. This is an old art form, but it still stirs people here in a way I don't see as readily in other major American cities (Europe is another story).If you find yourself in the orchestra (which I've only done with rush tickets), you are among the lucky few seeing the opera the way it was staged to be seen. With a house so large as to sometimes be unwieldy, the nosebleed seats, while they get great acoustics, are so far up that you're not seeing things the way the director intended. Bring binoculars--they help tremendously.The other lifesaver? $25 Family Circle tickets. That's how I can afford five operas a season. If you like classical music, or even the high-production-value shows you see on Broadway, give opera a try--I'll bet you like it! Steer clear of Wagner or modern pieces if you're a first-timer, though. Point is: You're not too young, and you're not too poor. And yes, there are translated captions called Met Titles, so you'll understand what's going on.More pro tips: grab some water at the water fountain at either side door before you go in. There's a ladies room at the top house right corner of the Family Circle that has no wait, ever--great if you're sitting in the section. There's a gallery in the basement that you might find interesting if you have time to kill before a performance. And if you're in for a 30-min. intermission, consider running out to Bar Boulud across the street for your glass of champagne or cocktail--high quality and still cheaper than what they're hawking inside. (Check before you leave that you'll have in-out privileges, as I haven't tried this trick in a while.)",4,,

104,Gregory S.,"Reno, NV",61,31,3,5.0,4/1/2014,"A trip to New York would not be complete without  an elegant evening at the Metropolitan Opera. It is the best that America has to  offer when it comes to talent, architecture and design, set design, and programming. Having attending opera's in places like Prague, Budapest, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, (places where opera was born) I can safely say that the Met stands out among the best opera houses in the world.Unlike the opulent baroque opera houses from days of yore, this one showcases incredibly unique and contemporary architecture and design. From the soaring balustrades, to the walls of glass that compose the facade, to the gigantic Swarovski crystal chandeliers and lights that illuminate the interior, this building is a feast for the senses. Beyond the dramatic foyer, the auditorium is equally impressive. Seating is very easy and comfortable, and from the boxes to the balconies there isn't a bad seat in the house.The productions combine incredibly talented singers with beautiful and creative set designs that never fail to impress. Last season, Nemorio's lament ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" from Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore nearly brought me to tears. ""More I can't ask, I can't ask.Yes I could die! If I could die of love""Even Tchaikovsky's Queen of Hearts (an opera I don't particularly care for) was so well done that I was forced to reconsider. While some institutions programming can seem monochromatic, the variety of the operas at the Met is impressive. Russian, German, French, Italian, English, there is something for everyone. Granted tickets can get a little pricey, but there are plenty of options for those on a budget, and spending a little extra for a box seat or orchestra is a rare treat that is absolutely worth the money.Nothing makes you feel more accomplished than sipping champagne on the Grand Tier overlooking  Lincoln Square during intermission.

An evening at 'The Met' is always a very special night out for me personally. The Met provides the creme de la creme of everything: The best singers, orchestra, directors, set design, best everything. While walking towards the Metropolitan building with its unique architecture, you will first pass the pretty water fountain outside. Then you enter the lobby, which has a gorgeous cantilevered stairway, covered with burgundy red velvet. When you look up, there are Chagall artworks that are enormous. Gorgeous lighting includes breathtaking chandeliers. The auditorium has a gorgeous gold curtain... Impressive altogether.The Met is the largest classical music organization in North America. 27 different operas are presented each year, from classics like ""La Boheme' to modern operas and everything in between. The Metropolitan Opera is located in midtown west. No tourist galore like in Hells' Kitchen. Visitors of the Met appear to be for the biggest part the well off locals.  The 1 train literally has an escalator that will put you right next to the beautiful fountain in front of the Met. How convenient! After the opera is over, getting a cab can be a bit of a hassle, but like I said: The 1 train stops right there, at the Metropolitan! Cheaper, quicker, less hassle. : )Don't forget that ""The Grand Tier"" restaurant is in this building on the Tier level. A great way to combine fine dining with an exquisite musical experience. I recommend it! Have your courses in the intermissions, so that you can sit down, while everybody else will be looking at you with this jealous 'how come did I not come up with this'- look in their eyes. ; )My personal opinion on operas I have attended over the past year: *Madame Butterfly: Beautiful opera, wonderful orchestra and singers. Not the most emancipated kind of opera when you see how Madame Butterfly just eases into the underdog position. Just not my kind of storyline, with a woman that is pining away for 3 years, waiting for her cheating husband to return home with another wife, demanding the full custody of their child, then killing herself in the end. Hm. *Die Fledermaus: A 'tuneful farce', has beautiful set design, orchestra, and fantastic singers. Even though the story itself, the storyline and jokes were not always from the timeframe that Die Fledermaus originally is set to take place in, I did enjoy the performance altogether. Johann Strauss' recognizable songs were all beautiful! *Rusalka: With Renee Fleming singing her signature ""Song to the Moon' was just a very long performance. This, combined with the dim set lighting, almost made me fall asleep towards the end. I mean:  3 hours and  45 minutes is definitely a long haul. Music in this opera is much less recognizable than in for instance Johann Strauss' ""Die Fledermaus"".  I wonder if this opera ever would have gotten so popular, if it wasn't for that ONE famous ""Song to the Moon"", that everybody loves and knows.*Wozzeck: To each his own, but.... This opera was absolutely not my cup of tea at all. If you don't mind fresh language, and provocative sexual gestures on stages, and if you are into avantgarde operas with atonal music, you're all set. Bottom line:Every time I go, I feel very privileged to be there. I feel lucky to have access to all these great singers, directors and productions all the time. It's a shame if you don't go here at least once in your life. Try to be part of this experience one time. It is definitely worth it!",6,,1
109,Denise S.,"Toronto, Canada",90,714,858,4.0,7/2/2012,"The Met is pure class. There are few places that lend a sense of occasion like the Met. It's a beautiful space from the dramatic lighting to the plush red velvet details, gently curving staircases, and the 2 stunning Chagall murals. It's a place to really appreciate the arts. I've only been here to see the American Ballet Theatre, but I love the seatback screens for subtitles for the opera, available in multiple languages. Such a brilliant idea! For ballet, this is a lovely venue. Good sightlines and acoustics. Look for the used pointe shoes and ballet shoes for sale near the balcony! I also like how there are water fountains and cups at the back of the theatre. Only -1 star for long lineups at the washroom during intermissions.",1,1,3
110,Jennifer A.,"White Plains, NY",2,27,8,4.0,10/21/2014,"I have seen many an opera here and although the seats are tight and legroom is meant for those under 5'4"" it is still magical. Watching the lights rise and descend is always a treat. The gift shop is amazing so be sure to pick up a souvenir and a few gifts.Everything from the atmosphere, the set design, the costumes, the make up, the voices, everything about the opera is phenomenal.

You can tell that everyone who is associated with this place cares deeply about Opera. You get a few snobs, as well. But most of the folks here are friendly and passionate patrons of the arts. I had a chance to see Tosca here, among other fabulous productions, and they simply brought the house down. The praise showered down, non stop, from the last row in the balcony to the first row of the orchestra. There's very little more than can be said about the grandeur of this space. No words can do it justice. Just the sheer size of it, that spans several stories tall, will take your breath away. This is the quintessential NYC venue. This is art. This is New York. This is the Metropolitan Opera House.",1,1,1

117,Lauren H.,"Philadelphia, PA",42,189,7,5.0,4/6/2013,"So we were there the other night (Faust) and there were some kids that clearly don't seem to own any other shoes than sneakers and the hubs was offended. It's like this: did I love all of Oprah's book club picks? Obvs no. Did I love that she got people reading again? YAY! At least these kids showed up.  It is up to all of us to make sure that we remain a culturally literate society. Do I sound like a pompous windbag? Maybe. But only if you've never been to the opera because you think it's filled with pompous windbags. But the truth is: society cannot exist on reality television alone.So here is my opera primer (lifted from my review of Aida a few years ago. You can totes plagiarize yourself on Yelp.)Myself, I like the nosebleed seats. I am a Family Circle girl. (at least when I go alone) They level the opera playing field. Try them. They're cheap and you miss nothing. I have never been sorry that I went. I have never fallen asleep. I have been on the edge of my seat, mesmerized, amazed at the skills these people bring to the stage, the creativity of the set directors, the lighting, the costumes and the ability of the composers to tell these magical stories through song. It is truly a breathtaking experience. Those voices!!!! Think of Julia Roberts (hooker with a heart of gold - Pretty Woman) - she cried!Helpful Hints: take these serious, yo.No, you do not have to wear a tux or ball gown. Unless you are attending the premiere. In which case, you are not reading this. But for heaven's sake, please, make an effort! No jeans! No sneakers! No hats! (unless they are unobtrusive Facinators). Look like a grown up on a grown up night out. Be aware, however, those stairs are treacherous. Adjust heels accordingly. Do you not speak Italian, German or French? It's okay! There are subtitles just for you! Even If you speak Portuguese! A fun thing to do is read the synopsis of the first few acts if you're not familiar with the work, but not the last two. Seriously - surprise yourself!Ladies: wear clapping jewelry. Look, I wish someone would remind me of this. Large rings and bangles hurt. You are expected to clap. A lot.Wear layers, but not bulky ones. There is a coat check, but do you want to be there at the end of the night? You're gonna have to sit with your shit, so don't bring a lot. It is a tight squeeze in that room.Bringing us to the most important: Eat before you go and drink nothing. Yeah, it's a long show. 3-6 hours, depending on the show. Eat protein and whole grains before you go and don't drink for at least a few hours before show time. You are gonna have so many places to go and soooo much to talk about afterward. Trust me, your American bladder can stand some dehydration. Take Altoids and cough drops as provisions. Everyone will appreciate this.And lastly: BRING SOME TISSUES! I'm not suggesting that you're gonna Pretty Woman all over the place, but you'll need a place to put your snot. Cause it's winter, and we all have some.Wait - no - this is my lastly: WAIT UNTIL GROUP SINGING OR APPLAUSE TO HOCK THAT LUGEY!Here's the best part - go - and then tell your friends you went. I guarantee that at least half of them will tell you they want to go. Take them! Indoctrinate others!!! Do it!! You are in the greatest cultural mecca of of the world!!! Take advantage!!!!!!And now, you, my friend, are ready for the opera.",29,25,15

120,Jewel Y.,"New York, NY",33,776,3421,5.0,4/16/2011,"The Met is one of the reasons why I love NY so much. It's a real blessing and privilege to have an easy access to such spectacular world class live opera performances!! The Met opera inspired me to study Italian more seriously so that I can actually understand what the opera singers are saying besides following Del Piero gossip news. Unlike the opulent Neo-Baroque style opera houses of Europe, the architecture of The Met is very modern and almost too simple for my taste. However, the stage set production was absolutely stunning, I particularly love the extravagant stage designed by the legendary designer Franco Zeffirelli. I admire his magnificent grandiosity, attention to detail, elegance and over-the-top glitziness!! His ""Turandot"" production is a must-see, and it's one of the most memorable operas I've ever seen in my life!!! 10 star!!!!So far my favorite operas are:1)Turandot - It's the best!!!!! So breathtaking!!!!! Marcello Giordani singing ""Nessun Dorma"" was priceless, it was so beautiful that it moved me to tears!2)Aida - I saw it twice and this is just as amazing as Turandot in terms of the music, ornate stage set, and costumes. I highly recommend to splurge on this one....Get a ""Dress Circle"" seat at least!!! Expect some tear-jerking scenes!3)Don Giovanni - Erwin Schrott is such a stunning barihunk!! Mmmm!!! He's the PERFECT cast for Don Giovanni! Rico suave, 100% mujeriego sinvergüenza! LOL!! Saw him twice!! I can't wait to see him again....come back to The Met soon!!!4)Carmen- So fierce, so independent, so fearless, so sexy, so passionate, and so crazy!! I LOVE CARMEN!!!5)Madama Butterfly - Avant-garde , innovative, and minimalistic  visual approach was so dramatic and powerful! I loved how they adopted the Japanese theater tradition without being so cliche and cheesy. So artistic!!6)Die Zauberflöte -I saw this twice too, and I'm gonna see it yet again and again. This is the cutest opera!!! And the visual is so surreal and mesmerizing, Julie Taymor rocks!!!! Pa pa pa papagenaaaaa!7)Thaïs - Renée Fleming was superb!! I saw this without not knowing much about Massenet's work but I was blown away. 5 star!!8)La Traviata- Jonas Kaufmann and Angela Gheorghiu were both brillilant!!! They defy the stereotypes of opera singers - they aren't fat and are rather attractive. The glitzy Franco Zeffirelli production was in full swing again! So opulent and elaborate, this is so my kind of opera. Love it!9)Le Nozze di Figaro - Soooo hysterical!! Love Mozart's sense of humor! And ofcourse, the music is so beautiful and catchy!!10)Il Trovatore-Very dramatic music, I love the chorus part!11)La Rondine - The real-life couple Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna did a phenomenal job! The charming and romantic Art Nouveau/Art-Deco stage really captured the glamour of the era. I loved Angela's ravishing period costume in Act 1, she looked like she came right out of the Klimt's painting!12)Stiffelio - One of Verdi's less popular operas of scandalous subject about a married minister whose adulterous wife had an affair with a hot young lover.  I was blown away by the dramatic soprano singer, Julianna Di Giacomo. What a stunning voice! Placido Domingo conducted the orchestra, which was interesting. Overall, Stiffelio was surprisingly good!13)Simon Boccanegra - The 69-year old tenor Placido still rocks!! I love how he keeps challenging himself with new genre, his debut as a baritone was filled with dignity and warmth. Bravo!!As you can see, Verdi, Puccini, and Mozart are my faves. Since I'm not an opera-connoisseur, I appreciate these three masters more because the melody is more understandable and catchy.The ones I thought were OK:1)Rigoletto-Too depressing and upsetting!! I used to love ""Donna e Mobile"" until I found out the context...the Duke is such a jerk!!! A total DB!! I appreciate the beauty of tragedy but this is too devastating!!2)La Boheme - I just never found the story line intriguing, sorry! The music is fantastic, but not my favorite.3)Adriana Lecouvreur - Placido Domingo sang with such elegance despite his age, and the production was great, but somehow I didn't find it very memorable. I don't know why.4)Tosca - the new production was waaaay too minimalistic and boring. Took away the drama and grandeur too much. Bring back old school please!Not my cup of tea:1)Satyagraha - too avant-garde and too monotonous. I nearly fell asleep.Make sure you buy the tickets early because almost every single opera is sold out. The Met is recession-proof!! I don't think I'm ready for 5 hour Wagner opera, but I'd like to expand my horizon eventually",9,1,6

126,David L.,"New York, NY",833,1138,1105,4.0,1/19/2009,"I love the hall itself... I think they sometimes over-amplify some of the vocalists--to make everything entirely audible to all audience members--which sometimes makes for an unnatural balance (example: Jochanan singing from the pit in Salome)... I think the Orchestra's horn section is very often quite sloppy... Beers are cheap, champagne isn't, the nibbles are good (especially the lemon tart)... The $20 Rush Tickets are amazing (even though you have to get there a few hours in advance and there's no real guarantee you will actually get a ticket), and so are the recent ticket lotteries they've been doing (again, there's no real guarantee you will actually get a ticket)... The Standing Room Tickets are an awesome bargain... My favorite affordable seats are center-area front-row of the balcony, and my favorite special occasion seats are the front-row of the second tier (the ""Grand Tier"")... People can be noisy in the family circle -- lots of kids there for their first opera, lots of old ladies for their thousandth opera, people loudly whispering, eating food, etc... People can be entirely too stuffy and pretentious--with their minks and tiaras and binoculars--on the orchestra level and first tier... I'm here often, at least once a week, constantly excited by the programming (Berg, Wagner, Prokofiev, R. Strauss, Bolcom, Janacek, Mozart, Gluck, Tchaikovsky, Rossini, Glass, Monteverdi, etc) although I wish they would take a few more risks more often in terms of modern productions and modern operas, and maybe stop pushing the same big names (some of whom are past their prime) at us again and again...",8,1,2

Each seat has their own mini subtitle screen. But it was distracting going back and forth from the stage and screen. I loved the Italian they sung. They made ordinary speech sound so beautiful. The opera theater is very beautiful and well kept as well.I did doze off a few times as the opera would linger on mundane situations. Like spending 20 minutes singing about how one character felt and it seemed to drag the story.If you do the rush drawing, keep in mind there are no refunds and the seats you get are random, so if you don't like the seats you get, re add the tickets to your cart to get different seats that you like.",1,,1

132,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4421,4417,35755,5.0,5/21/2007,"Here's the gospel according to the unsaintly Ed U...Going to the Met is something of a religious experience. In fact, I think I saw my  Diet Coke turn to merlot at one of their many bars. Now somebody cue the organ please.Ever since Nicolas Cage took a glammed-up Cher there in ""Moonstruck"", I have wanted to go to the Met. But opera intimidated me for years. Price was another issue. The cross-continental distance was yet another. Then there are the languages I don't understand spoken much less sung. Oh, and I also lack the appropriate wardrobe (...hey, we all can't look like Cher). When I arrived for my first-ever Met experience two years ago for a stunning performance of Handel's ""Rodelinda"" with superstar soprano Renee Fleming and countertenor extraordinaire David Daniels, I was awestruck beyond all expectations. As anyone who has seen the original version of ""The Producers"" knows, Lincoln Center is a bold complex of buildings with a striking fountain in the middle. I made the dire mistake of going into the Met gift shop right off, where I had to be constrained from buying something...anything...in this virtual candy shop.When I finally entered the theater as the Met ""virgin"" I was, I expected it to be much deeper than it is and certainly not nearly as tall. Crystal chandeliers soar upward before the performance begins...still one of the coolest sights ever. I was sitting in Row T down the center and free and clear from the overhanging balcony. I loved the English translation titles in front of me on my own personal scrolling screen. Wow, better than Jet Blue, I was thinking. I was already enthralled, and the curtain wasn't even open. Stephen Wadsworth's production of ""Rodelinda"" offered an extravagant Tuscan villa as its main set, but it moved across the stage to reveal an amazing library set and even elevated upward to reveal a darkened dungeon. The bell-like acoustics of the hall enhanced the already stellar performances of the cast. Never had I experienced an opera performance so fulfilling, so moving, so eye-catching until...Flash forward to last week, and I am back for a return visit, this time for choreographer Mark Morris' equally elaborate production of Gluck's ""Orfeo ed Euridice"" again starring David Daniels (coincidence?...I think not). Morris lent a fantastical element and seemed to have no problem filling the full height and width of the Met stage with three full tiers of ghostly historical figures as the chorus. Look! There's Princess Di...and Abraham Lincoln...and Gandhi...and... There was so much to take in that I found myself in sensory overload visually and aurally. There are floors upon floors of seating, and having been in both the upper balcony and the main orchestra, I can tell you the sound is pristine no matter where you are. The view is what varies considerably. If you can afford it, go for the back orchestra so you can see the entire stage. As a San Franciscan, I am jealous of all the New Yorkers who take the Met for granted. Sure, it ain't cheap (it's Broadway times two for a good seat)...but you are almost always guaranteed a spectacular experience every time you go.And no matter how many times you go, it feels like the first time. You can be a Met ""virgin"" again...and again...and again.",7,4,8

When we get there at 8:10 the entrance was jam packed with people. We waited patiently in line and when we got to the ticket person she directed us to talk to the 'box office manager' and be removed from line. WTF?!! I went to this 'manager' and he told me my ticket was a 'reprint'. I explained that THEY have messed up our initial ticket order and I had to call and make sure more tickets were sent so we could give our Nana her Christmas present. He was extremely rude... I mean extremely.I normally wouldn't do this but I reminded him about customer service. Guess that meant nothing to him because he told me I could 'just chill out.' What an old asshole!!Hey Met, if you want to stay in business through donations and ticket sales, you're going to need young 20-35 year olds coming to the opera.

For those that aren't in the know, this particular opera is about FIVE hours long -- thankfully this production had three(!) intermissions long enough to brave the super long bathroom lines and even grab a quick drink at the bar.We had seats all the way in the back, and I thought I'd have to bring my older companions some oxygen masks, plus we were definitely hitting our knees against the back of the seats in front -- however, the production was intensely gorgeous, and I valiantly tried to stay awake for the full time. Unfortunately my body may have decided at several periods that it was naptime, and given the pitch dark and long hours we all gave into our urges at one point or another.At the third intermission my body finally shut down from hanger, so the bf bought me a teeny brie-and-ham sandwich and some juice, which cost him a cool $18. At that point I'd already burned up a huge breakfast and several snacks we'd snuck in, so it was well worth the exorbitant amount for him not to get his arm eaten off. Tip: bring food, but not the kind with crackly wrappers, or you may irritate some of the more serious opera viewers.All in all, I'd definitely return to the Met for what is truly an extraordinary experience and a nice opportunity to wear another fancy dress. Next time I'll cross my fingers for Turandot, which is by far my favourite opera and worth the severe nosebleed and emotional tears for.",,2,

I was so enamored by this edifice and organization that I went on to volunteer at this institution for a short time and learned some of the more intricate things of this building.

How 'New York' is that? No. No. No. [Don't even start giving me excuses about informality; elitism; social striation; the democratization of art; class warfare--I don't want to hear it. ] There's no possible rationale for not dressing up for the METROPOLITAN OPERA.

At least this is what I had been brought to believe my entire life. My experiences here have been somewhat contradictory, and often times left me somewhat disappointed. To start, the location is absolutely fabulous! Lincoln Center is easily accessible and extremely beautiful. The Met Opera is the center piece of Lincoln Center. I have seen about 8-10 production over the course of several years. Often times the musical preparation is always top-notch, although the quality of singing does seem to vary quite a bit. One of my major complaints is the acoustics of the theater, although they are acceptable considering this is a 4,000 seat hall. The sound quality varies greatly from seat to seat. I have found that the best seats are generally those in the dress and family circle. The theater itself needs some maintenance. The carpet and facilities need some upgrading also. Another major issue is the layout of the theater which makes it a hellish nightmare getting in and out. Also there are often enormous lines for the bathrooms during intermissions and a snack will cost you a minimum of $16.00 for a small cookie/pastry. Overall, come here for the music!

Came here recently for Macbeth, which was nothing short of magnificent. Watching Shakespeare is SO.MUCH.BETTER than reading Shakespeare *shivers*. I wish I saw this back in high school; it is the ultimate cliff note! Here's what you need to know:- If you can't score a sweet student discount deal, there are affordable seats for approx $50 in the nosebleeds aka Family Circle.  Seats are a bit tight and legroom isn't the greatest. -Binocular rentals are available and will help a great deal, but not necessary. - Pay attention to the performance running time before purchasing. Some can run as long as 5 got-forsaken hours! - DO NOT ARRIVE LATE. You will be subjected to the Reject Room until there's a set change or intermission. [I hightailed it up four flights of stairs in heels and spanx. F u, reject room!]- There are digital translation panels in front of each seat.[Hooray technology]- It can get a bit overwhelming to read translations, watch the action and listen at the same time. When this happens, just close your eyes and listen to the music. It's magical!  [But don't fall asleep, for heaven's sake!]- Set changes between acts are NOT intermissions. If you leave and the show restarts, guess which room you'll be condemned to? - Restrooms and refreshments lines are painfully long during intermission. #necessaryevil-PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE: do not wear a bottle of cologne/perfume. Also, don't cough or sneeze. Ridiculous request I know, but trust, EVERYONE will hear you! I much prefer the ballet to the opera, but that takes nothing away from this dramatic and astounding art form.

I don't remember which production it was, but I remember being in awe. At the time, I was studying violin... I was 8. I vividly remember wanting to get a softee from the Mr. Softee Ice Cream truck that didn't even bother to stop by the white steps up the Met. My mother had no choice but to let go of my hand as I ran after it in disappointment. Then I turned back and walked up to meet her. I threw a penny in the fountain and wished. She tugged at my hand and said, it's time to go. I looked up ahead and saw the sun setting in the horizon. We walked in, hand in hand. Recently I attended a rendition of O'Negin. It was a ballet and done very well. We sat up close, Orchestra seats. The people in attendance were slightly younger than the regular crowd. I left very happy. I usually watch operas, however, the ballet is starting to become my new favorite. If you ever wanted to make me happy, take me to a Ballet or an Opera Production at the Met...

173,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,5.0,1/21/2011,"Prior to seeing my first opera ever on Thanksgiving Eve, 2010, my conception of the opera was built entirely on scenes from Edith Wharton novels and films such as Little Women, Amadeus, and The Godfather Part III. Knowing that my first operatic experience had a lot of potentially ridiculous illusions of grandeur to live up to, I did everything in my power to make sure that it would. Thus, I may never know what it's like to get rush tickets, take the subway, then sit all the way in the back of the tippity topmost tier with binoculars, because this is how I did it, and I'm not sure I'd want to do it any other way.First, I gave up waiting for a devastatingly handsome lover to sail in and plan everything for me, driven by an equal passion for classical performances. I would be the engineer of my own fantasy, and take someone else (none other than my mother dearest) on the ride. The pressure was on because I knew she'd been to The Metropolitan Opera and the London Opera House before. Then again, I knew that no one had thrown down on some top rate seats for her yet.After staking out an iconic title (Carmen) that was in its original language (unlike, alas, The Magic Flute, which would otherwise have been a contender), I set about finding The Perfect Seats. Calling (212) 362-6000 is the best way to do this. If the tickets cost almost as much as a pair of rountrip plane tickets, at least the box office staff lent me as much attention and patience as a travel agent. would give. IThe last person I spoke with was on my side; he didn't sigh when I refused to shell out $800 for a box. He didn't grumble when I asked him to check seating availability for a range of different days and times. He didn't bitch when I asked him to clarify the difference between the back orchestra, Parterre, Grand Tier, and dress circle again. And he totally hooked me up.He exclaimed, ""Ooh! Someone just returned a pair of tickets in row O, which is pretty much front and center, elevated enough to be clear of the orchestra pit. These are phenomenal seats."" Done.Next, I called the number on my ticket printout. Once again, the people were extremely helpful and patient in explaining the benefits of parking. Basically, you can park directly under the house from 4 p.m. to midnight. This is a must for someone coming in from out of town  with a car, because you can ditch your vehicle to wander around and even grab a nice dinner if need be, all for 38 bucks, the price of one crosstown cab ride slugging through rush hour traffic. Taking a limo would have been TOO ostentatious. What we did do on the day of was get dressed to the nines (we're talking furs and long dresses) and have our hair blown out by my awesome stylist friend. Then, I drove the scenic route down Central Park West as if I'd built this city, and my mother sat shotgun. The parking spot was easy to find, and the attendants pointed us to a convenient space on the mostly empty rubber matted floor. They weren't kidding when they said the garage was directly under the opera house. A glass door slid open and we were instantly in the plush red interior of the Metropolitan Opera, amidst people in all their finery, enjoying drinks and other concessions before the curtain call. Ascending the spirally stairs which evoked the inside of a fine snail shell, we went outside and took photos by the magical fountain in the plaza, whose beauty shall never be marred by pigeons or simpleminded tourists. We soon entered on the main floor and presented our tickets. Up the velvety stairs we went, marveling like children at the intricate starburst lighting but feeling quite sophisticated nevertheless.When we walked into the orchestra section, and my mother looked at me as if confused. That's right, Mom, this is really happening. Our seats were indescribably awesome; right on eye level with the performers and close enough to hear their spine tingling arias with orchestral accompaniment directly, without amplification. We took our places, and stared with anticipation at the gigantic curtain with a lightning bolt running down the center.  My mother's twinkling eyes reflected the gaudy, shameless thrill beating in my own chest.The backs of our seats displayed subtle subtitles. The mini marquees are engineered so you can't be disturbed by anyone else's screen. Unaware of this, I pressed my mother's screen a few times before she told me it was already on. Of course, the show was excellent. We were blown away by the strength of the voices, the elaboration of the stage sets, and the electricity of Elna Garana (Latvian primadonna singing a Spanish story in French) as Carmen. Even the shiny pate of the old man in front of me and the filthy rich, obnoxious European family next to us served only to fatten the decadent experience. I rather expected to see Marlon Brando up in a box to the side. And the drive home through empty avenues was the only acceptable comedown to such a dream.",9,6,12

180,Stefanie B.,"Manhattan, NY",219,92,6,5.0,1/9/2011,"One of the most beautiful places in NYC, especially at night. The front is almost entirely glass, making it easy to see the crystal chandeliers and red velvet staircases from outside, standing next to the fountain, which is lit from underneath. The low, sweeping stairs leading up to the plaza read ""welcome"" in several different languages- just as each seat has its own subtitle bar, which can be put into English, German, Spanish, etc. The great thing about the subtitle bars is that only yours is visible to you- they're situated (and probably coated) so that you're never distracted by flashing subtitles from the person sitting next to you.If you arrive early, you can enjoy wine or a cocktail on the bottom floor and stroll through a gallery of the history of operas performed at the Met. Just be sure you make it to your seat on time! If it starts before you get in, you won't be allowed to your seat until the end of the act... something I VERY much appreciate because, let's face it people, these seats are expensive, opera is intoxicating and I do not want to be distracted by you climbing in and out of your seat because you didn't plan accordingly. I don't care how much you spent on tickets- the people in your section paid the same amount, and they managed to get here.Even though there's no dress code, I could not agree more with David K. and Warren A. (hah, rhyming!)- PLEASE don't go casual for a nighttime performance! This is a very special experience for some people, myself included (I only go once a year, for my birthday), who like to get dressed up. It completely ruins it when I'm in heels and a nice dress, my boyfriend a suit, and you are in jeans. So you know what, I WILL worry about what you're wearing, because the way you are dressed makes me feel like I'm the inappropriate one, thus affecting my experience. This is why nice restaurants have dress codes. It's called ""atmosphere.""C'mon. It's a Friday or Saturday night, there's crystal chandeliers, red velvet seats, the orchestra are wearing tuxedos and I paid $250 for this seat. Would it kill you to put on slacks? There are women in floor-length fur coats and diamonds, for God's sake!

183,Ash C.,"New York, NY",16,123,16,5.0,3/25/2011,"You can get student tickets by registering on their website and emailing them a copy of your passport and student ID - very easy! Except you have to follow up and make sure they got it. I had to email them about it and someone personally followed through.Weekday tickets are $25, and weekend tickets are $35 - and you can print out the tickets! Although certain times aren't available. They seem to release new tickets every Thursday afternoon-ish. And only certain seats are avaiable - I've only ever seen Orchestra Prime/Prime Balance/Side  available (and the closest to the stage I've ever gotten is Row T), although they say rarely you can get balcony or other seats.You have to be careful which show to watch - they put much more effort into certain operas. I just started watching this season (Jan-Mar 2011) so this only applies to shows in this season: For example, in Iphigenie en Tauride (boring, static, umimpressive), the stage was largely unchanged, acting was unspectacular, and it was just terribly dull and dispiriting.(Romeo et Juliette was also really quite terrible, but for another reason - the acting was cheesy, the entire thing was way too colorful and silly and the singing was totally blah. And Simone Boccanegra felt complicated even though it really wasn't.)BUT for shows like La Boheme, Lucia Di Lammermoor, Queen of Spades (really great, except it felt very long - there were tons of scenes that felt pretty unnecessary), but ESPECIALLY Lucia, with Natalie Dessay!!, the stage set up was breathtaking (audience actually applauded), the acting and singing were oh my god so moving and passionate, and the entire experience was mind-blowing and entirely riveting.Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out which are good and which are bad before going. Even with a fair amount of sifting through news and blogs, reviews are really lacking in this way.But my suggestion is if you're unfortunate to catch a bad one, don't lose hope. At $25 a show, you can afford to watch as many as you can.",4,,

185,Bobby C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",99,276,115,4.0,2/5/2011,"La Traviata: Just a warning, if you're an opera aficionado, you might wanna skip this one. I heard so many angry complaints when I was walking out from old and middle aged people that seemed to know what they were talking about. One complaint was, how they paid good money to see an opera and instead, get this crap. Another was about how poor the stage design was, like they didn't put much work into it. Another was about how actors that weren't supposed to be on stage during a certain scene just stood to the side instead of leaving. It's true in situations like this that ignorance is bliss. I know nothing of the opera. I would've called the stage design minimalist. And the people standing to the side artistic. The lead girl was also pretty cute. She was loud. In fact, everyone on stage was loud. And SOOOOOO dramatic. OKAY OKAY the girl you love is dying, deal with it. I don't care. I'm hungry. I didn't like the fact that many of the subtitle screens were broken. I mean seriously, you can't charge $250 a ticket and then have broken screens. But the good stuff is the Opera house itself. Of course, the met being the met, it's beautiful inside. The orchestra is also good and the sounds reverberate throughout the auditorium extremely well.

Updated review","And once again The Met Opera never disappoints even from the very top row of the family circle... @_^A few minutes before the Orchestra took their seats the small chandeliers surrounding the big one in the middle of the hall slowly rose above the audience while the lights began to dim. I don't think you could get more graceful than that. I was certainly a treat for me to go to a performance of Aida. The sets and set changes were amazing once again, I really have to take the behind the stage tour now, cause I must know how they do it. Aida was performed by Hui He, a Chinese Soprano debuting at the Met from Xian and thought I'd never see an Asian lead playing anything but Miss Saigon and Madame Butterfly. I was so happy and proud. My childhood dream was only to be Christine in the Phantom of the Opera and as time passed I realized there really was no chance for me until now that I really understand there's nothing to do with that, but only everything to do with talent. Oh how naive was I. @_@",6,2,4
199,David K.,"New York, NY",0,22,3,5.0,12/2/2010,"I love the Met. For music lovers, it's a must-see. For tourists, an opera here should be near the top of your list. People think that the opera is filled with stuffy old people. Granted- there is some truth to that. But once you arrive and look around, you notice there's a lot of diversity in age groups. More than what I would have thought. People that think you need to dress up for the opera. Yes, there is definitely that - just go on a Saturday night. You'll see a good number of tuxedos and gowns. But there is no dress code - wear what you deem to be comfortable. But would it kill you to get dressed up every once in a while? People think that the opera is way too expensive. Yes, there are expensive seats just like there are at Yankee games and concerts at MSG. But there are the Family Circle seats and Standing Room, which are definitely affordable on most anyone's budget. If you can afford to see a concert at MSG, then you can afford a ticket at the Met. The combination of music, production and singing are unparalleled. It's a NYC and music treasure where the best of the best sing. I'd bet - any of today's pop or lounge singers - if they knew any better - would give their ""left nut"" to sing as well as anyone who sings at the Met.  And for anyone who has no idea what to see, someone mentioned Barber of Seville: I agree. (Bugs Bunny helps a lot.) Otherwise, get a primer by watching operas during the summer in Lincoln Center Plaza - grab a chair and watch on the video screen for free.",1,2,1
