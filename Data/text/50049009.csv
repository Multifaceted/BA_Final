0,Molly S.,"New York, NY",0,17,15,5.0,6/7/2018,I rarely give any 5 stars. I went in here today just to check out sale items for my friend in overseas and very pleased with the standard because it is everything what ideal boutique should be.First I was greeted with a genuine smile by a great sales staff (didn't ask for his name but he was wearing glasses) and told me where sale items are as of he knew why I was there for.^^Not over abundant salesmanship but just the right amount of approach and attention and KNOWS what he is selling. You'll be surprised how MOST of boutiques' staffs don't know what they're selling. I thought the staffs were happy to work there and had a pride about Coach's quality. Excellent product quality that's better in real life than photos in website or SNS pictures.  Store display is easy to distinguishable  and aesthetically excellent.,,,
1,Rachel Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",376,108,27,5.0,4/11/2017,I literally could not walk in my other brand NEW Coach limited edition shoes (that were SO PRETTY)...but as I limped into the store...the manager helped me find another pair of shoes which were very cute and very comfortable! They were able to do an exchange!!!This is the true  measure of excellence that Coach has always stood for! I really appreciate being able to count on Coach shoes to be stylish and comfortable! The fact that they stand behind the shoes is EPIC!My night out is saved!Thank you Coach!,,,1
2,Neng P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,5,0,5.0,9/18/2017,"I had the best experience at this Coach Flagship store today, starteing from JP who assisted me with wallet and belt purchases for my husband.  He even encouraged me to get my free monogram;  then there's Vince and Corey who were all smiles and genuine in their salesmanship and customer service.  Top it off with Mauricio who monogrammed my small purse! Under my breath I was wishing for coffee and he was so willing to leave his post to make me a cup of cappucino!!!  This store has all the high-end Coach merchandises, great leather goods specially in their Men's department.  Thank you for a pleasant shopping experience!",,,
3,Chloe J.,"New York, NY",0,44,23,5.0,11/11/2017,Thanks Coach for sorting me out with the best bridesmaids/Groomsmen gifts. The team monogrammed and gift wrapped them perfectly. The team were so lovely and really helpful! Thank you so much :-),,,
4,BW W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,4,5.0,12/15/2017,"I would like to first state that there are many worst things in life and Manhattan holiday retail shopping in public is easily one of them, with that being said as soon as I walked in the door on a weekday evening I was greeted with a genuine [ not fake ] smile followed by a warm quick introductory to their seasonal sales and huge inventory to choose from. They offered me water and comfortable leather chair to sit in while I waited for my purchased product, a bow tie and gift box specially wrapped, even how the bag cleaning supplies were wrapped and presented certainly had a wow factor Literally a block walking distance from union sq train station",,,
5,Sherri B.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/27/2017,Very friendly sales staff. Did everything possibleto ensure I got exactly what I wanted. And washappy with my purchase. Love this store,,,
6,Victoria S.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,241,773,4.0,4/7/2015,"It seems like the masses have abandoned Coach for Michael Kors but one cannot sacrifice product quality and customer service with fashionable pieces alone. Coach is trying to maintain its prowess in the leather goods departments and some seasons they score with their shoe or bag collection. This year, I'm coveting their Laurel bootie and turnlock clutch. I've been a collector of Coach since the 90s and I hope their internal design team kicks  into overdrive  this season and next as MK is killing the retail market with their eye popping pieces. However, NO ONE can still compete with Coach's customer service and product repair services.",1,,
7,Nicoletta D.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",18,7,9,5.0,1/10/2016,"I have truly discovered Coach about 2 years ago, and since then I have spent quite a bit of money on shoes and bags. I have only gone to the store on Columbus Circle and the one on 5th Ave. I love their simple and elegant style, I always found friendly  and helpful employees.I just bough a pair of boots and had them mailed to my home because I did not want to carry them. Honesty I find the service great, and i love the products, all of them. They are classy and of great quality. Just a note for one of the employee at the Time Warner store, I forgot his name, but thank you very much. He figured the perfect size of Coach shoes for me just by taking a look at me. So my coral heel fit like a glove, and I feel like princess when I wear them.",,,
8,Melissa I.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,11,5,1.0,12/22/2015,"WORST service EVER! I went in yesterday and had an item on hold (leaving my name, number, etc). I was told that the item would be on hold for 24 hours. I go back today and the item isn't there. Nobody knew where it was and I was waiting for over 15 minutes until the salesperson told me that it had been sold. How do you sell an item that's on hold???! Isn't the whole point of holding an item is so that it wouldn't be sold to another right away? The only thing he offered was for me to go to another store. What kind of sorry excuse for service is that? That's a big waste of my time to run to another store. The manager didn't seem apologetic at all! Nothing was offered except to hold the bag at another store or to have it shipped to me. For all that trouble and frustration, a discount would have greatly been appreciated. You can bet that I'll never be back there again!",1,1,1
9,Jeri E.,"New York, NY",15,42,4,2.0,10/25/2015,"Very pushy staff and not nice. I went in with a bag that needed to be repaired and after arguing over a service fee for 20 minutes, the manager finally intervened. After 3 weeks of waiting, they let me know my bag can't be fixed and they they can give me a discount on a new one. I told them Im not wasting my money on another piece of crap thats gonna break. If you are looking for nice bags in this price point, go with a brand like MARC by Marc Jacobs, Rebecca Minkoff, or Michael Kors. The products are better quality and they will always repair a bag that breaks. Coach has designer prices but the service and quality of a $30 bag from DSW.",1,3,1
10,Leslie S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,16,0,1.0,1/15/2017,"Coach's return policies are at an all time low. My husband purchased a pair of shoes for me as a Christmas gift. They didn't fit and had to be returned. I went to the store with both the gift and original receipt. In order for the card the shoes were purchased with to be credited, they told me I needed to have the card along with my husbands i.d. So I made a second trip and returned with the card the shoes were purchased with, and my husbands i.d This time they told me my husband would have to be there in person to make the return! Since when does a gift return require the gift purchaser to be there in person? Isn't this the purpose of a gift receipt- to allow the giftee to make the return? Coach thinks not. Though I made two trips to the store and spoke to the same salesperson, their only conciliatory response was ""Would I like to call customer service?"". No and no- this return scenario is Retail 101, and shouldn't require a phone intervention from a Coach higher power. A Christmas gift return is a situation that should be easily handled by a store salesperson when the customer has two receipts, the original credit card and the purchasers i.d. in hand. Goodbye Coach and fare thee well- enjoy the consumer animosity you've created through your inability to perform a simple return.",2,1,1
11,Erika R.,"Germantown, NY",186,33,29,5.0,9/26/2015,Friendly and always helpful staff! Shout out to Catrina who was  a huge help and so patient! Thanks for finding my favorite winter coat for me! Can't wait to wear it!,,,
12,Kiki L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,0,4.0,12/7/2016,"This was my first time visiting a Coach store in NYC recently after THE most wonderful experience at the Beverly Hills location in L.A. This one was located on the corner of 17th and 5th. Upon entering, I instantly saw how spacious the layout was and how well organized the merchandise were. It made for a pleasant shopping experience being able to browse items on display instead of pushing and prodding racks apart to dig up clothing. H&M, I'm looking at you. One of the employees, Danielle, zoned in on me at the entrance and became my lovely helper throughout the entire time I was there. With the holidays occurring now, it was a great opportunity to take advantage of their up to 50% off sale. I had spotted many items online that I desired and was hoping this store would carry it. Unfortunately, most of the items I had in mine didn't come in my size. Womp womp. Although I did end up purchasing a penguin hockey sweater in grey with the most softest fabric I've ever encountered. For a regular price of $395 marked down to $229, I though it was a great deal! Danielle was proactive and friendly with getting items for me to try on and making suggestions on accessories/apparel that may work for outfits, but she was never pushy - which I appreciated. With Coach's new creative direction and younger approach, I can see myself doing more business with the brand. I loved pretty much everything about its current collection. Can't wait to see more of what's in store! (no pun intended)",,,
13,Tara D.,"Boston, MA",7,104,11,3.0,3/17/2015,"Really great selection at this store and the staff is friendly but... I have been in there on several different occasions - sometimes alone, sometimes with friends - and each time I've gone the staff seem to follow you around the store while you browse.  Everything I picked up was met with ""oh that's SUCH a great ____"" and it felt a bit contrived and pushy.  I appreciate that they're attentive - which is more than other stores can say - but I think if a customer says, for the 2nd time, ""I'm just looking"" it's best to leave them be for a few minutes.",,,
14,melissa b.,"New York, NY",4,49,17,3.0,12/15/2014,"I see that Coach is trying to up their game.  They totally have a new look and feel.  The store was recently renovated and some of the product is a bit trendier.  You can see there are bags that are inspired by LV and Prada.  Cute things, maybe a little pricey for what it is, but good try.Here's the problem.... I walked into the store and the sales person looked at me and said- Hey, what are you up to???I thought that was a bit bizzaro, and did not feel very upmarket to me.  I left.",,1,
15,Lizzie K.,"Manhattan, NY",13,7,0,5.0,3/13/2013,"I'd like to give Jerrette B, an associate at the Coach store at 79 Fifth Avenue, huge praise and recognition. He helped me pick out a beautiful new bag and offered great input, including style advice. He was friendly and accommodated my every request. Jerrette also sent me a handwritten note, thanking me for my business and offering to be of service in the future. This is what I call excellent customer service.I've been a regular client of Coach for many years, and this is yet another reason to continue being one.",,,
16,Bebe M.,"Westchester County, NY",43,49,0,5.0,2/5/2012,"The staff is AMAZING here! They are so friendly and social. They are not pushy and take the time out to help you. As I was leaving one of them even said "" Come back soon. Even if it's just to say hi. ""Who doesn't love to be treated like that?",2,1,2
17,Lauren S.,"Stockton, CA",496,702,13,4.0,10/21/2009,"The people who worked here were SO friendly.I went in to find something for the baby sister, and myself :)They definitely helped me pick out some REALLY cute stuff, and so I felt I needed to mention how wonderful the service was.Really friendly, all 3 people who helped me out! Yay!",1,1,2
18,Michael J.,"New York, NY",5,390,12,2.0,4/9/2009,"The store is bigger than the one in TWB, the staff on the second floor is nice and willing to help with out. crawling your ***. Did not find what i was looking for but whatever, not a bad experience right - HA NO.Wend down stairs to brows - kill sometime - One of the staff was so sassy I'm sorry are you tyra banks? -  O thats right you are NOT. She was like do you need help, in five min do you need  help the third time i just left - Can i browse in peace.Would have give it 3 star but Tyra Banks made me kick you down a notch.",1,1,1
19,Mary J.,"Elmhurst, NY",20,87,21,4.0,5/14/2008,"Not a Coach fan but I have to love their service!Went to another one in Columbus circle before, bad experience with bitchy cashier so we decide to give another store a try for my mom's gift.In the whole time we shopping, the clerks there are not try to check you every second like other store to make you feel uncomfortable, and the manager there (look like Spanish or little bit Chinese??) is the reason I make this review, really nice service, although he had red eye and one broken teeth, kinda gangster looking (I am not kidding!) but the good attitude and handle every customer very well would definitely make me go back again! Go check him out if you don't believe me!",1,2,1
20,Daniel s.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,16,0,5.0,12/15/2011,"Best customer service ever. Bought a coach wallet on ebay, was unsure of authenticity. Went to Coach store, Katrina was extremely helpful (and cute). Authenticated the wallet for me, and even gave me a free box with tissue papers and coach shopping bag. Will be going back soon!",,,
21,Christina F.,"New York, NY",99,706,2,5.0,2/20/2010,"Not a huge fan of the brand in general, but do really appreciate their small leather goods that last forever. Really friendly service... went to get an item I've had for 6 years. They couldn't do it (or perhaps it would have cost more to repair it than to replace it) so I received a new one instead. The sentimental value of it was gone, but I appreciated the gesture and at least now the zipper doesn't jam!",1,,
22,Elizabeth B.,"New York, NY",6,27,0,5.0,4/28/2010,"Hands down, the best customer service at Coach ever. The staff was so helpful, friendly, and accomodating. I would absolutely recommend this store over any other in NYC.",,,
