0,Go B.,"Westwood, CA",62,258,9696,4.0,10/27/2018,"I love Shake Shack burgers. For fast food burgers in NYC, they are the best.Usually eat a quick dinner here couple of times a week before heading home.The lines at the Battery Park location is not long at all, during busy hours, like the other locations.But, the burgers are on the small side. Tried their non-burger items, and usually left disappointed, so stick with the burgers.As for service, it's pretty good, considering this is a fast food restaurant.Recommend: 8 calendars-- One of only two fast food restaurants to get an A grade for not using beef from cows injected with antibiotics. Most received an F. So, kudos to Shake Shack.",4,2,6
1,Alina V.,"New York, NY",237,246,591,4.0,9/30/2018,"Tried shake shack for the first time with some coworkers for lunch the other day and really enjoyed it! I got the chicken sandwich with the crinkle cut fries. The chicken was so crispy on the outside, yet juicy and delicious on the inside! A little too much mayo for my taste but overall a great sandwich. The fries were also perfect and I got the blood orange ginger lemonade and it was delicious! The line gets long at lunch so be ready to wait, or come a little earlier or after the lunch rush.",,,1
2,Ashley P.,"Indianapolis, IN",297,374,665,5.0,9/27/2018,"I don't think I will ever leave any Shack a review below four stars. Yes I am a shack-head. A shaker. A whatever they call a fanatic of shake shack. I went two times in four days when I was visiting New York because Indianapolis STILL DOESN'T HAVE ONE. I am trying to figure out what I need to do to make this happen so any and all suggestions are welcomed. Moving on - I had just stopped to get some Oysters for lunch on the hudson. It was a great day to have a little snack on a boat. And by snack - that's what it was. I left STARVING. I had been walking around New York City for about two hours at this point and decided it was time to treat myself to a shack burger. We get to this location - which is cute, and clean. There was a short line and a friendly face behind the register. I order my shack & fries and a shake for the bf. The friendly guy behind the register never stopped smiling. It was a welcomed sight to the sometime grumpy faces you see strolling about on NYC side walks. I have nothing new to say about this location - just wanted to continue to   share my love and admiration for Shake Shack.",1,,3
3,Sheri G.,"State College, PA",9,86,101,5.0,10/7/2018,"While I could totally drop the rating for as crowded as this place is and how long the line is... Clearly that's going to be a problem when you're the best burger. My husband and I agree that five guys is a different kind of very best burger in the world. Shake shack burger is something you seriously must try. It's like they cook it in oil there is so much good crunchy outer edge on the burger. The meat is perfectly seasoned. My husband and I really felt this was the best burger we had ever had. Then On the way home we started discussing how five guys is so great because it just taste like a really great meat. At Shake shack it's also about the way they cook it. If you're lucky and get there when the line isn't too long, grab a burger. Don't pass through New York without getting a shake shack burger.",,,

Updated review","""For what ever reasons Ray, call it fate, call it luck, call it karma, I believe everything happens for a reason"". Tonight I went on a two hour walk through lower Manhattan in search of the Ghostbusters headquarters.  At the end of said two hour stroll I started browsing Yelp and found a 4 Star burger joint named ""Shake Shack"".  I'd generally expect a chain burger joint to be no more than 3 stars.  I thought to myself ""the people rating this place must be nuts"".  Being famished and intrigued by said 4 star review I set my expectations low and decide to head to the shack.This place was in a swanky part of the financial district. As such, I assumed I'd be over paying for a ""Steak n' Shake"" style dinner.  With expectations properly set I strolled in, glanced and the menu, and proceeded to the register where I was greeted by someone who actually seemed like they were happy to take my order.  Being a little taken back I held firm to my pessimism and ordered the ""Smoke Shack"".  I asked if fries were included and was informed that there are not.  Having not tried the food yet I felt as though my intuition was correct.... who charges extra for fires?  Considering ""Shake"" is in the name, and assuming that it didn't stand for shakedown, I proceeded to order a medium strawberry shake only to be informed that there was one size, smallish.  Expectations seemed to be met.  I was tired so I ordered the food to go and took it back to my room.On the way back I began sipping on that shake and it tasted wonderful.  So wonderful that it didn't make it back to the hotel.  Considering how hungry I was, the shake experience didn't increase my expectations.  I assumed that my love of said shake was due to hunger.  Now, being a little filled, I'd be able to properly judge the food.The fries and sandwich were placed in a nice cardboard serving tray that fits perfectly into the togo bag.  I thought ""that's cute, how much extra did I pay for that?"".The burger was by no means huge but it was big enough.  I looked under the bun and to my surprise there was a really good smelling and looking pickled pepper / mayo spread.  This discovery piqued my interest.  I picked up that bad boy and took a bite.... In and instant my icy cold heart, filled with low expectations, was melted.  The burger, bacon, and pepper spread melted in my mouth. I was slapped with the perfect salt/bacon/pickle/spice combination.  Even an hour later my mouth is watering as I reminisce about that flavor.Thinking it couldn't get any better I picked up a crinkle fry, expecting mushy cold fries, and was shocked to find perfectly salted crunchy goodn.  They were so good that o didn't know which to love more.  The burger or the fries.As much as it truly pains me to do it, I have to give the Shake Shake 4 stars.  It's literally a fast food burger joint... but I can't justify going any lower.... that shake was darn good.... bravo Shake Shack.... bravo!",,,
6,Petrina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,146,716,3.0,6/28/2018,"I am not a BIG fan of shake shack near my office. The only reason is the line is ridiculously LOOOONNNGGG. It makes no sense that they only had two cashiers and a line outside the door. It's quite frustrating. I was a little disappointed in the Shrom burger (veggie). It's usually very good, but this time it was not hot and was missing its usual flavor. They can't mess up the fries, but I really wish they would change their fries basket. This one is too small for the dollar. If it weren't for the line to the cashier and the slow service they would definitely get 4 or 5 stars, but this time I was not pleased with the service or food.",,,

8,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,5.0,4/29/2018,"As someone who has worked nearby for almost 6 years, you would think that I would have reviewed Shake Shack already but I guess I was waiting for a mind-blowing experience, so here it goes:Ordered for the first time in FOREVER using the Shake Shack app (thanks, Mel!) and got to choose my pick-up time. I was torn between the burger and fries (the basic, always on-point go-to) or trying the fried chicken sandwich. My friend assured me that I needed to try it and since I was long overdue, I went ahead and did just that. My order - the fried chicken sandwich with all the topics except for cheese and a generous side of fries because, treat yo'self. Not sure how to put this into words - maybe ground-breaking? Life-changing? Love at first bite? Not sure what even really happened to me but I do know that this sandwich was the bomb dot com, and it was pretty huge too. Did I need the fries? No. I was full with the sandwich alone, but what kind of person skips on fries? NOT ME. This feast of a lunch was just over $10 too which is awesome for NYC prices.Service was right on time and friendly. No complaints here.Will I delete this app ever? Absolutely not.Will I order this again next week even though summer is right around the corner and I should probably get my body right? Yes, yes I will.",1,1,1
9,Anthony R.,"Monroe, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/10/2018,"This Shake Shack is probably one or if not the best one I've been to. For the amount of people that eat there the service is great, very prompt , little wait from the time for your order. The condiment area is always intact, ketchup , mayo, etc..... Bathroom is very clean and the staff is amazing from the minute you enter til the minute you get your food. Thank you Kadisha from what I see your staff appreciates you and it's always great to see them smiling. It develops a great culture in the work environment.",,,
10,Derek Y.,"New York, NY",102,309,643,5.0,1/28/2018,"There isn't much to say in a review of Shake Shack because there generally very good and the service and food quality are generally stable across all franchises. That said, Im really glad this location has such great reviews because they're totally deserved. I came here with a buddy on a Friday evening and the place was completely slammed, yet the cashiers were both super friendly and helpful. The restaurant was also clean despite having what felt like 1,000 people inside.I ordered the original chicken shack sandwich ($6.89) and a side of fries ($2.99). I saw that they now have a grilled chicken sandwich but, come on... you don't go to Shake Shack for healthy. Anyway, the food was perfection as usual. Chicken was juicy and just as unhealthy as you'd hope and the fries are always to die for. Seriously, if you go and someone offers to share fries instead of ordering their own, you reprimand them and tell them to order their own. THERE WILL BE REGRET IF YOU SHARE! They're that good.Will be happy to return in the future! Great location!",2,2,1
11,Vi L.,"Markham, Canada",18,125,147,4.0,6/28/2018,"I love Shake Shack. Please come to Toronto for more than just a day.The line/wait was a bit long but it was SO GOOD. I'm salivating just thinking about that burger! How is it SO CLEAN but SO GOOD. I ordered the Shack burger, one patty because I thought it was over-hyped, but it was delicious! I should have gotten two. My friend got one of the spicy ones. He said it was great --- it looked great, I wish I could have tried it! The fries were really really good and that shake is HEFTY. Wow. I had to share it and we still could not finish it. I've only been to this location but everyone was really friendly here!

A bit greasy but so much flavor. Blows away In-n-out burger which is the only other quick serve burger I will get when traveling. Fries are worth ordering ad well.Moderation! And enjoy every bite,,,

Updated review","For the sake of honesty and transparency, I confess to being offered a free burger after my less than stellar experience from my last visit. Despite what many may think, this incentive did not affect my review of last night's visit, which was based on customer service, quality of food, and overall experience. Since my last purchase was for dinner take-out, I decided to make the repeat trip for dinner take-out, as well, in order to make similar comparisons.Props to anyone who braved winter storm Toby and hauled their butts to work in this mess! I was so grateful that many of the local eateries were open and I had food options. NYC foodservice workers are a hardcore lot!There's nothing like a ferocious winter storm to get you in the mood for food that is comforting and indulgent. Last night felt like a Shake Shack kinda night, so I decided to redeem my free ShackBurger and add a side of crinkle cut fries (sans the chili and cheese that I had last time).  It looked like others had the same cravings because the restaurant was half-filled with sit-in diners, when I walked in. There was a short line, but it moved quickly. The staff at the counter were pleasant and quick. After paying, I was handed one of their beepers and prepared to wait, but it buzzed and lit up the moment I took it. I thought it was a mistake until someone holding a bag of food came up to the counter and yelled out my name. That was the fastest I'd ever gotten my order at a Shake Shack! I was both happy (for getting my food so quickly) and wary (of possibly getting another burger that had just been sitting around) at the same time.When I got back to the office and dug into the food, I fell in love with Shake Shack all over again! My burger was hot and juicy, cooked medium, the way I liked it. The cheese was nicely melted on the buttery beef patty, and the lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles were fresh, and sandwiched between two soft and pillowy buns. The side of fries were hot, crispy, golden, and delicious. This meal hit the spot! See the latest pics I took of the food. You'll want to go out and get your own.",9,4,8
14,Cathie N.,"Burbank, CA",1,156,57,5.0,8/5/2018,Yum yum!This location was way less packed than my beloved 8th Ave location. Yay! Was actually able to sit down in a booth.,1,,
15,Albert L.,"Richmond, CA",376,70,69,4.0,8/9/2018,"Not quite an In-N-Out killer, but it comes close to being as good. I just had a regular ol Shack burger along with a purple cow float. From what I understood, it was supposed to be something with grape soda, but they just handed me a cup with a scoop of ice cream in it, and said I could just fill it up with whichever soda I wanted. I ended up just going with the Fanta and turning it into orange creamsicle I guess. The main reason I came here was because my buddy has never been to a Shake Shack and thought he should try one since we don't have em in Northern California yet. He got the chicken burger, which I suppose automatically beats In-N-Out since they don't even have one. Regardless, solid burgers all around from this place and definitely enjoyed it after a long day trekking around NYC.",,1,

Updated review","I bought a coworker here for his first time. He seemed to like this place. I ordered a shroom burger, which was my first as well. I didn't realize that there was cheese hiding inside of the battered portabello mushroom. The cheese was hot and running, which was tasty but kind of messy. I loved how crunchy the batter was for coating the mushroom. I would definitely order it again. The service was pretty fast here and long was very short.",2,,2
18,Janet Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,178,379,4.0,8/21/2017,"Honestly I can always count on Shake Shack for a good ass burger. I've had their single, their double, the shroom burger and even the shack stack and I swear I was full for the rest of the day after consuming that monster.Their fries are old school crinkle fries, crunchy not soggy, a def plus but still not as good as some other company's fries. Their shakes are amazing. It's so thick it's almost like a custard! This location has a decent amount of seatings and it's pretty clean for a fast food joint.Overall, whenever I'm in the mood for a good burger, I know shake shack won't disappoint.",1,,2
19,Akosua A.,"Newton, MA",381,21,16,5.0,8/26/2018,This Shake Shack has some of the best employees ever! They volunteered at a sponsored event in Rockefeller Park and were so immensely kind. I had the vanilla custard topped with brownies bites and toffee pieces! The custard was extremely rich and the brownies were absolutely amazing. I don't even know what they're doing to make brownies like that but it is a MUST TRY for everyone and anyone!,,,
20,Jannu B.,"Brooklyn, NY",244,75,160,5.0,9/9/2017,"Great location Clean environment Shake shake is honestly all over the city now and continuing to spread which makes it easy for me now that's it's closer to my college. I'm always shocked at this location because the staffs are wonderful, quick line, everytime I'm there I always find empty seats maybe it's because of the time. It's closer to WTC & the piers! You can grab to go or eat in. I always grab and go to the park which is a better option for me and really relaxing. Burgers are juicy and fresh. Love the cheesy fries and it's always a MUST TO BUY! I always ask for my fries to be crunchy so my fries doesn't get soggy.",,,
21,Donald C.,"San Francisco, CA",43,28,4,4.0,6/29/2018,"Came here to see if they hold up to West Coast's In n Out. I ordered a shackburger, cheese fries, and frozen custard. The place was pretty busy while I was there so it took a little bit longer to push out my order. The shackburger looked amazing, a fresh piece of lettuce and cheese melted on a patty, between two buttered hamburger buns. The burger was so good, perfectly cooked and tender. The cheese fries should be eaten quick, or the fries are going to solidify pretty quick, but they're good. The frozen custard was heavenly, insanely smooth and sweet.",1,,

23,Maria T.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,11,0,5.0,8/14/2018,"Went to Fulton Ave. branch in NYC at 9pm for late dinner and queue was at least 30 people deep. To skip the line, you can use their app but I don't have an American credit card so had to wait at least 20 min.  The wait was worth it!  Exceeded expectations as far as taste goes.Orders:Smoke Shack double - best burger I've had.  Patties cooked to perfection, so juicy and tender.  Bacon gave a nice seasoning to the patty and red peppers gave a hint of sweetness and spicy was. Can't wait to compare to In-Out burger once I get the chance.  Could be bigger, but this was quantity over quality so it still gets 5 stars.Bacon cheese fries - really good too.  Generous cheese and bacon toppings.  Fries were crinkle-cut with crispy outside and soft inside.  5stars.Cookies and cream strawberry shake - was good but they ran out of my first choice of chocolate and they also ran out of whipped cream.  Thickness just right and would have preferred it to be less sweet.  3.5 stars.Draft root beer large - pretty good root beer.  Similar to A&W root beer.  4 stars.Will definitely go again next time I'm in New York.",,,

I don't really know why people compare this place to in n out because they are totally different. They have their way of dressing their burgers and in n out has their own and they are equally delicious in my book. I went all out since it was my first time trying out shake shack. I ordered their shack stack burger. If you are unfamiliar with their burgers this is the cheeseburger + their shroom burger (crispy fried portobello mushroom with cheese inside). It was so good I'm seriously drooling rn and I'm crying inside because CA don't have shake shack. I actually wanted to order another one at that time lol. Anyways I also ordered cheese fries on the side (which was fresh and crispy).My bf ordered a regular cheeseburger and he wished he ordered the shack stack lol. He took a bite of my burger and wanted to switched burgers after (I clearly said heck no!) Anyways, I've been to multiple shake shacks after this visit and nothing beats this location. The one in Las Vegas doesn't compare to this that's for sure. Even the shake shack near time square was also good, but this particular location is the best. They do get super busy but I promise they are worth waiting for.Would I recommend this place? HECK ya! Will I go back? Yessss most definitely. FYI do not make the same mistake as my bf lol. Follow what your stomach is telling you, just go all out when you are here especially when it's your first time.",1,2,1

The burgers are simply and delicious. I specifically liked the fact that the burger are not huge. I strongly recommend the mint Oreo cookie shake,,,
48,Liana M.,"New York, NY",393,88,798,4.0,11/15/2016,"Some might think I'm crazy when I say this, but Shake Shack's burgers are literally the best burgers I've ever had in my life.  Maybe I haven't eaten enough burgers in my lifetime, but for fast food, their burgers are AMAZING.  Everything from their potato bread buns to their medium cooked burger is just perfection.  I really feel like the bread that they use makes it what it is.  I just wish the burgers were a little bigger.  They're a tad bit on the small side.  But you know what they say, good things come in small packages.    The fries are good, nothing to really go crazy over, but if I'm ordering a burger, I will NEVER forgo the fries.No matter which location you're at, there is and always will be a line and it will be a STRUGGLE to find a seat, but i'm willing to suffer through all of that for my burger.  My friend and I have gotten into debates over Shake Shack vs. In N' Out and which is better, but I've never had In N' Out so I can't really give my input on that, but as long as I live on the East coast, I will stick with my dedication to Shake Shack!!!",,,2

50,Nadir G.,"Irvine, CA",66,169,189,5.0,7/3/2017,"Simple food. Masterful execution. I had waited three years to try Shake Shack. Last time I was in New York, I made an attempt to visit their Times Square location only to meet a line out of the door. No thank you. I recently visited New York again. The Battery Park location was conveniently located just around the block from my hotel. I ordered the Double Shack with crinkle cut fries. It took fifteen minutes for my food to arrive. The burger was everything I imagined it to be. Hot and fresh off the grill, well seasoned, and oozing with melted cheese. When presented with the option of russet potato fries or sweet potato fries, I  always opt for the latter. Having said that, I didn't expect to enjoy their crinkle cut russet fries. I was surprised to see that they were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and didn't leave me with a  mouth full of bland mashed potato that you get when eating steak fries.However, the sandwich was rather small, in my opinion. I could have easily eaten another Double Shack, but for the price and tight seating arrangement, I decided to complete my meal elsewhere. I would definitely return.",,,
51,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,5.0,3/7/2017,"There's not much more for me to add to this space. This was the FIRST TIME I've ever tried Shake Shack despite having gone to college in the city and living in Manhattan for the past three years. I think I've been slightly resistant because of the long lines, the hype, and the fact that I can't really eat salty foods as much as I could a few years ago without bloating up like a pufferfish. But this was too freaking good. I tried the Shack burger, a bite of the Shack Stack with the portobello mushroom, the crinkle cut french fries, the black and white milkshake, AND the Smokeshack burger. And yes, I do realize how much food that is but I regret not a thing. First, the Shack burger was much smaller than expected and I downed it without realizing that I was done. Second, the Smokeshack burger was the best thing I've eaten in a long, long time. The chopped cherry pepper sauce with the bacon made the burger. Also, I truly love how buttered and griddled the potato buns are. Sad to say I was too stuffed to try the concretes, especially the Downtown Butter Brown. Ugh. Why is everything delicious so bad? I just try to read the menu without looking at the calorie count. I came on a rainy Saturday evening and the wait time wasn't bad at all (though I can see how bad the lines could get on a weekday). From ordering to stuffing my face, it was about 10 minutes and we didn't have to struggle to find a seat. It was a bit frustrating to see how one group in particular held on to a table after finishing eating and remained chattering loudly despite a line of other customers waiting to find seats. People, be more considerate. Go chat elsewhere. The impending sodium crash will be worth it. I hope. PS: The peanut butter and bacon burger on SS's secret menu looks to be the best thing ever.",5,3,4
52,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",195,145,221,5.0,11/13/2017,"Came here for a quick bite after a movie on a frigid night. When we got in, we saw it was packed and thought we'd have to sit outside to eat. After we ordered, most of the place cleared out and we actually got a table. So the way you get your order is a bit different from other shake shacks. They give you a buzzer and it usually vibrates when your food is ready. Here, they give you one with your number and call your name out when it's ready. Different but it still works. I got the double burger with bacon. While the burger itself wasn't big, it was thick. Cooked medium rare with great tenderness. The crinkle cut fries are always good. I prefer them over the shoestring fries some other locations have. Definitely want to try their chicken burger next time and a concrete custard shake.",,,

56,Erika R.,"Toronto, Canada",28,165,354,5.0,7/21/2016,"When in Cali, you do In N Out and when in NYC, you do Shake Shack. The last time I had Shake Shack, I had a bite of the 'Shroom Burger and for myself, I had the ShackBurger.  This time around, since I couldn't decide what to have, I opted for their Shack Stack which is a combination of both burgers - the best of both worlds! Was definitely one of the best burgers I've had, ever, which was accompanied by their crinkle cut fries which were perfectly crisp. The patty was nicely salted and very juicy.  The mushroom was nicely battered and was accompanied by some ooey gooey cheese.  Was also fried perfectly as it wasn't overly greasy.  The size of it was also very fulfilling and mind you, I was out walking around the city for hours by this time.  Because I'm an out-of-towner, their free wifi was a plus.  Not only because I was able to sit to rest while my colleagues ordered my food for me, but also because I was able to catch some Pokémons while waiting.  Only downfall was that that bastard Bulbasaur broke out of, not 1 but 2 Poké balls.  But on a happier note, my belly was happy.  Very happy. 5/5 for the foodie experience, 4/5 for the Poké experience. Kidding. Make that 5/5 since there was a Poké stop nearby.",1,,1

That fried mushroom, with all the cheese that oozes out is sublime. I also really like the cheese fries, but they are too salty for me - will have to get them without salt next times.The prices are a little steep, $7 for that 'Shroom burger!

The place doesn't feel old, dirty or historic, which can be a fun change after the smell of hot urine in the subway tunnels, or the dodging of fast small brown rats near the water of lower east side. I ordered the burger without cheese for $5.It was fresh, not greasy with that thin style burger I associate with Texas lake food. For the price it feels a good value and healthier than Burger King.  The service was even suburban friendly. This Danny Meyer homage to fast food burgers is cute and I might like it better then in an out even.  In the end Id rather pay triple the price for a thick beef patty with quality beef, but this place tickles a childhood happiness.",8,2,6

The special shake shack sauce in the burger is amazing as well and their lettuce, tomatoes and any other toppings you choose are extremely fresh and healthy.Their shakes are always changing but you really can't go wrong with any of their flavors - they are always very thick and flavorful with full cream used.

Crispy chicken cutlet with pickle, lettuce, and herb mayo. Good combination. The batter they use on the chicken is tasty. The cheese fries are a cheesy indulgence. Good as always. I'm so glad they are using crinkle cut fries. One time when I came, maybe a few years ago, they were using the regular skinny fries. It just wasn't the same.The strawberry mint lemonade was SUPER sour on first sip, but once I got past that, I did taste the strawberry and mint.

66,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,1/28/2016,"Before Hudson Eats rolled around, this Shake Shack was abhorrently crowded, likely because it was one of the few decent lunch options around. Now that there's a bit of lunch competition, the crowds have died down, and you can get some Shake Shack at a much quicker pace. Your best bet to avoid lines during lunch is to go around 11:30am, and after 1:30pm. I usually only reserved trips to Shake Shack for Fridays, as a burger and fries for lunch would more or less put me out of commission, which I could likely only get away with on a Friday afternoon. Behold though, the Chick'n Shack, the newest item to go nationwide (except for airport and stadium locations). Super crispy all-natural and antibiotic-free fried white meat chicken, with lettuce, pickles, mayo on a soft bun. It really doesn't get better than this in the realm of ""fast food"" chicken sandwiches. It was previously only available in Brooklyn, which is why I hadn't tried it until recently, but now that it's readily available, my lunch game is now changed forever. It's still not a very healthy option at about 600 calories a sandwich, but I personally didn't feel quite as slow after eating one of these, whereas, again, after eating a Shack Burger, I'm pretty much down for the count.People seem to have a love or hate relationship with the fries at Shake Shack, but I'm actually right in the middle. I prefer the skinnier McDonald's type fries, but I do rather enjoy the crispiness of the crinkle-cut fries at Shake Shack. They're a bit more generous at this location with the fries too, compared to the Madison Square location.The service can vary in speed depending on the crowds, but the staff is usually all very friendly. Sometimes you get stuck behind the huge catering or large orders, or you run into the schoolkid crowd, so beware of what time you go to pick up your meal. Pricing, as usual, isn't too bad, as you can get a burger/sandwich and fries for about 11 bucks, which is comparable to just about all the good lunch options in the area. Obviously not McDonald's prices, but you knew that coming in anyways. With the introduction of the chicken sandwich, I'm definitely more inclined to come here for lunch when I'm feeling like I don't have to be healthy. However, again, I would reserve that mostly for Fridays or generally lazy days at work.",46,29,42

70,Kristen M.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,188,103,5.0,12/20/2016,"Shake shack burgers are already famous for being one of the East Coast's answer to In-N-Out but this location has become one of my favorites for two reasons. One: I've been shocked by how fast I was served each time I went. I know Shake Shack is considered ""fast casual"", or whatever nouveau name we're giving things these days to feel better about eating grease and carbs without working out, but this location serves me really quickly, which is awesome when I'm trying to make a movie at the Regal next door. Or when I'm smuggling burgers into the Regal. Pro tip, bring a nondescript bag that disguises your food when going to your movie and you can enjoy the latest Star Wars movie while reclining with a burger in your hands. It's my idea of church. Reason two I love this location: Corrine! Super sweet hostess/cashier that took our order and when she heard we were celebrating a birthday she gave us a scoop of ice cream and cheered. Not too loudly to embarrass either. Just right! So sweet! Shout out to Corrine and her great customer service. She's made this location my new favorite.

When you bite into it that muenster cheese oozes out just. So. Beautifully. The fries have a good amount of crisp on them. I am a shoestring lover so there was a little too much cooked inside compared to the outer crunch but they taste great!! The lower west side concrete is perfect for a chocolate lover. Even better for a s'mores fanatic. The chocolate custard and marshmallow creme makes a smooth smooth consistency. And the coco nibs add a nice crunch factor.

Very rich in flavor and the donut pieces tasted like it had cinnamon components in it. I also tried the Christmas Cookie shake. Delicious, tasted like sugar cookies with frosting.

77,Inga C.,"New York, NY",277,135,412,4.0,12/28/2015,"5 stars for the Shake Stack burger. You just can't beat a fried, gooey-cheese-filled mushroom patty on top of a cheesy hamburger patty. Burgers aren't even my favorite type of food by far, but this was very very good. For those who have had In -n-out, they're honestly two very different tasting burgers so it's a bit like comparing apples to oranges. However, side by side, In-n-out has better buns and the killer onions & animal style sauce; Shake Stack has better tasting meat & the killer mushroom patty oozing with cheese. The rest of the items at Shake Shack aren't the best in my opinion (thus the 4 stars overall). The fries are ok, and I tried one of their concretes with lemon marinated raspberries which sounds good but was too sweet and too lemon-y. Expect a ~25min line at this location even in off-peak hours like 3pm on a Monday. Seats are hard to get too, so if you want to eat there, go with a buddy and have them scout for a table while you're in line.

I've been eating at SS for a few years and I feel like their burgers are getting smaller and smaller over time, delicious but eh. Next, the chicken sandwich is actually amazing. Crispy, salty and the killer was the juicy pickles!! The fries were a let down to be honest. They are the fries you buy in the frozen section in the supermarket, the price you pay for the one size is worth a whole bag, I'll def pass next time. And lastly, the milkshake we ordered was not my cup of tea personally, it was sweet, salty and so much cinnamon, so we kindly asked if we could get a soda instead cause we felt bad asking for a milkshake but the counter waitress was nice enough to make us a new one!

Just wish they had more seating otherwise I'd give five stars for a five star experience. Street parking can be a challenge, but we got lucky.",2,2,3

I have to mentally prepare my body for the calorie intake, but it's oh so worth it! My mouth is watering as I type this review out and it's about dinner time. Maybe I'll see you there! ;)",,,
89,Emily M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,9,1,3.0,7/27/2018,food is good but overrated. milkshakes are basically melted ice cream and are super thick- not the best in my opinion. waited 15 mins for a burger which is no better than In-n-out for all california people.,,,
90,Justin O.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,1.0,6/13/2017,New manager as of a few months ago. Things were good until he left. No more C line. So if you just want a drink or custard you have to wait 20 mins on line. Then wait 20 mins for everyone else's food to finish before they will take 5 seconds to pour your drink or custard. Service is generally slower after new manager.,,,1

Me and a couple of friends from work went there to grab some burgers and we get the bag and get back to work only to find out that the shroom burger I had ordered is not in the bag. I understand it's not always easy to get all the orders right and mistakes happen. So I walk back with the receipt in hand and politely ask the guy at the counter that I did not get my burger and he flat out refuses to listen to me unless I get the entire order back. I tell him that it's a group order and one cannot get it back and he behaves rudely without an iota of professionalism. I don't think I'm ever going back there ever again.

The shroom burger was fine, but I feel like every time I step into Shake Shack and order their shroom burger (vegetarian mushroom cheese patty; no meat), the portions are downscaling.",1,,

Also, crinkle fries SO much better than those other lousy excuse for fries - so glad they brought crinkle cut back! I ordered the classic Shack burger, crinkle cut fries and vanilla shake.  That is pretty much my standard order and never does me wrong!  Thoughts on some of their other stuff: Smoke shack burger - hot pepper, bacon, shack sauce.  This is my husbands standard order.  I personally am wierded out eating two meats together (beef and bacon) but he always seems to enjoy it! Shroom burger - basically cheese and mushroom heavily fried aka grease party that burns your mouth.  Not a huge fan.  I like sticking to the classics here :)",1,,

Updated review","This is a great shake shack location but if you come here for lunch be prepared for an acceptable wait time. This burger chain is a fast healthier burger chain with delicious burgers cooked fresh, with the best crinkle fries you can find, with sweet and tasty shakes. I usually get the shack burger with the fries and if I want something sweet I get a shake. I like the strawberry the best but that's my preference. They also offer an array of other options from burgers with toppings, custard, flavor of the month shakes, doggie treats, tap beer.It's nice that they also have free water on the side so you don't have to ask for it and you can pour it yourself.In addition I met the manager here his name is Devin and I was really impressed. He was working with the staff exceptionally well during a very busy hectic lunch crowd and moving quickly around the shop appeasing customers who did not have patience and was the type of manager you would want in a location like this.In short great burgers, fries, and shakes and a must go to if you've never been to a shake shack.",3,,1

I was offered a sample of the flavor and enjoyed it, but didn't think that I wanted it as an accompaniment to my meal. It still sounded awesome as a dessert of its own and I wish it were not only going to be available this week.",1,1,

The variety of sandwiches served here are truly what sets it apart, as well as their famous shack sauce. Pro tip: get the sauce on the side to dip in your fries and put on your burger. Burgers are delicious, well cooked and always served fresh. However the true separator of Shake Shack from other burger joints is the eponymous shakes. I've gotten multiple flavors, and always come back to the coffee one as my favorites. All in all a great place to grab a slightly more upscale and better tasting burger then a fast food place.",,,
104,Robin P.,"Dallas, TX",8,10,0,2.0,4/8/2017,"We are a party of three visiting Shake Shack for the first time. Being from Dallas, we are not familiar with the chain so we wanted to try it out. We visited the shop at about 1:30 PM on a Saturday.This particular location was so crowded, there was a line out the door. The menu board is on the wall, so we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted to order. The order process was not too complicated; however, the guy taking our order seemed distracted. While I was literally speaking to him, placing my order, he stepped away and started talking to a co-worker. Not sure what that was about but it seemed quite rude to me! Once we were about to pay, they informed us their French Fry machine was broken so they were out of fries. OUT OF FRIES!?! A HAMBURGER JOINT!?! I mean, c'mon--have a backup French Fry machine!!!They have fountain drinks, which seems unusual for NYC. They have Dr. Pepper, which is unbelievable. Kudos for that! They also offer free triple-filtered water for anyone who wants it. That is nice. They have two restrooms--not very clean There are very few tables so we had to sit outside--in the cold while we waited for our food. The order seemed like it took forever--probably 20-30 minutes wait time for fast food! Once we finally picked up our food from the counter, we were happy with the flavor of the burgers. Everything was made to order and fresh. The burgers were very small for the price. Three burgers, two soft drinks, and one milk shake cost $33. Yikes! Especially for NO FRIES!The reason why I keep going on about fries is the table ahead of us ordered fries and had no problems receiving them. The group who ordered behind us were able to obtain fries. Not sure what happened to us but we were sadly disappointed.All-in-all, I can only give three stars. Too crowded, order taker rude, NO FRIES, high prices, and dirty restrooms are the reasons. The burgers were great. The shake was excellent.",1,,

Have you tried the Chick'n Shack? It's better than most chicken focused chains. It's breading is thin and crispy, and it's topped with lettuce, pickles and a dollop of special sauce on a delicious shake shack bun. Ummm ummm good! Finish off this spectacular flavored filled sandwich with the Blueberry Pie Shake. It's vanilla ice cream blended with blueberry pie. Soooo good! Can't forget the crinkle fries. Man oh man. This meal was a burst of goodness from the food gods. See a long line at this location? Jump on board. The line moves very quickly and the food is prepared quicker than a flask of light. Seating might be an issue during the lunchtime and dinner rushes but you can always grab your food and sit along the water.

After seeing many social media posts from friends about how amazing Shake Shack is, I've finally been able to make the decision for myself. I know a lot of people compare this to In N Out on the West Coast, but friends...these two aren't even in the same league! Don't get me wrong, I love In N Out, but you just can't compare it. Shake Shack's ingredients are definitely high quality, from the bread, lettuce, and meat. I loved that they melted their cheese and drizzled it on top instead of putting a slice of cheese. Also I loved the cheesy fries, they were crinkle cut (which are my favorite, since they offer the maximum amount of crunchy surface area), and it came in a cup to control how much cheese you wanted on top.I'm definitely coming back.",2,,1

What the heck is in that ShakeSauce?! We got regular ShackBurgers, crinkle cut fries, and a coffee shake. The only complaint I have is that I didn't know there was sauce in my burger til half way in so the first half of the burger I was like ""yeah it's pretty good"" and then the second half of the burger I was like ""omg where was the sauce earlier?! it's soooo good!"" As long as that sauce is spread all over the burger, I'll be super happy. Fries were perfectly cooked for me: lightly crispy on the outside, soft in the inside. The coffee shake was really good: not too thick, not too thin.I can't wait to have Shake Shack again. They need to open one in CA...like seriously.",1,,
114,Pierce H.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,41,32,2.0,6/17/2017,ShakeShack - not sure if you ever heard of pre bussing and clearing tables but please get your act together! When customers are spending +$50 to eat in and they can't get a table because other customers are over staying their welcome (finished eating their food etc) then you got a problem brewing. Your food is good BUT not that good to be worth the hassle and risk of not getting somewhere to sit time and time again. Sort it out.

It's even better than that evil giant in the west coast that we call In-n-Out. Their smokeshack burger, double meat, is delicious. I am a big fan of crinkle cut fries and I like that you can add liquid cheese on top of it. I love their lemonade, it's fresh and tangy, not too sweet. Their fountain drinks and lemonade come with free refills. My girlfriend loves their burgers too but she didn't like their milkshakes at all. She says In-n-Out milkshakes are way better.

I arrived around 5:30PM on a weekday night, and although the flow of customers in and out was pretty steady, there was never a long wait to order. I was able to walk straight up to the counter when I was ready to order, and was subsequently able to quickly secure a spot at one of the booths in the back (although I had been watching it with an eagle eye...waiting to swoop). We each had a SmokeShack (Cheeseburger+bacon+cherry pepper+ShackSauce) and shared an order of the krinkle fries. I hadn't been to Shake Shack in a while and had forgotten how petite their burgers are... I think I could have had another 1/2 to one full burger and still had room for more..

What caught me off guard was what was in between the two fried mushrooms. I thought it was just excess juice that usually accumulates from cooking veggies. It turned out to be cheese. Mind blown!

I'm actually quite shocked at the hype. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, cheese fries, and a chocolate shake. My burger was substandard. The bun was hard, but the meat was good. The fries seriously taste like they dumped them out of a frozen package with some gross sauce (I can't even call it cheese) on it. The shake was nothing spectacular, or even memorable. My husband got cherry peppers on his burger, and they were quite good. However, it was mediocre over all, but I'm willing to give it a second chance. Maybe I went on a bad day.

It took the cashier awhile to take my order for a milkshake because he went to assist another customer at the pickup counter before finishing my transaction. Apparently there was only one person making the milkshakes so mine took awhile. My friend who had ordered right before me somehow managed to get his shake, which was the exact same as my shake, well before me though. When I finally got my shake, it was the wrong flavor. They had to remake it, and it came out really melted and not cold. I had asked for no whipped cream and it had whipped cream, but I was tired of waiting so I let it be. Also (not the biggest deal but at this point...) the manager had told me he'd bring my corrected order out to me but I had to go pick it up myself.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (to which I actually do not know the actual name of), fries and a vanilla shake. Gf got a chicken burger and my friend ordered the cheeseburger. We all enjoyed our burgers and personally, I thought my fries were nothing special, but nothing to complain about. The highlight of the meal was definitely my milk shake that was not too sweet. It was the perfect weather for a milk shake too!I really do like the location for this Shake Shack. It's got a fair amount of indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. On a rainy day, the outdoor seating is covered by an awning overhead, so on those nice warm spring shower days, you can still eat outside at this Shake Shack location.I hear their specialty/limited edition burgers are where it's at and that the menu changes frequently too.

Compared to in n out shake shack is significantly more, but their selection is larger. I had the shroom burger something that is not found on the in n our menu and totally loved it. A friend of mine had the shack stack which is the stuffed, fried tempura mushroom stuffed with cheese in addition to the regular shack burger and another friend had a chicken burger which she thoroughly enjoyed. The line is long but definitely worth the wait and service is quick. The fries and shakes were incredible as well would definitely recommend.",,,

137,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,8/27/2014,"Shake Shack has been my unreachable unicorn for years... I keep hearing about how marvelous it is, but I just could never bear standing in those ridiculously long lines to taste a burger, no matter how tasty. But on a recent Saturday I passed by this location and was pleased to find that the line wasn't winding out the door! There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, and it's in a great area. My new favorite location!As for the burger... it almost lived up to the hype. It's impossible not to compare NYC's most famous burger with In-N-Out, California's beloved version... everyone does it. And maybe this California girl is subconsciously biased, but I had to say that In-N-Out won the competition. That's not to say that this burger isn't good. I loved the way the patty was cooked - nicely crispy on the edges in a way I haven't seen in another fast food burger. The single burger is a nice size on its own for a hearty snack or a light meal. Next time I'll try the Shack Stack since that's what people seem to go most crazy about. A shake seemed too filing, so I went with their special blueberry lemonade. I found it to taste kind of artificial, not like they used real berries. I probably wouldn't go for that again. Finally, the service. The guy at the counter was totally disinterested, unfriendly, and one of those people who refuses to make eye contact. Bad first impression! But then the gentleman who was cleaning the outside tables really impressed me with his attentive service and willingness to make conversation with the patrons. He should probably switch places with the dude at the register!",14,9,10

It's absolutely delicious and has never given me a reason to even consider trying anything else. Layers of mushroom and cheese fried up in a crispy patty and smothered in shack sauce is enough to make anyone leave beef behind.

So I really wanted to give Shake Shack a 5 star rating because the food is just soooooooooooooooooo damn good! I have never regretted anything I put in my mouth there. I'm not a big fan of burgers/red meat but I LOVE me the Shack Burger with bacon! Never felt like anything was undercooked or burnt. Also, the staff at any location is always super nice! Unfortunately, my joy for SS is subdued by the prices. For a burger fries and a shake you will definitely be spending over $13. I wouldn't mind the price if the portions were just a little bigger. And don't get me started on the lines! I really can't condemn them for being so popular, they do deserve it. But just know Shake Shack is not a ""quick bite"" kind of deal.Nevertheless, I do enjoy Shake Shack.",2,,

My, oh, my, is it good. I didn't know I liked corn dogs until now.The batter on the outside is thin and fried to a crispy perfection. When you bite into the hot dog, it's not too salty or too doughy, instead it has almost a crispy crunch and then it gives way to the soft steaming hot dog. It also comes with a mustard, corn, and relish dip, and it is so, so good together.I highly, highly recommend trying it.",3,1,1

Thoughts running through my head include but are not limited to: Does it live up to the hype? Will the fries be as good as they look? How long will the wait be? Will I find a table, and if not, will I have to stand and eat like a crazy person while hovering over someone's table?Answers: Yes, YES, 5-10 minutes max, and by some amazing luck and timing, yes.Obviously since I live on the West Coast, comparisons to In-N-Out will be made. So here they are: fries are INFINITELY better than In-N-Out's. I actually really do not like In-N-Out fries now. #ThanksShakeShack. Shake Shack has higher quality burger ingredients, but I think In-N-Out has a better and more flavorful sauce.Conclusion--yes, it lives up to the hype.

I really avoid going anywhere that isn't Downtown at all costs... so I'm so thankful they opened this up in Battery Park.The line moves at a pretty reasonable pace here- don't get me wrong.. there is like a 95% chance that there will be a line here, but at least you're not waiting on a line that wraps around the building. Also if you walk around enough, you will also be able to scoop up a table. The food here is on par to the other locations- it's delicious and always leaves you wanting for more. I enjoy coming here, I often also like to get a nice glass of wine or a beer or during the summer... a delicious vanilla shake to compliment my meal. My favorite is the standard Shack Burger and a side of Cheesy Fries. Excuse my fat ass but I really do enjoy me a nice burger every once in a while!

The Burger was not overcooked.  The toppings were fresh.  The Cherry Peppers were spicy and added a great flavor to the burger.   The Fries were freshly cooked to Crispy Perfection and then topped with American cheese sauce.  I like it but wasn't super impressed.  No real comparison between the two but being from California I would chose In n Out.",1,,1

I'm thinking that is not such a bad thing.Shake Shack has a couple locations to chose from in NYC; we went to the Wall Street area one. Huge patio and a lot of seating inside, and there was no line upon arrival (though that changed within 2 minutes--always happens after I show up ;)). It was full of Wall Street employees which made for some very nice eye candy!Menu on the wall and then once ordered you get a buzzer. This is great because you will spend good wait time searching for a table.I chose the shroom burger, my friend got the single cheeseburger. I also got the fries and the 50/50 drink. I spent a few mins trying to get ketchup and malt vinegar (loved that it was there) as some intern was definitely picking up lunch for the office (or really loved mustard, ketchup and malt vinegar) My buzzer goes off and I get my anticipated meal! Looks tasty! A fried portobello mushroom with oozing cheese and sauce, tomatoes and lettuce. The wrapper was definitely necessary. Next were the fries--natural, skin on fries. I took a bite of the shroom and was hoping for more--it lacked flavor for sure. The fries were okay, most were limp. And the 50/50, so was watered down.I ate it all since I was hungry but I left unsatisfied. Shake Shack you have deceived me!!!  However the clientele was nice to look at ;)",1,,
152,Carolyn L.,"Vancouver, Canada",125,1169,10568,5.0,7/8/2015,I have heard so much about Shake Shack and just had to try it when I was in NYC for a vacation. We got there around 1015pm after the July 4th fireworks and luckily it was still open. One of the doors was shut after 11pm but they still allow those halfway through their meals to stay on to finish their food. Only the door at the front was open to allow patrons to leave and enter to use the washroom. I had the smokeshack burger with bacon and cherry pepper (a hint of spiciness). The patty was moist and juicy and fresh. The bun was soft but not gummy. Quite a good combination. The fries were fresh and hot and crispy. The milkshake (black and white) was equally divine. It was a great meal to end the night.,4,3,4

Also have yet to try the shroom burger, but from what I've heard it just sounds like just a cheese overload. This one has tvs with shows from full house to sports games playing - a plus.  Also next to a regal's, so you can drop by before or after a movie.

They also have an option to put cheese on your fries. I've never tried it but it does look good. Menu has a variety of items to choose from.-1 star because it's ALWAYS packed and it's impossible to find a place to sit. I blame it on the location (basically next to the WTC).

We got there around 1:30pm and there was no people on line to order --  just a bunch of people waiting to make the mad dash to acquire a table as soon as people got up! We ordered single shackburgers (I wasn't hungry enough to attempt a shroom burger today), a fifty-fifty and a side of fries to split and it came to only $15! I had forgotten how cheap these burgers were! Anyways, we devoured them in about 2 minutes, ha. I'm so bummed they don't have the amazing crispy crinkle cut fries anymore, though. These new ""fresh"" fries were disappointing -- our batch was rather soggy. Anyway, still a solid lunch meal. I haven't had a burger in months and this definitely hit the spot.",2,,1

Maybe it was just me but I didn't like the bus too much. The fires were mediocre. I had better fries before. The vanilla custard ice cream was interesting. It had an ""eggy"" taste. Not sure if that's the correct with to explain it but it was an interesting texture. I'm not sure if I like just plain vanilla ice cream or custard.

We ordered the Shack Burger and the Shroom Burger and found the burgers to be quite fresh, juicy and tasty. They weren't too greasy either, so that was a plus.What was a little bit of a let down though were the crinkle cut fries and their concrete (vanilla custard with brownie, walnuts and cherries). The crinkle cut fries, though were crunchy, were sort of tasteless and almost tasted like generic fries. The concrete was way too sweet that were glad we were sharing a small size of that dessert.Another downside is always the line and the long wait time. Given that we were there around 2pm on a Friday and wait in line was about 10 min and close to additional 20 min of waiting (from order to receiving food), we thought it was too much of a wait.Overall, though..quality burgers!

For two burgers to go at about 6:00PM on a Saturday it took about 25 minutes to get our order. Prices were fair, but the burgers were average. Five Guys is much better, in my view.",1,,
182,Carter H.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",0,9,2,4.0,7/4/2017,"An incredible burger is what pushed a sub-par establishment from a three to four star rating. I was incredibly impressed with the food. The shake and fries were delicious and the burger was outstanding, one of the best I've ever had. On the downside this restaurant lacks adequate seating and has a long wait to get seated and receive your food. Overall an impressive restaurant, I would definitely come again.",,,
183,David C.,"Mountain View, CA",906,1717,3680,5.0,9/4/2013,"Was visiting a friend in NYC and he convinced me to try the ""In-N-Out"" of New York.  Granted he said comparing the two would be like comparing apples and oranges, but at least I have a baseline since I am from Cali.  I won't focus at all on the comparison, and I'll just review Shake Shack for what it is.  Verdict?  I was blown away.  I had an order of Shack Stack and Fries.Shack Stack:  A+-  Perfectly toasted bun-  Tender and thick patty that was not overdone.-  Mushroom patty that really raises the bar; a patty made of sliced mushrooms and melted cheese.-  Your normal burger vegetables-  A very heavy meal in itself; fries optionalFries:  B-  Criss cut-  A tad underseasoned-  A tad overdone and dryNow you have my no bs assessment of Shake Shack.  Definitely a great value for the money, and they have their logistics down pat so you won't be waiting too long in line or for your food.  PROTIP:  I hear their custards are great.",2,1,1

186,Angi D.,"Escondido, CA",28,16,28,5.0,1/10/2016,"I came here and Times Square either. Both are full, so you'd better look for a table and then you can order happily. I love these hamburgers, are DELICIOUS, real meat and fresh ingredients. Prices are good, if you want to be full you can order a double for 9,45 $. I really recommend their Shack special with meat and Portobello mushroom. That's the best!! Yo vine aqui y al Times Square tambien. Ambas estan llenas, Asi que es mejor que busques una mesa y luego puedes ordenar felizmente. Yo amo estas hamburguesas son DELICIOSAS, es carne real y ingredientes frescos. Los precios estan bien, Si quieres quedar lleno, debes pedir una double por 9,45. Yo recommendo la Shack especial que es de carne y Hongo portobello. Para mi es la mejor!!",,,
187,Rashid M.,"New York, NY",1157,973,650,4.0,5/7/2015,Love Shake Shack!  Some of my favorite burgers around.This location has outdoor seating too. Line moved pretty fast when I came here during lunch.,1,,
188,Kevin G.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,258,37,4.0,8/13/2016,"This is the secret Shake Shack hidden in the shaded alleyway between the Goldman Sachs building and the Regal Movie Theater.  Even though the location is decent-sized with 2 dozen tables, it still can't handle the demand from its beef seeking patrons.  This location is quieter on the weekends when the work week crowd is gone.  Anyway it has the same quality food and drink you've come to expect from the Shake Shack brand.",,,
189,Jagoda S.,"Clifton, NJ",121,33,33,4.0,10/22/2017,"After a day of strolling around the Financial District, my husband and I were looking for a quick bite. We didn't want something like McDonald's but didn't care about something fancy. Yelp saved me on this one, and I can say trust the reviews on this one. We were really hungry, the line was REALLY long and it took a few minutes to order (Sunday mid-afternoon time), but the wait was worth it. The place was a little too packed for my liking but I assume many tourists eat here and well, this place is just really good. I ordered the crispy chicken burger and my husband got the Smoke Shack burger. Both were really good and fresh! The fries were super hot and crispy, yummy. My hubby also ordered a vanilla shake and we got a lemonade to drink. Both were good and overall, this place is a win. Lunch for 2 with 2 burgers, 2 fries, 1 shake, and 1 large drink = $30. Not bad for NYC. 4 stars only because of the wait time, I understand there were way too many people but we had to literally be on top of others to get a table, too. Avoid peak times during weekends...",,,
190,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64753,5.0,4/22/2013,"Maybe not the best burger, but Shake Shack is the best place to go when you want a really satisfying burger meal because they have the total package.Along with an incredibly good burger, they also have some of the best fries and by far the best dessert in their custard and concretes.I have yet to try the overwhelmingly silly-looking Shack Stack, which consists of their cheeseburger along with their Shroom Burger (fried mushroom filled with cheese), since it just looks like a mess and kind of impossible to eat enjoyably. I usually stick to a standard Double Shack Burger, until I went recently and discovered the SmokeShack, which is even more incredibly good. It's basically just one of the best bacon cheeseburgers ever. It's not a very thick patty, but it all holds together really well and is extremely tasty and satisfying.As mentioned above, the fries here are amazing. I'm not usually a fan of the crinkle cut, but they are so good here: every single one is nice and crispy and piping hot fresh out of the fryer. This is one thing that sets it head and shoulders above other similar chains. For example, some may argue that In-N-Out has better burgers, but the fries there are straight garbage, so I'll take Shake Shack any day for the complete, satisfying meal.And lastly, speaking of a satisfying meal, there's no better way to end a meal of a greasy burger and fries than with some refreshing ice cream dessert of some kind. They have frozen custard here, with a rotating set of daily special flavors, as well as shakes, though I always pass on these two choices in favor of the specialty Concretes, which are some of the best dessert options ever. These are just genius sundae combinations made with that delicious custard they have. I usually sub the standard flavor for the special of the day if it happens to be good. When I went last Saturday, I got the awesome Downtown Butter Brown with Salted Caramel Custard. Trust me when I tell you that you should try each and every one of the concretes on the menu (and then each and every one at every single other location since each one has its own unique list of concretes).The one usual drawback to Shake Shack, the long lines (though that has diminished a bit since there are so many locations), is typically absent at this location, much like all of the undiscovered stuff in Battery Park City. There's no better day than having a meal as described above followed by a good movie at the Regal theater next door, which will also be empty, even on the weekends.The Shake Shack empire is expanding at an unstoppable rate. I am most excited for a planned location at JFK so there's finally a decent option for some airport food.",9,2,3
191,Thomas B.,"Grand Blanc, MI",36,286,131,4.0,7/6/2016,"I did enjoy my burger and fries, but disagree with my daughters about this popular place being any better than five guys.  Quality was good and service was prompt. I would revisit",,,
192,Jay J.,"Birmingham, AL",270,31,2,5.0,6/3/2017,An unbelievable burger for the price. Great service and great value. I love the location near Battery Park! This is definitely the best fast casual burger you can get in NYC. If I could think of a negative it would be that they need more locations to make it less busy during the lunch rush!,,,
193,Cayla T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",420,420,754,5.0,7/4/2015,"Love this place! At first, my burger was a little undercooked but they more than happy to give me another. The cheese fries are AMAZING!

194,Dana M.,"New York, NY",113,307,113,3.0,6/26/2015,"I love(d) shake shack. This was one of the first hamburgers I ever had; however, I have learned that, although this burger is great (especially the burger with the shroom patty also), there are many other burgers in NYC that are infinitely better and not much more expensive.There is ALWAYS a line here which gets really frustrating. And you have to stand over tables in order to find a place to sit (it's just way more stress than I would like to deal with when eating).Milkshakes are AMAZING and fries are pretty good, but the burgers are below what I remember them to be. If you are looking for a quick bite, this would be a good spot (if the line isn't out the door to the Conrad), but if you are looking for a GOOD or relaxing bite, this is probably not the place to go.",,,
195,Kayla M.,"Brooklyn, NY",158,138,161,2.0,2/4/2016,"Not good at all. I'm sorry, New York! This place is overhyped af! My chicken sandwich was too salty and overall mundane. Those fries were a travesty. And my mom said her burger tasted like mush. So there's that. Also, who doesn't have 1000 island or grilled onions?! #HowSway?! Two stars for the ambiance and my tasty beer. This Cali girl will stick to In N Out and Fatburger from now on. #SorryNotSorry.",3,4,1
196,Parul G.,"New York, NY",155,203,486,5.0,7/15/2015,"I mainly come here for the hot dogs and the shakes....so don't ask me about the burgers :) Though my husband has had the mushroom burger, which he really loved. I not being a fan of mushrooms have always had the hot dogs!So being a creature of habit I always get the chicken dog with shack cago aka all the fixins and of course fries! Their chicken dog is probably one of the best ones I've had and with all the toppings its just downright delicious. Their fries are always crispy and some of the best fries around. The shakes are amazing and filling to say the least. Plus I love the location, always plenty of seating and right next to the movie theater! Overall if you're looking for a casual place to eat around Battery Park or just looking to try out a NYC staple, then this is the place for you!",,,

198,Alex M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1834,152,982,5.0,1/14/2015,"Was my first time eating Shake Shack outside of Metlife Stadium where the Mets play and I must say it hit the freaking spot.I got a bacon burger and a bacon hotdog. I like my food dry so the burger was nice and juicy with the addition of tomato, lettuce and onion but the hot dog a bit try but I guess its my fault for liking things dry.We came 20 minutes before closing so there were no horror lines like the reviews Ive heard about this place with the long waits. So I guess the tip of the day is come towards closing to by pass the long lines. The cashier and another staff member we came across were extremely friendly and was a pleasure spending the extra couple of dollars this place costs compared to other places with this style of a menu.I will be back! I am still full from everything I ate here and ready to explode hopefully that was not TMIBTW I also got a glass of Rose Wine for $8 I must say it was not bad at all! Check out the pictures I posted from here.... WARNING they will make you hungry.",3,2,2

Seating is abundant but limited all at the same time. I usually eat inside I love the concrete floors and the set up but outside is nice as well.",,,
