0,R P.,"New York, NY",10,65,14,4.0,6/7/2018,"WELL!!! ... feels more like a smaller Whole Foods, that you can eat in. Very organized , I guess cause the supervisor is always visible....but still. The cooks DON'T TALK WHILE THIER COOKING  which is great , I think the more focused a chef is the better the breakfast will be .The ppl who come eat here are pretty much chill -in-and-out business types ...casual folks ..I never had a bad order , that's all.",,,

Prices were very reasonable. Convenient hours of operation even on Sunday when the area isn't busy. For coffee, good alternative to Starbucks; has decaf where Starbucks doesn't.",,,

The guys cooking behind the counters are hard workers and are very pleasant and efficient! I came here twice; once to get breakfast (banana choc chip pancakes) and another time to get a lunch sandwich (chicken chipotle wrap). Both items were delicious, I couldn't even complain. They make great food and the place is also clean and tidy which I like!",2,2,2

I Am Never stepping Into GIgi's ever again and Even so they don't care ! everyone else seems friendly but I will Not tolerate disrespect , From someone That I am ordering from .

6,Katie B.,"Plainview, NY",171,1,4,2.0,11/4/2018,"The food combinations here are great and I love the quinoa bowls but I'm very disappointed with a few things. 1- the food is left out and is never covered with a clear top so the flies that get into the Cafe, sit on the food (gross). 2 - the service has not been the best on multiple occasions, today in particular I had to tell the guy what I wanted multiple times and he still messed up my order. I'm only writing this review because I would like to see some improvement, I do enjoy coming here but if I don't see a change, I may have to look elsewhere.",,,
7,Lizzette M.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,5.0,11/5/2018,Gigi Cafe is like a hidden gem in Chelsea. The food here is really good and the service is on point. Tony makes my breakfast every morning and he really pays attention to request and details. Definitely worth a visit!!,,,

So I decided to stop by for their lunch specials and give it a chanceI got a salad for $7, I got spinach, grilled chicken, avocado, bacon and edamame with dijion dressing.

The restaurant replaced items I ordered with things I'd never order and everything tasted old, dried out.. The order took three hours for delivery... I had to call the restaurant three times. Never again, total waste of money!!! Everything except the pre-packaged pound cake tasted like it had mold on it... The smoothies were delivered half full and tasted horrible. I actually got sick drinking just a few sips. Obviously I wouldn't recommend Gigi Cafe and I'll never order from here again!",,,
16,Judy L.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",0,15,0,2.0,1/23/2018,This review is based on their lobster bisque only. I had to write it to give heads up of it's wired taste. First it was too sweet with imitation crab or some white tofu looking ingredient. And no real seafood taste at all so go for other veggie soups if you'll.Price is in average to little higher range so not sure if I'll return any time soon but maybe I'll try their sandwich or salad next time.,,,
17,Shannon C.,"New York, NY",169,250,48,4.0,10/25/2017,"This is the best quick to-go shops in the area. Healthier food, more options and more reasonably priced than the other quick stop places around.",,,
18,Han K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0,3.0,6/7/2018,My friends and I used to get salad here often when I was studying at FIT (directly across the street). I stopped coming here after trying my salad and had a rude surprise of the tofu being completely frozen. Attempting to eat a salad with chunks of frozen bits was not ideal for me. I liked this place but after that it was never worth the $10 salad for another surprise.,,,
19,Gabriella D.,"Brooklyn, NY",178,318,928,5.0,7/29/2017,"I am a huge fan of breakfast food and this place hits the nail on the head AND without breaking your pockets! We had french toast, waffles and an egg and cheese sandwich on toasted bread. It was in the $5 range for the french toast and for the waffles as well which is awesome. I tend to like my french toast made a little lighter but it was okay because I didn't specify beforehand. All in all, it's good if you are in the area looking for a decent breakfast option. The staff is quite nice too and I noticed that they deliver.",2,1,2
20,Natsuki S.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/5/2018,"Never ordering from then again. I placed an order this morning. After waiting 20 minutes longer than my estimated delivery time, I called the store to check in with my order. Apparently, my item wasn't supposed to be on their menu before Lunch.

21,Lisa M.,"Garnet Valley, PA",92,475,200,3.0,9/28/2017,"I stopped by here after getting to Penn Station by train and I was starving and wanted to pick up something before going to my hotel.   They had a lot of choices it seemed like.  I went with the egg whites, cheese and salsa on a spinach tortilla.  It was pretty decent and hearty which was perfect because I needed something to hold me over few a few hours.  Its right in midtown ( right? don't know, I'm from out of town)  so its right were all the touristy places are so I think it was $6 and change but I'm sure the price could have been worse.",,,
22,Sarah V.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",219,18,6,1.0,10/26/2017,The quality of food is good and fresh but the service the people give here is unbelievable!!!!I'm an FIT student and I've come here numerous times and because of the attitude they give just preparing my food it makes it so unpleasant. I really never go now. And to top it off when I'm getting my salad made and the person puts the wrong dressing in. They give the nastiest look ever like it's your fault. Like that is not professional whatsoever. I rather pay more at fresh & co or even walk further down to sweetgreen then to deal with this service anymore!,,,
23,Zoei D.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,21,0,5.0,1/26/2018,I usually order from here breakfast is on point prices are fair and delivery fast so I can highly recommend gigi. They got eggs veggies and a bunch of other good stuff you can find hewalthy and vegetarian options there as well,1,1,1
24,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,4.0,2/5/2017,"Not your regluar deli with flavorless food. I believe I have already tried everything in their menu and everything has been good. Particularly like their salads (you can choose unlimited toppings!), soups, and healthy plates. Side salads and yogurts also stand out.Pretty good quality and quantity for the price in this part of town.They are also very quick to deliver :)The guy from Cairo always welcomes us with a smile, so another plus!",,,
25,Laura M.,"New York, NY",3,73,42,5.0,7/25/2017,Stumbled upon this place because I saw they had $1 iced coffee. Much to my surprise it's probably the best iced coffee I've ever had! (which says a lot because I'm an avid coffee drinker) its strong but not bitter and you can't beat the price. Staff is very friendly which makes me want to visit daily.,,,
26,Ariel S.,"New York, NY",394,107,57,3.0,2/3/2018,"To sum Gigi Cafe locations in a few words: overpriced healthy bites. If you're in a rush, which is always my status when I happen to be near a Gigi Cafe, this place is god-sent. Their pre-made chipotle quinoa black bean salads and chia seed pudding mixes are their best items, if not pricey and small-portioned. The atmosphere is a mere afterthought (as is their design) and their checkout lines are bearable.  Bottom line: ideal for a quick lunch or getaway snack.",,,
27,Shai K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/25/2018,"For the 9 days our family stayed in NYC, it was our favorite cafe. The food was excellent, and we tasted all kind of dishes, the salad was supreme. Above all the friendly workers was an add on to the above.

32,Peter P.,"Dover, NJ",11,21,8,1.0,5/31/2016,First time and won't be going back. Unfortunate because all that really failed was giving a customer old and moldy bread. Come onnnnnnn.,,,
33,Russell W.,"New York, NY",37,143,0,4.0,3/9/2016,"GiGi on 24th is great for what it is. The coffee is good, salads are nice and the service is exceptional.  The only issue I have is that when you get there in the morning, even before 7, they have the music on at a volume which precludes all forms of coherent thought or early morning pre-work relaxation. Seriously, I think at times it is enough to make the Dalai Lama curse their mothers.Other than that, big fan.",,,
34,Ed S.,"Des Moines, IA",7,104,12,3.0,7/18/2017,"it was OK.  and to be fair, it was my first time there and they have a complicated system with multiple menus and multiple counters.  i had a ""Mexican"" omelette that was good, not great.  i think it could have been better, but it was not bad necessarily.the staff were very pleasant and friendly.if i were in NY again, i would definitely give it another chance.",,,
35,Frank Luigi M.,"Manhattan, NY",31,96,13,3.0,6/30/2016,"I like many customers of GiGí (note the accented i) have been in a rush, double-booked, conflicted, late and/or possibly forced at gunpoint. Under relentless pressure by coworkers (ie. Gregorious Bell) I have had to eat here. The scene walking in is similar to that of a 5 year olds piñata...pure chaos. Talk about sensory overload!! Muffins, salads, ramen, chips, sushi, you name it... its all at arms distance. I refuse to come here without horse blinders, otherwise I end up on a junk food spending spree and paying $48 for lunch. My sole focus here is the salad.Not to name some of the greats in this category *cough*sweetgreen*cough*, GiGi is definitely a decent option for the area. Even with its feel of an upscale bodega, it produces good salads with fresh ingredients. It might not have roasted-seasonal ingredients like its competition or a line, but it has character. It is the underdog of salads and as long as I'm in a rush I will be a fan.",2,,

41,Greg B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,6/30/2016,"What can one say about Gigi? Two words: Pure delight. Chris and Rene have earned PHD's in creating a salad. True artists.

43,Robert S.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,88,14,5.0,4/24/2016,"Best salad I've ever had!!! Simply amazing!Their salad area is set up similar to Chipotle and Subway. You choose the type of fresh lettuce/greens to start off, which proteins or meat you'd like in it, and all the other toppings. At the end you choose the dressing and if you'd like it chopped up or not. They're super quick and efficient. And the salad was delicious!

Not very helpful on the phone they just tell you to call seamless and you can have your order in 2 hours when it's already 15 mins past when they say they will deliver.

47,Betty L.,"Manhattan, NY",300,124,250,5.0,1/12/2015,"I work around the area and have been coming here for years ever since I first discovered it. It can get busy during lunch time, but the ordering and checkout process is usually rather quick. The service is superb and the staff are all extremely friendly and attentive.Salads - they have great unlimited topping salads with fresh ingredients. One of the main reasons why I like Gigi salads so much is because of their unlimited toppings. You pick one meat, two premium items, and the rest are unlimited. There are other places I've been to in the city where you are charged for each specific item, which can really rack up the price.Soups - They have different soup choices everyday. Just call or check online. My favorite soups from here are the broccoli cheddar, new England clam chowder, and beef barley. I'm not a big fan of chicken noodle soup, only because I find it too oily. But I definitely recommend the others!Sandwiches - There's a variety of signature sandwiches/wraps/paninis to choose from. You can also request for them to make you a custom wrap with ingredients of your choosing. I often opt for the soup/sandwich combo where you will get a small soup and half a sandwich. Some of the ones I recommend are the chicken milano, perfect philly cheese steak, and cranberry-nut chicken Salad They recently revamped their entire menu and raised prices, but they do offer good deals if you place an order online via their website. The deals (available via coupon code) changes every month, with some offering 25% off your entire order! You can also buy their giftcards for 20% off. So if you are like me and come here quite frequently, then you're better off getting a $50 giftcard and paying $40.I usually take my order to go, but there is a small seating area in the back for those who prefer to sit in. I never get phone reception (T-Mobile) in that area, but there's free wifi available!",1,,1

The only thing I think they can improve is a maybe a little more warmth, definitely a little more cleanliness.  A lot of those tables were kind of dirty when I walked up to them.  But a quick swipe with a napkin and I was good to go.  And that's saying a LOT for this clean-freak over here. Add that to the fact that prices are pretty reasonable for a healthy joint.  I don't care what you guys say - Gigi is nothing fancy, but it definitely does the job for me!",5,3,6

54,Denise W.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",110,182,1190,2.0,11/12/2014,"They sometimes offer a deal for lunch if you grab one of their combos. I ordered online and picked it up at the front counter. The ladies checking out were very nice. When you pay with a card, they make you sign the receipt with a Sharpie. You keep the top ""signed"" portion and your signature doesn't even come though on the copies they keep because you tend to not press down hard on a Sharpie... oh well...The 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup is very small. The sandwich was smaller than the cup the soup came in. It was also advertised as ""Lump Crab Cake Sandwich."" When you use the terminology of ""Lump"" you kind of expect real crab meat not imitation crab. There's nothing lump about those red colored sticks of processed pollock and starch glue. I didn't expect a lot of crab from the price but they still should not be lying to the customer and not have any crab at all with that verbiage. Plus they oddly top it with cheese and slightly spiced mayo. Maybe they ran out of the roasted peppers and onions described in the menu and subbed it with cheese?The Chicken Noodle soup was boring and watered down. The broth also tasted more vegetable than chicken with small pieces of carrot, celery and chicken meat clumped on the bottom.The food was edible but I won't be returning. There are enough fresh lunch places in the area that don't try to skimp every chance they get, lie to the customer, and actually offer real deals to get people in the door during lunch.",1,,1

Updated review","My go to breakfast place Fresh Bites was closed for renovations so I decided to try out Gigi. Ordered bacon and eggs. No one can get that wrong! When I got home the bacon looked and felt like plastic. You could not bite into, it was so solid and like rubber. I brought it back in, they were so nice. Told me it tasted that way because it was turkey bacon. UGH. Maybe they should have told me?! They did offer me other things but since I had eaten the eggs who cared at that point. What I thought they should have done was refund me the money for the faux-bacon which had to be 1/2 the cost.  (and I tipped a dollar) Didn't want to argue the toss, just said okay will never go in there again.",,,
61,M S.,"Elmsford, NY",2,101,30,3.0,5/11/2017,I tried this place a couple of times. The cashiers are...weird. The food here is eh and the coffee is too bitter. It's okay for once in awhile. Take advantage of their specials. If you don't mention you want whatever special from the menu they're just charge you an insane amount like everything else in the city. It seems like more of the type of place you would cater an office breakfast meeting from. I definitely wouldn't go here anymore tho.,,,

64,Kate R.,"New York, NY",120,17,3,3.0,3/13/2015,"Gigi is between the subway exit and my office, so I've been getting my morning coffee there for about 2 years. There was always this mean salad bar lady who would yell at people for taking too long, but for some reason they made her a cashier. She regularly raises her voice at customers, rolls her eyes, and today she took my order, then proceeded to ring me up on a register at the other end of the counter. When I did not notice that she had switched registers, she yelled at me and then made fun of me to her (uncomfortable) coworkers in spanish. While I was standing right there.A couple of months ago, she sternly reprimanded me for not smiling at her, remarking ""DO YOU EVER SMILE?"" Well not at when I'm having to interact with you before I've had a drop of coffee. It's Monday morning, 8 am, and you're acting like an insolent teenager.Another time she got my order wrong (large coffee, black...incredibly simple), and when I tried to correct her, she rolled her eyes before slowly and begrudgingly correcting the order.The only time I've ever seen her act kindly was with hot guys that she would flirt with, holding up the line.As of Monday morning, I'm finding a new coffee place. This woman is unbearable.",1,1,1
65,Claire V.,"London, United Kingdom",2,18,12,5.0,8/9/2016,"I've eaten here four times now. The powerbowls are just amazing! I've tried the fajita bowl, the Greek style bowl, and the health haven. I will definitely be going back again and again. Last time I tried a sandwich, the tuna melt, which was perfect as well. The manager and all the staff were very very helpful, kind and professional. I had a wonderful experience each time. While popular, the line is never too long as each server works very fast. The smoothies are excellent as well.",,,

68,Inga S.,"Long Island City, NY",293,194,24,4.0,1/22/2015,"Typically, I get their salads. I like the pick-it-yourself-customizable-greens situation they've got going on. It looks like it's the cleanest Gigi's in a good 1-2 mile radius.The only ""problem"" I find sometime, is that they give me too many salad choices (but sometimes not the right ones!) Yesterday, I was there and they didn't have kale or beets. And that, was beat.Occasionally, they'll have pasta specials which is amazing. Pasta, slathered with all the fixings that you'd love and want on your penne loveliness. At a great price.Service (especially at the food bar) is great as well. They're extremely nice, fast, and polite. It's a good place to get your quick chow.",2,1,1

However, for the past two weeks both a colleague and I have felt something has been ""off"" with our salads. We think they started watering down the salad dressings with oil or water...seems wet and flavorless. They also started skimping on the toppings and hoarding avocados. Seems only their favorite customers get those? Weird. Anyone else noticing a difference with their salads? Time to look for a new lunch spot.",,,
71,Celia R.,"New York, NY",332,6,1,5.0,3/29/2016,Staff is very friendly and always smiling. They know their regulars very well. I live next door so I came in sick today for a muffin and the lady behind the counter noticed I wasn't feeling well and made me tea with honey.,,,1
72,Susie L.,"New York, NY",10,28,1,2.0,2/7/2015,"I ordered their Garden & Quinoa salad on a Saturday as part of a company-account lunch order.  When it arrived, I was disappointed to see that it was one of those prepackaged salads in a plastic container.  It definitely did not give off a fresh smell when I opened it, and tasted even less so.  I suppose I shouldn't expect much on a Saturday but to sell 2-day old salad seems a bit much.  I ate 3 bites and then was done.  It was edible but the smell was just too much.",1,,
73,Enrique S.,"East Northport, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/9/2017,I eat here almost everyday. My body thanks me greatly for it. My recommendation: get the omlete quesadilla. I felt like I've never had something this incredible in my life. It's a western omelet baked into a spinach wrap quesadilla. What an amazing food invention. The staff is always nice and welcoming as well. Shoutout to Ruby at the cash register,,,

This is a direct message to the older lady who works the cash register that sounds African or from the islands. She is very rude every time I order iced coffee as if she's is annoyed she has to uh, maybe work while she's at work. Very combative and argumentative with customers. Don't tell me what I ordered in a condescending way. As if I didn't know what I asked for...Other than that great salad bar.",,,
76,Božanka V.,"Cambridge, MA",241,1,0,1.0,8/25/2016,Found something (I would still rather not now what) in my coffee. The response to the event by the staff was horrible.

77,Nan W.,"Manhattan, NY",30,91,28,1.0,11/11/2014,"Unfortunately, most people that drop into Gigi Cafe are on the go & don't have time to look up reviews. I normally wouldn't waist my time reviewing a fast food joint, but I have had enough with this place. What's too bad is the food is actually good, great selection, and it's extremely conveniently located to my daily routine. But unfortunately, their great food is masked by a horrible staff. (Not all of them. There are a couple nice guys behind he sandwich bar). But the salad girls & cashier girls are consistently rude and disrespectful almost every time I have gone in there. At first I thought ""whatever"" cause I'm in and out. But I don't appreciate being treated poorly for no apparent reason when I am spending my money supporting a business. It's amazing that people like that are even employed! Great food, but management needs to change up the staff or I think a lot of people will go somewhere where they don't have to deal with shitty attitudes. It's New York, plenty of other places to choose from!!",2,,

The food is really delicious and has a unique taste. This is actually the 7th time coming to this store and can't stop myself coming back. I love the pasta!!! Also the salad its good after a good workout. Salad is prepared right infront of you and cant complain is all fresh. Quick story i went inside the store to ask for directions but the appetizing smell made me forget what i went inside for. That day i ordered pasta, Penne alla Vodka. So guys go try it out!!!",1,,

81,AJ L.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,63,51,2.0,9/7/2014,"I have only tried their pasta station... so I could not really comment on the quality of the sandwiches and soup (which according to my boyfriend to be quite delicious). I came in one day after seeing their pasta special... $6.99, which is not a bad deal in the area. The first red flag of their pasta station was the conductive stovetops. Second, I was told that you could get only three toppings for pasta special. If you get the normal fourth topping, it will be $2. To me, that just seems not a classy movie. Seriously, how much will it cost to get some onion? I got the pesto fettuccine and it was absolutely  abhorrent. The pasta was lukewarm (I ate it there!) and there were at least three full table spoons of pure grease at the bottom. It WAS horrific.I am going going back to Sunac.... they are gourmet in comparison to Gigi.",2,,

My partner and I both got the breakfast sandwiches which were very good. It's your basic bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a Kaiser roll. The bacon was turkey bacon. Everything on the menu appears to be health conscious, which is good. I think this is a spacious food cafe for someone who needs a quick meal at an affordable price.",,,
84,Keith B.,"Hoboken, NJ",3,5,0,1.0,11/1/2014,"The food is actually really tasty, this review is based on the service/delivery.I ordered and THREE separate items did not arrive. I called them immediately, at 4:10pm and was told they are already closed (their hours say they close at 5pm) and nothing they can do. I asked him how do I get a refund of the missing items and he hung up on me.I'm sure Seamless will make it right since it was ordered through them, but yet another in an increasing number of places where the staff ruin what would be a much higher review if based only on food quality.",1,,
85,David O.,"Long Island City, NY",328,64,1,4.0,3/17/2014,"Reviewing this as an office. I worked in here for a few hours, from 10 am to 1pm and no one bothered me. There's a ton of seating in the back so you can probably sprawl out comfortably.The free wi-fi here was pretty fast -- pw is ""gigicafe"" . There are several outlets around the walls so you can charge your stuff.There's a single occupancy public bathroom with lock if you need to... you know... wash your hands.Lunch is typical cafe food, sandwich is decent.Recommended as a vagabond workplace over Starbucks.

88,Foodie G.,"New York, NY",11,56,6,1.0,6/30/2014,"Beyond annoying to get a catering quote. The woman insisted I go through the menu with her, item by item. I ended the call immediately.  I'm a busy professional and don't have time for nonsense. I also have 2 other catering companies providing quotes, of which Gigi Cafe will not be a part of from now on.Due to one lousy phone call, Gigi just lost my business for multiple events that I host, due to her extremely unprofessional behavior. I would NOT recommend anyone to deal with a pushy and RUDE catering sales person. Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.",1,,
89,Gyatso G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/18/2016,"Worst fastfood I've ever tried in NYC.I purchased a spinach pie with a cup of soup earlier today. The spinach pie is very oilet and full of cheese spoiling my appetite. The soup is okay. But what really makes me angry is their vulnerable paper cup with extremely poor quality:I didn't finish the oiled pie and soup and grap it to my office for later use. When I was ready to eat them, I add some hot water into the paper cup used to containing the hot soup, consequently the paper cup break up into part, hot soup hurting my hand and contaminating the floor. As common sense a paper cup is intended to carry hot liquid, such as tea, but Gigi Cafe's answer is that it's intended to break up and hurt you.",,,

Updated review","Almost 2 years later and I'm still a fan of Gigi cafe for the following reasons:-Tend to have weekly lunch specials every now and again-Unlimited toppings on your salad (which is a bargain in midtown)- Their pasta, specifically their lasagna, is amazing - Ordering via Seamless is quick & painless- They offer items you'd find at your local deli (yogurt, chips, soda, etc.)",,,

The workers are awesome and very pleasant to be dealing with you. What I live he most is how clean the place is ALWAYS. I DEF RECOMMEND IT! The think about this. I get and egg white omelet with chesse and veggies and home fries and toast and and a medium ice coffee all for 5.29 on 34th st. And it tastes good.,,,

96,Pam Y.,"New York, NY",0,10,5,2.0,12/17/2013,"I'd like to protest the extra $1 charge for walnuts on oatmeal. I eat oatmeal regularly at both the 7th Ave location and on the Upper West side location. One is near my office, the other is near my home.They do not charge a $1 extra for the walnuts at the UWS location.I feel this is an arbitrary charge, but it really adds up when I get oatmeal there 3 days a week. The fee was not charged when they first opened. And the fee is randomly applied.It's convenient to get my oatmeal from there - but it is an abusive surcharge, no one else in the neighborhood charges extra. Guy & Gallard, Fresh and Co, Pret A Manager and Panera all have oatmeal as well. I see this location charges just about everybody who goes through the line for food extra for something.",1,,
97,Rob D.,"New York, NY",3,37,0,5.0,9/14/2015,"Great lunch spot. The staff is very friendly. In fact, maybe the friendliest staff I've ever encountered at a lunch spot. The food is good, and service is very fast. I'm usually in and out of there in less than 5 minutes. There's a good variety of pre-made sandwiches, as well as some soups, a salad-mixing bar, and a pasta station where they will make your pasta with unlimited toppings. Prices are reasonable. The pastas are only $8, and the sandwiches are $7. And they often have specials where they take a dollar off the sandwiches and the pastas. I now go there 2-3 times a week.",,,

After a few hours of having it, I'm having violent stomach cramps (this was the only thing I ate all day).Either make the sandwiches by hand there, or keep track of your food so they don't end up sitting there for hours, or even days.

99,Becki F.,"Syracuse, NY",133,30,1,3.0,5/8/2013,"I work in the neighborhood and have been eating from Gigi's several times a week since they opened.  I always get their salads, which are large and they offer a nice selection of quality ingredients to choose from.  This counter is always busy, but the hard working employees back there really keep things moving, which is great when I'm on my lunch break.  Unfortunately, I do have a few issues with them that keep me from giving more stars.  When I started coming here, I would always choose shrimp as my protein, and was charged the same basic price for my salad.  But about a month or two ago, they starting charging $2 extra for shrimp, making my salad cost almost $12.00.  I don't know if they raised the price, or if they were always supposed to be charging me more, but I find $12 to be a bit much for a salad at a take-out cafe.  On top of that, the shrimp that I received today was not fully cooked.  I discovered this only after I had been eating it, so I'm really hoping that I don't end up sick.  Potential food poisoning was not exactly the splurge that I had in mind when paying my extra $2 today!  I've also had a few unpleasant encounters with the cashiers here too, who tend towards the young and rude end of the spectrum.  I've said to myself a few times that I won't go here again, but I guess that I'm not in it for the service, because I keep showing up for their delicious salads.  Though in the future I will definitely be avoiding the shrimp!",3,,

Hit or miss depending on who is cooking and if the person taking your order can process what you're saying. The reason for my one-star review is their pricing policy. I'll admit, it's a bit petty but for a side of eggs, they charge $4.67. They automatically upgrade you to a platter even though you are only asking for 2 eggs. Management tried to convince me to try the home fries with my eggs the next time because they are free with the eggs.Unreasonable business practices. Taking my business in the morning elsewhere.",5,,

I think I have tried almost every soup on their menu. I have tried  the lentil, chicken florentine, clam chowder, baja chicken, broccoli cheddar, lobster bisque, carrot ginger, and etc. I loved them all and especially the carrot ginger. They have a very wide and extensive soup menu and they're all excellent. Downside:  I found a tiny piece of paper when I was eating my clam chowder. I thought that was pretty gross, but since all the soups taste so good it doesn't even bother me. Also, they have fresh-baked bread and oyster crackers for your soup.  They give you free samples of the soup before you make your decision.  The pressed sandwiches are all very good.  I usually go with my no-fail chicken fajita or chipotle turkey sandwich for about $6-$8.  I never have a bad meal here. The service is very nice and friendly. The place is clean and spotless with bright lights.  They have lots of table to dine-in.  They usually have special offers on their company website.  I took away a star because sometimes they take so long with putting my order together.  I have to wait like an additional 10 mins when I ordered it online a while back.  I understand they are very busy during the lunch rush, but it seems like they don't really track online orders very well.",1,,
111,Aaron T.,"Chino Hills, CA",2,2,0,1.0,12/27/2013,"I wrote this review originally on google review. I'm repeating it here. P.S. The other review I am referring to below is from google reviews for this restaurant location. So last night my mom and I were walking from the Macy's on W 34th Street to this location. We left a few minutes before 9 pm, my nav said it would take about 10 minutes to walk to this location. I thought we had plenty of time to walk here since it was only a few blocks away. We arrived right at 9 pm and when we walked in the person inside said they were CLOSED. I thought, no way?!?! Shouldn't they be open til 10 pm? I didn't tell them anything, I just left, but my mom and I were quite upset that we had walked the whole way there in the COLD weather and they had decided to close an hour early. I guess I can kind of understand that they wanted to close because their restaurant was a ghost town. There were no customers in the place and only the three employees I saw when I walked in. So from a business stand point it makes sense to close the restaurant because they are losing money, but from a customer service stand point, they should have served us because it was cold outside, which the workers should have known, it is late December after all, and would have been appreciated. Instead they chose to refuse service to us. Maybe there's something wrong with this particular place. I'm not surprised after reading the other poor review on here. I know the review was a long time ago, but it shows that this location had poor customer service before. We decided to eat at another restaurant across the street and that place was packed.

117,Amanda B.,"Edison, NJ",60,44,0,4.0,5/30/2012,"I was actually pretty impressed with this place.  It opened a few months ago, and my initial reaction was ""Ehhhhhhhhhhh more sandwiches, soups, and salads.""  Because we really need that in the same neighborhood as Hale & Hearty, Pret, Fresh, Guy & Gallard, Panera, and countless delis.Gigi's won me over with the pasta line, the ambience, and the people.  They have a build-your-own pasta station... which I know is nothing new.  But between the wide variety of sauces, pasta-relevant meats, and fresh add-ins... it's awesome.The place is always spotless, and the employees are friendly and helpful.  It's even set up in a logical way - I forgot how nice it is not to trip over someone in the salad line on my way to the cashier!",2,,
118,Alexander S.,"New York, NY",15,12,1,3.0,5/11/2012,"Okay I am back again because what can I say, I love to review.Anyway lets stay on topic and talk about this little place that recently opened up next to the hectic FIT. FOODThe food is okay, the problem is that you can tell that the ingredients are cheap and that is prominent in the sandwiches which are warmed up in a turbochef oven (a glorified microwave/ convection oven found in starbucks, and dunkin donuts.) I understand that it is to bring down the price but what it does is give me a sandwich that does not satisfy me, it lacks flavor and the bread has this water like taste ( please tell me I am not the only one who understand what I mean.)It still is useful when you don't have the monies for something else, and honestly it isn't that bad just eh. SERVICEThe people are nice there for the most part, but that is because this place is fairly new and they could still be putting up the pony show that many new places do for awhile, then the employees settle in. Still, you are greeted with smiles and no one is rushing you. PRICEAs stated earlier, prices are okay here with a sandwich being around $6 and pasta bowls are $8.VISUAL NOTESYou might want to get sunglasses when you come in, lets just say there is lots of whites and bright colors trying to pull in an artistic crowd? Maybe it is to give the idea of cleanliness? I mean it is clean too which is excellent of course.The Verdict This place is good for the in the hurry student carrying a heavy Janpi and needs something to prevent fainting. Also the student who doesn't have the biggest budget for NYC food (aka me) although I do have some places I love to splurge on, which will be covered in other reviews.So what do you think? Let me know if you agree or dislike my review!",2,,

The ingredients are fresh, the establishment clean, and the staff always friendly to me.However.I do have quite a bit of qualms with them on Seamless. For starters, they mention that they deliver your food within 20-35min. NEVER has that time been honored, almost always it is an hour or later. Also, I always tend to have something messed up in my order. For example, the salad sometimes isn't chopped or the dressing is mixed in when I requested it not to be.GiGi is a safe bet when you visit the actual establishment, but beware for errors and inconveniences on Seamless.",,,

The Gigi employees (Rosa) and managers (Kevin) are professional and remembered my name and gave me great service.

My friend had the pasta - whole wheat penne, with chicken, tomato sauce, mushrooms, mozzarella and olives  The gentleman cooked the pasta in front of us - he knows his pasta and how to cook it. I couldn'tt resist. I had a mouthful - and all I can say is that it was ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS. She also got a piece of Italian bread to go with her pasta, which was the perfect side dish (go the carbs!!!!).I so wanted the pasta but after my food hangover from Christmas week,  I thought I would go with a salad (I'm still recovering). I had a small salad, which by the way is more like a large salad, with romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, egg whites, tomatoes, olives, onions, mango, strawberries, broccoli, grapes, almonds, and a balsalmic vinegarette. I love the combination of fruit and vegetables in a salad - yummy. Five stars for food. Always fresh, tasty.and plentiful. The staff are also ALWAYS cheerful and super friendly, which makes the experience so much better. GiGi's is also located by the 6 train, which makes my life so much easier getting home.

Updated review","The prices here are great, especially with the 25% off online order special, and the food is decent and fresh.  Taste-wise, it's not amazing but it's great for the value and decent enough.  I love the Mediterranean couscous with roasted veegtables is savory, light, and comes with plenty of roasted vegetables; it's also filling and healthy, and much better than the Food Exchange's version, which is overly greasy and simultaneously bland.  The fitness wrap with egg whites and a plethora of vegetables in a whole wheat wrap is a great breakfast option.  If you do get a catering platter from here, I would stay away from the steak skewers.  While they come with a great sauce, they are incredibly tough and sinewy.  Go for the salads instead, which are always solid and very fresh. The only detractor is that they don't offer a create-your-own salad bar option.  Otherwise, it's a very solid lunch option, where you are orderin in or getting catering.",1,,

There are so many verities to pick from which is great. you're not limited to iceberg lettuce or Italian blend. There is so much more options unlike other salad bars. The toppings are just so good. I didn't know which to pick since they all look so good to me. The presentation of the salad bar was just perfect. It made me want to try everything. The workers were very honest. I asked for kale and they said the kale is still a bit frozen since we kept it in the fridge etc.. But they said it still taste good it will get warmed up by the toppings. So I agree and still went with kale for the base. I had falafel, buffalo chicken, bacon, mozzarella cheese, cucumber, cherry tomato, corn, jalapeño, quinoa, and egg. For the dressing I asked for a bit of Italian and ranch. Ugh Everything about the salad was sooooo good. I can't wait to go back and try more.",,,

I wanted a cold, cheddar cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo and Gigi delivered at $4.67 with fresh, crunchy veggies (delicious tomatoes don't exist in this country, but that's not their fault), perfect amount of mayo.

145,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",719,1501,1720,4.0,6/15/2008,"I'm starting to buy in to this whole order in thing at lunch time. But more importantly, Gigi Cafe delivered for my catered lunch last week and it was fabulous. Not fabulous because it was so much tastier (it wasn't) but fabulous because I feel they went the extra mile compared to their equal counterparts Cafe Metro and Zeste.Gigi Cafe rolls out the red carpet to say the least. They put a table cloth down to at least make the feast somewhat presentable. Plus there is no shortage of food on your order. For about $15/person, you get a sandwich, 2 side salads, and dessert. The sandwich platter was stacked high and adorned with yummy veggie chips. Additional veggie sandwiches were on the side individually wrapped. There are many sides to choose from (every leafy green salad and pasta salad you could imagine). And the dessert platter was like none I have seen before. Chocolate covered strawberries, fudge, petit fours, and pine nut tarts! It was like venetian hour at a wedding!Service was on time and the price is very reasonable. Gigi Cafe just gives you a whole lot more.As for my personal review, their El Paso chicken sandwich is nicely spiced and very filling. The turkey sandwich is good. The veggie sandwich looks unappetizing and gross. The chicken caesar wrap is chunky but a little dry. I hear the sauteed spinach is either a hit or miss but their mashed potatoes are a definite winner, especially the cheddar mash. Oh my gosh their cheddar mash is awesome. Its smooth, creamy, buttery, a little salty, etc. It's the perfect consistency and its delicious. Get the side of mash for lunch. It's just $4.I like Gigi Cafe. They have specials every day and their prices are fair. $6 will get you a decent fresh sandwich and if you are lucky enough to get catered lunch, that dessert platter is not only a feast for the eyes but a feast for your sweet tooth.",1,,1

The place may be small, but it tends to pack a lot of people even during the late hours of the afternoon (3-4PM).  When asking the shotty service how long I would have to wait for a table, I was given a snobbish answer:  ""Wait till dinner time.""  That was enough to convince me that I didn't want to dine here right away.I decided to chance it and order delivery via Seamless Web instead and came away extremely disappointed.  The food was poorly packaged and probably mishandled as my broccoli and cheddar quiche was practically a pancake instead of a nice pie-wannabe shape.  My smoked turkey breast sandwich was not impressive and the Couscous side order looked about as plentiful as the contents of miniature salt shaker.  I think I will wait for awhile before I decide to change it again.",,,1

155,Tom C.,"New York, NY",126,25,3,3.0,9/27/2010,"At three stars, Gigi earns the highest rating I can bring myself to give one of Manhattan's seemingly infinite gourmet delis. Let's get the bad out of the way first. Gigi's is overpriced, like so many upscale Manhattan deli's. We're talking close to $7 for a wrap or panini, $1.50 for a small bag of chips and $1.25 for a can of warm soda...and Pepsi is not an option. Don't get me wrong - it's a bit better than places like Guy & Gallard and Pret, but still. I typically get my lunch accessories around the corner at Melanie's on 33rd, where I can get a cold Pepsi and a bigger back of chips for $1 each.All that said, their sandwiches are quite good.  Their Mediterranean fajita and chicken Milano paninis are excellent, and their crispy chicken cutlet, chicken Caesar and Gigi wraps are all great as well. I've also had their desert squares on a couple of occasions, and they are delicious. As a meat-lover, I've never taken advantage of their salad bar, but I've taken a peak, and it features a great selection of add-ins at a pretty good price. The staff is the friendliest around, and it definitely makes for as pleasant a deli experience as you can have in Murray Hill. The folks behind the counter are super attentive, and always serve you with a smile. There is seating in the back and Gigi's offers free wifi, though I generally order my food for take-out. They recently launched a revamped website that makes ordering online a breeze, and customers who order online can get 25% off their bill by entering the promo code ""25off."" Gigi is more or less my default back-up for lunch. It's never blown me away, but the food is consistently good, and the service really stands out. The online discount brings the price down just within the realm of reasonable.",,,

There's sandwiches, soups, salads, and pasta which you can customize. That's a plus for me if you're given the choice to customize! I ordered a pesto penne pasta with sundried tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. I asked if they could add in a little extra of the mozzarella cheese and they didn't mind. The pasta was made fresh in front of you, and yes they did add a bit too much of the pesto sauce, but that was something you could have told them beforehand.

The last straw was when I came in this afternoon &  received 'yeah, what do you want?' as a greeting. I can appreciate that lunchtime is a very busy time & can understand the need to speed things up. But I can't abide blatant rudeness when I am paying more for a piece of breaded chicken than I would for a cocktail. Guy & Gillard is a half a block away & the absence of rudeness there is a lot more palatable",6,,1
162,Becca F.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,253,0,4.0,10/12/2009,"Well after eating here at least once a week for over three years I figured it was time I gave good old Gigi some love.  I don't know about the food in general here but I do LOVE the salad bar.  Rarely do you find such a variety of mix-ins that are all truly fresh (and I'm a snob, I can tell when its been sitting there too long.)Best of all? It is one-price for as many toppings as your little heart desires.  You can have artichokes and olives and carrots and lentils and chickpeas and broccoli and tomatoes and egg whites and feta and asparagus and....but I digress, don't forget to ask for croutons.",1,1,2
163,Jessica L.,"Downtown Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,3.0,3/26/2013,Good spot for fast afordable breakfast and lunch,,,
164,Vanessa O.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,440,0,3.0,5/24/2012,"It is somewhat new, everything looks somewhat fresh, and the service is somewhat quick.  Nothing to write home about, but a good choice to grab something to go or if you work around here.  there are a TON of sandwich/soup/salad places and this is one of them.  Nothing new, nothing bad...I would go here again if that is all I wanted.",,,
165,Julia L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",44,5,1,5.0,8/20/2012,"LOVE this place. Come here for lunch at least twice a week. Staff is friendly and efficient, food is fresh and delicious, and they do unlimited toppings for pasta and salads. If you need somewhere to eat during your lunch break you should try this place.",,,
166,Laverne C.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,11,1.0,7/31/2010,"DON'T GO THERE FOR BREAKFAST! On 7/30/10 I ordered 2 eggs overeasy, toast, homefries, and toast. It took them 15 minutes to bring the order to the cashier. I noticed that the supervisor had to remind staff about my order when he saw me waiting. That was bad enough.When I sat down to eat it, it was cold soggy toast, cold bacon, tiny eggs, and  a tablespoon of half cooked home fries. FOR THE COST OF $6, with no coffee thrown in. I think the managment has changed for the worst. ON SECOND THOUGHT, DO GO THERE, PERIOD.",,,
167,Caryn H.,"New York, NY",28,96,0,4.0,5/5/2009,"I love this place. Maybe this is backwards, but I actually try to refrain from going here often as a lunch spot because I like it so much and want it to remain ""special."" Maybe I'm just ""special."" Anyway, they have great sandwiches (big fan of the pesto chicken salad!), a bunch of co-workers have thoroughly enjoyed the gyro platters and their salads are awesome ($8 for unlimited toppings - and the lowfat balsamic dressing is so good I am almost tempted to drink it). And with a lunch special you get a free lemonade, not bad at all! I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could - the missing .5 is because if I actually do make it outside for lunch, I like to sit and enjoy myself in a decent place, but this really is a deli/to-go kind of lunch spot. But it does its job quite well!",1,1,1
168,Matthew R.,"Austin, TX",11,47,0,4.0,9/15/2009,"I go to Gigi's a couple times a month. My office is right around the corner.The staff have always been friendly to me, even during lunch time when they are very busy. I always see the manager greeting people, as they enter.To be honest, when I first went there, I didn't expect the food to be that good, but it is. The salads are good. The ingredients taste fresh, and they have a nice selection of dressings. Most of them are fat free. Their wraps may be premade, in the back, but I enjoy them. The Gigi wrap is probably my favorite. They also have panini's and sandwiches on wedges and rolls. The breakfast sandwiches are very good, as well. I was impressed by them. They also serve more than just pork sausage. They also have turkey bacon, and beef sausage. I can finally have meat on my egg sandwich! They also have hot meals, and side dishes, and have the grill active to get a burger if you so please.As far as price goes, you will spend under $10 for lunch, but always over $5. They always have a bunch of lunch specials going. They used to give a free bottle of water, or fresh squeezed lemonade, but now have lunch and breakfast cards. My only problem is that after you fill up your card, to get your free lunch/breakfast, the free meal has to be valued at or under $5, which isn't easy to achieve. More possible at breakfast time then lunch time, but hard, none the less.",,,1

Extra 1/2 point for walnuts, almonds, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds they carry.All of this for $7.60 as small salad with unlimited toss-ins (I also tried their UWS location at Broadway and 72nd, where they dont have the ""unlimited"" option and  ""my"" salad came up to $10.50)ps: I usually eats here ""off-peak"" hours, so staff is friendly, tables are clean, stations with utencils, etc. are stock up.",,1,

Gigi is a solid choice, since they always have a plethora of sandwiches and hot entrees for the busy employee. Not sure what you want? Just get half a sandwich and a small soup. (They usually have about 6 choices of soup and over 2 dozen for sandwiches.) Lunch will cost you about $7 without a drink. Not too steep for midtown.",1,,1
