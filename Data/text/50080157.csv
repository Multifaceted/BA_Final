0,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",357,80,43,5.0,10/11/2018,"Always happy to support new businesses! I came here with friends to attend their first ever Trivia Night! We made it in time for happy hour, so we ordered a round of drinks. Beer was $5. They had a popcorn machine and would give you popcorn for free if you ordered a drink. I looked at the food menu to order dinner and was surprised to find that it was very small. Most were snacks (ex. nuts) or appetizers (charcuterie board), so the only option for an entr√©e sized meal was a pot pie (either chicken or mushroom). I ordered the chicken pot pie and it was DELICIOUS--the chicken was so tender and soft, and the crust was perfectly flaky and buttery. My suggestion for the establishment is to add a few more chairs/tables, because there is a LOT of room in between customers...maybe this is in tune with their farm to table vibe? But especially because there weren't that many people at trivia night (understandable, b/c it was their first one ever), it seemed very very empty. Also, I would recommend for them to add more items to their menu! Which I suspect they will do... Overall, great experience. I look forward to seeing this place gain popularity within Chelsea Market.",,,1
