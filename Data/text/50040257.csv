0,Evan P.,"Parkville, MD",8,4,1,4.0,10/21/2018,"Stopped in for brunch on a Saturday morning. The service was a little slow (we made reservations for when they opened) but the food was really great. We ordered a bloody mary and a pear bellini. Drinks took about half an hour to get  and the bloody was extremely lackluster. Real heavy on the tomato juice without much additional flavor.Once they had been open for a little while, service started to pick up a bit. This was rapidly approaching a 3 star rating until the food came. We ordered the short rib sandwich, the hangover burger, and a side of the hash with chipotle hollandaise. The food was really great. It took about 40 minutes to get to us, but it was worth the wait. Every aspect of the meal was well executed and we left eating far more than we should have. As long as there isnt a wait, we'll be back, but I wouldnt wait too long for a seat knowing how long it took to get items on the table.",,,

The table arrangement was outstanding, managing to be elegant yet intimate.  Quite a stunt with such a large party.The service and food were outstanding.The chef went out of his way to finesse my order.  Plaudits & *****",2,,
3,Yasmin A.,"New York, NY",204,170,310,5.0,7/1/2018,"Had an absolutely amazing dinner here. Was looking for something good close to my hotel in the rain. Saw this on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed. Cute hipster restaurant with great staff. Sat on the cushioned seats by the window. Wasn't too crowded when I went probably due to the rain and because it was closing in an hour.Ordered the papardella and it was SO DELICIOUS! The pasta was very large and wide and handmade. The meat was so tender, juicy, and tasteful that it melted in your mouth. Good portion size if you are hungry. If I wasn't so stuffed, I would have ordered a second portion.Will definitely be returning to eat this dish again and try the other dishes!",1,,1
4,Melzie C.,"San Mateo, CA",157,241,311,5.0,6/3/2018,"I had never been to NYC. I am a Californian - total food snob. I expect fresh, flavor, and inviting decor. I had less than 24 hours to eat my way through this city. I found this spot on OpenTable and booked it for a colleague and myself, and her flight made her miss out dinner. I stayed and had a tuna tartare and a prosciutto and arugula pizza. I loved both - fresh tuna, great chips, beautiful pie -- perfectly aged proscuittI loved the nighttime decor -- sexy brick, black wrought iron, and a big pizza oven. Intimate seating. I got to listen in on two different peoples conversation :P very entertaining!Next day, my colleague takes me to breakfast, a place her sister-in-law swears by. A ""must-see"". We walk a few blocks and I start laughing -- we're back at till and sprocket!I had a goat cheese and leek omelet and an americano. No clue what my colleague had -- I was far to absorbed in this omelet. Our waitress was lovely. Had great recommendations. I ate only at one restaurant out of all the places in NYC - and it was here. And I don't regret it one bit. I would love to come back again!",2,,
5,Deana T.,"Baltimore, MD",142,72,40,4.0,5/30/2018,"I came by for a quick lunch during my trip to NYC and this place was exactly what I was looking for. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and the MSG pizza (bechamel, mozerella, arugula, and prosciutto). The wine was good, and it was $13. Not sure on pricing of wine by the glass in NYC but this felt a little steep. The pizza was incredible. All the ingredients were fresh and the taste of the fresh mozzarella really came through. And there was a decent amount of prosciutto which is always a win in my book. The dough was fresh and perfectly cooked. I would gladly try some other pizzas at another time. The vibe inside was nice, but cramped. I was nearly elbow to elbow with the tables on either side of me. The food was good though which made up for the lack of personal space. I would probably come back if I was in the area again.",1,,
6,Danielle A.,"Ridley Park, PA",57,197,368,5.0,5/8/2018,"So we decided to do our girl's birthday in NYC this year, and the first thing i wanted to do was a funky New York brunch..... I got everything plus more here. Thanks to yelp for finding this gem!i was SHOCKED to walk in to this quaint, homey, peaceful place like this. it's off fashion ave, across from the DMV and it's so posh. (yeah i went very 1996). though a reservation is recommended we walked in tot he bar no problem and got set up to eat. my service was very unpretentious. The staff greeted us at the door, we didn't need a reservation and the decor was very modern, but not so hipster to the point where we wanted to leave. the service was fast. those who were tending to the kitchen were very ""in the mode"". their lead chef (dressed in all black) was cooking his tail fin off and it showed. ALL I ORDERED was pancakes and eggs. when i tell you this alone would make me visit NYC monthly if i could. I live smack dab in the stick and it's diners galore. this place was like diner encrusted with diamonds. perfect pancake. that's all you needmy best friend got the french toast, again the brown sugar butter needed to stop playing with me. she got a mimosa....and i got....a cup of coffeeFresh. New York. black,,,,coffee...I could have gone home after that. mission accomplished. but we stayed paid and enjoyed every minute of this establishment. please see my photos which included this outstanding coffee.",4,,1
7,Lynda C.,"New York, NY",0,48,0,3.0,11/12/2018,I had the braised short ribs and thought they were OK.  Nothing to wow about and nothing overly disappointing.  The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty nice though.  Service was decent.,,,
8,Kia A.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",1,203,1044,5.0,8/4/2018,"I went here on a Saturday to meet up with a friend for brunch. I can't believe I never noticed this place! It's has an ideal location being so close to Penn station and Herald Square. Interior: The place is a lot bigger than I thought it was. In the very front there are tables on each side of the entry. They have soft couch seats or regular chairs you can sit in. Then there are seats at the bar to eat at, as well as more tables in the rear of the restaurant. The bar is very long and it's fully stocked! They also seem to have a back room which can hold a good number of tables. Food: The food was so good! I ordered something that I had never had before because I didn't want to play it safe. I'm so glad that I did that. The meal was amazing!! I ordered the shakshuka with a side of spicy andouille sausage. The flavors were so rich and satisfying. The real winner of the meal was the shakshuka! I'm so happy I got it- warning there is raw egg in it so if that isn't your thing I'm sure you could ask them to cook it more (bastardize the recipe). My friend got the classic pancakes  with eggs. She said it was good as well. Service: The waiters were top notch! We started off with Don and then ended up with another guy. I didn't get his name but he's the one that will make you feel guilty for eating the unhealthy stuff. I liked that they didn't rush us to be finished while we were chatting and catching up over our meal. Also I eat hella slow so I'm glad they didn't make me feel awkward about it. Bathroom: It's a single use bathroom. Luckily I didn't have to wait long to use it- that can be really annoying and a turn off! Overall: I'll definitely come back here! I had a really good time.",2,,
9,Christina N.,"Clifton, NJ",186,101,399,4.0,4/10/2018,Was around the area so we decided to get something to eat and till & sprocket came up on yelp. Super cute place to take your significant other and also good for small groups.Entering in there are a couple of tables near the front and the bar expanded all the way towards the back attached with the kitchen. There was also seating all the way in the back of the restaurants where it's nice and private. Interior of the place was classy and sleek and so was the food. I order the t&s burger that came with a side of fries cooked at medium well and made to perfection! It was also a really thick burger. Almost too thick were i almost wasn't able to fit it in my mouth but I made it work. Haha. Yet so delicious and soo juicy! The fries were just as good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just how I like it! The servers were also really friendly and occasionally checked up on us and constantly refilled our water glasses.,3,,1
10,Jenn G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",414,34,4,4.0,11/10/2018,"If I was only reviewing my server she would get 6 stars! She was so funny and helpful. I came here for lunch to meet a friend who had to catch a train at penn station. Location is great in that regard, good vibes too and we didn't have to wait for a table at 1:30 PM. The food was really good but didn't knock my socks off, therefore, 4 stars. Coffee was wonderful though and prices are reasonable for the city!",,,
11,Kathy T.,"Monterey Park, CA",22,15,7,5.0,9/16/2018,Nice place for brunch at Midtown. My friend and I went for a chat. No waiting time to be seated.,1,,
12,Niki N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,60,44,4.0,5/18/2018,Unfortunately missed brunch so I ordered off the lunch menu - I had the chicken sandwich while my friend had the Argula salad. Both looked very good and tasted fantastic! The coffee was decent. I will definitely come back to try the brunch menu.,1,,
13,Mark R.,"Double Oak, TX",4,100,2,3.0,4/25/2018,"We needed a quick lunch and found this place just around the block from our hotel. Reviews seemed solid--passed my Yelp-algorithm--so in we went. Friendly atmosphere. Very gastropub-ish. We sat at the bar and both ordered the arugula salad with chicken. The salads came out quickly and looked good. The arugula was fresh, the chicken was nicely grilled (if not the tiniest bit dry) and overall, we enjoyed the salads.Here's the thing. When you're paying $20 for a arugula salad with chicken...it's hard not to get your expectations up--even when you're in midtown Manhattan. These salads were excellent $14 salads in terms of quality, freshness, taste and size. For $20, I wanted either more ingredients to jazz things up or more of what they gave us to make me feel like I got some value. Final tab (with 20% tip) for 2 arugula salads and 2 Cokes--$61.40. I guess that's Manhattan, but does it have to be? The atmosphere, service and the rest of the menu all make me want to go back and try it again, which I probably will. It has too much potential to let one kind-of-overpriced salad turn me away. It feels like a 4 star-worthy place, just can't go there on this review.",2,1,1
14,Tammy T.,"Manhattan, NY",178,94,162,3.0,5/3/2018,"Ambiance: lively and busy. Best to make reservation.Drinks: apple pie cocktail is deliciousFood:Tuna tartare is so-so. The fries are good.Squid ink pasta is ok, good amount of seafood.",2,,
15,Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,441,166,3.0,4/19/2018,"Came to Till & Sprocket for lunch. It is a good spot for lunch and not too crowded. The portobello mushroom sandwich is good. It is vegetarian and feels healthy because it is filled with veggies.The feel of the restaurant is like an upscale gastropub. Overall, a decent place for lunch.",1,,
16,Emily W.,"New York, NY",215,98,80,3.0,10/5/2017,"I made a reservation for Till and Sprocket on a Friday evening because I was worried that it would be really crowded, but the place was pretty empty. I really liked the decor and overall design of the restaurant, but the table my friend and I were seated at was kind of small, and it was difficult to get into the booth seat because the tables were all so close together.I'm a sucker for fruity drinks with silly names, so I ordered some cocktail that I think was called ""And With a Kiss I Die"". It was pretty expensive ($15) and came in a small glass, but it was decently strong so I didn't feel completely robbed. I ordered the burger with a single patty. I wasn't super impressed with the burger and the fries that came with it. The burger didn't taste bad or anything, but there was nothing special about it, and I definitely don't think it was worth $18. In addition, our waiter didn't ask how I wanted the meat cooked which I thought was a bit strange for a sit-down restaurant. The fries were really disappointing. They were these super thick wedges of barely golden potato, and there were like eight wedges in total. Overall, the food here tastes good but I think it's a bit over-priced, and you can definitely get much better food in NY for that amount of $$$!",1,,
17,Torie W.,"Queens, NY",235,251,545,5.0,9/14/2017,"A small foodie place with maybe 30 seats. Sit in the back with the skylight roof for either lunch or dinner and you'll be in awe. The wagyu ribs were amazing with polenta and au jus. The steak fries and chipotle mayo were crispy, and the mozzarella and red beets were the perfect vegetable/dairy mix.Service was great, but if you sit in the little alcove with the skylight it might be a bit slower.",2,1,1
18,Asha C.,"Westside / Home Park, Atlanta, GA",6,6,1,5.0,4/4/2018,"Went here for lunch yesterday while doing some shopping in the city. I loved that this place was so close to Penn Station, very easy to grab some food before going back to catch the train home. Or server was very friendly, when asked for recommendations she was very knowledgeable and I was very happy with what she ended up recommending: the T & S burger, it was so good!!! One person I was with had a sesame allergy, and she made sure to let the kitchen know to prevent any cross contamination which we really appreciated. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a quality place to eat",1,,
19,Ricky S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,7/27/2018,"Whoa!  Might be good one day if the owner gets lucky. I'm sure the goal was to rip off tourists. I felt sorry for the charming Carolina the waitress. She and the bar girl run the show. What could they do if the pizza isn't as good as a super market one. Horrible dough. The shock came with the bill. 4 of us over 215.00 in a BAR. $21.00 for a burrata appetizer the size of a .50 piece!That blew us away. And it wasn't served until the dinner came out!!! Extremely overpriced. Get a hamburger because they looked terrific. $16.00. Hanger steaks $32.00. No bread. Martinis served in cordial glasses. They don't even have the right glasses and only three choices of Vodka. For a bar?  Tito's, a cheap one from Iceland and one other. This place could be good if there was a proper and sane owner because the area needs a good place to eat.",,1,
20,Connie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1334,623,289,4.0,1/18/2018,"While this place doesn't have a ton of reviews, it is very solid and I would definitely recommend it for a group dinner.FOOD - Our table of six tried lots of things: medt. dips ($16), octopus ($21), tagliatelle ($18), squid ink pasta ($26), MSG pizza ($16). We absolutely loved tagliatelle, and my second fave was the MSG pizza.SPACE - Very clean and nice space. The layout of the restaurant is long and narrow, so you won't feel like you're too close to other tables.OTHER - Our waitress was super nice and awesome. When it came to paying, she allowed us to use six cards and instead of signing paper receipts it was all on their iPad which is great.If you're looking for a more low-key space in NYC to eat with friends, this place would be a good choice!",7,2,5
21,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2209,8239,3.0,5/26/2017,"The food is good.   Our server was very nice.  The space was weird.  There's the restaurant part, then past that there's a room with more tables, then even further back and around the corner, there looks like some kind of big, open event space that has a few tables in it.  That's where we were seated.  It was okay but there was no ambience or anything so it seemed like we were being seated in a warehouse.I had a Wiseman cocktail and that was very good.  The menu online had more items than the printed menu we had...I really think they should be consistent.   My friend wanted one of the pizzas she saw online (it had mushrooms and bacon on it).  But that wasn't on the printed menu.  She asked if it was possible to get it since there were other things on the menu that had the ingredients.  The waitress (who was really, really nice) said she'd check and then came back to say it couldn't be done.   Then my other friend asked someone who looked like the floor manager if we could just get that on the side and he said he'd check.  He was also very nice and when the pizza came out, there was a side dish of mushrooms and a side dish of pizza and my friends were able to assemble their pizza.On a positive note, the pizza was good and the mushrooms were delicious.  Also, my mini-meatball dish with grilled bread was really tasty.  I highly recommend it.  I guess the only thing that left me disappointed was the whole pizza topping thing.  Either update your website to match your actual menu or just throw some mushrooms on top of a pie.  Why would you offer pizza and not have the ability to put any toppings on it?  I have to think it was more work to get a plate and a small dish and spoon mushrooms into it than to just toss them on the pie.  Are pizzas with toppings absolutely forbidden a thing?  I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I can't imagine it's a good one.  Reading Mallory L's review, it seems she had issues getting a topping on a pizza too (maybe it has something to do with mushrooms)Aside from sitting in what felt like an empty warehouse and the unnecessary drama to get mushrooms on a pizza, I enjoyed the food and the service.",6,3,5

25,Mallory L.,"Oxnard, CA",130,495,1172,3.0,3/7/2017,"Wow, this place is expensive!!!!! I ordered a personal margarita (read: plain) pizza and added mushrooms. That was $16 because they charged me an extra 3 dollars for the mushrooms. Look at the picture! I had like 5 slices of mushrooms, likely from one whole mushroom. Highway robbery. On top of that, the dough wasn't strong enough to hold up the toppings! When I picked my pizza up, it bent in half! Complete disgrace. Not to mention the $10 side of potato wedges, which was just the one potato. Granted, they were good. But NOT WORTH $10!!!!The only thing I enjoyed was the cute window seat and customer service. Sorry, I won't be seeing either ever again.",2,2,

The place is cool, brick walls and a good vibe (and an interesting name!)Food/ Drink:Artisan Green Salad - very classy and tasty, but a bit small for 2 people to share. Love the apple slices, as well as the spiced nuts.Wagyu Beef - I enjoyed this, but it was a bit too rare for my boyfriend. Potatoes underneath the meat tasted great, but there weren't many of them.Meatballs with Grilled Country Bread - Meatballs aren't really my go-to, they were ok but I like my homemade ones better. The bread was a good texture, and there's a lot of extra marinara for dipping the bread. Frappato Wine: an interesting red, as it's served chilled. With all of the wines in the restaurant, you're given a sample to try before committing to a glass / bottle, which is much appreciated.",4,2,2

Rice bowl was tasty though quite oily; the avocado toast was one very small square of supermarket type bread with a kind of guac topping (as opposed to avocado slices etc). Very nice server though.

I thought I would have a hard time finding good brunch spots in the area but Till & Sprocket did not disappoint! It was a party of four and my two friends arrived early and were able to be seated before the whole party had arrived which was very accommodating. I started off with an iced coffee which was amazing. It was the perfect way to start off my meal after my trek to midtown. I was overheated and this definitely hit the spot! I ordered the French toast which came highly reviewed by our waitress so I knew I had to get it and I was not disappointed. The toast was airy and fluffy with accompanying syrup which was amazing. The syrup wasn't too thick or sweet and the balance with the French toast made it the perfect combination. Our waitress was very attentive and would always come by to refresh our glasses even though the place was packed. It was great service and food and will definitely have to come back again to try out the other brunch items.,,1,

35,Micah S.,"New York, NY",0,73,0,2.0,7/16/2018,Arrived early. Asked for table. None available. Asked for wait time. None. That was a first. Ever. So we sat at bar and ordered steaks-- lots of money. Expected a real steak. Got about 6 pieces of precut stringy hard to cut steak that was just ok for like 35 bucks. About 10 mins into bar escapade offered a table. Stayed at bar. Bar had no bar-- so nowhere to put feet. Uncomfortable. We paid way too much for a small steak salad-- which is what it should've been called and how it should've been priced. Food meh. Service meh. Not horrible but won't be back.,,,
36,Paul S.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",96,17,6,4.0,3/6/2018,"Just ate here for lunch and I was impressed. The food was delicious, the service was quick, and the servers were pleasant and very polite. I had the carrot and ginger soup as a starter and took the servers recommendation of the spaghetti and meatballs for the main course. I saw on some of the other reviews that the servings were small but I had more than enough and definitely was not hungry. If I was to suggest anything, I would serve a slice of bread with the soup and maybe even with the meatballs although to be fair, I asked the server if it came with bread and while he informed me that it didn't he did offer to bring some. It's a good option for a business lunch. A nice step up from the diner or pub lunch while not feeling too formal. I look forward to trying it again.",,,

I really enjoyed their lamb burger, and their fries are SOOO good! Brunch cocktail was yummy. Watercress salad with pesto was passable... a bit meh but then again, it's a salad.

41,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",67,162,86,2.0,5/7/2017,"Really unique cocktail menu, but falls flat on food and service.  Review mostly centered on food experience so will expand on the three dishes my friends and I shared - for starters, the best dish had to be the caponata, which was the eggplant spread.  I loved the taste of the tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar in it and the eggplant chunks were not too big.  Unfortunately, the country bread should have been lightly toasted.  I have to applaud the speed in which the food comes out, but I would rather have the cooks pay attention to details.  The warmth of the the toast and crunch would have provided a nice juxtaposition to the cold dish.  The octopus was under-seasoned, but cooked properly so that was great.  However, not too memorable either - the edible flowers were slightly bitter and added a nice floral accent to the dish, but did not contribute to the overall flavor profile of the dish.  The roasted marble potatoes were soft and cooked well, but not sure how it elevated or contributed to the dish as a whole.  Lastly, the least favorite dish of mine had to be the rock shrimp and polenta.  The polenta was creamy, but again, lacked flavor, including salt.  The polenta was also served cold.  I wasn't entirely sure if it was on purpose because it was served in a cast iron skillet while the shrimp was warm.  For the price of the dishes here and the ambience, I would not come back - many more other places in the city to explore.",,,

43,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,2.0,4/12/2016,They have so many MealPass orders!!!! The super crisp and fresh arugula leaves do not save the tasteless chicken or skimpy portion size.  I literally had to buy a bagel after eating the salad that allegedly costs $15 if ordered a la carte. It also doesn't make sense to put the cheese at the BOTTOM of a salad.,4,2,1
44,Michele G.,"Roswell, GA",1,34,3,3.0,8/16/2018,"Maybe we hit an off night but the service left a lot to be desired. Our waitress would disappear for the longest time and then return with one drink although all 3 in our party ordered. Never explained or apologized. Spent much of the evening with an empty water glass. Food was soso. Squid ink pasta was good. Greenley Square pizza was greasy and boring. Could be improved with some fig, tomato, pancetta or even olives. Disappointing",,,

Other places nearby were in full Thursday-night mode, loud and chock full of obnoxious. And then, Till and Sprocket; It's the hip without the hipster -- full of American-rival decor, classic cocktails (TS Lemonade is delightfully refreshing) and tempting aromas. We had seats in a back behind the kitchen. Everyone at our table enjoyed their cocktails and small plates of appetizers. Bar area is small and gets packed so get there early for happy hour.",1,,

That should have been my first indicator to leave.  I requested a minor substitution for my meal and was told that ""the chef does not like substitutions"" but she took my order anyway and never returned to say that it was an issue. However, a few moments later, I overheard the chef ranting  about 5 feet away from my table about the fact that I had requested an alternate cheese in my meal!  If I had been alone, I would have left immediately but since I was dining with others, I decided to make the best of the situation in spite of the outrageous behavior of the chef.  The service was horribly slow and when I paid my bill, I was shocked to see that they charged me an extra $7 for the alternate cheese choice and $5 extra for bread.  I will never return to this restaurant ever again!",,,

I had a delicious roasted turkey sandwich on fresh multi-grain bread. My mom had the farro salad. I never had farro before, but after tasting it I wish I'd ordered it myself.

49,Elisabeth H.,"Waban, Newton, MA",0,12,0,5.0,8/20/2018,"I stumbled into this place for an espresso while heading to my hotel from Penn Station. The following day I had brunch there with a friend: she loved her pancakes, I appreciated the kitchen's willingness to serve up some scrambled eggs with sauteed leeks, off the menu, and warm up my strawberry scone. That afternoon I returned with another friend and played scrabble while drinking fiery bloody maries, till five, when we ordered an extremely tasty dinner before I caught the train home. How often do you encounter a combination coffee house/bar/restaurant that's hip, casual, friendly, reasonably priced and delicious?

51,K E.,"New York, NY",0,282,1,2.0,1/28/2018,"This place is just awful and what is even worse, they are seemingly awful because they just don't care.Food is mediocre and the menu is a mess. Or example: You'll have a dish like a burger, which is mediocre (with terrible fries) but at least it makes sense. But then, in the same ""entree"" category on the menu, you'll have something like Avocado Toast, which is literally just that. A few dry pieces of avocado on one small soggy piece of toast - on a small little plate - for $12. Whoever thought they could get away with that should be slapped across the face.So the menu is heavily uneven so it's almost as if you have to be careful what you order because you might think you're getting an entree when actually it's basically a side dish (for the same price) and you're going to have to find a second lunch. And then since nothing is particularly good anyway, it begs the question - why the hell would anyone come here?",,,

It's quaint and popular so when we went it was pretty packed. Making a reservation ahead of time will make your life much easier. Now for the food. I ordered the breakfast pizza which was extremely good. It had bacon and two fried eggs on top of it and was just a really tasty meal. It was huge and could easily be shared. My boyfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes which he also liked a lot. They came with fruit on the side. For dessert, we asked to share a chocolate mousse tart. Here is where one star was taken from my review. We were told that the dessert cost $5.50. It was really good and we didn't regret ordering it. But when we got the check, they charged us $8 for it. We didn't want to start a fight over $2.50 so we paid it but that was a pretty deceptive move. You cannot tell your customers one price and then suddenly drop a higher one on them. And if that was your mistake then you, as the person selling it, should handle it. That disappointed me a lot as I was fully prepared to give this place 4-4.5 stars. Other than that, it was a good experience and we will probably return. Just be weary of what you order and don't forget to review your check!",,,

We had a bar to order from and a drink menu to order from, but the cocktails were made next door and it took forever to get the drinks once you've ordered. Also, the taller waitress had an attitude, it was not pleasant at all. To top it, while I enjoy the 2 cocktails I had, it is quite pricey. We weren't at the bar, it was a private event, this place should have a bar set in the private room for everyone's convenience and then give the members of the party a break on drinks. It took over 45 minutes to have our check delivered.

Was looking for a place between Fashion Institute and Penn Station and this fit the bill. There were four of us on a Tuesday night. Got seated in the back promptly. Decor is uninspiring. Can we even get real menus?? Menus were clipboards with copy paper clipped in. That was my first clue that I'd let my group down by picking this place. I actually wanted to leave. We ordered 6 of the Mediterranean dips which was decent and came with a plate of really good warm pitas to dip. Not enough pitas for the dip and they charged us $6 for extra which we did not know about until we got the bill. The pizza and burger were good portions, looked good and were enjoyed. The server said they were unable to add any sort of protein, such as chicken, to a salad. Wait, what??!! There were several salads on the menu so I really do not understand that. So if you want a salad entree, this is not your place. I had the scallops which was a small portion but I suppose the price of $18 reflected that, however, they were way too salty which ruined the fact that they were well cooked.",,,

There were hardly any choices on the menu. We ended up ordering a grilled cheese, an omelette and an egg breakfast. Not ideal but we were hungry. The food we ordered took so extraordinarily long that the grilled cheese plate was ice cold and had to be sent back to be remade. The $5 toast was cold and had to be sent back. The portions were tiny and not flavorful. We spent about $49 for about $3 worth of eggs, bread and cheese. It wasn't even particularly tasty.

They did just like that.  The bacon was good, the toast was just right(not too thick or too hard).

I will say I am always leery of places located around this area of town given that they seem to accommodate to a working group/tourists.The restaurant itself was very cute inside, little bench type seating with pillows which create an awkward inability to lean back, I hate that but it was comfortable and clean.Our waiter was very friendly and very helpful. I ordered a mojito, not on the menu and it was pretty good, it was probably a 7/10.My husband and I split one of the soups of the day, a chickpea and chorizo. Both of our ears perked up when we heard this but sadly, it was just okay. It unfortunately lacked seasoning and I really expected a more cream based soup than a broth. It was also quite pricy at $8 and I say that because the waiter was kind enough to split it up for us into two ramekins, so I think we got jipped.For my meal I had the Roasted Turkey Breast sandwich on sourdough with swiss cheese and herbed mayo. I found it to be very large, very delicious, and very filling. I asked for a mixed green salad in place of the beet salad that was their side for the day.My husband ordered the Chicken sandwich on a roll of some kind with ""avocado cream"" a.k.a. avocado. It was bland and pretty tasteless. I actually almost told the young lady sitting next to us to order something else since it was so lackluster but to each their own.Overall it was a pretty decent experience but nothing to write home about.",,,1

The owner had a serious problem with my colleagues and I using our laptops. It was around 10 am and the place was completely empty. The only reason we had to work there was because our office internet was out. He made a point of staring at us the entire meal. Not welcoming whatsoever. Great food though.,,,
76,Harold B.,"New York, NY",10,3,0,1.0,3/14/2018,"Food, service and ambiance were all fine even if unremarkable and uninspired.  The greens alongside our sandwiches were wilted and disgusting.  Prices are modest.  The biggest issue for us was that immediately after we paid our bill (i.e., after we left our tip of over 20%), someone came to our table to tell us that we had to leave because they needed the table for another reservation.  Mind you - this happened exactly 50 minutes after we had sat down at the table for our own reservation.  WTF!?  I was dining with a very high profile business leader (along with two other colleagues), so it was embarrassing to say the least.  After my lunch companions had left the restaurant, I went back in to complain.  The manager just smiled a fake smile and said, ""Sorry.""  Didn't offer any explanation, or express any sort of desire to make me feel better about the situation.",,,

She found Till & Sprocket and we were both pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is attractive; nice hip/cool vibe. (The bathrooms are really clean and the products smell awesome!)We order the Clams and Spicy Sausage with White Bean Puree and the Soy Glazed Ribs.  Both dishes were excellent. The flavor was spot on and the presentation lovely. (5 stars to the chefs.) We did not feel the plates were too small for the price. However, no sides are included and it's not advertised as ""small plates.""Service is where Till & Sprocket lost a star... our server was more than a bit off-putting. For example, when I asked for Pinot Grigio and she said they didn't have it, I ordered a seltzer. She quickly relied, ""So if there's no Pinot you order soda instead?""  My daughter ordered a Rose. When it was brought to the table I sampled it and decided to order one myself. The server came back with a glass of Rose for me and the seltzer. No biggie, but she still charged $4.50 for the soda. We walked out saying we would give this place another try. And then we discussed how we hope the owners review the feedback and realize that the front of the house can make or break all of their hard work.",,,
88,Edward G.,"Media, PA",1,7,2,2.0,12/20/2017,"You don't get a second chance to make a first impression, and boy did this place give us a bad one. My wife and I walked in at about 2pm on a Wednesday and stood there for a minute while several people who appeared to work there (one behind the bar, otherwise it was hard to tell) looked at us but did not acknowledge our presence. Finally my wife asked someone who was placing silverware whether someone would seat us. She seemed taken off guard by being spoken to by the nobodies that had just walked in, and suggested in an offhand way that we could just, like, sit wherever. This person turned out to be our server, though she never gave us her name. We really felt like we were there at the wrong time or something. She did eventually  take our order and brought our drinks. When thanked, she said ""yeah"", which struck us both as downright rude. Another time we thanked her she didn't even bother to speak,  instead just making an ""mmm"" sound. We were waiting a while for our food and noticed that it was just sitting on the counter behind us waiting to be picked up. Another employee overheard us saying ""is that our food? Just sitting there??"" and brought it over to us. We flagged the same person down shortly thereafter to let her know the cheese on my wife's grilled cheese sandwich was not melted. She had the kitchen fix the error promptly, but we never heard a word about it from our server, who it seemed was avoiding us. The food overall was ok but was so severely overshadowed by poor service that it is barely worth mentioning. Our server did at long last check on us and we were quite ready for the check, so we asked for it. We said to one another, ""this will probably take a while won't it"" and that proved to be the case. Yet another person, who we believed to be the bartender, noticed us and asked if we needed anything, and when we said ""just the check"", she managed to get our server's attention and told her what we needed. When we paid the bill we did discover that the name of the person who was supposedly helping us was Quinn, who had provided the most bizarrely inattentive and off-putting service we had ever received anywhere. Like we were just in the way and shouldn't interrupt her downtime or something.  The one upside was the ambiance-  really good lighting and decor. Check out the brick walled back room with the skylight, really very cool.  But not enough to make up for truly abysmal service.",,,

90,S M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,2.0,4/8/2016,"I don't usually write reviews but after a particularly bad experience at this restaurant I felt compelled to advise others to steer clear. As one previous reviewer said, don't let the trendy decor fool you into thinking the quality of the food matches that of their interior designers. To summarize:- Toast was burnt on the avocado dish- Soup arrived very late, had to remind them to bring it- Soup was overly seasoned and we sent it back - Second soup was bland- Brought the wrong empanda - a chicken one instead of the leek and I didn't notice until I bit into it. I'm a vegetarian.If any one of these things had happened, I wouldn't have cared. It was the combination of ALL of these things. Only giving two stars because the waitress seemed apologetic and comped the empanada but I've experienced better service. I will never go to this restaurant again.",1,,

This is an ideal date spot if you have to meet half way.I enjoyed a caesar salad, that was (as requested) lightly dressed. Our server noted that the kale in the salad is best enjoyed by massaging the green with a light olive oil. I appreciated her direction and refrained from ordering dressing on the side.  It was a lovely plate of greens, appropriately dressed to the specifications.  Anthony (owner?) was most accommodating with the wine tastings and suggestions.  Mozzarella salad was refreshing. I appreciate the portion sizes.  I think previous reviewers had expectations of a midtown Panera. In actuality, Till & Sprocket provides a fantastic alternative and new development for its under served location.",,,

At first I was nervous that they wouldn't have enough seating for the 5 of us at 1pm but don't be fooled by what you first see! We were led past the bar seating, past the back room to the back back room, which is reminiscent of a cafe setting with a few people sitting there working on their laptops. We were seated at a table and brought water and drinks right away. I ordered the burger, which was delicious! Other items my team ordered were the pizza of the day, BLT+E, turkey sandwich and salmon on mixed greens. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and the prices are very reasonable.

Both were perfect and extremely enjoyable. Beer was ice cold. The entire place, from the open-view kitchen to the rest rooms, was very clean. Service was attentive, pleasant, and friendly.

101,Claire M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,2.0,3/17/2017,"Very cool venue but the wait staff was either rude or clueless and the kitchen didn't know the menu nor did they adjust accurately for customer requests. Price of the food doesn't justify the experience.I came for a work lunch, this implies we don't have a lot of time. I arrived 8 minutes late to an empty restaurant and got lip from the host saying ""Oh I'm glad you decided to join us."" I got a three ingredient salad that was missing one of the ingredients and had cheese on it which I didn't want but didn't send it back. The salad is $20 with chicken, not worth it. I can get a salad with apple slices on it anywhere. Someone else at our table received their order incorrect and then had to wait 20 minutes to get a replacement meal. The whole table was done before they got their meal. There was no meal comp, just an oops from the server. Don't order the pizzas they were all dough with barely any toppings. Maybe this was an issue due the time of day we went, but doesn't bode well for a dinner.",,,

105,Rachel K.,"New York, NY",26,2,0,1.0,12/28/2017,Just terrible. Our table of 4 was seated in a charmless back room in full frontal view of restroom. Waitress took forever to take our order & other servers kept asking us how everything was even though there was no food in front of us. Arrived & seated at 11:15 am food did not arrive until 11:50 and several things were forgotten including one whole entree. Half of our party had to leave & server would not bring check. Manager offered to comp the late entree but we noticed $4 charge for a glass of seltzer & $8 for a kid chocolate milk. Waitress was annoyed when we pointed this out and her overall attitude was so rude. Bloody Mary's were awful & stomach still churning.  Terrible dining experience which is so regrettable when there are so many great dining options in NYC.  Am a native New Yorker live downtown & think part of the bad service & food was due to the fact that staff assumed we were tourists.,,,

From the minute I walked in to the minute I left, I enjoyed excellent service and food. The server ""Berta"" was great and super friendly. She didn't hover, and seemed happy to offer a good experience. Started with the deviled eggs, followed by the Thai Beef salad. Both were excellent!

Updated review","Since my first review I have been back a couple times. I went with a friend on a Friday night at 6:30 to get a glass of wine, and was disappointed to find that we needed a reservation... at 6:30 pm... for happy hour. The owner(?) was very friendly and apologetic. We went to a place next door for a glass of wine and ended up coming back over later. We were seated right away, enjoyed great service and food. I also went in a few days later during the day to make a phone call over a cup of chai. The back hallway is a perfect place to get some quiet in such a loud city (but don't tell all of your friends!).",,,1

A great Martini and great suggestions on red wine. Got the olives and the short ribs with polenta off the appetizer menu. Both great but I was still hungry and so I got the white pizza. Also awesome. Apparently I showed up right after the rush for a Billy Joel concert so I almost had the place to myself.

I knew it was a success when there were many choices on the menu we all liked.The food was great, I had a mixed green salad with hanger steak which was really good and everyone loved the truffle fries.

115,chau h.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,9,2,1.0,3/20/2016,Overpriced avocado toast with a paltry side of soggy side salad.  The ginger lemonade was basically watered down lemonade in a glass that was half ice.  The decor is hip for midtown which deceives customers into thinking this is a place with quality food.,,,
116,Ana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,14,0,5.0,10/8/2015,"My boyfriend and I were desperate to find a place to eat dinner after seeing a Broadway show, and we were convinced we were going to have to settle for some loud, terrible bar or way-too-expensive upscale place near Times Square.When we wandered into Till & Sprocket, we were thrilled. Affordable and delicious and away from some of the hubbub, this restaurant had everything we were looking for. Both the head chef and the manager came to greet us and let us know their plans to further develop the restaurant, but even as-is, the dinner menu and cocktails were fabulous. The food was fresh and filling at a reasonable price, and there were several great vegetarian options. We started with appetizers of roasted shishito peppers and maple sweet potato puree. For entrees, my boyfriend ordered a grain dish with blue cheese and I had the chicken arrabiata. All of the food was delicious, but I have to say, that sweet potato was beyond phenomenal.The ambiance was mellow and modern; the music didn't dominate the atmosphere, and because we went so late, it wasn't too crowded or noisy. The staff was incredibly friendly and even offered us a couple of free goodies because it was the end of the night.This restaurant is currently in its earlier stages of development, so be aware that it will only improve from here, but even in the meantime, this is a wonderful place to dine. I'll definitely be coming back after the next show I see!",2,,2

Awkward manager came up after we put a steak and chicken dinner in if my friend came straight from work? Where else did she drink?. Would not be a crazy question if she were belligerent. She wasn't. His further questioning was rude and unprofessional. We canceled the order in which manager said ""well I can give you half a glass of wine"". To a 30 year old that just ordered a steak on your menu. Cool, but we are good. All in all, for a city with so many restaurants, especially so close to penn station, go somewhere else so you're not judged by every move you make.",,,

They have tables for table service only in the back and tables where you can just grab a coffee and sit in the front. The music they play is really good (alt rock stuff).

Tonight I had the margherita with greens (swiss chard).   I love the arugula and fennel salad with freshly grilled to perfection sliced steak.   The staff is really friendly and helpful.   The decor is hip and clean.  If you are a larger group and want privacy, check out the back.  I may have my husband's birthday there!",,,
