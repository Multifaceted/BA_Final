Updated review","Actually used to come here often on a whim if I was hungry after class, but stopped coming for maybe a few months. My last visit here was about a week ago. Not sure if they changed their chefs but their ramens are tastier and less salty. I had the Tonkatsu Ramen and my boyfriend had the Shoyu ramen. They were both better than what we remembered. Their interior decor also upgraded too! Will be back to try the rest.",,,
1,Jocelyn D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,15,37,4.0,9/17/2018,"Cute little spot! There was a big group (about 10 ppl) and only one server working while I was there. You could tell things were a little hectic for her. Luckily we weren't in a rush, and didn't mind waiting for her attention. The ambiance: Cute place. Nicely decorated. The food: Pork gyoza - 7/10 - It was chewy and didn't have much flavor. wouldn't order again. Salmon Nudoshi- 8/10 - Noodle base with salmon teriyaki on top. Really liked the idea. The Salmon was flavorful, but the noodle bas was a little tough. Tan tan Ramen - 9/10 - Very nice cream flavor, and not too spicy. The noodles themselves were pretty average. Saporro - 10/10 - $3.50 for a pint during happy hour! Overall, we enjoyed it, and would def go back for the tan tan ramen and beer!",,,
2,Vishal P.,"Macungie, PA",184,415,34,4.0,7/29/2018,"I came here way back when the ""Ramen Burger"" was the new thing.It was interesting to say the least. The ramen ""bread"" was a little chewy but I guess it has to be otherwise it would fall apart. The whole thing tasted like a steamed bun. The Kewpie was a nice touch.I think the ramen burger was a one and done type of thing for me.",,,1
3,Christine S.,"Queens, NY",195,181,1556,4.0,1/18/2018,"Reasonably priced, satisfying bowl of ramen!Came here for early dinner on Wednesday with the beau. We figured the best way to thaw our bodies were with a nice, steamy bowl of ramen. So here we were, seated immediately and ordered the following:- Tan Tan 6 with wavy thick noodles ($12.75): This is their signature ramen, for a good reason. It wasn't too salty or oily, had the perfect amount of mild spice. It comes with bean sprouts, half a boiled egg with a runny yolk, ground beef, mushrooms, bamboo shoots and garlic. If you're indecisive about what ramen to get, just go with this one!- Miso Ramen with wavy thick noodles ($9.95): Love how the meat is tender and pairs perfectly well with the broth. The toppings are the same as the Tan Tan 6 except this one comes with corn, cabbages and a slice of pork belly. If you like miso, try this one out.- Takoyaki ($5.25): Comes with five gigantic balls #thatswhatshesaid with a good amount of diced octopus inside. It's sprinkled with tempura scraps, green onions, drizzled with a generous amount of mayo based sauce and takoyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce). So filling, so deelish, can't beat the price for this one.- Sweet Karaage Chicken ($5.25): Crispy chicken pieces drenched in honey orange sauce. There were about six pieces, laid out with a slice of lemon on the side. You can definitely recreate this at home, nothing special. I wasn't crazy about this one, will probably pass next time.Overall, the ramen bowls we ordered were deelish and did not disappoint. Their broth and flavoring were on point--not too salty, thick or oily. They're generous with the amount of noodles and toppings that they put in there. Also, their appetizer options are standard, but be mindful of the amount of food you can fit in your stomach with a ginormous bowl of ramen. As always, we thought with our stomachs and over ordered. Ended up waddling out, crashed on the bed afterwards and stared blankly at the ceiling cause #foodcoma. Btw, it's a bonus that they're fairly spacious inside given that it's in St. Marks. Service was great but we were the only ones in there for a while so it wasn't hard getting the lone server's attention if anything. Oh, and little side note. The restroom has a mouthwash with tiny plastic cups to get rid of that stinky ramen breath. Perfect for a post meal make out sessssh with your partner, that's if you make it home without knocking out afterwards cause #foodcoma. Anyways, I'd love to come back to try some of their other ramen bowls next time!",8,3,3
4,Catherina L.,"New York, NY",664,95,195,5.0,5/18/2018,HIDDEN GEM of a ramen spot. I usually get takeout from here and the wait staff is always so nice. They sometimes give you free gyoza if you ask nicely :) my favorites are the dancing spicy ramen and tan tan ramen. Their gyoza is also really good! Karage is ok,,,
5,Michael C.,"New York, NY",234,15,93,4.0,8/2/2018,Sweet local go-to for consistent quick bowl of Dan Dan ramen.  Pork belly is an amazing addition we always add to our Dan Dan ramen bowl....,,,
6,Donald K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",57,9,41,5.0,1/30/2018,"This isn't one of your commonly noisy and busy ramen joint which is one of the reasons I prefer to place then most other ramen joints.  The place seats about 20 people and it's allows people to hold conversation.  When looking at the menu, the place offers few selections both ramen, udon and soba noodles.  They offer the common Miso pork broth and shoyu base ramen and some store creation.  I decided to order the red evil my company went to order the spider ramen and for sides we ordered the grilled Matsu.The grilled Matsu (grilled beef intestines) were to die for.  The dish came in a small iron skillet sizzling through.  The first bite into the intestines, my mouth was in heaven.  The miso mixed with the chili brings out the beefy flavor in the intestines.  The chewy meat was grilled on the side giving certain pieces a crispy chewy consistency.  Those pieces are the gem.  Let it grill on skillet longer for this effect.The spider ramen was a soft shell crab ramen.  The crab was fried with a tempura batter and place right in the middle of the ramen.  The both was savory with some seafood saltiness.  The noodles were thin ramen noodles but the generic noodles.  The side shell crab was crispy outside but soft and gooey in the inside.  Overall the noodle was salty but packs a punch in seafood flavor.  Try to take out the crab if you prefer the crab to be crispy.  Worth a try if you are into soft shell crab.The red evil it the store's take on Szechuan hot pot with noodles.  The bowl of noodles came in a clay pot that keep the whole dish hot throughout my meal.  The Szechuan peppers and hot oil paste was the soup base. It was accompanied with noodles bed intestines and cabbage.  The beef intestines were soft and soaked up all the flavor of the broth.  Cabbage was crispy and the noodles were chewy.  The broth was more numbing then spicy but overall very salty.  Decent dish if your into the szechuan flavors.  A little too salty for my taste.Overall I gave this place 5 stars because of the grilled Matsu and atmosphere.  Noodles are 4 stars to me.",2,,2
7,Nez B.,"Manhattan, NY",271,239,368,4.0,6/22/2017,"Great deals on traditional japanese ramen dishes for $9.95. I got a miso ramen with medium noodles for $10 and a takoyaki for $6. You get to choose from 3 types of noodles for your ramen which is pretty nice. A very good meal for under $20 and Fairly close to Japanese taste, delicious.Plentiful seating and spacing so not crammed in like the other Asian restaurants on St. Marks, and the servers were very pleasant and greeted every customer with a welcome and a smile as they walked in. Kudos for that. Definitely will return",3,1,1
8,David C.,"New York, NY",45,160,118,4.0,8/26/2017,"Good cheap eatsAre a ramen burger here and it was pretty good.  Def not the best by far.  The best I had was at a smorgasbord in Williamsburg and I haven't been able to find anything close to that.Beer is very cheap here as well.Overall the place is very small but satisfying,  I would come here again",,,
9,Bianca S.,"Morganville, NJ",429,4,0,5.0,9/24/2018,"This is probably my favorite ramen spot at the moment. I'm all about thick noodles so this place hits the jackpot because you get the option of choosing how thick or thin you want your noodles. Spider ramen with the soft shell crabs soaked on the side of the ramen is to die for! Broth is thick and flavorful, and the softshell crab is crunchy on the outside but melts in your mouth once you bite into it. The service was amazing as well. I accidentally forgot to mention that I wanted extra thick noodles, so when the ramen arrived, I got regular thin noodles. I asked if it was possible to switch the ramen for thick noodles, and the waitress graciously obliged. Service and portions are generous - I highly recommend this place.",,,
10,Claire M.,"Mountain Lakes, NJ",51,7,0,5.0,9/19/2018,"Best ramen I have ever had! My parents and I had dinner there tonight. It's a very simple restaurant and not over the top. I will most definitely be returning! If you're looking for ramen, this is the place to go.",,,
11,Austin O.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",258,145,178,4.0,4/30/2017,"3.5 stars. Was headed down the street to a competing Japanese restaurant when we noticed the sign out front advertising an Anniversary Sale promotion taking half (50%) off certain Udon dishes. Upon learning the competitor had a long wait, we headed to Zen 6 and are happy we did. We ordered pork buns to start, which were tasty and well executed, although pretty consistent with the tried-and-true glazed pork belly and steamed bun trend in NYC.I got the honeycomb tripe and beef udon, which came with a lighter broth that was not quite as flavorful as I would have expected. The meat, which was brisket-like, was so fatty and delicious that I quickly forgot about the broth - definitely the highlight of the meal. The udon noodles themselves were lighter and not as dense/chewy as I'm accustomed to - I don't know whether that makes them more or less authentic.Service was attentive, although one of our appetizers of fried chicken was forgotten (which worked out well because we were so full). The interior was quiet and cozy. They offer a 10% discount if paying in cash. The menu was cute and they had a couple little promotional gimmicks.Overall, a solid option if you're in the area but not necessarily a destination.",3,,
12,Jackie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,42,80,4.0,11/26/2017,"This place has tons of options which is great for someone who loves variety. I tried their seasonal ""Snow White Ramen Special"" and was pleasantly surprised by how well the Parmesan cheese complimented the soup base. It was really good and not overbearing in cheese flavor at all. Would recommend it for anyone looking to try something new and tasty. The chicken was also freshly fried and was piping hot when it arrived to the table. I was expecting it to come with an egg/potato salad or mayo dressing rather than just lemons, but it tasted delicious so I'm not too upset about it. Finally the takoyaki balls were delicious! But also piping hot. I would recommend taking a bite out of the ball first before popping the whole thing in your mouth like I did (it'll save you from burn injuries). Overall, I'd definitely come back! There's more items on the menu I'd like to try next time.Staff was super friendly and attentive too! Thank you for such a wonderful experience! :)",1,,
13,Greg C.,"Atlanta, GA",356,94,153,4.0,1/27/2017,"The highlight of Zen6 was their awesome service and pork steam buns. First off, if you check-in you get a yakult-like drink which is delicious. My favorite part was their pork buns. Not only do their pork buns contain the most amount of meat I've had in a pork bun, but it is also extremely tender and falls apart in your mouth as you eat it. For the ramen I got their spicy dancing ramen. This was probably the largest portion size of ramen that I've had in NYC. That being said, it was not the most flavorful ramen, however, is was extremely satisfying for me after a long day of classes where I was just looking for a large amount of Japanese comfort food. Make sure to bring cash for a 10% discount.",5,1,2
14,Susan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,76,4,4.0,5/4/2018,"This is the closest I've gotten to ramen I've had in Japan and I'm very pleasantly surprised-- I didn't think it was possible and had half given up hope. Their Hakata Tonkatsu ramen is legit. A bit on the fatty side which is to be expected with pork broth but not too heavy. It would be nice to have a bit of spice to cut it down a bit but I wouldn't recommended adding theirs, it had too many pepper flakes that didn't do much but take away from their tasty broth. Their char siu was a bit dry and tough for me, my husband apparently got a tastier piece but not a big deal. Will definitely be back for that ramen and now excited to try their different items for any more authentic finds.",,,
15,Annie L.,"New York, NY",282,129,15,4.0,9/17/2017,"Really good ramen spot with a wide selection of food items - they have different types of ramen, and also udon, cold/dry noodles, and all your classic Japanese appetizers (gyoza, etc.). I ended up going with the popular Tan Tan Noodles, which were fantastic, with wavy noodles. First, the portion is quite hefty! There is no shortage of noodles, which you always fear with the more popular, high-traffic (and overrated!) ramen restaurants. Then, it also came with a variety of different toppings. And then to my pleasant surprise, it ended up being 50% off in celebration of the dish's 5th year anniversary - an awesome $6.95 total! The broth was quite thick - not something you'd want to finish in its entirety, but it had the right amount of spicy kick. They also have this yuzu hot sauce that's really unique for a nice little side flavoring. Recommend checking this place out, all you ramen fans!",1,1,
16,Bree R.,"Manhattan, NY",112,118,40,4.0,10/10/2017,"Awesome spot! I had a great experience here with a few friends. I ordered the crab fried rice and the mushroom buns. Both items were delicious. The rice needed a tad more flavor but nothing some soy sauce couldn't fix! The portions were generous and we left very full. Service was friendly and the vibes were chill. I think there could've been a little more care on the cleanliness, but it wasn't the biggest deal! The place wasn't as small as it seemed on the outside and it wasn't packed when we sat down so we were all able to chat without having to shout. All in all, we had a great experience. @eyeofshe",,1,
17,Corinne K.,"New York, NY",487,125,314,5.0,11/22/2016,"You know a place is good when I go there 2 days in a row and am actually contemplating making it a 3-day-in-a-row affair. Yes, Zen 6 is actually THAT good. Now, I've had my fair share of ramen over the years, but nothing comes close to the Dancing Spicy Ramen that I've had here. Most places don't offer fried calamari in their ramen let alone do they do it well, so that in and of itself skyrockets Zen 6 to the top of my ramen list. Plus, you also still get pork and that b2b is just kind of hard to beat. We've also tried their Sweet Chicken Kara-Age and trust me, it's just as good as their ramen. Crispy, Japanese fried chicken goodness with a sweet and tangy dipping sauce. Does it get any better than that? The people here are also ridiculously sweet and I'm not just saying that because they give me and my boyfriend free gyoza tickets for next time every time we visit. Like no joke, my water never goes below the halfway mark because their need to keep me hydrated (what with all that spiciness in my ramen, of course) is Level 10000000. Coupled with the fact that the delish ramen comes super quickly, it's no wonder that Zen 6 is easily my favorite ramen spot in the city.",9,1,4
18,Ronald L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,9,4,5.0,8/6/2018,This is a small-ish shop between avenues that is our go-to delivery/pick-up for whenever we are craving ramen in alphabet city/east village but trying to stay in. We love their Dancing Spicy Ramen as it always has the best flavor-both the broth and calamari are always tasty and complement each other well. The food is always prepared fast and ready to pick up within 5-10 minutes with extremely nice ladies. They have a limited time promotion of 50% off their signature ramen that I am hoping to try soon!,,,
19,D M.,"Bogota, NJ",57,192,40,3.0,7/17/2017,"Came late on a Sunday.Closed the place out, our server was sweet enough not to rush us out.Happy with our experience here. It's not special in any way but we were happy with our meal.Might be back because it's conveniently located but probably wouldn't go out of my way.",2,1,2
20,Canny F.,"Knoxville, TN",666,1589,7123,4.0,12/17/2016,"I love this place. They have so many options! I came here for a dinner date and we had the spicy ramen and seafood ramen. I liked his spicy ramen more than my seafood ramen; the seafood ramen was bland but his spicy ramen broth hit the spot. We also ordered the vegetable gyoza but this was not exciting. If you check in on yelp, you get a free drink. The staff also great and attentive. They also have a punch card for freebies after a certain amount of purchases so I highly suggest that if you are nearby.",4,,1
21,Anthony R.,"New York, NY",114,19,16,4.0,8/29/2017,The Tan Tan was great ! Broth very flavorful ! Very friendly service ! This dish is $6 at lunch right now,1,,
22,Alina V.,"New York, NY",237,246,591,3.0,7/18/2017,"Came here with a friend to try the ramen burgers. It was good, but definitely more on the greasy side which I didn't enjoy so much. The burger came with chips and salsa on the side which was a nice touch but I don't know if I would come back for the burger again. I would definitely be interested in coming back to try some of their ramen soups.",2,,1
23,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,10/10/2016,"It was 10:30pm on a Saturday and I needed ramen, but time had gotten away from me and the place I had been planning on going to was closed. My dining partner looked up and said, ""Well, there's a ramen place across the street, you in?"" My initial reaction was to argue that we couldn't possibly just go to a random place without consulting the almighty Yelp first. What did he think I was, desperate? But I remembered the hour and acquiesced, because yes, I was. We came in half an hour before closing and ordered the meat gyoza, the kara-age (deep fried chicken with the sweet sauce option), the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen with the Gekikara Sin (extra spiciness, basically), and the Sukiyaki Beef Udon. Our entrees came out with our appetizers, a pet peeve of mine but I understood that they were closing soon so I tried to be understanding. Half of the gyoza were overdone to the point of being a little burnt in places, but they were still very very good, and the slightly spicy sauce they came with was delicious. The kara-age was tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, in a sauce that was very much like sweet chile. My Tonkotsu with the Gekikara Sin was good. Not the greatest ramen I've ever had, but filling and warming and it satisfied the craving. I thought the broth could have used more fat, unless it's clogging my arteries there's not enough for this little lady. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Sukiyaki Beef Udon. I'm not a fan of tripe, but this was the best I've had yet. The broth was what got me excited though, it actually tasted a little smoky, and when mixed with my spicy broth it was off the charts. I would definitely get this again.The bathroom is cute, with mouthwash, toothpicks, floss and hand lotion to help yourself to. My only real complaint was the rushed service. I understand that you're closing soon, on top of bringing everything we ordered out at once, the waitress also interrupted our meal to give us our check while were still eating so she could close out and leave. There's a polite way to do that, you don't mention you're doing it so you can go home, you can just ask us if we need anything else before the kitchen was closing but clearly that wasn't an option anyway. The cleaning process began while we were still seated, staff were even putting stools on top of tables as we wrapped up. I work in the service industry, I get wanting to go home, but that's not really how I like to enjoy a meal. I will be back, but I won't come so close to closing.Edit to add 1/17: This has become one of my favorite delivery options! Ask for a side of seaweed with your ramen, it's delicious. Also the side of curry rice with pickles tastes like straight up Indian food, a great way to mix it up if you have someone in your group who can't decide what you want. The ramen burger is spot on even though it's not my favorite item anywhere.Their miso ramen is also the only miso I've ever liked, their Spicy Dragon Chasiu Men is delicious (although I think their pork could be more tender), but I've really come to love their Tan Tan 6 ramen. It comes with fried garlic- this is the garlickiest garlic that has ever cloved, I promise you. Your kisses will be toxic- have no shame!Edited to add 1/18: Ordered the Sui Gyoza appetizer by mistake and it was nice! Tender dumplings in a murky, slightly smoky broth. A little rich, but not too rich, nice on a cold night!",7,1,2
24,Hillary N.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,87,289,4.0,12/18/2016,"Came here for a friend birthday, the restaurant is pretty small, probably 20-25 seats. Make sure to make a reservation for a large group.The price is reasonable compare to other popular ramen joints and a decent amount of portion. I ordered the Tan Tan 6 Ramen (you can choose your type of noodles) and as a group, we shared all 3 kara-age, takoyaki, and Grilled Motsu. Tan Tan 6: with spicy ground meat, bean sprouts, fried garlic and boiled egg. Loved it! It was delicious with the right amount of seasoning. Great for a raining cold day. For all the 3 type of kara-age (Fried chicken): I didn't care for it much, just typical deep fried chicken. Grilled Motsu (Small intestine of a cow with spicy miso): Delightful!",3,,1
25,Rianto B.,"Oceanside, CA",43,29,8,1.0,1/28/2018,"4 of us went there for late food, Food was great but service tonite was horrible. Spilled water on my bag and on my friend's phone and there was no sense of apology. And tonite they didnt include 20 percent gratuity because of that incident like they normaly would.It s the first ramen shop that charges 20 percent gratuity for the party of 4 automatically yet the service cant even keep up. And there is a big difference between ""taking orders"" and ""giving service"".A piece of advice, hire someone who really knows how to do the job. The rest of the waitress was great.",2,,
26,Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",291,999,706,4.0,9/18/2016,No wait on a Friday night and fast service. I got the tan tan w/thin noodles- pretty good- broth was flavorful! For the price $11-12 I think it was pretty good quality and a decent amount of ingredients. They had beers for $5 as well. They also advertised the ramen burger but I didn't think it looked that good. If you're looking for a no-wait place to eat/drink near st.marks I recommend this place. Originally we were going to go to this place called the tang but the line was too LONG and this place had virtually no wait. Friendly service and there is a discount if you pay in CASH.,9,1,3
27,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,5.0,8/12/2016,"I've been on a Ramen kick lately. Yesterday I went to Ivan's Slurp Shop up in Hell's Kitchen, today I decided to try out Zen 6 down here in Saint Mark's.They offer the Ramen burger here. However, I'm just not the kind to go for gimmicks, especially not American inspired ones. That, and its just not true ramen without a hot, savory soup that makes you sweat bullets but its so good that you continue drinking it LOL.I went with the classic Tonkotsu Ramen. I also had an extra whole egg and chicken added to my bowl. The Tonkotsu soup here is very rich, and has this creamy, silky quality to it. Definitely A+. The noodles cooked just a little past al dente, but also not overdone. The egg was soft boiled just right, where the middle of the yolk was still runny, and the chicken ohh soo savory!!",10,2,8
28,Sophia C.,"New York, NY",7,17,60,5.0,7/16/2017,Get the devil ramen!!! It tastes like detox broth and comes with a ton of cilantro which I love. I could live off cilantro lol.

29,Nilsa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,276,287,4.0,5/24/2017,"Not a lot of places allow ramen to go because they want to ensure the quality of the noodles. I understand the need to uphold the quality of their food, but sometimes, you just want to take your food to go! Zen 6 is a place that lets you take your noodles to go and don't sacrifice too much on flavor and quality. I was surprised the tonkotsu ramen was less than $10, making it under $11 with tax included. My to-go order had the broth separated from the noodle, so it didn't become a soggy mess. The only drawback with to-go orders is that you don't get to take advantage of the lunch special. I actually do want to try the soft shell crab and the other variations of ramen they have. A good place to have your ramen fix without the crowd and over-spending.",3,,1
30,Taylor M.,"Princeton, NJ",227,28,4,2.0,6/23/2018,"I was pleasantly surprised when our food arrived earlier than expected, but I was not wildly impressed by the food. The ramen was fine, nothing special, and the food that I received was not the ramen bowl I had ordered. The unagi don was good. I was disappointed that the hoisin sauce smelled like it included peanuts, but that wasn't specified. I know it is sometimes made with peanuts but typically is made with soy bean paste, so my friend with an allergy could not eat them. No strong feelings that will make me order from there again.",1,,

Updated review","I came back here the other day after many years of not coming back, and I was not disappointed. I came here for the lunch special and ordered the tan tan ramen with fried calamari on the side. Everything is included, plus a salad! The ramen was very hearty and plentiful, I was full afterwards. The fried calamari was a decent portion as a side dish and was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, plus a lemon on the side. Definitely recommend coming here for the lunch special since it's only $12-15 with tips and tax included! Also, check in for a free calpico.",1,,

33,Candi D.,"New York, NY",118,19,34,2.0,1/7/2018,"The people who took order and delivery person were all very nice. That said, the meal was VERY bland. I ordered the tan-tan ramen, the crab fried rice, and the karaage chicken, and here is what i think on each:1) I usually love tan-tan ramen, and I was looking forward to this dish. It was big, and plentiful but the ramen was VERY overcooked; the whole dish was sadly off - I would def NOT recommend this one if you love good ramen. But if you just want soup with some stuff in it, you will be ok as the broth was not bad.2) the crab fried rice was again, just ok. There was a lot of crab, so they didn't skimp, but the flavor was not there :( 3) How can you mess us karaage chicken -- well how about the whole thing was just oily, and someone forgot to salt the chicken. It was tender and soft -- so that's a plus.Also they forgot to include the extra spinach and napa cabbage that i ordered; they did include limp, boiled green cabbage (which i have never had in ramen dish) ...usually it is bok choy. I really wanted to like the food based on the other reviews, but I needed to write this so that hopefully they will improve some of these dishes!",1,,

39,Esmeralda C.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",73,344,3787,4.0,5/23/2016,"Checked this ramen spot out as my friend and I were famished and wanted to have something filling yet different from the norm.  We decided on this place, she had the veggie dumplings and shrimp buns and I had the mushroom ramen soup.  The food was spot on! The ramen soup was delicious and had five different mushrooms with such a great broth, I could have had that alone, it was so good.  My friend raved about the shrimp buns and said she'll go back just for that.The space is small yet clean and the staff is very attentive.  To my surprise they offer some cool amenities in the bathroom, like floss, toothpicks, mouthwash etc. You don't typically find this in any type of restaurant unless it has an attended providing you with a napkin to dry your hands with.  Overall cool spot. The only problem I found was that it was cash only and didn't see a sign outside indicating that.",8,,2

Really glad I found this spot and dragged my boyfriend here on multiple occasions along with friends. Fits right into our college kid budget haha. Really chill place to just relax and have ramen, plus the workers are very friendly",2,1,1
41,Monica L.,"Manhattan, NY",26,165,264,3.0,5/10/2017,"Delivered their signature ramen, which was good.Loved the packaging, broth on one side and the rest of ingredients and ramen on the other.The only thing is that they put too much msg, felt very thirsty whole night",1,2,1
42,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,4.0,4/11/2016,"I was craving something warm for a late dinner so I made a reservations here via Yelp because I was worried there would be a long wait. Turns out, since we didn't make it for dinner until 9:30PM, this wasn't a problem at all! We were the only two individuals in the restaurant for the entire time we were there.I went with the Tan Tan 6 (their signature ramen) and my friend ordered the Snow White. The Snow White is so called because of the Parmesan cheese that they sprinkle on top of the noodles..which I guess looks a little like snow? Otherwise, I think it's a pretty standard bowl of ramen. I tried a bit of it, and wasn't super impressed. I thought mine was way more delicious!! If you've ever had the Taiwanese dan zai mian and enjoy it, you will most likely enjoy the Tan Tan 6 as well. It is similar in that instead of a whole piece of pork belly, it is topped with slow cooked ground pork. The broth was hearty and had a nice kick to it, which really helped warm up my belly on a chilly day!We also ordered a bottle of sake, which actually came cold, but they were nice enough to offer to pop it in the microwave for a few second though. The current check-in deal is a mini calpico soft drink, which isn't as appealing as some of their past check-in deals, but still a nice gesture. Overall, Zen 6 is one of the better ramen places that I've been to in the city, and I wouldn't mind heading back, especially since the dining environment is much more pleasant than some of the overhyped locations.",8,2,5

I've had the beef short rib udon and the spicy chicken ramen here and it was okay, but not thaaaat good. I only like eating out when the food is better than something I could make myself, and this place unfortunately did not make the cut. Still not a bad place and the customer service was not bad.",,,1
45,Anna C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",37,11,3,5.0,5/20/2018,"Ive actually been here a couple times but I was a lot younger so this recent experience is all I really remember.Anyway was out with my boyfriend looking for ramen places, as the one we wanted to go to stops serving food from 2:30pm-5:00pm(dumb). Went to this place as a recommendation from my sister.Got here and they were still doing their lunch special which i think they do from 11-3:30pm. It was empty, as there was no one there except me and my boyfriend, but the waitstaff was nice and it seemed that they mostly just got deliveries around this time.Its probably one of the best deals for ramen in the city ! For the price of the ramen, which is also very reasonably priced at a little over $10, you get a small side salad and a side. There are a quite a lot of sides to choose from; Chinese pork bun, takoyaki, kaarage(flavors including: regular, curry, etc), and some other stuff. My boyfriend and I got regular kaarage and a Chinese pork bun.The side salad was definitely very small. It could be finished in 1-3 bites. It was a simple salad with 1-2 teeny slices of tomato, a vinegarette, and some chopped peanuts on top. While small, it was super tasty and a very nice way to start a meal. The sides we ordered were delicious. The kaarage came with 3 pieces and a slice of lemon. It was freshly fried and very hot. The Chinese pork bun came in a steamed bun wrap, with a big slab of bbq pork, lettuce, and some spicy mayo inside it. The ramens we ordered were the tantan6(?) and the miso ramen. They were a good size and also very tasty. I was so full by the end of it that I didnt drink the broth !! All and all this place is a gem if you want something quick, filling, and best of all CHEAP !!!",1,,
46,Kimmi D.,"New York, NY",526,295,91,4.0,1/24/2017,"A small ramen joint in the heart of East Village with nice wait staff and a cozy experience. It was my first time trying a ramen burger and I didn't really know what to expect. It was smaller than I'd thought, but the patty was juicy and the entire burger tasted well together. I've also tried their shoyu and hakata ramen on two separate occasions. I think I like the hakata better but it also depends on your broth preference. I do like the fact that you can choose your types of noodles here. For an extra $1, you can make any ramen spicy. I got this for one of my visits and I felt like the spices and oils overpowered the taste of the broth of the ramen. So I wouldn't recommend this, or if you can, ask for it on the side and add as much as you want. There's never a wait here even for dinner! They also deliver so huge +++ for those who are too lazy to go out.",4,,1

I had a wonderful time at Zen6, and want to go back and try more of the menu ---like a big bowl of ramen soup. We tried a few small things to share the steamed buns come with 2. And had a good balance of flavor. With the shiitake I did not miss any meat. Tako-Yaki octopus balls were delicious with a nice umami flavor. The ramen burger was not really share friendly, and small enough for one person to try and have an app. It was a little greasy, but come on... That's what you expect/want in a burger right?!",4,,
48,Faye Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",678,272,513,4.0,1/22/2016,"Yummy ramen with excellent service in a small japanese restaurant. The place is casual and good for intimate meet ups, not advisable with a large group. I'm not a huge fan of Japanese ramen because I find it to be too salty, but their miso ramen is actually pretty good. Their broth was flavorful but not too overwhelmingly so. The meat and the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the noodles were chewy. I also tried their crab fried rice which was pretty standard. Check in for a free calpico, which they gave me a small one that looked like a yogurt drink with a straw. I looked like a five year old kid drinking it but hey its all good :)",6,1,1

You get a bowl of ramen with a side of advocado salad,  and choice of a side dish.My girlfriend got the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen with side of Sweet Kara-age. I got the Tan Tan 6 with a side of Meat Gyoza.The advocado salad came out first and it was very refreshing with a nice vinaigrette dressing. The Sweet Kara-age was sweet and a nice taste.The Meat Gyoza was crispy on the outside and had a nice bite to it. My girlfriends Hakata Tonkotsu was delicious. I like the smooth silky broth that goes with it. Nice flavors in this bowl of ramen. I think I will order this to myself next time. My Tan Tan 6 was flavorful. There was a lot of ingredients in here, which is always a plus. The broth had a good spice kick to it. On a cold day, it is good ramen soup to have. We also got one Ramen Burger each to ourselves. I think Zen 6 makes the best Ramen Burgers. The burger is cooked pink. I like the crispness from the lettuce and the tomatoes. The sauce is amazing on this burger. Great place to come for lunch. Lunch specials makes the bill very affordable and cheap.Check in to get your free Calpico drink.",6,1,2

Also ramen burger was something that I am raving for a long long time...guess today is the time to nail down both!The tan tan 6 was actually not as good as I expected and I didn't find any roasted garlic in my ramen bowl; the noodle was also a bit hard to chew...surprisingly I loved my ramen burger and it turned out to be less dry as I have heated.

It was my first experience of ramen burger, and if what I had last night was how ramen burger tastes like, then last night's experience would be my last. It was something that I could basically do it myself: half a bag of instant noodles, put a small slice of beef, one piece of cabbage and one piece of carrot, and that's it. Really nothing special. If you do go to Zen 6, get a bowl of ramen noodles instead of ramen burger. If you love spicy food, try their Red Evil ramen: big bowl and very good for its price.",,,
54,Kevin L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",221,31,5,3.0,4/30/2018,"Nice little shop that has great decorations. I came here on a Friday night around 8pm and it was surprisingly not busy. We sat down and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and their signature ramen. For me, the tonkotsu ramen definitely had the texture and richness but it was severely lacking in flavor. My friends who had the signature ramen felt a similar way. The food quantity was on the smaller sides of things but given that a bowl of ramen averaged $10-$14 there, it was definitely on the cheaper side of ramen. Being unsatisfied by the ramen, I also ordered the mini beef don which was a little too sweet for my liking but not bad overall.",,,
55,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1672,521,984,3.0,9/6/2017,"Friendly, ramen fusion. I had the ""red evil"" or something closely related. The beef intestine were among the fattiest most tender, plentiful pieces I've ever had. Along with the parsley, egg, bean and pepper splats and cabbage, it was a circus of Chinese flavors with chewy ramen noodles. The broth was a bit heavy and salty with big beef flavor in a cauldron sized pot- definitely different and best budget-boutique ramen I've had- if there were such a thing. I would order this again. Their yuzu pepper sauce was lovely and went well with anything. Their kimchee was basic and fell apart within the hour. I didn't get to try their gyozas nor pork buns but it was nice that they were offered. In addition to 6-10 specialty ramen bowls that included soft-shell crab, calamari, and ground beef with garlic chips, there were mushroom paitan and dry/cold ramen dipping options. And udon. It was definitely an effortful establishment with a homey feel. I'm enticed to give them 4 stars but I just haven't had enough to call it that, yet. Best part? Their restroom with a sliding broken door was kept clean all night and equipped with a toothpick, flossing and mouthwash station- how cool is that?",1,,1
56,Jenny C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",121,295,367,4.0,11/8/2015,"As much as I'd hate to admit it, I think Zen 6 has something great going on. The husband and I came here on a random Saturday night shortly after 6pm and there was no wait. Score! We ordered the ramen burger to share as an appetizer, I ordered tan tan 6 with thin noodles, and the husband ordered the hakata tonkotsu ramen in spicy. You can choose the thickness of your ramen noodles... but in case you are indecisive or have no clue, the menu does give you recommendations.The ramen burger came wrapped up alongside a small side of tortilla chips and hummus. While I thought the tortilla chips and hummus were a rather strange combo with the ramen burger, the hummus was phenomenal. The ramen burger here taste very different from the one you get from Smorgasburg. In fact, I enjoyed the one at Zen 6 much more. The one from Smorgaburg is a little overwhelming with the hoisin-like sauce. Here, you can really taste the beef in the burger and the sweet, savory subtlety of the sauce. The ramen ""bun"" was a little oily though. The cost is a little steep at $7.95. It is called ""the ramen burger 6"" so one would think it costs $6 if they do not notice the small fine print of the price on the upper right hand corner. Nonetheless I felt like I was being conned!The tan tan 6 is really quite special. I thought it was absolutely delicious. The broth bears some resemblance to my favorite ramen in the world from Ichiran in Japan. Just lighter and not as rich. My husband does not see it and thinks I'm crazy. I prefer it with the thin noodles that way you can slurp up more of the broth with every bite versus the thick wavy noodles they recommend.I had a taste of the husband's hakata tonkotsu ramen and I was not a fan at all. All I tasted was the ginger. Pass. He liked it more than the tan tan 6 though - that crazy man.I checked-in on Yelp and got a free mini Calpico. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed because I did not know it was for a mini size until I saw it. Plus, I was given a strawberry flavored one which was gross. Honestly, I would rather not have had it as I felt like it was a cruel jape. Bring back the free popsicles I keep reading about! When we received the check in the end, we were very surprised to see it say ""cash only"" on the little black folder thingy. No where does it say cash only anywhere until you get the check in the end. What if people don't walk around with cash? That is not cool. They should make a sign at the restaurant's entrance.Overall, the prices of the ramen are fair especially for New York City. The ramen burger, not so much. But most importantly, the food here is pretty darn good and so I do see myself coming back.",12,3,6

The kara-age was the perfect start to the meal. Plump pieces of chicken served in a sweet and sour sauce, can't go wrong! The sukiyaki beef udon was full of umami flavors. The beef was fall-off-the-bone. I'm a huge fan of tripe too so I was happy that the tripe pieces did not disappoint either!

Surprisingly, this place is not crowded at all considering it's dinner hour on a weekend!We had the Soft Shell Crab Ramen & Dancing Spicy Ramen. The taste was just rather ordinary, nothing spectacular. The soft shell crab may have tasted better if it was served on the side, instead of being soaked into the broth making it soggy if it is not eaten instantly. The fried calamari I had in the bowl for Dancing Spicy Ramen, they were soaked in the broth, so the tempura just fell off even before I'm able to eat my first piece, which is terrible - I had to eat the tempura & the calamari separately!For the price I'm paying for a bowl of ramen ($16), It's definitely more expensive than other ramen places, hence I was expecting way more out of it. Hence, I'm giving this place just a 2-stars, nothing that really makes me go ""wow!"". If you'd love or crave for a good bowl of ramen, I would recommend these places - either 'Minca' or 'Cocoron'.

I got their popular take on Tan Tan Ramen and, while I don't often land on ground beef over other meat choices, I wanted to try the dish the way they made it, first. It was very good, for ground beef, and it let the meat fall more evenly throughout the dish as I ate it. Pleasant surprise. The broth was perfectly spiced. The egg was cooked proper. I got thick wavy noodles and the portion was just right, I am full and very happy. I will order from here again to try their other options.",1,1,
78,Gregory C.,"New York, NY",98,173,28,5.0,8/9/2016,"The place was closing up a bit early when I walked in. This location is at least a couple of blocks away from the one on St Marks place. The layout is somewhat narrow but long where all the seats and tables are to the left (looking in) and walking space to the right. The place was completely empty even though the door was open and the OPEN sign was still on. This reminds me of contemporary dessert spots I have been to in the past and other Japanese themed restaurants. The whole place has a relaxing and welcoming vibe to it.  As I walked in a young lady was behind the far counter busy with something and did not hear or see me walk in. One of the kitchen staff (or maybe boss) happen to peak out of the kitchen. I felt bad as I somewhat startled the woman behind the counter. I politely asked if it was too late to make an order for eating in. She informed me that they would be closing a bit earlier tonight but would inquire with the kitchen staff. The older gentleman inside nodded approval and I took a seat right near the register. The reason for me making the trek all the way there so late was because of a ramen burger craving. The last time I had a ramen burger was at a festival in San Francisco's Japantown approximately two years ago. I liked it then but never got to try it again. Recently, during a dessert trip in July, I got to speaking with a group of sisters (whom I referenced in another review). We were talking about different places in the city to get some good food and Brooklyn came up. I was simply told to go to Smorgasburg and get a ramen burger. It was at that moment that memories of my first taste in SF surfaced. After doing some checking and randomly seeing a sign one night I realized I did not have to go all the way to Brooklyn (and overpay) to get the ramen burger experience again.  In addition because I knew I would be hungry again, I added some shumai and vegetable gyoza to the order. I wanted to order more food but was on a tone constraint unfortunately.  I think I at very quickly in that short amount of time. And it was very good. I may try some ramen next time. Zen 6 seems like it might be very busy during the day and at dinner time. Service is very good. The young lady was very polite and the kitchen staff was accommodating. They could have easily said the kitchen was closed and turned me away. I am very thankful and appreciative they did not. And I did apologize more than once for coming in at such a late hour. Prices again I think were fair. The price of the ramen burger is a a couple of dollars less (you can view the menu online) than if you were to get it at other places. This place does warrant another visit. Maybe two ramen burgers to start with....",4,,2

To start, we ordered the garlic soy sauce fried chicken. It is very good and crispy. It came with a small side of mash potatoes or egg salad. We ordered the tan tan 6, shoyu ramen, and sukiyaki q chan ramen. I ordered the spider ramen for myself. Broth is super rich and creamy. Compliments the ramen and soft shell crab really nicely. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",3,,

There are so many different ramen styles to choose from and I decided to go for their signature bowl. It's different from most other ramen I've tried and it was delicious. It tasted so fresh and had a serious kick to it (if you don't like spicy, steer clear.) And the ramen burger - what a find. It's cooked perfectly and the sauce compliments it very nicely. It does get messy but aren't all the best foods messy? Every bite was better than the next. If you check in you get a free little bottle of this sweet lychee drink - really interesting taste.",10,4,6

I was excited to try it and was satisfied but not blown away. Glad I can check it off my bucket list but highly doubt I will have another one anytime soon. This place, like many others in the area, is tiny but there was no wait. Service was sloooooooow. Like it took over 30 minutes to get an order of curry chicken and dumplings (our appetizers), both of which were underwhelming. The burgers came out about five minutes later. To their defense, I heard the waitress say they only had one cook today so I'll let it slide. Overall, this place wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Just average. But in a city full of ramen and other great things, average just doesn't cut it.",,,

Talk about wallet friendly..   Lunch special is totally awesome. Starting at $9.50 you get a nice salad (No iceberg lettuce in that salad, Son! Baby arugla, avocado, tomato, purple onion), an appetizer, and a full sized ramen WITH all the toppings!! As far as the ramen game goes, they hold their own. Deeply flavored broths (many different styles - I go for the shoyu, tonkotsu, or they offer a shoyu-tonkotsu the best of both worlds;-)), the tan tan 6 signiture ramen is pretty awesome too.. 3 styles of noodles to choose from which are perfect and chewy,  packed with toppings - including soft boiled seasoned egg my friends.. yaaas!, tender and flavorful melt in your mouth pork chiasu... mmm mmm mmm good! All for, control yourselves.. $9.50!!!  Yes, I've paid upwards of $16-20 for a bowl of ramen like this (and it didn't come with apps!).. so have you I'm sure.. Aside from lunch, the ramen prices are lower ($9-$15.50) than your average over-hyped,  over-priced ramen houses (ie. ippudo, totto, momofuko) and this ramen stands up to all of those places. Am not one to jump on a bandwagon ;-).. Did I say how much I depise those trendy, hyped up, loud annoying hipster over-run horrible hiphop techno music blasting ramen ""scenes"" where it's so loud you can't have a conversation and the staff pretends to know Japanese.. ugh...  Oh sorry I digress..  Not only that, I got to watch Adam Sandler shoot a movie across the street as I slurped my happy lil' heart out over a bowl of yummy satisfying r-a-m-e-n.. :-)   Pssst!.. me thinks this ramen rivals Minca...Based on the quality of food AND the insane value you get with the lunch special this is 5 stars. 4 for ramen, 1 for lunch special.

It has the freshness of an In-and-Out burger (Cali reference), but replace the bun with ramen noodles that are tender but firm and toasted on the outside, but firm and moist on the inside. There's so much texture but an explosion of flavor, some kind of tomato-based soy sauce situation is poured over the patty with a fresh tomato slice and sauteed onions with lettuce and I guess mayo? So you're getting hot and cold, soft and crunchy, savory and bland all at once... It's beautiful.Typically, I add bacon and extra cheese to burgers, the restaurant doesn't allow that option, however, the burger taste perfect without the additions.",3,,1
88,Matthew L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,2,0,4.0,3/21/2017,"Came on Tuesday late at night. Happened to be during their 3rd anniversary celebration (so to speak) so their udon was half off so I ordered their Sumo Nabeyaki Udon and an order of regular karaage.For a relatively cold night, this definitely hit the spot. The noodles were thinner and softer than expected, so they were easy to slurp down. The soup, nice and hot, was pretty good and sweet. It wasn't super strong but definitely wasn't watered down in any way. The other elements in the dish, ie the fish cake, Tofu etc. were flavourful and filled me up.The karaage was very tender, though not as crunchy as I would have liked, but good nevertheless. They have bottles of this spicy yuzu sauce which pairs nicely with the karaage.Overall, very satisfied with this place. The ambiance is peaceful, and the interior is cute. Would definitely come back!

Nonetheless I ignored it and went right in.  Please note after we sat down for about half hour, the restaurant started to fill up.I had the vegetarian gyoza and it was quite flavorful.  They give you 5 for about $5.  I had the soft shell crab ramen noodles, the most expensive one on the menu.  This soft shell crab was quite small, not sure if they are in season, but it was not that flavorful.  The ramen was cooked perfectly and the broth was not salty at all so I drank the entire thing.  They were a little heavy on the MSG because i was thirsty later in the night.  Vegetarian and pescatarian friendlyYelpers check in for free ice cream barCASH only",3,2,

Overall, the food here is mediocre, their ramen flavors are overpowered by one or two overwhelming scents, and they blast club music here... 1) Miso ramen - had an odd burnt aftertaste to the soup itself, but with side of egg, cha siu tender pork.-spicy sauce on the side is an ADDITIONAL $1 for Chili garlic sauce/Grandma style chili flakes which I have in my fridge). NOT the authentic spicy sauce you might expect to get from Totto Ramen2) Tonkotsu ramen - too much ginger flavor in this as well.3) Ramen burger - $7, average. Just imagine a burger with tomato, patty, and a ramen bun. NOTHING like the smogasburg ramen burger. They need to add scallions, onions, or something to make the burger pop. Do NOT recommend.Service was good, bathroom is average and door barely closes, CASH only. I would not come back as there are much better options in the area.",2,5,1

This place worked out perfectly because it was only a few blocks from where I am staying. When I first saw the burger, I thought it looked a little puny, but this thing is filling as the bun is essentially a meal portion of ramen. The burger itself was tasty and it was dressed with lettuce, tomato, and a spicy sauce. I also tried their pork bao and it was good. Not the best I've ever tried or anything, but I would say a little above average.  The prices are OK. I can't comment on the service because I had it as takeout. All in all, a satisfying meal and I can now check the ramen burger off my ""to try"" list.",11,2,4

101,Regina R.,"Manhattan, NY",299,43,62,3.0,8/14/2016,"I have really been craving for some spicy ramen and most places usually don't meet my standards for what ""spicy"" is, so I like to ask about dishes. I asked the waitress if the Dancing Spicy Ramen is really really spicy (since there are 3 hot chili peppers next to it) and she said no it is mild but I can purchase the additional spicy ramen sauce. I was kind of turned off by this since every place I go to, I always ask to make my food extra spicy and I've never had the waiter have me pay extra to do so. I said it's okay I'll just try it with medium noodles and my cousin ordered the spider ramen with thick wavy noodles. The Dancing Spicy Ramen was quite delicious and had just enough spice for me to feel it (clearly the waitress didn't try this one herself). It had a thick and fatty slice of chasu pork and fried calamari. The fried calamari had its own seasoning that was quite delicious, but it over took the flavoring of the broth. The noodles were okay, I wish I got the thick wavy noodles. But I was overall disappointed with the egg. In ramen, I'm always looking for that perfect soft boiled egg, but the egg in both of our ramen a was fully booked and the yolk was crumbling into the ramen, I ended up just eating it so I could enjoy the ramen without it getting all weird from the yolk. Although, this ramen was only $12.50 so for that price I can look past the few flaws, if I just want some ramen to satisfy a craving. The Spider Ramen was also delicious. The thick wavy noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth without any spice was rich and flavorful. They give a good amount of soft shell crab and corn to keep you satisfied. This ramen was $16.95 I believe or maybe $15.95. Both ramens has a large abundance of bamboo shoots that were very overpowering when you got one in your bite.",,1,

Most recently my fiance got the tan tan 6, i got the shoyu ramen (both with wavy thick noodles), and we shared the ramen burger and the mini crab fried rice. Loved the ramen - the noodles were cooked perfectly, the broth had great flavor, and the meat fell apart. Wish the yolk was a little more soft-boiled though. The burger was good - really greasy, but the mayo really made it work. The crab fried rice was ok, not amazing. They used fake crab (kani) but we were starving so it was a decent appetizer. Our friends had the pork buns and said while they were good, Ippudo's are better.Was a little annoyed that we were told we could check in for the free Calpico, but then told that they were out of Calpico after we had checked in.

Tan Tan - This bowl of ramen was their main star.  Nicely fried garlic slices on top, great aroma and springy noodles. The broth was very good. Not too oily and didn't stick to my ribs. Minced pork was delicious, especially since I was so sick of the char su most ramen joints use. The tonkatsu was very good. Nothing special but still delicious. The Goyza was terrible. The veggies inside were too much and it tasted bitter. The Kara age was burnt. Nothing special about this. The sushi roll was good. It was 50% off today. Will visit if in the area again.",6,,2

The ramen had a delicious broth with a kick, ground meat and fried garlic in it and the tastes blended well together. If you don't prefer garlic I'd probably stay away from this. The ramen burger was surprisingly delicious! It was my first one but it was so enjoyable. The noodle buns had a slight crisp to it and the noodles were softly cooked. A good number of negative reviews but I guess we got lucky because it was great. The patty was juicy and the sauce was flavorful. The burger comes with some chips and dip as well.

This place is comparable to ippudo, if they used more wavy noodles I'd say it's just as good. The broth was rich and bursting with flavor. The toppings complemented the ramen so well in every bite. I was slurping away with joy, so much joy that I asked for kaedama. Verdict of the ramen burger??Um, that was the BEST freakin' ramen burger I had. Keizo Shimamoto's burger cannot even compare to how good Zen 6's burger is. First of all, the meat was actually juicy, second of all, there was a vast amount sauce so every bite was full of flavor. Third, the noodles were so fresh yet pressed nicely together and it wasn't super greasy. It was adorable how it was served in a lantern origami packaging. Along with the burger it came with a side of chips and hummus, I thought it was a weird combination since it is a japanese joint anyways. I would've done a wasabi inspired spread or something soy sauce based or even teriyaki. The spread tasted like the sabra ones I get at the supermarket sometimes. I won't complain much about it since the focus is on the burger, these are just minor adjustments they can do to better execute the dish overall.I'm definitely coming back to try their other creations. Don't forget to check in and get your free japanese ice cream bars! My partner and I got the red bean and green tea and they are refreshing and not too sweet. Another great pointer, their bathroom is equipped with mouthwash, floss, q tips and the like. I usually don't see these offered in restrooms unless it's a hotel or a michelin star restaurant. So super kudos to them for providing hygiene for its customers. Make sure you don't go to the wrong one! Lastly I noticed there was a listing for another zen 6 not too far away, it's housed on Saint Mark's but their reviews are less and the ratings are a lot lower, I'm assuming they're not the same food or quality?? It's only a few blocks away, worth the 5 min trek from Saint mark's to the better Zen 6, your taste buds will thank you.",2,,

We arrived here post XLB at The Bao for second dinner (yes, this should be a totally acceptable thing) with a group of 5. We were seated immediately (awesome) and extremely excited to note the 50% off sushi deal.The ramen burger was fairly tasty and enjoyable. It's more typical of the American burger than what I tried at Smorgs: we had two large ramen ""buns"" sandwiching a burger, lettuce, and tomato. I prefer the more Asian flavors of the Smorgs ramen burger, but I am traditionalist. My BF got the Tan Tan ramen which was a hefty serving of spicy noodles- he thoroughly enjoyed them.The biggest complaint was in regards to the sushi: the Chirashi had super hot rice that cooked the cold sashimi! And the sashimi did not look fresh- the friend eating it claimed that the Chirashi wasn't worth it, even 50% off!The servers were attentive, but we were surprised by the 20% gratuity they added on. Also we weren't aware that it was cash only- fortunately we were able to sort it out among ourselves.If you are visiting and really aching to try the ramen burger but don't have time to go to Smorgs- give this a shot. Otherwise, skip it! Especially skip the sashimi!",,,
114,Michael T.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,33,67,4.0,11/3/2015,Came here at the suggestion of a friend. It was either this place or an AYCE sushi. Seeing that some of us were not that hungry in our group of 4. This place seems to be the better choice that we won't have to stuff ourselves to get our money's worth. It was the good decision too. I opt for the miso ramen with wavy noodle (there are 3 type of noodles to choose from but they have recommendations on which to ate for each ramen) and a ramen burger. Ramen was good but the ramen burger got most of my attention. Although the ramen buns can be more crispy the juiciness of the burger and the sauce they used made it forgiving. Oh my friends that ordered sushi here say it's mediocre but the 50% off sushi makes it attractive to try if you some craving for sushi.,6,,

Updated review","I love Japanese food and this place did not disappoint.  Make sure to check in to get a complimentary mini calpico drink. Small establishment but full of great food.  Just one look at the menu and I was sold.  They do have a ramen burger and I was a bit hesitant at first since I did not enjoy it during the big craze last year.  Granted this was made by a different chef so I did give it a try - loved it!Tan tan ramen - like the Chinese dan dan mian in ramen soup.  Ground pork on top of ramen with bamboo shoots and a runny egg.  Good!Ramen burger - very good!  Would definitely recommend.  Lettuce, meat, sauce with a hint of sweetness and the perfectly made ramen bun. Takoyaki - this was ok. Not much octopus, tasted a lot more flour than anything else, wasn't too fond of the sauce. Pork steamed bun - oh yeah!  The traditional pork belly bun.  Soft nicely baked bun with some delicious pork belly inside and a piece of lettuce.  Recommend!Curry chicken kara-age - very good as well, crunchiness and you can definitely taste the curry in the batter.  The chicken was nice and tender as well.  2nd time we got this seemed like the oil they used to deep fry the chicken needed to be replaced.. Sukiyaki ramen - surprisingly worked out pretty well with the thin noodles. Would recommend!",3,,

The food here is outstanding with a nice selection of choices and combinations. You can't beat their lunch special pricing at such a affordable price. Salad, app, ramen, and a dessert with yelp check in.Service to me was adequate but could be better as we were left at the table for quite a long time before our orders were taken with only one other table in the establishment being served a meal. This i would of given 5 stars. The app i chose was the Karage chicken with the sweet and spicey sauce. Fried up well lots of chicken and not overwhelmed by breading. The sauce accompanied it well. Also had the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen which had a great broth with a nicely cooked egg. The ramen had a nice bite to it and the pork belly with accompanying toppings made the dish making me wanting to go back for it more. TIP: with a yelp check in you get a free Popsicle dessert. A choice between red bean or the green tea with red bean filling. Go for the second a nice ending to your meal.",7,,2

Rare to non-existant in Boston, hence my deeeep satisfaction. ++$9.50 for their lunch set special- choose one of their variety of ramens (you can choose the thickness of your noodles for each one- flat, thick, medium thick, thin, wavy) + a side dish + a salad with avocado and vinaigrette dressing. Bomb steal and customization :) ++Ramen burger- definitely interesting and delicious, though over hyped back in the days. The noodles were cooked perfectly so it maintained its outer rigidity to hold the burger together but within the noodles also had it's softer consistency.

Beats waiting forever in Smorgasburg for the ramen burger that you may not even have a chance for if you are too late.Ramen burger: Perfect juicy tender beef patty with well cooked ramen buns. To add to these perfectly cooked ramen buns, the flavor held extremely well... teriyaki juice dripping down my face. The best part of this burger was that the buns held to every juicy end. Ramen itself was ok, there was a little less flavor than I would have liked, but it was still tasteful. The place itself is quite small. Comfy setting for a lunch or dinner date. The service was good and the waitress was very nice.",8,1,5

124,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,232,325,4.0,7/15/2014,"Such great ramen! Yelp, you have not disappointed me. Had the Akadama Champon and the only thing 'wrong' I can think of was that it was definitely on the richer side - but that's very much a personal preference. The bowl was piping hot when it came out, noodles were wavy and nicely chewy and substantial, soup was creamy and flavorful but not overly salty (THANK YOU), and there was plenty of seafood - shrimp, octopus, squid, fish ball slices. Portion size was quite generous and filling. Overall nothing extremely super wow, but a veeerrry delicious bowl of ramen nonetheless.Don't forget to check in on Yelp...you get a free ice pop! Has every other reviewer said the same thing too? Also definitely go with the green tea - it has red bean inside so you get both flavors.",5,3,4

I liked the green tea one better but both ice bars were good. We started with the ice bar while we perused the menu. I ordered their signature Tan Tan 6 ramen but asked for it to be not spicy. They were able to change the spice level for me. The soup combines chicken and tonkotsu (pork bone) broths to get just the right creaminess and richness. Fried garlic chips were carefully laid on top and I tasted roasted garlic oil which added a nice flavor to the soup. There is a mound of meat sauce that begs to be mixed into the ramen. There was also the typical ramen fresh vegetable medley..bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, scallions, etc. My fave, a softly cooked egg was laid in the soup. Everything is begging for you to mix it together but I held back a little because I love crispy garlic chips. If you like garlic as much as me, then you'll love the Tan Tan 6. I would totally order this again. My bf ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen which was a mild, silky and smooth pork based broth ramen. It was also very good.Both broths were not too salty and the ramen had the right texture. We loved it.The price of broth ramens are less than $11 each. At the end of our meal we also got coupons to bring back next time for 3 free gyozas, yay! Can't wait to come back.",5,2,5

The invention of the ramen burger should be given a chapter in the historical records of ramen, as it marks yet another milestone in the advancement of the art of noodle making.But Zen 6 rocks not only creative ramen fondling. Its regular noodles-in-the-bowl-of-soup also come with high marks. I personally recommend the Dancing Spicy and the Spicy Dragon Chasiu (Where's the Dancing Spicy Dragon Warrior Panda Quadrant?).

We decided to get the Pork Buns to share, she got a Ramen Burger while I got Zen Ramen. Oh, did I mention you can pick the type of noodles you want? They also have suggestions if you're not a noodle expert.In all, a great meal. The flavor is amazing.

133,Tina T.,"Manhattan, NY",13,115,201,2.0,3/30/2016,"I was absolutely confused when I dined here. One star for decor that could be cute. One star for the ramen that people are raving about that I did not try.My order consisted of the following:I. Pan Fried Ramen: oily, inconsistently cooked, not much flavor, except maybe asian soy sauceII. Salmon and Tuna Roll (exact name unknown): not special, not completely inedible, but normal, small for price even with the 50% off discountIII. Junmai Sake: sweet, normally good, best part of meal for allowing me to forgetIV. Mushroom and Pork Belly Stir Fry: also oily, nothing memorableThe food was just okay, and maybe with a perfect dining experience could have garnered a three star review. However, my confusion about this restaurant lies in whether or not they accept card. Woman agrees to take card for me and my party, forgets, declines us, remembers. On menu pages, it says it takes card. I assume for seamless and online orders they take card. So, why not in person? I don't mind a cash-only establishment, but you either take card or you don't, from a professional standpoint. Also, the second server looked pretty clueless and out of it, adding to my confusion about this place. Perhaps we came too early...",,2,

With its recent Christmas decorations, this place just brightens up any corporate employee's mood after a long week at work. The atmosphere of this little shop is so friendly and cozy. My friend and I encountered this spot on a cold and quiet Friday evening. We were really the second customer who walked through the door right when they open for dinner service. We did love the attentiveness of the staff. Vegetable Gyoza.  We got this as an appetizer. Presentation was very neat and I loved the color of the green skin. They are pretty tasty and pretty good but no notable difference from other ramen spots. Hakata Tonkotsu was my choice of ramen. I really thought their take on tonkotsu was just okay. The soup was very watery in texture and taste. It was not silky or smooth like how I would like it to be but the rich pork-flavor was there. The noodles are actually pretty good, I loved that it was soft but also had that perfect texture. The pieces of char siu pork did not look like they were torched grilled or charred in anyway so it actually became boring to eat after a bite. Overall, ramen here was alright and I would give it another try if I am in the area. Check-in on Yelp and get a free popsicle!",2,1,1

But the shrimp & mushroom buns both the mushroom and shrimp are fried and barely in every bite of the bun which is unfortunate. For the price they should at least put two pieces of (small) shrimp in the buns and two (thin) slices of mushroom. I've also ordered the spicy calamari which I'm sure is delicious in the restaurant but doesn't travel well at all in delivery.The TanTan 6 ramen is the best and its soooo good & spicy! Love it! I like that you can pick your noodle preference. Medium thick is the best in my opinion.The Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen is also realllllly yummy but I still prefer the TanTan6.Great delivery spot. Love it!,3,,

139,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64808,4.0,1/9/2014,"The ramen here is really incredible, and you don't need to wait two hours to get a table.In fact, this tiny place located on a quiet block too close to some of the heavy hitter ramen joints (Ippudo, Momofuku Noodle Bar) was practically empty at around 7 PM on a Wednesday.The tiny, brightly-lit, quiet place, with faint background music playing is not trendy or hip like the others, but feels more like a traditional ramen shop in Japan. Adding to that authenticity are the sweet Japanese waitresses that speak just enough English to serve you, and the bright menus with pictures, also available in Japanese.At first you might be worried when you see the extra menu page for the faddy Ramen Burger (""New York has Big Thing!"" declares the menu), but once you try any of the food, you will see how excellent this place is and kick yourself for that time you waited forever at Totto to get a really good bowl of spicy ramen.Aside from the ripoff of the Ramen Burger, this place is very unique in their menu offerings. We started with one of three different types of chicken karaage available (they have regular, sweet and curry) ($5.25). The sweet variety was really tasty, and you could tell how fresh it was from the temperature and the time it took for it to come out.We of course tried a Ramen Burger ($8), and it happened to be really delicious. Randomly served alongside 4 tortilla chips with some unidentified dipping spread, it wasn't quite as good as the original one from Smorgasburg and Dassara, but it is still really tasty. The patty on this one is really thin and kind of dry compared to the thick, juicy one you wait in line for, but the ramen buns are really delicious, and this is a great way to try it without the lines and the hipsters.As for the ramen, the two we tried were a little too similar (which was my fault), but both were some of the best I've had in NY. We got the Spicy Dragon Chasiu Men ($15.50) and the Tan Tan 6 Ramen (only $10.75). Both had really rich, thick, excellent Tonkotsu broths, and both were super spicy. The former comes with 5 pieces of buttery soft, pretty fatty pork and a half of a poached egg. The broth has that scary reddish color, so you know it's hot. The latter, the Tan Tan 6, was even better. A steal at just $10.75 (I guess because there is no fatty pork included), this comes with some spicy ground meat, crispy fried garlic and a half of a poached egg. Nearly as spicy as the other one, this one packed even more flavor from the ground beef and the awesome garlic chips. I would definitely recommend trying this one.One of the things that's cool here is that you can choose what type of noodle you want (thin, medium or thick and wavy), which can satisfy the preferences of all ramen snobs. The medium thickness was suggested on the menu for the Spicy Dragon, and we chose the thick and wavy for the Tan Tan 6, and both were nice and chewy and as good as most noodles I've tried.One of the things that's not great here is that the food can take awhile to come out. If this place were actually crowded, like it deserves to be, I don't see how they could possibly keep up with the volume. The only other gripe I have is that it is cash only.Service was really great - constant water refills, which are very necessary with those spicy bowls, and very friendly.When you get the check, they give you a coupon for 3 free Gyoza on your next visit for each bowl of ramen purchased. Even though I didn't need it, this was just more incentive to return for some really excellent, satisfying ramen.",18,4,11

I can get a ramen bowl for less that $10 and there's 10% discount for paying in cash. Credit is $15 minimum. The waiter would give recommended types of noodle per your choice of ramen.

The style is a bit more fusion that I'd like (personally I prefer more traditional), but just a preference. Looks like a lot of people come here for the ramen burger (which I didn't have) but just the noodles alone weren't super super memorable (good but just not amazing). The place is small but cute and not too packed. Worth a peek if you're in the area.",4,1,1
142,Tyler L.,"New York, NY",357,922,1278,4.0,11/17/2014,"I came here with a friend specifically to try the Ramen Burger. This place is a small place with a few tables inside and was full on a Friday night. We tried the following:-Kara-age - Japanese fried chicken. This one was tasty but was not worth it. It was basically four, tiny pieces of fried chicken for $5. -Tan Tan 6 Ramen - This is one of their signature ramen bowls. My friend and I each tried it. It contained bean sprouts, ground meat, fried garlic and boiled egg. This was very flavorful and was a good size portion. The only problem  was that it was too salty. Still enjoyable, though there are better ramen bowls to be had in the East Village.-Ramen Burger - Delicious! My friend and I both agreed that this was by far the best thing we had here. The bun of the burger is made up of deep fried ramen noodles and is extremely greasy. You actually have to eat it with the paper holder that it comes in. The beef patty was also moist and juicy and the burger comes with the orange ginger dressing you get with salads in Japanese places. This is definitely the must try item on their menu.",2,,1

We also ordered the pork bun, the pork itself was a little dry but with the sauce and the mayo it was good. The kara-age?

Despite the fact that we've both lived in NYC our entire lives, we're still never fully ready for when fall hits. So when the temperatures started to dip, we headed over to Zen6 for some delicious and warm ramen. Since they're off the main area in the East Village, you never have to wait for a table or suffer rushed service for lunch. In fact, they even have a lunch special! For $9.50 you get your choice of six of their signature ramen dishes, a small side salad and your choice of six mini sides.I went with their Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen, which features a milky tonkotsu soup base with ""umami dama"" on top. I went with their thin straight noodles and it was so good! The soup base was very tasty and definitely did not lack in flavor at all. One portion was enough to fill me up until way past dinner - and we ate at 12:30pm! I went with a small side of gyoza, which were crunchy and juicy. The dipping sauce is a bit spicy though, so beware!Service was attentive throughout despite the fact that it was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.

The salad and appetizer I got (chicken karaage) were just okay. Nothing special. For my ramen, I got the Tan Tan ramen, which is a play on the Szechuan Dan Dan noodle. It was supposed to be spicy and flavorful, but instead it just tasted like...salt. This is probably the saltiest ramen I've ever had, and I've had many. I also tried my companions' broths and they were all also overwhelmingly salty (believe one got the Shoyu and one got Tonkotsu). There was a severe lack in depth of flavor.

151,Art L.,"New York, NY",66,357,334,2.0,10/10/2014,"Zen 6 is located on a block that is traditionally the 6th Street ""curry row"" in the East Village. It's one of the few non-Indian restaurants on that street so it stands out. I really like how the dining room is warmly lit in wood-tones and feels homey. The dining room is staffed by two waitresses who I feel are a bit over-worked. What drew me here was the promise of ramen. I loved the colorful menus which are so easy to understand and help you order by recommending the type of noodle to go with your broth choice.  The same colorful menu you find on their website, is exactly what you get at the restaurant, in addition to menu cards showing you the ramen burger, and another type of ramen called ""evil"" ramen - I think that's the name.  We ordered the Akadama Champon and the Spicy Dragon Chasiu Men. The Akadama Champon is a seafood ramen. From what I could see, this ramen was served with a white tonkotsu broth contained chopped up bits of veggies (cabbage, radishes, etc.) half an egg, and seafood, mainly squid and chopped bits of shrimp. If you are looking for substantial pieces of seafood you won't get it here. I felt the soup was a bit salty, even for ramen standards. The biggest disappointment had to do with the noodles. It didn't have that nice eggy taste and springy texture that I like. In fact, the noodles were maybe a millimeter or two thicker than your standard curly ramen noodle. It just tasted like a pre-boiled ramen noodle that is sold in packages. As for the Spicy Dragon Chasiu Men, there was an egg, two slices of chasiu and the broth was swimming in red oil. According to my friend, it was okay. She just wished the chasiu was either cut thicker or and extra slice provided. She had also mentioned how salty the broth tasted compared to others she's had.We also ordered the Chicken Karage. This was very disappointing because the ginger and seasoning was lacking and the dry flour frying method, created pieces that were very dry. The chicken was also a mix of white meat and dark meat pieces. On the bright side, we ordered the mixed crab fried rice, which was very delicious and the right size for a side dish. If they would use real crab, instead of imitation crab legs, it would have been better, but despite this, this dish is first rate in taste.Despite the overworked waitresses, service was good when we got their attention. It is also true that there is a cash only policy here and I appreciate it much because it's reflected in many of their lower-priced ramen choices and great lunch deals.In all, I've had better ramen, which merits the 2 stars, but I must give them 5 stars for having such a creative menu. Try Zen 6 to see if you agree with me.",1,2,

I've had plenty of those melt-in-your-mouth kind of pork buns so I wasn't wowwed at all by theirs. Pork was too hard from what I'm used to. Shumai wasn't bad and the kara age was okay. Tan tan 6 -  aesthetically, it looks cool and awesome but I actually thought the shoyu ramen just tasted better overall.  Noodles were a bit hard for my taste. Also, the spiciness just didn't cut it for me. It was flavorful but it just wasn't compatible with my taste buds. I wouldn't go as far as advise you not to get it because you might end up liking it.  It's all about personal taste and preference so you'll just have to try for yourself.",1,,

There's hardly any air conditioning here. The restaurant is quite small and wasn't too crowded when we arrived. When we arrived and sat down, we waited 5-10 minutes before we were able to flag down a waitress for 2 Ice Waters and 2 menus. We knew what we wanted and ordered right away and tried waited patiently.There were two waitresses that were working at the restaurant when we were there and they didn't seem very attentive either. After 40-45 minutes of waiting for food, my boyfriend and I weren't too happy because it typically doesn't take too long to look make an appetizer and two bowls of ramen.After an hour wait, our gyoza finally came. They were rather small and cost $5.25. The gyozas were slightly burnt and very tiny. It was definitely not worth the price.Five minutes later, our ramen finally arrives! Both of our bowls looked phenomenal! My boyfriend had the Tan Tan 6 (Zen 6 Original Ramen, with ground meat, bean sprouts, fried garlic, and bean sprouts). This ramen is usually served spicy, but he got it non-spicy. The broth was rich and delicious.I had the Akadama Champon (Seafood ramen with vegetables, Zen 6's *Select Umami Dama* and I got it with the wavy thick noodles as it was suggested. I liked that my bowl of ramen was like seafood heaven because it had shrimp, calamari, and scallops. I really like the texture of the ramen, very springy and wavy but I wasn't a fan of the broth. I'm not sure how many people ordered this ramen, but there was something different about the broth. It tasted like it was burnt. I'm not sure if it was meant to be that way or there was a cooking accident.I've been to 5+ ramen restaurants and I have never had to wait so long for gyozas and ramen, so not sure why it took so long for the chefs to cook unless there weren't enough chefs in the kitchen. Will I be back? I say a 50/50 chance. Some ramen spots are hit or miss and I felt is time it was a miss. I didn't really like my burnt-flavored ramen broth. Hopefully next time when I do visit, they will get it right.Note: If you check-in on Yelp, you qualify to get a free bowl of Kaedama (extra noodles).",2,15,1

A friend and I ran around circles in the East Village, looking for a place to eat until we finally agreed on this off-the-beaten-path hole-in-the-wall (excuse all the dashes, I'm a punctuation zombie.)I was immediately drawn by the diner-like red stools but the tables were so small. Try to get a wall bench seating if you can. For a ramen shop, their ramen selection is quite limited. I got the Shoyu ramen and for my friend, the Tan Tan 6. We also ordered some appetizers like kimchi and dumplings to start off. I'm not a fan of spicy so I passed on the kimchi but the dumplings were average. The inside was pork and chives and it tastes like the ones from Vanessa's Dumplings but it was super oily and it was only lightly fried on one side.The Shoyu ramen was one of the best I've had yet. They have bamboo shoots in there, which I was not pleased with but picked them out anyway. But the rest of the stuff was great,especially the egg, where the yolk was leaky--YUMMM! I chose wavy noodles so it was a plus. The pork was also good, even though I wasn't really looking forward to that all that much. Even if they put lots of MSG (apart from the soy sauce flavoring), I wouldn't have noticed because the soup tasted authentic.The place is a little quiet, but I guess everyone's too busy slurping on their bowls. Attentive and friendly service, even though the food took a while to come--not that we were in a rush, but we were starving.",10,1,1

The waitress was friendly and helped us make beer suggestions since we weren't familiar with the choices.We ordered two ramen burgers, gyoza and Sapporo (I think). The presentation of the burgers was cute and the chips were different but still delicious.

170,Michelle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,14,7,2.0,11/20/2015,"Was craving sushi, and was in the neighborhood around 3-4pm, when most of the other Japanese restaurants were closed. I walked by this place, looked at its yelp reviews, and decided to come in. I saw that their sushi is 50% off. Sweet! At least I thought so at the time.I ordered a Miso Ramen (Which was okay. It's no Ippudo, Totto, or Mu.) and the tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna rolls. Oh my goodness. This was the fishiest sushi I have ever tasted. Tasted like the smell of Chinatown outdoor fish markets. I tried a piece of the spicy tuna, and was like whoa. Gross. I tried a piece of the tuna thinking it might have been a fluke, and ugh. It was the same thing. I couldn't bring myself to try the salmon. I know what you're thinking, it's fish! It should taste like fish! But NO. Good, fresh fish is NOT supposed to taste fishy. It's not supposed to be rubbery. I'm a huge sushi eater, and this is the worst sushi I have ever experienced. The rice and seaweed were a bit soggy, but the worst part was definitely the fish. I just couldn't eat it. It literally made me gag. I told my server I couldn't eat it, and she said they couldn't cancel it. Asked me if I wanted to take it home, as if it would somehow taste better later... The manager came by, and said the same thing. I mean, whatever, it's fine. I paid for it. Even though it wasn't a customer not particularly liking a dish they ordered, but the product actually being of inedible quality.I guess you get what you pay for.I just wonder, how are the reviews so good?",,,

178,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,10/23/2014,"It's pretty easy to overlook Zen 6, given its all-too-predictable location in East Village, the mecca of ramen spots in NYC. Wandering through St. Mark's in search of dinner led us to this eatery and despite the predominant advertising for their ramen burger, decided it would be worth a try. There were only a few other parties present at the time, so we were quickly seated and given menus and water.Zen 6 offers two different approaches to ramen: the Tokyo Standard, the traditional take on ramen, as well as the New York Pop, the unique and creative versions that can be found only at Zen 6. My eyes went immediately to the options that were marked as spicy, and finally decided on the ""Dancing Spicy Ramen"".In short time, a well-portioned bowl was brought out. The centerpiece is the fried calamari, a topping that, in hindsight, I wish more ramen joints offered. The crispness and chewiness is a perfect foil to the ramen, and although a few pieces became soggy in the broth, it was sufficiently placed on top of the other components. Also found in the bowl were scallions, crunchy daikon, and pickled bamboo shoots for more texture and acidity. The broth, a combination of chicken and tonkotsu, was creamy, rich, and well-seasoned, with deeper flavors highlighted by the addition of peanuts and fried garlic. Zen 6 allows guests to customize their bowls with three different noodle types (thin, medium straight, and wavy thick) and although the medium straight noodles were recommend with my bowl, I opted for the wavy thick ones instead. I typically lean towards this variety as it offers a little more chew in each bite, and although they were likely the pre-packaged variety, were at a nice al dente.While I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to ramen, I'm happy to say that Zen 6 pulls off its modernized versions with surprising success. Yelp users can also benefit from the check-in offer of a free small ice cream bar, which will allow you to suitably end the meal with a green tea or red bean-flavored dessert.",10,3,6

The service was good but the food did not blow me away. We had the shoyu ramen, the tan tan, the pork bun. First off the shoyu did not have enough ingredient to make it a ramen: 1 piece of pork slice, 1 egg, bean sprouts and noodles. It was chicken broth they use to make it which beats the purpose of a good soup base. The tan tan was wayyyy to spicy that it hits the throat. The noodles doesn't seem like it hand pulled but store bought. The pork bun was the best out of the meal. The meat was tender but the salad was too cold so it doesn't really compliment each other. We got free Popsicle not ice cream. We checked in on yelp and got 1 Popsicle to share. Cash only.

I looked at the menu and they had the classic standard ramen and some that they created themselves. I had the hakata tonkotsu ramen ($10.75), which is a classic and one of my favorite ramen. It is a pork bone broth that's rich and milky. I thought they didn't execute the ramen as well as it should have. The broth wasn't smooth and the flavors didn't meet my expectations. It was just an okay bowl of ramen.We also had the vegetable gyoza seared. It was 5 pieces for ($5.25). I like the filling and the seared on the bottom.

Updated review","Came here with the boyfriend on a Saturday. We weren't planning to have ramen but the restaurant we wanted to go to had a long waitlist so we found Zen6 nearby. We were glad we made that decision. The ramen was delicious & it was a quiet and comfortable little restaurant with friendly waitresses. ;) The broth is definitely worth mentioning because our ramens had their own special broth but they were both well designed to bring out the flavors in the respective ramen. For example, my mushroom ramen had such an earthy kind of flavor from all the mushrooms.. It was perfect! Apart from getting free ice cream bars by checking in on yelp, we also were given vouchers for free gyoza on our next visit! Overall, great ramen place with short wait time compared to some other ramen places in the area~ Next time I wanna try the ramen burger!",1,,

Not your top-notch ramen choice as the soup base is a little underwhelming and the pork is not as flavorful as I would hope to taste in a bowl of authentic Japanese ramen. One plus is that you do get a complimentary side dish along with the ramen you order. That's pretty nice.,,,

I asked about non-pork Ramen and Shin pointed to the seafood ramen Akadama Champon.  So I went with that. It didn't take long to get my soup.The bowl had a seafood broth with shrimp, squid rings from the body of the squid and some of the tentacles.
