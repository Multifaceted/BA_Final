0,Lateefah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,138,171,4.0,10/21/2018,"The Third Man is a really nice cocktail bar that I got to go ​to on a Saturday night. It is really unassuming and I would usually never be in this area, but I am glad that I was able to come here. I got here on around 7 with a friend and the bar was fairly empty except for two smaller groups and a bachelorette party. There is plenty of seating but I would say this is not a good bar for big parties as you only have two areas where you can sit if you are a bigger party. There are also two seating areas outside, overlooking​ the street. The drinks are reasonably priced at $14 each but I will say I have had better cocktails for a few dollars cheaper. If you can get here during happy hour (they even have a ​happy hour on Saturday), it would be well worth it. I would recommend the Third Man, which is Coffee Smoked Rum, Cynar, Benedictine, Cocchi di Torino, Fernet, Angostura. It's​ a boozy drink. One that I usually would not order, but the coffee really cuts the alcohol and makes it a pleasant drink to sip slowly. We were very comfortable at The Third Man but by 10 it definitely gets really crowded and raggy. They start playing electronic, clubbing music, which I thought was an interesting choice.",,,
1,Beril E.,"New York, NY",155,99,457,5.0,9/23/2018,"I've been looking for a solid cocktail place that has decent prices for happy hour for a long time and I think I can stop looking now that The Third Man has entered my life. Their cocktails are absolutely delicious. Just reading the menu, I was torn to try most, if not all of their cocktails. I tried two, both of which were very tasty in their own way. Lavender fizz, a fancy sounding cocktail with lavender infused gin, lavender essence, and egg whites had all of the right ingredients to make a delicious drink. What a Peach did not have too much of an alcoholic taste as the juices mixed so well with the gin that I felt like I was drinking blackberry seltzer. It is perfect for those who like sweet mixed drinks.Happy hour runs until 8, during which the $14 cocktails are half off, the tasty schnitzel sliders are $5 each and oysters are $1, which are surprisingly not bad. For reasons that fail me, the place was practically empty when we got there during happy hour. We didn't care since we were getting $7 cocktails that were absolutely delicious and upscale bar food. Seriously, you gotta go for the schnitzel sliders even if you aren't hungry. The ambiance is great: music isn't loud, lighting is dim and tables are wooden with high top chairs around the bar. I'd recommend this place if you're on a date or even if you just wanna chill with friends.",1,,2
2,Fred A.,"Manhattan, NY",399,152,0,4.0,8/28/2018,"Is this the old Summit bar? I don't know. I digress...I spent a good amount here, so I'm reeling from that. But in all fairness, really good cocktails. Not the widest variety in menu, but everything was very good, respectable. Great spot for ABC.Nice outdoor area in the back! Perfect for when the weather is nice.",,,
3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,5.0,6/27/2018,"The Third Man (or IIIrd Man, as their sign stylizes) is a bar lab-grown to please me, specifically. 5 to 6 ingredient, strong cocktails for $14, with tequila, bitter liqueurs, and Asian flavors well-represented? Sign me up. Though some ingredients may seem unusual, like red bean or cantaloupe, I found everything to be simply delicious, though spirit-forward. My friend's matcha old fashioned worked well, and my coconutty tequila drink had a nice note of spice to it.It was pretty quiet on a weeknight around 9-10 pm, though I've seen it much more happening on weekends. Service was solid. Decor is good and the lights are low. Just a nice, unpretentious place for a cocktail. I'm surprised they're so under the radar.",2,2,3
4,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,5.0,4/1/2018,"This is a great space! We came on a Saturday, and it was less than half full, plenty of seats at the bar and big tables. They have plenty of bar and standing area with a few tables around the side. The interior is decorated really nicely, seems brand new and very cozy and intimate inside. The bartenders were super friendly and I ordered the matcha margarita and it was amazing!! Definitely try some of the interesting drinks!",,,
5,Lydia T.,"New York, NY",87,167,90,5.0,7/20/2018,Cute place. I love the rustic look and feel of the place. The cocktails are strong as hell and its unique. I love that. I just came in to kill some time and pre-drink before going to an event.....so...worth it.,,,
6,Jennifer S.,"Brooklyn, NY",497,810,99,4.0,12/18/2017,"The bartenders here are talented and friendly and great  - Pedro is super nice and made me a cocktail based on ingredients I liked (lavender, egg white, gin mmmm). The cocktails are awesome and priced at about what you would expect for NYC - I think mine were $14 each. I love their tea-tails, which are cocktails made with tea. I didn't love the crowd when I went on a Saturday night around 10-11. At one point I was sitting there and the couples to the left, to the right and sitting in back of my seat were all making out and caressing and purring to their girlfriends about how hot they were. It was sort of obnoxious and I literally had to move to the corner while I waited for my friends because I was tired of hearing mouth noises. It's like everyone ten days in to their new relationships decided to celebrate their match.com anniversary or something. Anyway, I digress. Come here and get a drink, it's good.",2,1,2
7,Leena T.,"Secaucus, NJ",48,216,196,3.0,12/5/2017,"I might have just come at a wrong time, but ventured here on a Saturday evening for post boozy brunch drinks (yes more drinks needed).Relatively low-key vibe without much of a crowd, but the temperature was insanely muggy, and almost tough to breathe in. The one cocktail I tried was just eh, whiskey based but tasted of pickles.A lackluster first experience, but I do think I owe The Third Man a second chance; wouldn't negate coming here again given all the positive reviews.",1,,
8,Harsh S.,"Monroe Township, NJ",1,6,2,5.0,11/22/2017,"The cocktails are on point. Not anything less not anything more. And the bartender Pedro ah - let me say this ""if your blessed enough may be Just may be you'll get a chance to meet him."" This guy is awesome. Brother - we hope see you again! Perfect place for a first date! Ambiance is just perfect. Very chilled and relax environment. It was hard for me to find the place even though Uber dropped me at their approx location. But I believe you don't get or find anything worthy unless you've worked hard for it. Totally worth it. -Soni",,,
9,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,5.0,4/22/2017,"My favorite thing about The Third Man is its decor. I love the industrial/gentleman's study look it has going on - exposed piping, wrought iron glass holders, moss green leather seating in booths, and phallic blown glass lamp shades with low-wattage bulbs. I went on a Sunday afternoon and there was pretty much no one else there. We had a booth all to ourselves, which allowed us to people watch through the open windows (yay for warmer weather!)I liked the ambient/electronica/trip hop music they were playing as well. Perfect for languishing with your date.I thought the drinks were good, but not particularly memorable. Interesting and unique choices, so you'll find something good.",1,,1
10,Kate O.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,5/13/2018,This sweet spot in Alphabet City plays great tunes and has some of the best cocktails. Order the Mrs. Pink and the cucumber drink. So good.  LUCAS IS DA BOMB,,,
11,Valeria F.,"Manhattan, NY",34,248,5,4.0,8/24/2017,"This is the perfect bar - for a close gathering with friends, for a date, and even for meeting people in a more casual, less carnivorous environment. :)",,,
12,Thea C.,"New York, NY",130,213,81,5.0,1/11/2017,"Really, really wonderful bar. I went for a cocktail making place but we stayed for a while after. The drinks were amongst the best I've had in the city. The bartender (I wish I could remember his name!) was great. I plan to go back!",,,
13,Paul H.,"Manhattan, NY",192,343,178,1.0,8/10/2016,"Cockroaches on the bar.  Crawling all over the bar on 07/29/2016.Absolute grossness.  Looked like the movie ""Joe's Apartment""",2,3,
14,Rebecca V.,"White Plains, NY",2,37,6,4.0,3/24/2017,"Had a few drinks here last night and I loved it. It's a really pretty place and we came here on a Thursday night when they had live music.I went first with The Third Man - this was my favorite drink of the night. The coffee smoked rum in it was amazing.After that I tried an Iced Red Bean - honestly, I was not a fan of it at all. It was really sweet and had a weird sticky/powdery texture after every sip. The waitress was really chill and let me switch it out with a ""Where's My Llama?"" which was essentially a Pisco Sour. I'd definitely come back again - especially on a night with live music.",2,1,1
15,Cheryl N.,"Manhattan, NY",165,292,1038,3.0,9/11/2016,"I had just left my birthday bash at a bar nearby and a friend and I were looking for a cool place to hang and grab another drink before we went home. He told the bartender it was my birthday so the bartender was really nice and said my drink was on the house. Mike made an EXCELLENT Moscow Mule for me and an pretty good Old Fashioned for my friend.The ambiance was more on the romantic side, dimly lit, but we sat at the bar. After we were there several minutes a musician started playing guitar And singing. He was good, too bad more people weren't there to hear them. The bill came, must have been a different bartender who closed us out because we were charged for both drinks. No free birthday drink after all, but we still had a good time.",,1,
16,Philip N.,"New York, NY",8,149,26,4.0,6/29/2017,"This is a hidden gem! First off, great happy hour... especially for someone who enjoys gin. You can make your own gin cocktail. Their bartender staff are a great group. They're kind and helpful. The prices are fair. Go check this spot out.",1,,
17,Nicky F.,"New York, NY",555,24,7,5.0,6/22/2017,The bartender was so nice and made the best gin and tonic I have ever had!! It was cucumber and lime infused and was perfectly strong. There was live music and the whole vibe of the bar was spot on. Can't wait to go back!,,,
18,Stephen F.,"New York, NY",254,9,1,5.0,12/31/2015,"This place has absolutely incredible cocktails. Rarely do you find a bar that has such an eclectic, relaxed atmosphere but still can be bursting with energy. Between the wide variety of drinks and the tight playlist they've got playing, it's quickly become one of my top bars. I've brought my friends here tons of times, they were very accommodating with a buddy's birthday party. Great service and a pretty awesome food menu for some unique bar bites.I'd recommend 3rd man to anyone who really wants to enjoy their night but doesn't want to pay a ridiculous cover or deal with over-served, drunken idiots.",2,1,
19,Queena T.,"New York, NY",119,376,214,5.0,1/31/2016,"I'm a super light weight drinker and rarely finish cocktails but I pretty much downed their Nice Pear, it was that delicious. I prefer vodka cocktails over rum, gin and tequila cocktails but I don't come across them very often so I was excited to try the Nice Pear which was vodka, pear, lemon and rosemary syrup. Everything mixed well and I could barely taste the alcohol but it def kicked in after a couple sips. The hubs also had a couple drinks (strauss music and nero) which he raved about. We had the munchies halfway into our drinks so we ordered the ribs and fries - ribs were soft and tender, fries were regular fries but the aioli bacon dip was what made it stand out. I believe they're connected with Eli & the Wolf on the same street so the food is legit. Music on a Saturday night was also on point - 80s/90s hip hop. We came at 7:30PM and it wasn't crowded at all - the bar seating was just about all taken but the tables were all available. We were there til about 10PM and it got adequately full but not super packed and you could still hear yourself talk without shouting. Cool spot to hang out, can't wait to come back and try another cocktail.",1,,
20,Megan S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",9,5,0,5.0,1/11/2017,"One of my favorites on avenue C, great drinks and amazing bartender Max. I've been here so many times my friends and will keep coming back. If you're in the village find your way to the Third Man",1,,
21,Liz W.,"Austin, TX",50,100,1,4.0,12/4/2016,"We go here for drinks occasionally, and it's always on point. Delicious cocktails. Friendly and attentive bartenders; who make drinks to your taste. Cozy ambiance at night. Light snacks from Edi and Wolf down the street (so it takes some time). On the weekends, it can be super crowded, but often there are still seats even at peak times!",1,1,
22,Shaina M.,"New York, NY",153,30,2,5.0,2/22/2017,"I came here for drinks after dinner on the night to celebrate my birthday with friends. There are two big booths on either side of the door when you enter. There is seating around the bar and along the walls as well. The bar was not crowded at all for a Saturday night. And the music was awesome! It was 60s/70s music that just made you want to get up and dance around. The drinks were fantastic. I started with some of their specialty cocktails such as this pink one (cant remember the name) and one of the old fashions. Both were delicious! Then, I switched to gin and tonics made with Hendricks. The bartender was knowledgeable enough to include cucumbers in them. They were made very well. Needless to say I was pretty drunk and had a great night out. I would highly recommend this place for a fun time with friends.",,,
23,Yoonie Y.,"Manhattan, NY",59,363,4,3.0,2/15/2015,This place could be amazing. The cocktail menu is great and the drinks are really affordable. The space itself is really beautiful. But the wait to get drinks is extremely unreasonable. I think they need to figure out a better way to manage the crowd here because they were probably over capacity by 50-75 people. The line to get up to the front to get a drink was probably 20 minutes and then another 10 minutes to get noticed by the bartender and then another 10 minutes to close your tab. I'm not even exaggerating! Definitely don't go here for a first date or bring anyone you need to have a conversation with because you'll just be pushed around all night.I'm sure this place is lovely on a weeknight but I'm going to stay far away on Friday and Saturday nights.,,,
24,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,3.0,1/19/2014,"Decent bar on Ave C. Bartenders are pretty good about making drinks strong. It's never terribly crowded and you can have a pretty fun time with friends and not worry about finding a seat on a weekend night. That being said, the space is sort of cramped together, so while you might not be surrounded by a lot of people, you still might not have that much space around you. Everything is decorated similarly to Bua on St. Mark's: rustic with a slight divey twinge. I will say the beer selection here isn't great and they'll run you about $8-10. At those prices, you might as well get some of the specialty cocktails, which are about $12. I've never had the small plates here, and while the food menu sounds good, I'm not one for bar snacks costing more than $5, so probably won't be ordering food from here anytime soon.Come here if you're in Alphabet City and you want some strong, delicious cocktails and you don't want to deal with large East Village crowds.",4,1,
25,JW C.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,92,4,1.0,10/26/2016,"The bartenders were fairly rude. Service was really slow and cocktails weren't anywhere near wow! It was just uncomfortable inside, stuffy and crowded.",,1,
26,Aubrey J.,"New York, NY",232,4,0,1.0,7/11/2016,"I had nothing but nice things to say about this bar until, after I left the bar for literally 5 minutes, I went back in to get my credit card and the bartender had WRITTEN IN his own tip on my credit card receipt (50% of the total). I said, ""hey, what is this, you wrote in your own tip""? And he said, ""there's a fee for leaving your card here"", to which I responded ""I left the room for 5 minutes"". His response was ""you got your card back didn't you?"", as to imply that he might not have given it back. The other bartender just leered at me and I felt uncomfortable and left. I hope they enjoy their extra dollar 50. They're complete and total jerks. Don't go there!!",2,1,
27,Laura G.,"New York, NY",166,187,32,3.0,9/5/2015,This bar is nice but not memorable. Ambiance is nice (shouldn't all bars have a relaxed ambiance though?) Drink was pretty strong but the bartender made it with not a lot in it. We were served smoked pepitas with our drinks which was a nice touch.They have a good happy hour. Good one to have in the back pocket for Alphabet City but I wouldn't come out of my way to go here.,,2,
28,Scott J.,"New York, NY",205,57,0,5.0,11/6/2016,"I almost don't want to write this review in fear it becomes too packed for me to get in. The best feature is its beautiful design. During summertime, make sure to snag an outdoor table. Even on the inside, there are some wonderful tables next to the window. Unfortunately, food is only available during a small window of time, but it's delicious, especially the ribs. Props to the great bartenders!",,,
29,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",556,2581,7,4.0,7/1/2015,"The Third Man sits deep into the Lower East Side, heck, pretty much right along the river. Its ample seating provides for a nice end to the evening; decent cocktails and drinks poured neat, both at your disposal.As it pertains to setting itself apart from most other clean-cut watering holes, the prohibition-style feel and the multi-sided bar-top do not quite make it more unique. But, I appreciate the vibe and the tucked-away location.If there ever was a good mix between a dive (in the sense that The Third Man provides an intimate ambiance) and a speakeasy (as TTM does not do much advertising), this joint would fit into that sweet spot.",,,1
30,Neness H.,"Manhattan, NY",128,69,29,5.0,12/22/2015,"I went there a bunch of times with my friends, it is a great place to talk catch up and enjoy a nice cocktails. Service is good it is not too loud or packed since the drinks are a little pricey for abc. The decoration and ambiance are great! I highly recommend that place if you are a small group of friends 2/3 looking to catch up and laugh while enjoying good drinks!",,,
31,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,5.0,11/22/2014,"Man, and to think I almost didn't make it here.Because you know, sometimes, let's be honest, Avenue C might as well be Siberia for some people (me), especially after a big dinner, when it's tempting to just pack it in, hail a cab, and jump into bed. But knowing we had friends going to The Third Man that evening, something drew us there and we walked off the calories to the far reaches of Alphabet City, thinking we'd do the right thing by being social and have a drink, maybe two, instead of the alternative, which was, of course, being fat-ass, shut-in losers.Well, we made the right damn choice. And for many reasons - the main one being that The Third Man is a fantastic little cocktail hideaway of a bar I would've probably never trekked to discover on my own. I was hooked on their Tennessee Waltz drink, as I'm a sucker for most Maker's Mark concoctions. This had a hint of vermouth and peach liquor that took the bite out of the bourbon, and was garnished with an orange peel for good measure. A Southern take on an Old Fashioned, if you will. The female bartenders here were exceptional, quick and professional and dedicated to their cocktail craft. So, I blew past that two drink limit I had set for myself, but I think we all saw that coming.I spotted a few first dates here, but it appeared the earlier is better for that type of meet-up, as the bar definitely gets packed as the night wears on, at least on the weekends. The Third Man is trendy, sure, but in a good way.Now, delicious cocktails and potential romance are all fine and dandy, but I need to take a stab at setting the scene for you here, as the layout is unique and hard to describe. But that, of course, won't stop me from trying. There are two booth pairings to either side of the front door - one fully outdoors like a patio, the other on the inside, but enjoyed with the windows up when the weather is warm enough. The glass facade creates a very open feel for such a small space. And the U-shaped bar dead center dictates the crowd to snake around it. In short, it's lovely, and would otherwise be tight quarters had the designers not made the most of this here square footage. That, and it should put the OCD-minded drinking crowd at ease knowing how super symmetrical this place must look in blueprint form, like an overhead view of one of those dungeon rooms in Zelda or a perfectly put-together Tetris set-up. Otherwise, this place has probably nothing to do with video games.You know what? I'm just gonna leave this right here:_______________________________________|                |                                  |                ||                |                                  |                ||                |                                  |                ||                |                                  |                ||                |              Bar              |                ||                |  _________________  |                ||                 ___    ___    ___    ___                 ||                                                                   ||                                                                   ||___                                                         ___||                                                                   ||      Inside                                    Inside      ||      Booth       |    ----------    |       Booth      |-------------------  Front Door  -------------------|     Outside          ----------          Outside     ||      Booth            ----------            Booth      ||_____________|    ----------    |_____________|(And in the event the above diagram looks all jacked up on your browser, you'll just have to trust me when I say it's as straight as an arrow on mine.)Anyway, if you're anything like me, and love symmetry almost as much as you love cocktails, well, The Third Man offers a top-notch dose of both.",17,14,9

Not so sure about the penis lamps though.  Bathrooms at Edi & the Wolf were awesome!  Here, just pretty good.  But they do have Meyers soap!!!  Awesome soap.  Seriously.  Sounds weird.  But trust me.  If they put this attention into their soap, you know they take care of the rest.Please check it out now.  B/c later it'll be too late.  It'll turn into Edi & The Wolf where you wait 45 mins for a table on a Monday night at 9pm.Very nice idea for a date night.  Cool loungey romantic laid back.

With a serious focus on cocktails, this bar has a really sophisticated aesthetic and warm atmosphere with its exposed brick walls, and unique and interesting (and, sorry, but slightly questionably shaped) blown glass lighting fixtures.For my beverage, I had the Harry Lime (mezcal, green chartreuse, maraschino, lime). I really enjoyed this drink. It was potent, slightly smoky, and had the perfect amount of sweetness.",,,

It's a small space, so it can get a little crowded; however, there's plenty of cozy nooks to hang out in, plus it's a lot calmer than your clubby alternatives in the East Village or Lower East Side. As an added bonus, the cocktail menu features unlikely ingredients like celery juice, which is a nice break from all those vodka sodas you've been drinking.",1,1,1

The drinks aren't cheap, but they're well-made and there's an interesting selection so I don't think the prices are unreasonable. The Third Man is a good choice if you have a group because if you get a booth you can fit 10-12 people comfortably. The music is at a talk-friendly volume, the lighting is pleasantly dim, and the decor is cool without being too self-aware. I'm a fan!",,,

So we got drinks that we both would be able to try and enjoy.I liked E's drink better, the tasted worked better with each other and E loved it better than mine too.It wasn't packed since it was Memorial Day weekend, so service was good and you could hear each other.",,,
41,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1601,1308,3.0,7/13/2014,"Interesting serial killer meets barn atmosphere, but the service is glacial and the drinks are just ok. I did the wood, chemistry set glass lamps and trees, though the resting water in the vases has an unpleasant odor that doesn't enhance a cocktail. Be prepared to wait for a while to have your drinks made as everything contains on the order of 20 ingredients and takes 5 minutes of vigorous shaking. They are friendly, just very slow. The cocktails are good but not great and of the 6 we tried, none really stuck out or made much of an impression. I appreciate the German beer selection, but again, nothing was spectacular. Also, it may have just been the night, but the clientele was bizarre and contained many couples feeling especially amorous which was needless to say, awkward.",4,2,1

They need a door policy or more bartenders or something because it was SOO packed last night - definitely not a ""quiet drink"" as the times suggested.  Go during the week if you want to be able to hold a conversation and the option of getting one of the front big tables.And if you haven't bookmarked it yet...here it is on world's best bar list!! worldsbestbars.com/unite…",1,,
43,Mallory M.,"Peekskill, NY",98,2,0,5.0,9/11/2016,"I have only one word to describe my experience here.....spectacular. I went in on a Friday night because I am a big fan of cocktails, and I heard that this place was the cream of the crop. So I was approached by the bartender Max and I asked him to make me a drink. He was an absolute magician behind the bar. It is just great to see people that have perfected their craft the way Max has. I could not have been happier with my experience and I highly recommend this bar to everyone.",2,,
44,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,390,60,5.0,12/20/2013,"Hello, lover. So it was an absolutely freezing evening in NYC. I was all ""hot toddies, please."" But I really wanted to try something new, and all my old favorites just get so crowded. What's a girl gotta do to get a hot cocktail and a cozy armchair in this city? Make it herself at home?? Not an option. But.NY Mag had done an article on best winter bars, so like any self-respecting New Yorker, I jotted notes about the best looking places into my iPhone. I had this little list and picked The Third Man because it was closest to my apartment and also boasted hot mulled cider. I went with my bestie JAK. We literally couldn't bundle ourselves enough to be warm on the way to the bar. But that's okay because once we were inside, it was toasty-city. It was very rustic, wood, steel, more wood. A U-shaped bar right in the middle and a few cozy booth-like tables spotted around. There were two empty booths so we grabbed one. It was pretty awesome. It was all snuggly and raised off the floor, which always makes me feel just a little more tucked away. No waitress service, but that's okay with me, my legs arn't broken. The menu had quite a few drinks I would like to try, but of course I went with one of my top two winter favorites, hot mulled cider with whiskey. JAK got the same thing. It was really, really hot. We definitely couldn't drink it right away. Which was fine, because even though the bar was super warm, my hands were still cold, so I wrapped them around my glass. When I could finally try it, it was really good. No frills, classic and well flavored. It also had a really great whiskey to cider ratio, which is always a concern. Too much whiskey really ruins your hot cider. Not enough whiskey is a like child's play. These bartenders got it right.We sat for quite some time with our drinks. The noise level was low, great for conversation, but not so quiet you could hear the guy across the room from you sneeze. The patrons were friendly, everyone seemed to have the same purpose: warm up with booze. When we were getting ready to bundle up again and head back out into the cold, it was definitely far more crowded than when we first got there nearly 2 hours earlier (we arrived around 10PM on a Saturday). I'm a bit fearful about adding another five star review to The Third Man, because I'll bet you by next winter you can't get in, much less get a table. For now, I will enjoy the welcomed cozy wintery bar while it's still relatively easy to get a table. Cheers, Third Man. You won my hot cocktail loving heart.",17,6,12
45,Leigh C.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,215,174,4.0,12/7/2014,"This place was great! It is a really nicely decorated cocktail bar in the East Village that is the perfect spot for a date. The decor has lots of nice little details, such as the felt on the bar stools, or the candles in the bathroom. One... interestingly shaped item is the light fixtures. I can't imagine why someone would think those were a good idea, but they're not obnoxious enough to detract from the overall aesthetic. The cocktails are good and interesting. I ordered a vodka pear drink, but got it instead with gin and it was quite good. I'm not sure if is was $13 good though. You be the judge.",,,
46,Ranu R.,"New York, NY",167,246,33,4.0,7/7/2014,"This is a great little cocktail bar on Ave. C and a nice compliment to the other bars in the area (Summit, The Wayland). Bartenders are always friendly and the atmosphere is extra cozy during the winter (though in the summer, they open their windows, so it's a nice place to sip a cocktail year round). The bar itself is a spacious u-shape with plenty of seating, and there are cushy booths lining the front wall. Cocktails are between $9 - 12 so typical EV prices, but the drinks are well made. On Sundays, they have ""Wolf Hour"" from 6:30 - 8 (a nice little discovery) where cocktails are around $8 and beers are $5. The Cuckoo Clock is a solid cocktail.It's in my regular rotation and definitely worth a stop in for a drink on a date or with friends.",1,,
47,Allyson B.,"New York, NY",10,29,3,5.0,7/14/2016,"Besides the amazing happy hour Monday thru Thursday and the excellent drinks and cool atmosphere it's a win. However, Mike the bartender makes the entire place. He makes a mean drink and a warm environment. Always a smile and knows his way around a bar and a quip. He's quickly become our favorite go-to guy for an excellently crafted drink. Watch him mix 3 drinks with 3 different spoons at the same time while shaking another at the same time in his other hand. This isn't your typical mixology place where it's pretentious as hell. Get to know Mike and the place will get to know you",2,,
48,Ashley S.,"New York, NY",84,29,0,5.0,9/13/2015,"Always love chatting with the bartenders here, and if you're a whiskey drinker you MUST try the Tennessee Waltz cocktail. Great service and lovely interior decor as well.",1,,

50,Eric C.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",307,11,0,5.0,8/14/2015,"I went here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon and had an amazing time! The vibe of the bar is rustic and really cool. The bartender Max is really cool guy and made us some of the best cocktails I've ever had. I was a big fan of the Copacetic,Tennessee Waltz, and Velvet Revolver. I was a little skeptical to try the Velvet Revolver because the idea of egg white in a drink seems a bit odd to me. Believe it or not, the egg white is actually a great touch and makes the drink frothy and delicious. If you are looking for a fun/relaxing cool bar with great drinks and great staff, I highly recommend The Third Man. Go try it out for yourself!",1,,
51,Michelle S.,"Brooklyn, NY",245,100,13,3.0,7/16/2013,"I came here with a client at around 7pm on a Friday. We were literally the only two people in the entire place. A little awkward, but the place has kind of an Estonian-castle vibe so I dug it anyway.I had the Fool of Berries which is probably one of the most scrumptious cocktails ever. It basically tastes like a thin fruit smoothie with just the slightest hint of vodka. Dangerous. Also tried the Lime something-or-other. Also delicious, but the Fool of Berries has got to be the creme de la creme of the place. I thought the service was great, but then again the two of us were the only people in the entire establishment. Let's hope the service was good.I will say this though- i've lived in NYC for two years-- Saturday morning I had one of the worst hangovers of my life-- these drinks are so tasty they're legit lethal.",3,1,2
52,Paul S.,"Brooklyn, NY",401,147,0,1.0,2/8/2013,"There are several reasons to go to The Third Man:* you like being ignored by your waiter* you like being ignored by the bartender* you want them to screw up your table reservation* you like paying too much for drinks* you like paying too much for improperly made drinks* you think it's cute when a bar doesn't have standard ingredients* you don't mind waiting for the barstaff while they serve their coworkers drinks* you believe credit cards are a scamI was dragged here by a group of friends. I won't be back. The service is terrible, it's too loud, the prices are high, and the drinks aren't made correctly.Since they didn't have ginger beer, I couldn't order a dark and stormy. They didn't have ginger syrup, either, despite it being part a featured item on their menu. I ordered a margarita. After 10 minutes, we discovered the bartender had forgotten our order. We ordered again.When the drink arrived, it was clear he either didn't know how to mix drinks or simply didn't give a shit. He salted less than half the glass, used table salt, didn't give me a lime.Despite having a fancy computer-based point-of-sale system and an average price of over $12 per drink, they can't be bothered to take credit cards. I heard some lame excuse about Hurricane Sandy. They managed to clean out the entire venue, get power, a phone line, a computer and alcohol. Yet they couldn't be bothered to fix their existing system or get Square. I don't buy it. I can understand when a dive bar selling $2 PBR or a corner bodega doesn't take credit cards. They have no excuse. They just want to keep the cash under the table.By the way, don't order a Radeberger -- it's $8, comes from a can, and they don't even give you the whole can.It's not that I'm opposed to expensive cocktails -- I'm happy to go to Bourbon and Branch (SF), Violet Hour (Chicago) or Angel's Share (here in NY) and pay for quality. Here, you're paying for well ... not much.",15,17,11

The fool o berries with fresh blueberries was awesome too. The bartender definitely knew what she was doing.... she was so intense while shaking the drinks she literally splashed me every time. She also popped a prosecco cork right into my fool o berries... The best part was, she was super nice about it and didn't charge me for it.All in all, drink are reasonable, $12 for specialty drinks. Worth it since they are done well. Ambiance is very chill, laid back. We were here on a Saturday and it wasn't packed wall to wall like some other places on Ave C; there was actually room to move.I would definitely come back. in fact, I'm looking forward to it.",1,,
55,Leslie R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,9,1,2.0,5/2/2015,"Good music. Cool ambiance. Dick bartenders - they all seem drunk and like they are more interested in hanging out with each other than doing their job.

Getting the bartender's attention took way too long, esp. since 2 people sat down next to where I was standing at the same time but they got all the attention. I did enjoy the drink (Spirit of 49 w/ bourbon, lemon, honey, bitters) and at $12 (before tax) a relative deal, friend chose something off the short beer list.

The crowd skewed towards groups of guys (which I normally avoid, but we settled in at a raised ledge next to the bar and tried a few cocktails.The menu isn't extensive, but they do have a good range of both sweet and savory choices. The preparation time is pretty fast and the presentation is good too. You kind of have to struggle to get the bartender's attention, but once she sees you the first time she'll take good care of you.The prices are standard for craft cocktails ($14+) but when we went they only took cash so keep that in mind when you walk past an ATM on your way to a decent drink.Have fun.G",1,,

The people helping me plan the event were very courteous and answered all my questions. They closed the bar early for us and we showed up to find a beautiful space with a wonderfully set up bar and ambient lighting. The drinks were awesome and the bartenders were great about giving recommendations. They even let a few of us behind the bar to try our hand at making some of the cocktails. We also ordered some small plates (the portions were tiny but they kept coming so no one was hungry). They also provided some complimentary punch for us. We stayed for three hours and had a blast! I can imagine this place must get busy on the weekends but, if the service and drinks were as great as they were for our party, I'd bet it's worth a visit.",,,

68,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0,3.0,12/11/2013,"This cocktail bar is like going on a date with a girl you met in the Meatpacking. Looks great and inviting but once you sit down for a drink you realize there's not much more going on there and to be honest theres tons of girls like her around the corner so whats the big hype about? If I was to open a cocktail bar I wouldn't open it within a block or two of Summit, Wayland, or Evelyn on Avenue C. Thats like opening a steakhouse down the street from Peter Lugers....unwise to say the least. The drinks here are quite pricey, $12 compared to other places in the neighborhood with a lot less to drink and the quality being subpar as well. A dark german beer in a wine glass sets you back $10 as well. Excuse me? Dark German beer in a wine glass? That confused me more than hanging out in the West Village during Pride weekend.The atmosphere is the only redeeming focus of this bar, its very cozy and homey and this is a great date spot with obvious touches of decor being inspired by its sister restaurant down the street, Edi and the Wolf. If you are a cocktail afficianado like myself, stop by so you know the deal for yourself. Otherwise steer clear of this imitation and save your libations and proclamations for the experience of the ultimate sensation. Yeah I rhymed and that made no sense.

They weren't impressed by the service and preferred drinks from a bar down the street, so they warned us off it. Having worked in the industry in the past, I decided the bar was probably past it's opening pains and wanted to give it a try. We swung by last night hoping for a cocktail or two. My husband stayed outside as I went in to order. There weren't many people in the bar, but the bartender seemed busy. She didn't acknowledge me, but we caught eye contact when I walked in. She knew I was there. I waited for about 10 minutes while she made other patrons drinks. Finally she sent over someone who I assume was the barback to take my order. I ordered two drinks, and the barback told me to go on outside, he'd bring the drinks to the table. So we waited outside for 10 minutes. People were leaving the bar, but no drinks were coming out for us. We waited another 10 minutes. I looked inside and saw the bartender clearing drinks from tables, so I knew my order wasn't on it's way.  I went back inside. The barback was totally absorbed in his electronic device. The bartender looked up and asked what she could help me with and I said I was looking for my drinks. For one moment she looked at me like I was utterly insane, then she looked at the barback who was just pulling his nose out of his phone. I told her to forget it. I'd already waited over half an hour. Normally I'm pretty forgiving about things since I was in the biz for years, but when it comes to people being on their cell phones...that's just crappy service. Maybe we'll try The Third Man again in 6 months time, but there are so many great bars within a block or two (ie The Wayland, Louies) that we don't need to go back anytime soon. Besides, what are we supposed to tell our friends? We couldn't even get service, let's go spend our money there. I think not.",1,1,1
