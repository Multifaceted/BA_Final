0,Jason P.,"Baton Rouge, LA",89,18,0.0,5.0,11/19/2018,"We dropped in for lunch after some site-seeing in the Financial District. The atmosphere is very classy & hip. Our sever Daniel and his manager Philippe took exceptional care of us & helped my kids decide what to eat.  We all ordered the 3 course lunch special. The French onion dumplings were very tasty. I ordered the Beijing Chicken, which seemed to be everyone's favorite. The kids had beef & broccoli, the wife had lettuce wraps. We finished off with ice cream and red velvet cake. All the food was great!   I'd love to come back for dinner on the next trip to NYC & try one of the steaks!  If you're in the area, don't hesitate to stop here!",,,
1,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,576,74,5.0,11/19/2018,"WOW! This is an UNEQUIVOCAL #MerlinFIVE, no caveats, no qualifications. Brooklyn Chop House is the latest creation of Manhattan restauranteur Stratis Morfogen, famous for creating Phillipe (""I created Phillipe,"" he commented to me one day on ""IG"" out of the blue) and other establishments. As many of you know, I tend to develop a ""kick"" for a certain dish that lasts the better half of the year, and I go in search of the best version of it: burger, prime rib, and of late, Peking duck, and lobster. After trying several establishments around the city, I'd settled on Phillipe as the best place, inching out Hakkasan (bad P2P -- price to portions -- ratio) and Decoy (overrated) and planned to never go anywhere else for my duck needs, all while debating whether it was 'problematic' to think that the best Peking duck is actually at Western-owned establishments.BCH edges out Phillipe, though. The duck quality is neck in neck, but what distinguishes it is a deep bench of incredible 'fusion' side dishes like French onion soup and Philly cheese steak-flavored dumplings (sounds gross, but it's not); baos; and lobster fried rice. Contrast that to Phillipe where there are much less exciting appetizers (not much different from typical Chinese takeout stuff) but marked up like crazy with bad P2P. Atmosphere is semi-vibey club feel but not enough to make you feel like a complete dork. There's a nice ""mafia"" corner in the back with a huge-ass TV that I want to rent out for myself one day during a high-stakes laker game.Stratis is a really nice dude. You will likely see him overseeing the restaurant, and he will come talk to you and chat about the wonders of organically connecting to customers over social media.",,,
2,Anna V.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",0,11,2,5.0,11/19/2018,"I've been to BCH for both lunch and dinner st this point, and it has yet to disappoint. I love that everything from the plates to the napkins and glassware is branded (makes the entire experience feel more thoughtful). I had the chicken satays, pork dumplings, lettuce wraps & French onion soup dumplings - can't say I have any one favorite, but I definitely will be back to try the steaks. In terms of service - no complaints there either! The GM, Philippe, came over to personally check on  us throughout the evening. The only real ""complaint"" would be that the glass my cocktail was served in was taller than the straw .. so the straw would get submerged into the cocktail & I had to fish it out ... but that really isn't enough for me to deduct a star for. Will be back",1,,
3,Asiah C.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,318,165,5.0,11/11/2018,"Simple dishes that are flavorful. Thats the key to success . Service was so good. From the bartender to maitre'd. I came in with a dead phone and though the bar didn't have chargers the greeters station did and he happily took my phone to charge! I had been wanting to cone here for so long since I saw someone go to the opening weekend. What drew me in was the 10$ top shelf drinks! This place treats you like an adult, no inferior quality spirits! I decided on a mixed drink. I must say they are worth every penny as they were strong and well made.It was very hard for me to settle on what to eat. So i went with the bok choy, Crispy duck taco and seafood dumplings. A customer next to me had the reuben and it smelled yummy. The decor is divine and the ambiance is mix of elegance and casual. I cant wait to go back!",1,,1
4,Leah S.,"Cincinnati, OH",183,179,363,4.0,11/5/2018,"I was excited to try this new spot in Fi-Di and enjoyed the experience. Cocktails were good, we had the lychee martini. Appetizers were tasty with the fun and delicious PAC-man dumpling and chicken satay. The main course was salt & pepper shrimp and lobster fried rice and both were good. Finally, the red velvet cake was moist and DELICIOUS! Highly recommend it.",2,,1
5,Hieu H.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,564,485,4.0,11/13/2018,"A steakhouse that serves dim sum?!  What an interesting combo!  We ordered both!Came last Saturday for brunch and service could use some refinement.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as polished as it could have been for a restaurant of this price point. We were told dishes would arrive as soon as they were done, but instead arrived altogether so there was a lot of wait time. for dim sum, I had...the pac man dumplings - these are the rainbow dumplings that are all over instagram and why I came here.  just ok, more for show than anything else the cheeseburger dumplings - steamed shumai-style dumplings filled with a hamburger mixture and cheese.  very interesting concept.  I actually really liked the cheese on top lobster fried wontons - this was a miss and at $19 for six wontons, I would say skip.  The filling​ was dry and lobster was too fishy french onion soup dumplings - these were surprisingly addictive. Impressed with the novelty of getting french onion soup inside a dumpling.  I wished there was more than just broth. It would help to have some type of meat filling too beef scallion noodles - thin noodles, your average text book dishchicken flat noodles with bean sprouts - I love flat noodles, so I ate this up short rib bao buns - a little one note, I think these needed a pickled veggie or something tart to cut through the richness of the short ribWe also had the bone-in dry aged rib eye that arrived sizzling to the table​ served with a sweet sauce and fries which were a disappointment​ The fries were like little stubs instead of the usual long ones.  McDonald fries would have been better. Needless to say our bill was close to $300.  Definitely more expensive than your typical dim sum meal.  There is an all you can eat dim dum option for $29 but it doesn't really include the signature dumplings.",3,,1
6,Ayesha A.,"Brooklyn, NY",348,414,635,4.0,11/8/2018,"Came here last night to celebrate a birthday and I must say this was a good choice on my part. After reading a bunch of reviews I was ready to come and have a really good experience for me and the birthday boy. Made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and our table was ready when we got there and was promptly seated. After we sat I was asked if I wanted to check my coat which I gladly did. We were given food and drink menu. I usually like to get a cocktail with my dinner but I was a bit disappointed by the limited specialty cocktails. Nothing really interested me but they have a fully stocked bar so I ordered an apple martini which was made perfectly. For starters we ordered the Pac-Man seafood dumplings and the chicken satay. Each dumpling had a different seafood in it. They were all delicious and cute to look at. Would recommend that. The chicken satay on the other hand was bland. We asked for the peanut sauce to be on the side because birthday boy is allergic to nuts and I told the waiter this and asked for it to be on the side. I had some of the sauce but even with it, it didn't add much to the taste.For the entrees we got the crispy beef and the braised short ribs. The portions were healthy and they both were delicious. We also got a side of shrimp fried rice that came out in a metal canister. There was a good amount of full size shrimps in the rice which was great. Now onto dessert. The dessert menu is extensive! I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant with that many choices for dessert and I was loving it. Decided on the apple crumble a la mode. The waiter brought the dish out with a sparkler for his birthday which was a nice touch, even though the sparkler kept falling over which was pretty funny. Remember when I said earlier the birthday boy was allergic to nuts. Well the apple crumble had pecans in it! Which was not stated on the menu. I guess the waiter didn't remember when I mentioned it earlier in the night. Luckily because of the sparkler he was able to see that there were pecans in it. I didn't realize that until I bit into one. Fortunately, he's not severely allergic so he could just move around the nuts but he had not realized and ingested one it would not have been a fun way to end the night. Dishes with nuts should be noted on the menu since nuts allergies for some can be deadly. All in all in was a great night, good drinks, great food, good service. I would recommend and come back again.",1,1,3

Brooklyn chophouse serves up delicious Asian classics with a twist such as the French onion soup dumplings and pastrami dumplings, sounds strange but it works and it's absolutely delicious. On top of that you can get traditional Asian foods like noodles while having dry aged steak. Definitely a hit in the city, makes for a great lunch, brunch, dinner, or date spot!",1,,
8,Laurie E.,"Manhattan, NY",159,55,125,5.0,11/10/2018,"Omg, Brooklyn Choo House is amazing!!!FOOD: We went on a dumpling craze and ordered 6 different dumplings and they are all amazing! The French Onion Soup Dumplings and Philly Cheesesteak were my favorites but all of them were delicious.SERVICE: Such wonderful service! Very attentive and helpful. We didn't know what to order and they patiently described all the different types of dumplings and the ingredients.VERDICT: I would definitely go back! Next time, I want to try their steaks!",,1,
9,Jerry W.,"Downtown Brooklyn, NY",11,23,73,3.0,11/18/2018,"Overall:This place is a brand new Asian fusion steakhouse concept in FiDi, with a ton of room for improvement in pretty much all aspects. Don't see myself going back any time soon or at all. Let's get into some details.Drinks:We tried the homemade mule, and this side of the bridge. Both were decent, nothing too crazy. ~$15 for most of their drinks. Appetizers:These are the highlight of the menu, and really the only thing worth coming here for. Very unique western flavors packed into Chinese dumplings. We tried the pastrami dumplings, bacon cheeseburger shumai, and short rib bao buns. Pastrami dumplings were very good, try them with the sweet soy sauce they give you, not the mustard (too strong of a flavor). Bacon cheese burger shumai were also pretty good, dip it in the ketchup. Bao buns were decent, but I'd rather go to Baohaus honestly.Note about the appetizers: If you want the quantity of things modified to fit your party size, get the manager because he's the one who's able to make it happen, the servers might not honor your request. Entrees:We had the bone in rib eye, the spicy velvet chicken, and the steamed black bass. For sides we had the soft shell crab crispy rice and bok choy. The rib eye was supposedly dry aged for ""50-60"" days according to the menu. You really only get any dry aged flavor on the edge of the steak, but you'd expect a steak aged longer than 28 days to be pretty funky throughout... Quality of the meat and the cook were pretty good though, good crust and pretty decent flavor nonetheless, just wish it would tasted more dry aged. Steak was good, not great. The spicy velvet chicken was truly disappointing. It was some strips of chicken sautéed with some veggies in a bland sauce. Also not spicy at all, and for $26? Seriously?The steamed black bass was also so disappointing. It was some pieces of steamed, dry, bland fish, with a black bean sauce that left a ton to be desired. The rice was good, nice flavor combos. The bok choy with garlic was actually amazing. Super rich garlicky and fresh flavors. Service:Honestly, this was the worst part about the whole meal. Our server Daniel was very rude and unhelpful the entire time. Every time we asked a clarifying question about the menu, it seemed like he had something better to be doing with his time. We were a party of 4, and wanted 4 bao buns instead of 3, and he made it seem like it was an impossible feat and that we were ridiculous for even asking. Later on, the manager Stratis came to us and he was able to make it happen, and he was super nice and helpful. Aside from this, service was generally pretty slow, things were slow to be served and cleared. Although the servers, busboys, and other FOH staff were constantly running around, things were still slow somehow. One other thing that was laughably bad was that they brought out our check inside of their dessert menu... who does that?Ambiance:This inside of this place is really nice and trendy actually, which is a shame because of how much work needs to be done still with the whole experience. One thing I do have to say is that the dining room is located half a level up and a bit away from the door, so from the outside looking in, the place looks empty. Another thing is the layout of the tables. There were people constantly running into each other in certain spots of the dining room.",,,
10,Scott M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,1,4.0,11/16/2018,"Great addition to FIDI. The concept of mixing traditional diner staples like French onion soup and pastrami with dim sum sounds aweful at first glance... it's fantastic. Same goes for fried fish with bou bun sandwich.  Can't say enough about the food here.Bar service is.. just ok. Friendly enough bartenders but newbies that lack experience. There are quite a few French guys with names like Jean-claude sporting turtlenecks and man buns... nut if you can put that aside, great place!",1,,

12,Gabriella N.,"New York, NY",92,13,4,1.0,11/11/2018,"Don't waste your time going or making a reservation. It will not be honored. We showed up 10 min early for an 8:30pm reservation and waited until 10pm without being seated and then left. Went to host stand every 15-30 min to check on table. Host + Caleb kept saying the 645pm tables didn't get up yet and that they were escalating the people who have been waiting the longest. After an 1 hour and 40 min of waiting for our reserved table and spending $75 just on a two rounds of drinks while waiting. We felt it was best to cut our losses and leave.After reading reviews with similar situations, I'm glad we left before sitting down. It doesn't seem the service or food was worth it or got better after you actually got the table. We ended up having a lovely meal at one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood - Trading Post. Service was quick and food was delicious. I was hoping Brooklyn chop house would be a cool addition to the neighborhood but this place will be gone soon.... also I noticed the owner wrote a response to this review. We didn't even talk to him or even complain to host, we just left...",4,,

21,Emily W.,"New York, NY",215,98,80,2.0,10/23/2018,"Brooklyn Chop House is doing something unique which I definitely can get behind, but our experience was not amazing. I came with nine of my coworkers for lunch on a Tuesday (we made a reservation ahead of time), and we all ordered the lunch specials. Our server was really nice and attentive, making sure we never ran out of water which I appreciated. However, our lunch took nearly three hours, despite the fact that we took it upon ourselves to expedite the process by ordering dessert while we were eating our main course and by asking for the check as soon as as we started to receive our desserts. It definitely was not due to an understaffing problem, because the restaurant only had a handful of other guests in it while we were there. It may have been due to a problem with the water, because when I went to the restroom nothing in there was working. It would have been nice to get some sort of apology for the extreme delay, or at least an explanation from the waiter as to why things were taking so long.As for the food, I felt mixed about it. I ordered the French onion soup dumplings, the steak sandwich in a bao bun, and salted caramel ice cream. The French onion soup dumplings were really interesting! It definitely felt weird to have soup dumplings with such an unexpected filling, but I'm glad I tried them. The steak sandwich was disappointing. The meat was really tough and dry, and the dryness of the bao did not help. It could have been salvaged if it came with some sort of sauce (maybe like a garlic sriracha aioli). The ice cream was absolutely delicious! My coworkers who ordered non-sandwich main courses seemed really happy with their food, so there's that.I might come back to try some of their other dumplings because they sound really cool, but only when I have a lot of time to kill.",6,1,
22,Derek V.,"Washington, DC",30,42,39,5.0,11/1/2018,"My girlfriend and I took a trip to NYC last weekend for our anniversary and based on reviews I chose to take her to Brooklyn Chop House for our celebratory dinner and it was nothing short of AMAZING! Weeks leading up to our trip she mentioned how much she had been craving duck and so I decided to look for a steakhouse that also did a traditional peking duck and this is where we ended up. The entire night went so well from the moment we arrived. We were sat quickly and tended to by our waiter. We both started off with a glass of wine before our order was taken. We ended up ordering the 24oz rib eye steak as well as the 7lb peking duck, shrimp fried rice on the side. We knew the duck takes time to prepare but it was definitely worth the wait! The presentation of carving the duck was a plus for my girlfriend since she had never experienced it and the rib eye was cooked to perfection. The food was so filling that we had to pass on dessert this time but we will be sure to save room our next visit. Thank you Brooklyn Chop House for an excellent night, you helped make our anniversary a memorable one!",,,1
23,David S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/12/2018,"Had a fantastic night here with friends. We couldn't stop laughing at the nonstop entertainment that this restaurant delivered. Whether it was the bartenders messing up drink orders, the wait staff and bartenders yelling at each other, the trays of glasses spilling and shattering all over the floor, or the throngs of customers complaining about the experience, one couldn't stop laughing at the comedy of errors that this place was providing every second. Oh, almost forgot the tree in the middle of the narrow hallway next to the kitchen that every tray of food passed through. That thing must be clean right? I hope so, since every tray of food passed right through it's leaves.  As a few other reviews noted, we didn't sit for our ""reservation"" until about 9:45pm, even though we had an 8pm slot. Throughout this, the host (Caleb) explained to us that we couldn't sit because other diners were not getting up and that our reservation was clearly ""contingent on other diners leaving."" His best line, though, was telling us that our not sitting for our reservation on time was a ""first world problem."" Thanks for the update Caleb. After waiting for so long he promised us a round of drinks and said he would also bring menus for appetizers on him while we waited at the bar, but then never returned again.When we did sit, most of the food was fine, but nothing special. The crispy beef was disgusting. Not sure if there was any beef. I cut it open to see and the jury is still out on that one. One thing the restaurant did get right was the bill. They did not miss an item. They even charged us for items we canceled since they did not show up during our meal. To their credit, they did end up comping some drinks and appetizers. Although we did pay for some appetizers that we did not eat, so that could be a wash. Rather than argue the charges, we figured we would cut our losses and just leave. An incredible experience overall. Would highly recommend to anyone who would like to see this travesty of a dining experience.Looking forward to the owner (Stratis) insulting me in his comments, since that's what he seems to do to most people who write a negative review.",8,8,3

I am shocked that the owner below is lying about the situation that happened as I was sitting right next to the people when it happened and was conversing with them all night. He was definitely rude to the customers and not accommodating at all that is why they left. The customer is always right and I can tell this is the ""owners"" first restaurant as he does not know how to run one. Joke is on you sir.

As I arrived with my party of 3 I was told they were clearing tables and we would be seated shortly. Several ppl showed up around the same time or a little after and was told the same thing. We checked back in with the host around 8:30 and was given the same robotic response. ""We have diners from 6:30 who just paid but haven't gotten up yet"" I watched as many ppl were told the same thing and grew angry as time passed.. Here's the way the remainder of the night went:9:45 pm seated where we placed complete orders 5 mins into being seated.10:20 we received only one Caesar salad (ordered 2)10:40 shrimp and lobster dumplings arrived. The owner comes over shortly after with a complimentary salad and dumplings. We made sure to order main dishes at the same time of ordering appetizers. I expected the wait to be longer, however, by 11:30 we had grown tired of waiting. The owner Stratis Morfogen has to be the rudest person I've ever met. He seemed unfazed by me expressing this had been the worst dining experience I've ever had. He stated the food would be out in 2 mins. By minute 5 we decided to leave. We were also told we would be reimbursed for one round of drinks. It took them 10 minutes to refund $32, and again, the owner walked away in the middle of me asking why it was taking so long to refund $32. He instead decided to entertain a large party who were having drinks.With that being said, I'd rather wait in the lobby of a Red Lobster for over an hour than to ever walk foot back into this overbooked overrated establishment.",3,,

The drinks were okay, the cucumber cooler was refreshing, the margarita though was rather bland.My guest and I ordered four appetizers between us. We had two sets of dumplings(crispy pork and philly cheese steak), which were fine, the chicken satay (the peanut sauce was good) and we had the spicy tuna roll which was not worth the price. The worst part of the experience was that it took about two hours to have two drinks each and these appetizers, there was a party going on and it took over 40 minutes to get our appetizers.

31,Mitch C.,"New York, NY",3,75,1,4.0,11/4/2018,"Went to the Brooklyn Chop house with a small group for birthday brunch. The menu is quite extensive (12+ dumpling/wonton options alone) that we thought the dim sum brunch would be a great way to try all of these options and then re order the group favorites. Unfortunately you were limited to 5 options which was not stated on the online or in restaurant menu. The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were intense but good (one was enough for me), the crispy chicken wontons were addictive, the vegetable dumplings were different that what we expected but good and the pork fried dumplings were tasty but average (we are spoiled by having a Vanessa's dumpling nearby). The fifth option was the chicken with flat noodles which was very good and a nice change of pace. Drinks are reasonable at $8 and the sangria was quite strong. Service started slow (15 minutes to get our first drink) but ended strong with a complimentary cake with a crazy candle for the birthday girl and allowing us to take home leftovers. Since we were limited to only five options we tapped out a little early as we could only eat so much of the same items. Adding up what we got I actually think it would have been cheaper a la carte hahaI know the owners read reviews so I would recommend the following for brunch1) If the brunch is going to be limited include the first drink in the $29.99 otherwise it really is worth it to go a la carte2) open up the options to the whole dumpling / noodle options but limit people to order 2 items per person at a time as people's eyes are bigger than stomachs I'm sure we will be back to try more things",1,,1

Overall I thought the food was great. The service was a bit lacking and the food took some time to come out. It wasn't very crowded when we were there so I expected better service. I'll give them a pass as it's a fairly new establishment. I will definitely go again for the chicken skewers, the lobster fried rice and the onion soup dumplings.",,,

Ordered the dumplings and they were bland. The soup dumplings were meh. The bao rib item was average at best. The maitre'd and bar tender were nice. The rest of the service was slow and non-attentive.",3,2,1
36,Michael G.,"New York, NY",90,98,52,5.0,10/1/2018,I was here on opening night. It's two blocks from where I live so was excited to potentially have a new favorite spot.   I was by myself so ate at the bar - which was very comfy and had a good vibe. Service was quick and polite.  Was thrilled that when ordering a martini that they have blue cheese stuffed olives! Huge in my book.,,,

After experiencing the delicious food and wonderful service at the pop up in the Hamptons this summer,  I've been patiently waiting for the opening in NYC. After dining there this weekend I'm in love with the swanky atmosphere and consistently delicious food. A must dine on a date or with a large group!

40,Matt B.,"New York, NY",119,17,3,3.0,11/4/2018,"Good food, steaks were delicious. Service was all over he place (tried to deliver incorrect food to us several times, asked us if we wanted dessert before we got our main entrees, forgot about us for 20 minutes) but they apologized. Some quirks to iron out.  Over all it was more casual than we were expecting, especially for a steakhouse -  but overall menu wasn't too expensive. While the individual dishes were done well, there needs to be more actual fusion between Asian and steakhouse cuisines. A good concept, some more work put into it and it could be a good mainstay in FiDi",,,
41,Jennifer S.,"City of Orange, NJ",3,47,42,4.0,11/2/2018,"This was a very good steakhouse. When you walk in you can either sit in a classy lounge area or at the bar. I ordered the French onion soup dumplings. Amazing! I highly recommend because they are so cheesy. Also i ordered the scallion pancakes, pecking duck tacos and pork belly bao buns as starters. All were amazing. I also ordered the 24oz rib eye steak. The waiter and staff changed our plates very often and the service was great.",,,

43,Jeremy T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,0,3.0,11/17/2018,"I would give them 4 stars but it was just one thing after the other tonight. I had such high expectations for BCH. First interaction calling in was pleasant host said "" 9:15 we will have you seated no later than 9:30."" When I called. Nope that didn't happen we were seated and hour and 10 minutes later with a reservation. Numerous waitress came up told us not that much longer now turned out not to be the case. We were offered comped drinks for the wait. When we finally did sit down the waitress approached us instantly asking if we knew what we wanted to order maybe 5 minutes after. We ordered some apps and said needed some time. Well that where we went wrong when we did place our order our food didn't arrive till maybe an hour later. We were now at this restaurant for over three hours with no entrees. To top it off the began dimming the lights so much you couldn't see your food as our food was being served. The manager/owner did comp us wine and desert but sorry the entire experience wasn't pleasant at all and for such a high rated restaurant I expected so much more.Food was good, staff were pleasant and the communication is there just seems to be extremely disorganized with scheduling and managing of parties.Follow up: Stratis: your staff isn't the problem.The scheduling and making people believe they will be sat on time for dinner is. No other restraunt forces you to order all the items together like this especially immediately upon sitting down. I mentioned what you did and that was nice but that doesn't change my experience. Waiting three hours to eat dinner is ridiculous!!",,,
44,Declan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,1,0,5.0,10/30/2018,This place is fantastic. Friendly and attentive service from the bar to the dining room. Came here for business dinner. Only regret is that we were too full to order the full menu. Will be returning on a regular basis,,,
45,Ariel M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,11/14/2018,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!You can find better food at 99% of the restaurants in NYC. The service and atmosphere was HORRIBLE!!! We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and the host said he THINKS there is an available table. He then placed us at a table in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant is small and I knew right away seeing this table we would be in the way. Normally I would have asked to move but all the tables were in the way so there was no better spot for us. We were bumped into on all four sides of our table the ENTIRE time. If the waiters were not hitting our table as they walked by, they were basically leaning on it having a conversation with other staff. No food is enjoyable when every time you go to take a bite someone walks by and hit your elbow or pushes your chair. When it was thankfully time to leave, we could not even get up from our table because the waiters did not move for us!!! They were not even serving another table at this time, they were just having a conversation. We had to push out of the way to leave. RUDE staff!!! DON'T GO!!! You can spend less money and have a much more pleasant experience elsewhere, I promise. You will regret spending the money just like we did!",1,,
46,Gis C.,"New York, NY",0,22,10,1.0,10/5/2018,"I am appalled at what I have experienced upon dining at this establishment. Throw the whole staff away including the ""owner"" who was extremely rude. We saw bartenders fighting with waiters, customers screaming and getting up leaving unhappy...the whole staff was was just in shambles. The ""owner"" was going around bragging that it was his place yet everyone was telling him that they were unhappy with the service and he would just laugh it off. I have never seen anything like this. The food was not worth the mess I witnessed. Please go to Philippe, Buddhakan or Zuma instead, this place is a wannabe joke and will be closed soon the way they are running things.",10,1,
47,Adam A.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",9,3,0,5.0,10/26/2018,"Hot new spot! Went there for my birthday and enjoyed it alot! I loved the lamb chops and dumplings! Chris and Kim behind the bar, got the evening started right!",,,
48,Anna L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,6,3.0,11/8/2018,"So I made a reservation for 2 for Thursday night. The place was really busy but we were seated immediately, which was great. Tables for two were placed in the middle of already narrow room so there were waiter walking by us non stop the whole time we were there, which was about 2 hours. Also, the area where waiters congregated was also right next to our table so the swarm of them was walking back and forth and around through the entire evening. I mean, it was great not to wait for water to be refilled and table cleared, but damn! Too many people standing by our table all at the same time was a bit too much. Also, I didn't appreciate when our waiter asked that we order everything, apps and main course, at the same time since ""they were getting really busy"". I wanted another few minutes or so to study what seemed to be an interesting menu, but his insistence threw me off. I didn't like to be rushed, especially if it was my 1st time at this restaurant. By the time we left there were plenty of tables unoccupied, so his comment seemed weird. Now to the food... Philly cheese steak dumplings were fantastic! I really loved the dough; Cesar salad was nothing special and so wasn't my filet mignon sandwich (it said there were supposed to be onions in it and there weren't any..or I just couldn't see or taste them. Perhaps chef can dress up the sandwich a bit? It was  literally two buns, meat and cheese. That's it. Also since I was rushed to make a descision, I didn't see that there was an extra charge for adding cheese. Again, I liked the bready part of the sandwich the most). The highlight of the meal, besides dumplings, was the lava cake. Delicious! Will I be back? Perhaps to try the rest of the dumplings...but then again, I live on UES and probably won't make the trip down town just to visit this spot again.",1,,
49,Zach S.,"PECK SLIP, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/5/2018,"This 1 star review is for the service and experience at Brooklyn Chop House, not the food, because we never actually got served.Made a reservation for me and the GF at 9:30pm on Saturday (11/3/18). Got there right at 9:30, told our table wasn't quite ready yet. No problem, place was packed, really cool venue, happy to wait. A few minutes later another couple walks in, and a 2nd host seats them right away. He catches my eye when he comes back, I guess I looked a bit confused, and he says ""you didn't want the table I gave them, very crowded, not a good spot, we're going to get you guys a much better table."" Sure, ok, bit weird to condemn anything about a newly opened establishment you work in, but I figured I'd take his word for it. A good 10 minutes later, the hostess tells us to follow her, takes us upstairs to back of the restaurant, and stops, because there are no open tables to seat us. She apologizes, brings us back downstairs, parks us by the server's entrance to the bar, and disappears.Close to 15 minutes pass, and she reemerges and says ""sorry, they're having coffee, and then we'll seat you,"" and then she disappears again. Doesn't offer us menus, doesn't offer even a drink while we wait, just vanishes again. At least another 10 minutes go by, and she finally comes back with menus, brings us back upstairs, and seats us AT THE TABLE RIGHT BEHIND THE COUPLE WHOSE TABLE ""WE DIDN'T WANT"" WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED. The bus boys are still cleaning the table, putting down silverware, etc...when we sit. Hostess leaves menus, and walks away. A waiter shows up, doesn't introduce himself, and asks ""what do you want to drink?"" We were never given drink menus, which we informed him of. He goes ""oh"", and comes back with ONE drink menu. He leaves, only to come back 30 seconds later and ask again ""what do you want to drink?"" I told him we only got one drink menu, so we weren't ready yet, and he goes ""oh"", brings us a 2nd drink menu, and then leaves. And never comes back. We sat for 15 minutes, and no one ever came back to take our order. So we left. It's a shame, because we were really looking forward to trying the food here, and the venue itself is really cool, if not a little cramped. But the service was so bad, it was impossible to justify spending the $$ when your experience is marred by frustration. It's simply not worth the hassle.",3,,

The French Onion Soup dumpling was an explosion of all types of goodness.....so yum! Since a lot of the items are made to share we ordered a few small plates along with our entrees. The garlic broccoli and the lobster fried rice!!! Delish!! From the drinks to our meal and our witty waiter we were in food heaven. I would definitely go back again because there are so many things on the menu that I want to try. Even though Im not a meat eater, I had a lot to choose from.

Our experience was ok and you could tell that this is a new restaurant and they are still working out some glitches.For example we ordered drinks when we first sat down and it took over thirty minutes to get our drinks and we got them after our meal had come out. Our waiter clearly forgot to go grab them because another waiter finally brought them to him and asked him where they needed to go and said they have been sitting at the bar for awhile.We also ordered a wedge salad to split. The salad came out very quickly but they forgot our dressing. We had to ask three people for dressing before it came out. We also ordered small plates to start, an entree and a side. Our entree came out very quickly and our small plates came out after our meal, which we think our waiter forgot to specify bring out small plates first then entree. All in all the food was good and we would give this place another shot. Our waiter was definitely new and just fully didn't know what he was doing. Hopefully they will have these small glitches worked out over the next few weeks.",,,

I had the chicken and my partner had the  shrimp; both portions were large, pipping hot. and delicious and were served with brown or white rice. The first course--we had the chicken satay and the spring rolls--was equally excellent. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake (too large a slice to even finish) and ice cream. And we had the martinis--large and made just right.The restaurant decor is warm and friendly and not intimidating as many such restaurants are.  The place settings were classic, the silverware appropriately hefty, and the water glasses were kept filled.

And got even more so excited when they posted a menu. I immediately knew what I was going to order for many meals to come. Went for lunch on opening day. Openings can be a huge hit or a huge miss. Understandably so. This was a huge hit. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and pastrami and cheese dumplings to start. Then a filet for my main. Everything was cooked to perfection and I enjoyed the last bite, as much as my first. I'm extremely excited this opened less than a block from my apartment. Congrats and cheers to many more meals to come!  And as a side note, the one owner I met, Robert C made us feel like family as I'm sure he will do the same for you!",,,
62,Phillip H.,"New York, NY",1,5,0,4.0,10/3/2018,"Let me start by saying that all the food we had was very tasty.  We got mostly dim sum items, so didn't try any of their steaks yet.  We will do that when we come back, because we liked this place a lot and plan to come back often.  All of the dishes we got were either good or great.  I'll rank them based on my personal preference: Chicken lettuce wraps, spinach shrimp dumplings, beef with scallion noodles, onion rings, broccoli, shrimp fried rice, chicken satay skewers, pastrami dumplings and cream of chicken soup.The atmosphere was nice and our server was very knowledgeable.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they still have some kinks to work out with their service overall.  I think we were there on the second day they were open, and they were still training wait staff while we were dining.  Not a huge deal, but it distracted from the experience and the overall attentiveness of the staff because our waiter was covering 3 large parties and was also pulling aside new staff to instruct them.Over time I expect this to correct itself, but I question why they didn't have fully trained staff prior to opening the restaurant.  There were times that we wanted to ask questions and no staff was available and the transitions between courses was pretty slow.  It took 10 minutes to get dessert menus after dinner, at which point it was kind of late and we decided to go home.Once they are up and running for a bit I expect this to turn into a trendy downtown spot that will always be packed, so glad we got to try it early on.  Look forward to coming back to try the rest of the menu.",,,

The service was excellent and the food is really great and creative and delicious. Not too pricey for the quality. We had several of the offerings from the Chinese inspired part of the menu as well as a delicious piece of perfectly seared filet minion sliced and served with rice.  Drinks were great and the owner Stratis is such a gentleman. He was on the floor all night making sure all of his customers are happy and that the food is good and that the servers are taking care of you.  It's impressive to see the owner also operating as the floor manager and adding his personal touch. The menu may seem a little eclectic, but the dishes are a good complement each other very well. I will definitely go back and recommend to others. Try it!",,,

69,A P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,6,1.0,10/9/2018,"This place horrible.  The owner/manager is extremely rude and arrogant. Had 9:30 reservations walked in was told there are no tables available. Mind you half the place was empty when I asked about the other tables the ""owner/manager"" said oh we have a big party they're going to be moving to those tables. It's up to you if you want to wait for them to move. I asked what about our 9:30 reservations he replied there's nothing available you can wait or go to the bar. Should've known better and left then. Ended up settling to eat at the bar. The whole time we were sitting he asked ppl how they liked their evening and one couple replied ""the service was interesting to say the least"". Also the arguments going on between the waiters and bartenders was ridiculous. The waiters were yelling to have the drinks made and the bartenders were yelling back. And when I mean they were yelling they were yelling loud at each other. The whole place seemed like a mess. While we were eating he was going around going to  tables and asking how the food was. I was eating and had my head down my gf answered it's fine and as he was walking away he made a smart comment towards be something along the lines of ""ok you don't need to answer jerk."" I was appalled and confronted him and asking what he said then tried to play it off like oh nothing I was just asking how it was... yeah right. As I was walking away I turned around and saw him laughing and mocking me so I decided to walk out. The food was horrible anyway so he did me a favor by giving me an excuse to leave. Save your money for buddakan or Zuma this place is a wanna be with a disgusting owner. Absuive to the staff? we took videos of the bartenders and waiters arguing to each other LOL.  I got up and left by myself why don't you show us some things to support your claims. You have video cameras in the restaurant why don't you post it here and show us where I was asked to leave. My wife apologized? She's the one who said let's leave. Your answer alone shows people what kind of manager you are. Every table was taken ? Then why did u take our 9:30 reservations  if you didn't have a table available?  Applauding ? Now we know you must be delusional people told me on the way out saying we should leave and how rude you were. The table we were conversing with next to us immediately asked for the check and left right away. Clearly I'm not the only one who didn't enjoy the service there look at every other review",3,,
