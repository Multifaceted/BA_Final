Once we got in, it was fairly classy and most people were dressed up. Ordered a Garnet Gimlet mocktail which was extremely sweet. Adding a shot of alcohol was basically the equivalent of a cocktail. Mocktails are $9 and cocktails are $17.Ambiance is really upscale. If you want only drinks, you can't go past the bar area.Novelty was certainly being located behind a pawn shop. It's a bit of fun for those that aren't expecting it.",1,,1
1,Edana N.,"New York, NY",0,18,7,3.0,11/18/2018,"3.5 stars. Came here with a group of 8 for Saturday brunch. We decided on brunch late the night before and they were one of the few restaurants who could accommodate such a large group at such late notice.SERVICE: Solid. Our waitress didn't come by often to check on us but she was sweet and explained the menu clearly. FOOD: Most of the food is meant to be shared, with the exception of a few dishes like the salmon and burger. None of us really feeling a tapas-style brunch, and since there were so many of us we'd have to multiples of an item if we all wanted to try, say, the avocado toast (which comes with three pieces per order). We decided to just each order our own dishes, even if they were meant to be shared. I got the burger, which is normal-sized and comes with BBQ-seasoned fries. The fries were good and served with both ketchup and mayo (in separate containers); the burger was meh. I got mine cooked medium but should've asked for medium well; it was a bit mushy and the flavor was lacking. I didn't end up finishing the burger. DECOR & AMENITIES: It's a beautiful place, if a little dark. In the main dining area, most of the light comes from the ceiling's massive skylight. It's also a little cramped - the tables are packed together and there's not a lot of room to move around.To get into the restaurant, you have to pass through the associated Pawn Shop, which sells everything from  jewelry to custom musical instruments. The bathroom here is gorgeous, and the front desk for the restaurant is a counter displaying vintage jewelry. All the aesthetic feels.NOTE: They won't seat you unless the whole party is present. We were waiting for a while and missing one person; they agreed to seat us if we ordered for the missing person at the same time as the rest of the table.It's a nice place, pretty and well-designed, but I probably won't be back for brunch. I do hear nice things about their drinks so I might come back for the bar at night!",,,
2,Janice W.,"Markham, Canada",246,70,49,5.0,11/13/2018,"Beauty & Essex is a must try when you're in New York! Definitely one of the highlights of my trip.HIGHLY RECOMMEND:1. Spicy salmon tartar It's barely spicy so don't let the name scare you. It's a salmon tartar on crispy sushi rice - such a heavenly combo. Do yourself a favour and try this.2. Grilled cheese smoke bacon soup dumplings SO. EFFING. GOOD. From the photo, it looked like scallops on a spoon and from the title it sounded kind of gross but this was one of the best things I tasted in NY. It's like a cheese ball with bacon sprinkles on a spoon of tomato soup, but better ?? 3. Eggplant pizza I wouldn't have thought to order this either but this was also really great. 4. Beauty elixir This one is a cocktail but it's super refreshing and tasty. I don't remember exactly what's in it but I remember it being really good. Lost track of how many times I said things were ""really good"" but trust me, you don't want to leave New York without trying Beauty and Essex. It's such a cool dining experience - you walk through a fake antique shop, and the food is amazing. There's also champagne in the washroom if you're into that!",1,,
3,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",202,215,342,3.0,10/19/2018,"Disappointing and very hyped up. Ambience is clearly great- I don't doubt it. Food is delicious as well ( Ofcourse when you add cheese and all the good stuff together) but not healthy and not worthy of the price. For the price I paid here, I would have expected exemplary dishes..on the healthier and fresher side. The wheel of desserts is just instagram worthy but none of the candies were even edible, forget being yummy. And guess how much that dessert is for-$32. It's a sham. I think since it's been in NYC from quite a long time hence it's so popular.. I do think that there are way better places giving better food, drinks and services around the city. I would not come back here.Also their cocktails are too sweet. I know my old fashioned well. Definitely not worth $17.",2,,
4,Yinglu W.,"New York, NY",1,212,198,5.0,11/10/2018,"Finally unlocked this place! Love it so much! This place was hidden behind a ""vintage store"", but it was huge inside with two floors and three dining rooms. My bf and I ordered Garganelli, Fish Tacos and Empanadas for share. Garganelli was a great mix of dry cheese and veels. Empanads were very tiny but the pepper sauce under them added some unique flavors.",1,,
5,Dana A.,"Queens, NY",26,99,188,4.0,10/22/2018,"Wow! Came here for my special birthday dinner. I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. I would recommend even sooner if you can as most time slots were already taken! We visited on a Saturday at 5:45pm. The place opens at 5 and it was already filling up!You arrive to what looks like an old pawn shop storefront with the beautiful glowing Beauty & Essex sign. When you walk in, its like a jewelry/niknak shop. Then you walk through the green doors into a massive restaurant. Its such a cool speakeasy vibe! We were taken immediately i gave my name. The ambience was a little louder than anticipated, and of course a bachelorette party was seated right next to us which was a bit irritating, but we managed. I loved the details within this experience so much. Its a very vintage/lounge feel. The bathroom was insane! It had a minibar and a lounge couch!Onto food and drinks. The cocktails are $17 each. regularly sized as well. I had the LES Crush which was delicious! Perfectly flavored. He got the black tie white noise. We were expecting this to be black based on the Yelp photos, but this drink arrived orange. The flavors were too woody for my liking. For apps we got the grilled cheese dumpling w tomato soup, and the octopus cassoleut. Both were delicious. The dumplings came out a little cold though. The octopus dish was basically like a chili, but im a sucker for chorizo which made it so tasty!I wasnt aware that the ""entrees"" were more of a tapas. For my entree i ordered the wasabi crusted tuna, he got the scallops. When both arrived i was shocked at the quantity.  I mean really these prices are insane and i left a little hungry still.  The scallops esp. They were $34 for only 3!! At least 4 like cmon. Granted these scallops were enormous, and were like butter so good! The tuna was good, a basic ahi tuna steak flavor. Before we left they gifted 2 mini cupcakes for my bday, which tasted store bought needless to sayThe service was great throughout! Our waitress didnt rush us out and was very patient with us. Overall, i do feel like this place is a bit overhyped.  For first timers, id def try to come for restaurant week or something. Or if i do come back, id either only come for drinks, or like 1 app and a burger being that the prices are insane!Apparently theres a party room upstairs also which i def would like to see next time as well!",,,
6,Robinsue B.,"Chicago, IL",142,41,47,5.0,9/29/2018,"Came here for my bachelorette dinner! The food was really good and so was the service. We did a bunch of small plates to share including the bone marrow, grilled cheese and tomato soup, chicken meatballs and some of the girls even ordered off the vegan menu. This place had everything for everyone depending on their dietary restrictions which made it perfect for a large group. They also serve champagne in the women's bathroom which is a bougie touch but we definitely took advantage.My only complaint would be that it was really loud and dark, but that's all part of their vibe. It was also pretty expensive but that's expected for a place like that in NYC.I recommend making reservations ahead of time as the place gets packed, especially on the weekend.",2,,
7,Sajal B.,"New Hyde Park, NY",135,86,201,5.0,10/1/2018,"This was a interesting spot to visit . Stumbled across it while walking on Essex street . Reservation were needed but they catered us . Also there's a dress code. First impression was like why is there a Security at the door of a pawn look a like shop . It seems like a shop in the front . Walked in and through a door and it was like walking into a different world . We were definitely under dressed . It was very upscale. If you want to splurge, this could be a spot for you .

8,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",289,742,387,3.0,10/31/2018,"The place is a happening.  Most of the food is excellent to amazing albeit very pricey.  Drinks are also very expensive.  Yeah I know it's Manhattan but I'm not sure how a Stoli costs $19.  I'd be afraid to ask what they charge for one of the more premium brands.  I thought our server was outstanding.  He was very helpful, pleasant, professional, and full of explanations.  Our tip was about 21-22%.  I know some people will tip more but that is still a lot of money with what they charge there and I bet they get people there who tip significantly less.  I sensed he wasn't happy with his tip since he barely said thank you at the end.  I may have misread that situation but I don't think so.  Who knows?  I would pass on ordering the rib eye steak again.  Normally, I wouldn't order it outside of a steakhouse but based on the place's reputation and the $63 price tag I was expecting something amazing.  It was good but no sizzle, no char, no heat.  I know I sound negative but we had a great evening.  The place is trendy and has a great vibe.  The small plate dishes were outstanding especially the Thai Shrimp, the Eggplant Pizza, and the Soup Dumplings.  That wonder wheel of desserts is a must have or is it a must see.  either way, order it!Oh yeah, for the women, make sure to visit the ladies room where they serve complimentary drinks.  If it wasn't for the disappointing steak, it would be 4 stars.",2,1,1
9,Patrick Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,12,9,5.0,11/10/2018,Beauty & Essex was a really discrete and mysterious location. You walk in through the front desk and it becomes like Alice in wonderland. Food was phenomenal. Portion was just enough. Drinks were perfect. Even though we were in a cramped up spot. The floor manager Ken Yoon and his team of waitresses definitely defined the word of hospitality for us.This place is  a hidden gem.Will keep coming back!,,,

11,Charles B.,"New York, NY",117,104,126,5.0,9/16/2018,"Beauty & Essex is such a great spot for birthdays! I took my husband here on Saturday for his birthday and we both adored the entire experience.The restaurant is very vegetarian friendly and have plenty of dishes that the staff can exclude the meat from.The menu is tapas style and the portions are pretty small; so I would recommend around five to six dishes for a party of two.What We Ordered:1. Chili Relleno Empanadas (the jalapeño-lime crema was delicious on this dish)2. Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta (great flavor and the whipped ricotta is to die for)3. Grilled Cheese & Tomato Dumplings (they taste just like a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup from when I was a kid)4. Lemon Pepper Ricotta Ravioli (so much flavor! I loved the asparagus and mushrooms in the dish)5. Yukon Gold Potato Purée (so creamy and so rich with flavor)6. Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp (these were for my husband, but he said they were delicious)For Dessert:1. LES, NYC Doughnuts (the dipping sauces are everything)2. Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Crème (so much deliciousness going on in this little dessert)The drinks and wine are fantastic at Beauty & Essex as well. If you like a good smoky drink I would try the O.D.B or the Merchant (my husband and I really liked both of these drinks.I would definitely visit Beauty & Essex again! They have so many more dishes I would like to try.If you are in NYC I would highly recommend checking this place out.Thanks for making my husbands birthday dinner very special.",1,,

I've been here before and knew what to expect, but the others have not. They were very impressed. The food was delicious and prepared to perfection. The drinks were done right. The staff was just the right amount of friendly and professional.  The only thing I didn't care for was the dessert. The things we lived most were the tomato soup dumplings of course and those who like raw fish loved everything raw! The surprise standout was the broccolini.",,,

14,Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",214,279,121,4.0,9/11/2018,I came here for a friends birthday and I enjoyed myself. Its a speakeasy and has a really cool vibe. I like this place because their menu and it has several options for vegetarians. I hate eating out because the menus are limited for places that aren't vegetarian based but i had no issue here. The place is relatively expensive but nothing too crazy. For 5 people the bill was 250 but we didnt get anything extravagant nor many drinks. It was okay though. 62 pp and paying for the birthday girl is not unreasonable but the portions aren't large. I dont think I would come back.,,,
15,Winston G.,"Cary, NC",36,128,125,5.0,10/26/2018,"I'm a sucker for unique spots with a bit of a twist and from the casual pawn shop entrance to the spiral staircase with fur lining the walls, this place fit the bill. Brunch here is phenomenol - you gotta try their cocktails and the Grilled Cheese Dumplings are by far the best item on the menu. My favorite part about this place is that it's all family style, you don't have to choose one item and stick to it because all the plates come in a sharing style. I'll definitely be back, both for the food and to run my hands through that luscious fur wall lol",,,
16,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2313,302,983,4.0,10/7/2018,"This was my 2nd time at Beauty & Essex and I liked it better than the last. We missed our reservation time but luckily got a slot for an hr later. Once there we had to wait a while in the bar area and thankfully caught a section in the sofas because it was packed. The cocktail menu is great, everything sounded really good. I tried the beauty elixir and it was amazing, I had 3 and would've gladly had more if I could lol. We were all blown away by the appetizers as well. We tried the dumplings, thai style deep fried shrimp, chile relleno empanadas and the BBQ fries. The dumplings were top 1 for us, they were served in a spoon with tomato soup - very cheesy and full of bacon flavor. Unfortunately it all went downhill with the entrees. My friends ordered the burger and hated it - they said it had an overpowering butter taste. My other friend wasn't impressed with the lobster mac and cheese. I got the Spaghettini and it was just okay - it was more herby than what I expected and very very dry. I don't think anyone on the table really enjoyed their entrees. We also tried the dessert wheel which seems to be pretty popular. It has a good variety of treats and I loved them all, especially the cake pops and the caramels.The restaurant itself is beautiful and its spaced out in 2 floors. I've dined in both but the 1st floor is much better. The music selection is bomb, I spent the night rapping to Cardi B. Service was great and extremely fast. I also love the fact that you can get champagne in the bathroom, just dont forget your ID and a tip. Overall its def. worth a visit!",25,10,22
17,Tanya M.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",8,37,33,5.0,10/23/2018,"This is the most adorable brunch spot. It's in an old pawn shop and they even still have items for sale when you walk in the front doors. Then you enter the lobby area and it's decorated with vintage decor. I absolutely loved it here. They had good music, a good vibe, and of course great food!! There was a brunch party going on upstairs on the Sunday that we went. We didn't stay long after brunch though because there was not a lot of room upstairs. I would love to come back here again when I'm in NYC. It was delicious!",,,
18,Janira H.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,75,188,4.0,8/12/2018,"I mean, I don't have anything negative to say about this place. It's beautiful and fun, their drinks are great and they have a rose bar in the women's bathroom and the bathroom itself is beautiful. My fiancé was jealous that the guys don't have something similar in their bathroom. It's also a very trendy, social media-photo-sharing-worthy type of place. You'll find most people dressed their best while you're there, so, if you don't want to feel out of place, I suggest dressing the part but no pressure. Oh yes, food, how can I forget about that part, right? Their food is served ""family style"" with the beginning of the menu being the tiniest portions and the larger or the closest thing to entrees will be found in the back of the menu. Just keep in mind their portions aren't large in general, it's more like tapas or appetizer size. It's best to get a few different things and share. It's great for dates, meeting and eating with friends and family. I suggest you make a reservation as soon as you know that you want to go, as they tend to be pretty popular.",1,,
19,Melissa D.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",165,37,85,5.0,10/12/2018,"You enter through a pawn shop secret door in the back and immediately are transported into glitz and glamour that is Beauty & Essex. Right when you walk in you are greeting with a beautiful and huge chandelier, mirrors, long draping curtains and bumping music. My group of friends had reservations (made 30, yes 30 days in advance) and were seated right away. The interior is absolutely gorgeous!I started with an Emerald Gimlet, which was Belvedere Vodka, basil, lemon nectar and fresh lime. Delicious, a little tart and packed a kick. I was feelin good! My friends liked their drink choices as well.The dish to try here is the Grilled Cheese Dumplings. Picture mini grilled cheese wrapped into a dumpling covered in bacon, nestled in creamy tomato soup in a large spoon. Absolutely fantastic, and every single table had an order on their table. For my main, I had the Garganelli, which was spicy veal Bolognese with whipped ricotta. The ricotta was sheep, which I don't love so I had to pick around that, but the pasta and sauce were very good. I also tried the chicken meatballs and I think they were the best chicken meatballs I've ever had! Still thinking about them a week later!We all split as sides the Broccolini (awesome sauce with a bit of a kick to it) and the Yukon Gold Potato Puree (yummy but typical mashed potatoes). Now on to my favorite part. Are you ready for this?...there is a ROSE BAR in the women's restroom. Free Rose! Just bring your ID and a tip. The bathroom was beautiful with mirrors, velvet couches, and a perfect place to sit with your ladies and sip some bubbly. The food was pretty good, but it was the ambiance that made me fall in love with this place. Will be back next time I'm in town.",1,,
20,Shawna B.,"Glendale, AZ",27,43,60,4.0,11/12/2018,"We came here while on vacation at the recommendation of a friend. The food was really good and not badly priced for the quality and atmosphere of the restaurant. Even though I loved the interior, I don't think I'd visit again it's very loud and you have to shout to the people sitting at the same dinner table. Not being from NY we weren't expecting that and probably should have looked closer at the reviews. We had our teenage daughter with us and it's probably a lot better for guests without kids.",,,
21,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",36,173,149,3.0,8/10/2018,"I always seem to like dessert the best at Restaurant Week meals, and this was no exception. The Cherry Sorbet with seasonal fruit (raspberry), coconut whip cream and coconut chips on top was delicious. I also had a taste of the dipping sauces that came with the donuts. Yum!The Kale & Apple Salad with apple cider vinaigrette, pancetta, candied pecans, shaved goat cheese was not bad. I missed the part about goat cheese, or I would have had them leave it out. They were amenable to taking out the pork, so I'm sure they would have taken out the cheese. This was a very large salad.The Peruvian Chicken with jalapeño salsa verde, sweet peas, carrots, zucchini & yellow squash was a little better. I'm spoiled by the salsa verde from Pio Pio, so I didn't think much of the salsa here, except that it did have a nice kick. I felt like the vegetables needed more flavor.",,2,
22,Charles K.,"Brooklyn, NY",226,348,513,3.0,8/10/2018,"If money doesn't matter to you Beauty & Essex is probably an easy 4 stars. Its beautiful, top tier NYC beautiful. Natural lighting during the day and subtle mood lighting in the evening. The service is quite good and so are the drinks. You can definitely tell the people working there know what they are doing. I started with the avocado toast which was good. Its avocado toast so its hard to be life shatteringly good but I liked it. For entree's I tried both the short ribs and the salmon. What I did notice is that the portion size vary quite a bit across the menu. The short rib portion was small and the salmon portion was sizeable. The shortribs were cooked well and the dish was tasty for sure. Wish there was a but more. So was the salmon and couscous, although it was pretty forgettable. To end the meal I had the sorbet. It was partially melted when it got to me but my main issue was it was super sweet and quite grainy like it was over-churned. Ultimately it was a solid meal, even considering the short comings here and there. Almost 4 stars for sure. The conflict at the end of the day was the value and I think ultimately for what I received I could have paid much less somewhere else.",,,

My husband has an Old Fashioned & I had a martini and soaked in the retro vibe. Don't worry if you can't snag a reservation we got in no problem on a Friday night.",1,1,1
24,Priss B.,"Towson, MD",31,15,6,4.0,11/11/2018,"We were told by the hostess to go upstairs to that bar because we were more likely to get a seat, but it was way busier up there so she must have said it to everyone for hours. But whatever, we were lucky to not wait too long before getting a couple of bar seats.Caesar toast was outstanding. Garganelli was bomb. Fish tacos were okay, but I wasn't in the mood for them so take that with a grain of salt. Cocktails weren't the beet of my life but I'm a harsh critic. They were pretty good. The worst part was honestly just the people. The clientele was a lot of ""think we're hot shit"" types.

Better yet, unlimited bubbly pink champagne was being served by a happy staffer from a pretty little bar.  Great tunes and frequent trips to the bar kept my girls and I in the bathroom for who knows how long!  When we eventually returned to our male companions, who were waiting to order, upon hearing the amenities in the women's bar said, ""What bar;  all we had was (blank, blank).  Oh well Now for the food!   We devoured the Pearls of the Sea (massive presentation of raw delicacies, lobster and shrimp cocktail); fought over the double orders of Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings. The Crispy Fish Tacos are made with Chilean Sea Bass y'all!  We all chose different entrees, but you cannot possibly go wrong no matter what!My Grilled Lamb Loin disappeared before my eyes; several big ole Bone-in Ribeyes were cooked to perfection and the creamy, cheesy, lemony, pesto flavored goodness of the Spaghettini knocked me out.  Of course we had the Crispy Panko Vidalia Onion Ring - so yummy;  killer Lobster Mac & Cheese... oh my goodness and fresh, crisp Grilled Asparagus.  Naturally, every dish was presented just so. We were too busy eating to take pictures so you're going to have to come check it out yourself. A full Vegan menu was available too, but we had to save room for their LES NYC Donuts, Devil's Food Cake accompanied by lovely and light milk ice cream.  And not to be omitted is their fab cocktails... Side Cars; Clean Martinis (8 olives each for moi) and potent Mojitos.  Well, actually everything was potent.   We ventured upstairs party area to flirt I.e. confer with the friendly security staff and made new friends.  Time to go but destined to return three more times!   And ....forget about your budget because you'll bust it at Beauty & Essex if you're anything like me and my friends.!",1,,1

We were shocked to get in as this place typically requires reservations and is always packed. They were able to get our party of four in a quiet little couch by the bar. If you think you're walking into a pawn shop, that's what it looks like from the outside but when you walk through their ""secret"" door you instantly feel like you're in a movie scene of an exclusive club. Glamour, bling, ambiancé, vibes, it has it all. The service is amazing, you feel like an elite, a superstar. We came here to order drinks but we were starving so we decided to go for it and try out the food. From my experience, places like these just don't have good food. They'll have overpriced food with tiny bites and you leave starving. Well, I have to say I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. The drinks: let's start with the drinks. What each one of us ordered was on point. Each individual drink was amazing. High end, delicious, strong. Exactly what I wanted to get. The drinks definitely took us there, they were 5 out of 5.The food: OMG. I definitely wasn't expecting the food to be THIS amazing. We ordered ravioli :: drooling :: it was rich, it was explosive, delicious. I also ordered an eggplant pizzetta. Eggplant was crispy, airy, fresh mozzarella, fresh ingredients. 5 out of 5 once again.This place, even the ladies room was AMAZING. I was so upset I left my phone in my purse and didn't bring it down with me. The powder room experience is out of this world. Glamour, mirrors, private bar, couches. You literally just want to stay in there all night. It was amazing. This place is a 5 out of 5. Definitely a MUST if you're in the city. Grab a bite, a few drinks, dress up and you'll have a nice night with your friends. The prices are a little up there, but it sure is worth the experience.",,,

He told us that we would have a minimum bar tab of $200 (surprise #2). We weren't into the bar minimum, and since there are tons of bars in the area, we left. Later on in the night as our group number started to dwindle, we returned to Beauty & Essex. This time I was with my friend who used to live in East Village, she called out Ken doll on his bluff and he let us in without a cover (surprise #3). The three of us got seats at the bar and ordered some cocktails all of which were deliciously crafted - ODB ""Old Dirty Bramble"", Beauty Elixer, and Emerald Gimlet.The space is beautiful and I've heard the food is great.

31,Helen S.,"Louisville, KY",40,183,64,5.0,7/7/2018,"I'm giving this five stars because I loved everything about this place. From the service to the food to the atmosphere. It's almost like sitting inside a jewelry box. When you go allow enough time to explore the items for sale. We didn't do this because our time was short. But wow what an experience. From start to finish. What I loved about our experience was there were 5 of us and the plates were big enough to share, if you wanted. My food was out of this world. The grits were amazing and smooth and full of flavor. Well, sweet flavor so it was different but I'm a good way.  I can't begin to describe all of the dishes we shared during our meal but everyone one of them were amazing. And our dessert. Oh my goodness.  That chocolate whoopie pie with peanut butter Center and the ice cream were amazing. Delicious. So when I'm NYC find this place. Eat. Enjoy. Savor the experience.",,1,
32,Theresa G.,"Austin, TX",258,187,16,4.0,10/27/2018,Great ambiance and food! The entrance was so cute. I was waiting in line for a minute before I realized the line I was in for was the pawn shop! Make sure you walk right through because the pawn shop person will not tell you anything. Food was delightful! Try the bone marrow-it will not disappoint! It is tapa style food so it is a fun way to share with your party! I am definitely coming back!,1,,
33,Lan L.,"Boston, MA",73,145,109,3.0,6/3/2018,"Ambience:  art deco decor combined with loud clubbing music.  I could barely have a conversation with anyone at my table.Food: had the lobster and hash for appetizer and then fish tacos for entree. The lobster and hash dish was drenched in Cajun spices and could hardly taste any of the actual ingredients.  There's something truly rewarding about tasting actual ingredients themselves, rather than be coated in spices. Entree was not any better and drowned out  by the spicy mayo.If you are looking for a party vibe during brunch then come here.",3,,

35,Jenn Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",223,169,1452,1.0,5/19/2018,"I wanted to come here for so long. I was going to give the food 4 stars until I went to bed and got the feeling I had to sh*t my pants. My stomach hurt so bad, but I had ate a lot of food that day so to make sure it was Beauty & Essex that gave me food poisoning, I texted my friend: ""I think I got food poisoning from dinner, are you ok?"" She responded, ""literally was thinking the same thing! I had such a bad stomachache and could barely stand up/walk back. Had to lay down immediately. I think it was the salmon tartare."" The salmon tartare wasn't even that good. It came on top of rice crackers and it just was a weird texture combination. The ""crispy"" fish tacos were NOT crispy. The breading of the batter is not meant to be give you that crispy outer layer. Not only was it soft and not warm, the taco was the driest taco shell I've ever had. It tasted like a cheap fast food taco. What a rip off. It could have also been the food poisoning culprit because it tasted like it's been sitting out for a while. If you deep fry a fish, it's supposed to come out piping hot. The food was room temperature, you can guess for yourself how long it's been sitting out. The only decent dish was the octopus cassoulet. It was spicy and had chorizo that saved the fish. The octopus as really tender, the beans could have been more tender.Obviously, I know you run the risk of food poisoning if you consume raw food, and that's why the put the * so they don't incur liability. But it's not ACTUALLY supposed to give you food poisoning unless your restaurant is unsanitary. I eat sushi all the time and have had no problems. I didn't expect such a local favorite to give me and my friend food poisoning.They serve champagne in the bathroom. But I would be so hesitant to get it because the place looks dingy. When I walked into the the restaurant, I caught a whiff of urine smell. I was like whatever, it's new york. But she lead us upstairs to our table and the smell continued. I can't tell if it's their cleaning supplies or the diffuser they use but I can't be the only person to think it smelled like urine in the whole restaurant!!!! Anyways, it's the next morning and I thankfully did not sh*t my pants but my stomach STILL HURTS.",14,7,3

37,Jerica B.,"Hoboken, NJ",3,69,249,4.0,9/1/2018,I've been hearing about this restaurant for a while so I decided to make a reservation for my birthday. They were very accommodating as I was coming from Jersey and running later than there 15 minute grace period. I absolutely love that when you walk in it's a pawnshop and the restaurant comes to life once you walk through the door. The restaurant was very busy with great music playing. Our server was really good. Most of the table ordered the Peruvian Chicken and is was amazing!! You really can't go wrong with whatever you order. I absolutely will be coming back.,1,,
38,Amelia L.,"Worcester, MA",791,217,721,5.0,5/19/2018,"Everything about this place is extremely unique, from the exterior to interior design and the food itself.The outside of the restaurant is deceiving; it looks like a record store from the outside. My friends and I were extremely confused at first and when we walked in to ask we were shocked to find that it was actually the restaurant. Another door inside the little front reception area leads to the actual restaurant itself. With the mix of the name, almost reminds me of a Beauty and the Beast themed restaurant with the chandelier lights. I went for a bachelorette party and our servers suggested a tapas style dinner which was basically selecting up to 8-9 different types of food on the menu and they'll make one serving for each person at the table. This is a great way to try multiple different foods. One of my favorites was wonton tacos and bbq fries. The fries reminded of basically lays bbq chips! Highly recommended for a fancy night out! Really good for big parties, just make reservations before! They will not seat unless your full party is there!",3,1,2
39,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,5/12/2018,"B&E is every bit as grandiose as you probably already imagine it to be.  In fact, it might be even more so.  But what's impressive is that as over-the-top as the decor may be, it's still incredibly stylish and trendy (except the upstairs bar that glows pink).We came here on a Friday night with a 7:15 reservation.  OpenTable reservations are accepted no more than 30 days in advance, and prime times are snatched up quickly.  When we arrived, we were told there was a table just paying their bill and were handed one of those tacky buzzers that would alert us when our table was ready.  The front entryway was madhouse packed with people all waiting for a table, which was really annoying.  We finally got seated around 7:30.  The dining room we were seated in had 4 empty tables, so I'm not sure what the delay was about.The restaurant is known for their tapas, which our waiter suggested we order 3-5 of for 2 people.  We tried their popular grilled cheese dumplings ($17), bulgogi ribeye tacos ($19), and fish tacos ($24).  Both of the tacos come in servings of 3, so our waiter gave us the option of ordering 4 at an additional cost (+$6/bulgogi and +$8/fish).  The dumplings were my favorite of the tapas; cheesy and tomato-y and bacon-y.  The bulgogi tacos came in 2nd; the meat had the perfect balance of sweet and savory, but the kimchi was a bit too spicy for me.  The fish tacos were also good, but a bit more average.For entrees, my cousin had the filet ($48) with BBQ fries ($12) and I had the lobster mac & cheese ($18), which was actually a side, but the portion is pretty big.  The filet was a disappointment, especially for the price.  My cousin ordered it at medium doneness, but it was cooked well-done.  I'm sure the kitchen would've fixed this if we notified them, but my cousin refused to send it back because she felt bad.  The fries were tasty, but just a bit too reminiscent of BBQ potato chips.  And the lobster mac & cheese had large chunks of lobster and was very cheesy, but just a bit underseasoned.The cocktails ($17) are well-made and delicious.  On the menu, they are categorized as sweet or savory, and I got to try both.  The ODB (Old Dirty Bramble), the Ruby Mojito, and the Woodsman all had well-balanced flavors and gave me a nice buzz.PS.

44,Akansha B.,"Manhattan, NY",258,325,179,3.0,4/24/2018,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  It's loud, with good music and a busy crowd of people (ideal for people watching). It felt like an upscale and packed Applebee's because you're standing there for an hour for a reservation you made a week ago, and they hand you those little buzzers while you wait. Unlike an Applebee's or ruby Tuesday's, the  food was actually decent and did not go bad after an hour of sitting. Despite this there were no standouts in the 4-5 dishes we ordered (including the burger), but the drinks were strong (which I was hoping for). I still can't justify the price. Personally, a place this trendy I recommend for boozy birthday brunch or if a friend is visiting from out of town, but it felt a little bit overrated upon reflection. My one eye roll moment was the girl in the scantily clad bandeau dress and nude six inch heels who was having a photo session that blocked the stairwell from the bathroom to the first floor. She was frustrated by the people coming and going. Gee I'm sorry you are not able to capture the ""200+ likes"" worthy Instagram photo you're trying to achieve in the middle of the stairwell. This gives you an idea of the crowd and vibe. Enjoy!",6,6,3

I made reservations by phone before I arrived to NYC and had to change it to a later time the day-of with no hassels. The entrance is a pawn shop. Once you tell them you have reservations they open a door and your lead into a really cool hip looking spot. We were on time for the reservation but our table wasn't ready so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Shortly after we got sat. Majority of the menu is small plates so we ordered a few to share. We got the poke tacos,  gilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, and the thai shrimp. All the items were great with the star being grilled cheese dumplings with tomato soup. Very tasty! The service was a bit slow and I found out why- our server told is mid meal she was leaving and someone else was taking the table. It was 11pm at night and the place was packed so kinda odd.All in all a nice spot but a bit pricy. definitely a good date night or girls night out place.

47,Karina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,98,99,3.0,10/12/2018,"If you're looking for an upscale place with deliciously pricey food but atrocious service then look no further 'cause Beauty & Essex in NYC is a place which perfectly fits that description. The restaurant masquerades as a pawn shop at the Lower East Side. It was my friend's 30th so we figured doing a nice brunch in the city would be a good time for everyone. We made reservations for 1PM on a Sunday for a party of twelve. Once everyone arrived, we were seating at the big table in the middle, awesome. My friend's fiancé ordered a pre-fixed menu (everything is tapas style) in advance which was brilliant and would save everyone a lot of time instead of deciding what to order (keep in mind we were told that our reservations were from 1pm-3pm only).About 15 minutes later, a waiter came up to us and asked if we would like to start off with drinks. Most of us knew we would at least have one alcoholic beverage each, but some inquired about a drink package. That's when our hell started. 15 minutes have passed and we still don't have our drinks or any food (we have been sitting for 30 minutes at this point). Finally the waiter returns, no drinks, and there is still confusion as so what beverage package is available. We told him to just forget it and to bring out our previously ordered drinks and the food, please and thank you. Another 15 minutes later (45 minutes since we sat down), still no food. Now you have 12 HANGRY people sitting in the middle of the restaurant. Finally our drinks arrive. Almost half of the table ordered the Cinnamon Toast Crunk ($17) which contains hennessy vs, almond milk, vanilla simple, and cinnamon toast crunch rim. All of those drinks did not have the cinnamon toast crunch rim. We asked if they can please add the crunch to the rim, ""Sure, no problem"", 10 minutes later, ""Sorry, we ran out"".An hour has past, still no food on our table. ABSURD. The fiancé is fuming at this point and walks away to talk to someone higher. A few waiters come by with complimentary lemon drop shots. Great but we are still HANGRY. FINALLY our food arrives. They started us with the bagel and lox board and red velvet waffles. Devoured in 5 minutes, nothing special but didn't expect to be WOW'd. Next came the interesting dishes: Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumpling (yes, one dumpling) served on a cutsey spoon. YUM. Followed by Chile Relleno Empanadas with poblano, manchego, jalapeno-lime crema which were decently sized and also yummy. Time for the main course (finally!). We had the crispy fish tacos w/ Chilean sea bass, yuzu aioli, pickled daikon and carrots - very yummy. Lobster and chorizo hash w/ potatoes and cilantro butter - some people liked it, others not so much. And then came out the Beauty & Essex Burgers (each burger cut in half) brisket, short rib & lamb, spicy harissa aioli, beefsteak tomato, goat feta (sounds moth-watering right?) WRONG. The blandest burger I've ever had, definitely a pass for me. I took two bites and left the rest. Lastly came the dessert. As per the restaurant's recommendation, we got their LES Doughnuts w/ caramel, chocolate, and berry dipping sauces. Extremely disappointing. Flavourless dough balls that even the dipping sauces couldn't help.I really hope that our experience is not common at Beauty & Essex, for it can be a wonderful place to dine and have a good time. But waiting over an hour for food is absolutely inexcusable.",2,1,

51,Mabelle L.,"Queens, NY",279,284,1513,4.0,7/25/2018,"Mmmm, I've been here multiple times and each time the food did not disappoint. Note that the portions are small but high quality, and the price reflects that. Would highly recommend to make a reservation in advance.I called ahead to tell them we were going to be late because it was the weekend and the M train wasn't working so we had to walk from Grand St. They said they give you a 15 minute grace period. I was hoping that we would make it there within 15 minutes but ended up being closer to 18 minutes late because it was raining too. Even though I called ahead to tell them I would be late, they still gave us a slight attitude and told us to wait (but they didn't know how long it would be). We ended up walking around the place to kill time and ended up waiting half an hour before another table was ready. Anyway, back to the positives. Here are some of my favorites:- Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings- Crispy fish tacos- Oven braised chicken meatballsWhat was great was that they are flexible in adjusting the servings based on the number of people at your table. Such as, one of the dishes comes with 3 things but since we had 4 people, they were able to serve 4 in the dish instead so you're not awkwardly having to split something with one person from your party.Word of advice, check out the champagne bar in the women's bathroom, make reservation in advance and don't be late, enjoy the tapas style (they suggested for a party of 4 to order 6-8 things), and be prepared that your bill will be high. Our bill was about $230 before tips and we left not hungry or full.",3,1,3

As soon as our waitress knew we had 5 people in our party, they accommodated each dish for 5 people. I've never had a restaurant do that before.The food, although very good, came in very small portions, so prepare for that. I would say my favorite of all the dishes was the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumplings. I don't eat red meat, so they put it on the side for us, which was very nice. I also enjoyed the Lemon-Pepper Ricotta Ravioli. It was really moist and flavorful.The best part was the drinks. I had the Beauty Elixir. I don't like strong drinks, but somehow, they made it strong without me being able to tell, which is the best kind of cocktail I highly recommend it.I really enjoyed this place! I would recommend it.

We ordered about 10 different dishes (some were sides) which came out tapas style and portioned correctly for a party of 7 who was sharing (nice touch to portion correctly).

Grilled cheese soup dumplings were a nice take on a classic comfort food. The soup had just the right amount cream to tomato ratio and the grilled cheese were in delectable little bites. Surprisingly, my favorite was the side of broccolini. The greens were cooked to a great almost al dente bite and had a really good mix of salty and spicy dressing. The surf n' turf was disappointing compared to everything else. The sear on the meats were good but the hard pork belly and soft scallops didn't really contrast well together and just created a wonky texture when combined. The puree was sweet and smooth enough to cover the meats but it wasn't strong enough to replace a sauce.Service - 4/5. Very professional and courteous. We came near the time of the kitchen closing so they were prompt with the service but we never felt rushed.Value - 4/5. Food is delicious and has a lot of unique experiences to offer.

58,Leyla K.,"Elizabeth, NJ",172,76,86,4.0,8/17/2018,"I would give this place 3 stars, but the only reason I'm giving it 4 is because of the beautiful ambiance and the fact that they have a vegan menu (very accommodating). I had reservations for 8:15 and I wasn't seated until 8:40, which sucked. I understand the place is busy but if you have a reservation you shouldn't be waiting that long. All that aside, the place itself is so trendy and filled with younger groups. You almost feel transformed when you walk into the restaurant doors like you're in a completely different area. It's definitely romantic, but the music is so loud it's hard to hear your date! The tables are all pretty packed close to each other, so be mindful of that. As for the food, the only thing worth it to me we're the tomato and grilled cheese appetizers. So unique, creative, and my god were they full of flavor. I never thought I'd be so impressed with a grilled cheese! My boyfriend got the salmon entree, which was a decent size. I got the vegan meatballs, which had lots of great flavor.

We got: Tomato tartare, Avo Lemon + Espelette toast, Chile Relleno Empanadas, Grilled Cheese Tomato soup dumplings, Crispy eggplant pizzetta AND finally the house doughnuts.Most of the dishes we got were small bites. My absolute favorite had to be the Grilled Cheese Tomato Soup dumplings. The small bites were sich a tease-which I could have a big bowl of it! The Tomato tartare on parmesan crostini with a quail egg on top was a close second. They also serve up a bevy of well-crafted cocktails. I had gotten ""ODB"" and the Fireside Chat. Both were strong yet the subtle mix of flavors could still be tasted. The ambiance is nice here except for one seemingly small thing-the music.

They're known for they're thrift store entrance, without looking on yelp  or looking online you wouldn't know what to expect. Once you enter through the thrift shop entrance you approach double doors which is the real entrance and WOW you're blown away! The ambiance is sexy, and alive. The bar is buzzing with tons of people, as they have some of the best mixologists in town. We had a 6:45pm reservation on a Friday night, we arrived about 10 minutes late and was told we would probably have to wait at the bar because they can't hold tables for that long ‍. Luckily, the hostess was able to accommodate us, and seat us just minutes later. We were seated in the larger dining room which has high ceilings and the lighting is dim. We ordered A few appetizers to start to share, like the lobster Mac and cheese which is super cheesy ( delish but so much dairy is not a good idea ) we also ordered a round of oysters, a salad and the soup to share ( I forgot what the soup was called but it was no ordinary soup. It was on a spoon, 6 spoons to be exact hence why we were able to share . Our waitress was busy, you could tell because the place was busy and she never really checked up on us. I was to deep in conversations to care, but others noticed. I ordered the salmon, medium. It was pretty good.. nothing crazy. What was crazy, was our bill . I mean we did order a lot and the guys kept tossing those drinks back but sheesh. $600 for all of that...which resulted in all of us putting in $150 each, not horrible but my eyes definitely almost fell out of my head when seeing the bill that high. Overall great vibe, great birthday dinner and most importantly she appreciated it all so it was well worth it. Happy bday boo!",3,1,2

The dining room actually looked huge, especially with the high-gloss walls and ceilings. The food was quite good, especially for RW menu:Emerald gimlet: the basil kick is nice. Nice bright color, and it worked well with the restaurant's vibeEggplant pizzerita: huge portion. This was delicious and not too filling. The two types of cheese and the crust was so good. The eggplant almost felt like they are pepperoni without the guilt. Empanadas: not bad, but nothing to write home about. Short ribs: a bit dry. It has nice marbled fat, but the ribs could have used more spices, sauce or rub. Salmon: nicely done. The interior still had a bit of pink and the sides were delicious.Tldr; great vibe with excellent food. The staff were attentive and friendly. Overall, I give it 5 stars for its combination of elements that give customers coming here a great night.",4,,1
63,Ricardo T.,"Jersey City, NJ",196,94,392,5.0,3/19/2018,"West coasters visiting. Needed a meet up spot. Brother recommended. Last minute reservations. Brunch at 1pm on a beautiful chilly Sunday afternoon.Judging the entrance from street view I wondered if I was overdressed. Entrance leads into a quaint pawn shop. Where you are pleasantly greeted. Upon verifying your reservations the double doors open to a sexy chic vibe where you will encounter a grand, circular staircase wrapped around a two­story custom chandelier. High heeled ladies and dapper gents from the bar to stair case sipping cocktails and mimosas early afternoon hours. Lando, was exceptional in explaining everything to us from recommendations and specials to the easiest way to order. Lando always had an eye on us to make sure we were happy throughout our visit! XO Lando! Food was served by way of the shared plate dining trend. Everything we ordered was delicious (listed in order of favorite):- dumplings on a spoon- fish tacos- eggplant pizzeti- avacado toast- pastrami mac and cheese- chorizo lobster hash- bacon- fried chicken bisquitsPlate delivery timing was perfect. Never felt rushed.Would definitely return for the great service and other menu items. Will look into the ""Champagne Brunch"" (reservations required) next time.",1,,

Appetizers:The clear winner was the Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta over the Chile Relleno Empanadas which was smaller portion and a little dry.Entrees:We both collectively enjoyed the Spaghettini (w/ zucchini, lemon & sunny side up egg) more than the Braised Short Rib which was delicious but just not as flavorful.Dessert:We got the ""LES NYC"" Doughnuts & Vanilla Panna Cotta both good but doughnuts were much more ideal for sharing.All in all a fun experience and would come back again. If you're coming on a romantic date, go earlier during the workday, otherwise the later it gets the more lively it seems!",3,,
65,Catalina U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",549,93,301,5.0,2/24/2018,"Oh. My. God. To say this place was amazing seems insufficient. From the design of the space, to the service, to the food... everything was phenomenal. I would like to applaud this restaurant and their floor managers for being so aware and communicating so well about what customers may need. Because of our ""wait"" we were offered a free round of drinks (party of 6) and even got dessert as a complement from the chef (it was 4 different desserts!). Our wait was NOTHING. Maybe 10 minutes? So this customer service was outstanding.Let's get to the good part: the Food. WOW. WOOOOWWWW. I suggest go with a large group so you can share your meal tapas style, you'll want a bite of EVERYTHING!! I absolutely recommend the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizer as well as the tuna wonton tacos. The truffle sauce of the meatballs was to die for, and the ahi tuna meal was excellent. The drinks were also very delicious.This place was a dream. I'll make it a point to stop in any time i'm in New York. Can't wait!!!",2,,
66,VickiE G.,"Seattle, WA",145,96,348,4.0,2/8/2018,"Came here after NYFW with a reservation. Super friendly service and provided great recommendations for drinks and appetizers! All the food plates are tapas style and they can do more than what's on the plate. We had the lobster Mac and cheese, veggie empanadas, wasabi tuna, fish tacos, and yam ravioli. Ended with donuts and chocolate pudding. My fav is the tuna and the ravioli! Mac and cheese is good but had an interesting spice to it. Fish tacos breading is a bit thick. The tuna was just the perfect seasoning and the ravioli is tender and sweet! Donuts are amazing and fluffy, came with three sauces - chocolate, caramel, and jam.",3,1,1
67,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",103,39,1,5.0,9/30/2018,"I came here to celebrate with my girlfriends after having this dining spot on my list for months. I'm so glad I did it because the experience, ambience and food was fantastic! We were seated about 25 min late, but it was a jam packed Friday night and the hostesses were nice about it so we didn't mind too much. The ambience of the entire place was so beautiful and was much larger than I had expected. We all tried difficult cocktails and they were beautifully decorated and strong! Very good cocktails at a typical price for a trendy spot such as this. We also got the famous tomato soup dumplings to start and just wow. My mind was blown by how delicious they were considering I never liked tomato soup beforehand. I could've ordered 5 plates of them and eaten them alone.We all got different mains and it was just to see there was a whole separate menu for my vegan friend! I went with the ricotta and spinach ravioli which was so good. Very creamy and cheesy sauce so I highly recommend. Everyone else loved their dishes as well.We ordered 3 desserts but one was actually unavailable so the waitress brought us two additional desserts in its place on the house, which was incredibly nice. They also brought our a traditional happy birthday plate with mini cupcakes and a candle. It seemed as though everyone around us was also celebrating birthdays so definitely a good spot for a special occasion! Overall great birthday dinner - love this spot and definitely want to come back to try the champagne brunch!",1,,
68,Ariel R.,"Middletown, CT",74,114,98,5.0,7/17/2018,"Beauty & Essex has to be my favorite restaurant in New York. The only reasons I typically don't take photos in an establishment is because I'm underwhelmed, the food doesn't look good, or there's nothing worth taking photos of. From the second we walked into Beauty & Essex, I was in awe and taking it all in. From walking into a pawnshop to a restaurant with gorgeous decor and a stellar menu, I forgot I even had a phone and was too busy living in the moment and enjoying everything this restaurant had to offer.The ambiance was beyond unique, the service was perfect, the drinks were creative and fun, and the food was mind-blowing. Over dinner, I enjoyed the Emerald Gimlet and Green With Envy cocktails. They were fantastic! We had the Kale & Apple Salad, Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (our favorite dish of the night, so we orderd a few), Crab Rangoon, Grilled Cheese & Smoked Bacon Tomato Soup, and Bulgogi Ribeye Tacos. We finished our meal with the ""LES, NYC"" Doughnuts and Strawberry Short Cake.Everything about Beauty & Essex was perfect. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in NYC!",1,,
69,Diane C.,"Great Neck, NY",38,145,805,5.0,7/31/2018,"My friend and I visited here for Restaurant Week and we loved our experience! This place is huge - we were sitting in what I believe the main dining space on the 1st floor and the whole area was super spacious with high ceilings and lots of tables (great place for large groups). I got the tuna tacos for appetizer, the ravioli for entree, and donuts for dessert. Everything was delicious - the ravioli especially was my favorite. My friend got the salad for appetizer, salmon for entree, and donuts for dessert. The salad amount was huge - I would say to go for the tacos if you are not that hungry. The price came to be about $45 per person with tax. Highly recommend!",,,
70,Ashley R.,"Miami, FL",201,56,132,5.0,1/20/2018,"Everything about our trip to Beauty & Essex was a fantastic experience! As mentioned in other reviews, the entrance is low-key, but opens to a beautiful and classy space that really makes you feel like you're in Vegas or somewhere like it. We had a short initial wait (it was me and 5 other girls for a bachelorette party) but we entertained ourselves at the bar while chill but club like beats played in the background.After grabbing a drink to start (and finding out there is a BAR in the bathroom offering complimentary champagne), we were seated. Our waiter, Ryan, was fantastic, fun, and patient. He recommended several tapas sized plates and a round of drinks (I do recommend the Beauty Elixir) and we were not disappointed. My personal favorite was the kale salad (sounds basic - but it was really good), the shrimp, and the fish tacos.We had such a good time, we even went back to the bar area to hang out for a while more after dinner!",5,,1

We did not have reservation but there was only two of us. We got some drinks and made some friends and got an awesome table. I have no idea how they do it, but the tomato soup grill cheese bite is perfect. The drinks are good for NYC. The ravioli was filling. I would defiantly go back.

74,Sasha M.,"Philadelphia, PA",381,97,46,4.0,1/9/2018,"I came here with high expectations based on recommendations and prior reviews. With that being said, my expectations were almost all met, which is saying a lot. Warning- prices are high! Ambiance:The highlight of the visit here was the ambiance. I was in search for a hip, trendy spot with great food and this place fit the bill perfectly. You enter into a pawn shop and the door opens into the restaurant, a large dimly lit elaborate space with an upstairs and downstairs. We were told there would be live music but it was nowhere to be heard, but the upscale, trendy vibe of this place made up for it. Service: We had reservations and were given a beeper to wait by the bar, no big deal. We only waited 5 minutes and didn't get to order drinks, which is a plus because we shouldn't have to wait long with reservations. We were taken to a table in the main dining room, and our server was ok. She seemed to be in a bad mood or just didn't like us because she was super chatty with the tables next to us. On the brighter side, the way the staff helps each other is impressive. A new person was bringing dishes/drinks out and refilling our water each time, and was super polite. Food:I was really impressed with the food. We just got apps and tried a few items. I would save room for dessert. I tried the tomato soup dumplings (5/5 must order), shishito peppers (4.5/5) and the tuna tartare (4.5/5)For dessert we shared the butterscotch pot de creme (4/5) which was nice but not my favorite- my favorite item from the entire night was the White Russian dessert milkshake! (5/5) Definitely order that- it's very sweet and indulgent.Drink:Beauty Elixr is a great drink although it is not very strong. I could barely taste the alcohol but I guess that's the whole point. On the other hand, the fat Frenchman and ODB are very potent. Proceed with caution lol Overall:I would return again mainly for the ambiance and to try a few new dishes. I guess the service is a hit or miss but this is a great place to grab drinks or have a nice night out.",6,,1

At 10:07p I'm sitting at another restaurant scarfing down food because B&E can't get their shit together and seat a party of 8 at their table. Mind you... a table that was reserved for well in advance. The girl said ""people have been sitting at your table since 6p"". I'm pretty sure there were other tables upstairs. It isn't right to have a large party waiting around for 2 hours. It's not the way you do business. This was my third time at B&E. I've had mediocre experiences there in the past but I'm done with them completely now. I'm usually pretty understanding but this is unacceptable. It was a Wednesday night. Honor the reservation.

Eva our server was wonderful. The food was AMAZING! I recommend the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings and the chicken meatballs. Then the dessert. Y'all, we had a CAROUSAL filled with different desserts. It was remarkable and just so fun. The best part about the restaurant was in the ladies restroom there is a bar that gives free sparkling rose (tips appreciated). It was the coolest experience ever!",1,,1
77,Jay G.,"Castro Valley, CA",128,318,2052,5.0,12/14/2017,"Last night was one of the most amazing tapa dinners ever. After walking into the pawn shop and drooling over the Gibson 335 and several Les Pauls, we entered the restaurant through ""the door"" in the pawn shop.  It is the most unique entrance second to one in Atlanta where you walk through a bakery to get to the restaurant.Our reservations were at 8:30 and we did not get seated until 9:30!  Now I was pretty fuming at this point as we were told another group paid but was not leaving the table. It happens but I was surprised nothing was being done to accommodate us for the wait.  Well they definitely took care of us after we were seated.  Complimentary sparkling for the table (4 of us) was a nice way to accomodate.However after we ordered, they added several items on the house and integrated them in with our dishes. Now that is what I call EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.The wait staff were great and now for the big review!All items were tapas, one piece per person. There are main dishes but why anyone would want one big dish and not explore all the flavors of the chef's creations is beyond me.We had:ThaiShrimp- an amazing very lightly breaded large prawns which were full of sweetness and heat from the red peppers and some sort of sliced root that accompanied the dish.  Shrimp very fresh with a nice snap to them, Definitely a must dish.Avacado Toast- ok the new frozen yogurt rage of the 90s is now Avacado toast rage of 2017. Although it's really a chinky guacamole that was very tasty there was nothing really creative about mashed avocado on toast but it was tasty. Salmon Tar Tare Toast- amazing combination of flavors on this dish and nice presentation, I always love a great tar tare of anything and this did not disappoint.Mini Tuna Taco- was a great mini taco stuffed with ahi tuna and a wasabi cream. Excellent and a must get.Crab Rangoon- a real classic served on an asian style rice puff crackerCeaaer Toast- a unique twist on individual toasts. The salad was great, dressed perfectly.Empanada- very good. a mini serving in a nice crisp and light pouch of fried dough.Bulgogi tacos,- one of my favorites with great moist, juicy sweet bulgogi meat server in the same taco as the mini tuna tacos. Excellent!Tomato Soup Dumpling- a great spin served in a wonton soup spoon filled with tomato soup and a nice quarter size dumpling floating on top. This was a fun dish and I loved the presentation.Lobster Mac and Cheese- omg so good with massive size pieces of lobster and cheese throughout with large pieces of pasta.Shishito peppers. Done in a very unique sweet and spicy sauce that really gave extraordinary flavor to what is usually a fairly bland pepper with a surprise hot one at random that makes eating them a fun time.All in all this is one of THE places to go in NYC and I will come back here for sure on my next visit next year.5 stars and then some!Tip: The music is loud, the crowd is loud, so drink well and often so you don't care.",10,2,2

Its an absolutely amazing place, you start by walking through a pawn shop to the back where a huge door opens to a swanky hip dark restaurant. Atmosphere is so fun and cool and the food is just as amazing. They have so many amazing small plates that we just kept ordering more and each was unique and different. I would recommend starting with the empanadas they are so mouth watering. We ended the night with the mojito sorbet shot.",,,

80,Miriam M.,"Manhattan, NY",311,287,527,4.0,12/1/2017,"Expensive? Yes. Potential to be pretentious depending on the night? Yes. But is the food, decor, and wait staff exceptional? Yes.Came on a Monday night at 7pm for dinner and drinks so I cant attest to the clubby atmosphere or what it's like as part of your Friday night out but the food is pretty scrumptious. Started out with cocktails- Beauty Rlixir and Berry Mojito. For the price they honestly were nothing exciting. Both a little too sweet but not unbearable. By the taste they should have been 10-12 but they can afford to up the price here because of the atmosphere. On to the food:-Crab Rangoons: only 3 small bites BUT delicious. Think deconstructed though, not deep fried wonton pouches.-Bone Marrow: LARGE portion. Two long bones with a stack of toasted bread and onion jam. Could not finish it. Good to share for more than 2 people.-Caesar Salad: most underwhelming item. Could not taste the anchovy, needed more salt or something.-Grilled cheese dumplings: OMG I AM STILL DREAMING/DROOLING OVER THESE LITTLE SPOONS OF HEAVEN. Comes with 6. -Scallops over farrow: Flavor wise I def recommend. Although $36 for 3 is a bit steep. Didn't have room for dessert...okay I lied we just got ice cream at Morgensterns...but the table next to ours had dessert and it looked good. Maybe just not $14 for a slice of something good. Worth it if you're trying to impress or a girls night!",7,1,
81,Angel M.,"Quincy, MA",262,207,312,5.0,12/8/2017,"I was making last minute arrangements couple weeks ago to celebrate an engagement with some friends. The reason that it was last minute is because the guest of honor commented that the other place was too far (*insert eye roll*). I was nervous that I could not find a nice replacement so last minute, but I took my chances and they had a last minute reservation at 5:15 on a Friday, so we jumped on it.When you first walk in, you will see a gift shop, and the restaurant is behind that. They were quick to seat us, and had a complementary coat check. The restaurant is really pretty and grand, and the ladies restrooms were very clean and had a royal feel (bathroom attendant, supplies and all). Beauty and Essex has the perfect date-night feel.We were a group of three and we ordered the following to share:-Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings-Chocolate Peanut Butter Whoopie -""Les, NYC"" Doughnuts-Beauty & Essex Burger w/ crispy bbq fries-Braised Short Ribs-Beauty Elixir (gin, cucumber, strawberry, sparkling rosé) for me.The appetizers and the entrees were solid choices, but nothing stood out more than the desserts and the beauty elixir drink. They were my favorite parts of the entire experience! the drink is fruity, but not overwhelmingly sweet and is mixed very well. The desserts were both a very solid choice (but I would suggest sharing between two people vs. three if you have a true sweet tooth). This was overall a wonderful experience, and cost us about $150. I would say that it was completely worth it in terms of dining experiences in NYC and is definitely worth the try!",4,,

I think it would have been a lot more poppin' later in the evening. There was a rowdy AF huge party crowd when we got there but thankfully they left 20 mins later. The music is loud so that + drunk humans screaming made it hard to even hear my hubby across the table. So, all the food was really yummy! We did the beef carpaccio - super refreshing and perfect to begin with, the Bolognese - we split it as our ""main"" dish, so tasty, the bulgogi beef tacos - yummmm and the famous tomatoes soup dumplings which were DANK. Get the dumplings. The chicks next two us ordered the burger which looked really good and I plan to have the Kale and Apple salad if I go again.

My basil gimlet was actually really good. The place is huge inside with lots of separate seating areas and the crowd is a nice, diverse mix of people dressed for a night out and others super casual. Love a place where you can just show up. Not a place for craft cocktails and most drinks on the menu didn't appeal, but the bartenders are happy to make you what you want.

They have little chandeliers above a few tables and peacock feathers, which are really pretty.I enjoyed everything we ordered. I ordered the brick pressed chicken with sautéed spinach and mushrooms. I love fries so I ordered BBQ fries which were tasty and crispy. My boyfriend ordered the Beauty & Essex burger which came with BBQ fries. Together we ordered onion rings. For drinks, I ordered the Beauty Elixir. It was good, you could smell & taste the cucumber. My boyfriend ordered the Fat Frenchman, which he enjoyed. The birthday cupcake I received was good, I love the cheesecake frosting and the mini gold stars on top.The bathroom was really clean and it had little lounge chairs with a female attendant who was working behind a small bar it seems.

Our table was really beat up.  They need a remodel.The music is now a kick back to the 80s vs the club vibe of the past.The menu as been reduced and isn't as creative.But, the food tasted fine.  The portions aren't big for the price - but I guess we are in NYC.  Overall, I left a little sad and won't be coming back unless they reinvent themselves.",2,,

Food was mediocre (except for the spaghettini and tuna appetizers which were delicious). After a while, one of the managers asked if we can move since he was expecting a large crowd and needed a larger space (we were occupying most of the corner, large space) and said he would buy us a round of drinks on the house if we moved so of course we did!

Normally, this is not ideal for me but it was an experience in itself. The crowd was great and so was the ambience. Very dim, casual and cool vibe. The food was excellent, the service was great as well. Evening heading to the ladies room was an experience - they were serving champagne! What I loved about this place is that we didn't want to leave. After dinner we enjoyed more cocktails and had such a great time. The crowd got a little busier and it turned into more loungey.

Everyone was dressed up in Gatsy theme and spiffed up for the holidays!The interior, although decorated, is obviously nice and higher-end type of bar than what the storefront hints at, and with it, comes the higher-end price tags for drinks. It may have also been inflated prices from the event or holiday, but I don't recommend you come unless you're looking to treat yourself or your company! They had little bites of food on plates with servers going around and offering, and it really felt like a sophisticated event, especially with the dimmed lighting, professional photographer, and even DJ! Glad that I got to come and experience such a lovely event on a special evening. Hope to be back on a regular evening to compare to it's regular ambiance!",1,,2

The food is amazing.. the grilled cheese/tomato soup dumplings are a must have, the tuna tartar was a favorite, but the tuna poke wonton rolls were another, braised short rib brisket, fries and we shared desserts around the table... several chocolate donut selections that were amazing. During brunch, we had the blueberry pancakes with lemon ricotta and they are still something I think of... mimosas and etc.. It's the perfect place for dinner with the girls or brunch, and it gets really crowded.. have reservations, make sure that you're there on time and enjoy the show.. there is some serious people watching.. tourists come here thinking its :Las Vegas at times..",,,
94,Dominic A.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,14,238,4.0,5/22/2018,"I went to Beauty & Essex for my fiancé's birthday this past April, what a nice place (I picked it by the way lol) when you enter the venue it seems as though you are in a vintage pawn shop (I believe you could buy the items on Display) as the security guard opens the door the place transforms into an awe inspiring restaurant. You Greeted by coat check associates (free coat check) and a host to take you to your seat, you walk pass a bar/lounge area to the back where a huge skylight window illuminates the dining room.We got our menus and was told it's best to share plates (tapas style) my two favorite dishes were the dumplings and the Thai shrimp (do not miss out on those) drinks were also tasty The ODB especially (old dirty bastard). All n all we loved Beauty & Essex and will be returning soon",2,,
95,Kimberly C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",256,731,1129,4.0,5/10/2018,"All the ladies rave about Beauty & Essex so I was pumped for our 10PM dinner here last Saturday night. The lobby is a stylish pawn shop with some bling bling and jewels. We did wait a bit, but not terribly long. The music is quiet loud so be prepared to shout to your friends. But the music was on point! Lots of good jams for dancing to.Note, this is totally a girls' spot, at least for dinner. In the dining room/section we were in, I probably saw about 2-4 guys. The rest were women! We started off with the Beauty Elixir, gin, strawberry, rose. I normally don't like gin, but you can barely taste it. I also had the sweet potato ravioli. Everything is meant to be shared, but as a vegetarian, I wasn't sharing! The ravioli was soft and just delicious, not too heavy. I also had some of my friend's potato rice cakes, as she's gluten free and wasn't feeling too well.Our server was friendly, and it didn't even seem like too long of a wait for our food. Be prepared to shell out some bills, but it's totally worth it. We danced, we dined, and we enjoyed ourselves!",2,1,1
96,Alexis M.,"Tallahassee, FL",243,104,222,5.0,5/8/2018,"Impeccable service, food, and ambiance! 5 stars across the board for me. Food came out almost as soon as it was ordered. Drinks got me feeling some type of way! My favorite appetizer would be the Caesar toast! The chicken meatballs are an absolute MUST they are soooo yummy. The wonton tacos were cute and bite sized. My friends loved the tar tar and carrots! This great spot is INSIDE of a pawn shop! (Well in the back). Well worth the $500 we spent.The girls bathroom has a bar with a bartender in it! I mean what more could you ask for from this place??",2,,1
97,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,5.0,10/1/2017,"Wow! Amazing ambiance and food to match. No wonder there's a crazy wait to get in here. And by crazy wait, I mean upwards of an hour, hour and a half! So do make a reservation, though not sure how much that will help in getting you seated faster.A lot of dressed up girls and guys - so do wear your trendy best. You kind of walk through what looks like a pawn shop to get into the restaurant, so don't be alarmed. Once you get inside you will be awe-struck by the beautiful interior. The grand dining room is beautiful and buzzing with activity. The food - excellent. The shrimp appetizer is a must! I really enjoyed my BBQ ribs but I would order something different next time as it was heavily charred (and a wee bit dried out) and a heavy meal. My table mates all loved their dishes as well. The food here is top-notch. You can tell from taste to presentation - they care about your culinary experience.Bring a date or a group of friends. Beauty & Essex is beautiful and delicious.",6,,3

99,Jinny C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,49,290,4.0,5/14/2018,"Came with 6 girlfriends to celebrate a birthday this past Friday. The food, drinks, ambience were pretty fantastic overall!Food: 4/5, in order of most to least favorite.Bulgogi Tacos- 5/5- the marinated ribeye was just so juicy! That tender meat was amazing with the crispy wonton skin shell but the kimchi slaw was what made this dish unbelievably tasty- perfection!Octopus Cassoulet- 5/5- the pieces of octopus were very well cooked and the spicy tomato broth was amazing! I liked the little beans and bites of chorizo too- added different textures to every bite.Chicken Meatballs- 5/5- these melt-in-your-mouth meatballs were so succulent and creamy! That ricotta cheese and truffle oil made these so indulgently delicious! Kale and Apple Salad- 4/5- the bite of pancetta and cheese were sooooo good with the acidic apple. The kale was crisp and refreshing with the tangy vinaigrette. Works well to balance out the heavier dishes we had too. Roasted Bone Marrow- 3/5- this was ok- nothing too special as every restaurant seems to offer this dish now. The marrow itself was a bit on the hard and slightly stringy? side but the red marmalade was a nice tart addition! Lobster Mac & Cheese- 0/5- the biggest disappointment of the evening. There are barely any lobster pieces in here so you're basically paying a ridiculous price for Mac and cheese... honestly the entire dish was suffocated by dry bread crumbs that made it super grainy so this is a hard pass.Drinks: 5/5Red wine- bottles of Malbec were delish! White wine- bottles of Albariño equally delish!Ambience: 4.5/5The place is very fun, hidden behind a thrift shop store front. The waiters were all great- until the end when they kept forgetting to bring us additional glasses of wine...And yes, like others, we also spent an inordinate  amount of time in the bathroom- courtesy comfy couches, sparkling rose champagne, and lovely ladies just wanting to chat with each other.We met several gal groups from out of state- and even ended up going to Mr. Purple (rooftop bar nearby) with a trio from Cali! Definitely a fun place to go see and be seen!",1,,1

Push the back door and it is like a portal to the most posh restaurant with high ceilings  chandeliers  and amazing  decor! It even has an old NYC night club vibe. The prices were good not over the top. The food was amazing. Fish tacos,eggplant,jumbo shrimp and the chocolate  cake were all worth  raving  about.  Our waiter couldn't  be nicer or more helpful. Thats a plus because  it was a first time here. We were celebrating  a birthday  and everything  was perfect. Thank you Beauty&Essexs you are like a jewel in LES",,,

Super cool entrance of a pawn shop that turns into a beautiful two story restaurant decorated so well. Really nice Leo lighting ambiance. Perfect for a date or a birthday dinner. The emerald gimlet was one of the best drinks I've ever had! A basil vodka mix we all fell in love with it. The service was so quick and all the food was mouth watering. The chicken meatballs were to die for and salmon tare tare. Definitely will be back, try to make a reservation the week of!",1,,
102,Bendik Johan W.,"Groveland, CA",46,28,0,5.0,10/31/2018,"We were a party of four going out for dinner. One of the party members had been here several times and truly recommended it. First of, I must say the entrance is very cool. Very speakeasy feeling to it as you walk through a little store and through a big door in the back. I would have never known that there was a restaurant there!When seated we ordered drinks that were all very good. We also had a great white vine after suggestions from our waiter. Moreover we had the waiter put together a meal for all of us so that we got to try out more than one dish from the menu. Everything tasted delicious and was presented very nicely. We also had just the right amount of food for the four of us. The ladies could report that sparkling vine is served in the ladies bathroom. Although it is kind of pricey it was definitely worth it! Would absolutely recommend and will definitely come back next time I'm in New York.",,,
103,Paul H.,"San Francisco, CA",264,72,25,5.0,4/26/2018,"What a place! This is West Hollywood meets Haight & Ashbury in a nutshell. All the glamour with the rustic home look and a pawn shop as a front. Amazing. The vibe inside is amazing and the seating is comfy. There's an upstairs and downstairs and both areas have bars and dining. I went on a Saturday and it was extremely busy. The security personnel were extremely nice, even helped us find seating and kept an eye out for when we'd be able to grab a table. The drinks are good. Overall, one of my favorite spots in the city. Really happy I got to see it before leaving NY.",1,,
104,Mike A.,"New York, NY",3,29,19,4.0,4/1/2018,"WMM (Worth My Money) 4 out of 5!Speak-easy gone commercial but I can't hate. It was pretty swanky... You walk in and it has the store front of a speakeasy but we all know its there. That's the problem and maybe the 30-50 people waiting outside as well. But don't get me wrong this is a"" Hip"" place. Dim lights, massive bar, tables all around for dinner - this is a massive establishment. Food was decent - tapas style - but felt like it wasn't. That is a good thing. Ordered the grilled cheese dumplings, bone marrow, fried eggplant flat bread and the peanut butter whoopie pie and to my surprise I enjoyed everything. Watch out the whoppie pie is massive and very rich. The bone marrow was my favorite because who doesn't love baked fat with caramelized onions on a toast with seal salt.. Jesus.   This is a date place or a place to find a date...put your swag on and get over there. You wont be disappointed.",2,,1
105,Emmanuelle A.,"Bronx, NY",182,22,4,1.0,7/16/2018,"I have never been to a restaurant with such POOR/RACIAL SERVICE. Upon my arrival at the check-in desk, my party and I did not even get a look in the eye. The hostess stared at her computer screen the WHOLE TIME.When we were finally seated, we literally sat there for 26 MINUTES. Not one person came to the table to ask us how we were or even offer a glass of water. COMPLETELY DISGUSTING. Then a group of about 7-10 caucasian women came in and they were immediately seated as well as served water and were even placing orders! After my party and I were fed up, we decided to get up and leave and the nerve of the hostess to say ""Have a Nice Day!""I am truly not the kind of person to bring RACE into situations but this was truly an evident situation in which was obviously a factor. MY MONEY IS GREEN! I WILL NEVER, EVER ATTEND NOR RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT. Treat people right your business will flourish!",5,,

The music is on point, the vibe is on point and the food is legit! I love that's it's all tapas style so you're encouraged to share and taste as many dishes as possible. Make reservations if you can since it is a popular spot!We ordered the fries, poblano empanadas, grilled cheese and tomato soup shooters, and fish tacos. I HIGHLY recommend the poblano empanadas they were so bomb I could've eaten the whole plate . Don't forget dessert! We tried the lemon cheesecake and the devils chocolate cake .. again .. delicious!! This was definitely a super fun spot to start our night in NYC. One of the coolest places I've been to yet. Make sure to check it out.",4,,

Our waitress was anything but rude.  She was attentive and friendly.  We came here for drinks but ending up ordering dinner too.  We had onion rings, meatballs, macaroni lobster and a couple of drinks.  The drinks were strong and sweet and were recommended by our waitress.  Good choice.  The food was great I wouldnt necessarily say the best but definitely good and really went with the vibe of the place.  It is a great place for a night out and they play good music throughout the night.  Make sure to make reservations as the doorman are not letting you in those doors unless you do. I definitely recommend this place for a great night out!",1,1,1
108,Dipika S.,"San Francisco, CA",1,18,27,2.0,7/21/2018,"2 stars for decor. Given all the hype on yelp, i thought this was a speakeasy like the Aviary where you needed reservations so I made a reservation for 10pm. I called ahead telling them I'm going to be 15min late because of the rain and traffic. The lady said I have a 15min grace period after which thee would be a wait.. I was a little confused by that bc the point of calling ahead was to let them know to hold the table.We got there at 10:15pm no one greeted us or directed us anywhere, and we didn't get seated until 10:45pm. We just waited and didn't order anything at the bar because wanted to make sure our waiter would be able to benefit from the tip. It was annoying to wait but then we were finally seated. We got our drinks. Drinks were mediocre - sound fancy but not worth $17 plus tip. My drink from the sweet section wasn't sweet and my husbands got a drink from the savory section but he didn't like it so told the waiter. He literally tried to drink it but couldn't. The waiter basically said he can't trade it out until we order more drinks and to get something else on the menu. A good waiter (literally everywhere else in every other city) would have tried to make it better or swap it out because which bar wants to be known for having bad drinks?Then he asked us if we were going to order food like 3 times and finally at 11:30pm when we said no, he had the nerve to say management doesn't like the tables to be used for drinks but he is personally ok with it... ummm first if he's actually ok with it, he wouldn't have said it. Second, if management cares so much then they should write that on opentable. And third, not sure how many people eat dinner at after 11:30pm. There were plenty of empty tables... if I was a restaurant/bar owner I would feel like an idiot saying that to my customers... there's a time and place for that policy, and 11:30pm is not it. I was expected this place to be like The Aviary or a small speakeasy where you needed reservations (like the ones in San Francisco). Instead it was really loud (we could barely talk), and it was two stories, playing clubby music. It's everything, a restaurant, lounge, club, speakeasy, can dress up or dress down.... can't be everything.. I will give this place 2 years before people realize it's not worth it. Service really left a bad taste in my mouth. Won't be back again ever, nor would I recommend this place to anyone who wants a guaranteed good time.",2,3,
109,Sandra B.,"Jersey City, NJ",18,48,70,4.0,8/20/2018,"Came here on a Friday evening during restaurant week and ordered from the restaurant week many. For starters my husband and I shared the empanadas and the kale salad. The kale salad was actually delicious and definitely big enough for the 2 of us the share. The empanadas dish came with 4 small empanadas; they were good and kind of tasted like a creamy jalapeño popper. For the main dish we both got the short rib. The dish seems small but was surprisingly filling. Just an FYI it comes with a cold potato salad. For dessert, we both chose the donuts that came with a berry, caramel and chocolate sauce. The donuts were pretty standard, but I loved the chocolate and berry sauces. In terms of food, I felt like we got a good value. We both each ordered a cocktail, which were pretty standard, nothing impressive and about $18 each. For 2 of us ordering from the restaurant week menu and each getting a cocktail we ended up paying $150, which isn't bad. I'm definitely planning on going back and trying some more dishes from their regular menu.",,,
110,Caroline K.,"Queens, NY",329,432,37,2.0,3/11/2018,"Eh, not my scene.  It's definitely a place that's more about the atmosphere than the food itself, so disappointing in that sense, since I always go for the latter.  But if you like Bagtelle-esque places it'll probably be right up your alley, as one of my mates said.The scene is decked out all fancy and on the edge of douchey-ness, if that's your kind of vibe.  Fancy chandeliers and velvet upholstery and club-like ambiance.My group and I tried out a variety of dishes.  The tomato soup dumpling was very exotic and interesting, but something I definitely can't stomach more than one bite.  When you ask for cream in your coffee, they'll give you milk.  The eggs benedict was jamon serrico was extremely gross to me, and I stopped eating it after one because I knew indigestion was going to be in the works if I forced myself to eat it.I mean, at least the blackberry lemon pancakes with ricotta were somewhat worth it.",3,2,

112,Sara H.,"Chicago, IL",276,239,305,4.0,8/27/2017,"Wonderful concept for a fun, inventive hot spot in NY. The food is mostly small plates, which I always love so you get to sample multiple items! I came in here with a girlfriend last week and overall we were very pleased with the food. The service, not so much. They somehow forgot about us halfway through our dishes and stopped bringing out any food all together. We had to ask about it at which point our waiter claimed we told him to ""slow down with the service"" ....like wut? Why would anyone say that, ever?! But whatever, the show went on!!! Added bonus is the free champagne in the bathroom, like are you kidding me? Don't forget to bring your tip money!Eggplant pizetta: good, but a little boringGrilled cheese and tomato dumplings: out of this world. And such a stinkin' good idea--props Chris Santos, I see you!!! Tuna poke wonton tacos: good, but wish there were more than 3 pieces since 3 is hard to share. The wasabi sauce on top was fire. Chicken truffle meatballs: delectable, but predictable. Truffle gravy makes the world go round. Broccolini: surprisingly not boring and really, really, yummy!And a special shout out to the frozen tequila shots with lime sorbet for summing up the whole meal on a fabulous note. I wish I could have liquid dessert for every meal :)",5,1,2

The place is very cool when you walk it because it looks like a pawn shop and then there is a secret door that leads you into this massive restaurant.. idk I found that pretty cool. We had to wait a good 15 min to be seated at the bar/ lounge and we walked in at the time our reservation was scheduled, but that is very normal in many restaurants so you can get something to drink.When we sat down, the service was great. My favorite dishes we order were:- house salad (it's spicy)- broccolini (its spicy)- chicken meatballs- onion rings - empanadas - devils chocolate cakeThe majority of the dishes were a little spicy but it was all creative and delicious.I also wanted to mention that this is a 'tapas' or small dish place, and is meant for big groups to share. We (6 people) ordered around 8-9 dishes and we were perfect. They brought around 3 dishes at a time and changed the plates and utensils every time which was nice. Definitely coming back! 10/10!",1,,

We didn't realize that there was one in LA too haha but it was an experience since we got to dine here on NYE. However, we had to leave early before the countdown. This review is months overdue but I can still remember that first bite of the:- Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings. It was presented on a spoon as it is a one bite type of food. So juicy and a burst of flavor! - Roasted bone marrow with added truffle: it was standard bone marrow. Barely got any and the added truffle was a bit disappointing bc I didn't really get that potent truffle flavor.  Not my fave dish.- Spicy Salmon Tartare: fresh, tasty and creamy with the guacamole! Must get if you love anything salmon. - Surf and Turf: pork belly was so crispy yet tender. The scallops were cooked perfectly - bouncy yet has an outside char. Must get too :)- Lobster mac and cheese. It was good but I think Mastros version is better for the price. - Biscuit and Apple Bread Pudding: I LOVE bread pudding and order it everywhere I go so this was a no brainer. My bf and I got a lot of cocktails - they were addicting! Strong enough to feel it but sweet/sour enough to actually enjoy it. I forget which one we got though but it was all colorful!We had such a great time that we plan to be back but to the LA location!

The front of the restaurant is a shop and behind the door is a modern age speakeasy. Although I did see a few families, I wouldn't say its the right scene. However, for 21s and up, it's such a cool and exciting place. The restaurant has a luxurious vibe, staffed with doormen at every door and even a full serve champagne bar in the bathroom. After a really long wait, despte a reservation, we had the burger, BBQ fries, and the vegan spaghetti. The reason behind my review is that the food was only okay, nothing compared to deco.I would, however, definitely recommend this restaurant for the experience alone.",,,
118,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1048,236,3.0,5/4/2018,"Beauty & Essex is like a super buzzy restaurant that would not look out of place in Chelsea, especially with the volume of people here dressed to impressed and so many of them are clearly from out of town but read in Timeout it was *the* place to be and decided to make a reservation here.I supposed it's neat that this is a ""speakeasy"" restaurant - the storefront looks like a stylized version of a pawnshop (a real pawnshop would have plexiglass and steel bars separating you from the jewels), so you have to pass through an internal door to get to the restaurant. It ends up being much more cavernous than I expected, and the restaurant has a bar in front, but many more seating options in the back. There are tables, booths, and face-to-face couple seating - so plenty of configurations depending on your group size.Be prepared to be yelling because of how absurdly loud the music is. The menu is interesting - lots of creative spins on NYC takeout food, served tapas-style and meant for sharing. Think tomato soup dumplings, spicy salmon tartare, burgers with three kinds of meat, etc. I think the food was pretty tasty, and would have definitely given the cocktails a try if I were up for drinking.I just hated how trendy of a vibe, how ""wannabe"" the guests were at the restaurant, dressing up to the nines and such. It's not my vibe, but if you wanted to impress Cousin Maryanne who's never been to the big ol' city, I think Beauty & Essex would be perfect.",,,

Pricey upscale fancy tapas and drink. Must reserve in advance its hard to get in. I saw people wait online with no reservations and on the way out i still saw some people online waiting so therefor just make reservations ahead of time like a month its hard to make reservations Mostly classy dressing inside especially women areVery dressy and fancy. The skylight in the center makes the people  look fancier and the place upscale.The good dishes you would get lemon pan cakes and grilled cheese dumpling . Just to make sure you get there on time they may not be hold your table more than 10 minutes that means you loose your table .The price is fairly high. This place is an A plus place so probably not for evry body or not for all the time.

Honestly didn't have super high expectations since it seemed like a place where people would go more for the vibe than the food, but the food exceeded my expectations.

They serve their own special champagne in the ladies room. Definitely completes the whole ambience and decor! Cute place for a girls night out. Try to get reservations! They didn't have any open reservations, but you can sit at the lounge/bar and order the full menu. The service is a bit slow but it did get super crowded. The whole lounge was packed, it felt like a club. For food, We got the Bone Marrow, the Grilled cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings, the Scallops, Mini Donuts, and the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese. The bone marrow was fatty and big. It spread well on the crispy toast. Definitely my favorite. The Grilled cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings seemed really cool but it was just okay. It was good at first but then just fell flat after one. The lobster mac 'n' cheese was good, but nothing amazing. The scallops were pretty good! The donuts were piping hot and filled with jelly or Nutella. Pretty good!",1,,1

The grilled cheese, smoked bacon, tomato soup dumplings were exquisite. The LES doughnuts were a sweet treat. The BBQ fries were a new twist on a classic and did not disappoint.

I really liked their cocktail menu and will have to go back since I didn't get to try the beauty elixir. That seemed to be a popular one. I have a spicy margarita and it was great. When we made the reservation they asked us if there was a special occasion. It was my birthday so they brought us two cake balls which was super nice go them. When visiting NYC it's hard to balance your time between trying new restaurants and going back to one that you love. This would definitely be on the ""go back to ones you love"" list.",,,
126,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,183,15,3.0,2/19/2018,"This spot is super kitschy and fun, but there are some drawbacks to eating here.You walk through a jewelry store and on the other side of the wall you are transported to a chic new world. Super fun! Also on the other side, it's gorgeous with a sweeping stair case and a gorgeous foliage covered sky light. As with most New York City restaurants, space is a bit limited. We were seated quite comfortably, however the table next to us was a veritable revolving door of diners, each being seated and then asking to move until some unquestioning college kids were placed there and didn't know enough to ask for a switch, despite waitstaff and other patrons struggled to get by through out their meal.We were here for restaurant week, which allowed us to try a number of different items at a bit of a lower price. However, there was one item not included on the restaurant week menu that our waitress vociferously recommended -- the tomato soup with grilled cheese dumplings. And honestly, this dish was the most disappointing of the lot. The soup was kind of lukewarm and the dish was just not as mind blowing as we were led to believe. Oh well, you live and you learn. I was glad I tried it either way.For our first course, we went with the chile relleno empanadas which were super delicious and on another waitress recommendation we went with the tuna poke wonton tacos, which were solidly good.Second course, we went with the braised short ribs, which was good, but the vegetable hash underneath was very acidic and vinegary.  We also ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious, but incredibly spicy and there was no mention of it being spicy on the menu, at all.For dessert we shared the vanilla panna cotta and the LES, NYC doughnuts. You can't go wrong with either of those.I would come back with maybe a larger group to get a good sampling of all there is to offer, but overall I wasn't terribly impressed by what we ordered.",2,,1
127,Amy S.,"Westerville, OH",17,76,45,3.0,4/19/2018,Nothing was amazing but it's a trendy atmosphere and small plates are fun to share with a group. Service was also good and quick for a busy Wednesday night. Would not recommend the shishito peppers or the chicken meatballs - definitely nothing special and the chocolate peanut butter Whoopie pie was pretty dry and underwhelming. Would probably give this place a 3.5 overall.,,,
128,Torae B.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",432,60,142,4.0,10/16/2017,"Came for the Sunday brunch which was recommended with some friends. My first time being to a tapas style brunch so it was something to get used to. Between three of us we ordered about 6 plates but could've definitely fit more food in. While we were in the dining room there was some strange party upstairs with performers & flashing lights so we wanted to finish our food to see what the big to-do was. Being a server I understood why the service died down towards the end because it was typically the end of brunch and they were probably waiting for us to head out. For my plates the red velvet waffles were good, a little dry but the icing made up for it. We realllly liked the pastrami mac & the chicken biscuit sliders.  Could've done without the lobster hash though. All the lobster pieces were burnt. Ambiance 5, Service 3.5, Food 4",,,
129,Jenny O.,"Washington, DC",231,83,47,4.0,4/16/2018,"3.5 Stars My girlfriends and I came here for my birthday dinner as we came up to New York to celebrate. We had a 6:45 reservation and was not seated until around 7:25. But I do understand that it was a weekend and given a very popular restaurant, lets give them a break. There were five of us and we were seated at a circular booth. The inside decor and ambience was amazing. I loved it. They dimmed the lights and played a good playlist of old school r&b. The food is tapas style, so all of us ordered two to three dishes each. The drinks were delicious. But the food was just ok. I ordered a tuna dish and lobster mac and cheese. Two of my friends ordered the burger ... and it was DRENCHED in oil. I have never seen such a ""wet"" burger in my life. I will say that the bone marrow that my other friend ordered was amazing though. The service was great. Our server was attentive.OH, the best part is the bathroom. They serve champagne there, so make sure you pay a visit.",,,

Service was impeccable and we had the best table in the house for my gfs bday. The entertainment was awesome and the food was yummy. It's a 4 course meal, but since I couldn't eat what the girls could I had eggs in a shell with beans, berries, a kale salad and a veggie dish that was so yum. The brunch comes with a glass of champagne but we ordered a magnum so we could keep the party going. It was so fun! Thank you for the exceptional service and a special bday treat for my gf!",,,2
131,S S.,"Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, NY",3,20,11,3.0,1/16/2018,"First Impression- I decided to have my birthday dinner here, an intimate date with my friend and I on a Friday night. Upon arrival, we're greeted by a doorman and passed what seemed to be a line....or just a couple of stragglers. He asked if we had reservations and directed us to the pawn shop once we informed him that we did. Many reviews state how sketchy and unassuming the front of the restaurant is. How unassuming can a big ass storefront sign fitted with neon lights that blare ""Beauty & Essex"" be? I'll never know. We walked through the pawn shop and opened the doors to the most immaculate dining establishment ever. Gorgeous decor and illuminating fixtures cover every inch of the restaurant. If beautiful people are eye candy, B&E is a goddamn candy shop. This restaurant is apart of the Tao Group, so the decor in some ways is reminiscent of Tao and Vandal, with its own unique appeal of course. Dim lights and clubby music seem to be the preferred ambiance for trendy restaurants nowadays. An elaborate chandelier centered inside of a luxe spiraled staircase makes for beautiful photo ops and after dinner, I seized the opportunity. Dining here makes you feel so fucking classy.Service-Here's where stars begin to come off. The hostess led us through the beautiful and pretentious crowd laced in their Sunday's best and seated us in a large booth where we waited for our server. And waited....and waited. It was 20 minutes before our server acknowledged us. I spotted him walking across the dining hall and we locked eyes; this prompted him to approach us. He greets us. His name is Santiago. He asked for our drink order, but being that we'd already waited I gave him our entire order. Despite our wait, we were very friendly. From the beginning, Santiago seemed disconnected and kind of cold. We order the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, the seafood tower and the Essex burger.  We had two cocktails; the Beauty Elixir and another savory drink I can't recall. I asked him about the lobster Mac and cheese and he recommended it. My friend chimes in and says he would like one as well.  Santiago proceeds to say, ""Two orders? Oh, you must be rich."" Wait,....what? I rolled my eyes so hard I could see the back of my head. I don't walk around with a stick up my ass and I'm not easily offended. His comment just seemed super inappropriate and not made in jest, mostly because he didn't seem welcoming, to begin with. He disappeared the rest of the night checking on our table only once after we received our food. I wanted another cocktail but our phantom server was m.i.a. After our dinner was finished we waited around another 20 mins for the check. My friend reminded him it was my bday (we mentioned this earlier). He came out with a candle and a cake pop. Food-Grilled cheese dumplings were amazing and the best dish we'd had. We immediately wanted another order. Seafood tower was as expected, fresh oysters, little neck clams, etc. Lobster Mac and cheese was average. They drown it in breadcrumbs which detracts from the flavor. Not recommended. Cocktails were delicious and strong.Conclusion-Service was slightly disappointing though the restaurant is everything and more. All in all, I'd definitely come back. It's best to come with friends imo, as the clubby music, upstairs lounge and small plates seem more appropriate. It's paradoxically superficial but with substance,​ because the food is actually great.",10,1,1
132,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,118,0,4.0,2/21/2018,"Beauty and Essex was all I expected it to be... and actually a little bit more. I went there on a Thursday night- at around 9pm the lights when down and the music went up. Still a romantic setting, just a little bit loud. It's a scene. Dress for the occasion. Make a reservation even if it's a weeknight. It's best to save yourself the hassle. All staff is a little pretentious, but that's what I signed up for when I came here. Also, service wasn't that great- our waiter was MIA most of the night or just day dreaming. I had to wave him down to order, to get the check. I would have given 5 stars, but they lose a star for service. The quality of the food pleasantly surprised me. For two people, were ordered 3 tapas because we were only moderately hungry. The waiter told us that parties of 2 usually order 5-6 plates. I thought this sounded excessive and I'm glad I didn't listen. We didn't even finish our 3 plates. Chicken meatballs- Small plate. The hint of Truffle oil is quite strong, but still tasty. The fresh ricotta made this plate. Eggplant pizzetta- This was the largest plate we ordered. Crispy, rich sauce, and again, the whipped ricotta was the highlight. Thai deep fried shrimp- Small plate. Delicious, rich flavor. A bit messy because there is an abundance of slaw.",1,1,1
133,Bing G.,"Queens, NY",333,192,11,2.0,2/9/2018,"Beauty & Essex is known for their cool entry way and avant garde atmosphere, but if you look beyond that there isn't much to rave about. I didn't hate my experience here, but ive definitely had much better brunch experiences in the cityI went with a group of friends for brunch we ordered half the menu to share. While i really enjoyed a few items like the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, i thought everything else was just average. The red velvet waffles were a little dry, the mac and cheese was slightly runny, coffee was bland and tasted like it came from a diner, and the chicken biscuit sandwiches fell apart after the first bite. The staff was nice overall, but they did forget our fish tacos until the very end and took 20 minutes to get it to us after they realised. To top it off, it was pretty overpriced for what it was. I wouldn't pick this place but its popular with the girls and i'm sure i'll end up here again in the future.",2,1,

All wonderful but the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings blew us away! The non-alcoholic cocktail I had was also super delicious! The atmosphere and service were what made our experience worth it though! The ambiance is just so luxe and bougie, if you're into that type of thing - which I really am",,,

The ladies spent way too much time restroom drinking bubbly. Every detail was perfect. We didn't feel rushed. We had a few cocktails to start and a couple of bottles of wine as we explored the menu.Great night.",,,
138,Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",528,323,445,5.0,1/10/2018,"As you walk up, you'll find yourself walking through a gift shop. Once you go in, there's a door at the end that leads to where the real party starts. When you walk into the restaurant, you'll be immediately greeted with lively music. The ambiance? Low-lit and upscale. Perfect place to come on a date or for a night out with friends.As for the food, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I decided to go with the Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta for appetizer. It was good, tasted like your typical flatbread. Now for my entree, I got the Beauty & Essex Burger which was amazing! The combination of: lamb, short rib, and brisket made it taste very unique. Smooth texture and rich flavor. If you come for a birthday or anniversary they will treat you to either a complementary champagne or complementary dessert, so keep that in mind! I received great service from my waiter and had a great time here. Highly satisfied with my visit!",4,,2
139,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,3.0,12/29/2017,"I think my party & I fell into a salt coma after coming here. The food is obviously overpriced and small. The bill was $100 for 4 smallish dishes and was really just okay. They did give complimentary soup, which was great for the winter time and my cousin loved it. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos ($18)- 5/5 This was the best dish we had for the night. They give you 3 small little tacos but they tasted so fresh and delicious. I should have savored it more, thinking back about it now. Surf N' Turf ($35)-3/5 This dish had 2 pieces of scallops and 2 pieces of pork belly. The scallops were so salty I felt like they came right out the sea. And according to my sister/cousin the pork belly wasn't anything special. The best thing about this dish is that the purée was very delicious. P.S. the peppers on the ""salad"" was very spicy... that my cousin needed a glass of milk. Spaghettini ($22)- 3/5 This was way too lemony to the point that it hurt our tongues. The lemon flavor took away the parley pesto flavor (the main flavor). Octopus cassoulet ($16)- 3.5/5 Portion was super tiny compared to the Yelp pictures. Everything was yummy and I asked for chorizo on the side but apparently it's better with it. It's basically beans and octopus with tomato broth.",18,8,11

Although the hostess was nice about it, I'd rather a place such as this (busy and trendy) get a management staff that could maintain a proper flow to their tables.

143,Stacey T.,"New York, NY",152,143,152,3.0,1/16/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here with a gift certificate.  Making a reservation here for prime-time is a pain in the a$$ -- you can only make reservations on Opentable 30 days out and of course as soon as it opens the reservations are scooped up.  We settled with a 9:45pm reservation on a Friday night.  I was surprised no one called me to confirm the reservation the night before/day of so I called.  While I had them on the phone I asked if there was earlier availability and there was not.  We gave ourselves extra time to get there because of inclement weather and street parking, but ended up arriving early.  We checked in and expected to get a drink, but at 9:25pm they were magically able to seat us. Also surprisingly, no one asked to check our coats so the waitress kindly did it for us after we were seated.  We weren't feeling the love for a bit as we saw employees whizzing around without anyone stopping to offer us water or taking our drink order.  I digress, let's get to the food.  We started off with the grilled cheese dumplings which were easily the highlight of the meal, like wow, we should have ordered two of them!  The tuna tacos were also very good, but the wonton shells were heavily fried and had an oily flavor to them.  The lobster mac n cheese was pretty good, but I'm a purist and the breaded topping was a buzzkill.  The bulgogi tacos were also good, same comment about the wonton shells. The crab rangoon was nothing to write home about and I wouldn't recommend it.  The fried shrimp came heavily recommended from the waitress but we didn't think it was anything special, I also wouldn't recommend it.  The ambiance is dimly lit, fun, trendy, with current music playing and plenty of interesting patrons to people watch. It's kind of like if a club and a restaurant had a love child. If someone is visiting town or you're planning a fun night out with a group of people this would be a fun place to come.",1,1,2

Second, Basha, our waitress was very knowledgeable, attentive, and definitely made our experience at the restaurant that much better. She was awesome and her menu recommendations were spot on.Last but not least, the food was delicious. The classic grilled cheese with bacon and tomato soup dumplings are fantastic. We also had the Crab Rangoon and Caesar salad small plates and the other items on the menu were very tasty. I would highly recommend the jelly and Nutella filled doughnuts for dessert.

I would never come here without a reservation or casually for a drink.  That's a shame because it's probably one of the best cocktail menus i've seen at any restaurant, but that crowd just can't be avoided, even with the two bars they have.Went for a birthday dinner not too long ago with 20 people.  One long table so either you're playing musical chairs all night or you're talking to the people in your immediate vicinity.  They did have better, rounder tables but it was a busy saturday night.My brother set up a fixed menu with a million courses on it.  Unfortunately i recently went vegan and when i told the waiter, he just looked at me and said he wish they knew sooner, but they got me.  And boy did they.  One of the most impressive displays of culinary finesse to not only cater to my vegan needs, but to have it be delicious and comparable to what the rest of the party was having.  For example, they brought out seared scallops on a salad, and i got a sear piece of tofu about the same size.  And they did that for everything.  Instead of duck chilaquiles, i got something that didn't make me miss duck or cheese (and i love both).  The rest of the dishes everyone had included some sashimi everyone raved about, from fish mongers to the ""i don't like the smell of fish-""types, everyone loved it.  The pizza was really good (even my version), short ribs on mashed potatoes, scallops, toast with a bunch of delicious toppings, a really lovely pasta dish, and like 8 other things.  I was a few drinks in so you'll have to forgive me.  OH, all the drinks are amazing EXCEPT the one with activated charcoal.  It tastes exactly how it sounds, like an ashtray.  The only thing I've ever had there that made my heart sad lol.And yeah it was crazy expensive but you get great food, service, and a memorable experience.",7,1,3
149,Jess S.,"New York, NY",0,2,7,2.0,11/11/2018,"I had friends and family in town visiting. I'd heard good thing about this place and was excited to finally eat here but left disappointed and offended. The food was honestly just ok at best. Nothing was outstanding, though I'd say the Mac n cheese and the red velvet waffles were quite good. As for cocktails and mocktails, the Bloody Mary was great as well as the platinum peacock. Aside from the food the part that really killed it was our waitress. She was never around which was highly irritating. We asked her to split the bill 5 ways and ended up with different amounts on our checks. As a group we all agreed we'd tip x amount that would make it so everyone's check total was $67. This meant some of us tipped $1.37 and others $30. As we were leaving I happened to catch the waitress making a snarky comment to other staff about the different tip amounts. I approached her and explained had she split the bill evenly like we'd asked, it wouldn't look so odd. Regardless of her inability to do basic math, her tip still came out to 20% of the total check cost. (Which she did not deserve, especially after how she acted as we were leaving)Sadly I wouldn't recommend this place. It's a beautiful space with over priced average tasting food, poor service, and ignorant staff.",,,
150,Caitlin T.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",382,51,64,5.0,3/14/2018,"If you don't like the loungey-type-scene, then stay away. This place is jumpin'. I visited NY from The Bay Area, and came here for my guy's birthday. We made reservations for 11p. I can't speak to the cadence of the restaurant during day time, but at night, there are tons of millennials crowding around the bar and in the lounge area. The ambiance is beautiful, warm, and dark. Perfect for a date night if you enjoy music. Their offerings are tapas-style, so if you're looking for a full-size entrée, you'll have to add-on sides and the like. No problem, a lot of eateries in NY are small-plate/tapas/tasting style. The food was delicious and the cocktails - strong. The experience left nothing to be desired.

Great music, food and crowd is usually the case...however, I would not recommend being there for a birthday or a special event weekend. As a prior server I try my best to be as understanding as possible, however it was very was lackluster service to say the least.My group and I had ordered vegan and non vegan items for the table and also explained that one person was allergic to pork, the soup dumplings got dropped with bacon so they kindly replaced it with another however our server looked turned off that we had eaten dropped off mistake dumplings. Most high end establishments comp their mistake but I was given the impression that wasn't the case. Our server came back and said: so you guys liked those huh? ...I wished they would have taken it from our table if that wasn't the policy. My friend's drink was also forgotten to no real apology except a smiley attitude (response: you don't want your drink now? You have more food otw), and to top it off our first round of waters had raw onion in it. We ordered two more dishes and a fry was clearly forgotten as it was dropped off 10 minutes later. She seemed to touch other tables for extended amount of times and had no real convo with us. I'm assuming she had friends on other tables as that was made apparent throughout the night. It was my 30th and I wished B+E did something to acknowledge a special milestone as noted in my reservation. Having been and worked in high end restaurants I was sadly surprised. I got more acknowledgment of my high school diploma at a Red Robin. I did not want to write this review as I love b+e except I also took my time to kindly explain all of this to a manager it seemed like she would give us a round of shots on the House but instead we got a bill with mistake dumpling, nothing comped, with an additional 15 minute wait for a fix. By the time we finished with a long 3 hour dinner the dance floor was already closed, had service been more smooth without as many mistakes and actual customer service occurred with a regular conversation it would have been clear I was there for a birthday and wanted to dance for a few songs.

I had called a few days in advance to make a reservation for Friday and had specifically requested a more intimate table (booth) as my boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary & did not want to be crammed in a tight space in other people's conversations. We're not local to this area but we quickly discovered that the spacing in New York is very tight. Upon our arrival, we were told if we waited longer we could be seated at a booth. We waited about 25 minutes and was finally seated to a TIGHT spaced table. I was very clearly upset but our server, Eva (Yvette) was SO unbelievably kind and attentive. The service we received from her was unbelievable and had completely turned the night around. 5 Stars for the following: 1. Service was outstanding. Eva, you were amazing and I can't thank you enough. I hope this restaurant recognizes employees like you. 2. Food was great! Kind of small plate but everything had great flavor. If you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend the donuts! 3. Despite the tight space, the environment is cool. Dim lighting and lounge vibes.*1 star lost for the host who was SO rude.

158,Angelina R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,2,5.0,10/10/2018,"I always stop by when in town.  I love this place.  The grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings, meatballs and kale salad are delicious. Champagne bar in ladies room is unique.  I have had to wait past my reservation time,  but a cocktail at the bar can make the wait easier.",,,
159,Justin L.,"Little Italy, Manhattan, NY",44,14,20,4.0,11/27/2017,"Pros:Fun ambiance of entering through a Pawn Shop speakeasy to a trendy bar/dance floor/restaurant.The staff was kind throughout their seating, service, refills, conversation, etc.The Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings is surprisingly comforting and generous in flavor. For the price of $16, getting 6 is pretty high value The Sweet Potato Ravioli was cooked well and the sweetness was refreshing once I bit into the ravioli.The Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Creme had several levels which made it quite rich. Make sure to put your spoon all the way to the bottom and scoop generously The Devil's Food Layer Cake was a pleasant, almost ice cream cake like dessert with a pure mascarpone.All the pricing is pretty reasonable for the location.Cons:The Brick Pressed Lemon Chicken sadly, tasted under seasoned with barely any lemon flavor.",4,,2
160,Karl K.,"Bentonville, AR",99,67,62,4.0,2/8/2018,I had eat here on my fiancé's birthday. I had the chicken meatballs and the lobster mac and cheese. Both dishes were portioned small but that is ok. The chicken meatballs tasted good but even better when you mix the sour cream with the sauce. Hmm what to say about the Lobster Mac and Cheese? The Mac and cheese and a good mix of lobster and Mac.,,,
161,Sherri T.,"Nashua, NH",36,171,56,3.0,6/1/2017,"3 stars are for the creative entrance, décor and friendly, attentive staff.  With all of the great restaurants in NYC, I have a hard time understanding how this place is not only open, but getting away with charging these prices for average food at best.  We had high hopes for this restaurant after visiting Santos' other location where we had great drinks and great food last spring.  Unfortunately our experience the other night was very underwhelming.  The food was ok, but would've been a lot better if the food came out hot.  Even the crab rangoons, that specifically state ""WARM jumbo lump crab"" came out cold!  We don't mind paying a lot of money for good food, but this place didn't even come close.We ordered the following dishes;Crab Rangoon $18 for 3 bite size pieces that were not even close to WARM.Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings $17 recommended by our waiter, but certainly nothing to write home about.  All you could taste was burnt bacon.Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta $17 whipped ricotta was tasty, but the pizzetta itself reminded me of a frozen pizza.  Disappointing.'Chile Relleno' Empanadas $15 and without question the most disappointing dish of the night.  Served COLD and without any real flavor.  The waiter didn't even ask why we didn't eat them, just removed them from the table.  Perhaps its routine for this dish?Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp $23 Way overpriced dish lacking any distinct flavor.Crispy Fish Tacos $24  Pretty expensive dish for 3 small tacos, but probably our favorite dish of the night with the most flavor.Add 2 glasses of wine from their average wine by the glass list and coffee which totaled almost $200 for one of the most disappointing meals I've had for that price in a long time.",3,,
162,Kenny N.,"Minneapolis, MN",262,179,254,4.0,8/4/2017,"Beauty & Essex is a 3.5 stars. Led by Chris Santos, guest star of Chopped, the restaurant is a well-known trendy establishment in the Lower East Side, NYC with additional locations in Vegas and LA. The exterior to the restaurant is a little interesting. It is not what you expect and has only the sign of the restaurant displayed. The first thing you see when you walk in is a pawn shop, with no signs that there may any evidence of a restaurant. Take a closer look and there is a door behind the cashier that will lead you to the actual restaurant. Immediate thoughts was this must definitely be a place where all the socialites and A-listers hang out. It has a bougie-type vibe to it with the dimly lit setting and the young, well-dressed professionals occupying the space. There are two levels to this restaurant with our waitress taking us to the upper level. He was friendly, responsive, and made sure that our first experience went well. I took some recommendations by Yelp and these were some that we orderedOrdered: Appetizers- Chile Salted Shishito Peppers (4/5). Decent appetizer. The peppers are crunchy and a refreshing with a small hint of heat to it - Tomato Soup Dumplings (5/5). Delicious and one of my favorite dishes out of all we ordered. Each spoon had a small dumpling on it and the key is to eat it with one bite. This appetizer reminds me of the 'Din Tai Fung' experience when ordering perfect dumplings - Crispy Fish Tacos (5/5). Excellent. The diakon and carrots complemented with the sea bass. A must tryMains- Chicken meatballs (3.5/5). You will know it is gourmet meatballs but there is something with it... I've had better versions (e.g. Julianna's in Brooklyn)- Pan seared scallops (5/5). Great. Always a fan of scallops and this was beautiful with the homemade harissa paste - Lobster Mac & Cheese (2.5/5). Firstly, I am not a big fan of cheese so my review is a bit skewed. That said, this dish was not that good as it felt dry and the lobster didn't very come out of the dish - ""Fries"" (1/5). Cannot remember the name of the dish on the top of my head but it was like a poutine of fries and meat. It was not so good. Very cold, old tasting, and overall a disappointmentDesserts - Box of Doughnuts (5/5). Delicious and I don't like desserts. The raspberry jam donut holes are a must try. It instantly melts in your mouth and you will be doing the famous 'Mark Weins' facial expressionOverall, B&E is a decent restaurant but I would go here for the appetizer / drinks to celebrate or have a happy hour",,,
163,Rickeda T.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",307,2,2,5.0,8/1/2018,"So for the Overall Experience I would still give them 5 stars. Even though everything you could think of went wrong! They brought my cake to the wrong table, Health Department was there so no drinks. Glasses on Table were dirty. It was a beautiful disaster Bc they went above and beyond to make my birthday the best experience. They sent rounds and rounds of champagne. Shots on them. Sent extra food to the table for everyone to share. And then half off on the bill. Landon was an amazing waiter! He was fun and spunky and really tried his best to make sure, I had the best experience. I can't remember the managers name but she was super amazing too!

This Not was a speakeasy night and Beauty and Essex was on our list of sexy speakeasys to hit up ! Upon entrance, the outside is super shady, you literally feel like you're entering a pawn shop in a shutdown street in Vegas haha ! When you walk in you're greeted by someone who is too dressed up to work in a pawn shop !  Then she tells you you can shop or enter , there isn't a line tonight ! Can i just say - my friends and I walked in laughing . And wow!When we walked in there were two y'all body guards all suited up. Inside looked like you entered the nightclub at Great Gatsby's mansion! Dimly lit with candle like lights  and chandeliers. The hosts at the table were very nice. You must dress up when you come here ! You will definitely be singled out if you don't! My girls and i got a few cocktails  and the delicious dessert shots ! Our waitress was super friendly and nice ! Girls- BTW! You'll love it when you enter the bathroom. Honestly you can just hangout in the bathroom . They had champagne for us in the restrooms, and all the girl amenities that you'd need: body mist, deodorant, hairspray, dry shampoo, baby powder, face wipes, and cream/ body lotion. Plus they even had a lady that handed you a dry napkin to dry your hands after you washed them in the ultimate sink and layout plan of the restroom! Omg ! I strongly recommend a cute surprise date here or a GNO!!!",,,1
165,Stephanie H.,"The Heights, Jersey City, NJ",113,1,0,5.0,8/3/2018,"My friend and I recently went for dinner during the week and had a phenomenal time. Service:I couldn't be happier with the service we received and I actually think this was the best part of my experience. Our specialty cocktails came out surprisingly fast (maybe I am just used to slow bar service but it made my night).  When we order the Crab Rangoon Toast, our waiter quickly told us it only come with 3 portions and ask if we would like a 4th portion so we could evenly share.  Those attention to details really make a difference. Food:We decided to share everything and we got the Crab Rangoon Toast, Chile Relleno Empanadas, Grilled Cheese Smoked Bacon & Tomato Dumplings, Bulgogi Ribeye Tacos, Doughnuts, and Butterscotch Pot de Creme.  Everything was equally delicious but I really recommend the Bulgogi Tacos and Butterscotch - definitely the highlights.  The only thing I would say are the portions are small.  The food is high quality, but if you are coming with an eater you can definitely spend a lot!Ambiance:It's definitely bougie, but sometimes that's nice right?  The front pawn shop is cool, the inside of the restaurant is gorgeous and even the bathrooms are super nice. They weirdly serve free champagne in the bathroom, if that's your thing be sure to bring some cash to tip the poor girl stuck in there!",,,
166,Crystal D.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,4,5.0,7/18/2018,Such a fun spot. Food is great! Entrance is deceiving which makes it that much more cool and interesting. Service was great. Fast and hot. We got our dinner right after the appetizers. The waiter was super sweet and recommends great drinks as well as have us a glass of champagne and desert on the house to celebrate our anniversary! Upstairs is a cool lounge area to continue your evening instead of heading out to find another spot to have drinks. Would totally come here again to double date or with a group of friends as his is a great spot of groups as well.,,,
167,Kim-Anh P.,"Houston, TX",494,462,84,3.0,12/1/2017,"Went here earlier this year with friends. As many others mentioned, it's like a speakeasy restaurant. An assuming in the front, looks like a pawn shop. Honestly, we were a little confused looking for it when friends asked to meet there. What's most memorable to me is the place itself. Go beyond the back door in the pawn shop and be awed by the beautiful restaurant behind with a swanky bar and lounge. To be seated, we climbed the lovely grand staircase to a cozy corner table and shared lots of dishes among the four of us. What is most memorable to me is in the women's bathroom, which is fairly large, is a bar that serves champagne. Kind of funny because remember going into the stall the use the the bathroom, and could hear some girls say ""cheers!"" and clinking glasses. Then as I washed my hands I craned my neck around the mirror to see the bar. Weird or cool? You decide. But definitely different!Food was good. Not happy about the 30+ minute wait even though we had reservations. The place is definitely an experience.",1,1,1
168,Charlene L.,"West Sayville, NY",250,64,603,5.0,10/26/2017,"The small plates are delicious, but I am coming back for the desserts!!! Here's why....Everyone walks into a dumpy looking pawn shop. Head straight to the back door and find a grand opulent chandelier right above you. The restaurant is huge, goes back far and spiral staircase heads up to a second floor. Service was so friendly and knowledgeable. Our waitress offered great recommendations.We got a bottle of sparkling rosè which paired well with everything. We started with complimentary pumpkin soup, then tomato tartare with quail egg. This quail egg was so savory and warmed perfectly. Eggplant pizzette and chicken meatballs were ok. The best was the bone marrow. Savory, salty sweety. I could eat like 50.I don't really go nuts over desserts. Usually only one or two bites and just sip Sambuca. That was until I tried the Peanut Butter Whoppie Pie. Woahhh! It's genius. The Marshmellow with salty crunchy peanut brittle was amazing. I dream about it every night.This restaurant is pricy! But an ideal choice for a special occasion.",8,2,4
169,Danielle P.,"Orlando, FL",873,139,1387,5.0,10/29/2017,"Went to Beauty & Essex last night for a one-day stop in NYC and was far beyond impressed. Upon entering what looks like a pawn shop, you are led to a back door which leads you to the beautiful hybrid restaurant/bar/club that is Beauty & Essex. I came in at around 10pm to have a late dinner which was great timing. There were lots of people, loud music, food, drinks, everything! The beautifully decorated and well-organized area gave an extremely positive and fun New York City vibe which I had never experienced before. I had a reservation so I was seated fairly quickly despite the amount of people. MAKE A RESERVATION!! I was led to my table up a large spiral staircase beneath a beautiful chandelier. We passed a dance floor and super cool bar with lights and a DJ booth (which, btw was playing the absolute best possible music the entire time). We sat down and ordered the drinks we had already selected- Emerald Gimlet and The Woodsman. Both drinks were brought out momentarily and were phenomenal. The Emerald Gimlet is a fresh vodka-based cocktail with cucumber/lime flavors and a perfect hint of basil. The Woodsman (served with Woodford Reserve) was described as a lighter, more refreshing version of an Old Fashioned. We paired these drinks with a couple of small plates and entrees.The first thing we said when we sat down is that we will need to be patient because it's busy and our food will definitely take a while. This was not the case at all! The first appetizer that came out was the Hand Cut Steak Tartare with Swedish pickled beets, anchovy crème fraiche on top of a mustard dill rice cake. We also ordered a side of the octopus cassoulet which was very unique but also had amazing strong flavors of tomato broth & chorizo. For entrees, we shared Brick Pressed Lemon Chicken and Braised Short Ribs . The Brick Pressed Lemon Chicken was served with hen of the woods mushrooms, kale, and a delicious chicken jus sauce which brought all of the flavors together. The Braised Short Ribs were amazing. Cooked perfectly and were so tender you didn't even need to use a knife to cut them! Served with creamed Brussels sprouts and pearl onion gastrique all on top of a bed of smoked yukon potatoes. The presentation of medium-sized short rib chunks on top of the potatoes really allowed for you to get all of these flavors in every single bite! This was definitely a favorite! We were so genuinely impressed by this meal. I could not have asked for anything more!Going to Beauty & Essex basically make my one day in NYC absolutely perfect. There's something to be said about the fact that I had been running around all day, missed a few big landmarks I wanted to go to, was tired and disappointed but then I went to this loud, crazy, crowded spot and my mood was just completely turned around! I already can't wait til the next time I go to NYC to I can come back to Beauty & Essex and try the rest of their craft cocktails, phenomenal plates, and dance around the lights and upbeat music!",4,1,2

Our waitress made sure everything came out in a timely manner and brought out empanadas on the house. At the end of the brunch brought out a dessert for the bride to be- how sweet!We ordered a bunch of different things and I felt like the price wasn't bad. The g/c, smoked bacon, & tomato soup dumplings are a must. My friends enjoyed the kale & apple salad. The lobster & chorizo hash were a hit. I got the chicken meatballs with sheep's milk ricotta. The meatballs were good but the ricotta was a little too strong for my liking so I had to brush it off. For the service and ambiance, I give beauty & essex 5 stars!",1,,1

Okay, so I came here with my mom for brunch. The front looks like a pawn shop, it will throw you off!  We ordered the vanilla beignets, fried chicken bites, and grilled cheese dumplings (MY GOD). Vanilla beignets - crispy, covered in cinnamon sugar outside but pillow soft inside. Not a fan of the raspberry jam. Fried chicken bites - the Tabasco honey butter is AMAZIG! Reminds me of Chrissy Teigen's cholula butter for her wing recipes. A LITTLE too much slaw but was very tasty. Grilled cheese dumplings - GOD BLESS THESE DELICIOUS BITCHES.

Those 10 minutes were spent enjoying free champagne in the ladies restroom. Major props to the genius behind that idea!! Go easy on the champagne as the cocktails here will blow your mind. The Black Tie White Noise and the Emerald Gimlet were ridiculously delish (and strong)! The grilled cheese and soup dumplings were a big hit with us! The eggplant pizzetta was good but nothing special. My husband devoured his crab rangoon in minutes. For dessert, we chose the butterscotch pot de crème and devil's cake. Yum yum!! I gotta try the shake shots and doughnuts next time coz they looked real good.This was such a fun dinner place.

The rest is just drop dead gorgeous everything is over the top beautiful even down the bathroom where they serve courtesy drinks !! The upstairs also turns to a club/ dance party on specific nights.They serve small dishes I believe that's called family style where you just order multiple meals so you can share them with your table! The price I believe are extremely reasonable which came as a shocker!The drink selection and the waiters/waitresses know their drinks! And they are on top of their tables but don't hover!

All the stuff members were calm and friendly which is remarkable because in my opinion it's not an easy task in such a high volume place!

That's where a the positive stops...Go to beauty and Essex if you want to get your whole purse stolen despite having not gotten up from your chair during dinner.

Go to beauty and Essex if you want zero cooperation and communication from the restaurant post event.

I'm in toal agreeance with everyone, the space is beautiful, cool, romantic and sexy. The secret doorway to the back restaurant is definitely a unique feature. Walking in you feel transported from the dingy streets of NY's LES to a hip speakeasy style environment. The glamour ends there. Once seated we ordered drinks and appetizers. This included fish tacos, soup dumplings with cheese, and the Thai shrimp.  For entree I had the 24oz Ribeye with  lobster mac and cheese, my husband had the Atlantic salmon. Our friends ordered the Peruvian chicken and hamburger meal with came with french fries. Now this is my honest feedback. I only really enjoyed the crispy shrimp. That's it!! Everything else was just mediocre and i will sadly not return to this fancy establishment. Unfortunately the lounge area which can serve as a pre or post night cap offers overpriced and lackluster offerings. Don't get me wrong my husband and I don't mind paying for a great meal, but this is just not the place for us. Fancy restaurant with a sup par meal is not our idea of a great Saturday night. This restaurant reminded me of Tao. Great ambiance, seemingly perfectly for date night but the food is just horrible.",,,
183,Chrissy L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",150,10,21,5.0,2/18/2018,"This was my first stop during Restaurant Week. This  place set high expectations for the others I visited! I love that you walk into a pawn shop and then walk into this grand, almost mansion like restaurant. What a surprise! Started off with the grilled cheese bites and tomato soup. DELICIOUS!!!! The presentation was very cute too. First course, I chose the Chile Relleno Empenadas. Thought it would come with one, but came with 4 mini ones. The flavors were good and they were crisp! My friend had the kale salad, very big portion and the dressing was perfect. Second course was the Braised Short Rib and OMG! The meat melted in my mouth, easily cut with a fork. Sauce perfectly complimented it. Creamed Brussels was nothing I expected. They were chopped and seasoned well. Everything on the plate was to die for. Damn near wanted to lick my plate!!!! My friend chose the pasta, which was good as well. Had a little kick to it, which I liked. For desert we chose all 3. 4 huge donut bites, with 3 different sauces. Donuts were warm and not too chewy. Red velvet cupcakes were moist. But the Panna Cotta was the star! It was dense, but a perfect consistency. Underneath was a berry sauce and when scooped all at once it was the best bite!The other win for this restaurant is if your a lady, please visit the restroom. There is complimentary champagne!!Overall, I would come back here any day. This place has great presentation, everything is seasoned well and cooked perfectly. No complaints!!! It also turns a bit more clubby later in the night with a DJ, so I will definitely be back! Expectations exceeded!",,,

My steak was supposed to be medium but it was well done, the eggs were supposed to be over-easy but they were fully cooked. Scrambled egg toast with salmon was cold, and tasteless. The serving size is smaller than many other restaurants (though the burgers were fine). The music was too loud.

187,Alicia W.,"San Francisco, CA",480,64,62,5.0,6/21/2017,"One of my favorite bars in New York so far. The entrance is through a pawn shop (unsure if it actually operates...). After you enter, there's two floors, with the restaurant downstairs while the bar and seating area are up a grand staircase. My favorite drinks are the Beauty Elixir and the Woodsman. Beauty elixir is really sweet and there's barely any alcohol taste, while the Woodsman is stronger and also an interesting green color. Cocktails are expensive at 16 $ but the environment and decor is nice, so if you're willing to spend a little this place is perfect. Haven't yet tried the food here since we usually go upstairs to the seating areas. Also, in the girls bathroom there's a area with a few sofas and rosè or champagne in exchange for tips. The boys bathroom is allegedly normal though.",,,
188,Kalon S.,"Dallas, TX",20,93,70,5.0,10/24/2017,"Literally one of my favorite places in New York City! I come here every time I'm in New York. They have the best food and drinks. Great for a night on the town with the girls, or even a nice first date. What I love is you'd never know it was even there. You have to walk through a pawn shop to get to the restaurant and it's two stories. (Well three if you include the basement leave where the bathroom is)The main level is where you can sit down and eat there's also a bar. The upper level is a lounge where you can sit on the couch and have dinner/drinks or sit at the bar area. They also have a DJ. I'm not sure if the DJ is there every night but all the times that I've been there's been one. Again, I love this place! I always order their emerald gimlet (favorite cocktail), oysters, their grill cheese with Tomato soup (literally the best thing ever), the avocado toast. Let's just say you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. I have ordered it all and have never sent anything back!",2,,

First if nothing else order the beauty elixir. Hands down my favorite drink in NYC and have been coming back to get it for the last 5-6 years. Their cocktails are amazing though. Also tried a basil one my friend got and it was so fabulous. Second there is champagne in the women's bathroom which is the most amazing secret (not so secret) ever. Bring cash to tip them and your Id. We ate the tomatoes soup dumplings, tuna poke tacos, meatballs, lobster Mac, Thai shrimp, sweet potato ravioli and chocolate cake. We also started with a butternut squash soup amuse bouche which was really good. We ordered the tomato soup dumplings twice the group lived them so much! The tacos were our second favorite.

There was a brunch party going on upstairs and in order to be seated in the dining area, one needed reservations, which I will be sure to make next time. The hostess was pretty nice and the restaurant very spacious. I just want to know why there's a miniature Notorious Big figurine with gold chains  in the window...",1,1,3
191,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,43,16,4.0,1/19/2018,"I have only been here for brunch but it is my go-to place to bring out of towners to impress. The whole ""enter through the pawn shop"" thing is a little kitschy because it's clearly not a secret, but the ambience inside is awesome.The first several times I visited, we did the a la carte brunch, where you're seating in the main dining area. The menu is small plates, which can get a little pricey and if you add drinks (cocktails are $17), it's definitely a bit of a splurge, but so good.Recently, I made reservations for 1pm on a Sunday and they accidentally assumed I meant Champagne Brunch. Best mistake ever! I will only attend Champagne Brunch from here on out. Everyone is seated at the same time, upstairs. The room is more intimate than the main dining room and dark. There's music and towards the end they come around and hand out glow sticks. It's tons of fun. But the best part is the food! I assumed the menu was a ""pick one from each category"" sort of affair, but no, you get everything on the menu, plus champagne! I think it cost around $60/person which is less than our normal brunch spend and we got way more food. The only thing that concerned me a little was the table next to us had 3 people and they received the exact same portions as our party of 2, even for items like the grilled cheese soup dumplings (you get 4) which aren't ""shareable."" Since you're paying per person, I would expect the portions to be divided evenly. Mostly, I made a note to myself to only come in even groups.Some menu highlights: Red Velvet Waffles, Kale & Apple Salad, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites",,,
192,Flavio L.,"Pinecrest, FL",110,31,19,5.0,5/9/2018,"Things to love about this place: almost everything. Just visited this place on my last trip to NY and did the Sunday champagne brunch. Keep in mind their champagne brunch is a different brunch than their regular. This is only on the 2nd floor and it's fix price per person. At first I was skeptical about the amount or quality of food being a fixed menu. HOWEVER, I was quickly proven wrong. The quantity and quality of the food was superb. In addition this is a perfect pl d when you want kinda like a day brunch/party. You quickly forget what time of the day it is...haha. Anyways, def. try it out, a reservation is a must, and def. choose their champagne brunch upstairs, I believe it was around $75 per person...worth it!",1,,
193,Frank T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,0,1.0,5/23/2018,"Was excited for a fun post work Wednesday evening dinner with friends. Arrived for our 8:45 reservation and was given a pager. After about a 30 minute wait (with two pregnant women) we went check on our table. We were told it wouldn't be much longer of a wait. We asked what length of time that meant, ""10 minutes, 20 minutes."" - ""no no no, definitely not that long.""20 minutes later we handed them back their pager and went to another restaurant.",1,,
194,Priscilla B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",36,12,49,4.0,3/4/2018,Where do I start.If you want to be part of loud and fun crowd you want to be upstairs. Great music and a very upscale beautiful place.Champagne brunch is $68 and it includes of glass of champagne. If you want any other drinks they are $17 each. Menu for brunch is pre-fix!Not worth the $68!!Everything is bite size to share.Workers don't check on you much unless you are someone who is buying a bottle. They have wonderful  entertainment from the,,,
195,Jen B.,"New York, NY",220,23,14,4.0,8/22/2018,"Came here last Friday for restaurant week. Shared each course. For apps I shared tuna tartare tacos and the empanadas. I definitely preferred the tacos, but both were tasty. Main course I split the short ribs and salmon. The short ribs were delicious, sort of reminded me of a bbq plate, but the portion was quite small. The salmon was good, nothing unique, but a great portion size. For dessert I had the coconut peanut cake pop, which I did not like at all because the inside had chunks of peanuts in it and it wasnt a smooth cake texture and also I found the flavor combination weird. The donuts were fantastic though, especially with the caramel and chocolate dipping sauces.",,,1
196,Rosa M.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",20,25,99,5.0,6/24/2018,It's summer time and my sister and I are starting off the season with a wonderful brunch at Beauty and Essex. The vintage atmosphere and huge skylight give this restaurant the NYC charm. I had the fried chicken biscuit bits and they were delicious. Come by for a good treat.,,,
197,Taiyyab Z.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1935,376,5944,5.0,3/7/2017,"Fantastic. This place seems to have it all.The setup is fantastic. Front of the restaurant is a pawn shop. Once you make it through to the actual restaurant you are taken to a lovely lounge type vibe..definitely a sexy spot. They had a live dj when I was here who kept the vibe flowing and going :).  I could go on and on about the designs but you might as well pay a visit as this is one of the best spots in NYC.The service was fantastic the waiter was down with the crew kept us informed on menu options and we went town with that.The drinks were fantastic.Omg the Food...how do I describe perfection? Oh perfection lol. It looked fantastic and tastes just as good.The complementary soup hit the started off the Adventure in Foodistan. The lobster mac and cheese, lamb burger....you know what let me just tell you what was bad here!! That was Nothing...I mean nothing was bad here ;)Very rare are there places that can offer what Beauty & Essex  offers.You want a night out with the fellas? Date? Chilling with homies? Friends in from out of town? Beauty and Essex hits on all those notes.Enjoy the Pics and Videos:)",59,32,50
198,Julia T.,"Calgary, Canada",55,81,6,4.0,5/23/2018,"In the land where secret code entrances and invite only moving parties reign supreme, Beauty and Essex gives us regular people a taste of the exclusive life. Fronted by the fanciest pawn shop front I've seen, hidden doors give way to a lavishly decorated, mood lighted resto-lounge verberating with the latest club bangers (but still low enough for conversation). We arrived relatively late (around 9-10pm) so the place was full but with walking and sitting room. After some confusion with seating, we were placed in a booth in the main dining room. Between 3 people, we Ordered the roasted baby carrots, broccolini, spicy salmon tartare, shisito peppers, Thai style shrimp and some other items I can't quite remember. While the food was good, I wouldn't say it was fantastic. Maybe it was the timing (1hr to close) but, I could barely eat the overcooked carrots soaked in a sweet sticky sauce and the Thai style shrimp lacked the depth and tang of most Thai style dishes. With a couple of tequila shots and drinks, our bill came to around $180USD with tax and gratuity. It wasn't cheap but, it wasn't overly expensive either.For the atmosphere and uniqueness of this place, I would come back for a second try. It wouldnt be at the top of my list but, if I had friends who wanted to try (even just for the experience/atmosphere), I would definitely come back. It's a cool spot to check out.",,,
199,Siobhan M.,"New York, NY",7,31,43,5.0,10/7/2017,Made a reservation about a week in advanced for my bf birthday came here on a Thursday night. My only complaint is the table I'll be honest it sucked we were squished between two other two tops and I did have the reservation so I felt kind of annoyed but I'm not really one to speak up and complain so I didn't. Anyway everything else was amazing. The ambience and decor here is really so beautiful it really is a cool experience. It really gives off a cool speakeasy vibe and we loved it. We both had the beauty elixir cocktail which was delicious and generously poured I got up to use the bathroom and I definitely felt tipsy after one. We split the wontons in the tomato soup which was a flavor explosion in your mouth so good. I had the tuna which was served rare and was the best I've ever had. My bf had the ribeye portion size was enough to feed a family but it was phenomenal and it came with 4 special sauces that were out of this world. Service was just ok we would've probably had another cocktail if she came to check on us but everything else was perfect.,1,1,1
