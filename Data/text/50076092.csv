Well done, juicy and tasty.  The pancakes were only okay.  A bit dry but still tasty enough.I'd be interested in trying dinner here.",,,

Updated review","three stars for good food and lighting.lost a star because the Cosmo didn't have enough vodka lost another star because of the stupid rock n roll music blasting, WTF is rock and roll doing in a French inspired restaurant for grown ups? Ever hear of Charles Aznavour or Edith Piaf or Syvie Vartan to name a few?",,,
2,Biana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",424,71,57,4.0,11/12/2018,"Great brunch at Cafe D'Alsace! Started with some complimentary artisanal breads. Everything on the menu sounded so tasty and we came so hungry that we decided to order family style for the table. We ordered the steak tartar, which was absolutely incredible - fresh, seasoned with crisp course salt among other ingredients. Had the Frisee Aux Lardons salad which was refreshening but nothing special and would probably not order it again. We then shared the Smoked Salmon Duo which came with a generous portion of Norwegian smoked salmon, a creamed salmon salad and plenty of bread and bagels to go around. For entrees, we ordered the Omelette Maison (my personal favorite), Eggs Petatou (warm cheesy potatoes with poached eggs which I also enjoyed but the rest of my party was not so fond of... has a pretty sharp Munster taste), Shakshuka (tasty but heavy on the onions), and lastly a French onion soup which my brother was disappointed by (though he is a harsh critic of French onion soup). Overall, the starters were much more enjoyable than the mains, however I was incredibly impressed by the various flavor profiles, fantastic service and fresh and clean presentation. Would definitely come back! Note, we were seated as a party of four immediately for Sunday brunch with other tables and bar area available, so reservations are not mandatory.",,,
3,Tracy D.,"Merrick, NY",268,414,2032,4.0,11/12/2018,"Wanting to try a new place for brunch, my husband and I decided to check out this cute little French restaurant for brunch on an early Saturday morning.  Since they do not take reservations for brunch, it's first come, first served. We came around 10am (about an hour after opening) and we were still able to get a seat right away without a problem. When we were leaving it did appear to be a wait for a table.The brunch menu had a good variety of savory and sweet items to choose from. You also can order a cocktail if you choose, but we stuck to Belgian hot chocolate and coffee since it was a cold day. While you are waiting for your meal they serve a basket of breads with raspberry jam and butter. We decided to get sweet entrees (brioche French toast and buttermilk pancakes). I really liked the raspberry coulis and syrup that went with the French toast. The toast was thick cut and spongy. I did wish that the French toast batter was more custard in flavor, but that's just my preference. Overall the service was really good. Our waiter made sure our glasses of water and coffee were always full.I really thought it was a good idea of them to have the wash station separate from the bathroom stalls, so if anyone wanted to just wash their hands, they can. We would definitely consider going back to try one of their savory dishes, but I would highly recommend going early if you want to guarantee a shorter wait time for a table.",1,,
4,Jun L.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",106,33,129,4.0,11/10/2018,"We came here for a quick brunch on a Saturday with a few friends while in town. The place is packed! We didn't have to wait too long for a table though. We tried the Shakshuka with sausage, which was bold and flavor packed. The crab omelette is nicely paired with avocado and corn, thus refreshing but requires a little more kick (maybe some spicy sauce on the side?) especially compare to the Shakshuka. My kid has the waffles which were fantastically crunchy. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would recommend if in mood for a more traditional brunch spot.",,,
5,Melissa E.,"Long Island, NY",2,90,111,5.0,11/8/2018,"Came here for dinner the other night, and I was blown away. We started off with two delicious, buttery popovers (my new preferred bread basket). For appetizers, we ordered their rich lentil soup special and beet & goat cheese salad special. Both were really good. My friend ordered their farmhouse chicken and said it was delicious. I got the sea bass with potatoes and veggies (with some avocado and balsamic), and it was yummy too. For dessert, we went for the caramelized apple tart. It was one of the prettiest desserts and the flakiness of the pastry, the level of tartness of the apples, and the sweet vanilla ice cream were PERFECT. I will be back for sure!",,,
6,Bernie T.,"New York, NY",164,172,6,5.0,11/16/2018,"Had a really nice anniversary brunch here with my husband. No reservation needed, and we were served right away.

7,Lily C.,"Manhattan, NY",165,83,222,4.0,11/3/2018,"We made a dinner reservation for 4 here at 8:30pm on a week night. We were seated right away. The cocktail menu here is quite interesting. We ordered a Taipei (East of Taipei or Taste of Taipei) related drink that was delicious. We all ended up getting the fixed 3 course dinner meal with an appetizer, entree and dessert. The steak tartar appetizer was a big portion so I was already a bit full from that. I had the mussels and pork belly entree which was quite good. There were tiny little pieces of pork belly inside the pot of mussels. I then had the hazelnut and chocolate cake for dessert. What can I say, you can't go wrong with that choice!",,,1
8,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",177,136,573,4.0,8/18/2018,"Came here for restaurant week lunch. Dishes: - Salmon tartare (a bit oily, not much flavour) - Duck terrine (very good) - Grilled salmon (tender) - Grilled bass (tender, the potatoes were really good) The service is quite slow. A large table that came in after us got served first. The food was really good and the environment is relaxed. They have cute outside seating options with flowers and greenery around. I may come back if I'm in the area again.",1,,
9,Melissa Z.,"Charlottesville, VA",349,47,58,3.0,10/21/2018,"I wanted to give this place a higher review because of the service - we were given bread and jam/butter and our server was very attentive. However, I ordered the shakshuka and it was covered in melted cheese with huge chunks of onions and some halves of cherry tomatoes. It was extremely disappointing and so you really couldn't dip the bread and I really didn't know where the egg or eggs were and couldn't taste it since all the cheese was hidden. Would not recommend getting - food in general seemed pretty not special.",,,
10,Cathi O.,"St. Augustine, FL",12,21,33,5.0,10/26/2018,"After a light dinner at Vietnaam, walked across the street to this inviting looking restaurant for dessert. Had the profiteroles of course, with some port. They were very nice didn't mind I was just solo only looking for dessert. It was such a big portion I offered to give one to the table next to me. Ended up having a fun chat with those two guys! The atmosphere was cozy even though it's not a small place. All and all I wish I was in NYC longer so I could have brunch or dinner there.",,,
11,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",535,295,292,4.0,9/23/2018,"A surprisingly satisfying brunch! My friend and I came here around 11am on a Saturday and this place was PACKED. We were lucky enough to come right before the brunch rush. Cafe D'Alsace does not take reservations. The started bread with the almonds is REALLY good. I wish they didn't give it to us though because I ate so much of it that I was already full before the meal started. We ordered the French toast, eggs Benedict, and shakshuka.Eggs Benedict was pretty standard. It came with a side salad and potatoes. Definitely enjoyed it, but wasn't anything special. Shakshuka tasted too tomato-y, didn't taste that great to me. I also only had a few bites though, so I could be wrong. I think this is a dish you can skip, though - there are a lot of other amazing brunch options here. The French toast was really good, probably my favorite out of the 3. The toast was soft and egg-y, although the edges were a bit dry. I enjoyed the strawberry syrup on the side as well. I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee. It was less sweet than I expected, and also a lot stronger. Overall, glad we stumbled across this place and will definitely return.",4,1,6
12,Elei Z.,"New York, NY",96,71,419,2.0,8/13/2018,"Saturday, brunch at 3:30pm. Late brunch, but their weekend brunch is open until 4pm. Close to Yorkville tennis. Chill. It was relatively empty when I was there, which was nice. But, given how empty it was, the service was inattentive and lacking. Servers were talking with each other and seemed to having a good time (dancing around), that's fine, but my water wasn't refilled and my smoked bacon never came. Then, when I asked for a coffee refill, the server accidentally spilled the coffee over my French Toast. I like the space, cute bistro feel. But the two person tables are way too small for the dish sizes. And I was a little appalled at how many flies there were just flitting around. Yes, it's summer and it's open, but there really shouldn't be THAT many, large and small... I would've tried the bread, but it didn't look appetizing after seeing a fly emerge from both the bread basket and the butter.Food came out quickly. French toast at first place didn't seem appetizing. It seemed very dry when I cut into it. Wasn't as dry as I expected, but wasn't juicy either. Lacking in both moisture and flavor - neither egg-y nor brioche-y. Strawberries were so sour, even the maple syrup didn't help. But, it was soft. Still, wouldn't get it again. Maybe I'll try the waffles if I ever come back. The bacon was decent. I thought about just telling the server to take it off my order because it never came, but decided I wanted bacon after all. After reminding the server, I finally got the bacon, hot and sizzling. Tasteful, thin, but far too tough. Maybe it was because they rushed it to compensate for forgetting about it? Who knows.",,,
13,Syd R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",255,43,120,5.0,10/25/2018,Love Cafe D'Alsace for both brunch and dinner! Some of the best French Onion soup I've ever had.  The inside is cute and the bar is very aesthetically pleasing. The waiters are always really nice. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.,,,
14,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,5.0,7/12/2018,"This place is officially my new go-to for a perfect upscale brunch on the UES, you feel like you're in a cafe somewhere in Europe the second you walk in!. Really pretty space with indoor and outdoor seating, the waitstaff is all very professional but also nice. Delicious bread basket comes before your meal with homemade bread and these almond pastry things that were absolutely delicious. Prices may seem on the higher end but they are super reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get, and the vibe of the restaurant. I had the eggs Benedict which was perfect, a really nice light hollandaise sauce, well poached eggs, outrageously delicious potatoes that were spiced to perfection, and a really big salad! My friend got the apple pancakes which he loved and was a pretty large portion size as well.I would recommend this place to anyone for brunch, definitely good for any size group, and will be back myself to try more menu items soon!",1,,

18,John M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,223,138,4.0,8/19/2018,"I came here for lunch and tried the small ""Frizze"" salad as an appetizer.   It is served with an escarole type of lettuce, vinaigrette dressing, croutons, a soft boiled egg and French bacon (lardons).   It was very good.   The bacon was a little too crunchy.   They don't serve French bread with the meal, instead they serve Gougères.    It is a cheese puff and was excellent.I then decided to try the shakshuka baked with an egg and cheese.   I was curious how their version was since it is a dish my mom and grandmother made.   Our family recipe has green peppers, onions, garlic, bay leaves and fresh tomatoes.   This vegetarian dish is cooked on low heat for at least an hour.   Well their version had red peppers instead of green peppers and not enough garlic.   The egg and cheese on top of it made it a brunch type of dish.   It was served with toasted French Farmer's bread which was excellent.   Finally on top of the dish they served merguez sausage which was very good.  I would return to try the rest of the menu.",1,,
19,Frank O.,"Shingle Springs, CA",121,336,504,5.0,6/7/2018,"Really amazing dinner kitchen with lots of in kitchen house made delights, that transports you to Colmar in an instant. So many savory choices but still a manageable menu. Dinner without drinks here will run you from $23 to 70, depending on your choices. Our party of 5 spent $60 per head inclusive, and we were pretty frugal. only $50 of that was drinks.Great beer selection, amazing but expensive wine choices, and a few more wines by the glass would be appreciated. Romantic, a bit noisy when full as the place was hopping on a Wednesday night. They have no lack of clientele, as this is the well off upper east side so it's a bit fancy, but not overstuffed.This is a great choice for romantic or intimate smaller party meals. Very memorable and rich food. And for French food the proteins are generous, and the portions are large. The prix fixe is your best choice but it will stuff you, for 2 more days.I enjoyed the steak tartare, the sausage plate, my son's steak was was well seasoned and truly rare and came with bone marrow as a side,  a French specialty, along with pomme frites.Overall an exceptional restaurant with great staff, a prime location, and a kitchen that will leave you remembering, why you want to eat  once again ...In France.",,,

I took their recommendation, and made the short commute here.This place is decorated nicely, and the staff was friendly. We were seated promptly, and checked out their many options. I knew what I wanted: steak and eggs!We ordered our food, and got some bread and coffee while we waited. The bread was out of this world. My mocha was ok, a bit too sweet in spite of asking for limited sweetness. But nothing that hampered my overall experience of this place.The steak and eggs were amazing! I was able to order my steak blue, which was a delight as not every place does this.

23,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1199,355,2208,4.0,6/25/2018,"Super adorable french cafe on Upper East Side.  We almost didn't come here, because they don't accept reservations for brunch.  We decided to give it a try on a Saturday morning round 11:30, and the three of us were seated without a problem after a short 10 minute wait -  a success in my book! We were seated at one of the booths, under the beautiful mercury mirrors, and loved the ambiance.  The place was kinda noisy, and if the weather was better - I would have preferred to sit outside.  My sister and I were treating my mom for a fun 'Mom's Day' day of adventures, and were feeling pretty indulgent.  All said and done, we had ordered three dishes, 3 cocktails, and 3 coffees, left the bill at $150 with a tip.  The quality of the food was good, but definitely comes with a price tag.  First off drinks:  my sister went with the classic mimosa.  I ordered the Bellini which was perfect, and my mom ordered the lychee Bellini which I tasted, and was phenomenal - sweet, and somehow slightly tart, very refreshing.  I indulged on an macchiato (espresso with small amount of steamed milk), which I LOVED.  They both opted for the cafe mocha which was served in a bowl big enough to swim in - personally, I found the cafe mocha too sweet, but they loved it.Food: We all split 3 dishes, the Shakshuka was the absolute winner, read the thoughts on the dishes below.//Shakshuka: Mediterranean casserole of eggs in tangy tomato sauce with peppers, onions, smoked paprika, cumin, cilantro, aged white cheddar, and fresh country bread.  This was the most delicious Shaksuka I've ever had - the flavors were exquisite, the eggs perfectly cooked, and the rough-chopped peppers and onions were super tender.   I would 100% order this again, when I visit.  The bread was stellar too - we used it to sop up every ounce of that tangy tomato sauce.//Berry Crêpes : fresh berries, crème fraiche, raspberry coulis - in a word, phenomenal.  Difficult to expand upon - simple, elegant, decadent - but not too overpoweringly sweet, a winner.// Artisanal Country Board: We opted to make this a vegetarian meal, and asked to sub more cheese out for the meat - we were told we could do this, for a $9 charge, no problem!  My only complaint was that the cheeses weren't labeled and we had to ask which were what.  Some were SUPER stinky and strong cheeses, fyi!  (Originally dish is: prosciutto, Parisian ham, duck ballotine, rosette de lyon, chèvre, gruyere, roquefort, herbed olives, walnuts, grilled country bread). Olives were delish!Super cute place to brunch, it's clean and fun - staff are friendly, but definitely busy!  We took our time, and nobody rushed us out.  Outside seating seems plentiful with great covered awnings.  A definite recommendation, if you're looking for a cute french cafe style brunch on the UES.",14,5,11
24,Luciana R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,107,4,5.0,9/9/2018,"I love this restaurant. Everything I have ever eaten here has been amazing. The Black Angus Steak Salad is just so perfect, that I have a hard time ordering anything else when I am here for brunch. If you come at dinner time, the Prix Fixe Dinner is a great idea, but good luck choosing since everything is fantastic, I am partial to the chopped salad, steak frites and the thin caramelized apple tart. The apple tart is ridiculously delicious, light and flaky, and I am not ashamed to say that I eat the entire thing, as ginormous it is. What I love about Cafe D'Alsace is you can come here and eat light, or you can come here and enjoy all the decadence your stomach can take. I don't really want everyone to know how amazing this place is, then the wait will be longer, but you owe it to yourself to check it out!",2,,2

First time was for brunch with friends when I first moved here and their croque madame was delicious! It came with the croque madame, salad and side of roasted potatoes. Portions are pretty big here so I always have something to take home. Second time I came was recently for NYC restaurant week. I thought I hadn't been here before so I wanted to try it. My roommate and I made reservations for Wednesday night. It wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. I had the duck terrine appetizer, lamb stew and chocolate gateau. The appetizer alone could have been my meal. I tried some of the lamb stew which was so tender and juicy. It was a huge portion so I took home half. Dessert- my fav course. Chocolate cake was almost like a lava cake center. Everything was delicious!",,,

I had the crepe w passion fruit sauce , but surprisingly it was a fluffy crepe- tasted more like a pancake rather. But it was all good- my order order the steak and he liked it a lot!

Updated review","They have a very nice Pre-Theatre Prix-Fixe that includes an appetizer and an entree (limited to salmon, moules, chicken, burger, and gnocchi) for only $26 which is a steal.   1. Herbed Goat Cheese Gnocchi: Finally tried the gnocchi and it was fantastic!  Fluffy, pillow-y gnocchi in a herb Mornay sauce with decadent goat cheese, the perfect hint of truffle, and topped with toasted pine nuts, shiitake, wood-ear, and button mushrooms.  The pine nuts added the perfect touch!2. The Farmhouse chicken was solid - tender and juicy half chicken with a crispy skin in a flavorful chicken jus with a side of slow roasted shallot and creamy mashed potatoes.3.  Frisee au lardons: Very nice execution with a perfectly poached egg and light, tangy vinaigrette.4.  Tarte Flambee: Tried and true classic - I never noticed the roasted onions before but they really do elevate the flavor.  If they made an entire pizza-sized version, I would probably polish that off.  5. Gaugeres: Okay so even the servers here know to bring me extra helpings.  SOOO fluffy, light, and soft.  I think I probably ate 3 by myself.The dinner servers are always fantastic (compared to brunch) and I don't recall the name of our server but he is amazing.  Attentive, helpful, and I owe him for recommending the gnocchi!  Love it here!  If you are on the UES - there is literally no better option for French cuisine.",1,1,2
29,Review C.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,31,4,1.0,11/17/2018,"Really disappointed to see that they have literally  cut the quantity in half of one of my favorite dishes there - Shashuka, while keeping the price same - whooping 17 dollars . I have been going there for the same dish past 3 years ( one every month or two for three years ). The service there varies from all the times I have been there, was never supper impressed so never bothered to leave a review till this happened . Way to get your customers back while promoting those ""veggi"" options on your menu. I won't be going back unless they have either reduced the price in half as well just as the quantity or brought the quantity back to what it was for so many years . I asked our waitress but she was relatively new and didn't know , which is fine. I just won't be going back I felt I way over paid for my meal .",,,
30,Jesse P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",271,7,1,5.0,9/8/2018,Had the octopus and the steak frites. Both were one of the best I've ever had. Portions were big so the 2 dishes were enough for 2 of us.

The mushroom and truffle special was amazing, packed with flavor and aromas. Farmhouse chicken was extremely moist and juicy, and the sauce was to die for. Creme Brulee might have been the best I have ever had in my life, and was also complimentary as a celebration for our engagement! Thank you!

33,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",454,130,313,3.0,1/24/2018,"I wanted to love this place; I've heard endless good things from several different people. My boyfriend and I decided to come by for Restaurant Week Winter 2018, but the food wasn't as up to par as everyone's rave reviews! Not bad but not phenomenal either.We got the Pheasant Sausage and the Grilled Octopus ($5 upcharge) for our appetizers. The pheasant sausage was good and paired well with the sauerkraut and apple; however there was an overwhelming amount of sauerkraut on the plate. The Grilled Octopus served over a large plate of salad. The tart vinaigrette paired well with the octopus and salad, though the octopus didn't have much of a grilled flavor.For our entrees, we got the Steak Frites ($8 upcharge) and the Herbed Goat Cheese Gnocchi. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare, but it was more like medium. The red wine reduction was flavorful. The fries were abundant, cooked to the perfect amount of crispness, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt. The bone marrow was buttery, but was gone in two small bites. The flavor of the goat cheese and herbs with the gnocchi was right on, but the gnocchi itself was much too mushy.The desserts came out in a more generous portion than expected. Unfortunately, we were not at all fans of the Ginger Creme Brûlée; the ginger taste was much too overpowering. The Crepe Soufflé was good; it reminded me of Asian spongecakes. There is a bit of cream inside and the lemony sauce and berry compote on the plate made for delicious flavors.A good place for date night with food that isn't disappointing, but not quite up to par with their prices.Side note: We tried to make a 7:30 pm dinner reservation, were told that there was nothing available, but that there was a 7:45 pm available. 15 minutes isn't a big deal so we took it. We ended up getting there early around 7:30 and there were multiple tables open! They still seated us though, so no big deal.",,,
34,Beverly R.,"Henderson, NV",69,3,3,5.0,8/6/2018,"This is probably one of my favorite places for brunch (though I think they only have the brunch menu available for weekends). Food is not overpriced and they serve good quantities. Great place if you are near Central Park. I'm a vegetarian so I had the Omelette Maison, which was an excellent option because I also love cheese. My partner had the Eggs Benedict with smoke salmon and was delicious. Both plates included a side. If you are a tea fan, try the mint tea, it's just out of this world.",,,
35,Tiffany J.,"Berkeley, CA",607,220,258,5.0,6/2/2018,"Had a fantastic brunch here today. The waiter was perfect, and sitting outside was nice, as the air is decent and the space is cute.  We ordered the shakshuka and the souffle crepe and loved both.Some reviews said the shakshuka was unflavorful--I disagree. The sauce had a great flavor, and the sausage--really amazing. All the best flavors of lamb without the fishy aroma it can sometimes have. Definitely worth the extra $6. At first we ate the shakshuka alone, but in the end I realized that it goes insanely well with the bread.Glad we got the souffle crepe over the brioche french toast-- it was very special and the cream was very good. We soaked up all the fruit syrup around, which packed the crepe with flavor. We also experimented with pairing the dessert with the mint it came with, and it went well together. However the mint slightly interfered with the soft and creamy blend of souffle and cream.Oh, yes, great butter, jam, and bread. I like to put a lot of both for a nice butter and jam sandwich.",1,,

38,Kelsey B.,"Brooklyn, NY",361,14,11,5.0,8/22/2018,Cafe D'Alsace exceeded my expectations for dinner. I have been for brunch in the past and loved their shakshuka so I was looking forward to their dinner menu. We started with the farmer's beet salad which was a perfect way to begin our meal. There was a nice variety of beets and the cheese was creamy. It was well portioned as a starting dish. For dinner we shared both the burger and goat cheese gnocchi which were delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly medium and came with a large helping of shoestring fries. The gnocchi was rich and well seasoned with complexity from the mushrooms.  Our server was attentive and refilled our water frequently. I will definitely be coming back in the near future.,1,,
39,Marie R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/3/2018,"If we could have given zero stars to this restaurant we would. I created an account to review this place because it was that bad. The short story: the restaurant has a terrible catty host and bad food!The longer story:The host was this rude and extremely catty guy who should not be the first person customers greet. When we got our table, my husband asked him if we could switch to an empty table nearby and he left my husband waiting only to say no (and not in an apologetic manner). He said that the table we wanted was reserved. Why couldn't those guests sit on our originally assigned table when they arrived? I did not find a way to select a specific table on their website. It is the first time in 9 years where we cannot change tables in a restaurant (and we have gone on so many dates). And by the way, we had a dinner reservation for two people and made it 15 minutes early.My husband wanted me to let it go, but then the food ended up being bad and quite expensive. He ordered the special, only to find it with the bill it was one of the most expensive items on the menu. Worse was the taste, so bad that he could not finish the mussels or the shrimp (and got a stomach ache that evening). I ordered the salmon and it was not good either. For appetizers, we both ordered the french onion soup and it was the worst I have ever had (and I have had a lot of french onion soups). Our waiter and the ambiance were good, but our recommendation to this restaurant's owner is to get better hosts and food. We are never going back, especially with all the options we have in NYC.",,,

If you're a heavy salmon lover, get this as your main entree!Also had the Crab Omelette- so fresh and delicious. I'd order this again! I love outdoor seating, but good luck trying to snag some during weekend brunch. There will be a wait for outdoor seating, but there's usually tables available inside.Haven't had a chance to make it to dinner here, but I look forward to it.As for service, meh. Been here twice and both times, the service was mediocre. First experience was when the waitress just seemed unhappy about her life. Second experience was not necessarily about the waiter itself, but because the staff seemed unorganized or understaffed. Let's see about the third time-I'll be sure to update soon.UPDATE: Service was great the third time lolMy partner still loves that Salmon Duo.

The fresh juices are also really yummy and super refreshing! If you find yourself in the neighborhood I would definelty recomend this place.,,,
45,Huhdar H.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,12,1,4.0,11/11/2018,"This place lived up to the many positive reviews that it gets, for the most part; I can definitely see why it is so popular and crowded for brunch! The food is pretty good and the service is efficient and friendly. The breads that are brought to the table first are very tasty and come with delicious apricot jam and butter. I had a very popular menu item, the shakshuka, and was pleased with it overall, except for something that was said in another review which seemed to be very accurate, that there seems to be way more tomatoes,peppers and onions added but very little egg, and shakshuka is primarily supposed to be an egg dish. But what was more disappointing was that I asked for extra cheese and emphasized it since I love cheese and was more than willing to pay extra for this, however despite the fact that I was charged an extra $3 for it, there was only an extremely minimal amount added to the dish at all- it was not cheesy AT ALL and seemed to have below the standard amount of  cheese that would have been on a normal order of how it comes. Very very disappointed by that. Also, I've tasted authentic middle eastern shakshuka before and compared to that it was not too special. I still enjoyed it though. And the drink selection is great, they even offer a virgin Bloody Mary which I asked for extra spicy and it was. The Vietnamese coffee was okay, it was my first time having it so I didn't realize that it would be iced. The creme brûlée' was yummy, it tasted like vanilla pudding. My friend had the eggs Benedict and her daughter had the Brioche French toast which she said were amazing, as well as the Mimosa, Cafe Mocha and Profiteroles for desert which they liked as well. Would definitely recommend that you come here and strongly advise getting there early since it is very popular for brunch and they don't take reservations. I only hope that they improve the quality of the shakshuka and pay better attention to specific requests. But nice overall.",,,

The variety of nice cheeses and grapes coupled with the awesome bread and jam served complimentary to each table is a great way to start any brunch. The omelettes and breakfast sandwiches were great and the atmosphere is deceivingly classy. My favorite brunch spot in NYC so far for sure.

It wasn't too formal but wasn't really casual. It was right in the middle ( maybe towards a little more casual). The waiter was really friendly and smiled which gave off a good feeling. The bread was AMAZING (maybe my favorite part of the dinner). I had the steak tartare, and it was good. It was my first time but I loved it, from the plating to the flavor. For my entree I got the lamb which was really bad (the lamb flavor was really strong but if you regularly enjoy lamb you might like it). The duck and cod was really good (recommend). For dessert I had the fig creme brulee which was really tasty. It was a little on the too sweet side but was good nonetheless. The chocolate lava cake was really good too (can't go wrong there really).",,,

57,Tracy W.,"New York, NY",370,54,40,4.0,5/16/2017,"This restaurant is a gem for weekend brunch on the Upper East Side, which is an area lacking in brunch options compared to downtown Manhattan. It can get pretty busy during the brunch timeframe 11-2, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes without a reservation. I typically order the maryland jumbo lump crab omelette if I'm looking for something savory and the brioche french toast if I'm feeling something sweet. Both are cooked to perfection and taste amazing. The savory dishes also come with a side of greens and potatoes. Idk what dressing they put on the greens, but it always tastes fresh and zingy. Prices are pretty standard, ranging from $10-25 per brunch dish. Overall, this place is definitely worth a try if you live on the UES and are looking for a neighborhood spot.

Mediterranean casserole of eggs in a tangy tomato sauce with peppers, onions, smoked paprika, cumin, cilantro, aged white cheddar, grilled country bread)I haven't been able to find that many places with shakshuka so my rating for this is pretty high. The flavors were great, especially combining the sausage in with the tomato base. So warm and comfy especially in the wintry mornings. We came around 10 AM on a Sunday to a 80% full dining area. Didn't call ahead or anything and was seated immediately. Great service! I'd totally consider this a go-to place for a French brunch.

It came with a fantastic white wine sauce and left me wanting for more.The pricing was reasonable in light of the location, and just slightly higher than I feel comfortable spending on a dinner if it weren't a special occasion.Overall, 4/5 because the food was delicious but not quite top tier yet... with that said, I wouldn't be surprised if this place could whip up some kind of meal that would warrant a five star rating and the salmon simply wasn't it.",,,

Next time I will book a table, as it seemed all of us walk-ins were shown the bar, ( not that there's anything wrong or unpleasant about the bar; just the opposite. I just prefer dining at a table).The excellent beer list is extensive and that part of Europe is well represented, in addition to American beers of the same caliber.The wines by the glass (and the list as a whole) are well chosen, and I ordered a Pinot Blanc, and later a Gewurztraminer. The bartender was attentive in keeping me sated.There is a Farmer's Market Beet Salad with Montrachet, ($14), which is just that. The beets are cut up so it looks like a cylindrical tuna tartare. Perfectly delicious. As a main I had Grilled Scottish Salmon with French lentils, fresh lemon vinaigrette, ($28).  I couldn't help but stop and exclaim how good this dish was. Salmon is salmon and usually nothing to get excited about, but this preparation with the lentils and nicely done vegetables was really good.The couple next to me at the bar said that the Tarte Flambee is the way to go, and they also complemented the Wild Salmon Tartare. So after this first visit, I'm pleased that Cafe d'Alsace seemingly employs people who care and put out a quality product. There are also Moules-Frites, Choucroute, and Baeckeoffe on the menu. I'm looking forward...",,,

The menu had many unique and delicious options sure to please everyone in your party. I had the croque madame and it was very good. It definitely could have had a second egg on top because the sandwich was very long so you couldn't get egg with every bite. I also had a macchiato and could have done without it was very strong and bitter like the espresso was old. That is my only minor flaw with the experience. Everything else was wonderful If I could go back I would absolutely get the eggs Benedict or the crab omelette both were divine and I think their specialties.  Service was great and even though it was packed our waiter was very attentive and fast.,1,,1

Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was pleasant and and they were bustling this particular evening. The restaurant week prices always significantly risen for NYC, with the dinners soaring to $42 for three courses. I've been here before with my girlfriend and we had a wonderful time. I remember their Gougères so vividly and this evening, we were served a nice plate of the light dinner clouds with the slightest essence of cheese. My only wish would be that they be served warmed. That would be perfect. After polishing off the three they gifted us, I asked for another helping because, I just love them sooooo much.Hubbs had the Steak Tartare and I had the Goose and Foie Gras Sausage w/Cabbage and Apple. Both were very good. Our second courses were Duck Confit Mushroom Risotto for moi and Steak Frites w/Bone Marrow for hubbs. I scored his bone marrow because he just doesn't appreciate the connective tissue flavour treasure. Our entrées were so good. We were basking in the wonderment of our meal. Our dining neighbors were all enjoying the restaurant week dishes. We hardly had any room for dessert but ordered Hubby's Lavender Vanilla Crème Brûlée and my Hazelnut Molten Chocolate Gâteau.

After dinner, the waitress came out with a dessert (+candle) for our anniversary on the house from them!! and they wished us a happy anniversary many times as well.The food was fantastic! The last time I was here I had the chicken entree, this time I went for the 2 sausages (with mashed potato, sauerkraut and spaetzle). VERY DELICIOUS!I'll be back soon for sure.",,,1

The dish came at a pretty steep price ($20), but it was quite a large portion.

Typically French restaurants are more on the expensive side but this is pretty reasonably priced without sacrificing any of the quality. For lunch they have a good pre-fixe menu giving you an appetizer and entree for a lower price as well as a 3 - course pre theater fixe between 5pm and 6 pm, a great deal. I love sitting at the bar it's really nicely lit up. They always give you delicious fresh bread to start off your meal. I always order the chopped salad, it looks small but it's very dense and filling loaded with flavor as well as the Grilled Bass ""Antiboise"". The Tahitian vanilla crime brûlée is always nice to top off a meal. Sitting on the patio for brunch is also a great experience if you can get a spot. There aren't any brunch specials like many other UES spots around but the cappuccinos are fantastic and they don't want that crowd there anyway. The presentation of their selection of ripe fruits/berries with yogurt, granola and wildflower honey is very impressive as well as refreshing. The staff is friendly and has a pleasant atmosphere.",,,

We came at 11am on a week day and both of us ordered the Salmon Benedict. It was literally perfect. We also split a batch of French Toast which is definitely not the normal order for me BUT again, Cafe D'Alsace wins. it was thick and fluffy and melted in my mouth. The fries that came with the eggs were also thin and crispy enough but not too much which seems to be a difficult balance for many dining establishments. I will absolutely be back as the service was just as good as the food!",2,1,1
80,Desiree S.,"Claremont, CA",55,260,71,3.0,7/15/2017,"Such a cute spot (with beautiful outdoor seating), but unfortunately the French food is just decent. I wanted to love this place, but the Croque Madame was disappointing. There was so little actually in the sandwich that it just looked like two pieces of bread on top of each other with an egg on top. The mixed greens were good, though, and the fries were really yummy. One upside is that even though this is a French place, they definitely give American-style large portions. The service was just OK despite the fact that there were maybe only three other groups of people at the restaurant.If you're looking for a bougie place to eat some European food, I don't think that Cafe D'Alsace is your best option.",1,,

83,Thomas F.,"Manhattan, NY",84,61,0,2.0,6/17/2018,"Living in the area, seeing the lines outside Cafe D'Alsace, I just had to give it another try. I visited the place when it first opened, thought the food was average and overpriced but stopped going mainly because they didn't serve regular beers; no Coors, Budweiser etc. FYI: They still don't serve regular beers. But a friend and I went for brunch. The $19 burger, which I ordered medium, came well-done and dry on too-big a bun. Fries were soggy. My friend ordered their Black Angus Steak Salad at $24; good luck finding the steak. The dish was basically a pile of dry greens; we had to ask for dressing. I've no idea why people line the sidewalks waiting to get into this restaurant. You can get a much, much better burger, for $10.95, across the street. But these days it seems to me that restaurants in NYC don't have to serve great food. Mediocrity is the ""in"" thing.",1,,
84,Betty C.,"New York, NY",0,6,2,5.0,7/26/2018,Very nice ambiance indoors and outdoors. Waiter staff is very friendly. Now for the food.I went during restaurant week. The Bass is absolutely amazing. The salmon tartare and duck terrine is a must. I suggest not to get the lamb choucroute unless you are obsessed with sauerkraut. There was way too much. The lamb was cooked perfectly but not enough lamb to finish the sauerkraut. DrinksMimosa is nothing like your endless brunch offers. Comes with a punch. Ginger royale is great if you like sparkling wine.,,,

Luckily my friend arrives and then ""oh lucky us"" we were seated.Not that we we looking for special attention...to be honest we just wanted the basic service. That was far long gone. The service was abysmal. From getting the burger order wrong to not listening the service was awful. We had to send the burger back because it was rare instead of medium. Then we asked for ketchup and mustard and not only received one of the two. Again we had to call the waiter over to correct the order. Then ""poof"" the waiter was gone. Seriously it was 25 minutes when he resurfaced and when he did he was annoyed that we wanted the check.All in all...for a place that is quaint and cute the service does it in. Bad bad bad.

Outdoor seating is available with heated lamps to keep you warm; luckily we were able to secure a table inside after a short wait.Once seated we got a free basket of bread with jelly/butter. Warm and a delicious starter. For the main course, settled on the Grilled Boudin Blanc & Smoked Pork Sausages ($18). The pork sausage is cooked well with rich flavor; the Boudin Blanc is a chewy wurst which needed a bunch of hot sauce. The sausages are served on a bed of regular sauerkraut and potatoes. To drink I had a tequila-based cocktail that was probably 50% tequila - quite a punch (couldn't finish).Despite the crowd, the service is spot on and friendly.

Finally returned to check out their Pre-Theater Menu (5-6pm) thinking it would be less crowded and the menu offered was pretty sweet: $20 for an appetizer and entree (+$5 for a dessert). Definitely get rezzies here, even if you think you don't need them! The crowd: lots of families on a weekend- typical UES scene :) What we ordered:Octopus salad (daily special) + grilled Scottish salmon: I was in a seafood mood. octopus was grilled well and complimented the salad. Salmon was seasoned well- perhaps a bit too salty for my taste but good nonetheless.Asparagus soup (Sdj) + burger d'alsace that comes with fries: friend loved her soup and then burger looked fantastic- fries were the crispy shoestring kind which was our fav! I would've totally gotten this if I wasn't on a health streak. Charcuterie board + farmhouse chicken: legit board! Chicken was devoured!They also brought out a plate of FANTASTIC CHEESY BREAD PUFFS for the table and omg was it heavenly. We also requested a basket of bread-bread and they were happy to accommodate. My friend even asked for seconds on their bread, which they were so generous to provide gracefully. Service is spectacular- our server was sweet and attentive! To note: Hostess will ask if you have a rezzie and will not seat you until your entire party has arrived. Weather is looking warmer these days and they opened the outdoor seating for folks already! I think it depends on whether or not their full inside and if the weather is accommodating.",2,,
104,Todd B.,"St. Petersburg, FL",180,505,1010,4.0,6/29/2016,"New York exists to eat.  Forget the financial district, forget the museums, forget everything.  Everything you do in NY centers around filling up time between meals, and the only reason there is time between meals is because if your stomach ruptures and you die, you won't be able to keep eating.This was far from the best meal I have ever had in NY, but it was a really good brunch.  The restaurant was a couple of blocks from our airbnb on our last day, so we decided to hit it up for brunch before heading to the airport.  My girlfriend pointed out the Shakshuka, which was something she got in Boston at one of the awesome restaurants we went to there, and it was one of the best breakfast/brunch items I had tasted, so I made sure to get it here.For those of you unfamiliar, it is a Mediterranean dish, described as a casserole of eggs in a tangy tomato sauce with peppers, onions, paprika, cumin, cilantro, cheddar with grilled country bread (though I think the bread thing isn't part of the recipe - just a basket of bread).  I got it with the 2 merguez sausages.  Now, from this description we can determine 2 things:  one - I can read a menu and transcribe it to yelp perfectly, and 2-this isn't your average breakfast.  I got the sausage because I wanted protein and like breakfast meat and because its sausage, but really, the dish doesn't need the sausage.  It is fan-freaking-tastic and doesn't need anything; no salt or pepper - maybe just some water after you try to eat it right away and burn a hole in the roof of your mouth (the dish comes out in a piping hot iron skillet).    I am going 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons.  Firstly, at $19, it is expensive for breakfast.  However, this is NY and you have to expect to pay more, so that probably isn't fair.  More importantly, I have had this dish twice.  I tasted it once in Boston and then had it here, and frankly, they did it better in Boston.  That's not to say this wasn't good - this was excellent - but the one in Boston was noticeably better and while there might be room for more than one 5-star Shakshuka, until more places start serving it, I can't give both 5-stars when one was better than another.  Again, maybe not fair - it was 2 different restaurants in 2 cities, so they aren't exactly competing, but...nothing, I have no way of ending that sentence.I didn't see much of the inside of the restaurant as we sat on the patio, but it looked very nice.  The outside wall opens up all the way so it merges seamlessly with the patio, giving it a nice open-air feel.  We were in the sun - the entire patio is not shaded - but thankfully it wasn't too hot.  I was still sweaty, but I always am, and that is too much information.  Sorry.Coffee was very good.  Service was excellent.  That grilled country bread?  Superb.  And, it was warm enough that our plate of butter melted completely, so we could dip it in butter.  Score!Don't know how they do other meals, but brunch is a winner here.",5,4,3
105,Mylisa N.,"Staten Island, NY",11,3,0,5.0,2/4/2018,"Wonderful restaurant week experiences here! I've been here two times a year apart and at the second opportunity, I was pining to come back. In my recent visit, I had the Tartee Flambee D'Hiver which was sort of like a flatbread pizza. With beets, goat cheese, and lardon (bacon?), it was savory and delicious. Not too heavy, but a cozy winter starter. Then for my entree I had the Classic Cassoulet. I was in heaven. The duck leg stole the show -- fall off the bone, a nice balance of crispy skin and fat. Then for dessert... I was also in heaven. I remember the year prior I had the creme brulee, which was great, but this time I had the cheese plate, which was AH-mahzing!! The cheeses were all fairly soft, but ones that I could identify were similar to brie and bleu cheese. It's a must-have, especially if you are having a glass of wine. Overall the atmosphere was cozy and had a lovely retro vibe. The beer and wine selection is vast and our interaction with our waiter was pleasant and funny. Truly great.",,,

108,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,271,1038,4.0,6/28/2016,"Came for brunch on Saturday and I was really glad I did! I've been scoping this place out for a while given that my boyfriend's apartment is a 5 minute walk away but we've never gotten around to actually dining there. It's always packed, though, so we had really high hopes. We arrived and we were quoted at 15 minutes, and it ended up being closer to 10 (props to the hostesses!). We sat at the bar for a drink before our table cleared up. Can't remember the names of the drinks, but it was basically a strawberry bellini and a pear bellini. Both were okay, but I preferred the pear. We spent a while perusing the menu and ultimately decided on the eggs benedict with salmon and the omelette Lorraine (which I had seen mentioned on several Yelp reviews- thanks for the rec, guys!). Both came with some roasted potatoes and mixed greens. {Food} : despite being super plain, the mixed greens were high-key amazing. Really fresh with tasty flavors...even my veggie-averse, picky-eater boyfriend agreed they were good. The potatoes were awesome too, and were a lot better than the ultra-greasy home fries most places serve with brunch. I thought my boyfriend's eggs benedict was sooooo good. The hollandaise was perfect, and the salmon was fresh and smoky, just how we like it. The omelette was just slightly disappointing, but still good. It had gruyere, bacon, and grilled onions in it. I thought the eggy part was a little dry, and the contents of the omelette were inside the fold rather than mixed into the eggs (I prefer them actually mixed in when the eggs are being cooked). And the bacon was really fatty. BUT the flavors were good, and the bacon bits that weren't little strips of fat were so tasty. {Service}: It was fine. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints, either. Our server was a little aloof and didn't really make small talk or anything with us, but I'm sure he was pretty busy so it's fine, whatever. Would probably return, but would order the eggs benedict instead of the omelette lorraine, and would skip the drinks. Most brunch entrees are under $20, which is pretty competitive for the quality of the food. Glad I tried it, for sure.",1,1,2

My friends and I chatted a bit, but the waitress was patient, and didn't seem bothered by a group of indecisive millennials.  She was actually quite engaging, and personable - refreshing traits in this day and age.  I absolutely loved that the menu had a mixed pastry basket option -  it definitely helped to open up the conversation at the table. The food was pretty darn good and well-sized.  My lump-crab omelette was, to my surprise, full of crab meat!  I initially thought they'd try to stiff me on the crab, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. So, if you find yourself in the UES, I insist you grab a friend or two, stop by here, order the pastry basket, and dive into a thoughtful conversation.My only gripe is that they don't seat you until your entire party arrives..which is somewhat annoying...bleh!",,,
110,Liz T.,"New York, NY",507,165,124,3.0,3/19/2017,"Came here for restaurant week. For $42 you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I got the beef tartare, lamb choucroute, and chocolate lava cake. I also got to try the lobster ravioli, steak frites, and lavender creme brulee. The beef tartare was fresh. Nothing really notable about it though. It didn't have a lot of flavor. Lobster ravioli was average. It was cooked well but again, had no flavor. The lamb choucroute came with four tiny pieces of lamb, a sausage that was too salty, and a crazy amount of sauerkraut. While the lamb was pretty tender, that was the most unworthwhile thing I have had in a long time. I basically paid for a pot of sauerkraut. I usually clean my plate when I go out or at least box it up, but I just had them throw this away. The bone marrow was fatty and delicious but the positives end there. The steak with bone marrow was unevenly cooked. Some parts were well done, some were medium rare. The fries that came with it tasted like something we could get at McDonalds for far less.The chocolate soufflé was really good. I'm a sucker for anything with melted chocolate in it and this really hit the spot. It was sweet, rich and tasted amazing with the vanilla ice cream. I also got to try the lavender creme brulee. It was honestly pretty gross. There was way too much lavender flavoring in it and it was very runny.The seats are pretty close together and its hard to squeeze inside the booth. Service is okay, flagging down the server can be a little difficult. I wouldn't actively choose to come back here. It was far too expensive for a mediocre meal.",1,,1

The herbed goat cheese gnocchi was wonderful, soft and pillowy, but needed more texture - more pine nuts would have helped.  The desserts were lovely, especially the crepe soufflé with passion fruit sauce.

It was huge and he ate the whole thing.  Oh yeah, the coffee was good too.",1,,1

It's the only place in the neighborhood that I go to for a fancy brunch that doesn't break the bank.I always order my usual egg shakshuka; a good portion with 3 eggs in delicious tomato and red pepper sauce simmered in a cast iron pan. The waffle is one of the best in UES; crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside; always get them with the compote on the side to savor the crispness. Wash it all down with a Vietnamese coffee or two. It is strong and bold, so I get it with some milk on the side.The staffs are always friendly and accommodating, the decor transports you to a cozy French bistro within the bustling 2nd ave, and the food is always delicious!",1,,

I saw a few yelpers saying that Cafe D'Alsace is a hearty neighborhood french restaurant, and it really gave me the welcoming feeling when I first stepped in! The table of two next to us were two girls in their jogging/ yoga shirts, chilling, and just having some brunch and mimosa. Another table next to us were a cute elderly couple having their morning coffee. The customers and the friendly servers truly make this a lovely neighborhood cafe!The complimented Almond Gougeres bread was really yummy! It was soft, warm and fluffy! I asked for one more of the Gougeres because it went so well with the jelly and butter :D I ended up getting the grilled chicken club sandwich and my friend got the omelette lorraine. The portion of grilled chicken club sandwich was pretty big. The chicken was tender and I liked that there was a lot of cheese covering it!! The toast was a little bit burnt on the edge, and I hope it could be crispier. The side salad was refreshing, and the fries were thin and crispy which I love!! I really liked the onions inside the omelet which was caramelized perfectly. The roasted potatoes were spot on. Very flavorful. I will come back for its brunch and also come try their dinner some time!",1,,

Everything was delicious - from the bread and croissants with butter and jam they serve at the beginning of the meal, to the omelette with goat cheese, to the berry French toast.

127,Mark L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,4.0,5/17/2018,"I dine occasionally at Cafe d'Alsace but last night was exceptional. I miscounted the members of our party and reserved for seven. We were seated at a comfortable oval table, still awaiting two arrivals, when I realized my mistake. We were accommodated by merging several smaller tables so we had enough room. Then one member cancelled so we were down to eight. We requested and were moved back to the original table. All this was handled with grace and patience by the staff who were accommodating in all ways, even as out requests changed.The food is always good as is the service. I'm currently stuck on the mussels and fries but I might move on soon. Only four stars for one reason: The expansive, seemingly excellent, wine list is very short at the budget end. Wines start around $50 per bottle and go up quickly from there. It'd love to pop in for a bite on a whim but the total adds up quickly due to the cost of wine.Even with that one caveat, this is a fun, lively, attractive cafe with reliable good food.",,,

131,Molly H.,"New York, NY",231,37,1,2.0,8/4/2017,"My first few visits here were great - I didn't have a thing on the menu that wasn't great. But I just went for dinner and left so disappointed. We happened to be there during restaurant week, so their usual prix fixe was gone and the more expensive restaurant week menu was available instead. I'm pretty sure the menus were almost identical. The food was pretty good, although the steak was pretty chewy. The desserts were nothing great either - I wish the cake had been warm since it was served with ice cream. We also had to wait an unreasonable amount of time to get our second course. We were seated at 7:20, ordered immediately, and 50 minutes later were still waiting for our main courses. For desserts that took no prep (cake that wasn't warm and a bowl of ice cream), we had to wait quite a while for our dessert course. We asked our waitress if there was an issue, and shortly after our desserts the manager sent out a cookie plate. I appreciate the effort, but we already had dessert (and two courses)! It was pretty useless and way too much food. They could have comped our drinks instead or offered us a free round. The cookie plate was put on our bill as a $4 comped plate which was almost offensive on our $120 bill. I ended up leaving disappointed, especially because we spent a long time trying to decide which restaurant to go to and chose Cafe D'alsace because we knew we could rely on it. I guess the moral of this story is probably don't go during restaurant week. I also won't be defaulting to it as much in the future.",1,,

Not too crowded, not too noisy, just right amount. I will come back for sure.",,,
133,Nicky W.,"Austin, TX",108,80,492,5.0,2/7/2016,"Came here at 10:30am for Sunday brunch with my friend. We were seated fairly quickly. The bread basket was delicious! I loved that they brought out peach jam on top of the butter. And they had 3 different types of bread! So many options! I ordered the Vietnamese coffee and the smoked salmon Benedict. The coffee was pretty pricy (5$)...usually at Vietnamese restaurants it's 3$. It was a tiny glass and wasn't as strong. The Benedict, on the other hand, was delicious!! It was perfect. I especially appreciated their side of salad in addition to the potatoes. It made the meal feel less heavy! Most restaurants only give potatoes. I'd definitely come back here! The food was great and the service was stellar! While I lotted out 2 hours for breakfast (just in case), we were only there for 30 minutes!! If you're busy and worried about wasting time at a sit down restaurant, don't! This place is perfect for you.",1,,2

But of course the nice outfoor seating and friendly waiter contributed too. I ordered the crab omelet and even tho the dish was served with a pretty not-so-attractive appearance, the content was mind-blowing. The omelet roll was stuffed with half crab meat and half avocado in big chunks, and everything was put together by tangy cheese. The portion was larger than expected as well so I almost couldn't finish. The only thing I didn't like was that their latte was served boiling hot and after a while it still burnt my tongue :(",,,
142,Carol L.,"New York, NY",729,392,1367,5.0,7/6/2017,"A really good brunch, with shakshuka I still talk about to this day. Friend and I met another visiting friend for a very UES Sunday brunch catch-up session. It's a pretty place with old school décor and diner-esque seating complete with red leather plush seats. It's French themed as well, so there were hints of ""French Café"" all around ranging from the lighting fixtures, the menu options, and also the art on the wall. We were able to get seated immediately, which was surprising since the place was packed. We were able to make our choices quickly - one friend got a latte and a Western omelet with hash browns and salad, another got the French toast, and I got the shakshuka with Viennese sausages. The food took a while to come out, but when it did it definitely did not disappoint. Portions were large, and vibrant when contrasted with the table and surroundings. They were happy with their food, though no one was singing praises to the heavens because of it. My shakshuka was really super freakin' good, though - they made me believe in Viennese sausages again! It was served with this char-grilled, buttered thin-cut country bread that as my friend aptly put, ""tastes like blue skies and cow pastures"" in every bite. Service was fast, not too business-like as is common in larger brunch places, and generally a solid brunch option on the UES. Didn't try their alcohol selections, it's a must-do for when I go next!",,,

I came on a late Saturday afternoon, after being thoroughly defeated by the NYC rental market. Since I was already up on the UES and ravenous, I decided to turn the day around with a quick lunch, party of one, at this little café I quickly yelped. (Thanks for the recommendations everyone!) Perched up at the bar with a few other solo diners, I quickly started a conversation with the bartender who was friendly and offered suggestions on the menu. His face lit up when describing the burger so I was instantly sold. I'd say the Burger D'Alsace is making its way into my top 5 burger list. Why the hesitation though? Well points off because my burger was a tad overcooked to my requested medium rare. Despite being overcooked, the burger was still juicy, combining flavors of a really good French onion soup and a quality burger. That hit the mark for me and since I did ultimately find an abode on the UES, I'll be back for more.",7,4,5

147,V G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,6/22/2018,"My sister, myself and my 2 year old niece came to Cafe D'Alsace for lunch on Wednesday and had an absolutely horrific experience. Upon arrival, the hostess was on the phone and would not even look up at us. We stood waiting for about 5 minutes and then just sat down on the bench nearby. The hostess nor anyone did not come to help or seat us for over TEN MINUTES. The restaurant was not busy at all. We decided we would seat ourselves and upon doing so, the hostess finally decided to come over and tell us that the table we selected was reserved and moved us. After finally being seated, we ordered our lunch, a burger and asked for a second recommendation and went with a flat bread. Our food arrived and the burger was decent.  The flatbread was burnt and entirely dry and inedible. I wanted to order a soda and explain how bad the flat bread was but the act of flagging down our waiter seemed near impossible. When I finally got his attention and asked for a soda, he ran off before we got to mention the awful flatbread. My soda took almost 20 minutes to come, at which point, I decided he had forgotten about it. But actually, the waiter brought it over when we were done with our lunch. When my sister told the waiter about how awful the flatbread tasted, the waiter actually laughed in her face and walked away. We received our bill, with the flatbread still on it and the soda that came at the end of our awful meal. When we told the manager, he said they were very busy (which they were not at all) and offered for us to stay and order something else after a very long and painfully dragged out meal. He was not overly apologetic, he did not offer any kind of refund, he did not offer for us to come back again for a better experience. This was hands down, one of the most appalling and ridiculous dining experiences I have had in a long time. I have no intention of ever going back. If I could give them zero stars, I would.",,,

So of course, like a fly to light, I had to go...and I was not disappointed. I went there for dinner and had the fixed price dinner. I then pigged out and had the tarte flambee and french onion soup. Don't judge me. I live to eat. Can we first start with the little gruyere balls they bring out. Heavenly little things and FREE! I had about two and could have eaten more. The tarte flambee was ok but a little greasy. There is a place in the 30s called Tarte flambee that actually makes it quite a bit better. The french onion soup was good. Very gooey with the fromage but a little on the sweet side. I'm not sure if they just used a specific sweeter onion or if they added sugar. But overall quite enjoyable. The meal then moved onto a beet and goat cheese salad and steak tartar. The beet and goat cheese salad stole the show. I usually try to avoid beets because I don't enjoy what happens the next day...if you don't know what I'm talking about, ask your mom. Its quite a frightful experience everytime. But I threw caution to the wind and gobbled it up. The sweetness of the beet and the tangy of the goat cheese were perfect. The steak tartar had pickles in them...or as the french call it cornichons. It was ok but I wouldn't get it again. I had the steak frites. The steak was a HUGE portion and perfectly cooked. I wasnt a fan of the sauce but thats ok considering how perfect the steak was. One of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. The frites...oh gosh. Best ones I've had in this city yet. So much better than that Pomme Frites place in the village. Everything was so good that when the hubs tried to steal a bite, I actually let out a growl because my basic caveman instincts emerged. I also had the profiterole and chocolate cake for dessert. Both great. Needless to say, I was extremely full. The price was unbeatable. It was only $39 for each person on the fixed price menu. The service was also nice and friendly. In the beginning, our waitress screwed up a little but definitely made up for it over the course of the meal. She gave us free country bread...twice... She must have known I am easy to bribe. She also told us about how the chef is from the Alsace region in france and very specific about the recipes...which made me imagine a french accented version of Gordon Ramsay calling someone a donkey.",2,2,1

To be honest I actually did not look at the menu before I came in, but my friend picked this place. I was really amused by the quality of food they serve for restaurant week menu!! as you probably already know..usually they don't put their best food/expensive ingredients in this rest week menu but this place surprised me. They did have a great selections of food on the rw menu with huge portions. Def worth the money. It was a fix price of $38 (one appetizer, one entree, one dessert)Drinks. We each got a drink off the flutes menu (bubbles cocktail to be specific) - $11I had the strawberry liquer + bubbles mix - taste a bit like cough syrup to me. but my friend loved itShe got the peach puree with bubbles - i liked this! Both are not very strongWe both started with the soft shell crab as app. Came with a bit of salad. It was pretty flavorful but a bit on the sour side EntreeWas feeling steak, so i got the steak frites. The steak was quite juicy and fries were good!! not soggy at all. came with a side of bone marrow tooo which is my fave!! def hgh quality right there for this price. Very filling I could not finishMy friend got the seafood choucroute. - This one was HUMONGOUS. Comes with a lot of cabbage on the bottom tho. I really liked it! Obviously we couldn't finish.Dessert I had the chocolate cake + pistacchio ice cream - the pistacchio ice cream is SUPER pistacchio-ish..which is great! Seems like they made this themselves if I am correct. I like it a lotMy friend had the peach tart with some sour flavor fruity sorbet (I cant remember what it was sorry) - It was great too!Overall food wise I give it a 4.7 stars.My only complaint is that the servers (person who take our food away) kept coming back every few minutes.

We had just placed an order and 5 minutes later, the food was out -- hot. I got the Smoked Salmon Benedict. While it tasted good, it was ordinary. Maybe I'll go for something more special next time...The complimentary bread was hella delicious though! Especially the nutty one. Warm, flakey, buttery, soft... Yummy!!",1,,
161,Lauren K.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",11,101,172,5.0,9/13/2016,Absolutely amazing! Had the free range chicken (seriously have never had a more moist and bursting flavor like this chicken) the potatoes were perfect and the jus was MAGICAL. Also the chocolate tart was just as magical.... Can't believe I just discovered this cafe... This place is absolutely AMAZING and the service is just as wonderful. Will be coming back over and over!!!!,,,
162,Mary S.,"Queens, NY",193,110,195,4.0,9/10/2016,"Lovely little restaurant! It was pretty crowded and I went with a group of 6 with no reservation, but we were seated very quickly! It can get pretty loud and crowded inside, but the service was still very quick. We were given bread as a starter, and it was good bread, but it could have been great if it was freshly toasted/warm. I ordered the brioche French toast and it was heavenly. It comes with strawberries and black berries, and the toast is thick and fluffy. I couldn't finish it! Definitely recommend it for brunch.",,,

165,Michelle F.,"Union City, NJ",3,52,19,5.0,1/28/2017,"We went here last night during restaurant week and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere is warm and inviting; with a wonderfully friendly wait staff. We started with the steak tartar and the tarte flambé - both were amazing. The steak tartar itself was an impressive portion size. I had the duck confit with wild mushrooms and parmesan crusted risotto.  While I loved the appetizers, I almost wish I did not enjoy the apps so much, just to make space to finish this meal. It was completely perfect. Every bite had the perfect combination of enhanced and balanced flavors. So much so, that I'm thinking about it the next day wishing I had left overs! My boyfriend had the steak frites, medium rare and it was also cooked perfectly. The fries were thin, lightly salted and crisp. We ended our meal with the extremely tasty créeme brûlée and passion fruit sorbet. The sorbet tasted exactly like biting into a passion fruit, and the créeme brûlée was creamy and light. All and all, the meal was absolutely perfection. We will definitely be back!",3,,1
166,Ed S.,"Dallas, TX",143,206,138,4.0,5/14/2016,"I really enjoy this place. It has the brass, and warm feel of a traditional French bistro. This is comfort food to me. Sausages, cassoulet, all that good stuff hits all my favorite things.Love the sausages, the boudin is terrific, the others are good too.I like the leeks appetizer, something so simple but so pleasing.Cooked leeks with a vinegarette. They can be a bit stringy through so ask for a steak knife.",1,,1
167,Kimthanh N.,"Long Beach, CA",272,12,2,1.0,8/10/2017,"Good food. Great ambience. But for all that, I will never return until they improve their server training.1) The server gave us the check, then ignored us for half an hour. We wanted to split the check and leave but was not able to. 2) After about 30 mins our party really needed to leave. So we waved the server over. They ignored us. Then a red haired server named Lorene came over and told us that it's rude to wave to servers. Yes, it's rude to do so, but ruder to be ignored and not able to pay.Horrible service. Made me late to my appointment. I live in the area but never coming back.",2,,
168,Kurt B.,"New York, NY",0,16,3,5.0,12/16/2017,"Been coming here for years, and it's always a great experience! My favorite dish is the steak frites - it comes with bone marrow which is amazing! I recently dined here and was pleasantly surprised to see a new (for me) plate de jour of rack of lamb. Which was EXCELLENT! I paired it with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon which was also great. Wines by the glass at a lot of restaurants can be disappointing, but not here! The service is also on point, with the waitstaff and bartenders being very nice and attentive, and happy to answer any questions with the menu. The decor and atmosphere is really cute too! I look forward to coming back here in the future!",,,
169,Yuan T.,"New York, NY",4,13,77,5.0,5/7/2016,"Five star for this restaurant. Not only for the food but for the experience and service. We came for Saturday brunch today, unfortunately as we were pulling over ahead of a parked car in front of the restaurant, that car was leaving so we bumped into each other and had to wait for a long time for the police to come. I went into the restaurant to eat first while my husband was waiting, had the waffle with berries, it was really tasty. The police took a long time to come, after i was done eating, the manager Gabriel came out to give my husband and the other car some pastries for free since we had been waiting for like 1.5 hours already. When the police was done his work, the other car left, and our car battery died. The restaurant's neighbor, The owner of Fine Cleaners, a super nice Korean lady came out and said she had a jump starter and asked me to take care of her cleaning store so she can go around the corner to ask her husband to deliver the jump starter. Although the husband took a long time to arrive, before we saw him, Gabriel had this idea of having a yellow cab driver to jump start for us, and it finally worked. In the meantime, he had the waitress delivered us two hot chocolate for free again (it was cold out today). We were so touched. Will definitely come back for our real brunch again, these people are soooooo nice. Thank you so much Gabriel!",,,4
170,Claudia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",213,219,67,3.0,3/17/2015,"I had a good experience here. Our waiter was extremely friendly and accommodating. The puff pastry / bread they serve before the meal is divine and buttery.Taking off stars for the actual food. Not sure if it's due to Restaurant Week or not, but the quality of food left some to be desired. I ordered the Seafood Bisque, Steak dish, and Flourless Chocolate Cake. The bisque was very watery and the consistency was just not right for a bisque. Maybe they ran out of soup and decided to add water? That's what it seemed like, at least. The steak dish comes with a steak filet, gratin, and oxtail. It was alright. The duck dish my mom got was much better. The highlight of the night was definitely my dessert! The flourless chocolate cake was surprisingly light for a flourless cake. It reminded me a heavier lava cake, and it came with raspberry sauce and a side of vanilla icecream. So good.Not sure if I would give this restaurant another shot during non-restaurant week as the normal prices are pretty high (think this restaurant should be $$$ not $$), but I would definitely come again for the desserts!",3,,1
171,Soo Y.,"Charleston, SC",2,73,275,3.0,7/26/2015,"After a few searches, I was looking forward to having a nice brunch at this place. Cappucchino was nicely flavored, and bread basket, had 3 kinds of different roll, baguette and another bread, was very tasty, although breads came when my main brioche french toasts arrived. Service was not too slow, but wish my server was more attentive to me. I wanted to ask what name was my favorite french roll and tried to ask my server about it, but I still didn't get it, because I didn't understand French name.. It was gouget or such according to my server who couldn't spell out the exact name of the roll...My main dish french toast was good, but after finishing my bread basket, it was not warm enough to impress me, anymore..strawberry sauce decorated around toasts didn't have much flavor.  Overall, I somewhat enjoyed my breads, coffee and french toasts, but not superbly excited about this place.",,,
172,Nicole T.,"Manhattan, NY",83,271,11,5.0,4/27/2017,This place is simply delicious! The French decor is authentic right down to the tiled floor and formal servers.

175,Jenna B.,"New York, NY",46,51,41,3.0,8/2/2016,"I was struggling between the 3 stars and the 4 stars, if I could, I'd like to give it a 3.5 stars.Environment: we came here for lunch (restaurant week), and there were not packed with people! Nice! Not until we were seated which was close to the outdoor seats. Why? Because the construction work and the traffic over there were so loud that our conversation was interrupted like three times. Suggestions: sit inside if you would like to have private conversations. Foods: I had salmon tartare as appetizer, the salmon was fresh and sweet, but nothing outstanding, need some salt. Entree was medium rare steak with French fries on the side. Not a fan of dark fries...steak was ok, wish it was pinkish medium rare, mine was like 70% cooked. Dessert: chocolate cake with strawberry sauce and pecan ice cream, enjoyed the chocolate cake A LOT!!! The only impressive things overall. Cause the greenish looking pecan ice cream looked odd and it was just an ok one. Service: waitress was attentive and sweet, 4 stars.Overall experience: 3.5 stars.Conclusion: there are other much better French restaurants out there if you would like to impress your date. If you would just like to stop by and have some casual lunch, by all means go for it!Of course, this review does not reflect the dinner! And it might be subjective since we only ordered whatever available for the restaurant week menu. I would like to go back however, for its spacious inside seating and welcoming services!",,,

178,Arentha C.,"Manhattan, NY",19,103,282,4.0,2/1/2016,"I LOVE ALSATIAN FOOD. Having lived in Alsace, I've been trying very hard to find good Alsatian in NYC. Discovered this gem during RW to my utmost pleasure.Hidden at a corner on the UES (only adds to the charm, may I add), this is one of those cozy, classy, laissez-faire French places we're all too familiar with.With the almond bread as starters, I already surrendered. They were so well-baked! Delicate, flavorful, almost creamy tasting but still puffy. The waiter saw our obsession and kindly brought us a second basket.....The flambee was a tad disappointing as I found them on the greasy and dry side. Friend's winter salad was outstanding though - a very thick layer of avocado paired with prosciutto and artichoke. The combo was heavenly.We both had the bass which I regret - not that the bass wasn't great, but I would really love to have tried the chicken roulade or the cassoulet.Ginger creme brulee was better than the molten chocolate cake, in my opinion.Overall a really positive experience - would definitely come back again.",2,,1

Updated review","I have to say, I'm very happy I came back for dinner! The restaurant had a completely different vibe! It was relaxed, calm and quiet and not crazy like it was for brunch!The vibe was dark, romantic and there was definitely an older crowd, but c'est-la-vie!We started off with the tart flambé. Yum! Pretty much a bacon pizza and really what's not to love?! After we each had a bowl of the butternut squash soup which was a special for the day. It was good, not as thick as I would've wanted it to be, but had great flavor. Afterwards, we shared the winter salad. This salad had everything in it and it was fantastic! It had such an odd combo of items in it that I would never think to put together but it went so well! For our entrée, we shared the choucroute garnie (aka sausage fest). This dish was MASSIVE. Meat on meat on meat, over a very delicious mound of sauerkraut. The sausages ranged from traditional to unique and I couldn't tell you which I liked the best because I'm not sure which was which. I tried them all and there was so much leftover! We had the brussel sprouts on the side, which were obviously served with bacon. (I really think I was sweating bacon at the gym the next day). The brussel sprouts melted in your mouth, I think they were my favorite dish of the evening. We were busting, but dessert came and it was the flourless chocolate gateau which I swore I only was going to have one bite of! Well, I left one bite. It was so, so good. The service was impeccable, our waiter was extremely helpful and informative when we had questions about the menu. Overall, I'd definitely suggest this place for dinner over brunch. It was much more relaxed and excellent for a nice meal. Prices aren't cheap, but they won't break the bank either.",1,1,2

The place itself has a nice decor, a blend of diner and classy European feel. The wait time for 2 people was less than 5 minutes, even tho the place was packed. I ordered the crab omelette which comes with a side of hand cut fries. The crab taste was not overwhelming at all, blended well with the other ingredients. The avocado also tasted fresh and was not too overwhelming. If anything they may have added a bit too much cheese but did not mind it at all My friend ordered the shakshouka, a NorthAfrican breakfast dish with eggs, tomatoes, tomatoes sauce; she added chicken sausage to it; it was my first time trying this type of food and I would highly recommend it.

My sister and I came for brunch on a Sunday mid-afternoon. The restaurant was intimate and played soft music in the background. The waitress was attentive and kept refilling our glasses of water. I had to ask if the water was free because when you eat in the city they will find something to charge. The waitress replied ""No, the water is complimentary,"" and I replied ""It better be because, the way my college bank account is set up..."" Ordered: Croque Monsieur Taste: Sexy. Gruyere cheese in the middle, egg on top of the sandwich. The bread was so fresh and crispy I wanted to save the crust for later (I didn't but imagine if I did).
