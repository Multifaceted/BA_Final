Highly recommend brunch on the weekend here. The waffle, egg & fried chicken options are EVERYTHING. The sauces are so unique that add the new flavors you're looking for.Waffle Benedict is so tasty, I had to order it again and add chicken breast. I kid you not, this would be one of the best decisions to make off of this menu if you're hungry. Would keep coming back!p.s the servers are so awesome, one of them noticed syrup on the table close to my phone and asked if he could wipe it down for me. ""Of course!"" I didn't even notice it.. would have been a sticky situation if it got all over my phone",,,
1,Love E.,"Manhattan, NY",253,25,7,1.0,11/8/2018,"The most disappointing restaurant ever. This is not southern cuisine at all. The food LACKED flavor. The Mac and cheese tasted like eraser. The fried chicken was so BLAND and dry. And then they had the nerve to have ""sprinkled salt"" on the chicken as a garnish lmfaoooo. I was fuming. Everything lacked so many things. The shrimp and grits had an aftertaste that made me want to throw up. I don't know what kind of sick gentrified joke this is but you got me good. This place needs to change its direction. This is NOT a southern cuisine restaurant at all, especially NOT for people who enjoy SEASONED food; if you know what I mean!! We were a party of 5 and NONE OF US enjoyed the food at all. I'm even confused what the long wait was for lmfaoooooo Almost feel like reporting this to my bank as fraud because I feel swindled!!!. Terrible unseasoned uncultured culture-vulture food, man. & Do not let Instagram likes fool you.",1,1,
2,Kristie P.,"Inwood, NY",162,97,284,5.0,11/8/2018,"This is my second time at Root & Bone and I'd be doing it a disservice by not giving it 5 stars. Made brunch reservations for a few Sundays ago (make sure you book early, as the place is pretty small and gets booked up pretty quick). As soon as you walk through the door, the smell of delicious herbs and spices guides you all the way to your seats. Service was attentive and we received our menus, waters, drinks, etc. right away. Most of the food can be shared so we ordered biscuits, whole chicken (don't worry, it comes in pieces so everyone can have a drumstick), grits, Mac and cheese, and the biscuits and gravy. Let me tell you, the food here is amazing. The biscuits are pretty flaky and come with some sort of maple butter sauce that you can drizzle or dip into. The chicken is very well seasoned with a great crunch exterior and wasn't too greasy either (though I don't think I'd complain if it was!). It was brined in ice tea and you get the perfect faintest taste when you take a bite. The Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy with a nice firm crust - they use cavatappi which I think is the best way to make 'macaroni' and cheese. The gravy biscuits were to die for - so rich and creamy and soft! I think the grits were probably the least favorite of the table. There was lots of corn and not as much cheese; really not what you'd expect for traditional southern style grits. We also got the apple tart, though I'm not sure how we had room, and that was out of this world good. Root & Bone is a brunch staple that everyone has to try at least once. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",,,1
3,James W.,"New York, NY",165,276,401,4.0,11/2/2018,"Wow, I'm a big fan of the fried chicken here. I would consider myself a fried chicken connoisseur (considering how much fried chicken I eat in a year, and the fact that I will order fried chicken anywhere that has it on their menu) and the fried chicken is amazing. The portions are huge BTW. My friend and I had ordered a considerable amount of food thinking that we wouldn't get full from the entrees. But, we were wrong.When the fried chicken came, I thought they had mistakenly given me the large portion when I had ordered the small portion. The basket probably had 6 large pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken was savory and tasted even more amazing when eaten with their honey tabasco sauce. My friend ordered the braised short rib meatloaf and we shared the biscuits and gravy and the mac and cheese. Everything we ordered was pretty tasty, but the fried chicken definitely stole the show. Luckily, we didn't have to wait very long for a table. I would love to come back for brunch, but have heard that the wait is impossible. Regardless, I will be back for the fried chicken!",1,,
4,Brietta Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,534,317,4.0,11/13/2018,"I had no idea I've already been here before until I arrived to pick up my lunch order. At first, I was upset because I'm trying to hit as many places as I can that I haven't been to before my due date, knocking off places that serve take-out in the city that I've bookmarked, but after that first bite of chicken wing, I thought it was totally worth it. The chicken wing from the Fried Chicken & Three that I ordered was extremely juicy, flavorful, and tender but unfortunately, the breast for some reason had no flavor at all and was disappointingly very dry. The waffles and mac and cheese were just as good as I remembered too so the only downside was that breast but I still enjoyed my lunch overall.",,,
5,Amanda G.,"New York, NY",201,88,73,5.0,10/14/2018,"Yet another restaurant I've walked by 5 million times and never gone into until now. Root and Bone is aesthetically pleasing to walk by on your way to class, and even better for stopping in for brunch! There was no wait to sit at the bar or outside at 11 on a Sunday, which is particularly nice considering a lot of the brunch places around here are incredibly crowded by that time on a weekend. The menu had a nice variety of options for brunch, with some heartier options and some lighter options. The server was nice and super attentive. I had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and my mom had the biscuit egg and cheese sandwich. The biscuits were heavenly--so thick and rich yet also fluffy. The gravy was nice and flavorful and my mom loved the bacon on her sandwich. They also had big coffee mugs which is always a plus. Overall my meal was great. I'm interested to try this place for dinner too.",1,,
6,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",362,209,333,4.0,9/26/2018,"I'm from the south, so I can be a tough critic sometimes,But this place is pretty good.Things I love:1. Drunken deviled eggs2. Angel biscuits 3. Chicken slider biscuits 4. Egg slider biscuits And... THEY HAVE CHEERWINE!The space itself is beaut-I-ful. I love this quirky rustic vibe. Very southern, very chic. And during the warmer months they have outdoor seating, which is always lovely. 4.7/5",1,,
7,Candace H.,"Brooklyn, NY",296,246,516,5.0,8/31/2018,"My friend and I checked out Root & Bone on the last day of the August NYC Restaurant Week and we were not disappointed. We came in around 1pm for the brunch menu.Because I am a self proclaimed foodie and had been looking at the menu for a few days in advance I pretty much already knew what I wanted. I started with the Gem Lettuce salad which was absolutely delicious! The second course had to include the chicken and waffles with the side of macaroni and cheese. For dessert we had the key lime pie which I'd absolutely pass on next time. I'm the type of person that loves dessert and all sweet things; however, the key lime pie was way way way too sweet for my liking. Nevertheless, because it was restaurant week I got all of that for $26! Out of everything I had I'd say the macaroni and cheese was my favorite. The chicken was delicious as well especially with the honey tabasco hot sauce. Overall, the service was friendly and attentive. I will definitely return. The woman sitting next to me had the biscuits and gravy which I will definitely be trying next time. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area or anyone who is simply looking for some top quality comfort food.",7,3,7
8,Eric C.,"San Francisco, CA",148,48,97,3.0,9/17/2018,"3.5 stars rounded down. ""southern comfort"" food in a pretty watered down fashion. There were some decent dishes but also some misses as well. Came for lunch on a weekday around 1:30 and it was pretty much empty - conversely if you come for dinner on a Friday or Saturday without a reservation you'll end up waiting all night. Started with the deviled eggs and Macaroni & cheese. Deviled eggs were good, but not super special. Didn't taste like there was much added to the egg yolk mix other than mayo. The Mac and cheese was a better starter but the noodles were a little overcooked. For mains we got the fried chicken biscuits (a little overbattered, not that crispy) and short rib meatloaf. The mealoaf was more like shredded beef pressed into squares vs a real meatloaf. Was a little dry for my liking and didn't carry any real oomph. Ended with the key lime pie which was not good - sickly sweet and hard to finish. Overall not a terrible place but not worth the $, hype or wait if you come at a busy time. Try Jacobs Pickles for their fried chicken instead.",,,
9,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,5.0,10/21/2018,"Was looking for a brunch spot in the East Village and Root & Bone* looked like the most appetizing place saved in my bookmarks. Apparently you can make a brunch reservation here, which is so rare that I didn't even check to see if that was a possibility. Upon our arrival at around 1:30 pm, we were told we could eat outside (it was freezing) or wait it out for about 30 minutes. The staff will take your phone number and text you when the table is ready, which is really the only proper way to handle waits at restaurants. As it turns out, the wait was only 17 minutes, and we spent that time watching the Eagles game** at a bar nearby. Back at R&B: We were seated on two barstools overlooking both the street and also the few patrons who opted to eat outside, which was awkward because we were staring at their food a lot. The food is very 'grammable here, as is most food nowadays, I guess.So the place was super cute and we enjoyed people watching and whatever, but the food was the obvious highlight of the experience. I ordered the fried chicken biscuits, which was served with pepper jelly, a few chips (in the biscuit--weird) and pickled veggies (pretty; served on the side). Yeah, this was so good it was kinda nuts. The biscuits were about as fluffy as biscuits could be, and also salt-crusted and crunchy on top. The white-meat chicken was so tender, which is so hard to do. [Nobody wants to eat dry chicken, but it happens sometimes.] The pepper jelly was sweet, tangy, and savory. And the pickled veggies added an eye-popping jolt of flavor. There was obviously a lot going on in this dish, but it was all done with so much care that nothing got lost in the shuffle.We also tried the shrimp n grits (melted tomato pickled onion, corn, and bacon beer jus), which is seemingly the thing people get here when they don't get the fried chicken. Unsurprisingly, this is a heavy, buttery dish, that is not too complex but nevertheless delicious. The pickled onions add an exciting, unexpected element, and who doesn't love corn? I could only taste a hint of smoke from the bacon jus.The one unfortunate aspect of the meal was that they were out of basically every coffee drink on the menu except drip coffee. I ordered that, and it was on the weaker side, though served in an attractive green mug. Also, no Splenda. I love Splenda and am going to start a one-women Yelp crusade to get restaurants to serve Splenda everywhere.*Actual name of this restaurant. My boyfriend kept calling it ""Rag and Muffin"". What? No. I think he was joking but I can't be sure.**Blew a 17-point lead in the 4th quarter; fabulous job.",1,,3
10,Annie M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,93,673,2.0,8/8/2018,"Don't understand the hype; Was so disappointed.Just to be clear, my criticism does not stem from the snobby POV, 'The hype was too high and therefore it didn't meet my perfect expectations'. It's more like 'Where's the closest Popeyes because I don't understand this"" type of disappointment. Dessert was the most memorable because of how awful it is. Their key lime pie was the sweetest thing I've ever had in my life. Had one bite. Their buttercream cupcake looked mediocre and then tasted exactly how it appeared. Also had one bite.Fried chicken was not crispy whatsoever. Chicken skin was thin and soggy.The braised beef was actually not too bad because the browned outer portion was slightly crispy. My friend thought it was a bit dry. Fried oysters: Was crispy unlike their fried chicken.Mac & cheese and biscuits were alright. I've had better. Deviled eggs were actually the best thing I had all night.I feel bad for writing this review, but my wallet also feels bad because their food was not cheap. Not worth it. Not coming back. Oh, and waiter service was alright. Waited a while before getting our order in, but everything went smooth after that.",6,,
11,Masha S.,"Manhattan, NY",200,10,29,5.0,11/2/2018,So charming and amazingly delicious food!!Highly recommended for brunch:*Biscuits*deviled eggs*fried chicken & three - comes w Mac and cheese in the cutest little pan and waffles!,,,
12,Su C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,66,188,3.0,11/2/2018,"Maybe I had too much expectation about the place.. I have heard that this place is popular with extremely long waits on weekends. I love chicken and waffles so I was excited to try this top chef related restaurant. The place is definitely cute and the staffs are friendly. Well decorated bar which is tiny but really pretty. The place was a bit smaller than I thought. Maybe that's why there is a long wait on weekends. However, the location is out of nowhere. It was sOOoooo far from the train stations. Anyway, the food.. hmmm.. the chickens were kind of hard to chew.. wasn't moist at all. And the chicken portion was extremely small for the price. Waffles, nothing out of ordinary. They were small and round so it's cute. Also, the watermelons that come out with chicken and waffles, were not marinated at all. I have had moist chicken and waffles with well marinated cubed watermelons at other restaurants before. Not sure if I'm coming back since it's so far.",,,
13,Christy Y.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",93,18,21,2.0,11/13/2018,"Disappointed by the hype to be honest. The wait was long but not unexpected for such a popular restaurant. The menu sounded very exciting but the food was a let down. After all the hype from people about this place being the MUST try chicken and waffles spot, I came with high expectations. The presentation of the food was very nice and made for great pictures but the chicken was dry and pretty bland. It wasn't even crispy! I feel like I would've had a more satisfying experience at KFC. I don't think I will be giving this spot another chance.",,,
14,Amy F.,"New York, NY",101,63,641,5.0,7/17/2018,"I love this place!! I've been here twice, but most recently I came on a Friday around 7:30 PM. Much to my surprise, my friend and I were seated immediately. They were pretty busy though, and it seemed tougher for larger groups to be seated quickly. It's a small, cozy restaurant in lower east side with plenty of outdoor seating. I highly recommend coming on a nice day / evening!Fried chicken. Waffles. Mac n cheese. The whole fried chicken ($36) comes with plenty of crisply fried and tender chicken wings that'll put you in a food coma after... I split this with one other person and thought it was a bit too much on top of the sides. We finished it, but I highly recommend ~coming hungry~. Order the wings with the waffles (+$7) which come with cheese on top and make sure to drench them in their syrup. It's like make your own chicken and waffles. The meal isn't complete without the side of mac n cheese in a hot skillet. Seriously delicious. I tried the raspberry sour beer, perfect for a summer evening. I'm highly partial to the can's simple design.",3,1,1
15,Tiffany W.,"Philadelphia, PA",294,55,71,3.0,7/30/2018,"Root & Bone is good Southern food, but nothing there is standout. I came here for a Thursday night dinner, and left disappointed. While it's a very cute, cozy place, the service was terrible. It took the waitress 30 minutes to come take our order, and she was very brusque during the entirety of our meal. My friend and I split the side order of macaroni, she ordered the risotto, and I ordered the shrimp and grits. I want to preface by saying the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. While Root & Bone is one that prides itself on making simple ingredients taste great, I thought everything was underwhelming. The macaroni was fine, but it wasn't anything special. While it was pretty to look at and photograph, it was under-seasoned and was nothing out of the ordinary. The shrimp and grits were better. The grits were super creamy and full of flavor. However, several of my shrimp hadn't been deveined, which was definitely an unpleasant surprise.If there were half stars allowed, I would give Root & Bone 3.5 stars. While I've heard this restaurant is great for brunch, but there are better places to be for dinner. For the price you pay for each dish, the food isn't worth the cost.",1,,
16,Carol L.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,51,29,5.0,7/27/2018,"Really good food and really good service! So glad I got to try this place! We came here on a Friday at 6:30 pm. I think we lucked out bc it was raining and even though all the tables were reserved, we were able to still get seats at the counter. I guess we came here during restaurant week bc they had a deal for a few courses in their menu for $42/pp. It came with biscuits and Mac and cheese for us to share, a choice of a small dish, choice of main, and choice of dessert. We got the fried oysters and devil's eggs for the small plates, fried chicken and waffles for our main, and the key lime pie and red velvet cupcake for dessert. Everything was really good! Or server was delightful. He recommended the Kentucky mule for my cocktail and I wasn't disappointed!",1,,
17,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",341,79,160,3.0,10/12/2018,"This was a place I overheard one of my co-workers talking about how much she wanted to go and it sparked my interest. As a result, I made a reservation the next day. I had the the beautifully presented deviled eggs as you can see below, were very good. However the salt content would have a young person in need of pressure meds.  The Bucket of bird was great. I don't usually eat fried chicken at restaurants but this was an exception. The mac and cheese wasn't the stuff I was raised on but it was pretty damn close ... Overall.. it's a good place to go if you want some comfort food without having to cook it yourself.",,,
18,Ayumi S.,"Pasadena, CA",4082,1092,1783,3.0,9/15/2018,"So, this place wasn't bad..but I was a little bothered by the hostess.We come in and asked how long a wait would be for 2 people. She said we could sit at the bar (this place is pretty tiny btw)..and I asked how long it would be for a table. She said, ""45 minutes."" I looked around and just shrugged it off and we sat at the bar. There also wasn't anyone else waiting to be seated..just us.We immediately got water, and some menus to look at as well. The bar looks directly into the kitchen, and it just wasn't really comfortable to sit there.We got some drinks..bf got a beer and I got:Julia Sugarbaker $13-bourbon, preserved peach, fresh lemon, and lavender amaro-It was good and refreshing.Shortly after we received our drinks, we saw a table leave and there was actually another table available. Bf waved down a waiter and asked if we could sit at a table and it was no problem at all. I just didn't like the whole ""45 minutes"" basic answer, because that was really stretching it.Our table we got was much better, and we got our food REALLY really quickly.For food we got: Angel biscuits $7 - You just get 2 small biscuits..they were good, but..more would be nice! The honey chicken jus was very liquidy (which I know it says jus)Mac & Cheese $9 - Not badSweet tea brined fried chicken whole $36 - Sadly, it wasn't as crunchy as I hoped it would be. It was more chewy and kind of soggy? There was crunch, but not much. The chicken was definitely juicy and had flavors, but..not the best fried chicken I've had.Took some food back home, and I did like how they packed everything for us in cute little containers. I saved the breast for last and had to use some honey dijon for extra flavors.",11,8,9
19,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1553,5.0,6/29/2018,"I've long been skeptical about both brunch and Southern food in NYC, so it was a surprising turn of events for me to both seek out Root & Bone a few Sundays ago and absolutely love it. It's exactly the bougie, boozy fried chicken place I feared it would be, but it does it so well.Our party of two showed up around noon without reservations and were told there would be about a ten minute wait for bar seats. We took a walk around the block and it was ready soon after we came back. Our bar seats ended up being cozily tucked up against a photogenic bar well stocked with whiskey and mason jars and anchored by antler-topped beer taps.You're here for the fried chicken, which comes in plenty of combinations or can be added on to other offerings, but there was a reasonably varied list of Southern-tinged alternatives, like cheddar buckwheat waffles, shrimp and grits, and rhubarb-strawberry salad. There are smaller plates and sides under $10; larger dishes will run you $15 and up. They have gluten-free options available, vegetarians can eat decently here, and everything looks pretty nut-allergen friendly as well.Between the two of us, we had heirloom tomato toast ($14) and half sweet tea brined fried chicken ($19). The former was tasty, with juicy, flavorful tomatoes stuck to crispy toast with a nice homemade aioli. The pickled ramps were a pleasant surprise.The fried chicken deserves its own paragraph. It's served piping hot, with a crackly but not too assertive skin and super-tender insides, and not too heavy at all. The lemon dusting is positively addictive. Just a good bird all around. Would happily get it again even at this inflated price.Service was excellent, and the meal relatively quick at 45 minutes. Decor and atmosphere make even a casual lunch feel celebratory. No booze for us, though they have a nice selection of classic cocktails and brunch drinks, as well as beer, cider, and kombucha. My boyfriend's cappuccino ($5ish) was stellar.Assuming you're comfortable spending $25ish a person for brunch after tax and tip, without drinks, you'll be happy here. Just a highly pleasant, well-executed Southern brunch.",5,3,4
20,Angelo B.,"Westfield, NJ",199,679,611,4.0,9/15/2018,"Really liked the fried chicken here. Will get this again. The biscuits were good, although I'm not a big biscuits person so am probably not the best judge.  Waffles were only okay. Next time, I'll stick to the chicken. Note that the portions are big. We ordered a few dishes, and it ended up being too much for 2 people.Friendly service and cool decor. Will return",4,1,3
21,Ian J.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,502,84,3.0,9/18/2018,"In a city with so many of these Southern-inspired places, I'd have to say this was just okay. My craving for this cuisine is always high up there, and so when I try out a new (to me at least) restaurant, maybe I set my expectations in a weird spot.Anyway, I was left underwhelmed by Root & Bone. There was apparently all sorts of hype surrounding this place that I was unaware of, and after having gone without that in mind, I still left (and the group with me) feeling a bit let down.Service was fine, everyone was friendly and attentive, at least until we had to wait for a while to ask for the check with empty plates.Beyond that, the food was the main problem. Things just didn't taste good, portions were odd, and items didn't seem to match their sides in terms of flavor or texture.I had the pulled pork and it was just not good. Bun was dry, pork was chewy, and really nothing about the dish was enjoyable. It seems that most meals we tried resulted in the same feeling of ""what did I just eat?"" From the grits to the desserts. Dessert was particularly mediocre.Ultimately, it appears that the fried chicken sandwich is the thing people go for, and we all intentionally skipped it. Probably should have had that and nothing else for everyone in the group, maybe the review would be different? I don't know... one dish does not a great restaurant make.",2,,1

I felt pretty ""eh"" through the whole thing.*** FOOD ***We had the mac and cheese to start, and then pork chops and short ribs as our mains. For a restaurant labeled as a cuisine associated with shameless mountains of butter put into its meals, it produced a mac and cheese that was hurtfully average. The pork chops and short ribs were also pretty average for this price point. Definitely was disappointed with the mediocrity and lack of innovation around these dishes. Perhaps a rebranding of the restaurant would do it some good.*** DRINKS ***They have alcoholic kombucha, which is pretty cool.*** SERVICE ***Good.",1,1,

We were seated at the bar area. It also was Resturant week and I tried to get the special. But I couldn't because my cousin wasn't ordering anything from the restaurant week menu?  It made no sense.  But I wanted the fried chicken. So I got the dark meat.  With a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken came out really quick and was crispy and delicious.  The Mac and cheese was pretty good too.  My cousin said she liked her shrimp and grits but it wasn't like shrimp and grits from new Orleans.,5,2,5

The unlimited mimosas were great. Not full of juice and a couple of bottle for our one pitcher. we order the food which came from next door Root & Bones and it was the worst. It literally came out within 5 mins. We were kinda surprised and shocked to see the food arriving so fast. Well the food was cold. Literally cold. Only thing hot were the greens which were glory greens from the can. Chicken was dry and under cooked. Mac and cheese! Lawd! It had dry shredded cheese and bread crumbles on top. Shredded cheese on top like a taco. Waffle was dry and nasty. Do not eat at root and bones.,,,

My husband had the gluten free sweet tea brined chicken of course, with cheesy grits.

31,Joelle G.,"New York, NY",289,763,71,3.0,9/4/2018,"I decided to come here during RW to see what all the fuss and hype was about. I'll just say that Root & Bone has a phenomenal lunch/brunch deal that was too amazing to pass up. They truly supply you with more food than you can possibly eat in one sitting. The waitress I had was great, her service being appropriate and pretty much timely.In regards to southern cuisine? I felt as though I was having extremely healthy, gentrified, vegan-esque southern eats. Let me explain. Having gone to school in the South, southern cooking is a blessing and a curse from the gods. This is a type of cuisine that you treat yourself to seldom. Southern cuisine shouldn't be consumed on a daily, nor weekly basis. Else you won't be able to fit yourself through a standard doorway and you'll have extensively clogged arteries. That being said, southern cooking and its ingredients should never be skimped on. I want my food to taste amazing with all the pickings and adornments. I want some grease, some lard (unfortunately it comes with the territory) along with all the meat, cheese, and sugar that I personally can bear.Root and bone is alright, but I feel they skimped on the 'soul food' component of their cuisine.  The waffles and chicken were the best thing I had out of everything present. The mac and cheese was 'meh', it was more loose and crumby than cheesy and flavorful. The key lime pie was way too sweet. I couldn't and didn't want to finish it.But they do say they are conscientiously sourced with farm-fresh ingredients. I clearly missed that memo.",,,
32,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,4.0,8/6/2018,"Solid Southern comfort food with friendly service and YES - BRUNCH RESERVATIONS.  I always get either the chicken & three with seasoned fried chicken, waffle, and mac & cheese or the meatloaf with fried eggs and potatoes.  The chicken is crispy and juicy and pairs well with the syrup and buckwheat waffle - without the syrup it can be slightly on the salty side.  I would also add some butter to the waffle as it is made from buckwheat so offers less of the traditional butter waffle taste.  It also comes with a side of watermelon which adds a splash of freshness to an otherwise relatively heavy dish.  The meatloaf is also nicely seasoned and juicy - and a very welcome change from the standard steak frites.  Be sure to get a basket of the buttery biscuits with honeyed gravy to start - because it's not Southern fare without biscuits - and these are pretty good.  Definitely worth a visit for brunch if you are craving comfort food.  I also noticed that many of the items can be prepared gluten-free which is definitely a plus, especially for brunch.",2,1,3
33,Andrew D.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,41,31,4.0,6/10/2018,Came here on a Saturday night with a few friends. They have inside and outside seating but only had outdoor seating at the time. I didn't have a problem with that since it was nice out. I ordered the half fried chicken with waffles. I honestly didn't think there would be huge portions but I was surprised at how much food there was. The waffles werent overly sweet and the whiskey maple syrup they gave with it complimented the dish well. The chicken was lightly fried and wasn't overly oily. It was nice and juicy and not just salty. The food didn't make me feel sluggish afterwards which was a positive especially since it was fried food.My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and seemed to like it. I tried some of the grits and it was creamy but also had corn in it which I don't like so it wasn't for me. She also got some Mac and cheese for a side dish which was kind of disappointing. Felt like there wasn't much flavor in it and didn't seem to have enough cheese. Overall I enjoyed my meal and would come back again.,,,

We were seated at the bar because the ""tables were reserved""... despite the tables being empty throughout our entire meal. The bartender serviced us, although we did not order any drinks. The drunken deviled eggs were nothing to rave about as it lacked flavor. The only thing that saved it was the taro chip. Mac and cheese was a bit on the bland side and only a few bites were taken. We were not a fan of the cheese on the waffles and why didn't our server tell us our order of the bird came with waffles? If we knew, we wouldn't have ordered waffles! The chicken was crispy and had a nice crunch.. the sauce was a nice addition and probably the only dish we enjoyed. Food is way overpriced for quality and quantity.",3,,

Everything was amazing, especially the grits. The saw mill gravy would be delicious on cardboard. It's not my first time here but it never disappoints. The honey Tabasco sauce is amazing on everything as well.",,2,

The chicken and waffle was really good. The chicken was crispy on the outside while still juicy on the inside. Paired great with the waffle which was just the slightest bit sweet. I'd go back for this dish. The cinnamon buns were great. Just dripping and soaked all up in deliciously sweet frosting. It's a very large side. Not a one-person thing. And definitely for sugar rush addicts. Biscuits and gravy was good too. It's a heavy dish. The gravy is thick and savory. Just bite a mouthful and enjoy.",1,,

It's so hard to say no to some nicely grilled shrimp, cheesy grits...ugh let me stop.

BLOODY MARY W/VODKAYou have the option between bourbon, vodka, and tequila. Tequila sounds like I want to drink into the night, so vodka it was, and it was a good decision. Nice spice and great flavor. BUT $13.Remember what I said about embracing my inner hipster? Yea, I meant the type of hipster that says they're going to turn vegan, smokes a pack a day, and pays too much for food that they could probably get even better in Queens or past the 'Burg in Brooklyn.

Ok, so it wasn't in the Bronx (fried chicken central in NYC apparently) but it had amazing reviews so we went. We knew that fried chicken was there specialty and oh was that right! Beautiful battered, and oh so moist and tasty. The half bird had some of the juiciest white meat I've ever had, and the gravy was truly a triumph of southern tradition. Service was really efficient and friendly, and the place had a nice cozy vibe to it. I'd strongly recommend a visit, and best not to have eaten much before hand because portions are large and the food is very filling.  I will definitely return.",1,,

42,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",417,624,1367,5.0,3/12/2018,"Root and Bone has been on my list for a couple of years now, pretty much from when it opened. When Gilt City offered a deal a couple of months ago, I had to pull the trigger. The scene here is pretty cool. It's some kind of mix of modern industrial look with white painted brick walls and rich wood shelves and bars all over. The space is a little tight with bar seating all over and adjacent to all of the tables, and on a Monday night, there wasn't an open seat in the house and a pack of people waiting at the entrance for a seat to open. You'll want / need a reservation here. The Gilt City deal was an insanely good value for an obscenely large amount of food. The Gilt City deal left me with a lot of food guilt, with the amount we got. Drunken Deviled Eggs - loved these. There was something a little pickley, a little dilly, and a lot eggy. Just a really well executed dish here. Gem Salad - I'll say something I don't often say. This is an awesome salad. There. I said it. The combination of the sweet corn and the pickled onions and the creamy ricotta and the garlic vinaigrette really just all combine for one awesome salad. Angel Biscuits - fantastically executed biscuits. Moist, flaky, sweet, salty, and buttery. They are great on their own, but the chicken honey jus added an extra dimension that's both sweet and savory, much like the biscuit itself. Fried Chicken and Cheddar Waffles - a half order of chicken here is a lot of clucking chicken. The birds are pressure fried and come out perfectly crispy and juicy and tender. The waffles were a solid pairing with the chicken, but not quite as memorable as the chicken itself, and just as filling. Mac and Cheese - creamy and cheesy macaroni. It's another well executed version of the American classic. Collared Greens - well balanced dish with tender bites of savory ham cut with the apple cider vinegar. Nice dish. Short Rib ""Meatloaf"" - this was the one miss of the night for me. I love the creativity of this dish, taking short ribs, shredding them and forming them into a loaf. In the literal sense, it is certainly a loaf of meat, but I feel like they would have been better off just serving short ribs. Shrimp and Grits - creamy, lightly cheesy grits, speckled with corn kernels, pickled onions, and plump shrimp. This dish is exactly what you want it to be. Chocolate Pudding and Key Lime Pie - if chocolate pudding snack packs and a chocolate mouse had a baby, this chocolate pudding would be that baby. The key lime pie in a mini mason jar is tangy and delicious with a crunchy graham cracker crust at the bottom. So overall, I was really surprised with how much I enjoyed nearly every aspect of this meal. My suggestions? Go with the deviled eggs, gem salad, fried chicken (sans waffles), biscuits, maybe shrimp and grits if you have a larger appetite, and maybe just one side. All of this food is excellent, but god damn is this some stick to your ribs cooking. Resist the urge to overindulge. You'll enjoy the meal more if you aren't stuffed silly.",2,,1

Server was super nice and attentive. The fried chicken and mac and cheese were delicious as well as the deviled eggs. All very flavorful and perfectly spiced. Pulled pork sandwich was one of the best I've ever had! I normally don't like hot sauce/use it but their housemade hot sauce on the table was incredible, definitely give it a try.

My favorite dish, that I order every time is the fried chicken mini biscuits. They are just so perfect. Biscuits are buttery, fried chicken is crispy and juicy and that honey tobasco syrup with it is everything  It is always super hard to get a table on the weekends, so I recommend coming early. The ambiance is cute but very narrow and small. Some of the food I think is also overpriced. But definitely worth checking out for their delicious fried chicken biscuits.",1,1,1

Table seating in the back is a bit tight, so you can't have a private conversation and eating space is limited. MUST order the friend chicken. Wish it could've been more crispy, same goes for the waffles.. but they were delicious in taste. Also ordered the Mac and cheese, which were nice and cheesy. Not dry at all. If you have room, order the biscuits.. they serve it with some honey that makes it all just melt in your mouth! Wasn't too impressed with the drinks, But they were heavy on the pour which is always a great thing. PS* make reservations. If you arrive early, your not able to sit at the bar and drink while you wait to be seated, bar seating is full service, but the workers do offer to grab your drink for you while you wait by the door.",1,,
46,Mandee P.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,186,5.0,2/17/2018,"OH. MY. GOODNESS. I was absolutely blown away by this place. I have been wanting to go for quite some time. I saw a deal on Gilt for a 5-course meal for 2 and figured now was as good as a time as any. The place is so cute. I love the ambiance. It is small, so I do recommend a reservation if you're planning to go. We had reservations for 8:30pm and arrived early. They were very accommodating and seated us almost immediately. There was no need to order from the menu for this 5-course meal. All of the meals were predetermined. We were pretty excited. I must say, 5-courses sounded like a lot but it's way more than I even expected! I feel like we got to sample a majority of the menu. We shared drunken deviled eggs, little gem salad, and angel biscuits. Those were courses 1 & 2. We were then brought a basket of fried chicken and waffles along with Mac n cheese and collard greens. THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! The chicken was so tasty and juicy. It was amongst the best I've ever had. Even the tobacco sauce was good. I don't usually apply hot sauce but it was so tasty to dab. I put a bit of syrup on the cheddar waffles. It was delicious! I had my reservations about cheddar waffles, I didn't think I'd like the addition of cheese...ummm...WRONG. Perfection. That was course 3. Course 4 - I must start off by saying after the chicken, we were full and thought we were done. I guess I miscounted. Shrimp and grits. My husband is allergic to shrimp and they were kind enough to serve the shrimp separately (so I could eat it!! Yum) I've had grits twice before and never this delicious, especially with the shrimp. We were also given small pieces of the meatloaf and what looked like a loaded baked potato. I was full and still had to nibble because it was so tasty. We got some of this to go. I'm still looking forward to the leftovers!!For desert we got the key lime pie and maple creme brûlée. Both are served in small jars. They were great of course! Key lime pie was really sweet, but key lime pie is always sweet. I really liked my creme brûlée. The maple crumble was such a great addition. I love this place!

Chicken itself were super yummy and crispy, my taste buds gladly accepted them... while my brain ignores the high triglycerides warning my doctor gave, but yolo.

If I had biscuits and gravy like this when I was in college I'd be in trouble. The biscuit itself is actually semi-sweet despite being covered in sausage-y gravy. The fried chicken is light and airy. I'm still not a chicken fan but I'll eat it fried. The breast is not as good as the leg.

Having all studied the menu ahead of time, we each knew exactly what we wanted to get (all chose the same items).The evening started off with complimentary biscuits which were soooo good. They came with this sauce that we weren't sure what was, but it was delicious with the biscuits (later looked it up and discovered it was meat juice- I think I'm glad I didn't know that's what it was). Next we each got the gem salad. which was very good. A little too salty for my liking, but still good. I loved the pickled onions on top.Next came the chicken and waffles and mac n cheese.. both were SO GOOD. The mac n cheese was so creamy and rich, and I loved the type of noodle they used for it. The chicken and waffles were also delicious, especially with adding syrup to them. I didn't love the addition of cheese on the waffles, though, because I felt the dish was enough without the cheese and also because we were given mac n cheese for the table. It didn't really detract from the taste enjoyment but it felt unnecessary to me. Beware- the chicken and waffles comes with A LOT of chicken. Better than the opposite, but I barely got through half of it. We gave our leftovers to a homeless man because we didn't want to eat fried chicken for another meal, so at least it didn't go uneaten.We finished with the key lime pie which was also very good, and wasn't too big of a serving (I have issues with self control and dessert.. then again, who doesn't). Our waitress was very attentive throughout. The atmosphere inside was also great- very cozy and quaint with cute decor everywhere.

From the moment I walked in, you smell all the different aromas of Mac and cheese, biscuits and fried chicken (which makes you even more hungry) The service was very good, all the waitstaff was very welcoming and ready to give any suggestion you might need on what to order. The decor was also really rustic and went well with all the food offerings. For the food: I ordered the Mac and cheese and the honey biscuits. Both were absolutely amazing. The mac and cheese was definitely made with sharp cheddar so you actually tasted the cheese well and it wasn't bland like most places!

The biscuits were juicy, filled with flavor, and a tad sweet from the honey. I wouldn't think I would love it as much as I did. In addition we got the Root & Bone Fried Chicken, half bird to share, and a side of mac and cheese. The chicken was juicy, tender and flavorful.

We also were called in about 20mins later.. and when we got in there were at least 4-5 empty tables around us. The service today was pretty bad all around.

The lady there asked if he could wait for our waitress to come to our table but we had already been waiting for a while. The food was also a tad disappointing. I expected the chicken to be crispy but it clearly was not. The flavor was there if you squeezed some lemon juice and dipped it in their Tabasco/honey sauce.

I ordered the chicken and three, which comes with two pieces of fried chicken and collard greens, waffles, and Mac n cheese. Firstly the fried chicken was flavorless and not crispy at all. The waffles did not stand out either. They tasted like those waffles you get at a continental breakfast buffet in a hotel. The collard greens were okay. It had very korean cuisine flavors to it which was unexpected. To be honest, the Mac and cheese was probably the best thing that I ordered. It was creamy, cheesy, and delicious, although a tad bit salty. The honey tobacco sauce and maple syrup were okay as well. The customer service is great and the interior is rustic and cozy, but the food was just ok. I will probably check out other restaurants if craving fried chicken.",2,,

Had supper with the Ladies, we feasted on the pre-fixed supper. Where do I start?Our Hostess,She greeted us with a warm engaging smile, and sat us at the most quaint delightful table. Our Waiter,A polite, friendly smile, which might I add fabulous eye candy! He did not rush us, explained the menu to us, and made sure our courses were paced, and we were happy campers. He also knew the menu intimately, which was a wonderful plus. The Food,Where could they go wrong, no where!  The biscuits - OMG, the Fried Chicken (""Smack Your Mama Good!"") The desserts - I'm a fan of the chocolate pudding. The People,Engaged with some of the most friendliest people in NYC.  The first table next to us was a couple, who offered for us to try their dish when we inquired as it looked so delicious. Btw, it was a grilled salad. Second couple next to us were visiting from out of town, and she said she smelled fried chicken in the air, and her nose lead her to Root and Bone.

I finally got to cross it off!We ordered sticky buns and ""Fried Chicken &Three."" The sticky buns were gooey and topped with nuts. They were a bit too sweet for me (and I have a major sweet tooth) but enjoyable. Next up was the entree. The mac and cheese had a nice consistency--creamy on the bottom and breadcrumbs on the top. It was extra cheesy in the best way possible. The waffles were fresh but I wish they had a softer texture. The collard greens had a small kick of spice which livened up the flavor. The fried chicken was incredible--super juicy and the meat fell right off the bone.The server was friendly and checked in with us sufficiently. The place is a bit small so I wouldn't recommend coming with big parties. It's also a pretty popular place so to avoid a line I'd recommend coming during off-hours.",,,1

Let me start by saying be prepared to leave this place in an hour and a half from the start of your reservation. If you are not, your server will rudely remind you of that! Now, we made reservations here about 3 weeks ago as we realise that this is a popular brunch spot. Now we reached at 11 but 1 person from out group could not make it till 11:20. Anyhow, we were seated and we immediately ordered drinks and something to start with. As soon as out guest arrived, our server told us that we should order soon as we only have the table till 12:30pm! We would have understood had there been a line/wait outside but there was no such thing and on the contrary there were 2 tables empty right next to us the whole time while we ate!!Such attitude before we were served the food! We ordered fried chicken biscuits, cheddar waffles, deviled eggs and vegetarian biscuits. Our drinks of Kombucha spritz and Passionfruit bitter drink was good. The food was delicious as well. The only saving grace to what could have been a brilliant sunday brunch had we not been reminded about the 1.5 hours we had to eat before we would we shoved off!!",1,1,2
76,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,4.0,10/1/2017,"We came here at around 7.30 on a Saturday without a reservation. The wait to sit inside was about an hour so after some deliberation (it was a sub 60 evening) we agreed to sit outside rather than try to find somewhere else. In all honesty we probably didn't take full advantage of what was on offer (notably the chicken). But what we did have was really rather good and worth braving the mild outdoor temperatures. I opted for the shrimp and grits, which was really good but ultimately just shrimp and grits. My wife's pork dish was excellent, covered in some sort of green crumb and the meat fell apart easily. The outdoor seating is rather exposed but luckily it was a quiet side street. The seating in general is quite close together. I also found the service quite slow, which may or may not be to your liking. I would have preferred more options on the menu as well - due to allergies I only really had a choice between the shrimp and the chicken. I would probably go back if I could get a seat indoors - mainly to try the chicken but also some of the sides",4,1,

The bacon on the side was crispy and meaty at the same time. Also, with the eggs on top, the waffles tasted very soft and delicious. This is the must menu that everyone has to order!Because I knew this place was a pretty hot place, I picked such a random time to visit. (around 3pm) Thankfully, there was no line and so I did not have to wait at all. So... if you do not want to wait for a long time, I would recommend you to go to this place around​ 3pm or 4pm.",,,

The shrimp and grits: Pretty much the best thing on the their menu. They must have put some magic powder in it because until now I'm still dreaming of this creamy goodness. Delicious! The Mac & Cheese: is pretty good. Nothing amazing. Greens: This paired well with the grits and Mac and cheese. It was definitely more than we expected. **LITTLE YELPERS CLUB**The place is very tight so any strollers of some sort would definitely be a mission to fit in. Great for families.",15,11,17

I asked how long the wait would be for an actual table and was told they were all reserved for the duration of brunch (mind you, it was just before 10:30 and not a single table had been seated). I don't understand restaurants that don't take walk-ins and also can't make accommodations for an overly pregnant woman trying to survive a NYC summer.

80,Peter C.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,110,110,5.0,3/29/2018,"I'm going to say something a little controversial here, that will probably have me hung, drawn and quarter'd through the streets...But Brunch in NYC, is overrated for the most part. It's an excuse for restaurants to hike up their prices and serve mediocre, cheap food (eggs & flour, typically) and hide it under watered down booze. I came to Root & Bone for brunch and got a similar experience...I then came back to Root & Bone for Dinner and was blown awayyyyy!On an evening dine, the place is dimly lit - very relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and a great place to come as a small group. The wait staff are extremely friendly and attentive, and the menu has all the southern classics from Fried Chicken (i'll get to this later), Meat Loaf, Shrimp & Grits to your classic sides of Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens and Stone Ground Grits. As I say, coming here after my brunch experience I was fully expecting a 'meh' kind of dinner; however, walking in with a friend for a long overdue catch up, the food and the setting was the perfect place.We got the Whole Fried Chicken between the two of us, with Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens (and also a Grits on the house, due to them originally bringing us the wrong side - can't complain there!). First off, I need to dedicate a whole paragraph to this delicious bird we got...The Fried Chicken is legit some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. Fried chicken usually leaves me in a grease fulled coma and sitting on the toilet shortly after...This fried chicken made me feel rich, it made me feel authentic, it made me feel gooood. It's lemon dusted and Sweet Tea Brined, and is served with an incredible honey tobasco sauce. It's plump, it's juicy, and it's crisp to the bite, accompanied with some serious blend of flavors with the sweetness of the tea, and the sour of the lemon, to the salt of the bird.The Mac & Cheese was creamy, with a crispy topping, and came in a huge cast iron skillet - this guy was a serious side. The grits & collard greens were also tasty, with chunks of ham hock and a slight bitterness.For two people, in all honesty, this was too much food. I'm a big eater and I was struggling by the end of it. My advice to you would be to prioritize the chicken, and definitely split a whole bird between 2. You can then more than easily split a single side.Boycott Brunch, Treat Yo'Self to Dinner!",2,1,1

The biscuits were delightful tho (skip the chicken jus...again beautiful, inventive 'dip it in the jus then sprinkle it with sesame and salt' presentation but jus adds nothing).  We had Arnold Palmer + bourbon as drinks, which were ok..but a little light on bourbon.

We ended up ordering the chicken and waffles with a side of macaroni and cheese. The mac n cheese was super cheesy and delicious with a nice crust on top. Secondly the chicken was fried perfectly nice and crisp on the exterior and unbelievably juicy on the inside, plus the chicken paired wonderfully with the cheddar waffles. Lastly, we ordered dessert which was a fun play on coffee and donuts, the warm cinnamon sugar donuts worked superb with the coffee flavored ice cream.

85,Caitlin T.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",383,51,64,4.0,3/17/2018,"Decent food, a little overpriced for what you can find elsewhere for lesser. We had the prix fixe menu for roughly $80/pp. It came with four courses. Their biscuits are the best I've ever had. They're warm, dense, and fluffy. They come with a jus that you dip the biscuits in, and herbs on the side. I'd come back here just for their biscuits! My second course was a salad - it was forgettable. It was garnished with pickled onions and bleu cheese. Flavors were intricate - but not cohesive. We shared a baked mac and cheese. This and the biscuits were the best aspects of the meal. The mac and cheese was gooey, flavorful, and hot. It was garnished with breadcrumbs. Added the perfect amount of crunch for variation in texture. My third course was chicken and waffles. The chicken desperately needed seasoning. The waffles were dry - they came with cheddar cheese on them and were garnished with scallions. Great concept, but not executed to its fullest potential. The waffles needed a sweet(er) element. If you've had chicken and waffles before, no need to order them here. They're nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits. The grits were accompanied by corn (traditional); they were flavorful but undercooked, so a little gritty. It came with large shrimp, which was nice. But, again, the shrimp were under and needed seasoning. When I come to a ""Southern"" restaurant, I expect the flavors to be more developed. The last course - dessert - was a blueberry cobbler that was served in a small cast iron with vanilla ice cream. Perfect ending to a dinner. Very delectable, but not too sweet. Our server was also not the most personable. It seemed as if she wanted to take our orders, but not give suggestions about their food. Overall, will return for biscuits!",2,1,1

Updated review","UNACCEPTABLE.  I love going to restaurants where they decide to take out a larger tip from MY bank account than what is written on the receipt.  I find that incredibly unacceptable.  I came here just last week for restaurant week and was so impressed with my food and service. I left a very generous tip in return, obviously.  I'm not sure why, upon looking at my bank account, I see that an additional tip was taken on top of what I already left.  Root & Bone, do better.",10,,1

Comfortable and relax space serving good ol' comfort food. Of all the Restaurant week place we tried I'd have to say Root & Bone was one of the best deals. The usual three choices of appetizer, entre and dessert but that also came with house biscuits and a side of Mac & Cheese. The fried chicken & waffle basket was enough to feed two people. I was crispy and moist. (Good thing we shared the two entrees) The prime rib meatloaf was all tender juice meat. Mac & Cheese was oozing creamy and decadent. The biscuit was flakey, buttery and delicious. I think everything that came on the table was come into my belly goodness.

The biscuits were so buttery and creamy and the deviled eggs were cute and tasty. Then comes the 4 piece fried chicken, also really good, juicy and tender. At this point we were both stuffed and couldn't eat any mote food but there's still the shrimp grits and meatloaf - had a bite and they were also good!

It was worth the wait, the food, the company and the atmosphere was exactly what was needed. I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy entree, the sauce was made to perfection, for anyone who loves sweet gravy sauce, this would be the meal to choose. My group and I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese, it was more than enough food. The chicken was good , I thought it was pretty average but I also feel like you can get that chicken anywhere. The place itself is a very small confined place, it reminded me of a vintage type look or maybe like at my grandmas house because of how unique the plates were. The bathrooms are also really clean for a small restaurant like that. I think they should definitely open up two bathrooms that way people aren't waiting in line.",,,

We were seated within 10 minutes when I arrived. As i was waiting I was tempted by the dessert counter where they had cookies, pies, and banana pudding in a jar.Once we were seated, we scanned the menu and saw the quintessential Southern favorites like fried chicken and biscuits. They have a variety of these dishes with different combos of sides. We both ordered the fried chicken platter with waffles, mac and cheese, and collard greens. It is a lot of food for an average sized Asian girl but I liked how I got to sample a bunch of different items through that dish. The mac and cheese was good but think it would have been better with some Sharp cheddar. The waffles were multigrain, but still fluffy and yummy. The chicken was the highlight of the dish. The skin was seasoned with lemon and some other spices that made it irresistible. The one thing I didn't like were the collard greens. They were so sour that it was hard to eat them without grimacing.I will definitely be back for some more fried chicken and their enticing desserts.",,,

The service and ambiance were great and the Restaurant Week menu was a STEAL (between the two of us we shared over 8 dishes!). But unfortunately, some of the dishes were real disappointments and overshadowed the dishes that we really enjoyed.We started off with complementary biscuits that came with a chicken jus and chunks of sea salt. This was by far the best thing we ate and probably one of the best things I ate all weekend. The biscuits were SO warm and flaky. If you can only get one thing, get the biscuits. I also had the deviled eggs that I really enjoyed!Unfortunately, the remaining dishes were subpar. The tomato salad really left something to be desired. The cucumbers and tomatoes were cut too large and chunky, so it was difficult to eat, and it was lacking real flavor, even with the mustard vinaigrette. We also got the waffle benedict and the fried chicken n waffle sandwich. The yolk in one of my poached eggs was solid, but the lemon hollandaise was superb! The waffles were OK but a little chewy and the fried chicken had melted cheese that had hardened and was difficult to eat. Both dishes came with salads, mine was delicious but my sisters was inedible. They had put WAY too much vinegar in the dressing.We also ate mac n cheese and banana pudding (I know... an absurd amount of food!), both of which were delicious.

They give you biscuits for the table to start off with and then let you chose a main course that is accompanied by mac and cheese and watermelon for the table as well. They then let you chose between banana pudding or key lime for dessert. The biscuits were yummy but nothing insane. The watermelon I found to be extremely refreshing and delicious, topped with onions and jalapenos that complemented the freshness just perfectly. The mac and cheese was also absolutely delicious (heavy but so good). They gave us honey sriracha on the side which mixed extremely well with it. For my main course I went with the chicken and waffle sandwich which was also really delicious and came with these pickled tomatoes that cut the heaviness just right. I opted for the key lime for dessert and it was the cherry on top of a perfect meal.

So good!!We started off with the angel biscuits which were nice simple biscuits that was accompanied by honey roasted chicken jus. It had big chunks of sea salt which was the perfect complement. Overall it was very good, easy to share between 2-3 people. We also shared their side of mac and cheese. Super cheesy with al dente cooked mac. Amazing! It had everything that I look for in a mac and cheese. As for the main entrée, I got the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Had two nice pieces of fried chicken, each on top of a soft waffle.

The complimentary tomato salad was also really good. For my main meal, I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich. Overall I enjoyed it, the chicken was done well, the waffles were also good. My fiance ordered the eggs Benedict. Something about it just really threw me off. I think there was vanilla in the hollandaise, it just ruined it for me. It was like eating dessert. The complimentary Mac and cheese was decent, better than average. For dessert, I ordered the banana pudding, which I was happy with. I wasn't a fan of the key lime pie but if you are, order it.The menu overall if very soul food focused. I would warn you to Pace yourself because it will be very heavy and filling. To be honest, at least for the restaurant week menu, there were not a lot of vegetarian options. One thing I'll say about the food, do not take it to go. It will not hold up very well.

The server's response was ""this is common to have some excess blood along the blood line"". His explanation doesn't make sense, since there should be no blood if you thoroughly cook chicken. His dismissive response was also concerning since someone could get very sick from eating undercooked meat. They did not offer to replace the dish until we prompted them.",,,

These set the bar very high, and unfortunately the rest of the meal fell far, far below. The chicken was crispy on the outside, but very dry on the inside- there was nothing special about the flavor of this ""Sweet Tea Brined"" fried chicken, as the tabasco and whisky syrup came on the side anyways. The waffles were dense and very heavy, and didn't complement the chicken very well. Mac and cheese looked mouthwatering, but didn't deliver much flavor. The melted cheese used to top this and the waffles was literally like plastic- I peeled it off in one piece. The grits were well made, just lacked flavor.

I think the stuffing was delicious and the beet colored egg white was nice to try. For entree, I obviously went for Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich since it's one of my favorite dishes. Honestly, I'd prefer the fried chicken at Sweet Chick (another Southern spot), which is more savory and crunchy. Their buckwheat waffle was perfect tho, so soft and airy inside. My bf didn't order the restaurant week menu because he wanted Shrimp & Grits. Good choice! The sauce is amazing with lots of shrimp, sauteed onions, and corn. Even tho it might be a bit overwhelming to eat the whole dish since the grits are very buttery. This next dish seriously had me at ftw: chilled watermelon with jalapeno, onion, basil and lime vinegarette. You know when you have a watermelon bowl, you put it in the fridge without a lid or a cover when you also have onion or other food in there and the smell transfers to the watermelon? There, that's exactly how it tastes like. I say it's not worth the hype and the constant check for opening slots for days...I don't care if the chef is famous or what I just speak of my honest experience. Maybe I need to come back and try the fried bird bucket?",1,2,

It was my second time coming here for brunch and I enjoyed both times. Food: Biscuits & gravy + egg- two buttermilk biscuits, homemade sausage and gravy. My bf ordered this food & he finished everything. It was creamy & delicious! The bread is warm & fluffy. Root & bone fried chicken half bird $19- tobasco honey on the side. Crispy & tasty! The honey tobasco sauce was perfect! I love regular tobasco sauce then imagine its a little sweet because of the honey. Perfect right? Shrimp & grits $16- melted tomato, corn, picked onion & bacon. This is what I ordered & it was the best grits that I ever had! Each ingredients was delicious! The grits, corn, tomato & shrimp is heaven in my mouth. I'm glad I ordered this. Big portion of food, creamy & tasty! Watermelon- onion, jalapeño & pickled peppers. It was interesting. Its sour & spicy. I love spicy food but never had a spicy watermelon. So if you don't like spicy this is not for you. Perfect brunch, great place & good service!",3,2,5

In my world, good southern food is simple yet amazing.Service was top notch!!",,,
104,Darren J.,"Dover, DE",102,8,0,5.0,7/10/2018,"I went here a while back during restaraunt week. They had amazing Chicken & Waffles. I found there biscuits moist and mouth watering and they are the only place in the city (that I know of) that sells TRUE SWEET TEA. I mean the sweet tea that makes you question whether you will wake up Overdosing from the southern sweetness. Overall, I cannot get over how the food is true southern. The southern style that will put me on Coney Island on a snowy day playing a Darius Rucker and Luke Bryan on my guitar. Definetely made me reminisce on the summers I spent in the south, sipping on sweet tea and eating my grandma's cooking while embracing 80 degree weather on Christmas.

We got the biscuits, which were so delicious, not too sweet, soft and slightly warm. We also got the mac and cheese which IMO was great! We got the basket of chicken which comes with the honey tobasco sauce, the sauce itself was excellent! Coming to the chicken, we felt it was less greasy, and the quality of the chicken was good and the batter was flavorful. Overall a great southern style spot, will come back sometime to check out the brunch.",,,1

110,Dane B.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,104,42,5.0,7/31/2017,Came here during restaurant week. First things first the staff was so nice to squeeze me in at the chefs area for a seat in the middle of a packed brunch hour. I had the deviled eggs which were seasoned and puréed to perfection accompanied by the biscuits for the table. My entree was the Waffle Benedict which came with a side of macaroni (heaven in a bowl) and a medium portioned arugula salad. The eggs weren't too runny and the hollandaise sauce was of great consistency and taste. For dessert I had the banana pudding which was a small but delightful end to a good meal. I willBe back and I will be having the chicken and waffles. The pork that came with the eggs was perfect. Not too salty and not too fatty.,1,,

I have nothing else to say.",3,2,3
112,Jamila C.,"Somerville, NJ",186,249,1148,5.0,6/8/2017,"I am not a bread person, but I tore Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits all the way up and down. It's served as two biscuits, decent sized, on one paddle board. They were so flavorful, soft, buttery inside, and perfectly crusted. The next small plate that hit the table was the Drunken Deviled Eggs. It is indeed a small plate as the eggs were very small, from Brook Farm in Catskills NY. I read somewhere that small eggs often taste better than the more commonly purchased larger eggs, so maybe that has something to do with their decision. Maybe it was for presentation. All I know is they were deliciously pickled and made for a perfect appetizer.I also ordered the buckwheat cheddar waffles, served with bourbon maple syrup. I've read in other reviews that the waffles were small. They were. There were four on the plate, which was more than enough for me, and tasted very different from any waffle I've ever had in the past. I loved every bite but couldn't finish the last one. I took it home, along with a few other items, and it tasted almost as good as when I ordered them. Nothing beats eating food fresh from the kitchen. I don't generally like syrup, but I couldn't resist the bourbon maple syrup. What is this place? Some sort of sorcery, I'm sure.The fried chicken and macaroni n' cheese completed my main meal. I thought the chicken was pretty good. I would have liked the skin to be a bit crispier, but it was cooked well, juicy, and served hot. The mac n ' cheese wasn't bad, but I would've like if they seasoned it more within the dish rather than seemingly just on the top. It was a big serving for a side and I thought more of a shareable item. Now at this point, I am freaking stuffed and expressing out loud how it isn't possible for me to eat any more. The server, who was very attentive throughout our dinner, came back to the table to ask if we were interested in looking at the dessert menu. Um, yes please : )Ok, here's the last of my review: The key lime pie is served in the tiniest glass jar but was well layered and just what I needed before leaving. I love key lime pie, so I'm glad I wasn't disappointed. So so so tasty, perfectly sweetened. And they have ginger beer as a beverage option which bumps them all the way up in my book!I would absolutely come back, with seats reserved. I would probably stay away from visiting on a Saturday or early Sunday. It's a tiny restaurant, as a lot of NY restaurants are. Our table was small, but our server and the kitchen did an excellent job pacing the food so that our table was never overwhelmed with plates. Great service, great food, nice restaurant, and the parking was easy on this particular late Sunday afternoon. I would absolutely come back.",10,3,6
113,Sa S.,"Greenwich, CT",1,12,5,2.0,2/2/2018,"Service nice. Food not so. Fried chicken leg was cold. Waffles no flavors . Eggs were perfect but heavy sauce without salt or peppar, (added salt to finish). For the table were the best biscuits, delicious. The green salad was strange, with a bit green sauce that was a bit spicy (!!?). Deviled eggs were fine but very tiny , guess there's perfectly fine for an appetizer. Desserts were too sweet for us but ok if you like sweets. Also table were too small to fit all the food plates. Decorations were nice and cozy, felt it would suit a coffee shop more than a busy restaurant.I'd want to come back for biscuits but probably would be stared at, so I guess not coming back soon.",1,,
114,Kaley R.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,237,317,4.0,8/11/2017,"It's not often that a meal leaves me speechless, but at least half of the restaurant week menu items had me literally pausing, savoring, and gesturing to my boyfriend how amazingly good it was. (As he eats the same thing and gestures back, yeah I'm eating it too?¿?¿ He doesn't understand.)The Restaurant Week brunch is $29 per person. You get biscuits for the table, an appetizer, mac n cheese and watermelon for the table, a main dish and a dessert. So. much. food. The deviled eggs for the appetizer might be the actual best thing I had. Who knew? Highly recommend. The dill and potato skin crisp thing on top really round them out. And the biscuits... oh my goodness, they transport me right back to the south but add a twist that I've never in my 22 years of living in Alabama had. If you don't go for restaurant week, you still MUST get these.Our main dishes were the chicken and waffles and the biscuits and gravy because, duh, more biscuits and more carbs. The chicken was cooked perfectly - not too overly crispy, not at all greasy, and a thick piece of chicken, exactly how I like it. The banana pudding wasn't my favorite (Alabama still wins there) but it was still solidly good. The key lime pie dessert was really tart but actually really good.The presentation for every single dish was beautiful. I love a place that truly cares about putting out great dishes that look just as good before eating them.Root & Bone was basically completely booked on Open Table, but my psychotic stalking of the open times led me to finding an opening randomly one Sunday. But, upon arrival on Sunday at 10:30, half the parties in line didn't have reservations and there were plenty of open tables so, if you're in the area give it a try even if you don't have a reservation!Lastly... I would have probably given this place 5 stars if the hostesses hadn't been so rude to us when we said we didn't want to sit outside at the table by the dumpster with the 20 flies all over it.

Yes, you didn't read that wrong, fried chicken for brunch.Their menu for brunches weren't amazing, it felt like being in fancy Popeyes with a more expensive price tag. Anyways we ordered their most popular dish, the mac & cheese was amazing!! We loved it!! The waffle was good, but the fried chicken was subpar, I prefer Popeyes chicken. Waitress was friendly but not so attentive cause it's super busy but didn't really mind at all. I definitely won't come back here though.",,,

I was expecting more authentic southern food with the heftiness and heartiness of large portions and thick chicken and waffles. I was a little disappointed when I didn't find that unhealth I had been anticipating, but still happy with finding the colorful options and filling but not overwhelming portions. The interior was beautiful and the ambiance was cute. We came for restaurant week brunch ($29) and also got the tomato toast ($13). The deviled eggs were interesting and adorable, the biscuit was nice and moist, and the watermelon was quite interesting. The mac and cheese had a good mixture of texture, a bit on the salty side though. My friend got the chicken and waffle sandwich, which paired well with their whiskey honey, and was actually pretty good to taste. The spread on my tomato toast was really tasty, smooth, creamy and a good compliment to the crunch of the tomato. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming, although we didn't have a reservation. I did try to take pictures of the whole place, but the server on the reservation section stopped me from walking in as soon as I tried, redirecting me to the small bathroom thinking I was confused.A cute experience. Filling yet not feeling bloated and heavy. I would recommend it for the beautiful plating and the ambiance!",,,

I came at 2pm with a friend and luckily we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. You're basically sitting elbow to elbow with the tables next to you, so it's not really a great place for big parties and whatnot. We ordered the drunken deviled eggs, the half bird to share, buckwheat waffles and a side of Mac and cheese and collars greens. The drunken deviled eggs were pretty too look at and pretty good but I'm not really sure if it's worth it cause of its portion size. The eggs were a bit on the saltier side though. The buckwheat waffles were my favorite! I liked how fluffy and thick the waffles were! The Mac and cheese was delicious. It was crusted with biscuit and thyme on the top and complemented the Mac and cheese very well!  The chicken was moist and very flavorful. I loved how it was crunchy and crispy on the outside but still very juicy inside.

Would highly recommend going for lunch because of a) no wait and b) lunch specials! I convinced my friend to get a side of biscuits and gravy because how can you go to a Southern comfort food restaurant without this carb-filled treat? We both got the poached eggs on waffle.

121,Anna I.,"Staten Island, NY",136,83,60,5.0,11/18/2017,"This was one of the best meals I've had...all month? All year? I don't think I'm exaggerating. My friend and I came here per her suggestion when I said I wanted to eat comfort food. She lives in the area and has been dozens of times, and now I understand why.We started with cocktails; they're pricey, which sucks, but no different than most Manhattan restaurants. We both tried the winter seasonal ""Long Winter's Nap"" and oh...my god. It's made with apple brandy and maple syrup, and it was perfect. I'm usually not a brandy fan, but I may be now. I wanted maybe 12 of them, but I went with one because it set me back $15.For food, we went with the family style for the two of us. It's $40 pp which you may balk at but listen: it's three courses, multiple options in each course, and seasonal desserts. You can look up everything you get but trust, if no one in your party has dietary restrictions (this isn't for vegan folk), you. must. do it. If you want three courses anyway, your meal will probably come out to more $ per person and you won't have all the amazing options you do. You get so much food, I didn't even finish my main course (which never happens...ever). The seasonal desserts were pumpkin cheesecake and a chocolate mousse. I don't want to be extra and say they were life changing, but...they were. They sell the individual jars of dessert out front; I may need to go back just to pick some up. If nothing else, it'll tide me over until the next time I come for dinner (which will probably be soon).",4,3,2
122,Lily L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",362,40,42,1.0,5/21/2018,"Came here 15minutes before they opened for supper and the girl at the register said she could not sit me and my boyfriend until 5pm. Had to ask her three times if I could sit on the chairs outside and wait, until she gave me a direct answer that was impolite, ""you can sit on the benches that's about it"". When it hit 5pm, all she did was make eye contact with my boyfriend and did not come out to seat us until another party came and asked to be seated. The server who took our order was kind. We got the half fried chicken with cheddar waffles and mac n cheese. The fried chicken is definitely better than any I have tasted, but the waffles and Mac n cheese were mediocre, nothing special, especially the waffles. For a place that is known for their chicken and waffles, I would expect at least some taste to it, but nope, not in this case. The cheddar waffles were bland and tasteless. The server who I asked for the check and takeout box was nasty. She rolled her eyes and walked away. I said thank you when she handed me the boxes, when she came back with the check, when I handed her my card with the check, and after she gave me my card and check back. She did not bother to acknowledge me during any of those four rounds where came back to by table in under a 5 minute span, but simply said ""ok"" while taking our cups away after she handed me back my card and bill.I do not care how good your fried chicken taste, if you can not provide at least a half decent service. Why become a server if you are unable to carry around customary mannerisms? I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want to be treated as anything less than a human being.",5,2,

I didn't make reservations (although I strongly suggest u do especially for brunch since the place is so small) and surprisingly didn't have to wait long. We walked in and were told the wait would be 90 minutes (luckily I anticipated a wait so no biggie) and they would text me when the table was ready. We waited all of 30 minutes before they texted us (I assume this was my birthday gift, thanks :)). The restaurant is very small so we were seated along the window (which had amazing selfie lighting btw) which I thought would be a little awkward but seeing how close the regular tables were I was happy for the seating choice. Hands down the BEST BISCUITS I've ever eaten. So buttery and amazing. Def a must try. I had the biscuits and gravy (prepare yourself for a very healthy portion of gravy over the biscuits) which was great too. The Mac and cheese was heavenly along with the fried chicken.

The food was solid from start to finish with a couple of dishes like the squash and pork shoulder having really strong flavor profiles.  The pork shoulder, slow cooked and served with collard greens, really stood out for me but I haven't seen it on their online menu since.

The Lobster Tail was hard as rubber and I wish they would have left it in its shell. The potato was not soft at all. The andouille sausage was so good though. I don't think I'll be ordering that again. (Shrugs Shoulders) Hence the minus one star. I guess their staple is the chicken and biscuits. The service was nice and attentive.

127,Alex S.,"Orem, UT",273,399,516,5.0,5/5/2017,"Well, this is a really tough review for me. Tough because I cannot decide between a 4 and a 5. I just kept energizer bunny'ing this place (eating and eating and eating). If someone doesn't get that reference feel free to stop reading anything I write you might be too young.I would do my normal breakdown by each individual item, but this place has produced the best single bite of any place in new york and here is a replay on how that all went down:Quarter piece of the cheddar waffle, fried chicken, spicy sauce, bourbon syrup, mac n cheese and a little bit of ribs. O to the M to the G this place took my taste buds on a journey any tongue would be jealous of. Waffle isn't too dense with delicious cheddar on top for sweet and savory delight. Chicken is so juicy and has all the essential spices (and essential oils I guess). Mac N cheese is well baked, with just enough ooey gooey cheese the make you feel at home. The ribs added a little back country flare. And last but not least the spicy sauce gave it an awesome kick and the syrup cooled your mouth down right after. Each part alone was delicious each part together, unstoppable.Also, had some cole slaw which had a great amount of ginger to take you far east, and some desserts; key lime pie, which was the right color and the right tartness. Donuts and coffee... which is a misnomer... donuts and coffee ice cream. Tasted like a churro with a little more fluff. The perfect end to a perfect first day.THE VERDICT:I still don't know what to give it!! I haven't given a five star in a while because they are so sacred and feel like people have higher expectations of places I give five stars. (That's my ego talking). However, I can get around the ""as good as it gets"" because it might just be as good as it gets for a combination bite. Best bite I may have ever had in my vida. Alright... I am pulling this trigger on this one... going 5. Although you already know that because it says it up above.. Spoiler alert. Trust me writing this end was way more exciting than reading it.

We were seated at the bar by the window and told the tables behind us were reserved. LOL WHAT?!? Didn't the guy on the phone two hours ago tell me they don't take brunch reservations? That's why I came in an hour before my friends arrived to put my name down. Ok, fine. Knock one star down. (Oh and if you're gonna tell me it was a 4-top table so they can't seat three people, the people that seated who apparently ""reserved"" a table was a 3 party ""reservation."" )  I'm still bitter.

So allegedly the fried chicken here is SOOOO good. I had high expectations walking in and left feeling whatever. The chicken wasn't melt in your mouth worthy, nor was it finger lickin' good. In fact, one drumstick looked like it was OVER deep fried or just plain out OLD and REFRIED! The chicken was so dry and inedible, I took one bite. (Refer to photo.) The Buckwheat Cheddar Waffle was too thick for my liking but at least it wasn't dry! And my friend seemed to kinda like it? Biscuits and Gravy were pretty solid. The only dish all my friends agreed was TOO good! Bonuts should not be a thing outside this restaurant because it's a heart attack and then some. Fried biscuit covered in sugar. IT LIVES. WAS IT GOOD? yeah! But was too full to even get past two bites and it's WAY too heavy for a meal like the one we devoured. Overall not terrible yet not great.

J and I rolled in around 2 on a Tuesday and it was just us and one other couple. Small place,  to be honest not sure I'd like it packed... the two tops were awful close to each other. The decor and ambience is adorable.   Absolutely well done in crafting this dining experience. The food was amazing... and I can say amazing because Picky Pete was raving over it.. and he raves over nothing. We got:Classic biscuits.  Comes with two,  with crisp tops and tender interior,  paired with flaky salt,  seeds,  and a chicken honey jus that I literally dipped my finger in once I ran out of biscuit.  (Can't take me anywhere.....)Short rib meatloaf,  served with a potato pancake and eggs.  This meatloaf is....I don't have an adjective.  It's not your mom's meatloaf.  It's shredded short rib, rich,  fatty, and perfect.   The eggs are a throwaway... they were well executed but what's the point.   The mashed potato cake was buttery and very nice. J got the fried chicken,  with collards and Mac and cheese. The fried chicken was tender,  well fried,  but not as hot as he woulda liked.  The Mac and cheese is extremely well done- creamy,  complex,  and precious in its little cast iron.   The collards were good,  but not the best I've had.  They were still a bit al dente for my liking.   But again,  very decent.  Oh, and fresh lemonade! Tart and very good.  Biscuits, one drink,  two entrees and very full bellies- $61 before tip. Worth it.",1,1,1

I made reservations but because of the outstanding weather, I opt to wait a bit for an outside table. The staff was ultra nice and accommodated my request, even when I wanted to switch tables for an open end seat. I want to point out that I had the Arnold Palmer with Bourbon and it was well balanced and definitely worth the $12.  It was so good, I ordered two.  I then indulged in the fried chicken, waffles with mac & cheese which was served with  watermelon slices.  The chicken was cooked perfectly crisp, seasoned and I loved the lemon zest sprinkled on them. The mac & chesse was awesome...pasta cooked perfect. Every bit worth the $19.  I gave five stars because the sun was aligned with the moon and stars. This establishment provided a perfect brunch experience...Thank you!",,,
135,Leslie Y.,"Cary, NC",32,135,152,3.0,10/22/2017,"As 2 Southerners living in NYC, sometimes, you just really want some Fried Chicken. My husband and I ventured here after a lot of research that I did about Southern food here in the city. I was really hankering for some fried chicken (this happens a lot), and the place looked cute for a date night! I just loved the ambiance there. Gorgeous restaurant and outdoor seating, complete with mason jars and the cutest plates. For 2 people, we ordered half a bird for the fried chicken, Grandma's biscuits and the mac and cheese. (This is enough food!) Our waiter told us most people over order...and that's probably because the prices are really reasonable so maybe people don't think they get as much food as they do? The sweet tea was ok, nothing spectacular here. Biscuits - Mmm they were so good! My favorite thing about our meal. Not too buttery, nice crisp on the top.Fried Chicken - So, if you like sweet meat, you will like this fried chicken. I'm used to more of a cajun type, so this was a little jarring for me. This is because they use a sweet tea marinade, so I think it was good, just not for me because the sweetness really came through. It came out hot, but not piping and could have been crispier in my opinion.Mac and Cheese- ok. VERY cheesy with cavatappi pasta. In summary, I think the place really shines in it's decor and the feel that you get as it's super romantic. The food for me didn't shine as much as the restaurant, so we were a bit disappointed. Portion sizes were great for the price. Service was great here. No wait on a Friday night for us to sit inside (a wait for outside though).",6,1,2

The fried chicken was moist and tender, and the biscuit was perfectly buttery. However, the jelly spread was too sweet.

We had tons leftover. That included the drunken deviled egg, biscuits and sweet potato salad in the first course. The group picked the biscuits as the winner of that round. Second course is the fried chicken, Mac and cheese, collared greens and waffles. Waffles were a little dry even with the syrup. That would be my only complaint though because all else was very yummy. Mac and Cheese was the winner of that round. Finally for dessert we got these little cakes that my friend said tasted like ""Christmas"" and a play on a apple pie or crumble in a mason jar. The apple dessert was the winner of the final round. Overall super fun with a group (unless you can't a lot of grease in your stomach) and the waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly.",2,1,1

141,Celeste B.,"New York, NY",241,514,946,4.0,1/3/2018,"I visited this restaurant during Restaurant Week with a few friends from work.Overall, the restaurant is pretty small but they make good use of the space that they have. The décor was very homey and country kitchen styled. The mismatched dishes used also kept in line with the country homey feel. If you want to have dinner I definitely advise you to make reservations but they always seem to be crowded.To start for drinks we had the spiked peach ice tea which was very good but not apart of their usual menu from what I observed. Not too strong or weak. For appetizers we ordered the drunken deviled eggs which looked almost too pretty to eat and grandma daisy's angel biscuits. The eggs were pretty but we definitely eat every last one. The eggs were delicious but I definitely expected more of the biscuits. With a name like that I expected the biscuits to be the lightest and flakiest biscuits I had ever eaten but they weren't. The biscuits were good but I wouldn't order them again. My friends ordered the fried chicken while I had the meatloaf big mistake. In my opinion the meatloaf was a bit dry and I wouldn't order it again. Or maybe I felt that way because I did get to try the fried chicken. The fried chicken is definitely their specialty and a must try if you ever visit this restaurant. The chicken was very flavorful and fried to perfection. I loved the chicken so much that I neglected the food I ordered and placed an order for the fried chicken to go. It was even more flavorful the next day in my opinion. I would definitely return to this restaurant in the future but I will stick to their specialty dish next time.",,,

143,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,5.0,10/9/2017,"TL;DR (and a mandate) - I had one of the most delicious meals of 2017 at Root & Bone this past weekend. You MUST go and order the biscuits, the fried chicken, the squash and the collard greens.Your belly will thank you and your taste buds will have a party.- Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits: These were soft and buttery on the inside with that crumbly and golden texture on the outside. I am a biscuit fiend, and I could order 3 more dishes of this and go to town. - Squash Salad: Ummm, pickled garlic vinaigrette, lemon AND guajillo pepper? YES PLEASE. This combination is BOMB. Not only do you get that satisfaction you can't get from anything else but garlic, but you also get the spice from the pepper and the acid from the lemon. The squash is such a perfect vehicle to soak up all those juices. I mean, I am salivating over squash here. It is THAT good. - Root & Bone fried chicken: We ordered the half-chicken. It came with one leg, one thigh, one breast and one wing. Absolutely juicy - the long hours of care by that sweet tea brine definitely shows. I was blown away by how all that juicy chicken could be encased in the most perfectly crispy breading. It's more oven-baked than fried, but just as satisfying. I loved the spices in it (lemon and spiked tobasco honey) to give it a tangy, sweet and spicy balance. Korean fried chicken is my favorite type of chicken, but this one actually nudges it out! - Collard Greens with bacon, chipotle & cider vinegar. Yes, you guessed it - best collard greens I have ever had. I usually find collard greens to be one-note and uneventful, but this was a bright dish that complemented every other dish.I plan on returning many times over and bringing my out-of-town guests here for such a delicious meal!FYI - my fiance and I are big foodies and have big appetites, but the above 4 dishes definitely put me in a food coma not long after!",29,14,23

When we called to check on the wait she so rudely informed us that there was a differentiation between the wait list and a reservation list. When we finally showed up for our ""wait list"" reservation we were greeted with less than welcoming behavior. The wait staff acted as if they were doing us a favor to have us eat at a mediocre fried chicken joint. When we got seated they seated us at the bar next to the door on a colder Saturday in New York City so I asked our waiter, who in fact never checked on us during our meal, if we could move to a table.

I like the pickle the best--sweet and sour.  The onion and red pepper strips are sweet and tasty as well. The biscuit has a honey glaze on top.  It is good.The chicken to me is so so.  Light coating and not oily, but lacked taste.  I think we are supposed to use the sauce they provide.  A mustard sauce and a sweet and sour sauce.  The chicken is the frozen variety that most Americans only have access to.  Well, I can tell you as a fact...the chickens that are processed the same day and never frozen are the best.  They are juicier and softer to bite into.  We have that in LA Chinese area.  There are shops with chickens that are just processed before minutes of the sale.  The local Chinese restaurants serve these chickens, and this makes a huge difference.  You have to taste it for yourself.  No word can reproduce the experience.The service was very good, and there is a bonus star for this place.  Their sugar cookies have sprinkles and grind almonds.  I can not taste the almond, but this is one of the best sugar cookie that I have in my life, so that is a plus for the establishment.All in all, not a bad place, but it is simply over hype and over price for what they offer.",5,3,3

Updated review","Visited during Restaurant Week '18 -Fairly enjoyed the appetizer & entree. Appetizer of Caesar salad was very delicious along with the homemade biscuits served with dipping sauce was really good. The shrimp and grits entree was okay- grits were a little too grainy & I'm not a seafood lover {anymore} so shrimp is never an option for me- the gravy was good. That option was clearly for someone else but I tasted it lol. The chicken & waffles was also just okay. The waffles were bland (to me), chicken was good but the way it was served may it difficult to eat in combination (chicken& waffles).. also a side of Mac n Cheese was ordered and I did not like that neither. The chocolate pudding dessert wasn't gratifying to me. Just bland once again. Cocktails were tasty  and the staff were very pleasant/attentive. That's how this post earned 3stars. I will probably visit again and try something else.",,,

The service was very polite and attentive throughout our entire experience.My girlfriend and I started off with the deviled eggs. Then we had the sticky buns. The buns were sweet, warm, and soft. I'd highly recommend both. For our main course we shared the chicken and three which consisted of fried chicken, baked mac & cheese, spicy collard greens, and waffles.

I opted for the beekeeper and the fiance got a refreshing mojito type drink - both beverages were excellent.To start we tried the deviled eggs. Don't be fooled, these aren't your grandma's old buffet standbys - these were amazing. The egg whites were infused with beets, and the creamy yolks were bursting with fresh dill flavour. Loved the crispy piece of potato chip on top - YUM!We normally never order the same item when we go out but the table next to us ordered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich so we both decided we had to have it.Chicken arrived super crispy and tender, so so good.

The fried chicken is a solid four stars I'd say. I prefer crispier skin and this fried chicken lacked enough crisp for me personally, especially on the breast pieces. The legs were far better. The waffles were super average so I'd give it three stars. Relatively soft and tasty waffles but the cheese on top was weird. It was like they simply meted packaged cheese slices on top of the waffle. Didn't improve upon the waffle. The star of my meal was actually the bonuts appetizer. The texture of the biscuit donut fusion was so soft and fluffy. And tasted great with the sugary dipping sauce. Definitely a unique dish that I'd recommend trying! Service was pretty disappointing. Our waiter was really nice, but he did forget my cold brew until I had to ask again halfway through my meal. To be fair, he basically had to wait on all the outside tables on his own.

They did take and honor our reservation even though I was late coming from work. I was a little disappointed the hostess wanted no part of me charging my phone in the restaurant. I cant blame someone for my own dis-organization. On to the important stuff, the food was phenomenal all around.  Starting with the ""Kilt"" salad, which seemed to be loaded with antioxidants and other ingredients that were used instead of iodized (table) salt to provide flavor. The Little Gem salad on the table next to me looked amazing. After a deal to share the Brisket Meatloff and Shrimp & Grits fell through, I was forced and fortunate enough to try the Fried Chicken. It wouldn't be fair to write a review of this spot without doing so. The chicken is perfectly breaded, cooked and seasoned. My Dad confirmed that it was the way Southern Fried Chicken is supposed to be. The shrimp & grits was loaded with seafood, bacon and taste. The Cauliflower Risotto was right on, I enjoyed the peas and carrots in there. This dish is Gluten Free and Vegan approved.

Firstly I love the vibe here- so quaint and southern and homey but still city chic. Very into the decor... the mix matched plates and the variety of glass bottles and mason jars for beverages really give me all the feels. The food also gives me the feel- great spot for COMFORT food- this is not the place to go while on a diet (unless you're looking to break your diet of course). Every time I've come her I try something new. Last time I had the shrimp and grits (it was to die for- seriously so perfect). The biscuit starter or the waffles and cheese starter- A*. I love their no alcohol beverages... very refreshing I usually go for whatever funky lemonade they have it's not too sweet. This time I was in a breakfasty mood so I got one of the classics... fried chicken with waffles, Mac and cheese, collard greens, and a side of over easy eggs. My friend and I rolled out of there as you can imagine... I also had a cold brew. My friend got the Mr. Q with fried chicken. If you can't tell the fried chicken is certainly a must... they also have these infused side sauces that are everything- whiskey infused honey and Tabasco infused honey... it's amazing on the chicken... actually amazing on everything there.

Starting with the meatloaf; it had a nice char on the outside but personally it  was a bit dry for my taste. Everything else from the char carrots and potatoes were fine.

It was in NoHo so we decided to park our car in Chinatown and ride the train to the restaurant. We had to walk about half a mile because of some late train schedules but it was worth the extra cardio. I was smart enough to make reservations the day before because when we finished, the wait for a table was at least an hour and knowing my husband, he would not wait. Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated right away. This place was tight with cafe style tables and chairs and everyone sitting closely together. It gave off a very quaint vibe with country like decorations all over the restaurant, which was also reflected in the cups.  After all that walking, my husband and I decided to order a whole fried bucket of bird (chicken, same thing) with a side of buckwheat cheddar waffles. The food came out fairly quick along with Tabasco hot sauce for the chicken and maple whiskey syrup for the waffles. The chicken tasted amazing, crispy, full of flavor and very moist in your mouth even without any sauces. My only complaint is the 2 large pieces of breasts (that I dislike but had to eat it anyway), if only you were able to choose the type of meat you wanted (dark meat please). As you all know, white meat chicken is bland and often dry. The waffles were equally as amazing with some melted cheddar cheese and chopped scallion on top. We will surely be back again whenever I have a chicken and waffle craving.",7,4,8

I won't come here again for a while, as there are just better alternatives for fried chicken in the city.",1,,

172,Phillip T.,"New Bedford, MA",44,80,74,4.0,4/26/2018,"My girlfriend was recently craving fried chicken, but good fried chicken.  Not greasy fast food fried chicken(which to be honest is still amazing haha)so we decided to stop by for dinner.  We were here on a Tuesday night and it was packed!  We had mad reservations so it was fine.  She wanted to sit at the window bar table area. We started off with some ciders while tying to figure out what we wanted, which was everything!  Everything sounded so good and by chance you can order what they call Family Supper.  It comes family style and it's essentially a taste of all the staples on the menu.  Soon the seasonal salad came out alone with some deviled eggs and the amazing biscuits and gravy.  We quickly devoured that and were in heaven. Everything was perfect. Then came the fried chicken, buttermilk cheese waffles, collard AND Mac and cheese.  We definitely ate with our eyes and not our stomachs as this turned out to be quite the meal!  We almost finished it all though!  Normally I'm not a Mac and cheese guy but this was nice and gooey and crispy on top.  The waffles went perfect with the absolutely stunning fried chicken. I've been thinking about it since. The collards, well, we aren't huge fans of collards but the little I had did taste good.  All in all it was a great experience, a little tight on the restaurant but hey, it's New York City.  For the price and quantity of food and quality of service.  This will be repeated.",,,
173,Sam S.,"New York, NY",255,73,6,5.0,10/23/2017,"What a cute little place! My girlfriend and I went here on a Monday that happily coincided with happy hour. The decor here is amazing; you feel like you are just eating in someone's home in the South. The food is James Beard worthy. The Amarillo plantains and bacon was loaded with flavor (at 3 dollars per!) and the Grandma's Biscuit with chicken jus melted in your mouth. We split a half bird and the mac n cheese. This was MORE than enough food. Again, it all was delicious. The service was fast and wonderful. I would recommend this restaurant to absolutely anyone, and the price cannot be beat.",,,
174,seray s.,"New York, NY",2,4,0,3.0,5/28/2018,"Amazing biscuits but disappointing fried chicken.The fried chicken I had was chewy and didn't cook through. The meat tasted plain and old. The first I told them about it and they were nice enough to bring me another fried chicken. The second one was much better but the meat still tasted old. I asked my friend to take a bite to be fair, and she said the same thing. Such a disappointment, considering how much time we waited online and the server was not even nice at the front reception. If you want to go there, order anything but fried chicken, then you will still enjoy this place.",,,
175,Darrae B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",65,18,5,4.0,9/4/2018,"Food was delicious and filling. We both got the biscuits and gravy with eggs. My husband also got a piece of fried chicken. Everything tasted great. The mimosas were on point! It was a bit pricey for brunch, but it's NYC.",,,

After I ordered the risotto, the waitress asked if I was a vegan. Although I'm not a vegan and I honestly just prefer vegetable based dishes, I appreciate her asking. It showed that her and the waitstaff care about their customers and the quality of their service. I also got the angel biscuits, which were phenomenal. They had a perfect texture and were the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I'd recommend those biscuits any day.If I lived closer to the city, I could definitely see myself coming back here more often.",1,,
177,Caroline K.,"Queens, NY",329,432,37,4.0,8/11/2017,"The biscuits and sausage gravy with the side of fried chicken is solid.  They give you a huge portion and I left a lot on my plate behind because the gravy became too rich.  But other than that, I loooooved it.  It was DELICIOUS.  Make sure you dip that chicken into that sausage gravy and finish it clean.  I was in euphoria eating it like a fatass.Their collard greens and mac & cheese are the BOMB DOT COM.I liked that we got to sit outside for our brunch, because the inside seemed a bit cramped and too busy.It gets super packed during weekend brunch hours (not surprised) and they don't take reservations, so your best bet is to get here as soon as they open.We both agreed the girl busing our tables seemed to have a 'tude though, like she couldn't be bothered to do her job.  But all the other serving girls were friendly and helpful, so everything was okay in the end.",3,1,2

We sat at the bar because the place was packed to the brim when we came in and when we left.The half-bird chicken basket (4 pieces) and one or two sides is plenty for two. Skip the mac n cheese. Get the grits. Definitely order drinks to wash down all that artery-clogging Southern goodness. Be nice to the bartender (he might give you a free dessert.) IMO the food is superior to the nearby Sweet Chick's, where service was faster but the chicken dry and unremarkable.The place is small and tables are hard to come by so reserve before you go if you're dining during prime dinner hours.",,,

The food was incredible; my friend and I shared the fried oysters (so tender and salty), the shrimp & grits (extremely creamy grits!), the fried chicken and the mac and cheese. Everything was incredible. Seeing Cheerwine on the menu was also great- mixes will with bourbon. Will definitely be returning on non-restaurant week hours. Very polite and helpful staff as well!",1,,
180,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4793,4.0,1/23/2017,"Wowza! I'm not sure where to begin. First. Lets talk about the chicken. I've been to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in LA. They serve a large waffle with perfectly cooked large pieces of fried chicken.Son, this is the lower east side hipster hive!The brunch size Fried Chicken & Waffle sandwich, even thought the waffles at first glance looks small, this is a right size food portion. I'm trying to compare this dish to a deconstructed candy bar. When the dish was served to me, I separated the items and started:The Chicken: Lightly breaded, juicy and flavorful. I cut pieces of the chicken topped with melted cheddar along with the pickled green tomatoes made this dish a nice entree.The sides: Mac & Cheese and Collard GreensThe Mac & Cheese is heavenly! I hate when M&C is brought to you and it gets all gloppy. Or its all watery and fake tasting. Not here at Root & Bone. The M&C was a nice cheesy blend and the macaroni was cooked just right. Taking a bite of chicken, then some M&C, then a piece of collard greens, made this a very tasty meal.The deviled eggs:Everyone makes them, its simple. But to have a talented chef put their spin on the dish? I was given two, I could have eaten 10.I now have left the two small Belgium sandwich waffles. I'm like a kid when I eat pancakes or waffles, I like to drown them in syrup. The waiter brought to the table a maple-bourbon syrup. Cool! To get the syrup out, it poured like a small hot sauce bottle. I had to keep shaking it and drops would come out! I shook that bottle until I had the right amount of syrup to enjoy my waffles.I also had a bourbon cocktail but I forget the name, it tied it all together and made everything enjoyable.Finally dessert. I had a small jar of Key Lime Pie. Not a slice, but in a cool jar. Small but somehow just the right amount.If you really want to come here but can't get a reservation, there's a small chefs table. You can get a single seat, try the amazing chicken and bolt out. Root & Bone, I had a very nice meal here. From the wait staff to the chicken & waffles, nothing but rave reviews from me.",24,13,24
181,Alex S.,"Manhattan, NY",173,88,44,5.0,2/4/2017,"Came to root and bone for restaurant week (winter '17) and couldn't be more impressed. We made a reservation on open table for 6:30 on a Friday night and when we got there at 6:20 and the place was packed I had low expectations but, to my surprise we were seated right away! This is one of the better restaurant week deals I've had because, for the same $42 it comes with an appetizer, a main, 2 sides for the table, a desert AND a cocktail. For our app we got the biscuits which were some of the best I've ever had. They were warms and flavorful, the chicken au Kk really added a unique taste. For my main, I obviously got the chicken and waffles which lived up to my expectations and I highly recommend and went well with the sides for the table (Sweet potato and Mac n' cheese). And finally, for desert I got the chocolate mouse which was a perfect way to end the meal",3,1,
182,Kirk C.,"Dallas, TX",0,6,0,4.0,9/5/2018,"Root & Bone was one of the restaurants we specifically wanted to eat at during our recent trip to New York, and it did NOT disappoint. My partner is a big fan of Food Network and wanted to try it since he had seen the chefs on a show, and their food was soooo good. We had Grandma Daisy's angel biscuits as an appetizer -- the biscuits were great, but I should have had butter and jam instead of the chicken honey au jus -- wasn't a fan. However, our entrees were terrific. My partner had the chicken and 3, and had mac and cheese, watermelon, and the waffles with the bourbon maple syrup (I almost fought him over that side). He said the chicken had a great batter but that the meat was a touch dry. He also ordered a side of grits, and I almost fought with him over those as well -- the pimento cheese topping was a surprise and a huge hit. I had the toasted tomato sandwich with applewood bacon; even though I'm not a big tomato fan, the sandwich sounded delicious, and it was -- big slices of heirloom tomatoes on grilled sourdough bread with aioli. I also had the chilled watermelon, and it was delicious -- not sure if it was sea salt or toasted sesame, but the topping was great. The location is kind of hell and gone from where we stayed in Chelsea, but well worth the trip.",,,

I unfortunately ordered the 'meatloaf' which was dry and underwhelming but everything else we ordered was great. I think next time I will get the chicken biscuits. Seating was tight but we got in within 15 min without a reservation for Sunday brunch. We ended up being sat at the kitchen counter but the food was well worth it.",,,
186,Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",269,745,79,4.0,8/20/2017,"I have had Root & Bone on my list for YEARS and was thrilled to finally be able to come try it during Restaurant Week this year. Reservations are hard to come by so definitely plan far in advance, especially for larger groups. The space itself is TINY and can definitely get a little loud, but once you look past that, the food is definitely worth the visit. The ambiance is rustic and homey, which is very cute. Service here is very attentive though the hostesses can be a little distracted during prime busy hours. For Restaurant Week, we started with Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits - holy cow these were the best biscuits I think I've ever had. They were warm and flaky, fresh from the oven, and the honey roasted chicken jus was out of this world. I could have made a meal out of just these biscuits. None of us were particularly fond of our appetizers - the drunken deviled eggs, but I was never really a deviled eggs fan anyways. The star, obviously, was the chicken and waffles. You get your choice of dark or white meat, but it all comes out freshly fried and DELICIOUS. I thought the portion was really generous and I was stuffed at the end of the meal. The honey tabasco and whiskey/bourbon? syrup are amazing to add but the seasoning was perfect on its own. My fiance was the only one who didn't order the chicken and waffles, opting for the short rib meatloaf instead, which he loved. The meat was really juicy, cooked perfectly, and tasted like the epitome of comfort food. The mac and cheese and platter of watermelon (with key lime jalapeño vinaigrette and red onion) were amazing sides. We will be raving about the mac and cheese for a long time to come, and the watermelon was super refreshing. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it with the onions. For dessert, we all got the key lime pie which was served in a cute little jar. It was good, but not particularly amazing. For drinks, we were all fans of the Beekeeper and Blueblood. Will definitely be back!!!",1,,1

I am so happy that these little scrumptious bites of an otherwise fairly plain food, has become a 'thing' for appetizers and finger foods.The chicken & ""cheddar"" waffles were a perfect combination -- juicy, crunchy fried chicken with a slight hint of cheese in soft waffles, topped with some whiskey syrup were awesome.Shrimp & grits - I am not a usual fan of shrimp & grits (and I'm from the South) - but Root & Bone pulled it off into something enjoyable.I don't think anyone would be disappointed if they checked this place out.",3,,3

And if you're not, they will convert you. They're that good.We came here for a restaurant week(end) brunch. It was quite packed so we got a counter seat by the window which was not ideal but very soon we did not care. The food was excellent from the start to the end. They really went above and beyond their restaurant week obligations, and the abundance of food was only exceeded by its quality. What we had:Biscuits (for the table) - Buttery, flaky and delicious, and topped with coarse salt that gave it a pop of flavor. They came with some gravy for dipping that paired really well with them.Deviled eggs: Really good, pink from beetroot juice and quite flavorful.Fried chicken and Waffle sandwiches; More of an open faced sandwich, with a slice of fried green tomato to add an interesting texture and flavor. The chicken was delicious, crispy and moist.Biscuits and Gravy: Delicious! Really well seasoned and tasty with none of that annoying lard/flour flavor you sometimes get with this dish. They used a lot of their signature biscuits in it, that made it super tasty. Also comes topped off with eggs.Mac and Cheese (for the table): If anything fell a bit short in the meal, this was it. While quite good and nicely crusted with breadcrumbs, I felt that this was not as great as the other dishes.Watermelon (for the table): A simple dish of watermelon slices with mint, onion and a lime vinaigrette. A nice light counterbalance to all the super rich food.Banana pudding -  Light, creamy and fluffy with a nice biscuit base. Not too strong of a banana flavor.Lime tart - A little too limey (and tart!) for my liking but quite decent otherwise.The place is quite small and the food is amazing so naturally it's a bit hard to get reservations here.

The breading has dill flavor (one could mistakenly thought it was lemon flavor), and the overall breading flavor was pretty mild. Not salty or anything. We had to use lots of sauce (tabasco honey & hot sauce) to spice it up.The chicken wasn't too dry so it was ok. Overall, the chicken was ok, not anything outstanding.After half an hour, our friends came but since all tables were reserved, they had to go to another restaurant. Also a big minus.",1,,
