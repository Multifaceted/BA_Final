0,Maureen F.,"Wilmington, NC",173,124,161,5.0,11/15/2018,"I am still dreaming about our amazing dinner at Gotham Bar and Grill. I'm sure many people can relate- we had limited time in NCY and with so many choices for dinner, I wanted to make sure I picked an iconic restaurant that offers excellent food and impeccable service. Well, this Michelin star restaurant did not disappoint. We made our reservation through Open Table.We arrived 5 minutes early and were seated at our table after our coats were checked in. The sound level of the restaurant allowed us to converse and we noticed that not one person had their phone out. People were actually talking to each other. The crowd scales a little older- and we were there on a Wednesday night- so I am assuming that many were there for a business dinner.  Our waiter introduced himself and asked us what we would like to drink. I started with a Cabernet Sauvignon, Truchard as I knew I wanted a red meat dish. The wine by the glass was limited and averaged about $12-$16 per for a generous pour. My hubby started with a clever 12th STREET SAZERAC cocktail- Rittenhouse whiskey, remy martin 1738 cognac, absinthe, demerara & peychaud's bitters. It was delicious. Then bread was brought to the table with Butter. I am capitalizing the B in Butter because it was so perfectly creamy and salty. Honestly, if you can judge a meal by the butter .........perfection.I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was perfectly cooked- medium rare- with swiss chard, roasted cipollini onions and mashed potato puree. A lamb reduction added a dense richness to the dish. I almost licked the plate clean. Hubby ordered the Surf and Turf. His dish included a Maine lobster tail, braised short rib & same potato puree. I had a bite of the short rib and it was smokey and meaty and really divine. The presentation was stunning. I saved room for dessert and ordered the Gotham Chocolate Cake served warm with salted almond ice cream on top. It was like a beautiful chocolate cloud in my mouth. Worth every calorie. Service was attentive and playful. Our waiter gave us just the right amount of attention and allowed us to enjoy the evening on our time. No rushing. We noticed that many people hanging at the bar were picking up dinners to take home. Lucky them! We have enjoyed fine dining in many restaurants across the US and this may be one of our favorite places. We absolutely will be back the next time we come to NYC. Truly a delicious and memorable dining experience.",1,,

We were in New York with friends and wanted to try an amazing restaurant. Gotham was recommended to us.  It over delivered expectations.

The chocolate candies desserts and hot chocolate were our favorites.",1,,

4,Alex Y.,"San Francisco, CA",7,63,199,5.0,9/20/2018,"We ordered the Niman Ranch specialty steak (medium rare, of course) and the miso black cod.The steak was incredible. Perfect temp, seasoning, and crispy yet tender. The miso cod was so flavorful and the sticky rice was to die for.It was definitely a bit pricey, but worth the high-dollar splurge if you can budget it. We finished the meal with their specialty chocolate cake (we're on a bday trip so why not) and it was melt-in-your-mouth amazingness). The service was also outstanding. Respectful and attentive. Definitely recommend if you want a fine dining experience!",1,1,1
5,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",408,733,596,4.0,9/7/2018,"Very good lunch prix fixe with a flawed main course. The bread was fresh & soft. I was served with smooth and creamy butter with just enough salt to add proper ""zing.""The tuna crudo had an excellent unique flavor profile with sweet elements of pineapple and acid. Diced fruits and vegetables were properly uniform. It nicely cleansed the palate. The fish was buttery smooth and fresh. This was an excellent dish. The pesto pasta was just not that great. It tasted very strongly of pine nuts and overpowering herbaceousness. The pasta didn't taste particularly fresh and was too al dente to absorb the flavors of the pesto sauce properly. The kale greens in the dish only exacerbated the overt grassiness of this dish. The best way I could describe this miss is that it was too ""grassy."" There were too many robust and leafy ingredients competing for mouthfeel. There wasn't a balanced flavor profile (too bitter).The cake was excellent. The crumb looked like a regular cake. But the texture was almost like mousse, insanely smooth, deeply chocolately, and moist.",3,,
6,Suzanna H.,"Queens, NY",227,103,538,5.0,9/1/2018,"Went here for restaurant week. I have been wanting to come here for a while now but usually they only have restaurant week specials for lunch so a bit hard to get in unless you're in the neighborhood. It was such a pleasant experience from the very beginning. We were invited in with a warm welcome. We were even welcomed to the neighborhood which was so sweet. Food:Wild striped bass crudo for appetizer; it included strips of bass, pineapple, cucumber, radishes, red onion passion fruit granada, with a chili citrus emulsion. This was very light and refreshing. The slight kick of chili and citrus really brought the mild tones of bass up a notch. The pineapple balanced it out with some sweet tones. Pan roasted branzino for entree; roasted fennel, peppers, baby leek, fingerling potatoes, white port lime emulsion. The branzino was done very well. The crispiness of the top skin was a pleasant addition to the symphony of flavors. Gotham chocolate cake for dessert; it came with salted almond ice cream. This dish was not so mindblowing but a solid dish nevertheless. Ambiance: Light and spacious. Beautiful cloth draped light  fixtures adorning the restaurant. It is elegant with some old time charm. Service: Very good. We were seated very quickly and served timely. Water was timely refilled. Everyone was very pleasant. Overall I would come back. I only wish that the seared foie gras came for cheaper. I would like to try it but I'd have to think about it given the price.",4,1,2
7,S S.,"New York, NY",34,35,8,1.0,11/17/2018,"I am a big fan of Michelin star restaurants but I have no idea how this restaurant got it's 1 star. The food is bland, interior dated and service is ok (mediocre for Michelin star restaurant). The restaurant mainly caters to retirees.The restaurant was half empty and I asked for a table which was next to ours but more private. The hostess refused and when we left the restaurant no one claimed the table.We started with bread - baguette which was chewy and rubbery - not a good start and hard butter.We got Kale salad and Tiger prawns for starters. Kale salad felt soggy and the prawns were hard. The taste was ok.Now to main course - mushroom pasta and chicken. The mushroom pasta was peppery while chicken was a huge tasteless breast of chicken. I could have saved tons of money by eating near door Mexican hole in wall taco place.It was my birthday (my wife had made reservation and mentioned my birthday with my name ahead of time) but the hostess asked for my name and spelling while checking in which ruins the surprise. All I got was stale Madeline's with candle and white chocolate with my name on it.Our waitress was nice but the table had bread crumps and dropped foods which the waiter never bothered to clean. Finally the bathroom and urinal looked gross (see picture).",,,
8,Tanya Z.,"New York, NY",388,355,624,4.0,8/8/2018,Came here on a Thursday lunch for restaurant week / birthday celebration for my coworker.I got the crudo and branzino. Was very pleasantly surprised. Had heard it was a 1 Star Mich but it didn't really come off that way in ambience / environment. Seemed like your typical New American restaurant. But the food was delicious and very well prepared. From the food I could gather that it was a 1 Star. The crudo was beautiful and very light but fresh. The branzino had a nice seared crispy skin on top of veggies! We also shared the chocolate cake which was very moist and indulgent. Some high quality stuff and a great deal at lunch!Only thing I was bummed about was the service. Our waiter was unhappy and didn't really seem to care or want to take our orders. It was odd at the end because one of us got charged 2x the amount on our cards and had to go back to the restaurant to dispute the additional charge.,2,,
9,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,5.0,8/11/2018,"I've heard that Gotham was a restaurant to check out, so I'm glad I had the chance to come here for lunch during Restaurant Week. All in all, really enjoyed everything about my experience other than the wait for the entree & the check. The restaurant is pretty spacious and I loved the classic decor. We were seated right away (despite arriving late for our reservation). I started off with the wild striped bass crudo as an appetizer and ordered the roasted chicken for my entree. The bass was delicious--I could have sworn there were small cubes of mango (which I am allergic to and was not listed in the menu description), but I ate it anyway and didn't break out in hives sooo all good. The entree did take a while to arrive, so while waiting, I went to the restroom, and coming back, they had put a steel dome plate cover over the dish to keep it warm--which I really appreciated. The dish was beautiful (see photo) and the chicken was cooked perfectly. If we had had time, we would have loved to try dessert as well. After our meal, it took three tries to get our server to bring the check (I assume he kept getting distracted because the restaurant was pretty full by the time we finished). Other than that, the experience was stellar and I would return.",1,1,1
10,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,5.0,7/5/2018,"Had reservations here late Tuesday night for a nice sit-down meal. Since it was later in the night, most of the restaurant was empty, which allowed for plenty of time with the staff.Menu consists of a variety of meat options to go along with some salads, as well as a long wine list. To go along with the complimentary bread, shared a bottle of Dujac Fils & Père ($150) - a large format red with rich flavor. For my main course, ordered the Roast Niman Ranch Pork ($44) - a fist-sized portion of tender pork smothered in a bourbon sauce and served alongside roasted pineapple. Meat is cooked perfectly and the pineapple is a nice compliment. Portion doesn't look large but is certainly filling.Several wait staff came and went to help us with our meal, all well informed on the dishes/wine available. Great place to bring people to impress; do recommend the night time reservations.",,,

12,Derek Y.,"New York, NY",102,309,643,5.0,4/14/2018,"What a lovely experience! Came here to celebrate an anniversary and enjoyed every element of the evening, from the ambience, service, food, and decor. It's not hard to see why this establishment is so highly touted -- the food was delicious and you feel completely pampered the whole time and it's not prohibitively expensive. The two of us ordered and shared the tuna tartar appetizer ($26), the miso cod ($48), the pork chop ($44) and finished the meal off with the chocolate cake ($15).I don't go to fancy restaurants much, but when I do, I always get the tartar appetizer when it's offered. Get it here! It was the perfect amount of savory and sour blended together in a sea of richness. My only regret is that each of us only got two tiny crostini! Very, very good.The miso cod plates were probably the best bites of the night. Served with sticky rice, mushrooms, and bok choy in a salty miso broth, the fish literally melts in your mouth. It was completely ridiculous. Nothing should taste that good -- it's just not fair to other foods. The mushroom and vegetables were of course also tasty, but the fish and rice were the stars of the dish.By the time the pork chops rolled around we were both completely stuffed but we soldiered on due to our admirable determination. Okay, we only had a couple bites before we packed the dishes to go, but they were probably the softest and most perfectly cooked pork chops I had ever eaten. Still, nothing comes close to the cod!We wrapped the evening up with the restaurant's namesake chocolate cake. True to our waiter's description, the flourless cake really did taste more like mousse than a traditional cake. It was thick and rich -- almost too much so, if that's possible -- and came with a small dollop of salted almond ice cream (I believe?) that helped to cut the sweetness. In addition, you also get a few baked treats that taste exactly like Madeleine cookies! The dinner was as close to perfection as one meal can be, and a special shout-out must be given to our waiters John and Pedro. It's always a pleasure to have knowledgeable and professional wait staff, so a big thank you to them both. Another thanks is in order because all of our dishes, while shared, were plated individually. Restaurants typically bring the entree along with a sharing plate or bowl, but Gotham did the splitting for us (and each plate was a 10/10 on the aesthetic scale)! I can't wait to return next time I have a reason to celebrate!",3,,2
13,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",316,454,6448,4.0,4/5/2018,"4 stars for food and ambiance (very upscale looking and no pretentiousness).  However, the service was standard (hence I can't give them 5 stars), nothing memorable.  I do not recall them adding ""more"" to the whole dining experience.  My party size of 9 - as we were here for our Office Holiday Lunch, were serviced at the minimum.  I know we saw our server once when we sat down with our menu's, another time for our Champagne toast, and then to order.  We didn't see her again until it was time for dessert.  In between, we were assisted by other table staff (for clearing plates and water refills).  Any how, they do get the 4 stars as we all enjoyed our food from start to finish.  Sadly, I have no photos of the food (could not Yelp pics, no cell phone policy at the table because it was an office event).  Was so bummed because the presentation of a few dishes were drool-worthy.Skipping to the good stuff - why you should try this place - besides it being well priced for the quality, the variety makes it pleasing to all tastes.  Must try appetizers:  the Muscovy Duck and Foie Gras Terrine (which I had as my first plate), the Chicory Salad (think squash, apples, parmesan and candied walnuts), and the Yellowfin Tar Tar (presentation is quite different from others, you'll be pleasantly surprised).  I wish I could suggest more but it seems great minds think alike as half my crew ordered the same plates!Must try entrees:  I thoroughly enjoyed the Pan Roasted Branzino.  Reading my other reviews, I am a carnivore at heart but when I can, I try to order fish.  Many make it mediocre and a few earn ravs.  This is one of those that I liked - a lot!  The branzino was hearty and perfectly roasted.  The top was slightly crispy and the flesh was soft and flaky - just as Branzino should be.  Normally a summer favorite given it's light texture, but I personally just love this fish all year round.  The best part was the blood orange emulsion.  The other stand-out entrees from what I sampled, the Miso Marinated Black Cod (served with sticky rice and bok choy - perfectly balanced flavors), and the Braised Beef Short Ribs, the red wine reduction and potato puree made it all complete.  Note: they have a great ""prix fixe"" lunch - totally worth the price and a great way to give this place a try before committing to the full lunch or dinner menu.  Plus, it's like dining in a fancy place for like half the price.  I would totally come back here again - even if it's just to Yelp the food.  Gorgeous plating on some and very creative I might add.  They score high just for that.  The portions were good to generous too.  Another reason to eat here again.",4,2,2

15,Stuart M.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,54,20,5.0,10/12/2018,"This restaurant deserves a lot of praise for the prestige it offers its customers. We made a reservation about a month ago for our five year anniversary and they congratulated us on our anniversary upon our arrival! They even served us a complimentary dessert with a cute ""happy anniversary"" edible sign! Our waiter was just OK, though. He wasn't as attentive to our table as he was to others, but the soomalier and the other waitstaff made up for it. :-) Even the floor manager came by to ask how we were doing.",1,,
16,Annie A.,"Warren, NJ",12,119,509,5.0,7/29/2018,"Great restaurant with an upscale and lively vibe! With a one Michelin star rating, it lived up to the expectation. We were a few mins late due to a Subway delay and called to let the host know. They held our table for us. Upon arrival the host confirmed any allergies and asked us if we had a timeline to stick to. We gave him a timeline and we were then seated.We ordered a bottle of Pinot grigio and water for the table. We were served bread first. For appetizers we had the mexican cocktail shrimp. These were served with a cocktail sauce that had the perfect kick of spice to it. Another sauce served was a creamy Sriracha sauce. My personal preference was the cocktail sauce that paired so nicely with the giant cocktail shrimp but the creamy sauce was nice too. The second course was the seafood salad which was served chilled with a lime dressing that was incredibly delicious! The salad had shrimp, squid, octopus, lobster and some micro greens. Very tasty and highly recommend this!For the meal, we ordered the black cod which comes with bok choy, sticky rice and mushrooms. I swapped out the bok choy for squash and the server raved about the sauce. The entree was amazing! The cod was cooked to perfection. The filet had a good crust with a soft, melt in your mouth texture that was incredible! The soy based sauce was tangy and paired really well with the rice. The mushrooms were also very good. Also ordered the 28 day aged steak which came with onion rings and baby carrots. The steak was cooked to order and very good. The onion rings were crispy and served with a sauce. The server made sure we were wrapped up by the time we needed to leave. She ensured our glasses were always filled with water and wine refilled without even asking. We were too full to order dessert but the selection was very tempting. All in all an excellent experience with amazing food!",1,,
17,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,2/13/2018,"Made a last minute decision to come here for dinner and didn't even realize it was Michelin until we were seated and I was scrolling through Yelp. The vibe for dinner was more classy and upscale since lots of people were wearing jackets and dresses, but at the same time there were some people that were more casual. Had reservations for the 930 pm seating and our table was ready when we arrived. I'd highly suggest making reservations in advance since it looked very full.I was hoping for some creative dishes, but the things I ordered were just very well cooked dishes. Nothing to complain about.The seafood salad had lots of octopus, shrimp, scallop, and crab with a bit of greens. There was more octopus compared to any of the other seafood. I wish they had a better balanced salad. The New York steak 28 day aged was grilled on the outside and juicy on the inside. I really enjoyed this steak and felt like it was the first time I had a proper New York steak, which makes sense since I'm in NY. Not even sure how large it was, but must have been at least 12 ounces. Mixing in the dijon mustard custard with each bite of NY steak was very appetizing and made the taste of steak refreshing with every bite. Onion rings were good although could have been slightly crispier since it was a bit soft when we had it.Tried my friends foie gras and it was so rich and appetizing. Well balanced with the figs and jam. A must order if you love foie gras.Service here was excellent. They would constantly refill our waters and quickly cleared the table when we finished a course. The complimentary bread and butter here were also excellent. Nothing fancy and very satisfactory.",2,1,5

I can frankly say, Gotham was the better out of the two.The food was amazing. Everything was very well presented. The food was up to par with the formal ambience the restaurant had- make sure you don't walk in with jeans and t-shirt. The thing about restaurant week is that sometimes I feel like I'm not really getting a ""better"" deal than ordering from the regular menu. Gotham made me feel otherwise. I was so satisfied and get like I had gotten a bang for the buck. It was very well seasoned and everything on the menu was delicious.The half-star is off because of the waitress/ service. She wasn't the friendliest and I don't know why. She tried to rush us...and honestly, I would have tipped less of it wasn't such a nice restaurant.

You're in for a fantastic meal no matter your order: even the bread is made in house.The Greenmarket prix fixe menu at lunch is a fine way to go: the portions may be a bit smaller, but it'll nab you three courses and you're sure to leave satisfied. My starter was a dish of house cured Atlantic salmon: a few ample slices of fish with a quietly salty & sweet tang, complimented well by a swipe of spicy honey mustard sauce and surrounded by a salad of wheat berries and frisee.The main was sliced chicken with onion, carrot, and broccolini in a charred lemon sauce on top of farro. The chicken was like butter, meltingly tender and hightened by the rich, tangy sauce. Dessert had to be Gotham's famed flourless chocolate cake: a velvety wedge of dark chocolate with a dollop of salted almond ice cream giving a perfect contrast.The room is spacious and sleek without a hint of pretention. Servers are attentive, even during the lunch rush. A meal here is definitely worth the experience.",12,10,11

Gotham really makes sure their guests feel at home. We were taken well care of from the moment we stepped in and walked our.Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered us some great suggestions. My favorite of the night was the yellow fin tuna tar tar. The tuna was fresh and had a great balance of freshness and hint of spice. For my main course I ordered the lamb. Although the flavors were spot on, my lamb ate a bit tough and had some extra fat on it, so it made it hard to eat. The pork chop meal is also very delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly tender and juicy. The sauce also was a nice compliment. I didn't care too much for the potato and veggie sides. I would give this meal a 5 out of 5.Overall, our experience was awesome. Of course this is not your everyday restaurant, the prices tend to be on the higher end. Expect to pay a minimum of $125 per person. Definitely a place to go for a special occasion of if you're looking to treat yourself!",2,1,3
21,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,267,1183,4.0,6/15/2018,"3.5 starsA classy restaurant that is often classified as a ""NY Institution."" The high ceilings and chandeliers make for a beautiful oldworld feel, and has an older clientele to match. Service was mostly friendly but at times uncomfortable as our waiter peered at us over his spectacles. Had I asked one too many questions? Efficient and quick in the beginning of the meal, he was nowhere to be found by the end of it. I liked the appetizers better than the entrees. The Tuna Tartare (5/5) that they are known for is excellent, not very exciting but the flavor is great and the presentation is beautiful. The standout was the spring vegetable risotto (5/5), perfectly creamy but brightened up by the bursts of peas, asparagus, and salty bits of pancetta. The baby kale salad was perfect and necessary as a lighter option, ultra tender greens seasoned perfectly. Who can resist those fancy marcona almonds?For mains, the Miso Marinated Black Cod (3.5/5) seems quite popular but I found it to be fishy. The sticky rice was too sticky, almost mushy, and the sauce was a tad too acidic. Overall disappointed. I was confused when the Dry Aged New York Steak (3.5/5) arrived - did we accidentally order a tenderloin? It was fine, but didn't have extra beefiness I expect from dry-aging, and could've used more vigorous seasoning. For dessert, go with the Gotham chocolate cake (4.5/5), with a texture closer to a cakey brownie. I wasn't a fan of the cherry souffle (3/5) sadly, which didn't taste discernibly like cherry and the flavor was too saturated and unenjoyable, I couldn't really enjoy more than a bite. All in all, it felt like it needed updating and perfecting. I appreciate the classics, butwhen there are so many options, there were too many things that ""could have been better."" Our dinner ended up taking 3.5 hours because of lag time.",2,,1

27,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,4.0,2/4/2018,"Gotham Bar and Grill is a swanky new American styled restaurant that serves generous portions. It has a 1 Michelin star, so the prices and service reflect that. Despite the prestige of a star, gratefully GBG lacks the pretentiousness and fussiness of other starred restaurants. Would definitely come back, especially for a more casual quality meal.The venue looks upscale and well decorated. It can be bustling inside, but you can still have a conversation. I would imagine you would probably want a reservation to get seated here due to the busyness. People dressed pretty casually here, I would say most guys dressed with a button down and dark pants.There isn't a preset menu, one can order any number of dishes; bread is included.I ordered:Yellow tail tartare - basic dish, pretty much what you expectHudson foie gras - HUGE piece, very well prepared, ofc melts in your mouth, comes with figs/jam to cut through the fattiness.

Among all RW restaurants I went, Gotham was the only one that impressed me and convinced me that it lived up the Michelin fame.Service was good.

30,D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,100,541,2.0,5/22/2018,"Dated and tired in nearly all respects. We returned for a nostalgic visit, having not been in many years, sadly only to find Gotham whimpering along. It just seems to be mostly going through the motions at this point - devoid of vigor and intensity. Menu, while conceptually good, is not executed at the right level. Decor has not been refreshed ever? Service was neither very warm nor sharp. Rather surprised it has maintained a Michelin star, as Gotham is no longer competitive at this level versus others in the city. What a shame, as it held such a good memory for us.Atmosphere- Desperately needs a refresh; decor and fixtures are well past their prime. - Suggest later reservation times, when it becomes more lively.- Clientele is very skewed toward older demographics, rather than being a diverse mix.FoodAlthough sounding good in concept, with well selected flavor profiles, the execution was lacking. We were disappointed at this price point. Nothing tasted bad per se, it just didn't seem to be prepared with any sort of passion or care really. Good job on pasty though.On this visit we had:- Spring Vegetable Risotto (asparagus, english peas, spring onion, pancetta, parmesan- $29): Lacked creaminess or that nice al dente bite, treatment of pre-prepared rice was poor. Flavors nice. Seemed almost cold when arrived.- Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras (mandarin orange, fennel, rhubarb, sicilian pistachio - $35): A bright spot, good caramelization and quite enjoyed the flavor pairings, the pistachio in particular.- Long Island Duck Breast (quinoa, candy cane beets, pistachio, orange confit - $48): Sad - it was not succulent and juicy with proper fat rendering. Doused in heavy sauce, but even that couldn't cover up the flaws. This beautiful protein just got lost.- Miso Marinated Black Cod (bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and sticky rice, soy lemongrass ginger sauce - $48): Decent, fish was cooked well and flavors were good. Fine, if unremarkable. Would have been better with a creamier broth.- Vanilla Cheesecake (strawberries, green matcha meringue, rhubarb sorbet - $15): Quite nice and well presented. Wish it was a touch larger! WineThe wine list at Gotham contains a number of high quality and interesting options. Nice collection of gems, but feel the list has gaps in sub-$200 red offerings. It would also be nice to see some more domestic options in reds. Overall, just could use more balance. We selected the 2015 Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair ""La Colombière"" Burgundy ($225), which was an excellent selection and a great find. Service- Good interaction with the somm (Artem) who was nice, approachable, and helpful.- Our waitress was going through the motions. Nothing was left unattended, there was just no real hospitality or warmth.- Maitre d' / hostess were both pleasant.",1,,1
31,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",748,432,173,5.0,9/20/2017,"Being the snobby foodie I am, I dismissed Gotham when someone tried to take me to dinner here because I've never heard or read about it. But now I realize that it's just a super well-kept secret by the real foodies, because this restaurant is probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in my 27 years of living in New York. Gotham meets all the top-notch criteria: been around for ages, a constant rotation of their menu to reflect what is in season, and perfectly consistent quality in all their dishes. My favorite dish by far is the soft shell crab--this was so delicious, we ordered another one right after because we couldn't get enough. The Sweet Corn Tortellini was so delicious, it was halfway appalling that there were only 4, because how can anyone just eat 4 of these? I've also tried several Miso Black Cods, and this is definitely near the top of the list. The Pork Chop is also one of their signature dishes and a popular recommendation. Don't think about skimping on dessert either, because these are also insanely delicious! The raspberry souffle is fantastic, and the chocolate cake is so light and creamy that I don't even think I could classify it as cake. It is transcends cake. It's like...a godly cake. You just have to try it to believe it. Aside from the dessert, by far the sweetest thing about Gotham is their service. The staff was extremely attentive, charming, and just outstandingly well-trained! The Sommelier made fantastic recommendations despite us giving her the most impossible preferences (We may have said something along the lines of, ""Half the table hates Red. Half the table hates white. I hate Chardonnay, but find me a Chardonnay I will like. Go."" There's no more to be said--I love this place. It's a must!",5,,3

Updated review","Classic as it gets. Came for lunch for my mom's birthday.Ordered the tuna tartare, seafood tower, burger, miso cod, branzino, chocolate cake, and the apple tart. Tuna tartare: extremely beautiful and delicious tartare. Thought the crisps were a little too small, but bites from this dish were great.Seafood tower: one of the classics. Ridiculously fresh seafood coated with delicious, tangy and vibrant seasoning. Classic for a reason, and must app order to get your palates going. Amazing.Burger: Practically steak. Not finely ground, which I love, and seasoned perfectly and balanced with pickled goods - served with delicious fries.Miso cod: practically melted, and mom went nuts over this. Get itBranzino: only dish we didn't care too much about - but still done well.Chocolate cake: namesake chocolate cake was very very rich, and if you're into that, great. We definitely were.Apple tart: Not on the menu, but it certainly was one of the best desserts I've ever had in nyc. Perfectly balanced - sweet, buttery, crisp, tart. Can't ask for more. Would visit to just get the burger, tart, and some cocktails to get the night started.",4,,1

I started with Frisée Aux Lardons which was prepared so well. The egg on top was perfection. For my second course I got Belgian Waffles, which unfortunately aren't on their regular menu, but they were delicious and tastefully crispy. My brother got the Gotham Burger for his meal, which they have on their lunch menu all the time. It was really tasty, and the fries were great too. Dessert was killer. Though my parfait was still insane, I made the mistake of not ordering the Gotham Chocolate Cake like everyone else in my party did. I tried a few bites, and it was so blissfully rich and almost creamy without being overpowering. If you don't order this chocolate cake for dessert, there's something wrong with you. I will be going back soon just for this cake. Amazing.",,,

The host was amazing; he kept congratulating us on our anniversary. We had a reservation for 7:30 but arrived early. We waited by the bar until our table was ready. I order a rose wine for starter which was ok. I'm very picky when it comes to wine. One thing that I enjoyed was they allow us to taste the wine before filling it to the top. Our table was finally ready and they took the wine for us to our table. I enjoyed how attentive the server was to us and helpful when I needed a suggestion.  There was a guy going around passing bread which was delicious by the way. For appetizers I ordered a butter nut which was amazing. For the main course I ordered their famous steak which by far the most AMAZING steak I ever had. It was crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. Very well season and a good size. For desert We ordered a chocolate cake which was on the house. I love how they took their time to write ""Happy Anniversary"".  Overall I would love to come again and have been recommending the place to everyone ever since.",,,

The Maitre'D staff are welcoming and provided an excellent table.

39,Trang B.,"San Jose, CA",181,650,90,4.0,2/12/2018,"Restaurant Week Review:The meal was so completely and painfully average in the realm of fine dining. I get that it's restaurant week, tons of people are coming through, and it's a discounted meal. But it's a Michelin star restaurant and I expected better. BUT. The cake was so damn good, it made up for the rest of the meal. Damn. Not overselling the cake one bit, I promise.  Appetizers: The sunchoke soup was delicious, but not incredible, the pears were an interesting touch. The red snapper, which our waiter had told us had little flavor, also left little impression. The dish was light and refreshing, the fish quality was great, but it also tasted like nothing. (the bread was warm, delish and kept coming)Mains: The branzino was cooked perfectly, the skin amazing. I really liked the potato puree, the brussels sprouts and sauce was tasted mildly of Hawaiian punch did nothing for me. The chicken was dry. It was edibly dry, but dry nonetheless. I think I expected..... more out of a Michelin star restaurant.Dessert: The flourless chocolate cake was not fucking around. It was like the perfect chocolate cake, the perfect fudge, and the perfect mousse came together and birthed the perfect cake. It was perfect. The salted almond ice cream on the side was damn nice too.Service: We had a reservation but the waiting area was filled with people, packed like sardines because they were running behind... The service was pretty good once we were seated, the food came promptly (the important part)",2,,1

Food was perfect, service was on point, ambience was pretty good (although it was a little loud, but we didn't mind). My boyfriend and I enjoyed every course we ordered and the dessert was soooo good! We started off with a shrimp and crab appetizer, I don't know what's it called because we told the waiter to choose for us. It was very refreshing and delicious. For our main courses. I enjoyed my seafood salad and Maine lobster. The lobster was very tender and creamy. I was scared it might be too salty at first but not at all, it had the sweet fresh lobster taste. My boyfriend went with the foie gras and New York steak. Foie gras was very rich and the steak was grilled until crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. I ordered the lemon parfait for dessert and bf ordered the chocolate cake. Both were very delightful. I've never left a restaurant so happy because of the food, and I've been to a few Michelin starred restaurant a couple of times.

41,Irene M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",104,202,656,5.0,8/11/2017,"$29/person for a 3 course meal at 1 star Michelin star restaurant? Of course I had to take the advantage of NYC Restaurant Week of 2017 Summer. Thank god I made the reservation one hour earlier because there were about 15 people waiting for a table when we got there around 1:30pm. Our reservation was at 1:45pm and we waited until 1:50pm to get our table but I have no complaint because there were people who were waiting before us and we got the table earlier due to our reservation. My husband got summer vegetable salad, pan roasted branzino and chocolate cake. I got cured Atlantic salmon, free range chicken salad, and vanilla parfait. I've been to two other 1 star Michelin star restaurants, and I would say while Gotham bar & grill has more relaxing bar and their decorations looked a bit more 'less expansive', I enjoyed my meal at Gotham bar & grill the most. The portions were small but I was comfortably full at the end of the course. Each dish was combined with unique ingredients and flavors that I've never tasted before, which was a pleasant surprise. There were multiple servers handling our table and they seemed less personable but they were fast and efficient. I can't wait for what they'll prepare for winter Restaurant Week!",2,,1

Having not looked up the place before hand and made the reservation at my friend's request, I saw the name and thought (and hoped) that it'd be a small, hole in the wall type gastropub -- not unlike The Spotted Pig (of which I am a huge fan).Boy was I in for a pleasant surprise! Entering the elegantly designed dining room woefully underdressed in my normal athleisure wear, we were seated by an incredibly friendly waiter. My friend and I quickly perused the menu and decided to split a few items -- the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho and Cured Atlantic Salmon for starters, followed by the Pan Roasted Branzino and Duck Breast for the main course, and ending with the famous Gotham Chocolate Cake and assorted sorbets.Everything was exquisite -- the service, the atmosphere, and the food was second to none. The gazpacho was absolutely refreshing on the warm New York afternoon and the calamansi lime emulsion accompanying the salmon was delightful. Of the main courses, the duck certainly took the cake -- the juiciness of the roasted black plum with the tokyo turnip duck sauce lightly drizzled on top left me speechless. Finally, if you come here for one thing, you have to get the chocolate cake, both light and moist with just a dollop of salted almond ice cream to wash it down.

Nice ambiance, great food, great prefix price, and wonderful servers, they were so sweet~Personally, I didn't care much for any of the first courses, either the gazpacho or the Wild Striped Bass Crudo, and would probably never order them again outside of Restaurant Week. My sister liked them well enough, so I guess its just a matter of personal taste.The second courses were when I fell in love. I demolished the Pan Roasted Branzino in like minutes, it was both tender, flaky and juicy on the inside, buttery and crispy on the outside, and had a great sauce. Whatever vegetables were underneath it, those were delicious too. Overall a fantastic dish. The Soft Shelled Crabs were also amazing and had a great crunch and texture. Really savory. I wish they offered a spicy version, that would be truly decadent. Also for whatever reason, I almost started to hum Under the Sea as I was eating the crabs. This dish really brings the ocean to mind haha.Finished off the meal with the Gotham Chocolate Cake and the Yogurt Parfait. The cake was more like a dense mousse. It was very thick and rich and pretty delicious. I've honestly had better, but this was still very delicious. Yogurt Parfait was tangy and refreshing, perfect for today, as it was hot and steamy.The complimentary bread they gave out during lunch was all sorts of nasty, didn't touch it again after the first bite. No amount of butter or love could have saved that sad piece of yeast. :(",,,
48,East V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,0,1.0,10/15/2018,"Gotham has, unfortunately, gone downhill. I wouldn't wish for them to go out of business, but I don't think they should be resting on their laurels. I came in for dinner recently, bringing a couple of out-of-town friends. You just want a place to be on-point when you do that. But did you know that they have a really bad seating section in the back where you're shoved in with a bunch of other tables? They do have a seating section like that, and that is where they put us.  I'm sorry, but a place that charges exorbitantly for their food shouldn't have tables like that. Every corner should feel inviting in some way.Also, the food wasn't that great, the wine was so-so, and the steak was burned on the outside (weird).  I just expect so much more and have gotten it in the past.  All in all, it left a bad taste in all of our mouths and we ended up at the Knickerbocker right after where we ended up essentially eating a second dinner and drinking better drinks, eating better food, and receiving better, warmer service. Oh well. Hope it improves. Always loved it in the past!",,,

Service and atmosphere deserve five stars, no doubt. While I would have loved to try multiple courses, my date and I were on a time crunch, so we shared a first course and each had a main. The Hudson Valley foie gras was seared and presented beautifully, but the flavors were lacking. It tasted far too fatty, almost like gristle, compared to other identical dishes at similar restaurants. We always order this dish when we're out. I give it a D+. For my main, I had the salmon, and loved the attempt at mixing flavors. The sauce was phenomenal, and temperature of the meat just perfect. Presentation needed some work, but the flavors were there. I'm not quite sure how to express why, but despite the above, I wasn't wowed by the dish. Individually, the elements on the plate were phenomenal, but together, it was like a failed marriage between people who look like it should have worked. We will most likely be returning at some point to test the other famous dishes, but I'm in no rush.",1,,

Updated review","I can't believe that Gotham Bar and Grill impressed me each time when I visited. I picked this place to celebrate a milestone at work. The team enjoyed it as much as I did. I started with a non-alcoholic cocktail, which reminded me of pink flamingo (goo.gl/K0qoOY). It was not just a fruit juice with sparkling water! The bartender definitely put some bitters in there.We shared Chilled Mayan Shrimp Cocktail, Roasted Red And Yellow Beet Salad and Arugula And Watercress Salad. The beet salad wasn't for someone who didn't like fennel but I loved it. The dressing in arugula and watercress salad was amazing. Shrimps in the cocktail were huge! Bread was very good too. One of my coworkers had at least 5 pieces.I had the salmon as my entree. It was perfectly cooked with crispy skin outside and medium rare inside. Too bad, it was only offered during the spring.We finished with Gotham chocolate cake. It was the highlight of the meal, even a Swiss coworker said it was the best chocolate cake.",1,1,1

55,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",620,871,1372,4.0,4/27/2017,"I've been wanting to try Gotham Bar & Grill for a while now, so it was the restaurant of choice for my one year wedding anniversary.  We arrived on a Saturday night, about 15 minutes before our reservation time; however, we were immediately seated.  We sat in the very back close to a window, tucked away in a sense, making the mood very intimate and romantic for my husband and I.  As I glanced around the white, crisp room, I noticed that although fancy, there was still something about the dining room that made the atmosphere comfortable.  Some fine dining restaurants can be stuffy and this one definitely didn't come off that way.As far as the service goes, I wasn't thrilled with our waitress.  It's pretty bad when halfway through the meal, our waitress disappears, never to return, and then we have to start pouring our own wine out of our bottle, while looking around the room to see when and if another worker would come and finish off the dinner for us.  My guess is that our initial waitress got off of work without telling us that someone else would be taking over, because once someone started to see us pouring wine in our glasses, another waitress came over to see if we were pouring our bottle or stealing from someone else's (talk about rude), and then the man that was previously passing out bread to everyone, took over as our waiter for the rest of the night.  It was extremely awkward and weird having to deal with that part of the evening.The first bottle of wine we selected, the Sommelier came over to tell us that the bottle was out of stock.  I couldn't understand why a Michelin Star restaurant would be out of stock on anything, so my expectations were immediately lowered for the remainder of the night.  The Sommelier recommended another wine that was close in style and price point to our first option, so we went with it.  Once the bottle of wine was brought to us, we happened to love it and were pleased with the selection.Food breakdown:Yellowfin Tuna TartareI've eaten a hundred Tuna Tartare's in my day, and this is one of the best.  The crostini's were toasted at just the right amount, the flavor of the tuna was exceptional, and the cucumbers with the sauce really elevated the overall taste combined together.  Red Shrimp CevicheI've never been a fan of ceviche until trying Gotham's.  There was just the right amount of acidity, sweetness, and mildness to the shrimp, fruit, and sauce of the Ceviche.  We couldn't decide which we preferred out of the Ceviche and the Tuna Tartare, as they were both excellent seafood choices to start off with.Escarole SaladFor my second course, I wanted to go with a simple salad, and although simple, it was one of the best salads I've ever had.  The pistachios, escarole, vinaigrette, etc all blended so wonderfully together.  It was pure perfection.Shellfish BisqueThe bisque was light, yet creamy, with a great flavor overall.  There wasn't a lot of seafood in the bisque; however, the seafood flavor was definitely there.  Thank goodness this was my husband's second course and not mine, because I ordered the Lobster as my third course and I'm pretty sure it was the same bisque in the entrée.Maine LobsterMy highlight of the night was this lobster dish.  There was a large portion of lobster, which was so appreciated.  The entire meal was divine.Long Island Duck BreastI am not a fan of duck or foie gras, but I was sold from the one bite that I had.  The only thing is that this dish was so rich that I wouldn't have been able to eat an entire plate of it.  We were so full that we didn't want to order dessert.  But, to our surprise, the new waiter brought us a small cup of muffins, which were delightful!  Even though we were stuffed, we managed to eat every last vanilla and chocolate muffin since they were so moist and tasteful.Overall, the meal was sensational.  The service could have been a lot better, and I wasn't thrilled that they were out of the first wine that we selected.  Other than that, it was a great time and a nice experience.",7,,2

The ambiance here is very nice - the tables aren't cramped and the space with my friend still felt intimate.We were seated quickly and were offered menus as well as drink menus. Being a lightweight, I had NO idea that the Ryes and Shine would get me red that quickly but overall, it was a good drink. It was more bitter than I expected but then again, I'm not expert since I do not drink much. Next came our meals - we had ordered the lunch which consisted of the quinoa salad for myself and the soup for my friend. I didn't try the soup but the salad was a nice starter! Next came our entrees which consisted of my chicken dish and his fish dish. What I loved about the chicken dish was that it wasn't dry (isn't that always a great thing when you order chicken outside?). I also loved the vegetables that came with it and I think they paired well together. For our desserts, my sorbet was a bit tarte but not overly sour. Surprisingly, as a person who doesn't like cherries much, the cherry sorbet to me was the best. My friend had the chocolate cake and it felt so chocolate-y (not a bad thing). It held a more ""creamy"" texture which made it taste less ""cake-y"" but still yummy. We also had a complimentary dish for his graduation which consisted of almond(?), chocolate and vanilla(???) mini cakes. Overall, I loved the atmosphere here.

59,Roland H.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",42,170,423,4.0,10/26/2017,"Gotham is a institution in New York City. It serves innovative classic dishes in an elegant atmosphere. There is a grandeur about the dining room. It feels like you are in Wayne's manor. The wait staff is lovely and the service is attentive. The menu can only be described as ""New American"". In fact, Chef Portale was one of the pioneer of the ""New American"" cuisine. The dishes here are delicious and flavourful. For starters, I had a delicious salad. For the main, I had the fish which was well prepared. The only constructive feedback I would have for Gotham is that for a Michelin star restaurant I did find the dishes to be ""safe"". The dishes are classic and well prepared but lacks the ""wow"" factor that I have come to expect from a restaurant with a Michelin star. Don't get me wrong, Gotham definitely deserves its Michelin star and is a very solid restaurant. I would in fact highly recommend Gotham for an evening out.",2,,2

I waited at the bar and enjoyed a delightful cocktail (the Vesper) while i want for the other two to arrive. The drink was perfectly made.The meal was fantastic. We ordered several appetizers and main courses to share. The service was formal but not too fuzzy, tuned to deliver a fine-dining experience. Stand out dishes include the terrine of foie and chicken, the seared foie, the smoked duck salad, the lovely dry aged New York steak, and the rack of lamb: an array of fine dining classics done impeccably. For dessert, the cherry souffle stands out as well as the chocolate cake that is to die for.The meal was not cheap (but then that should be pretty obvious), but the portions are all generous and the service was fantastic. I hope to return to Gotham again.",1,,1

Our waiter Robert was wonderful--friendly, genuine, funny, and helpful. The seafood salad was to die for--the best we have ever had. I'd go back just for that, but everything was wonderful. I had the foie gras, which was perfectly prepared. I also had the halibut which had this orgasmic and incredible emulsion made from cauliflower, leek, hen of the woods, and truffle. My husband had the steak. Cocktails were perfect,  service perfect, and ambiance fantastic.  Go here!",,,
63,Ada C.,"New York, NY",176,131,4,5.0,4/15/2018,"My favorite upscale restaurant in NYC. I've been here a few times for dinner for birthdays and anniversaries. Both the service and food have always been top notch. It's upscale without being pretentious and overly expensive, especially compared to some other NYC restaurants I've been to. Although they have a dress code, they're not that strict about it. I think some items on the menu change seasonally, but everything I've ordered has consistently been really good. This is the sort of place you bring your parents when they are visiting, or for special occasions. One dish that has stood out for me has been the tuna tartare. I've ordered it nearly every visit because it's that good. I'll definitely be back, and I highly recommend.",2,,

65,S Y.,"Yonkers, NY",1,15,9,3.0,11/24/2017,Here's my honest review on a 4hundred + dollar (incl tax and tip) meal for 2 people (our 1 yr marriage anniversary). 1st star - great cocktails. Recommend the whiskey sour and the blueberry thyme caipirinha. 2nd star- appetizers: seafood salad and oysters (east ones are better than west)3rd star - Niman ranch 40 day dry aged steak. Great flavorful crust. However: Sides left something to be desired. Mashed potatoes were thin. Veggies were just okay and the custard sauce on the side was kind of gross. Final thoughts: We didn't get dessert bc it just didn't sound appetizing. Waitstaff is OD attentive to the point of being annoying. Waiter literally came by every minute to see if my husband was finished eating his oysters. One. By. One. Crowd is mostly age 45+.  Place just feels stuffy and pretentious. They should all loosen up and smile more. Would not come back here again.,1,,

There used to be a duck dish that came with more foie gras, but they took that out :(. The foie gras is very soft and juicy. Very delicious. It can get very packed at night so it's best to make a reservation. They give free bread, and you can get as much as you want! Dinner isn't complete without bread and butter ! My favorite dessert to get is the pear soufflé cause they make it so good. It also comes with a scoop of ice cream and definitely makes the dinner complete.",2,,

The appetizers are delicious.  We had the salted cod croquettes--delicious!  The shrimp cocktail was really good!  Try the seafood salad--you won't be disappointed!  The surf and turf was delicious with a real soft and delectable portion.  The rack of lamb was awesome.  Finish off your meal with the Gotham Chocolate cake with vanilla and salted almond ice cream.  I can't wait to come back here!",,,

70,Pooline N.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,268,302,2.0,10/24/2017,"Disappointed leaving here after dinner. I have wanted to try the place for a while and really expected more.Service was lacking, waiter was very condescending. Treated us like we had no food knowledge, not in an informative but rather condescending way.  Throughout the meal, we had to hunt him down if something was needed.Food was ok. Had the California royal ostera caviar to share as a start which needed more bread that took a while to get to us. For seconds we had the foie terrine which was good and the mushroom risotto which was excellent.For mains we had the lamb chops that were awful. The potatoes served with them were cold and hard and the fat on the lamb itself was raw. Seemed like a banquet meal plated in advance and left to go cold with protein added for service.  Also had the steak which was over-seared. Neither of us finished our mains and we were not asked why.For $540 before tip for 2.5 courses each with wine pairing for 2, we should have had better food and better service.  Sadly underwhelming and will not be back",1,,

It wasn't like we got massages or anything, it was just spot-on, professional from the moment we walked in, until we left. Our waiter checked up on us enough, and also left us alone enough. It was what restaurant service SHOULD be.I took my boss there, one of the most cranky foodies you can find. 4 times out of 5, he sends his plate back and starts complaining about the change of chefs, etc.Not this time. First of all our waiter gave us perfect advice for our choice of wine, and entree. He perfectly described the Branzino, which my boss wound up getting, and nailed his description of the duck, which I wound up ordering. The Branzino was light and summery, but perfectly cooked and skin was crispy as per my boss.I returned after restaurant week with another coworker and the service was not as attentive but still very very good.

73,Queen R.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,575,19,2.0,5/1/2018,"The food was beyond underwhelming. Probably the worst ""Michelin"" star restaurant I've eaten at. No, the worst upper scale restaurant I've eaten at. The only reason they have two stars is due to the impeccable service. Our waiter was amazing-Accommodating to my vegetarian tastes (so he informed me about chicken stock and bone gelatin used in the dessert) Went here for my 8 year anniversary with my partner, no additional steps were undertaken to make our day special. Our apps were the sashimi and the soup. The sashimi was akin to an ethnic restaurant attempting to serve up some high class dish, whilst utterly failing to get a quality product. The best part was the black sesame and the fennel. The citrus ""sauce"" was so sour that I wasn't sure if it was ill conceived or spoiled. The pea soup- looked beautiful - but was hot and had that poorly conceived flavour. It tasted home-made in a bad way, also soups like that should  be served chilled. The mains were goat cheese ravioli and the bronzino. The ravioli had a killer flavour, the goat cheese was top notch. I loved the way the pasta was cooked, but again the presentation killed me. Am I in a Hungarian rustic restaurant or am I paying a premium for your dishes? Based on the bill should be the latter, but why give me a bottom end presentation? The bronzino was cooked well, but this sweet and sour style sauce that was again too sour and not well merged with the dish. Also why is fennel mixed with citrusy olives? Let that fennel breathe- it was the best part of the dish. The dessert -a favorite course- was highly unremarkable. A trio of sorbets (I wanted the parfait, but it being non vegetarian was not an option) the raspberry was beyond sour, but pear was beyond tasty, the apricot was interesting. The chocolate cake was good, but generic French bakery good - not Michelin star worthy good. Left with too big of a dent in our wallet for too little satisfaction and beyond hungry. Really thought this place was going to be fantastic, very scorned that the food was so underwhelming.",,1,

We were both excited to try gotham bar and grill since it has a Michelin star and fantastic reviews. It lived up to it all!! We started with appetizers - heirloom tomato salad and tuna tartare. The tomatoes and burrata in the salad were so fresh there was a little pop in your mouth with excitement. P loved the tuna tartare as well. Entrees were the foie gras and duck breast, which was absolutely divine and rich, as well as the miso black cod. The cod literally fell apart with the poke of a fork and melted in your mouth. We also shared a bottle of chianti Classico riserva. Upon receiving our check, complimentary pistachio and chocolate baked balls were given. Service was top notch and atmosphere was comfortable/elegant yet not stuffy. Overall, fantastic experience for a special occasion.",1,,1

We got one in Saturday for 5:30 which was fine for us. As soon as you step in, you can feel the upscale yet casual vibe - the Maître D was super friendly and wished my dad a happy birthday from the get go per my note on my reservation which was a nice touch.We started out with a dozen oysters, which were super fresh. For our first course we got the tuna tartare and shrimp cocktail - our waiter was kind enough to split up each order into 2 so that my dad and I could enjoy a little bit of everything - super appreciated! Got the seafood soup and seafood salad as our second course which was also both delicious - if you do not like creamy soups, I wouldn't recommend. Seafood salad did not skimp on the octopus, scallops, etc... Got the halibut which was a bit dry - wouldn't get again but that might just be the texture of the fish. Dad got the miso black cod which was DELICIOUS - we were so full by this point but we finished the entire thing! Topped everything off with the three flavor sorbet (apricot, raspberry, pear) which helped ease off the savory goodness we enjoyed. Waitor surprised us with these tasty little pastries for my dad's birthday and topped off our sorbet with a white chocolate piece that read ""happy birthday"".Not going to lie, this place costs a pretty penny... or two! But if you have a special occasion to celebrate, the service at Gotham is great and the menu has something for everyone - not intimidating but also unique.

80,Brian A.,"Annapolis, MD",81,62,285,5.0,1/11/2017,"When I travel to NYC, I ALWAYS visit Gotham Bar and Grill!  If you want delicious food, great tasting wine and spirits, and service that will leave you completely satisfied, look no further.  As soon as you walk into Gotham Bar and Grill, you drop of your coat at the check in and you are instantly greeted at the host stand.  You'll notice as soon as you walk into the restaurant that the space is beautifully presented and looks high end.  Some of the tables seem very close together, but due to the amount of customers, they must pack you in.  The bar is quite large and it is fully stocked with a great selection of liquors, and the wine menu is very large that will certainly satisfy.  The menu is not too large, and it's not too small.  There is the Chef's special, appetizers, main course, and deserts.  For my last visit, my wife and I ordered the Chef's special Mayan Shrimp Cocktail, the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare, the squash soup, Nova Scotia Halibut, and the 28 Day Dry Aged New York Steak.  The food is the best!  If you are a fan of Tuna Tartare, you will NOT be disappointed!  That appetizer is quite possibly the best I've ever had.  I highly recommend it.  I have heard that the service can be hit or miss.  For all of my visits, I have received excellent service.  The sommelier is constantly walking around and willing to assist in wine selections, and the wait staff is friendly and attentive.  When ordering, apparently the Chef likes the entire meal to be ordered at the same time (appetizers, main course), but I always say no and the wait staff reminds me that it may take longer for the main course to arrive then.  Each time I have done that, following my main course order, I receive the food in about 20-minutes.Overall, you will not be disappointed dining at Gotham Bar and Grill.  If you choose to visit, be sure to make an advanced reservation (30-days out).  Again, this is the restaurant I visit every time I'm in NYC, and I highly recommend for you to visit as well.",2,,2

83,Rebecca H.,"New York, NY",22,56,601,5.0,12/18/2017,"It always confused me how a French tire company found its way to becoming the definitive metric for rating restaurants. I leave the star ratings to the experts, but I think Gotham Bar and Grill seriously deserves a re-eval to raise its one star to two. The interior is what you'd expect of a fine dining restaurant that's been around for a few decades - grand accents of deep mahogany, delicate drapery hanging from the ceilings, cream-colored walls to soften the atmosphere, and of course festive lights twinkling for the days leading up to Christmas. That brings me to our festive waiter, but something told me that the upcoming holidays had nothing to do with his cheeriness. This guy was definitely cheery ALL the time. The entire night, he was accommodating, knowledgeable, patient, hospitable, refreshingly funny (not in that trying-too-hard overbearing way), and overall good person. His name is Garin, and you're in luck if he takes care of you for dinner. His enthusiasm for the food was palpable as he eloquently rattled off details about the specials and the classics.Of the four staple dishes that's been around for 30 years, we selected the miso-marinated black cod and the seafood salad. Read on for our other selections - literally did not have a single complaint about any of them. Seafood salad: basically all my seafood faves, including lobster, octopus, scallops - elevated by a simple lemon vinaigrette. A salad disappoints when there's too much green and not enough of the other not so green ingredients. But this is a whole lotta the delicious not so green elements. Yellowfin tuna tartare: there was just so much going on here - fresh raw fish, arranged in a cylindrical tower that was decorated with pieces of thin pieces of toasted bread. Surrounding the yellowfin were thinly sliced cucumbers, which gave the dish even more freshness, and mixed into all this were a minty but mellow shiso flavor enhanced by the unexpected sweetness of miso. Amazing. Foie gras: I honestly don't remember anything else on the dish except the foie gras - the tiniest bite explodes in a decadence that's both inexplicable and inimitable. (However, it's too small.)Mushroom risotto: probably my favorite appetizer. The wild mushrooms, seamlessly blended in with the perfectly cooked rice, and the gruyere cheese enhanced the nuttiness of the mushrooms. Maine lobster: don't worry about this being a measly serving of this ridiculously tasty crustacean. This dish was generous in both quantity and flavor. Each meaty bite of the lobster delivered sweetness and freshness, and convinced me that it was plucked from the ocean and cooked right away. Miso-marinated cod: my favorite entree. The cod practically glistened from a long soak in the miso marinade, though the corners of its surface was sweetly charred from being cooked. Each slice literally just slid off the rest of the fish, staying true to its flaky nature, and each bite slightly fatty and intensely savory. The dish was well-balanced with pieces of steamed bok choy, immersed in a gingery sauce, and a small mound of sticky rice, just the way Asians like to accompany their meats and fish. Dessert: an assortment of sweet endings entailed complimentary financiers, both almond- and chocolate-flavored; Gotham chocolate cake which was rich and when paired with an almond ice cream was what you'd expect of a chocolate/ice-cream dessert in fine dining; and an apple tartine, the star! Might I add - the apple tartine was a gift from Garin, as a sign of his apology for the overcooked steak (service at its BEST).One of us ordered the New York steak, which he claimed was not medium rare enough for his taste, so Garin brought a completely new one, apologized profusely, and didn't leave us until he heard that the meat was nothing short of perfection. Apparently the crispy onion rings were tasty too.I unfortunately can't attest to the drinks, as I was nursing a hangover and abstaining from alcohol - boo. But our table flowed with old-fashioned's, wines, and other cocktails, and everyone was raving about them. I sipped on a (virgin) delicious fizzy house-made concoction called ""Toast"". The complexity of the flavors, from white cranberry to ginger, made for an amazing beverage, and the whole table ended up abandoning their alcoholic ones for a little while to sample a glass. Everyone agreed. (This was again, another suggestion of Garin's, when I asked for ginger ale.) It's difficult to say where exactly I'd place this one on the Michelin map, if my dreams ever came true and I could visit restaurants and drop forks and be pampered, I would say: it's not quite an EMP or a BHSB (the Tarrytown), but it overshadows Atera in the 2-star category, and definitely stands out among some of its 1-star peers, like Batard and Aldea. AIA for the obnoxiously lengthy monologue. It's just that good!",5,2,3

85,Phil G.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",91,605,218,4.0,1/13/2018,"Consistency is the hallmark of a great legacy restaurant.  Gotham Bar and Grill met this standard year in and year out.  Sadly, last night I experienced the slippage of this iconic New York restaurant. Everything was still very good, but nothing was great.  That Michelin star is looking very tenuous. Service was warm, professional, but missing that certain cache that made Gotham so special. There was a bit of amateurish familiarity that bled through.  All our meals were very good, but nothing was memorable, let only spectacular.  Gotham's kitchen was very middle of the road and miss hit on their innovative risks. On my Dover Sole entree, a dish almost demanding classism, the Gotham Bar & Grill served some bistronomic dish that deconstructed Dover Sole.  It was weird at best, and nothing I expected.  The meal made me yearn for the Gotham Bar and Grill of past years. Some things should never change.  It will be a while until I return.",1,1,1

Entrees were better as the chicken was quite moist and flavorful while peach green goddess dressing was a well balanced blend of sweet and savory. The branzino had an excellent crispy skin, but the quinoa was overly tart from the tomato vinaigrette. For dessert, the vanilla parfait with lemon sorbet and blueberries was refreshing and light. The chocolate cake was closer to a mousse, but I appreciated the fluffy texture as well as the slightly more bitter chocolate. Service was attentive, but I expected no less from a restaurant with as bougie of a feel as this one.",,,
87,Kia T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,8,4.0,1/25/2018,"So, I went here today to celebrate my brother's birthday.  We decided to do the Winter 2018 RW prix fixe lunch menu. Ambiance:The decor is elegant enough with white linen tablecloths and napkins and a coat check immediately upon entering.  This restaurant is across from NYU and Cardoza Law, so there were a plethora of professors that seemed to be enjoying the lunch fare (as I was able to overhear several conversations while waiting about 15 min to be seated.  I reserved a table.).  The crowd was a bit on the older side, and less ""well-dressed"" than the dinner crowd.  The attire was business casual.Wait service:Once we were seated, we were immediately given a roll, silverware, and asked if we were interested in cocktails.  We decline, as it was the lunch hour and we had to drive.  Our server also wished my brother ""Happy Birthday"", which surprised me.  But then I realized that while trying to book the reservation, the receptionist asked me if I could do another day, and I mentioned I wanted this day because my brother's birthday was today.  So, I was impressed. Additionally, our water glasses were constantly refilled, and I felt that we were being attended to in a way that was enough not to be overly intrusive.Food:-Roasted Sunchoke soup with roasted bosc pearThis was a hot soup, extremely creamy and smooth, but not clawingly rich.  It had several small squares of poached pear that added a delightful sweetness to the soup.  Both my brother and  loved it.  We both thought this was the best appetizer. Portion size was not bad either.-Red Snapper Sashimi with sesame ginger, guajilllo pepper, lime, gingerThe snapper was delicately sliced and dressed with frisee.  By itself, the fish was tasteless. Although mild, snapper does have a flavor.  The ginger was so non-existent as a flavor profile, I wasn't sure it was even added to the dish.  The heat in the guajillo pepper was of the mild variety, but was present in the dish, and was quite nice to be honest.  Sadly, the presentation and the dressed greens were the best things about this dish.-Pan-roasted Branzino with fingerling potatoes, fennel, black olives, brussel sprouts.The Branzino- perfectly cooked so that the skin was crispy, while the fleshy side was deliciously moist and flaky.  There was a blood orange emulsion that was tart yet sweet and was a welcomed accompaniment.  I asked for my fennel to be taken out, which they accommodated.  However, my dish had no black olives, and the potatoes were under-seasoned.  But, when eaten together, it wasn't bad.  Though, you can't go wrong with the Branzino, it was excellent!  This was my brother's favorite entree.-Braised beef Short ribs with brussel sprouts, thumbelina carrots, cipollini, potato puree, red wine reduction.This was my favorite, and the meat was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly seasoned.  The reduction was delicious and the puree wasn't overly assertive, but smooth and light against the richness of the ribs. Cipollini was nicely roasted, though the outside skin that is usually removed through blanching somehow remained. This also costs an additional $12 above the prix fixe menu.Dessert: (KUDOS TO THE PATISSIER!!!)-Gotham Chocolate cake with salted almond ice creamDELICIOUS, especially if you love dark chocolate.  I was expecting a spongier cake from the appearance, but it was a cross between a chocolate cheesecake and a chocolate souffle texture.  The ice cream and crunchy crumbles just elevated this dish to star quality.-Lemon Parfait with matcha , mandarin sorbetMy brother loved this so much that he ordered a second one of these ( for an additional $15).  This was not the American type of parfait, but the frozen kind that the French serve up.  It's similar to a semifreddo.  That being said, it was lemon flavored and nestled atop what looked to be   Chantilly creme.  The sorbet was mandarin, and tasted like I was eating the fruit right off the tree. It did not have the muted taste that usually accompanies fruit once it has been mixed with water. Oh, and they put a candle on it, and wrote out happy birthday in chocolate on the plate.Summary:  Gotham is elegant, our wait staff exceptional, the desserts were amazing as were the sauces to all the dishes.  A RW menu might not have given me the scope of this restaurant, but I was not overwhelmed as I have been in other Michelin rated restaurants.  The plating is not large, but pretty enough.  The menu is sort of on the safe side, even for the regular lunch menu.  The food was good, well presented, but nothing that will blow your mind.  However, how can you beat $30 and $42 for a 3 course meal at an elegant restaurant. With the extra dessert our meal came up to about $93.",1,,

Both of them had great flavors and looks nicely, I think it worth 4 star. but I will give 5 star because of the price. Everything is good, nice ambiance, decor and soft lighting make Gotham looks fancy, it worths Michelin frame. But the waitress looks sad all the time. Maybe it was RW, therefore our waitress looks unfriendly. Anyway, I will give 4 star to Gotham, 5 for food and 3 for service.It was our first time visit Gotham, and surely we will return again.",1,,

93,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,637,5.0,9/29/2016,"I heard a lot of great things about Gotham so, I was so excited to be finally coming here! Gotham has won so many rewards you need to come with really high expectations. I've read some reviews and seen some pictures but had no idea what to order. My boyfriend ordered the yellowfin tuna tartar and I ordered a dozen oysters to share for our first course. I'm not the biggest fan of tartar because I think some places don't do it well but Gotham's was so savory! The yellowfin tuna tartar comes with Japanese cucumber, shiso leaf, sweet miso, and asian ginger vinaigrette. I was a little jealous I didn't order this and I wish it was bigger but I definitely ordered the better fish. The oysters were so yummy! I understand some people hate oysters, but they're wrong and they're delicious. We ended up ordering another half dozen! We could've just sat there and only ate oysters to be honest.We paired our first course and second course with a glass of their white wine. Our waiter was so great! He was making us laugh and giving us great suggestions. He also kept lighting our candle because for some reason we just kept blowing it out talking. The space is so big! I don't know what people are talking about when they say they are so close to other tables and it's so loud because I didn't feel that way at all but maybe it's different with a big group because I was only with my boyfriend.For the second course I ordered the seafood risotto and my boyfriend ordered the seafood salad. I loved my seafood risotto and you can tell they literally just made it a second ago! I was a little hesitant ordering risotto because places either undercook it or make it super mushy. This risotto was perfect. It was a red shrimp risotto with English peas, pea tendrils, pancetta, and manzanilla sherry reduction.  My boyfriends seafood salad looked great. I'm not the biggest fan of ordering salads at expensive places because I feel cheated but this salad was packed with scallops, squid, Spanish octopus, sweet shrimp, and avocado lemon vinaigrette. It's a good clean option and the octopus on it was on point. The third course we decided we wanted red meat. So, we ordered two glasses of red wine. I chose the rack of lamb with Swiss chard, roasted cipollini, potato purée, and a rich lamb reduction. I loved this lamb! It was so juicy and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the pork chops with hen of woods mushrooms, broccolini, roasted potatoes, polenta, and a Marsala sherry reduction. I don't know how his pork chops tasted because he ate it all before I could get a bite! He told me it was very tasty though. We were so full we chose not to order dessert. Which I'm kind of regretting now because I see people raving about their chocolate cake! So, until next time. I would recommend this place to my friends if they wanted to celebrate something really special it's not really a place you go to every week or every month. Also, make sure to make a reservation! They are always so packed!",4,3,3
94,Ck K.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,1,0,4.0,7/30/2018,"Hadn't in awhile to this quintessential NYC restaurant.  Appetizers were pedestrian, very good but probably could have gotten at many restaurants.  The entrees is why this place is so good and continues to pack them in after all these years.  Only a few kitchens in the city could create the soft shell crab dish (seasonal) and the miso cod was fantastic.  Showing Nobu how it's done Will be sure to be back.",,,

96,Lele S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,33,28,4.0,9/9/2017,"Upscale dining. Very good service. Only little disappointment was for the member of our party who is celiac - other than to tell her what she couldn't eat, despite booking several weeks ago and warning them, she missed out on the bread option because they don't 'do gluten free'. That said, at the end when they bring you the little cakes, they did bring her candy instead which was thoughtful. The menu is a bit confusing with the 1,2,3 levels as 1&2 are both appetisers. Had the seafood salad as an appetiser which was filled with a lot of seafood. For main had the lobster which was very substantial and presented gorgeously! Chocolate cake was too rich for me as more like a torte as is flourless. Was very jealous of our friend who had the soufflé, it was the bomb! Nice touch to bring free items at the end.",,,
97,Britney G.,"Houston, TX",431,492,2248,4.0,9/23/2016,"Well, well, well! After a few years of building and perfecting my food snob reputation, I decided it was time to try my appetite at a Michelin Star Rated restaurant! And the hubby and I picked Gotham, as we wanted to stick with a 1-star rated place. I mean with $$$$ we figured that's pretty affordable for a couple of middle class people! I am nowhere near ready to take out a loan for a meal, so this fit the bill perfectly! With 4 people dining, the bill was a little over $430 which was not bad for a bottle of wine ($95), 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 3 cappuccinos!The atmosphere is upscale with a slightly classy vibe, which I liked. We were seated immediately (with reservations made kindly by my friend, through Opentable - convenient!!) Upon reaching the table, the maître' d kindly pulled the table out so that myself and my other female companion could be seated on the comfy bench seat. But, here is where they lost a .25 star! I was wearing a black dress and they provided white linen napkins! This surprised me as I have been to less expensive (but still upscale) dining establishments that offer either a white or black napkin to match your attire, as to prevent lint from showing on your clothes after dining. They were missing this little detail, which was astonishing to me! But on to the FOOD! First of all, all of the food was utterly amazing, with the exception of the hubby's Dry-aged steak. While I thought it was fine, he was not impressed at all. But there is a key point to my statement, it was ""fine"". It should have been mouth-watering amazing! But, let me talk about what was amazing! For appetizers, we ordered the Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare and Wild Mushroom and Foie Gras Terrine. Wow!! The tartare was art-on-a-plate and was very well seasoned and very fresh. I wished there was more! And the foie gras, color me impressed! This was my first ever experience with foie gras and I can say I was pleasantly surprised! Who would have thought I liked liver?? I just focused on not thinking about WHAT I was eating, and instead focused on the flavors and how they went so well with the small bits of fruit and beet that accompanied the dish. Very good combination!For entrees, my girlfriend and I each got the Thai Spiced Maine Lobster and the boys ordered the Rack of Lamb and the 28-day Dry Aged Steak. Man!! That LOBSTER though! The Lobster was another art-on-a-plate presentation, with the meat just barely laying inside of the shell (which made it effortless to remove from the shell). The lobster had a great flavor and I could really taste the ginger and curry sauces, done just right, and not too overpowering. The light sauce allowed the lobster taste itself, to still shine! The lobster was laid over a bed of Asian noodles that were also very delicious. I cleaned my plate, to say the least!The Rack of Lamb was also amazing! Luckily my girlfriend's hubby shared two bites with me. The presentation of the lamb was well done and it was a large portion. Very well seasoned, cooked medium to rare and just tender and juicy and lovely! But sadly, here is where they lost the other .25 star! The steak!! I can agree with the hubby that the steak had a char flavor that took away from the flavor of the beef some. While I did enjoy the few bites that I had, and it was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, I have to say it was just fine. No wow factor though, which was disappointing considering the Michelin star!I did enjoy everything for the most part and the service was great. When entering the restaurant, the maître d asked if we were celebrating anything and it just happened to be both my hubby and my birthdays, within a week of each other! And after our meal, the hubby and I were graced with the cutest little dessert with different flavored cake balls, and a nice piece of chocolate with ""Happy Birthday"" written quite impressively on such a small piece of sugar square! And a cute little birthday wish candle as well! Great touch and a great end to the night! Overall, a strong 4.5 stars!Follow me on my way to foodietown! britneygfoodie.yelp.com",3,1,2

100,Thomas W.,"New York, NY",1230,795,524,5.0,3/30/2018,"There is something truly American about the Gotham Bar and Grill.  Having classic New American cuisine in New York City--the most international, and perhaps European of North American cities is an event in itself.  For 30+ years chef Alfred Portale's Gotham Bar and Grill has been one of the quintessential Union Square/Greenwich Village culinary gems.  I love the spacious, and comfortable dining area--much more inviting than many of the cramped dining halls in Greenwich Village.  I had a wonderful meal with friends a few weeks ago.  I started with some of the East/West Oysters with a subtle red wine mignonette, and some of their traditional chilled Mayan shrimp cocktail with cocktail sauce and lemon aioli.  I love the white asparagus soup, the King Salmon, and the free range chicken which is perfectly seared a la their Michelin rating.  So if you are looking to impress a date, or just want a classic New American meal, Gotham Bar and Grill should be just what the doctor ordered!",6,1,2
101,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,256,201,4.0,11/21/2017,"I booked a table for 3 here recently to celebrate a milestone birthday. We arrived and were seated promptly. We ordered drinks and main courses, which arrived in a reasonable timeframe after the complementary bread. I got the rack of lamb, while my dining companions both opted for the miso cod. The lamb itself was delicious, but the potatoes could have used some help. Their miso cod was very good, but not quite as saturated with flavor as I had expected. Dessert was really the home run course. I got the chocolates, 3 assorted varieties, which were so amazing I don't even remember what anyone else at the table ordered. They all thought their desserts were the best, though. Throughout dinner and dessert we felt well attended, always had water and offers for more drinks were made. Two issues though- after dessert, it took 40 minutes to get the check. We ended up having to wave someone over to go get our bill and check, as we were trying to make a train that didn't run past 10pm. I really didn't anticipate this being an issue, having arrived at 6:45 and given ourselves ample time to enjoy the meal, but, this check thing really took quite a bit longer than expected. Also, the tables. There's a long bench on one side and chairs on the other, tables in the middle. I sat on the bench side, and had to get up in the middle of dinner. With the spacing of the tables all being so close together that you can't squeeze between them (it involves physically moving tables when someone wishes to leave) it was a hassle, and I felt like I was interrupting the dinner of the table next to us because I had to get up. Yes, I understand space is at a premium, but it's pretty poor design when you count on physically moving entire tables to access 50% of your seating. It also makes intimate conversation impossible, so, be careful what you plan to discuss with your partner here.",1,,

I wasn't exactly crazy about the mignonette sauce with the oysters but they were delicious with just lemon. We enjoyed a nice 2012 vintage of the Chateau Cabriéres, which paired nicely with the meal.

The presentation of the salad was delicate, the taste was sophisticated and the balance of the sweet and savoriness was amazing.Foie gras was at the another level. I really enjoy trying different plates of foie gras, and definitely, Gotham Bar and Grill offered one of the best foie gras I've ever tasted. As our second dish, we ordered Ravioli and black cod. With regards to black cod, they tried to express the Asian dishes in a very unique way. The miso flavor definitely spiced up the harmony. Ravioli was great. I loved how chewy and soft the dish was.

106,Nick D.,"Ocean City, NJ",0,42,114,3.0,2/10/2018,"Nothing overly special for the price. Cost for 2 people without alcohol was $200.  Cocktails are $18 to $21. Wine by the glass were at $25. Diet Soda was $5. Skip the overpriced alcohol if you do plan on coming here. Tried the Peekytoe crab and shrimp appetizer $28 and there were 4 mini shrimp and probably a total of less than 1 oz of crab. Should have cost around $16.  The pumpkin ravioli were also $28. They were delicious but not sure they were worth $5.60 each. The tuna tartare is $26 but is definitely worth it because it is fresh and delicious and always pricey regardless of where it's purchased. The vegetable plate at $32 is NOT worth it. It was the smallest vegetable plate I had ever ordered for that price. Tasted mediocre and totally overpriced. The miso glazed cod at $48 was excellent--this was one of the best fish entrees I've had. Service was not the best--wasn't focused, didn't come back to check how we were doing.  Tried to use a dining reward that was earned through OpenTable and the young manager rudely came to our table and told us we couldn't, even when OpenTable had us reserve a table here just to use the dining reward.  Even though the food was mostly good, I would not return because of the rude management and the value just isn't there.

121,Quin T.,"St. Charles, IL",125,540,4,3.0,7/26/2017,"After hearing rave reviews from a past employee and knowing that Gotham has been a long staple of NY, I was very excited. I was given the option to sit at a table or the bar and chose the bar. However, there is a large gap between the rail and the bar and it looked as if I would have a hard time dining. Although they provide you with some type of tray to bridge the gap, I am only 5'3"", and it was still awkward, so I moved to a table located in the bar area. I was approached by Robert aka Beau and he brought me water. I sat for a long time before he decided to take my order. He walked by me several times without acknowledging my existence and so finally after some rubbernecking, I saw him chatting with the other staff and I had to ""summon"" him with the look. When he approached, all he asked me was if I was ready to order and if I had any questions. No mention of the specials or recommendations that I had heard about from the waiter at the table below me. I ordered the kale salad and he said ""is that all"" while gathering my menus. I told him I planned to order a meal and I placed the menu back in front of me. He had the audacity to remove my menu and place it on the table across from me and said that he needed that space to place my salad. I was appalled. Maybe I should not have dined at Gotham after having dined at Gabriel Kreuther the night before. The service at Gabriel is what I am accustomed to as I dine all over the country at least 4-5 times a week, so when I receive bad service, it is always a shame. The salad was very good albeit a little too much dressing, so I would suggest asking for a light pour. Again, after what seemed forever, I had to search for beau to place my order of the miso cod (which was made to perfection). I was truly annoyed by him so much so, that I had to ask a front manager if he was a new employee and to my dismay, I gathered that he has been employed at Gotham for a while. Evidently, she must have had a chat with him, because he seemed more attentive, but it was too late at that point, as I was on to dessert. I decided on the chocolate cake and it was extremely good, but very rich. Gotham also graciously provides you with a basket of chocolate and vanilla financiers.As I was signing my check, I noticed in the side pocket a brochure that Gotham's Cordioli olive oil won the gold prize at the 2017 NY international olive oil competition and is served in the dining room. It would have been very nice to have known that as I would have liked to try it and most likely would have bought a bottle. Overall, while I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, I concur with a few other Yelpers, that the service is pretty bad. Beau should have spent less time socializing with the staff and more time noticing my empty plates. I almost reduced his tip from 20% to 15%, but instead, I wanted to send a message that class always takes the high road and we always do what is right regardless of how poor we are treated.",6,1,1
122,Ying C.,"Miami, FL",146,199,101,4.0,2/4/2017,"Situated near Union square, this restaurant is unassuming on the street front but absolutely beautiful once you walk inside. I was prompted to try this place during restaurant week and had a delightful experience. We ordered from the restaurant week menu and the regular menu for lunch. The following is what I tried:Seafood salad (5/5) - Incredible. Small amount of food for its price, but that is to be expected at a four dollar sign restaurant. In terms of flavor, it was absolutely wonderful. All the seafood (scallop, octopus, shrimp, lobster) was perfectly cooked. The slight touch of tang from the lemon vinaigrette made this a refreshing and perfect appetizer. So delicious.Pan Roasted Branzino (4.5/5) - The branding was absolutely perfect. The skin was crispy, and the fish was cooked just right. I enjoyed it a lot, the only complaint I have is the fennel confit. That was not very tasty at all. If it wasn't there, this dish would likely be a 5/5. Setaro Mezzi Rigatoni (4/5) - This is pretty much a very fancy short rib pasta. I am a huge fan of pasta, and this dish was tasty. But it was not very unique. The pasta was good, but not fantastic. For a Michelin Star I was expecting something that would leave me with an impression, and unfortunately this dish was a tasty pasta I am likely to forget.Gotham Chocolate Cake (4/5) - It tasted very similar to a flourless chocolate cake. It is good, not too dense, but still very rich. The salted caramel ice cream that came with the chocolate cake was a bit too salty. I think the cake was good, but again it was not fantastic. It was chocolaty but the individual components of the dessert did not work super well together. Service was solid even during restaurant week. Happy to have tried this place.",3,,1
123,Ana G.,"New York, NY",334,68,132,1.0,7/18/2017,Worst service I have ever had in NYC. So bad we walked in and left. I had made a reservation a week prior. I arrived and the location was pretty empty which is surprising for the evening. I checked in and the host took us all across the restaurant to seat us in completely empty area in a corner that has a wall blocking the rest of the restaurant. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever expereince. Having friends in the restaurant industry its surprising the host wouldn't fill the front or middle part of the restaurant instead he put us literally in a corner. There wasn't any server that came over to introduce themselves. There were three employees standing around and after some time of waiting we left. Why would a restaurant have three people standing around and not think to check on their only guest in the empty area. I don't mind waiting in a busy restaurant for good food but this place was empty.,5,2,
124,Emily G.,"New York, NY",87,32,3,3.0,11/14/2017,"Ehhhhh...not so great today for lunch.I ordered the Greenmarket 3-course Prix Fixe Lunch.It seemed like small ""tastings"" for each course, and not enough food for a rabbit!The seafood bisque was ok, the pumpkin tortellini portion was laughably small (four tiny ones) and too salty, and the famous Gotham chocolate cake, although tasty, was miniature-sized with a ""scoop"" of ice-cream that was the size of a thimble.I rarely eat the free bread offered, but I was so hungry that I wolfed it down.I learned from my waitress (who was very nice) that two workers called in sick that day and things were not going so smoothly.   She apologized after a different waiter tried to serve me someone else's dessert, which I laughed off, but given that Gotham is a Michelin-starred restaurant, I expected excellent service all around.Gotham really needs to get their act together, as they seem to be complacent now.",,,

I never managed to grab our server's name but she was an extremely helpful, kind, and accommodating person.The food was generally every excellent (although the bread/rolls served before our appetizers arrived were consistently room temperature and hard, never fresh, even when specifically requested).For starters we had the shrimp cocktail, shrimp risotto, and seafood salad, all of which were excellent. Our entrees consisted of the aged steak and lamb rack, both cooked to perfection. The ambiance was a bit haughty-taughty but guess that's what you pay for with such establishments. Ultimately, very satisfying and definitely looking forward to a future visit.Go here.",1,,
126,Tiffany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",321,547,459,5.0,3/27/2016,"Not much to say that hasn't been said already. This place is superb. There are only 2 setbacks. 1, they only have 2 ladies bathroom stalls so you will most likely find yourself waiting in line. 2, the bread was hard and cold. bf and I had:- 3 glasses of wine. The cab blend is on point. Bordeaux is great with the lamb!- oysters (great, but I would pass unless you are craving for it)- hamachi sashimi (delicious but didn't stand out)- foie gras is the star of the evening. The best I've had. Will be back for this dish! - rack of lamb medium rare (REALLY GOOD) you're in for a treat if you like lamb. It's a pretty big portion too. - dry aged steak was cooked perfectly medium rare as well. Didn't need the onion rings, the mashed potatoes on my lamb entree was better. - Gotham chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream is actually heavier than i thought it would be but it was excellent. Not the texture I was expecting, but delicious! We also had espresso shots and complimentary mini cakes. The price came out to be 350ish including tip. For 2, we ordered a lot of food but it was worth it!",2,2,

130,Julia O.,"Houston, TX",428,47,55,5.0,12/27/2016,"Came here for a lunch with the BF during a trip to NY and was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service. We decided to come here as it is one of the more affordable Michelin-starred restaurants. A lil tip: make sure you make a reservation if you plan on stopping here! They open for lunch at 12:00pm and our reservation was for 12:30, so it was relatively empty when we first arrived. However, throughout our first hour there, the tables were filling up rapidly and by the time we were finished with our meal, every table was occupied. They have a Prix Fixe ""Greenmarket Lunch"" option in which you receive a three-course meal for $38/person. Being frugal graduate students, of course that is the option we went for. The following is a review for each of our courses:Appetizer:Kabocha Squash Soup - 5/5. I thought this was absolutely delicious. Creamy and flavorful, and served in the perfect portion so that you're not left feeling heavy or full of regret. The squash was blended to a perfectly smooth consistency, and I would definitely recommend this if you are a fan of squash soup.Wild Striped Bass Ceviche - 5/5. This was an excellent dish as well and quite popular, as the tables around us all seemed to order it as their appetizer course. This sauce is nice and citrusy but not too sour.Main:French Quail - 3.5/5. This dish was just okay to me. If you like a more smokier flavor, you'll probably enjoy this as it was quite smokey. I actually am not a big fan of smoky meats, hence the mediocre score.Nova Scotia Halibut - 5/5. This was excellent! The halibut was cooked perfectly and was so soft and melted right in your mouth. The BF LOVED this dish and he hates really ""fishy"" dishes. So if you enjoy milder fish dishes, I would recommend this to you.Dessert: Caramel Panna Cotta - 4.5/5. This was delicious. Tasted like a mini apple pie crumble a la mode. The buttermilk ice cream was very creamy, yet portioned perfectly to ensure satisfaction without overindulgence. Gotham Chocolate Cake - 4/5. This cake had a more fudge-like texture, rather than cake-like texture (I am not a fan of fudge). It was quite good though.- And of course, be informed that the portion sizes are quite ""small"" in American standards. However, eaten slowly and spaced apart, it does leave you feeling full.- Customer service was great, and we never had to wait on drink refills.- Bathrooms are located downstairs.",6,,2

132,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4793,5.0,1/20/2016,"I always laugh when people say there are ""Power People"" eating lunch at the Gotham Bar and Grill and you'll need reservations six months in advance. Shaddup!It's a Michelin star restaurant true, no reason to slip anyone $20. There are plenty of reservations available. I had my reservation today and I got to the restaurant first, my party was still on the subway. I asked the host stand if I could be seated and was told I need to wait until my party was all together. Kind of annoying but not a problem. While waiting, I'm surveying the room. What a beautiful looking space! The bar is large and the main dining room is well laid out to accommodate both large and small tables.Once seated, from the white linen tablecloths to the crystal glasses, this is a very elegant spot. I think we're the last open table, a full restaurant should be slamming the kitchen. And this is where Gotham Bar and Grill shines. This place is a well oiled machine, Michelin star in the house!I started with the three course lunch. I've been reading about this place for years and my tongue has been hanging out for the wild mushroom risotto with white truffles. I've been thinking about it all morning. Man, I can't wait to get into those white truffles. No such luck today. Oh well, I'll have to plan out another time when its on menu. I have to start talking about the famous Gotham chocolate cake. It's a flourless cake, its almost a mousse. Very rich and decadent. It was served warm with salted almond ice cream. This cake today affirmed there is a higher power. It's so intensely delicious, someone had to have divine intervention when creating this masterpiece.I started with house cured salmon, this was a simple dish but still very elegant in its presentation. Great tasting, an excellent starter.My main entree was Nova Scotia Halibut. I thought it was simple, I really wanted to be wowed. It came with kale and potato purée, it was a good dish but it didn't leave me looking up to the heavens saying thank you like the flourless chocolate cake.Gotham, it was a pleasure to dine in your establishment today.

134,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",265,538,119,3.0,1/30/2016,"I probably get to dine in fancy-pansy restaurants about 3-4 times a year, usually on very special occasions. So when I went to Gotham to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, I was under the assumption that I'd get the same extraordinary service that I received from the upscale restaurants I've visited in the past. Sadly, I was actually disappointed with this place.Now don't get me wrong - the food was just absolutely terrific! I got the tuna tartare, which was just heavenly. The seafood risotto was hands down my favorite part of the entire meal - so full of flavor, it was just perfect. My main entree was the lobster and short rib, which was wonderful - lobster was perfectly cooked and short rib was so tender that it ripped right off of my fork.The food wasn't the problem, but the service was the part I was not impressed with. After finishing our second course, the third course took over 30 minutes to arrive, which was a lot longer than I expected. During the wait, our waiter never came by to let us know why it was delayed. On that note, our waiter wasn't really as attentive with us as I would've liked. It took about 25 mins between the time we first got seated to the time he finally took our orders.As it was my boyfriend's birthday, I thought I had noted in the reservation as such - and was a little surprised that I was still issued a dessert menu. Usually in many other restaurants that have a special occasion noted in the reservation, dessert would come as a freebie honoring that occasion. Our waiter took back the menus after we declined, and after another 10 mins, as if it was an afterthought, one of the busboys came by to our table with a little cup of mini cakes with a lit candle...and what a sad little cup of mini cakes it was! I saw on Yelp that many people got chocolate cakes and other legit desserts for their birthdays, so I was kind of surprised, and a little sad to have gotten this instead, which I believe every table got at the end of their meals anyway...Anyway, the decor was great, and I really appreciated that they honored my note in the reservation to give us secluded seating, but the quality of service was just lackluster.",6,1,

138,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,943,5.0,1/29/2016,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in New York City so far.  From the moment we sat down, everything was great from the beautiful decor to the friendly service that was on top of their fans from the beginning. We came during restaurant week and still walked away with a hefty bill. We couldn't walk away from the steak upgrade (worth $10) and thanks to the $18 cocktails we spent more on alcohol than food!The appetizers we had salad with the most amazing marinated mushrooms I've ever had. They could have served us a bowl of mushrooms and I would have been content. We also shared the house smoked salmon. This was food enough on its own but the smoked eggplant sauce was to die for. I will forever be experimenting in my kitchen as I strive to replicate it. Entrees were halibut and steak. Both were very good. I love halibut though all the time. To be honest, as good as the food was it was the least memorable part of dinner.Then desert came. People aren't lying about the cake. Seriously. My wife who has the sweet tooth and bakes prolifically said it's the best cake she ever had. I concur. I did not know a cake could be that moist. And the accoutrements! The cocoa powder, the dark chocolate sauce. It was heaven. The other desert was actually pretty good too just over shadowed.And the drinks. Yes, they are expensive. They have to maintain that beautifully stocked bar at the front. I had the barrel aged old fashioned. It was great. Definitely worth it. I also had a cranberry bourbon drink that had just a touch of cranberry flavor. Also very good. My wife had a cider drink which was not my thing (too sweet) but she loved it. I wouldn't mind trying the bourbon infused smore one day.I WILL be coming back despite the price tag. And if I need to save money I'll be happy coming to lunch or sitting at the bar (again, it's very pretty) and splitting a burger, the cake, and a drink.",2,1,1

142,John C.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,4.0,11/11/2017,"Gotham is my special occasion place when I want a nice comfortable meal with friends. My last visit was good but I just have to say the service disappointed me, and this is the first time this has happened.When I booked the table I added a comment that a Spanish language speaking server would be appreciated. My partner and I were entertaining a friend from Argentina whose English isn't that strong but who appreciates nice dining and American cuisine. So I really wanted the evening to be as relaxed and comfortable for him as possible. When I checked in the host acknowledged my special request for the bilingual server and I thought everything was going to be fine. It was a rather long wait before the waitress appeared, and an equally long wait for her to take our drink order. She did introduce herself and told us she spoke Spanish, and spoke a few words of it to our guest. But then she gave us our menus and left him to struggle with it. We had to translate everything line by line, and I guess that's our issue but somehow I thought she'd be more helpful. In fact, when we made a similar request at a restaurant with similar stature our waiter really supported our guest and made him feel comfortable with the menu. Our waitress at Gotham just didn't make us feel like she cared much, but she performed her serving tasks so I can't say she failed to do her most basic job role. It wasn't 'poor' service, it was just not outstanding service. Gotham isn't cheap, and we've had so many positive experiences there, this was a bit of a letdown.Will we be back at Gotham? Yes, of course. It's a great place, we'll give them another chance. This was a rare but surprising misfire on their part.",,,

Of note was perfectly cooked halibut in a delightful verjus sauce and pear sorbet that had the most incredible texture.With lunch being amazing, there's no doubt in my mind that dinner is just as good, if not better.

148,Priya S.,"New York, NY",214,151,94,3.0,6/5/2017,"Gotham has been on my list for quite some time and to be honest, I left disappointed in the food quality and taste. For the price of this restaurant, I expected the meals to be one of the best ever and I just didn't get that. I had the free range chicken which was tough and bland. For $40, I would expect this chicken to be flavorful and tender. I will point out, though, the service and ambience were exception. From the moment you enter the restaurant, you are treated like royalty. The team of waiters are very knowledgeable and able to provide smart recommendations. They even allowed me to sample a few drinks until I found one that I enjoyed. The ambience is very old-school charm with high vaulted ceilings, wood paneling, and minimal wall décor. The service alone earns a 3 star rating. Based on the high level of reviews Gotham has received, I would like to think that I might have had a one-off disappointing experience. However, at the high price of the entrees, I don't think I am going to risk trying it out again.",2,1,
149,Jenny Z.,"Albany, CA",580,281,1656,2.0,12/16/2015,"My experience at Gotham Bar and Grill was very underwhelming. Having dined at several 1-michelin star restaurants, I expected more and better. I made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance, for a party of 5. For many of my friends, this was their first time in NYC. I hope Gotham Bar and Grill would be a quintessential lunch/brunch experience in the city. Although the price of the lunch prix fix ($36) was attractive, I preferred their la carte menu instead, which two of my friends opted for. While the food tasted good, the entrees and appetizers were neither spectacular or interesting. Also note, that the portions for prix fix were small. I had the bass sashimi (starter), poussin (entree), and vanilla parfait. My friends got the gotham chicory salad (starter), pan-seared halibut (the better of the entrees) and mezzi rigatoni (entree). Two other friends opted to order a la carte: beet salad (starter), mushroom and foie gras terrine (starter), seafood risotto (entree), gotham burger (entree). While the bass sashimi was good, I seriously wished there was more than 3 meager slices. The poussin legs was cooked well, but I was disappointed that the breast meat was tougher than something I make at home. I have to say that my favorite entree was the gotham burger. The fries were perfectly salted and the burger meat was pretty good (although, I would have much rather paid $10 more for Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger). Seafood risotto was average as well. Mezzi Rigatoni had well made pasta but the ragu was mediocre and portion was smaller than all the entrees for prix fix.Overall, I did not enjoy Gotham's food as much as I had wanted to. I appreciated the complimentary coat check, however the dining service was below average. It took about 3 hours to dine here with 30 minute gaps between each dish. I really expected faster and better service. It took another 30 minutes for us to get our check and leave. Maybe their dinner service is better. But I really saw no passion from the chef's mind during the lunch service. Knowing this now, I would much rather preferred taking my friends to Norma (lesser yelp stars, but trust me on this one) for a quintessential New York brunch. Service is better and the food is much better in comparison to Gotham.",2,,1

From the moment you walk into this large and beautiful restaurant, you just know that you are destined to have a fine dining experience. I had a terrific lunch at Gotham during restaurant week with a couple of co-workers. For my three restaurant week courses ($25), I ordered the Wild Striped Bass Crudo, Pan Seared Halibut, and Gotham Chocolate Cake. Their food seems simple, but all the unique ingredients offer a complexity in the taste and it all comes together in a beautiful presentation.  The Crudo and Halibut were fresh and moist - it almost melted in my mouth. Their infamous chocolate cake was delicious and the salted caramel ice cream was the perfect complement and most interesting element. The dessert was presented like a cake but the consistency and taste was more like a chocolate mousse. The ambiance is great and the service was attentive, but not overbearing. Before the meal, they also come around with an assortment of breads for you to choose from. I enjoyed my experience at Gotham and would definitely come back. The restaurant week deal definitely made this meal a great value.",2,2,3

We both started with the kale salad. Honey crisp apples,cranberries, marcona almonds, and pecorino cheese were dressed in a maple balsamic emulsion. This provided a nice combination of textures and flavors. The entree was pan roasted branzino. It was over a fennel confit, black olives, potatoes, and blood orange emulsion.  The skin of the fish was crispy, and the other elements supported the delicate fish without competing with it.  We ended with chocolate cake and salted almond ice cream.  The cake had a soft creamy texture, but with the intense chocolate flavor you expect from a heavier cake. The ice cream cleansed the palate so the next chocolate bite continued to be intense.This was our first visit here, and surely not our last.",,,

There were four of us in the group - we ordered a few appetizers to share and then got our own entrees.  The seafood salad was OK - I did not find anything too outstanding about this. But the Setaro Mezzi Rigatoni - simply awesome. My main entree was the Niman Ranch Pork Chop - which comes with sauerkraut, smoked bacon, sweet potato purée and apple quince chutney.  Excellent - the pork chop was cooked perfectly.  And the portion was pretty substantial - I was anticipating a ""french size"" (i.e. small) - not the case.  We shared a couple desserts.  The first was a peanut butter sundae (its more complicated than this, but best way I can describe it).  Loved it.  Second, we had the Mascarpone Mousse - which included figs, gingerbread, honey ice cream. Enjoyed this but liked the peanut butter dessert better. Ambiance and service is superb.  I have no complaints.  Obviously, the price is high but I believe is worth it - especially if its a rare occasion and you are looking to splurge.",3,,1
153,David D.,"Clinton, NJ",132,171,174,5.0,6/25/2017,"Had a great dinner with my wife last Friday night.  While we had reservations for the dining room we ended up just eating at the bar which was a great experience.   Drinks were fabulous, esp their house Old Fashioned.  The seared foie gras might have been the best I ever had.   My wife loved the soft shell crab special and the miso black cod I ordered was delicious.  Will definitely be back again soon.  If only for the foie gras.  :-)",1,,
154,Willy X.,"New York, NY",840,194,74,5.0,1/9/2017,"Apparently Gotham Bar & Grill has retained the same dining room set up as it was the day it opened in 1984. Cloths drape over the overhead lighting and cast a dim glow onto the tan tablecloth and bare walls. A row of tables within the main dining hall forces guests to rub shoulders and eavesdrop conversations. The New York foodie who invited me here recounted a story of his once sitting next to a gynecologist in that row. He told me he had come to Gotham for the first time when he was my age, and now wanted to gift such an experience to me. It would be appropriate to wear a suit.The menu offers two parallel paths which I have yet to understand: one that provides you a starter and an entree, and another that offers simply a ""first"", a ""second"", and a ""third."" On account of having come to experience the wonders of Gotham, we each ordered the three course meal.The first that arrived in front of me was a tuna tartare. It came upon a bed of cucumbers and micro-greens dangling over two pieces of bread arranged like the spires of the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur. These soft tastes cut into the wonderfully sharp flavors of tangy, spicy, and salty that the tartare provided.The next dish was a foie gras. It was seared perfectly with a gooey interior that disappeared so quickly in my mouth I wish it could've lingered for just a bit longer. The fruit that it was paired with is now eluding me - perhaps an apricot? - but while I was told it was meant to cut the grease, was totally unnecessary as the Foie Gras itself was only a small piece to begin with and not heavy.The NY foodie had tried all of the delicacies I'd listed so far, so he went instead for the risotto. It came in a small serving with a creamy consistency. It was the kind of food that's so well incorporated that when I put the spoon in my mouth the taste saturated each flavor of my palette. Because of my novice foodie status, I couldn't quite pick out the distinct flavors within it.Finally the main course arrived: a hefty rack of lamb. I tend to like lamb shank more than a rack of lamb as it usually holds its moisture better. In this case, it was not too different. While the center of the medium rare rack was excellent, as I moved outwards, it became a little bit tougher than I would hope. But I loved the flavor. It was gamey without being overpowering. By the foodie's recommendation, we paired this with a first growth wine.And as I ate, I remembered another disadvantage to the rack of lamb: it's nearly impossible to finish off every bit of it. The pieces around the bone can only be left to its own. As I secretly wish I could tear off the last little bits and savor it with my wine.For a classy night out with friends, a price around $100 each (for food only!), is not too bad. And for a classy night out with friends who are foodies - Gotham Bar & Grill is highly recommended by me!",,,1

156,Michaela E.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,2,5,2.0,12/3/2017,"Why the two stars? We had a 6:00 pm reservation with 4 adults and 2 children ages 16 and 18 months. We had a great time, the children were well behaved, the wait staff was accommodating and the food was delicious.  We even had people coming to our table giving us compliments about how well behaved the children were. At some point the children needed some extra  entertainment as they started to whine and appear bored. Being well equipped parents we provided the children with coloring books and crayons. As we enjoyed our dinner and drinks, we had a manager come up to our table to tell us to not allow the children to color on the table cloth. We looked over and realized the kids went outside of their coloring books. We immediately took away the crayons and entertained them with toy cars. The dinner was great up until we received the bill. The waiter stated "" I apologize but this wasn't in my control."" We look at the bill and we see that they charged us $35 for a linen fee for crayon markings. We were shocked and appalled so we asked to speak to the manager Noah Alexander; Noah stated I am sorry we cannot remove crayon it is a stain and we have to charge you. Our bill was $630, we ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts and coffee.  We tipped the excellent waiter and bussing staff accordingly. We paid $350 a couple. Being that we kept the children quiet, entertained and spent so much money at this restaurant we couldn't understand the nerve of this manager.  As I come from a family of restaurant owners we have a policy of "" the customer is always right."" The manager had not one intention of removing the charge. We kept the table cloth and washed it first thing in the morning, guess what? Crayon removed! What was supposed to be a lovely dinner turned out to a poor experience because of the managers poor social and people skills. This manager Noah Alexander does not deserve to be in hospitality. We are so disappointed at this event and will never return to Gotham Bar and grill. Whoever hired this manager needs to consider a reevaluation.",1,1,

158,Bill L.,"Guilford, VT",0,8,0,2.0,3/7/2018,"Five stars for food, one for service.We arrived at the Gotham on time for a 6:30 Friday night reservation in February.  We were greeted warmly by the maître d' and the coat check woman, and we were promptly taken to our table by a hostess. We immediately asked to move to the next table over, as my wife was sitting on a seam in the banquette, and we were accommodated.  Our waiter greeted us and handed us menus for food and beverage. We then waited for over 20 minutes to have our drink orders taken. Once we placed our orders it was again a long wait before our drinks arrived. As we had our cocktails (excellent!) we noted that tables around us were receiving rolls and butter.  We did not see our waiter so asked a server for rolls. When nothing came we finally found our waiter and asked for rolls again and she said they would be arriving shortly. Again, a long wait for the person to bring us rolls.Our waiter later returned and took our dinner order. It was indeed excellent food and we had no concerns about what we were eating and enjoyed it thoroughly. During the meal we were never asked if we would like another cocktail or wine, and had to, once again, flag down our waiter to place a wine order.During this entire meal we felt that we were ""working very hard"" to get the service that we expected and desired. For a restaurant of this caliber, this service is not commensurate with the food and the prices: we felt invisible.  We did notice that other tables received greater attention then we did and the service was provided more promptly.We are not novices in our dining experiences, nor are we snobs. One of us is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and has managed and owned restaurants of her own. While the food was superb and we thoroughly enjoyed it, the lack of attention and seemingly not well-trained staff was a definitive deterrent to our enjoyment of the dining experience.During our trip to NY we ate at two other restaurants (USHG owned) where the gratuity was included in the price of the food and the service was exceptional. (We sent a version of this note to the restaurant manager over a month ago and did not receive a reply.)",,,

Chef Alfred Portale's towering dishes are a feast to the eyes and his meals a near delicacy. Experiencing a great meal is a challenge abroad any flight. From my experiences, Cathay and Singapore airlines accomplish this best. On your way to and from Singapore, Gotham's chef Portale delivers dishes that are a treat along with a spectacular wine list. The caliber of the Gotham brand excels off Fifth Avenue as well as over the Pacific Ocean. Splendidly done!",4,,3
160,Kay W.,"New York, NY",81,198,645,4.0,1/30/2016,"Come during restaurant week. I don't usually go with RW because the food is always not signature or good and turns out to be a waste. But I heard so many good reviews and things about this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. It's definitely a great deal for $25. My friend is like three courses cost 25 while a glass of juice costs 5. Back to food, for the appetizer, please get the kale mushroom salad! It's the best salad I ever had. It may have a little bit more vinegar, but it's fine and tasty. My friend's salmon is just okay. For the entree, we get the fish. It's alright, nothing much to comment on. Maybe we should get the steak that's ppl are raving about instead? For the dessert, I of course get the chocolate cake. To be honest, it's not as good as ppl talk about. SPOT is wayyyu better. I don't even finish mine because it's below average. The almond vanilla ice cream tastes pretty good though. My friend gets parfait, this size is mini.Anyways, it's not as good as other reviews described. I still confirm that resultant week is kinda of waste. But for the price, I can't say more. The service is great. They don't seem like to downgrade anything because of restaurant week.",,,

Its not something that I would say was outstanding like I thought it would be. I got the crudo for appetizer... Again, it was good just not what I was expecting. My friends got the gazpacho and that was much better. I wish I got that instead. The halibut was pretty good but a bit dry for like liking. My friend got the pasta and I think she made the better choice once again- that was really good. Now onto the dessert- the chocolate cake was AMAZING!!!!!! I couldn't stop saying mmmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmm.  The dessert definitely made this visit worth it.Overall I would have probably given this place a 3.5 but bumping it up b/c service was good.",7,2,2

We called ahead and let the staff know. They were very accommodating and even though they close at 2:15pm, they said if we got there and ordered before 2:30pm, we would be fine. Luckily, we got there at 2:10pm and had some time to spare. We ordered the Green Market Lunch for $38. I ordered the kale salad, the campanelle pasta, and the chocolate cake. My lunch companion ordered the kale salad, the free range chicken, and the baked Alaska for dessert. One word: WOW!! From the very beginning, we were blown away by the level and quality of the food and the service. The bread we started with was perfectly crunchy. The salad was well dressed and flavorful. The entrees were rich but not too rich and perfectly portioned. And the desserts were divine. The chocolate cake was good but the baked Alaska was mind blowing - it may be one of my all time favorite desserts. A coconut crust with refreshingly cool passion fruit and coconut sorbet and a perfectly whipped meringue. A must try!!",1,1,1

We had high expectations that were luckily met with superb service and mouthwatering dishes.We ordered everything to split and the restaurant accommodated us by giving my date and I half portions; I love that.

Foie, duck, aged steak, lamb, truffles, etc. all that decadent stuff. The food is well executed when it comes to cooking and presentation but it's just not interesting. Uninspired, lacking bold flavors, predictable menu.. The decor and atmosphere feels like a nice restaurant in a fancy hotel. *yawn* How about some artwork or at least some sort of design aesthetic. There's no diversity among diners here. Wealthy Caucasian couples and (wealthy) families with young kids. No eclectic younger dining crowd of foodies.

167,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,4.0,9/1/2015,"Heirloom tomato + buffalo mozzarella was a good seasonal dish. Portion size was quite small. The green market tomatoes were firm and tangy. I don't think the peach added much. Everyone at the table raved about the miso marinated black cod, which was a clear choice for a Chinese family gathering. It was cooked perfectly and was one of the most tender pieces of fish I have tried.For my main I had the grilled branzino. The fish was cooked well and its skin crispy. But the vegetable components were the true star of the show. Baby carrots, escarole and fingerlings - everything was tender and worked miraculously well together.For dessert we shared chocolate cake, vanilla + chocolate ice cream + apricot sorbet, and cheesecake. My favorite was the chocolate cake. It tasted like a fluffier brownie with almond ice cream on the side. Least favorite was the cheesecake, which had an overpowering taste of ginger. At lunch time only a third of the dining room was occupied and service was quite slow. Our girl was working many tables at the same time.",1,1,1

Servers were on point and very attentive to minor details. They made sure there were no stray splashes on the plate before serving us and they came in from the left side each time. Each course came out shortly after we finished and they were always around without being overbearing. I had the tomato gazpacho and my boyfriend had the bass crudo. Both were divine and lovely for a hot summer afternoon. The flavors really came out and complimented each other. The main course was beautifully presented. I got the halibut while my boyfriend got the poussin (chicken). Again the flavors came together so well. Dessert is the best course and here I got the blueberry cremeux and my boyfriend got the chocolate cake. Who knew polenta could be used in a dessert? It worked really well with my blueberry and sweet corn ice cream since it was light enough. The chocolate cake was so light and melts in your mouth. Yet, it was super decadent, almost too much for a dessert. Overall, this was a very different type of lunch. It was even better than I could imagine at a Michelin restaurant.",2,,1

From the time we entered to the time we left the Maitre d', wait staff and the wait staff captain made us feel as if we were invited guests to their eatery. They were attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, engaging, and personable. The food, oh the food was a gourmet's delight. The flavors infused in the mushroom risotto was so good that 3 of us who ordered it ceased eating it with our forks and utilized the spoons they smartly provided, in order to savor everything that was in our respective bowls.

It is perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and of good portion. Although I can't remember what each member in my party ordered, but not a single person had a single complaint.

172,Justin P.,"Chicago, IL",444,123,11,3.0,5/31/2016,"Gotham was an underwhelming experience. Didn't suck but didn't impress (and you go to a Michelin place to be impressed right?!)I don't know about you, but when I visit a Michelin star restaurant, there are certain expectations that come with the increased price tag. As such, there were two things that caused this rating: 1) service and 2) seating arrangement.Regarding service - if I have to wave down the waiter at a Michelin rated establishment MULTIPLE times, you get dinged one star. I've been to pricey spots where a member of the staff is in the vicinity at all times. And I can't count how many times I had to flag the guy down for one reason or another during the evening. Several reviewers who have gone there recently have said the same thing on Yelp, so I hope it's not a trend. By the way, the guy was nice...just not attentive at all.Regarding the seating arrangement - when I pay $250+ for two people to eat, I don't want to be close to other patrons. Sorry but I need a little space; the night I went it wasn't empty but it wasn't packed to the brim. Some places have a 'schtick' that revolves around ppl sitting in close proximity...But I don't like those joints and steer clear especially if it's pricey. And yes they did have tables that were more spacious, but clearly I wasn't lucky enough to get one.And I'm sure you're wondering about the food - candidly I was pleased with what I had. For starters I had the shrimp risotto and it was legit. For the main course, I had the 28 day aged steak and it was quite tasty and would recommend it for the meat lovers. I went with golden potatoes instead of the onion rings it came with, and they weren't bad. I tried their halibut also but that was lackluster and don't recommend it. I tried a few cocktails which were infused with bourbon and didn't like either.To sum up - food was good, but you're paying for that AND the experience. And it's the experience that was meh.  Since NYC has like 15+ Michelin establishments I can't see myself going back because it didn't impress. But I wouldn't say don't EVER check it out...just mix my experience with everyone else's and decide if you want to drop that kind of coin.",5,2,2

179,Tom H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",183,84,62,3.0,3/30/2016,"I found myself here on a Saturday night. Throughout the dinner, the same thought circulated in my head: What am I doing here, I don't belong here.In fact, the good people at Gotham Bar and Grill agreed by tucking me in the high corner table by the kitchen as to not spoil the pristine image of the restaurant. I don't mind them doing it; it gave me an overall perspective of the restaurant's landscape and its rich clientele, rich as in money rich, not diversity.The clientele of the people who dine here are your middle class to upper class citizens. You won't find any goons here, but you will find plenty of schmucks. I saw family dining here for special occasions. I saw friends dining here. I saw a lot of couples on dates. You know everyone who is out on a date here is going to get some tonight. It is very dressy here. There was this one young, blonde, lady who walked in who froze the entire the dining hall. Like Cinderella walking down the grand staircase, this lady captivated everyone's attention. She wore a black dress with white trimmings where both shoulder straps extend down to her navel revealing cleavage and leaving the belly button exposed. It was very revealing, yet still incredibly elegant. Meanwhile, I just wore a short sleeves dress shirt, red khakis, and sneakers. Whatever, man, I am frugal when it comes to clothes, so I can be spend-thrifty with everything else.Robert was our waiter. Robert was spectacular as a waiter. He made us feel at ease, despite us all feeling slightly anxious for being at such an upscale restaurant. For my second, I ordered the curried kabocha squash soup ($20) that came with duck confit. Whenever I imitate someone from Chopped or someone dining at a fancy restaurant, I always imagine ordering duck confit.For my third, coming in, I told myself I would order the item that travel farthest. I asked Robert which item traveled the farthest. He replied if I wanted the moon rocks; unfortunately, they ran out that day. Therefore I had to choose between the black cod from Alaska ($46) or the Dover Sole from the United Kingdom ($65). They are both roughly 3,500 miles away. He told me the dover sole was shipped every morning, never frozen. They both sound good, but the black cod was 19 dollars cheaper, so I went with that.They give complimentary bread. The bread was alright, but the butter was real rich. He gave a soup plate with the duck confit, apple pieces, and pumpkin seeds. I had no idea I ordered a soup, but thought I just ordered duck confit. You could imagine my shock when I saw how little it was, but then he poured in the kettle of soup which instantaneously alleviated my worries. Cool, man. I ate my soup with my eyes closed in a poor attempt to heighten my taste buds. It did not work. The soup definitely tasted good, and was deceptively more than I thought. The waiters colluded to throw down our thirds synchronized to the correct guests. It was a completely unnecessary kind act. The black cod was cooked well. Everything else on the plate was okay, the rice, bok choy, shiitake mushrooms. The sauce was decent. It was good, but I think I would have preferred the dover sole.I forego desserts. My tab was already running high. I paid $90 for my meal, including gratuity. You had to go down a flight of stairs for a bathroom that was mediocre. I don't know why, but I imagined a really nice bathroom with Japanese toilets that wipe your ass for you.It is hard for me to give a restaurant that costs north of $60 a five-star. My palate is not sophisticated enough for this. I grew up as the youngest brother who had to fight for scraps and scarf it down. I never learned how to REALLY TASTE food. It goes in my mouth and out my ass, preferably to a Japanese self-wipe toilet. Sure, the food was good. But then again, I have not found many food that I don't like.When you come to Gotham Bar and Grill, you are paying for a dining experience where all the employees are trained to pay attention to the detail. If you are coming here with a date, you are also paying for post-dinner sex; however, I was not on such a date, therefore I should not have to pay as much.****You have to make a reservation to dine here and call within 48 hours of dining here to confirm your observations; otherwise, you lose $50 a head. Can you imagine making a reservations at a Pizza Hut? They would laugh endlessly.",3,9,3
180,Andy W.,"New York, NY",213,17,18,5.0,2/8/2017,"Came here for restaurant week lunch and can only say - what a steal. From the moment you walk in, you can already tell you're in the presence of fine dining. Although slightly tucked away from Union Square, the dining area is immaculate and grandc with chandeliers and large tables. And from the coat check to the wait service, you are treated royally well.And they do not skimp on the portions! They offer a set three course meal, with each dish surpassing the previous one. Ordered the kale salad for appetizer - which was sweeter than expected but equally satisfying my pallet. For the entree, the fish was spot on. Skin was especially crunchy and so flavorfully baked. But the best part had to be the dessert. The mango sorbet was to die for, and was sour, sweet and tangy all at the same time.Would 100% return",3,,1

Waiters are definitely well trained and are people persons.Our waiter was super kind and briefly explained the menu enough for us to understand how to order. He even gave awesome recommendations.They gave us bread in the beginning also, which was freshly baked so still warm by the time it got to our plates. Also there was another person who cleaned the crumbs off the table every time we eat a piece of bread.We ordered a three course meal type of deal each and had dessert at the end. The meal seemed like super small portions, but in the end it was really filling. I want to give a shout out to the raspberry soufflé for dessert because it was definitely one of the best desserts I've had.All in all - awesome experience here.

For food, I would recommend:1. Seafood salad (fresh and perfect dressing)2. Cocktail (forgot the name but there was a ""mule"" in it)3. Black cod (crispy outside but very moisturized inside)4. Chocolate cake",,,
184,Nina H.,"Sacramento, CA",218,394,13,5.0,9/2/2016,"I came to New York during restaurant week and was able to try this great restaurant for a fabulous price.  The halibut entree was one of my favorite things I have ever had.  Someone else described it as tasting like summer, and I couldn't agree more.  The lightness of the fish, the sweet grilled corn, the tomatoes and the nice tartness of the greens underneath.  It was a perfect dish for me.  The shrimp ceviche appetizer did not work as well for me.  It was actually kind of disappointing, especially since the plating for it was gorgeous.  The shrimp didn't taste that good to me, not sure if it was the type of shrimp or if it was a little overdone.  The flourless chocolate cake was good, nothing amazing, but it was tasty.  It was actually a really large dessert, I was so stuffed but the time it came around, so I could only eat a few bites.",,,
185,Jason E.,"Chattanooga, TN",256,1,3,2.0,12/1/2017,Our experience at Gotham Bar and Grill did not start off well. If it were an Applebee's or an Olive Garden I would've been more understanding. We arrived 20 min before our reservations. There were only two seats together at the bar and we were there to celebrate our recent engagement. The hostess stated we should stand away from the hostess stand but there was nothing that she could do. The bartender quickly shewed us away from the two seats together and stated they were saved for someone else apparently more important than my money. We will not be back. Do not go to celebrate a special occasion unless they know who you are. I recommend the Hunt and Fish Club or Il Mulino uptown.,,,
186,Peter A.,"New York, NY",111,120,28,1.0,3/6/2016,"If you've been keeping up with my reviews, you know that I generally dislike handing out a 1 star review as it means that I wasted both time AND money.  The money isn't so much the issue as that can be recuperated or regenerated.  It is purely the loss of time that I cannot regain.  I went there last night for a dinner for 4 people. Having been to arguably one of the best restaurants at eleven Madison park the night prior, Gotham had its work cut out to prove that it is deserving the sole star that it has accrued.It failed.The food was enjoyable- and that is the unfortunate reality. When you lose points in my mind because of service- that is deplorable.My girlfriend had finished one of her two lamb chops and asked for the other to go.  We made this very clear when the bus boy asked us if we wanted one or two boxes to go and we indicated that we wanted three. One for each of the three patrons who had not concluded their meals. This seemed like a fairly simple request. Why he mustered a look of bewilderment is beyond me. He returned with two boxes. We then asked our server when she came by again for a third box for my girlfriend's meal. She whisked away the food after acknowledging our request and ... Threw out the food.Neither the server or bus boy would take responsibility for the act.  The server offered us some chocolate as if to say sorry. We sat there without eating it. Only then did they bring out a half order of lamb in a to go bag- and delivered it with such angst. Nothing about the interaction was enjoyable. They made it feel as if WE had done something inappropriate.  I was floored by the service, or lack thereof. The appropriate response would have been to incorporate management at this time and not hide behind the mistakes. That level of professionalism was not afforded us at this meal.This place is subpar. For spending 600 dollars for four people, I'd rather spend 1600 for four at eleven Madison, a restaurant deserving of every penny that meal cost.  Save your money and go somewhere that is deserving of a Michelin star.  Based on service alone, this place should have its star revoked. This review will be found under my independent column under my pseudonym- you foodies know where to find it ;)Until next time...Hungry in New York",5,,
187,Zoe P.,"Minneapolis, MN",196,4,0,5.0,12/19/2017,"My partner and I wanted a nice romantic spot for the last night of our time in NY, with at least 1 Michelin star ... and on a Sunday. We looked at all 72 Michelin-starred restaurants in the city and settled on Gotham Bar & Grill.We are both ""foodies"" and work in the restaurant industry. Fine dining is a picky thing for me, since I've been on the other side of the exchange so many times.The staff was polite, fast and our server was knowledgeable and coursed our food perfectly. We shared the Yellowfin tartare as our first course. An incredible balance of acidity with the raw fish. They split this and our second course, the wild mushroom risotto, in the kitchen without any prompt from us. I don't mind sharing, but it shows attention to detail and presentation. The risotto came out in identically frothy steaming bowls of heaven. Best risotto we've had. My partner was so impressed that he wouldn't stop talking about it well after we left the establishment.He had the lamb for our main course and I had the duck with turnips, mango and quinoa. My duck was the perfect beautiful ruby red medium rare that duck deserves. His lamb was also cooked well. I cleaned every bit off my plate. Simple pistachio ice cream and mini muffins for dessert.We were the last ones in the restaurant, not by too long. But didn't feel pressured to leave once it had gone quiet.We ran into closed subway stations on our way back to the Airbnb, but were so satisfied from our meal that we couldn't care and took an Uber.",,,
188,Sonia N.,"Boston, MA",606,391,2701,3.0,2/18/2015,"I saw many great reviews on Gotham so we were excited to score a lunch reservation.  Service is top notch here, 5 stars...but the value, quality and quantity combo honestly needs to be reset.  Thank goodness we went during NYC's restaurant week or I would be upset if I paid the regular prices for what I had.I ended up ordering the sea bass crudo, mushroom risotto and the Gotham chocolate cake for dessert.  The sea bass crudo was prepared light and fresh and was such a great starter.  However, that was basically the climax of our meal.  My mushroom risotto, though fairly tasty, was barely a cupful of grain.  Finally, the Gotham chocolate cake was reminiscent of a bad flourless chocolate cake and tasted quite dry and chalky.  I believe I left the place still hungry?  Not very impressed.Also please note that this restaurant does not offer a kids menu even though we saw at least 7 children in the restaurant while we were dining.",5,1,1
189,Heather S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",106,109,68,5.0,9/16/2016,"One of NYCs top restaurants and for good reason.  This restaurant is very nice but not pretentious.  The staff is courteous and will help you order if you ask.  You get the feeling that they enjoy working there as well and it's not just a ""job.""I went on a business dinner and they let us sit even though not everyone arrived yet.  No one in NYC allows that!I started with the Rose which was fantastic.  They only had one choice and it worked.For appetizer I had the tuna tar tar and this was incredible.  Fresh, flavorful, with a kick of spice.  Perfect.  Everyone on my table wanted a bite.I had the black cod for dinner and it was also perfect.  The texture just melted in your mouth cooked in this miso gravy that gave it the right amount of flavor.  I had every bite.For desert I had the chocolate cake with salted  vanilla icecream and it was light but didn't take away from the rich chocolate and the salted icecream balanced the sweetness.They also gave us this little patisseries that were like fluffy cakes...also amazing.Overall I had a fabulous experience.  If you're going to treat yourself, you must make this a stop.",,,
190,Jennifer A.,"Flushing, NY",296,321,501,4.0,3/5/2015,"This place is very fancy, bright, and simple. The waitstaff are detail oriented and professional. They know exactly who ordered what. My favorite appetizer was the yellowfin tuna tartare. This is a must have. Their foie gras is also very good, and definitely worth a try. The beet salad was ok but the roasted cauliflower was very good. For entrees, the muscovy duck is pretty good. I had the 28 day dry age steak. It definitely filled me up, but it lacked a bit in flavor. I had to rely on the sauce for flavoring. There was a stack of onion rings, those were very crispy.Dessert consisted of the sorbet  and salted almond ice cream with chocolate cake. They also gave us cute complimentary ball shaped buns. Everything was good. I'd definitely come back",3,,1
191,Patrick W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",128,804,1593,4.0,7/26/2016,"Gotham is one of the better restaurants in New York. It has great food and the restaurant looks beautiful with an excellent ambiance. The appetizer is good but nothing memorable. I had the salad. The halibut entrée was excellent. For dessert, I ordered the sorbets. I made a mistake. The sorbets are good but the chocolate cake is amazing. Luckily, my co-worker ordered the cake and allowed me to share some of it. The portion sizes are not huge but it is enough so you are full. The Restaurant Week menu is only available for lunch.If you are looking for places to try for Restaurant Week,  feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my person list, which includes my Yelp reviews.

192,Jules M.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,49,21,5.0,12/9/2017,"Great dining experience here. Loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. I was surprised to learn that this was a one Michelin star restaurant as the menu wasn't as out there as some of the usual Michelin star restaurants. I liked that the menu had ""normal"" items that were just really nicely done as I'm not a very adventurous eater. We had the truffle risotto app - $65 for a generous portion of fresh white truffle. The risotto had a really great flavor but was a little on the runny side.The Maine lobster was really good. The steak was pretty good too, although cooked more medium than medium rare (which is what we asked for). It wasn't really better than any of the steaks I've had at really great steakhouses but was still good. The seafood salad is really yummy!  Would totally have it again. The chocolate cake is more like a mousse - it doesn't have a cake like texture at all. Overall, Gotham is a safe Michelin star restaurant to go to where you'll get a solid meal with menu options that anyone could find something they'd like.",,,
193,Lulu L.,"Forest Hills, NY",53,27,18,3.0,1/29/2017,"With this price and the reviews here on yelp, my husband and I are quite disappointed with the dinner we had at Gotham bar and grill last night. We had the yellow fin tuna tartare, mushroom risotto, miso glazed black cod, halibut and mascarpone mousse as dessert. The tuna tartare was a real disappointment. We've tried tuna/raw fish tartare at so many different places/countries (some are much affordable restaurants), this one is one of the worst. The tuna is tasteless, and the ikura on the cucumbers I saw from the photos here was changed to be miso paste. It's like eating raw fish without seasonings. The mushroom risotto was ok. Black cod, the fish itself was ok. Yes, you cant really go wrong with black cod; however, the sauce was very boring. It said it's miso glazed, but I could hardly taste it. Instead of miso, they put soy sauce underneath the cod. It's ok just because of the fish is nice. I don't like the soy sauce and the bed of bok choy and mushroom.Halibut was ok. Nothing amazing. Mascarpone mousse might be the best/most exciting thing we ate. The honey ice cream was interesting and the mousse with the crumbs were good combination. I would like to have fresh fig instead of the fig jam. All in all, the food was not worth the price and we were disappointed.",2,,
194,Michelle L.,"Staten Island, NY",75,128,96,5.0,11/11/2017,"Gotham Bar and Grill has remained a great place for thoughtful, well prepared and well  presented food. This was my first time back in years. My friends and I were attending an event at the New School and dining here seemed logical as well as a real treat. And a treat it was. The service was friendly and accommodating.  We began with drinks, they were definitely well done, but on the expensive side, even for Manhattan. Cocktails were $18.  Three in our party ordered from the price fix lunch menu and one ordered from the regular lunch menu. My friend ordered the miso cod, which everyone tasted and it was perfect.  I ordered the smoked salmon with wheat berries and the bronzino. Both were so good I finished everything. My dessert was the brown butter parfait.  It was so good I wanted more.  The price fix  menu was delicious but portions could be a little larger.  I'm never one to complain about portion size because I don't want to ever leave a table feeling stuffed, but the dessert could definitely have been larger. The items ordered from the regular menu were definitely more ample. All in all the experience at Gotham was perfect.",,,
195,Elizabeth H.,"ASTORIA, NY",16,119,75,5.0,2/3/2017,"Two of the best things I've ever eaten were consumed here. The mushroom risotto (with trumpet royals, shiitake, baby arugula, pancetta, aged sherry and gruyere cheese) as well as the Gotham Burger (with plymouth tomme cheddar, vermont bacon, herb aioli and kennebec french fries).The risotto was definitely the best I've ever had. Some would say it's too rich tasting, but good god - those people are sad. Please eat this risotto. IT WILL FIX YOUR LIFE.",1,1,1
196,Joann J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,5.0,12/6/2017,Another wonderful place that has slipped my mind to write a positive review about.I can see why this place is a NY staple.  We've dined here twice and both times were wonderful.  The way to go would be the tasting menu and the wine pairing.  I would say that we enjoyed ourselves this time even more than the previous time we've dined here.We were warmly welcomed and everyone from the wait staff to the sommelier were super professional and courteous.  We will return!,,,
197,Vivian V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,5.0,5/21/2018,A great date night spot with an amazing ambience! Highly recommend the grilled cauliflower entree and the steak. Would love to come back to try other items on the menu!!,,,
198,Melissa G.,"New York, NY",23,206,98,3.0,2/2/2016,"Came here for restaurant week. Marvelous service, nice ambiance, beautiful decor. Spacious for a NYC spot, and I must say that Gotham is one of the most elegant restaurants I've been to. On to the food. Started with the Mushroom Salad. The presence of the mushroom flavor was pleasantly strong, although the salad didn't blow me away. Also tried my friend's Curried Pumpkin Soup, which was sweet but balanced with a perfect tang. For entree, I got the black rice noodles served with a lemongrass curry sauce. The curry also had great tangy flavor, it was just a bit too soupy for my preference. I tried my friend's Crispy Chicken and whoa. . . simple but remarkable. Should have stolen more from his plate. For dessert I got the Brown Butter Parfait, and my friend got the infamous Gotham Chocolate Cake. I know that everyone's been lovin' that chocolate cake down, but I didn't feel it (the luscious salted almond ice cream stole the show, for this one). It was definitely interesting - it was almost mousse-like, but at the same time, it had this powdery consistency, seeming to crumble in your mouth. It was intensely chocolatey. My friend, who did admit that he wasn't a huge fan of fancy food, commented that it tasted like ""Nestle chocolate powder."" A bit harsh, in my opinion. On the other hand, my artistic Brown Butter Parfait was amazing. Subtle, and not overly sweet, allowing the flavors to meld seamlessly. The pear was an unexpected but delightful dimension. Overall, the experience didn't quite meet the hype of a Michelin star restaurant. Still worth a visit, but perhaps only during Restaurant Week.",3,1,1
199,Nancy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",312,77,119,4.0,8/19/2016,"First (and really the only thing) I wanna say is- OMG INCREDIBLE CHOCOLATE CAKE ever!!! And I don't even like cake usually  It was fluffy and very rich, was not 'cake-y.' The warm cake almost had a texture of a soufflé and paired perfectly with the almond ice cream. The others: -Corn Tortellini: very delicious- chewy and savory tortellini well complimented by the sweetness of corn.-Miso Black Cod: tasty, but for my palette, I would've preferred a little more sweetness to it.-Smoked Ricotta Cheesecake: I feel conflicted on this one. I felt like too much was going on, too many flavors. But then I realized I'm not a big fan of verbena and this dessert was topped by lemon verbena ice cream. I have to say, the food overall was delicious but the chocolate cake really did it for me.",,,
