0,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",828,471,120,5.0,11/14/2018,"What. You want a pool hall smack dab in the middle of Manhattan with reasonable prices, good people, and late night service? Come here. Play a game or two or three with some friends and just enjoy the game of billiards that has been running worldwide for who knows how long.Sometimes an activity with the absurd amount of alcohol ktown consumes is a nice change of pace. So come clank some billiard balls and sticks and then if you're still up for it go down one floor to their karaoke rooms and sing you hearts out!",,,
1,David K.,"Woodmere, NY",17,38,0,2.0,11/15/2018,"Ripoff WarningLet me preface my review by saying I really like this place.  It has a dark vibe, good music, nice tables and good drink selection.  I have been here quite a number of times over the last several years.  However, the other night I felt completely ripped off.  They added a 20% tip to my entire bill for two people (no big group or anything like that), and charged the tip on the entire bill, including the cost of the pool tables.  Leaving aside that they should not be charging a service fee at all (tipping is optional and I have always tipped in the past), charging it on the pool table is a complete ripoff.  I think they did it because they thought they could get away with it.  Bad move because I was planning to come back with a group next week. The other observation is that the place has been getting progressively more expensive.  I have been coming here for at least 5 years and the prices are creeping up faster than they should be.  Definitely don't sit around.  Play your pool and get out or the charges grow, grow, grow.  Too bad because I otherwise really like this place.",,,
2,Marcia C.,"Long Island City, NY",164,18,31,4.0,11/13/2018,"Great space for groups that enjoy pool! They charge $25 an hour per table and lights are off on all unused tables.They have a call button for service & from my experience it comes in handy and they're very quick to come to you. Food may take a little while but since you're playing the wait didn't really matter. The space is extremely clean and you can tell they take care of the tables! Music wise you can change it upon request but in my opinion they have a good selection in shuffle (they had a mix of top 40, edm and some spanish).They have an open bar offer in the menu but the server said it is only for groups 40+ and they'll be given a section with tables if requested!",,,
3,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,3.0,8/12/2018,"Fun place to kill an hour. Service is pretty much non-existent - had to ask for water multiple times for them to bring it, and it wasn't even busy - but if you're looking for an activity versus eating, this is fun. Decoration is trippy and fun to look at. It's got spacy, futuristic decor in addition to random wall stickers. Feels kinda hipster! $24 per hour gives you enough time to play 2-3 games. It's a cool vibe and a fun activity. They're not trying to be anything more.Apparently, you get free popcorn, but we never got any. Bleh.",,,1
4,Kim M.,"Manhattan, NY",408,29,1,4.0,11/12/2018,"Great little date spot! Stopped here on a Monday evening around 8:30pm. Plenty of tables open, so no wait. Loved the fun decor and great music selection. Played for about an hour an half, ordered  some cocktails. the spicy margarita was great, packed a nice punch! They have a button you can press for service so you don't have to go to the bar mid game. Decent pricing and will definitely be back next time I'm wanting to play some pool! Also note they automatically add gratuity to every check.",,,
5,Allen H.,"Arlington, MA",0,13,1,5.0,10/31/2018,"I stopped by to kill a few hours and shoot some pool at 3 in the afternoon. This place was extremely well maintained on the tables. You can tell that they actually care about the game. Yes, they have a space theme but it's not distracting and kinda grows on you quickly. But, that's ALL to do with the care given to the tables. The cloth was clearly maintained, no ""house leans"" to the tables, pockets are tight and they keep everything clean. Even the house cues are straight and the tips are maintained....rare! It's far to easy to have pool be a junky thing, not here. While not a high-end room by design, the tables felt that way. Look forward to shooting pool there again.",,,
6,Erc B.,"New York, NY",0,41,1,3.0,4/22/2018,"Cool billiards place in k-town. Tables are in good shape, decent music, and after work happy hour is a good deal.Only disappointment is that after 5+ visits realized I'd been double tipping because they auto include gratuity. Since it's dark by the register would've been nice if they would've mentioned it. I'll be back, but the 20% tip they would've received will now be the 15% auto.",1,,
7,Kevin N.,"Forest Park, IL",20,91,175,4.0,10/23/2017,"Went here while exploring around Koreatown and seeing what there was to do. This place looked good so I stopped by here with a friend. Wasn't disappointed.ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 8/10The cosmic style decor with the colors and dimly lit area really worked for me here. I like the overall atmosphere and most importantly it was clean and well kept. I don't really have any complaints about the design at all. I think it would make a great place for a party for a big group.SERVICE : N/A/10From what they told us, you hit a button and they come to your table so I assume it's good. I didn't use it at all though so I can't comment on this part.FOOD: N/A/10I didn't order any food or drinks.PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 9/10Supposedly $23 per hour on the weekends for a billiards place is pretty cheap. I'll take people's word for it. I enjoyed my time here and I would most certainly come back.OVERALL: 8/10",,,
8,RJ S.,"New Haven, CT",2,7,0,5.0,9/29/2018,This place is legitimately a fun place to hang out and sing my little hearts out in a private space. Our waitress/attendant was very fun. Shout out to Michelle H. in the kareoke lounge for taking care us,,,1
9,Sarah P.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",0,3,6,5.0,8/19/2018,"I loved Space Billiards! I've been here twice so far. This weekend was my second time. I got here on a Friday night and expected a long wait, but only waited 20 minutes although it was bustling with people. The wait also felt a lot shorter because there's a spacious bar area by the entrance you can sit at. The music was on point. The staff--security, waiters, bartenders--was incredibly nice and helpful. The decorations are very well done. There are a decent amount of pool tables, with abundant space, seating, and tables around each of them. The hourly rate when I went was $32 for my party of 4, so each of us only paid $8 for the hour we were there, which was very reasonable. The drinks are also delicious!",,,
10,Ina M.,"Hackensack, NJ",357,456,998,1.0,2/9/2017,"Man, this place was promising. Take note: WAS. It all turned sour towards half of our stay. My friend, fiancé and I wanted to do something fun. Our usual spot, Spin (cool ping pong spot) was full for a corporate event so we decided to head here. Space is located on the 12th floor. Up the elevator you go and there it is. We missed happy hour, but still asked for one hour for the three of us. They charge an extra $3 per person after two guests. I didn't mind it as it's understandable, plus they have it written so it wasn't a surprise charge. We got the large lychee soju and it was good. Half way through our time, I ordered a beer and nachos. I got the beer, but never got the nachos. So as time passed, I thought they just forgot to put the order in. Plus, I didn't see the server to ask where they were. Time was up (I was keeping track of time; we started at 8:30pm) and we went to the bar to close our tab. Upon seeing the check, I got charged for the nachos. Okay, we tell her we never got the nachos. She seemed confused, went to the back/kitchen and came back out. Then she was talking to another girl and guy... Time passed while waiting for them to take it off. I get the check for the second time. Great, I got charged $13 for ""half hour."" We asked her how we went over, and they said ""oh yeah, you were here for 11 more minutes."" I really don't understand because the pool table lights went off for the table next to us when their time was finished, but it so happens that we went to the bar to close out and yet the time was still running. The staff was literally talking to each other while voiding off the nachos, but I got charged for it. I had a feeling they wouldn't remind us about our time left, that's why I kept count. But to be charged for the time they were getting the check together, I just felt like this place was really, really shady. I wouldn't suggest coming to this place. There are way better billiards spots that have a better vibe and service.",10,2,2
11,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,634,4.0,12/17/2016,I usually like to play pool in bars but sometimes it gets super crowded and I find solace in space billiards! It's much cheaper than other billiard places in manhattan and the people there are super attentive. I've been here multiple times and I've never been disappointed. It's so conveniently located in k-town next to the B/D/F/M train or 6 if you want to walk a few avenues. They have happy hour before 8 which I always miss somehow! They take credit card but have 8% off if you pay in cash (they have an ATM machine). The music is always great and the billiard tables are well kept! Once getting a table they give you complimentary popcorn which they refill! I love getting the popcorn! The drinks are also at a reasonable price but the cocktails are a much better option because they are tasty! Try their flavored shots! I'm not usually a shot person but I found them very tasty. Theres a lot of space to play pool as well. I usually find when I play pool i knock into people or the pool stick knocks into the wall. Before leaving make sure to get their loyalty card! I love coming here and the people are so nice. I've only waited for a pool table once but the people working there are very friendly and the wait time is never long.,9,2,4
12,Leslie C.,"Ithaca, NY",317,12,4,4.0,7/22/2018,Pretty cool place! I went with a couple of friends. we had fun! I ordered the shrimp which was good but a bit pricy and took a long time haha! Check it out though! I wanna see more of these hidden places i never got to see in or around ktown,,,
13,Christine T.,"West Hempstead, NY",108,27,23,5.0,3/1/2018,"Love love love this low key spot. So this place is in the cut, and on the 9th floor of the building. Basically if u dont know about it u wont be going because its so low key. So we got there at 6 and that was happy hour. So it was 18 dollars for the two of us for an hour. The shots were five dollars and so were the beers. Great price. The decor is basic but futuristic. The staff was so nice from the second we walked in til we left. The guy even recommended a great spot to eat. It was pleasant, low key, and cool. Will def. go back and recommend for a date night with ur boo or just hanging with friends. Awesome spot cant wait to go back.",,,

18,Emily W.,"New York, NY",215,98,80,5.0,9/27/2017,"This is such a cool-looking place! Without the pool tables, it could easily be a club. I'm not super familiar with pool halls, but I really enjoyed my time at this one. My company rented out the entire space for a party, and I appreciated how there was just as much space for people to play pool as there was for people to just sit and talk with their friends. The people working the bar were really nice and tried their best to get drinks out as quickly as possible, despite the high volume of people ordering. The drinks themselves are really good! They could be a little stronger, but I definitely don't mind not tasting the alcohol. Also, the staff was amazingly fast at clearly out any empty glasses, making sure the place looked neat at all times. I would definitely recommend Space Billiards!",,,
19,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,3.0,12/14/2016,"Small Pool hall located in KTown... this is not in any way a nice place, but it certainly is fitting of the expectations for a divey pool hall... The service is super friendly and nice! They have about 10 tables that are paid for by the hour. They have a full bar and extensive cocktail listing. They have some bar like food, they order it from next door so usually takes about 30 mins.",4,1,1
20,Claire Q.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/16/2018,WOW! Popcorn and space. I wore a space helmet and played hand pool. No one kicked me out. The lights!

21,C G.,"Dallas, TX",0,114,52,4.0,3/18/2018,"Went for a birthday celebration, they were on point with drinks being served quickly but they can't split the bill which makes paying for like 20ppl very difficult when people are coming and going over many hours.

25,AJ S.,"Sunland-Tujunga, Sunland-Tujunga, CA",0,4,0,5.0,4/10/2018,"Space is excellent, whether you're a regular to Manhattan or just touring. It's on the 12th floor of a non descript building. Excellent lighting. Attentive staff. Very clean. There were employees wiping dust from everything at the end of the night. Table tops are a bit worn and slick but professional size. Spacious space. Definitely recommend",,,
26,Laura F.,"Syracuse, NY",11,1,0,1.0,5/24/2018,I never leave reviews but I had to for this place. When we walked in we were barely greeted and given a set of pool balls and a menu with no further instructions. After picking a table we decided to go to the bar and get a drink. We sat at the bar that wasn't busy for at least 10 minutes as the staff completely ignored us. Finally an employee came up to us and told us we had to order from our table and left. When we got back to the group we had to ask the people next to us how they ordered because the staff wouldn't give us any other type of instructions. Throughout the night the staff would barge right in front of us to get to their back room and in one circumstance pushed past my friend without saying anything. The bathroom was dingy and had a pile of boxes. Their were also empty popcorn boxes piled underneath our table. Save your money and go somewhere where the staff actually cares about their customers.,2,1,
27,Jasmin A.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,4,1,5.0,2/18/2018,"If you're looking for a chill spot to play some pool, darts or just enjoy the night this is the place to be. Awesome place! Service is on point! Shout out to Jenny the waitress, she's amazing! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could!",,,
28,Annette O.,"New York, NY",39,53,363,2.0,11/7/2016,As soon as I walked it smelled like bleach.  Rugs are old and dingy looking red tape all over the benchs to cover aging.  Didnt even want to get a drink everything looks old and worn.  Atmosphere was quiet music was ok.  I don't recommend it to any one.  Gross Gross Please don't waste your time or money,,2,
29,Kunal M.,"San Diego, CA",224,3,5,1.0,3/27/2017,"This is the most overrated place for pool in Manhattan. As vacationers, we came on a Sunday cause it was our last night looking for a fun place to hang out. The waitress greeted us saying that it was $29  FOR AN HOUR of pool. The place looked cool so I decided to pay for it. Aside from the fact that it is EXPENSIVE... the service was extremely rude and insulting. When I was getting ready to pay her she question me to say that we need to pay her before the game. I have never had such terrible service at a cool  place before. Please take your business elsewhere.Also as I left there was a sign saying leave a good review for a free shot. So this yelp rating is probably inflated because of that",2,,
30,Hoyuet L.,"New York, NY",33,11,6,5.0,5/30/2017,"The bartender here took care of us on a tuesday night, billiard here is affordable for an hour, quite quite on a tuesday night too",,,
31,Quandra T.,"New York, NY",81,112,21,5.0,3/18/2017,"Came last night for a friend's birthday get-together. We were hit by the ambience the second we walked off the elevator, and me and my friend OoOhed and Aaahed at the lights and decor like schoolchildren. The next thing to impress me was the drink menu. They were standard NYC pricey, but the FLAVORS. Their mixed drinks included Mango Man, Love Potions, and the unicorn JOLLY RANCHER. It's like these drinks were created with me in mind; sweet, tasty, enjoyable-to-drink mixes that pack a punch. I think I gulped through the Love Potion in like 5 minutes without realizing it because there was no cringey liquor-aftertaste.Impression #3: Free popcorn! :D I love it when bars provide free snacky things while you drink. It makes all the difference! They just handed us a bowl as we sat at the bar.I think pool might have been a bit pricey, but that's probably why you drink at the same time, lol, so it doesn't matter as much. I also felt comfortable enough to open a tab here, which says a lot (if you remember from a previous review :P)Impression #4: They gave us a round of shots on the house! And those who know me know I suck at shots. This one was nothing! They used whatever sweet-drink-mix magic they had up their sleeves to make it the most enjoyable shot I've ever taken.Bonus: Near our pool table was a door to a fire escape that people went out to take smoke breaks on. Thank you for not minding the fact that we all rushed out their to take pictures and such for fun. :P Staff and bartenders were all super friendly, and CUTE! I wanted that staff member's skirt!I just realized we didn't get a chance at the dart board! Next time though.Love discovering places I have a great time at, and would definitely return!",2,,
32,KiChan S.,"Woodside, NY",76,2,0,5.0,6/2/2017,This place is located in ktown where is known for late night karaoke and 24 hrs restaurants.This hidden pool bar is spotted 12th FL but you can easily excess via elevator from 1st floor so you don't have to worry about. The place is big and has lots of cocktails menu which is pretty cool for chill out or date. They also offer chess and darts. Pool tables are super clean and you can order drinks and foods from a table if you press a button on a table. Foods take some time but they also offer free popcorn too. I'd recommend this place if ur expecting fun night.,,,

They don't have their own kitchen, they use some other restaurant's kitchen next door, they were really backed up, yatta, yatta, yatta...  At that point, we were enjoying the pool, so we said ""Let it roll"".  While the apps came sooner than that (only about an hour!) the food was cold & no better than what you might expect from your local grocery's frozen foods section.  Still giving the place 4 stars, b/c who the hell goes to a pool hall expecting fine cuisine?",,2,
35,Tashana B.,"Brooklyn, NY",499,143,120,4.0,1/30/2016,"I love this place!This place is very easy to miss walking by. If Google Maps wasn't my homie, I would have blown by it. It is located in a tight, narrow building in Korea town labeled 34-36 in bold letters thank God. I came here last night with a group of friends intending to play pool, which is what this place is known for. We did not end up playing pool but we had a surprisingly great time anyway. Space Billiards is located on the 12th floor. Upon walking in, the mix of techno and hip hop music and flashing strobe lights hits you. I love the vibe of this place.There is a bar area, a tiny lounge section, and the pool table area. They have a good amount of pool tables so you don't have to wait long for one. We asked for pricing and they told us Fridays are $23 for a table for two people for one hour. An $29 for one hour for a table for 4. We sat and stayed in the tiny lounge section. We ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings (10 pcs) for $10. They were so delicious, we ended up ordering 3! They also come with 4 dipping sauces: soy, hot sauce, barbecue, and ketchup. They also gave us a complimentary bag of popcorn for the table. I also got the chicken tenders at $10 but I enjoyed the dumplings more. One of the orders of the dumplings came out half super cold. We had already eaten the majority of it but the latter 5 pieces were pretty cold. We told the staff and they apologized and gave us a fresh new full batch. They then gave us 3 SAKE shots on the house! Really cool. And good customer service! 5 cool points for that. For drinks, my sister got the Mai Tai for $11. It was beyond delicious! It made me regret ordering the $9 Cosmopolitan, which was not bad at all, but not as good as the Mai Tai. Keep in mind, we ordered these drinks before 8pm (happy hour). So I am not sure how much the drinks would cost after 8pm if there is a price change; it may only be by about $2 or $3 more.  I am so happy I found this hidden gem. I hadn't heard of it beforehand and am very pleased with the service and atmosphere. I can not wait to come back here and experience pool playing and mor of their amazing drinks and food!",14,8,10

The food was excellent along with a great atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and service was very efficient. I wanted to ensure that my cocktails were good. The clientele is more hipster than flapper and the music more 2017's than 2010's but the ice comes in chunks and the creative Soju flavor cocktails they serve are tops around K-town.

Good place to hang out with friends while playing at the same time eat and drink. The place is so good for pictures, kinda like on the space with its lights. We went there wednesday and the crowd is just right but the music is not just our genre, well it's midweek. I guess music is more trendy on weekends. So far so good.",1,,

And since its been awhile since I last played a pool, my game was a bit off. Space billiards is located on the 12th floor and the ambiance is kinda okay with all the laser lights. We didnt get a chance to try out the drinks they offer and the place wasn't crowded when we arrived (Fri. 4pm). We stayed for only an hour and it cost me $27 for 4 person playing on 1 table.I'm going to try other billiards place in the future and definitely would love to be back in here.",,,

I didn't really consider that to be a lot at all since we all played. I think they have a $21 for 2 people per hour pricing. I love the atmosphere. The neon lights and music makes the perfect environment. The tables are smaller though. Not sure if that is the only size they have. The drinks are strong apparently. The other times I came, the service was also quick and I could always find a table. The place is also right next to the herald square subway, good for commuters.",,,

46,Simon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1,3.0,5/22/2016,"I went around midnight tonight and shot some pool for a couple of hours. Positives:Quite a few tables.Nice atmosphere. Mix of Hip Hop/Pop/Rap music. Not terrible.You can get an amazing view of the Empire State Building if you pop your head out the side windows. Wouldn't advise looking down though, if you're scared of heights (like I am lol).The attendants are very nice. Not too pushy, but they handle their business.Negatives:Prices seem a bit high I.e. $23 for 2 people for 1 hour on Saturday nights.Cues and felt on the tables were of questionable quality. They get the job done for a casual game though.Way too hot. This one is questionable, as I really get into the game and work up a sweat, so it may have just been that. I leave that up to you to decide.Cramped quarters. Tables are close to walls/seats as well as nearby tables. You will have to dodge around due to other players, and that can eat up a fair amount of playtime. It doesn't help that they assign you a table themselves when you buy a slot. Although I figure I could have just asked them for a distant one instead, so that last one may be on me.Overall:It's a nice, fun little place if you're already in the area and want to shoot around a bit. I'd say there are better options if you're looking for serious play.",3,,1
47,Erina E.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",37,14,22,5.0,11/22/2016,"I don't really play billiards usually but this place has the feeling of club/lounge and I like it. They have happy hour till 8pm and it's $17 an hour during happy hour for 2ppl. It's pretty cheap, even places in Queens are more expensive than here. They have good happy hour drink deals too (I love happy hour cheap drinks, who doesn't??)I like the interior and music!!

57,Ismael L.,"Hialeah, FL",1,11,26,5.0,1/24/2017,"On my fifth trip to NYC the highlight of it was Space Billard. I am a traveler that is always on the hunt for local spots and man did I find a gem here. To start the building does not have an obnoxious sign to inform you that they are located here (like that of a luxury hoTel chain some love some hate). You walking into the lobby of the building and a gentleman asks you where you are going. You take an elevator to the 12th floor where the doors opens up to a dimly lit place whose brightest light source are those lamps above each pool table. Here you won't find tourist like you would in the time square area. This is more of a local spot. The ambience is super chilled and the music selection, for my opinion, was superb. I really can't wait to go back to NYC so that I can revisit this place. I was left with a profound infatuation for this place which I hope can flourish to something more.",1,1,1
58,Chris N.,"South Plainfield, NJ",117,54,15,5.0,3/27/2017,We got a table pretty quickly at 11pm on a Saturday. Love that there is table service for each table. Drinks came fast when ordered.

59,Ron L.,"New York, NY",1080,409,2175,4.0,8/4/2014,"Came here primarily to drink but others come here for billiards. Who knew? Let's do both! I honestly can't remember the last time I shot pool though.As expected, a bouncer cards people upon entering at the elevator. To play pool, walk over to the bar to the left and ask for a table. Here's where you order drinks and they'll bring those along to you over at your table. We didn't have to wait long for a table even on a busy night fortunately, so that's a plus.Ordered enough for three carafes/bottles of flavored soju for 3-5 people and billiards became tons more fun (the same can be said of bowling too).  The servers do stop by from time to time to gather empty bottles and that's when you can order more or the alternative being to order again at the bar.  You pay upon closing the pool/bar tab.Mind you, they do charge extra the more folks you bring along but it's still a good place to bleed off time until you venture off to the next venue. Who ventures to ktown to do just one thing anyway, right? Go big or go home!All in all, it's one of several great places I'd like to hang out in a fun, smoke-free environment.",3,,1

61,Kino A.,"Indianapolis, IN",79,185,251,3.0,1/23/2016,"A cool concept.  It was hard to find since you actually had to go inside a building and take an elevator to the 12th floor.  On the way up, the 9th floor opened up which was poppin as well with karaoke night.  The door closed for us to go to the top floor.  Once you enter, they check your ID and on the left is a very loungy bar.  Neon lights with bartenders making decent drinks.  We came here to play billiards which took up the other 75% of the venue.  For a pool/bar, the tables were really clean kept.  The balls were smooth and not dented and the table had good friction with no dips and dents - I was surprised.  It's a nice hangout spot to play pool and drink with music from the bar that wasn't too loud to affect your game.We ordered the chicken nuggets and it wasn't good.  It did satisfy the drinking crave but I wouldn't suggest buying those since it's typical bar food.  The servers were attentive and we played for an 1 hr while drinking beer and liquor.  I was just surprised that they kick you out of the table after an hour.  Apparently it's not a rolling time here, after one hour they stop you from playing which I didn't get.  We were going to stay there another hour but needless to say since they kicked us out we decided to leave.On a further note, it's a non-smoking bar but they have a balcony at the back for the smokers.",,,
62,Melissa R.,"Paterson, NJ",2,12,5,5.0,2/19/2016,"This is my favorite billiards spot! I think I'm becoming a regular here, driving in every other week from jersey because the attention is great, the music is always good, and the drinks are perfect. It's a semi small spot on what I believe is the 12th floor... Elevator opens up to a cute lounge area and about 12 pool tables. They apparently serve food but I haven't been there early enough. They close pretty late (I usually leave around 5 am on weekdays, oy vey). Zero complaints.",,,

The free popcorn is pretty sweet too.  Oh, they also have Spotify which you can go add songs for the never ending playlist.  This to me is a HUGE plus.",,,

66,Tommaso S.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",18,105,121,3.0,11/17/2015,"One of the adjectives Google uses to describe this place is ""upscale"". Hmm not exactly the first word that springs to mind...nothing says ""upscale"" like beaded door curtains to the toilets. The pros: it pretty much does what it says on the tin - it's a chilled place, spacious, with a decent number of pool tables and a bar. It's pretty quiet if you go mid afternoon and gets livelier and more fun as the evening progresses. Reasonable hourly rates for the tables.The cons: If you want to come here for a serious game of pool this is probably not the place for you - the queues are all a bit knackered (mostly straight but wonky tips); the felt on the tables i've played on is worn almost to the point of transparency, meaning you can pretty much forget about positioning/controlling the queue ball.",,,

71,John S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,0,1.0,5/13/2017,"At first this a very cool Billard hall. On the busy 34W 32nd street in Korea town, it's almost like a speakeasy in the sense that it's not easy to find because there are no visible signs. But when I finally made it to the 12th floor I felt like I was walking into a club  rather than a pool hall. It felt like a club because of the Loud hip hop music and it being very dimly lit. It is a great place to go on a date to impress someone you like a lot. First off, the tables are $23 an hour, and if you exceed the hour by a minute you get charged for an extra half hour. Once I got to my table I could tell it was best up a little, a few scratches and holes in the felt. Their selection of beer is limited and like the price for the pool table, pretty high. The cocktail Waitress had no personality whatsoever and was a bitch to us when we inquired what beer they had and asked her to repeat what she had said over the loud music, and the fact that English probably wasn't her first language and she had an accent so that made it difficult as well. After leaving I felt cheap and ripped off, it felt like I went into a strip club and asked for the champagne room and didn't get what paid for and originally expected. The icing on the cake was that they bill your pool play and drinks together, a way to boost up the gratuity. Another way they boost up the gratuity is by adding 15% to the bill and not point it out to you. Nice to see a place like this, but I rather play pool at Eastside billiards. More friendlier staff, happy hour prices, and better pool tables.",,,
72,Angela S.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,10,12,5.0,1/17/2015,"The reviews (4 or better) are on point! A group of us were in the city from NC, and we were looking for a place to hang out and shoot around for a while. This place is definitely worth checking out, if you enjoy a friendly game of pool with your homies. It's easy enough to find and get to. It's a regular neighborhood pool hall. That means the tables are decent, and if you want a perfectly straight stick...bring your own. Remember...this isn't an ESPN venue, so don't expect ""top 'o the line equipment"". But between the great music, late hours (open til 5 a.m.), nice crowd, helpful security staff (Hey Jay!), the hostesses/wait staff, and the Soju flowing like water, this place is a find, especially for an out-of-towner.Oh! And as for the people who were complaining or confused about the pricing, it works like this. $21/hour gets you a table for two people. If you have more people in your party, add $3/head, whether they play or not. You'll be charged a minimum of 1 hour. So I suggest you plan to shoot around for at least that, since you'll be paying for the time anyway. After the first hour, based on your party's size, the $21/hour + $3/additional person/hour is prorated by the minute. Party of 4 = $27 for the 1st hour and $0.45 each minute after. Simple. Thought I'd do the math for you, because once you get a couple of Soju shots under your belt...won't NOBODY have time for damn math. Hwanho! (Korean for Cheers!)",7,6,3
73,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401,4.0,12/31/2014,"So post dinner, we were looking for a good place to hang out.  Yelp told us Space Billiards so we trusted the app and went in to the 12th floor of a high building in Koreatown.  And honestly, we could not have made a better decision because Space Billiards is a great place.  The staff greeted us kindly and directed us to a table immediately.  The price is also not bad ($45 for ~2 hours on an off-happy hour time for 5 people in one table, but they do have happy hour so highly recommend that).  Everything is clean and well-stocked.  There are seats and tables to just hang out which is nice.The only thing that I would say is that it does get crowded as in your cue may tap someone else from another table, but that's only because the place is a tad bit small because it's in Manhattan.",6,,2

MOST EXPENSIVE billiards place I've ever been to in the Tri-State NYC. These people will take every penny they can get from you.If you have a friend at the table (even if they're not playing) they WILL charge you for having that extra person. If you're there alone and want to shoot with someone else... BAD MOVE. They will make up a price and you'll have to pay for it.I'm not going to argue with them because that's basic customer service. If that's how they conduct their business then that's on them. I'll just go on here to warn people and hope people take my word for it.If you want to shoot some pool with friends and actually have a decent time, I recommend Amsterdam.",4,1,1

It was pouring rain so I decided to go back to the bar and use the bathroom, the bouncer acted like an incompetent. He asked me if I had lost something because I was back at the bar and I told him no, that I had returned to use the bathroom and to wait for my taxi but he didn't want me to be in the bar. He told me that his supervisor didn't care the amount of money I had wasted in the bar before that I shouldn't be in the premises. I ended up having to leave and wait for my taxi downstairs. I will not be going to this pool hall again and I don't recommend other people to go there. They do not know how to deal with costumers and it is obvious that if you are not spending money you can't be there.

Lots of lights and lasers, and lots of electronic music (which my husband isn't too fond of, but it was fine for what we were doing...as long as he doesn't have to dance to it haha).

85,Matthew K.,"New York, NY",629,129,1,4.0,12/7/2013,"Much to like about this billiard cafe (which mostly operates as a small billiard hall, with a small bar of a half dozen seats or so.)  This is one of the most generously populated spaces around when it comes to screens.  There must be a dozen or so TV's in what's probably a 30 by 60 space.  No shortage of viewing time here!There are a few food options--mostly hand food, ramen, and the sort.  Drinks are decently priced and if you come here regularly enough, you'll get a freshly made bag of popcorn with just about everything you order.  I'd recommend a soju mixture of some sort in a bottle, or the space shots (7 for an agreeable $22).  Prices are $19 for a pair each hour, $10 if you run solo.  $22 for three people on a table and $25 for four.  The tables and sticks are not outstanding but in decent enough condition.  Much more of a lounge-y feel than an old-school classy billiards hall feel given the clubby/top 40-heavy play list.  Feel free to bring your newbie pool friends here--there are always a few people turning heads for the wrong reasons.The staff is friendly and wiling to talk things through.  The process of getting a table is also very quick here--standing around for minutes watching the staff chat up with regulars may happen at other billiard halls but not here.   I usually see a rack of balls hit the table ready for me before I've even walked up to the bar.Don't forget to get a punch card!  10 hours = 1 free hour.",6,2,1
86,Michael N.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,0,4.0,8/8/2015,"Location is a bit tricky to find. But eventually found it. As soon as you go in there is someone to greet you. We went a bit late at night so all tables were taken and had to wait a while. But it wasn't s big deal. Sat at the bar and had a few drinks. Keep in mind that there is no food in this location. So I would highly suggest you eat before you come here. They do give you popcorn but still that wouldn't be enough if you plan on being there for a few hours. The bartender was pretty nice. We had only got 2 beers and soon after gave us both 2 free shots. So really awesome. Once we got our table. It's just game on. There are seats all over the place to sit or place your stuff. The staff was really great. They always check up on you to make sure you if you need anything. At one point a great was playing Foosball near us and one of the staff came up to me and asked me if they were in our way or bothering us. But they weren't a bother so I said it was fine. And she replied ""if at anytime you would like me to ask them to move just let me know."" So really accommodating! Once we left and closed out our tab and bartender gave us 2 more shots!So overall great experience. Yes you are paying to play billiards but it is worth it considering you have the table all to yourselves with no one bothering you or feeling like you need to rush or even waiting to play like you would at a bar.

90,Gregory H.,"Bronx, NY",32,11,0,4.0,1/25/2014,"I frequently visit this pool hall on the weekdays after work to blow off some steam. Why? Because of the convenience of location, train access, and crowd capacity. I never have to wait for a table. Of course it is much more crowded on the weekends, but you should expect that. The only reason I will not give this place 5 stars is because of their poor beer selection. The price has also gone up from $17 to $19, however if you play for two hours, the third hour is free, which if you're like me and love shooting pool, you will cherish that free hour. One final caveat, If you smoke there is a section toward the back where you can open a door to stand outside and puff away.Also, this is a nice date spot, because the pool hall is not the only venue in this building.

Now that they've all graduated and have returned to Korea, I don't find myself here as often. But I've definitely made some great memories here.How time flies by so quickly...",1,,
94,Monica T.,"New York, NY",88,635,574,4.0,5/14/2013,"The most non-ghetto pool place in the city! This place is clean and not too packed (we came here on Friday night after work)Beers are $6 or 7 a pop, pool is $19 per hour up to 3 people. Super friendly staff and very accommodating. They happily let us enjoy our bonchon wings while drinking beer and fueling up for double couple pool tournament! Everything is in good shape and we all just had a great time playing. Definitely a good place to come hang out.",3,1,
95,Alyssa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,46,69,4.0,7/6/2013,"Came here last night for the first time, and it's a pretty cool place! This is actually the first billiards place I've been to and it was such a welcoming environment. For a Friday night, and being there from 8-11ish, there were always a few tables open! The crowd was a very diverse mix, and everyone was having a good time. I wasn't embarrassed by the 10 times I scratched or accidentally hit the 8-ball in (I swear I'm just rusty). All the beers are $6, and they had a good selection. The staff was diligent about collecting the empty bottles as soon as we were finished, and they also dropped off a bag of popcorn for us when we started our first game, which was cute! Tables are clean and well-kept.I think it's awesome this place is open 24/7. They gave us a card at the end too- after 10 hours of play, you get one hour free. I'll definitely be back with my friends! Oh, and before I forget, the music was hilarious. It was going from trance to gangster rap then Miley Cyrus. Best song of the night by far was ""every day I'm hustlin"".. that's my shiet!",1,2,2

Can you imagine that we paid 43 bucks for an hour and ten minutes (and we were supposed to pay more cause obviously when you play 10 min more than an hour, you have to pay twice the $6 extra charge that comes because you're 4 people). When you can pay $1 in any pub for a nice time with nice service, why would you pay $27 an hour... and $1 per extra minute...",2,1,1
104,Ranley K.,"Songshan District, Taiwan",102,441,545,4.0,12/12/2010,"So I came into the city to head over to SpiN to play some ping pong. Unfortunately, it was completely booked for the night. (Wow) We were still in the mood for some activity that involved drinking and sports, so I yelped billiards. Space Billiard was the first one that came up. We called in advance and asked if there were any tables available and they said there was plenty.We had a little tough time finding the elevator to get up to the 12th floor, but eventually made it. The place was very clean and a good variety of top40 remixes going off the speakers. The tables they had seemed pretty well maintained. I do have to say that the cue sticks could have been a little better. 4/5 of the sticks that I picked up were bent beyond belief, but I did see a lot of the people in the place that brought their own sticks. So I assume it's been like this for awhile.Bottom Line:For $17 bucks an hour (not counting per person too!) you can't go wrong. They do charge $2 extra per person if your table has more than 4 people at it. When we were there there was a $5 bottled beers and cocktails. Not the greatest selection of alcohol, but I think it suits the setting. I am sure the last thing they want are very drunk people ruining the atmosphere. Highly recommend if you're in the lower east side area and just want to hang out and chill.",1,,

106,Brian G.,"Los Angeles, CA",411,887,49,5.0,4/4/2011,"Oh yes.  Unlike the smoke filled dinghy pool halls of yesteryear, Space Billiard Cafe offers up a clean and spacious place for you and your entourage to chill out.  It's hard to gauge what merits a fifth star for a pool hall since so many places are just a dump.  I just couldn't find anything significant to complain about with SBC.  There are plenty of tables (20+), tables are vacuumed after play, music requests are taken, plenty of flat screen TVs to watch the game, fairly priced drinks and free iced tea, clean bathrooms, and finally its 12th floor location gives this just the right amount of hidden appeal anyone would want in a pool hall.  Plus, easy access to bars and late to 24 hour eateries in K-town make this an ideal fun hang out destination.For a chillaxing pre-dinner or late night activity, SBC is now one of my favorite NYC destinations.",,,

Stayed til almost 5a and by then most of the tables were in use.Only tricky part was finding the place. The sign outside the door isn't very large and then you go inside and take the elevator to the right floor. It's definitely weird, but once you get up there, it's definitely not that sketchy.We got a few bottles of the pomegranate wine - very sweet and definitely contributed to hangover the next day. And part way through they gave us some popcorn (can't dislike that). But no water - just bottled :(",1,,

We had a few drinks at a previous bar so we just shot pool. Everyone in the venue is nice and the equipment is in good shape. Nothing really popped or stood about the place which is why it doesn't get a whopping 5 stars. But I would definitely return.,,,

My friends didn't until we took the elevator to the suave 12th floor.Very spacious and relaxing atmosphere. Tables for 4-ball and American pool playing. And timers at each table so you can't argue about playing time at the cashier.Pool sticks are on point, straight overall. Some tables are newer, but all look very playable. Tv's available showing sports highlights and games.A very nice play to relax for $17/hour per table.Definitely coming back here after a nifty meal in K-town.",10,4,10

The good:-Timers at each table, pay by the minute ($17/hr for the table total). Best deal I have found in the city.-$5 bottles of beer-Pool tables in good shape-Not at all crowded at 10-11PM on a Saturday nightThe bad:-They won't give you a glass of water- bottles only-Not much of a social/pool hall feel to the placeThe weird:-This place seems sketchy from the outside. It's on the 12th floor of a building with 2 typical K-town karaoke bars on other floors. The elevator opens up to a huge, dark room with strobe/disco lights all over the place.-Cup Noodles (the ramen in a styrofoam cup that you just pour boiling water onto) is a menu item. This is a first for me, haha.-The windows are covered up by fake bricks printed on plastic sheets.",,1,

Not sure if they polish the pool balls here regularly either.There is good clearance around the tables, though.It's K-Town's attempt at a billiards place, but it's not serious. Not sure if they have leagues here. Whenever I go it's ratchet from people who just came from soju shots, or its dead quiet. I recommend you come when you've had a bit to drink.

It's a $21 flat rate for 2 people for one hour but an additional $3 for each additional person, even if they don't  play.

120,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1846,4.0,1/23/2012,"The cheapest way to play pool is to just go to a bar with a pool table (like Bleeker Street Bar) but sometimes you need a pool hall for a party, the space, or the quality of the tables. In checking out all the pool halls in Manhattan, Space Billiards is actually the best in my opinion. It's the cheapest (though still pricey at about $19/hr), is open 24 hours, is almost always mostly empty, has some couches for seating, serves alcohol (average prices), and has a giant fire escape in the back for smokers that offers an impressive view of the Empire State Building if you go up a couple steps.

The place looks like a clean and spacious pool hall with lots of billiard balls dangling from the ceiling. The menu offering is very ""Korean"" if you get the description; there are small snacks, stacks of instant noodles that can be purchased, fried stuff, etc. Beers come in bottles and are $5 each.The pool tables are in great shape and so are the equipment. There's a $17 per hour charge for a table for use by up to four people. If you have more people than four, it is an additional $2 per person per hour.I'd definitely check it out if you are in the area and want an easy place to sit and relax.

The place is CLEAN and the equipment is in great condition. As soon as we walked in, it was obvious we were going to have a wonderful time. The music was ON POINT, the drinks were even more ON POINT, and there was a great ambiance. The employee was very nice. No complaints there.We were one of the only people there on a Tuesday afternoon, when they opened, but that was fine!! We couldn't help dancing as we were playing pool.Their rates are fair! The first hour is $17, and afterwards, it's $3 every 10 minutes. The third hour is free, but we didn't stay that long.We ordered drinks during the game, and might I say that the drinks justify the price. Rarely do you see an establishment in NYC charging $11 for a drink that isn't watered down. The guy who made our drinks brought us popcorn to accompany our drinks, because they were that strong.

The veggie dumplings were so good it comes out on this really long plate, makes you look like you're eating a lot but I wanted more even when I was done lol. The music they played was really good. My friend asked the bouncer to play 5 songs and he literally played those 5 songs. A bouncer who controls the music? Weird but I'll take it lol. The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a Karaoke bar/billiard fusion. I guess I was too drunk to know that before we arrived. There was a private karaoke party going on and this guy was literally singing Ordinary People by John Legend like he was trying out for The Voice. He sounded great but when you are trying to turn up Ordinary People is not a song of choice hahah. Also I wanted to look at the song selection and the bartender came up quick as shit like ""excuse me, this is private party"" I was like okay I can't even get a peak? It wasn't that serious I wasn't going to sing anyways. Overall I had a lot of fun. I love playing pool and while you play pool you can order drinks and food and they bring it to your area. Probably wouldn't go here again because Koreatown is far as hell for a little Brooklyn girl, but that was the middle area for me and my CT friend lol.",,,

We played three games for about 1.5 hours and it costed $23. So cheap. Music was general pop songs, not much of our type but was ok. Had beer, all are $6 per bottle. They also serve Korean soju and soju cocktails.",1,,

142,Jeff G.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,55,6,4.0,9/1/2009,"This place is what I've been looking for in a pool hall. Pros: Spacious, open 24hrs, not known to be crowded, affordable beverages (especially at the NYC rate), very well maintained and efficient tables as well as pool sticks, very comfortable seating, good music (but everybody's taste differs, so..), nice lighting, great overhead televisions, decent prices, and most importantly to me - the atmosphere is not overwhelming nor intimidating at all. Finally, a black guy such as myself can get a brew and shoot pool in the city without everybody staring (far from racist, but that's how it can be in the city).Cons: No varieties of beverages/foods, the elevator you take to get there can be outright scary (shaky and slow as hell).Overall: 4 stars - This place is great for the billiard enthusiasts, welcoming enough for your group of friends, yet not intimidating for those who want to go solo and shoot around - all while enjoying a quick drink and a beautiful atmosphere.",3,1,1

144,Antonio M.,"Manhattan, NY",37,36,11,2.0,9/27/2011,"Went here with some friends when we were looking for something to do on a thursday night i believe. As a fan of billiards, i was dissapointed to say the least. they only serve beer and wine and the wine was cheap but still overpriced for what it was. the place was half empty (not half full) and so the ambience was lacking to say the least. its more a pool hall for people that dont know the game and just want to hit balls with sticks. i didnt see bridge cues and you cant masse or anything like that. the music is a weird mix and if you want them to play something itll cost you a dollar which would have been fine had i been able to hear my song but the sound system was so low and lacking quality that i heard a few words here and there when the hall got a bit quite at times. if it hadnt been for my friends who were there and frankly the only reason i enjoyed the place, it would have been the worse pool hall ive ever been to. it is not a place for people who really like pool, its more a hangout for people who want to give billiards a shot and have some good laughs with their friends...just make sure to bring your own music and your own ambience. i have to say they had some straight cues though. unfortunately they were fairly old and you couldnt read the weight on most of them",1,,

My friend and I played for about 2 hours on a cold, Saturday night. We got there (and there was no wait, yes!) and (the pool hall wasn't smelly or grimy, yes!). The majority of pool halls in AZ smelled like booze, smoke ( there's been a ban on smoking inside for a long time too) and who knows what.Back to the place - yes, k-pop was playing in the background. What else would you expect, it's k-town! They do have 3 LCD TVs playing different thing. Cheap-er beer specials ($4 beers) and some snacks. Total for two was 25.

Completely empty on a Saturday night, and I was shocked.What shocked me even more was the place itself.  This was one of the most beautiful pool halls I have ever been in, just astounding. New pool and snooker tables, new pool cues, new chalk, new everything. TV Screens were also new as well. Did I mention that its $15 an hour? Doesn't matter how many people are playing, its $15 an hour. How awesome is that? And the host was also nice enough to give us free hot tea, which was delicious. They also serve instant ramen, if you're in the mood for that. And if you want to get your drunk on, its BYOB so you're good there.

157,Zack H.,"New York, NY",6,63,0,5.0,4/18/2008,"----So here is my story part----This is a really interesting location for those of you who like to find ""hidden"" treasures in NY.  I was only introduced to the place after a friend of mine pointed it out to me when we were on our way back from getting food in K-Town.  Although it isn't strictly hidden as there is a small sign mostly in Korean with pictures that would indicate billiards exists on the 12th floor, it is not a place that I would have found on my own.  In fact, I might have walked by the small building entrance a hundred times before the sign appeared individually out of the crowd of chintzy restaurant advertisements.  Naturally, I had to give it a shot.  After finishing a short ride in a very dingy elevator, the doors to the elevator opened and I was blown away.The place is damned near spotless. There are dozens of tables, a snack bar, lounge-like seating, and it is crowded, but not full.  To be entirely honest, I felt a little out of place going there the first time because I am not Korean.  In fact, I'm the only white guy in the whole place (Actually, this is usually not the case, on later trips I've noticed that the crowd tends to be more diverse earlier in the night).  The rest of the clientele spans the spectrum from teeny-boppers to slightly thuggish asian gangster types to older businessmen taking their game very seriously.    We step up to the bar and order a table.Listen up, this part is important.They only have a few tables for American style Billiards.  Most of the tables are for a game called four-ball.  You cannot use four-ball tables for American Billiards, because the tables have no pockets.  The first time I went I was a little shy and just stuck to Billiards, but on subsequent trips I have learned to play four ball (the people  running the place are very friendly and even showed me how to play) and found it to be very entertaining.  In fact, that is mostly what I play when I go these days.  After playing for a few hours, my friend and I got ready to leave and grabbed the check.  It blew my mind.  It was so cheap. I did a double-take and payed  while in awe of this place's awesomeness.---Summary---*Nice pool tables*Really clean*Lounge like seating in some places*Snack/drink bar (only alcohol is beer)*Only a few American Billiard tables*Staff is really friendly*There is a door you can open to smoke out of*IT IS OPEN 24 HOURS*IT IS REALLLLLY INEXPENSIVE",2,1,2

The room was not quite half full so it was quiet. They serve coffee and tea but they allow you to BYOB.

The pictures, by the way, helped and gave me an idea of what to expect. Me and VR (who lives and works in Downtown NY), were more than happy to visit Korea Town for a change. At about 5:30ish we got off the metro and walked around a bit looking for SB Cafe. I was expecting to see some signs/board or something that indicated that this place really did exist. However, all we found was a big glass door with a tiny board with tinier prints that said that SB Cafe was on the 12th floor. After we got in to the elevator, I said to VR that if this place is even half as nice as what other Yelper's said it was, I will be super happy. The elevator door opened and we we got off right inside the Cafe. First thought that crossed my mind : I like this place!!Small and private with decent music, however, not much choice in alcohol. A great find and very clean compared to most places in the city. Mostly Korean/Asian kids around played only four balls. The only reason this place doesn't get 5star is because its slightly expensive than the usual place I go to in Boston. Overall I think I might visit SB Cafe again the next time I'm in NY.",1,,

Maybe there would be a happy ending!Not so. She left twenty minutes after we got there, nary flashing a smile the entire time. Sigh.Pleasantly surprised.

(yes, i'm taking credit for this secret discovery) i've been looking at the sign for months... wondering what kind of place it would be. every week we'd be in Koreatown, i'd be reminded to try it out sometime. well- it was a good call. in recent events- a lot of my friends have been bit by the ""pool bug"". we've been going to Astoria or Brooklyn to play- but why not a new venue? in our favorite neighborhood... our weekly stomping ground- Koreatown! i already had inhibitions about the elevator. mainly because... a few months back- in the summer time, we were scouting out some karaoke joints and Javier & i had an ""episode"" in the scary shaking elevator. the story is much funnier when i physically reenact it. lol. after our group got over our fears of this elevator- we were greeted with a sprawling penthouse of a pool hall. this is a beautiful, clean, spacious and classy pool hall oasis in the middle of Koreatown. hot sweetened tea is served to your party immediately. how kind. they have everything from Shrimp crackers to instant Ramen to satisfy your junk food craving. yes, no booze yet- but who doesn't love a BYOB joint? no complaints here. the multi-colored Crocs gives me anxiety... however, i was bold enough to try them on with my shoes still on. i couldn't bear to wear them completely. that's how sickening they are. i think it was the soju/makulee from our dinner that made me do crazy things.i liked the amenities truly catered to the pool player. from chalk to sleek score boards and plasma flat screen t.v.'s... i even liked the fact that your games are timed so that you don't go over your hour and end up paying extra. the front desk guy is the only one present... and there to serve you drinks, hot food or be your opponent in a Korean-style cushion/bump game. what a multi-tasker! $15 per hour, per table?!?! in the city?!?! in Koreatown?! hell yes.it's like heaven bestowed upon us and dropped off a pool hall just for me and my nocturnal gang. oh, it's 24 hours. can you believe that? it's a dream come true.",14,8,16
176,alex a.,"New York, NY",0,10,1,5.0,9/22/2009,"The manager told me that I am the most frequent customer here.And I believe it. I'd say I go there 5 days a week. Sometimes everyday.I am addicted to Korean style billiards (3 ball and 4 ball). It's so much more gratifying than pool. It's open 24 hours, I have a personal cue on the wall, I get complimentary time, snacks, and even play with the manager from time to time. I love that when the US Open was on I could watch it there and basically they'll tune to any sports game on TV if you ask them to. There are three TVs throughout the room. There are 13 tables (5 pool tables, 8 billiard tables), and they are all MUCH BETTER quality than some of the other places I've been to in the city (Fat Cat, etc.) so you can actually play a very decent game of pool here. It's 17 per hour so if you've got three people you're probably saving money over anywhere else. It's 4 bucks for a beer and they also have a restaurant/bar downtstairs which will bring food up if you order it. They have good fried chicken. They also have snacks on a rack there. They give me free iced tea in the summer and hot tea in the winter. I love this place!",1,,
177,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",607,618,78,5.0,3/30/2008,"***** Apologies in advance to those sensitive P.C. souls whom I may offend with the following review, for which I claim some small level of stereotype-joke immunity on the basis of my being a native of San Francisco (and hence my impliedly not being genuine in my un-P.C.-edness). *****Space Billiard reminds me of what I'd think a gay man would come up with in his ideal pool hall environment.  Allow me to expand on the scenario:1) Lovely setting with clean tables, clean room, pleasant lighting (not too harsh and not too dim), clean bathrooms, and decorative touches such as the fake-but-wait-are-they-REAL?? palm trees in cast iron pots at the corner. Who ever said a pool hall had to be dingy and fugly?2) 24 hours.  Because we all know how much you all love to par-tay.3) $15 per table per hour.  Yes, that's PER TABLE.  That means you can get four people and stuff 'em up in that single table and you each end up paying....*looks off to the side....draws a ""15"" in the air with finger...lemme see...carry the 2....*....um...end up paying NOT THAT MUCH.  Just kidding! I'm Asian -- of course I can do math.  You would end up paying $3.75 per person per hour.  (See? Now I can offend with the Asian stereotype joke, too, so none of you all feel left out.)4) Smiling, gracious, and hospitable host who serves up (FREE) sweet tea with a smile.  Because we all know you're ""happy."" I mean, you ARE gay, after all.5) Here's the kicker....there are around fifteen tables, and only three are full size pool tables.  The rest are tables with no holes.  That's right....so you have balls being knocked around the table by men wielding long sticks with no distracting holes in sight.  Hello, sausage fest.Thus concludes my presentation of the evidentiary facts...or rather, my interpretation of them.  I love those gay boys, though, so...to wit....I love this place.",8,18,9
178,Caroline A.,"Fairfax, VA",1128,1174,22,4.0,12/26/2007,"I always thought pool halls were smokey lounges with hookers and pool sharks. I hadn't been to a pool hall since 1997, so I was a bit skeptical as we went up the shakey elevator.  No smoke, clean tables and no riff raff here.  I'm not much of a pool player, but I had fun.  K-pop in the background and the nice guy at the front desk to ask any questions.  At $15 per hour per table, it was a very inexpensive evening.  We were here on a Saturday night too, and it was not busy at all.I would suggest that they crank the heat a bit because it's really cold!  Also, what's up with all the multi-colored Crocs???",5,3,6
179,Javier M.,"New York, NY",718,388,174,4.0,4/1/2008,"*Bias switch on*Now don't get me wrong, I heart Space Billiards but...No, let me begin with the good.Big room with many, many tables; you will never have trouble finding a table to shoot some pool; staff is *cough* friendly (if you come with or as a Korean), and unlike many other pool houses, Space is really neat and freshly shaved, which brings me to the bad:The clientele; a lonely bunch, too quiet for me to allocate it to the coincidence bucket... single straight men, single gay men, and no women. If I didn't happen to come here with a large crowd of mixed sexes, I'd prolly have a xanax moment. And speaking of xanax (or valium) you do need just that, as your patience will be tested; it just so happens that Space Billiards went so far up above and beyond the reach of Earth's gravity, that they don't have alcohol in the premises; instead, they need to ""beam down"" a Korean Scotty to go all the way to the basement bar (which is owned by the same owner) so that they can bring you your drink... At Space Billiards I've felt what those poor astronauts at the Space Station must've feel like when in a drought; waiting for the next Soyuz to come from Mother Russia with some Stolichnaya... so the hell I mind if I send Korean Scotty up and down, up and down, from Terra 1 to Space 1 to bring me one beer at a time..But hey, how the hell are you supposed to play pool with no brewskie in hand? You don't.So I'll keep my orbit in 3 and keep my finger on the teleporter switch every time I go up for a game of pool amongst the lonely stars.*Bias switch off*************************UPDATE: *le sigh* they got a liquor license. Hurrah. 4 stars. Just neglect 65% of the review up there. Thanks.",4,4,4

181,Tim C.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,35,0,5.0,3/31/2008,"Nice and mellow, easy-going, relaxed atmosphere.  Not clubby and not seedy.  Yeah it's K-pop music, but it's not blaring and blends nicely in the background with typical pool noises and quiet conversation.  There are 3 pool (pocket billiard) tables scattered amongst 10 carom billiard tables.  Maybe I don't know the right code words, but I asked for a carom table and the guy pulled out a set of pool balls.  Or maybe it's that I wasn't Korean.  I dropped by around 6pm on a Sat evening to check it out, went to dinner, and came back later to play for a couple hours.  It wasn't crowded at all, though they could use more spacing between the tables.  Nice butterfly cues and chalk at every table.  $15/hr, $10 minimum, and open 24 hours.  I'm definitely going back next time I'm there.",2,,1
182,L.A. B.,"Ridgewood, NY",2,17,5,1.0,8/27/2010,My friends and I planned to eat and play pool at Arctica but do to a private party taking place where their pool tables were. We went to play pool here. It looks nice inside and okay pricing on an hourly game. But what made this place soooo horrible was that we we're hungry and ordered food from them and paid it upfront. We didn't get a receipt and when the food came they told us that we have to pay for the food ( which we paid when we ordered)! We paid for our table time but he still wanted us to pay for the food we already paid for and argued with us. They allowed us to watch the video tape of the transaction that happened but because of the lack of light and camera angle you couldn't see who took the money we gave them which they denied and they thought we we're lying and made a racist remark about my friend being black and not having enough money that's why he couldn't pay! But we had extra money from being paid the day before from our jobs and not knowing exactly how much money we we're going to spend. So after being frustrated of the horrible camera angle of not showing the whole bar we decided to leave because those Koreans probably needed the money as much as the homeless guy down the block. It was such a bad experience. My advice is DO NOT BUY food or drinks from them and always ask for a receipt. I wished I would have gotten the cops involved because they were wrong and weren't good customer service.,,1,1

It's clean, the prices are extremely reasonable (15/hr) and it's just fun. The only downside is that the menu is limited, if you want anything beyond a beer, your better off  somewhere else.",,,
