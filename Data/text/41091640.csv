I was there with my wife for def leppar and journey. place is huge, we got a table and the lady that helped us was nice. we waited maybe 7 minutes for the appetizer (fried calamari) and maybe 20 for the main course.

The chicken warp (with cheddar and greens) was tender, but very bland. The shrimp flat bread (with ham, greens, and fresh mozzarella) fared a bit better but flavour was definitely lacking. Each was served with a side of limp fries.Location is a plus and service is very efficient, but set your expectations low.",12

My husband walked up to her and she said. Do you want me to check your order? We got up and left. People ordered full entrees around us, but we couldn't get a chicken sandwich and hamburger.

At first we weren't crazy about this place but after few visits it sort of became our regular spot. Nice bar with a friendly atmosphere. The drinks were reasonable priced considering It's only a block away from Madison Square Garden and Penn station. I can recommend the bar food, it was above average and definitely tasted good. The portions were large and good value. The service was very good. I found the staff to be very attentive. I think it's a perfect place to visit before going to Madison Square Garden...",5

Sent it back, came back warm, but just wasn't great. Asked for pickles- they didn't have any. They just kinda seem not ready to do impressive/good business.

Menu-wise, it's your classics - burgers, wraps, a few entrees. Prices are high due to the location. Because I am a boring soul, I had a cheeseburger and it was pretty good. A little greasy, but well seasoned and served with thick cut fries.Service was fine too - but again, it was lunch and the place was dead.

My son and I called ahead rushing to catch a Knicks game. They saved us a table and cooked our food so we would be able to arrive and sit and enjoy rather than rush.

The bartender refused to replace a beer that's piece of chicken fell into and made me pay for another one. When the manager asked her to give us a free round she said no and refused.

Only one of the amounts charged was correct, and the other two were fraud. I called and spoke with someone who was extremely rude and assumed that I was wrong about the incorrect charges. He insisted that the charges were actually correct, offering to ""check the cameras"" and told me a manager would call me back. Well, no one ever called. This place will rip you off by performing these acts of fraud for a decent amount of money! I do not recommend coming here.",

Stumbled across this place saw it was an Irish pub and thought it would be a good choice. Sat at the bar and the bar itself was pretty nice with a granite bar top that was very clean. Greeted fast from a native dubliner bartender. Well that's a good sign. 2 of the bartenders were actually Irish. They were ok personality wise, a little sarcastic and one of them kept going on his phone. Drinks were good and Guinness was poured right. I can't comment on the food because I didn't have any. I did like the atmosphere of the bar and the games they had on the tvs were a good selection. I also liked the 90s dance music they had playing in the background. Bartenders are eh, drinks are good. I'll probably be back for some drinks before or after doing stuff in the area.",2

Fifth star is not far off for this place, clean up your beer and draft selection, train your servers better with their beer knowledge and five stars would be a regular thing! I came in with my family, and even my nine year old daughter was comfortable, full and happy! I had the bangers and mash, thick gravy and smooth mashed potatoes! Amazing plate! The girls had fish and chips (fried here) and house soup and salad. We also had the Calamari which should be noted, moist and thick sliced. I must assume that they are cleaned and prepared here on site, as they are perfect. This place was a very good find and we look forward to visiting again!",

Wings were pretty good, crispy, hot and finger licking. Burger was cooked medium well and came on a brioche bun. Not much seasoning on the burger if any but it was good.

They're bready and doughy and so cheesy and melty and delicious. And yes, if you ask for them they will bring them to you no questions asked even if you're sitting in the restaurant menu that disgracefully leaves them out. I can now finally say, after eating there sober once in addition to the other two times, that they are delicious.Aside from that, the food is good. Pretty standard American food. I am a sucker for a good old-fashiioned burger any day of the week, and there's is satisfying. Cooked how I like, delivered by kind, attentive staff at a reasonable speed. Good place to go before a concert or after a night out, the price and the location is right.If possible, ask for a table in the upstairs section.

I stumbled upon Harrington's.  Seemed pretty inviting until I walked in and was smacked in the face by the smell of cat urine. Awful to say the least. I thought it may get better so I walked to the back of the bar and reluctantly ordered a beer. Overwhelmed by the stink I had to leave a review to warn others not to even bother walking in this place. My beer was cold and came from a bottle so I was pretty safe Definitely wouldn't have ordered food. I guess no one had a sense of smell.,

Rangers game at the Flying Puck, but it was as packed as I expected (if not more)... which is how I ended up at Harrington's. Harrington's a pretty mediocre bar. I mean, it's great they play Rangers games (with sound) and have your standard selection of beers on tap. But man, was I disappointed with the wings or what! There's just something about their hot sauce that just doesn't sit right with my taste buds. It was... tangy, which isn't a term I would ever want to associate with hot wings. The quesadillas were much better, in my opinion, with ample guacamole, sour cream, and salsa for each bite. Not the best ever, but better than the wings. Flying Puck may be crowded (and have just as mediocre food)... but the atmosphere makes up for it ten-fold. Next time, I think I'll just (wo)man up and cheer for the Rangers while crushed between two people at the Flying Puck. No more sad, tangy, sub-standard wings at Harrington's for me.",2

My friends were catching a bus back to DC right outside of this restaurant, so I joined them for a quick drink and bite to eat. The beer list was boring, but they did have a seasonal on tap (Sam Adams Octoberfest) so I got that. We also ordered some pricey apps -- chicken fingers, jalapeno poppers, and sliders. I didn't eat any of the sliders but tried the fingers and poppers. The poppers were incredibly hot, but it was the wrong kind of hot (caliente, not at all picante) and they came with some sad, flavorless white sauce that was probably cream cheese but could've been anything, really. The chicken was okay and was served with honey mustard.Our server was nice enough, I suppose. The five of us were all given full menus but we had to ask for a second drinks/apps menu, even though they knew that's all we were there for. The ambiance was nonexistent but at least the restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.Sorry that this review isn't very inspired... but I tend to draw inspiration from delicious and/or interesting food and drink selections.",

Especailly because I have been freezing my bottom off being in NY when Im a true AZ girl! Haha! The chicken wrap was decent.

From the outside this place looked like it would be pretty good. BIG MISTAKE! First of all, the service was awful, they were rude, including the manager, the waitress was irritable, and as lunch progressed we found out why. I ordered the nachos, and when they came the cheese was cold and congealed looking, I don't even know what kind of cheese it was. I told the waitress that it was cold and she asked, rolling her eyes if I wanted another one, I instead asked if I could just have a side of cheese that was warm. She then said I doubt it, the kitchen guys are real ""assholes"" (her words not mine), and they probably won't do it. I know what you're thinking, and you're right. we should have left right then. Few minutes later she brings back a little bowl of more cold weird cheese. So basically, I ate the chips and avoided the cheese. My daughter had the sampler appetizer plate, which was gross. Wings were small and slimy, chicken fingers were greasy, my mother ate the jalapeno poppers off of the sampler plate, and we would find out a little later what a bad idea that was. So we finished off our lunch and paid the bill, no visit from the manager about the bad food, nothing, not even a thanks for coming. After the 3.5 hour trip home, my mother-in-law got sick, and stayed that way all day and that night and the next day. She was the only one who tried the poppers.Did I mention the manager that never visited our sidewalk front table to see how lovely our time was? He was very near, appearing out of the front door area every few minutes to stand like a statue for a minute, or to hurredly grumble at wait staff, while physically guiding them to parts of the dining room.

And you pull the clothes out and you want to cut your nose off because the stench is just unbearable? Keep that smell in mind. We were all sitting at the table and the smell kept wafting in. We looked like crazy people as we tried to figure out where it was coming from. And then we did.Something must have happened with their towels they use to wipe things down and and they had used that to clean off the parmesan cheese container that my niece had used on her pasta. So the smell was coming from that AND her pasta. Horrifying. And when the manager (?) figured out that something was wrong, he came over and offered to rinse off the pasta instead of doing it over.

Standard fries were served immediately (read: properly) out of the fryer, making them equal parts crispy and starchy. The coleslaw was cool and crisp, scantily dressed in a little buttermilk that left it with a fresh taste, if that's possible for coleslaw.The service seemed a bit terse and uninterested, but that may be due in part to my instant dislikability as a person because every other person at the bar seemed to have their drink waiting for them when they finished scaling the high bar stools.Harrington's ceiling is 3 stars and it strikes me as a place that doesn't care much for reaching above that.

Appetizer: As an appetizer I ordered the shrimp bisque (which to my knowledge is usually thick and creamy), only to find that it was just watered down tomato soup with absolutely no shrimp! Entree: I had the crab cakes, which came with cauliflower, mixed veggies and the biggest mound of mashed potatoes I've ever eaten at once. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, which sucked because I couldn't stop eating them, but the crab cakes were mediocre and didn't taste like there was any actual crab in them.My friend ordered the ribs and fries, and they were decent, though obviously pot boiled and just slathered in BBQ sauce. No spice rub, no baking or browning. Pretty simple 30 minute ribs, so they were far from the best I've had.Dessert: They only had three options, which were cheesecake, chocolate cake, and key lime pie. I'm not a huge fan of the other two, so the cheesecake won by default. It was pretty good, but clearly not made there since it tasted like the boxed cheesecakes I normally buy.

Given that and for the portion size, it's hard to argue with the prices. My salad with literally a mountain on my plate and, after having stuffed myself, there's was still a sizable amount of food! The cheese steak was also good, with big chunks of steak, but the amount of french fries seemed disproportionately small.Though Harrington's seems a little run down, the service is pleasant and quick, the food is good and plentiful, and the window seat serves up entertainment all afternoon long.",2

A group of my friends went out to celebrate my 23rd birthday and we wound up at Harringtons. When we walked in, the place was pretty empty, so one would assume that the bartender would have welcomed the business of a group of people willing to show proper identification and money to spend. He took my friends order, who was white, and then when my Indian friend went to order, he said: ""I do not want to serve you. Once your friend is done her drink, I want you guys to leave."" Given that this is America and 2015, I did not expect to be met with such outright racism, especially since we were all willing to spend a large amount of money. I will never be going back to this place again, and I will continue to spread our story on other social media platforms.

I was misled by many of these reviews into thinking this was a more casual place than it is, but that would've been fine, if our waitress had had any clue about what she was doing, and if the kitchen could've fried up a grilled cheese.  As it was, though - terrible experience.  There's way too many restaurants around for me to ever give this one a second chance.",1

I wish now that we hadn't. Even thought it was about 1130, it was still rather crowded with the post-Ranger game crew, but we were able to be seated in the dining room right away. We should have known it would be a terrible meal, when we had to flag the waitress down just to enter our drink orders. She brought us our beer and very weak Tanqueray and tonic. We then proceeded to wait nearly 25 minutes for our chicken sandwiches. The one bright spot was the portion size; the sandwich was a very large size with a generous helping of fries on the side. It was lucky that we didn't require a refill on a drink or some ketchup, because we literally only saw the back of our waitress's head as she stood with the other servers and chatted for the duration of our meal. She did walk by us once, and I purposely tried to make eye contact with her, which she flat-out refused to do. (Just a tip - if you can, avoid this waitress - tall, long, bleached blonde hair, some sort of eastern European accent, miserable look on her face). When we finally had to ask the busboy (who, incidentally, also served our food) for the check, she did happen to walk by us again. My brother made a comment to her ""Thanks for not checking on us the entire time we were eating!"" To this, she turned around, came back to our table and leaned over us and said ""My shift is over, I'm just waiting for you to leave."" I was so shocked at the outright rudeness of this, I just couldn't believe it! In the end, she may as well not have waited, because she didn't get one cent of a tip from us. I've never in my life been so outraged by restaurant service.

After that he barely came to the table, never asked us if any of us wanted another drink throughout the whole meal. When leaving, we asked for a to-go box and they said ""I suppose."" Okay, great. Considering the place was empty and I doubt he had anything better to do, I don't think it was a big deal to serve one table.
