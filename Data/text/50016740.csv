0,Jeffrey R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,4,0.0,4.0,2/2/2018,"Jimbo's is One of my Favorite eaterys in the Tremont Area.Service is always welcoming and the Food has never disappointed me.I'm really Not big on Burgers but i would definitely buy there Cheese Burger Deluxe .I'm a Breakfast Fanatic,.I recommend the Pancakes, but i enjoyed everything i ate there..THE  1 NEGATIVE IS THEY DON'T EXCEPT CREDIT CARDS.CASH ONLY..?!  Large well known business should accept Major C.Cards.",,,
1,Chanel M.,"West Bronx, NY",30,14,18,5.0,4/13/2018,"Spicy Sausage, Egg &Cheese on a buttered Croissant to goooooooo!!!!!!!! Always fast and excellent service...",,,
2,Jennyfett O.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",96,24,18,4.0,4/6/2018,Their food is great I especially love the grilled chicken salad and the French fries. Their down call they don't take credit or debit and the delivery guy won't come to your door you have to meet him outside.,,,
3,Raul C.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/2/2018,I always pass by jimbos on my way to USPS and finally decided to give them a try. I ordered waffles with chicken and a bacon cheese burger with fries. The wait wasnt long and food was great. Workers were super friendly and the place had a positive vibe. Definitely going back again!,,,
4,Armani'Sanaa B.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",144,4,0,3.0,10/16/2017,"Friendly customer service,  food is good . If you eat to stay be prepared to hear spanish tv & music all day Delivery took a lil longer than I expected... but . It's good food . Very convenient.  A lil pricey for me. But again very convenient",,,
5,Eli M.,"Bronx, NY",17,37,5,1.0,12/27/2016,"Sorry but I just have to write this. I ordered mozzarella sticks, the sauce and the sticks where rotten, today I order a crispy chicken burrito and the meat was uncooked. NASTY! Called them and they just gave me a ""sorry"" and didn't even offer me an exchange.",1,,
6,Alvin D.,"New York, NY",116,67,106,3.0,1/14/2016,"They're very lucky I'm giving them 3 stars because the food is good but their service sucks. They're currently under construction but they say they are still delivering. Last week I called for a delivery for an omelette and waffles but they were rude the whole time. Additionally, with everything you order they try to upsell you in a nasty way. ""You sure you're not gonna get that?"" Etc. Present the upsell nicely and let me decide. Don't shove it at me like I'm dumb if I don't. Not everyone has your menu memorized. And they were short with they're sentences after they got what they want. After that everything you asked them you felt like you were annoying to them. Smh. Same goes for when I was following up to track my order for why it was a taking a little long.To give them another chance, I just called today for a delivery and they told me they aren't doing deliveries due to the construction which is understandable. Sounded like the same guy and he was very short and annoyed with my call. I was trying to confirm what he said and he just hung up. Gave me no options for when to call again or for anything else. I really don't like the service and I really don't want to call back. I'm throwing away their menu.",,1,
7,Celeste T.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,6,5,3.0,5/17/2017,"Really good food! Breakfast there is great. I always get home fries and sausage or pancakes. Sadly, there delivery sucks. They are rude through phone. Ordered and when they delivered our food we called back because we were missing an orange juice and sausages, payed for. The man persisted that he put it in the bag and we are wrong but my husband kept on back and forth with him saying but it's not here until finally they said they would bring it. What happened after? They never did bring it. Smh. We are like down the block so I don't see what the trouble was. Thank God the food is good.",1,,
8,Yaya H.,"Tremont, NY",1,13,0,3.0,2/29/2016,Every time I call they put me on a long hold which is annoying and you can hear them taken someone else's order. Sometimes they don't tell you how much it is they just hang up. Food is great just don't like to dine in with them it's always packed.,2,,
9,Bella L.,"Methuen, MA",73,182,183,4.0,4/5/2013,I have been a fan of Jimbo's since I discovered them in Fordham a while back. They offer many options and cook their foods just right. Of course they're known for their juicy burgers but I fell in love with them for their breakfast. One of the best French Toast breakfasts I've had and for a quick treat they have the best Cherry Danish. I agree you can not go wrong with this place. I have never had issues with Jimbo's and I hope they keep it up. Their soooooo good!!,1,,
10,Lupe C.,"East Tremont, Bronx, NY",4,1,4,5.0,10/1/2012,I totally love grilled chicken gyros with cheese fries is the best !!! And Caesar salad :) I would recommend this place xD especially good service .,1,,
11,Lisa S.,"Bronx, NY",0,107,0,2.0,12/31/2014,"The restaurant is very clean and updated, however the food is boring. The home fries are basically just white potatoes. They could easily throw in some onions and spices to give it some taste.",,,
12,Tiffany W.,"West Bronx, NY",0,1,0,4.0,3/14/2016,Their food is really good the only thing I can say that's a con is their customer service when ordering due to the high volume of customers but other than that they're great.,,,
13,Mike R.,"New York, NY",0,21,0,2.0,1/22/2014,"The food is good, pretty much what you would expect from a Jimbo's. The issue isn't the food it's the service. The guys that answer the phone are rude and can be down right nasty. And yes people can have an off day, but not 5 or 6 off days. The treat people as if they are doing the customer a favor, it's a shame.",1,,
14,The Adventures Of S.,"New Orleans, LA",119,12,10,3.0,7/1/2014,"Everything was bland. No disrespect intended, but the comparison we found most fitting was diabetic food. Shizz had two eggs over medium with bacon and home fries and Jig had an egg sandwich with hot sausage. Salt, pepper and hot sauce were our best friends. This wasn't the worst food, it was just plain and didn't give us a reason to ever go back. I gave an extra star because 3 of us ate for under $15 total (our friend just got scrambled eggs, home fries and toast and enjoyed it. To be fair she also doesn't use salt on her food. Ever). Cool little spot, but we won't be there again. I'm sure our buddy will though.",,,
15,Tony D.,"Yonkers, NY",47,2,0,2.0,8/11/2013,Meat was pink. Fries had no salt... We went at 7:30 and they said that we can't stay and eat because the place closes as 8... Fuck this place. Only saving grace is the food was fast and cheap.,,1,
16,Michael J.,"New York, NY",212,298,93,5.0,8/9/2012,"Love JImbo's. Food made to order so it's always fresh. Burgers, wings, bf, Gyros. They have a huge menu. I am never disappointed with Jimbo's. There is a location around my Mom's way which was just as good. This location delivers and they are fast. The only thing I don't like about Jimbo's is that the close pretty early, other than that you can't go wrong with this place.",4,,
17,Jasmine L.,"Hayward, CA",54,5,0,4.0,4/6/2013,"Burger was delicious, fries were great had to add salt because they came out with no salt. I had to walk a couple of blocks home and the container they put my food in kept it super warm the whole way.",,,
18,Levon S.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,14,4,4.0,2/1/2015,The breakfast is awesome and the customer service is good. I would recommend this place to others. The preparation of food is timely.,,,
19,Jorge O.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,1,1.0,4/12/2013,Messed up a breakfast item then had the nerve to charge me for the replacment. Was becoming a regular until today! Watery eggs over light then blamed me when i've been to several Jimbo's including this one with the same exact order and never had to complain. Great food overall terrible customer service decision don't you think? Why would they argue for 2 replacement eggs that cost them $0.10.,,,
20,Aniie-Jay H.,"West Bronx, NY",1,5,3,5.0,10/1/2012,"i love love their Chicken Gyros , Grilled chicken wraps , mozzarella sticks, buffalo wings ,french fries , pastrami sandwiches, Caesar salads , burgers with beacon ,  waffles & banana pancakes yumm yumm :) Dam lets just  say the whole menu ! & i like the atmosphere ; very clean place .Even though it gets packed they try their very best to get to everyone .",2,1,3
