0,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",321,658,142,4.0,6/28/2017,"This place is hidden away on a busy street. When my wife and I walked in around 8pm on a Friday night, it was completely empty.  We asked for two drinks that weren't on the menu and the mixologist had no idea what we were talking about. No big deal I guess.  The cocktail list was short but it went straight to the point. Overall it is a very good scene with great music and some small bites. Probably a spot that you can start and end your night if you don't feel like moving around much. Don't come here expecting master mixologists, but do come for a great cocktail.",,,2
1,Susan L.,"New York, NY",14,114,173,4.0,9/12/2017,"It was a nice romantic low-key place. Nice place to bring a date. We practically had the whole place to ourselves. It's a nice place to get drinks and chat. They do not serve any food at all, not even peanuts.",1,,
2,T C.,"San Francisco, CA",258,160,331,5.0,11/5/2017,Nice little joint. Cocktail selection is good and they make the best of this one drink called Last Word! It's a gin drink and I wish I took a pic of the menu! Will come back!,,,
3,Chey H.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,561,120,4.0,1/3/2017,"I read about Wise Men in some glossy magazine awhile ago and put it on my never ending ""To Visit"" list. Flash forward to a few Saturdays ago when I was finishing up dinner with a friend in the West Village and we decided to walk over and have a drink or two. Wise Men is very low-key but well decorated, almost a mix of a retro 80's lounge but modern updates/decor. There is plenty of seating in the front and in the back near the DJ booth. Drinks were $15 ($11-$12 for well) and were well made and strong. Seems like a hot spot for groups (a few birthday parties were gathered) and late night dancing--the DJ was playing a lot of great stuff, from 90's pop hits to current hip-hop. And the bartenders were friendly and fast, they made ordering a breeze. The one low point of the evening was the bathroom--it needed to be cleaned badly. But the fun music and atmosphere clearly over-shone that. Stop in if you're in the area and don't want to deal with more pretentious spots nearby.",3,,1

Ok that may be a tad dramatic....besides random make out sessions you can also expect cool cocktails and a nice DJ. This is a great place to come with your friends if you're not in the mood for dancing!",1,,1
5,Fernando B.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",7,18,0,4.0,7/23/2017,"I liked this low key spot, the music was good and they had decent drinks. If you go there early is a good chill spot to hang out and talk. After some point in the night the music becomes louder and it's more of a party scene. Overall good joint though",,,
6,David A R.,"San Francisco, CA",1157,559,104,5.0,9/26/2016,Fantastic small bar. Wonderful ambience. Romantic and dark without being pitch lack. Tables in back. Not too crowded on a Friday night.

7,Patrick F.,"New York, NY",83,47,46,3.0,3/5/2016,"Stopped in Friday 3/4/16 for cocktails.  First time. Influenced by their good yelp rating. Drinks were good.  Not on the level of spots like Pegu, Employees Only, Flatiron Lounge, etc...but good.  If there's a middle ground between mixology bar and dive bar,  Wise Men would exist there.  Cocktail concepts were well thought out but lacked the details that elevate from ""ok"" to "" memorable.""  By details I mean stuff like their use of standard restaurant ice (which waters down your cocktail too quickly), pre-cut garnishes (like peels and twists) sitting out and drying up, and generally dirty bottles of bitters and syrups inches away from the bar patrons.  It's all a little lazy, if you're looking to attract guests who want great cocktails. I'm being a picky because I'm measuring them up to the top craft bars.  Compared to dive bars, Wise Men is very good. One final note that I hope the bartenders and management read...While seated at the bar we spotted the barback/busser (tall Hispanic kid with neck tattoo(s)) scooping ice with a glass.  Looked like he was making himself a soda or glass of iced water.  Scooping ice with glass is a major no-no in the restaurant/bar biz.  He needs to be corrected asap.  The simple act of plunging a glass into a basin of ice could cause the glass to chip...and that tiny glass chip in the ice can easily find its way into a guest's drink.  Very dangerous.  Should always use a plastic or metal scoop to fill a glass with ice.  This is bartending 101 stuff.",8,1,
8,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",269,246,133,3.0,4/13/2017,"This place is prob a good place to get drinks before / after dinner, but def not like a party poppin spot. My friend had her birthday there and it's a very small lounge so we basically took over the whole back area. It took awhile for me to get the drink and the server was a bit snappy and said she was making her rounds as she go except I had been there for over 15+ min and still had not gotten my drink yet while others already did. The cocktails are typical price for what you get in the city. The gin drink that I got had a very interesting taste to it, but was not impressive enough for me to keep ordering from the cocktail menu. For that, 1 tanqueray, 2 bombays (because they somehow ran out of tanqueray), and 2 beers plus gratuity - total was $81. It's VERY sneaky, but remember that they factor in gratuity already so for the other tab that I closed, I was (obviously) drunk and didn't see it (because it's also very dark once you're inside) and tipped on TOP of the included gratuity amount so basically they got 36% in tips which is ridiculous. Not a bad spot and it's conveniently located next to Phebe's so if you have a dying urge to go there, you can knock out two birds with one stone.",,,
9,Steve C.,"New York, NY",6,25,1,2.0,1/12/2016,"The $$ in the description next to the bar should definitely be changed to $$$$.  $16 for a perfectly measured out Knob Creek on the rocks is NOT ok.  To go with that, the music sounded like a mix between Cruisin the USA and Vice City.  It was a Friday night and I can see why there wasn't much action going on inside.I used to like this place a bit more when they played 90's-early 2000s hip hop.  Oh well...",3,2,2
10,Kayla S.,"Nutley, NJ",135,1,0,3.0,10/3/2017,"The only reason this place is even getting three stars is simply because the music at this bar I have never been forced to write an actual review on yelp in my life up until yesterday. I went into this bar with a friend because they wanted to check it out and we had been in and out of bars that day just checking them out. So we walk in the music is good the bartender was friendly so it seemed so all seemed well I ordered me and my friends drink and paid for both.  *Note* I had been to several bars prior in which I had not tipped until after my second drink. I never tip til after my second drink because I tip based off of SERVICE. Needles to say at this bar I never stayed for that second drink because the bartender who had his nose pierced and birds tattooed on the side of his head I believe came up to me after bringing my drinks and said to me ""just so you know if you want your bartender to actually pay attention to you or to bring your drinks you tip. You didn't tip me"" again because I don't tip til my second drink. This was the worst kind of service I have EVER experienced. I was honestly so mortified I had to walk out after because I honestly thought about saying something. Awful. Never again will me or my friends go to this bar.",,,

It looked really cool, but I had no idea what it was, there were no windows to peek in, so curiosity got the best of me. After looking up the name on the sign, I found out it was a bar, Wise Men. Great! I had to check it out. I ordered a drink called The Last Word (Gin, Green Chartreuse, Maraschino, Lemon Juice). I really liked it. Potent, but has a nice sweetness and citrus taste that balances the drink out well.",2,,
15,Wahed K.,"Astoria, NY",669,759,1573,2.0,7/16/2013,"Over rated. I booked a table late Friday night for 6 thinking we would be spending a couple of hours here eating and drinking but were disappointed on all fronts.DRINKS:I got the New York Sour which is their take on a whiskey sour made with bourbon, lemon juice, syrup and malbec float. The sour taste was fine but other than that the drink was completely unbalanced. My friend complained about his Mezcal Smash and I tried it. Sure enough, it seemed off. For whatever reason, the balance wasn't right in this either. FOOD:With our initial round of drinks, we ordered crab toast and buttermilk fried chicken wings. The crab toast was as ordinary as they come. If this is people's idea of a good crab toast, I feel sorry for them. It didn't even taste fresh. The fried chicken ... umm.. how can I put this nicely? was a rip off. For $10, we got 3 doughy pieces of chicken wings. Let's put that into perspective shall we? That's a $3.33 per chicken wing! ATMOSPHERE:This has been incorrectly called a ""speakeasy"" by some reviewers. This is actually a straight up cocktail bar with LOUD music.  So loud in fact that we had to scream at each other to hear ourselves. Simply put, there was no speaking easily here. They were playing Indie rock while we were there. I don't mind the music but for the love of God, turn that sh8 down.  I couldn't hear myself think. After a round of drinks, we quickly settled up and bounced as fast as we could.  Wise men left us feeling pretty stupid.",7,7,6

18,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,4.0,3/4/2013,"My friends and I stumbled in well after midnight on Friday night. We've been on a speakeasy kick of late and wanted to ""get it in"" with one since we'd spent the earlier part of our evening at the more familiar (but always great) Swift, so I clicked my ""Hot & New"" Yelp button and got this.Pardon any errors in my description (sobriety is required for full justice to be done). The location is both visible enough to avoid well-worn speakeasy cliches that places like PDT dabble in, and subtle enough to escape the average eye scanning the street. There was a mural on the front that gave it that handball court graffiti flavor. The front door, once found, can be easily accessed by pulling on the fake submarine hatch-like wheel. Inside was chic and moderately sexy, as you might expect.Wise Men generally struck a note of unusually high feeling of welcome for an upmarket cocktail lounge that I hope will outlast its ""honeymoon phase."" We were ushered in by the well-dressed staff and offered a nice table (the perk of going to a hot place pre- or past peak). There's a short list of cocktails, which made selections pretty easy. My Sazerac (rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud's bitters) was very good. I also had some greasy late night food: their short menu features a patty melt that is both delicious and egregiously overpriced at $14 (for such a small sandwich with no sides). But flappers can't be misers, I suppose.Go, soon, before it's mobbed! It might be, already.",1,1,2

Luckily, one night this place came up during my search for a cocktail bar. Chic and low-key, this place has the right environment for conversation. The music oozed chill vibes and wasn't too loud. The decoration was a bit whimsical in its Bowery flair. There are booths and tables everywhere, great for bigger groups or two people. I was lucky enough to have 3 more drinking companions, so I was able to try most of the menu. Please note that I don't really know how to describe cocktails professionally. P3x: This one was my favorite. Fizzy, juicy, light. With vodka, prosecco, and pear. Just one is good for a lightweight like me. 2? Oh boy, I started talking in cursive. Sticks and Stones: Your average masculine drink. Think Don Draper and his Old Fashioneds. This is one you sip a bit at a time. I was amused by the licorice root that looked like a twig in the drink. Sidecar: I also liked this one since the citrus flavors really stand out. The cognac served as a bass to each melodious gulp. I couldn't taste the vanilla bean at all. Was I supposed to? Glasglow Kiss: Be careful, this one has an interesting aftertaste due to the beet reduction. Just One More Thing: I love ginger, I love pineapple, but this one was a bit too strong for me. I guess I'm not a big fan of bitters. Hope that helps, if at all.",3,3,2

The atmosphere was lively and fun, people regularly get out of their seats, I got to buff the hardwood with some strangers. All and all I had a great experience I'm just partial to so many other cocktail bars in the region. I understand the desire to combine mixology with a party but for me they are two different moods. I prefer to drink a few stiff cocktails, get my groove on in a dark relaxed spot, then when the liquor is in control I choose jump up and get crazy. That's just me.  If you seek a hybrid experience I would reccomend you stop in for a visit.",,,

We definitely needed a reservation for a party of 6, so plan ahead if you want to do dinner, as they aren't too attentive to the phones. I split the Bavette Steak and Patty melt with a friend and was so glad I did--both are divine and the perfect portion size. The Wise Men steak sauce is sweet and tangy, and the signature patty melt certainly lived up to the hype. Decided to be adventurous and try the Vesper (Wise Men's version of a vodka/gin martini) but I'll be sticking with my dark-liquored cocktails in the future...I think I've found my spirit soulmates.Fun fact: the waitress told me the art on the back wall is actually a repeatedly mirrored picture of Kobe beef. Don't get what I mean? Go see for yourself!",1,,
45,Joanie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,823,27,3.0,7/29/2013,"Came here on a date on Thurs at 930p. There wasn't a wait for a table and the place was moderately crowded. It was slightly louder, than say, a wine bar.. but did not make for unintelligible conversation noise. i ordered the patty, which was delicious. Perfectly greasy and a small enough portion that it wouldn't make me sick. the drinks were pretty good as well and moderately priced.",,,
46,David W.,"New York, NY",167,834,0,3.0,6/9/2013,"Another cocktail bar in the EV so I figured I'd check it out.  It's a nice space, dimly lit and it seemed like everyone inside was on a date.  the mixed drink menu is relatively small, so if you're looking for a long list of interesting cocktails, this probably isn't your spot.  If you're looking for a spot that's not loud where you can easily grab some seats and has a fancier feel, this should definitely be on your list.There is a food menu with a few interesting items, but didn't have the chance to try anything on it.",,,
47,Townes A.,"Manhattan, NY",11,31,1,1.0,6/8/2015,"Too dark, too cramped, and the bartender, Patrick, was a rude and overcharged me for a soda. Then he demanded for my ID but never asked anyone else for ID when they were ordering ALCOHOL. If you do decide to come here make sure to order something you can see on the menu, that way you know EXACTLY the amount it should cost. Waiters/bartenders tend to overcharge in order to get a tip. When you do tip, you are tipping double. I personally don't like when someone gets one over on me",,,
48,Vinod S.,"Manhattan, NY",189,58,3,4.0,7/17/2013,"Great speakeasy.The old photograph of middle-aged Asian women as a mural out front is oddly inviting. Inside, it's dark, and great cocktails are being served up. I particularly liked the one with prosecco (French 99 or something) for a refreshing choice, but the harder cocktails are nice as well. Always key for me is good music and there was a great selection which I realized was actually being played by a DJ in the back. He went through some good new wave/80s synth on the darker side. It's a good date spot or with a few good friends. The crowd was eclectic, from preppies in suits, to musicians with strange hair. And not once, not twice, but thrice I witnessed men unabashedly dancing like they were alone in their apartment - very entertaining. I guess the only thing is if you're a single man or group of men, it might be difficult to get in on a busy night.",,,
49,Cece Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2,728,711,3.0,3/10/2015,"Tiny bar - a little divey - that actually looked cooler from the street when it was under construction.  It's definitely not a speakeasy, as the sign and entrance are now plainly visible.  On a weekend evening though, it was pleasantly uncrowded but also not empty.",,,
50,J J.,"New York, NY",2,22,0,1.0,1/17/2014,"The venue is not bad and the cocktails are good, but staff service/ethics is questionable.  I had a tab running, but  additional drinks were charged onto my card without my acknowledgement.  Just because I'm talking to someone does not mean I'm buying that person drinks as well.  At the end of the night, I was charged for a large sum (probably equaling 15 cocktails), which I know I did not personally order.  The bill came in a lump sum, without a breakdown of what I was charged for.  Great way to take advantage of your tipsy customers.  Also, because we were there for a birthday and we brought cupcakes, the bar wanted to charge a $3 ""plate fee"" per cupcake.  This is pretty absurd since the whole point of buying cupcakes was to avoid using plates and utensils and at a $3 plate fee per cupcake, that adds up to quite a lot.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back again and wouldn't recommend it to friends.  There are other better/trustworthy cocktail bars out there.",3,,
51,Amy G.,"New York, NY",0,24,0,4.0,2/21/2015,"I really like this place. Very old school nyc feel. Great for a group to have some drinks before heading out somewhere on the Bowery. It's not a big place and fills up quickly but always filled with very diverse and cool crowd. Waitstaff is a little flaky, inattentive but they eventually figure out who ordered what after a few tries. Still, good for a few drinks any night of week but wknd tends to get PACKED so head there early for a pre-sinner drink or two!",,,
52,Shannon S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,5.0,2/7/2013,"Run don't walk!!! This restaurant-bar has a super cool vibe from the decor to the music to the creative energy of the crowd. Most importantly, the food was perfect. The cuisine was inspired by a western steakhouse from Chinatown in the 70's. It is a nice mix of meat to fish and several amazing vegetarian options. It is very accommodating to mindful women respecting their disciplined diets, but  also offering incredibly delicious indulgent dishes... a great balanced menu with brilliant execution. The bar offers both artisanal crafted cocktails and the classics. This is the type of place that you want to bring friends from out of town, so they feel like they are New Yorkers for the night.",3,1,3
53,Sarah V.,"Newark, NJ",378,115,222,3.0,2/5/2014,"I love to frequent cool bars such as this. This time I came because there is a rental space right next to this bar where the Jose Duran presentation took place. Of course this bar is right next to the rental space and all the NYFW attendees came here for a drink. Its a chill spot with great music. On this particular night, only the ""fashion"" crowd was out which meant a lot of ""you can't sit with us"" looks. (I give those looks too) The drinks are reasonable (which is great in this part of town) It never got to crowded but it was dead either. I happened to have a dry martini and yes, the bartender delivered. Next time I come here, Ill be sure to be around a more down to earth crowd. It is a cool little gem in the dingy bowery section of the city. (which I'm glad the bowery is still a little dingy)",,,
54,Zack C.,"Manhattan, NY",124,33,1,5.0,8/6/2014,I loved this place!!! The staff were friendly and looked like they would rather be drinking than actually working there. It made me think of a place I would enjoy working at because of the laid back vibe and the chill out scene that I felt while there. The drinks were good but if I had a complaint there were no light beers and come on man!! I am watching my carbs. Otherwise it was good even though a little pricey but pretty much standard for this part of town. I definitely recommend this place and could definitely see my self going back again.,,,
55,Tim C.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,24,0,4.0,12/2/2013,"Had a great time with a large group, 10 people, at Wise Men. The ambiance is excellent, food was delicious, nice wine and beer menu, and conscientious service. Love the fact that the door is very deceiving. When we first saw it we thought for sure we wouldn't want to stay. Make sure you ring the doorbell. You won't be dissapointed.",,1,
56,Ash C.,"New York, NY",73,301,6,2.0,1/12/2014,"Small unpretentious cocktail bar - long bar in the front and lounge seating in the back.  Drinks were great but in a land of speakeasy style cocktail bars this one falls a bit below the standard.  It felt a little dingy - still too much like a standard bar and not quite special enough feeling to compare with the big boys - even the liquor choices weren't quite as premium.  Great drinks though, and not at the same outrageous prices as some of the other cocktail haunts.  Good enough for what it was.",,,
57,Paul C.,"New York, NY",77,441,352,4.0,5/29/2013,"The drinks are great, the staff very friendly and the place is cool, a hidden gem. The weak point is the food which is for the most part average.",1,,
58,Caz K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,5.0,2/18/2013,"Get there before it becomes way too busy (which will certainly happen). The interior is quirky but very thoughtful, with one wall meant to resemble the marbling in meat. Cocktails were smart and well prepared. They have a small menu but what they make they make well. The ""Peas & Carrots"" had a nice acidity from a vinegar dressing, the clam strips were perfectly fried and not oily, but the crab toast was the standout among the starters. Bavette steak was cooked perfectly and had a tenderness that I didn't think was possible with such a lean cut of beef.",1,1,1
59,Bryan S.,"Atlanta, GA",29,87,0,4.0,11/17/2013,"This place was really nice.  Somewhat ""loungy"", nice space and cute people.  While it was nice, I also can't call out anything specific to say why you should definitely go here vs. somewhere else, but it's a good option.",,,
60,Cd S.,"New York, NY",15,133,3,4.0,12/1/2013,"The vibe, with the music and bartenders styling, was something like ""seedy cocktail lounge on the Love Boat"" but that made it kinda perfect for late Saturday night.  Good drinks and a good crowd.",,,
61,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0,3.0,11/10/2013,"Pretty good cocktail bar on Bowery, the bartenders are affable and friendly and definitely fast to serve patrons. The music is eclectic, from Nelly to Girl Talk to Icona Pop. Boisterous scene at night, however a bit small. Avoid late at night or during prime time weekends. But to be honest, nothing ...special. Lacks the ""it"" factor or ambience which will draw me back. Food portions were on the small side which I wasn't sure why. Again, this bar specializes in cocktails in a neighborhood where the cocktail revolution is brewing. Doesn't break my top 5 cocktail bars below 14th street list AT ALL. Fun place, but probably won't be making this a destination in the future unless a friend has a birthday/event here.",,,
62,Mark D.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,71,0,4.0,8/13/2013,"Good drinks, good music and overall awesome vibe. The cocktails are really good and the bartenders are really cool. Take a date or some friends but just keep in mind that this place can get a little pricey",,,
63,Jessica L.,"New York, NY",4,54,0,4.0,5/1/2013,"I'm usually not a big fan of speakeasys.  Fighting a line to get in, sitting in cramped settings, dealing with pretentious bartenders..  blah blah blah.  None of that here!Dropped in on a Tuesday night and the crowd was pretty scattered.  Didn't get to try the food so no comments on that front.  And while the drink menu was fairly short, like any other speakeasy, you can always request something custom.We were in the mood for some spicy mezcal, and boy did they deliver!  Things got kind of blurry after that; a sign of a good night, I guess. :)  The only thing I know is I ended up a $100+ bill after 6 drinks..  You can take that for what it is.",,,
64,Katie W.,"Manhattan, NY",200,526,342,3.0,3/8/2013,"I don't throw this word around a lot but Wise Men is definitely a ""sexy"" bar.  Limited cocktail menu (5-6 options at $12/each) and a lot of beer and wine choices.  I had the ""355"" drink with tequila and bitters and Mike B. had the ""The Perfect Rob Roy"".  There is lounge seating in the front and lots of tables in the back.  The food smelled really good and the bartender explained the menu is based on the original ""Wise Men"" which was the first steakhouse in Chinatown.  Overall it's dark and swanky and good for a date but wasn't wowed by the cocktails.",,,
65,Isabel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,94,6,4.0,5/21/2013,"celebrated my bfs birthday last week. We had a mix of friends there but the vibe was so awesome that it worked! Drinks are great. Everyone is super friendly. Despite being in a location known for being a little ""extra"" this is a great spot to kick it and enjoy the ambiance of good people. Do it!",,,
66,Heather D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,0,5.0,9/25/2013,"The front door alone tells you this place is special. Walk inside and you're greeted by a bar tender who is ready to serve up something strong. I've only been here once, but I will be back. The drinks were delcious, the patty melt was the perfect medium rare, and the chocolate pudding----absolutely rich.  Include a good DJ and warm ambience, just the perfect little spot.",,,
67,R P.,"New York, NY",3,62,5,3.0,3/28/2013,"Their signature drinks are great, the service is also very good, the ambiance is sexy but the food is mediocre",,,
68,Darryl J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,0,5.0,4/11/2013,Great vibe. Great food. Great service. Good place to go if you wanna party but also a great spot to go if you like a good meal. Great location as well. I'd recommend this new spot to anyone in the city looking to get loose.,,,
69,Jon R.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,5.0,2/14/2013,"This place is awesome, my new favorite bar! Its cozy when you walk in and almost an oasis from the other nearby bars on the bowery, the music is great and at the perfect level so that you can still have a conversation. Their special drinks are nice and strong and reasonably priced, another hidden gem is the food which is delicious and also super cheap for how good it was. The portions aren't huge so you can mix and match plates with a group - everything that my table ordered was great but my favorites were the fried clam strips, crab toast, salad, the steak bites, patty melt, and the delicious oversized chocolate mousse dessert! The vegetarians were happy with a lot of options for them too. The decor is sleek and hip and will definitely be back.",,,
70,Jack L.,"Manhattan, NY",341,123,32,3.0,7/28/2013,"i've been here twice, both times mostly blacked out, and i had no idea what this place was called or where it was. after matching drunk pictures on my phone to those on yelp, i've finally tracked this location. from small snippets of my lost memory, it's a fun space - not the nicest space - and you can either sit around and drink or dance in the back. pictures also suggested i had a lot of fun, so i probably come back if i was in the area.",1,3,
71,Ja H.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",0,3,0,3.0,3/3/2013,"Wise Men is a very cute spot...sexy, as one blog described.  Food was hit and miss the night we went in, which was the first Friday it was open.  My date and I started with drinks (his all alcoholic, mine a ""make-me-anything-not alcoholic"").  They were all exactly what we asked for and enjoyed.  We went for appetizers on our way to a dinner, so we had the Fried Clams, Crab Toast and split a patty melt.  The Fried Clams were yummy...breading was crunchy and had flavor with a kick at the end of the crunch that would be perfect on fried chicken.  The crab toast was also a winner.  The patty melt was a miss.  Burger itself was good, but I wish more people knew what a patty melt is.  It's not a cheeseburger between two slices of toast.  It's a grilled cheese sandwich with a burger.  It should be a marriage.  After reading the opening reviews, I expected a much better sandwich, but I will try it again to see if it wasn't just opening week jitters.One other thing, and this is what brought the review to a three instead of a four.  The music in that place was distinctly horrible.  They were playing music that sounded like someone's poorly mixed demo tape.  Even the waitress wanted to change it, but said she had no power to.  We left much quicker than we would have.  It is such a sexy place, the music should not be such a distraction.",1,1,1
72,J W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/19/2013,"Wise Men is my new favorite place.  The cocktails and food are fantastic!  The decor makes the environment lively, fun and cool without being too much!  Great music and friendly people! Tres cool!",1,1,1
73,Betty W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,1,0,5.0,9/11/2013,This was one of the most fun nights I've had with friends in NY!  The drinks were delicious and the food was great. I've been missing the old ny and this place reminds me of why I love NY so much.,,,
74,Amy S.,"New York, NY",25,23,0,2.0,2/18/2013,"Disappointing!  I was so excited to go, but was not impressed.  The drink was too strong.  The food was ok, but nothing noteworthy.  The crab toast tasted like tuna fish from a can.  The fries tasted like they were from McDonalds and the sauce was just ok. The steak sauce tasted like A1 sauce.  Not bad, but would have done better just staying home and cooking for myself.  The menu was confusing and wasn't sure what was to share and what was a full entree.  Nothing on the menu really jumped out at me as something that I had to try. Maybe they need more time to get their groove, or maybe I just don't get it.",,,
75,Glamma C.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/27/2013,"This is a true nod to old school New York run by REAL New Yorkers who are as cool as it gets.  They have managed to do the impossible by creating a modern yet laid back sexy a$$ venue on the Bowery of 2013.  Great vibes and good times.  I know it is a meat heavy menu but don't miss the crab toast and the cabbage salad!  Great wines/beers/drinks.  Try an Americano or a Rob Roy, live a little.  It's clear this place is gonna pop off but I can tell they are gonna keep it real, it's a hip place but friendly and the marble bar is pure 70's fun.  Why is no one else opening places like this?  These ladies are stealing the show.  GOOD. JOB.   As someone who misses the old Bowery but still lives in the hood, thank god i finally have somewhere to go on the new Bowery!",,,
76,David C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,26,0,5.0,3/1/2013,"Went with a friend on Wed night looking for a place with a cool NY vibe and decided on the Bowery.  Saw some cool people going into this place and we decided to check it out.   Great easy location between the Standard and the Bowery Hotel but there is no signage, just a big vintage photo mural.  If you dont look for the door with a water valve handle,  you'll pass it by.   The place is dark and sexy with a crowd to match.  must be a fashion hangout because the men and women were hot.   The menu is small, simple and reasonably priced.  We had the steak which is amazing and the sweet salty apple maki were terrific.  Not a dessert person, but the chocolate thing was out of this world.   The drink menu (classics with a twist) was the highlight for me.  Had the Vesper and Rob Roy both done expertly to perfection, telling us the bartenders are not just out of work actors.   i felt like James Bond sipping my drinks.  My friend who is a light weight decided on wine which were well selected for price and quality.  We were there early-ish but heard the late crowd is even better. All in all had a great time.  Have some friends from Paris next week, cant wait to bring them to get a feel of NYC.  Definitely a great place to bring upper eastsiders or out of town guests.",,,
77,Sara C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,2/11/2013,"The best little cantina in the area. Feels like a genuine NY throwback, a place with a sexy, permissive energy of a bygone era. Good cocktails. The pork chop and the fries are incredible.",,,
