Updated review","They are So friendly and the food is so tasty!!! I came here when they opened and had 1 bad experience but since then it has been nothing but lovely.Their coffee is fantastic, freshly brewed! Also their coconut protein pods are to die for and great on the go.  However their bowls are excellent- Burr is my personal favorite. The avocado toast is fantastic, I always get the one with the corn and beans and it's a great source of natural fats, protein and veggies. I am so happy to call this lovely eatery a neighborhood haunt. Oh and before i forget their happy hour has great options and at a fantastic price that you can't beat.",,,

Updated review","So there have been a number of marked improvements since my last negative review which stemmed from a negative experience with the owner in the first month or two of opening. All that is in the past, however and it seems that whatever kinks they have had have been worked out. They now have several vegan options from muffins, soups, avocado toasts, and usually sandwiches as well. The muffins are always the bombdotcom but where it's really at is the homemade vegan fudge hot chocolate. I'll let that seep in for a minute while I discuss their other offerings.Although I have not been here for dinner, they have a bottomless brunch option on weekends where they close off half the cafe for entree customers and keep the other half (the ""uptown"" side I believe they call it) as the standard cafe with exposed brick walls, atmospheric music and the sweet background noise of steamed coffee and barista chatter. They also seem to have beer and wine, with a sweet deal I saw today advertised as beers for around 3$/can or bottle -- with a nice selection of quality beer *adds to list of must-try soon*.The coffee is still expensive, as is the fare but they do offer a no-rush environment which many people here take full advantage of (including yours truly) with all the local med students and other healthcare field students studying from the break of dawn until the break of nerves perpetuated by their double-caff cold brew coffee and coconut flat whites. Now that you've had a little bit of time let me revisit the vegan fudge hot chocolate......... *Looks fondly into the distance*:: Fade to black ::",4,2,4

4,Beril E.,"New York, NY",155,99,458,3.0,4/29/2018,"Bottomless brunch restaurant that also has a cafe section on the other side. Place is spacious so finding a seat won't be a problem. Service was impeccable, so much so that I was confused as to what sort of a place I've come to. Our server practically serenaded us as she was handing us our check.Many healthy food options are available. I got the Hamilton bowl with quinoa, chicken, bacon, cheese, and corn relish served with roasted potatoes. The dish was so large that I didn't even attempt to finish it. Quinoa was everywhere, but didn't have too much of a flavor, similar to the chicken, which lacked seasoning. The roasted potatoes, though, were delicious. We also got the avocado smash toast with cherry tomatoes on top and roasted potatoes on the side. The avocado toast tasted plain; it would have been better if they had toasted their bread more before spreading the avocado to give the toast some crunchiness and spices and olive oil to drizzle on top of the smash. The general custard tart with blueberries and strawberries was okay, albeit a bit dry. The number of milk and cream options available for the coffee drinks are great, but I would have appreciated a heads up that a latte with soy milk would be 50 cents extra. When I ordered my latte I was expecting to get it with whole milk but when the server raised my expectations by asking for my milk preference and starting to count 10 choices including rice milk. I was all too naive to think soy milk would be included in the price.",,,
5,Jung Joo K.,"Great Neck, NY",492,104,263,4.0,10/31/2017,"Hamilton's Bakery has unique dishes. They're good, but can be heavy. I had the breakfast pizza, and it's definitely to share. However, it tastes more so like scrambled eggs with chipotle sauce on top of pizza crust. Good but not entirely exciting. The tiramisu French Toast is good as well but very sweet and heavy. It's great to have a few bites but you may get sick of it after a while. I realize that maybe their dishes are better shared than eaten solo. I do need to emphasize that their coffee is amazing. Had an americano--it wasn't too watered down or bitter dark. Just perfect.The service was super friendly and considerate. There must have been a delay in the kitchen (we didn't notice) but the waitress continuously came to check on us to apologize and give complimentary food. Not my favorite brunch place, but with the price and service, it's up there. It's definitely way up there if I'm comparing it to any of the other brunch places I know in the area.",2,,2
6,Chelsea A.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,71,37,3.0,11/4/2017,"I came to Harlem to visit dome friends and this place caught my eyes due to their extreme selection of avocado toast- a favorite of mine! I walked in and was seated quickly. After over ten minutes of not being attended to at all I stopped one of the servers and asked could I be helped. She told me that she would go get my server. She returned saying my server was in the bathroom and would be with me shortly. About 5-7 minute wait the same server I stopped perviously said she could take my order.I waited about 15 mins for my food, not too bad.I got the avocado toast with just tomatoes. I did not enjoy it. It seemed like the avocado was mixed with something or maybe it was the tomatoes but either way it was appealing to me.The next day I came back again with two friends, Again we waited over 15 minutes before I stopped someone and asked where was our sever. Food took another 20-25 mins (had to stop the sever and ask for updates). I got the cheese pizza this time and I loved it. My friends got chicken and waffles and loved the chicken but said the waffle was hard.There was one person who delivered our food, an older gentleman, who was nice to us which we appreciated and they did have a nice host.",2,,
7,Ruthanne R.,"New York, NY",25,92,336,2.0,10/28/2017,"All I can do is hope we came in on an off-day.One: everything was burnt, from biscuits to coffee. I can understand if they were having trouble with the ovens that day, leading to rock-hard biscuits and dried-out cinnamon bun French toast, but the coffee was so bitter it tasted like someone had left it hanging over a roaring fire all night long.Also, they didn't bring me what I actually ordered. More on that in a moment.Two: the service was EXTREMELY weird. My guess is they were training new staff; I hope this staff doesn't stick around. Here's why: Staff: *brings blackened biscuits* *no plates* *walks away before we can ask*Us, two minutes later: Hey, could we have a couple of small plates?Staff: *EYEROLL* Fine. *marches off*Yes, that really happened. It was like that the whole time; we asked for sugar for the burnt coffee, and she brought five tiny packets of non-sugar sweeteners. When we asked again, we got the eye-roll.Any simple question was met with weird attitude. My husband - who has an onion allergy - asked if the potatoes were cooked with anything, or if they were plain. The waitstaff sighed and muttered, ""No, no, they're just... "" She MADE A FACE. ""Just plain.""We WANTED them plain, so that was an odd turn-off.Oh, yes: and I asked for butter and maple syrup with my French toast; that is on the menu as an option. Instead, they brought some kind of pink stuff with strawberries stuck in it. It tasted like cream cheese; definitely not butter. Then again, the French toast was so dried out that I'm not sure butter could have saved it.I wanted to love this place, but between everything being burnt and dried out and the waitstaff acting like we were REALLY harshing her vibe, I just don't think we'll be going back.",2,,

9,Christina T.,"Norrmalm, Stockholm, Sweden",177,4,1,1.0,10/16/2017,"***For some reason my original review was removed from yelp because ""your review of Hamilton's Bakery as it looks like it was meant for another business."" I want to make it clear that I am reviewing Hamilton's Bakery on 3570 Broadway, NY, NY 10031.*** Here is what I originally posted:  This used to be my go to study spot for my friends and me as city college students. We all live in the area, and we were so excited when the place opened. We would have study groups/ meetings in there with great coffee. The food was overpriced, but the convenience and hours of this place were unmatched.Now none of us go here anymore (sadly) because it's not worth it. Today was actually the last straw for me. Yes, the coffee is still good and I have encountered some lovely baristas. However, the recent bad quality of the food and this weird dinner service set up has ruined this place for now.Their food was always overpriced, but overall used to be ok (though there were times I have gotten stale pastries or sandwiches). I am not sure if they have a new chef, or if this is an issue with management, but their hot food is completely different now. One of the hot food items I would get was the classic flat, which was a personal pizza with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, and pesto. At $13 it was expensive, but it was good study food and I would split it with a friend. I ordered this same flat today and was so disappointed. The pizza dough itself was the same, but instead on top was weak unseasoned tomato sauce, cheap mozzarella, and 5 unspreadable clumps of this horrible new pesto. Even though the quality has gone down, the price of this flat is still a crazy $13. I realize this place preaches organic, non-GMO ingredients, but that is no excuse for overpriced bad food.Also this new thing where the entire place turns into a restaurant at 630pm is ridiculous. I feel like this place is in an identity crisis between cafe and restaurant, and it's not working. If I'm going to pay ~$15 for coffee and food in a cafe to work, I don't want to be kicked out after a certain time just for higher paying customers to come (which I barely see because the place is empty for dinner service). I think people are confused to what this place is, and if you guys were to stick to one concept you would get more customers.Overall I'm disappointed that this is no longer my go to spot, and I hope you guys fix some of these issues. I think it's important to know that this is the very first yelp review I have ever written because of how upset I am with how this place has been lately. I would love to come back to the old Hamilton's sometime soon.",8,,

But horrendous, spotty WiFi. It's free so I guess I can't complain? But come on it was just bad. I tried changing where I sat to see if I could find a better signal.

12,Chad P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",445,27,1,5.0,10/22/2017,"This cozy coffee shop / restaurant in Upper Manhattan had one of the best cinnamon rolls I've had in the city thus far. The texture of the roll was a nice flaky crisp that caught me off guard. It was like a crescent and I wanted to keep eating. The closer you got to the middle, the warmer and softer it became. Such a perfectly baked masterpiece.The staff was also extremely polite. The man working the desk saw the roll I was looking at in particular and went out of his way to pick it for me, without needing me to ask. They even warm it for you, whether you're staying or taking to go.I wish I lived closer to this bakery because I would probably have one of those rolls on a weekly (daily) basis. Treat yourself to this roll - you won't regret it!!",2,,
13,Jade H.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",2,9,0,2.0,3/9/2018,"Disclaimer: I've only ever been here in the afternoon maybe mornings are different. The only thing I like about this place is the decor and the space. I've come here more than once trying to like the place but anyone who walks in here can tell the vibe is just off. The staff is less than welcoming they make it very clear this is a job and anything extra is tedious.I ordered a hot chocolate and a grilled cheese I thought I'd start simple. He told me he would bring the grilled cheese when it was ready. So I waited for the hot chocolate. My hot chocolate was cold and when I asked if they could make it again or heat it up because it wasn't luke warm it was cold and they had just given it to me I was told ""we don't serve it that hot we don't want customers to burn themselves"" it's HOT chocolate. If I wanted chocolate milk I would have asked for it. After waiting for my grilled cheese I went to check on it only to find out it had been sitting there. Needless to say it wasn't warm either. I came back here with a friend on another occasion because I really wanted to like this place. I asked about their coffee choices but they looked at me as if I had three heads because I was unfamiliar with something so I resorted to trying the hot chocolate again. (yes, it was still cold). My friend just ordered a brownie. They asked her if she wanted a fresh one or the one from the case. (who wouldn't want the fresh one?) however the brownie did taste good! In the end we both decided that would be our last trip there.",3,1,
14,Caroline B.,"Manhattan, NY",167,30,51,5.0,6/3/2018,I love their warm bowls! The strawberry avocado greens with quinoa was delicious. Two sauces make it so flavorful.

Updated review","Their food is so subpar is not even funny, yesterday I got a croissant there and it was a flakeless confused fat chunk of white bread. The same with their Matcha, is the worse powder Amazon can sell. But who cares if you just want to isolate with your laptop in public? You can stick to tea. But watch out for their upstairs area. It is right on top of the kitchen so if you sit there, you will smell like fried eggs by the time you leave. Their only pluses are the front couches and the location. Is easy to meet people there",3,,

But about the food, was like the chef didn't come to work..Dry bread, the potatoes wasn't cook enough, one egg was soft one was hard.

Is it a bakery? Can I eat there? WTF is going on? One time I actually went inside and somehow became more confused and walked back out. I know, I'm a huge sissy.Fast forward to last week and I finally gained the courage to eat at Hamilton's and guess what? They do have seating!

Really great study space in Harlem! Plenty of room inside. Great music. Came in on a Friday afternoon and was able to grab a seat at one of their larger tables. The decor in this place is also really cute! This cafe is along the busy street of Broadway. A lot of small bodegas and some fancier restaurants around. I guess you can say this area is getting gentrified?Wide selection of baked goods and food, too, if you're planning on getting work done here for a while.

23,Abigail M.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,2.0,11/3/2017,"I'm so disappointed in Hamilton's. As a local student, I used to be a regular here. There are great tea selections and a *very select* few decent (albeit overpriced) bakery options. I loved Hamilton's because of the atmosphere - the decor is lovely and there is a nice, peaceful ambient light. The scenery, however, does not make up for these fallacies: 1. The food and their prices: A lot of the bakery items are very, very dry. The few bakery items I used to enjoy were very overpriced. A pretty good, very small lemon chocolate chip muffin would set me back $3.50, which is utter madness. TL;DR: The quality of the food definitely does not match the pricing. 2. The fact that customers can no longer work in the establishment after 6:30 pm: a big draw of Hamilton's was that I could camp out at a table until closing time and get all of my studying done for the day. This is no longer an option, and thus Hamilton's is no longer an option for me.3. (Some) of the baristas: While some baristas were great, a number of them are very cold and aloof. Listen, I get it - baristas are on their feet all day and have to deal with more than a handful of rude customers during their shifts. I wouldn't be the happiest camper myself, but that doesn't mean giving customers the cold shoulder is OK. I'd be willing to go back and give Hamilton's another shot if I could go there after class and work until 10 pm again. If not, I have no reason to return.",4,,

Bakery is a bad word to describe this place, it's more of a cafe. It's a bakery in the same way Starbucks is a bakery - yeah they have some croissants and muffins, but its a coffee place.

29,Vicky P.,"Los Angeles, CA",481,568,627,4.0,5/27/2016,"My not-so-little-anymore cousin got herself an internship in NY for the summer. Now, I've had a heavy hand in raising this one, so I made sure she was just as big a foodie as me. Hey, I have to have someone other than the hubs to brunch with me well after I'm old and gray.So of course as soon as she arrives, she goes wandering about her new neighborhood looking for a place to make me jealous with.She sent me a care package with some baked goodies from a ""gem"" she found:- Pretzel Breads- Raison Crackle Bread- Chocolate Espresso Cookies- Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip CookiesI done raised her right.Each kind was wrapped tightly together with parchment paper and layer after layer of plastic wrap. I knew that it was the bakery that did it for her because they put their cute little sticker on it, labeled each pack, then put clear instructions on how to reheat the heavenly offerings for the best taste. I'll update my reviews as I start tasting the different treats (hopefully I can exercise some self-restraint and not finish everything this weekend). This morning, I tried a pretzel bread with my breakfast. I liked that the bread didn't get tough and chewy while sitting in my fridge for a few days. I think it's because the bread wasn't as dense as pretzel breads tend to be. The outside was crisp while the inside was still soft. The dough had a bit of sweetness to it that was a welcome contrast to the slight saltiness of the exterior. I didn't see any salt on the exterior of the bread (checked the package to make sure they didn't just fall off). I think I've come to expect and look forward to the large, rough salt crystals - it's a visual come-take-a-bite-out-of-me of any pretzel treat.I'm reading all the reviews, and maybe it's because I'm from LA where I'm used to vendors using high quality ingredients and charging more than the local diner, but I see nothing wrong with someone pricing their products based on their judgement of the products and work that went into it. Based on just my first tasting of what should have been stale pretzel bread, I can say that I'd be happy to visit Hamilton's for the fresh, real deal in person!I'm looking forward to reheating my next treat!",4,3,2
30,Laura D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",103,2,0,1.0,8/5/2017,"I grew up in the neighborhood and it's clear that the baristas do not care about the customers and the community here. I don't know if I can ever recommend this place to anyone or ever go back. The owner needs to hire baristas who care about their customers (esp the nice ones who chat w/ you and tip!) I visited Hamilton's Bakery on 8/5/17. I was at a cafe nearby that was closing and I needed to find a quiet place to work. I saw that Hamilton's Bakery was open til 10pm (every night, actually). I arrived shortly after 8pm. As I placed my order, I joked with the barista about how cold it was at the other cafe and how I wondered if it was to try to get people to leave early. I explained that I used to be a barista and that's what I'd seen done before. ""How awful"" I said. The barista and I laughed. I left a tip, unfortunately. (This is all relevant.) A few mins after 9pm, a barista came up to me and said ""I just wanted to let you know we are closing early tonight, so people will need to leave soon."" That was it. She gave no apology or explanation. I was pretty angry and did not expect this. She did not tell me specifically when I needed to leave, so I just continued working as I was busy. I had also just received a chat message from my brother unexpectedly who is hard to get in touch w/ and the entire time I was chatting w/ him I was worried someone was going to ask me to leave. (I could only chat w/ him on my laptop.) It was incredibly distracting and frustrating. Over 30 mins later! (almost 20 minutes till closing) another barista said to me ""Did someone let you know we are closing early tonight?"" I only replied with ""yes"" and kept working. She continued to sweep. A few minutes later she said ""I'm going to need to mop the floor."" I looked at her and said ""Oh, are you closing early so that you can clean?"" She replied in a flustered tone ""Oh. No...uh, we have an in house event tonight."" ""Okay"" I said and I kept working. The chairs had been put on the tables, the music turned off, and the lights began to be turned off. Hardly seemed like an ""in house event"" was happening that night. A few mins later, another barista said to me ""I need to lock the doors"". It was still 10-15 mins until closing. I began to leave, but respectfully explained my frustration w/ her. She only replied that it was the owner's decision to close early, so what could she do? I told her that someone should've informed me when I ordered that they were closing early and that they could've put up a sign on the door. ""We don't have signs."" Wow, I thought. You don't have a pen and paper? And no apology? No ownership at all that you could've done things differently? I replied by asking her for the owner's info and she mumbled her name and told me it was on the website (it's not). I even asked to get my money back and the barista did not even reply to me! Terrible. Don't waste your money here!",7,,

I stopped by one morning with a friend to grab a quick bite and some caffeine, expecting to be in and out and forget the place as another coffee shop in New York. Definitely not the case. Sal made our drinks and kept us entertained as he did so, telling us about the place and showing off his latte art skills (which is pretty good!).

You're the best, Sal. Both lattes were perfect.

I gave the dude working behind the counter $5 and he held it up in the air and scrutinized it 2X to check it....for the longest time. Yes you heard that right. For 5 bucks. Didn't use a pen and was SO obvious and RUDE. Never experienced this before in my life. I left w/ my coffee which btw was cold. I work as a CHEF in the industry and we would never treat our customers like this. 2 customers behind me also saw what happened and were aghast... When I asked him why he did that, his reply was that his manager told him to and that she doesn't give him those marker pens. I was SHOCKED. Seriously??I use to go there because it was close to my house, but I will NEVER take my family there ever again!!! And to the Owner:1. Your food tastes stale/old.2.

The young lady and the guy behind the counter seemed harried and completely ignored us for more than 7 minutes  despite the fact no one else was waiting at the counter and the man seemed determined not to acknowledge the repeated ""Excuse me!"" that my cousin uttered to get his attention. The young lady seemed to only concentrate on the patrons already seated around the establishment but not REALLY doing anything. We finally got served a Pecan Sweet Roll and a Pecan Crumble paired with large iced coffees that were ¾ ice and ¼ coffee which left no space for milk, sugar, etc. although we specifically asked for light ice and almond or soy milk.

Unfortunately an apartment incident involving one of New Yorkers' greatest housing fears lead me to move, forcing me to abandon my favorite local place to sip cold brew before our relationship could really take off. You can't ignore that Hamilton's is in Hamilton Heights and opened during peek the Hamilton craze. I'm not ashamed to admit that drew me in and added to the charm. You also can't ignore the large selection of baked goods and if all are as good as the cinnamon roll sample, you have reason to get out your wallet. I also find that it is hard to find a coffee shop with a couch in NYC. I'm a sucker for a couch, so when I saw the nice little comfy seating section amidst the tables and chairs, it sealed the seal.

I ordered a bird's nest with bacon and my friend ordered a bagel with lox. I would never order a bagel with lox here. They don't put the cream cheese on for you, and they just kind of toss all the lox and toppings in a container for you to deal with (even if its to stay). My bird's nest was good, but I actually did not love the pesto on it. Price was decent, and they have Toby's coffee. The inside is adorable, but for me you need to be able to sling a decent cafe breakfast to get 4 or 5 stars. The baked goods looked amazing though, so if you're looking for a sweet, try it.",3,,

I assumed that since I had ordered bread they would replace it with some kind of pastry item but instead I got a ham and cheese croissant which I will definitely not eat.

The home fries were a disappointment too and when we asked to switch them to fries the waiter said the bakery doesn't sell french fries!?

44,Megan B.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,2.0,11/2/2017,"I am currently writing this review from Irving Farm Coffee Roasters on 79th street, to which I just took a 20 minute train ride from where I live on 144th street, because the close proximity of Hamilton's Bakery isn't even a redeeming enough quality for me to bring my business here. It seems there is an epidemic in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of coffee shops trying to do too much and forgetting to focus on the basic requirements of a good coffee shop- good quality coffee and simple, delicious small bites and pastries.For a place that calls itself a bakery, I've never had a pastry here that wasn't crumbly and dry. At least that's one area of consistency. If you're looking for a decent pastry, you'd be better off saving your money and getting a donut from Dunkin Donuts or a cookie from Subway. The quality of product for the price is not at all worth it. The coffee is fine. Nothing to write home about. But again, for the amount they charge it's insulting to receive a cup of coffee that is just fine.It's a real disappointment because the space is big and beautiful. It could be a really great spot (though the lighting is harsh and uninviting) but it is not utilized properly. I have not been here for brunch, so I can't comment on the quality of that service, but I have been here for dinner, and I had to wait 45 minutes before receiving a simple flatbread, that was, again, fine.  To me it seems like this place is confused about what direction they want to go in, and as a result, they've lost any appeal as a coffee shop/bakery. I don't come here, and I would not recommend this place to anyone visiting or moving into the Hamilton Heights area.",2,,
45,Samantha R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",125,120,2,2.0,10/21/2017,"$6.53 for a cold brew iced coffee is legit insane, even if it is ""double caff"". I expected it to taste like stronger coffee but it didn't even taste like coffee - it tastes like a weirdly sour and sweet energy drink.  Awful.  After tasting it I walked back in asking if they had put sweetener in it (which I didn't want) and the barista said no, the double caff just tastes like that.  She did ask if I didn't like it and said she'd help me after the next customer, which was nice, but I was in a rush to get to work so I couldn't wait.  Now I'm still drinking this weird $7 energy coffee because I have nothing else and the sour aftertaste is driving me crazy.  It was a cute place and the breakfast items looked really good, but I can't recommend the coffee.",2,,

The interior is beautiful and well-decorated, and the staff were pleasant.While the menu of this bakery might expand, they didn't have a lot of options to eat. It was around 3pm and they had ran out of the soup, so the cashier recommended the chili. The chili was vegan which I am grateful for, and was pretty good, but I had been hoping for something a little lighter. Maybe I will check back another time to see if they have the soup, which was also listed as vegan.For a small bowl of chili and a small coffee, my total came to $9. The coffee was average- I kind of wished they had different choices, like a medium or dark roast. It was a medium roast and was just okay. It did the trick but didn't make me say ""wow, this is good coffee.""Given the other options in the neighborhood, I overall feel that this one was a little expensive for the quality and selection of items that they were offering. I realise that it is a new bakery and they did mention that next week oatmeal will be offered. I just wish that the coffee impressed me more, because I don't mind paying extra for coffee, but it just wasn't worth it.",6,,

61,Ashley E.,"Manhattan, NY",76,17,6,1.0,6/17/2017,"Let me begin by saying I am not leaving a one-star review out of vengeance, but simply because I want SO badly to love this place. It has so much potential and I have continued to come back in here to give it ""another shot"" time and again since the day it opened. But I think it's finally time to move on. In the past, my issues have been with flavor, texture, freshness, and consistency of the pastries/sandwiches. For example, the sticky buns have little flavor to the dough, and the caramel was not made properly and so was just hard sticky sugar with no warm buttery flavor. It's been rare that I received a pastry that actually tasted fresh. The two things I will say I have enjoyed, though, were the almond croissant (if you get a good batch) and the lemon bundt cake. I also tried one of their pizzas, the BBQ chicken. The dough was tasteless and super soft (I think it should have some crisp to it if you intend to eat your pizza without a fork). The sauce and the toppings were surprisingly flavorless as well, which is pretty hard to do with BBQ-anything. I guess on the upside, it was relatively inexpensive for the amount of food. But I'd pay more to have a smaller portion with better texture and flavor. Another positive point: the vegan chili. So good! And they even agreed to make several quarts of it for me to pick up the next day to serve to my friends at a gathering. Really pleasant experience that day and a great way to ""find the yes"" since they don't generally sell large batches. The woman who was helping me (a manager, I believe--not the owner, Jenna) was very kind and friendly. However, when I came to pick it up the next day at the arranged time, it was clearly not on anyone's radar. So I had to wait for it to be prepared and was late for my event. Thankfully, everyone enjoyed it as I expected. The service has been a problem more often than not, taking an unreasonable amount of time to make my drink or even forgetting my order (on more than one occasion). The staff is often too busy fooling around to be aware of customers' needs (this is not always true, but it was particularly while I was in there tonight). Anyway, this all brings me to my experience this evening. I was craving avocado toast and remembered that Hamiltons is serving it now. I hesitantly chose to come in and try it (I even chose it over Chipped Cup, with whom I also have been displeased in the past). I came in around 5pm, the place was virtually empty. I ordered the Broadway toast to stay and sat at a table. A good 15 minutes went by and I saw no sign of the toast, so I inquired. They forgot about my order. Mind you, I was sitting in clear view of the counter and there was no more than one other customer after me. So there's really no excuse for forgetting. They told me it will be another 7 minutes and I sat back down (but honestly how long does it really take to toast some bread and spread avocado on it?). 2 minutes later, the same girl who took my order comes to me and asks which toast I ordered. What?? ....... About 10 minutes later, a small piece of toast comes to me (no bigger than my hand) and I am shocked that I paid $8.50 for it. The toppings were fine, but the bread did not seem toasted at all. Felt more like just a firm piece of bread. No crispiness whatsoever. Definitely not worth the money or the 30-min wait.  I was offered a drink or pastry as an apology, which was a nice gesture, although does not fix or excuse the mistake. I agreed to a pastry and told her it didn't matter which one, just bring me whatever was freshest. Well, the pastry I received was topped with visibly dried out strawberries. So based on prior experience, I do believe that it was the freshest in the case. *deep breath*Needless to say, I am done putting hopeful energy into Hamiltons. But I do hope that improvements are made. I see that they are extending themselves to offer new foods, new structures, and new attractions, but I think what matters more than anything is the feeling you leave your customers with. And thus far, I've too often been left with a sour taste in my mouth from both the food and the service.",7,,

This is the kind of coffee shop I've been looking for aesthetically. So, so chic. And I love Chipped Cup (a few blocks north), but I love the amount of space that Hamilton's offers.Of course this is a matter of preference, but in my opinion, black coffee tastes better here than from Chipped Cup--doesn't have that sweet aftertaste like CC's does. Was not impressed at all by chocolate croissant--flavor was good but it was just flaky inside and out, rather than flaky on outside and softer/more ""chewy"" (perhaps not the right word) on inside.My biggest ""complaint"" is the lighting (or lack there-of) upstairs and in the seating area across from the couches/chairs. Even if you weren't trying to do work but maybe just read leisurely or catch up with a friend--hell, even if you're on a date--the extremely dim lighting just felt out of place for a coffee shop. I appreciate that this is a place where people can come and get work done, but I need some light to get my hustle on! I was falling asleep at a time when I would normally feel energized (plus I was even drinking coffee!).

72,Jocelyn G.,"East Haven, CT",214,10,0,2.0,5/27/2017,"I wish they tried to do less. Their identity seems off...they started out as just a cafe like their name suggests so people do go there looking for coffee and a place to study, but now they also do dinner, brunch, more food options and have ""table seating"" on one side of the establishment which seems like a waste of space on week nights. The music is slightly too loud to be able to study effectively (without noise-cancelling headphones) and at times other patrons also seem oblivious to the fact that people in the ""cafe"" are are looking for a place to study.Their food is overpriced when they charge ~$8.30 (can't remember the exact change) for a sandwich, which is glaringly obvious when there's literally a bodega right next to them where you could get a sandwich for ~$5. I've had a few of their pastries and they've all been ok but not really worth the calories (smores cookie, bird's nest, and croissant).

76,Grace K.,"New York, NY",226,50,52,5.0,12/4/2016,"I came here on a weeknight and there were plenty of spaces. The right side of the cafe is open to everyone, but once it hits 5:30pm they reserve it for dinner space only. There is more limited seating on the left side, but it was still easy to find seats. I enjoyed the music they played - not too loud or crazy.The interior design was also very cute. Brick walls with cute paintings in the study area with a more intimate setting for the dinner area. The tables were decorated with lit candles and darker lighting for the dinner setting. I think it's a cute place for casual, intimate dates. The coffee was also on point. I got the vanilla latte. It was not too sweet and still strong enough.It was overall a great study environment. I would totally come back here again",1,1,

I love the homie vibe, plenty of space and friendly staff. Can potentially be a 5 star review but unfortunately the staff is not sure how to charge an oatmeal with almond milk ( oatmeal $2.36) awesome price but when you ask for almond milk $2.00 extra,seems to be almost the same price as the oatmeal ( no modified bottom therefore I had to pay the $2.00 for a bit more than a splash of milk not reasonable)I like the overall idea of this place just think the owner should make sure  the staff are ready for customers accommodations.",1,,

We both got sandwiches, chicken curry and veggie (about $9 each) - big mistake. It was obvious as we both unwrapped them that they had been sitting for a while. The lettuce on my chicken curry was wilted and looking very sad, the bread was fine but was just regular sliced bread, and the chicken was sparse. His sandwich was a ball of hummus and red pepper, bread totally soggy. Not sure why they're even selling sandwiches if this is the quality that they're averaging. I would also expect a better product from this price point. Not sure if anything else here is good but I'll never be coming back to find out.",2,1,

I came into Hamilton suffering from the heat and my need for a midday afternoon coffee fix. The cinnamon roll was looking at me from behind the glass, it's gooey warmth calling my name. I thought to myself, ""no Angela it's almost dinner time!"" But couldn't resist the temptation and decided it would make a great post dinner sweet treat....YEAH RIGHT. The smell alone captivated my senses, I totally caved and spoiled my dinner, and it was the best decision I made all day. Fine establishment indeed!

Last week, while visiting said friends, had to spend 1/2 a day working on my laptop and tried out this spot. The decor is adorable! Very inviting, warm, cozy vibe. The wi-fi was fast (much needed and a high priority for me when it comes to coffee shops, as there is nothing more frustrating than paying $5 for coffee at a cafe in order to basically have a ""home office day"", only to learn that your ""home office"" has crap wi-fi and you can't get any work done!).My other ""home office"" cafe Must Have is a Chai Latte (not much of a coffee drinker); thumbs up there too. Unfortunately, I found a new addiction, a cookie s'more? :O I think this ""home office might be a little too addictive to me. =/All in all, a great place for me to sit with some treats, get some work done, and feel a lot more inspired than sitting in a friend's apartment trying to get computer tasks done!",5,3,3

Updated review","Hamilton's Bakery is an absolute gem! I live on the upper west side, a friend brought me there once and YES it is worth it to go back up to Hamiltons again. It's our go too spot for weekend brunch and I've had dinner there twice! Excellent! I had a chicken pizza with avocado, it was amazing. They always have great home cooked soups and my husband is vegan and there's always a vegan soup and vegan pizza. This feels like a true bakery with fresh baked sweetness that I see them bringing up from the downstairs oven! I just LOVE this place!",,,
89,G F.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/20/2018,I love this place. A great vibe in the neighborhood with excellent homemade baked goods. Even soups and sandwiches. And beer! A great place to wind down at the end of the day or to have a morning cup of coffee or tea.,,,

I love that they use Califia farms almond milk, as it is, in my opinion,the best one for lattes!! I also tried the s'mores cookie (EVERYTHING!) and the Parmesan birds nest (also everything). It is a little on the pricey end- my fiancé and I spent around $20 for coffees, food, and pastries, but everything is made in house and I'm sure with love. Also- Hamilton Heights is the new Hells Kitchen so get used to these prices.",4,4,2
94,V P.,"New York, NY",0,20,5,5.0,10/24/2017,"Good, good, good vibes in this place. The layout is perfect: clean, spacious and reminiscent of the comfort of ""home"". Cool, diverse playlist. I've never witnessed any loud - talking or obnoxiousness here. The staff are friendly, attentive and efficient. I would love to try other food and pastry options, but just can't seem to break away from that lemon bundt cake!! Issa problem! A couple of years ago, I conversed with the owner who is super cool, yet serious about her business. It is evident that her sincerity sets the precedence for how she runs her storefront. Other businesses in the area need to take notes... for real...",1,1,

96,Irene V.,"New York, NY",64,29,2,2.0,12/6/2016,"So I've been here about five or six times in the last year, mostly because it's really big and a comfortable setting to do work. Cons: Their pastries have not wowed me and for the price they really should. Also, two different times they have been stale. I mean, this is Hamilton Heights, yo. We are not in the chi chi West Village or hip Brooklyn. I love my neighborhood but the prices do not reflect the quality nor are they on par with the cost of living up here.  Also, I come here in the evenings when I have work to do, since they are open until 10:00. However, the past several times I have been here in the evening, at around 7:30-8:00 they start cleaning up and make a ruckus! I understand that it's gotta suck working in the evenings, but if the establishment is open until 10:00, don't start making all sorts of cleaning noises to get us out faster. Closer earlier if that's the case, and save us all the trouble. The most annoying thing about this place are the baristas. Now, I will say that I have had a mixed bag of service, from clueless to really great all around, to snobby (twice). I have no patience when two baristas are chatting away instead of preparing my order. I understand if they are swamped and they are coming up for air and taking a quick break but if it is just me and only me standing there waiting for them to take a pastry and plop it on the plate, I really do not need to hear their 5 minute personal conversation. If this seems harsh, sorry, but I worked with the public for many years. Don't leave people waiting for no reason.Dinner service? They are using up a lot of tables for something that is not happening. Maybe do it on the weekends and keep that space open for those of us who are here to work? I mean, there was plenty of space regardless, so just my two cents.Pros: The drinks are fairly good. I've had both coffee and iced teas here and I approve. The music in the back ground is usually pleasant, if not a touch too loud. The temperature is comfortable. They have a variety of food, which is also very nice. Free, decent wi-fi helps me get my report cards and lesson planning done efficiently. Thank you for that!I really want to like this place but just cannot bring myself to give it a better grade. I feel like you can do better, Hamilton's!",,,
97,Heleya d.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,0,2.0,9/29/2017,"Obnoxiously loud music and over-priced, mediocre drinks. If I'm going to pay nearly $6 (which I do sometimes when I want to treat myself), then it should be a stellar drink made by a trained professional. The barista ringing me up charged me for the wrong drink, which was an overcharge of about $1. Whatever. Not worth making a big deal, but the latte had enormous bubbles in it and was not filled to the top of the cup with milk. $6? I want perfection. Probably wouldn't have minded so much if I could actually think straight to do my work, but the club music is making it hard. It would be impossible to have a conversation in here. And then the wifi was spotty and went out entirely.",2,,
98,Ken G.,"New York, NY",23,15,6,4.0,5/14/2016,"Love this place! The neighborhood has its fair share of coffeeshops, but none can match the cheerful ambiance and fresh bread of this newcomer. We came on a Saturday morning to a efficiently run line and friendly baristas. I sampled the raisin crackle bread while waiting (delicious- and that's coming from someone who hates raisins) and enjoyed the reading material on the chalkboard walls. Hamilton's does a great job of being unpretentious, a gold-medal achievement considering they're a cafe in a gentrifying neighborhood with an emphasis on wholesome ingredients. There's more than enough well-decorated space to stretch out, something I'll enjoy until the shop is inevitably overrun by zombie people on their laptops like The Chipped Cup. Speaking of Mr. Cup, the coffee at Hamilton's blows away their brew- my mocha was top-notch, and paired well with the bacon bird's nest(imagine an eggy popover). The cookies looked exciting, the s'mores one specifically, but at $4 each, I passed. Maybe next time, but that's Levain territory at that price point, and those are meal-sized in addition to being heavenly. Everything else seemed fairly reasonably priced, including the sandwiches and salads in the refrigerated case which I wouldn't hesitate to grab if I was in the mood. All in all, hats off to Hamilton's, and welcome to the neighborhood!",4,1,

Updated review","Update 6/18/16: they have decaf now! yay! when I went the first time the barista told me they didn't have decaf but didn't mention that it was just temporary (until their grinder got fixed). pleased to report that I just had a delicious decaffeinated iced coffee beverage.I was so excited about a new, good coffee shop around here...but they don't have decaf coffee of any kind. so if you had to stop drinking caffeinated coffee for health reasons, say, or because you simply don't like it, head somewhere else. shame because it's a cute space and the pastries looked good.",1,,1

The space is comfortable and homey, super cool chandeliers/lighting and exposed brick walls. We hadn't eaten breakfast yet so we each sampled a few items from the bakery paired with large cold-brew coffees. They had almond milk for my coffee, so I was a happy camper. Everything tasted like top-notch, quality ingredients. Stand-out pastries included the Bird's Nest (it's nice they offer it w or w/o bacon) and the Jack Daniel's spiked pull-apart muffin. There were tons of other tempting items to try but that will have to wait until next time. Also, the counter-staff were all in good moods and put a smile on my face.

Pretty overpriced, so I probably wouldn't repeat it, but it was mindblowingly good. The treats also looked outstanding, but very glutinous (not a typo, friends), and therefore not for me. Brunch also looked great, but I never got a chance to try it. I never actually came here to work as planned, so can't comment on the workability of the space itself.

The cookies are all kept a warmer so they're nice and toasty anytime of the day. That said, the s'mores cookies are quite sweet so not perfect for people who aren't that into super sweet things.

It also has many tables if you want to have food. In addition they even have a secluded area with no speakers. I guess for those who are really into there work. Now the coffee is solid. Granted its not on the level of Monkey Cup. I think what is confusing for me is the pastries. Now they are baked on premises. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. They have 4 flavors. Normal, one with nuts on it, bacon and nutella. I love the nutella the best. The cookies are also really good. I think the problem comes in with the cakes, muffins etc. They can be dry sometimes. Even stale. Also the croissants are a must avoid. The almond especially. It tasted very chemically and unnatural. It was also a little dry. Overall a great place if you know what to order.

And for me, because of the service I received today, I will never step foot back into Hamilton's again.I stopped in today to study, have a meal, and a drink after a long day at school. The guy at the counter greeted me and was very friendly. I ordered and he asked for my ID. My wallet completely emptied in my huge book bag and I was having a problem finding it. I paid for the meal, and took my bag over to a table to empty the contents of my bag to find it. I found it and returned to the counter. A lady with blonde hair and an attitude takes my ID and studies it. And OK, I get it, I look pretty young. But after a few seconds went by and she was still looking at it I asked ""is everything alright, I've noticed you've been looking at my ID for some time"" She responds ""well, you look really young and this ID is kinda messed up so I'm just making sure"". Okkkkkk. After telling her my ID was a New York State issued ID, she says ""well, fake ID's look really good nowadays"". Really?! I'm a customer. You don't speak to customers that way!! If I was a minor, why would I go through all that trouble to search for my ID, to have ONE glass of wine, in a cafe? Really? I've worked in hospitality for 9 years. I know how serious it is serving to minors so I totally understand that she was doing her job, but her attitude was totally 100% unnecessary. And working in hospitality you should know to treat people with kindness and respect. People can use their laptops anywhere but they choose to go to cafes, like Hamiltons, for a clear head space and a positive environment. So I was really confused why she was being so snappy.  Accusing my ID of being fake, and giving me attitude, because you THINK i'm a minor, when you have my New York State ID in your hand? Girl. C'mon. I immediately lost my appetite and left. Never again.",2,,

122,Alec H.,"New York, NY",111,22,1,1.0,5/16/2016,"Echoing the prior review below, stepping into this place feels like you've been magically transported to Tribeca, land of douchebag financiers and overpriced everything. This neighborhood has needed a bakery for the many long years I've lived here, and everyone was excited about this new shop. Going for the first time yesterday, my disappointment with the baked offerings (we don't need any more coffee shops) was quickly replaced by white-hot rage at the prices. $8 for a puny sandwich, $4 for a demi-baguette posing as a full, $4 cookies (Levain's this isn't!) and $7 loaves of bread. GTFO. You arrive in this neighborhood with a wave of downtown-style gentrification, with your higher-than downtown prices, and call yourself ""Hamilton's"", because hey, that's the only thing people know about our neighborhood, right? The casual use of the old names, putting ""Harlem"", ""Hamilton"" or ""Sugar Hill"" on everything in the store really provides a strong claim to authenticity, I'm sure. If the owner knew anything, and I mean anything, about the people who have lived here for generations, or even those who arrived in recent years, he or she would have realized that these prices are offensive and insulting. I don't know if you're just ignorant of your new context, or aware of it and simply flippant about it, but you have some serious dog-whistle politics going on here, and I find it disgusting, as do many other long-term residents.

123,L K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,2.0,5/16/2016,"I was excited to hear about a new bakery opening up in the neighborhood however my recent visit there left much to be desired.  The space is large and well-designed but the prices of the baked goods, coffees, and savory items are outrageous.  The loaves of bread reach prices of $6-$7, a flat white was over $4, cold packaged sandwiches are $8.    I should add that I was not terribly impressed with the selection of breads on offer, it seems like this establishment is more of a coffee shop than a proper bakery.  That would be fine under other circumstances, but once again the prices here are just far too high and don't make it too welcoming to people from the neighborhood.  In sum: very disappointing to see businesses open up here that are so out of touch with local people's earnings and budgets.  This is a cute place, I would strongly urge the owners to reconsider their price structure.",14,,3

I've gone here countless times to get coffee at what does not seem like an unreasonable hour - 7:45am on a weekday and 8:35am on a Saturday - and they're not open. This is so frustrating, coffee shops should be open early! I can't chance not having coffee so, I'll be going elsewhere for my early morning cup of joe from now on. Open earlier and I'll be back!",1,,

130,Rasheeda R.,"Bronx, NY",33,84,10,1.0,5/19/2016,"I'm not a huge coffee drinker. I can't comment on the quality of the brews. However, I came there with a friend to get a pastry. The pastry was ok. The cheese danish was neither earth shattering nor mind blowing; it was just okay. My friend really enjoyed his coffee. What sucked was the attitude of one of the staff members. I came into the establishment with a pizza box. We paid for the coffee and pastry. The staff member then decided to tell me that I can't eat the pizza in the bakery. Ummm, who told you I was eating a pizza in your establishment sir? I proceeded to tell him I wasn't eating a pizza there. He continued on telling me about the health code violations. Did you not just hear what I said about me not eating a pizza there? That was kind of a weird and rude assumption to think that I was eating a pizza there. I then repeat that I'm not eating there and he proceeds to say oh. No apology from this man at all. I regret the tip that I left this clearly non customer centric person. To have a sign out stating on good vibes, it would be good if the employees put good vibes out. It totally turned me off and we didn't stay longer than was needed for me to eat the danish. I sincerely hope there aren't a bunch of people coming in eating food from outside establishments, but as they just opened I would be shocked if that was the case. Even so, the accusatory nature of his comment didn't leave me thinking, this is where I need to have lunch tomorrow. The people at the Chipped Cup and Monkey Cup were friendly and their pastries were just as good or better. The boxed pizza was leftovers that I couldn't finish from Draft House, which is also another amazing place in the neighborhood with good customer service. Maybe this employee should be trained by the people who work there.",5,1,1

137,Laurel H.,"Manhattan, NY",234,30,33,3.0,4/9/2017,"Okay, so I have been spending A LOT of time here during the semester because I basically study non-stop. The staff here is so nice and they even remember your order. I like coming here because some other local coffee shops have staff that are snobby or rude. I haven't had any bad experiences with them and I look forward to seeing them every time I come! The drinks they make here are of really high quality and it's always consistent. They even have matcha lattes (YUM!) The only downfall is their food offerings. The tomato and basil soup really just tastes like tomato sauce to me, and the only vegetarian sandwich they have is a peanut butter and jelly, which is nice, but it gets a little boring. I'm not a huge fan of the baked goods, as they always taste dry to me and lacking some of that wow factor. They also serve the bagels with cream cheese in individually wrapped containers which is strange to me. Overall, the employees and the drinks really make the experience, and the baked goods and cafe food options are lacking some wow factor. I will definitely come here for as long as I live in the area, but I will just try not to come hungry.",1,,

For us Hamilton Heights residents this is definitely a relief since the influx of yuppies to the area leaves little room for us to survive on The Chipped Cup alone. Hamilton's is SPACIOUS and from what my roommate tells me, you don't have to ask for an internet code every 45 minutes. You simply connect and stay connected. I got the raspberry tart this morning and an iced mocha (came out to about $8) and was pretty tasty. The selection of pastries seems diverse and unique. They definitely have the cliched chocolate croissant and bagels, but they have much more to offer. I peeked over at the sandwiches and they looked pretty good too but I can't say from experience. They also have fresh baked bread! I'll be stopping in this afternoon to try some and inquire where it's baked. The iced mocha was yummy- I didn't add any sugar and it wasn't sweet but definitely refreshing. I love the open, airy vibe that Hamilton's offers- stark contrast to the brooding/ dark vibe of Chipped Cup; I'll be coming back for the friendly baristas/ cashiers and to try more items from the menu.",2,,

A bowl-shaped piece of flaky crust, a pesto base, with an eggy center topped by thick-cut bacon bites. For dinner, try the rice/quinoa bowls - create your own or choose one of their creations. My fave is the Burr; black beans, bacon, a generous serving of avocado and a perfect chipotle mayo to top it off.

The latte was good, but the main attraction was DEFINITELY the food!I tried the bird's nest, which was great, and I could see myself getting regularly if I lived closer. The bread/egg balance was perfect, and the egg was a great kick of protein. The cinnamon roll was perfectly flaky and sweet, without having TOO much frosting/cinnamon, which can be a problem with other rolls. And the banana bread just might be the best banana bread I've ever had. I bought a loaf to take to the convention I was at, and everyone who tried it there agreed.I really enjoyed the ambiance -- cozy, and comfortable, not too over the top, but just over the top enough to feel more like a business and less like stopping by my aunt's house for tea.I highly recommend trying it out, and will definitely be back the next time I'm nearby for business.",,,

They were were on par with the best bakery's in NY. Oh my goodness what a difference a year makes! The croissant I was served was terrible. Dry, like something you would get at a supermarket.No body, and and there was little filling and what filling was there had little taste. It had a texture closer to ""Wonder Bread"" disguised as croissant. I was disappointed to say the least.  I asked for a supervisor who seem uninterested in my comments. She did ask if I wanted anything thing else. I politely declined. I only ingest food that tastes good and I was not prepared to go through another negative experience. The place has a special ambiance but seems unwilling to acknowledge problems and act to correct them. I've been reading reviews for the past several months - many have had complaints similar to mine.

159,Michael K.,"Manhattan, NY",119,45,0,1.0,5/21/2016,I was so looking forward to thew opening of this new bakery in the neighborhood. We have had a small increase in decent food competing with the general crap that is offered around here from Dominos to Kentucky Fried Chicken and of course the ubiquitous Dunken Donuts.Well my first visit is my last. The place resembles a string of such hipster coffee places I used to visit in Seattle ten years ago. And with its wrong scaled chandelier at the entrance the odd displays cases the rather dark and uninviting second room doesn't make you fee like you want to hang out a sip coffee while reading the latest on your laptop or iPad. The cappuccino was ok but really a paper cup? And then the pastries all home made are so over priced as to turn you off completely plus displayed poorly. Finally the baked goods seem to be hiding behind the counter. Nothing looked very appetizing and well it just didn't feel like second visit would win me over. Staff was friendly enough but no one looked like they had a clue as to what was going on...it just felt so amateurish. And of course there is always that need to pipe in bad music to make up for the ambience.How the people around here survive on the poor quality that is sold locally as bread astounds me. The grocery store is a joke and the smaller shops are no better. Back to the Westside Market I will go and tis a pity since I was hoping beyond hope that there would be a place to go around here that was not a bar...four new ones in as many months. At one time a great bakery was as important in a neighborhood as a shoe repair shop...ooops I have given away my age.,3,,

There is no longer a need to hop on a train to find a comfortable coffee shop you can actually stay inside. The ambiance is homey and chic, the staff friendly and knowledgeable. The food is at a much higher quality than any neighboring coffee shops, and the variety offered makes it worth the trip. In other reviews people seem to be having problems with the prices, but I find them realistic for the experience provided. Our neighborhood is changing, that's true! It makes it a livable area instead of a commutable one. Let's embrace that instead of pushing new and inventive small businesses out for charging a few dollars more for a homemade croissant. You can all keep eating the processed foods found anywhere else in the area. I'll be at Hamilton's!",2,,2

163,Rebecca F.,"Asbury Park, NJ",0,2,0,2.0,7/14/2016,"I was so happy to see a new spot in Washington Heights! A friend of mine and I stopped in just to take a look one evening (really friendly staff, clean and the coffee smelled delicious!) and then I came back a week later on a Saturday afternoon with my husband and stayed. We enjoyed some tasty caramel flavored iced coffee and an incredibly decadent peanut butter chocolate cookie, and I was happy to get a Hamilton's card because I knew I'd be back.I thought I'd stop by this morning on my way to work, and I was incredibly disappointed.  Disappointed enough to *NOT* go back again.  I ordered the same caramel iced coffee and a cheese birds nest (which looked yummy in the glass case). I noticed that the birds nest (basically a small quiche) was not warm, but figured it was already a hot day and would be fine.  The iced coffee, after tasting it, didn't have any caramel taste so I went back. I asked if it had been made with caramel flavoring and was told that they had just brought it back.  It wasn't a syrup, though, it was actual caramel and when I inquired about a syrup I was told they made everything on the premises.  Yes.  I get that.  It's part of the appeal. I was then asked to ""say when"" when I felt I had enough caramel.  I was already feeling a bit frustrated so just said enough but it wasn't flavoring.  I'm not sure what was done on the Saturday before, but for sure there needs to be some staff training.Then, to add to my disappointment, the eggs that comprised the birds nest were basically rubber.  They may have been made on the premises, but they must have been sitting around for a day or two.  I took one bite, threw them out, and left the store. That's $11 (YES ELEVEN DOLLARS FOR RUBBER EGGS AND AN ILL-MADE ICED COFFEE).Chipped Cup will be getting my business from now on.",1,,
