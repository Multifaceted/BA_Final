You either love or can't stand your local teams. Growing as a kid going to Madison Square Garden is one my favorite things to do as kid.From watching the New York Nicks. Also the New York Rangers. So amazing concerts. No questions you have the craziest fans in the world. When you live in New York and your team not doing well. The hole town will let you know. When your teams are winning. Everybody is a hero.Overall Madison Square Garden has be redone to finished renovation of any sports arenas in the states. If you are visiting New York City and are a sports fan. Then you will enjoy your time at Madison Square Garden.,55,28,55

Ive been to msg for comedy, games and concerts. I feel like the screens on the 200 levels should be upgraded though, the ladies room could also do some upgrade, comparing it to the Barclay Center, msg has some upgrades to do.

I'd like to say they looked terrific, except for the cable management by MSG.Paid a steep price for great seats in section 102, with an awesome view of the stage. Would never know it from MSG's site, though - had to go to SeatGeek to find actual photos of the view before I bought the tickets. Sad.We get there, only to have a view obstructed by a thick bundle of cables run from the ceiling down to the AV setup. Seriously?You mean they really couldn't have run those cables up from the floor?Either the AV people didn't know any better (doubtful), or they didn't care.For what I paid, for a world-class venue like MSG, that's not okay. Fail. One extra star for Paul Simon, b/c it *is* Paul Simon.",,,
3,Donathon C.,"San Diego, CA",16,121,377,5.0,10/26/2018,"** New York Knicks game SEAT Review **I'm sure people look thru yelp like I did trying to find reviews about where is good to sit for a Knicks game. Here's my recommendation to help ease your struggle. I really liked my seats and section and would recommend them to anyone who wants to be close enough to the action, but far enough away that you're NOT spending $400+ per ticket. We sat in seats:Sec 209, Row 1, Seat 1 - 2Perks:* Our section 209 is close enough to mid court and close enough to the action... and the price is better than those seats closer to the middle of the court for the price* ROW 1 has their own personal TV that you can switch between channels for different angels of the game! * ROW 1 gives a lot more leg room and a ledge to set your food and drinks on* ROW 1 has no one in front of you! Obviously the closer to the court and closer to the mid court you are the better the seat. But you'll also pay exponentially more for them. Our section was the perfect price and close enough to the action to make our experience great. Also... GO ROW 1... you'll thank me later for the extra leg room, ledge for food and drinks, and no one in front of you!",1,,

5,Tasha H.,"Queens, NY",15,40,38,4.0,10/15/2018,"I come here all the time with my dad for NBA games. (Dad's a die hard Knicks fan). I don't like public transportation but I don't mind taking the LIRR from Jamaica Station to Penn Station since it's a very quick and easy 20 min ride. It is expensive though (as of 10/16/2018, fare is $15 off peak round trip for 1 adult and $10 for senior). Getting into the venue is very organized as there are signs everywhere and many employees to answer any questions you may have. My only complaint would be that the seats are so small but other than that Madison Square Garden is always a fun time with decent food and of course, my good ol' cotton candy. Also, I always get section 100 seats and these are very good seats. Close enough for the price. All they need to do is lower a few of those prices ($13.50 for Stella beer!) and it'll be 5 stars from me!",,,
6,Susan S.,"Clarence, NY",24,36,38,3.0,11/19/2018,"My first time here and I was very excited. We were sent an email giving us instructions on where to enter the arena so we went to one of the places they specified. There were about 15 other people there who received the email too. We waited till the time they said the doors would open but they didn't. My husband finally hunted someone down who worked there who told him they were not using that door that night. We only got the email the day before! So we went to find another entrance which of course had a very long line. You have to go up multiple escalators but that was fine.We found our seats and they were great and pretty roomy too. The only other drawbacks were that the vendors were very far apart and when the concert was over you have to take those same escalators down. The only thing is they don't reverse them like I am accustomed to, you just have to walk down them with them not running which was a very slow process as it was difficult for many people. In spite of all that I loved the concert!",,,
7,Carly M.,"Toronto, Canada",106,55,102,5.0,9/30/2018,"I just saw Billy Joel perform here tonight. Wow! First concert in NYC and by far one of the most memorable of all I've ever been to. MSG is very easy to get to and is mid-town. It's large but not overwhelming. The best kept secret for Billy Joel is that his stage doesn't have a back to it, so if you sit behind the stage you have an AMAZING view. I sat row 14 in section 113 and the view was unobstructed - full view of Billy (his piano is on a 360 rotating platform) and his band. I didn't have any food or drinks but they looked pricy, as most of these venues are. Unreal experience!",,,
8,Frank T.,"Merrick, NY",93,407,1457,4.0,9/26/2018,"One of the better large venues for concerts. Not the greatest sight lines but they do have those big screens so you get a decent view even from the ""cheap"" seats. Sound quality for an ELO concert was excellent, not too loud where the sound is distorted but loud enough to drown out the audience chatter. Great location, get off the LIRR walk upstairs and your in MSG. Security did a great job moving people but were careful checking bags, etc. Only about a 5 minute wait to get in.Biggest downside is the ridiculous prices for beer, wine, mixed drinks. Water bottle $5, what a rip off and you can't bring your own water bottle. Forget about prices for food. Just eat out before you go to a concert or game.Another downside is the idiots who can't hold their bladder for an hour and half or have to get a beer every 10 minutes ergo creating the above mentioned bladder issue. If you need to get up constantly during the main event get an aisle seat. Then you get the potheads that need to get their high during the concert. Again do your drinking and drugs before the concert, who needs to smell your nasty weed.",7,2,5

Every single person I came into contact with was helpful and accomadating, something I don't expect at concert venues, but absolutely appreciate. My sensitive companion needed some ear plugs and customer service came in clutch.  Walking a bit around the lobby it's hard to miss the plentiful souvenier shops. The food options within the venue are more expansive than those available in most small American towns. Prices are inflated, as expected, but actually not as bad as I'd expect.Our seats were comfortable and the sound quality was excelent. I apways dread going to concerts at big arenas (with all the crazy crowds and inevitable dissapointment at how far you are from the stage) but the Garden absolutely delivered in every way possible.This new New Yorker is excited for future concerts here!",1,1,1

What an iconic landmark & of course it didn't hurt that we had front row tickets!!! Side note: The arena is so massive that I wouldn't want to see a concert or game from the nosebleeds. I don't have a fear of heights, but a seat up there might just do me in. Heavy security presence was much appreciated. Pristine floor & seats; well-kept bathrooms. Soda was $6, which the vendor empties into a reusable plastic cup. An absolutely unforgettable evening, but I suspect any event held at the Garden is pretty special.",4,4,5

We were at a sold out show of over 19,000 people, which was pretty cool!*the staff at MSG were surprisingly rude and nasty. They gave off a very snobbish attitude like they don't even want to acknowledge you and just can't believe people would actually have questions *roll eyes. (A dude legit rolled his eyes at us.) It was also a highly disorganized show- the scanners were not working properly so everybody was not seated on time which caused the show to be delayed for about an hour. Unacceptable!*Tip: Do NOT take your phone out for any reason once you get to Kevin Hart's show! There are designated areas outside where you can talk on the phone but if you're sitting, don't even think about texting, tweeting, taking pictures, checking facebooks, answering phone calls, etc because they're really strict and will eject you with NO second chances! They have signs about this everywhere and security will kick you out without giving you a refund. So just turn your phones OFF. (Kevin Hart said they kicked out 200 people at one show.. They do not play!)",4,4,6

However, this had nothing to do with the place. I came back here after so many years to watch Maroon 5 last week. It was a great show! We got bud light beer and the chicken with fries. I have to say that the meal was so-so, not the greatest chicken I have ever had. However, it did its job in providing something to snack on. It was easy to find our seats, but I wish they had more staff available to direct people. Usually, they have staff at every entry point so that you are able to find your seat. But in any case, we figured it out (it wasn't hard). I would definitely come back here.

It's a great place to watch concerts too. The security was very visible everywhere. When you enter make sure you don't have any water bottle. You will need to throw it before passing the security guys. It's such a waste I had to bring water for us so we don't need to buy water. But we ended up growing them anyway.

Updated review","I've been here for Rangers games and 5 starred that. Well another 5 star coming. Went to the U2 show on June 25th. What a great show. I sat behind the stage, which is funny because this is the closet I've ever been because I've only seen them in large football domed stadiums. The sound was incredible and as clear as clear can get. I've seen Springsteen and Billy Joel here and that why I came back again. This is definitely a world class arena. The ushers were fantastic showing us to our seats and informing the nearest restroom. Security getting in was painless. I would highly recommend checking out a show here. It is well worth it.",1,,

Not only is it my first time in NYC , but my boyfriend who is a huge sports fan made it a point to come here and experience this wonder . Literally 10 min after the game was over I use the restroom and we all get told to hurry because the lights will get turned off on us . On top of that we finally get to the escalators and all floors are turned off . Like ? Is this not a safety hazard for many reasons ? Crowds of people walking down floors of slippery escalators. Not impressed by the most famous arena .",,,

I had decent seats and the fight was okay. Security was on it and I loved it--perfect balance of chill and duty. The entrance was hard to find though. If I'm ever in NY again, I'd love to go a Knick's game here.Like any sporting venue, the alcohol is expensive, but they get points for having hard cider. The chicken sando was decent to boot. I rather enjoyed myself and think it's a great venue for boxing.",,,

24,Amanda P.,"Union, NJ",208,75,49,5.0,8/7/2018,"Une beauté. A treasure. Madison Square Garden is a masterpiece, a true gem. The Garden is the kind of experience that always leaves its patrons in awe with fond memories to think back on. But where to begin? My most recent venture here was to see Harry Styles in concert (I've only ever been to the Garden to see a musical performance). Aside from him being fantastic, MSG itself was in rare form that night, just as it always is. The persons who checked my bag on the way in were friendly and let me keep a shot of alcohol in my purse (I shouldn't have brought it but a drink costs like $9-13 inside so yeah) and were friendly through the process. The concierge who checked us in and directed us towards the section our seats were in was also hospitable. Before going to our seats, my boyfriend and I decided to use the bathroom so we took turns. When I came back to find him so he could go, he was talking to one of the people who worked there as an usher so when we switched, I had a great conversation with him about the history of the Garden and how it differs from other venues and it does; at MetLife, the facility can be sloppy, a little messy, and scarily unorganized, PNC is the same but worse.The food here is decent, about what you'd get at any other reputable venue. The drink service here is actually pretty good, you're not getting stiffed when you order a mixed drink. I love this place. It's really the best to go see a concert, even if you have crappy seats, and I normally have crappy seats.",6,3,4

Ok, maybe a little extreme, but if you don't live in NY and you are a fan of sports or music, this is a bucket list venue to at least experience once. Unlike so many things that have a ton of hype and then tend to fall short, I'm pleased to say that this place isn't one of those places. I may be a little partial, but I came here for the Halsey Badlands tour....sold out to her home town crowd, she pulled out all the stops and put on a performance for the ages. Loved her music before...even better after.The venue itself is massive! Clean and well laid out, this is a perfect example of how a stadium experience should be. From the second you approach the building and the bright lights light up the night sky, you know you are in for an experience.Vending stations are abundant throughout the stadium as well and are priced just like any other stadium you attend.I was very impressed and look forward to coming back.

Home to the New York Knicks, Liberty and Rangers (aka: the blue skirts) MSG was purchased by cable barron Charles Dolan and left most all of his operational decision making to his ill equipt son, James. You know him, Isaiah Thomas lovin', The Wiz purchasin' son who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. Yea, him.Yet as oblivious as he appears, the Knicks and too a lesser extent, the Rangers remain a hot ticket in New York City. Not because its a competitive team, not because they're an interesting team -- its just entertainment, like going to a Broadway show -- just too say you did. For myself, my expeditions to Penn Plaza are mainly concert related. Catching some of the great bands of yester-year still holds a high level if entertainment value and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.Drinks and food won't disappoint our classical conditioning of getting royally ripped off as a beer and a shot ran me twenty eight dollars not including tip last night. Staff really does a fine job taking the steps necessary to ensure complete and total customer satisfaction.

We sat in the 200 seats (nosebleed section) which weren't the best seats but that was on us. Because it was so far from the stage it would have been nice to view the concert via the large screen behind the band. However that was not an option because extra large speakers hung from the ceiling blocking a good portion of the screen. Speaking of speakers, that was my other problem.

Sound quality is great, seats are comfortable, and you pretty much have a decent view no matter where your seats are located.I've always felt safe here given the security presence and extensive bag check. However, my most recent visit caused me to have doubt in the security here. People in the rows behind us became angry when we stood during some of the more well-known songs. Not only did they call us names loudly, they threw beer and threatened us. When I informed security, nothing was done, which was disappointing. I was really scared for my safety, particularly when leaving the venue, as I thought these individuals might try to get us when we exited.

Even seeing that I was very, very pregnant. The concert we saw was great and loud like always. At one point thought the whole thing was gonna give away cause of all the fans jumping to the music.

I wish tickets were cheaper, especially for the basketball games, but if you're a New Yorker you understand the price tag comes with the experience! The food options are plentiful and so are the bars - both overpriced as well but again its the Garden lol. Seats are ok, the best sections if you're in a budget are in the 200s - a little far up but you can see perfectly without being bothered by the jumbotron as much.

You can drink it with straws and it does not spill everywhere when you carry them to your seats. It's not really environmentally friendly, but if someone could figure this out, it would be amazing. Bathrooms were clean and plentiful, so I never had to wait. Not sure how they manage this, but seriously who has heard of no bathroom lines at a concert.

My seats for the game were excellent the fans and  the staff were all top-notch. The Rangers tickets staff knew I was only in town for one game and still called me to see how my experience was and if I was coming up again and would like to see a game. The concessions were great the prices were very reasonable and lots of variety. I did take the tour before the game and just to seeing the in-depth process of how things work and what they've done with renovations to keep it top notch just blew me away! I would recommend everyone take the tour; you really do go top to bottom of the worlds most famous arena!,,,

45,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",395,4085,7998,3.0,12/15/2017,"I've been here many times over the years and the recent renovations have kept things reasonably up to date, whether brighter, easy-to-navigate concourses, or improved seats. For me, it's really MSG's history and prime New York location that are the big advantages, as it draws top-notch, A-list performers and events on top of the usual Knicks, Rangers, and Liberty games.The age of the overall arena still shows, and the concessions are typical overpriced arena fare that doesn't even begin to mimic the world-class abundance and diversity of food options that New York as a whole has to offer. Still, it's not like there are lots of alternative options in NYC proper besides the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and even then there's not a ton of space to build a ridiculously large, luxurious new venue like the ones in, say, the Dallas/Fort Worth area.All this having been said, MSG still gets the job done, and the convenience of being right on top of a major train station (even though the historic old Penn Station façade had to be razed for it) can't be beaten.",4,3,3
46,Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",850,486,9151,3.0,5/30/2017,"This review is strictly for the MSG  ""All Access Tour"" Now I've been to MSG to watch the Rangers in action and watched the transformation of the Garden on TV.  I always wanted to see the Garden behind the scenes.The tour lasted about 75 minutes. I booked the tour online  which gave you the option to choose a time. My group had about 30 people. I would recommend buying the tickets in person at the MSG store to avoid the online service fee from ticketmaster. Pro's of the tour* A Great history lesson of the birth of MSG and defining the memorable Garden moments.* A walk into the luxury suites which I can never afford. * A glimpse of the private Locker room areas.* A photographer will take a picture of you with a prop before the start of the tour, with an option to buy the picture package at the end of your tour,  which inevitably ends at the store. The price is discounted and if you're a Chase card holder you will get an additonal discount on top of that. Con's of the Tour* Extremely rushed due to the fast pace of the tour.* You need to take photos during the guided presentation since we need to move right away to the next presentation. This takes away from the experience since you literally have to move when they finish speaking.* Group size is too large - The group before me had at least 25 people .* I felt they could have shown us more areas of the operation, for example where they hold the Press conferences and where the sports writers and broadcasters reside during the games and the technical operations area where they control the scoreboard and sound effects.Overall, it gets  a C+ due to the large group size, rushed pace and the areas we went to were common areas accessible to all fans. If you're visiting from out of town it may be something you  want to do, but there are other options you may want to explore first.",29,20,30

Safety first...lol.I don't really think there was a bad place to sit as all the seats offer a great view of the action. The section we sat in was very popular with the floating blimp cam and our section even got free bangers to make some noise with. I'm not going to break down the game as it's a basketball game so I'm pretty sure you've seen one of those in your lifetime, but it really was a cool experience overall. It was even more awesome that Biz Markie was the guest DJ of the night, so he was down near the floor spinning discs in his disco light lit booth. Classic. Also, Tony Danza was there and several other celebs that they called out on camera. It's also super close to Penn Station so you can hop on the train after an event or take the train to Penn and grab a bite to eat before heading to an event.",3,3,4
52,Michael N.,"Princeton, NJ",2,112,0,5.0,10/5/2018,"How can I be objective about a building that is so ingrained in my personal history that any opinion pre or post renovation has to be informed by the magnitude of the events attended and the ticket stubs jealously guarded.I can summon all the names, from the Beach Boys to Led Zeppelin, from the Ringling Brothers Circus to the depressing circus called the Knicks. A few hundred events and concerts over the years and when thinking back I am instantly transported to 4 Pennsylvania Plaza.Sure the sightlines have been improved, the seating is more comfortable, the overall ambience is more modern, the food is now edible and the stench of ponding urine in the restrooms has largely been eradicated (almost). Strangely and sadly Billy Joel still lurks here in semi-residency and semi-retirement as a graying phantom of the Garden. I saw him in his heyday, I have no desire to see an emeritus balladeer croak out his hits one last time for the check  The only thing missing is the monkey and a tin cup.On the negative side, tickets still require a second mortgage, the ancient escalators are an enduring bad joke, the food/beverage offerings are still a rip-off and there are still too many drunk hedge fund assholes roaming the building but that's what you have to deal with when you walk into an arena now reimagined as a corporate playground. Where else on the planet can a five minute stroll deliver you from a sold-out Barbra Streisand concert to a homeless encampment deep within the bowels of the hellish netherworld known as Penn Station that is directly underneath MSG. New York is ""fun city"" for a reason.What you really pay for is the feel of the place that still rolls like an earthquake from the stomping of 18,000 maniacs and where a panoply of bold face personalities as disparate as Eddie Giacomin, Pope Francis, Dancing Larry and Ozzy Osborne are always at the top of their game. In short, Madison Square Garden is the world's most famous (and infamous) arena. For better or worse there's nothing like it and we can all agree,  Potvin still sucks!",,,

Now my situation was a little different from the norm so this review is my experience.Disclaimer:  this may not be your experience.Calling in a favor we got Guest Passes with front row seats in front of the stage. Could just about reach out and touch Billy.We had to enter through the VIP entrance on 33rd Street and were escorted into a tunnel to an elevator and up to the VIP lounge. Fabulous....Concert started a little late due to some issues in the Midtown Tunnel then some kind of shooting downstairs in Penn Station. This is OK because it gave us time to gets drinks in the lounge. Now the lounge is not for the faint of heart... 3 beers, 2 scotches- $90.  My cost for these $700 seats? $0.00, so I guess $90 is a bargain.The show starts and Billy starts with some of his older less popular songs from the seventies. That's OK because those were my years and from we're sitting all is good.Special guest singing with Billy.. Kevin Spacey. I didn't know he had such a good voice. After about an hour of non stop songs, it appears the concert is over. Billy gets up thanks us and leaves. Lights go out and everyone applauds.After a few minutes he's back and he starts singing all his A list songs. The crowd is wild but we are protected in our little cocoon area right in front of the stage, with security surrounding us. About 45 seconds before his final song our host leads us to the underground parking behind the stage so we can see Billy get into an SUV and is driven away as he waves to us. Next we are escorted out a special exit .Overall a 5 Star experience. This is Madison Squares Garden how can it be less than 5 stars, and for sure Billy Joel did not hold back for a 67 year old rock star.Second bonus for us, John McEnroe and wife Patti Smith, ala "" Baby It's You"",were standing just a couple of feet behind us. Note picture of my daughter with John in a ball cap over her left shoulder.Did you notice I said ""a couple of feet behind us"". Guess he didn't have the clout we had.

Other than it would be funny to leave a review for MSG bc like, why would you do that (after telling my mom I was writing a review for MSG, she literally said ""are you being facetious?""), I want to mention something that I thought was weird AF.When the game was over, the staff was like, as if money was about to fall from the ceiling, ushering us out like sheep. You couldn't take ONE SECOND to get your shit together without them being in your face. I felt like I was in kindergarten and on a school trip to the aquarium and we had to get back on the bus. I had quite a bit of those gallons of beer they give you (straw and all) and I wanted to potty before leaving. They weren't letting ANYONE back into the concourse (is that the word?) once you were in the escalator part. They only let me in bc I asked REALLY nicely. When I got back to where Ofer was waiting for me, he told me they harassed him and he had to say multiple times he was waiting for me and describe me. Holy shit. Is this an autocracy? Are we animals?

I almost forgot to take pictures for Yelp (when it's not food I tend to forget) but got some amazing shots inside. The game was entertaining, but I see why I don't follow basketball. I can't have two teams that are awful and enjoy being a New Yorker. The Knicks didn't disappoint and lost a close one. But at least they have a beautiful stadium to do all that losing in.

But then when he ran my card, he said he actually wanted two and ended up actually charging me for two extra drinks (at $14 a pop!!!).Fire the fuck out of this guy, please.Anyway, I haven't reviewed MSG for one simple reason - the last time I was there, Yelp didn't even exist. Yes, I've been an on-again, off-again Knicks fan my entire life, but it's hard to justify paying so much to watch so little. Which means the last time I was in this building was for the circus. No lie. It was when they had a woman break some distance record for being shot out of a cannon. And then there were newspaper rumors that she was actually a man. The 90s were simpler times.Aaaaanyway, we came here for a Big East double header. Our seats were pretty good despite our section. But then again, unlike a certain stadium in Brooklyn, MSG was actually built with audience sightlines in mind.The food in our section was pretty lackluster. I had an Italian sausage on a roll and a chicken hot dog, both of which were your standard overpriced fare.

Updated review","Went to a Knick game, some thoughts...Most attendees aren't even Knick fans. They played the Sixers and at least half the building were rooting for the away team. The cheering was tepid. There was absolutely no passion there, not even an inkling of tension against the away team. Seriously makes me want to leave NYC.The place is clean and organized. Although it feels like a mall walking around the building. Food options are not deep at all. There are probably 7 unique vendors there. Not much I'd recommend EXCEPT Carnegie Deli in the 100 section. I was suspicious how good it'd be but as it turns out... it's excellent! One of the best pastrami sandwiches in the city and also the knish is creamy with oniony flavor in there and without a doubt, excellent. It's not stacked as high as the old Carnegie Deli but it's also sort of reasonable at $15 at MSG. I actually just went to Katz's and I prefer this one. Also, if you have a Chase credit card, you can get $5 off food combos like the sandwich and knish. I don't believe there is any central museum in the place but the hallways have lots of memorabilia and stories about MSG.Extremely expensive but if you got the money or someone else's then you are probably comfortable. The sky deck is interesting and I am happy that the people paying $$$$ are so far away from the action. Let them have a happy distance from reality. I don't care to go back unless there's a show I REALLY want to see or I get free tickets.",1,2,1

Events here (especially Knicks and Rangers) tend to be pricey, but tickets for non-premium games can be found at an affordable price. For regular season college games, it is fairly easy to find reasonably priced tickets. Early season tournaments can be a great way to see top teams play without breaking the bank.It always feels special to attend a game at the Garden, even if you're watching the Knicks in this non-playoff era. The only exception relates to some features that are too corporate and removed from the enjoyment of the event. For example, during the playoffs, the Garden sets up ""Rangerstown,"" which is open for 5+ hours before the game. A great idea in theory, and it is fun to mingle with fellow fans during the pregame hours. But the actual set-up is over-sponsored, crowded, and short on fun activities. This needs to be reimagined in order to make it a fan experience instead of a transparent means of sponsor advertising.",,,
77,Donna R.,"Warren, NJ",510,476,5069,5.0,7/4/2017,"I have such fond memories of Madison Square Garden. I came here for the Enrique Iglesias and Pittbull Concert along with new Boy Band CNCO and DJ Latin Prince.First let me say what an amazing show! I forgot just how much fun Madison Square Garden truly is. The Garden took my breath away. I really don't think there's a bad seat in the house, it all depends on how much you are willing to spend to get up close and personal.There were many different price ranges for tickets.(Be very careful when purchasing tkts from a 3rd party. MSG doesn't have to honor them.)I have been coming here since I was a child. I saw my first concert here, Led Zeppelin I was a kid. The same with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus which is no longer.MSG has always had a special place in my heart.The security here is extremely tight, and for good reason. All of the staff are very professional, helpful and accommodating considering the venue wasn't open yet and there were no bathrooms at all on the lower level where the entrance is. ( we had to pickup the tickets at the will call window.) A really nice supervisor/ manager named Kevin let me use the 2nd floor bathroom with a women employee who was my escort. It was nice of her to do this because technically I wasn't suppose to use it. After explaining I had knee surgery and couldn't walk up and down a lot of stairs the manager agreed to this.Once inside the actual arena there is ticket checkers who are only too happy to either direct you, or walk you to your seats. The people are all very well trained. I was even able to get a wheelchair for my sisterinlaw after the concert. A gentleman by the name of Calvin, was so happy and very sweet while pushing my sisterinlaw to the front entrance. There is handicapped  seating all around the area. The sound at MSG was superb! The light show and special effects were spectacular. I was in the front row next to the stage. I could see and feel everything. I have also been here for a hockey game. I would definitely recommend coming here.",7,3,6
78,Lauren K.,"New York, NY",29,441,820,5.0,2/18/2018,I've been here for so many events and it's a great arena. They really stepped it up and remodeled it nicely.

Whoa baby. were  told this place was under reconstruction for over some years and lots of locals were extremely happy with how it turned out. Uptop the lower bowl between the higher bowl and lower bowl.  Feels like your right on top of the action! Able to see everything. The higher bowls even have tv screens to watch, suspended from above just in case their view gets obstructed. We were able to walk about, grab drinks and food. Socialize and not be stuck in a seat, hip to hip with individuals. Very clean and tidy. People were coming and going, definitely ""seat surfing"" but everyone was pleasant and having fun. No one got upset if you were in their stool. Camera guys came up top, but i wish the tshirt shooters would aim at the bridge a bit more ! Suspended in the air the bridge does not feel like its moving when all the fans errupt when a goal is scored! So fun to watch.  Came for a hockey game and reasonable tickets as i have head for other events it could get expensive. A stop off the Penn train station, snaps some shots and at night you can turn around see Empire State building light up. Staff were great and friendly, patient at enthused fans and those that need some ""redirection."" Gotta try it.",,,

Updated review","Went last night to see Billy Joel. Getting into the Garden was very civilized. If you are tall and Long legged beware, no legroom between rows. Painful! The worst was they the escalators were not turned on! Walking down 5 flights with people merging, was not I just want to add that I went to see a Rod Stewart concert a week ago. We decided to get a drink and eat at the Garden. To my disappointment the places we considered ordering from were all closed. Carnegie Deli was one another Charlie Palmers steak sandwich. They were both closed. We were told they only open for games basketball etc. It seems theses vendors only think people who go to sports venues will eat a $17 sandwich!We were able to have a Kobeyaki pork bun with sweet potato fries, delicious! Normally $20 with a soda. Because we had a Chase card it was $15 and were able to sub the soda for a water .",,,
84,Amber A.,"Brooklyn, NY",158,181,74,5.0,7/7/2017,"I don't remember ever going to Madison Square except for when I was a little kid which is nuts because it's an NYC landmark. Today I finally attended an event there--WWE Live. It was fantastic. Literally everything when smoothly--the crazy entrance line to get past the first set of security, the line to purchase merchandise, and then the line to get food and walk inside. Everything is so clean and orderly which is something I did not expect for some reason. The ushers and guards were also super nice. Idk how they were able to keep their composure with such a huge crowd! It's a pretty standard arena with concession stands (food, reg drinks, and liquor) bathrooms, etc. My seat for the show was close enough (row 10) costing around $100 but I'm sure the price has to do with the event itself moreso than the venue. The seats are well-kept, there's cup holders for drinks and the surround sound is amazing. So all around a good space. I had my $12 cup of beer with $7 giant hot dog and enjoyed myself. The one suggestion I have is to spread out the merch area a bit more. It was so small!",1,1,2
85,Amanda V.,"Stamford, CT",34,229,53,4.0,3/12/2018,"Easy to find, not a bad seat in the house. It's about a 20 minute walk from grand central- don't bother taking a cab there on a weekend, you'll sit in traffic forever.

Updated review","I love this venue! I usually come for the Knicks game at least once a year but hoping to catch a few other shows out at the venue. Bathrooms and seats are usually very clean. Floors, aisles and rows easy to find and navigate through and locate. Concession stands run a bit slow at times, near the entrance of each floor where you are seated.?I blame this on guest just being unaware of several places in the arena to buy food. I didn't know until I left one stand and headed to my seat.Security is great and check baggage and guest thoroughly.Con: I've visited the Barclays Center in Brooklyn a while back, and there was an event there for a boxing match. I've also been to Greensboro coliseum and the PNC arena. The entryways at those venues seemed a lot more organized than it does at Madison Square Garden. Even at Yankee stadium, they seem to have more structure leading up to the entrance. I feel like the fans kind of bum-rush the door at Madison Square Garden, squeeze in between each other, and there are no lines, no velvet ropes, or anything to provide give structure or order leading up to the metal detectors. I would say that's the biggest thing I would change. It would lessen the likelihood of any altercations.",,,
87,Jahnay M.,"Richmond, VA",38,276,304,5.0,12/24/2016,"Absolutely love MSG! Hands down the best arena in the NBA. I finally got to see my New York Knicks play at the garden and I was definitely satisfied especially since they got the win. I traveled all the way from VA to see my team play while I'm in town. MSG is conveniently located right near Penn station which makes everything so much easier when traveling from a distance. The security and other staff were courteous and helpful. Definitely enjoyed my seats in section 220 row 3 perfect view of the court and adjacent to the team bench. The seats were comfortable, they had game screens on the first rows, they tossed free shirts if you were lucky enough to catch one, and MSG was clean! All in all I would most definitely come back to the garden again soon. Also who doesn't love being in the heart of NYC!?",1,1,1

This guy has been everywhere and knows many languages lol. Super funny and knowledgeable guy, kept us very entertained the whole time, and letting us know the history of MSG.The new design and seating is awesome, and those floating seats up top are crazy! lol. The cool part of the tour is seeing inside the locker rooms (no you can't walk inside, just get to look from the door) and you can't see the Rangers logo on the floor, they hide it because they think it is bad luck if others see it lol those darn sport superstitions. You also get to go on the floor as well. My favorite part was seeing a memory around the arena for everyday of the year. Great tour, and thanks again Alex.",4,3,4

MSG sure has changed a lot and the last time I was here was back in February 2010 for John Mayer concert. I also came to watch the circus and a Knicks game when I was a kid.I didn't know that renovations took place at MSG until I saw that it was mentioned in some Yelp reviews. The seats are comfy and the female restrooms are pretty clean. The food prices are expensive tho so it's probably best to eat before or after the event. There's also security check when entering MSG. I also noticed that the escalators are turned off when leaving the events too and I don't know why.Overall, pretty good experience and looking forward to attending more events at MSG.",2,,1
91,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,5.0,5/30/2017,"I've been here a couple of times for various events and my boyfriend has been here for quite a few, but this review is for a Billy Joel concert. We came here for his birthday and had probably the best concert experiences of our lives.Note: we had incredible floor seats. Experiences in other seats my vary.The concert had a listed start time of 8:00pm, though we read that he didn't come on til about 8:20pm. We tried to get there with enough time to grab beers and be in our seats before the first song started. The security line was longer than we expected, with concertgoers stretched far back into that corridor. I think it's partially do to the airport-style security they have going on and partially do to the popularity of Billy Joel. He does one show each month at MSG and sells out every. single. time.There was a really long line for the stand that sold hard liquor, but we were able to get beers and an unnecessary snack with basically no wait at all.It was one of those experiences where we got onto the floor and were walking closer and close to the front as ushers continued to tell us to go closer to the stage. It was really a great feeling. You can see my picture for the view from section A, row 5, pretty close to the center. These tickets were a gift and when they were being bought for us we said we'd be happy with absolutely any seats in the 100s, or basically anywhere. The floor seats were a complete surprise. We knew how much they retailed for on StubHub and thought it might've been a waste of money, but boy did that feeling change when we got to the seats.Almost every single person in the section save 3 women in high heels in front of us (conveniently) was standing up and singing every word to every song. I realize that this is partly because the seats aren't on an incline like those in the rest of the stadium, but regardless it added to the energy which, in turn, added to the experience.Billy Joel himself was unbelievable. You'd never think he was a 60-something year-old guy in the business for 4 decades. He was up there twirling his microphone, asking for crowd input to decide which song to play at various junctures, belting out Piano Man on a harmonica wrapped around his neck with his hands still on the piano.I now feel an emotional connection to him in a way that I don't with any other artist. I never would've described him as one of my favorite artists or bands though I always knew I loved him, but this was still, hands down, the best concert experience of my life. If you have the opportunity to spend someone else's money on concert tickets, I can't tell you how great it was being in section A row 5. If not, anything between 107-116 (moving clockwise) is your next best bet. Even if you end up in the upper deck behind the stage, I'd still highly recommend this to anyone.",1,1,1
92,Katie W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,83,88,5.0,1/19/2018,"A fantastic venue for a concert. I recently attended The Killers show, opting for the VIP package. I was so impressed at how organized and together the experience was. Most venues do this kind of thing on the fly, which has ended in many less than savory experiences. However, at MSG, we were able to wait for check in time in a covered area in front of the building, which was great because it was absolutely pouring that day. And then everyone walked single file into the arena to wait to be allowed into the venue. I thought that was very nice because some fans had been waiting all day for this, so they got the spot they deserved. The employees were so excited and enthusiastic, something I've never really seen before. They all seemed like they genuinely loved their jobs, and it really made a difference.",,,
93,Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4596,455,419,1.0,8/9/2016,"I don't think I have come across more rude and nasty staff in my life. Especially the older lady with the blonde hair who seemed to be a supervisor. We came all the way from San Diego for a concert and had meet and greet tickets and sound check, for which we had paid a small fortune. The organizers of the show told us to come to the checkin desk to get the tickets. It was behind the door. So we had to BEG the lady to let us in. The organizers told us the main person who organized the event had our tickets and they would give it to us after sound check at the meet and greet. They explained this to the lady. We were then seated, four hours before sound check in the front. Sound check however was in a different room. They took all the people who paid for regular tickets and put them in the front for sound check. They took the people who had paid for  expensive meet and greets and dumped us at the back like it was a favor even letting us in. For our party, who had special tickets that were going to be given to us at the meet and greet the  lady didn't want to even let us in. I had to fight with her and eventually we joined another meet and greet group and ""snuck"" in even though I had paid more than anyone else for my tickets at a charity auction. We got our front row tickets eventually at the meet and greet. The first two rows were only supposed to have people there who paid for those tickets. And yet during the show security let drunk people in from the back to jump in front of us, block our view, behave terribly and ruin the show for us.",9,3,6
94,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2296,4007,4.0,4/3/2017,"""We're going to see TCU play tonight at the garden.""  My fellow Texan friend texted me on a late Tuesday morning.The next thing I know I'm going through security to buy tickets. My friend, who was already drunk by 4pm, made me listen as he narrated the subjects in the photographs adorning the tall lobby columns - ""Mohammed Ali"" ""Marilyn Monroe - happy birthday Mr. President.that happened here at Madison Square garden!""  He said with Santa Clause eyes, a joker smile and a slur.Online I found nose bleed seats for $6.  At the box office they were $25 but my friend was paying.   First stop beer was a shocker. $12.50 for imports.  $10 for a pizza. $7 for candy.Oh they stick it to you.We found our seats and then worked our way down closer without any problems.We befriended a few people.  One guy behind us was smart and brought in his own gin.  Not sure he got that past security tho. The second shock was the unclarity that we were paying for two games.  The first game was at 7pm, but TCU didn't start until 10pm.It was about this time I decided I needed a cigarette.  Strike three - no ins and outs whatsoever.  I steamed for a while and waited until 9 and decided at the very least if I couldn't beg my way in I'd just buy a $5 online ticket.   Who traps one inside a venue for 5 hours?  Plus this was not mentioned on the ticket or at purchase, or any signage inside.   You're trapped.I'm a bit of a claustrophobe so after 3 hours of exile I pulled the rip cord.  I smoked a cigarette and grabbed a, bad, slice nearby. When I returned around 9:45 in time for the TCU game the security line was ridiculously long.  I'll never attend a show here without arriving early or an empty bladder. I made it back in with approval from the floor manager who acted rhinosehraus tough but agreed to a one time exception. Sometimes it helps to play dumb.A break down of tips1. No in and outs 2. BYOB but be stealthy 3.  Arrive early 4. Check for cheap tickets online, try moving down for a better view if it's feasible.5.  Make at least 2 new friends while there.6.  Avoid eating in that area, it's expensive and bad.",4,5,4

Security let people stand up anywhere they wanted. Maybe it's because I wasn't front row and they're slack with the rows on the back. Our seats weren't cheap but surely people that paid little money were standing enjoying the showing directly in front of us. Next time like always, if I can't get a seat on the first 4 rows, I ain't going. The concert was good, the sound system conked our two or three times.

When the Knicks were good, you did not want to be an opposing team when you came to the Garden. It was loud, and almost felt like the Sixth Man on the floor. The Garden floor would literally come up and the building would shake with tremors because of all the people there. Some of the best moments from Knicks history have come here.And its not just a venue for sports, Billy Joel plays a concert here regularly and has so for several years (and will continue to do so). They just retired his number for how many concerts he's performed here. My mother even saw him perform here when she was younger! They also host the Big Apple circus and Z-100's Jingle Ball. They hold just about everything here.Just below the Garden is New York's Penn Station. Unfortunately this is not the Penn Station previous generations knew. It is shady and really run down. There's discussion of moving it across the street, but we'll see. One writer once wrote about it, ""Through [Pennsylvania Station] one entered the city like a god... One scuttles in now like a rat.""

I haven't been here for over 20 years and can see its been updated.  I came for a Knicks vs. Sixers game and thought the garden did a great job . The new jumbotron was impressive.  Even if you didn't have a great seat,  you can see the most important views of the game live and with replays! The scoreboard is continually updated and you aware of the players stats and foul situation.  Throughout the game, those responsible for sound and lighting are always trying to keep the fans hyped.  During timeouts the Knick City Kids dancing troupe may come out to entertain the crowd.  They were really talented.  The Knick dancers come out for half time and also during timeouts to shoot t-shirts to the fans. They even do fan contests on the floor during timeouts and social media giveaways through out the game. The ushers were friendly and they were helpful directing people to their seats.  Walking around the concourse,  pictured historic events are displayed throughout.  One should take a moment to appreciate it.  There were so many events I didn't know occurred at MSG. The food options are plentiful, albeit expensive.  That's the going rate at most venues,  so not a big deal. I noted Japanese, burgers  deli, sandwiches, BBQ,  salads, &  ice cream /dessert.  There is beer served at the concourse but not sold at the seats.  I did try David Chang's chicken sandwich fast food called Fuku,  but was disappointed.  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and didn't care for the taste.  It wasn't too dry but the spice mixture and batter was not my cup of tea.  The fries I have to say were good.  It's like fries at five guys but with shrimp chip flavoring.  It was an interesting combo. The cookies sold there are awesome.  If you like cookies, get them.  They are unfortunately $3.75 a cookie though. Although the Knicks are horrible and Sixers equally as bad,  I did enjoy the game.  I was surprised how packed the garden was and how expensive the tickets were.   The last three minutes of the game was the most exciting and I was able to feel the energy of the crowd. The game was sealed with a last second shot by Carmelo Anthony!The garden is also very covenient to get to.  It's connected to Penn Station so you can watch a game, get boozed and take the train home without going outside. It was truly entertaining to come to a game here . I can see that any other event would be just as entertaining.  Ticket prices is what it is in nyc.  You will pay up the hilt to watch a game.  More economical prices are in found on the elevated seats,  but the jumbotron screen makes it easy to see everything.",13,11,11

But then you walk through the tunnel and there she is - The Garden!  A beautifully constructed (and renovated) circular structure with all the making for a classic basketball arena.**  And it doesn't stop there - The National Anthem starts up and the court is transformed into an American flag - complete with stars and stripes.  It's kindof beautiful.  And then the game starts and a time out is called and here come the Knicks City Dancers.  These gals are not just perky and pretty - they are uber talented and even though their performances only last a few minutes it's like going to a legit show.  The lights come down; a sultry sounding announcer comes over the speakers and says ""here are your Knicks... City... Dancers.""   Sometimes it's the best part of the game. Unlessss the Knicks are playing well.  And then the already electric Garden becomes even more so.  The lights, the soundtrack, the fans cheering and chanting ""de-fense!"" all add to the energy.  The Garden really is a great place to go to a game, there's a reason it's called The World's Greatest Arena, right?  Let's just hope the Knicks can pull themselves together enough to at least get to 500 next season.**32-50! Really guys!?  **Thank goodness they got rid of those terrible teal and purpleish upholstered seats!",5,3,3

On my last occasion there was a snafu where the tickets were transferred to me and I arrived to MSG with urgent text messages/phone calls from my cousin saying the tickets were sold because she forgot they were up for a charity auction. Fortunately, MSG has great customer service for season subscribers and they gave me a free upgraded ticket to 3rd row center court (hanging with Mets players, comedian Robert Klein and seeing Walt Clyde Frazier's suit up close was a real thrill!) and Delta Sky360 club access - whoa momma, it was pretty awesome.Delta Sky360 club is a lounge where subscribers have their own bars and food options without having to pay (Im sure they PAY, but not at the counters). All for the taking I saw massive cold shrimp cocktail, fresh sushi, prime rib, lobster rolls, 16 handles froyo, coffee bar, popcorn boxes and cotton candy - it seems like pretty much any items you can purchase from the various vendors are available here.I usually wouldn't eat the pre-made sushi at the MSG vendors, but here I have to say the quality was excellent. The shrimp cocktail had colossal sized shrimps and were super fresh. The froyo was grainy unfortunately, but I got it towards the end of the half. Alcoholic drinks were the only items that need to be bought.Since I was comped, I can't tell you if the experience is a good value. Most of the food was only available prior to game start and halftime which makes for long lines at the half, but they move fast since no payments need to be made. The lounge also was crowded - lots of high rollers in our fair city!I know there is another exclusive club called the 1879 CLUB presented by J.P. Morgan that I have yet to see - I guess it is reserved for Randolph and Mortimer Duke brother types! All jokes aside, MSG did right by my cousin and by me - they turned an awkward situation into a positive!",10,5,8
107,Rima F.,"New York, NY",179,391,12,4.0,2/22/2017,"MSG is such a huge improvement over the old place! It's clean, comfortable, the seats are great, and the staff are very helpful. Easy to navigate.We went for the Harlem Globetrotters show and were very disappointed to find that the skill is gone- its only non-stop sugar-coated slapstick that most appeals to small children. It got pretty tiring, so we left before the end of the show.",1,2,3
108,Danny L.,"San Jose, CA",259,363,746,5.0,5/2/2016,"It's always been a dream of mine to see a basketball game here at Madison Square Garden ever since I was a kid. I finally had the opportunity to see the New York Knicks pay against my favorite team which is the Golden State Warriors. I was beyond thrilled to have the chance to travel to NYC, let alone step foot within Madison Square Garden.If you guys know basketball well enough like me then you should know MSG has history. For example: Kobe, Melo, MJ, Lebron, & Curry all dropped 50+ games here and many other legends. Oh yeah, you also can't forget about the history of hockey too.Coming from a guy who's from the Bay Area, god damn the fans here are so quiet.. I don't see any cheer or crazy excitement from the Knicks fans here. I'm so used to Oracle (GSW) and we get down, forreals.One of the things I observed was that the stuff is very organized. I love love love their IPA beer selections. Whether you're a true New Yorker, or a visitor fro out of town, the Garden is a premiere venue and one that cannot be missed.",3,1,2
109,Inga W.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",67,18,15,1.0,12/6/2017,"Waiting to get in to see Chris Rock and the line to get in is insane! The people here to see the Knicks are gliding though where the rest of us are subjected to a horrendous human traffic jam worse than in JFK! WHY ARE WE STUCK?! MSG YOU ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT! How come you couldn't come up with a decent, proper way to process people in a normal pace?! I'm absolutely disgusted and horrified at this experience and would never be back here again. I attend many shows, games and concerts and never have I ever been subjected to such disgrace! I've been waiting outside for over 30 minutes! What is wrong with your management?! Shame on you!",,,

The night before we suffered an overzealous employee who took his role way too seriously. Michael H. - You're a boss. Dancing in the aisle but keeping the place clear and safe.

111,Meg T.,"Charleston, SC",234,275,326,5.0,8/21/2016,"My husband and I went to Billy Joel's 31st monthly MSG concerts in July.  For those who might not know, Billy Joel will be doing one concert a month at the Garden for the foreseeable future until they stop selling out.We have been to a few basketball and hockey games as well as concerts before, and my favorite thing about the Garden is that there is not a bad seat in the house.  It's on the smaller size when it comes to venues, and I love that it's right in the middle of the city.  Specifically talking about my experience seeing Billy Joel, the concert was GREAT.  He performed for almost two and a half hours, and that included a surprise appearance by Tony Bennett (for his 90th birthday to sing New York State of Mind) and a 6-song encore.  He played so many popular songs as well as two of our lesser-known favorites: Vienna and Summer, Highland Falls.  Billy Joel always puts on a fantastic concert, and I really hope he continues these concerts far into the future!",,,1
112,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1726,624,4345,5.0,1/22/2017,"Wow this place got a major upgrade from the last time I came! The floors, the food and drink stands , the bathrooms are new and kept clean! Very impressed.You can't get a bad seat in the place! Some of the most magical moments in concerts I've seen were all at MSG!!! My only complaint is that the seats are super tight! Very clean but there is NO LEG ROOM. And no place to hang your drink. My tip for people is to not bring a lot of stuff or bulky stuff( coat/ pocketbook) cuz there is NO space. Love that PENN station is right underneath- jersey folks can take the train in on NJ Amtrak and LI folks can take LIRR in. Food and drink is expensive - as it is in any stadium etc. my Stella beer was 12 bucks. Just and FYI",3,2,2
113,Tomomi S.,"Torrance, CA",42,141,41,5.0,4/19/2017,"This review is for both VIP access tour and the Rangers game at MSG. I'm a crazy Rangers fan living in LA amongst many Kings fans. The moment I knew I'm going to NY, my first trip in 20 years, I got the game tickets through Stubhub. Went to the last game of the regular season. I don't know the pre-renovation MSG but the current MSG puts Staples Center and Honda Center to shame. Our seats were section 227, row 1. Row 1 seats are slightly wider, has cup holders on the arm rests and flat screen TV. The seats are cushy, so they were a lot more comfortable than Staples Center seats. The view of the ice was amazing. However, since I'm short and my son is 9 years old, the flat screen TV and the plexiglass edge obscured our view. We had to sit at the edge of our seats to get a clear view. Also, the flatscreen TVs are fixed, so you got a TV glow in your face during hockey game, so it's really annoying. You do have the option to turn it off though, so we turned it off. (if you bring a USB cable, you can charge your phone though - but TV needs to be powered on) I would say that row 1 seats were much better than Staples Center's premium level seats. Much better view & more comfortable seats. The Rangers fans were all nice people. It was so nice for me to finally be able to enjoy Rangers game on their home turf. If you have a Chase card, they do have separate entrance to the venue. Just show your tickets and your Chase card, then  you can avoid the massive line. You will have to go through security and MSG does not have a coat check. Bring minimal things and no big bags. I knew better than to eat expensive, mediocre concession food at hockey games. So we went to NY Pizza Suprema across the street for dinner before the game. Lots of Rangers fans there, so I felt right at home. Two days later, I went back to MSG for VIP All Access Tour. My main purpose of this tour was so I can see the locker rooms. You can get a better deal through Groupon. If you purchase through MSG's website, you are forced to buy the tickets through Ticketmaster. Therefore, you get charged their b.s. service fee on top of the actual tour tickets. Buy the Groupon tickets. Bring the print out to MSG store. They will then give you a voucher for the next available tour that day (which runs pretty much every 15 min) The tour takes you through 100 level of the arena first. The guide will talk about the many memorabilia's on the walls. Then you get to see the suites, special areas that only Delta season ticket holders can access to and the locker rooms for both Knicks and Rangers. You will not be able to see the locker rooms on game day, so if that's high on the priority list, make sure to check the dates. I made sure it wasn't game day but still wasn't 100% sure since regular season just ended and we entered the playoffs time. But by the time we went on the tour, Rangers were already headed out to Montreal for game 1, so we got to see the locker rooms. (Woot woot!)You can't enter the locker rooms because it will be roped off, but you can still look inside, take pictures and smell the room (lol). The logo is covered up because hockey players are superstitious. My son and husband are hockey fans, although not Rangers. (Terrible, I know) I'm not into basketball, boxing or popular music. I can care less who performed at the venue in the past. But the tour was still very interesting and informative. I would say that if you are a sports fan, you'll definitely enjoy walking through MSG. I wouldn't recommend it for kids younger than 7 though.",,,
114,Sue T.,"Farmingdale, NJ",73,451,1083,4.0,6/21/2016,"Went to see The Cure the other night at MSG.  It's been quite a few years since I've attended a show in a big arena like this.  It's a great venue for a concert & pretty easily accessible via train.  The sound was fantastic considering the size of the place & my seats were up on the side of the stage.  Visibility was great.  My only complaint would be the TV monitors. Once the band got to playing their hits, of course, the crowd all stood up.  That's ok for a little bit but after awhile I need to sit.  The clarity of the monitor directly in front of me was very poor.  The one to the right of the stage seemed better, but I was too far away & once the crowd was up, there wasn't a chance I could see it.  Overall a great place but update your tv monitors.",1,,
115,Yelp H.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,0,5.0,6/6/2018,"This is definitely the best venue. The shows are always on point and you will never be disappointed by the service. The manager and workers care about the customers. There are many shops and souvenir places. The food is high priced, but quality. The people who go there are very nice. It is clean and well maintained. This place is totally one of the best places to see a show, especially sports game. They also have a behind the scenes experience which is recommended. You can go backstage, take pictures, and walk around the whole stadium with a tour guide. This place is amazing!",,,
116,Chris P.,"Chester, VA",98,347,288,5.0,9/4/2017,"This venue is one of the best arenas on the face of the earth. The staff was friendly, inviting and just plain fun to be around.

117,Jarrod T.,"Drums, PA",7,116,71,4.0,9/12/2017,"My first time here was the Depeche Mode concert on 9/9/17. Was pretty impressed with the place. Very friendly and helpful staff, easy to get in and out of, clean facility, convenient vendors, good seating.  Only negatives are the concession prices (seriously...$6 for a bottle of water... $13.25 for a beer?!  One beer?!...) and no cup holders on the seats.",1,,

119,Howie Z.,"New York, NY",479,163,328,5.0,9/22/2017,This place is conveniently located above Penn Station for NJTransit and Amtrak. Easy access to every game and event hosted here.,,,
120,Dave M.,"Bellefonte, PA",78,11,0,3.0,8/24/2018,"eh, this place is alright, the food and beverages, etc. are WAY overpriced. went here 5 times, they put on pretty good shows just expensive.",,,
121,Gabe R.,"Chalmette, LA",105,751,345,4.0,8/12/2017,"So I have never seen an event here although watching a world class fight and attending a Knick game are both on my sports bucket lists.  This review is based on the MSG Tour itself, which honestly isn't really needed if you attend an event.We took the tour and it's like 26.00 each and is 90 minutes long.  It's also an option in some of those Citipass like deals but not Citipass itself.  Like all tours having a good guide is really important and ours was pretty good.  We started off in a hallway that looked straight out of 1970.  I was expecting Bill Brady and Walt Frazier to come out in short shorts or leisure suits.  Luckily that little section of hallway was just there to show their past.  MSG has had a massive renovation making it fresh and new.  The guide then takes you through the main corridor where one when get their burger fix or beer before taking their seat.  In this corridor there is a 365 historical markers going in a complete circle going around the inside of the building.  Each marker represents a day of the year and event that happened inside MSG on that day.  Everything from Ali to WrestleMania to Rolling Stone playing to Michael Jordan dropping 55 on the Knicks.  There are also 10 big event markers inside giving a lot more details.  Things like Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday to JFK(This is the 4th MSG and this event was at one of the other MSG locations), Willis Reed's comeback giving the Knicks their only NBA Championship, WrestleMania I, Alli vs Frazier and others.  So much history.The tour also takes you to the suites area and basically a super suites area where big time CEO's only stay.  You get to go look at the locker rooms as well and a discount in the gift shop.  It's definitely a cool thing to check out if you are a sports fan.",1,,
122,Mitzi P.,"Fraser, MI",3,160,222,5.0,11/6/2017,I have been here for a concert and hockey games. I think this is an awesome arena. Getting out after a game is easy too especially compared to getting out of Detroit arenas.,,,

In comparison, Barclays is much nicer looking with a better concession area, but it does not have the history that MSG has. The energy of the crowd is the best in the world. Also, the seats are very comfortable and the view is good even from the higher sections.",1,,1

Security was not a hassle like the Prudential Center. They were organized and experienced. Very professional.My daughter won the tickets. We had Club seats, center ice. What a view! The seats are comfortable, although not much leg room. We didn't have anyone behind us which was great. The bathroom was right at the bottom of the stairs in our section. How convenient!! The food court is huge with lots of choices. Some things like candy, pretzel, etc. are not too expensive. We didn't get anything. I'm not sure how large portions would be of regular food. I would be interested to see the value for the price. They have popular names like Carnegie Deli, Hill Country Kitchen and more. The alcohol is pricey. Crowds were nice, ushers were keeping an eye on things. All employees directing traffic were very friendly and considerate. Very easy entrance and exit to your seats and into and out of the arena. The entrance is decorated for the holidays. They have a huge shop to purchase Rangers gear. Everything else was typical of a Rangers game, great music, fun games and prizes, and a win!!I'm already planning my next visit!!",4,1,5

129,Jamila C.,"Somerville, NJ",187,249,1148,4.0,11/27/2016,"Madison Square Garden has the feel of a larger stadium, but I used to always say every seat in MSG is a good seat. I've been there for basketball games and have seen several concerts and other shows there. I've sat in various sections; however it definitely pays to get the floor seating just in front of the stage for concerts. I was surprised, however, to see that the floor seats were just folding chairs with padded seats. The staff were very helpful and greeted us every time we passed by.The Chase Bridge is a newer addition, technically up in the nosebleed section, but I actually enjoyed sitting there during a basketball game. There isn't anything or anyone blocking your view of the game and the glass barrier in front of the seats is so clear it's as if it isn't there at all. The bar stools were nice, but they're screwed to the floor so you can't pull it closer to the table. That was annoying. I also noticed that the people sitting on the bridge were more interested in socializing than watching the game -also annoying. Also, don't think you're getting a t-shirt shot from those cannon guns. The Chase Bridge section is just too high up. Advantages include the close by concession stands and the bridge has a lounge-like feel, less crowded.On my last visit, the elevators did not work at the end of the concert. People were flooding the stairway and walking down the escalator stairs. It dawned on me afterwards that there had to be an elevator.Still a nice venue to enjoy a show or game.",3,,2

133,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,5.0,10/21/2015,I am a Rangers season ticket holder on the suites infront of the blue line. My season tickets to cost a pretty penny but The rangers are my fav team and the staff at MSG is exceptional. I have traveled to many different sporting events all over the country. I have been to the staple center in LA I have been to the Bridgestone Arena in TN I have seen games at more than 13 different locations. I feel that I am spoiled because Madison Square Garden in my opinion is the worlds greatest arena. The tickets are expensive here but it is New York and everything is more expensive here. MSG is located on 33rd in between 7th and 8th. The arena is located on top of Penn station. MSG has done a great job with remodeling the garden it looks much more sleeker them the old design. They added the chase The seating arrangements have been altered to capture the best possible view of any sporting event or concert in the venue. For the Ranger games the lighting system has been upgraded. The sound system is pretty good for an arena. You do have to remember that MSG is a really big arena not like some of the other arenas across the country that doesn't have the seating capacity that Madison Square Garden has. Monday through Friday most people show up to the games after work. 70% of the people show up to these games just as the first period Starts if not 20 mins after the game started. Mostly on weekdays it's a businessman in full suits or individuals with their dress shirts and ties still on. On the weekends you see more families in the arena. The people that come to these games interest me because A CEO of a company could be sitting right next to a crazy fan routing on his team. It's really interesting to people watch in this venue. I can't remember a game that I haven't been to where they haven't shown some sort of a celebrity on the Jumbotron. They love the Jumbotron at MSG. Heck I've even made the Jumbotron and I didn't even smileThe staff here is always top notch I have gotten security escorts in my seat before. If you have any questions they're always knowledgeable and they will help you with any situation that you acquire about. There is not a lot of food options in the vicinity of MSG. There is a shake shack inside Penn station. As far as the food options go at Madison Square Garden. You do have a couple options. I'm not going to list all the different food options but every time I do come here if I haven't eaten already I go to daily burger. Located on the main concourse 100 sections. For $10 you can get a burger that is actually pretty good for Arena food. They do have local beers on tap here. If you're a fan of the Brooklyn brewery they have these beers on tap. Overall the venue is a very popular destination. People come all over to see MSG. The history of this building is something to be marveled. If you haven't been to MSG I recommend you go. If your a regular at rangers games you can say hi to me if you see me lol,6,3,6
134,Samantha G.,"Baltimore, MD",102,369,85,3.0,1/1/2017,"Madison Square Garden is a pretty epic concert experience. I'm writing this review to note for others, who may not have been in some time, of some changes I noticed since the last time I attended. 1.) They now have metal detectors. Of course, this is probably a good thing, but it slows down the entrance to the venue a lot. Just like at an airport, you now have to put your purse around it, while they search it, and take out your phone, keys, etc. You have to unzip your coat and if you're wearing a hat, must remove it. I am happy to participate in safety, but the security guard confiscated two little candies that I had. What?! It's not like I'm bringing in a meal or a beverage. Just a few candies at the bottom of my purse...they were labeled and wrapped (so not suspicious at al...) I just couldn't believe it. So, if you have mints or candy in your purse, better leave it at home or it will get thrown away. 2.) The seats are comfortable but not all of them have cup holders. If you get one without cup holders, it's quite annoying because you're worried about someone spilling your drink the whole time...and why are you worried about this....because...3.) When they sell you a bottle of water, the remove the cap and keep it! I guess they are worried you will throw it or something, but it is so silly. I bought three bottles of water for me and my husband, intended to last the whole show, and then someone came and knocked them over (no tops, no cupholders) within minutes... 4.) There are only screens in some places. This makes it great to see close ups if you're far away and want a close look at what's happening on stage...but they are not in all areas. In fact, some areas that are closer have screens than ones that are further. For example, when sitting in the 200s, I had screens and no cupholders, but in the 100s, cupholders and no screens (behind the stage-- a place where screens would be much appreciated!) The escalators seem never to be on at the end of the night, so you're just essentially walking stairs all the way down. On the plus side, I've always experienced friendly staff and the bathrooms are fairly nice. Food and drink is ridiculously priced, of course.",1,,
135,Javier M.,"Brick, NJ",47,56,122,4.0,9/14/2017,Went there to watch Depeche Mode and it was a great setting to listen to a great band.The sound quality was really good and Dave Gahan put on a great show on the stage.The lines to get in and out were reasonable.The only thing that could be improved is the merchandise section since I can't see why it takes so long to buy the merchandise.All in all still a great concert venue.,,,
136,J D N.,"Rockland County, NY",3,31,17,1.0,9/19/2017,Just took my family to the pre-season Ranger vs Islander game and made the MISTAKE of ordering the $16 pastrami sandwich off the menu in the seats. I am talking $16 for the absolute worst sandwich I have ever experienced @ any sporting venue in the Tri-state area! It was a club roll with one piece of meat and some sort of cheese. I wouldn't feed this stuff to my enemy's dog! MSG should be ashamed of serving this crap. I will never order food inside MSG again. WAKE UP MSG...YOUR FOOD VENDING IS ABYSMAL!,,,

The seats were comfortable and I can't see there being a bad seat in the house. One drawback is that when we were leaving (it was late) they ushered everyone into stairwells that seem much better suited for emergencies. Essentially, they have you come in the standard way and then make you exit through the backdoor. The food vendors were solid - they had different varieties of food and the prices were in line with what I'd expect.",,,

142,Jeremy K.,"Oakland, CA",199,215,100,5.0,7/16/2017,"Where do I start.  There is a reason why this Arena is coined as ""The World's Most Famous Arena. "" Just walk around the inside of the building on the 100 level, and they have pictures representing 366 days, yes they include Leap Day. The list ranged from Basketball, Boxing, Hockey, Music, Politics and Wrestling.  They were moments from the building's history such as March 8, 1971 for Ali-Frazier I, March 31, 1985 for Wrestlemania I and numerous other events. Then you walk into the arena, and see that famous ceiling, the floor and all the banners from the Rangers, Knicks, Liberty and Billy Joel. The ambience is amazing, and the guest services people are very nice. As for the food. I did not have anything to eat, but I did see that there was a Carnegie Deli stand that served their famous corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, which is cool; because their restaurant on 7th Ave. closed on December 31, 2016. I am so glad that I went there. I could care less that the building is 49 years old, it is awesome.",,,

Our seats were up high - section 418, row 4, seats 17/18 (for those who care..).  I honestly thought when purchasing these seats that they were going to be so high the players would look like ants. I was wrong. They looked like wasps. Lol... we're coming back in March for Luke Bryan... can't WAIT!",,,

147,Jessica R.,"Freeport, NY",72,1,0,1.0,12/7/2017,Madison square garden was a great place for an event. But last night I went to see Chris Rock tour and it was very disorganized. They ran out of cell phone pouches and forced all the people to check in their cell phone at security. We waited on line for also an hour and a half to get in and missed half of the show. It was also Chris rock producers fault. The only accommodation was tickets to the Christmas spectacular which I've seen and wasn't interested in. So that was the only option. The worst part was at the end of the night to pick up the phone and it was so unorganized. Took forever for them to locate our phone.,1,,

149,Jeannette L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1436,781,2455,5.0,8/25/2015,"LEXUS MADISON SUITES REVIEWI've been very fortunate to have had the opportunity to see a few concerts and sports games from the Lexus Madison Suites at MSG. The company where my boyfriend works has a suite and will hold a lottery for employees to win tickets for certain events. So I've been his ""plus one"" a few times over the years. MSG is right next to New York Penn Station. You enter from 7th Ave or, if you coming from Penn Station to get to Manhattan, take a few escalators and navigate your way to the main entrance. Either way, you'll go through security at the Tower South and Tower North entrances, which are to the sides before you reach the main entrance. You line up outside of the entrances, where security will check your bag and search you. It goes pretty quickly and security has always been very friendly. Then you take an escalator up where staff will direct you to the elevators. There is an elevator attendant who will get you to where you need to go, just let them know where your seats are. The suites are on 9. The concession stands are on 6 (just an FYI in case you don't want to order in the suites). Once you are let out of the elevator on 9, you'll see an entrance to the hallway of suites. There's always staff in the hallway who can help you find your suite. The suites are very chic and sleek from what I've seen. You have a place to hang your coat; the suite has a private bathroom that's spacious, clean, and has lights that dim when a show or game is about to start or return from break; couches and lounging areas in the back; buffet/credenza (I don't remember which is which) tables on the sides of the suite for food and drinks; high top table chairs and then seats up front where you can get a great view of the sports event or concert. All the seating options are comfortable in the suites. I like the seats up front and the high top table chairs because I like to be closer to the acts. If you are in the seats up front, there are also screens closer to your knees where you can see what's being projected on the giant screens down below (this is nice for sporting games when replays are shown of either a great play or fight on the ice). Music-wise, obviously MSG is great for big shows and arena-scale performances, so sound quality doesn't have to be perfect as long as the music is loud and there's a lot of action on stage. I've seen Ozzy, Judas Priest, Tom Petty, Mötley Crüe, Duran Duran, Blondie, Morrissey, and Muse here and I was perfectly content with the sound. However, I have heard people complain about acoustics, but for me I think it's fine. For sports events, it's worth leaving the level and walking around the 6th floor by the concession stands and vendors. It just seems right and like you'd be remiss not to, but watching sporting events in the suites is pretty cool. Here's a tip for anyone seeing his/her first hockey game at MSG - wear layers because it gets cold!Overall, being in the Lexus Madison Suites is a premium experience. I dig it a lot!",2,1,3
150,Frank B.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",4555,917,10907,5.0,6/30/2016,"The Garden, the place I've always desired to witness a show and experience the legendary Mecca of all arenas. Well I made it, F@@K YA! Was fortunate enough to be able to attend The Cure recently on these hallowed grounds and had the time of my life.Icons that entertained at THE GARDEN are endless, but are not limited to Elvis , Sinatra , Led Zeppelin, Ali & Frazier and Hulk Hogan have all show cased there talents. NY rockers KISS knew they officially made when they played the Garden for the first time on Feb 18th 1977. Upon entering I felt things were safe, well organized. Food & beverage was plentiful and lots of options. Seating was very spacious and seats were well padded for the buns. Overall you find the Garden is a 1st class venue for all to enjoy.Can't wait to go back.",65,37,72
151,Zaneta O.,"Westbury, NY",955,774,3129,4.0,6/28/2015,"Last Saturday was one of my many visits to Madison Square Garden. I won tickets to see Morrissey and Blondie courtesy of Jukely. The searches are still the same, bag check then metal detectors. The guard thought I had something near my thigh because he claimed the detector was going off. The pants I was wearing didn't even have pockets but whatever he let me through anyway.They herd the general admission ticket holders like cattle and when there's a massive amount of people coming through there is less order to their process. Luckily I was not general admission so out entry was quick after we got our tickets from will call. The seats are much more comfortable than I remembered or may be it was just because my last concert was at Nikon Theater where they aren't very comfy but whatever, not even sure why we have seats because everyone stands anyway inconsiderately obstructing the vision of the person behind them.A tall Heineken on tap is $11 and a water is $5.25 but they won't let you keep the bottle, they make you pour it in a cup. Don't even get me started on the mixed drink prices, but hey this should be no surprise to anyone. For that price they could be a bit colder if you ask me.As for the performances themselves... Blondie was okay. For a 69 year old woman she rocked it and I love her but I must admit some parts of the performance were a little rough. For example the intro to Rapture was as if she was improvising a bit because she couldn't carry the note. She was also wearing gigantic platforms so she wasn't able to dance as much. It was cool when she brought a bunch of people on stage for The Tide is High. Shortly after she was waving around a rainbow flag and made several mentions about the pride parade and expressed her happiness about the same sex marriage law. They also did ""Call Me"", ""One Way or Another"", and ""Hanging on the Telephone"".Morrissey was great but it kind of threw me off when he sang a bunch of songs in Spanish. It's kind of odd to hear a British man singing in Spanish but he did a good job nonetheless. I honestly don't follow him that closely so it was most unexpected. I also can't really give you much of a setlist for his performance for the same reason. His voice is pretty unique but after a while everything starts to sound the same because it's really his voice carrying most of the song. The sound was great, we got decent seats too in section 106. I must say section 106 is perfect. First of all the bar is right near the entrance and to make things even more perfect the women's bathroom is as soon as you exit the seating area to the left. I'm going to remember this next time I get tickets because its so convenient. It is still however a side view of the stage though, can't have it all.To the two girls in front of us who wouldn't shut up, if you wanna yap all night why bother going to a concert where other people are there that actually want to listen to the music? I started taking pics of them with flash and then I think they got the picture hahaha A little after 10pm we were kinda bored and also annoyed so we bounced and then got soaked in the rain outside. Fun times lol",13,11,12

Not my first time here and I'm sure it won't be the last. One of the guards who's name I didn't catch was a true gem. He joked with my family as he showed us ours seats and told us to enjoy our night. He demeanor was very welcoming, which I loved. Would be five stars if it weren't for that and..the fight that broke out behind me. It was a family outing which meant I had my little sister and brother near me. While they are in their teens I would much rather keep them away from such nonsense. The people involved after the fact were braced up against our seats with their elbows far too close to their heads. This was around the time Drake came out. Tickets are too expensive and the experience was too precious to have this around. They should have been brought aside by security to another area.

172,Jackie T.,"West Sacramento, CA",78,420,320,5.0,2/24/2016,"I would have to put the Garden as one of the places one absolutely has to check out when in New York. Even if you're not a sports fan. With nicknames such as, ""The World's Most Famous Arena"" and the ""Mecca of Basketball,"" why wouldn't you want to?Being a sports fan myself, I have watched many sporting events that took place here on TV. And while watching those sporting events, I have heard many sports broadcasters sing this arena's praises. So naturally, watching a Knicks game at the Garden was an absolute must for me, even if I'm not a Knicks fan. First off, I loved how easily accessible this arena is in regards to the public transit. Granted, it's NYC, and it's suppose to be easily accessible through public transit. Basically, the arena is situated where Penn Station is. So essentially, you can get to the arena's front steps by the way of either the Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, MTA Long Island Rail Road, the NYC subway, or the bus.When walking into the arena, it's hard to tell I was going to a Knicks game other than the kiosks selling Knicks gear. I guess where I'm getting at is it's pretty nondescript unlike a lot of other sporting venues I've been to. It could only just be me...Walking up to the main concourse was a bit of a trek. The staff was very helpful in leading us to where we needed to go. It felt like we took numerous escalators just to get to the main concourse. Once we got to the main concourse, I was greeted with a lot of pictures and memorabilia of the famous sporting or not sporting events that took place in this arena. Finally, we got to our section and walking up those short stairs to get to our section, I'd have to say, it was breathtaking to see  the basketball court that I've seen numerous times on TV, and seeing all those retired numbers up in the rafters. I know it's not common for someone to be utterly speechless when describing a sporting venue, but speechless I was. Well, I actually did utter a expletive in amazement...All in all, a great experience watching a Knicks game at the Garden. Not only was the product on the court fun to watch (for that particular game at least..shout out to Arron Afflalo for going off for 38 points or something and PORZINGIS!!!!!), but just taking in the sights and all the theatrics with the lights and all was a show in itself.And in other notes...celebrities spotted at the game I went to: Chris Rock & Jessica Chastain.

Plenty of places to get snacks drinks and food before going into the concert. If you've been to Golden One in Sacramento CA the set up reminded me of that (as far as food venues set up is concerned).

I've been attending basketball games at MSG all my life and every single time, it's a fun and memorable experience. I recently attended Billy Joel at MSG, which was my first concert there. Another great night! And there's really not a bad seat for any event.MSG is clean and organized and has a friendly and helpful staff to help to make the trip even more pleasurable.I've taken the All-Access Tour and would highly recommend it! You are taken to so many spots (like the Knicks/Rangers locker rooms, the Chase bridge) that you probably normally would never have access to. Tour guides are very knowledgable so feel free to ask them any questions about MSG. You will leave with a ton of interesting facts about ""The World's Most Famous Arena!"" (this phrase will probably be mentioned by your tour guide at least 10 times)The concessions at MSG are plentiful. There's a number of celebrity chefs here with stands. I would recommend ordering the Daily Burger from Drew Nieporent. It's a custom blend Pat LaFrieda patty -- a blend of brisket, short rib and chuck -- topped with bacon jam and cheesy sauce. It's probably the best thing to take back with you to your seat. So. Good. I usually order it as celebration in my team winning or as a way to cope for my team losing. Either way, it's a burger that's almost too good to be offered at an arena.One of my favorite things about MSG is how it recognizes the history of the arena itself and how some of the greatest events that have happened there. All around the various concourses is memorabilia, posters, and signs commemorating big events. It's really cool - you definitely have a better chance to view it all in its entirety if you take the tour.Now, with the addition of The Pennsy (a food hall and bar), you can make a whole day/night out of your trip to the Garden. Grab drinks/lunch/dinner/snacks before or after the event. Every visit to the Garden is sure to be a memorable one.",2,,1
178,Trey H.,"Long Beach, NY",0,82,2,4.0,5/23/2018,"This place truly lives up to its name. This is the absolute greatest arena ever. Whether you're watching the game court side or on the Chase Bridge, you still get a good view of the action. I have been here for concerts as well and was nowhere close to unhappy with my seats. The food options here are huge as well.",,,
179,Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",558,257,3437,5.0,4/24/2015,With all the updates they have done I'm one happy camper. More bathrooms and concessions and I love the West Balcony. Love the setup with the bar stools and concessions only feet away you can grab a beer or some food quickly and not miss a thing plus all the tvs Love coming here at least four times a year for a Rangers game but ever year the ticket prices are getting higher plus playoff tickets were insanely prices compared to two years ago. I understand covering cost of there renovations and all but come on. Fans spend enough at the gift store and concessions that we don't need to be killed on ticket prices. I know for myself I give MSG a lot of my hard earned money every single game I goto. I never leave there gift store without buying a new Jersey or sweater etc then hitting the concessions it's one hell of an expensive night. MSG is lucky I love the NY Rangers. They should give us Rangers fans a yelp checkin offer or something to there gift shop or a free beer would work too!,1,,

184,Josmanuel A.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",143,124,763,5.0,5/7/2016,The best arena in the world in my opinion. The seats I got to see the Knicks game where perfect. The arena looks renovated. The food inside the place is reasonable compare to other stadiums. I consider this place a museum with all the history around it. The security guards inside the building were very helpful. I will be coming back next NBA season. Let's go Knicks ..,,1,1
185,Charles H.,"Queens, NY",62,60,24,4.0,5/3/2017,"After the game I can tell you one thing: wow. The knicks were down one point, when Anthony took the ball, and you could tell that he see one thing: to put the ball in the basket. Poor Phillip, they got back from nowhere, but it wasn't enough. Ok, now to the point: it is a great facility, and they are improving from one year to another. They still need to make sure the toilets will stay clean even through a 3 hours game or concert, but beside that,   Amazing!",,,
186,Alexander W.,"Manhattan, NY",566,623,1221,4.0,12/20/2015,"Every square is a rectangle, but a rectangle isn't a square? Madison Square Garden should probably be renamed to Madison Rectangle Garden to be technically correct. The famed building itself is actually a circle and I saw no gardens. I came to the Mecca of Basketball to watch Dirk Nowitzki and my Dallas Mavericks mow down the New York Knicks. The most famous arena in the world was a little underwhelming, given its history. However, I did stand in awe at all the famous athletes, concerts, and other events that have passed through MSG. There is a good view from every seat in the arena as they are all somewhat close to the floor. An overabundance of food stands, including those specific to New York, are available to satiate your hunger.",3,2,4

Ali called him and asked him for the date. James Taylor agreed.And he didn't get front row!I've seen so many concerts, Ranger games and sporting events at MSG being a New Yorker.People still take pictures of the marque. When your trying to get a rush hour train and some, I'll be nice, ""Tourist"" stops in the middle of the sideway to snap a picture, I give them a pass and smile.It's very easy to get to, its the epicenter in NYC!",1,1,2

189,Priya S.,"New York, NY",214,151,94,3.0,2/8/2017,"MSG or ""The Garden"" is one of the most famous arenas in the world and is definitely worth a trip to see the Knicks, Rangers, or a favorite musical artist. It went under a billion dollar reconstruction which ended in 2013. Because of this, it is a pretty modern arena housed under an old structure. The food, drinks, lounges, and bathrooms were all upgraded in that renovation. That also means that seating is better- even in the upper levels. I've sat in almost every section for sporting and musical events and I think the best value (price and view combination) is in the 100s levels. If you are going for a musical event, if you get floor seats, you won't be stadium seating (since the floor is flat) so you may end up having to stand on your chair to see over the people ahead of you (which is why I recommend 100 level seating). As expected, the arena food and drinks are overpriced since you can't bring any outside food and drinks (and they do check every bag) so you don't have a choice but to by it inside the arena.",,,1
190,Hang T.,"San Jose, CA",392,896,2206,5.0,2/22/2015,"The godfather of arenas. This place is iconic. If you don't know about Madison Square Garden, you must be living in a hole in the ground.Even though it was so famous, I was expecting it to be pretty rundown and showing signs of old age. Boy, was I wrong! This place was so nicely renovated with seats that had stain-resistant fabric. I did not once feel like I needed to sanitize everything around me. Signs looked freshly made and the bathrooms were nice, clean, and plentiful. It is definitely the nicest stadium/arena I've ever been too. The food stands were also very impressive. Where else can you find arena food from Jean George and other master chefs? I was so amazed. Unfortunately I didn't try the special food, but it's a nice option to have. It's nice that they kept this landmark so clean and fixed up. It really does live up to the hype and the prestige.",1,,1
191,Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",401,773,4744,5.0,9/5/2014,"Awesome venue.I had the opportunity to attend a Michael Buble concert on my recent NYC trip.  Being a resident of an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, one does not always have the opportunity to attend an event in a setting of this magnitude.  I was beyond thrilled to have the chance to travel to NYC, let alone step foot within MSG.One of the first things I observed was that the staff is very organized.  Of course, there were throngs of other concert-goers attending (I believe the concert may have been sold out!), and the staff kept the lines moving at a decent pace at the security check point, scanning tickets, and directing people to various floors/sections.Three floors and several escalator rides later, we finally arrive at one of the upper floors/levels.  Though it shouldn't have been surprising, there were many, many snack bars present selling everything from popcorn, fried foods, to (of course) beer.  Walking into the arena itself was just amazing as I had never in my life (sadly) attended a concert in such mammoth surroundings.The concert itself was just tremendously fun and entertaining, and even Michael Buble mentioned he was thankful to be able to perform at MSG once again.  Since we were sitting in a higher section than most, we were thankful there were various monitors broadcasting the activity on the stage as well as within the crowds.  The camera would pan from Mr. Buble, to the band, to all the people smiling and singing along to the songs.  It was a great night indeed!BOTTOM LINE:  Impressive venue.  Definitely left an impression on this resident of the 50th state for sure.",22,5,12
192,David B.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",59,406,270,5.0,2/28/2016,"I'm not sure when I went to MSG for the first time. My guess is 1968 or so for a Globetrotters game or the Circus. I've attended hundreds of concerts starting with Chicago and the Beach Boys in 1975 and recently, Black Sabbath with my fifteen year old son. In between, the Grateful Dead, Cream, Billy Joel, Clapton, Jethro Tull, ELO, Aerosmith and Elton John. It's a wonderful venue, my favorite. Explaining why would cheapen it somehow. Here's to many more years, MSG. I'll be there when the lights dim and the crowd roars.",1,,
193,Daisha N.,"Seattle, WA",481,559,1574,3.0,12/14/2015,"Always a great time here. I loved being here for Jingle Ball. I was a little distracted by the amount of scalpers and guys standing outside the venue attacking you a little (verbally) asking for us to buy tickets. Clearly I already had tickets so to be honest it wasn't something I was really prepared for. There were cops around, but I just felt really weird being in front of this venue all dressed up heading in. When I got to the entrance it was INSANELY packed and I felt like I was commuting in the morning on the 4/5/6 train. I mean WOAH.. I was really afraid someone was going to get a little touchy feely. It was just a weird RUSH. When I came here for the Christmas game a while back I was a little disappointed in the set up as well, very similar. Overall I know what to be prepared for next time. I was amazed with the set up for the stage, the performances, and my experience was all 3 stars. I really enjoyed myself. I had two other people with me and we had a blast. We didn't eat or drink here because there is sooo many places around here to go to.",2,1,

Yezzy was great; however, MSG needs a lot of work.I don't go to MSG as much as I used to. Partly because of how poorly the Knicks have been playing; but also, the condition of the venue itself. I guess I've been spoiled by Barclay's, Citi-Field, MetLife Stadium & the other newer arenas in the NY area. Interesting factoid someone told me, which I never knew; it's common sense though lol...""The original Madison Square Garden was located where Madison Square Park is today.""",,,

Since being updated, the place is absolutely amazing and as state of the art as arenas can be these days. The scoreboard is amazing, and I'm actually digging the Chase Bridge (def. thought that would be an eyesore when original renderings were released)Whether you're a true New Yorker, or a visitor fro out of town, the Garden is a premiere venue and one that cannot be missed. I know we get a bad rep here for always thinking everything here is the best (NY Bias as they say...) but there is a reason why this is the most famous arena in the world, and I dare you to find one more world renowned and more prestigious.
