1,N S.,"Palm Springs, CA",2,252,339,5.0,10/26/2018,Outstanding 6  Price tho????All the staff outstanding. Especially Ty the doorman went out of his way and I came back to tip him appropriately ! The room felt like home and the bathroom suite !!! Fabulous w better safe lighting @ night and the wonderful heated floors that I really value because in my home I have to pay for that electric bill.   Really enjoyed the restaurants as well as the cocktails before bed.  Well the family enjoyed.  I only had cocoa ! Will return! The gym is so quiet and pretty much the pool can be all to yourself.  Didn't take advantage of the pool I looked @ it.  Decided to go jogging via Central Park.  Excellent location and wonderful food bar / grocery store across the hotel w decent price point especially the food bar.  Soon.   Now do something about the HyattStock.   It's been KillingMy portfolio the past two weeks!!!,,,
2,Stephanie T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",22,258,190,4.0,9/1/2018,"We requested an early check in as our flight delivered us at 8:30 am. We understand this isn't always possible however we were completely ignored and in fact, denied access to a room until after the reported check in time and requesting a manager! We were told rooms with double beds were difficult. Mina, the front desk clerk was uninterested and disengaged, frankly, robotic. The library ""waiting room"" was loaded with children most of the day and water service table went unserviced with no glassware. It is now 3:10, an over 6 hour wait and no room. After meeting the requested manager, we waited another ten minutes to be ushered to the room style we reserved on a higher level! Clearly, this room was available the whole time and we were just not worthy of the view. We don't consider this an upgrade, although we are getting some points back. Apparently a cheese tray will be sent to us tomorrow - we have dinners planned each night. A room that could accommodate a third bed (roll-away) would have been appreciated. It was an additional 30 minutes to get our luggage. #DontKnowTheirCustomers #NowWeAreLateForDinnerRevised - stars gained: Two staff members have turned things around! Stephanie in the restaurant and Asst Manager, Jinny (sp?) have been so observant and thoughtful. #TurningOutToBeAGreatStayRamone, who drove us in the hotel car to Penn Station was FIVE STAR! He did his version Cash Cab and was very entertaining. He should have his own Yelp page because he gave the best ride we've ever had with all his NY trivia.",,,
3,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,5.0,7/19/2018,"Based on price alone, my expectations were sky high when i stayed at the Park Hyatt. It's one of the top hotels in New York City, if not the entire country.From the moment we checked in it was a first class experience. The front desk staff were alerted to our arrival by the attendants who parked our car, so when we actually got to the front desk we were greeted by name and the room was ready to go. Once in the room, it was exactly what I would have expected. Spacious, well appointed, modern, beautiful floor to ceiling windows with nice views, a world class in room bar and spacious and luxurious bathroom. We had them bring a crib to the room for our toddler, and they did so with an accompanying box of toys. The bed was nice and comfy and any request we made for the room was completed with lightning speed. It's the kind of room you could hang out in all day.I spent a little time at the hotel bar which was also very impressive. As one would expect, it came with a professional mixologist who hooked up some very good cocktails for me. It was a laid back bar scene that was the perfect vibe for the hotel.As mentioned, I had sky high expectations for this hotel, and they were met in every way. A truly first class experience from start to finish and one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.",2,,2
4,Kenny W.,"Silver Spring, MD",194,263,1016,5.0,10/15/2018,"First time at NYC Park Hyatt. Amazing service, spacious room with large bathroom! Contemporary looking hotel lobby and rooms. The room is up to date with technology- was able to cast YouTube to their TV from my mobile phone. Nice fitness center. Though the indoor pool was a bit disappointing compared to Ritz Carlton HK.     Being an introvert, the staffs were too friendly for me- always greeting me and my guest. At least that is better than being rude.",,,
5,Tonya P.,"Daphne, AL",0,26,0,4.0,11/18/2018,"We stayed here for a couple nights... it was quite nice. I was kinda surprised the rooms didn't have a little more sound buffering. We could hear doors opening and closing  in the hall. My daughter took a bath and wow the water was so loud when it was draining. If someone had been sleeping in our room, they wouldn't have been once that water started to drain. It was a beautiful tub though and my daughter enjoyed her bath. I think she enjoyed her bath more than her swim at the pool. Especially given they were very particular about any type of playing in the pool.",,,
6,Tiffany D.,"San Francisco, CA",2967,2180,7458,4.0,5/15/2018,"Grand pool is great!  I dislike the architecture of going through two elevators to get to ground floor though!  That's inconvenient and seemingly like a maze. Luxurious hotel and I definitely feel as if I was in a lux hotel!  Spoiled, indeed!Breakfast continental was above the norm and I got my own French press coffee. I adored the bacon and mini-sized jam and honey from Aussieland. Bed room was of contemporary feel.  Wifi was steamless.  Fruits and water bottle was complimentary. Bathtub support could have been comfortable, but back and neck support wasn't at all! I didn't get to take advantage of all the amenities.  I felt a bit stiff here and not comfortable.  Maybe it was the layout of how you enter and exit the hotel.  It just didn't feel right at home.  It's grand for its name and reputation, but not flowing with my vibes!  Worth the experience, yes!",5,3,7
7,Emily L.,"Kirkland, WA",121,134,84,4.0,4/30/2018,"Reception was welcoming and offered us water, the room was well prepared with plenty bottled water.

8,Daniel C.,"Dallas, TX",186,46,10,2.0,7/9/2018,"This is an all-class hotel, and when I stayed here in 2015 it was a fantastic experience. This past weekend proved otherwise.The service at this hotel has gone by the wayside, and no one is looking after upkeep and maintenance. For a hotel that charges top dollar, it was a hugely underwhelming experience overall.Staff were inattentive, rarely greeted us, and didn't help at all with the luggage or check in process. They put us on the bottom floor -- and views from the room that were woeful, right into someone else's apartment.The room was not in tip top shape. The property needs maintenance - the elevator sensors don't work well, and how about the sign out front?!!PH, love the Sydney and Paris location, but you've lost a few jewels out of your crown. Won't be back.",2,2,1
9,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3836,3382,93,5.0,8/29/2018,"My mom has devoted her life to the pursuit of Hyatt points, racking up enough stay credits as an unemployed woman nearing sixty to maintain Globalist status, something otherwise only attained by young professionals who travel for work and a few crazy people on internet forums. I went to New York for ten days in July; my mom was there for a large part of my trip, and my husband Matt B. came for a few nights at the end. Matt and I were able to convert Chase points to Hyatt points and transfer those to my mom, who then booked our stay, conferring us her status. We got a sick upgrade and ended up in a huge suite. My mom, meanwhile, stayed at the Grand Hyatt because it was better for her to pay cash for a cheap room.The Park Hyatt is fancy and expensive, but it was only 5,000 points a night more than much less nice hotels in Manhattan. I think the rack rate for our suite was well over $1,000 a night, so those Chase points did a lot of work (my mom is also the one who made us both sign up for the Chase Sapphire Reserve card all our friends bust out whenever we go to dinner). Our stay also included a daily $100 breakfast credit, usable at the restaurant or for room service.The hotel was new and shiny, centrally located at 57th and 7th, across from Carnegie Hall, and right on top of a train station. I kept accidentally walking into the Park Hyatt condos, which had an almost identical entrance and a doorman who must spend all day redirecting confused tourists to their hotel. The actual condos seem to be mostly empty, the kind of place where Russian and Chinese oligarchs park their shady money.The interior was upscale with a rich contemporary aesthetic. There was a lot of cool modern art on display, and the furniture was plush and attractive. We had to wait a while for our room to open up on our first day, and we spent an hour or so hanging out in the lobby with some other early guests. We sat on a sofa across from two velvety chairs and saw multiple children fondling the fabric.Our room was spacious and beautiful, with a full living room, huge bathroom, and a powder room, just for kicks. The king bed was comfortable, as was the couch. The bathroom was impressive, with heated floors and a high-tech toilet. We ended up keeping the door to the toilet closed because the obsequious thing would snap open whenever we passed by, asking us if we were coming in for a visit. There was a nice bathtub we didn't get to use and a fantastic shower. Toiletries were all Le Labo. We didn't hoard unreasonably, but we did go home with multiple bars of soap and some bath salts.We ordered breakfast every morning, scheduling room service before we went to bed, using the handy iPad set-up. The food was good and expensive--it was easier than you'd think to spend $50 each on breakfast. The lobster egg white scramble was great, as was the bagel with lox. I got yogurt and a fruit plate once for something lighter, and these were fine, too.I do have a few nitpicks about the service. The room service came about fifteen minutes early a couple times, which wasn't my favorite at like 8 in the morning. There were other little mistakes, too, like the $16 French press not coming with milk (which we asked for on that iPad), and the New York Times we requested never showing up (Matt eventually got one from the front desk). Housekeeping skipped us the first day of our stay for no discernible reason, and we came home before dinner to find that the room was messy and the room service cart was still there. When someone finally came to take the remains of our breakfast, we asked for housekeeping while we went out. She was nice, and told us they'd clean the room and that management would talk to us. This wasn't necessary or anything, but it was a little strange when we just got perfunctory turn-down service after that, and no one did ever get in touch.None of this would really matter at even a slightly less nice hotel, but the Park Hyatt is in that luxury tier where service tends to be super thorough and detail-oriented. Hard to complain too much, though, when we got so much value for our credit card points. I'd recommend this hotel if you have the points to spare, especially if your Hyatt cultist mom will book on your behalf.",8,5,7

11,Jessica T.,"Mount Olive Township, NJ",71,74,70,5.0,10/2/2017,"Is it normal to be sad when you check out of a hotel? Because this was how I felt after having an amazing stay at the Park Hyatt.Located right across Carnegie Hall, the Park Hyatt is in an awesome location. Subway stations are conveniently located near the hotel, with 57th Street station being the closest. It's also less than a 10 minute walk to Time Warner Mall and Central Park. The staff is so friendly here and super accommodating. I arrived a lot earlier than the check-in time, and they were still able to get me a room that I was upgraded too. Sweet!I stayed in a deluxe room and I honestly felt like royalty. The bathroom was awesome with the separate soaking tub and rainfall shower. I also loved that the mirror had a tv built in so I could watch tv shows. No need to run down to the corner store if you forgot to pack something since they have you practically covered with nail care, toothbrushes, hairbrush, and shower caps.The hotel also offers a complimentary car that can drop you off within a 10 block radius. I didn't get to use it, but definitely check in with the front desk to see if you can get a chance to ride in the car. Awesome stay and I would definitely come back another time!",3,,
12,David P.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,16,12,5.0,6/28/2018,"This hotel is stunning.We arrived early in the morning, expecting to leave our luggage with the front desk and heading out for our sightseeing. We were very happy to find out that our room was already prepared for us, and we could go right on up, and the staff would bring our bags.The bags arrived promptly, and we headed out. On the way, the front desk offered us bottled water to take on our day.After spending much of the day at a nearby festival on 6th avenue, we returned for a little rest and cleanup before going out to our show. There a lot of outlets available all over the room for plugging in phones, computers, cameras, whatever. Each side of the bed had two open plugs in the wall above the night table. The workspace table had two outlets, and at least one USB charging outlet.To save time, I'll just say that everything in the room was stunning, and I will try to figure out how to upload photos.We were always greeted by the staff on our way in & out, and offered water on the way out (it was a hot few days there!)",,,

The room was spacious and very modern. The tub and shower were to die for. The pool and jacuzzi were a great way to relax. Room service came on a rolling table  table cart. It showed Saturday and there were custom umbrellas to use. They came for turn down service and gave customary water. I will definitely be coming back.,1,,2

16,Pius W.,"Portland, OR",36,19,2,5.0,7/27/2018,"This is our second time staying here at the Park Hyatt and everything was perfect once again. Talesha checked us in and was able to get us into our room early. She explained our AMEX fine hotels and resorts credits in detail, gave us a couple of drink coupons (which at $19 a drink, was very handy!), and arranged for the kids to get cookies and milk during turndown. I guess the evening shift forgot the cookies/milk, but she profusely apologized the next day and it was delivered. Of course toddlers being toddlers, they were happier eating goldfish instead. Sorry! The location is very central for those who either want to see Central Park, Columbus Circle, Times Square (shudder) or even some of the East Side. The pictures are spot on, the rooms are gorgeous. I can't think of a better place to stay in Manhattan.",,,
17,Carla L.,"Nashville, TN",89,19,32,5.0,12/21/2017,"It was my 12 year old son's first trip to NYC and he likely would have been fine with staying in a cracker box with a brick wall view. Well, I knew we'd be walking our bootys off and when I saw the bathrooms here I KNEW this was the place for me. Between the huge soak tub, heated floors, tv in the mirror, fancy bath minerals...every night was heaven for this lady. We loved the hi-tech lighting and curtains/shades. The bed and linens were also heaven. Now onto the staff. Very kind and attentive. The turn down lady came (to bring water etc) and I asked if she had any chocolate...I know ) she didn't but not much later there was a knock at the door and she was back with a beautiful gold and glass, jewelry type box filled with 4 Godiva like chocolates. So lovely and thoughtful!My luggage handle also got jammed at the airport and they sent someone up to work on that. They have someone for everything!It's a very short walk to the park, Duane Reed, Starbucks, some really nice restaurants (of all price ranges) & 5th avenue. And also very safe even late at night. Not sure why I took so long to write this. I just wrote 4 back to back ones from my trip to Europe and my trip to Nashville so I thought why not throw this one too, hehe. Hope it helps!",2,1,

The bathroom was amazing especially the shower and walking into the bathroom late at night with heated floors was a great touch. Gym: Amazing with lots of equipments and the pool was nice. Service: Bartender was great and so kind at The Library and everyone were very welcoming making us feel right at home. The only problem we had was calling for extra towels and pillows. It took multiple calls and we even waited until the next day to get our towels.,1,,
19,Chase W.,"Austin, TX",80,110,16,1.0,6/8/2018,5 Star looks 0 star treatment. 90% of the time no one greets you at front or says hello when walking around the property. Employees are stuck to their phones or chatting with one another. For such a beautiful property the service is pathetic. The only exceptional service was at the bar. The worst part about the experience was upon checkout. We had the property hold our bags. When we turned in the ticket to grab our things they took the ticket while we waited. After a couple minutes I found our bags sitting by the door 1 foot from 57th Avenue. No one came up to me employees were once again on the computer only interacting with one another. I walked over and grabbed the bags and saw no employees in sight and left. All of our luggage and my laptop bag could have been stolen very easily. Truly disappointing. We've stayed at various Hyatt high end properties such as Ziva with never any similar issues.,2,,

23,Chris S.,"Palo Alto, CA",584,155,603,5.0,2/7/2017,"If you wanted to define what a luxury hotel is, then look no further than the Park Hyatt New York. Done Deal. This is THE best. Period. Checking in was a breeze - everyone was so eager and excited to check us in, and we were escorted to our floor. And then we got to the room. Oh boy, were we shocked when we opened the door.So what we were given was not a standard room, but a Park Studio King Suite, which is basically a large luxurious studio apartment in Manhattan. A really nice one at that. I wished this was my room in real life...Amenities included, but limited to what I saw and used: Nespresso coffeemaker with chinaware, a massive! minibar (I would call it a massive bar), bathrobes, multiple TVs everywhere (I counted three in my room), free newspaper delivered every morning, custom-designed furnishings that include the sofa, tables and chairs. The cool part about the coffee and tea section is that they will consistently refill, clean and setup all your chinaware and items every time you come back to the room - this made one of us really excited about drinking coffee and tea every 5 hours...Don't worry about amenities. They have literally ANYTHING you need to make your stay enjoyable. From a sewing kit to Le Labo toiletries to 3.5mm aux cables to even the basic of things - it's all there!In addition, guests staying in suites get two clothing items laundered for no cost as well as access to the the hotel's in-house car, which was a 2017 Mercedes S-Class. Remember to check because there is no reservation system with the house car. Good tip to remember. Some highlights: Dat pool doe...seriously. DAT POOL DOE. Fitness center awesome. Much happy. Spa, steam room, locker room best I've ever seen. Technology at your whim. Room Service all within 5 minutes. I love these guys. Mercedes S Class as a house car with 10 blocks? Done. Material so highly valued even I didn't want to sit on the sofa because it was so nice. Ridiculously fast WiFi. Dog Friendly, saw a corgi fly by my feet at the lobby.In summary, this is probably up there with the previous hotels that occupied the top spot, such as the Andaz Tokyo and the Mandarin Oriental. Attention to details, a plethora of amenities that anyone can ask for, and a priceless memory created with this hotel is all it takes to call this one of the best hotels in the world. Special thanks to Park Hyatt New York for the most outstanding service, the most outstanding hotel quality and the most rewarding experience ever!",7,4,4

The staff was attentive, and addressed any needs or concerns immediately. My husband ooh'd and ahh'd over their floral arrangements more than when we were at the Bellagio's conservatory. #icantevenThe drinks we had in their bar were delicious, and DH said it was the best old fashioned he'd ever had!

I have to say I was blown away by the suite we stayed in, the impeccable service rendered to us right from the time our car reached the front of the hotel to the moment we were leaving. If you think you've stayed in good hotels, think again. This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in and I would highly recommend it. We stayed in the Park King Suite and this room was laden with technology and everything felt right in place. I didn't feel like I was in a hotel room. The suite consists of a large loving room and a bedroom plus two bathrooms. And the automated toilet was just a fin luxury to have :)All the amenities in the room as well as in the hotel in itself felt top notch and rich. Really loved the decor.And finally what blew us away was the hand written card wishing us for the anniversary plus complementary champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries ended our 2016 in style.

29,Jude W.,"Duluth, GA",0,14,30,4.0,1/15/2018,"Park Hyatt NYC is inside of One57, one of the newly built skyscrapers in the city. It offered unbeatable hardware quality compared to other hotels at this level. I am really impressed by the heated floor at bathroom and the modern and simplistic bathroom design. Their Le Labo Tubereuse 40 amenity has a really good fragrance and you cannot find it elsewhere.In checked in, the front desk is very nice and proactively offered us an upgrade to a One bedroom suite with some view of the Central Park for my Globalist status. This room is one of the most elegant room I have stayed in all hotels. It has 5.1 surrounding sound system, chic furniture and beautiful bathroom. The main bathroom even has an high end TOTO washlet.The pool and SPA is at 25th floor, it is a full length heated pool, there is a 10 way shower system in the locker room. It is very nice. However the Shampoo they provide in the SPA seems not so good.The second day we had an unpleasant experience in the Living Room restaurant. The wait simply offered no service at our breakfast while we were running out of water and he was stand closest to us. At the same time, he was actively refill water to some other customers across the room. I guess when they know my breakfast is included, they are offering a inferior service to us, or they simply discriminated us from other customer for whatever reason. Moreover, when we asked questions for items in the menu, the bald waiter was explaining and walking away at the same time. I could not even heard the last word he said, nor to say my further questions. I think this behavior is quite unacceptable for hotel at this level, if this restaurant is a standalone restaurant at this price, I will rate it as 1 star. Other than the service, the food is pretty good. The ironic thing is they charge a $15 tip automatically for this service as a breakfast.Other than this unpleasant experience, all other staff in this hotel is very friendly and helpful. If there is one more thing I think they can improve, I would wish they could clean their dusty glass in the room.Also for people looking for great view, the hotel is locate below 25 floor of the building, so you don't really have very good view. But I still think Park Hyatt is worth a try.Lastly, would I return to PH NY? I really enjoyed everything here, however the very unpleasant breakfast experience makes me hesitated. Especially after the amazing service at St Regis just a few blocks away set a high expectation for the hotel at this level.",1,,

As many of the reviews have stated, the level of service that the employees of this hotel bring to its guests are top-notch and extremely professional. The rooms are very comfortable with an amazingly huge bed. The bathroom and shower were unbelievable. Simply luxury all around. The Nespresso machine in the room was awesome and I had way too many espresso shots. The pool was nice and the steam room was a great touch. Locker rooms were awesome with many amenities all around. We did use their car service once but keep in mind that the car service can only take you 10 blocks from the hotel, but it's still a really cool service they provide. The concierge, especially Noel, was extremely helpful and provided many great suggestions. This was the perfect hotel to sit back and relax in after a long day of walking around the city.",3,1,1

It's as Midtown as you are going to get.  The Pool, My goodness, the experience is something that you have to experience first-hand, relax and let yourself calmly drift away , is that orchestra music you hear in the waves? yes, the pool sings to you plus the view from the 25th floor is amazing, adjacent to the fitness center, you will feel vibrant after a workout but if you want to be entirely plush and relax in  your own sanctuary then escape to your room hi above the city streets, sink into the deep soaking marble bath, heated floors are just a fraction of the way it will make you feel,  unwind, or get your glam on and ready to take the city by storm. If you seek serenity you will find it. You will also be delighted with the staff, they will go out of their way to make you feel like the only guest they have, the level of service is unparalleled but as with all great things, this experience is no Hyatt House so make sure to bring along your titanium card.",,,
32,Shmuel B.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,169,161,5.0,4/27/2016,"The Park City Hyatt on 57th Street is like no other hotel I've ever been too. From the door man to the pool boy, from the front desk girl to the housekeeping manager Brandon S., it really is amazing how each and every employee treated us with the utmost respect, and always had a smile on their face and was soft-spoken. Absolutely no pomp at all. No I'm better than you attitude. Just, what can I do for you. Impressive. I think this is what distinguishes this establishment from other hotels. It really is remarkable how the hotel managed to attract such genuinely, sweet employees that seemingly will do anything to make your stay more pleasant. No wonder they won the U.S. News & World Report 2016 for #1 Best New York City Hotel.The hotel itself was decorated very beautifully. Because this Park Hyatt is modern, there was marble and stone on the walls and floor. The lobby areas are laden with art, and there's water available for guests in the lobby.My room, a standard on the ninth floor, was amazing! The decor was modern. A large screen TV filled the wall in front of the beds. A nice size desk sat by the window. The bathroom was very large and filled with very cool features like a rain shower, a TV in the mirror (I doubt you have that at home), heated floors, and multiple lighting options. The bathroom's fixtures were top of the line. Also there was a male and female vanity, and separate doors within the bathroom for shower and toileting (that sounds funny).Every room within the room had a switch that controlled the lights. Also, an iPad (with my name on the screen) allowed me to request items like complimentary shirt pressing (they expedited this for free within 12 hours at a cost of $45 to the hotel), complimentary shoe shining (four hour turnaround), housekeeping items like extra soaps, shave kits, combs, noise machine, blankets, etc. On top of this, you can request an exact time when you want the items delivered to your room. Amazingly, but with no surprise, my items arrived on time to the dot each time I ordered them. The best part is that the guy who brings the items bows slightly when he hands them to you. My wife jokingly told me not to get used to this type of treatment. Darn!In the room's safe was a sewing kit, lint roller, and shoe shine kit. In the bathroom, I found a box with a comb, touthbrush, nail filer, and various other personal care items. Talk about attention to detail! I also really enjoyed the atomatic window shades and sheers (yes, they'll blackout the room any time of the day).The bedding was so incredibly comfortable that I called up the housekeeping manager Brandon and ordered the same pillows, shams, and duvet covers the hotel used. He informed me that part of my order is coming from out of state, and that he'd personally cover the shipping costs. That's what I mean when I say this hotel has the best staff soup to nuts.As far as hotel amenities: the pool was absolutely gorgeous, as was the steam room (good steam action!) and hot tub. The mens locker room was something else. It had an amazing shower that watered me from all directions, and all the same toiletries that the room had.The Hyatt also has house cars which will drive you, for free, any where within a ten block radius (two Mercedes-Benz are available until six pm, whereas just one is available after six pm). Great feature! Just tell the bellboy where you want to go and you're off! Well, most of the time, at least. When I got there at 615 pm, the car was being used by another guest and one person was waiting ahead of us. The bellboy told us that it was a busy time of day and gave us an ETA. Although we could've waited, my wife and I decided to walk because we didn't want to miss our show. No big deal.Ultimately, there are a plethora of hotels to stay at in the city, many of which are cheaper than the PCH. I think the service here and the staff's desire to please make it a worthwhile choice and justify the price point. The attention to detail within hotel and the many, many supplementary amenities make me feel like I made a great choice by staying here. I'll always remember the service and hospitality. I can't wait to return!",6,4,3

Upon entering the room we were greeted with scratches on the furniture and a huge patch of someone else's hair in the shower. The worst part, however, was the dangerous situation that we encountered in the hot tub. My girlfriend and I were in the hot tub when someone else alomost tripped on the floor of the hot tub.

43,Mike N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",368,203,307,3.0,7/29/2016,"This is an extremely high-end expensive hotel, and while it has many great features, I thought there were too many details lacking for what you would expect.Positives:*The bed itself was extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby in it. Very luxurious king-sized bed indeed. *The room (park deluxe king) is quite large and spacious. *The bathroom area of the floor is heated which is nice especially at night. *The pool area is gorgeous and the fitness center is on another level from most hotels. The locker rooms are stocked with private showers and restrooms, there is a bathing suit dryer, and toiletries for showering and shaving. The gym area itself is stocked with newspapers, complimentary headphones, chilled towels, and cold water bottles. I couldn't find a way to control the television however. *They will escort you right to your room upon check-in. *There are extra services offered such as a complimentary private car within a 10 block radius, first come first serve. Also the concierge was friendly and helpful. *It's in a great location just down the block from a metro stop and a couple blocks from Central Park/Times Square/MOMA, and of course just across from Carnegie Hall. Negatives:*The biggest negative for me was the bathtub. The bath itself was nice, but holy moly, I'm surprised it didn't wake half the hotel up when it was draining afterward. It sounded as if an angry troll was inside of the pipes and trying to get out, clanking and gurgling. Be wary if your spouse/partner/child is sleeping, because they won't be sleeping for long. This could potentially ruin a night's stay honestly. I had to just stop the draining and left it with water still in it. I posted a quick video of the ruckus in my tweet here: twitter.com/SoloTravelGo…*Checking in was a stressful process. Arriving after the stated check-in time on my confirmation, I was told that it would be at least an hour before a room was available because it hadn't been cleaned. This wasn't acceptable to me as I had an appointment I had to make downtown. Thankfully, it wasn't too long before they decided they could upgrade me from a park king to a deluxe king. The other couple that was told their suite wouldn't be ready for a few hours wasn't so lucky. Also, the fact that they only have one computer in the lobby for a hotel of 200 rooms means you may find yourself waiting even longer when there are problems like this. But at least there are comfortable benches in the lobby. And if the hotel is indeed sold out of rooms, you may find yourself waiting for hours after your confirmed check-in time for the room to be cleaned and available, which I find inexcusable for a hotel of this supposed caliber.*The ipad type tablet/tv connection was beyond confusing to me. It was nice to have the option to play music when I walked in, but after watching a tv show, I eventually gave up on trying to get it back to the music setting. They also have a horrible battery life apparently, because I moved it off it's charging stand at about 11pm, and when I woke up in the morning around 8, it was completely dead. It's not as if it was running anything other than the installed custom program they have. And I couldn't find a manual for how to use it. *While the majority of things are very nice, some things seem weirdly cheap. The bathrobe, for example, was quite uncomfortable and thin; and the slippers in the wardrobe may fit the average sized 12 year old, but there was no way they were fitting on my feet.*Maybe it's just New York, but nobody seemed that friendly, minus the concierge. The lifeguard couldn't care less that I was in the pool area. The doormen may have glanced in my direction once or twice. And the woman I first encountered at the check-in desk was likely stressed, but I was not getting pleasant vibes from her at all. All in all, it is very doubtful I would spend a large chunk of my money to stay here again with the problems I encountered, especially when there is no shortage of very nice properties to choose from in New York.",7,5,

Updated review","I stayed at this property to celebrate a milestone.  Was there Nov 29-Dec 4 and absolutely enjoyed the entire weekend.  NYC was buzzing with excitement about the holidays, but the hotel made the stay that much more memorable.  It is such a beautiful property - our room wrapped the corner for great views, attentive staff starting with lobby to front desk to concierge and management staff.  Enjoyed the gym on top floor (spectacular atmosphere), spa and of course, the bar on lobby level.  Just a wonderful property that I will revisit again and again.",1,,
45,Adam W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",115,1,0,1.0,12/16/2017,Just ate at the Hyatt and had the worst experience of our lives. The Bolognese tasted like salted down spagettio from a can. The burgers were cold and tasteless. The fries were like bricks...the server came by our table one time to get order and the we never saw them again. I love the Hyatt chain typically however this was a bad taste in my mouth...pun intended. Please save your hard earned time and money and go anywhere else!,,1,
46,Kristen B.,"South Columbus, Columbus, OH",0,1,0,5.0,9/3/2018,"We had a delightful 2 night stay at The Park Hyatt. We were there during the busy Labor Day weekend and our checkin ended up being slightly delayed, but the front desk staff did an excellent job of keeping us updated on timing and provided us with complimentary drinks at the hotel bar area while we waited. The suite we stayed in was very modern and had fantastic views of 57th St including Carnegie Hall. All of the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome; the housekeepers even left us a friendly handwritten note in response to a request we made! The breakfast both mornings were delicious - my tastebuds basked in the glory of the Lobster Avocado Egg White scramble one day and the Goat cheese frittata the other, my husband enjoyed the 57th Street breakfast so much the first morning he had it the second as well! The fitness center facilities were very clean, well-stocked with chilled towels and water bottles, and offered incredible views over Central Park and the surrounding areas. Highly recommend!",,,
47,Austin C.,"O'Fallon, IL",113,2,0,5.0,4/4/2017,"I want to start by saying that Hyatt is my preferred Hotel brand. I make it a point to stay there when I travel if I can, even if it means paying slightly more than a comparable hotel, like a Hilton for example. Needless to say, I had high expectations coming into the hotel. As soon as I stepped in however, all my expectations were greatly exceeded. Throughout my stay I was always asked if I needed anything, and always greeted at the door, but not to the level where it became at all intrusive. In addition, when my iPad charger wasn't working, the employee I mentioned it to not only made sure to have it fixed by the time I arrived back in my room, but also remembered who I was so he could check in with me to ensure that everything was working properly.The room itself was the best I've ever been in. Stylish, clean, and extremely spacious, and it made for an absolutely amazing stay.Personal touches and attention to detail are what make the entire Hyatt collection what it is, but the staff here took it one step further. Next time I visit New York, I will absolutely stay here, and believe me, I'm already looking forward to it.",1,,1
48,Virginia L.,"San Francisco, CA",73,68,82,4.0,4/3/2016,"Reviewing on behalf of my dog, Flopsie.  Bark Hyatt they call this... Bark worthy indeed. We read about the Park Hyatt from JetSetPets.com which raved about all the dogmenities available for the four legged friend as well as the proximity to the biggest urban toilet in America and decided to stay there.The hotel was overall quite friendly. Many staff members greeted Flopsie with petting and compliments (and trust me, the way to get the hoomin to open her wallet is to pay tribute to the dog).  Flopsie did NOT get the following mentioned the VIP (Very Important Pooch) program:1. Amanda Hearst-curated NYC Doggie Guide, featuring custom illustrations by Sophie + LiliExclusive access to seasonal looks for pups curated by Barneys Fashion Office and Brooklyn-based Love Thy Beast2 An a la carte menu for canine specialty services including dog walking service, off-site grooming and custom tail-or made jackets from Love Thy Beast3. A Chef Sebastien-inspired organic dog menu4. Identification tag with hotel's name and telephone number5. Loaner Rain wear (which we needed and hoomin did not bring because Hotel said they had loaner)6. Complimentary essentials such as paw wipes7. Kong classic treat-dispensing toy with all-natural almond butter (hoomin brought one from home so it didn't matter)8 . Pup welcome letter from General Manager Walter BrindellPHNY provided the following item:, 1. Savory delights including a custom flavor ""Haute Dog"" canine treats from Nesbits2. Loaner dog bed (this required a couple of calls to guest services but nonetheless was quite comfy.)  3. food and water bowls4. Bark Hyatt waste bag dispenser and waste bags5. Bark Hyatt Wet Food Can Cover6. Use of the House Car (an S class) to dinner and to go shopping at the Bloomies Flagship store - Perfect for the Rainy Days because Flopsie hates walking in the rain. Also, Hoomin and Flopsie liked the driver because 1. he has a dog named Rocky, 2. he gave us some useful tips to being a pooch in the Big Apple, and 3. he gave us advice on the ""cleanest"" street to walk the dog - he was fully aware of where the construction sites were so we were able to avoid the chaos on our walks. This hotel is rated as 4 stars for Dogs. Dog would stay again due to it's proximity to the park, the available dogmenities, and the awesome house car. The cost for Up to six nights - $100 per stay.  It's a good deal considering many hotels charge per night.",4,1,5
49,Tracy L.,"San Ramon, CA",207,855,278,4.0,7/15/2016,"This hotel has many good things going for it. It's new and located in a great place - just south of Central Park.  It makes jogs or walks in the park super easy.  The metro is also just at the end of the block, and of course there are restaurants and coffee shops all around.  The pool and gym are beautiful, and you should make sure to go for a swim if you have the time.  The hotel also provides town car service to within ten blocks of the hotel. We actually had to switch hotels since they ran out of space on our stay, and Ramon (I think that was his name) drove us to the next hotel - and he was great!The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated.  I loved how the bathroom lights up dimly when you get up in the middle of the night.  We got a handicap accessible room, so although we did not have a bathtub, we got a really big shower and I found the bathroom to work well for us.  So although the stay was great, I did not rate it as 5 stars because at the insane rate they charge per night, I expect superior customer service. Although everyone was nice and just fine - that is the thing - they were just fine, not exceptional. We've stayed at a Ritz Carlton before, and let's just say that for the price they charge here, I expected what we got at the Ritz.",1,,

Asked downstairs to print tickets out for the Empire I had purchased, it was printed and under my door in minutes, the restaurant in the lobby is VERY pricey, but what do you expect. The only downfall was the front desk girls, no personality. I had made sure to specify early check in as we were flying from Hawaii and landing at 7 am, but they were unable to accommodate us till 12. I used points to book a room and was disappointed that they put us in 1016, no view whatsoever and smaller room then i had before, especially after traveling for 9 hours and having stayed in many HYATT's to achieve this room.

Architecture, art and design - it's among the best of the best in the greatest city in the world.  We visit midtown Manhattan twice a year for business & fun. Over the past four years, we've tried several different hotels and have found Park Hyatt to be one of our favorites; not only for it's proximity to Broadway Theater, Central Park, great restaurants and fancy shopping but for the intimate and attentive service and large rooms and suites. The hotel is quiet, the service and food wonderful, decor and furnishings impeccable. They use expensive china settings for in-room dining - that's a leap of faith and I hope it's sustainable - it makes me feel very special to have my dinner delivered on $400 worth of beautiful plates.  We book the Park Side Suite or West Side suite when we stay (West Side larger and more expensive) - it's about $1000/night and up for the suites but you can sometimes use Hyatt points plus cash ($400 + 30k points night) for the Park Side Suite - call WOH - you can't do it on the website). They have a relationship with Marea Restaurant, which is literally around the corner facing Central Park, and the concierge can help get you a dinner reservation. If you are lucky enough to have a friend with a NYAC membership or connection, (Private club NYAC with its unbelievable CP views!) and wants to invite you for drinks and dinner (don't decline that invitation), that's also practically out the door of the PHNY.

We checked in late at night with a very sleepy baby after a 5 hour flight and 2 hour cab ride due to traffic. Check in was smooth, relaxing and very efficient. Our bags were brought up to our room and we were upgraded to a west side suite. There were some fun bath toys and organic bath products in the room for our baby in the crib which was all set up so despite the lateness of the night, we felt like we could settle in immediately. Will definitely be back!",2,,1

63,Eman R.,"Rockville, MD",0,73,0,4.0,7/3/2017,"Simply, all of our future hotel stays will be compared to this stay at the Park Hyatt New York.  It was our first experience in the area and with the Park Hyatt brand, and we came into it with very high expectations.  Those high expectations were somehow surpassed.  I reached out to the guest relations staff before we made the trip to link reservations and mentioned that we were in town for my wife's birthday.  Immediately, the very friendly staff member (Jenniffer initially, then Ani) asked about cake preferences.  I thought we would just get a small, complimentary cake that was a standard amenity.  No, they went above and beyond--they actually obtained a large, beautiful, chocolate cake (I mentioned my wife likes chocolate) from a very well-known bakery in the area and had it waiting for us in the room when we checked in (with two complimentary, huge Voss waters and silverware).  And, there was a wonderful, hand-written card accompanying beautiful setup.  Thank you!Overall it was a wonderful stay that was almost perfect:1) Complimentary upgrade to a huge deluxe king room that was on the 16th floor with a great view of Carnegie Hall and the exciting crowds of NYC.2) The air was extremely clean and well filtered.  3) Everything was immaculate and exquisitely maintained.  Also, the room was very well sound insulated and the drapes kept things darkened when closed (even with floor-to-ceiling windows).4) They managed to recognize when we left our room for dinner and had someone come in and do a quick cleaning and turndown for the night.  The only small (very small) negative is that the person only put one water back instead of two and took towels but didn't put extras back (my wife was using extra towels for her hair, etc.).  5) The huge bathroom with heated floors, rainforest shower, and huge soaking tub (not to mention in mirror TV) was unbelievable.  And, the towels and robes were very high quality.6) The only negative was during checkout.  I called for a cart and gave our valet ticket number to the front desk.  He said someone would be right up, but 30 minutes later, no one arrived.  I called back and the new person who answered had someone at our door immediately and apologized.  We then went to the garage entrance (it was easier to leave from that side of the building), but had to wait another 15-20 min in the hot garage entrance while the valets try to find the car.  It turns out there was a mixup with the numbers (and the ticket wasn't linked in the reservation system to our room like it should have been).     a. The Park Hyatt bellman who came with us (Tye) was extremely apologetic and proactively gave us cold water, contacted his manager who came down to make sure the valet charge was waived, and also refreshingly honest about the mistake.  It was handled the right way and everything worked out (I appreciated how well they handled it--mistakes happen, but it's the response that really makes a difference).7) Almost, every staff member we encountered was extremely helpful, introduced themselves, and genuinely seemed to care.I always wondered if a hotel could really be worth what many would consider an expensive/luxury rate per night.  After this experience, I am convinced of it being worth it and already planning future trips to this location.  Our stay at the Park Hyatt New York has converted me to a Hyatt loyalist also and we will look to stay within the franchise a lot more in the future (for both business and pleasure trips).",1,,1

The rain shower alone makes it worth a stay.  The location is great -- just about on the park and within walking distance of plenty -- and the service was impeccable. We were given a ride in the house car (available, I believe, for trips of 10 or fewer blocks), which was convenient and beat the heck out of a taxi.  It's not a value hotel, of course, but if you have a chance to stay here, I don't think most people could be disappointed.",,,

You can't get the best views from the rooms - the highest floor for rooms is 23. The nespressos in the mini bar was a nice treat each morning.The pool area is very nice, the gym is nicer than many gyms you might find that require memberships (not only cardio equipment - dumbbells up to 50lbs), and locker rooms were stellar as expected.",1,,
76,John C.,"Randolph, MA",3,61,1,4.0,4/21/2015,"Amazing location, room was unbelievable, service was very good.  Upon arrival they ask your name and call it up to the reception desk.  Your room keys are ready and within 5 minutes the luggage had arrived. The rooms are spacious, clean and have modern amenities (lights and drapes are all on wall control panels).  The tablet for the room has your name on it welcoming you, and there are several types of music loaded to play. Too bad it doesn't play through the tv set or speakers, just the tablet speaker.Bathroom is amazing, rain shower to die for.  Watch out for VERY hot water. One morning I made a coffee run to starbucks (across street) and came back with hands full of coffee.  The lobby greeter helped by pushing for elevator and selecting the lobby floor.  On the lobby floor the concierge did the same for my room floor. Amazing. The only down side:  upon check in they ask if you want a paper in the AM. My brother chose the times at 7:00 each morning.  It never came. Also turn down shows up at 6pm even if you enter into the tablet that you want it at 8:30.For the price I expect them to get these things right.",2,1,1
77,Zichuan Z.,"Manhattan, NY",32,2,2,5.0,3/19/2015,"Overall, my stay at PHNY was amazing. Stayed here one night to celebrate Valentine's Day. I remember I booked a studio suite room, and the staff at the front desk apologized she couldn't give me an upgraded suite since all rooms were booked up on Valentine's Day. However, when I entered the room, I realized it was actually a Park Junior suite, which is one level up from the room type I booked. We were escorted to the room by an associate. The room is spacious at 800 square feet, and boasts a living area and a long entryway. The decor is simple yet luxurious. Every piece of furniture is designed with detail. It is super clean without any wear and tear since it opened only six months ago. The mini bar hides in a huge armoire, fully stocked with different types of drinkware, liquor, wine, and a brand new Nespresso machine. I have never seen a mini bar as impressive as this one. There is a modified iPad mini in the work area with information about the hotel and you can request all kinds of service directly through the iPad. There is also a media hub that has numerous types of outlets. Although it does not have an iPod dock, you may request a connection cable. There are two large TVs (living area /sleeping area) with a surround sound audio system. Even the remote control has an LCD screen. Simply amazing. The bed is very comfortable, neither too soft nor too firm. A room control panel is on either side of the bed. The bathroom is so big that it is almost the size of a New York boutique hotel room. As far as I know, the suite bathroom has the same amenities as a standard room except the bidet-style toilet, which might be the fanciest toilet I have ever used. There are two shower heads, one for hand-held use and the other one is a ceiling-mounted rainfall shower. The shower experience is phenomenal although I have to say the water temperature is sort of lukewarm. There is also a freestanding tub, which is fantastic as well. There are also a couple of incidents during my stay.When we arrived at the hotel at around 3pm (which is the hotel check-in time), the room was still not ready. We had to wait in the lobby lounge for around half an hour. Although I didn't expect this to happen, I fully understand the situation since it was quite a busy day. After I explained to the server, he offered to compensate us with free beverages. This was awesome.The hotel emailed me several days before my arrival and asked whether I had any special requests. Since I was staying for Valentine's Day, I asked if they could plan some romantic gestures in room. The hotel replied that the arrangement of rose petals would cost 80 dollars. I emailed back and ordered the service. However, upon entering the room, I did not find any arrangement. So I told the associate who escorted us to room about the issue Around 15 minutes later I received a call regarding desired turndown service time and the person also mentioned they did not arrange the elements because I never confirmed it. Therefore, I requested the service again. When we returned to the hotel after dinner, the rose petals were already arranged and chocolate-covered strawberries were served. Nice!For breakfast, one of the dishes we had is foie gras served with mushrooms and boiled egg, which was fantastic. The service was very attentive as well. Overall, the experience was simply amazing. I highly recommend it to everyone.",3,1,1

80,Irene A.,"Palo Alto, CA",323,67,38,5.0,11/29/2014,"We've stayed at a lot of hotels in Manhattan and this is as good as any luxury hotel we've been to in recent years (including Langham Place, the Quin, Mandarin Oriental).  All these hotels are around the same area, close to Carnegie Hall, the Museum of Art and Design, Columbus Circle.  We got a great package deal and also got upgraded, so we enjoyed a generously-proportioned room for our family of four. The room was bigger than our room at the Quin where we stayed earlier this year.The service is outstanding.  There are plenty of people around to greet you and help you with whatever you need.  Everyone seems really happy and friendly; the staff here has great energy and we enjoyed talking to many of them throughout our stay.  One nice touch:  the hotel has a concierge limo which can take you anywhere within a 10 block radius.  In the midst of a blizzard, it was a welcome offering.Getting greeted our first night with chocolate truffles and Asian pears was a nice touch.  Small details like this are what set apart fantastic hotels from ones that are luxurious but not that memorable.We found the mattresses to be firm and comfortable and the room temperature easy to control and adjust.The bathroom is generously sized, with radiant heat, warm toilet seats, and a comfortable bathtub and huge shower.I was grateful for not only the free WiFi but also being able to use it without having to sign in or have a limit on the number of devices we could connect to it.The hotel and rooms are elegantly decorated with a simple, clean, modern look -- an environment I much prefer to stay in than the trendier boutique hotels like the ACE, the Standard, or the Gansevoort where they're screaming ""LOOK HOW HIP WE ARE HERE"".The only downside I found was that the rooms are not so far above ground that you're insulated from the street noise.  You can still hear plenty of noise from the 10th and 11th floors where we stayed.  And, there is not much of a view, but then again, most of the other luxury hotels we've stayed in in Manhattan don't have much of a view.Our package included breakfast at the hotel restaurant, which was really fabulous but stunningly overpriced if you just want eggs, bacon, coffee/juice and toast/pastry.  On other mornings we sampled the sweet potato pancakes, waffles, three egg omelet, egg white frittata with kale, and egg white scramble with lobster, avocado and spinach (my mouth is watering just thinking about it!) and were over the moon.",11,2,3
81,Sarah S.,"Houston, TX",10,21,12,5.0,3/30/2015,"This is the first time I wish I could add more stars. Everyone we encountered was so kind and professional. They greeted us upon sight. If I was rolling a bag, someone jumped in to help. Even the doors open for you. There were light heaters as you enter/exit so you can bundle up or down depending on which way. The room was first rate, modern looking luxury. There was a TV in he bathroom which was open and spacious. Not what I expected in New York. It was a dream come true in every sense. Jim out front was amazing. He hooked us up with great info and treated us like old friends (we had never met him before). We had housekeeping twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening where they put out house shoes for you. This is how a princess must feel! They also left us champagne and chocolates after our arrival since we were celebrating our anniversary. They had complimentary cars to take you short distances (both Mercedes) and the drivers are so nice and professional. I can't say enough good things! Even the free Le Labo beauty products are fantastically perfect for men or women. I brought them home!

83,Jacob C.,"New York, NY",2,78,23,5.0,3/19/2016,"I stayed here for 1 night recently. The staff are fantastic and the property is gorgeous in every way. The attention to detail is superb and no detail is overlooked. The Park King room, the hotels base room is huge and comparable in size to a base suite at many NYC hotels. I didn't have the opportunity to use the 25th floor pool but it looked gorgeous. Wifi was mostly good but was spotty at times. The bed was very comfortable and the Nespresso in room  coffee very appreciated. My room also had 3 free bottles of park Hyatt branded water. The mini bar had a great selection and was of course 5x the price it should be. The rain shower was awesome as were the Le Labo toiletries. The room had a nice bath tub but I didn't use it. There was also a large screen TV and an in room iPad. The drapes were electronically operated which I've never seen before. The room also had Park Hyatt branded tote bag and garment bag in the closets. 2 real complaints about the hotel, 1 minor, 1 pretty big. Minor: the Nespresso machine is really loud & will easily wake up someone up. Major: the lights were controlled by buttons not switches. They weren't intuitive at all and had to be pressed a few times. The lag was also a little too long. Conventional switches might not be as fancy, but they work the right way every time. That would said, I would absolutely return here.",1,1,1

86,Thomas L.,"Philadelphia, PA",88,68,13,5.0,7/26/2015,"Maybe I'm biased because I usually stay in hotels along the lines of La Quinta and Holiday Inn, but I was completely blown away by this hotel. I was only here for one night but this is the true definition of luxury and exclusivity. With nightly room rates in excess of my monthly mortgage payment, I would expect nothing less than the best. Upon entering the ground floor, you have to ascend to the actual lobby one floor up, isolated from the hustle of 57th street. From this point on, multiple staff that you interact with will make it a point to address you by name. I felt as if I was walking around in a private, exclusive condominium as the halls were dead silent and you needed proximity card access in the elevator to get to your floor. The room itself is gorgeous and employs technology unseen in the typical hotel room. An iPad docked in the desk area of the enclosed terrace can be used for service requests or simply to play music while you unwind. Just amazing. Even the employees sent to you for the most minor of requests, such as bringing a bucket of ice, presented the ice as though they were announcing the arrival of your 1st born. Everything here was just so indulgent and classy. Staying here is not an experience to be enjoyed alone. Bring your spouse or surprise a friend with a weekend getaway.

It featured some of the best things I've come across in the best hotels worldwide, and where I come from, excellent hospitality ins't a ""luxury"" so people recognize it immediately when they feel it elsewhere. To me this is the best luxury hotel in whole Manhattan area, LA, Miami and Chicago. I've stayed and visited nearly all the top luxury hotels in Manhattan on different occasions at different times through the years, some were big disappointments ""The Carlyle, The Peninsula, Four Seasons"" and the other majority didn't feel that special ""The Ritz, St. Regis, The Plaza.."" or felt a bit old or the rooms felt heavily stuffed/decorated ""not in an elegant feel even"" even previous to the opening of this one by years (though other features of these hotels are great like lobbies, restaurants/bars, service.."". I'd say the only strong rival to this hotel for the moment is definitely Baccarat, though each one has a very distinctive style to me, and way further down comes then Mandarin Oriental and The Surrey ""this last one is great actually but not on Park Hyatt scale"". Anyway back to the review, I love art, perfumes and food, and this surely place combine them all perfectly!!!! It's one of the extremely rare hotels that introduced me to new fantastic smells/product lines ""i.e. Villa D'este Como, Le Bristol Paris.."", I fell in love with NYC's Tubereuse 40, thanks to this hotel I knew of, absolutely amazing. Art is EVERYWHERE and in excess in this hotel, in all shapes and forms, in the manners of all staff and their demeanor, to the presentation of things/service, to paintings/sculptures/music/details everywhere. There are many specially curated installments and amenities scattered and I was once given a special art tour throughout the hotel to check some of it from ground floor to the spa level ""oh which is btw on the top floor overlooking Central Park, not tucked somewhere underground Four Seasons!"". I once was upgraded to a Park Suite King with absolutely zero idea or anticipation! Was walked up to my room with a manager and he suddenly checked his iPad and said something like well will you be interested in a suite? :)! ""we were chatting and I replied to a question that I've stayed at Paris's, Milan's and Dubai's and was ever looking forward for this one since I heard about it so maybe that triggered something:)!, they're all amazing, Dubai's is very true to the city, Paris's is very elegant/cozy feeling somehow, Milan's is gorgeous!"". Heated floors, among many other in-room & hotel's features that I don't recall/didn't pay attention to until later for some reasons, gorgeous layout and interior, 2 separate Japanese tech toilets and a rainfall shower but the trick is that there is a spot light on it so water looks spectacular ""I've seen rainfall showers but lacking that feature that just adds greatly to it!"", EXCELLENT room mini bar, full of excellent selections, coffee machine ""didn't pay attention but I think was Nespresso"" and full coffee porcelain table set, very spacious suite and there always seemed to be some complimentary stuff with a personalized hand written note whenever I step agin into the room ""fruits, chocolates, water&dessert.."". Intuitive tech everywhere in the room, all small personal stuff provided ""umbrella, slippers, tote, water bottles etc.. and all with hotel's emblem"". Ultra feel of privacy & discretion all the time I'm there, in room or getting to the room or out or around amenities of the hotel which I just want from such establishments. I spend the least time ever inside hotels or hotels' businesses since I get busy outside/opt for outside options, BUT this hotel kept me willingly indoors the most I really could remember! To me things and stuff come&go, they get outdated and not necessarily please all tastes or even the same taste all the times, to me it's always people who make the experience, they're the integral element keeping everything else the way they just should be. This hotel is filled with awesome staff, Lynne Bredfeldt, Patrick Eissa and Maxine Karlinsky among the many great others who are always extremely friendly/professional/genuine. I MUST give a special salute to THE MAN, THE GREATEST bellman/valet ever, CHRISTOPHER! This big guy is the embodiment of the hotel's spirit to me and he perfectly reflects the soul and vibes of the big city we're in. I could go on&on&on saying stories I've encountered about how good he is. Thank you guys!",1,1,3
91,Ricky C.,"San Francisco, CA",48,221,4,4.0,8/3/2015,"I truly believe the value of this hotel is based on 3 criteria.  Location, high tech and cleanliness.  Otherwise, $900 a night for this venue is quite a steep offer.  Being in the heart of Manhattan will automatically set you back $3-400 for any standard accommodations.  Everything in our room was practically controlled by some button of some remote so it was modern technology at its finest.  If you look up the definition of immaculate in the dictionary, there should be a picture of this hotel.  I have never ever seen a hotel so clean with no debris, dust, nor foul odor anywhere.  From the hallways to the elevator to the men's locker room, everything smelled fresh.  Truly a gem of an establishment but too rich for my blood if I had to pay in full.",2,1,

During my stay here, I made several requests and they fulfilled them beyond my expectations. When I asked for mandarin oranges past midnight, I was given a huge plate filled with over 20 of them (see pic!). They also provide umbrellas for rainy days and chauffeur service for close distance destination travels. The chauffeur was super friendly and this service is really great in the cold winter days. So definitely two thumbs up for Park Hyatt NY!",1,1,1
94,Sorio D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,0,5.0,7/6/2015,"In a few words : Highly professional staff in a sophisticated and modern hotel. You must experience the pool on the 24th floor: swimming among the Midtown skyscrapers is just amazing, the pool and spa are luxurious and bright. Even though the rooms have a kind of ""office style"" the hearty and generous bar will make you feel warmly welcomed. Bathrooms are stunning !  The cherry on top of the cake is the delicious food at the Back Room restaurant ; I'll keep it on top of my list !",1,,

97,Savanna T.,"Newton Centre, MA",0,54,11,1.0,12/26/2015,"This was literally the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I'll start by listing the pros:1. The room was really nice and very clean2. The staff was nice and most of the managers were friendly and offered their help. Cons:1. The food. Where do I start. every single meal we had here had some kind of an issue. We once had to order three of the same dish (eggs Benedict) because the first time the eggs were overlooked to the point of being hard boiled, the second time because there was no hollandaise sauce, and the third time because there was no Canadian bacon. We also received salads without dressing, a panini that was so soggy it fell apart in my hands, undercooked pancakes, unevenly cooked pork, and other various issues. We were promised that these issues would be addressed, however those promises were empty. Nothing was done even though we were told it would be.2. The housekeeping issues. First of all, the food in the cabinets given to us by the hotel had been expired since November (it's nearly January now) and I feel really uncomfortable about this because it makes me feel like the proper measures to prepare the room weren't taken. Additionally, when we simply asked for towels and water bottles (nothing else) we discovered that the housekeeper was reorganizing all of our personal items on the counter. She was surprised to find that we didn't want our personal things reorganized. I was shocked. This has never happened at any previous hotels I've stayed at. I don't like people moving and handling my personal items without my knowledge so this was very off-putting.3. We temporarily left New York for the holidays and are planning to return. As we were leaving, one of the managers (Rashni) followed us out of the hotel and asked the front door staff where we were going. We then received a text from another manager wishing us a safe trip. This upset me because we had never told them we were leaving to the airport or where we were going so it's clear they were trying to get insight into whether or not we were leaving them for another hotel and where we were going, even though we had chosen not to share that information with them. 5. They charged our account MULTIPLE times throughout our stay so we spent much of our trip trying to receive credit for their mistakes.I will say that the management offered us in-person opportunities to discuss these issues, however I don't see why the meetings had to be in person in order for our complaints to be heard. We sent numerous emails texts and messages to the management explaining the issues in detail, yet they still felt as though the issues could only be resolved if we met in person. This was of course difficult because of the holidays and the fact that I work so the times when I was back at the hotel I wanted to spend celebrating with my family.",2,1,1
98,Kirsten F.,"New York, NY",31,59,0,1.0,10/25/2015,"Extremely disappointed. I'll start by noting that I have stayed at Hyatts throughout the world and I am a diamond member and have never received such poor service. Last night I visited this location for a friend's birthday get together at the bar. In the cab ride over I mentioned doing a stay-cation next month at this location to check it out - that definitely won't happen after last night's experience. My friend and her guests are sitting on couches in the bar area and when my boyfriend and I arrive we start to head to the bar to order our drinks (mainly so we could come and go as we please and not have to bother figuring out the check amongst a group at the end of the night - keep in mind I was only drinking water all night). We were abruptly told by the server assisting my friend's table, that 'we could not order from the bar if we were joining this party.' We thought that was odd but to not make a big deal we ordered with the server and specified that we wanted a separate check. My boyfriend's first order of vodka on the rocks wasn't even the size of a shot! It was a joke so he sent it back and ordered a double. We then received a full glass of vodka so clearly the pours from the bar have no rhyme or reason.  This drink adjustment request for EXPENSIVE shallow pours happened a total of two times after which we decided to leave. After waiting 25 minutes to receive our check, the bill comes with an 18% gratuity charge for a large party!!! This was a check that accounted for two drinks ordered by one person and the service was HORRIBLE! after raising a concern with our server I asked to speak with the manager. A woman came over, not sure if she actually was a manager as her performance was not impressive. She too supported that bc we joined a large party, despite lack luster service, we had to pay the 18% gratuity.  She did however agree that we should have been able to order at the bar. Yet NOTHING WAS DONE. No apology/no check adjustment. So for two double orders of vodka on the rocks my boyfriend paid $82 dollars!!! As a lifetime Manhattan resident, I have never experienced such foolishness. In short, avoid this place like the plague. There are many other gems in this city at which you'll receive stellar service at a reasonable price.",3,3,

Updated review","Park Hyatt is beautiful as expected. The room is full of great surprises. iPad, heated floors and the greatest leather case that doubles as the safe. I want one real bad.  The staff is first rate. Davon was the first person we met at the front door and we knew we were at a special place. our waiter Stamos was great. The staff made us feel at home in an environment that could easily be intimidating. They know how to give great service without the stuffiness. Great job Park Hyatt.",,,1

106,Rob L.,"Newport Coast, CA",3,9,0,1.0,3/28/2015,"As a Platinum Gold Passport member, I booked here as it's always great to try a new Park Hyatt.  This one is a MESS.  No perks for your loyalty program.  At $1k a night, I booked a 'suite' and got a one room accomodation.  Yes, it had some cool curved windows... the better not to sleep with.  Aside, from the awful attitude at check-in, and even more rude discussion with the Rooms Manager the next day, I was told they were sorry but they shouldn't have said an upgrade wasn't available.  They simply don't give them.  NOISE.. 57th and 7th.. at night.. large trucks.. dropping beams.  The rooms are average in size, the floor is stone, the bed is very hard, and there are no drawers for your clothes.  Room service is slow, overpriced, and the food arrives incorrect or cold.  You can get a swanky accomodation like this at the nearby Mandarin or Ritz Carlton without the attitude.  Unlike any of my other very favorable Park Hyatt experiences.... this one was TERRIBLE.  When you're paying over three thousand dollars for three nights, if you have the upgrade, offer it to your loyal guests!You were not nearly sold out, and it was clearly available on line.  Mr. DeLapp should be sent back to training on how to speak to a guest.  I wish so badly I moved to another Hyatt property, which they were MORE than willing to let me do.  (YES, folks I was in a suit!)",8,1,

109,Eli F.,"Monsey, NY",0,14,1,4.0,12/2/2015,"This place is just wow.  I have stayed in over 100 hotels in the past 10 years and this one tops it.  Service, comfort, its gorgeous and top of the line.  This is my 4th time staying here. Why only 4 stars?  when I called the front desk and asked for late checkout she said because of my room rate she can not give it to me.  I was staying here this time using points.  Points I earned. Just tell me you can extend my checkout don't tell me because of my room rate???   And it was my anniversary. Your going to loose a customer over this when I normally pay you over $1000 per night?  Maybe give me a crappy bed with mold because of my room rate?  I didnt expect this from a park Hyatt.  I expect much more you are not a hilton or Sheraton hotel.",,,
110,Peter H.,"New York, NY",2,17,0,4.0,1/9/2015,"I've always been a fan of the Park Hyatt hotels after staying at the Tokyo Park Hyatt last year. Fortunately, New York opened a Park Hyatt so I decided to stay here twice for my residency interviews. I was really impressed with my stay here and would definitely return. I'll try and divide this review in terms of four sections: amenities, rooms, service, and food.Service:I think what sets Park Hyatt apart from other hotels is its service. The room service staff here is super receptive to all your needs. I was exhausted from my interviews so I came home and ordered their food service. The attendant who brought my food was super nice. He noticed that I ran out of water and immediately asked if I wanted more complimentary water (bottled water in the rooms is 18 bucks so it was really nice of him to offer me water). He also brought me a bowl of fruit free of charge. I think he genuinely wanted to make the stay comfortable which is a rarity in American hotels.Another big plus is its complimentary car service. Park Hyatt outsources to a high end limo company from New Jersey who will shuttle you in S classes and SUVs within a 10 block radius of the hotel. Fortunately for me, the hospitals where I was interviewing at were all within the 10 block radius. It's also nice that these cars have wifi so you're able to get work done during the transit.Finally, they also offer shoe shine service and 2 shirt pressing services which is nice for anyone in NYC for business.Note: I would give Park Hyatt 4.5 stars but yelp doesn't allow half stars. I felt the concierge service was a bit lacking in this hotel. I say this because I tried getting reservations at Sushi Nakazawa but failed and the hotel wasn't able to either. However, I think a lot of people don't understand is that high end hotels generally have really good connections to high end restaurants and are able to get you VIP to these restaurants. For instance, at my previous stay at the Trump in Chicago, I was able to get into Aviary bar's Office on a Friday evening on last notice. Another example is that the Park Hyatt in Tokyo got me into Jiro's Sushi in Ginza (not the Roppongi location) last minute too. But, honestly, I think it'll take a couple more years before the Park Hyatt in New York is able to make these connections etc. Food:I honestly think the food is one of the pitfalls of this hotel. I'm a big sucker for room service when I stay at nice hotels so I've had my share of ordering from places like the Trump in Chicago, Langham in Pasadena etc. However, the food at Park Hyatt was below mediocre. For breakfast, I had the grade A5 kobe steak one morning and the shakshuka the following morning. You can't really screw up steak but the side dishes that were supposed to complement the steak felt really poorly prepared (namely the fried egg). The shakshuka was a bit too salty for my taste but it was honestly not that bad. I also had the chicken noodle soup which honestly tasted like heated water with a few chunks of veggies. I can't speak for the restaurants within the building itself but I wouldn't get room service here if I were to stay again. Rooms:I stayed at one of the regular sized rooms with a King bed. I was facing the Carnegie Hall so I was a bit weary whether the people in the offices opposite from me could see me through the window. The rooms are all outfitted with iPad integrated controls which allows you to get room service, wake up calls, toiletries without having to call the front desk. The beds were pretty comfy and the showers weren't bad. The showers were your typical rainforest rainfall shower heads with a normal shower head included. Each room also included a separate bathtub. Overall, I think you're not gonna be disappointed with the rooms in the Park Hyatt. The only downside is that the hotel is only up to floors 24 as the One57 residents take up the upper floors of the building. This means the majority of where you live will be facing other office buildings. My recommendation is to ask for the upper floors facing the west (towards Central Park).AmenitiesThe gym and pool were pretty standard containing what you'd expect in any hotel. I would say that the pool was a bit smaller than I imagined and it was a huge sausage fest when I was there making it not so great experience. However, I also saw a family there and the kids were having a blast. So I guess it's not bad if you have a family and wanted to take the kids upstairs to have some fun. Overall, I really liked the Park Hyatt. The people here are great and the rooms are comfortable. The food is my only complaint along with the lack/inability of the concierge to get us reservations to nicer places. But hey, it's honestly one of the best hotels in New York City right now. I think Park Hyatt has a lot of potential to be on par with their Tokyo brother. The hotel is really new so they just need some time to adjust and get more feedback on what to improve.",3,1,
111,I. P.,"Herndon, VA",1,102,0,4.0,6/29/2015,"Enjoyed our stay! Have been to NYC numerous times and stayed at many of the high end hotels including the Ritz, the Plaza, and boutique chains. Location was perfect for both shopping and relaxing strolls at the park. Staff was courteous and professional. Felt very comfortable in our spacious room. Have been displeased with hotels recently with housekeeping (cleanliness & amenities) and service but not at this Park Hyatt.  Pool, hot tub, steam room, and locker room were very nice.  Love all the windows which give the hotel an airy feel.  Hotel is quiet and reflects an element of privacy.  The only hiccup was the first morning.  We'd had a long night of travel and had turned on the privacy button to sleep in. Housekeeping kept knocking at 9 a.m. until I had to get up and tell them to return later.  Looking forward to our next visit.",,,
