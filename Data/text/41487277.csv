0,Jeff D.,"Jersey City, NJ",337,704,326,5.0,10/31/2018,"I was recently introduced to Augurs Well after visiting Proletariat - a standard stop on my NYC beer crawl. Little did I know, Augurs Well would become one of my favorite beer bars to visit and will be a regular stop on my future beer crawls. Maybe it's the fact that it's not fancy, not trying to be special and just has great beer? I don't know but I am drawn to it - both for it's tap list and the fact that not 'too' many people seem to know about it - this could also just be me coming at off-peak times. Needless to say, each time I've come here, I've been impressed with the tap list and don't generally want to leave. Much like being up at the poker table, I will eventually just have to walk away (I may have less $ after leaving here but I am richer...in beer!) Although I haven't tried their food and missed their anniversary party recently (their list was stupid looking...and I mean stupid in a good way), I can't help but give them the highest honor possible. Be sure to pay them a visit if you're in the area or simply go out of your way to come here. It will be worth it.",4,2,5

Updated review","Heard there is trivia this upcoming Monday, August 13th!!!! I am so excited to go!I come here about once a week.  AMAZING sliders, beer, and bartenders.  It is always a great time.  Though I do miss the blonde bartender, as she was very sweet and knowledgeable.  This is the best place to bring out of town friends and family for a true New York feel.",,,1
2,Sama C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",541,145,230,5.0,9/9/2018,"Nice bar with an open concept to the street. I had the old fashioned, and I was happy with the way it was made.",,,2
3,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,827,9215,5.0,3/17/2018,"One of the best places in the East Village to have a local craft beer, if you're looking for a knowledgeable and fun bar staff, low-key atmosphere, and unpretentious clientele.A bar with a television and a few eclectic tables, including one larger communal one, fill the wood-lined room.  The draft beer and food menus are on chalk boards by the bar, the bottled beer list above the communal table. The draft list rotates 16 brews most frequently tapped from terrific New York City and regional breweries, the likes of Grimm, Finback, LIC, KCBC, Other Half, Hudson Valley, and many more.  A few will be from interesting breweries elsewhere around the country.  A long bottled and canned list expands on the domestics, plus some international. Other than beer, the bartenders can mix cocktails on demand or serve up a whiskey or other good liquor.  Wines are limited, although there will be something by the glass.  The food menu has burgers, fries, and sandwiches, but I've not tried it, coming here most often pre or post dinner just for a beer. Augurs Wells is a bar whose laid back look (call it upscale dive) belies its quality beer offerings.  Prices are commensurate, and clientele are not here looking for a deal.  Generally uncrowded and relaxing to have a drink here.",1,,1

It's the cutest neighborhood bar with an amazing selection of beer on draft, and an awesome bartender (Max) that was really helpful in selecting beers to try. It's laid back and casual, and they have several regulars that rave about the place. If you're in the neighborhood, it's absolutely worth stopping by!",1,,
7,Dylan K.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,346,31,2.0,9/19/2017,"Fantastic beer list, but prices are beyond outrageous. I don't care how good the beer is, paying $10-12 for a 12oz beer is completely unacceptable. Our bill for 3 beers w/ tip was $37. Jesus H. Christ.For the prices alone, they will not get more than 2 stars. In my neighborhood (or any in Brooklyn), you may be looking at $8-9 for a Singlecut or Finback beer. $11 for a Grimm sour? Come on.

It has a very dim setting with funky decor.My friend and I sat at the bar for a few beers. Our bartender, Brian, was super friendly and helped us with beer selections. I got the ""Grimm in mid air"" beer which had an interesting, but not too bitter taste. There was also a live performance which definitely added to the tone of this place. I'll definitely love to return here next time I'm in the area!",,,

14,Alex B.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,43,6,2.0,11/11/2017,A well-designed craft beer spot with repurposed wood everywhere. They had many beers on tap and there's a nice ambience inside. The bartender was friendly but he also had his dinner brought out from the kitchen and ate it (plate actually sitting on top of the bar) while working. I normally wouldn't mind this but he kept eating and not washing his hands as he was pouring and making drinks for people.,,,
15,Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",245,5,0,5.0,10/8/2017,"Love this bar!  They constantly feature local brews...Other Half, Threes, Finback,Interboro, Six Point, Peekskill!  That's forgetting the stuff from all around the country that comes through this place.  Met the owner (Greg) recently.  He was Informed, accommodating, and pleasant.  His father happened to walk in while we were chatting and I found myself in a family debate about local beer.  #charactersThe bathroom in the back was clean, with classic, New York movie posters, and a white picket fence motif.  Food was killer!  Sliders, burgers, onion rings, and FRIES!  Thanks guys!P.s. less Mets and Rangers.

17,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,4.0,8/7/2016,"Augurs Well is a nice place to go in the East Village if you are in the mood for a simple, handcrafted cocktail, a decent draft, and/or a bit to eat.Early yesterday evening, a couple of friends and I came by for a cocktail.

19,Dana J.,"Minnetonka, MN",0,2,0,1.0,6/15/2018,Went in under the premise it was a friendly neighborhood bar and had judgmental and rude service. Ordered a vodka soda that was $19 and very weak. Very disappointed with the service and drinks. Would not recommend.,,,
20,Sam E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",197,2,0,5.0,1/24/2018,A little gem on St. Marks. They have a fantastic selection of craft beer and are a great alternative to Proletariate down the street. The food is some of the best on the block with a great selection of burgers and other bar food. A great place to come get a beer and escape the usual craziness of a New York weekend.,,,
21,Stephen S.,"New York, NY",69,17,1,5.0,2/1/2017,"This is the absolute best bar in New York City. There are probably 18 million bars in the city that make the same claim, but with Augurs Well it's really true. It's a small-but-not-too-small bar on the fringes of the east village where the craft beer menu changes every week. If you're a regular, the bartender (Greg, who also owns the place) remembers what types of beer you like and will recommend choices from the new menu. He remembers everyone who walks in and what they like. ""Talent"" doesn't describe what this guy does; he is genuinely interested in his customers and he remembers their likes and dislikes because he cares about them. It happens as well that he is one of the nicest guys in New York, always ready to offer his thoughts and listen to yours on whatever topics may be of interest to you.For what it's worth, he also built the bar from scratch. When you walk in, the beautiful wooden tables, the ceiling, the walls, the bar itself and the shelves behind it, were all salvaged and built and sanded and polished by Greg, and he did a remarkable job of making the place look beautiful. In fact, he did such a good job that his bar was featured in Architectural Digest as one of the best bars in the city. Stepping inside Augurs Well feels, in so many ways, like stepping out of time. Sitting in there, enjoying a beer, you could easily believe that you are sitting back in New York in the 1950s -- except for the music selection, which is curated by Greg from his iPod and is relatively modern and top-notch. In case it's not clear, my wife and I both love Greg. We invited him to our wedding, in fact -- and he was gracious enough to take the time off from work to actually come, all the way out to New Jersey, which was really touching for both of us. He's a really good guy, a good friend, and he really, really knows his beer. It has gotten to the point where we don't even choose our beers ourselves -- instead, he just chooses drinks for us that he knows we will like. He has never yet been wrong. The craft beer selection is wonderful, and, as I mentioned, it changes weekly. But the bar also recently received its liquor license, and Augurs Well has a wonderful selection of spirits to choose from, and the bartenders know how to make just about anything you could want. They are truly great. The regulars are another highlight of this bar. One of them once referred to it as ""our 'Cheers',"" and I think that's so apt. Go here often enough, and you will build a circle of friends who you may only see at this bar, but who greet you with a smile every time you come in. You will find yourself discussing everything from politics to the latest episode of the Bachelor with these folks. For some reason, Augurs Well attracts some of the best and most interesting people in NYC. Talking to the other regulars is always a pleasure. I would be remiss if I didn't say something about the food. If you know the east village, you know that a lot of people choose to go to Mark Burger to satisfy their cravings for sliders. This is a mistake. Augurs Well has the best sliders in the east village, period, and perhaps the best sliders in the entire city. They are thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Order them just once and you will never feel like eating at Mark Burger again, I promise. Other delicious options which we have tried include the tater tots (with an excellent dipping sauce); the garlic parm fries; and, from the ""secret menu,"" the garlic parm tater tots with ranch dipping sauce. Everything here is great and I cannot recommend it highly enough.If you haven't been to Augurs Well - go! If you have been, keep going! My wife and I will see you again soon!",7,,
22,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",203,238,1439,4.0,9/12/2016,"Solid bar, with a deep beer list. My rum and coke was a bit weak, with ice machine ice, so not the most sophisticated drink, but not as good as other run and cokes I've had in my alcoholic lifetime. Nice ambiance, in a cozy setting. A Mets, Rangers and Knicks fan bar, so expect to see one of the teams on the TV if you stop in.",,,
23,Lindsay R.,"Eastland, TX",95,4,0,5.0,11/13/2017,Great bar! Went on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded. Bartender was very friendly and the beers were delicious. Reasonably priced as well. Clean spot with great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend.,,,

I asked him for a blonde beer & vodka cranberry..he gave me a 1.5 count of vodka & all cranberry & the wrong beer. I'm a bartender..I'm all about service. He had to be the WORST.

I came here the other night with my gal pal after getting really hammered at a wine bar nearby (still wondering till this day how that happened...I attribute it to the absence of real food in my stomach for 6+ hours before sangria-ing ensued) and ordered their 3 cheese sliders deal for (an outstanding!! $5!!! ONLY $5!!!) and an order of garlic parmesan fries to split with my friend.About a few minutes after ordering I did something along the lines of declare myself as being sick and I immediately hopped into a cab leaving my friend with my purse and some delicious food. I mean ridiculously delicious looking food which she later said was delicious so clearly I was left hungover, hungry, sad and poor.I am genuinely going to make it a point to come back here before June is over because this place looks awesome, sells awesome food, awesome beer and the bartender was a doll for making sure my credit card (since I unknowingly and apparently started a tab -__-) was returned to my friend.

Chef Marteen knows what he's doing. Easily the best  sliders in New York City and they just started offering loaded chicken nachos (it's worth the trip for the nachos alone).

They have a nice mix of middle-of-the-road and high-end brews (Founders Breakfast Stout was on tap). THey were also nice about charging our phones for us.The only knock against them is that it was a bit cold inside. The place is small and did not seem prepared to weather the recent 15-degree frost-pocalyse, so if you're sensitive to winter temps, keep that in mind.

Bar staff who are generous with tastes of different beers to let you decide. Relaxed atmosphere to have a chat with friends, and/or the bartender. Great beer selection, conscientiously chosen and cared for (clean tap lines).Also, the sliders are pretty perfect, juicy and flavorful. To be honest, I would fangirl about the sliders alone. Love this place",,,
60,John K.,"Manhattan, NY",265,355,567,2.0,5/25/2012,"I like the venue(how it looks), but I think there's a reason it was kind of empty and BUA across the street was packed! (This was around 7pm on a Fri night mind you)I feel kind of bad giving this place a 2, because the waitress was so friendly :D and did such good service, butI ordered the ""1 Percenter""yelp.com/biz_photos/vKKq…yelp.com/biz_photos/vKKq…yelp.com/biz_photos/vKKq…I ordered it medium well, and it came back well. I didn't say anything. Maybe I should have..From the most expensive burger on the menu, I was expecting a really good burger, but I think I would have been better off ordering a plain cheeseburger. The burger was dry, and average at best. I couldn't even taste the ""black truffle cheese."" And it wasn't particularly juicy, or tasty. :/yelp.com/biz_photos/vKKq…yelp.com/biz_photos/vKKq…The garlic parmesan fries were good.Overall, the burger w/ fries ($13.75) and a diet coke, it came out to $18.25 ($1.50 tax; diet soda was $3) Which, was a suprise to me- didn't think of the tax. DEFINITELY not worth a $22 meal(what it came out to when I added tip) for one! :(",,,

We have been here a few times, and both times we had a good time, just chilling, people watching, listening to their jam, and have a good brew in the warm summer day. Since, we have only been here before prime time (usually in the afternoon/evening of Saturdays), I don't know what this place is like at it's prime time.",,,

65,Jen M.,"New York, NY",9,83,2,5.0,12/2/2012,"This place is fantastic! It's a great hangout in the Lower East Side to catch up with people over a few drinks. Perfect, cozy ambiance with brick walls, wooden benches, dim lighting, and a good background music playlist.There are over a dozen beers on tap -- a lot to choose from. They have lots of wine choices as well. The bartenders are super friendly and attentive -- how often do you find that on the Lower East Side?If you are in the mood for a bite to eat, they have... well, you guessed it... burgers! I recommend the Holy Guacomole and garlic parm fries. YUM! I'm drooling just thinking about it. But if you aren't in the mood to eat, this is a great bar on St. Mark's Place. It won't put a hole in your pocket either.I know it's hard to choose a bar when you are in this area because there are so many, but stop in, I don't think you'll be disappointed! 5 stars!",2,,

67,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10947,4.0,6/6/2013,"This seems to be brand new. Though, upon more discovery and observation this used to be named Burger Shop and still serves up a number of the same things under a different name. I've never been to Burger Shop though, so I can't judge the discrepancies. My inebriated friend and I stumbled upon this last night after two unnecessary pitchers of Sangria. I wasn't even in the mood for drinking and was initially going to go to the gym so I have no idea how this entire night transpired. Anyway, the list of beers is pretty decent. You get a free slider with any draft. Also, they have a 3 sliders for $5 special all night. Which we were gonna do and split an order of their delicious garlic parmesan fries. Were sitting at the bar all smilies, waiting for our mini burgers and my friend turns to me and says ""I'm gonna be sick!"" and runs out the door. She left me with her purse though and I sat there with 6 mini burgers and wonderful wedge cut frites. The burgers were really really good. Really really good. I didn't eat all of them, though, it was certainly tempting. The fries were pretty spot on as well. I would definitely come back again because other bars near st. marks have been slacking. Wonderful addition.",,,

Beers on tap rotate frequently and always impress with beers like Hill Farmstead and Maine Beer Co to nanobreweries you've never heard of, impressing even the most avid beer geeks. Get the right bartender and he'll happily geek out with you over that microbatch black double IPA. Grab a hot dog next door at Crif Dogs after for a post-beer pairing.",,,

I came with a bunch of friends, and we got several pitchers, but unfortunately one of the taps must have been bad because there was something off about the beer. The bartenders were very accommodating though and gave us a different beer instead, so I wont hold it against them. it could happen to anyone.As a beer lover, I was very, very happy with the selection and prices here.As for food, they only have burgers and fries and stuff like that--very simple. My friend had a burger and said it was good. I had some garlic french fries and they were really delicious! very flavorful and crispy.The decor is pretty cool also, very beachy and some 1950s pinup posters on the wall.The place was pretty empty on a saturday night compared to the bars next door, but i think people will come around when they get tired of squeezing like sardines in other places.

Agreed, it's sometimes cold in there.  I think they actually do have a happy hour though because they still had a sign up from it, so that's worth checking out. Good parmesan garlic fries! But they should hire an additional bartender, sometimes it gets too busy ..",,,
