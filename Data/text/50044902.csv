Hogshead is a small (but not crowded) bar with 20 craft beers on tap. At midnight, the bar was still lively with a real community feel. My boyfriend and I came in and were immediately greeted by the bartender, who let us try as many of the beers as our hearts desired. They have a little something for everyone, even the bud light fanatics [my boyfriend]. There were three different tvs in various corners of the bar, all playing a sports channel. Their kitchen closes at 3 am and the bar itself closes at 4 am. Their food menu looked amazing, most of it was on theme with the name of the bar. We had the pretzel with beer cheese, also excellent. The beer cheese was cold so it kind of threw me off but the chef said the consistency was best cold. The real winner of the night was the Piggyback shot- house whiskey + au jus sauce. I know it sounds insane but it was amazing!! You chase the whiskey with the au jus and you just feel warm and fuzzy in all the right places. If/when I ever come back, it's going to be for this au jus sauce.",4,,1

First thing to note if this is really more of a place to come for drinks and more of a snack, not an actual meal with drinks. And if you haven't guessed from the name not at all vegetarian/vegan friendly.Myself and 2 friends stopped in on a Thursday night and it wasn't very crowded when we got there around 8 but for some reason it took the bartender for every to acknowledge us, when he finally did my friend had went to the restroom so we said please check back in a couple minutes and it took another 20. We ordered and it took the food 30+ minutes to come out. Later on it got busy and it just went downhill from there We ordered a pizza to go later on for another friend and that one pizza took 50 minutes. We were never asked if we wanted another round of drinks. Also know if it's busy you wont be able to hear yourself think let alone hear the person you're trying to talk to.The food itself was good however at one point one of the staff brought a small dog out of the kitchen and sorry that's just not okay for me. Again, this may have been an off night based on others reviews but I just can't see myself going back when there are so many other delicious options around.",2,2,2

A small and charming little neighborhood bar with a simple and creative menu and great drinks!  P.J., the waiter, is wonderful and it was a pleasure waiting for the kitchen to open with him serving up the drinks!Definitely a trendy spot geared towards the new residents of Harlem but I'll take it! I don't even eat pork but the place is so cute and cozy, I'll bring my friends and keep trying to get them to put fries on the menu to give me another reason to visit often!I highly recommend you give this place a try!",,,1

Updated review","I still really like this place.  They continue to have a great selection of cider on tap and the bartenders really know their draughts.  Plus, the service is friendly.But I'm bummed that they recently removed the chicken meatballs from the menu.  I know that establishments have to change their menus occasionally to keep things fresh and interesting, but I cannot eat the replacement food options of pizza because I'm gluten free, nightshade free, and generally dairy free.  I realize I'm in a tiny minority, but because of that, food options are frequently the difference when choosing to go to one place or another.My friend and I came here the other day specifically looking forward to the meatballs.  Okay - sounds corny and all, but they were really good, and now I have one less of the already minimal options available to have as a bite.Unfortunately, it will make me consider going to other places when I'd rather come here.",1,,
4,Jamil M.,"New York, NY",741,239,861,4.0,1/27/2018,"I love this neighborhood bar nestled away in the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill Area. Disclaimer: Not a place to eat in your a Vegetarian or Vegan;  Almost everything contains pork. But if your mostly a carnivore like myself, then you'd enjoy what this place has to offer.A pretty wide variety of tasty items on the menu and rather large lists of draft beers. I mostly come here for brunch and get the pork wings with apple coleslaw-- yummy! And I like to wash it down with the bacon infused Vodka Bloody Mary. They also have bottomless Mimosas and Bellinis for $18 that last 1.5 hours.The environment is rather intimate, not real noisy for brunch at least and the space quite nicely laid out. The bar tending and waiting staff are super friendly even when it can get hectic with orders. But they do there best to make everyone happy.",2,,

My friends and I shared, pigs in a blanket, the chipotle pizza, the beer cheese with garlic crostini and the pig and dip. Everything was very delicious! We also did a few rounds of piggyback shots which is a whiskey shot followed by a shot of warm au jus, sounds weird but it was awesome. We will definitely be back again.",,,
6,Lindy E.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",9,38,5,5.0,10/20/2018,Amazing service. Went there for a 2 hour wedding celebration. The bartenders know all about their beers and they kept the food area filled and looking neat. Food was delicious. Fantastic selection of ciders. Definitely would recommend for a small event (60 people or less) or just to check out for drinks or weekend brunch.,,,

8,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,5.0,2/9/2018,"Amazing to see a craft beer spot like this in Hamilton heights.  Hogshead tavern is an ideal location for those looking for that trendy craft beer feel.  The environment is rather intimate, not real noisy and nicely laid out.If you're a carnivore (like myself) then this place is for you since just about everything on their menu contains pork. The food menu has a unique variety of items, but my favorite dish is their Beer Cheese.  I'm a big craft beer person so I really enjoy their rotating selection of beers.  My favorite experience here was when they had my favorite beer in the world which is Heady Topper and they even had Focal Banger.... I felt so spoiled that day!!!  The staff is super friendly and attentive.  The vibe here is chill with an intimate setting which I really enjoy at times.  The neighborhood is lucky to have a small craft beer bar like this as it brings a way different environment than your usual sports bar or lounge. Hogshead closes every day at 4am and the kitchen stays open till about 2am.",2,1,1
9,Sarah h.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,30,1,2.0,2/5/2018,"What a disappointing experience. Friend and I went for dinner on Super Bowl Sunday. We were not there for the game, but there were a number of seats so we stayed to eat despite. I originally ordered a beer and an appetizer. When the drinks were brought, we then ordered some main dishes. Over an hour later, after asking about the status of the appetizer twice, we were told there was only one person in the kitchen and things were backed up. Finally, over 90 minutes after ordering the first course, and nearly 30 minutes after the manager coming to tell us it ""would be right out"" ALL dishes appeared... BURNT. We were served 2 beers in 2 hours (only because no one asked if we wanted another), and mediocre food.The saving grace of 2 stars is that the waiter recognized our displeasure and took the food ordered off the bill. You should not advertise for people to come to your establishment for the biggest football game of the year when you have 1 waiter, one cook, and 2 bartenders. I had high hopes for this neighborhood spot... sad to have been so disappointed.",2,1,
10,Oscar A.,"Miami, FL",45,146,101,5.0,3/23/2018,I just love these hole in the wall joints with a great ambiance and atmosphere. The food is awesome. Had the Crispy pork belly grilled cheese sandwich and the kale dip which is to die for. Also had some locally made hard cider which had the right amount of sweetness to it. Overall I enjoyed the place.,,,
11,Erin D.,"New York, NY",0,37,0,4.0,10/27/2018,"Best beer selection in the area. My complaint previously was that the beer prices were too high but I went in recently and saw they have adjusted that, with almost all the drafts at $8. They have beer flights, the pig & dip sandwich is great, other food is good too. It gets busy enough but not too packed, always been able to find a seat. Good place for cooler weather in particular - now that the prices are right I'll be back this fall and winter.",,,
12,Brittany N.,"New York, NY",18,80,100,3.0,6/15/2018,"Came here on a random weekend for brunch and it was surprisingly empty. I got the French roast with a side of pork belly. I assumed the pork would be their special because if the name and every dish had pork in it so I was willing to get the side. Instead of thick, juicy and fatty pork belly (which I was expecting. Maybe I was expecting wrong) it was sliced thin like bacon and fried to a crisp which made it lose a lot of flavor and just was crunchy with little taste. Portions are pretty average, I definitely could of eaten more. I would try and come here for dinner just to see what else there is",,,
13,Jordan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,5.0,10/20/2018,"The service and hospitality here can't be beat!! The selection of beer and cider is exceptional. The staff can tell you all about each option.

But since yelp revealed this spot has an average rating of 4.5 stars, we decided to stay and see what all the hype was about. (#inYelpITrust)Glad we did. Wait staff were fun, very attentive, hyped up their unlimited 1.5 hour boozy brunch and after a few food recommendations everything was history. We stuck with bellinis (d ont judge me), glasses were refilled quickly, every pour was strong, felt this brunch's goal was to get my lit: and it did.Food was bomb: I got the grilled cheese pork dish (mouthwatering), and my friend got something non-pork related (which was also really good). The place itself started filling up with patrons, music in the background was a mix of top 40-enjoyable: all recipes for a dope low key, laid back brunch experience. I will be back.",,1,
15,Thierry S.,"New York, NY",2,66,46,4.0,5/1/2018,"This bar in Hamilton Heights has a great selection of craft beer and snacks and friendly staff. On our first attempt on a Friday night at 8pm the place was packed so we decided to come back earlier another day. My wife and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.

My last time there I had a really good harvest cider and also a good porter. I believe it was orange pistachio. The food selection is good, but limited. Very pork heavy. They dont have a fryer so no fries which would have cost them half a star. However, yelps system only allows full stars so I rounded up. Overall if you are close and don't need a fancy meal this is an awesome spot. If you live good beer then its a mist visit in the neighborhood.",1,,1

So I totally understand when I walk in your door that the staff might roll their eyes at us, because we change the vibe of the place, but we had nothing but the best customer service and highest quality of food from Hogshead Tavern. In my heart of hearts I want to keep this brunch option in Harlem a hidden gem, but because the staff are as awesome as their food, I feel that I must share. Five stars for french toast, the grilled cheese with crisp porkbelly, pulled pork breakfast tacos. 6 stars to our lovely server. They kindly accommodated my daughter's request for an extra side of pickles because, truly they are awesome. We will be back, and would be willing to stand in line. ;)",,,
30,Yanill P.,"Manhattan, NY",579,353,1281,4.0,1/6/2016,"I typically tend to lean toward places that are under the radar. I'm not a big fan of super popular overcrowded venues. Hogsheads Tavern was great for that reason and more. I find it interesting to find places like this in unexpected neighborhoods. Most recently, Harlem has had lots of these cool bars pop up. I visited a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night. The walk there is a bit desolate. However, once inside I was very please. The place is cute, trendy and has character. I didn't try the food but they have a fabulous cocktail list. I tried the ""Boozy Sow"" ($11) and boy was it boozy! Just one or two of those is enough (you'll get your money's worth). The bartenders were sweet and the place was very relaxed and dimly lit. I would definitely visit again. I hear they have a good brunch so might check that out. Cool place.

33,Shawn C.,"West Bronx, NY",0,1,0,2.0,1/28/2018,"This place is ok. The menu is fine (but small as this is a small place with a small kitchen). Beer selection is ok (for uptown I suppose). However I always have service issues here. More at the bar than at tables. The servers and table service has been good. But at the bar... For example as I am typing this I am here on a Sunday afternoon having a couple of beers. The poor bartender is here by himself with no server. I get it. It went from 5 people to 20 pretty quick. However I was here before a lot of these people arrived. And yet everyone gets served and cashed out before I can even get a second beer. It's not like he is ignoring the bar and concentrating on tables or vice versa. People who arrived after me are getting preferential treatment. This happened before and I thought it was a specific worker. However it now appears this is systemic. Perhaps if I were with a group of non people of color I would get better service?It sucks seeing a specific beer on beermenus and then saying ""Oh, it's at Hogshead"" and dismissing it out of hand. This could be a nice spot but I think the only way to fix this is new ownership.",,,1

I live down the street from Bierstrasse, but their service is trash, a problem that Hogshead does not have! We've been here a few times for drinks, and also swung by for New Years. Recently, we came for brunch. The food was yummy (I got the breakfast tacos and my fiance got the open faced sandwich), and it was clear the ingredients were high quality. My only gripe is the portions are a little small. If you come for brunch, get one of their bloody Mary's. They are pretty, flavorful, and strong. The service has always been swift and attentive, which I so appreciate.",,,

We were the first to arrive just before 5 p.m. and enjoyed undivided attention from the bartender for just a few minutes before the crowds arrived. The happy hour only includes one kind of beer for $5 or a wine of the day. Luckily the happy hour beer was a good lager for me. I would have liked to try the sampler, 4 tastes of beers so I could taste some of the interesting ciders like pumpkin and pear, but the beer was so good I decided not to change it up on this visit. Even after the place got busy, the bartender stayed on top of everything and everyone like we were the only customers in the place. She was super friendly, knowledgeable, and the excellent service alone left us wanting to go back to Hogshead again. The menu looked nice, obviously lots of pig choices like pork belly, with some kale choices to offer the opposite end of the food spectrum, but unfortunately we did not get around to trying the food. Loved the vibe at Hogshead Tavern and I would definitely recommend stopping in for a beer or a glass of wine, interestingly enough also served on tap.",2,1,2

The sliders were also pretty decent. It wasn't crowded or loud for a Saturday night so the waitress was attentive, but the kitchen was unbearably slow for 8pm with only a few people in the place.

The bartenders are great, servers are actually really fun and like to chat and joke around with you (Cameron is the best!). The pork belly grilled cheese is insanely good. The Piggy Back shots (whiskey with an au jus chaser) is highly addictive, definitely give it a shot if you come here.Lastly, they have the BEST music selection. Always something really cool playing.",,,

I came once with what ended being a group of nine and we were comfortable at the center table. It never got crazy crowded so it was easy to talk. We shared the pretzel, the ribs (which they call pig wings), the pigs in a blanket and the sliders. Everything was so tasty and service was pretty fast. The beer selection was also great. The second time me and a friend came because we had liked it so much the week earlier. I tried one of the flatbread pizzas and it was insanely good. The pork belly was crisp and cooked to perfection and jalapeños gave it a memorable kick. The beers were already different from just a week earlier and we loved everything we tried (Stone I'm Peach Double IPA and Troegs Crimson Pistil -- great summertime selections at this place!). The service was very attentive and friendly and it was 95 degree day and they really had the AC on blast which was much appreciated.",,,

Beautiful lights and tiles, kind of an industrial vibe. We were just two people on a weeknight, but this would also be a great place to bring a larger group. The food is mostly pork, in magnificent varieties. Probably don't bring your vegetarian friend here as the oohing and ahhhing over the beautiful pork won't stop. They could have the kale salad or white bean dip! We had the pork and dip sandwich and the pork sliders, both were seriously mouthwatering and full of flavor!! The portion size was perfect and overall all very reasonably priced. Can't wait to come back! Seems like a lovely place to take your time.UPDATE - The grilled cheese was very very crunchy. I'll stick with the pork and dip next time :)",1,,
63,Thomas Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,2,0,3.0,4/1/2017,"I have been going to Hogshead since its opening. The food has always been great along with the decor and ambience. However I feel the beer selection is very basic and lacking. There are some cool cans and bottles available but the tap selection leaves a lot to be desired. More local craft beers would be nice. I do not choose to go there to drink beer now because everytime I check the menu it is the same uninspired selections. I used to commonly find Grimm but I have not seen it on tap lately. Hogshead would get my business back if they started supporting local breweries more like Other Half, Finback, LIC Beer Project, Singlecut, KCBC, Carton, Barrier, Sand City and Interboro. I can go anywhere and drink Bells, Victory and Stone, boring...Please do it, the neighborhood completely lacks a quality craft beer bar.",1,,

I wish more people from the surrounding blocks went here cause the drinks are reasonably priced and the staff is super friendly to all, including LGBT folks and Spanish speaking customers.",,,
65,Nate C.,"Manhattan, NY",12,211,7,5.0,4/20/2017,"Was pumped to find the Hogshead, but was even more pumped to get lost in their food/drinks. Beer list was solid and having it displayed on TVs is great. As a millennial I love that kind of stuff. The food menu is more of a small-bites type of deal. So for 2 people choosing 3 items should leave you right on the verge of too full. You have to get the pig & dip - the bartender said it's the best sandwich in the neighborhood and I will not argue with that. Super tender meat, melty cheese, lightly toasted bread, Delish dip. The grilled chee was also excellent. Had everything I expected in a grilled cheese, that being cheese and bread. The buff chick meatballs were good, but I would prefer them to be larger. I like big buffalo chicken balls and I cannot lie. On to the drinks. Being that it was our first time there, the bartender (did I mention he was awesome) bought us shots! Now I've been skeptical of whiskey ever since an incident back in 2012, but he gave us the well whiskey chased with Au- Jus. This is called a, ""Piggyback"" I believe? First of all the well whiskey tasted fine, secondly chasing it with the jus was sublime. It annihilated any burning of lingering whiskey flavor. I'm not done yet folks, as I looked through the menu I noticed they have an insanely good bottomless brunch special and if the food for brunch is half as good as it is on the small plates you can count me in. Last thing the kitchen is open until 3am! THREE in the morning!! Forgot to add: the playlist here was FIRE. Anyone who plays any 90's Outkast is good in my book",,,

Then some weird decision was made to go... and I ended up going back there three times in one week!The place is cute with its black tiles, cool lighting, everything on tap, etc. It's a bit warm at times, though. The bartenders are great, chill without being pretentious, and can serve up a nice dirty martini.The food is what I appreciated the most; A small menu with great items. They make their own pork belly here so it makes sense that it makes an appearance in various items on the menu (food to drink). Yum!",,,

Updated review","This is an overdue update. Since the sound panels have been added, the place is much better. It's still loud during busy hours of course but the sharp shrill is gone. Also the brunch is underrated. Their french toast is the best I've had - custardy inside and crispy outside.",,,
69,Kelly L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",29,26,23,5.0,4/1/2015,"Went for some pre-dinner drinks with a group of five on Saturday late afternoon/early evening. There were plenty of what looked like locals but it wasn't packed, so and you could still socialize and hear the good selection of music over the chatter. The atmosphere was very chill, great décor inside and out, bartender and waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable. Actually the main reason we went was my friends from Portland heard (via a site or something) that Hogsheads stocked some beer from their hometown. I am definitely  not a beer connoisseur, but my friends who care for the stuff enjoyed the variety offered here.Absolutely no complaints, it was a great experience and I'm looking forward to going back soon.",1,,1
70,Mark E.,"New York, NY",102,20,12,3.0,6/13/2016,"I love the decor of this pocket-sized pub, and the laid-back efficiency of its staff does a lot to make this feel like a cozy home away from home where locals and others can go to restore body and soul.My girlfriend and I came here for brunch, so if it's not Sunday between noon and 4, read someone else.The Bellini tastes good - simple, crisp, and tangy. She had the pork wings, which arrived tender and juicy, although not so spicy as we could have wished. Great portions, by the way. You won't leave hungry. I had the pork belly frittata, which nicely balanced the rich, flavor pork with the almost light, fluffy eggs. I found it simple yet hearty. The IPA we tried proved disappointing for a couple of reasons, the first grievous knee being that they served us a bad pour; way too foamy and to much head. It took ten minutes for the head to dissipate, and the beer itself left us with a flat, sharp taste.Overall, I think this place served as a neighborhood plus, and probably does better for the lunch and dinner crowds than for brunch. I will say I'm in no hurry to return, but I could be convinced.",,,

72,Shayla G.,"New York, NY",384,150,5,4.0,12/3/2015,"This place would be a 5 star if they had better service. Not entirely sure whether or not they always have so few servers, but I only saw 2 last night and the place was pretty full. It took forever to order, although once we did we we got our food and drinks quickly. Now that parts out of the way let me talk about why I love this place. Aside from it being fairly close to my apartment, it's also nice and tucked away on Hamilton Pl. away from the main drags of Amsterdam and Broadway. It's quite and cute and kinda makes you feel like you're in a movie. It definitely feels very different than a lot of the spots frequented by the young and upwardly mobile in the neighborhood. The beer list is great, not huge but they've got some all stars currently, including Boulevard Tank 7, one of my faves. It changes pretty regularly from what I was told, but I'm sure by the look of things the lists are always solid. The food was fantastic, a friend and I split the sliders with cheese, and the pork belly grilled cheese. I could have eaten both by my self, not because they were tiny but because they were so freaking delicious and after they were gone I was kind of sad. It's definitely not the cheapest since none of the serving sizes are full meals, but it's definitely not expensive. We got 2 beers and 2 apps for 46 dollars even, so you can definitely spend a lot of money if you have a big appetite or are looking to drink a lot. I'll definitely be back because once snow falls my travel radius for non-work activities will be great reduced. Plus those sliders are dank and they have great music.",1,1,1

We ordered the sliders, pulled pork sandwich, pig wings, pork belly grilled cheese, and korean short rib tacos. I went with 3 other people and we each had a different favorite. We all agree the pig wings were the most ""normal"" although still really tender and tasty. The sliders were juicy (we made sure to order them medium rare), and the slaw and sauce on the tacos was sooo good. The pork belly was amazingly crispy, possibly the best I've had. Our server, Meghan was really nice and attentive. Very nice decor, perfect for a date or an evening with friends. I'll definitely be back!",5,2,2

The pork was cooked perfectly and practically fell off the bone.  The bbq sauce and slaw that came with it were delicious additions. If you like cheese, the kale and artichoke dip is for you. It was so creamy, cheesy, and delectable. I wanted to lick the bowl out when it was finished. The drink menu is good and they can make you anything off menu.

Updated review","Came back to Hogshead for brunch a few weeks ago and it was great. There weren't many people there which was nice. I had the steak and eggs sliders and others in my group had the French toast and BBQ wings. Everyone really enjoyed their meals, and the service was good. The server was very friendly and pretty cognizant of us but wasn't on top of us which is refreshing. I also enjoyed the music that was being played during our sitting and have heard that the Sunday LGBT nights have been a bit better since the last time I went.",,,
83,Leslie H.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,5.0,4/26/2016,I have to be honest with you.  I feel cheated.  I just discovered this place on Sunday and I could have been eating here for an entire year!   I guess I should be thankful it's still an unknown gem because I was able to get a table immediately. I had the Chipotle BQ Pigs Wings and they were delicious.  Pigs really can fly!  The Bloody Mary's Prize Hog was probably the best Bloody Mary that I ever had.  I'm not a big drinker - but this might convert me. Cheers! The only downside (and I'm still not taking away any stars) is that they have no dessert.  They have an amazing bakery right next door - you think that someone could work out a deal with them.  I'm going back tonight. You should be jealous!,,,

Great beer selection -however I only give 3 stars because the food is not great and does not live up to the otherwise great beer and comfortable fun space. I saw wings on the menu and assumed they were chicken wings. Turned out that they were pig wings. Pigs are not flying yet. Why call them wings? Pigs don't have wings. It was a shock and they were big short rib bones and a little off putting.The sliders and sprouts are reasonable but overall, the food her is ""meh"" and the selection very limited. It would be great to go there for dinner or gastro bar style dining -but that's not an option at present in the same way it is at other neighborhood bars.

88,Yvonne P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,39,22,4.0,7/10/2015,"First the name. Totally called to my inner Harry Potter fan and sold me. Came here on a weekday evening to catch up with a good friend. We both loved the modern, clean feel of the atmosphere. There were plenty of seats and stayed relatively empty except for a couple of groups and some locals, and quiet the entire two hours we were there. The one bar tender was very nice, but, considering how empty it was, took a bit too long taking our order. No big deal to us but with other reviews mentioning under staffing, it makes me hesitant to venture in here on a weekend.The menu had a fun clearly pork inspired theme, without pork being your only dining option. The prices were decent, about $10 per appetizer.  We had the pig wings and korean beef tacos to share. Very yummy although the tacos were spicier than expected. Want to come back and try the crispy pig belly grilled cheese.My favorite part was the wine on tap. Wine on tap! If I didn't have to work the next day I would have tasted some of the many craft beers they offer. I'll definitely be back to this place, probably on another week night.

You sit wherever you want and a waitress promptly brings you the menu. The steak and egg sliders were yummy! Though the portion was a bit small, the food was so good I didn't mind. The egg sandwich my friend had also was very good, with the eggs nicely runny and the bread was fresh. The best part here for sure was the unlimited mimosas, for only $12!!! They come in a very large wine glass, and the second I finished one the waitress came and refilled it. I'll for sure be coming here often for brunch as the prices and drinks are great!!

This place gets points for that, but loses only in terms of noise level in my book. No, I'm not one of those people who complains about noise all the time, it's just that the place wasn't even half full when I visited and you still couldn't hear the person across from you over the noise. My guess is because the walls are tiled and bare so there is nothing to absorb the sound. But who knows, maybe it was just a particularly loud bunch that night!  Apart from that, this place is pretty darn awesome. We were impressed with the craft beer selection and the menu, which is small, but offers some really fun options. We had the Korean Beef Tacos, which were good. The beef was incredibly flavorful. The star for us was the Pig & Dip sandwich though. I had seen pictures of it on their profile and I have to say, it tastes just as incredible as it looks.  It's a pretty heavy and filling dish. We split it, which was fine because I'm not sure I could have eaten the whole thing without feeling supremely guilty afterwards. It's rich in flavor, and has a hint of smokiness. There's crunch to it,  but slight chewiness from the bread and then you dip it in the pork au jus and that just sends things into overdrive.  I know this sounds a bit dramatic, but it really was that good.Our server was great, friendly and helpful. This bar is definitely worth checking out and I intend to visit more often. So glad more places like this are popping up in the neighborhood!",4,,3

My husband still loved the Pig and Dip, our friend had the tacos, which he liked but my chicken flatbread was pretty flavorless and the chicken on top was oddly cold (maybe due to there only being one server.)Our friend and I ordered beers that the waitress thought we had received but didn't. She rectified the situation pretty quickly but then it was on our bill, which she again rectified quickly.

The bottomless mimosas were great, they didn't skimp on the champagne, I think I had 4! And they are good about replenishing drinks. I had the steak and cheese sliders along with home fries. The sliders were great and the home fries were good although I wish the portion of home fries had been larger.

I do elder drinking and am not there (thankfully) when ""the younger people"" are out and about.Ok, enough snark. Down to business. Great bar. The beer selection is well done. I'm a particular fan of the Victory Hop Devil on the nitro line. Running a hoppy beer through nitrogen as if it were a stout or porter rounds off the edges and gives it a full mouth feel. Well played, sirs. Hogshead is quickly becoming my go to after work and weekend bar.The food is good too. And, I want to know where they got the green tile. I'd so use that in my kitchen.

107,Gatsby M.,"New York, NY",504,41,3,4.0,7/20/2015,"Hogshead is a nice place up in Hamilton Heights. The food is good, the beer selection is varied, and the place has a nice trendy but not too trendy feel. Most of the food is great (though a few dishes come in under par) and the service, while incredibly friendly, is sometimes a little slow.Food: Oh my god the Beef Sliders are amazing. The Korean Tacos are also pretty damn good. We ordered the brussel sprouts as an app, and as someone who puts salt on absolutely everything, they were WAY too salty. The prices are incredibly reasonable (I mean, an actual entree for $9? Sold.)Beer: The beer selection is outstanding (and there are quite a few to choose from). I'm partial to stouts, so the Nitro Milk Stout is always a good choice. When I go back, I'll make sure to try some others that they have on tap. Other people were pleased with their beers as well, so I don't think there is a single complaint there.Decor/Service: The restaurant is a vaguely trendy ""gastropub"" feel, with lots of open space and butcher block tables. The lighting is nice and moody, so pretty great for a date night, though it can definitely get crowded. The people who work here were incredibly nice, though a little slow on the service. Still, I didn't really mind as we were there kind of early and the vibe felt nice and relaxed.Tip: Happy Hour is only a dollar off all beers, so nothing to write home about. Still, the food is already reasonably priced, so definitely worth going.",,,

I was incredibly excited when they started their Pride nights, as I finally had a place to socialize among my community in walking distance. Unfortunately I stopped going because Pride night increasingly became cliquey, and it was very obvious who was and was not welcome. I want to be--VERY--clear that (at least as I understood it) this is NOT on the bar staff, but on the non-employee person(s) who were sort of allowed to be ""in charge"" of organizing the weekly event, who created and/or encouraged that environment among the people there for Pride night.

We waited 15 minutes more and still no Grilled Cheese.  We cancelled the order, and she basically said ""Ok"" and walked away.

Updated review",I am embarrassed to say that my second experience here was a disappointment. Quite embarrassing after I raved about it to my friends. The waiter was clearly overextended and could not handle the volume. My friend waited over 40 minutes for sliders. She eventually left to eat at a near by restaurant and the sliders came quite some time after her departure. The waitress did comp the sliders but the service was truly unacceptable. Your best bet is to go on a weekday. Avoid at all cost on Fridays. Please hire more staff. My grilled cheese was still amazing! :),,,
128,Adrian R.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/13/2015,I recently moved to this area of Harlem and count myself lucky to have this bar nearby. I was looking for a place to watch NFL games on Sundays. I was a fan the moment I walked in and was greeted immediately by Nathan. I was made to feel welcomed. I've had the pleasure of being served by Drew and Megan behind the bar and all 3 are genuinely friendly and knowledgeable about their selection of beers.

Unlimited beer samples. Delicious draft selection. My recos for full-bodied, balanced, fruity, spicy, smooth suds: Victory Summer Love and Bronx Belgian Pale Ale (too tame for hopheads, but they have plenty of IPAs). Dollar off happy hour (quiet time to come). Chipotle bbq pig wings (rib portions) were tender and sweet, but I didn't taste any pineapple or watermelon in the crunchy, fresh, carrot dressed slaw. The kale and artichoke dip has too much cream cheese in the recipe (tastes like warm flavored cream cheese). The cheese on top could have been way crispier with many more veggies within. Ciabatta crostini well seasoned and baked. The pig & dip sandwich is the star of their menu: juicy and flavorful with perfect textural contrast.",,,

161,Joy L.,"New York, NY",0,41,6,5.0,8/29/2015,"Go and check this place out! Excellent draft selection and great food. We had the grilled cheese, sliders and bulgogi sliders. Everything was delicious - way better than typical bar food. Our bartender/server Asa was so nice to chat with. Hogshead is a solid addition to the neighborhood!",,,
162,Toni B.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,28,17,3.0,3/8/2015,"bartender isn't that skilled. it's okay if you are unsure of how to make a drink; just say so and I'll order something else. ambiance is, mediocre, at best.",1,,
163,Daniel S.,"Manhattan, NY",455,4,0,5.0,12/2/2014,"Great beer selection. Try their pumpkin stout on tap, not sure who brews it. The Sliders were perfect. Great atmosphere and It's never crowded...let's hope it stays that way. This is a hidden gem. I'm stupid to let people know about this place.",,,
164,Trevor B.,"White Plains, NY",18,97,27,5.0,2/28/2015,"I went here today for brunch. They have a nice beer selection and pretty good prices as far as beer goes.  Your average int is $7 with some $6 pints. They were offering samplers with 4 4-5oz beers for $7 for beer week. I'm not sure what the regular price is.  I liked the atmosphere. When I went on Saturday afternoon, it wasn't too crowded at all. It's nice because it is just far enough off of the beaten path to not be like Harlem Public (which I love but is just too crowded almost all the time.)  The atmosphere is nice and I liked the classic rock they were playing. I got plenty of time to enjoy all of that since it took about an hour for my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich to come out.  I did read that the service was slow which is a bit of an understatement. However, the waitresses, bartender, everyone that worked there were very friendly. When the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich finally came out it was the best I have ever had hands down.  I think $12 is expensive for a bacon egg and cheese in this neighborhood but I will say it was worth it. *Tip* after brunch we went next door and picked up some awesome cookies at the nice little bakery.",,,2
165,Amanda N.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,9/13/2015,Was randomly walking by and came in.  Great craft and over all beer selection.  Cool menu.  Something different with the pork theme.  Tried a lot of the small dishes all unique and tasty.  Later found out they do brunch and have traditional yummy brunch food with coffee and I got a bellini.  Guitarist was playing music during brunch.  Super chill.,,,
166,Flora C.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,9/5/2015,The food was AMAZING! It's nice to not have to venture downtown for real good food! If you're craving PB&J French toast you've come to the right place.. Gooey deliciousness !! Mike our waiter was great! Nice vibe ... Nice atmosphere...,,,
167,Leslie M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,7/29/2015,"Awesome decor. Great beer list. Bartender Drew was attentive & fun, very welcoming. Wished it had more food options. With that being said, I'll be returning real soon.",,,
168,D R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,34,0,3.0,9/21/2014,You've got to give the owners of this spot props for opening a fancy tavern on such a drug infested corner of Hamilton Heights. A friend and I went in last night to check it out. My beer was supposed to come 8oz for $8 and I think it was less than 5oz. The bartender also dumped the last couple of sips of my friend's wine before he was done. It's a bit stingy and expensive but a great addition to the hood!,,2,

Updated review",The food was great. Pig & Dip sandwich and Crispy pork belly grilled cheese are very good. Washed it down with a Ballast Point grapefruit sculpin & Victory hop devil. My wife had a beer cocktail that she really enjoyed. Overall I enjoy this place a lot.,,,
170,Shaun C.,"Manhattan, NY",12,6,1,5.0,3/26/2015,"My Favorite new bar in Hamilton Heights. They have a great selection on draft and the bartenders make a mean Old-Fashion. The food is awesome, the pork sandwich with the au jus dipping sauce is heaven. Full disclosure...I went two days in a row to have this.",,,
171,Tim R.,"New York, NY",13,14,0,4.0,3/18/2015,"Awesome selection, taste, and service.  Only knock would be on the blandish music. A little Maroon 5 goes a long way.  How about a little funk?  Thanks for listening and welcome!",,,
172,Ali S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,3,5.0,10/12/2014,"Just what the neighborhood needed. Great beer list, tasty menu items, friendly staff and engaging patrons all in one place. Definitely going back.",,,

174,Kelly L.,"Manhattan, NY",15,17,0,5.0,12/9/2014,"Great bar, staffed by nice, attentive people. The beer list has enough variety to be fun but is very well curated. Try one of the beer cocktails- you may be pleasantly surprised. Also, the interior is gorgeous. A wonderful addition to the neighborhood, and worth a trip even if you don't live close. Can't wait to return for happy hour!",,,
175,M M.,"New York, NY",0,34,0,5.0,11/30/2014,"This place is amazing!  Great beer selection but also cocktails and wine for the non- beer people. Great for meeting friends at any time from happy hour to late night. Granted, not on a major street but close enough and always easy to call a car if it gets too late. Love the new menu. Hope they keep it - pork belly grilled cheese!",,,
