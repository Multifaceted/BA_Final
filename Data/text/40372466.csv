0,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",554,554,1772,3.0,8/21/2013,A simple elegant lunch at Mural's on 54th. I arrived late for my group lunch around 12:45. The place was empty only one other table was seated besides ours.I had the scallops and greens which was delicious. They were tender and succulent.I got to try some of my friends broccoli sprouts which were excellent it tasted like a mix of soy sauce and brown sugar to make the sauce really flavorful. I could have eaten that all day.Just as fast as our lunch came so our meals go. The portions are small to medium so don't expect to overate because of large portions. They got the size about right so that people can return to work after lunch and not suffer from a food coma.,1,1,
1,Chris H.,"Coconut Creek, FL",56,11,6,1.0,12/23/2017,Crazy expensive after all the fees and taxes. $90 breakfast ended up at $170. This after waiting 30 minutes for cold eggs Benedict and poor service. Terrible place,,,
2,Joan D.,"Burbank, CA",392,66,2,1.0,12/29/2016,I was staying at the hotel and came for their brunch buffet. Food was cold and not so great and the service was slow and most of the employees seem to not be happy.   No one check on me ( except to take plates away) and I have to be asking for juice etc....after I complained that I waited for juice almost 20 minutes then one of them check on me but it was too late... They include 15 percent tip ( even when I was one person)  the service and the food didn't deserve that 15 percent. For almost $ 50 you eat better anywhere else.,,1,
3,Bob W.,"Fairfax, VA",31,71,0,4.0,9/9/2015,"Love this place!  Breakfast was great, both times I visited...food was fresh and plentiful.  Service very good.  And just wow - the restaurant is spectacular.  A cozy and quiet trip back to the 1930s in the historic Warwick Hotel.  1930s-era murals on the walls evoke the great art of the WPA era.  Fantastic place for breakfast!  Just keep your eye on the bill, which may contain a built-in tip charge.",1,,
4,Kristen M.,"Washington, DC",0,11,0,2.0,11/24/2011,"Last year, my family chose this place to have Thanksgiving dinner.  We liked it so much that we decided to go there again today for Thanksgiving.  It will be our last visit.The main problem was the service.  We were never offered anything to drink other than water.  My son's glass sat empty most of the meal.  When my husband asked the waiter for more water while he was cleaning the table next to us, he said okay and then went on cleaning the table even though the restaurant was not full (i.e., the table was not needed for more patrons).  After about ten minutes, he finally brought the water pitcher and filled up our glasses (all of which were empty by that point), but only did so about halfway.  My husband asked for the wine list and ordered us each a glass of wine.  At the end of the meal, we had been overcharged for the wine, and we had been charged a forced gratuity for three people.  The meal was a buffet.  What exactly did the waiter deserve $30 for doing?  He had refilled water once and brought two glasses of wine, and he did that badly.There were several men in suits who worked there standing around, but none of them helped or even smiled or greeted us or anything.  All in all, the service was horrible, and I am still so angry that we were charged (without prior notice) the gratuity for such horrible service.  If it hadn't been Thanksgiving, we would have complained.  Even though the food was pretty good, it was really hard to feel comfortable during this meal because of the way the staff acted and the inability to get drinks to go with that meal.  Next year, we will be going somewhere else.",6,1,
5,Greg M.,"Moore, OK",43,120,2,1.0,12/6/2011,"We have been to this restaurant twice, both times for the Thanksgiving dinner. The first time, I was very pleased. The food had been great and I had no issues at all with the service. But this year, the experience was quite different.The food was /pretty/ good this time, but not outstanding like the year before. The biggest problem was with the service. Our waiter, an eastern European fellow by the name of George, was possibly THE WORST waiter I have ever endured in my life. I am not tough to please, especially at a buffet-style restaurant. In fact, if there was a drink dispenser, I would be happy not to have a waiter at all. But this fellow George filled our waters once when we arrived and I think one more time during the hour plus that we were there. We had to ask several times for a refill. We ordered two glasses of wine at one point and he ended up overcharging us for it on the way out.The kicker: for two water refills and bringing us two glasses of wine, a mandatory 15% gratuity was added to our bill (which was over $200 to begin with, so a little over $30). I worked tip jobs in a previous life and I certainly understand the importance of tipping for service in our wonderful society that doesn't pay waitstaff more than a nominal amount, but seriously, to add it in automatically for a party of three for buffet drink service is outright offensive -- especially when the drink service sucked! Never again.",4,1,1
6,Molly M.,"Elgin, IL",0,40,4,1.0,4/2/2015,"Looks like such a cute little place. We're staying at the Warwick so of course we went here for breakfast. Yuck! Food was so bad. I had eggs Benedict which I had to send back. (In spite of telling the waiter 3 times to put sauce on the side). My husband opted for the buffet which was awful. Couldn't even bring 1/2 & 1/2 for the coffee. And wow was the service SLOW!  Even tho we're staying at the hotel, we won't be going back here",3,1,
7,Stephanie O.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",18,24,2,4.0,8/8/2010,"I had a great time here.My party and I had a lovely waiter, the murals gave us much to talk about, and the food was great.  What made it even better was the presentation.The menu was also pretty reasonable so you won't be breaking the bank here.Just a bit of advice:  Be mindful when tipping.When I received my check, it just included the total amount.  So I added a 21% tip.When I got home and reviewed my online banking, I saw that the total that I'd been charged already included a 20% so it seemed as though I'd added a 41% tip in total.I called Murals about this issue and they were more than happy to rectify it.All in all, I'll be sure to go back.",4,1,
8,Ellen M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,0,1.0,2/3/2013,"I went here for a weekday lunch.  It was more than I usually spend for lunch but sometimes the little extra is worth it if the food is good.  It wasn't.  I had a chopped salad that was not only a tiny portion, but also looked if it was macerated (instead of chopped).  My friend had the tuna nicoise and she said it was unlike any tuna nicoise she ever had--I don't think she liked it.  The place was half empty, but the service was really slow.  I think sometimes hotel restaurants don't try to give good service because they have a captive audience.  My visit to this restaurant reinforced that idea.",2,1,
9,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",175,394,48,1.0,1/4/2012,"gratuity [grtjut]n pl -ties1. (Business / Commerce) a gift or reward, usually of money, for services rendered; tip2. something given without claim or obligationReally? That's funny because this menu has on the bottom: ""For your convenience a 15% gratuity will be added to your check.""Strike One: Lying to me. Is it really for my convenience that you've so generously taken money from my wallet and tipped without my consent? Or is it for your own gain? Pretty sure it's #2. So you've already assumed that I'm stupid and don't understand what convenience means. But hey thanks for saving me those three wiggles of my wrist while holding that super heavy pen while I'm filling out the sheet of paper.Stike Two: 15%? For a buffet? Let me rephrase that: For a mediocre buffet that you're already paying $27 for? Where was the guy with my water refill? He brought me one glass of water and got 15%? Dude filled our glasses up one time and walked away with over $10. I wish I made $10 that easily.Strike Three: Bringing the final check out without an itemization. Read: They're hoping you don't notice the 15% added gratuity and that you tip again. The person I was with did, in fact, tip again, and I didn't notice until I saw the menu online now. So the guy really made about $18 to fill 3 water glasses.But all of this ignores the simple question: What are you doing looking to eat dinner in a hotel? If you're staying here from out of town, WALK OUTSIDE. There is SO much good food in the area for 1/2 the price. If you live here, you should know better. Shame on you.",9,9,3
10,Cin C.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",4,20,0,1.0,7/24/2012,"Sad, unimaginative menu that is NON-descriptive. Also my waitress was clueless as to how the dishes were prepared. ""Tuna and sea beans"" = Tuna encrusted with stale breadcrumb and fried? and a pile of seaweed salad with ONE sea bean (not beans). My waitress actually said,"" let me try to get that taste in my mouth"" when I asked how it's prepared and she told me it's grilled.  How appetizing is that?!",2,3,2

12,Arielle W.,"New York, NY",24,212,0,2.0,1/6/2008,"My bf's mom made a reservation for 6 of us on OpenTable - apparently they couldn't take 6 of us at 6, so we showed up at 5:30, and other people were sitting at our table.  It was a mistake, and they were escorted to another seat.One of our guests arrived early and was told to go to Randolph's to wait across the hall, where he was promptly ignored for 15-20 minutes before being allowed to order a glass of (bad) wine.When we sat down at our large corner table, the 3 seats near the wall did not have bread plates, and our water glasses were only ever refilled when we held them up and waved them in the waiter's face.  My bf ordered a dirty vodka martini on the rocks, and when it arrived up and he corrected them, they said, ""But it was on ice before we poured it!""  Not quite the same thing.  It took them 10 min to bring a glass of ice, and the thing wasn't even dirty.My appetizer was good - the tomato/mozzarella salad, which is not what the description was on the menu, but it was still good.  My friend ordered the soup du jour, which took an extra 10 minutes to arrive after the rest of our salads (for no reason and no explanation was given - in fact, they seemed annoyed that he expected his soup to be there at the same time!)Entrees were very blah - my shrimp risotto was Tasteless; my bf's pork chop was overcooked, but his mashed sweet potatoes were ok; the only winner on the table were the scallops over baked risotto and asparagus.  It really was delicious!  Dessert was good, but it's really difficult to mess up sorbet and cheesecake.In all, they really need to retool this restaurant, bc there are SO MANY BETTER OPTIONS in this neighborhood.",4,,1
13,Patti S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,1,1.0,12/29/2012,"Not Recommended at all. This is actually a 0 star review.My family and I came here for dinner this past Christmas and weren't told that we had reserved during the time they were still serving brunch. This was our misunderstanding, but we were still seated and were not informed that the brunch was about to end in less than a half an hour. The buffet was alright, but definitely not as good as the price they charged us. Though we were just a party of 4, the restaurant added an extra 18% gratuity without our consent. Service was fine up until we politely conveyed to both the waiter and the manager how unhappy we were. Afterwards, my family was ignored for the rest of our stay, which was a good hour before we decided to leave. The manager was inexperienced and reacted rudely upon hearing our concerns.The atmosphere, ambience, and seating were pleasant, but after being so rudely treated and charged an extravagant amount I will not be coming here again.",4,,
14,Richard B.,"Bronx, NY",968,997,600,2.0,9/19/2008,"I came in at 1 to use my $10 coupon as long as I spend $20 this time. The place was completely empty, the Host was very happy to seat me and honor my coupon as well. Off to a good start. Even seated me at the only sunny table in the place. I ordered a Sam and the garlic shrimp pizza. The pizza seemed to be a pre-fab, frozen thin crust type, but the shrimp on top were good. The beer was fine, too. I did have to swat away a few small flys at my table, so who knows how clean the place was. It seems clean, but thats just cause it was quiet in there and the furniture and decor is above average. Its a bit on the pricey side, 8 bucks for my beer, so I dotn think I'd go here again. The ajoining hotel also closed off the sidewalk outside so they could vacuum the old rotten faded carpet they rolled out. That was fun to watch out the window.",1,1,
15,Barbara M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/25/2011,"Went to a corporate event here while attending a conference next door at the Hilton. I thought the room was really cool, amazing murals on the wall. Food was really good and the staff was very upbeat and professional. Will come back again to dine on my own when I am in NY.",2,,
16,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0,4.0,12/28/2005,"This is what I hope for when I go out to dinner. The service was the best I have ever had, attentive without feeling like the staff was joining me for dinner. The scallop appetizer is amazingly creative and equally delicious. I could go on, but I can simply say, dine at Murals on 54.",,,1
