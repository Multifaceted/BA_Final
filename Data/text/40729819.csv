I took an uber and was dropped off right outside the front door. There were 5-6 steps leading up to the entrance, not sure if there was a ramp (there probably was I just didn't see it). They has staff out by the street to organize traffic and usher you inside. The walkway up to the front doors is a small grass area which lighting above. Check in was at the desk to the right when I walked in and coat check was available. The entire downstairs was set up for cocktail hour. They had tables with all of the auction pieces, 2 bars and a professional photographer taking pictures. There were able 3-4 servers floating around with apps and a few tables were set up for the older crowd to sit if they wanted. Bathrooms were downstairs and clean but rather small for the amount of people the venue can hold; only 4 stalls in the ladies room. Around 7pm we were politely ushered upstairs to take our seats. There were about 500 people at this event and the seating seems tight. I went to say hi to a friend across the room and it was a struggle to get over there. The bar upstairs was on the far end of the room. The dance floor was small and the stage was medium size. The architecture along with the lighting of the place was beautiful! Our food was delicious; we were served a veggie lasagna for app, choice of chicken, beef or fish entrée, and chocolate mousse with berries for dessert. Our waiter was professional and timely. There was an elevator connecting the downstairs and upstairs. Not sure if there were bathrooms upstairs as I ventured down the stairs each time I had to go. Overall, the service was phenomenal and the interior décor of the venue was beautiful! I would recommend having an event here as long as it's on the smaller side.",1

They have established a great name for themselves as far as the location, uniquely tucked under 59th street bridge. The building, with all the architecture details. The attention to details, the gentleman outside to greet you with an umbrella in the rain, all decked out as the official first face of Guastavino's you will encounter to start your spectacular night. No matter what event you are there to attend. The inside, spacious and elegant but still room to add decorating details for what ever company would like to put their on signature their event. The holiday Party was wonderfully and flowed really well this is not my company's first go at it, but everything still ran smoothly with Guastavino's staff. Coat check, cocktail hour and bar service all went very well. There were a couple of things that did surprise me however. Sad to say I was not impressed by the food at all. That was disappointing, I was hopping to be wowed or at the bare minimum just being pleased would have done. The upstairs were the small but usable dance floor is located (that means the main entertainment) was not organized well to accommodate all the activities that were simultaneously taking place.  There wasn't enough seating and where there were seats people were hovering over you and trying to squeeze by to get the food, bars, dance floor or picture activities.Needless to say I had a wonderful time.",1
3,5,1/5/2018,147,4,"West Babylon, NY",Juhi G.,413,1.0,136,I'm giving this place 1 star because the alcohol they serve you here is NOT top shelf. They have all top shelf bottles behind the bar but not all of them are opened or being used. They have a few on the bottom they use and they definitely fill them with cheap cheap booze!! I drink a decent amount and I know my liquor! I had three black and cokes and kept puking! I got so sick and it ruined the rest of my night! The second drink tasted so off to me but I told myself it might just be me but NOPE. This place sucks and I would not trust their drinks! DO NOT recommend this place to anyone!,9

Not only were they super cheap with the app hour (one server passing around every 5-10 mins) there was one bartender with salt and pepper long-ish hair in a pony tail that was BEYOND rude, I asked for a Malibu baybreeze and he made it without cranberry juice. When I asked him if he had any he barked at me and told me to move so he can continue servicing others. He doesn't even know how to be a bartender! I made sure to let me company know of this incident so we can have events elsewhere and not here.",3

The hall is beautiful, Joseph, Abdul and Sandra are amazing and took care of us from the start of planning until the end. Sandra is a phenomenal bridal attendant, so professional and sweet! She helped the bride and groom throughout the night and really helped make the night a success. The maitre de was also phenomenal, as was our doorman Abdul. The lights and sound was amazing- were able to add last minute lights when I wanted some color. Really phenomenal venue with phenomenal employees.",

I was here for a company holiday party and had a ball. The food was set up on the first floor, and the second floor had a few bars set up as well as a pretty nice dance floor. Additionally on the second floor, there was a large projection screen above the stage where the band performed. Photo booths, good food, live music, dancing, drinks, and a beautiful venue. It all made for a perfect night. The restrooms were clean and came with an attendant. The coat check was very quick and orderly, for both dropping off and picking up at the end of the night. The place was very spacious, and I would absolutely return here for a future event.",2

They have wedding timelines down to a tee. The night was structurally flawless, from set-up to tear down. Having a bridal attendant on the day of was literally the best thing ever- Sandra was always one step ahead of us, from having my flats ready to change out of my heels to sewing a button back onto my husband's tux; honestly, this takes a lot of stress off both family and the bridal party. Our maître d,' Joseph, was great at coordinating all the vendors and ensuring the night ran smoothly. The evening of our tasting, he ran out to purchase a bottle of wine my parents were interested in trying because they didn't have it in house at the time. Holly, the wedding coordinator, answered all of my questions and assisted with the planning in the days leading up to the wedding. When we ran into a minor roadblock along the way, she worked with us to come up with a solution. The food was also delicious! And they did an incredible job with our cake. The only downside was that they have an exclusive lighting vendor, Gala Productions, who I'd never recommend to anyone.",6

13,1,12/16/2014,350,1,"New York, NY",Dana Y.,726,4.0,238,"We had our annual holiday party here. The place is beautiful outside and inside. I was greeted immediately with an umbrella since it was snowing that day. Every person I walked by was very welcoming and nice. Bag and coat-check line went by fast since they were working at a very fast pace. We had a long list of options for hors d'oeuvres, main course, and desserts. I didn't get a chance to try the hors d'oeuvres but the food for main course were great. We had buffet stations with Asian, Italian, beef carving, and Mediterranean. Desserts were great too - from cookies to cake pops. They were serving coffee too. As for drinks, it was open bar - the bartenders were nice and were working very fast. I didn't have to wait too long in line. Only thing is that I just wished they had more tables and chairs out during dinner time, I had to stand and eat my food for a little. We had a DJ on the second floor, with the dance floor. Music was good, DJ was interactive and was having fun with us. It was an overall great night. I just wish it wasn't so cold and snowing, so we could have went outside to enjoy the view.",2
14,2,1/16/2014,325,5,"Secaucus, NJ",Chelsea B.,187,1.0,332,"The Guastavino's New Years Eve event was laughable. It was the most disorganized event I've ever been to. There was no excuse for the unprofessional way the night was run. The premium open bar was from 9-3 am. As it was advised to arrive early, my family, bf, and I got there at 8:45 and stood on the VIP line since we had Seated VIP tickets. 9 o'clock came and went. General admission was let in continuously. After a while, a girl came around with orange wristbands, which I assumed meant we would be let in. Nope. They were for the after party. More waiting. They finally let us into the gated area. At this point, my sister and I were FREEZING. My toes were numb. I was all dressed up for New Years so I had a dress on with open-toed heels, as did a lot of the women there. Silly me for thinking we would be let in relatively quickly when it is a 25,000 square foot space. After an hour standing in the cold, winter night, my mom started to ask what was going on. The girls informed us that there were problems with seating, but instead of having people wait to the side, they just stopped the whole line. It was a disaster. My mom talked to another guy who said that 1 person from each party had to wait in line, but everyone else could go in, so we left my poor dad to wait some more alone. I couldn't stand to be outside anymore. My feet were frozen and my legs were so stiff. Once everyone was inside, we checked our coats, but they told my dad he had to pay $120. My dad asked, ""For what?!"" They said bottle service. My dad said we weren't getting bottle service so she wrote a balance on our table card. A guy took us upstairs to where the DJ and dance floor was to seat us. We are loop-de-looping around the whole place and then the dude says, ""Yeah they just changed the whole floor plan around and I don't even work here, I was just hired for the night."" ....sweet, I do not care. My legs have not defrosted yet. They are stiff and I am in pain and I want to sit down. We get brought back downstairs and are seated at a table..finally.So we missed some of open bar already even though we showed up early and are anxious to get a drink. They didn't have pourers on the bottles so the booze flowed heavily...I'm not complaining. I had one very strong gin & tonic and was content with that. We started partying upstairs. We danced on the dance floor until we got a bit hungry and wondered where the hors d'oeuvres were at. The upstairs started getting insane. We saw one girl walk by with a nosebleed. We retreated downstairs.Some of the tables had their food delivered to them so we asked if we could get some for our own. Any time there was food brought around we had to ask for it. We were checking our phones before midnight. My mom got some live feed pulled up on hers. They didn't bring around champagne or announce a champagne toast or anything, even though there was supposed to be an ""electrifying live New Year's Eve countdown."" No matter, we didn't expect much from the event people at this point so we were already at the bar getting our flutes. I think the DJ realized there were 5 seconds left to the ball-drop when he started counting, but since my mom was prepared we had already been counting down with a whole group of people surrounding her phone hahah. Oh technology. There were no party favors as advertised either. What a bummer...After that we started our own dance party on the lower level where we had room to be comfortable and have a good time. We met some really fun people who joined in. I almost fell when a guy sweeping around a mop got it caught under my heel. Grrrrr...The venue was beautiful, but it did not compensate whatsoever for the shortfall of everything else promised upon not being delivered. While we did have an amazing time together, it was no thanks to Guastavino's. We could have had a good time somewhere else, which we will next year.Don't come here for New Years!",26
15,,12/18/2014,236,,"New York, NY",Erum R.,223,4.0,320,"Great location for our company's holiday party. I loved how the venue was broken out so you could hang out downstairs to mingle or go upstairs and be on the dance floor. Both floors had a full bar, full buffet, and lots of seating.I thought the wait staff did a fabulous job. Loved how the second you walk in there is a line of people ready to check your coat. No long wait to get rid of that big bulky thing so you can zip to your fun evening. There was also a line of waiters with drinks and appetizers to get you started.I know people who have been to weddings here and also had a blast. It is a beautiful spot and has so much charm, being right in the Queensboro bridge. I hope to have another excuse to visit again!",2

We decided we wanted a cocktail party style wedding with no assigned seating and food stations all night. They were extremely flexible and helped make our vision a reality. We had tables around the floor but they put couches all along the dance floor to give it a more loungy feel. They were a pleasure to work with throughout the whole process.The wedding itself: unreal. The staff went above and beyond to make everyone comfortable and happy. It was raining when guests arrived and they had staff greeting guests with umbrellas. The food was off the charts. The space was gorgeous.  Just about every person that attended had only amazing things to say.Thank you Guastavino's for making the best day of our lives so amazing!!  Special shout out to John, Nadine, Joe and Abdul!",5

Their ambiance completely matched the tone of the film, and everything about the service was amazing. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, particularly Joseph, one of the bartenders, who makes a killer dirty martini!!  The food was good, but lacking in consistency- for instance, both floors served filet mignon: the upstairs filet was perfect, but the downstairs filet was overcooked. It's completely understandable, particularly with such a large party.  I would definitely come back here any time!",

It has two floors...both floors had a buffet and a bar but the second floor has a small dance floor and stage.  The whole place was illuminated by blue-dimmed lights and specs of snowflakes were projected on the walls.  The service staff was welcoming and friendly and the food was delicious!  There was a buffet of steak, seafood, and pasta offered throughout the night which was a first for me because I'm used to being at company parties, in which the food is set away after the first two hours.  There was also a dessert table towards the end of the party, which was a variety of Holiday cookies, chocolate-dipped strawberries, and cake pops.  Even the size of the dance floor was efficient.  When I first saw it, I thought there wouldn't be enough room for dancing but it was the right size since not everybody likes to show off their dance moves at corporate parties.",1
26,3,1/6/2014,460,,"Stockton, CA",Garreth G.,51,4.0,389,"It's really 3.5Came here for New Years Eve and luckily we showed up early because they had two lines one for Gen Admin and the other for VIP. They were really tardy with bringing the VIP to the table. We had to wait like an extra 15 minutes because the people ahead of us had problems with bottle payment. So we started late with the open bar and didn't get our VIP bottle service until an hour or two before midnight. We got our ""shared"" table probably around 930-945pm. I have ""shared"" in quotes because we didn't think we were going to share a table with another group. Anyway luckily we got our table right next to the dance floor instead of downstairs where nothing was really happening. The place itself is awesome to throw events. Looked historical with the high ceilings and its located right underneath the Queensboro bridge. The open bar was awesome as they weren't joking about premium liquor. I got Jameson all night. Got drinks non stop until a lot of people started coming in and then the lines started to get cahrazy. Also lines for the women's bathroom was nuts. So glad I'm a guy. There was no countdown but luckily I kept an eye out for the time to start pouring champagne. There was some food but I didn't have any of it as I was not hungry. I saw some Moz balls and tomato cherry on a stick and some charcuterie items like salami. Dance floor was small compared to number of people who attended. The security in the front said estimated 1300 people with max capacity of 1700. This place would probably be a good wedding venue.

We had a bottle of Vodka and a bottle of champagne for our table. They also came with a plate of antipasti but I was too busy to eat it.The venue itself is gorgeous and I loved the high ceilings.

I was immediately informed upon arrival that coat check was to the right and found the check in process very EFFICIENT (The staff stands in a line as the clientele does and everyone meets up- rather like a choreographed dance).I know the organization that put on the event had a decorator so I'm not sure how much credit goes to her or how much goes to Guastavino's but tall the displays were arranged elegantly. things to improve on: the mirrors in the ladies rooms weren't wiped clean. Also, the event was rather rushed out . I don't know what Guatavino's is on an every day basis so i don't know if there was a particular reason behind this. I would have like to chat and sip my tea in the lobby before heading out. Though that could have been a rental thing.The open bar was a fabulous touch- really makes it feel more upscale for some reason, except I asked for less alcohol in my apple martini and it seemed that idea flew over the bartender. The video screens are fantastic as the event was packed so I was able to watch from there. Even sitting in back, I could watch the screen in the mirror so did not have to swivel around and strain my back. Definitely a place to go simply for the splendor of the building.",3

It was definitely a beautiful venue to have a wedding. The bride and groom had separate suites. The staff seemed friendly and helpful - I especially appreciated the older gentleman that went out of his way to serve me a glass of water (I was seated out of the way for my portion of the ceremony). The only obvious negative? The bathrooms on the first floor were disgusting - tissue all over the floor, uncleaned toilets.

When we were initially looking for a wedding venue in nyc we found it challenging to find something unique until we saw Guastavino's. The space itself is absolutely spectacular with beautiful stone arches and huge windows looking out at the city. We had very high expectations for our wedding at Guastavino's and every element of the evening greatly exceeded our expectations.  The staff at Guastavino's is top notch. From Holly, the on site coordinator, who irons out every detail of the evening with you in advance and is on site that day to oversee to Joseph, the extremely polished maître d, who anticipates what you and your guests will want long before you do to every waiter, bartender and doorman who is professional and warm and accommodating, the staff at Guastavino's truly blew us away.We had heard rave reviews from friends who had previously attended events at Guastavino's that the food was fantastic and at our tasting we were very impressed. Being able to replicate a delicious meal for 6 for 275 is no easy task but Guastavino's seemed to have no issues with this. Cocktail hour was over the top and each course of our dinner was outstanding. The little details of the evening like fresh squeezed juices at the bar and the ease if getting drinks all night and passed desserts on the dance floor reminded us that we had picked the right venue for our wedding. Choosing the right venue for an event is obviously a tremendously important part of the planning process. I can not more highly recommend Guastavino's for a wedding or any event.",2

40,,7/30/2013,0,,"Miami Beach, FL",Whit E.,4,1.0,43,"I went here on Friday night for a gala event. The space is beautiful. The food was not very good. The passed bits were just a bit off. For example, they offered foie gras on a toast with jam. Sounds good. But the toast and jam were overpowering, such that it didn't matter what it was served with. It could have been a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. What was really unfortunate was the handling of drinks early in the evening. The event was open bar. During the first part of the evening there were men with trays of wine (sparkling, red, and white). It was easy to find a drink. By 8:30 (the event started at 8), it was impossible to find a drink. Guests started asking the servers where they could get a beverage. The servers responded that they were doing glasses of wine and that they would be coming. We learned what door the wine was coming out from. Many others learned also. So we joined the crowd waiting for a beverage.We waited 10 minutes. After 15 minutes I stopped one of the waitstaff and explained the issue. She asked me what I wanted and said that someone would bring it out. Great for me, but what about everyone else? I explained to her that everyone in this group of now 50 people was waiting for a drink. She told me to tell the next person who came out. So I waited, and I told the next person who came out... again without a beverage for anyone. He continued walking. Finally I asked someone if there was a manager present. They ignored me. So... 30 minutes into the evening, there are 50 people waiting around the entry to the kitchen waiting for some wine. We wait for 15 minutes. A man comes out with 8 glasses of red wine and doesn't even make it out of the kitchen. Someone actually delivers my sparking wine... on a tray, with nothing else on it! Like I was some VIP (no argument there - ha!). It was just totally inappropriate.Then the seated portion of the event started and no one had had a drink... some folks had been at the event for over an hour at this point and couldn't even get a glass of water. I am not exaggerating. It was terrible. I tried to remedy this by explaining the situation to multiple servers, asking for the manager, etc. To no avail. I do not recommend having your event in this space if you care about your guests enjoying the event. And if your guests, like ours, pay nearly $200 for a ticket with open bar, they will expect FAR more than this, and may not come to your future events. Think about it.",21

Needless to say, I picked at my food... which was to be expected because the food was rather lackluster anyway.  Good thing I filled up on the h'orderves. :)Dessert was good but a full 1.5 hrs late.

Let me get my shenanigan experience out of the way now so I can get to why I still gave them 4 stars.... I came here as a photographer's assistant shooting a extremely high end corporate party here. I showed up with the photographer before any of the guests and spent the entire night walking around with a large light on a pole lighting the guests as the photographer photographed them. At the end of the night we were done, we partook in the food and festivities a bit, and went to the curb to wait for the car the corporate company called for us. The photographer had asked me to run back in to grab a cookie or something from the dessert table that had just been set up. I went inside and was about to grab a piece of dessert when I was rudely turned around by one of Guastavino's crack squad of security personal. He asked me if I was there for the party and to show him my invitation or name badge (of which I had neither). I told him I was the photographers assistant and had been there all night with the light he may have seen going off. I also told him we were by the street waiting for a car and I just came back in to grab a cookie or something and would be leaving right away. He very aggressively told me if I didn't belong there that I needed to leave and proceeded to kick me out. I don't know who this guy thought he was but this was some bullsh*t that made me almost loose it. Anyway, back to the main event space. The location is located under the Queensboro Bridge and was originally built as a market place for the vendors in Queens to come over and sell their goods in the city. Although Guastavino's was once a high end restaurant, it is solely an event space now. They have two very large beautiful floors connected with a spiral staircase and the ceiling is an original tiled vaulted ceiling accented with fantastic columns. All the help here were dressed in tuxes and the food and wine were delicious. They had 3 full bars in addition to the 2 wine stations and they only served top shelf liquors. In addition, if your drink involved OJ or grapefruit juice they had the fruit and the juicer to squeeze the juice to order. My drink was way too strong for me but I'm sure that's better than not strong enough. The party had about 400 or so people accommodated perfectly and I would say overall this is a true historic venue with all the charm and beauty of a modern space.",2

We went and hung out at the table a bit then another party came over and said it was their table. After some uncomfortable conversation it turned out we were given the wrong table number.

We used a kosher caterer so I'm unable to speak to the food, but our guests are still raving about Guastavino's signature champagne and pomegranate cocktails.  The venue itself provided every bit of old Manhattan glamour that we'd hoped for at our wedding, and our guests are still talking about the venue when we see them.  It was a perfect day, made so by the stunning venue and the service they provide.",

It is located right underneath the 59th St. bridge on the Manhattan side. Infact, the ceiling was basically the underside of the bridge (tiled and beautified, of course). Yes, imagine just how tall the ceiling was. it was grand, gorgeous, and almost breathtaking. I remembered that our table was on the loft space on the second floor, which had full view of the bar below. The stairs going up was wide and winding. The lady at the coat check actually comes up to you to take your jacket from you. At our tables they had violinists and coming up to play music for you. But it wasn't cheesy and pretentious - infact, it was more that if there hadn't been a violinist, it would have felt as though something were amiss. Since Guastavinos I don't think I've been to another place quite like it. The pure magestic ambiance made it feel like it was straight out of an old black-and-white classic.

The food was great, the staff went above and beyond.  Shouts out specifically to Marisa, the venue coordinator, and Robin, the bridal attendant.   Marisa did more than a day-of coordinator; running the show without any need of my type A reminders.   Robin left no detail untouched, helping us (without our request!) align the escort cards, put together our amenity baskets, even ironing some of the groomsmen jackets before steaming bridesmaid dresses, making sure the groom and i were hydrated by presenting us regularly with a silver tray of ice water glasses, and informing us when our meals were hot and should be eaten!  We were able to enjoy the nice weather by having the outdoor space last minute for our cocktail hour thanks to John and Marisa.  The open bar was all top shelf without extra cost, fresh squeezed OJ added a special touch.  Our guests' love of shots did not go unsatisfied; the bartenders worked hard to keep the shot glasses coming!  We enjoyed the pre-wedding tasting; it was hard to select the menu but we were pleased with all our selections.  Brides, the bridal suite is great.... the bridal party enjoyed a fun casual lunch and tea while they got ready for the festivities.   After the wedding, we already started thinking what else we could do at the venue... it was a truly memorable night.  I hope to get invited to a wedding at this venue!",4

The chef was very good to make sure that everything was prepared how we wanted it, and he agreed to make us a croquembouche (in lieu of a traditional wedding cake), which is a rather specialized menu item. Seven months later, I still get compliments on the food- especially the pulled pork appetizer.Guastavino's was also very accomodating when it came to hiring outside vendors, which is what we did for the photographer, DJ, and florist.  I think the only vendor you have to hire through Guastavino's is security, which was fine with me. Their lighting guys were very fun and helpful, and they've recently set up the place so that you can choose to light the space in whatever color you want at no additional cost. There are also many choices for different overlay/texture lighting patterns, which can help set the mood you're envisioning.Finally, not that I have to say it, but the space is beautiful and perfect for a midsize wedding (150-200 guests). I like the split level structure because it makes the upper level feel a lot less overwhelming and intimidating than it would be if it was a single, open space. What sold me on Guastavino's however was its perfect blend of traditional and modern elements. The brickwork upstairs and exposed pipes downstairs give the space an urban and contemporary vibe while the souring columns, barrel vaulting, and large windows give this extraordinary example of Beaux-Arts architecture its elegance and grandeur.Oh and the bride gets her very own lady in waiting- I thought that was pretty neat!

It's 11:59!!"" we never would have known it was midnight or even close to it since there was no countdown, no televised ball drop, no champagne toast (as promised) -- nothing.  We hung around for a few more hours to try to drink our $500 worth in alcohol and as the night went on the music got a little better -- but might have been the alcohol talking.  As we left (thankfully with our coats) we felt like we had been robbed monetarily and of the night, the whole way home we couldn't shake the stinging feeling that we could have had a much better time at someones apartment for a lot less money.Cool looking venue?
