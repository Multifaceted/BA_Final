0,Kyle P.,"New York, NY",163,259,226,4.0,12/23/2017,"New dunkin donuts on first avenue in the 70s. This is just a small shop, no seating inside, and no restrooms. They have limited menus but a good quick stop close by.  The place is pretty clean and service is pretty good. Will be back-a goodGrab and go quick coffee spot.",,,
1,Stacy M.,"Sunnyside, NY",50,22,1,1.0,5/2/2018,So I've been here twice already.  I always order a vanilla chai with almond milk at dounkin. First time i ordered a few weeks back the drink was served extra foamy. I kindly  asked them to take off the foam. Now of course I'm a pain in the azz for asking but I thought that was understood I didnt order a freaking cappuccino...Anyways The employee said next time say no foam when ordering the drink.  Today I decided to give them another chance and ordered the same drink with no foam. Now I've worked for Starbucks before and i know damn well when a drink is made over 200 degrees in temperature. I literally burned my mouth being 20 blocks away from this store. my drink is still freaking hot af. I guess that's what happens when u emphasize almond milk with no foam. ..smh may be a new store but still hiring shi**y employees.,,,
2,Crista S.,"Brookline, MA",0,6,0,1.0,5/15/2018,"Asked for almond milk in my iced coffee and was purposely given whole milk. People don't ask for almond milk to be difficult; they do it because they have an allergy. Clearly, I can taste the difference. Don't go here in the morning if you need almond milk.",,,
3,Famous O.,"New York, NY",1,30,2,1.0,5/10/2018,"The name of the store is Dunkin' DONUTS. I ordered two. A French Cruller (they should be soft and eggy, it was actually so stale it was crunchy.) A jelly, all the sugar was liquefying and the 1/8 teaspoon of jelly was almost breaking through the bottom. It's really pathetic. Even worse than it was when it was on York and 77. How this chain stays in business is beyond me. 7-11 has both way better donuts and coffee. Sad how much they've fallen.",,,
