I usually stick with the old fashioned (which is excellent), but my girlfriend usually orders different cocktails which I steal sips from and they have all been delicious. The atmosphere is very romantic, making it a great destination for date night.",

It's very dark when you come in, so take care not to bump into anything and give your eyes time to adjust.I asked them to make me a non-alcoholic cocktail with ginger and lemon and it was delicious! Ambiance-wise, it feels very much like hanging out in someone's dark basement. When I went on a Wednesday evening, I at times found it too noisy for a proper conversation. It's probably more true-to-form to an authentic 1920s speakeasy, but nowadays you kind of pay for the glamour with the elevated drink prices, no?",
2,1,11/18/2018,67,1,"Manhattan, NY",Nivi R.,60,4.0,162,We came here on a Saturday to celebrate my birthday. The place was packed. They have a few tables at the back which is first come first serve basis. We had to wait for over an hour till we got the table. All in all I enjoyed the drinks and the place. I would imagine this place would be really nice during the week to come on a date!,1

We put our name in for a little table immediately, by the time we ordered and got our drink at the tiny bar, we ended up having our table ready. Cocktails are amazing. They have an extensive list, but the bartender choice is the way to go. Both my cocktails were off menu, crafted by the bartender off of a few details from me. Both amazing. Mine were bourbon based and my friend had two tequila bases. Amazing, cozy, great jazz playing- go here!",

We came around 830pm on a Thursday night and there was a 45 minute wait to be seated in the booths. We opted for the standing area, which had some standing space and tall tables. It's fairly dim inside and the menu is impossible to read unless you're close to the bar. Drink menu here is fairly extensive with a mix of classic cocktails and their own creations. Place is excellent for a party of two. Great vibes here and not so loud that you have to shout.",2

My friend and I showed up a few minutes before it opened and were able to grab a booth. They also give you free bar snacks (nuts etc) if you ask! A must on any NYC speakeasy list.Edit 10/2018: Bee's Knees was a tiny bit too sweet for my liking but great overall.",
6,,1/8/2018,230,,"London, United Kingdom",Amanda W.,259,4.0,96,"TLDR: dimly lit basement speakeasy; small tables; good cocktails; live jazz; cash onlyGiven that this is technically a ""hidden"" speakeasy, the entrance is through an unmarked door with stairs that descend to the basement level. Came here on a Tuesday night around 12:30am. While there were a good amount of people, it wasn't overcrowded and there wasn't a wait for a two-person table.We were seated in a small but cute booth which luckily had hooks on either side for our coats and purses. The booths are so small that there's no room for anything extra. There are a couple of larger tables that may have been more spacious though. The menus were already at the table, and it's so dimly lit here that we needed to take turns using the candle at the table to read the menu.I opted for an Irish coffee while my sister ordered a hot toddy. Both drinks were pretty strong, served hot, but had an element of sweetness. While we were enjoying our drinks, a live jazz band was playing in the background. Since I played the trumpet for seven years back in middle / high school, I really appreciated / enjoyed this.Know this place can get really crowded on weekends, but is a nice place to grab a cocktail and listen to jazz on a less busy weeknight.",2

8,,1/2/2018,8,,"San Francisco, CA",Preeti R.,117,1.0,81,"Overrated and expensive. The insides were extremely dark, would have liked some more lighting for a more intimate setting. I understand that it is a speakeasy but it was darker than most speakeasies I have been to and the place carried no visible decor of its own.Not a great place to hang out if you are a big group and haven't made reservations. We were 5 of us and there was a line outside the bar when we got there. We had to wait out in the cold for about 15 mins before we were let in. When we got in, the server informed us that the table wasn't ready yet and that we had to wait another 15 or so mins for it to be available (what!?). We decided to check out the menu while we waited and saw some good cocktail options but everything was on the pricey side - 20$ for a moscow mule for a place that doesn't even come with a view.TLDR: poor service and expensive drinks. True speakeasy in the sense that it is very dark inside and there is no name on the door with stairs leading down to the main bar area.",4

They also have a great jazz playlist that really adds to the ambiance.The drinks are phenomenal. I got the Moscow mule and it was perfect. I highly recommend.

If you're going to drop $16 on a handcrafted cocktail this is a great place to do it.Enter through a tiny door on the corner of 7 Ave South & Leroy.  There's a bouncer at the door, and often a line that gives away it's secret digs. Enter the door, and go down a long, steep staircase to a basement. It is super duper dark, but you're able to find your way with dim lighting. There's a small bar area, but lots of seats that the hostess will seat you at.It's so dark it's hard to tell if it's decorated, but it's a cool ambiance.  The cocktails are superb. And if you don't know what you want, just tell the waitress what type of cocktails you like and they'll whip something up to suit your fancy. No food here - just booze.

First of all, i probably walked by this 37297484 Times, and never noticed it, but, isn't that the point with a speakeasy? You aren't supposed to notice it. Knocked, and was told to stand up against the wall while we waited our turn. Since it was early enough, they let us in right away, and even with no reservation squeezed us in the back. (There were 8 of us) the server was awesome, excellent at recommending, and we were all happy to let the bartender take the reins and create us things. We definitely went to town on some of the drinks. They're strong, and delicious, and simple, the list has some great classics as well as some interesting choices. The place was dark, and underground, and could easily get packed. Well worth it for a date or drinks spot!",

Growing up in NYC, it's really surprising when you're blind date selects a spot in your backyard that you've walked past for 15 years and never noticed. Ok.... so 10 years of that I thought girls and liquor had cooties and gross, but still can't believe I was 25 before I stepped foot in here.It's quaint, gothic, not pretentious in any way, and humbling. There are drinks only, it opens at like 6 or 7, seats probably less than 25, and pretty sure there is 0 menu. The server/bartender engages you with questions like ""what drinks do you typically enjoy? What are the flavors you're drawn to, and those that you absolutely will not have?""They take this info, and 10-15 minutes later a custom cocktail lands in front of you, to the likes you'll never have again.

I had a glass of wine so I didn't get too crazy but would love to try their cocktails on my next visit. Nice sexy vibes, once you get a seat (by the way, hostess was super bomb and did her job so well. Moved people fast and was very friendly) there was a girl her name started with a K ....(half the staff lol) she was amazing.  Tight space and gets crowded. Fast service and great bartenders.

21,,7/9/2017,293,,"Vancouver, Canada",Will L.,26,4.0,49,"Had a great time at this cute little speakeasy on a Friday night with my girlfriend. We found the entrance at the corner of the street only after asking someone who lived in the area where it was. We were greeted by a friendly bouncer and almost no line at around 10:00PM. Like some of the other review said, this place is quite dark and quite warm. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, however, as it really added to the ambience of the prohibition era bar. We put our names on the waitlist for a table and got one about 20 minutes later. As for the cocktails, we both got the bartenders choice. We told the bartender what we liked (and don't worry if you're not a cocktail connoisseur, the bartender was very friendly and not snobby at all) and he whipped us up to drinks with half a dozen ingredients each. Mine was called the Silver Fox and it had biscotti liqueur, gin, and egg whites and my girlfriend got the Dominican Maid with rum, cucumber, and sugar. Both were very different, but insanely good. I really liked this place and I will definitely come back!",1

The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because it was tremendously warm down there. And we all know once you start drinking it gets hotter. Other than the heat, the drinks were delicious and the service was also good. The waiter made great recommendations, and helped us figure out exactly what to drink. I wanted a Tom Collins and my fiancé wanted his usual Old Fashion. The waiter said let us make the variations for you. I promise you won't be disappointed, and we weren't. He came back with a Bee's Knees and a Monte Carlo. One is sweet and refreshing, the other was strong but smooth. We both sipped our drink by candle light and listened to the chatter all around us. It's pretty dark toward the back, so it makes somewhat romantic. Don't be shy and ask for the complimentary snacks! Oh and bring cash. It's cash only!",1

If you like whisky order an Old Fashioned, it's simply amazing! As soon as you get downstairs you can also have your name added to the list for a table and as soon as one is available they'll call you.Cash only, cocktails are $16.",

26,1,2/25/2017,438,4,"New York, NY",Tina W.,1240,3.0,908,"Location: this place is a very easy to be found as a speakeasy since there is always a line if u are there at 10pm. In fact, the line is largely due to the fact that the place is tiny and it takes time to get a table. We waited for about 30 mins to be seated as a group of 3. Drinks: drinks are fine compared to some other speakeasys but not the best for sure. The candles are very disturbing while you read the menu. We had Tennessee and genius of something. Tennessee is definitely sweeter compared to genuine of something.  Service is niceThey have prezel as snacks but do charge ur moneyWhat makes me dislike is the fact that they are cash only. Ugh Yeah: ughOverall: 3.5 Not too expensive - Ave is $19/person",5
27,,6/29/2018,169,,"Manhattan, NY",Elle R.,10,5.0,16,I absolutely love Little Branch. I've seen several reviews that have said they had a custom cocktail and I have to say that's my favorite part of this beautiful little bar. I asked for a blackberry martini and it is hands down the best cocktail I've ever had. The live jazz music makes this place one of the best spots to check out in NYC. I really appreciate that it's old classic jazz with a full sized bass and piano. Absolutely lovely. I reviewed Little Branch on my blog at wtelle.com/holeinthewall…. Check it out!,

There was an amazing jazz band playing the last time I was here, however the layout of the place kind of sucks. Zero room to hang at the bar on a busy night, and my date and I were seated at a table in the back that was sandwiched between service station and the tiniest walkway. Layout issues aside, these bartenders really know their stuff--Some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Everything I tried was crafted to perfection.Side note re: atmosphere... It's very dark and very warm, so dress accordingly and enjoy how great you will look in the candle light.

There's not much to the decor here at least not visibly anyways. It's just very dark. The drinks are good though. They were able to make my favorite cocktail, Ramos Gin Fizz, and it was delicious. I think compared to other speakeasies also a bit more on the affordable side. Recommend!",

The ambiance was cozy and intimate- we enjoyed it initially. The waitress got our order wrong and was very rude when I confronted her about it.

We went shortly after it opened, so there was no line outside (which actually made it more fun to find). The entrance is a simple, black door that leads you into a dimly lit, 1920s basement. We went straight for the bar and checked over the menu. The selection is really great, but we went with bartender's choice. After telling Luis I wanted whiskey, he made two of the best cocktails I've ever had. Very worth the $16 and cash only exchange. Ambience here is amazing. It's truly a throwback escape from the area above. We stayed at the bar the entire time, but they do have a small seating area with table service. It's also not overwhelming. There was plenty of space to stand and sip. As i mentioned, our service was excellent. Luis was an expert mixologist with a friendly demeanor. We loved chatting it up with him as we burned holes in our wallets. Overall, this is my favorite speakeasy thus far in the city.

I'll have to fight for my sexy table in my dark corner. I'll need to wait longer than 10 min to imbibe libations that contain nutmeg, almond and egg white. That's just--ugh--distressing.

They do give us free snacks like nuts or pretzels.  But here are the six drinks that were ordered that night:Dark and stormyBusiness up front Oliver TwistAberlour scotchTom Collins The BennetThe ones I personally ordered were the Business up front and the aberlour scotch.  Because I wasn't sure what I wanted, the bartender decided for me by giving me the Business up front during our first round of drinks: The business up front had honey, vodka, and something else.  Nonetheless, it was sweet which is what I wanted and it had plenty of alcohol.  The honey flavour came out strong, very soothing for a sore throat.  I had sips of our drinks and while I can't remember what they taste like, they all were good. None was watered down.  Because it's a speakeasy and not a bar, the drinks are more of a work of art and thereby calling for the high price.  The second drink was some aberlour scotch, made neat.  It was warming, deep, and perfect on a cold night.  Service was superb as the waiter came often enough to make sure we were comfortable and had enough to eat and drink.  Little Branch was an intimate and quiet experience, and I can't wait to go back.",6

There was complete darkness but for the flickering light of a single candle on each table. The ambience is perfect for this type of establishment.The drinks were excellent and the waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing. Ask for roasted nuts if you want to munch on something in between your drinks.So many good choices and if you can't decide, ask the bartender to whip up something.I give five star rating to places that not only impress me with their arts (paintings, sculptures, food, drinks, you name it) but also make me desperately want to come back.

It wasn't too hard to find; it's on the corner of the block and you will see a man standing in front ready to check your IDs. We arrived at around 8:30 so it was not too packed yet. My friends ordered a old fashioned, which they thought had too much bitters, which kicked them in the throat. For myself, I ordered a drink that is similar to an old fashioned (i forgot the name) but with citrus and lime in it. Not bad, but nothing extraordinary for $16 a drink.

There's a definite element of exclusivity here, if only for the fact that the bar is located in a completely unmarked, nondescript building with a bouncer guarding the door. Once given the go-ahead, you descend the steep steps to a (very cold) room that includes booths and a bar. They have a ton of cocktails along with complimentary snacks like mixed nuts and pretzels.

58,6,10/23/2015,860,4,"New York, NY",Molly T.,1415,5.0,443,"Little Branch holds a special place in my heart because unlike most of the places I've reviewed on Yelp, I first came here long before I joined the site that has since become a dangerously large part of my life. Speakeasies were still fairly new to me - I had been to two (Angel's Share and Raines Law Room) - prior to my first trip here, and was absolutely enamored with both. Little Branch was no exception. After coming here last night, I immediately remembered why I've been dying to return here. Unlike a lot of the speakeasies in the city, this place really really feels like one. Let me explain...Like Raines Law Room, Dear Irving, Death + Co and the like, Little Branch isn't hidden within another establishment - the entrance is simply an unmarked door accompanied by, yes, a bouncer. Unlike the aforementioned speakeasies, however, the exterior of this lovely little spot seems pretty run down. No glossy wooden doors here. The interior is just as satisfying. It's hard to put into words, but this place is equal parts sophisticated and rough around the edges. The bar area isn't particular nice. It's quite small relative to the bar setups at other speakeasies, but good things come in small packages, I assure you. Before you're seated at a table (there's usually a wait), there's what I can only call haphazardly-organized (that seems like an oxymoron but go with it..) seating options that you can plop yourselves down on while you wait. My first time here, I ended up sitting on some random steps towards the right side of the bar. Last night, it was the small, plush bench (not sure what else to call it) right by the hostess. You make do. Dim lighting, 1920s music playing softly in the background, bartenders who look like they're constantly having a grand old time...it's immersive. Which is what I look for in a speakeasy.I'm going to echo what pretty much everyone else has said here: ignore the menu. The menu isn't even that interesting, honestly. Just go with bartender's choice. Honestly, I'd recommend doing this at most speakeasies - for at least one drink. The guys behind the bar here are master mixologists so ya just gotta have faith. Last night, I got the East Side (pictured), which was the product of my request for a gin-based, herbaceous drink. Refreshing and delightful. You might not find ""_____ - infused such and such"" here, but I don't see that as a con. These drinks are refined and made with care. If you're curious like me, just watch the bartenders for a bit. They're efficient, knowledgeable and personable - what more could you ask for? Truly lovely. Other notes:-I wouldn't necessarily call this place ""sexy"", but it certainly is intimate. It's dark and candlelit - perfect date environment. I've only been to Little Branch with friends, but it seems like it's frequented by couples (prospective or actual, I don't know) often. -Little Branch is right off the 1 line, which is incredibly convenient for me. I'm a diehard west-sider, so I can get here without any subway headaches (though it's NYC, so ya never know)-Cocktails here *are* pricey ($15-$16), so keep that in mind. And CASH ONLY!",12

It would have been hard for me to find if not for my friends knowing the way. Its just a door on the corner. Apparently later it was pretty busy and there was a line outside which makes it fairly easy (and reportedly kills some of the magic). Its annoying that its cash only... and doesn't have a ATM. I don't care about cash only. I would at least like a place to get cash. Whatever, I used Venmo with my friends.The only annoying part is my wife came late to join our group and they wouldn't let her in. There were 4 people in front of her who didn't care if she cut them but the bouncer said no. He also said it was ""too crowded."" Granted, I don't know their rules and regulations, but there was  space. We were also a group of 10 so whats one more person. After texting (which was hard due to poor service since the bar is underground) I went upstairs and asked the bouncer to let me wife in. To his credit he said ""I can't separate love"" and let her in, but only after she waited a few minutes in the cold by herself for no reason (what bar doesn't let the lonely single blonde girl in?!?). We had drinks. It was more fun to watch them make then to drink but they weren't bad.The end.",1

68,7,7/13/2015,710,3,"Manhattan, NY",Sara L.,3377,5.0,534,"A review that I am so far behind on on what is perhaps one of my favorite cocktail bars in the city. I love speakeasies. Absolutely love them. And, there was hardly a reason for why I should not fall instantaneously in love with Little Branch. The entire secretive aspect is one reason, but their expertly crafted cocktails is another. Little Branch is one of my first speakeasy experiences, and my first memory here is a sweet one. I have ventured through many, many bars, and yet, this still remains to be one of favorite secret bars. Though I try to keep it secret, as of late, the popularity has clearly grown. Either way, you will be in for a surprise on your first (and hopefully) many visits.While you can opt for your usual cocktail, or something straight off the menu, Bartender's Choice ($13) should be the one and only option to go with when here. Specify your spirit or type of flavor, and they will masterfully craft a perfect cocktail for you based on your personal preference. Doing otherwise is almost a disservice to yourself. Even without full certainty for what you like, they can make solid recommendations. I have had a fair share of cocktails here, both requested off the menu or Bartender's Choice -- the East Side (Gin-based, tarty), Dominicana (Coffee-based, sweet), Brown Derby (Bourbon-based, sweet and sour), and Don Lockwood (Whiskey-based, smokey). All were amazing cocktail choices here. From sweet to tarty to smokey, I can guarantee they will make you only the most excellent drink based on your personal requests. It is fun to stand by the bar and watch them make cocktails, but for a more intimate experience, you will definitely want to sit in one of their cozy candlelit booths. This is certainly the ideal spot for a date, or an intimate meetup of any kind.Speaking of the space and atmosphere, it is a true speakeasy experience. An entrance with a discreet sign out front ultimately leads you into a dimly lit, comfortably cozy space that imbues roaring 20s. A bouncer at front will indeed ask for your ID, but otherwise, no passwords required. The seating arrangement is very intimate and perfect for conversation, especially on a more quieter night (which is honestly becoming rare these days, unless you come early). Little Branch is perfect if you are looking for a bit of romance and privacy. Regarding service, it can suffer and slow down a bit when it is a very busy night, which might be the one flaw I am starting to notice on my more recent visits. Overall, I can overlook this. Little Branch still remains one of my favorite speakeasy spots in Manhattan that beats a lot of other spots in the city when it comes down to their cocktails. If you are a serious cocktails connoisseur, please look no further. Note: Cash only.",7
69,6,2/25/2014,2242,3,"New York, NY",Lori L.,6802,4.0,603,"I had heard whisperings of this West Village speakeasy for months, and its association with Milk & Honey (which, as the first speakeasy I visited, is near and dear to my heart) was more than enough motivation to organize a trip here with a few other girls on a Friday night.Conveniently located off the 1-line, the entrance is an innocuous unmarked door on 7th Avenue. The telltale line that winds out from it, however, is more than enough of a giveaway: This place is worth waiting for. Around 9PM on a Friday evening, the four of us just managed to make it in without having to wait for a seat in the near-freezing weather. After showing our IDs to the bouncer, a short trip down the flight of stairs and towards the back of the room took us to our booth seats for the evening.  Dimmed lighting that is mainly sourced from the candles on the table, the chatter of other patrons, and a few mysterious old photographs along the walls was enough to set the ambiance for the night.Little Branch does have a drink menu, which will break out their cocktails by your spirit of choice. Deciding to forgo the pages and pages of options (which also include some tasty food options), I simply told the bartender that I wanted something gin-based, fruity, and sweet. As long as you know your drink preferences, it's very, very difficult to go wrong with the bartender's choice.In what seemed to be a brief amount of time, I was presented with the Bee's Knees - a delicately blended drink consisting of gin, lemon, and honey. It appeared rather small in portion, but, in what I consider to be the trademark of a good drink, the alcohol was cleverly disguised and it wasn't until a fair amount of time later that I started feeling the effects. Of note: The drinks here are delicious and strong.We were able to spend a few hours here, talking and laughing as the minutes ticked on by. Service throughout the evening was respectful and on point, and we never felt rushed or pressured to order additional cocktails. And while the $13 per drink and cash only policy may be a nuisance to some, I believe it's more than worth it. Come with good company and a little patience, and you'll be rewarded with some of the best drinks in the city.",9

Once at the bottom of the stairs, your'e greeted by history -- a speakeasy, complete with live jazz (at least the night I went). Find a booth and you can order whatever's on the menu, off the menu, or what I did - the bartenders choice. Give them a few hints of what you like and you're served something to tempt your palate. I gave them mine and it was a knock out of the park. That being said, really consider what flavors you're looking for. Citrus? Herbal? Sweet? Smokey?

72,14,6/9/2015,248,8,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",Sonya L.,2436,4.0,87,"A great little speakeasy that's perfect for an intimate date (who cares about the noise) or to meet up with some friends. It's small and crowded but a lot of fun. I love this place! From the exterior, you would not think Little Branch was nestled in a basement, but it is. Once you make your way down the stairs, it's like walking into a speakeasy from the 1920s. It's dark, cozy and kind of sexy. The walls are scattered with black and white photos and you'll probably find some instruments sitting nearby. The kind of place Hemingway or Fitzgerald would frequent. :)The bartenders here are dressed very chic with their cute little vests and suspenders. Oh and they make some really great drinks too! There is a small cocktail list available (a man's man type of list) but they'll customize a drink however you want it. I've never had a Swizzle before so I asked them to make mine with vodka (instead of gin or rum) and also to make it with cassis. It wasn't too strong (which was fine) but more on the refreshing side. I loved tasting the bits of berries towards the end! A good drink to keep you cool since it's so stuffy inside. My friend ordered a Pisco Sour, which was delicious. HELLO LOVER. Another first for me, so I ended up ordering one too. Those Peruvians knew what they were doing when they invented their amazing brandy! Yum!Seating is pretty limited so you'll have to put your name down for a table and wait. The tables are these small booths, off to one side, that will fit up to four people. At least that's what our table looked like. The booths have coat hooks (which is great during the winter) so you can hang your stuff to make more space. Look under your table if you need to charge your phone because you may get lucky with an outlet. ;) There's also some counter space, opposite the bar, where you can just stand and mingle with other patrons. Most people are standing anyways since it's usually packed. The bathroom is right by the counter space/standing area and it's co-ed. It's small and dimly lit (like the rest of the bar) but it's cute and kept fairly clean. For all you tall people, watch your head! I like that Little Branch provides several, clean hand towels as opposed to using paper towels. Very eco-friendly! They also use cloth coasters instead of paper, which is AWESOME. My inner Martha Stewart was totally geeking out, lol!The staff is really nice and work very diligently, despite how busy they are. The hostess working the night we were here was constantly refilling everyone's water glass throughout the evening. I forget her name but she was wonderful. I would say the only downside to this place would be the fact that it's stuffy (they only have a fan) and it's a cash only bar. Even so, I'll still patronize Little Branch. :)Remember Yelpers, CASH ONLY!",15

We went with two styles of bartender's choice and they were refreshing over ice but not particularly complex. We would've appreciated a description of the resulting concoctions, but at least they asked us two questions apiece to feel out our drinking preferences.

And I found the place to be everything an underground, speakeasyesque, we're-partying-like-it's-1920-in-2013-place is supposed to be.  There's that establishment I've been in San Diego a few times ( yelp.com/biz/prohibition… ) that gives the speakeasy concept a good go for its money, but delivers 80% (hence *their* 4-star rating).  Little Branch, however, has got the concept, A to Z, down pat like they was Sajak.It was easy to spot the entrance that led down to Little Branch because of the little line aside the building, a line leading to the apex of a corner containing a metal door.  Doorman was a friendly guy and felt confident enough about himself, his employer, and his clientele that he didn't feel the need to go any version of The Rules (like at the aforementioned SD establishment) although we did find that he doesn't drink or eat anything with hooves.  The wait was maybe 5-10 minutes to get in; all good, since this particular December evening featured merciful weather.Down in this little T-shaped room there's a bar and an area with tables, with a gentleman managing a table waitlist.  After a one-cocktail wait, while lingering in the area by the jazz band setting up, we got seated.  I almost preferred ordering from the bar, not from the lack of attention from our friendly waitress, but because this was one of those places where the bartenders are damn glad to know you and show you the various ways they can twist, bend, shake up, and smack around some of your favorite cocktails.  And they did, both when I was heading in the Manhattan and Mule directions.The jazz band was really talented with a real piano, and had the volume on the level of just right.A good night.And thank you, again, Yelp reviewers.",2

That is, run by people who staffed guys a half block away to communicate who was coming in via some sort of hand-held device. The year was 1923. It was after hours. Lies. The year was possibly 70 years past that. Party went from 4am (NY bar closing time) til 9am. And it was all not necessarily uh, above the table. And I think goombahs might have been involved.That's all I'm saying. So, enough about *that* incarnation of 22 7th Ave S! Little Branch is an easy 5 Yelp star establishment. It's got all of what I adore about my favorite cocktail lounge, Milk & Honey (its old, terribly dark and sexy space) but more!... as in space! The old Milk & Honey required reservations even on what you'd think would be a typically slow night due to its tiny size, but I could never complain about not getting one because they were small and it was just oh-so-worth the chance that you may or may not get in! Little Branch is just big enough and designed *perfectly* to retain the intimacy while allowing for immediate booth seating on a Monday night!I'm going to plagiarize a line from my Milk & Honey review -There's the feeling that you've just stepped in on a secret that happened 90 years ago.Not because it's such a great line, but it seriously holds true here, too. Descend, denizens, into Little Branch's luscious lair, one flight below ground. I love bars that are so dark you wouldn't even recognize a person you've been stalking sitting in the booth next to you (not that I'd ever do such a thing, of course). I love bars that are so dark you need a candle to see the menu. By the way, screw the menu (except for the page that I took a photo of, because it's pretty awesome) and ask the waitress for the bartender to surprise you. I told our fabulous waitress that I loved ginger beer anything and was soon presented with what the bartender named a Ginger Roger (see photo), featuring Gosling rum, cognac and their house made ginger beer. Superb! I of course had to have another.Drinks were consumed. Sparkling conversation was had. And so goes down on the books, a new favorite cocktail lounge for Yours, Truly.",8

Price tag of $16 cash only is a bit steep but one can rationalize that this is NYC and they are carefully crafted cocktails. They also have the prohibition theme down as it's in a dimly lit basement with period relevant music playing in the background. I told the bartender what I wanted. He said it wouldn't taste good and suggested something else. My drink was OK, but it was rum based and I usually don't drink rum which wasn't part of our conversation. His attitude was on the colder side and he seemed to just want to bang out a drink. We were able to get a seat in one of the booths. Service was overly attentive where we felt like we weren't drinking fast enough. There were two girls and one came over to ask us if we wanted more drinks every 3 minutes. Service is important but not to the point that you feel rushed to keep ordering rounds or leave.  Like I said before - I liked it, just didn't love it.  Maybe next time I will try with a smaller group and not on a Saturday for a more intimate vibe.",2
83,1,4/13/2015,320,,"Manhattan, NY",Laura O.,28,5.0,529,"I believe that the cocktail gods came together and all the stars in the booziverse aligned  in order to give me a most wonderful night at Little Branch. I mean, the staff, the venue and the drinks definitely helped, but some of these things just don't normally happen. Take, for example, my experience in line, which left me feeling a little VIP. I arrived at about 8:30, and two of my friends were already downstairs at the bar waiting for a table. I texted my friends but still got in line, as I was pretty sure I wouldn't be let in in front of a bunch of people just because my friends were in there, and I didn't want to look like an asshole. After a few minutes, however, a man appears from downstairs, calls my name, and tells me my table is ready. Apparently, when my friend were told a table was available, they explained that I was still in line, and the waiter volunteered to come upstairs and get me. How nice/awesome is that?Inside of Little Branch, it is atmospheric, romantic, and so dark you have little chance of reading the menu unless you have a flashlight app (yay, we did). A few points about the menu:-Each page has a different thing going on. One includes classic cocktails, another is for LB-invented drinks, etc. Of note was a page dividing classic drinks not by liquor base but by other ingredients (lemon, lime, and ginger beer). -The most important page is the one reminding you about the complimentary hard pretzels (so good) and peanuts. The drinks here were so good that I had three. I never do that in cocktail bars because they are so expensive, but I seriously couldn't help myself. (Also, at $14 each, they're ever-so-slightly cheaper than most other speakeasies). I had the following:-Honey whiskey fix: Rye whiskey, honey and lemon served over a LOT of crushed ice-Bronco buster: Applejack, rye whiskey, curaçao, and fresh lemon-Rye fizz classic: Rye whiskey, lemon, sugar, soda water and egg white.-(Also sampled friends' drinks including a lime daiquiri and blackberry something or other, both excellent)I swear, I had no idea I ordered rye whiskey in each of my drinks until I sobered up the next morning. Regardless, they were all well worth the price. LB seems to be more about creating a quality classic drink using simple ingredients rather than procuring obscure ingredients and using complicated methods. I think both types of bars are great to have. My only small complaint is that it would've been nice to see a mezcal-based drink on the menu.The rest of the staff was as lovely as the gentleman who fetched me. They agreed to take our picture, kindly answered lots of cocktail questions that didn't always make sense, and most of all, they did not rush us. Not one bit. Not after 1/2 of our party left, not while we were in between drinks, and not even while my friend took a very long time at the ATM next door. They just let us languish pretty much as we pleased, which I really appreciated. Thanks for being awesome, Little Branch and everyone affiliated with it!",2

The vibe of place and the way the hostess was dressed mades me feel like I had traveled in time to the prohibition Era with a laid back vibe. The menu had a nice selection of drinks. In addition, they could make any drink you desired or offer a suggestion based on your cravings. I gave this location 4 stars because they advertised that they open at 7pm.

103,11,8/3/2015,497,9,"New York, NY",Eric J.,1710,5.0,923,"I used to frequent Little Branch A LOT when I first moved to Manhattan years ago. Not that I could actually afford to go that much at the time, but a college buddy of mine knew the entire staff (bartenders, doormen, etc.) because he would go there after work pretty much everyday, and soon, he could just walk in with whomever he wanted with some sort of custom-made entrance token. Don't ask me how to obtain said token, I'm just assuming that he just got it by frequenting the place as much as he did. Anyways, I had just moved to Hell's Kitchen, and he was always asking me to make my way down to either Little Branch or Silver Lining (R.I.P.) to hang with him after a terrible date experience, and as a result, he would always pay for my drinks while he vented to me. I always felt guilty riding his coattails, but who was I to refuse? I was a very impressionable young professional, and skipping lines and receiving free drinks always makes you feel like a baller in New York City. And not to mention, Little Branch is definitely one of those establishments where you'll have to wait in line on the weekends (even weeknights sometimes too). I hadn't been back in about 2 years, and a recent visit made me very nostalgic for old times, even though my buddy has long moved away, token and all, and I was now the person bringing dates here (and paying for their drinks, heh). I'm far from a regular now, but it still feels so familiar after all these years. Okay, done with the nostalgia.When you finally get the very nondescript door, and make your way down the stairs, you'll be greeted by a rather small bar area with a few booths. The dim lighting really puts you in the mood for a good cocktail. One of the few ultimate date spots in West Village, nay, the entire city. I recommend letting one of the bartenders make you a custom drink, rather than going through the menu. Just let them know what spirits and flavors you enjoy, and you'll likely get something pretty spectacular. The bartenders are super professional and they won't judge your weird tastes, heh. Prices are very typical for the high-end cocktails in the city, around $13-14, depending on the spirit. Remember that it's cash only, so bring that huge stack of $20 bills not only to, again, look like a baller, but also not to look like a fool for not being able to pay for your drinks. I can't say I'll still frequent Little Branch as much as I used to, as the amount of traffic coming into the bar is much greater than it used to be, and there are many new, innovative cocktail bars popping up all around Manhattan. However, if I'm in the area, and the line is non-existent, I'll definitely pop in for a craft cocktail.",11

Last night- we were finally able to come in on a random Tuesday night. Once you're in, you notice the dim lighting and small, intimate atmosphere. Definitely not the best places for large groups (no more than groups of 4, 5 maybe). Since it was myself and two others, we decided to just stand at the bar. First thing that hit us was CASH ONLY. Yup, one of the best cocktail lounges in NYC doesn't accept cards. mind blown. But we were carrying some cash so we were able to squeeze away with one drink. They do have live music here which is a nice touch, but I can't really judge the drinks since we were only able to have one drink each. I had a pisco sour and quite frankly, i've had better. Nothing about this one amazed me the way it should've considering all the hype behind little branch. Maybe I came with a tad bit high expectations? Possibly.

I'm not a russian millionaire who carries hundos around like it's nothing. when you're at the $14/drink price point, just fucking take cards already.the signs in the bathroom are pretentious and sort of dumb. if it was printed off of a computer last night, it's not really giving me a vintage feel. the whole speakeasy thing is sort of played out.  you can't fault them too much for that since it's their whole deal, but it's still played out, and done better elsewhere in terms of the style/look/feel. the Raines Law Room, for example, is awesome. PDT is located so that if you decide you don't want to drink you can get a hot dog. little branch...meh.(also, my biggest beef with the speakeasy thing: being lit from below by candlelight makes most people look like crap, making little branch weirdly terrible for dates. some speakeasy type places do the candle-in-alcove or candle-in-lantern thing and it's much better, but Little Branch is all spooky horror show being lit from below, and I don't like it, no I don't.)(also this bar has the highest proportion of old guys on dates with much younger women I've ever seen. why is that? is it supposed to impress them with the coolness + expensive factor? IDGI)so on to the major thing: the drinks, which are supposed to be oh-so-good. they are not. they are largely disappointing. I tried 4 different drinks and 3 of them were really not all that interesting or tasty. they were also not super strong. they were also all $14+ and for that price they should be excellent and strong. the martinis are GREAT though. IF YOU GO HERE HAVE A MARTINI. I have never had a better martini. unfortunately, I did not order a martini, and only ad a tiny taste of it, and mostly had to suffer with a couple of inferior drinks. their menu is huge, which is nice and all, but if you can't make the drinks superlative, don't put them on your menu. it's no Clover Club in this sense -- Clover Club has like 100 drinks and they're all incredible. if you can't do that then don't try.overall, this place seems like it's resting on its reputation and you can do better for the price.",2

After dinner on a snowy night in Manhattan, we crossed the street to head to Little Branch which usually has a line wrapped around the corner. As we descended into the bar, I was so excited to finally come here! To be honest, I am a bit lazy and the long line outside always deters me. Inside was packed and we put our name on the list to be seated. In the meantime, we ordered up some drinks at the bar: I got myself a mulled cider (I needed something to keep warm in the snowstorm), and Shing, a Bartender's Choice for something sweet, sour and refreshing. Although we were still waiting to be seated, it was nice that we could enjoy our drinks at e bar. We eventually found somewhere to sit for the remainder of our drinks. I really liked mine, but I do love me a good cider.This is definitely a very cozy spot, perfect for dates or somewhere to catch up over drinks. If you are tall, just watch your head as the ceilings are on the lower side. The bartenders are all dressed in retro garb, equipped with arm bands and buttoned up vests for the whole prohibition experience.

I quickly noticed how strong the drinks were (should've eaten dinner beforehand, rookie mistake). The ""bartender's choice"" was a lot of fun, as we ended up sampling all sorts of flavors from a spicy ginger drink to a sweet honey and lime one.

It's hard to find the door but it's at the end of the street at a point on the first floor. They unfortunately didn't open their doors for about 20 minutes after they said they were going to open and it was cold and rainy outside so that is the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of ;. Everything else once I entered was perfection. The hostess was very nice and we got an excellent table without a reservation. The place was packed in about 30 minutes so definitely make reservations in advance. The booth was comfy with some privacy. The ambiance was not too loud and not too dark with a waiter who was not too annoying. There are a few specialty cocktails but they honestly didn't look too good so we all did the bartender's choice. I told them I liked vodka, rum, or gin, drinks that are slightly fruity but not too sweet, filled with ginger, and on ice. My drink was amazing and perfectly fit that criteria. The drinks are pricey at $16 or so but filled with liquor and you pay for the ambiance. Definitely check out this awesome bar!",

I was pretty comfortable at the steps with my drink. The live music is great, I loved it so much.5 drinks later and here's the catch, the entire bar is cash only! The drinks were around $30-$40 I believe. We had no idea this time around, and I had to awkwardly cross the street and pick up 5 drinks worth of cash from an ATM at a different bar. I'd never keep that much cash with me normally. Otherwise the drinks are really good, and the bartenders seem to genuinely enjoy creating them for us. This is a really great bar!

It's pretty easy to miss this place, so make sure you're looking carefully at all of the doors as you get close to the address! I liked the drinks here a lot, but the vibe is just the tiniest bit off. It's almost too intimate and contained-everyone here seems to be very engrossed in their own conversations, which detracts a little bit from the overall coziness of the entire place. Furthermore, it is super dim which added to the mysteriousness of the speakeasy but felt almost too dim. There is both booth seating and bar seating, which makes the place more spacious. The quality of the drinks alone are definitely enough to make me a fan, but personally not as much a fan of the decor/vibe inside.",

I will say that if your gonna be a cocktail bar, please invest in some better glassware.

When we finally got down the stairs the staff was not friendly. My husband tried to ask the bartender about any history this bar has(we heard it used to be a speakeasy?) and he said that it was never a speakeasy... that it's just a bar in a basement. -_- Well fuck. We got our drinks and this is why they get 2 stars instead of 1, is because the drinks taste good... but they're SMALL. I walked away from the bar with my drink to check out the place and little more, looking around at the booths and stuff, and some waitress told me I couldn't be over there... told me I needed to move back to the bar.. and she wasn't nice about it either.

The bartender blatantly over charged me, and when I asked him about it, he said that the prices on the menu change and proceeded to miscalculate the total again (only 2 drinks, so not difficult math!) Pretty bad business practice for a few extra dollars at the end of the night. I know other bartenders that would rock this place!

Got drinks at the bar, and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 3 to open up. Little Branch has a similar vibe and the standard drinks as other well known joints in New York at similar prices ($13 per pop, cash only). I always like the ginger chews at these places, as they always provide a refreshing solid treat when paired with the cocktails. I think what stood out most during my visit was the live jazz band! Usually the jazz music at these places end up becoming background music. Maybe it's because we sat really close to them, but the awesome tunes during our night allowed us to both enjoy the music when we wanted to and have conversation without having to raise our voices.

The taproom was dark.  The crowd was varied.  Everyone was chillin, having a good time.  The bartenders and everyone working at this joint were dressed like it was the 20's. Perfect glossy hair, suits, trousers worn with matching suspenders over white well fitting shirts. I have to say the men here were beautiful, but I'm a sucker for a well groomed man. The cocktails were authentic old school recipes. I've never heard of egg whites going into a whiskey sour before... Watching the bartenders work was completely entertaining. They used these huge ice cubes and drinks were served with this really cool steel straw/spoon/stirrer thing. I realized that the reason this joint is unmarked and secret is to authenticate what visiting a speakeasy may have been like back in the day. I had the most amazing cocktail ever here.

I suggest putting your name on the list as soon as you get there or call ahead to see how packed it is. There are not many tables. The place is dark and intimate in keeping with a speakeasy theme and makes as a great date place. It does get loud, so probably not ideal for having a big group to talk to. Now the drinks are very, very good. The bartenders are all fantastic! Ask them for suggestions or their choice and you'll love it. I usually ask them to surprise me with some gin cocktail and it's always amazing. They have an extensive menu as well, with lots of great choices. One downside is it does get very packed and you will have to wait for awhile if it's a popular night. It helps if you know someone with a key.

We were a group of four girls so it was perfect for their cubby booths while I noticed the group behind us had 6 people and they had to wait a while. The bouncer was funny and he may try some cheap shots at you while checking your ID but I just laughed and went along with it as I was glad I didn't have to wait. Send your final texts before going down because there is no cell phone reception down there. I love that they don't try to fill up the place as much as possible. When all the tables are filled, they don't let any more people in. It may not be good for everyone waiting outside in the cold but inside, it's good because it's easy to walk around as it does not get too crowded. I have read other reviews that said this place smells like a pool and they were right. There was a distinct chlorine smell as I was walking down the stairs. The decor was interesting and very antique looking. The booths were lit by very old looking candles and there were black and white framed pictures throughout. All of the cocktails on the menu were $13 each but we decided to tell the bartender what we liked and have him make a drink for us. I told him I would like something with tequila and egg whites. He came back with a cocktail that had just that with cucumber as well. At first I cringed because I tend to not like cucumber in general, much less in my drink but I decided to stay open minded. I ended up really liking it and the cucumber taste wasn't too overwhelming. Something to note is that they are cash only.

From an extensive cocktail menu, I chose the Oliver Twist, or a gin martini with an olive and a twist of lemon. Well-mixed, with an olive at the bottom and a fresh-looking lemon peel bridging the divide over a strong current that would soon wash over my body, it took me the full two hours that we are there to finish.Old music, gently playing in the background, added just the right touch to an already agreeable ambiance.",

My Saturday night date took me here and I loved it! It sounds like there's usually a line outside the door - that wait time wasn't too bad. But then with drinks in hand, we waited about 45 minutes inside to get a seat. It's crowded, but once you're sitting, it's easy to spend time and enjoy this place for everything it is - an incredibly classy speak-easy that takes you back to the 20's with the best cocktails!I left the decision making to the bartender. My request was simply something fruity. He came back after a few minutes with a beautiful orange cobbler. I'm not sure what spirit he used, it was probably bourbon - not excessively sweet, just so refreshing and easy to drink. I also got a Tom Collins - yummy! I love citrus cocktails and this place does it right. What else should you know? It's cash only and the lighting is so dim you gotta hold a candle up to the menu to read it. Haha.

Mine was so direct and harsh I had to wait for the ice to melt in order to better enjoy it.If you're not sensitive to the taste of alcohol and just want to get more bang out of your buck, then this might be a good speakeasy to start off at as we were buzzing much faster than usual.

A well established ""speakeasy"", Little Branch does not try that hard to be cool or hidden. There is no secret password, no stealth ninja handshake, no unlisted phone number, and no membership card. They don't care what kind of purse you are wearing, or which hedge fund you work for. All you have to do is show up. And that's part of the beauty. Because so many places are irritating in their shallow quest for exclusivity, Little Branch stands out because they just want to make amazing cocktails.There is an unmarked door, and a bouncer at the top of the stairs. The bouncer is strictly there to make sure it does not get too crowded. And when you eventually get to the head of the line, and gingerly head down the stairs into the basement lair, you're met with REAL LIVE SPACE. It's not overly crowded like some popular cocktail dens (Employees Only I am looking your way...). There is no drunk 22-year-old B&T bumping into you and pretending not to notice. You can actually breathe, have a seat at the bar, and enjoy your cocktail.And the cocktails here really are great. My personal favorite is the Tom Collins, which is served in a tall thin glass with a tall thin log of an ice cube. It's adorned with a chilled metal combination straw-spoon, a contrast to the warm candlelit room.My only complaint is that the line system and crowd control is really a double-edged sword: sometimes the line is too damn long.

Swallow the red pill and escape into the real world of high end quality cocktails in adult surroundings reminiscent of an old 1930's speakeasy. Be forewarned that once you stumble down into the rabbit hole you might just want to stay with Alice for awhile and buy her a few luscious libations.Yes, I took the red pill as I always do when it comes to Speakeasies. Happily I might add, as there is just something that tingles the senses to have your mind and taste buds think that you are entering a secret denizen of prohibited cocktail enjoyment. Hey, we all know that the cat is out of the bag when it comes to these spots here in NYC, but the drink connoisseurs among us still appreciate a well made cocktail, even if it means shelling out a few more clams for it. From the nondescript hidden entrance ways, to the dimly lit rooms, to the small spaces, to the pressed tin roof, to the bartenders wearing bow ties and suspenders, to the unusual liquor lists, to the old-timey music playing quietly in the background, those of us who appreciate a place like Little Branch can sip on an expertly mixed drink in an atmosphere that throws one back to another time and place. It's the civilized way to drink. Oh, and go into the bathroom and read the list of rules on the wall and adhere to them. One thing I have learned over my time here in NYC is to try and hit these places up early in the evenings, and on mid-week days if possible. Weekends are usually a mad crush of people, and long frustrating waits. We came to Little Branch on a Wednesday night right around opening at 7pm. I had arrived first and walked right down the narrow stairway to a darkly lit intimate bar with the soft sounds of old jazz being played in the background. I took a spot at the tiny bar area to have a drink while waiting for my fiancee', and struck up a conversation with the bartender. After a few whiskey based drinks (Get the bartender's choice. Always get the bartender's choice. Trust me.) She arrived and we took a spot at a booth in one of the far corners. The place itself is small and a bit claustrophobic, but cozy at the same time. Old piano sits in the corner, and you could feel the vibrations of the passing subway trains underground. Loved it. Our waitress came over and took our orders. I noticed that they will also offer free Bazzini nuts and pretzels when asked and two large trays were placed on our table. Nice touch.As for the drinks I just have to say they were some expertly made cocktails. Period. We tried many. Maybe a few too many. From old-school Brandy Alexanders, to some bourbon based drinks - a damn tasty Sazerac, a delicious Gold Rush - and some others I can't recall as things got a bit fuzzy at that point.  I think we also had one called a Penicillin. These drinks are strong, as they should be, and don't skimp on the high octane booze. Also be forewarned that it's cash only here, so hit up the ATM for a wad before you arrive. By the time we left we were sufficiently inebriated to say the least. Climbing up those stairs on the way out were an execution in teetering and tottering. Again, I loved the drinks and whole experience here and can't wait to go back.Expert mixology in a slightly eccentric location with terrific service and a dimly lit quiet atmosphere made for a wonderful cocktail experience. Oh, and always make sure to tip your bartenders well. On the way out I went over to the bartender I met while first waiting and shook hands goodbye. He slipped me a ""special wooden coin"" that I will treasure as it assures entrance ahead of the line at any time. Worth it's weight in gold.When I awoke the next morning hungover and bleary eyed I wondered if it was a dream, or was this reality for real.I know Kung Fu!",19

I was particularly taken with some variation of a ginger fizz, crafted with care and little pretentiousness. A wait for a table on a weekend evening can top a half hour, but the coziness of the bar and the swiftness of the service make any time spent drinking at Little Branch exceedingly special.",8

You can come with a party of 4, order the exact same thing (a la Tequila/Mezcal with Ginger or cayenne pepper) and the bartender will serve 4 unique cocktails somehow slightly tailored to each person. I've actually had that happen a few times.",2
159,2,11/9/2012,2140,1,"Sunnyvale, CA",Kathy D.,541,4.0,1125,"CASH ONLY!Interesting to have a speakeasy ask for cash only.  But if you think about it, it's like taking you back to the old days where the plastic never came into mind. Clever Clever but for drinks that expensive, it makes it hard for anyone to automatically have cash on hand!Came here on a thursday night and waited about 20 minutes.  The crowd easily goes in and out so it wasn't that bad.  I didn't know they had live music which makes Little Branch stand out that much more compared to the other speakeasies that I have been to.  Live music runs from M-TH since weekends they would need that extra space for their patrons.  The music definitely helps transport you back into the old prohibition era.  The bartenders are dressed in suspenders and definitely looks like they know their stuff.  I opted for the bartender's choice, with my choice of spirit: whiskey.  He whipped out a 19th century drink for me, which had a hint of citrus, sort of like a sidecar but it was nonetheless delicious and potent.  Seating is available but the whole time I was there, which was about an hour, my name never got called from the list.  Thankfully, they have the bar area to just sit and hang out even if you don't want to wait for a table.  The space is a bit awkwardly shaped, which makes Little Branch seem stuffy and small.  Staff was very courteous and attentionate here.  I can't help but love NY speakeasies because they have such unique features to each and every one of them.",3

With a nostalgic feel, Lil' Branch had an intimate and buzzing energy surrounding its bar. Located in the basement, with a cool and swanky but cozy vibe, our hostess seated us in a tall green colored booth. Right after we were seated, she presented us immediately with the menu and boy oh boy were there a lot to choose from!!!!My guy friend ordered one of their whiskey concoctions, while my girlfriend and I ordered their drink of the evening. Initially, I didn't notice that they offered that as an option but after trying her drink, I was instantaneously hooked and had to order my own and it was freaking delicious!The waitress told us what it was called, but unfortunately, my memory was lacking that evening so I don't remember the name. All I can say is that the drink was creamy, slightly sweet and it was very strong! It was so potent that I actually had to drink it slowly just so I can enjoy the complexity and flavor of each sip!Being that this was my first time to Lil' Branch, I really couldn't have asked for more. The location was great and the energy was pumping! If you have never been here, then you should really consider, especially if you're just looking for a good time!!!",3

If you do not come out of Little Branch with a little sheen on your face, I'm sorry to tell you but you are in fact dead. Is Little Branch heaven or hell then? The drinks will give you the impression that it is heaven. The wait time for a table and pressing tightly of hot, sweaty bodies will suggest it's hell. Actually, that last part might be more heaven than hell for some of you.A teeny bit claustrophobic for me but Little Branch is still a great place to mingle and enjoy the company of good friends. Make sure they're good friends as you will probably have to sit very close to one another for a long time while waiting for a table. We were reduced to sitting on the stone steps in the tiny bar area since the 3 (maybe 5?) tall chairs were taken. Knees were knocking and rubbing past one another left and right. I mean geez, the guy sitting next to me started telling me how the freckle above my left knee is so cute and sexy... THAT's how close you are to people. In dim lighting. See what I mean?You get my point now I hope. While waiting for his lady, my friend Garrett and I had a few cocktails in that tiny bar area. Now, the party had already started over at Swine with a Pig in the City cocktail so Little Branch was just continuing the marathon. Forgive me for my awful memory. I know I had something called a Strawberry Gold Rush at some point. Maybe some African Flower? Or an American something?? Who comes up with these names!!! And who remembers them. I'd make an awful bartender. Our really cute bartenders worked feverishly but with precision to give us all of our fabulous drinks for the evening.Finally scoring a booth after what seemed like an eternity and Garrett slipping the host a tip like a boss, the drinks just kept coming. And coming. And coming. And then I think they came some more. That's where things get a tad fuzzy and the conversation delved deeper and deeper down the twisted fantasy rabbit hole of libation. Sure, I regretted it slightly the next day when I woke up more thirsty than a desert but I must say, I do love tumbling down rabbit holes.",3
163,,8/3/2013,446,,"Manhattan, NY",Cat S.,0,2.0,371,"We went on a Friday night and tried to beat the crowd by going at 9:30, which is fairly early for NY standards. The bouncer told us it would be a 20 minute wait - it turned out to be a 45 minute wait. And unfortunately, Little Branch does not do what some other speakeasies do which is take your number and call you when there's a table available.When we finally get downstairs, there are of course no tables. The friendly hostess told us it would be another 40 minute wait for a table. Since we already waited for so long, we decided to at least get a drink. The cocktail list was very, very limited for a speakeasy. I don't generally like to get cocktails bespoke unless the bartender knows me well, but since there were so few options on the house specialty list, I decided to ask the bartender to make me something with gin and ginger beer, and it was mediocre - the ginger flavoring was so strong it burnt my throat. I think we would've enjoyed it more if the wait wasn't so long, but there are still many better speakeasy options or even cocktail bar options for those looking for a nice cocktail in a laid-back place.",

The bartenders are super friendly and definitely know what they're doing. I told them I liked whiskey with citrus and I got a delicious cocktail that was slightly spicy yet still tangy. I also tried a fruity rum drink, and it's definitely a lot stronger and more complex than ""fruity rum drink"" would suggest. The place is pretty awesome. Also, it's a helluva lot easier to get into here than it is to get into PDT so no gnashing of teeth woohoo!",2

168,,1/17/2015,88,,"Woodside, NY",Devin S.,13,4.0,255,"I like that you can still grab drinks at the bar while waiting for proper seats/tables to open up. This helps keep the line and waiting time outside short, which is always appreciated and certainly helps keep up the speakeasy vibe. As a testament to that, I didn't even know about this spot despite working a few blocks away for 4 years until a friend suggested it for a drink back in December. The prices are what you should expect to pay at any similar cocktail joint, and they're strong. My experience has been mixed when telling the bartender to choose for me, though. Truthfully on drinks alone I'd only give 3 stars in comparison to similar establishments, but I really prefer Little Branch's overall ambiance and setup inside. Two two-tops are very cozy and intimate and make good use of the limited space. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a group, but for two people it's perfect.",1

If only I had a bar like this in my hometown.  This place is supposed to be like a speakeasy.  Not that I lived in the 20s but I imagine the ambiance was similar.  The place doesn't have a sign above the door and you walk down to a basement like area.  The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are all dressed in clothes from the 20s.  I thought that was all really cool.  We got their really early (8-9ish) and didn't have to wait to get a booth but I hear it's close to impossible to get a seat any later than that.  I wasn't sure what I wanted so I told the waitress what I liked (vodka... not too sweet... not too strong) and she brought me the most delicious drink I've ever had.  My friends did the same and were all very pleased with the result.  Apparently they're known for their talent with being able to create drinks from your likes.  My friends and I had a great time here.  There's music playing in the background but not so loud you can't have conversation.  I would definitely suggest coming here for some great drinks and conversation with your friends.,1

The subterranean bar is unmarked and even the steps leading down to the space is nothing remarkable. Depending on the night there might be a line to get in but considering that this place has been written about even in travel sections of magazines it's still relatively easy to get in. On a recent Saturday night at midnight it was about a 10 minute wait outside and another 10 minutes to get seated. No advanced phone calls or other gimmicks necessary. The actual space is a bit awkward in terms of space configuration but the front bar area has enough room for patrons to get lessons in libations while waiting for a booth. Once seated the cozy booths and dim lighting lend to an atmosphere perfect for an intimate and romantic date. And with the great drinks you won't want to leave. The cocktail list is excellent but for an even better experience ask for bartender's choice or tell your waiter your pick of ingredient and they'll come up with bespoke cocktails.

He whipped up three delicious drinks, the boys gave me the sweet drink because, of course, and I really enjoyed it.The place is darling, the live band was an incredible touch.The bathroom was tiny and dark Also note!! This place is CASH ONLY!! Plan accordingly",1
192,,8/17/2014,184,,"Montclair, NJ",Nicole G.,432,5.0,111,I've passed by the door on endless occasions and this was my first time in. The place is down some steep set of stairs and lets you out into an unusually tiny bar space/area. The mirror on end of the bar gives an illusion of more room but unless you snag a stool you better be comfortable getting to know the people around you via the occasional body rub. There is a dining area and I was bummed we didn't grab anything to nosh on. Maybe next time.The bartender we had was just magical. He is in a zone and all you need to sinks tell him the kind of drinks you usually like. He mixed me some delicious concoction with a block of ice and sent me on my way. This is no typical bar to order shots or basic chain restaurant drinks. This is a place for actual mixology know how. I'd definitely come back to start off AND come back to end my night here.,1
193,,4/2/2016,4,,"New York, NY",John S.,0,2.0,62,"Nothing great about this place.  You are sitting in a small basement.  Saturday night around midnight and there was no music.  Bouncer was a real dirt bag.  He looked dirty with a beard, jeans and dirty old jacket.  He asked my friend and I whether we were going to cause any problems if we were let in.  We both had suits on.  I couldn't understand why he would even ask us that.  I've never been asked that by any bouncer /doorman in my entire life.",
194,1,6/5/2014,288,,"New York, NY",Lu H.,1933,2.0,552,"Uh so the cocktails were decent, but I cant stand cash-only places (especially at this price range). Also it's so dimmly lit that I cant see a thing and there's no A/C so on a decently muggy day, forget about it. Tons of other places like this.",1
195,1,3/24/2014,70,,"Pittsburgh, PA",Marta N.,27,2.0,114,"Heard a good bit about this place.  Waited in line for about 30 minutes to get inside.  That didn't bother me, because it was supposed to be great.  Not so great.The place had no charm.I could turn my basement into a better speakeasy. The drinks were decent enough, but honestly, I was wondering about all the other places I could have been trying, as we stood there, squished between a woman wearing itchy fur, and a group of annoying dudes that don't know how to handle their drink.I just expected more, and I think with the wait, and high price tag, you should get it.",2
196,1,12/26/2011,608,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",May L.,229,3.0,466,"If you are on a quest to try all the speakeasies than yes, you need to stop by Little Branch. That said, I can't give it high marks relative to others. The Door:  It's a process.  Come early and it's less of a problem. Later it becomes a bit of a show.The Atmosphere:  I am not a fan of the tables which result in limited seating for large parties.  They were super nice about allowing more than the limit for us, but that was because someone in our party knew the owner.  The bar is just a bar and standing room.  Very college-esque.  I'm just too old to stand around like that.The Mixology:  It's ok. It's not amazing like some of the others on my ""Hide & Seek"" list.  I had them make a cucumber drink.  The bartenders are competent.  It's just not as creative as a few other places on my hide and seek list.I just don't think it's quite relaxed enough for my tastes.  There is no theme, other than a hidden underground bar.  I feel like the others just do so much more to make it interesting.",4
197,,2/18/2016,42,,"Washington, DC",Roshni P.,8,5.0,31,it was worth the wait. We got here around midnight on a Saturday night and waited for about 20 mins. But it was definitely worth it. Our bartender Louis was excellent he made us drinks based on what we liked. My drink had so many ingredients but it was out of the  world. I got one drink with egg whites and another sort of similar to a Pisco Sour. No other cocktails can ever match those.,
198,,1/24/2016,7,,"New York, NY",Jason W.,0,5.0,21,The drinks are the best in the city. Candle lit 1920s speak easy.,
199,,3/10/2014,22,,"Brooklyn, NY",Emily F.,1,5.0,21,"What's to say that hadn't already been said? I had my first hot toddy (toddie?) here and have since come back for repeats. No one makes their drinks like they do. And live jazz to boot! Swoon!It's a great little bar with friendly but out of your way service that just can't be beat. The fact that I live a hop, skip and a jump away adds to the allure, but the bar is exemplary anyway.  Oh. Get there when they open.",2
