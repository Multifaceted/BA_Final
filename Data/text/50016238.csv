0,Elena M.,"Leonia, NJ",30,147,300,4.0,10/21/2018,"This place gets VERY crowded on Sundays. It's their busiest day since it's closed on Saturdays and a great place for some Israeli/Jewish vibes aaaaaand they have a lot of different hummus platters (not surprising hahaha). Its so tiny though! Which makes it easily crowded very quickly. Anyway, I NEED to come back to try the shakshuka and the lamb. When I went I loved the Israeli salad (large portion) and the hot mint tea was refreshing and comforting at the same time. Also- our server, Alex, is great!",,,
1,Alina M.,"Paramus, NJ",504,351,866,4.0,10/2/2017,"Hummus Elite definitely has the most varied selection of hummus offerings that I have every seen; I think that is really what sets it apart from other Mediterranean restaurants. We came in here with a group of 7 on a Sunday night with a reservation for 6:00pm and the place was PACKED. We were finally seated around 6:30pm which was a little later than anticipated but the staff really was trying hard to have the table ready for us (some people just don't get the hint when it's time to leave). They were super nice and overwhelmed so I can't really blame them for anything. Granted, the space is really small which I'm sure contributes to the craziness. And also it was the day after Yom Kippur so people were probably real hangry.We had the Roasted Eggplant and Humshuka Hummus as an appetizer. I really enjoyed the eggplant which was served on top of tahini. I'm not sure that the tahini adds much to it but that also might be because I'm not a fan of tahini in general. The hummus was good too and I liked the addition of the tomato sauce and poached egg. As my main course, I had the grilled chicken breast pita. It was pretty good but WAY too much hummus, I think. If I had known, I definitely would have asked for a quarter of that amount.Overall, a good experience and great food if you like Mediterranean. Personally, the fact that it's kosher doesn't do much for me but I know that's important to some people (such as my mom hence why we came here). Just know that you're going to pay hefty sum here for the fact that is it kosher, especially when ordering meat. Up to you to decide if it's worth it or not!",6,,5
2,Pilar G.,"Columbia, SC",5,117,5,4.0,1/16/2018,"I was in town recently on business and stopped here for lunch. The restaurant was a little cramped, but it does add a certain charm.The service was friendly. I love Greek food and I thought the food was very tasty and fresh. Considering that the food was kosher, I was impressed with the prices as well. It is definitely a great place to stop and have a really good meal.",2,1,1
3,Hui Shan Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,17,30,3.0,7/4/2018,"We were in the area and starving, so we found this place on Yelp because their hummus and pita looked really authentic. While the food was good, unfortunately, the service was really lacking.My friend and I got here around 2:45pm on a Wednesday (July 4th) with only two other people at another table. We placed our order fairly quickly - my friend got the hummus masabacha and I got the hummus sabich, along with a falafel appetizer, a lemon Pellegrino (in a can) and a glass of water.Even with two servers, one other staff person at the front, and at least two people in the kitchen - it took them over 30 minutes before the food was ready. We didn't even get our drinks until 20 minutes in. What was ridiculous was that another table of two ladies were seated 20 minutes after us, and they got their burger and fries 10 minutes before we did. I had to ask what was taking so long and our server went to the kitchen but just apologized  that it was taking a while. When he did bring out our food, he actually messed up and switched up the hummus masabacha and the sabich. My friend and I switched halfway through when we realized we were eating the wrong thing. He also never came by to check on us or to offer us more water.However, the actual hummus and falafel were decent. The falafel was really nicely browned and the hummus  was smooth. Weirdly enough, my friend (an Israeli) and I both thought that it was good but lacking a certain flavor/component of authentic hummus.Overall, the food itself would be 4 stars but the service of the restaurant really knocks it down to 3 stars. Not sure I'd recommend.",1,,

8,Tsippora C.,"New York, NY",0,11,1,1.0,7/12/2018,"I'm so disappointed-the service here is miserable. We asked very politely if the music could be turned down and were then punished for that simple request by having to wait upwards of 15 minutes to even submit our order - the table next to us, who was seated AFTER us, ordered and had their food before we even had an opportunity to order ours!!!!We then sat and watched as our waiter just didn't input our order for another 10 minutes! And on top of all this, the resturant wasn't packed at all, and the music was never turned down. I wish I could leave a positive review regarding the food, but since I haven't even received it yet I cannot comment on it. I'm instead sat here, waiting and hungry, because as a kosher Jew I've got somewhat limited options in the area.",,,
9,Elli M.,"Bronx, NY",108,8,1,2.0,2/25/2018,"Attended a concert at BergenPAC and was thrilled to have Kosher food so near the Venue!As a Walk in we got seated next to the kitchen in the back and were promptly forgotten. Had to practically trip someone to place our order.Fries were good, Chumus with Meat and onions not. Not sure what the meat was, supposed to have been ground beef, but wasn't. Chumus was very thin and way too much Tehini and oil added so it was soupy.Not a good first impression. The owner was at the take-out window nervously trying to handle all the food being packaged for delivery. They aren't well equipped to handle the eat-in and take-out/delivery businesses simultaneously.While we were eating it got crowded and again, had to ask 3 times for the check.If there is occasion to go again I will request not to be seated in the back by the kitchen and will order something else.",,,
10,Jennifer J.,"Ridgewood, NJ",36,15,73,1.0,12/15/2017,"So ridiculously overpriced that i had to write a review to warn others (see attached pic). $16.50 + taxes for a sad chicken dish with 4 pieces of chicken and no sides other than the mountain of rice, tomatoes, and green beans, with subpar taste even i can make at home for less than 2 dollars worth of groceries.

12,Salman A.,"Bergenfield, NJ",268,32,32,1.0,10/30/2017,"STRICTLY A CUSTOMER SERVICE/DELIVERY REVIEW:So the food here is actually quite excellent. When I want hummus, roasted eggplant, and falafel, this is a local go-to for delivery....UNTIL last night. Last night I ordered through Seamless with an expected arrival time of 7:05 pm at the latest. At 7:30, I still had not received my order, so I called. The phone went straight to voicemail. At that point I called Seamless, but the wait time was extraordinarily long. My food ended up arriving at 7:55 pm. I was really annoyed at this point. Well, I figured, ok.... guess this will just have to be lunch for tomorrow. So I open the bag and search to make sure I got everything I ordered. If you know middle eastern food, you know that pita  bread is pretty much mandatory to eat  with this kind of food. Well, the restaurant forgot to put my pita in my bag. I called the restaurant and spoke with their manager, Pedro. When I expressed my disappointment about how late the order was, he proceeded to give me a litany about why the food was late and told me that I should've ordered over the phone, NOT through Seamless, and I would've been that the food would be delayed. Seriously? I should've called? On top of that, when I asked them to deliver the pita from my order, he basically told me no. To resolve the issue, he ""promised"" me that next time I come in, he would provide me a free appetizer. Ok.... so I said, ""can you email me stating that I'll have a free appetizer for my trouble next time I come in?"" He then proceeds to reassure me that he's ""not going anywhere"" and that I'll get my appetizer and refused to email me this information. I can afford the money for the appetizer......this is about principal. The restaurant messed up....TWICE. Almost a full hour late on my order with no call to me to let me know AND forgetting part of my meal. AND THEN promising something without me having any proof that some guy named ""Pedro"" promised me an appetizer. God forbid I go in there with my family 6 months from now and mention this guys name and my ""free appetizer"" and they refuse to give it to me and look like a leech trying to get a free appetizer.Needless to say, I don't need Pedro's appetizer ... I won't be ordering from this place, take out or dine in. If I have to go through all this hassle for their screw up, I don't want to support this business.",,,
13,Leela K.,"Bergenfield, NJ",433,274,880,3.0,1/16/2017,"Okay - not great and dinner options are overpriced. The eggplant appetizer was creamy and delicious. At $6 it was reasonable and the rich flavor was spot on. After that the meal went downhill. Perhaps I just didn't order the right thing, and it certainly wasn't the right price. At 16.95 the 1/2 plate of chicken kebab  did not hit the spot. The chicken was flavored well (one skewer) but could have been cooked a little less. The grilled veggies (string beans and tomatoes) were bland and I had to reach for the salt and pepper to eat them. The Israeli salad was okay, nothing special. I should have stuck to the hummus, which is clearly the winner here. In the future I will stick to Toros in New Milford- better portions and better price.",3,2,2

Updated review","Love, Love, the food!!! Only one person was serving us, but was very nice and did apologize for the wait which wasn't long but the fact that she was very considerate made me happy. I only had apps... You'll understand why I didn't order an entree. Live and learn. Lol. We had the -Hummus-Eggplant appetizer -Organic boiled egg-Falafel It was a lot and my eyes were hungrier than my stomach. Hehehe... It was so good by far the creamiest and great tasting hummus I've had and it wasn't hot. I like it hot. Great little find while I was in Englewood, NJ again. Thanks again. Apologies for the half eating plates. Lol just remembered to take a pic while half way in devouring this meal. Enjoy peeps. Oh, almost forgot! Phenomenal pita bread, get some.",1,,1

Food was good but please keep in mind when ordering that they include a lot of hummus, A LOT with their portions! Falafels were good- lot of hummus!Seems like the best dish was mine. I chose one with meat and onions and peppers. It was very tasty, tender and again, a whole lot of hummus!!!The warm, huge, fluffy pitas were AMAZing!! Both white and whole wheat.",1,1,2
18,Jeanna G.,"Paramus, NJ",450,651,2882,3.0,4/7/2016,"I love me some falafels and have been scoping out hummus elite for quite some time now. Being I work in the area it was only a matter of time before I would get the chance to see what they are all about. My coworker and I ordered the lunch special which they have going on Monday - Friday up until 4PM, and they give you two options (vegetarian or meat lunch special) I decided to order the vegetarian lunch special which consists of you choice of a sandwich plus an appetizer and soda and my coworker got the meat lunch special. The falafel sandwich was served in the most delicious soft pita bread and served with fries, some type of cabbage slaw that added a nice crunch to the sandwich and tahini. I wish I remembered that there was going to be tahini in it because I have never been a fan of it but the flavor wasn't over powering. The falafel were large and flavorful and I really enjoyed them. The hummus that I got as my appetizer was very smooth in consistency but I wish I got something added to it like meat.. could of used a little extra flavor to make it really good. Also wish they sent more than one pita for my hummus.The delivery was pretty quick and the food was nice and hot when it got here. I will be back to try out some more of what they have to offer.",4,1,1

23,Dave O.,"Bergenfield, NJ",77,123,317,3.0,1/16/2017,"I came here today with a groupon worth 30$. Usually places with groupons aren't that great but this place did not disappoint. We got the roasted eggplant appetizer and at 6$ it was tasty and enough for two people. The eggplant was served on top of hummus and they complimented each other perfectly, it also came with a thick warm pita. I ordered the kofta pita sandwich. It is ground lamb and beef mixed together with spices and formed into a patty, then cooked. The sandwich had fries, hummus, and Israeli  salad in it. It tasted great and I ate the whole thing with nothing left over. My gripe and the reason I give this place 3 stars is the price. The sandwich I just mentioned was 12$, which isn't much money but I feel like that's a lot for a small/medium size sandwich. I think 8 would be way better. If it came with a side I would be more satisfied with the price point. My date had a chicken dish which was equally overpriced with not that much food. I think the lunch special is the way to go at this place. I'm not sure I would return because I can think of a lot of other similar places that give you way more food for the same price if not cheaper.",,,
24,Andrea F.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",14,50,91,3.0,6/14/2017,I took out the food I ordered.  The Veggie Soup was great!  Israeli salad not crunchy fresh.  The tomatoes and cucumbers should not have been served.  Chicken kebab dinner delish but Be warned they do not give you pita !  My kabobs were $21 w a side of bad Israeli salad and soggy green beans with beautifully prepped cooked grape tomatoes.  The food wasn't  up to my standards.

To start, my family decided on the Appetizer Combo, for which you choose three appetizers for just $13.75. We ordered the kibbeh with tahini dip, stuffed grape leaves, and my personal favorite of the appetizers, the roasted eggplant that made my mouth yearn for more. For my meal, I got the Falafel Sandwich. First off, I am very picky when it comes to falafel balls, and this one DEFINITELY passes. The atmosphere was super-friendly, and the serving size well exceeds the price. And of course, their hummus is very decadent, creamy, and tasty, living up to its reputation.",1,,

First of all, a restaurant named Hummus Elite must necessarily have elite hummus. This sadly was not the case as my hummus was bitter due to the addition of excess amounts of Tahini paste. The french fries were unsalted, which is healthier I suppose but not tasty. The kofta kabab wrap was the highlight but it lacked a crunch factor that some veggies might add, and it too lacked salt. My entree, the hummus shwarma was essentially shredded chicken drowned in a lake of slightly bitter hummus. It was a bit mushy and just an odd presentation in general. Overall, I would not recommend the food. There are way better Mediterranean options in the area.",2,1,

This is a small restaurant, and business tonight was good, so it looked like all of the waitresses were all extremely busy, we had to wave couple times to get their attention, but they were all very nice and polite. I had steak and eggs sandwich, I like they use pita as bread.  Sandwich is really huge, I only ate half and felt so full already. However, steak is too dry and too thick , I wish they could cut it thinner so it will be more easily to eat. Friend ordered Pargiot (grilled baby chicken thighs) and she loved it, I tried some chicken and it  was so tender and full of flavor. It's a BYOB place but you must bring Kosher wine/ Mevushal Wine (for non-Jewish), otherwise they won't open the wine for you. Too bad, we could only bring our wine back.",1,,

But hummus? I would give 5 stars! I had mushroom hummus and that was probably one of the best hummus I've ever had. Very fresh homemade hummus you wouldn't get at a grocery store. It comes with breads and the portion was huge too!It took a while to get my order because I didn't order ahead of time, so make sure you order before going to pick up.

54,David K.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",268,198,552,3.0,12/4/2011,"HUMMUS IS GOOD FOR A QUICK KOSHER NOSH!Out shopping for the day and just looking for a bite to eat, we spotted this place as we were heading down Palisades Avenue looking for something quick before going grocery shopping. Never EVER go grocery shopping when you're hungry or else you're likely to spend more money on the extra groceries than you would have on lunch.My wife had been there with friends on a prior occasion, so she we were going to order some dishes she had tried on her last visit. We ordered the Moroccan Cigars with Tahini Dip (four fried soybean rolls wrapped in phyllo dough) as our appetizer. We asked for a cup of S'chug which is an Israeli/Yemenite hot sauce consisting of a rough mash of red chiles, sweet red peppers, a big dose of garlic and cilantro. They served us up the the green variety which means that this was also blended with jalapeño peppers for a milder heat than the one in my fridge. When blended with the tahini it gave it just the right zip. I've had Moroccan Cigars at other Israeli place, but none that were filled with soybean that tasted quite as good.For our meals we both ordered the Falafel Sandwich (served with hummus, cabbage salad, french fries and tahini sauce in a pita). I had mine with the cabbage salad in a white pita while my wife while had hers with the Israeli salad and in a wheat pita. The falafel balls tasted as though they were freshly rolled and fried which gave them a very soft texture inside. Because the falafel is also stuffed with Hummus, the cabbage salad is not dry other places. You're getting quite a filling sandwich here, so don't over-order on the appetizers or side dishes.Another thing to note was that for a drink I noticed that their menu offered an unsweetened iced tea and a lemonade. So I decided to combine the two and order an Arnold Palmer. Although if they put that drink on the menu I can't help but wonder if they would call it an Arnie Pomerantz.Overall we had a great experience at Hummus Elite and would go there again should we ever want a quick kosher nosh while hitting the shops in Englewood.",3,3,1

I loved the texture, it was absolutely perfect; the flavor was good too and they used good olive oil most definitely; this is probably one of the best hummus I've ever had, but I really want to go back and try their other styles of hummus or perhaps a hummus platter; in addition, the pita bread they serve is so friggen good! what is up with that bread?! it's so thick and fluffy and chew, it's so perfect for sandwich or dipping)*Moraccan cigars with tahini dip (these were decent, it was fried soybeans wrapped in phyllo dough, I really loved the tahini sauce, they got it right with that, the cigars weren't anything fabulous though, nothing special and they were tiny!!!!!!!!!!!! they were like the size of my middle finger, regardless though it was worth trying)*falafel (the falafel were really green, which threw me off, I was expecting it to be more tan since it's chickpeas but they probably added a lot of fresh herbs; I liked it, not salty but I like Toro's better)*sabich sandwich (hummus, boiled egg, tahini, and roasted eggplant: this was really good, I liked the eggplant but wow was it super soft, the boiled egg  added a great flavor to this sandwich but it was such a soft sandwich already with the hummus and eggplant, I felt that they should have added something crunchy because I can handle so much of that soft baby food texture before I feel nauseous, perhaps a crunchy veggie or nuts or something fried/crisp would have done the trick; regardless though, this sandwich was huge, filling, and very good)This place is Kosher; I think the quality of the food is great and the service is pretty good too, we dined al fresco which was nicer than inside because I think it's more or less an open kitchen and the smells are strong inside, I MUST go back to this place to try more of their food!!

And if you're worried about your svelte figure, don't be because it's only about 4 steak fries in that magnificence that is the falafel sandwich. The cozy restaurant was packed so I took my order to go. As this was my first meal from Hummus Elite, I didn't know that I had a brown bag of falafel gold in my possession. Chances are it never would have made it home as I would have inhaled it right there on the street, caring less about and snares and glares and more about shoving the most perfect falefel I've ever had down my pie-hole.

I think it was because I was craving chicken shawarma and they didn't have it on their menu. It was really disappointing, but not their fault.

The slaw was amazing -- I could have eaten by itself and the bread was perfectly toasted.

The waiters were so friendly, greeting us at the door and checking to make sure we were comfortable and happy. The service was quick which was perfect for my business lunch. I have tried hummus from different restaurants and always thought I never liked it, but the hummus here is unbelievable. The kebabs, salads, and hummus tasted so fresh and authentic. It is always a disappointment when you go to a restaurant and eat food that tastes like it has been sitting there for a while. But trust me, Hummus Elite will not disappoint. I am excited to become a regular at this establishment !!!!",,,

77,Brian C.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",136,423,0,3.0,4/30/2012,"Went here on a groupon. Food is 3-4 stars, service was 1-2 stars. This restaurant is a little nook on the main road in Englewood and is pretty intimate. Service started off pretty attentive, but then it fell off a cliff. We had to flag people down to put our orders in and get refills. We had a hummus platter and two entrees and we were there for almost 2 hours. We saw others come and go while we were waiting for food or a check. My wife sat with an empty plate in front of her for around 20 minutes. In that time we got the check, paid, and left. Not sure how much longer they would have left it there since we left before they cleared it. Very odd. Also, when we paid, it was a very long time until they came back. Turns out tax wasnt included in the groupon too.  Very odd service experience as a whole.The food was good. We got the hummus elite hummus platter. The pita was very good too. Our entrees were pretty good as well. I had the tilapia.The service here left a bad taste in my mouth. Won't go again as there are other comparable or better middle eastern places to eat that are closer to where I live and where the service is solid.",2,,

The over easy poached egg along with a stew made of tomato, peppers, and onions over perfectly flavored hummus is to die for! I always end up ordering an extra warm, whole wheat pita to scrape the residue off my plate. I give Hummus Elite four stars. Although the food is satisfying, the service can be better.",,,
79,Scott P.,"Granite Bay, CA",10,9,0,3.0,1/14/2013,"Good, but not great. And a small complaint.I've been here twice now, both times opting to some sort of pita sandwich during lunchtime. The hummus is solid, but the chicken I found was without serious flavor. The second sandwich I got was falafel. It was better, and I liked the fries that they put inside the pita. The hummus this time seemed too 'watery' though, blew a hole out the bottom of the sandwich within a minute of diving into it. Not the end of the world, but slightly disappointing. Food gets 3.5 stars, but a half star deducted for slow service. It seemed on par for a restaurant that had a crazy lunch rush hour, but both times I didn't see that happen. Maybe 2 or 3 take out orders, and one other patron. I'll probably come back one more time, but only if I have an afternoon to kill.",,,
80,Laryssa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",408,281,93,4.0,11/10/2011,"A cozy vegetarian's paradise in Englewood, Hummus Elite is a great place to enjoy a fun and eclectic lunch. The young staff is friendly and accommodating, and they seem eager to answer any questions you may have about the menu.We ordered the lunch combo (one hummus and a side) with tahini hummus and sweet potato fries. The hummus came with warm pita bread, and I could tell that the hummus was fresh and homemade. It was one of the better versions that I've tried. In addition, the hand-cut fries were thick and well seasoned.We also ordered a lentil soup to share, since we weren't sure if the lunch combo would be enough to split between two people. The lentil soup was hearty but could have been seasoned more. I wasn't impressed, but I also wasn't repelled by it. Next time I dine here, which I will have to do in the near future, I will definitely try the falafel!

We both got the Vegetarian Lunch Special--you get an app, either hummus meal or sandwich as well as a drink for 10.95. Pretty good deal and you get enough for left overs-unless you choose to just eat it all...which I did.My friend got Kibbeh with Tahini Dip and Hummus Falafel. There was enough Hummus to feed 5 people(ok maybe I am exaggerating but there was almost too much). The Description had said Truffle oil but it tasted more like Regular Olive Oil but still creamy and great tasting.I had the Moroccan Cigars with Tahini Dip and Falafel Sandwich. The Moroccan Cigars were great little starters to a meal. My falafel sandwich was excellent, it was stuffed to the max and I got to the point where I had to debate if I would just eat the whole thing or wrapped it up....I chose to just eat it.

They brought out three dishes after 40 minutes, and didn't bring out the rest of our meal until significantly past the hour mark. Until that long awaited point, they paid zero attention to us. When we told them that we were unhappy, they claimed the food was in the process. But it doesn't even matter, because I will not wait 1.5 hours for a ceasar salad.

First break into the falafel, I see it's green! Very exciting as he best falafels I have ever had were green. It lived up to my expectation - crispy outside, moist and flavorful inside. My only complaint is that they were a little heavy on the garlic.They gave a very generous amount of hummus; it would've been enough for an entree! It was of a thicker, creamier consistency. That was okay, but it was a little bland. The Tahiti oil and spices that helped the taste, but I wasn't really impressed or excited about it.The roasted eggplant tasted better, and I liked it a lot more than the hummus.

Stoked. I went to Hummus Elite, grabbed some nosh, and headed to Starbucks for a sit-down in my proverbial ""office.""I ordered the Lentil Soup and Quinoa Salad to go, and the total came out to around $9. Not too bad for a delicious and filling lunch. The Lentil Soup is probably THE best Lentil Soup I've ever had, without a doubt, even better than anything I've ever made, and although the Quinoa Salad leaves a little to be desired, it really gets the job done. The Lentil Soup was chock full of flavor, veggies, and the right amount of spice. The Quinoa Salad is missing a real kick, but it's got lots of cucumbers and mint in it. Yes, I neglected to get Hummus at Hummus Elite, but from the looks of the tables and those chowing down, I will definitely be back to sample what they have to offer. For an Israeli joint, it's got the true feel of what Israel has to offer, including the waiters and waitresses that chatter in Hebrew. I'll be back here ... and probably even more so when the weather warms up and the patio is open. I mean, hummus on a patio in warm weather? It's the perfect home-away-from Israel home.",2,1,

97,Bbq B.,"Woodbridge, NJ",8,244,6,3.0,3/15/2013,"Having a place that specializes in Hummus is like a Pom Frites place offering the same item with multiple sauces...It quickly loses its luster.Hummus Elite and Hummus Masabacha, not much difference.  Unfortunately, the hummus (plural) is more like wallpaper paste; as its preparation is not very authentic in texture.Roasted Eggplant Appetizer was a clear winner.The pita itself was light and fluffy.Felafel had a lot of seasoning in it; way too much for me.  Conversely, Beyond Pita in Montclair does an outstanding felafel.Steak and Egg Sandwich had too much bread, the meat could have been sliced thinner so that it was chewable and I could not find much meat in it. Also,  the sweet caramelized onions overtook any  flavor that was in it.  Steak fries were boring.Cowboy burger was a nice surprise as both the quality and quantity of the meat was very tasty and over took the whole meal as the show piece.",1,,
98,Marcie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,179,37,4.0,9/6/2010,"Stopped here on my way back from bear mountain because I was craving Israeli food and didn't want to wait until I hit the city. I'm so glad we found this place.If you want real homemade israeli food then you have to check this place out. We ordered the following:-hummus elite which comes with mushrooms -hummus sabich, -falafel sandwich (which is done exactly like they do in Israel) which is why the french fries are in there -and a tunisian fricassee sandwich. Everything was really really good, fluffy pita and thick hummus not watered down like some places.I left there totally stuffed, just wished there was a location closer to me",4,,

But the people behind me who were schmoozing the whole time had the same waiter and saw him at least 4 times after they got their food and I saw him when I ordered, got my food and when I asked for my check. -__- the woman next to me was right next to the register and just stood up to ask who ever was there if she could pay. When the manager came out to lend a hand I jumped into the line that had formed and paid that way. So- u have to be schmoozy or proactive & request service here but nice people and ok food!",,,

104,Khalid E.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,4/13/2015,"At first I was excited to try this place because it was a different restaurant that I have not tried. The delivery was actually rather quick but that is the last of the positives for Hummus Elite. When I opened my delivery I was absolutely shocked at the small quantity of food. I am not new to Middle Eastern food and this was absolutely ridiculous. The platter was 25 dollars for only 3 skewers that resembled tooth picks and enough rice to feed a baby bird. The salad was nasty and soggy, the hummus was dry and had barely any tahini in it. The best part is when my food was being delivered the man said ""I put extra pita in there for you"", which would have been nice if there was actually more than just 2 pieces of pita for an entire pound of dry hummus. So, when we called back to try to explain how ridiculous the portions were the manager said that we are the only ones to ever complain about this and basically told us to go to hell. Thanks Hummus Elite, good luck, you will definitely need it if you keep on treating new customers like this.",,,

Sweet potatoes fries were also very good, and the pitas were fresh, soft, also the best I've ever had. Sandwiches wee creative and delicious. Absolutely superb food.",1,,

112,M P.,"Livingston, NJ",5,7,2,1.0,11/3/2011,"On Wednesday 11/02/2011 I went out to dinner with a close friend to this restaurant after a very nice Spa session, so I was very relaxed and looking forward to a nice meal, specially Hummus and Falafel! Yummy...  My friend and I shared 2 dishes, Hummus Fallafel $9.95 and Chicken Kebab $17.95, and she ordered a Diet Coke and I ordered a Peach Nectar and a glass of water. They did not have peach nectar so I order then Mango nectar, which was never brought to me. First we had the Hummus Fallafel and it was average, Fallafel was good (crispy outside and green and light inside) but the Hummus (from a place called Hummus Elite) I was expecting something out of this world but it was just average.   Then came the Chicken Kebab, Oh boy! if that could be called chicken Kebab..... I am not going to lie, the marinate of the chicken was flavorful, but when I took them of the skewer I immediately saw that there were 2 pieces half cooked, so much that you could see pink flesh..... JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURE I POSTED. In addition, the couscous served with it not only did not have any flavor; it was so dry that it felt like you were chewing on sand. I asked the waiter to let the Chef know and he said ""sure, I will be right back....."" Nobody came by the table, no owner, chef or manager... not even the waiter. Even worse, he never came back again (and the place is very small, It is not like I was lost in the crowd) I had to get up to the register and ask the waiter for the bill.Once I asked for the bill, still no questions asked about raw chicken sitting on my plate. He just simply took my card and charged it, I thought since I did not eat the dish the least they would do was to take that price out, and also since I never got the Pear or Mango nectar I will not have to pay for it either.... Well I thought wrong, both the chicken Kebab and the Nectar were included on my bill. So I asked the waiter (I was still standing at the register), did you charge for the nectar? And he said ""mmmmmm I think so I am not sure, but it's too late anyways because I charged the credit card already...."" SERIOUSLY! I told him I never got it and he acted surprise.... And went in the back and said ""do you want it now?"" SERIOUSLY! No, I do not want it anymore, I just finished my half cooked meal. He got somebody to come and while we were waiting I asked if he told the chef about the chicken being raw and what he was going to do with it, and he said ""Yes I told him, actually there he is"" THE CHEF AND THE OWNER ARE THE SAME PERSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG, I would expect that somebody like an employee would not give a crap about it.... but THE OWNER!?!?!?!?! So the owner proceeded to do something at the register without even acknowledging I was standing there and guess what he did??? He just gave me the cost of the nectar already charged on my card back as cash. Then he continued doing something in silence and then said: ""and about the Chicken I am sorry but  here is a 25% discount (never mind the discount was written on a piece of paper from the back of an order pad and he signed it....), I am also the owner so look this is my signature"". Does he really think I am going to return to his crappy restaurant????? I left the coupon on the counter and left the place and WILL NEVER COME BACK..... If you want to catch Salmonella and have the owner give a crap about it! Then go to this place...... I do not want to even imagine what other disgusting and dirty manipulation of food is going on in the back.",1,,

The Falafel is also one of the best I've ever had -- even my Israeli father approves. The pita bread is very, very good.The service...is not great. Everyone is very nice, just a little bit slow. The restaurant is quite small and usually crowded, so it tends to get noisy and often we have to flag down our server to get a refill, an extra napkin, or the check.  But...the food more than makes up for this inconvenience, which is why I am a frequent and loyal customer of Hummus Elite.  I only wish they were open on Saturdays.",,,

Their hummus is not ""watery"", has the perfect consistency and the flavor is on point. My favorite is the Hummus Fava - it's absolutely delicious. The hummus dishes come with two fluffy pita breads - you can choose wheat or white. If you like spice, make sure to ask for the hot sauce.Hands down, the best Hummus I've ever had in the States.As far as non hummus dishes, the Moroccan Cigars are a must try!

122,Aaron F.,"New York, NY",0,11,1,5.0,9/20/2010,"My relentless search for a decent hummus joint in Manhattan usually ends in disappointment, so based on a NJ friend's recommendation I tried Hummus Elite. Getting to Englewood from Manhattan was not too bad and it was well worth it. The falafel is few levels above anything I tried before, even in Israel. The pitas are so fluffy that they put anything else that carries the name ""pita"" and is served in Manhattan to shame.  The crown jewel, the hummus itself, comes in a nice variety and is very close to the magic paste I remember from home.  Being located in Englewood it will unfortunately not be a daily lunch place for Manhattanites, but a weekend visit is highly recommended.",5,,

125,Lisa W.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",67,164,0,3.0,7/30/2013,"Have been wanting to try this place for a while.  In short, it was just OK...was not blown away by any means.  We ordered various appetizers, including hummus, which honestly was just OK...nothing more, as you might expect given the name of the establishment.  Had falafel, an eggplant dip, Israeli salad & a salmon burger.  I'm a big fish eater & the salmon had the fishiest taste I've ever experienced.  Didn't really care for it.  The bread was abysmal....it was very doughey/chewy & not warmed...pita from the grocery store would have been better.  I think the best part of the meal was the sweet potato fries that came w/the salmon burger.  To add insult to injury, neither my BF nor I felt well the next day...stomach issues.  Obviously I can't say for sure it had something to do with what we ate, but I suspect that to be the case.  I will say that we didn't have any issue w/service being slow.  As a matter of fact, it was the opposite.  They brought everything out fairly quickly and pretty much at once, which is almost equally annoying.  Lastly, prices are a bit on the high side for a storefront type of restaurant.Note:  I was seriously thinking of giving this place 2 stars, but I thought that might be a bit harsh & I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because I think this is a case of us not loving this place being more a function of ""us"" than the food.  I think we just have other preferences as far as ""Middle Eastern"" type food & this just didn't hit us the right way.",,,

At first glance, the place boasted a quaint, homely, small location that perhaps was a little too small for the business demand. We waited a good fifteen minutes to be seated only to have them combine tables to accommodate our group of five. This was at around mid-day Sunday, so it could have been a bit more acceptable. We then proceeded to wait twenty minutes while other families came in and sat down around us. They had the audacity to even pass by us as they served other families before us. The very thing that bothered us was that the families they served, all had if not a religious then social connection with the staff and were employing said connections to get better service and more attentive waitresses. We, after waiting a total of 35 minutes combined to be seated and to not be attended, picked up our stuff and left. We went across the street to a marvelous restaurant ""It's Greek to Me"". Only recommend this restaurant if you are willing to wait an incredible amount of time for food.",,1,
