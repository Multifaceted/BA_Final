0,Susan A.,"Brooklyn, NY",121,637,1,5.0,10/7/2018,"The line was ridiculously long Saturday at 10:15am, but I think they were short staffed (1 person manning registers and coffee bar) but that annoyance aside, the Grey Dog was the perfect place for our New York sensibilities.Seating is spacious, which is almost unheard of for NY, but more importantly, once your order was placed, everything was easy, from getting a table to food to finding a baby appropriate enclave that wouldn't disturb other patrons but roomy enough to sprawl and watch the baby go!  Staff was super friendly and food was good.Very happy this place exists and is located where it is located.  Love it and would totally come back.",,,
1,Jieun L.,"New York, NY",623,203,724,4.0,11/20/2018,"I first went to Grey Dog years ago when I first moved to New York. I fell in love with it because at every Grey Dog, you'll see a small Michigan flag somewhere. Not only that, the servers were always warm and friendly, and the food was great. The wood accents at every Grey Dog makes for it to be a warm ambiance. I love it.Grey Dog isn't a sit-down service restaurant, but the quality of food far exceeds a fast food restaurant. I've tried it all - their burgers, sandwiches, salads, soups, breakfast foods, just coffee and pastries. My favorite are always the pastries - they have a polenta cake topped with a side of house-made jam that's delicious. Their brownies and cookies are always nice to have and they'll heat it up for you. You can't really go wrong with food. Grey Dog isn't that experimental. You're getting salads or sandwiches that use quality ingredients. One of my favorite breakfast sandwiches are the bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant. Their burgers are great, and their salad with tuna is great. Just go and enjoy the food. It's not pretentious, friendly service, and quality food.",,,
2,Ruby B.,"Hoboken, NJ",34,31,65,4.0,11/19/2018,This is a really great place for casual brunch at great prices. The food is really top notch and there are so many different options with good portion size. I highly recommend the spicy kale salad and the soups are always good.Ordering is kind of confusing because you seat yourself and then go up to the counter and you can loose your seat in that time. This place also gets pretty crowded so if you want a quiet coffee shop this isn't it but some people like that kind of work environment.,,,
3,Jessica L.,"New York, NY",171,119,202,4.0,11/12/2018,"This place is dog friendly! Although not officially, they won't say anything if you bring a well behaved dog. I've been here twice because there's not so many dog friendly places nearby.  First time, I tried the seared tuna tacos, they were just alright. Second time, I was blown away by the bacon guacamole grilled cheese. I definitely recommend that or the grey dog breakfast (has a little bit of everything). Make sure to order at the counter and then find your seating with your designated bandana.",1,,1
4,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",226,387,698,4.0,10/31/2018,"What a cute and homey spot to grab a bite! Menu options are great for lunch and dinner. You get in line to order what you want and the server will reserve a table for you and bring the food out to you! So it has the vibes of fast casual, but also still a sit down restaurant.I got the egg and cheese croissant with sausage and my boyfriend got the grey dog breakfast. The egg and cheese croissant was pretty good. The sausage wasn't anything special, but wow those eggs were super fluffy and very deliciously cheesy! The brunch potatoes were really good too. The grey dog breakfast has great variation. The raspberry butter sauce they give on the side was phenomenal though! Went great with the French toast. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the extensive menu!",2,,2
5,Melissa D.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",165,37,85,4.0,10/12/2018,"Such a cute little neighborhood spot for breakfast or lunch. Came here after walking The Highline on a friend's recommendation. You order at the counter (there was no line when we got there!) and then they bring your food out to you once it's ready. I had the bacon and avocado grilled cheese, which sounds kind of basic but it really wasn't-it was amazing. Avocado, bacon, cheddar, mozzarella all on perfectly toasted sourdough bread (the obvious best choice for grilled cheese;). Sandwich came with fries and was a nice sized portion and good value for the price. Everyone I was with loved their food. The atmosphere is super cute inside and has a neighborhood-y feel. Service was excellent as well!",,,
6,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,232,325,4.0,8/29/2018,"Great place for casual brunch. It's not the most trendy or grammable but it's a super friendly, down-to-earth kind of place with awesome food. We ordered the french toast, poached egg and avocado salad, classic omelette, and the mac and cheese, and they were all very good! Especially the mac - do yourselves a favor and order it to share because it's as awesome and cheesy of a brunch dish as you could want. PLUS it comes with a side of ""cute salad"" but you can upgrade that to sweet potato fries, which we naturally did and no regrets were had whatsoever.I'm basically just outing myself as a basic brunch bitch but the moment I saw they served a peach frozé I knew I had to order it. It was actually stronger than expected (awesome), came with frozen blueberries on top (awesome), served to me by a happy staff member with the most adorable dimpled smile (awesome), and most of all tasted great (so awesome). I'm going to stop writing this review now before it falls further into the deplorable depths of basicness, but take my word for it, Grey Dog is an all around winner for a solid brunch.",1,1,
7,Alexa B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",321,45,112,4.0,10/15/2018,"This is a great spot for a casual dinner on a weeknight. They have delicious sandwiches, salads, soups and other entrees. They also have a great offering of cookies and brownies. Only downside is there is usually a line, but they do a good job managing the wait for tables.",,,
8,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",95,448,0,3.0,9/29/2018,"Had lunch at The Grey Dog today...Ambiance: Super noisy and very crowded, even at 2pm. Definitely be prepared to yell to be heard. The restaurant itself is a bit eclectic, bordering on dirty.Service: You order at the counter and they bring your food to you when it's ready. The problem is that to actually place your order you have to wait in an unbelievably long line, which took us 20 minutes. Food takes a while too, so the majority of our time at The Grey Dog was waiting to place our order, and then waiting for our food. Staff is super friendly, which helps, but still kind of frustrating.Food: Nothing special unfortunately. I had a veggie omelette, which was really just a few leaves of spinach mixed with egg. The breakfast potatoes were delicious though. My daughter had the chicken press, which wasn't pressed in the least. She said it was on the drier side.Overall: Not sure if I'm maybe just too old for this place but it really didn't do anything for me. I doubt we'll return.",1,,
9,Katelyn W.,"Atlanta, GA",253,76,131,3.0,10/9/2018,"Ok, YUM! This is a great gem in west village. Very tight space, although I'd argue it's just part of the charming neighborhood coffee shop feel. The food was classic brunch fare, nothing twisted. Predictable and filled with safe options, the menu doesn't boast unprecedented culinary creations, but it's GOOD. The 'order at the counter and then be seated' process is a little strange, but it does keep people moving- by the time you get through the line to place your order, more likely than not someone has finished their brunch. Pretty cool spot for a hearty brunch in west village for cheap!",,,
10,Melissa Z.,"Charlottesville, VA",349,47,58,4.0,10/4/2018,Really highly rated and I can see why. The food is great especially for the price. My friend tried the coffee and they even swapped out the coffee for hot chocolate when she asked. Definitely get the home fries which were the best thing imo but everything we ordered tasted great. The only thing is that the line is long and you really can't choose where to sit - the seating and service was alright. They ran out of clean silverware and we only had plastic for a while.,,,
11,Sal L.,"Queens, NY",47,286,556,4.0,11/6/2018,"Nice place to have a hearty, tasty breakfast. My latte was a lot but very strong with espresso, which I liked. French toast on challah bread had that hint of cinnamon. The cubed fried potatoes were delicious and wonderfully crispy. Pleasant staff all around.",,,
12,Tony L.,"Brooklyn, NY",621,344,587,3.0,9/16/2018,"It was a nondescript Saturday afternoon when I decided to meet up with a friend in Chelsea. We didn't know where to go, so naturally I hopped on Yelp and found this cute place. A cute cozy cafe with multiple locations around the city, I figured it was worth a shot.The interior was all brick with work from local artists hanging around. It looked a bit like a hippie commune, but I was digging it. You order at the counter, leave your name, and a waiter comes by to drop off your food. Although it was a bit crowded, it only took us 3 minutes to get seated and everyone was lovely.I had the Poached Eggs & Avocado salad that came with toast, arugala, and salmon for $15. I was really wowed by all that I got, but if you are looking to get full, this is not the place - though fortunately, I paired it with a watermelon froze. I'm not a big wine guy, but when I tasted that delicious slushiness, I knew I needed it. Pro-tip, do not bike for 3 hours and then drink half of it before your meal arrives. You will be fuzzy all day long. Nothing really stood out about Grey Dog, but it was super casual and I didn't feel like I had to dress up or impress anybody. Standard fare. Enjoy!",,,
13,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,5/16/2018,"There are many locations of this restaurant chain in Manhattan, and the Nolita location was the scene of one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had, but this one had much friendlier and nicer service so that was a big plus! The service gets five stars, as well as the cozy/shabby/rustic vibe of the chain as a whole, though I wouldn't say the menu is anything inventive or impressive. It's straight ahead food that isn't going to blow your mind, but there's a lot of variety on the menu and probably something for everyone. I was sad to find that they had gotten rid of my favorite dish, which was their baked oatmeal, and so I went with the breakfast quesadilla. It looked like something that a college student could easily cook up in their dorm kitchen, with some dry wheat tortilla, a small amount of cheese, and some skimpy veggies in there. Overall the flavor wasn't bad or anything, but just nothing special. Others in my party got the egg breakfast and the salmon and poached egg salad, which met expectations but didn't exceed them. But again, I don't want to paint too negative a picture of this place - just know what to expect in terms of the food. The people are nice, the coffee has free refills, and there are a lot of tables to sit back and relax, so it's a-ok!",11,5,12
14,Melissa G.,"New York, NY",23,206,98,4.0,5/30/2018,"As one of my friends put it, The Grey Dog has simply perfected the art of breakfast. You won't find anything out of the ordinary on the menu, yet everything is very well done. I got Grey Dog's Breakfast which is a little expensive at ~$14, but it's so much food -- scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and french toast. I know some people talk a lot of trash about french toast but this french toast is a force to be reckoned with. The hash browns are exquisitely fried and crispy. Eggs are pretty standard. I'm not a huge bacon person but the bacon was above average. I dipped it in the maple syrup for the french toast and voila *maple* bacon!The Grey Dog isn't a fancy place -- you order, find a place to sit, and grab water and utensils yourself. Solid breakfast and great for brunching with friends or getting a bit of work done.",,,
15,Aliah C.,"Long Beach, CA",163,9,77,5.0,7/22/2018,The weather was overcast and had been raining. Humid AF! I was really thirsty and was going to settle on water (hell no H2O!) but then I saw sangria. The woman at the counter introduced me to their Frozé. She swore it was good and gave me a taste bc I've never had it. Holy HELL! It was AMAZING! The icy texture that hits your lips! There is a peach flavor that is refreshing on a humid day. The service is another level. So kind and so genuine. I wish I would've gotten names. I would definitely come back when I visit NY again.,2,1,2
16,Janelle B.,"New York, NY",344,87,409,5.0,3/25/2018,"YESSSS!!! Love it! Thumps up for sure! I recommend this place to anyone who wants good food. I went here twice in the same weekend, and it was a great experience every time. I feel like everything on their menu is good. They also have special dietary options, which is nice!  The first time I went I had the Rasberry Iced Tea, it was refreshing but I just needed to add a little sugar and then it was great.  The next day I went for brunch and I ordered their croissant and egg sandwich with potatoes on the side. SO YUMMY! Go go go to this place! It can be crazy on the weekend, but it's well worth it!",2,,
17,Tina C.,"Chicago, IL",24,105,124,5.0,6/21/2018,"AMAZING. Went at 2:30 on a Saturday, no line whatsoever. It's self seated so you just order at counter. The mac and cheese is incredible - you must get it if you are a lover of Mac n cheese. It's topped with breadcrumbs and probably so unhealthy, but worth every bite!! The avocado toast is also delicious, with little chili flakes and a drizzle of olive oil on top. Last but not least the French toast is perfectly fluffy and sweet but not too sweet - overall incredible place.",1,,1
18,Stephanie N.,"Grand Rapids, MI",92,123,83,5.0,2/17/2018,"Absolutely loved everything about the grey dog! Even though it was pretty hectic and busy, the staff placed a bandana at the table for your group and was organized. You stand in line, order, and pay, and then sit down. They call your name when they bring out your food which came out very fast!My roommates and tried the smoked salmon points toast (amazing and a big portion), Brie apple and roast turkey sandwich with raspberry mustard (also amazing and comes with fries/side salad), and the grey dog plate. All of the food exceeded our expectations and we loved the music and atmosphere! Even though it's hard to get past the fact that it's a university of Michigan owned restaurant   I will be bringing friends + family to come when they visit nonetheless.",,,
19,Chris S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",154,245,9,5.0,6/29/2018,"Found this place by accident.  Charming cafe that has a locals vibe to it.  The atmosphere is really nice - chill blues hip hop, open brick walls, nooks and crannys for privacy/intimacy.  It's a walk up and order but they do bring you the food.  The staff is really friendly.  Portions were massive and reasonably priced.  The ahi tuna salad came with brown rice, fresh greens, avocado, and a ginger dressing.  Absolutely delicious!  Cant wait to bring friends here.",,,

Can't go wrong with anything on their menu here, any time of day! My go-to is the Baja fish tacos. Also tried a classic egg breakfast last time I was here, which was fantastic and filling. The French toast and apple turkey Brie sandwich are also favorites of mine.Edit 3/2018: greek salad with chicken is great. Burger is also decent.",,,

Used to get delivery when we lived closer, and now we come here as often as we can to meet up with friends. Only had their breakfast food, and can highly recommend anything with the home fries, or even adding a side of home fries. So crispy and delicious! They have high quality condiments, the eggs taste super fresh, and there's free refills on coffee. And to top it all off - there's a fantastic ambiance to the place, with hanging plants, lots of seating, fun map tables of different places around the US & Canada, WiFi if you need to get some stuff done, and very friendly staff.",2,,2

Order at the counter then find some seating, where they will bring your order to you when it's ready.- Can get a bit crowded, and the table we chose had the line wrap around it at one point.Food (4/5)- Challah French Toast: holy moly a nice size portion! The berry butter was also very good and flavorful, which paired well with the sweet maple syrup.- Sausage (side order): good but nothing special. One patty for $4.50, meh.- Cappuccino: good size and delicious.Price (4/5)- On par with other brunch place, French toast was worth it, though with the sides it can get a little pricey.",,,

I loved that it was easy to get to by train but on a chill back street of Chelsea. The decor was awesome as soon as we entered I noticed the cool paintings and the set up of the cafe was dope. There was a worker that helped us find a table and checked in that was really nice, you have to go to the register to order food and drinks. The barista was pleasant, I got the blueberry lemon cake as well as a yummy chai tea latte. My friend got the tuna melt and rasberry iced tea which she enjoyed. The music was blasting but not too loud that we couldn't hear ourselves talking. The vibe was amazing and when we left it felt like we were leaving our little hideaway spot. We will definitely be back to try food and other drinks.",1,,

27,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,476,780,4.0,5/5/2018,"This place is my go-to for a casual meeting with someone midday, when it's pretty empty: it's intimate yet relaxed and you can order an iced tea and just hang for a bit and they don't bother you. Otherwise, the food is nothing special - pretty basic American meals that range from a Caesar salad or fish tacos to pancakes and bacon and eggs.",1,,1

If I were planning ahead, though, I'd try to find somewhere with a bit more special food + less chaotic atmosphere. Came around noon on a Saturday, and had no problem ordering + finding a seat. Re: Atmosphere - A bit loud. Wish that orders were associated with numbers, because most the time the noise is employees calling out customer's names, wandering around to find their table. Re: Food - Pretty good! Grey Dog's Breakfast / Breakfast Special was relatively cheap for a city brunch, and the French toast was satisfying. Re: Drink - Would recommend the hazelnut coffee!",,,

I ordered the seared tuna taco and was so excited that I spent the $15 because it sounded amazing. I loved the fact that I could order it rare! Well, when it arrived I was very disappointed. There was a slab of tuna and a 1/4 avocado that wasn't even cut up! The seasoning was very bland and they sent no salt in the delivery. There was a side arugula salad which was OK but had no dressing on there or on the side. My friend's mac and cheese was decent and someone's salad came with stale pita. The place is not worth it and will never order from here again.",4,2,

No way of eating it with a fork whatsoever. Broke one egg and the whole plate was covered in egg yolk, (my strawberries and bananas that came with my French toast all drenched in uncooked egg yolk). Not only that, found piece of hair in my food, which is unbelievable. They are popular, get a lot of business but need to really pay attention to the quality.Edit: Spoked up about the hair.

Not sure if I was conned into the ratings here, but I definitely left with a fake smile.Coming into the restaurant, I noticed that it was ""semi"" self-serviced, because the waiters bring you the food.I actually like self-serviced restaurants, but the bad impression how I wasn't directed towards the utensils area before sitting down kinda got me rolling.It looks like a full-serviced restaurant.I tend to get very skeptical about leaving my food and personal belongings while I go get my utensils, especially when there's a lot of people.I'm not done yet.Also before I was done eating, I was asked to move over to the next table to accommodate other customers, which pissed me off, and that I told the waiter, ""I'm almost done.""From the loud noise, the waiter heard wrong and thought I said, ""I'm done."" Took off with my uneaten sunny-side egg, and there goes my $18.Definitely not my type of place for breakfast and brunch! Sorry!",,,

34,Will H.,"New York, NY",206,11,2,2.0,7/8/2018,"I came here on my friend's birthday (July 4!) for brunch, and the experience ended up being pretty negative.  I think the kitchen was a little overwhelmed, but we ended up waiting almost an hour for our food, and when it arrived, one of the dishes had chicken so undercooked that parts of it were raw...You go up to the counter to order food and pay, and then they bring it to your table.  We arrived around noon and ordered by about 12:15, but then the food didn't arrive until after 1pm.  It was my friend's birthday, so we asked if they had a candle we could use, and they had a small tabletop candle, which was a nice touch, so I brought it to the table as a surprise as we sang Happy Birthday.It was a nice start, but as the time went on, we weren't sure when our food would arrive.  We checked on it twice, and both times they said it was ""almost out"", but it still took about 25 minutes after the first check and another 10 minutes after the second time.When the food finally arrived, 2 of my friends who didn't get chicken (a reuben and a BLT) had decent food, but my friend and I who both got chicken sandwiches found our chicken was undercooked.  And my friend's was raw--after he took a bite you could see the pink and feel the squishiness!We then tried to use ketchup, and the top fell off of the bottle!  Interestingly, we had seen a Yelp review that mentioned the same thing, but we thought it was a fluke.  Maybe not...By this point, we were not having a great experience, and my friend went to return his raw chicken.  They offered to recook it, but by this point, we were ready to leave and get some sustenance elsewhere, so he declined.  We were a little surprised they didn't offer to refund us for it, but to be fair, we didn't ask for a refund when one wasn't offered.  I only ended up eating about a third of my undercooked (but not raw) chicken sandwichI'm hoping that this experience was just due to an understaffed and rushed kitchen on the 4th of July because the long waits and the seriously undercooked chicken is not something I'd hope is a regular occurrence.It's a shame because I think the atmosphere was quite nice, but ultimately a restaurant is about food, and if it takes forever and is improperly cooked, it's really hard to find something to redeem it.",2,,1
35,Nicole I.,"New York, NY",1,49,0,2.0,7/4/2018,"Fine place, but just doesn't stand out in any way. I've had the cauliflower rice stir fry, which was so bland and soggy I couldn't finish it, and the Greek salad, which was uninspired and overtaken by Romain lettuce. The vegan cornmeal blackberry cake had an off flavor, sort of like it was soaked in beer, and not in a good way. The place itself is very loud. And you order at the counter. While I'm fine with this, I'd expect the resulting meal to be cheaper. The redeeming feature in my mind, and the reason I'll probably go back eventually, is the cider. Seriously, I don't know how they curate their selection, but both times I ordered cider, it was perfect: crisp, dry, tangy, and full of flavor. What's the secret? Why can't I find this taste in a supermarket cider?",2,,

38,Adelina M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",391,303,676,3.0,1/25/2018,"To be fair what I got was delicious but for the price that I paid I don't know. I'm all for restaurants that charge what they think is appropriate for food. But this place made me wait in line, get my own water, and also get my own silverware. Part of going out is the appeal of not having to do anything other than order and eat. While the grey dog was really good the appeal of having to do more than just eat was taken away by having to take care of myself while there. Granted I understand that that is a snotty attitude, but I was not prepared for that before I got there. Maybe if I come again I will know what to expect and therefore not be confused over wire had to do so much work.The menu is huge and therefore took a little bit of time for me to really pin down what I wanted. I ended up getting a lemonade, it was fresh squeezed and I could not resist and the Reuben sandwich. The sandwich came with a side of fries which was nice. The food was delicious and good and I even got to share a salad with some of my friends who ordered one for the table. I just don't know if the total price that I paid for my meal was really worth what I got. I think that I need to come again with the right mindset and then make a better opinionThe decor was also really pretty and it was a nice place to hang out. I think that while fun it hasn't been my favorite place to eat while in New York. I need a second go around to fully for my opinion. So I look forward to that second go around and to see if maybe I was just hungry and angry and was being a little too picky.",2,,1

I love the fact that its super spacious and you can choose to sit where ever you like. You have to order at the counter and then grab utensils, napkins, and water yourself, cafeteria style, so there's no pressure to tip for a great, casual sit-down experience. We ordered the Challah French Toast to share and the guy who took my order was so sweet and attentive that he stopped what he was doing immediately to take care of me. It just happened that what he was doing was tying on his apron, so he was using the POS with one hand, hanging onto his apron strings mid-knot with the other hand, and still talking and smiling to me! Talk about putting the customer first :D French toast tasted great and came with a small cup of maple syrup and another little cup of this raspberry(?)/strawberry(?) butter that was AMAZING. I was straight up was just eating it by itself. French toast came out just a degree more burnt that it probably should have been on one side, but I just flipped it over for the Instagram shot haha. The only tiny non-issues I have is that the presentation could have been a bit better as the syrup and butter came in those paper McDonald's ketchup cups, and the slices of toast could have been a tad thicker for the $12.",3,,1

I lucked out and the line wasn't long, I was greeted by a cool waiter dressed casually with flags around his neck. He reserved a table for me by placing a flag on it, and I stayed in line to order my food and pay. It felt a little cafeteria-ish, but it was nice to just sit and relax while my food was being prepared. The place got packed after I sat down, but somehow I didn't feel claustrophobic in the small space. The music was perrrfect. My food came and I was so happy with the of portions ( a girl's gotta eat!) I did have to get up and get my own utensils, which I totally didn't mind, but I kinda wish someone had explained the system to me a little bit. Basically you're own your own after your order is placed. Food itself was delicious. The eggs were runny which is a downside, but the bacon was crispy and the French toast seemed to melt in your mouth.",1,,

42,Ellen Y.,"Chicago, IL",207,248,45,4.0,7/18/2017,"I appreciate the concept of this really popular brunch place. When you walk in, there is someone to greet you at the door and ask for how many people in your party. And then, he leads you to a line where you can order and pay at the counter. I'd like this because at the end, you're not waiting for someone to wait on you and give you your check, but you can leave whenever you want.They have a great variety of breakfast and lunch options. It seem like they had something for everybody at the table, and my friends are definitely picky eaters. Overall, everyone agreed that the home fries were definitely something they would have to come back for. They were the perfect amount of crispiness and spice.It definitely got really busy around noon and the line built up, but get there for brunch hours and you won't have to wait!",2,,

I went with the Grey Dog's Breakfast which seems to be one of their favorites. Came with eggs any style (I went with scrambled), French Toast, and Sausage. Filled the plate right up and seemed like a fantastic bang-for-your-buck meal.Once you enter, they have an interesting method of putting a scarf / handkerchief on a table for you while you wait in line to order. Employees taking our order weren't overly friendly, which is what I'd honestly prefer as a New Yorker looking for a quick brunch. Food came out promptly and tasted hot off the skillet. Bathrooms were clean with napkins to dry your hands (I find the hand dryers to not work well and just make the bathroom less clean).

48,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,310,372,4.0,6/18/2017,"Not the first time I've been to The Grey Dog but definitely my first time in this particular location. Comparative to the location at university place(???), this one is spacier, more tables and more light. It's tables are still tightly packed depending on how many people come BUT it does seem to be a lot easier to seat my friend and I here. I was quite worried about seating since we came on a Sunday afternoon at around 1:15PM. However, as we stood in line (haha, my friend and I mistaked where the end of the line was. it was slightly embarrassing...), a waitstaff helped us bandana'ed a table to my immense relief - we had seats after our order! But the line for ordering was still quite long (which is good since I can't decide quickly on if I wanted a drink or not.)When we finally got up to order, it was quick and just a quick side note - NO DISCOVER CARDS (I didn't remember from my first time but it's not a big deal though.) After ordering, we grabbed our utensils, water and napkins and went straight to our seats. After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our orders were ready and we chowed down. I had ordered the poached egg and avocado salad which came with arugula (my favorite!) and smoked salmon (this is usually a hit or miss for me - FYI, this was a hit and it was even better with the lemon juice). My friend had gotten the grey dog breakfast with french toast and sausage (I believe?). Overall, the food was great! I really have no complaints and the portion was good (not too big, but just enough to be filling and I wasn't sleepy afterwards! But I suppose that's cause mine wasn't too carby) However, my friend thought her raspberry lemonade was a miss (Unfortunately! she really wanted to finish it.) - thought it was just a bit too sour for her taste. I would definitely come back for their other dishes. Maybe have a drink next time as well ;)I have to say though, the bathroom could be slightly cleaner. I feel that something was leaking since the floor was wet. :/ (I'm just picky since I'm not big on unclean bathrooms after a terrible experience while working at target for rotations and using the public bathroom. It was traumatizing but I digress)",1,,

You have host who walks around placing 'handkerchief' on table to reserve your spot while ordering which is self-service. You order find where the host have place the item. When the food comes out the waiter wanders around shouting your name to find where you maybe in the restaurant. You have to get your own water, and condiments as only the food is delivered to your table.Service is friendly millennial kind of way as most here are too busy staring at their phone while eating like the two couple sitting adjacent to us.

Accompanied by not a cute but rather a very sad, limp salad. Dining companion ordered a chicken sandwich--specifically asked for no cheese, but the mozzarella was there nonetheless.

60,Ashley L.,"New York, NY",259,140,62,3.0,8/20/2017,"I couldn't help leaving this restaurant feeling like my brunch experience could easily have been way better. The Grey Dog simply missed the mark for the casual brunch experience it advertised. The ambiance: We walked in, a table of three, expecting a host or server to great us. Instead we were greeted by an extremely long line stretching through the entire restaurant. At first we were confused; was this the line to be seated? There were a bunch of open tables so that didn't seem to be the case. We soon figured out the line was to the counter, where you order and pay, and then they bring your food to you a là Panera. For the price point, having to stand 30 minutes in line to order when someone could have easily seated us, taken our order, and served us by then not only showed a lack of intuition, but a lack of planning. The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance with cool paintings and wood detailing, but the chic hipster ambiance was ruined by the perpetual long line weaving its way in between tables. The food: We ordered a pitcher of sangria, he breakfast quesadilla, the bacon egg and cheese omelet, and the poached egg and avocado salad. The sangria was the star of the show, a rich red with apples and strawberries. $16 for a pitcher that serves 4 wasn't bad either. The poached egg and avocado salad however was pretty bad. First, it came completely undressed. It was arugula, sliced avocado, and 2 poached eggs. No seasoning to be found. We had to chase down an employee to get some dressing. Even with the dressing it was plain and lackluster. Thoroughly determined to never order anything healthy again, I switched with my fiancé and finished his breakfast quesadilla, which was loaded with eggs and cheese and impossible to get wrong. The service: For such a bizarre restaurant, the employees did their best. The counter employees seemed stressed out, and I doubt they get the tips they really deserve when the costumers have to order themselves at a counter after standing in line 30 minutes.",4,3,4

If you can, order a mimosa, it taste absolutely amazing and goes and hand-in-hand with any entree you order.  Although you do not have to tip, it is recommended that you do because the workers are extremely nice and well mannered. The only reason I say this is because you are required to stand in line to order and the tables within this restaurant are for you to sit and eat. There are no waiters taking your orders. The utensils and sauces have their own designated locations where you are required to get up and fetch them on your own.

They have free refills on coffee, you have to bring it up though. The tables and seating were quite tight. Seared Tuna & Avocado Taco ($14.95)- 3/5 The tuna itself was bland and needed a lot of condiments, good thing it came with salsa and sour cream. I still had to add hot sauce to give it more flavor. Some piece of the tuna was a bit ""stringy"" and that turned me off. It also comes with fries that taste like a better McDonald's, but are really delicious.

80,Kim C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,32,208,1.0,12/30/2017,"You have to pay tip for self service. Why??? How does that even make sense. Do you pay tip at by Chloe's? After waiting 30 min on a line which cuts through the middle of the restaurant forcing you to hover over seated customers, you are then led to a counter with a menu in the back and asked to pay prior to your meal. First of all, they should have given out paper menus to people waiting in line, so we didn't have to scramble to read the entire menu once we were in front of the cashier trying to make up our mind on the spot, feeling bad about holding up the line we were just on. Secondly, while on line, someone on their staff told us to remember this pink patterned handkerchief because it was going to be placed on a table for us after we paid for our food. We had to walk through the entire restaurant to find this particular handkerchief because there were several empty tables...yet the wait still took awhile, perhaps due to my first point. Once we were at the cashier and ordered our dish, he gave us a receipt and pen for us to fill out the tip portion. Excuse me? Tip for what?? I just waited in line for 30 min and for all I knew I was about to get my own food too. Shouldn't the service have been provided first BEFORE asking for tip? How am I supposed to judge how much tip, I as the customer should give if there was no service completed?? This was outrageous, nevertheless me and my friend tipped 15% because we felt obliged to at the counter in front of the cashier. After we were seated we came to another AWFUL realization. The SINGLE waiter did not know party names so when he was trying to deliver the food and after we got ours, he kept calling out different names and one of them, I will never forget because it was my own name ""Kim"" was called out 5 times as he paced back and forth trying to find the party. By the 5th time I was ready to say ""over here"" because it was so disturbing to the entire atmosphere to hear names being shouted out every other minute while we were trying to have our meals and converse with each other. Oh here's another thing, it was only AFTER we got our meals that the waiter told us to get our own utensils and water, which was very unsanitary because there were grease smudges on almost every cup. I really don't understand what kind of service this was and do NOT think it was right for them to charge tip BEFORE we were even seated much less before we were given our meal.  TLDR: Not worth the hype, you can take your money to another brunch place that has no wait time. They make you tip before you get your food. Atmosphere sucks unless you like hearing random names being called out when you're trying to eat, or if you like people staring at you eat because they're trying to wait on line to order their own food.

They were quick to welcome us, accommodating in seating, eager to take our orders, and easily accessible for any issues we may have had. The wait was not long and the food was delicious; I recommend the goat cheese and avocado sandwich as it bordered on life-changing for me. We will definitely come back.",,,
86,Kyle S.,"Cambridge, MA",398,239,327,4.0,7/7/2017,"Really nice breakfast place in between Chelsea market and Union Square. I came here on my way to the high line for a quick breakfast. Although it was slightly difficult to find at first, the someone hidden entrance opened to this rich, organically designed breakfast restaurant. The staff was patient with my indecisiveness, as it took me a while to choose what I wanted from the large breakfast menu. Although initially a little confused on how to order, I realized you walk up to the counter, order, and sit. Then to get refills on your coffee (a huge plus), you walk up to the coffee refill counter. My omelette was really nice except the price seemed to exponentially increase with each ingredient, but I hope to go back to try some more!",,,1

89,Kimmy U.,"New York, NY",220,378,1226,4.0,1/4/2017,"Brunch done right! Minus the wait, I was very happy with our food selection.The way it works:1. Get in line to order. As you are waiting, someone will ask you how many in your party and he/she will find a table for you and mark it with a colorful handkerchief2. Order at the front3. Grab utensils and water4. Find your handkerchiefUnique concept, and works well! We thought we were going to have to scout out a table, but nope! They have that covered.--Grey Dog Breakfast: 2 eggs any style, either sausage/ham/bacon, french toast OR pancakes, and PERFECTLY CRISPY POTATOES (aka my fave part). We opted for the french toast, which comes with fruit. SO happy with this. It comes with a lot of food, so share or take home the rest. If you're sharing with someone, I suggest ordering something small as well. --Chicken soup with meatballs: just like Italian wedding soup! Loved the mini meatballsThey have a pretty extensive menu with salads, pastas, sandwiches, and breakfast items. I wanna try the sandwiches next time, but it'll be pretty hard to stray from the Grey Dog breakfast!",,,

Walking in around 7:00pm on a Friday night we were greeted by a friendly hostess who filled us in on how The Grey Dog works. I'm a big fan of efficiency, so I was a happy camper when my order was in and we were seated in under 5. Needing some good ole' comfort food, I order the sharp cheddar mac ($11) which comes with either a side of fries or a salad. Like any grown adult, I ordered a side of carbs to go with my carbs. Everything arrived pretty quickly despite it being a packed house. Our food was prepared well but it was missing some much needed seasoning. Maybe our taste buds were off that night but everything needed a good shake of S&P. All in all, Grey Dog is a great spot to grab a quick bite to eat if you want something fancier than fast food, but don't have a whole lot of time for a sit down meal.",,,
92,Sami M.,"Castleton-on-Hudson, NY",127,48,67,5.0,9/10/2017,"Had a great brunch here to celebrate my friend's birthday! Came on a Sunday around 12:30pm and waited in line for about a half hour. Seated and served by one. You come in, wait in line to order, then sit after you pay. It eliminates waiting to pay before you leave! It wasn't as busy when we left around 2. Food was awesome, there are so many options and I can't wait to come back for dinner sometime! Pros:-my friend has come here dozens of time and really loves it here-really nice atmosphere & vibe-good location-high quality food lots of options & accommodations-super fair pricing, totally worth every penny Cons:-seating isn't too spacious (normal New York space)-my friend had an egg shell in her eggs but she's come so much and that's never happened before so she didn't send it back or make a big deal. She still loves it here.Don't miss this place! (There's another location in the city too)",,,

It's a good portion size though I have to admit the pancakes are just okay. Salads are also super tasty and interesting combos. Good coffee too.Great for when you want something easy and casual, but a bit more elevated than a standard diner or fast casual spot.Also for Michigan fans- all the Grey Dog locations have little references throughout the cafes :) Go Blue!",,,
94,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",465,862,4808,1.0,8/17/2016,"This place was a train wreck when my group of 8 came Sunday night. My friend wanted to come here for his birthday dinner because the cafe reminds him of restaurants back in Michigan. Apparently the owner is also from Michigan. A few people in my group really disliked the restaurant by the end of the night. Everything was chaotic and unorganized. Ordering was extremely confusing. You have to order at the counter and then they bring out your food to the table. At first the cashier said we needed to order on one receipt for our large party. My friend ordered for 5 people and was about to order for the last two, but then the cashier seemed to change her mind and said we needed to order separately. You also have to go up and get your own utensils. Like my friend said, there's no good reason not to have table service. It's annoying because there's no service and you tip beforehand when you order your food.Random people bring out your food from the kitchen by walking around and calling out people's names. So inefficient especially since the restaurant is so loud you can't hear them call out anything. They really should have some table number stand system. They got our order wrong twice and two people didn't receive their sandwiches until 20 min. after everyone else got their food. By then everyone else already finished eating.Service was terrible, but I wouldn't have minded if the food was good at least. It was not. The food was mediocre and expensive for not a lot of food. The chicken tenders were dry and the fries were the really cheap quality frozen kind. They were also unsalted. The pesto avocado pasta with chicken was really bland and needed salt. The turkey brie apple sandwich wasn't bad. They did have one drink called the Pink Lady that was actually pretty good and refreshing.One redeeming factor is they were happy to charge my friend's phone for him and also brought out plates and a knife for our cake. Overall, I think I'd give this place 1.5 stars, but since you can't give half stars I'm rounding down. Maybe this place is a lot better for lunch or brunch but definitely avoid for dinner.",12,8,9

What we ate...Cold brew-mediocreFries- averageAvocado toast-the nine grain didn't taste as nutty or seedy as I like but it ok. One downfall is they SUPER skimp on the avocado. Most places use more butter on buttered toast than this place has avocado on the avocado toast.Grey dogs breakfast- super yum challah French toast, fresh fruit, extra crispy bacon just the way I like it and perfectly poached eggs over a piece of bread (genius! Soaks of the water from being poached) and their breakfast potatoes holy Hannah they are the best potatoes ever! Are they baked?

You enter and go up to the counter to order while a hostess finds you a table. You order your food and drinks and pay right then and there, then pick up your utensils and whatever else you may want and head to your seats. Kinda strange, but unique. I ordered the chicken salad melt and it was delicious. I was surprised because usually I'm picky with chicken salad anywhere besides the bagel place by my house, but this was great. Simple but tasty. The chicken salad itself had onions, celery, carrots and mayo. It was served on toasted bread of your choice then topped with melted cheese and bacon. Excellent. My friend ordered the poached egg salad. She said it was dressed very nicely and she enjoyed it. It was two poached eggs, avocado, salmon, and greens. I had the white sangria as well, but wasn't a fan of it. As a whole, I am definitely interested in coming back here to try more food!",1,,1

The first bite was good.  There were A LOT of pickles (which is typical in a Cuban of course) and A LOT of mustard but this didn't bother me all that much.  What bothered me was the amount of pork on the sandwich and how fatty it was. So much fat, so so gross.  In the whole sandwich I got maybe 2 bites worth of good shredded pork.  So disappointing.  I would have easily traded in some of those pickles for a bit more meat.",6,3,2

The employees were friendly and made ordering easy. I got the avocado toast with french fries which I literally could not stop talking about during my stay in the city.

It comes with a side of fruit or salad or fries as well which is great! I added an egg which was a great addition.

The sandwiches were prepared rather quickly and brought to our table in 10 mins. I thought the Cuban sandwich wasn't anything special, I've had better elsewhere.

111,Mark T.,"Weymouth, MA",234,451,494,4.0,3/25/2017,"So... I was contemplating what kind of rating to give this place... stuck between three and four stars. I wanted to give three stars because maybe aside from the potatoes, there is nothing here that is particularly spectacular. I wanted to, and decided on four stars, because, well, that's the point. You see, there are some places where you go because you want to have something amazing, something you cannot make yourself, or maybe can, but it would require a tremendous amount of effort, and use more dishes than you have in the cabinets. Other places you go because you just don't feel like cooking, washing dishes, etc. This is the latter, you come here not because you want something unique, but because you want a simple, no frills breakfast. I had the Grey Dog breakfast with French Toast and Bacon, with my eggs over easy. Also came with potatoes and a bit of fruit. Portion was excellent, there was enough that I did not leave the place hungry, but not so much that I felt bloated or overfull. Eggs, french toast (regular, not challah), and bacon were all okay. There was nothing wrong or spectacular about any of these items. I could say all kinds of little things that could make any of these three items better, but then it wouldn't be no-frills.Potatoes are the star on the plate. These little pieces come hot out of the fryer (at least they did for me). They were no oily or greasy, but they were awesomely crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside. Cooked perfectly! Coffee was solid, no frills. I also really liked two things, the station where you could grab your condiments, and add milk/sugar to your coffee (they also have liquid sugar - sometimes called simple syrup). They also have a special station for getting refills, so waiting in the general line is not necessary for a refill.Finally, I would like to mention that the kitchen does not open at the same time as the restaurant (a little later), so if you come here early, you may be able to get coffee and maybe a bakery item (don't remember if these were out), but for food you may have to wait a little bit.

Mac and cheese, pancakes, french toast, eggs, sandwiches, soup, pumpkin pie and everything in between.

The Grey Dog Breakfast = Combo of everything. Eggs (any style), french toast OR pancakes, and bacon/sausage/ham. I decided to replace the meat with fruit. YUM. Anytime there is mac and cheese on the menu at a restaurant, I feel like I am obligated to try it. Sooooo i did. Never regret mac and cheese, EVER.

Knowing how crowded brunch can get on Saturday mornings anywhere, I made sure to get there before 9:30am, which gave me time to enjoy my brekky before heading off to the airport. Since I was there early enough, there were only a few people ahead of me in line. They have an interesting process of ordering and seating. As you wait in line, one of the hipster servers asks how many people are in your party and shows you a bandana that you have to look out for as he uses it as a marker to show you where you'll be seated. Okay...sure. I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelette which came with toast and their home fries. The veggies tasted very fresh. I'm not a fan of potatoes in general, but I actually liked their home fries. The coffee was pretty good too. Overall, it was a nice atmosphere for breakfast. It feels cozy. I dig the maps that decorated each table. As I was wrapping up, I noted the line was already forming outside the door. I would say prices are standard for brunch. My meal was $13. Though I was a bit horrified when I saw a cup of orange juice cost almost $4. But I would come here again if I'm in town.

I was worried that the goat cheese would overpower the sandwich, since so many places slather it on, but Grey Dog does it perfectly.The only downside is it's a Michigan bar. For an Ohio State fan, that's torture. However, all the pictures of dogs inside the cafe make up for their poor taste in sports teams.",2,1,1

140,Joanna E.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,4.0,4/1/2018,I live in the neighborhood and this is one of my go-tos. Food is always made fresh (sandwiches are a personal favorite. I love that you can choose your own bread from 7 fresh-baked options brought in daily from Brooklyn and they come with a great side salad). Lots of breakfast options (especially for the health conscious and picky eaters). Soups are a little underwhelming and vary by day. Atmosphere is fun and warm/cozy. Hard to get a seat during peak weekend hours but worth the wait.,,,

Very tasty and no difference detected - which makes Grey Dog my continued goto for breakfast for sure!Glueten-free friendly spot and has the hungry cat relieved to fill a craving of a breakfast spot!",3,,1

This morning's Grey Dog Breakfast had GF french toast instead. Still great, but please please please bring the GF pancakes back!",,,
149,Sy Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",263,210,1809,4.0,8/12/2016,"Heard good things about this place so we decided to drop in on a random Tuesday. Eventually, there was good amount of lunch crowd but when we walked in, it was not busy at all. Stood in line and while waiting, waiter came by to let us know which color bandana will be waiting on the table. So far so good. Interior or the vibe was very organic and low key. Self service water & utensil station was set up near the ordering counter. Ordered their famous Grey dog breakfast with French toast, sausage, side of home fries and 2 eggs cooked any style all for $13.99.  Also ordered kid's meal chicken tender's $8 and a very small bowl of zucchini pasta with pesto $6.99 & 1 orange juice. Had to ask for itemized receipt since our total came to approx. $42.00 before tip.  At first things did not seem to add up but shortly realized that small side of bacon was over $5 and very small cup of OJ was about $5 as well. Food was not bad. Signature grey dog breakfast was delicious.  Kids menu chicken strips & fries were ok. As it cooled down, the ridges of chicken became so hard it made us doubt if they served it by heating it up in the microwave.  Ended up not being able to finish the plate.  Zucchini pasta came with an option to take it as vegan or regular.  Zucchini was cooked well. There was just enough texture to keep you chewing. Tasted delicious in its own ways, if you like clean veggie flavor. Overall, service was satisfactory and it's a nice spot for weekday brunch.",3,3,3

There's a grey dog breakfast (classic english breakfast) and then omelettes and some avocado salad thing, all of which were all right but nothing to write on Yelp about.

It's like being forced to tip at Chipotle. But the guy who was helping save tables for patrons was nice so I obliged. I ordered the egg and cheese on croissant but added avocado and held the cheese. My kids both got eggs any style, one with French toast. I ordered a side of bacon with my sandwich which was a dollar extra and gave to my daughter instead of her ordering a side of bacon for $5.

While in line you can view the menu or see all the yummy stuff they have on the wall. Everything in this place is great especially for brunch! My go to is the ""the grey dog breakfast"" which is eggs, toast, fries, and your choice of pancakes or challah toast. They have the best shoe sting fries and hazelnut coffee.

Their line system consists of waiting in line, receiving a table assignment marked by a bandana, tipping at the register before you receive your food at your table, collecting your utensils/waters. Unique for sure, but from an efficiency standpoint didn't make sense to me. Doesn't this just foment more crowd congestion? Why hire a full waiting staff just to bring plates and bus tables?

It's a cute little nook that has many choices and a warm home like feeling. Each of us ordered the gray dog breakfast and we were all very pleased, very full and happy with this place! We will definitely come again. My mom actually wants to order their catering in the future and we live outside of Philadelphia so that tells you something. Thank you Gray Dog!!! :-)",,,
196,L W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,634,1499,3.0,11/1/2016,Hubs and I came here for lunch after passing by this place a few times. I ordered the Seared Tuna Taco rare with a side of fries. It was a bit disappointing because the tuna was thin and resembled rare meat. Hubs ordered the Avocado Challah Toast with a side salad. His order was pretty good. Bread was soft and avocado was delicious along with the salad. Service was quick and friendly. Will return to try other items on the menu.,2,1,1

198,Esther C.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,239,100,4.0,12/7/2015,"Came here yesterday for a late lunch. I ordered the lunch Quesadilla and Cheese Fries. Lunch Quesadilla came with roasted tomatoes, sour cream, cheese (not sure what kind, but it was a stronger tasting cheese), grilled chicken, and salsa. I thought the Quesadilla was good but kind of bland. The cheese fries were delicious and amazing. Just fried enough and cheese had enough cheesey flavor. Did not know I could get so excited about cheese and fries...The way this place work is pretty interesting. You order at the counter and sit down. Food comes pretty fast. It's kind of confusing if you're a first timer though because it's not obvious what to do. I thought the servers were pretty easy to wave down, but service felt a little confusing. Overall, I enjoyed and would definitely return for a second visit.",1,,
199,Iana D.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",230,106,300,5.0,2/7/2016,"I have been here three times and two out of those three times, I ordered the grey dog's breakfast. The portions are so big that you should go here with an empty stomach. But be prepared to wait on line! Especially for brunch on weekends. We waited about 30 minutes on the line on a Sunday, around 1 p.m. The food comes out really fast though. And it is sooo worth the wait and $$! Will keep coming back for their brunch. Their Mexican hot chocolate weirdly tastes like oatmeal, but I surprisingly liked it anyways. The Grey Dog's breakfast consists of French toast or pancakes, hash browns, sausage or bacon, and eggs (however you like).",,,
