Drinks are pretty yummy, and beans are always strong when i'm lazy enough to make my own coffee.It's just got that a real coffee place vibe as a opposed to the corporate starbucks or dunkin that that you see.But please note, this place is a community favorite and it can get very busy. Most of the locals, police officers and firemen stop by here to get their morning fix, so there get be a line and a wait during the early morning. It's nyc, I get it. Music is also on point.",

I'm a die hard Blue bottle/La colombe drinker but this place is my new go-to spot. Super rare to find Robusta instead of Arabica on this side of the globe and this place carries so many types of coffee (beans). Prices are hard to beat.,

I appreciated that there was no tip line to fill when I used my credit card. I get tired of being expected to add another dollar onto already expensive coffee drinks. Lots of locals coming in and out, so you know it's good!",

So I stopped by this shop.  Got a banana nut muffin and a hazelnut cafe.  Very delicious ! The lady must of put extra milk or something to make it so creamy.  The hazelnut was not to overpowering which is good. It's a quaint place. Looks like many locals come here. Will come back,2

Oh well, decent coffee but expect Port Authority/Times Square type of attitude.",
5,,9/21/2018,85,,"Manhattan, NY",Delilah T.,0,5.0,12,"I love it here so much. Consistently delicious coffee on a daily basis. I literally go every morning after I clock in for work. I usually get the americano or the snooki. Every time I order it the same great taste of fresh, properly made coffee. The staff is so good as well except for one rude ass guy I can't stand, but the others make up for that for being so awesome. They have a punch card system too which is great way to try new coffee once you reach you 10 ""punches"" and it's free. I can go on about this place . If you work/live in the area forget the fast food coffee try here. Lastly the prices are standard nothing crazy.",

I didn't get their fancy lattes (although I was intrigued!) and instead got a regular cup of coffee. and WOW, was it good. It had a smooth and sweet flavor that I've never quite experienced anywhere else. I came here around 5:30 so it was pretty slow and I thought the service was very quality. It may depend on what time you come and who serves you but if I'm in the area again, I'll definitely be making another stop here!",
7,,2/12/2018,702,,"New York, NY",Lena W.,12,4.0,26,"I love the service I received at the store; the man was very kind. However, I asked for a little half and half in my iced coffee and had to wait for a bunch of readjustments when there was way too much cream. I also purchased the nutty banana muffin, which was a little too sweet for my taste, didn't have enough banana flavor and only walnuts on the muffin top. I will likely come back because I like the look and charm of this shop. Note that there is a rewards/punch card for a free drink after 10 drink purchases. There are about 6 two top small round cafe tables that could be accommodated for large groups if you adjust the chairs around them or push two tables together. Overall not too busy to sit and have a decent conversation.",
8,,2/18/2018,190,,"Weehawken, NJ",Lee S.,15,5.0,89,"Absolutely loved the cappuccino.  Often in coffee stores like this, only coffee beans are sold.  But here, they sell coffee and brew it.  One thing I am curious to know, is if they let you choose which coffee to have by the cup.  If so, then that would be a major bonus, because it would be a great way to sample many varieties before committing to a whole pound.  Will definitely want to come back.",
9,1,7/15/2016,605,,"New York, NY",Natalie K.,801,4.0,382,Nice local coffee shop in midtown west. they have a huge selection of coffee beans and teas. You can buy coffee beans and have them grind it. Besides the coffee beans they also make some great espresso/ coffee drinks. One of their signature drinks is the Snooki. Coffee with Mexican hot chocolate. Amazing!!They have both soy and almond milk option for the non dairy folks. It's the kinda spot that locals know about and is frequented by neighborhood folks and lots of the police officers from port authority. Great spot for yummy coffee and to support a small local business. Prices are way more reasonable than other 'high end' coffee stores or Starbucks. staff is always really friendlyRemember to get the rewards card so you get a free drink for every 10 drinks purchased,2

Looked on Yelp and this coffee shop instantaneously popped up. The best part about it was that they provided half an lb option - essentially you could give a try on something new without worrying about wasting the beans if not like it.Indeed a great selection in front of me and I already lost my decision making ability...As I prefer a smooth and light coffee, I followed their suggestion and went with the Indian Malibar. It turned out to be a great choice after I brewed my cappuccino at home. Would for sure return and explore something new next time!",4

13,,9/13/2016,126,,"Los Angeles, CA",Josie T.,266,5.0,139,"Had to jump on the Snooki bandwagon, it's just too good. It's iced hazelnut coffee with Mexica cocoa + spices, and I prefer it with almond milk. Smooth and sweet, the perfect ""dessert"" drink that packs the caffeine boost I need in the afternoon.The entire staff is extremely nice and helpful. Since the menu is mostly custom drinks, they always take the time to explain any drink I'm curious about. They also have a few great iced tea options, including one I can't remember the name of but is essentially 5 different teas mixed into one that ends up tasting like passionfruit :)",1
14,,5/7/2017,38,,"Los Angeles, CA",A M.,13,5.0,64,"This is my most favorite place to buy coffee in all of Manhattan. It still has a little old school NYC grit and character, but also has a huge selection of highest quality while bean coffee.

15,,3/26/2017,12,,"Tarpon Springs, FL",Nick M.,36,5.0,13,The smell hits you like a warm blanket upon entering. Huge sacks of whole beans line the wall to the left while the baristas steam and press and mix up mochas on the right. A true coffee emporium that offers extremely fresh coffee and tea in a beautifully aerobatic setting.,

Where has this place been all my life?Empire coffee is fantastic; the people are friendly, the drinks are special, and the prices are amazing! I've gotten the Snookie both times I've been, and I'm not quite sure what it is, but it is perfect! There are so many other options on the menu, and I'm not quite sure what else to try next! You definitely will spend less here than at other coffee shops in New York, but the quality won't be any worse! Empire also sells coffee beans for about $10 a pound, and they have a huge variety lined up in bags along the wall. I'd imagine if you love grinding your own coffee, you'll find a blend perfect for you here. Definitely my go to place for coffee from now on!",1
19,,10/16/2016,88,2,"New York, NY",The Krissy I.,7,1.0,79,"I've lived two blocks from this coffee shop for almost 10 years. I've frequented it, it's my go-to when I want a lovely latte or coffee beans. Before I felt compelled to review this place, I would have given this establishment 5 stars. But no longer.  Quick Story: The owner is a trump supporters and has propaganda in the store right now, dogs were allowed in to grab a coffee - it was a neighborhood pleasure and it was special -  that is now gone, small german roaches in and around the beans. THE EMPLOYEES ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE. (this is not about them) 1.) A few weeks ago the owner, who is apparently a Trump fan, put up chocolate bars for sale right where you have to wait to order that have Hilary all over them saying ""HELL NO HILLARY"" and another one of trump's photo saying let's vote for him. I have the photo and I will attach it soon. 2.) Pets and Service Animals. For the past 20 years the place has been a huge fan of locals because they do not sell cooked food there and you can stroll in during your morning walk with your pup and get your cup of joe. NO LONGER because of ONE email sent to the owner from ONE woman.  Did the owner survey the rest of his clientele? No? Okay. When I was informed that I could no longer come in with pup, okay fine, I was then told even service animals won't be allowed. Uh, that's illegal. 3.) Roaches. After going there for 9 years I've witnessed countless roaches IN the coffee beans and now around the store. I'm not easily skeeved out, but now that I'm writing a review, I might as well mention it. Especially since I can no longer go into this establishment.",5
20,,8/7/2016,80,,"New Orleans, LA",Ardalan M.,80,5.0,77,"Um yes. The Snooki is awesome. I took the suggestion of another Yelper and got the one with almond milk.  The picture I took isn't all that but honey the flavor is on fire. They also have the little small bite sized chocolates like the mini York patties and mini bite sized Toblerones as adjunctive treats!So, if you sit in the store and enjoy your drink like I did, you will listen to every song I like.  The playlist was Madonna, Miley Cyrus and later Adam Lambert. I think I may have released a ""gasp"" when I heard Madonna's Like A Virgin play and then a fellow customer started chuckling.I will be back.",1

Updated review",47,,"New York, NY",Chantel P.,22,3.0,77,"Update...After YEARS of  coming to Empire, the owner is making changes. It no longer feels like the neighborhood spot. No more dogs on your morning walk, the staff is ever changing probably because of the management and finally-----NO MORE $1 refills **insert crying emoji**. After over 5 years of coming here, its a big disappointment. With several competitors in the area popping up; I would think they may want to keep their clients and the incentive programs  offered.They kept folks returning. I'm sorry to see all the changes and now this last one, saddens me.",
24,,10/22/2016,7,,"West Milford, NJ",Joe T.,10,5.0,35,Great place to buy coffee. Last week I bought chocolate raspberry this week I bought Kahlua and cream. They grind it up for you. Customer service is great here. It's very convenient to Port Authority,
25,,3/1/2015,304,,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",Cat V.,85,4.0,236,"I've been to both the Hoboken and NYC locations, and this one is the better of the two. Conveniently located on 9th Ave, half block away from Port Authority bus terminal and a 1-2 blocks away from 42nd St/Times Square. The owner is always in the store, providing a knowledgeable and ready to serve attitude. The other baristas are also friendly and understand all that is coffee. As far as the coffee is concerned, is the good quality at a reasonable price for a local joint. They have a huge variety of whole beans that you can mix and get ground if preferred. I'm generally a drip coffee fan and criticize a coffee shop by just that. Empire does it right. I haven't tried the teas but I'm sure they are just as divine. Empire also has homemade fresh pastries such as, muffins, biscottis, and cookies aside from chocolate bars, sweet covered nuts and gluten free products. In addition to the baked and packaged goods, they also sell coffee and tea paraphernalia. Best time of the year to get an Empire fix is in the fall/winter but the coffee/tea concoctions on ice are equally yummy.",3
26,,3/4/2016,298,,"Manhattan, NY",Michael R.,25,5.0,73,"Founded in 1908, yes, 1908, Empire Coffee is by far my favorite place to get a hot cup of Joe in Madhattan.  I've been drinking there for years, from back in the day when Hell's Kitchen lived up to it's name, whatever that means.  Right beside Port Authority Bus Terminal on the NE corner of 41st & 9th, it's a little caffeinated oasis in the land of Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts (Yuck!). They've got some seriously good stuff.When you walk in you immediately inhale the air of deliciousness.  Empire has over 30 different coffee beans that they sell for around $10 a pound.  I like to go through and smell all the different flavors before deciding on what coffee concoction I'll be sippin'. Their signature 'Snookie' is a big favorite as is their Mexican spiced hot coco. They have a small little area up front to sit that the locals conjugate at.  I've had some pretty interesting conversations with some seriously strange characters there. The staff is nice and the place in a great location. My only beef is that they don't have a bathroom, as coffee always makes me, well, you know. But hey, just find a Starbucks nearby and use the can there!",2

But other than that, the coffee was good and very fresh--I bought a half pound of the coconut whole beans and aside from just the smell, the aftertaste actually tasted like coconut. If you're going to purchase this flavor, it tastes best with a french press with a bit of cream to get out the most of that coconut flavor.",

The last time, a gentleman was on his lunch and he was nice enough to leave his lunch to help after he saw I looked a bit confused. In general, most of the employees here were nice and helpful.

It has a wide selection of open burlap bag roasted beans for sale in any quantity or mix you desire.  Too, it is loaded with quality teas, and the tools of the brewing trade - all in a mid Twentieth Century store front with a comfortable self confident air about it.  Small sitting area, but this is a cash and carry trade here, primarily for bus and theater waiters to step in, belly up and move out. It has a pleasant old school vibe, and very good coffee at reasonable prices.  This is a far superior joint to visit for your caffeine needs than the green mermaid, who seems to spread like mold in every corner of the city.  This family run business is definitely there for you.  They are in it to win you over and keep you a customer for life.",6

The iced coffee is ok, somewhat watery, and the funky latte I tried was very strange and flavored too strongly. The muffins I tried here were also not very good, and the other food offerings are paltry (biscotti is not my thing for breakfast). I just keep coming here because it's one of the closer coffee shops near my place, but next time I may just walk a little further to get to Starbucks.",2

I eventually got my way over to Empire and was kinda disappointed. First off I was put off by the fact that none of the signage mentioned when the beans were roasted. Also, the employees weren't all that informative nor did it seem as if they wanted to help. The knockout punch was a cup of bland lukewarm ""continental"" coffee. Off to the next place.",1

They quite a diverse selection of coffee beans available for purchase. However, take one look at their specialty drink menu, and you won't want to make your coffee at home. After scoping out the menu, the ""iced snookie"" caught my eye. I had to ask. It's hazelnut iced coffee with Mexican chocolate. SIGN ME UP. It was love at first gulp.

Upon walking in, we loved what we saw: rustic, vintage, quirky decor and rows of open bags of aromatic coffee beans lining the walkway. My bf ordered a hot chocolate and I ordered a green tea latte. Sadly, the drinks didn't live up to the nice interior atmosphere. The hot chocolate was sickly sweet and my green tea latte had the strangest aftertaste... half splenda, half hand lotion (with a dash of shampoo). Perhaps they didn't clean one of their apparatuses properly? Who knows. At first, I thought I was imagining it but the more sips I took, the more prominent the taste became. I've drank many green tea lattes in my life and none were as atrocious as this one. I should have probably asked for a remake but after tasting the sickly syrupy mess my bf got, I decided against the trouble.I can't say I'd come back to this place ever though the atmosphere was nice and the service was pleasant.

I took a small one because I always get dissapointed in new places I try, but this time I actually regretted not taking a larger size.

Updated review",0,,"Seattle, WA",Atina T.,0,5.0,9,"I love Empire Coffee!  I frequent this neighborhood for the fish market, the meat market, the veggie market, the spice market and now I can add coffee and tea market to the list.  This area of the city is where cooks go to buy their provisions because it's about the food and not about pretentious storefronts or prices.  Empire has a huge selection, at least 40, of loose bagged coffee beans in burlap sacks that are roasted at the owners home in upstate NY.  Shipments arrive about once a week and they have a steady stream of customers so turnover is fast.  For the ""house blend"" they mix 3-4 different beans from South America.  But of course the best part of Empire is the coffee.  Whether you order a cup to go or take home a bag or 12 of their different roasts from every conceivable coffee growing country in the world, you will be VERY happy.  This place isn't fancy or posh or shishi.  They do have 3 internet computers, 2 of which are broken,  and 2 wooden benches where you can sit.  But who cares!  Empire is all about their coffee and it's for people who want a very good cup of it.  If you want cushioned chairs, electrical outlets every 4 inches, wifi or soft elevator music, then go to Starbucks and get the usual cup-o-burned-crap.  If you want great coffee at a really good price, go to Empire!",4

I also got a 1/2 lb of whole bean french roast Mocha Java blend (about $7, standard price) to take home, which I've since sampled several times. It's tasty, but I won't get it again - I'd rather get coffee just as good or better for less money from Porto Rico Importing.I must say the service here is superbly friendly, and while there is very little seating - sacks of coffee beans occupy most of the open space - the staff are cool about letting customers linger for extended periods. So if you can grab a seat (or wooden bench), do, because it's a pleasant, quiet place to chat with friends.Sadly, they do NOT have a bathroom here, although when I first entered I was in dire need of one, in fact so direly that I was on the verge of tears, and the kindly barista let me use the staff restroom when I pleaded my case.

165,,5/28/2013,17,,"Manhattan, NY",Dayna G.,0,4.0,48,I love this local coffee shop!  It is certainly way higher quality and much cheaper than Starbucks.  I just had their Snookie coffee and its amazing!  I asked for them to make it not super sweet and its probably the best coffee drink I have ever had.  Go here!,1
166,2,9/6/2006,15,2,"New York, NY",Jason C.,0,5.0,147,"This place sells terrific coffee by the cup and by the pound.

In addition, there are lots of teas, as well as lots of coffee accessories.  The cups of coffee and espresso drinks are cheap ($1.25 espresso shot!? - suck on that, $tarbucks)    In addition, their staff is very, very friendly, in a slightly quirky way.

Despite having a couple computers, and chairs, this is not a really a sit-down-with-a-newspaper kind of place.  The people who work there are friendly, knowledgable and helpful, but there is no ""atmosphere"" or even much ""seating"" to speak of, not to mention any ""food.""  

Bonus points because they had gaskets for sale for my g/f's cafetera (one of these: xs51.xs.to/pics/05424/ca…) , which we'd been unable to find elsewhere despite weeks of half-hearted searching.",2

I was pleasantly surprised by the 2 dollar price tage and really enjoyed the hazelnut flavor. They definitely put some care into making your cup. They also seemed to sell a great selection of beans and offer a wide variety of espresso drinks. Its more of a to go place and I was in and out quickly.FYI they have a Credit Card minimum of 2.50",

Yes, They had Obama blend but the price,,,,I was not impressed becauseit is a  kind a rundown look,  not very reasonable price, and the service,,,,Overall, I give three stars.I am not going back.  I guess I had a higher expectation.Go there when you need to buy beans in hurry and you area in theatre district.  There are better places you can go to get some beans.I will review later.",

171,,2/19/2012,1,,"Seattle, WA",Richard K.,0,5.0,6,"This place has the best black tea in NYC, hands down. They make it in-house (you can actually see the tea-making machines at the back), and the quality is great. The rose tea is among my favorite black teas; it's fresh, strong, fragrant, without excessive bitterness. Goes perfectly with a little milk.  So, yeah, tea quality A+++.That being said, the place is not much to look at, and definitely is NOT the kind of place that you'd want to go to relax/work on a computer/have a conversation. They have some computers with the internet a la 1990s, and a bench or two, but that's it.",

All your drink choices are laid out clearly on a white board. I chose the Chai and the staff was polite enough to ask what kind of dairy, or lack of, would I like. Its not the BEST chai I've ever had but isn't bad. A perfect harmony of sweet and spice. However, I did feel like it was a little watery, probably because I asked for soy instead of regular milk. The staff is quite friendly and with the Beatles music giving a soundtrack to this place, it has a great atmosphere.",

178,,3/26/2010,2,2,"Portland, OR",Ryan L.,0,2.0,51,"I can't believe this place has such high reviews. My defacto standard to order in a new coffee place is a dirty chai, because it's so hard to fuckup when you have so many flavors cutting the espresso.Let's start out by saying instead of a coffee grinder, they have a bin of ground beans called 'Reg Espresso'. It's not freshly ground, and all the delicious oils from the coffee are going to waste.Secondly the lady must have put at most 3 ounces of pressure while tamping the coffee into the portafilter. I mean seriously, wouldn't want you to break a nail.Thirdly she goes and starts filling my 16oz cup up with more chai concentrate(oregon brand) than milk. I asked her to stop, that's enough. A chai latte should have 1/4 or so chai to milk when made with the concentrate.I asked for 3 shots, got 2.Latte art? Never heard of it, evidently.My drink is in the trash bin right now, it was starbucks quality at best. I have a strong belief you have to be somewhat passionate about coffee to make good coffee. You can usually tell when someone really loves coffee, and the staff clearly didn't.",

I also love the service they provide. There is always a friendly employee willing to help me right away, and they give great advice on the flavors if you're undecided, which can easily happen with all the choices available. The barrista is also really cool! Super friendly, and fashionable. The only reason why I don't give this place 5 stars is because I wish they had a nicer area to sit down in with a few couches and comfy chairs, but I mainly go there to get beans and in the winter their incredible Mexican hot chocolate.",

You will be lucky to get a thank you from them. I moved recently to the neighborhood and buy 3-4 pounds every two week and have yet to receive a thank you. When I pay with a credit card, the guy tosses the receipt for me to sign with such indifference it is upside down or reversed, so I must reposition it to sign it.  I was there actually today and decided after such poor customer service to never go there again. You would think that providing excellent  customer service would be uppermost in the mind of any business. Can't they hire people who  aren't embittered and don't hate their job?",
