0,Kellie E.,"Cambria Heights, NY",0,18,6,5.0,8/11/2018,"This place was such a pleasant surprise! We walked in thinking it was a regular restaurant, but were surprised to see staff on skates, dancing, and just overall performance! Food- the sushi we ordered was AMAZING. Like seriously.. not only was it delicious, but the presentation was pretty too. No complaints whatsoever. The drinks were yummy and strong. 5/5 stars.Service- the staff was incredibly attentive. Our waiter made sure we were satisfied with our meals and also having a good time.Ambiance- I was taken here on a date, but I wouldn't recommend it . It got incredibly loud here so you probably wouldn't be able to hear what your date is saying. The DJ was awesome. Mixing was seamless and you actually want to get up and dance. There are TVs everywhere so you're able to see music videos. Everyone in attendance was dressed very nicely as well. Overall, I'm extremely sad this place has closed. It seemed like an awesome place to go- especially for your birthday",,,
1,Barin A.,"Montgomery, MD",89,18,16,5.0,7/4/2018,This is one of my favorite sushi restaurant. I came here with a friend on Tuesday night and they had live music which was actually surprisingly good. The waiter was very attentive. For the drink order we shared the goblet  Kung Fu Hustle. The cocktail was refreshing and amazing. For starters I ordered tuna flatbread and tuna tacos. There are no words how amazing those were. If you're a fan of tuna I would highly recommend it. For sushi rolls we ended up getting spice girls which in my opinion was not as spicy as I thought it would have been but still good. We also ordered the Apollo creed as well without the eel sauce. I would definitely be coming back in the near future.,,,
2,Daria D.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,144,889,1.0,6/10/2018,"Yelp, why is 0 stars not an option?!My fiancé and I came here last night to celebrate my friend's birthday. Being that there were 14 of us she was told she has to get a prefix package. The price of that was $60/person plus a 2 drink minimum/person. To sum up the experience, I am absolutely APPALLED at the price they charge for the quantity and quality of the food they serve. Now read on. In terms of the drinks, numerous waiters tried to encourage us to get the large punchbowl drinks for $100 and said that is enough for 8 people to have one drink. But come on, anyone who has been out pretty much anywhere where those sort of drinks are served knows that it's mainly sugar and barely any alcohol. We all opted out of that and chose to order individual drinks. One couple ordered a bottle of wine.I was content with my drinks (the only thing about the night I was content about). I ordered the Purple Rain and the Black Panther. My fiancé ordered the Green Lantern, which he was not pleased with and said it tasted too sweet and watered down. For his next drink he ordered whiskey on the rocks and asked for Woodford Reserve.It was not at all what he got. He said the whiskey he got tasted disgusting and that they probably served the cheapest one they had.Now about the food ... For apps we got 3-4 plates of edamame, some disgusting super spicey inedible peppers, and chicken satay. Then we got some sushi rolls (if that's what you call sushi). Last we got muffins and mochi. The food is served family style for everyone to share. There was nowhere near enough food for 14 people to equally share. After everyone took one of each chicken satay we kind of awkwardly sat looking at the last one on the plate until one brave person asked, ""Do you want the last one?"" ""No"", everyone chimed in. Another group of people at the other end of the table split the last chicken satay on their plate in half, each taking a bite. At one point the miniscule amount of food served even became a laughing joke.We all picked at the muffin and divided the mochi pieces in halves. This meal cost me and my fiancé about $300 for the two of us. If you want high end sushi ask me for recommendations where you can put $300 to much better use. If you are planning a night out for drinks and music I am certain you can also find a much higher quality place. Their ""entertainment"" consists of the waiters dancing to music videos playing on the screens on the walls. They then charge an ""entertainment"" fee for that.After ending our meals with half a mochi piece and a few bites of a muffin my fiancé and I asked the waiter if he can bring out the check so we can pay our part. He said no, that it is only one check and we must wait until the full party is ready to leave. So we stayed and listened to the loud rowdy music as if you were in an old style teen club. By the time the bill did come I did not look closely at it and trusted one of our group members to split the total among us all. After reading some reviews here (to try to understand the 5 star ratings) I came across someone's review that states they charge a service charge fee, credit card fee, and then tip. Don't quote me on this as I did not see for myself, but make sure to carefully inspect your bill.",11,1,1
3,Sam M.,"South Amboy, NJ",12,288,1214,4.0,5/20/2018,"A great time and a great meal but not quite sure it's worth the insane price tag. We thought it was a fun place to bring the kids for a family bday celebration and never really expected the food to be so good thank goodness it was, but the.sticker shock will keep us from coming back.We had a party of eight, with three of them kids. Six apps and six mains (three mains were just a single sushi roll, two chicken teriyaki which consisted of a single sliced breast on broccoli rabe and one salmon), one salad, one large shared ice cream dessert for the table ($60). Now this is where they get you, you have a two drink minimum for each adult and a one drink minimum per kid..ok but each drink is like $16+ each app is about $15 and main $30+so the bill was about $750 and we were all hungry an hour later!!The singing and dancing was cute, and food pretty tasty so I give four stars for that but sadly not really worth the price in MHO.",2,,2
4,Jessica B.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",223,223,555,3.0,6/3/2018,Came in having no idea it was mostly performance. The service was very attentive and most of the performing was good. Our waitress was the best one and so full of energy.  The food was delicious - the sushi pizza was my favorite. They also give you truffle popcorn which was so good! Some of the singing could have been better honestly. It was more of a been there done that place for me - won't likely ever come back but fun for what it is. We came on a Wednesday and would imagine it would be more fun on a weekend with more people.,,,
5,Shannon B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,5,5.0,9/25/2018,Amazing ambiance and the food was delicious. I also loved the entertainment experience (there was singing and dancing) it makes going to this restaurant that much more fun for birthday parties or celebratory occasions!,,,

We all had so much fun and his place is truly like no other. The performances were phenomenal and we all didn't expect to enjoy ourselves the way we did. Definitely go here for a birthday celebration or a special night out with friends--you won't regret it. When you first walk in, you automatically feel like you're experiencing Tokyo nightlife. It is a bit on the pricier end but for the experience it's well worth it. The waiters were all super friendly and sweet, do give this place a try!",3,,

11,Ally S.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,4.0,4/24/2018,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this place. A date actually brought me here (super random) and it was actually great because there's so much going on to talk about and observe, definitely brings more energy to dinner for sure. Originally, when he told me where we were going I looked it up and was sure it would be super tacky...The servers are also dancers, and when there is a ""show"" going on they dance around the restaurant, and actually engage customers as well, especially those clearly there for a birthday or a bachelorette or something. The food was actually really good too! You definitely have to be in the mood for a place like this, it's super loud and can get rowdy. But overall, fun and pleasant experience.",1,,
12,Imani H.,"New York, NY",360,125,172,4.0,9/2/2017,Such a fun place to go with friends! The atmosphere is so fun and lively! There's disco balls and loud music which pumps up your average dinner experience! Be warned tho if you're looking for a nice calm place for sushi then this is NOT your place! All the servers sing and dance which was super fun and the sushi isn't bad either! Seems like a great place to go for birthdays or other big celebrations! I would definitely call ahead and make a reservation too!,3,,
13,Jolene P.,"New Milford, NJ",79,195,425,2.0,3/5/2018,"I had very high expectations with this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or caught them on an off night but if you can imagine what tasteless sushi tastes like, thats probably the best thing I can say about it. I ordered a roll (MR. Pink I believe) which had shrimp, avocado, kani, apple and mango. I would have supposed it would be flavorful between sweet and savory but no, it was like a glass of water, and not the kind you look forward to on a hot summer day, more of the kind you drink in the stead of a refreshing cocktail. Any who, although the service was ok, it would have been better had they been properly staffed. They literally had one person serving as host, bar tender, waiter, and food runner.",2,,2
14,Brian F.,"Long Beach, NY",43,9,0,5.0,4/7/2018,"Tonight April 7, 2018 we had my wife's 30th bday party here. Prior to the party, Jason , the owner and i corresponded.  He was extremely professional and couldn't have been anymore helpful in setting up the party for me. When we got to the facility the staff was extremely friendly and courteous. The food was wonderful and the talent was great. The price was reasonable for a nice nyc night. Anyone saying that the service is slow take a step back and realize that not only do the servers serve your food but they also perform a show while you eat so I implore you to be a little more patient than normal. Thank you Jason apfelbaum and staff for making my wife's bday great.",,,2
15,Dean M.,"Nashville, TN",11,112,6,1.0,4/4/2018,"Staying at the hotel. Decided to go for a walk and my wife wanted me to get us a couple of shots of vodka before we headed out. She poked her head into the restaurant while I waited. And waited. And waited to get served.She came back out to tell me that the restaurant was more like a night club.Finally the (bored and unfriendly) bartender (who looked about 17) took my order. I gave him a $50 and he gave me back $16. Said the ""tip was included.""$34 for two (tiny) shots????How much was the tip???I had planned on trying the sushi but at this point, I am done with that place.",,1,

They give you truffle popcorn to start, which I thought was bland, but it's a nice gesture. My friend and I shared:+uma thurman roll+avocado tempura+white dragon roll+atlantic salmon+valrhona chocolate brownie +molten sticky toffee cupcake+double dragon cocktail+hadouken cocktailThe rolls were great, and the tempura was awesome. Salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked. Out of the desserts, the toffee one blew everything out of the water. The chocolate was great but nothing special.  Loved the drinks, too!",3,,

Great Birthday Spot. Owner is a Gentlemen, overseas his staff like a director in a Broadway show. My crew loved the Alohomora.I highly recommend this place,fun place to go with friends.",1,,
18,Andrey L.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",2,3,0,1.0,6/10/2018,"I came here yesterday for a birthday party, and this place is the biggest rip off in terms of what you are getting. We had a group of 14 people and we were forced to get a prix fix selection which was $60 pp for just food plus an additional 2 drink minimum.This review will only consist of money value for food for 14 people .For $60 a person, they put out:3 plates of appetizers, 3 plates of sushi (5 rolls each plate) , 3 cupcakes and 9 mochi. I looked at their menu online and calculated what they put out......the total amount of food we got came out to $384, meanwhile at $60 a person, there should have been $840 worth of food on the table. Since they make it VERY clear the $60 is strictly for food, they should serve $840 worth of food.Everyone left hungry and unsatisfied. We were told there would be enough food. If we weren't forced into the the pre fix dinner menu, this review would be completely different. I understand this is a business but if you are going to be a restaurant establishment and not a club as you try to be, you need to put out enough food for what people pay for.Also, we were forced to pay an entertainment fee, so they cant even hide behind the fact that the pre fix menu is high because of the entertainment aspect which was pretty bad but the group made the best of it.",1,,
19,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",948,752,3025,5.0,9/18/2016,"Sushi Roxx...well, it rocks.From the outside you'd never guess what an awesome spot this place is. When you walk in, you're in an empty, hotel-bar type of area, until you walk through the curtain that transports you to a fusion of club, restaurant, acid trip, and a touch of Vegas.I'll warn you, it's expensive but worth every penny. The food isn't amazing but it's certainly good. You come for the entertainment. The music is awesome, the wait staff dances, the singers are incredibly talented, and there was even a rapper. The drinks, the shots, the energy...it all roxx. Bachelorettes, birthday girls, sweet sixteeners, and those awkward 50-somethings who party harder than 20-somethings, Sushi Roxx caters to all.",4,2,3

23,Laura S.,"Historic Downtown, Jersey City, NJ",176,5,0,4.0,7/8/2018,"We came to Sushi Roxx on a Friday night. We were able to get a reservation for 8pm on short notice and arrived promptly at 8. The staff were immediately very welcoming and attentive, so we didn't mind having to wait a few minutes on the comfortable couches they have in the front. We were seated within 10 minutes. The dining room is covered in screens and has the vibe of a very fun dance club. The restaurant itself is themed in Tokyo nightlife, so it definitely incorporates that without feeling overwhelming to an audience of newbies. It was a lovely and welcoming atmosphere. We were attended to very promptly and our waitress Parker was amazing. We got started with cocktails: Black Panther for him and Kung Fu Hustle with gin instead of vodka for me. Both were delicious. When they came out, I will admit that I was skeptical that they'd be all ice and no drink, but they were strong and delicious. We later got a second round of two Black Panthers and they were just as delicious as the first drinks.For food, we started with the spicy tuna on crispy rice and the rock shrimp tempura. Both were very good. The spicy tuna and crispy rice was especially memorable because it was such an interesting and texturally pleasant take on a sushi classic. For mains, we shared three rolls: the Roxxie, Van Halen, and Surf+Turf. We loved all three; the Van Halen had an unexpected smokiness that added a lot of interest to the flavor. My favorite was the Roxxie. I would come back just to get it again; I loved the heat and the tempura was really excellently done. Half of the experience at Sushi Roxx is the ""performance"". The wait staff doubles as very entertaining and talented singers and dancers that occasionally break into choreographed numbers to top 40 hits (past and present). The performances were fun and engaging without being intrusive. We were afraid of being singled out for participation, but it really wasn't an intimidating or stressful experience. We had a shot sent out for us (passionfruit and vodka) that they made a show out of bringing out, but it was fun. Even if you're wary of live entertainment, this place is a ton of fun. Overall, we loved coming. The two drink minimum was easy to manage and the entertainment fee ($15 per person) is honestly worthwhile. It was pricy ($240 for two), but it's worth the occasional treat. It's also an awesome place for gatherings like birthdays (they really make you feel special, send out some drinks, etc). We would definitely be back and would recommend it to friends visiting NYC looking for a unique experience. Only not 5 stars because it is a bit expensive.",,,
24,Jennifer N.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,74,266,4.0,11/18/2017,"This place is amazing. If you want great food, drink, and entertainment this is the place to go!!!

We wanted to spice it up a bit so we decided that wherever we went, we would wear cute colorful wigs lol. I mentioned it to a coworker and she suggested this place. I immediately agreed to try Sushi Roxx  based on the ambiance and reviews. So I'll break a few things down for my review:Management:I was told that it's best to make a reservation if going with a group of ppl. I checked Open Table and they only had a 6:15 spot. I booked but knew it was too early for me and my girls so I called them directly. A man by the name of Jason (I pray that's his name lol) was so kind to find a 10:15 spot for us which I am so appreciative of. THANK YOU!Atmosphere and Service:We arrived maybe 5 minutes late and there's lots of ppl in the lobby, there's a bar there. I believe it is also inside of a hotel. We waited no more than 10 minutes and were seated. Our waiter was super attentive and could sing his ass off! Even with him having to perform, he was never too far away. The dancers were also amazing and interacted with the crowd. We danced with the staff members and other guests as well. Everyone was so friendly and complimented us on our colorful wigs. Food & Drinks:The drinks are AMAZING! We were worried about the glass size at first but it was just right and packed with lots of alcohol. Loved the Alohomora! For starters we ordered the Miso Horny Sushi Rolls which were very good. Three of us ordered the chicken teriyaki for main dishes and we weren't pleased. It tasted more like thinly sliced turkey. My other friend had the salmon and she finished everything!Overall we had a blast and would return again. Thank you so much for a fun and different experience.",1,,

They let us try some cold Sake and we ordered a delicious bottle. The atmosphere was great and lively!

They charge for absolutely everything they can and I mean everything.  Over charged $300 for 2 punch bowl that was minimum charge I was told. I was told think of it as a cover charge??  Well tell me there is a cover charge upfront.  Not when the bill comes.   Please remember $300  for 2 punch bowl with obvious no alcohol?????  Hello???  I stopped them from serving fake shots to 16 year old girls???  Really???  Totally prepping them for bad behavior and believe me I am not a prude.  I guess when I saw mac & cheese rounds at a Japanese Restaurant I should have had a clue.  Again most of the kids liked it but you will feel like a fool and wonder if they could have gotten alcohol if they had money and showed interest.I wish I went to Tao and rented the Sky Box.  A much better idea and the same price and God knows the food would have been better.",5,,

I ordered the spicy salmon roll and some pieces of tuna sashimi.  For some reason this took almost 30 minutes.  The hostess was really nice and brought over some complimentary snacks while I was waiting.  The food was pretty good - the roll was not the best, but it was fresh and had a bit of kick to it, and the sashimi was ok - I wish it was colder - but I was disappointed with the wait time - the front of the restaurant was empty so not sure why it would take that long - especially such a small order.  The hostess kept apologizing.Next time I'm definitely going to make a RSVP for the show - this seems to be that cool thing to do for your birthday - fun, cheesy and all around good laughs.Yup, this place definitely roxx......(yeah yeah.,,you knew that was coming)",,,

If you are looking for a new restaurant experience especially for a celebration of some sort, this is the place to be!! When you walk in you go through a hotel lounge that's subtle and subdued. Then you open up the curtains and are instantly transformed into a party rock environment. They have the great videos playing and most of all the best music! Depending on your seating time every 15 min a new live performance comes out singing classic top 40 songs!! THe entire time our group had non stop laughs and singing along with everyone. The sushi itself is also good. Fresh and lots of creative rolls you can order.  The only reason for not having 5 stars is because at ten they basically rush you out for the last seating.

34,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,4.0,2/18/2016,"Came here for my roommate's birthday with a party of 8 on a Friday night. We called ahead a week in advanced for reservations.  They require you to order off their pre-fix menu if you have a group over 8 people. This is not a traditional sushi restaurant - Sushi Roxx is more of a lounge that serves food with live dance and singing performances. The hostess led us behind the curtain to our table and automatically it felt like we were transported to a club.  The interior is uniquely decorated and the whole vibe was amazing with top 40 music blasting while you eat, flashing lights, music videos playing on the screens, and dancers performing routines every 15 minutes. The ambiance is great - you feel like you are in a music video while having dinner. Music was a mix of hip hop/top 40, 90's throwback (Destiny's Child, Thong Song, etc). Food is what you expect for a higher end sushi restaurant - overpriced but decent. Most of us just ordered one sushi roll (~$16-$22 each) and several rounds of drinks. The Godzilla Roll ($16) and Surf & Turf ($22) were good. For your birthday, they do a birthday song in front of the whole restaurant with dancers walking in delivering you a dessert. The TV screens also give you a birthday shout out with your name. Sushi Roxx is perfect for a fun night out, music and entertainment. Highly recommend for birthday parties or to celebrate a special occasion.",5,3,3

36,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,12/19/2016,"I'm really not sure how to review Sushi Roxx. The double x's should've been enough of a tell, but I went in having absolutely zero expectations for the night. I was invited to my boyfriend's best friend's father's 60th birthday party, which was already unconventional, and the night only got more strange from there. We came, we drank, we waited an absurd amount of time overall due to poor service and we had a dining experience that can only really be described as unique. Peculiar is close second. Confusing is a third. In any case, Sushi Roxx is not in the least bit my kind of venue. I truly did/do not know how to rate it given that. The food was surprisingly good given the venue (I also wasn't paying so who am I to really complain?) but otherwise I was totally overstimulated the entire time. I will say, props to my boyfriend's best friend's 60 year-old father for having the time of his life. Goals. We had an 8:30 reservation here but weren't let in to the main venue until around 9. I found this odd at first, but once we were seated I realized that every party needed to be seated  at a certain time such that the ""entertainment"" part of the evening could run as smoothly as possible. While you wait, you have the option to hang in the hotel lobby or by the bar, before being led into the mysterious venue by a woman who will most likely be in a sequined, cleavage-heavy jumpsuit. Before I get into that, let's cover drinks.Like any eatery that also happens to be a ""performance space"", Sushi Roxx has a nice alcohol menu to get its guests sloppy. The cocktails, like everything else at Sushi Roxx, are too extravagant for their own good. They all require at least 7 different ingredients and take quite a long time to make. Even longer when you've been seated in the venue and your server needs to go back and forth to the bar. That said, every drink I ordered was actually great. The main issue with the cocktails here, other than the wait time, is the price. $15 is pretty standard for a high quality cocktail in NYC. *However*, cocktails here are between 3-4 sips each, which is a complete rip-off. I wasn't even paying on this particular night and I'm saying that, so you know it's really a problem. In any case, I tried the Double Dragon (Bombay Sapphire, Green Tea, Lemongrass, Fuji Apple, Amaro Nonino, Lemon, Apple Bitters), Black Mamba (Jameson Black Barrel, Smoked Apple Wood, Rosemary, Angostura Bitters) and the Stone Cold Stunner (Grey Goose, Chipotle, Pomegranate, Passionate Fruit, Lime) as well as one of the punch bowls that the guest of honor ordered for the table. 4 drinks only had me a little bit tipsy given the amount of liquid in each glass. But like I said, still tasty.I've been making use of quotation marks because calling the Sushi Roxx experience ""entertainment"" or a ""performance"" feels like I'm giving it too much credit. The space itself is dark and colorful, there are odd comics drawn onto the walls and a number of flat screens playing music videos. It kind of felt like that Mugatu brainwashing scene in Zoolander, except that I was totally aware of how absurd everything was. Soon after you're seated, the show begins. Mediocre to amateur singing and dancing. It was very confusing and very overstimulating. Also a bit depressing, because I have bigger dreams for those performers than what I watched on Friday night. I think they'd say the same for themselves. For food, we started with good ole' movie popcorn (like, with ""butter flavoring"" and everything) and then moved onto some more typical Japanese apps. We had a pre fixe menu, so we were essentially 100% at the mercy of Sushi Roxx. Which sounds a bit frightening. Despite the subtle rumblings of dread, the food was decent. Wild Ginger Edamame was super yummy, as were the shishito peppers. Avocado tempura was meh. Sushi-wise (if the sushi does in fact roxxxxxxx), I believe we received California rolls and shrimp tempura, but everything here goes by a name that can only be described as.....unique. That one sounds familiar. In any case, the sushi was pretty decent. We got three identical plates which were spaced equally along our long, 15-person table. Though I can't speak to how much or little this whole ordeal costed, I'll say it was a pretty adequate amount of food with a nice variety of items. That said, it's not traditional. You come here for the experience, not for the authenticity. As I mentioned, the service here was abominable. So much so, in fact, that I saw the manager chewing out a few of the servers at one point. My boyfriend's best friend's sister's boyfriend (had to, sorry) didn't receive his first beer for almost an hour. You read that right--not a cocktail, a bottle of beer. He was pissed but still a good sport. I wouldn't have been as kind.My not-so-secret hope is that this entire night was total satire. Unfortunately, my guess is that this is wishful thinking. But seeing the good reviews, I guess I'm just not the right clientele.",12,4,5

Soooo entertaining!The place is lined with TV's as well and awesome, funky decor.  It is VERY loud though so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date lolThe food was good but a little overpriced in my opinion (perhaps to compensate the performers?).My only complaint was that when it came time to pay, something was wrong with their server (or something) and it took over 30 minutes to process our credit cards.  They should have offered us a complimentary something while we waited.  Would have been less painful! Though we did get to see more performances lolI def look forward to going back here.I feel like this is a hidden gem!",3,,

Coulda been Brooklyn, mabes, but I don't have cable, so I don't know those shows.....walked in with their film crew entourage.

Their drinks were nice and strong (they better be for the price). We ordered a shot for the birthday girl and the dancers sang around her with the shots song blasting. Overall, this place was fun!

43,Bridget C.,"Pasadena, CA",16,15,0,1.0,5/22/2018,"Like most of my exes, I fell in and out of love with this place pretty quickly. The bill keeps getting higher every time I go, yet the service level goes down. The last two times, the service was so poor i vowed to never return.  Who doesn't go back to an ex at least once right? Then as soon as you go back you remember why you left them. The waitress blatantly waited on select tables (I'm guessing she cherry picked based upon her perception of who would tip more) and either ignored us all together or stopped by to grab empty glasses and run away. The manager comped us a couple drinks to make up for it but by then we were already so hammered because we couldn't get the waitress to bring us any food- we didn't even finish the ""free"" drinks. No one goes here for the food because it's barely average sushi. The new format for entertainment at 6pm sucks, and the new show was lackluster as hell. I brought my daughter after having bragged about how cool this place was. Needless to say, I spent the rest of the night explaining how cool this place used to be (kinda like me in the 90's).

45,Jillian K.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,0,5.0,7/1/2018,"This place is AMAZING. I have no idea how there could possibly be a single negative review about this place. My only guess is that some people just don't like to have fun? I came here on a Friday night with a friend for dinner. From the second we arrived, the maitre d greeted us and was so kind and fun. We sat down and were immediately greeted and thanked for coming. They brought us this incredible truffle popcorn on the house right away. Our server was so friendly and chatted with us frequently through out the night.  The busser came by every single time there was a dirty plate to tidy up the table and refill our water.  The food was delicious, and in my opinion, decently priced for sushi in Manhattan. We had 2 drinks each, a bottle of sake, 2 appetizers and 2 rolls - a lot of food and drinks, and it was around $150. They even gave us a free desert!  The best part (aside from the amazing service) was the awesome entertainment. The singers and dancers were sooooo good! They definitely have professional singing and dancing training. The decor was fun, great music, excellent service and delicious food. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars! We will definitely be back!!",,,

It is an INCREDIBLE atmosphere and the food is pretty good too. We had about 4 performances throughout our dinner and they were fantastic. Suggestion: go for a birthday or bachelorette party (you'll see why) and go late (around 10:30) because it is an awesome pregame before a night out! Also, the party bowl is worth it for 4 or more (there were 4 of us and we got about 10 drinks out of it)!",,,
47,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,8/4/2015,"I know what you're thinking- four stars for a gimmicky tourist trap, really Luci? But I assure you that my high opinion of this place is well earned, and that you'll have a blast here too as long as you don't take yourself too seriously. When I walked up to the door I was greeted by the doorman, who just happens to be a little person. This sort of sets the tone a bit; he's a super friendly guy and he chatted with my dining companion about the best facial hair products. Grow it out!The staff is made up mainly of pretty women in hot outfits covered in sequins. They're are some of the sweetest, most friendly staff members I've ever met anywhere, and they all have a great sense of humor. You're here to have fun, after all. These women take your orders and bring you your food, but they also sing and dance while you eat your sushi. They have great energy! The dancing isn't overtly sexual and the outfits aren't overly revealing. I was disappointed to see some families making their young daughters cover their eyes. Aside from the fact that nothing these women were performing in was particularly risque, it's not really teaching these kids such great things about societies perception of the female form but FAR BE IT FROM ME to lecture tourists from middle America. The decor is trippy. Giant photos of sumo wrestlers on the ceiling, a wall of a 100 lucky waving cats, morphing fractals projected into pillars. I pretty much wanted to live there. And the bathrooms pump out classic disco, have mirrored walls, and a traditional disco ball. Every time I went in there I was dancing. The cocktail list is great, I had the Double Dragon. Green tea infused gin with lemongrass and apple, refreshing and delicious with a little bit of a kick. The food is....well you're not here for the food. We had the spicy tuna crispy rice with pickled jalapeno. Couldn't taste any heat from the pepper, and the whole thing was a dead ringer for Rice Crispy treats. It was hilarious. We also ordered the Godzilla roll and the salmon tomato roxx boxx. Everything had the same ""crunch"" stuff on it that tasted like the aforementioned crispy treats. This is definitely sushi for people who have never had it before and may be intimidated by the real thing. I think this place is perfect for a fun, silly date, or any occasion where you're looking for tons of atmosphere.",4,,

You'd have a good ratio here.The wait staff are all talented dancers and singers that entertain throughout the night. You know they trying to be discovered and while I have no use, I have discovered they are very nice talented people. Cocktails were all very good. I recommend the pork buns but not the tuna tacos as they were quite bland. That is all.",,,

51,Maxwell H.,"Manhattan, NY",106,66,57,2.0,11/5/2017,"This place is absurd, and yet utterly confident in what it is trying to be. We were celebrating the birthday of a young teenager, and for them it was perfect. This place is loud, with flashing lights and screens - imagine a nightclub where you're also trying to have dinner. Sometimes the servers dance or sing, and it's as cheesy as it sounds. Because the servers are more interested in their performing, and because the music is pounding - which is fine, I get it, they're going for a vibe - it just means the service isn't going to be very good. And they charge you for everything. And they really, really, really want you to buy shots. Really.The food? It's fine. Better than pre-packaged grocery store sushi. The chicken satay was slathered in way too much sauce, as was the edamame which was very strange. The crispy rice was a reasonable approximation of the dish which is much better elsewhere. The fish seemed relatively fresh and the rolls are well made. But you're not coming here for the food. You're coming for the ""atmosphere"" and the music. And the shots, which they really want you to buy.",,1,

They do have a menu that catered to the non sushi eating people like myslef whichbhelps, but the entertainment factor alone was great.

55,Christine A.,"Hoboken, NJ",85,255,116,4.0,5/24/2016,"This little punchy restaurant is located in a hotel in Murray Hill.  Upon entering, there is a classy hotel bar where you can get bottled beers for $8; glass of La Marca Prosecco for $12; cocktails for $15; punch bowls for $100.   Continue on and there is a little seating area where the hostess stand is.  Hostess is decked in an awesome outfit and you just expect a good night.  As other yelpers have mentioned, it's 21+ only after 8:30pm, so be prepared to see a barrage of little 12 year olds if you enter this establishment before aforementioned time.  It will be weird and a little uncomfortable, but go with it. At first we were seated at the sushi bar - and thankfully we were moved to a table. Definitely ask for a table! The sushi bar is comfortable, but you'll have to contort your body in weird ways to be able to watch the performances.  So the food - not noteworthy of any Michelin stars, but not bad by any means.  * truffle popcorn (free) - yay! This popcorn is a fun surprise.  They give to all tables and yes, you can ask for more when you're empty. *avocado tempura - meh.  Not that crispy; pass.* Spicy Miso Soup - really tasty and the spice they added really helps kick this up another notch* Shishito peppers - pretty good; really large portion too - great to share with 3-4 people* For the sushi, the waitress recommended 2 rolls each.  Each of the rolls have 8 pieces, so order as much as you think you'll need. I was able to try Roxxy, Malibu, Spicy Girl, Surf & Turf - and that was the order of my preference as well.  Surf & Turf sounds great, but isn't worth it. stick with the other options.The friends I dined with that had been here before said there were fewer performances this time around.  For our 2ish hour dinner - there was 1 waitress dance number, 3 solo songs, 1 bride + groom dance, and several (4?) happy birthday/shot songs.  Maybe they would have been able to sing/perform more if there were less birthdays.   On the down-time, they were placing an eclectic mix of music (Michael Jackson, Dolly Parton, Mace, Aaliyah, Boy Bands, etc) and for the most part, the music videos were playing too!Overall - I was satisfied with my meal here.  It's definitely not a place I'll run to next weekend, but would definitely suggest it for a celebration or when visitors are in town.",3,,

Went for my birthday this year with a group of 30; my parents and in-laws were in attendance.  Started planning my event with the owner about a month before the date; he received countless emails from me with questions, changes, additions, subtractions..etc.  Each time he was really personable and attentive.I get to the venue and the staff treated me as if they were waiting all day for me, as if I were the Queen.  (Spoiler alert, I'm not a Queen or even  a Princess haha).  We went for the 10PM seating which got started late.  This was the only part that sucked; since we had such a large group we needed to wait for multiple parties to pay their bill and leave the tables before we could sit.  This was not the fault of management or staff at the venue, it was just life.  So, if you are a large party and you are going for the later seating bring your patience and understanding...they are really doing all they can to help you. The management was so apologetic and so nice about it all.  We sat down...shots came to the table, we ordered some drinks and champagne....had the sushi, danced and just had a FUNNNNNNNN time.  It was kitchy, fun, funny, silly, happy....you name it.  The sushi was FABULOUS....so hungry for it now.  I had a great time and want to say thank you to everyone there.  Such amazing people who made my silly birthday a great time.  Thank you.",2,,1

I was more impressed by the constant shows that they were bringing out periodically. Some of the shows that I could remember were: a waitress singing Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball with almost same pitch and tone as the original Miley Cyrus except she wasn't singing on top of a wrecking ball, and some high energy group dancing (see my videos!).It kinda felt like dinning inside a club with lots of loud music. But the good thing is that they played really good songs and they knew how to shuffle songs. Kudos to the DJ! Also, there is a big screen tv on the wall showing some really good trailers.

When you walk in you think you are walking into this stuffy ritzy sushi bar but then they take you behind the curtain and the true magic begins. First and foremost is the room itself, loud music, screens all over the place and a great vibe. The DJ was probably the best I've ever heard. Not only was he mixing music but he was also mixing videos. I had never seen anything like it! The food was great. The menu is smaller but had plenty of choices for even the most picky eater. The drinks were reasonable for NYC and a generous pour. They had dancers and singers who must be Juilliard students with how incredible they were. We walked in thinking we would have a quick dinner and go but ended up closing the place down. All I have to say is I can't wait to go back.",,,
73,Krysten W.,"New York, NY",190,1,0,4.0,4/14/2018,"This place is honestly very bizarre, but SO FUN. If you're not a group/party, I would probably steer clear. I came with a birthday party of 12 people, and while we left with an $1100 bill, it was well worth it. We danced the night away and were treated like royalty. Our server, Katie, was INCREDIBLE. She was so nice, and she danced with our party the whole night until 2am. 5 stars for Katie!",,,
74,Dan D.,"Warwick, NY",0,16,4,5.0,9/9/2017,"Sushi Roxx is an outstanding establishment.  It is a unique bar for NYC where all the waiters/waitresses perform singing and dancing routines throughout the night.  The sushi was amazing... the best I've ever had, and I have eaten sushi all over.  The service was impeccable and the environment was top notch.  I would highly recommend going here to anyone looking for a fun time, great food and great drinks.  I can't wait to go back.  Thank you Sushi Roxx!!!",,,
75,David R.,"Winnetka, IL",0,1,0,1.0,4/4/2018,This place is a joke.  Took about 45 minutes for mediocre sushi and the they had the nerve to include a 20% tip on the bill for a $70 dinner at the bar!  Bartender was semi-rude and not doing his job.  Avoid this place!,,,
76,Heather W.,"Arlington, TX",4,8,46,5.0,10/26/2015,"Go here! The food is delicious, the drinks are creative and the wait staff is phenomenal! Such a unique and fun place. You can tell they love what they do. Our waiter even walked out to say goodbye when we missed him as we were leaving. We picked Sushi Roxx for our first night in the city on a girls trip. It was a blast and we will definitely come back. I was surprised that it wasn't busier and maybe because it was a Thursday night at 9? The appetizers we chose were tuna pizza and avocado tempura and both were melt in your mouth! They brought us Truffle popcorn as well and it was so good. Salmon and Lox and the Big Mac were our favorite rolls. I don't think anything you order here is going to be bad quite honestly and we are sushi snobs! The Cobra Kai was hands down my favorite drink and you must order the molten toffee cake! Amazing!!!! Thanks for entertaining us!",2,1,2
77,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5152,4.0,9/4/2015,"If you're the kind of person that can hang your ego at the door and embrace a wacky sushi concept, then you'll enjoy Sushi Roxx.Someone in management described the restaurant to me as ""seeing Minnie Mouse take her head off at Disneyland and start smoking a blunt,"" and that's not a terribly inaccurate elevator pitch. The walls are covered in psychedelic versions of traditional Asian art, there are exactly 1,000 maneki-neko cats waiving terribly out of sync behind the sushi bar, a disco ball tosses bright twinkling lights throughout the men's restroom, and breaks from normal dinner service happen every 15 minutes to observe employees singing Katy Perry songs. It's dinner theater for people who love Z100 and it's the sort of place I could imagine becoming the official jumping off spot for Manhattan bachelorette parties. On the food side of things, there certainly won't be a sequel to Jiro Dreams of Sushi featuring Sushi Roxx, but the offerings are familiar enough to ensure most people in your party will understand what they're ordering. That said, something that's a bit unique is their tempura fried avocado appetizer. It's very reminiscent of the same starter featured at Tender in the Sanctuary Hotel. Jason Apfelbaum is the man behind both and it's arguably one of my favorite avocado dishes in the city. Make sure you don't pass it up.If you're too cool to surrender to a cheeky night out, then stick to 15 East or Sushi Ko. But if you can find that child within and you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll have a great time.",26,10,10

80,Ellen S.,"Stamford, CT",0,5,0,5.0,2/22/2018,"I had my birthday party at Sushi Roxx at the end of January. We did the unlimited beer/wine option and prefix menu. We had a group of 13 people. Our waitress was AMAZING! She was super accommodating to all of our requests and we definitely didn't go thirsty. I am allergic to shellfish so they gave me my own separate sushi from the table without extra charge. One of my friends does not eat sushi at all so they allowed her to do the chicken teriyaki option for $10. We had so much! I definitely wouldn't recommend for a meal where you are trying to have a quiet conversation but for any celebration I highly recommend. The music was fun, the performers were great singers/dancers, and the food was good too! I'm hoping one of friends decides to do this for their birthday so I can do go again :)",,,

82,Anna K.,"Steinway, Queens, NY",127,75,906,5.0,7/27/2015,"WOW! This place blew my expectations out of the water! I cannot say enough good things about my experience here. It is hard to to impress the typical jaded New Yorker, but this place manages to do just that! We made reservations for the earlier seating on Friday at 6:30pm. They had only been open officially for 3 days so we were lucky enough to get in with no problems. However I think word is spreading quickly and you should definitely go before its too hard to get a table!We were greeted by Sariah who was beyond friendly! She was the hostess and also one of the performers. She has an amazing voice and had enamored quite a few people by the end of her performance. As soon as we were led behind the curtain to our table I felt like I had been transported to an underground nightclub in Tokyo. Behind the sushi bar there was a wall of about 100 waving kitties that are for good luck and wealth. The walls are covered in Japanese animation, a 3D wall that seems to flow like water and an awesome dinosaur, a GIANT robot and dont forget to look up to catch the sumo wrestlers looking down on the room.As soon as we were seated our waitress Samantha came and greeted us. She was so warm and friendly! It came from the heart and her energy was genuine. She has been dancing since she was 2 years old and hasn't ever been a waitress before training to be one here. She absolutely NAILED it. She was efficient, friendly and very attentive. Her dance performance with her partner was probably one of my favorites of the night! You could feel the heat between the two of them!The food was amazing! I liked everything we had and we tried quite a few things on the menu. My favorite was the Wild Ginger Edamame and I dont usually even like ginger!Appetizers - Avocado Tempura and the Tuna Flatbread PizzaRolls- Roxxy and Spice Girl - both were good, but if I had to pick I would choose the Roxxy!Molten Sticky Toffee Cupcake - AMAZING! You MUST try this. I usually chose the dessert with chocolate, but this was delicious!Throughout the entire meal every 10 minutes or so the entire staff would break out in song and dance. The same waitresses that are serving you are also the performers. I felt like I was watching a combination of American Idol and Americas Got Talent. There are no weak links in the staff here and each person shines brightly.Thank you to Jason and Alex who came over to check on us frequently and made us feel so welcome! I will definitely be back and I will be bringing more friends next time. Sushi Roxx nailed it and I cannot wait to return!P.S. You never know who you will see when you are dining there. Apparently lots of celebs are already flocking to this place! Natalie Morales was there with her family the night we went. Apparently the other night Karina Smirnoff got up and danced with the team! The cast of Orange is the New Black, Raven Simone and many others.",2,2,3

There was another individual who overlooked us quite a bit when it was time for seating (I'm assuming she was the lead performer for the night), which was extremely frustrating.

90,Bruce K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0,1.0,9/10/2016,So sad. Such a great concept and such bad service. Never seen small sushi rolls with almost invisible pieces of fish. But more importantly Drinks took forever. For place with this type of atmosphere all you need is drinks coming immediately. People loose interest and get bored when they ask for a drink and it take 45 minutes to get one. Get another Bartender or one who is quick on his feet.

92,Tessa L.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/11/2017,"My friends and I decided to celebrate my roommate's birthday at Sushi Roxx after seeing a thinly veiled advertisement for it on Real Housewives of New York. Luann's testimonial for the place was pretty convincing. Admittedly, I didn't have the highest hopes for the place - I figured our trip to Sushi Roxx would be a funny gag. BOY WAS I WRONG. My dinner at Sushi Roxx was one of the most fun dinners I've ever had!We made our reservation on the earlier side, 8 PM, and when we arrived there were only two other parties: a 30-person sweet 16 and a small group of girls celebrating a 6th birthday party. Our host told us not to worry and ""these children will be leaving soon."" Makes sense, as 9 was when the fun really started! By that point the kids had left and the rest of the restaurant was packed. The concept of Sushi Roxx is that all the waiters and waitresses are singers/actors/dancers and they totally delivered! There's a spontaneous dance number about every 20 minutes and they blew us away. My friends and I were dancing in our seats all night. The four bottles of wine we ordered didn't hurt either.The food was pretty tasty -- by no means is this high-end or authentic sushi, BUT it was delicious none the less. The edamame appetizer was our favorite.Since it was my roommate's birthday I snuck off early in the night to track down our waitress and ask them to sing for him. It seemed like everyone there was celebrating a birthday - at least 5 or 6 throughout the night. They have the staff sing for you while your name appears on the restaurant's 3-4 TVs. Plus, a round of shots!All in all, I didn't have the highest hopes for my trip to Sushi Roxx but I was more than pleasantly surprised. They do a great job at creating a truly fun atmosphere and we're already planning our next trip for my other friend's birthday. Sushi Roxx does, in fact, ROCK.",,,
93,David G.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,60,2,1.0,5/1/2016,"I was thinking about giving it 5 stars but then I decided to take away a star for everything that went wrong. 1. Ordering a drink takes 30 minutes. Almost had to start ordering 2 at a time. 2. They might have gotten there fish from the Hudson River. 3. It was extremely overpriced for what we received. $165 per person ($330 a couple).4. The management is rude. They barely announced last call and when I asked to order another drink, he told me ""he can show me where the bar is"". Very unprofessional after what we have spent. The bathroom is cool.",4,3,
94,Jill M.,"Armonk, NY",0,8,0,3.0,8/29/2016,"Very torn, I love the concept of this place however we had a couple of complaints. We arrive with a group of 20, they tell us to wait at the bar, we say ok great we just want to make sure our bar tab is transferred to the table so that it's easier for a large group. They say it's not possible? Anyway, they change their minds and say we can do it, but that the table is a 2 drink minimum and the drinks from the bar won't count towards this? Anyway this is after waiting over 20 minutes for our table, much back and forth. 45 minutes later they seat is- at two separate tables? Ok fine, we are dancing and having fun so it's no big deal. It's hard to tell with a large amount party if the bill is correct but 3 different people complain that their food never came out and to just remove it from the bill, magically the food is ""almost ready"", mind you this is after the bill has already come out. We asked the waitress who asked the manager if they could say happy birthday to our friend or something cute, they told us we had to buy a round of shots or two bottles of champagne. Anyway, it's a great concept, we all had fun dancing. Just definitely wish they could work out the kinks.  Fun music, dancers were adorable, food was ok but we didn't really go for the food,more for the fun atmosphere and entertainment. I did speak to the owner after posting this review, he was very apologetic and I do think he has a lot of pride in and cares about this restaurant.

You will enjoy fun live music and dancing performances - perfect enhancement for a dining experience. At the same time it not too noisy so you can perfectly hear each other. This place is good for big groups and birthdays - you feel a party there. The service is very slow there - it took us 20 min to get our drinks. Considering that there weren't too many people in the place, this is weird.I am giving 3 stars because it is hard to understand what audience this place does target. On one hand, performances they give and atmosphere reminds a burlesque party, which is for adults who want to drink and have fun. On the other hand, this place is always packed with teenagers and kids - this diminishes the perspective to have an adult party there.",3,1,1

I recommend you go around 9-930 because when we first for there there the place was filled with little  10-12 yr old girls...

(I posted videos!) The Show: the singers were unbelievable, amazing talent! And so were the dancers! They had from old school Michael Jackson songs to a little Gloria Stefan, to new pop music. Everything was very upbeat and a happy time!The food: it's a Japanese sushi place, but they do also offer other things besides sushi like chicken teriyaki and rice, etc. I ordered for appetizer the shishito peppers, they were so delicious as well as the edamame. You must have the spicy kani salad, it's a type of crab and spicy mayo mixture, my absolute favorite. For my sushi, I had the pink panther it comes in soy paper, with snow crab and  wasabi aoli. My second roll was the spice girl, it was jalapeño, spicy salmon and basil... These 2 rolls were my ultimate favorite!!

We were looking for a sushi fusion place (where we could get fun sushi rolls) and this was perfect. Try the roxxy and surf and turf. The Big Mac roll was just ok. The drinks were terrific! We tried the flux capacitor and the annexation of Puerto Rico - both were so good, we'd come back even just for drinks. To finish we had the sticky toffee pudding.

We had to ask for water, soy sauce, the sauce that was suppose to come with our appetizer, we had to flag our server down just to place an order. Expect to pay $18 for a mediocre roll, and $15 for a cocktail. It tastes fresh at least, but it's not $18 good. And their sake is conpletely overpriced. So, if you are looking to party - it's a good spot. But if you are really hungry- probably not the best spot.

117,LaCheryl B.,"Boston, MA",212,10,2,4.0,4/4/2017,"Love it! The sushi was amazing and I had a margarita that blew my mind. The bar tender talked it up and man he wasn't kidding. Not crowded, great service, and clean. I would definitely come back!",,,

Love you Sariah!!!",,,
120,Chan B.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",58,14,6,4.0,1/13/2017,It's like a night club meets an upscale sushi restaurant. They have live performers and its pretty loud so it makes for a lousy date spot but a great place to go with friends to celebrate. It's great for all ages too. When I went there were 5 separate birthday parties going on and two of them were kids parties. Definitely going to visit again with my friends. The food was amazing!,,,
121,Shivani G.,"Chicago, IL",23,17,20,5.0,3/27/2016,"We came here this past friday for a friends' birthday dinner. This place is quite unexpectedly amazing. Ambience- very club-y which is great if youre going out after or are just down to have a good time. The waitresses perform every hour and they quite energetic. Drinks: I got the lemongrass one which was pretty good but couldn't taste much of the lemongrass. A friend got the wild ginger one which was yumm if you like ginger. The rest of them seemed toLove their drinks as well.Food: my favorite part! We are vegetarian and the menu does not look very veg friendly. Surprisingly we ordered a lot of things, all amazing. Our favorites were the spicy edamame with ginger. SoSpicy and flavorful that we were just unable to figure out the exact ingredients. The eggplant again was unlike anything I've ever eaten. Delicately flavored with some heavenly dressing. The mushroom polenta was to die for as well. The sushi was ok but the rest of the flavors made up for it.Will recommend this place to others for sure!",,,
122,Shannon K.,"Torrance, CA",0,7,1,5.0,12/30/2015,As a New Yorker who likes unique experiences this place is amazing! The sushi is actually delicious (this coming from a spoiled CA sushi fanatic) and the atmosphere is so fun! Other reviews note the  tempura flakes but they must have stopped that....good restaurants adapt. The music is a collaboration of every song you ever liked in your life (all genres) and the performances are top notch. One of the songs I thought was the original but it was our waitress singing. Highly recommended for a fun group outing...especially if you get the party punch bowl!,1,,
123,Frank S.,"Queens, NY",149,20,0,5.0,2/16/2017,"I brought a friend to Sushi Roxx for her first time and what must have been my 10th or more. I was unaware that I was stepping into the debut for an almost entirely new staff with exceptional voices.  Although it was the first night for many, everything was conducted seamlessly.The staff was extremely cordial and attentive even so far as to give us a heads up on when the next performance would start in case there was anything we wanted or needed in advance of the next set.The food as always was delicious with my favorite roll still being the surf and turf, favorite starter Rock Shrimp Tempura and if you are at all a fan of gin, my preference being Bombay Sapphire which you can find in the amazing Double Dragon.I've already mentioned Sushi Roxx to a new friend ;-) so I know that I will happily be back there again soon.",,,
124,Lior N.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,4.0,12/10/2016,"I didn't give 5 stars only because of the really long wait for the table (even with a reservation).Otherwise.. great staff, great singers and dancers for entertainment and a great DJ who played all of my favorite 00's hip hop. Drinks were delicious and food was good too! I came with friends who are regulars so they ordered all the food, but no complaints! The decor was loud, cool, and really tied up the experience. Would totally recommend to go in a group, get some shots for the table!",1,,
125,Skylar L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,5,0,5.0,3/10/2017,"If you're looking for a fun place to celebrate your birthday, this is the place to go! You walk in to your typical hotel bar area and then get escorted through a curtain into the main venue which consists of a wait staff of performers, music videos playing on columns in the center of the room, crazy lights, and great music. All in all it's a really fun atmosphere. To top it off, the food is amazing and the cocktails are to die for and since it was my birthday they brought out a sundae the size of my head! I'll definitely be back!",,,
126,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",596,822,7,4.0,10/7/2015,"Now that fashion week is over I can get back to fashionplates that feature some of the great new S/S16 line.  One of the bestie's decided to have her bday party at new interactive hotspot- Sushi Roxx recently so I decided it was a perfect reason to get dolled up and wear our new raw silk leather trim pencil skirt.  It's attached to the hotel and a fairly large space with servers who dance and sing throughout the night.  On the night her birthday party was Mob Wives also happened to be filming which made for an entertaining dinner before a night out on the town.Since it was a birthday party we had a prix fix menu that was served family style with some appetizers, sushi and chicken teriyaki.  I decided to go with a decent bottle of cold sake.  Some stand out dishes for me were the fried avocado, seriously delish with the dipping sauce.  The peppers were also good.  I'm not much of a roll person but I sampled a few pieces that were solid, the usual crunchy spice tuna, salmon etc... This isn't on 15 East level but it gets the job done if you like rolls.  The chicken and broccoli were solid.  They let our friend bring her own cake and everyone had a fab time so all in all a fun dining experience with a large group.",1,,2
127,Cynthia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,35,8,4.0,8/14/2015,"I am pleasantly surprised by this place. One of the staff members of SushiRoxx is a very good friend of mine and told me she learned a dance for opening night. I went in there with zero expectations and was blasted away by what I saw. Ambiance: 8/10Again, I had no idea what to expect going in there, I expected the typical japanese sushi bar you walk into. I walked in, and I found a 1970's hippy Tokyo style out of a video game. I was blown away by the amount of decor this place had, and their bathroom is basically a solo disco, very retro, very awesome. The only reason why its not 10/10 is I did find it a little too dark and the lighting had too much red. Food: Sorry I'm a foodie, I have to be hard on this one.The food was okay-I ordered Chicken Satay, Salmon Tomato Box, and Sushi Roxx roll. I've had all three foods before somewhere else along the line so I do have a comparison point. The Chicken satay is not chicken satay--its chicken breast covered in melted PB with a bit of honey. This has to be the most passive chicken satay I've ever had. Chicken Satay is suppose to be chunks of marinated chicken grilled or barbecued and then dipped into sauce, I'm pretty sure theirs was a meat mixture shaped into a stick structure, steamed or parboiled and then lathered in sauce. it was sweet, soft and basically a tiny cake of chicken meat covered in sweet peanut buttery sauce. It was OK, i give this a 5/10.Salmon Tomato Box 6/10Its a bed of rice with small chunks of salmon with tomato puree and some crunchy stuff on top. Again, its okay, the tomato base gave it a small twinge of flavor but completely masked the taste of Salmon. This completely removed any trace of ""this is fresh high quality fish"" it might have had and covered it in little crispy bits. The crispy bits gave nothing but texture and oily mouth feel which the sushi vinegar was suppose to cut out. Side note, my friend eats wasabi straight, he said the wasabi is not high quality. I give this a 6/10? and the wasabi my friend gives a 3/10. These things matter!!!Sushi Roxx RollI like this one, its spicy tuna, rock shrimp and a sliver of jalapeno in a roll, its basically a combination that cannot fail. The roll was seriously tiny and the spicy tuna was undetectable but the rock shrimp was good, I liked the touch of jalapeno which was super thinly sliced and I'm pretty sure the sushi chef who prepared this has OCD Perfectionism because each one looked exactly the same size, thickness and shape. I give this 8/10My friends ordered two other rolls but I can't recall the name so no ratings for those.Bar/Cocktails:I only had Cobra Kai because I like vodka, I liked the idea of the combination but the drink itself had a really strange aftertaste. Our server (bless her) took it off our list because I had let her know it was not my ideal taste. She's an angel!We tried to get other drinks at their bar but they only have the drinks on their cocktail list, so no liqueurs you expect at a regular bar. Its rather hard to get a different cocktail or a cocktail to my taste so we left shortly after. My friends ordered two other drinks but again, I can't recall the name so no ratings for those.Entertainment: 10/10Your performers are ON POINT. I loved this part, I totally did not expect a show but a show was given every 10 mins or so a new hit was performed. Your Servers are gorgeous and really good performers. The singers all had very strong vocals and you can definitely heard their talent. Hold on to them!! All your dancers were very in sync and sexy to boot. I would come here just for the show. Staff: 10/10Your entertainment staff are amazing, your service is amazing, we never felt under-serviced and everyone was super accomodating. I found it entertaining that I had used my plate for about 5 mins and one of your servers came around, saw a spot on my plate and switched it out. I was a little confused but highly entertained by this. Overall, this was a 4 star experience. My advice would be consider more focus on the food because this is the primary attraction point. Food first, nightclub second. Your dream is amazing but a girl's gotta eat! PS. stock a full bar please, I would have stayed much longer if you had one.",4,,1

(Thank goodness) While waiting for our table, we were treated to shots at the bar. We made our way through the curtains and that's when I knew we were at the right place. Our server was fabulous, he made sure we always had our glasses full.. Our dinner included all you can drink beer, wine, and sakiOn to the food.... We had many starters to choose from, shishitu peppers, edamame (the best I've ever had), yellowtail tartare, and avocado tempura. As for the main course,  they brought out 5 different kinds of rolls, they were all awesome. Oh and every 15 minutes the waiters/staff perform and sing, they can dance ! They sang happy bachelorette to our bride and the guys even serenaded her (At our request)The music was excellent and we jumped on the dance floor after dinner. Saved the best part for last, A brownie mint ice cream sundae arrived with another dessert but that one wasn't as good. This place is def a good time.",4,,2
129,Suzie Y.,"New York, NY",49,84,463,3.0,9/2/2015,"Creative sushi restaurant.  You won't get to be seated at your reservation time since we were still waiting close to an hour after our reservation time. We were told performance is worth the wait by customers that were leaving, so that actually helped us to wait.  Soon as  you enter its a bar area so we waited there.  When we finally got in, I was super excited.  So much rave about the performance and what not by all customers.  Unfortunately, we entered for the last performance of the night and I heard performers didn't perform.  Instead it was the waiters there who did some performing.  It was very short and not worth the wait.  I was bit disappointed since I was totally there for the performance.  I guess if anyone is interested make sure to go for early dinner.FOOD:  okieService:  Very good!Performance: TBD",2,,1

Great shows and dancing.We ordered avocado tempura and ginger edaname to start both were great, first time we had avacado tempura.  For the rolls we started with malibu, spice girl and the big mac.  Big Mac was our favorite, suggest eating with your hands so good.We wanted to order more rolls and Alex suggested two more to try surf and turf and roxxy.  Only issue the kitchen was unable to process this order and we ended up taking it home after waiting over 30 minutes to arrive.  When we asked for the check they did comp the last 2 rolls. That was a great move that we appreciated.Overall was a fun night, good food on the pricey side.",1,,

Updated review","Great place for fun night out with the girls or group of friends. The BigMac sushi rolls were the star of the rolls, our favorite. The polenta was tasty and the rock shrimp were endless. The atmosphere is loud with  lots of screens playing music videos. Performances every half hour with servers dancing and hostess singing. Added to the clubby, loud, vibe they're going for. If you're looking for a place to have fun and good food this is it.",,,

Loved everything about it! The atmosphere, food, drinks, entertainment, the disco ball in the restrooms, and the service - ON POINT!! Had the Kung Fu Hustle cocktail which was very refreshing. The tuna flatbread pizza, avocado tempura, Big Mac and Malibu roll were mouthwatering. Shoutout to Shawnti, Alex, Sariah and Taylor for taking such good care of us! And thank you for singing happy birthday to me and introducing me to the Molten Sticky Toffee Cupcake, which was heavenly! That dessert is a MUST and a great way to end the night.

134,Mickey P.,"Manhattan, NY",778,19,0,5.0,8/30/2015,"I went to Sushi Roxx with a few girlfriends this Saturday and I would for sure recommend it! The food was really amazing and all very unique versions of tradition Japanese dishes as well as some really outside the box items. I am on a strict diet (F-Factor) and There were a lot of healthy options as well as the non healthy yummy stuff you also want to see. Then on top of that the setting is as if you are on the streets of  Tokyo and amazing performers sing and dance with great skill intermittently while you eat.  You totally feel like you traveled to another country for the night. The owner, his staff and the performers are all very attentive and you can tell there is a real appreciation for every little detail. The performers are all amazingly talented, especially Sariah. She literally lights up the room in her crystal encrusted floor length jacket and bejeweled microphone. I would recommend this for a girls night out, a romantic and fun date (probably 3 or more dates in), or a celebration meal such as a birthday or bachelorette. I plan on going back asap!!!",1,2,1

138,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",877,406,479,4.0,4/29/2016,"I had a great experience with my friends at this place for some entertainment, serious booze, hot chicks , and great sushi. When you walk inside through the hotel lobby, you feel like you just entered a club. There are flat screen TVs everywhere, colorful Asian comic designs that pop out, loud speakers with hits from the 90's-present, and a bar in the front, a small stage, and a dark funky bathroom with a disco ball lol. I have to say the place is very creative and far from boring.The waitress we had was very friendly, but I have to say the service here was lacking, that's probably the only thing that holds me back from 5 stars. Its annoying that I had to wait a half hour for my drink or another half hour for my appetizers and like another 45 mins for entrees that required 0 cooking [all I got was salad and rolls lol come on].What I liked was the yummy seasoned popcorn that was put on the table for both sides, I couldn't get enough of it. The tableware was also nice with fancy red chopsticks and cute handcrafted plates. Every single thing I had here was delicious, from the fried avocado appetizer to the spicy kani salad & california roll, they were huge in portions, fresh, flavorful. I even enjoyed the simple cucumber avocado roll.If you feel like being fancy, the other rolls here have great presentation and are huge [ most of them come with 8 pieces, the veggie rolls come with 6]. Every hour between our meals the whole staff [both men and women] would do sexy dance routines , they were phenomenal and energetic, I couldn't even get mad at my boyfriend for looking haha.I also like how when you order a bottle of champagne,the whole staff does a dance for your table, it was great to have the spotlight at that moment for the birthday boy.The  prices here are modest considering its in manhattan, the mixed cocktails are 16 and up but strong as hell, [the shots are 18 depending what brand you get,  the shots are probably not worth it] while the appetizers range from 12-16, and the rolls range from 14-20. The only pricy items were the chicken teriyaki for over 20 dollars and the filet mignon for 42, but the portions are huge and filling so its totally worth it.  The bill at the end with tip included was very reasonable, 160 dollars between four couples total is well worth it since it includes gratuity and entertainment.The dessert menu also looked really good with various sundae and cake options, too bad I was already full, theres always next time.My advice to you is come here in large groups, you will have more fun and attention . Also book it at least a month in advance. The bottle service here is worth the price. They usually put on shows Friday and Saturday nights.  And dress to impress.",10,1,4

After reviewing the bill and giving my credit card, noticed the amount charged was different than what I remembered. Turns out, it's because - without noticed - they added a 3% service charge for using a credit card. It's sad. This is supposed to be for a special occasion. It's already expensive, but you expect to pay that for the entertainment and service. Then, in the end, they sneak on a charge without notice? Just up your prices and be honest if you need to charge more. Don't sneak on charges. Left a really bad taste. After inquiring about the charge, they did take it off after a lot of back and forth, but it's the principle, not the actual charge. Be honest. Run a decent business. You would have amazing reviews and word of mouth if you could just be transparent. I love taking people here but don't want to anymore if you're going to pad their bills.",,,

Walk in to this place, and it seemed to be pretty laid back. Most of the tables were empty actually. Then we were asked if we wanted to sit in the back........... and  it was all history from there.  Go past the curtain and you are presented with an incredibly decorated room...practically like a club.  We sat at the sushi bar and admired the cocktail list... didn't have very high expectations, but when they came out.... we were BLOWN AWAY! How could a place like this have such a legit cocktail program?! WOW!!!  Ended up ordering every single drink on the menu between my wife and I and we were very impressed.  I'm talking they can go up against some of the heavy hitter cocktail lounges in the LES...very impressive.  Oh the sushi was great too.

All the waiter/waitresses were really friendly especially our girl Brittney. I ordered the Mr.Pink sushi roll and it was pretty good.

The reason I'm taking a star away is because they forgot one of our apps and still charged us and we also felt a bit rushed and they kept asking us of we were ready to leave which was kind of annoying. They were nice enough to set us up with a table in the lobby so we could get the birthday girl her dessert but it kinda ruined the fun with the lobby ambiance. All in all if you're celebrating something and want to have a good time with good music, this is your place!",,,

161,Kay W.,"Quincy, MA",0,39,15,3.0,5/29/2016,Four stars for the performances done by the staff but I would give 1.5 stars for the food. My friend had the tuna n avocado roll and she wasn't impressed. I had the teriyaki chicken and the avocado and wasabi rice bowl and both dishes I could have done without. But great performances though. So I'll settle with giving an overall stars.,,,

The White Dragon roll was recommended to us by the waiter, so we got that too. It's not something I would've normally ordered, but very tasty. We went on a Friday night and it was very crowded. Reservation is probably a must.",2,,

168,Amber P.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,12,1,1.0,3/16/2016,"What a dreadful place. I just happened to be drawn in by the music and tv lights on my way back to my room at the Tuscany after a long day. I was standing by a table for no more than 60 seconds (and to be clear, looking quite well appointed amidst the very scant and quite passé crowd) when a hostess informed me that I needed to check in with her. I explained that I was a hotel guest, just passing through. She became so rude and insistent that I ""check in"" even though I'd no intentions of staying and spending a night with that d-list they'd somehow assembled. The manager I spoke to after this brief exchange was nice and tried to buy me a drink.  But alas, my demi bottle of champagne in my own company was much more alluring than the rent party they seemed to be throwing at Sushi Roxx. Hope they make their overhead! It's 2016 and the moment of faux exclusivity in NYC is well over.",,1,
169,Mariana L.,"New York, NY",360,601,186,4.0,11/4/2015,"This definitely has a tourist trap feel, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The decor is a lot of fun, half of the entertainment is in that. The sushi and other dishes are above average but not spectacular. Yes, the food and drinks are pricey, but that's because the cost of the show/entertainment is built into it. If you think of it that way, then Sushi Roxx is a bargain. Your servers are also your entertainers. If they aren't the quickest folks, it is because they probably setting up for their next number which can be Broadway style musicals, burlesque dances or sultry cabaret. You don't want to rush through your meal, make this a night out. It's a little cheesy at times, but who cares? Enjoy.",3,1,

And the service was incredible. You're waited on hand and foot better than 5 star restaurants.  Best and most attentive wait staff of any restaurant.

After arguing we said you will not see us in there again HE said I dont want to see any of your faces ever here again!!Rude!! We entertain clients in the city all the time from all countries!! well guess what... never there!! The owner should fire that obnoxious rude demeaning manager!!

The huge chuncks of tofu & greens it was almost like eating a full course meal. I think that was the best miso soup I EVER had. Most miso soups taste like water & u can barely see the tofu. But not here. If Im in the city (bc I usually drive & I hate driving downtown) The only reason I didnt give this place 5 stars is bc I just did a takeout so my review is solely on the food.

Once seated, every table got drinks and popcorn while we waited patiently for someone to notice us. I also noticed the host stopped and said hi to every table but ours. The décor and friendly staff is all this place has going for them. The disco lights in the bathroom is pretty awesome too! If you are a real foodie this is not the place to go. I think the menu is way overpriced! I was disappointed with the show as well. Altho the performance was entertaining it was not what I was expecting at all when I saw the Japanese theme. Our waitress made her best effort to try and apologize for the service but it was too late! I could not wait to get desert somewhere reasonably priced!",4,,

The host and all waiters/waitresses double as performers and they were absolutely amazing. There was singing, there was dancing, and there was damn good music.However, I will say that the sushi itself was not particularly amazing considering the price. The  food was good nonetheless but it is a bit pricier than any sushi place I have been to.

185,Lorenzo V.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,23,7,5.0,7/17/2015,"I expected Sushi Roxx to be another gimmicky restaurant with poor to mediocre food and karaoke type entertainment, but was very surprised by how wrong I was. It is rare to find a restaurant that offers great food and entertainment, but Sushi Roxx is one of those rare restaurants that does just that. When we were first seated, the hostess and waitstaff made it a point to tell us that they wanted us to have a great time and the actions by all employees emphasized it. The staff is incredibly friendly, efficient, attentive and fun. Our food and drinks came out at a perfect pace and we never felt like we were forgotten about. The staff knew the menu and were very happy to assist with picking out food and drinks. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the Black Mamba drink, Wild Ginger Edamame, Avocado Tempura, Shitake Polenta and the Molten Sticky Toffee Cupcake. Besides being incredible hostesses, waiters, and waitresses, the staff are all very talented dancers and singers who break out in song and dance numerous times throughout the course of the meal. You can tell the owners had a clear vision of what they wanted when they hired the staff because the quality of the performances are better than what you can expect to find at one of today's pop star's concerts, one major difference is the performers at Sushi Roxx are actually singing live. The best part was that you could tell that the performers were just having so much fun and truly enjoyed being there, which translated perfectly to the crowd. Sushi Roxx is an excellent place to go to for a fun night out with delicious food, great service, and fun,quality entertainment.",5,,2

The waiters and waitresses are some of the city's most gifted singers and dancers and they're not afraid to show you why. From the moment you walk in the over the top dining room you know you're in for a treat.  The sushi rolls are standout as are the signature cocktails. A DJ spins during your dining session and then the Sushi Roxx experience begins when the hostess starts singing while circulating the room, later in the night the bus boys and waitresses break into dance to Beyoncé and then leads into me being surprised when the waitress tending to my table busts into an inflatable sumo wrestler to whip and nae nae - whether it's a night out with the girls or in my case a birthday dinner I'll never forget, I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant.",,,

They serve delicious sushi (quality fish, tasty ingredients and interesting rolls), have live entertainment, and the staff and Manager are super engaging. The Manager (Jason) was a delight, he came over a few times to make sure everything was going well and everyone was happy. We had a small misunderstanding about the bill and he handles it with the utmost class and courtesy. It's evident he prioritizes happy customers, and because of that, we will be back! Wonderful spot for girls night out, celebrations of any kind or just a fun dinner!!!",,,

It ended up being one of the best nights of his life! The kids loved the food, especially the Roxxy roll, and the show was a thrill for them. But what made it really stand out, was the service, especially from the hostess Sariya, and the owner, Jason, who made it their personal goal to ensure our son had the time of his life. The restaurant was completely packed on a Sat nite, but the two of them cleared space for him and went as far as to call us at home to let us know when they were seated at their table and to let us know he was enjoying himself. Above and beyond. Thanks guys!",1,,

I wish I could remember the name of the reservationist and our waitress-they were both incredible. They had to move us around a bit so the manager sent us a round of shots too. It was like they truly cared about making our night incredible. Best place to have a birthday party in NYC hands down! If you come here, put on your dancing shoes! Thanks again!!",,,

198,Elaine B.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",1,2,0,1.0,6/15/2016,"I know it's easy to think that people who leave 1 star when everyone else says 4/5 are just difficult -- but seriously, my experience at Sushi Roxx last weekend was so bad I feel compelled to put out a warning. My friends and I used to be waitresses. We know what it's like to deal with tough customers which is why we're super chill, very generous and pretty hard to upset when it comes to a night out. Given this, we were completely understanding when a multitude of things went wrong on Saturday, including the 30 minutes we waited just to get our first drink. The only thing that wasn't mediocre the night was the bill  ($180/person), but whatever, we were out for my friend's birthday so even that wasn't an issue. Until the manager practically pushed(!) us out the door as soon as they rushed through the dessert course. Staff started pulling drink glasses out of our hands and the manager literally walked around handing out credit card slips and hovering over people's shoulders instructing them to ""just total and sign, we need the table"". When we pointed out that it was quite rude not to even let us enjoy the rest of our drinks, especially considering the hefty tab (and our patience with the service), he became argumentative and completely condescending. Here's a tip for how it works at any reputable establishment in New York ... if you need to turnover a table, just offer to buy your guests a drink at the bar. It's not rocket science. This place is total amateur hour - unless you're a fan of crappy sushi (or the happy birthday song, it's quite anticlimactic by the 10th time) - stay away!",2,,
199,Amy L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,3.0,12/30/2016,"This place was interesting to say the least. I did enjoy the food a lot. You can't go wrong with spicy tuna on crispy rice, or some of their specialty rolls. But the minute the live music and dancing started- it was not so enjoyable. The hostess should have warned us at the door that this would be occurring, because we would have sat elsewhere in the restaurant. It was definitely not your average meal, with a pleasant environment. If you are looking for good sushi but extremely loud music and entertainment, then this is the place for you!",,,
