0,James H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",15,19,0.0,5.0,11/3/2018,"Four of us for dinner and we all really enjoyed it.  Great wine list.  Good food.  Good service.  What made it special was the house historian, who visited and talked with us about the history of Chumley's and all the literary luminaries who have passed through, most of whom had photo portraits up on the wall, along with all the old book jackets.Note: cocktails in New York City run about $5 higher than in the rest of the world.  What's up with that?",,,

2,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,5.0,9/23/2018,"Very cool speakeasy. Make sure you're careful when ringing the bell. We made the rookie mistake of ringing the bell for the green door that said ""Not Chumley's"" thinking it was an attempt to keep the semi-secret spot even more secret. It was indeed NOT Chumley's. Ring the bell for the door to the right of this one, which is in fact Chumley's. Don't be like us.Came here on a Saturday night with reservations for 4 and were seated right away. First on our agenda was ordering drinks. My friends got adventurous and tried some cocktails from the menu, but I'm super picky with drinks. If I start my night drinking wine, I have to stick with it. Same for beer, tequila, whatever alcohol. On this night, I wanted to stick with tequila, but nothing on the menu really piqued my interest. Our server, however, offered to make a unique tequila drink not featured on the cocktail menu. I went with her recommendation and did not regret it. It was tequila, mint, lime, and a couple of other ingredients that I don't remember. Incredibly refreshing. This was a very good recommendation.Up next we ordered a round of oysters for the table. These were SO good. Actually, I'll go as far as saying these were some of the best oysters I've had in NYC. Perfectly salty, served on ice, with a perfect mignonette sauce. I have to find out where these oysters are from because they were THAT good. I'll definitely be coming back for these.The speakeasy's historian walked by our table and was nice enough to give us some background on the pictures adorning the walls above us. The photos were of authors who had actually visited this spot and published books. Very cool. All of the photos were authentic as well. No copies, just the real deal.The service was spot on. Our server was knowledgable on the menu and extremely accommodating. I'd definitely come back here again. One of the coolest speakeasies I've been to in a while.",6,2,3

4,Ryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",424,257,589,1.0,5/2/2018,"Charming and cozy interior. Good service. Drinks - nothing special but way overpriced. $10 for a 5 ounce mocktail!!!!!!!!! Risotto good but simple and forgettable. Overpriced. Lamb ""pie"" not good - soupy mess with a soggy top. Not thick, not surrounded by crust. Just a bowl of lamb in clear, unthickened liquid with some peas and onions. At best it was just clear broth, at worst it was water. What the heck. Like straight up nasty. Hard to think this was anything other than using up last weeks leftover lamb. Very poor show and sealed the deal on not returning.",,,
5,Michael H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,22,1,4.0,11/19/2018,"I really like Chumley's.  It's probably more 4 1/2 stars.  The burger is excellent.  It is one of my favorites in NYC.  I've also had a few appetizers and they have all been very good.  The cocktails are excellent and the beer selection is also very good.  I've been a few times and the service is always on point.  Very friendly, helpful when you need it, but not overbearing in any way.  The vibe of Chumley's is elegant, but not pretentious.  Serious about providing a good experience, but a bit laid back at the same time.  The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the cost.  Everything is just a bit pricier than I would expect.  Still, I am a returning customer and recommend it to my friends.",,,
6,Angela R.,"Bronx, NY",8,150,86,4.0,7/12/2018,"Definitely put your gps on to get here, because the entrance is just a green door. It can easily be missed. As soon as you walk in you are transported back in time to a prohibition speakeasy. It's dark with some lighting. It just gives you that eerie feel that makes you think something crazy has happened here. The drinks were amazing. If you are in the area please stop by!",,,
7,Camille G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",131,333,734,5.0,4/11/2018,Walked by Chumley's it's closed on Sundays. Brett our tour guide gave us the 411 on its secret rear entrance which now it's not used any longer. It's one of the oldest spots and it's full of history.

8,Ron J.,"Lower East Side, Milwaukee, WI",28,32,0,5.0,8/1/2018,"Everything meets the standards of a great evening: the historic location, the cool neighborhood, the ambiance, the service, the menu, the quality of service and delicious food finally topped off with killer cocktails.On top of all that, my wife and I made a 7:30 appointment, and when something came up to make us late, they were more than accommodating, held our table for us, and made us feel at ease about being about thirty minutes late. The place was packed, so I know they went out of their way to be sure we had a table when we finally arrived. The place hits high marks in every way. The cost is appropriate for the quality of the experience and food served.",1,,1

10,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10944,3.0,1/16/2018,"Another bar/speakeasy type of place on my friend's crawl of historical village places he wanted to check out. The history for Chumley's is rich. It opened in 1922 during prohibition and became a favorite hangout for various poets and writers. The speakeasy unfortunately suffered some damage to the structure and closed in 2007. Eventually reopened in 2016 to something that is not at all what it was in its glory days. Now its just an over-priced restaurant and cocktail lounge. The door remains unmarked and very much the same is the main cool factor. I think the dining area is typically reservations only and the entire place is packed. They will however, if the bar area isn't too completely full, allow you to stand around other couples sitting cozy up at the bar. If I were sitting. . . . this would be awkward. About as awkward as it was for me to stand and lunge over various couples for the drink menu and join them on their dates. But it's okay, I was ruining these precious moments with other people. Second, there's not a lot of space to put your stuff if you're standing. We asked if we could hang our coats up somewhere and was given dirty looks but they do have a coat closet. I only came for the drinks. . . . which are outstandingly priced. I've been to speakeasies, fancy lounges, rooftop bars, hotel bars and somehow this was even more expensive than that standard. For my cocktail I ordered the ""It Happened at Midnight"" (Highwest Rendezvous Rye, Apple Brandy, Eiswein, Dry Vermouth, Ginseng, Certosa). I have no idea what half of these ingredients are but I wanted more bang for my buck. It was pretty tasty but I wasn't blown away. I think what I would have been partial to was their egg nog and beet cocktail but I'm not paying $20 for alcoholic egg nog. One of the people in our group actually disliked his drink so much that he sent it back and ordered a different one. What I was annoyed with is that cocktails are marked as $16 on their menu but when I asked how much my drink was the bartender told me $17, not including tax/tip. Maybe the drink menu should reflect these changes. Second annoying thing that happened. I ordered a beer after my cocktail since my friends wanted to stay longer. It was a fancy beer. A $12 milk stout. I rarely spend this kind of money on drinks but it was the holidays and mama got a raise, so treat yourself. Anyway, the second thing that annoyed me, I again was paying cash and asked how much my drink was (wouldn't want any miscommunication with the menu) and the bartender said that it technically was $12 but with tax it is $13 she said. Again, I was standing at the bar and not actually sitting so I found the tax comment kind of ridiculous also incredibly obnoxious that she was warning me like a child as to how much I should tip her. The beer was fantastic, the cocktail was very meh, the service was rude. The atmosphere. . . . bougie and not in the fun way. I wouldn't go out of my way to ever coming back.  3 stars for the history behind it but really a 2 star experience. Rip Old Chumley's.",9,4,7
11,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,151,4.0,1/31/2018,"Went with a couple of friends to grab a bite to eat after reading many great things about this place.We were pretty hungry so we decided to split a few dishes:86'd burger (4 stars): This burger was decent, but I have to say I was left a bit underwhelmed considering that this is their most well known dish--and at that price tag, I have had better.Black bass (3.5 stars): The fish was cooked well, though the portion was pretty light and I felt that there was not a ton of flavor to it.Cassoulet (4 stars): I enjoyed this dish, though again there wasn't any flavors that really popped out at me. The flavor was decent, and it was a good portion size as well.Overall, this place has a cute atmosphere for dinner and serves up some decent food. Word on the street is that there is a new chef and the food just isn't hitting the marks that it used to. Quite a shame, as this place has a lot of potential.",4,,
12,Diamantis K.,"Manhattan, NY",24,114,45,4.0,7/10/2018,"Okay when you get there, just push the door open lol. Took me like 3 minutes to debate weather or not to knock wait or leave. The place is blast from the gangster pinstriped past of NYC. The drinks are great with a bunch of seasonal ones and classic drinks. They also have a really good looking food menu but we only went for drinks.Worth stopping in in your looking for a old school speakeasy.",1,1,1
13,Jay I.,"New York, NY",250,682,190,4.0,6/27/2017,"So this is one of those speakeasy bars who is run by the same guy who is behind sushi nakazawa and also runs Patricia in the Bronx.  As far as I know this bar has been there for a while but was recently renovated.Outside it just looks like nothing.  There is just a door, but then you see people coming in and out so can guess it is a bar.Inside the wall is filled with old pictures, book covers and other stuff that are funny.  We started with the oyster which were very fresh and then had some other food.  I don't remember much but there was one food that was sticking out: burger.  So the pattie was infused with bone marrow which made the burger so much richer and tastier.  Pretty nice place to chill out for a night out except that it is Rather expensive and hard to get reservation on that purpose...",4,,1
14,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,187,15,5.0,1/2/2018,"Keep your eyes peeled for this inconspicuous spot.In the cold winter temperatures, the only thing that tipped me off to the location (besides a lady snapping a shot of the door for instagram) was the covered doorway.Walk inside and it's a little winter wonderland, resplendent in red, green, and gold ornaments. We had a reservation and were immediately seated by the bar. The table and atmosphere was great, however on one of the coldest days of the year, we were seated next to what used to be the main door and despite the lush velvet curtains covering it, that door still let in a mighty draft.Though once I had a drink or two in me, I didn't care much about that draft. The drinks were strong, yet well balanced.I ordered the 86'd burger, which I was told as my dining companion's favorite burger, ever. That's a ringing endorsement if I've ever heard one. It comes cooked to a perfect medium rare, topped with cheddar cheese, chumley's sauce, bone marrow, and shallots. I've never had bone marrow. In fact, it kind of creeps me out. (I'm not very adventurous sometimes, but it's 2018. I am trying new things.) I went out of my comfort zone (as far out of my comfort zone as a cheeseburger at a fancy restaurant can take me,) and I tried the burger with all of the accouterments. (They won't allow it any other way.) It was incredible--rich and decadent. I highly recommend it. Even the french fries were special and they tasted even better when they were used to zup up the burger juices.We decided to forgo dessert in favor of a dessert-y cocktail. We got one of the last egg nog drinks of the season and oh boy was it good. Creamy, tangy, and so yummy.I would definitely come back, but maybe if someone else was footing the bill! 2 burgers and 4 drinks =$120!",2,,2
15,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,6/6/2017,"Well I never got a chance to come to the original and have honestly not made myself well acquainted with the remakes history. I'd rather not get secondhand upset over a piece of old New York becoming a pricey speakeasy, so I'm choosing not to. We actually stumbled upon the door opening to let other people out and wandered in without knowing what it even was till we had sat down. The kitchen had already closed at 11pm on a school night but we decided to stick around for some cocktails. They make a mean martini, whether you're having it with gin, vodka, or dirty. The martinis are expensive, I think they may have been $21 a pop or something like that, which we didn't quite realize when we sat down. Decor is that of a masculine library: dark woods, leather, famous book covers lining the walls. What really made our night was our bartender Jen, who was far from pretentious. She really made us feel at home and kept us chatting with her till closing time. Music was excellent, I'm pretty sure I remember a lot of the Beatles being played.",3,1,1
16,Nedda K.,"Newport Beach, CA",24,140,2,5.0,7/15/2018,Pretty great place. Speakeasy vibes. Great drinks. Not too generous of pours but that's okay. Ask them to use a heavy hand if needed. Food was delicious and pretty sizable portions. The burger is unreal. Make sure to make a reservation as they do get pretty busy and don't really take walk ins.,,,
17,Daniel M.,"New York, NY",9,166,13,5.0,7/18/2018,"Thought it was great. Great space, great service, and great food. Burger was tasty and rich but not too much. Has a fancy old world feel.",,,
18,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,4.0,5/4/2017,"Like no other place I've ever been to!  An unassuming door enters you to a speakeasy style restaurant and bar. Just a quiet door on Bedford, you could definitely pass by and not know what you're missing! After trying hard to make a reservation in advance online with no success, my friends and I opted to wing it and come just after their daily open at 5:30. Much success! The cocktail menu was unique and offered seasonal creations, which we didn't dive into, but went with wine instead. The handwritten menu, with only about 14-18 menu items, should offer something for everyone, but don't come here for a salad! This menu boasts no appetizers, salads or starters of any sort! Entrees around $30 a pop, including the reason I came - the $27 bone marrow burger with all the flavors! It felt a little greasy, and was definitely a 'heavy' burger, but it was definitely the bone marrow dripping! This burger is a beaut! Double patty - and big patties, none of that thin double patty nonsense - this burger was meaty! Dripping with flavor of bone marrow and crispy sweet shallots, yum! The fries were thin, crispy and cooked to perfection as well. We were in and out in an about an hour, nothing to keep us hanging there, especially since there were people waiting for our table.  The rest of the menu was certainly unique and the presentation around me looked pretty, but I'd still order the burger if I came back! So why not 5 stars? Just based on the odd dining experience - with no apps, it wasn't a big comfy, stay a while restaurant. Worth checking out though!",5,3,6
19,D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,100,541,4.0,9/11/2017,"At a time when the oft-used descriptor of speakeasy has become truly cliche, I still have a hard time finding a better term to describe the vibe of Chumley's.  Hidden behind a nondescript entrance on Bedford Street in the West Village, it's a cozy space with a nice buzz.  Tables are a tad tight, but not surprising for NYC.  Stopped by with a friend for dinner after work.Every item that we sampled was executed nicely and very tasty.  We began with the Lobster Eclair (Lobster, Hazelnut, Espelette Mayonnaise - $18), a small but creative appetizer which balances the slight sweetness in pâte à choux with delicately prepared lobster.  A very nice dish even this non-seafood eater could enjoy.  Beef Tartare (Hazelnut, Confit Tomato, Ombra - $19) was similarly enjoyable and well balanced.  We split the Smoked Huckleberry Duck (Beet Kimchi, White Beet - $34), which was succulent with properly rendered fat and a nicely paired huckleberry sauce, though perhaps on the smaller side.  Finally, the 86'd Burger (Bone Marrow, Crispy Shallot, American Cheese, Chumley's Sauce - $28) was one of the better burgers I've had in NYC.  The messiness is worth it!  Very juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare and decadently topped.  Chumley's cocktail list is well conceived.  My favorite was the Shotgun Wedding (Sotol, Mezcal, Poblano, Honeydew, Pierre Poivre, Habnero, Lemon - $18) which had a hint of heat but showed a deftness in balancing ingredients.Overall, Chumley's lives up to the hype.  Food and beverage were all of good quality, and our waitress was very professional.  She did a nice job giving recommendations, advising when we ordered too much, and being attentive in general.  Give it a try!",5,,
20,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,3.0,2/15/2017,"I did not visit the original establishment. Now that Chumley's has been revived and reviews are out praising the food menu I became interested in checking it out. I was underwhelmed to say the least not just by the food but also by the service. Starters included the pretzel and California dip topped with salmon roe. Then the beef tartare and the John's terrine. The starters actually are quite good. Quite unique, creative and tasty. I'll give thumbs up for all three even though each came out on dishes that are way too big for the tabletop for two. Especially John's terrine - probably about 3""x3"" served on a 10"" plate. The staff seemed almost annoyed trying to find space on the table as if we were causing a problem. The chupe pot pie sounded nice - Dungeness crab baked and served in the shell - but it was such a disappointment. It was saucy yet dry-tasting and had a somewhat earthy (not really enjoyable) aftertaste. The burger was not outstanding but it was good. Unfortunately I don't like brioche but I ate the burger with the bottom half of the bun. I recall the meat was juicy and flavorful. Did not bother with dessert. The evening was forgettable and overall a waste of my calories and time.",1,3,1

24,Pearce D.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,173,489,4.0,11/27/2016,"Never went to the old Chumleys so this review is entirely based on what the place is now. Overall, had a great experience with above average food/service/ambiance. Only thing holding this back from five stars is that for the money, the value is not great. We had the pretzel, beets and crudo appetizers. Highly recommend them all however they are really small portions- splitting between three people meant each person only receive a bite or two of each. For the entrees we got the 86 burger and the trout- again, highly recommend these. In terms of overall NYC burgers, Id still rate Minetta Tavern well above this, but still enjoyed it thoroughly. The trout was a nice surprise, but again we could have eaten another one. Cocktails were also solid, from the scotch and sodas we sampled to the bottle of gamay we had with dinner. Definitely worth a try though in the end it's not on the same level as a Polo Bar or Spotted Pig.",5,1,1
25,Amanda K.,"Kenilworth, NJ",138,234,40,4.0,2/23/2018,The space was soo cool. Old prohibition speak easy type place. No sign on the door.  If you weren't looking for it you'd walk right past it.  It's really small and so is the menu but the drinks were spot on. I prefer a larger menu but we enjoyed what we ate (trout simply cooked) and the lobster to share.,,,
26,John S.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,2.0,12/19/2017,"Checked this out after Victoria left recently, was very disappointed.    Service was nice, but the food, meh.  A mackerel appetizer was a confused, salty mess.   The $24 terrine was flavorless, dry, and small.   The $42 crab pot pie was just simply not worth it.   Basic basic unexciting beer and wine list, cocktails good.This is all too bad - because this is a gorgeous update on an iconic speakeasy room that I recently found out is owned by Alessandro Borgognone, who has partnered with TRUMP to open a restaurant in his DC hotel!    He fully well made this decision AFTER Trump was elected, not before we all knew what we know now.",2,,
27,Ian D.,"New York, NY",110,24,5,5.0,12/21/2017,"This is a review of the 86'd Burger *only*. While I liked other things (e.g. music, cocktails), and the menu was very interesting, the burger was really in another category altogether.It was the best burger I have ever had. It's simple, i think 3 toppings on the patty: bone marrow, American cheese, and shallots. Yes--that's right!--American cheese! Just kidding, BONE MARROW! And all things considered, it was a great addition to the burger, which already featured two other semi-sweet/semi-savory ingredients in the Shallots and American cheese. The beef was savory and cooked exactly as ordered. One suggestion- order it Medium as the menu suggests, it's a large burger and you don't want it getting cold.For an award winning burger- definitely delivers and worth a trip.",1,1,
28,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,3/28/2017,"KenScale: 8.0/10As much as it is hard to believe today, there was once a law in the United States that banned the production and sale of alcohol. The Prohibition gave rise to courageous people who opened secret bars everywhere called ""speakeasies."" I love visiting a speakeasy in New York City because it gives off an intimate and exclusive vibe at the same time and more often than not, a speakeasy tends to offer superior cocktail selections. I've never had a chance to visit Chumley's, which opened in the Roaring Twenties until it closed in 2007 when its chimney collapsed, and once the word got out this iconic institution will be reborn finally after multiple attempts by different restaurateurs and bar keepers, I was certainly intrigued. A friend recently told me Chumley's was his all-time favorite bar before it closed and he would never go back at the risk of breaking his heart. Unlike him, though, I don't have old sentimentalities to worry about so I decided to visit with my girlfriend for an early Saturday dinner. Overall, the food at Chumley's offered a lot of satisfaction, but perhaps in a too predictable way.The kitchen led by chef Victoria Blamey, who used to cook at one of my favorite places Atera in TriBeCa, doesn't play around when it comes to the use of bold flavor. My girlfriend and I certainly were impressed by the cauliflower puree and caviar that added another dimension to the pickled oysters, making for one delicious snack. I've had a lot of beef tartare dishes everywhere in the city, but the one at Chumley's can really hold its own, with impeccable texture of raw beef that worked magically with hazelnut and confit potato for elegant but not too overpowering flavor. Yes, seasoning can get a bit aggressive with the use of butter and salt, but in Chumley's case it didn't come out as off-putting even though we ended up drinking a lot of water afterwards. I have generally tried to stay away from fried chicken in recent years, but Chumley's dish with pickled black trumpet, pearl onion an matsutake consommé was quite well executed and felt like a different species of fried chicken. For restaurants like this, I knew I had to get the burger, and it certainly didn't disappoint, with juicy tender meat combined with bone marrow and crispy shallot to create pure decadence. For dessert, we enjoyed vanilla ice cream with pistachio and crumbles that actually came out less rich than the savory dishes that preceded it, much to our relief after huge intake of calories.Getting a reservation at Chumley's can be pretty challenging with all the publicity behind the reopening of the historical venue, so I highly recommend booking in advance. I obviously can't compare the vibe of today's Chumley's to that from the past, but I did like the classic old-school New York vibe coming from the venue, with a ton of black and white photos and old posters everywhere on the wall reminiscing about the glory days of the Big Apple in the early- to mid-20th century. I would suggest going with potent cocktail selections to complement your meal instead of wine. That's the whole point of visiting a speakeasy restaurant in the first place, right? I don't know how long Chumley's 2.0 will be around this time, but I sure hope it stays on longer this time.",5,3,5

I was in awe seeing all the photos of many famous artists and writers. They even have a large photograph of one of my favorite writers, Edna St. Vincent Millay. Kudos to the new owners for bringing Chumley's back to life and preserving much of its history.As for the food:Pretzel -not chewy/dense like your typical pretzel. Light & soft, and came out warm, but only wished it was covered in more salt. The dip w/ roe was a nice addition, but would have simply preferred mustard (I'm old fashioned).Himachi crudo - Excellent; one of the better crudos in the city. Ocean trout - my fav. tonight. Prepared perfect medium rare.  Loved the hubbard pumpkin, grenada chili, and shishito pepper that came w/ the fish.86'd burger - It's on the smaller side for a burger, imo, but the bone marrow & cheese made this burger very rich, so probably the right portion. Only complaint - the fries absorbed too much oil.""Chupe"" dungeness crab pot pie - creative dish using the crab shell as the base w/ 'crab meat & innards' stew inside, topped off w/ a nice pastry crust. Nice kick from all the peppers. It's expensive though ($43), but well-worth it. You're not going to find this dish anywhere else in the city.Only two desserts offered and enjoyed both of them. If only picking one, go w/ the cherry ice cream sandwich.Don't come here expecting standard bar food; The food here is outstanding.Highest compliments to Executive chef Victoria Blamey.Many thanks to Charles for the excellent service.Highly recommend.: 9 calendars",10,2,6

The oysters did not wow me as the avocado mignonette was too subtle(prefer the oysters at Vaucluse). The ocean trout with hubbard pumpkin, chili and shisito's was spot on, but the ice-cream oh the ice cream. Now I normally skip dessert except for the exceptional- this was super star. Intense house made cherry with cherry pieces, but unlike many homemade ic sandwiches of yore- the chocolate cookie was super crisp and a perfect marriage to the super cherry ice-cream. Fun spot- don't overthink it!",28,10,21
32,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",608,466,229,4.0,1/9/2017,"Summary:  Cold at the tables near the door.  Good, but tiny plates.  Atmosphere is a bit bro-like for a place that should not be.How to find it:  It's a non-descript door before the stoop.  If you get to the actual restaurant at the corner, you've gone too far.Atmosphere:  I dig the decor.  But this place lacks all of the diversity of NYC and in a bad way.  I am surprised people said Eurotrash.  My night it was all white dudes with flannel and beards. I couldn't feel less white if I was sitting in 5pm train to Montauk on a Friday afternoon.  Staff, is classic NYC trendy though. What a weird contrast! No idea how that happened.  3 stars.The Service:  Actually the service was pretty great.  They knew the menu, knew the restaurant's cool history and were good at suggestions 5 stars. The Food: Saving grace.  Even though I was freezing and totally uncomfortable with the leering from the guys at the table next to us, I noticed the chef's strong skills.  It is a little expensive though.    Pretzel - At $12, this is not your ball game pretzel. I think it's the roe in the dipping sauce. Though the pretzel is quite well made, Really it's all about the dipping sauce. I wish there was more pretzel, but 5 stars.Fried Chicken, worth getting but it's really hard to do something others have not in this area. Still def get it 5 stars.Himachi crudo - well executed, but odd ball dish given all the rest is bar foodesque.  Fine for the price. Beets - Nice.  good for the vegetarian that was with us.Black Cod - Not bad. Vegetable Tart - Really good, and again good for vegetarians.Ice creams - Decent, home made. Worth a try, just for the speakeasy atmosphere.",8,6,5
33,Susan S.,"New York, NY",1,40,0,5.0,8/27/2018,"Burger was good but that was because we split it as the bone marrow can get very gross had we had more bites, atmosphere is special, romantic cute cozy, historic. Their drinks are unique.",,,

They have amazing photos of writers who were verified to have been there. I also have to give it up to the stag. Very attentive and friendly. Super knowledgeable about the place.Review of the 86 burger: The patty is amazing and the marrow is the cherry on top. By far one of the most decadent if not the most decadent burger I've ever had. In my top 3 I think. My only complaint is the sweetness of the Chumley sauce which tasted more like bbq sauce. It could've been the combo of the shallots that gave it the sweetness but tbh that's more personal preference. Overall it's def worth it. I would go back again.The cocktails are outstanding. My wife and I were highly impressed. Don't be afraid to venture from your usual drink. Can't wait to visit again!",1,,

I'm not saying I'm not open to these changes. I miss the old spots but I wasn't a regular at Chumley's or anything. Let's be honest, this place is full of the kind of rich, snooty, humorless people who probably complain about bone marrow and being asked to wait for anything. This is exactly the kind of crowd downtown manhattan used to be safe from, sour faced, well-coifed, republican snobs. Anyway, that's how it felt. My friends and I could feel the uptight vibe close in on us as we headed toward the bar and promptly decided to get the F out of there. Bad Mojo Chumley's. No fun here.",2,,
37,Ursula K.,"Manhattan, NY",57,55,56,4.0,3/4/2017,"Chumleys Decor and lighting similar to strip house (sans the sexy wallpaper).  Service was good. Burgers came out quickly but the initial service was a little slower. Pretzel with California dip and ikura. The pretzel was a little burnt and the dip could have been better. It had all of my favorite things but I think because of the burnt pretzel I kind of didn't feel it. Then we had the 86'd Burger. I ordered it medium rare as recommended. The chumleys sauce is amazing. It has a buttery taste and is completely absorbed into the burger. The burger meat itself is soft. It smells like the higher quality Pat La Frieda that you get at Minetta Tavern but I'm not betting my life on it. There are two patties so you feel full, and the shallots are tucked in between the two parties. The cheese may fall off before you bite into the burger so tuck it in before eating because the cheese is only around the circumference of the burger. It tastes great though. The brioche bun was properly heated. The. Burger  is a bit messy because if the awesome greasiness. I really really enjoyed this burger and will put it up there with the best of the best. The  fries were skinny, crispy, and good, with just the right amount of salt.",1,1,
38,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,4.0,11/10/2016,"I was slightly obsessed with the history behind this place, so after they reopened last month, I decided we need to come here. Reservation wasn't too hard to get, I just checked Opentable and scored a reso for two on first try.   We came in about half an hour earlier than our reservation time, but they sat us without a problem. I was very excited to try the 86 burger, along with that, we ordered beef tartare, foie gras terrine, and crispy chicken. I have to say, everything was delicious! Beef tartare was flavorful and complimented perfected with the chips. Foie Gras terrine was, foie gras, and I love foie gras. Crispy chicken was fried perfectly and came with cognac consomme. It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  Now comes the burger. I'd categorize it as a purist's burger, there's no fancy sauce, no bacon or lettuce or raw onion. It's a burger that really lets the meat shine (and bone marrow in between the two patties). The husband really loved the burger, I personally wished it had just a bit more contrast in flavors. It was almost too rich for me. With that said, we both agreed it ranked as one of the top burgers we've had. Now I know this is also a speakeasy bar, so we had to try their cocktails. With a price tag of $16 per drink, it's actually pretty average. My first drink, Mr. Easy, may be my favorite of the night, but even with that, I wouldn't say it's on par with some of other speakeasy bars we've been to. All the other drinks just tasted a bit too sweet and one note, even though the descriptions sounded good. So the verdict: I'd recommend the food here, sadly not their cocktails.",15,10,12

Updated review","I first visited Chumley's when I was in college 30 years ago...one of my college roommates, a New Yorker, knew about the place and brought me there and I was really taken with it: super cool, off-the-beaten path, good burgers, cheap. Now, I know where you are expecting this review to go....Chumley's has sold out; it has re-opened and is an upscale shadow of what it used to be...NYC has become a playground for the rich, blah, blah, blah....that is NOT what I am here to write...New York has changed, and with it, restaurants and burger joints have changed too....I understand that...I just ask you to hear my tale. What I resent about my experience at Chumley's is the super-greedy commercialization of a genuine NYC treasure.....it started with having to give my credit card to reserve a table....Ok, I get it: this is a small place, with few tables and high demand for reservations...ask people to have some skin in the game when they make a reservation...I am down with that. I got to the restaurant at exactly 6pm for my 6:00 reservation; they sat me right away, as I waited for my friend Robert to arrive. The waiter was pleasant, took my drink order and had a helpful suggestion on the kind of Bourbon I should have in my Manhattan. Then Robert arrived, sat down and we started to catch up.....I hadn't seen him since my wedding last fall and we were talking a mile a minute, which was apparent to anyone who cared to notice, except to our waiter who came over to announce the ""specials"".....which was a not so thinly-veiled way of getting us to get on with things and place our order for dinner. This was repeated two more times by the waiter, before the maitre d' came over and said, ""You know you guys want to order, let's just get this over with"" He had a smile and meant it playfully, but the cold, hard look in his eyes told you that he meant business. We ordered, dinner came and we had a perfectly fine meal....the bill for each of us came to $145, without tip, so over $300 for dinner for two....and THIS is where I have a real problem...if you are going to spend more than a hundred and fifty bucks per person for dinner in NYC, you should get the privilege of being able to have dinner at your own damn pace! Chumleys, I used to love you, but honestly, it will be a long time before I am back....and at this rate, I wonder how many people will put up with your avaricious ways....my prediction: you are out of business in less than 24 months.",8,,

Updated review","The chef recently left the restaurant,  and while we loved her,  we wanted to see what the restaurant was like with a new chef.  Now, we had been warned by a restaurant insider  ""you're going to be disappointed.""  THAT may have been an overstatement; however, after our meal, we'll think twice about coming back. The good, no, the VERY good first:  Chumley's may have the best floor staff in the business.  EVERYONE is professional, smart, polite, and will do anything they can to make your visit pleasant.  The issue, is that they can only do so much. The same is true about the bar, which still makes wickedly good drinks.  The issue is the kitchen.Chef Victoria had an ambitious menu, and she pulled it off.  The new menu is decidedly simpler, and there are issues:   BIG ones.  For firsts, we had a little gem salad, and a ""savory apple tart,"" made with apples, calvados, and sausage.  The salad was very good:  a good example of the genre.  The tart was also good, but frankly, a mess.  The crust was falling apart, and it was more like a cracker than a tart.  The chef had cooked the sausage well, so that the fat was gone, and the richness was coming from the crust.  I couldn't taste any calvados, but the whole dish was something new to me.    Big problems:  main dishes.  Now, if you're going to serve ""classics"" you better honor them. Bouillbaisse is on the menu.  This dish does not contain octopus:  the menu SAYS it does.  Nor does it contain scallops.  They're there.  It IS supposed to have fennel, or at least some anise.  I tasted none.  Usually there's some dried citrus note.  Nope.  And while the menu said there was octopus, there was none in my portion. Lots of potatoes, lots of bread, lots of garlic, and lots of scallops.  It was an ok fish soup, but at 34.00, an ""ok"" fish soup is not acceptable, nor is it ok to call it what it is not. Cassoulet: now, there are arguments about what goes into the dish, but everyone seems to agree on French white beans:  NOT cannelini  (and certainly not 'canelinni"" which is how it's spelled on the menu).  The sausage was not traditional, and not one I've heard of, the duck confit was off the bone, which is kind of insulting, and it was just ""BLAH.""  Again, ok, but for 34.00 and called ""cassoulet,"" you better deliver.  Even the burger - we didn't eat it, but we were sitting next to two tables who were eating it.   BOTH said  ""it's a good burger, but nothing to return for.""  That's not the way it was .So, where does that leave us?  If someone wanted to go, we'd take them, and we may be back in 3-4 months.  Perhaps the new chef, or the one after him, will have it down better.  For now, go for a drink,  and clear out.  There's better food to be had than you can have here.",1,,1
42,Chad H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,8/7/2018,"Burger was the best I've ever had.  The bone marrow melts into the burger patty creating an extremely juicy burger.  Great service, very nice informative waitress.  A historian stopped by and discussed the history behind the book jackets and portraits on the wall.  Awesome experience!",,,

I was with my boyfriend looking for somewhere to have dinner and we decided to see if there was a table, the boyfriend thought it was doubtful, but, hell I wanted to try anyway. Glad I did, we were able to sit at the bar with no wait. Inside was dimly lit, great for date night. The vibe is intimate and cozy. Literature is the theme, there are books and famous writers displayed. The oysters were beyond fresh and delicious, the burger, oh the burger was mind blowing. It melted in your mouth and was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The cocktails are complex and unforgettable as is the food.I dream about you Chumley's and I can't wait for another random night where we get to rendezvous.",2,1,1
47,Jim L.,"New York, NY",1,59,1,2.0,5/7/2017,"Ambiance felt like a Bucca de Beppo - dark with lots of pictures on the wall (artists and writers). Homage to the old Chumleys. I've never been to the old Chumleys but from what I know of it, this new rendition is the polar opposite. Expensive and exclusive. We asked if they had bread and butter to start and they said No, which is odd because others were offered complimentary bread and butter in their reviews/pictures. We wanted to order their famous pretzel to start but they said they no longer offer the pretzel. So first impressions not good. The food was good (ok) but super pricey. I guess they figure their old audience has accumulated some wealth by now and can afford the prices. Honestly, for these kinds of prices, your better off going to a steakhouse.",4,,
48,Leslie J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/20/2017,Worst dining experience I've had in NYC in the 30 years that I've lived here. And I didn't even eat. My party of 4 arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time. We were told we would not be able to sit until 15 mins after our reservation even though there were two empty tables. When we asked if we could sit (10 mins after said res time) we were told that they were waiting for our server to arrive so that he could take our order right when we sat down. Super weird. After inquiring again we were told it would be a few more minutes. Fed up with the whole ordeal we decided to dine elsewhere. When I got home I had an email from Chumley's saying my credit card would be charged $200 as a no show. I loved Chumley's in the '80's....it was the real deal. Now it is just sad.

When we walked in, the restaurant was half full and the hostess told us we needed to wait 2 hours for a table or a place at the bar. After waiting for 2 hours, we sat down at the bar and noticed the restaurant was still half full. The new Chumley's has a limited menu with only one vegetable option (bok choy). We ordered the burger and the duck. The burger is THE dish (and probably the only dish) worth eating; it is delicious. The burger consists of 2 patties. Warning: the burger is cooked rare, so if you want a well done burger this isn't your place. The duck tasted like ham and consisted of 2 small pieces, a rip off given the price. If you want a great burger and interesting bar scene, I'd recommend the Spotted Pig or Minetta Tavern.",2,,

58,Alexander S.,"New York, NY",5,2,0,4.0,8/8/2017,"I rated this place very good because I've heard that it is and it wasn't really their fault (I guess) but here's our story. For about a week, my pregnant wife was VERY excited about going to Chumley's and eating a burger, which is supposed to be excellent. She mentioned it everyday. About two days before, I received a phone call to confirm and to inquire about any food allergies. I told them that my wife has an allergy to mango, they say no problem. We arrived and sat down (the place is very beautiful) and again we're asked about food allergies and again we confirm her mango allergy and we tell her that she is pregnant. This time the waitress just says, that's odd, and walks away.Now time for the order: my wife orders her burger, the one she was so happy about, only to be told ""there's mango in the sauce and she won't take it out,"" presumably referring to the chef. I know my wife was on verge of tears (I can't stress enough how much she was looking forward to this - she's pregnant, we just started new stressful jobs, and we don't eat beef that much) but we ask for a moment to look at the menu again. The waitress returns and my wife has regained her composure and now confidently asks for the duck. ""Ok but she won't cook it past medium,"" says the waitress which is obviously not an appropriate poultry temperature for a pregnant woman.We told the waitress that we unfortunately couldn't stay for dinner. The waitress was understanding and recommended a place on the corner ""that's really good... and least it was when I ate there a few years ago"" and we were on our way.We ended up having burgers at Minetta Tavern, which were excellent and prepared according to our request. In the end, we had a nice evening. Chumley's seems like it's probably a great place to eat, but not if your pregnant or allergic to mango, and not if you want the food prepared anyway other than the chef's choice.

After many false starts and fights will a silly neighborhood association, it's finally back. For the most part it's completely different. Now it's more of a gastropub/restaurant operated by the Sushi Nakazawa Restaurant Group, the namesake of which is famous for employing the apprentice from Jiro Dreams Of Sushi who had to remake the omelet sushi hundreds of times. It's still unlabeled from the outside and has the speakeasy feel. Solid beer selection and reasonable beer prices for the neighborhood ($6-8 depending on size). I had the Chumley's house beer made by Six Point which was a very good light bitter beer. There are also $16 cocktails and expensive wine, which prices it out of being a neighborhood watering hole if you're not a beer drinker (or rich). But let's not forget Chumley's was pricy before the collapse too. I never thought I'd be eating steak tartare at Chumley's, but it was very good. I was seated at the bar, which only offers a choice of four appetizers and no entrees at the moment, since I walked in and it's reservation only. Perhaps it's a perfect representation of old New York, since New York's always had a ton of change.",1,,1

Updated review","What a delightful meal we just had here! Not easy to find, no sign, but it was 100% full. Service is excellent, food is outstanding. We shared the foie gras appetizer, then shared the crispy chicken and the burger, both just perfectly prepared and served. Perfect amount of food for two. Oh, and the ice cream sandwich for dessert. Also special. Great ambiance, good soundtrack, absolutely a new favorite. Have returned twice since writing this review. Last night we shared the incredible foie gras again and the fabulous crispy chicken, then the duck, a new menu item, just wonderful!!Already made our next reservation!",,,
71,Keith A.,"Wyndmoor, PA",136,3,0,5.0,12/17/2016,"15 years later... We used to frequent this speak easy in the late '90s. So many of my family and friends think fondly of this place. The decor and ambience made you feel like it never left, but it was so great to have this special place back!Four of us dined (and split a bunch of dishes - daddy strocks at the controls). Pretzel and dip were solid. Hamachi Crudo and special oyster were excellent. Fried Chicken and Beef Taratare was great. The King Salmon was okay, a little under cooked. 86'd Burger was on par with my favorites (Bistro, Burger Joint, Shake Shack) - we actually ordered a second. The crab dish was good, but recommend ordering as an app and splitting. The service was outstanding. The manager was super cool to come by for feedback. This place is legit and only going to get better as more get to enjoy! Highly recommend.",1,,

73,Tara L.,"New York, NY",5,41,3,4.0,12/6/2016,"The history and the ambiance are the main draw here.  This is where the term ""86"" came from!  And while my personal experience was sub-par, I imagine it was a one time fluke, and would go back.  The host situation at the front is a little strange- nobody was there when I first came in, and when she did come, she didn't seem to speak English that well.  The host and other staff seem to gather in the front entrance walkway and I would absolutely hate to be seated in the first corner table dealing with all the patrons coming in and trying to get seated.  Perhaps the hostess could wait on the other side of the curtain, in the main entrance with the coat closet, which makes more sense to me, and is out of the way of the seated guests, and quieter for a more seamless welcome.  The menu is small and a bit fancier than my palate likes.  Lots of seafood and mushrooms - which I understand are usually popular items.  I ordered two cold appetizers - the beets, and the green salad - as my main, and they didn't come until my friends were basically finished with their hot entrees - so that was a bit of a drag.  I bet the kitchen assumed the apps had gone out earlier, but still.  When it did come, my salad was so salty I couldn't eat it- and I am a salt LOVER.   The manager apologized, and took the salad off the bill, as well as a round of drinks for our trouble, which I thought was appropriate.  Otherwise, the The drinks were great and the oysters, burger and chicken seemed pleasing to my friends.",1,,
74,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,4.0,12/23/2016,"I had a fantastic time here and an even better meal. The burger is the only way to go. Dont think about it, dont hesitate and looking at the menu is only to decide what else you are going to get, not if you are going to get the burger.  That said, the drink menu is pretty extensive and the servers will help you navigate.  They are all very very knowledgeable and friendly as well.  Which makes for a perfect situation.  If you can get a table that is.  Try and go as early as possible if you dont have reservation, I think they might let you stand in the back. Maybe? Its worth a try and its worth the price of admission. Fantastic.",,,

I had dinner at the bar with two other friends which made it that much more special, as we interacted with the impeccable staff members and enjoyed customizing our cocktails.

77,Michael R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/14/2017,"I don't understand why this place got such a good review in the NY Times...Pete Wells, seriously? Or the good reviews here on Yelp. Why in the world would you go to this shell of a restaurant? This place is trying to very hard to be 21 Club and failing miserably.We ate here last week and still can't stop talking about it. The service was off-putting, cloying and annoying. Our server spent over five minutes talking about the specials and then immediately proceeded to ask us if we were ready to order. We asked for a few minutes to decide on the (very limited) menu and the server was back in our faces in less than a couple of minutes. She basically wouldn't leave the table until we ordered. As we were ordering someone had a question about the burger and the waitress blurted out ""I'm sorry, no substitutions"" immediately when all my friend really wanted to know is what is in the ""special"" sauce on the burger. After some mediocre, overpriced cocktails the food arrived and it was all ok - nothing that would merit the $$ they're charging for an entree. Just serviceable. All except for one of the special entrees, which was inedible, just bad...a potato pancake with morel mushrooms - it sounded good from the server's flowery description but it was basically inedible. Our thoughts on the dish were communicated to the waitress who said ""I'm sorry to hear that..."" but she did not offer to bring something else. She just vanished. After we were all done eating she came back and saw the uneaten entree and asked if she could bring something else instead - this was a good 20 minutes after we already mentioned we weren't happy with the dish. My friend obviously declined to order something else since everyone else was done eating. After that, the manager came over and asked what was wrong with the dish but offered nothing to replace it. Nothing. Appalling. $500 later (an $80 bottle of rose! small $19 cocktails!) we left hungry and unhappy.Minetta Tavern, Waverly Inn and Cafe Cluny are within walking distance and worlds apart when it comes to warmth, service, hospitality and food.",4,,

Our food was excellent, save for a vegetable starter that was pretty meh, should have ordered more pretzels instead. For entrees, the burger and the pot pie were both really delicious. Classic ambience and friendly/solid service. Unfortunately the other patrons were a bit of a nightmare. We were snug between two tables we could not ignore; one shouting about how much money they make including reading work emails aloud, the other crying and fighting(?) the whole meal. Sorry to blame the crowd on the restaurant, but it did seem to draw a less-than-chill type patron. But again, food was (mostly) really great.",1,1,
79,Judy C.,"Chicago, IL",30,40,26,4.0,11/21/2016,"My boyfriend and I dined at Chumley's last night for dinner, after making our reservation on OpenTable about a month in advance.  I'd recommend a bit of planning for now with its popularity. We were celebrating our survival of our Catskills snowstorm weekend and thrilled to be back in the city. The atmosphere was a great tribute to the old Chumley's, having preserved some of the history but a much different vibe with a gastropub feel. I don't think the old Chumley's ever served food. There are about 28 seats in the dining area, with a few more tables and seats in the bar. Service was great and our waiter made some great food recommendations. I had heard about the Hamachi Crudo and the famous 86'd burger (2 patties, cheese and lots of fries with a bone marrow kicker). We also ordered the soft pretzel with a creams fraiche dip that included some fish sauce and salmon for on-top. It was an interesting dip, albeit creamier than my liking. My dining partner is not a foie gras fan so I'll have to come back another time to try the terrine. The menu is handwritten, which is a nice touch. For our entrees, we shared the burger and also the trout, which was perfectly cooked with a side of shishito peppers. Of course, how can you go wrong with shishito peppers?!? Food and service, I'd give a solid 4.5 stars. As for cocktails, this is probably where there could be some improvement at least based on the drinks we ordered. We got the Saloonkeeper, which reminded me slightly of a cold version of a Hot Toddy and my date got the one cocktail with egg white (the name escapes me). It just seemed fine to me and his drink was honestly a bit more on the sweet side than either of us would like.That said, we would definitely go back to try it again. The food menu is inventive and changes somewhat frequently. I'd also want to give some different cocktails a chance.",,,
80,B H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1,2.0,2/27/2017,"I was excited to try Chumley's after the re-opening.  The ambiance was nice.  It's very cozy and they did a good job connecting to the history of the place.  It's not very big with a small dining room and a small bar room, but they use the space well.  My first impression was not great, however, as they are not very welcoming.  The coat check person and the hostess were civil but not friendly.  I sat at the bar as I waited for the rest of my party.  Upon sitting, the two bartenders looked at me but did not greet me.  Despite not being very busy, it still took them several minutes to acknowledge me and offer me a drink.  I ordered a Tanqueray and Tonic.  I was told they only had Tanqueray 10, which was fine, though it seemed a little unnecessarily pretentious, particularly since Tanqueray is such a staple in an NYC bar.      When I joined my party at the table the server was gratefully more personable than the bartenders.  The menu is interesting but very limited.  I had read a good review on the 86'D Burger and was eager to try it.  I ordered it rare.  One of my friends also ordered the burger, but well-done.  Another friend ordered the ""Chupe"" pot-pie.  We shared the pretzel and stracciatella as appetizers.  Both were very good, both in aesthetics and taste.  We finished them quickly, as we all liked them very much.  We probably should have savored them a bit more however, because it took an unbelievably long time to get our entrees.  At one point I asked another server to send our server over so that we could ask for an update, as it seemed the kitchen forgot about us.  She apologized and noted that she should have told us in the beginning that the pot-pie takes longer to cook than other entrees.  It seemed to us however, that there must have just been a mistake in the kitchen as other tables who arrived after us were served before us.  The server came by again to tell us that it was almost ready.  She was again apologetic, but not so apologetic to offer us a drink or anything else for our prolonged wait.  When the food came, the manager helped the server bring it out.  He was not sure which burger was rare and which was well-done.  It did not seem to matter, as we found that they were both rare when we had to cut them open to find out.  I enjoyed my burger very much (I wanted mine rare), but my friend had hoped for the well-done burger he ordered.  Given how long it took to get the food in the first place, he did not send it back.  I suspect that the manager knew the burgers were not cooked properly, and he did not check back with us. He seemed as though he didn't want to be bothered.  I tried a bite of my other friend's pot-pie.  It was delicious.  However, it was very small and hard to believe that it took so long to cook.  All in all, I would give high marks for the ambiance and the quality of the food, lower marks for the limited menu, and still lower marks for the service.  Perhaps they're still trying to work out the kinks, as they are newly opened, but they definitely have some work to do in the area of service and management.",2,,
81,Joshua Z.,"Neptune Township, NJ",71,12,0,1.0,10/10/2017,"Lovely ambiance, but I was appalled when the kitchen refused to allow my colleague to order the signature burger -- much feted by food critics -- without cheese, in keeping with Jewish kashrut tradition (no milk and meat on the same dish). The staff informed us that the chef is intractable: no modifications to the menu. (It's a burger! Really - a burger. This was like a New Yorker cartoon parodying a haughty Manhattan restaurant. We weren't asking to take the herbs de Province out of chicken provencal. Just hold the slice of American cheese.)

85,J R.,"New York, NY",1,24,0,1.0,1/7/2017,"As we walked in, two older women wearing fabulous hats on their way out groaned ""It used to be fabulous, but now it's just fancy and shitty."" They were SO RIGHT.What used to be a neighborhood gem with decades of history is now just an overpriced mockup of some hospitality group's idea of NYC. The production quality of the space is high, think Epcot West Village at Disney, but the drinks and food were seriously lackluster. It is actually eerie - tables packed with Patrick Bateman types eager to spend for show. I was skeptical when I heard about the revamp but wanted to go along with my hamburger connoisseur husband so I gave the spot a chance. We ordered four cocktails: the Urbanite, the Hand Me Harvard, the Chaplin and a Manhattan requested with a specific rye. The Urbanite and the HMH (both from their scotch and soda list) were so weak that you couldn't discern the scotch at all. The HMH was very medicinal and the main notes in the Urbanite were the grapefruit and coffee. The Chaplin and the Manhattan were a big screwup - the bartender made the Chaplin with the rye and the Manhattan with the scotch. Both gross, to say the least. Food was also a big letdown. We started with the terrine which was passable except for the thread of cabbage that ran through it. The dish wasn't well conceived, as the cabbage didn't cut along with the foie. etc. Then we both got burgers...ugh! The double patties were seriously close-textured, so dense as to suggest hockey pucks, with none of the sensuousness and delicacy of, say, a Minetta Tavern burger. All the other dressings (bone marrow, overly large slice of cheese) were not enough to hide a disappointing burger. Why mess with a double patty if you can't even get one right? Fries, well...over-salted and mostly an afterthought.I understand the hype around this place but it was such a huge disappointment. I'd say this is a tremendous loss for the neighborhood and I can't foresee the new Chumley's succeeding as an upscale bar and eatery if they can't even get a Manhattan right.",5,,

I adored the old Chumley's, its jukebox filled with Christmas tunes, the smell of the fire burning in the hearth, and the delicious cheeseburgers on English muffins. All of that has been erased in this predictable, cookie cutter reimagining of a classic. The limited menu is pretentious. Bok choy? At a speakeasy? The decor is uninspired and reminiscent of every other faux antique place in the Village. The crowd--meh. I'll say the bartender was pleasant and well versed in wine and the burger, while not as great as the old one, was pretty good.

It was pretty busy on a recent Sunday night but even so Our food took way too long to come to the table. The food we had was good but the menu is quite limited.

I've been wanting to eat here since they've reopened especially since the last time I was there was a decade ago before they closed bc the roof caved in. I had made many, many attempts to score a rez on Open Table with no luck. Options were either super early or way too late on any given evening for as far as a month out. Surprisingly I tried on a Thursday for a Friday evening rez & 8:15pm was available so I grabbed it immediately. Even more surprising was that during our entire time there, it never filled up! There were about 2-3 tables empty during our 2hr dinner. I think next time I'll just call to speak live.The restaurant is warm, cozy & intimate unlike to old dive bar that it used to be. I've read that people don't like the change but I welcomed it. It is a great upgrade & improvement. I'd be happy to come back on a date with my hubby, bring my parents, & even a 6-8 person group would be great. The space was brown leather banquette seating around the entire room with small 2 top tables with a bar & additional small tables toward the back. It is much smaller than I remembered which added to the charm & warmth. The staff was also very professional with big props to our waiter who was exceptional. The menu was very limited with only about 6 entrees & same amount of apps. I had the fried chicken & my friend had the duck. We started with foie gras & tartare.

I received a small lump of salmon with green sauce and soggy, flavorless peppers. The tab was quite high; the atmosphere loud and pretentious.

The restaurant has the old school vibe with historical pictures/portraits covering every wall. The place was very well lit which was a bit of a surprise considering the whole 'speakeasy' theme. The menu changes seasonally and the most popular item on the menu is the 86'd burger. At $25 a pop, it's a bit pricey even with 2 thick patties. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but it was definitely worth a try. Overall - I wouldn't come back again, mainly due to the value/taste of the food not justifying the price - the one time experience was all I needed.",,,
110,Lisa G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,3.0,1/21/2017,"3 stars is generous but because I am truly nostalgic about the place I am rooting for it. I spent many enjoyable nights in my 20s drinking and eating here. The new incarnation is a bit fancier but as my husband remarked, in a Disney theme restaurant sort of way. I shared the pretzel with California dip with my husband. We both thought the California dip reminded us of sour cream mixed with Lipton soup mix garnished with a few salmon roe on top. I then had the hamachi crudo- the quality was good it was over salted though and there was nothing remarkable about how it was served. I had the trout as a main course, once again very over salted , the fish was good quality but surprisingly the skin was not crispy. My husband had the steak special- he felt the quality was ""good"" and the fries were over salted. The wine list for wine by the glass was short and expensive. The cost of my glass of Gamay matched the cost of a bottle when I looked it up on line for a review.       My review takes an odd turn here. The manager asked how the food was, we told him good but too salty. (As a side note when my husband's food arrived before tasting he asked for salt and ketchup which he never used. ) The chef came over to our table after my husband's comment to the maitre'd and said "" I understand you think the food is too salty"" she then accused him of asking for salt which he had to explain to her that he did not ask for until after the food arrived but never used and then the encounter got way more bizarre and I think at this point of the review I am now only rooting for the next owner to succeed because I don't see this working.",1,2,
111,Charles J.,"Elkton, MD",685,8,0,1.0,12/11/2016,"I came here on a recent Saturday night bc I read all these other reviews. But what all these reviews neglect to mention is that without a reservation ( no one answers the phone and the VM is ALWAYS full!), this is the most inhospitable & unfriendliest place around. And this is the saddest irony bc the original Chumley's whose name the current iteration undeservedly co-opted, was just the opposite. The waits are egregious but worse yet there is no where to wait except like paupers and outcast in the tiny vestibule never mind it was sub freezing temps. But why you say when they have such a nice sized vintage bar?? Because the management in their infinite wisdom deemed it unseemly for their patrons to stand at the bar. I know, why would anyone stand at a bar?? Um, duh this is ridiculous; its the very definition of a bar. That's why there is the footrails in real bars geniuses that own Chumleys. Stay away until someone here learns what hospitality means. RIP original Chumleys.",3,,

114,Kelsi K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,4/5/2017,"I heard about the burger at Chumleys and texted my friends who were all eager to join. We tried to make a reservation online for 5 and were told the restaurant only accepts tables of 4 or less. I can understand this as the place is fairly small, so it's not good for groups. Therefore we booked a table for four. When a few of us arrived we were seated without our whole party being there which was very nice. We perused the drink menu and most of the cocktails are cheaper than the wine which is a first for me. We sampled a few different cocktails, they were very well balanced and had great flavor profiles. We wanted to order an appetizer while we waited for the 4th member of our party to arrive and were told that we could only place our food order at one time and had to wait.     We were all very excited about getting the Chumley Burger, but were instantly disappointed that there's a note on the menu saying they decline to make substitutions. This started to annoy me. If you're in the hospitality industry then please cater to your customers simple substitutions, especially if there are food allergies and intolerances. The staff was extremely attentive and on the ball the rest of our meal so I felt this was off putting. The menu doesn't state that there's cheese on the burger so when my friend saw the table next to us get one she questioned the waiter. We were told that no she couldn't get the burger without cheese. Our waiter than asked if there were any food concerns at our table, to which my friend said cheese. I also said garlic and onions, to which I was told they were basically in most things on the menu. I then asked if I could just take the crispy shallots off  the burger myself (because I cannot eat them) and the waiter said yes, that they were not mixed into the meat, but rather placed on top. When my burger arrived I took the shallots off, only to find that they were mixed with the bone marrow, so sadly I lost all of that too. The simple solution to this would just be to let customers ask for no cheese or no shallots. I was a bit disappointed to order a $25 burger and not be able to get it without a topping and to lose all of the bone marrow. The burger was still good without it but it could have been so much better.   All in all the place was very unique inside and definitely had a speakeasy feel. The other food we ate was great and the service was amazing. But I was unhappy with all the rules this restaurant had and this is the only time I've ever spent writing a review on a New York City restaurant.",,,

We arrived at 5:45 on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, 15 minutes after the doors opened. Apparently the wait to get to the bar was 40 minutes. The dining room was empty but reservations were required... and none were offered. Nothing welcomimg here, a total turn off.

Yes, I was at the old place and it was great, a lot cheaper and had an easy going atmosphere. This is several notches more upscale. The waitstaff was as nice as could be when I went last week with my Dad, a writer, to celebrate his 80th birthday. He used to frequent the place starting in 1946 dragged there by his father, Charles Samuels (my namesake) who had one of his book cover's hung on the wall of the old place. I had the Ocean Trout which was about the best fish dish I've had in my life. The oysters as an appetizer were as good as it gets and whatever they put on top was to die for. The desserts -- both ice creams were incredible and different. And they had a very impressive list of beers on tap, with free tastings served in unique long stemmed glasses. Our waiter was super nice and attentive. The restaurant ""Historian"" asked my Pop all about his experiences there as a kid - the period before the beat generation hung there. Atmosphere was lively and approached but was not stuffy at all due to the great waitstaff who seemed to go out of their way to make everyone welcome. The old place collapsed, this is the new thing with a lot of respect for the history.",,,

We had stopped in for drinks and (two) pretzels right after they opened and let me just say that their pretzel may be the best thing I've literally ever had. Like ever! Seriously it's a work of art. Served with ""california dip"" which is onion dip but with trout roe and seaweed and other good stuff. Freaking stellar! And I don't really like pretzels. All of the cocktails are beautifully crafted and so amazing. Jordan is the best bartender in the world, for real. The service in general was really perfect. We had 2 kinds of oysters, pickled with caviar and also some that had some sort of banana/avocado purée on them. Both were fabulous! The foie gras rillette was amazing, the hamachi was KILLER. We had the burger and duck as our entrees and they both were amazing. The burger gets all over you but that's thanks to the bone marrow patty in the middle of the burgers. Seriously amazing.

It just looks like an apartment or something. Didn't get any food so can't comment on that. The pints were pricey at $6 or so a piece.We got a booth near the back. They have very thick oak tables that have been carved on for years with initials and other messages. A waitress never really came around so I just ordered from the bar. In the back area there were a lot of pretentious artist types with berets and the like, folks that can well afford the pricey pints.The bar seemed to be more construction workers or something and they were all downing double shots of vodka. Like a lot of the other places in NYC that we went, it's refreshing to see people from all walks of life drinking, eating and living together.The beer selection and atmosphere are good, but this place is really about history and creativity.

The secret entrance in the Barrow Street courtyard (originally 5 horse stables) is a glimmer of what is to come.  It looks like you are on your way to visit a friend since there is no indication in the courtyard that an eating and drinking location is nearby.For those with a sense of NY History.   Step inside and be transported back to the roaring 20's and the days of prohibition.  Chumleys was a speakeasy in its day (I really wish they would ask for a password on the way in).  Step in and look at the decor.  Note the trap door on the floor of the bar which was used to smuggle in the liquor from the boats on the river.  Find the secret bookcase exit in the dining room which was used to escape when the prohibition raids came (Admit it...you will sit there dying for someone to yell Raid so you could fly out the secret entrance into the alley).For the highbrow and/or literary type....Chumleys was the writers hangout in the 20s and 30's.  Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald had their private table in the corner of the dining room.  The walls are lined with many of the original book jackets of the great 20th century writers, many of whom spent their time in Chumleys.  Covers from Steinbeck, Trumbo, Hemingway, among many many others, hang on the wall.  Pictures of the greats from the day, including Orson Welles, Ring Lardner, William Faulkner also line the place.   It is a tribute to every great piece of 20th Century American literature that we all read in high school and college.For the food and beer.  Brews made especially for them are diverse and satisfying.  The food is very good pub fare.  Excellent shepards pie and I really enjoyed the fish and chips.  But there is nothing like having a beer or two and picturing yourself back in the roaring 20s, checking out F. Scott in the corner or chatting with John Steinbeck about what the Red Pony really meant!And if you are really lucky, you may get to see the house dogs lounging around (not a site in too many places in NY)",6,2,4

I docked a star cause the cider that I ordered from the bar sucked.Would definitely go again though... if I could find it.",,,
147,Mike W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,4,5.0,8/4/2007,"RIP - Chumley'sI hope it isn't forever, but I heard there are some huge structural problems and it may never reopen.Loved the burgers on the english muffin.",,,
148,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",100,2100,2099,4.0,8/25/2005,"F. Scott Fitzgerald allegedly wrote part of ""The Great Gatsby"" in this New York City institution, a former Greenwich Village speakeasy opened in 1922, which to this day has no name at the entrance, so remember the address or you'll never find it. The wooden floor is covered with sawdust and there's a friendly resident black lab that regularly makes the rounds, greeting the overflowing crowd of mostly boisterous frat boys and their unhappy dates, who were hoping to be taken someplace slightly more romantic. Avoid ordering anything more ambitious than a burger and fries or a salad and you won't be disappointed.",4,,4
149,Jessie J.,"Memphis, TN",319,350,85,5.0,12/14/2007,"this is the first bar i ever went to with my dad.this is the kind of bar you could take your dad to.this is also the kind of bar you could get into some trouble at, well if you wanted. :-)",2,2,2
150,Leila T.,"Bethesda, MD",51,253,24,4.0,8/28/2007,"Where the term ""86"" originated (86 Bedford St.).... an old speakeasy from the prohibition days. Divey, relaxed atmosphere...I'd like to go back...if I could ever find it again.",3,,
151,Billy A.,"Toronto, Canada",210,411,37,5.0,7/22/2006,"I know I'll never find this hidden place again, but damn, I want to. Perfect no-attitude place to grab a pint and a shepherd's pie. The wait isn't bad, and they'll gladly help you at the bar while you wait. The prohibition-era literary history angle makes it a must-visit for any admirer of wit and independent thought.",1,,1
152,Amy L.,"Alameda, CA",449,141,15,3.0,2/5/2007,"Warm and cozy place; fireplace, book jackets by famous authors/patrons on walls, dim lighting, closely spaced tables.  Food is passable (burgers were fine; interesting beers on tap).  Non-descript front door, so you feel like you've stumbled across some great find -- until you realize there's an hour wait for a table (which has happened during 75% of my visits here).  Bottom line: good place for some atmo during off-peak dining hours.",1,,1
153,W G.,"Dot Lake, AK",8,143,25,3.0,6/20/2006,"finally a spot on the stealth tip that doesn't have attitude(see: Esquina).  chumley's is like a neighborhood bar with a not-so-precise dildo deflector.  the genie is out of the bottle and it gets a good share of people that you wouldn't want to see there.  oh well, a decent experience but nothing to write home about.  the food is mediocre and you can drink beer at home.  go for the nostalgia and the loose women(woman??). JCTSFR: 0.91 p.s. there are two doorways marked '86' bedford.  i'll let you figure out which option to choose.",1,,1
154,Katie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",404,8,1,5.0,2/8/2007,"Mix speakeasy vibe with literary history, decorate with book jackets, roaring fireplace, and NYFD stained glass work, serve homemade beers on tap (my favorite is the Bulldog Bitter) and yummy ribs and I've found myself a home.  A personal must for taking outta-towners -- just be sure to avoid weekends and big weekday evenings, often taken over by fratty meatheads.  But on an off-hour...heaven.",1,,1
155,Daniel H.,"New York, NY",4,153,30,5.0,10/15/2006,Nice out of the way bar away from the chaos that is Bleeker Street.  I recommend this for people who are just looking to relax and engage in some conversation with some friends.,1,,1
156,Jo G.,"Telluride, CO",85,322,56,5.0,3/21/2007,"So laid back, low key and easy-going, it's a genuine pub atmosphere.  The front door is pretty much hidden, there's no sign or anything out front.  I initially thought I was trespassing into someone's home when I opened the door.  Great atmosphere and good food.",1,,1
157,Melanie C.,"Spring Lake, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,9/22/2009,We're trying hard to open again this Spring. If you want to know our updates you can join us as a fan on our facebook account.Thanks to all for staying interested! We're trying hard to restore it to all of your memories!,,,
158,Chris L.,"New York, NY",96,276,9,3.0,1/31/2006,"If you can get over the sour smell of stale beer by the bar (not sure why it smells that way since i'm sure the beer isn't old...) - this is a fun place to hang out and grab a couple beers with friends. a better bar than restaurant, but the english muffin burger's are not bad (a little soggy but the meat is good) - have been to many bday celebrations there and have had the occassional star sightings (Mike Meyers and Jason Biggs) as well... fun place - if you can find it. It's on Bedford street behind a door with no sign :)",1,,
159,Joe O.,"Remsenburg-Speonk, NY",125,508,40,4.0,3/5/2007,"fun place, great beer selection and the burger was phenomenal!",,,
160,Rich S.,"Washington, DC",23,143,3,4.0,1/5/2006,Novel enough. Good luck getting a table to eat at but swing by and enjoy a beer and the atmosphere...if you can find it building.,,,
161,Diane R.,"Kentfield, CA",41,143,13,5.0,1/28/2005,This is such a cool/divey place.  It is a former speakeasy and it doesn't have a sign over the door.,,,
162,Christina S.,"New York, NY",56,288,0,5.0,5/31/2005,"An old NY speakeasy - this is where they came up with the term ""86"" it.  Cool atmosphere, although it gets packed with preppy finance guys on the weekends.  I love it because I live right next door.",,,
163,Jon C.,"San Francisco, CA",19,103,29,4.0,8/21/2005,"this place is about good beer, cool ambiance, and decent bar food. What sells this place is the history and the feeling you get when you are there. But that is what makes a bar, because all bars serve the same stuff. Be careful you just might walk right by the front door and never notice this place. I love it there",,,
164,alicia v.,"Hauppauge, NY",25,224,9,4.0,10/12/2005,"This place has a nice atmosphere and is great if you want to get away from all the really modernly decorated bars around. There's really an old fashioned feel to it. It has basically the same beer and food as any other bar in the city, but it's still a fun place to come. Also, there's no sign or anything outside so make sure you don't pass right by this hidden treasure!",,,
165,Marlon L.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",217,43,1,4.0,7/21/2007,"This is a cool hidden bar.  The story behind it is pretty wild as well.  Good beers, cool pictures of famous people that have had a drink there.  I would give it a 5 star rating except the time I went there was a bad stench around the whole place.  It kind of smelled like sweaty gym x 10.  But I got over it once I had a couple of drinks.  I'd definitely hang out there for drinks if I lived in the neighborhood.",,,
166,Tim M.,"New York, NY",49,37,40,5.0,9/16/2006,"what a cool place! ended up here last night around last call and the staff was completely cool about us getting a few drinks in even though they were ready to close up shop. i challenge you to find me a bar in all the city with as much character as this place has. almost impossible to spot if you don't have the address, but for those in the know your reward for finding chumley's is great beer and an equally amazing atmosphere. i recommend the pumpkin ale.",1,,1
167,Lori M.,"New York, NY",0,180,0,4.0,3/27/2006,"I love this causual place.  can't speak much for the food, but it's an awesome spot to hang out with a group of friends who just want to feel like they are at somone's home without being confined to an apartment.  The owner's dogs walking around and the cozy fireplace just make it feel like home.",1,,
