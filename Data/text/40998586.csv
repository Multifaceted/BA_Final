0,Cheryl N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",190,192,18404,5.0,8/9/2018,"I think people who rated 1 or 2 stars are trump haters, I just visited Trump tower today n was very impressed, I know it was a lie/fake review when they complained about the bathrooms, they were spotless, you could eat off the marbled floor. I was impressed as to how efficient the Tsa type check was, all the cops were very polite n friendly, in fact I had a picture taken w one if them, I'll upload it when I get home.The ice cream  was very reasonably ogives $4 per scoop. The heavy security was intimidating n I wondered whether that was the reason it was not more crowded.I wanted to eat at the pizzeria but it was closed, we were lucky the happy hour started st 5pm n cocktails were only $7!! Whoohoo! I had a tequila sunrise, it was a huge drink  where else can you get a drink this cheap? Most restaurants in the area charged $18, $19 got a cocktail .The souvenir stores were amazing, everything was just elegant like in an European royal palace.A yelper even said he saw cockroaches, shame on the idiot it was a beautiful place throughout.",3,1,1
1,Walter H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",30,59,6829,3.0,8/9/2018,Drinks only!Bummer!Serve drinks should serve food!Service ok!Nice experience!Wife did not like tequila sunrise ! Great,,,
2,Jose R.,"Miami, FL",0,44,1,4.0,6/29/2018,"I have always wanted to sit down and have a cocktail at Trump Tower and on my 50th birthday, mission complete! Luca, our bartender was incredibly sweet and made our first experience a memorable one.The location is well kept and still a beautiful place to visit as well as dine. I would totally recommend stopping by as part of your walk through 5th ave.",,,
3,Kelly B.,"Canton, MI",60,190,91,2.0,1/2/2018,"The holiday décor inside the tower was great, but the bar itself is very small and dark, lighting mostly coming from the center atrium. Drinks were ok, nothing special. I had asked for a champagne cocktail, which apparently they did not know how to/could not make, so I had to settle for a Kir Royale, meh.It's definitely a stop in to see when in NYC, but I wouldn't feel the need to frequent.",4,,
4,Bo H.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,76,4,1.0,7/18/2018,A complete waste of time and money. An awful set of toxic cocktails strong enough to leave the entire nation in a hangover from which it may never recover. A martini couldn't have been made with less class. A fine place for nouveau riche brats who don't know the difference between sweet and dry vermouth.,3,3,
5,Christine A.,"Seattle, WA",57,43,77,3.0,3/6/2017,"Well we weren't going to leave New York without visiting The Trump Tower!! And while we're at it, why don't we also sip on manhattans at the Trump Bar? If you're down, I'm down. Gets bill: $20 (each) Manhattans?! ...well it sure did taste good and that was a good experience lollll By the way, when you first walk by The Trump Tower, it is intimidating at first because there are police officers holding rifles guarding the doors...but you are allowed to go in and take a look inside. If you're ever in NY, I would suggest visiting!",2,,2
6,Mike O.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,31,4,1.0,6/26/2018,"Weak, overpriced drinks. Pretty sure the bartender waters down the booze. Spotted a bunch of cockroaches crawling around the place.",1,1,
7,Jeff C.,"Alexandria, VA",449,930,973,5.0,2/12/2017,"So Yelp says that this bar is closed. Lol that is Fake News. I popped in here the other day, and the bar was certainly open for business. The TVs were rocking some sports, and the bartenders were slinging some me drinks. The bar had a cozy feel to it, and I actually prefer it to the rest of Trump Tower. And staff was very friendly, offering suggestions on things to do and places to see within the city. I asked a waitress if she had ever met President Trump, and she said that she had. She also said that this was the best job that she had ever had. Of course, I was at first skeptical if she was just saying that, but I detected no sign of Manchuria Candidate brainwashing, so I have to believe she was speaking the gospel.Another thing I enjoyed was that the bar was loaded with people of all walks of life, and they seemed happy to be drinking at Trump's Bar. I'm sure many of them were hoping to catch a glimpse of the Donald, but personally, I was holding out for Melania. All and all, this is an enjoyable pub with a comfortable atmosphere.",3,3,3
8,Scottie M.,"Providence, RI",289,342,1057,5.0,4/16/2017,Fantastic cocktails and a great atmosphere!After walking by security and the cascading waterfalls we were greeted by the friendly bar staff and were seated on a comfy sofa.  We had a great time enjoy the 5th Ave cosmos and intimate seating areas.  Can't wait to go back!,,,
9,Steve T.,"Short Hills, NJ",41,114,5,5.0,11/16/2017,Great cocktails and bar food - can't go wrong here! Highly recommend. Be sure to Ask for Trump!,2,,
10,Charles T.,"Atlanta, GA",0,62,74,5.0,3/25/2017,Fanstastic bar with a nice atmosphere.  Good service.  Expensive but you go for the experience.  Big screens are easy to see and the crowd is upbeat and friendly. Security screening upon entering the building is easy and they are nice guys.,,,
11,Anngi T.,"Sterling, VA",3,104,57,5.0,10/3/2016,"I happen to be walking around NY and there was Trump Tower (SO TALLLLL) and I had to go in just to say I had.  There wasn't too much on this level (I thought there were lots of shops etc.).  Anyway, what I did see was Trump Bar.  Simple, right?  Of course I had to go in and have a beer.  Had an IPA I've never heard of and it was good.  Pretty small bar but there was more regular seating, I didn't go into the main restaurant.  I guess I give 5 stars to anyplace that gives me a beer with no issues LOL.",2,,
12,Don H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",19,69,16,5.0,6/23/2016,Drinks at the Trump Bar is fun. Staff is great and attentive and make you feel welcome while you are sitting at the bar.Order a glass of Trump label wines while you are there.,3,,2
13,Mike B.,"Manteca, CA",0,10,13,5.0,5/30/2016,What can I say about Trump Bar. We had a fabulous time and the drinks were fantastic. They do need more help. The bar tender was swamped being the only one for Happy Hour. Boy was she cranking the drinks out. Awesome atmosphere. I will be back.,4,,
14,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,3.0,7/13/2014,"Small yet intimate, dark yet classy, this bar with leather couches, ottomans and tables is a great place to grab a drink if you're in the Trump Tower. Today, the World Cup was playing on the flat screen TVs, which held the attention of everyone, including the servers. But we were able to order drinks and an order of fries. The fries were crispy and warm. A generous bowl, enough for two people to share, was only $5. A Campari and soda was $12 but they also offered World Cup drink specials so my bottle of Bud Light was only $4. A bargain.They included the tip on the bill, which is totally OK by me. Just be aware that they do. This is a great bar to grab a drink alone and not feel lonely. But they don't offer a whole heck of a lot of food or drink options, which is OK!",2,,
15,Pamela A.,"Summit, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,12/16/2016,Went just for the name and the spectacle and OMG the service was horrendous and the drinks were so overpriced and mediocre it was ridiculous.The decor is beyond tacky. Save your money and go elsewhere.  There are so many better choices in this neighborhood.,4,1,1
16,Ronald D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/26/2016,"Unbelievably overpriced. The bars in the neighborhood sell the same exact cocktails for less than half the price! The bartender was obnoxious and rude, and the decor is so tacky. Such a sad place. I will not come back. Tourist trap.",8,2,2
17,Nancy W.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,0,4.0,9/8/2017,Just wandered into Trump Tower on a lark. My friend and I are on our first trip to NYC from sunny California. Sat at the bar and were treated wonderfully by the 2 sweet and delightful bartenders. Wine wasn't overpriced by NY standards. Would've given a 5 star rating if not for the tattered bar stools.,1,,
18,Conan C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,1.0,12/17/2016,Security makes it miserable experience. Expensive and tacky. Our party only stayed 5 minutes and left after we received rude service.,3,1,1
19,Cole S.,"Stroudsburg, PA",0,59,13,1.0,12/7/2016,"Omg...came in for a quick drink to be at Trump bar because we support Trumpy. And the bartender(Ashley) asked me   ""what do you want"" . Just so rude. I asked if they had a wine list. Eye roll. Soooo we got one to celebrate the election and the F out of dodge. Won't be back. Service certainly ruined it for us BUT prices were cheap for such a pretty place .",3,1,1
20,Daniel C.,"Delray Beach, FL",182,9,1,1.0,12/17/2016,For $12 a drink I'd expect the cocktails to taste a little better than barn yard wedding.,2,2,1
21,Rick A.,"Miami, FL",51,261,853,5.0,3/10/2016,"What can I say about this bar when I adore everything with a Trump signature. I see legit American ingenuity and prosperity everywhere. Right on fifth avenue, it's my favorite bar. They simply don't miss anything",2,,
22,John M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,5.0,7/3/2016,"Trump Bar is one of the great bars in the world. I don't drink alcohol, but I know how to have a good time, and I always have one at Trump Bar. For those who do drink alcohol, my friends say that the cocktails are terrific. I really like the gorgeous pink marble used here -- it makes people look great, believe me. This is also a great location for an interview, with the beautiful escalators and water falls in the background. If you ever get the chance to give one here, don't turn it down.",2,7,
23,Bonnie C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,1,1.0,2/25/2016,"We ordered a couple Billionaire Martinis and a Winter in Manhattan during happy hour.  Only when we received the check were we told that the drinks we ordered were excluded from happy hour pricing.  When we questioned the pricing, the bartender told us he would give us a ""discount"", which turned out to be just the removal of the built-in gratuity. And yes, we were charged with a built-in gratuity for a 3-person party. I guess that is the Trump bar standard. If I can give 0 stars I would.",7,1,3
24,Don W.,"Las Vegas, NV",119,128,2,5.0,11/4/2016,"Sure it's pricey, but how many bars can anyone from the public enter that are owned by  a presidential candidate? The Bronx Ale was potent! The service was terrific, and the environment, though small, is elegant. Five Stars!!",,,
25,N. S.,"Argyle, TX",0,40,2,4.0,3/7/2017,"The Trump Bar is NOT CLOSED, as stated on Yelp. We visited in March 2017 on a weekday at happy hour and it was a nice experience in an elegant but unpretentious setting.  There was no line at security and the agents were very nice.  We would gladly return.",,,
26,Roxanne B.,"Cupertino, CA",0,8,0,1.0,12/16/2016,Stopped off at the bar after visiting the Tower lobby. The bar was just as tacky and the drinks were overpriced. I would recommend going someplace else.,2,1,1
27,Brian C.,"Sanibel Island, FL",2,27,45,5.0,8/9/2015,"Looking for a place to get a drink?  You absolutely can't go wrong here!  As pretentious as some people may think anything Trump is, you will quickly see that is not the case here.  First, the trump tower is a residence for the wealthy.  Trump makes this his home when he is in New York (he occupies the top three floors).  Second, in case you were wondering where trump does all of his on camera interviews from, he sits in the bar on a stool in the corner.  The staff here are not just great, they are down to earth and funny.  You never know what's going to happen here.  I highly recommend this little treasure.",4,,
28,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,4.0,4/29/2015,"Even though I live here I still like coming to this bar as it's very classy and swank.  Don't see the Don making as many appearances as he had in the past, but still a fun place to grab a drink with a friend.",2,,
29,Sen-Pei H.,"New York, NY",317,421,316,4.0,1/5/2015,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time here, surprisingly. It's touristy and plays cheesy pop music that makes me want to blow my brains out by the amount of bubble gum pop that I heard. However, i ordered a great Malbec and when I heard that the kitchen was closed, they gave me a bunch of free pretzels on the house... you also can't beat the happy hour.",2,1,
30,Sam O.,"Salem, NH",14,127,12,3.0,2/9/2014,"Not a bad bar! I'd been in the building before to go to the Starbucks and stopped by for some of the drink specials. They had 5$ drafts of two really good microbrews (can't remember what they are now). I felt a little out of place, not being a business man, but it wasn't very crowded. Their credit card machine was broken the day that I went but I'm sure they've fixed it by now.",2,1,1
31,Carlos M.,"OZONE PARK, NY",45,52,4,5.0,3/16/2014,Perfect place to have a business meeting and for networking. The happy hour is great for a bar on Fifth Avenue and other than that the regulars in this bar are amazing!,,,
