1,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1372,384,370,4.0,10/31/2018,"You can always count on a good meal at Westville X. I say ""X"" because, if you didn't already know, Westville is a small local chain with locations in Chelsea, FiDi, East Village, Hudson Square, Dumbo, and the West Village (duh).If you eat out a lot in New York City, you know it can be tough to get your veggies in. When we feel this way, we know a cure is to be found at Westville. Whether for brunch, lunch, or dinner, our favorite thing to order here is a plate or two, or three, of 4 market sides to split with the whole table. We've had just about every fresh veggie on that list, and the seasonal rotations are great too. I am not a die-hard vegetarian or vegan or anything like that, but these veggies are just _that_ good.When we are looking for something else on top of the veggies, you can't go wrong with their Mac & Cheese or Burgers, but seriously, get some market sides too.Only downside is that the prices, while not super high, are not super low either.",3,1,2

5,Chris P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",378,97,45,4.0,9/18/2018,"The quintessential DUMBO food venue: it's bougie, it's healthy, it's pretty, it has outdoor seating. Not that these are all good things, that's just how it is.*** FOOD ***Pretty good for the price. I'd say the healthier options are more worth it. After all, you should order what they do best. And at Westville, that's the market veggies. The beets and fresh peas and bacon were my favorites.*** DRINKS ***Great selection of refreshing beers and cocktails for the summer and I'm sure they'll transition to a similarly good spread for the fall/winter.*** SERVICE ***Can REALLY be hit or miss. Some of the staff are extremely nice and attentive and quick while others can be curt or *very* slow.*** AMBIANCE ***Get a spot outdoors on the patio while you can.",2,,

7,Victoria Q.,"New York, NY",1383,138,592,4.0,8/21/2018,This is the go-to spot for work lunches. Interior and ambiance is on point. There's a great patio and outdoor seating area. Everything is extremely fresh and cooked right. I haven't had anything mind blowing but I've also never had anything terrible. Considering the fact that choices in Dumbo are limited unless you want to fork over $40+ for lunch ...Westville is a solid choice at around $15.,1,,1

9,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,3.0,9/24/2018,"Things I really enjoyed at Westville:- Most of my meal: I loved that there were so many interesting veggie options and I had a hard time choosing my four items for the market plate. I went with the fried plantains, the Brussels sprouts, the soy long beans, and the mixed mushrooms and all were pretty good. I also had the mango lemonade which tasted nothing like mango, but it was still a pretty tasty lemonade. - The outdoor seating: it was a perfect evening to dine al fresco, and it was a peaceful patio away from the touristy hustle and bustle of the rest of Dumbo. What bugged about Westville:- The lady they had greeting people at the front on a recent Saturday night. I walked in with a smile and a 'hi,' and without making eye contact she snapped 'you can talk to her,' gesturing to a (much nicer) lady standing behind her with an ipad. Then after we checked in with the nicer lady, the mean lady had the awful job of having to show us to our table. There's a glassed-in area that leads to the outdoor patio, and she made a vague gesture from inside to one corner of the patio saying 'you can sit there.' I asked her where she was talking about specifically since she was so far away as to not be helpful at all, but she made the same general gesture, so we just headed to the empty table that was in the vicinity of her rude hand gesture, then she yelled at us from her spot that we were in the wrong place. Ugh! Just an unpleasant way to start the meal. - Though we made a reservation online and came right on time, I got a scoldy email that night saying that we never showed up for our reservation. I responded via Open Table that we had in fact showed up, but all in all the host situation is not on top of their stuff at all, which is really unfortunate for a place that seems to get so busy. So though it was a nice enough meal and there are other items on the menu that I'm eager to try, I'm not so eager to go back to this specific location.",11,2,4
10,Charles B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,223,42,4.0,7/29/2018,"What a nice place!  Inside, outside and outside covered dining options here. Deliciously fresh and mostly healthy menu AND they still know how to dish up a tasty spicy margarita and buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with avocado, arugula and chipotle mayo on a Portuguese muffin. My girlfriend decided to make her own market bowl consisting of four vegetables - cauliflower with tahini, artichokes with parmesan, zucchini with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella, and brusells sprouts with honey dijon.  It was quite difficult for her to choose a favorite when I interrogated her for purposes of writing this review, so then I had to sample the array and I completely understood her dilemma.  I would say all were great and that you wouldn't go wrong with placing the very same order.Service was very polite, mostly efficient, and made us very comfortable in the enclosed, but semi-outdoor seating area.  Next time, weather accommodating, we will sit in the fully outside seating area.",,,
11,Lisa Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",108,393,2034,5.0,2/7/2018,"Westville, I am low-key obsessed with you. You tease me with your too-hard-to-pass-up-on happy hour menu (not to mention the generous 4-8pm HH time frame). You're humble with your cocktails but damn, your 'BERRY ROADS' is off the chizainnns good; that raspberry purée really hit the spot with the ginger beer. Your 'TRUFFLE FRIES' are legit truffle fume bomb and for that, I'm eternally grateful (you guys, they don't skimp on the truffle so it's the real deal). Hanger steaks are usually a faux pas for me but you had me swooning over your 'SWEET CHILI RICE BOWL WITH HANGER STEAK'; super filling, sweet and non-tough steak.Great staff.

12,Sara W.,"Danbury, CT",254,35,43,4.0,6/29/2018,"Delicious and good atmosphere. They have indoor and outdoor seating. As it was a nice day, most of the outdoor seating was already gone, so we opted for inside. Got some eggs benedicts, and you could get it with mixed greens or potatoes, but they never asked. I didn't realize until I got my order and had the greens with it, was kinda craving the potatoes, but decided to just keep it! The Benedict's were on like hash brown potatoes already instead of classic English muffins, and I enjoyed the hash brown potatoes. Food was tasty. The St Germain pitcher of mimosa was not well mixed at all though as the top was quite bubbly and the bottom was very OJ. They could've done better on that.",1,,2
13,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,1273,1201,5.0,6/19/2018,"I came here on my lunch break specifically to try their famous Mac and cheese but saw the grilled kale polenta and knew I must try that as well.                                  The really great thing about Westville is that you can order online for delivery or pick up if you don't have time to sit and eat at the actual restaurant, which I did not today. I placed my order for pick up online and popped on the subway and it was ready when I arrived. The interior of the restaurant is lovely: kind of beachy and has a California vibe that is light and airy. They also have an outdoor area to sit and eat as well. I came around 12:25PM and it was pretty packed.My food was waiting for me when I arrived and was already paid for online. You have the option of paying cash when you get there if you'd like as well. The Mac and cheese was divine: so rich and creamy with a crispy ness on top from being in the oven. I loved the cheeses used. It just had such great flavor. The polenta was excellent. The kale was married perfectly inside the grilled polenta which had a kind of nice Smokey flavor from being grilled and was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This was an excellent meal and the portion sizes were large so I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! I'm stoked!",,,
14,Lee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,1,1.0,11/6/2018,"Not happy at all. Ordered delivery, it came late. Now this was not my issue. I ordered thru postmates so that's not really the restaurants fault. HOWEVER, the food was not good! It was not the warmest because of the tardiness, but it was not good at all! I ordered a turkey burger that came as a blob of meat and I guess asking for avocado literally means put an entire, uncut avocado on a sandwich. Fries were dismal. Utterly disappointed and still hungry. I use Yelp a lot and really read the reviews and I wish that I had seen a review like this in regards to delivery. if you must, go in to the restaurant yourself and skip the delivery.",,,
15,Krystal V.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",197,195,154,5.0,5/7/2018,"My two friends and I wanted a light lunch and this place was perfect. It's in a convenient location in DUMBO and there are many tables inside and out. We got to sit at the covered patio (there's also an uncovered patio) and it was lovely! We decided to share the market plate (4 items) plus one a la carte.. We chose the asparagus (with parmesan), mushrooms, sweet potato fries, Ientil hot dish, and cauliflower covered in tahini (as the a la carte).. Everything was delicious and you can tell the quality is fresh and the ingredients are good. We felt healthy after a lot of NYC foodie adventures so it was a great way to reset. The market plate is $17 (4 smaller portions) whereas a la carte is $7 (larger portion of one item).",4,2,5

He got the chicken with two veggies (Brussels sprouts and asparagus) and I got the salmon with two veggies (zucchini and sweet potato mash...they were tragically out of eggplant, the only downer). The meats were yummy, but the vegetables were truly the best I've had at any restaurant and the star of the show. Perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious sauces. I'm still dreaming about my zucchini. We left full and super satisfied, but not bloated. Service wasn't super attentive, but that was understandable since they seemed busy on a Sat night, but we still tipped generously because the food was just so amazing. I will be back!!",,,

18,John B.,"New York, NY",774,374,653,3.0,5/9/2018,Honestly I am a big fan of Westville Chelsea but today's lunch was very average at the Dumbo location Staff suggested the chicken bean salad as the special of the day but it was everything from special.  In fact it was so boring and bland I could only eat half. The cucumber lemonade was like drinking sugar water That being said the place does have plenty of space and outdoor patio if you don't mind waiting and very attentive staff.,1,1,1
19,Richard K.,"New York, NY",5,97,126,3.0,9/25/2017,"Okay cant blame the establishment for crying babies. But i sometimes wish these Dumbo stroller brunchers stayed home and bond more with their kiddos on their balcony or a no-baby/stroller policy like coffeeshops have a no laptop rule. Just to offer more convenience...Well having that said. I have never had such a basic cobb salad void of creativity or love. Just greens, chopped bacon chopped chicken some blue cheese and half an avocado  thrown in... THATS IT!! No union not a single cranberry. My friends from Europe were happy with their burger, so I am happy. The grits were a new thing for them and they loved it. But my salad ..... but i ABSOLUTELY love the staff. Kind and service oriented. But they should get a new chef/cook.",1,4,
20,Albert D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,1.0,9/15/2018,"Today was about my one hundredth time eating at Westville and probably my last. I went to Westville with my two young sons (ages 6 years old and 9 months old) and two friends to have lunch there today. Towards the end of lunch I took my infant son to the restroom for a change. There was a short line, about 5-6 people ahead of us. While waiting online I was approached by a worker of Westville and he suggested that instead of waiting online I should go use the public bathroom down the street. He made the assumption that I was a non-paying customer and I should use someone else's facilities. He decided to approach the one person online that had a regular to-do t-shirt and shorts while holding his infant son -- very classy.The worker's manager told him that I had been eating in the restaurant already but the worker never apologized and continued to give me instructions to the public bathroom down the street. Mind you, I live in the neighborhood and would frequent this spot -- but not anymore.The food on the other hand was ok. Not sure how you can mess up burgers and fries!!C ya!!",,,
21,Erina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,324,175,2.0,4/23/2018,"I stopped by with my family on a Saturday at 3pm. It was a very nice day out and everyone was at Brooklyn Bridge Park so I would assume this place be very busy (it was). It was a cute place with a lot of seating and a great outdoor space and screened in patio. I was told it would be a 20-30 minute wait but was pleasantly surprised when we really only waited 10 minutes. We were seated quickly, but the quick service aspect stopped there. Granted, the restaurant was really busy but it took nearly 10 minutes to get water, another 10 to order and 20 minutes to get food. When the food arrived, there were no utensils and it took a long time to flag down someone to get them. The food was also not super spectacular. Their chicken cobb salad and fried buttermilk chicken sandwich was really good. However, we were just not too taken with the other dishes. A bit pricey as well. Overall, 2.5 stars. Probably will not return.",,,

There are two inside dining rooms perfect for groups or for couples on a brunch date. If you have a young family or enjoy being outside, there's a large outdoor patio in the back.The service is great and the food even better. All the ingredients are fresh and change weekly. When we went, we ordered the poached eggs on a kale salad and the roasted brussel sprouts with cucumber lemonade to wash it down. All was really good. The only thing to note is that the brussel sprouts come with a more intense sauce than you'd think. It is layered on there thick and a tad too sweet.For families, it's the perfect spot.

All three of us got the same order: fried chicken and waffles. This was on a special brunch specials menu that was separate from the normal menu so I'm not sure if it's always available.The food was amazing. The fried chicken and waffles came not only with those two and its gravy, but it came with a fried egg and gravy on top, with a few green apple slices attached to the side with a toothpick so you can pretend this is a health meal.

Firstly, the amount they served was way more than we expected. It turned out to be over full for both of us after finished all the food in our plates. Secondly, the food here is so fresh and heathy.

Updated review",If you're looking for healthy and want to forget that what you're ordering is healthy then you have to try Westville. It's the guilt free restaurant with fresh market vegetables grilled and presented beautifully. I'm a sucker for their Cobb salad with their house vinaigrette. Their market salads are amazing and you can try up to four for a yummy plate with variety like zucchini and tomatoes with mozzarella. I always come here because the food is consistently good and tastes fresh. I've brought my male friends who prefer to eat large quantities of not so healthy food and they love the weekly specials which sometimes include salmon tacos and healthy c. It's a crowd pleaser and doesn't break the bank.,,,

They let us add flavors to our margarita so we had mango and strawberry and they weren't too sweet or too strong. They were delicious. They have tons of vegetarian options we had cauliflower chicken wings and veggie chicken nuggets. We also had the sliders and tacos. Every dish was done well and was full of flavor. The owner brought us a free dessert in the end which was a cookie cheesecake. It was a yummy dessert and an overall good experience!,,,

35,Jenn Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",223,169,1452,5.0,6/12/2017,"Super casual brunch/lunch/dinner spot with ample seating. Food was delicious but expensive... $28 for a bowl of stir fry over rice and salmon. But it's supposed to be higher quality ingredients so I guess that makes it's ok- for nyc prices. I would come back if it weren't so expensive.We came on a Sunday night around 6pm, plenty of seats, lots of families and kids running around. They have a lot of options on their menu but we all got the honey chipotle salmon stir, which was a bunch of stir fried veggies over rice with a generous quarter of an avocado and a giant chunk of salmon. Salmon was yummy and crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Avocado was perfectly ripe and delicious. Stir fry was great, but the sauce kind of felt like the cheap sweet and sour sauce that you get from chinese take out. I wish they used a different sauce but it was still fine. Our individual bill came up to $28 for one bowl of salmon and veggies which imo is expensive but to each their own. Their drinks looked good but we didn't get any.",3,,4

I had the fried chicken sandwich, and it was perfectly fried with simple, but great toppings. The salad was nothing special, but works well as a side. Others at the table also really enjoyed their food, except for the chicken quesadilla. It was nearly impossible to eat, and contained almost no cheese. It was more of a veggie and chicken salad clumsily wrapped in a tortilla. Overall I would go back to try more menu items. The food is simple, but perfect for a light lunch.",1,1,1

This place was such a great find!It's a very small and intimate place with a limited menu. Tables are a bit too close together but once you settle in you don't seem to mind at all. It's a very romantic atmosphere and perfect just for couples not large groups as it's a tiny place. I ordered the cuban sliders and my boyfriend ordered the battered fish and chips. I loved my sliders they were perfection! I tasted my bf's meal and the fish was so fresh and clean in taste! We also ordered two glasses of Chardonnay which was fantastic!Service was excellent, friendly and speedy. I have no complaints about this place.",5,1,1

The Peruvian bun was delicious and less carry, the burger was tender and juicy, the cheese was shredded instead of a whole slice, the quarter avocado was just plopped on the patty instead of fanned or smashed. The Artichokes were out of a can which was less than I would have expected. The service was exceptionally friendly.",7,1,2

Since I have been to Westville in Chelsea and enjoyed it, I thought this would be a safe choice especially since it adheres to my dietary restrictions. This place is a short walk from the Park, so I took my order to go and headed back to eat by the river. I ordered their new Salmon salad and asked for the tomatoes to be removed. I was pleased when taking my order not only did they agree to this substitution but offered to replace with with cucumbers. I was offered water as I waited and told I could sit at the bar and they would bring my order to me. The salmon was really good and the dressings that came with it made the salad an even better compliment. I'll definitely be returning.",,,
54,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,5.0,8/16/2017,"Westville is a food haven for vegetarians and vegetable friends. With a menu focused on seasonal produce, I always leave here feeling refreshed, full, and inspired to cook. There are plenty of options for carnivores, and I think this is one of the few places that can please most palates. Cuisine tilts American, with nods to many other cultural spices and flavors. I've been a fan of their Alphabet City location for a long time, so knowing there is a new Westville in Brooklyn makes me an automatic fan. Hubby and I came for an early Sunday 5:30 pm dinner and were seated immediately. The place was actually about half full already and completely full when we left around 6:30 pm, with a small wait out the door. There are three seating areas: the main indoor dining room, the covered patio, and the outdoor patio with picnic tables. The indoor and covered patio areas are best for strollers/wheelchairs, although they may make your table neighbors feel a bit squished. There are two or three neutral bathrooms, one especially large for families and changing tables. I think Westville is nice enough for a casual date or to bring your out of town parents. It's not pretentious, but its bright and charming and very much a neighborhood staple.Service is good, with helpful waitstaff that know the menu in and out and a good attention to allergies. They check in often and are pretty friendly. We always had water and plates were cleared quickly. In addition, the kitchen turn over is great, I remember getting our dishes very quickly. The food is the best! I love love love their market plate, where you pick four different veggies for $17 (as of Aug 2017). The vegetables are super varied, from tofu, to roasted beets with goat cheese and walnuts, watermelon with mint and feta, zucchini with mozz and cherry tomatoes, kimchi cucumbers, dark leafy greens, tofu, potatoes, lentils and beans. The market veggies change seasonally, so it will always mix up if you come frequently. I also like their crab cakes and they make a decent burger and mac and cheese. They also offer cocktails and wine.",1,,

It was ready on time, so no issues there. I also got to take a look inside and the place is great. Lots of natural light and comfortable seating.The entree came with two sides. I got the roasted beets with goat cheese and the chickpea/eggplant stew. The beets were good but were hardly roasted. Tasted like the kind you get out of a can. The eggplant stew was much better, but not very aesthetically pleasing. Quite the opposite.I'm willing to give Westville another shot, but... maybe on the company's dime.",1,1,1

My boyfriend had the skirt steak sandwich, also very yummy, the meat was very tender. My boyfriends kids had the grilled cheese and sliders. The cheddar & gouda grilled cheese was one of the best I've ever had... and I looooove my grilled cheese. The slider burgers were flame broiled and very fresh. Fries are very good too. My only gripe was they don't have ranch dressing which I love dipping my fries/chicken in, but they made up for it with a garlic aioli (great with the fries) and a chipotle mayo (great with the chicken fingers).",,,
58,Alex K.,"Greenville, SC",216,5,7,5.0,7/17/2017,"Exploring DUMBO and ignored our hunger until it was unbearable. We were seated promptly, though my violent hunger was not pleased at the promises of ""cauliflower"" and ""kale"" written on the windows since it felt as though I would only be satisfied with a five pound burger and cheese fries piled to the size of a small animal. Luckily enough, I was in for a surprise.The service was excellent - we asked to wait for another friend to show up and ordered drinks in the meantime. They were out of the watermelon juice for one of their signature cocktails, but the pineapple margarita special was a good replacement. Naturally starved by then, we placed an order for the Westville Market which is where you choose four of their freshly made veggie sides that come piled separately on one huge plate. Our choices: brussel sprouts (amazing and whatever sauce they are in, I could swim in it), artichokes with Parmesan (amazing because cheese), roasted butternut squash (cooked perfectly but little seasoning - could've done without these), and zucchini with mozzarella and tomatoes (like a warm veggie salad with cheese - so good, favorite side).There was a little confusion about who was our waiter/waitress because multiple people checked on us, but that simply meant the service was very attentive, and they were patient when our friend took an extra 20 minutes to show up. We finally ordered our mains, and after stuffing myself with delicious vegetables, I didn't leave much room for a huge main so I opted for the Greek salad which comes with balsamic lemon dill vinaigrette (where can I buy this stuff, it's light but flavorful and heavenly), and a grilled baguette with goat cheese which turned out to be the perfect accompaniment - the other salads come with meat instead but I was on a veggie kick. And this was no small salad - it was a big bowl, the size of a small animal (so no need for cheese fries). So if you're feeling like you need to force yourself to eat something green but can't bear the thought of choking down some mysterious green juice, come here, and you'll be satisfied with fun takes on veggies and some fabulous, large-and-in-charge salads. And so my only recommendation to Westville is to get rid of the boring-sounding vegetables written on the windows and write ""yes, this is healthy ,but yes, you will be happy.""",1,2,

66,Britt D.,"New York, NY",346,50,81,4.0,6/3/2017,Westville is a chain and it's so delicious. Only giving a 4 star this time because the salad I got (cauliflower BBQ quinoa salad) wasn't as good as my regular order (market plate with 4 veggies). Still was very sizable- I brought home leftovers so it was essentially 2 meals. My fiancé got the Cobb and loved it. Very spacious and they have an outdoor area.

It was definitely a step up above your normal bar food, but it's still pretty much bar food. Also they wouldn't give out a password to the WiFi.  Still, overall a good experience.  I wouldn't make a special trip to go back but I'd eat there again if I were in the area.",5,5,4

It came out in about 15 minutes, which was pretty speedy. Burger came out medium rare as asked. It was pretty hefty as it's 8 ounces. Very juicy. The English muffin was a nice touch. The fries were thick and crispy but not too crispy. The meal was pretty filling even for someone who has a huge appetite. All for $13 which is a food price as some places charge upwards of 18 dollars for burgers that's less than half the size of this. Definitely a great place to grab a quick bite if you're in the area.

But I'm mostly disappointed in the appetizer special described as: Roasted Balsamic Glazed Brussels Sprouts - w/ onions, butternut squash, sweet potato & carrot topped w/ dried cranberries. It's all undercooked. The Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and carrots are all crunchy. And the amount of Brussels sprouts compared to the toppings was measly. $10? I also got a ""side' of hangar steak, which also cost $10. Some bites were incredibly chewy. At least the portion size made more sense for $10.

Diners combine vegetables and around 5 meat or fish offerings to make meals, or choose from an array of complete plates. You probably want to know about the quality and it was excellent to very good. Ambition and creativity are the two ingredients missing from the food. We can tolerate or even welcome their absence when food which is good and good for you is the center of the experience. And a few dishes were remarkable, such as the mushroom special in chimichurri. We sat at the bar. The restaurant was comfortable and spacious. Here's the deets (20 May 17):Steak plate, 26, very good, the 8 ounce portion was excellent for sharing; who needs more than a quarter-pound of steak at a meal?Market plate, 17, four vegetables from the gigantamous list on the blackboard and 3-4 more on the specials list.Smokey margarita, 12, mezcal and tequila, drank up; didn't need agave to sweeten it in favor of the fresh limeRose, 9, special price, goodBONUS pleasant settingBONUS good valueSHOUT OUT to Rosalee at the bar for being friendly and cheerful to us and everyone eating thereBONUS family friendlyTIP convenient to St Ann's Warehouse for pre-theater dining",1,1,

107,Andy S.,"Littleton, CO",2,35,54,3.0,12/17/2017,"I've had two experiences at Westville. DUMBO was the first. Sometimes I go into restaurants with high expectations. And I think maybe that's what I did here. The menu looks solid. It sounds amazing. But the food just fell short of that. Some people love it clearly, and if you've never gone, I'd suggest giving it a shot. Buiuuuuut not for me.",,,

I've live in the city for three years and finally found a place with amazing eats to match the amazing cocktails for happy hour. Vegan meatballs are a must, even if you're not vegan.

I did takeout via their website and it was perfect -- I walked to the end of the bar (towards the back) and our order was ready. Their marinated tofu is magical and the turkey burger hit the spot.

112,Tiffany C.,"Prairie Village, KS",0,11,0,5.0,1/19/2018,"Stopped in here for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The ambience is great - relatively small with an urban, industrial feel. Service was excellent. They have an amazing selection of vegetable sides. They all sounded good so it was hard to choose only two. (They do have a plate where you can choose four vegetable sides)  I ordered the salmon plate with the beets & goat cheese and the sautéed mushrooms with leeks. The salmon was prepared perfectly and the beets and mushrooms were delicious! We also ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad which was fresh and good - 4/5 on the Caesar. Highly recommend this delicious Brooklyn restaurant.",,,

Both of my friends ordered it, and I ordered grilled salmon with two sides of market vegetables, Asian-style bok choy and artichokes with parmesan. All was excellent. We then had really nice tea with cinnamon sticks and lemon.",,,
114,Michael J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,11,1,4.0,8/8/2017,It was pretty good. Food is kind of expensive but that's expected of Dumbo. It was close to work so I came with my co-workers. Not much seats inside so they offered us to sit out in the yard.

Very lovely outdoor patio seating is available.,2,,1

124,Christine H.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,44,11,5.0,3/15/2017,"thank goodness for Westville in Dumbo. We were in need of this comfortable dining atmosphere with variety + easy menu with somewhat healthy options. After a long renovation, it has finally opened, and we are so very happy. We(my husband and I) were always big fans of westville. We relocated from East Village to Dumbo about a year ago. We love Dumbo, but it seriously lacks dining options compare to our beloved East Village. So we are very happy and can't wait for the outdoor space to open up :) must try: french fries ... don't get one to share, get your own, you won't regret :)  I had crab burger the other off of their daily special menu. It was amazing :) Anyone wants to open a good ramen or asian spot in dumbo? We need that too !!!",,,

128,Steve C.,"Montclair, NJ",0,48,2,3.0,12/3/2016,"Westville: It's Fine™This new outpost of the Manhattan chain is in many ways emblematic of DUMBO--at least 25% too expensive, filled with white people and their children under 5 years old, and it has exposed beams. Westville serves large portions of what I'd call ""sure-fire"" food. The service was friendly and the food comes out FAST. An appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and a dessert was $90 including tip.For the same price, you can eat sparingly at one of the only two good restaurants in the neighborhood (Vinegar Hill House) and feast like a king at the other (Juliana's Pizza). I'd just as soon go to either of those places, (or heck, get a sandwich from Foragers). But because of the dearth of restaurants in DUMBO, they will be packed all the time and make a lot of money. It just won't be my money.",3,2,

136,Michelle R.,"Bethesda, MD",199,733,99,3.0,1/8/2017,"I agree with other reviewers who mentioned Westville Dumbo is at least 20% more expensive than it's worth, and they charge you for extra sauces (although i liked the horseradish mayo enough to order it again in the future).  The service was great, and the food did come out quickly though some of my market sides were not even warm.  My husband enjoyed his fried chicken dinner plate, but wished it came with more protein (it would have been enough food for me!).  For now, Westville Dumbo is definitely somewhere between 'Meh, I've experienced better' and 'A-OK'.",,,

Well priced too.I've just never been a fan of the overly bright/white decor of the westville chain. But thats more of a personal preference for dark woods and the occasional tv playing sports.

141,Radhika S.,"Houston, TX",1,14,9,2.0,8/2/2017,Everything on the menu looked incredible and I loved the place's atmosphere but the food itself was incredibly underwhelming. I ordered a lime tahini cauliflower bowl with sweet potatoes and chickpeas which looked beautiful and tasted like cardboard. There was no lime and just a bit of tahini drizzled on top for show. I tried getting through the bowl but it wasn't possible. I'd recommend either trying something not too starch heavy or be fine with bland food because it seems like that's what you're going to get.,,,
142,Cynthia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,26,0,5.0,2/15/2018,Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Westville Dumbo where the food was fresh and very delicious. Added benefit is that the food is also very healthy. The  broccoli with garlic is so good that you forget that you are eating vegetables. The macoroni and cheese was scrumptous as well and it is just a good vibe at the restaurant.,,,

145,Sam B.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,50,9,4.0,6/23/2017,"Westville's food was always great in Manhattan and it looks like Brooklyn has followed suit.  The Brooklyn location, while busy, is also a bit less hectic.  Service was a bit odd in that all three waiters/waitresses tries taking our order the second we sat down but were very pleasant overall and our orders came out quickly and correctly.  Great options from healthy to indulgent and the vegetable sides are all very good as was the special salmon burger.  My one issue was the $2 up-charge for sweet potato fries when they are the same price as regular fries on the menu and I don't recall seeing an up-charge stated.  At lower end places, fine (when its advertised), but when a couple is dropping nearly $100 for a primarily vegetarian meal (albeit a very good one), I feel like I am getting clipped and not in the hippy-dippy vibe they are promoting.  Likely to go back but will be ordering strategically (and if I ever get out of work in time happy hr looked cool).",,,
146,H. Stephen B.,"Bronx, NY",74,12,2,4.0,7/28/2017,"The food here is truly excellent. I had the crispy quinoa burger and beer. Really tasty and reasonably priced. Even more, the service is speedy!  Even more than that, the folks at the bar will give you tastings of what is on tap!Sean, one of the directors was on hand and filled me in on the company. And he gave a free shot of an Irish whiskey they are offering at the bar. How great is that!?The only reason I didn't give five stars? The noise! The space is very echoey and one must almost shout to be heard by the person next to you. If that was solved? Seven stars!",,,
147,Lindsay F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,13,0,2.0,4/29/2017,"Was so excited for Westville to come to my hood. Every time I go though, the service seems off. Understandable for a new restaurant. But tonight took the cake. I called and asked if they had a table for two outside. The woman on the phone said ""yes, we have several free.""  So my husband and I head over only to find they are packed full. Hostess says ""oh you shouldn't call and ask. They don't really know the status - they are in the back and don't check with us."" Sorry? How am I supposed to know the people who answer the phone don't know what they are talking about. While I am arguing with the hostess, the mysterious woman from the back who answers the phone appears. She asks the hostess how long the wait is for two. And this is just when the hostess is telling me that the woman in the back doesn't check. That woman baited me to come down there on a lie because she was too lazy to ask for accurate information at the time I called. Too lazy to put me on hold and ask. This wouldn't happen at any other westville. This place needs to figure out how to run a neighborhood joint. Thanks for the disappointment and the snobbery. So glad café gítane is coming to the hood now!Would have given one star for poor execution, but giving two because other westvilles are good.",1,,

The food menu is great. The Israeli chicken shawarma plate is as good as it gets. It's flavor full and the size is great as well. I had the veggie burger with a side of greens and was alot to eat.

We want you here.I love Almar, Superfine and Gran Electrica, but that's not many options when it comes to an NYC neighborhood. I understand that good restaurants either don't want to come here or don't make it here because we're a neighborhood of families with kids who can't go out much. Regardless, we're jealous of other neighborhoods and want more options. Enter Westville. We've eaten in Manhattan locations and liked it. We were excited. The food was great. Somehow, the food isn't as great here. I have no idea why. I'm down to liking only the fries. The mashed potatoes are really bad. I had soup that really sucked. I went for breakfast and had one of the worst omelets I've ever had. I got grilled chicken to improve it but the tastes didn't go together. The salad was average but was the only saving grace. How can you screw up breakfast? The design is stunning. It's a great space to work with. The service is really great. But they're bored. They said so when I was the only one eating at the bar. Thanks. You're welcome for my $50 shitty meal and 25% tip. I'm trying to like you. I'm trying not to miss Rice. (And that's a pretty low bar.) I want you here, Really. Please please make better food. Make better children friendly food. That's the reality you signed on for. This really is out of a desire for things to work out for you.",3,1,

Each plate  is fresh and there is a wide selection of delicious options. I ordered the Mac and cheese and the Chicken cutlet which were delectable! The chicken cutlet was better than my Nana's and is a high bar! ALSO ! Don't miss dessert! I had there take on an Oreo and I nearly died! Long story short this place is the bomb! I hope it stays as a staple in this neighborhood for years to come! :),,,1
165,Christine L.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,23,28,4.0,7/31/2017,"Westville has never disappointed. Great wait staff that was very accommodating and attentive in terms of seating us and making sure that we were okay while waiting. The restaurant has an indoor seating area and an outdoor covered patio. It also looks like they are extending their outdoor seating area. We opted for the indoors since we didn't want any of the sawdust to fly into our food. Seats were a little dirty when we got to our table. We informed our server, but I guess they were busy and forgot to come help us wipe it down. We ended up doing it on our own. No biggie though. I came with 3 others and each of us had a wonderful experience. The food portion was moderate. We ordered the westville cobb salad which was great. I had to ask for extra dressing on the side though. My salad was missing an egg .. didn't realize it until halfway through dinner. Generally, cobb salads are served with half or whole hard boiled egg. At least it was served with it at the Chelsea location. My friends ordered the mac and cheese (very yummy and cheesy), veggie burger, chef's salad (much smaller than the cobb salad), fish and chips and a market plate. Overall it was a pretty healthy dinner, even the fish and chips. The fish wasn't drenched with oil like other places. It was nice and fluffy. The fries were amazing. I didn't get a chance to try the chef's salad or veggie burger, so there's not much for me to talk about. We ordered the zucchini, brussel sprouts, mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes for our market place. I liked all of them but the brussel sprouts. It was very flavorful, but I didn't like the fact that it was diced. The pieces were small so it was hard to grasp the flavor of it. I accompanied my meal with the cucumber lemonade, which was such a great pairing for a warm summer day. It was cool and refreshing. I honestly could've had 5 glasses of it.After dinner, we took a stroll around the DUMBO area to view the skyline. It's a nice brisk walk for the summer. This spot is a wonderful location. Close to many ice cream shops too!",,,
166,Vikki R.,"Astoria, NY",62,5,0,5.0,12/7/2016,"Obsessed! Known for its 20+ market veggies and tasty burgers, I'm stoked to invite Westville over the bridge!My company has ordered from Westvilles around Manhattan for years. They always handle our large orders well and deliver quickly so I was super excited to see they were opening one in my 'hood.I was not disappointed when my delivery came piping hot in under 30 minutes. The delivery guy was polite and pleasant to boot!My husband and I stopped for a drink at the bar Friday night after 8 and despite a previous post, there were only adults in sight. The friendly bartender chatted us up and told us of plans to open the large outdoor raised patio. OUTDOOR DINING!?! Yes please!The beauty of this place is its versatility. I can speak to its family friendliness during the week, adult vibes later in the evening and prompt delivery services. What more could you ask for? Westville you make my food dreams come true!",1,,
167,Zach M.,"Niantic, CT",0,2,0,5.0,12/7/2016,Love all the Westville locations. Nice to have one in Dumbo! Enjoyed my first visit and will be back!!!,1,,
168,Aurelie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0,4.0,2/20/2017,My 3 teenagers and I had diner last night and we all found something we loved and that met our various diet preferences. The Vegetables (Westville Market) alone are amazing. The waitress was attentive to our table and was always smiling. We came in at 6:30pm on a Sunday and we waited 30minute  for a table of 4 (I had tried to make a reservation 3 hours before but they had already closed their reservation booking). The wait was worth it and gave us the opportunity to stroll around Dumbo.,,,
169,Ariana A.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/19/2017,"Let's start with the food: from the salads, to the sandwiches, and of course the famous market plate, you can't go wrong! (Pro tip: always check daily specials too!) There's something for everyone - always fresh, healthy, and absolutely delicious (did I mention the perfect price too?!). They also have fresh desserts daily if you care to indulge :)Now the drinks: blended mint lemonade is out of this world.. and little known secret: Westville has happy hour! The space: absolutely beautiful with an outdoor patio (heated for winter months). If you're solo, you can eat brunch / lunch / dinner at the bar and enjoy the company of the fantastic and friendly bartenders. Whether I want a quick lunch, a nice dinner to bring a client, weekend brunch with friends, or an after work happy hour with coworkers, Westville is my go to. Couldn't be happier to have Westville in Dumbo!!",,,
170,Adam Z.,"Baltimore, MD",13,14,2,5.0,1/6/2017,Great food with attentive service. Everything tasted very fresh. The atmosphere is cute and charming. Will be back.,,,
171,Dmitry K.,"Manhattan, NY",97,5,18,5.0,1/1/2017,Great comfort food (reasonably priced) and excellent service. It feels like the people running this place really care. Definitely recommend the breakfast burrito!,,,
172,Linda Q.,"Chantilly, VA",1,13,1,4.0,8/5/2017,"FYI: this is not just for vegetarians. That Sesame Tuna was killer! But if you are a vegetarian, this is also a great place for you. The bok choy was also AMAZING, and don't get shy because of the look of the Pesto Mashed Potatoes. The outdoor seating was wonderful too. Make sure to stop by if you are in Dumbo!",,,
173,Deepa A.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,14,1,2.0,12/22/2016,FYI -- delivery zone map on website is inaccurate.  The map indicates that they deliver to Boerum Place but the restaurant says not beyond Court Street.,,,
174,Paige E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/27/2017,This chic and cozy space charmed me with its simple yet classy decor. The servers were hot! And the food is tasty and healthy. Good place.,,,
175,Elizabeth K.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,26,8,1.0,1/26/2017,"I've ordered 3 times from here since they opened in my neighborhood a few months back--lunch, dinner and dessert, and I've had a drink there once (wine--not disgusting, but certainly not impressive; I'd held hope in this regard, but no expectations). The bartender was quite friendly, though we encountered no other staff.I was REALLY REALLY hoping we'd get a decent restaurant in DUMBO since there are few around. But no. My chicken burger looked like processed meat--something cheap from the frozen section at a grocery store. The fries were unspeakable. I don't know if the oil was rancid, or they were merely overheated. Either way, no. The fish and chips were completely vile. They were clearly frozen battered fish heated in the microwave. Floppy, soggy, disgusting and utterly inedible. Finally, on a different occasion, I once ordered some desserts, which appeared to be no different than those one might find mass processed and frozen, although the site says they're ""baked fresh daily"" at one of their Manhattan locations. The ice cream was fine, but the containers were moldy. Yes. And all of this is relatively expensive.When I see people inside this place as I walk by, I wonder what they're thinking. VERY VERY disappointing that WV is filling this nice, enormous space in a neighborhood with few options. The ""few options"" is what allows a place like this to continue.",,,
176,Alex N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/16/2017,"You can tell that this place is good by the number of people that have been to their Manhattan locations and are just happy they're in Brooklyn.  It's one of the only places you can go and eat a lot of vegetables that taste good, without feeling like you're giving up anything. And the meat is good, too.Given the location, which is starved for restaurants, it is not surprising that they are kid-friendly. But they have a real bar, and the outdoor space should be excellent in nice weather.One could gripe with the prices, but this is DUMBO.",,,
177,Paige C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,5.0,1/7/2017,Nomnomnom LOVE! This place is fantastic. So glad they opened in Dumbo. Love the Mac n Cheese,,,
178,Mallory A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,39,0,5.0,6/1/2017,"I have been here in one of its first weeks of opening and it was great. However, went back recently and it's even better. Definitely one of the top Westville's. Great for a decisions healthy meal. Also great indoor outdoor patio for a nice dinner.",,,
179,Peter P.,"BREEZY POINT, NY",0,5,0,5.0,5/31/2017,This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. The food quality is good and predictable and the service is very efficient.,,,
180,Osh P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,0,2.0,3/22/2017,The place was crammed so they're not hurting for business. Ordered the veggie burger and it exploded in my hands. $1 uncharge on a bread change resulted in a $17 pile of wet veggies and that sealed the deal: I am never going back.,,,
181,S A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,0,5.0,5/27/2017,Just went for the first time for Sunday brunch. The food was amazing and the service so friendly. Enchanted. Can't wait to go back.,,,
182,Rebekah C.,"New York, NY",4,8,3,1.0,8/10/2017,"Beyond disappointed. Decided to takeout my daughter's lunch from here today because didn't have a chance to make her lunch in the morning. Long story short, told cashier she has a dairy allergy and he said he'll make note of it so that the kitchen will exclude cheese from her meal. Come home and see mozzarella in her food. Call them and they offered to deliver the side dish that they messed up on. Was hoping they would remake the entire meal in case of cross contamination, but didn't want to make a huge fuss since mistakes happen. Tried feeding her parts of the meal that looked untouched by the cheese. Well her mouth and chest are covered in hives and she's scratching like crazy right now. Luckily her tongues not swollen (sign that her throat is closing up) so hopefully I won't need to administer the epipen or take her to the hospital. They made some sort of attempt to remedy the mistake but I saw it as the bare minimum they could have done. If you're working in the food industry, you need to take allergies seriously; thankfully the reaction today doesn't seem as serious as it could have been but some allergies are life threatening. And side note- but found out today that their fish (both salmon and trout) are farmed. At $19/$23, respectively, you would think otherwise. Used to be our last minute go-to dish for her when necessary, but won't be anymore.",,,
183,Evie S.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,1,5.0,4/11/2017,"The vegan hotdog was so amazing, I was skeptical it was actually vegan. Great place and great service!",,,
184,Jasim R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,2,0,5.0,12/9/2016,Came here to satisfy my monthly burger craving. Left superbly satisfied. The burger hits the spot. It has the flavorfulnpess and satisfaction of a steakhouse burger minus the greasiness and post-meal big-burger aftertaste. I ordered market sides which were also fantastic. The spaciousness and airy ambiance is a welcome change from Westville's buzzier Manhattan locations. I highly recommend this restaurant and this particular location!,1,,
185,J W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,1.0,9/29/2017,"The food was fine. The service was depressing. I was waited on by a tag team of various people, none of whom ever took ownership of my table. Nobody told me what had been 86'd until I tried to order some of it, then asked for a rundown of what else they didn't have on the menu. There was more, but hey, why bother to tell me?  I had to beg the person who came to take my plate away to take a drink order for a second drink. Turns out I was in her station. I'd been listening to her chat up other tables, while her coworkers took turns cobbling together the basics of taking my order then abandoning me. I didn't find out she was supposed to have been my waitress until she dropped the check and I asked whose station I was in. By that point I felt so dismissed at having never even been offered a dessert menu (just an offhand ""anything else?"" which I'd had to follow up by actually asking if they even served dessert) that I just wanted to know whether I'd ever been anyone's table at all. I'd made a reservation. What a joke of a place.",,,
186,Robert P.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,28,0,5.0,10/3/2017,as people go this place will pick up steam.solid food good prices.nice décor diverse menus and nice wait staff.,,,
187,Gili B.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,12/31/2016,This Westville location is awesome! Such a cool space and the same amazing food as all other locations. It really fits perfectly in the neighborhood. I have so many favorites that I keep coming back. Healthy options galore. Excited that there's such a great option in Dumbo!,,,
188,Vincent T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,0,2.0,12/23/2016,"I had the fish and chips tonight one of only six ""plates"" items on the menu.  The fish batter was very soggy from the get go and got soggier as time passed. What more can I say.  The service was good though thus 2 stars.",,,
189,Chris S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,12/7/2016,I had the vegetables (they let you pick 4) and they were so so good! The server was so sweet to me and good with my children which is hard to come by these days! My daughters got the mac and cheese (which I ate of if I'm being honest) so happy to have these guys in my neighborhood now! Been eating at the one in the west village for years! Even saw one of my servers from that one at this one! Nice to still see places that still have that mom and pop vibe.,,,
190,Doug G.,"Great Neck, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/7/2016,Tried this new location after going to the one in the east village for years. The food and service totally hold up and the bartenders are almost as cute!  ;),,,
