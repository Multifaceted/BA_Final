0,Kerri B.,"Manhattan, NY",142,7,2,4.0,8/30/2018,Stef was an awesome server omg the food was so good and she was so patient with me while I made a decision. I love a good local pub where you feel right at home. I had the wings and quesadillas and both were equally great! The have plenty of tvs and its a nice crowd but you can find a seat. With the start of football season next week I can't wait to back!,,,
1,Sarah G.,"Jersey City, NJ",107,142,26,2.0,9/22/2018,"Decent bar but I'm always surprised at how credit most bars in lower manhattan are. My friend is obsessed with all the weird, white people bars in lower manhattan and I don't get it.The only redeeming quality of this bar is their house beer is pretty good. The food is mediocre at best.Service is alright but not entirely attentive.",,,
2,Ross H.,"New York, NY",347,106,436,3.0,1/4/2018,"Reade Street Pub is located in TriBeCa off Greenwich st on Reade st. It is a small location with basically only locals that go.They have good prices if you are looking for beer. I would go with their Read St brew. The wait staff and what seemed to be the owners are extremely friendly and accommodating. In the end this place is a very simply classic pub with ok food, nothing special. If you are in the area and are looking for a quick pitcher in a quiet old school pub then come here.",2,,
3,Kristian D.,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",369,1304,3330,4.0,1/30/2018,"We just stumbled upon the Reade Street Pub & Kitchen while wandering around the neighborhood. This neighborhood pub is fairly large and open inside with a great feel. They are located on Reade Street near the Chambers Street Station in Tribeca.This is a great example of a New York neighborhood bar. The bar itself is long with lots of seating. There are lots of tables for larger groups. Combined with the full bar menu, there is a kitchen making some great bar food and other specialties. Staff was fun and interesting which made our visit extra special.They have a unique policy asking patrons not to take pictures without permission. We obliged with this request, so I do not have any pictures. There are a lot of 9/11 memorials and other special decorations throughout the bar that should be seen in person along with a drink or food. Fortunately, it was quiet on a Tuesday which made for better conversation.If you are looking for a nice neighborhood style pub, Reade Street Pub & Kitchen may fit the bill. It is not fancy, but clean and fun and convenient to a lot of Tribeca options.",8,2,8
4,Bea L.,"Crown Heights, NY",0,314,0,2.0,10/15/2018,"This place is full of the types of people who make me very uncomfortable. I think it has pictures of NY firemen on walls, so it seems like an after shift bar for service people and maybe cops/firemen. So many upper-middle aged or old white men, flirting and watching twenty year old women who clearly just got off a serving job. It's gross and sleazy in here. Even the bartenders. The first time I went in a bartender made me high five him. Why on earth would I want to touch his nasty dirty hand? And he winked at me. The beers are cheapest in area so sometimes I come back, but if that guy is working I make someone else go get my drink. I hate touching strangers when I am behind the bar. This guy is working but behaving like the customers I despise.",,,
5,Addie C.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",281,17,1,5.0,8/27/2018,I went in here a few weeks back for a drink and it was amazing. Reasonably priced. Nice bartender. BUT THEN I ORDERED TO GO FOOD TODAY AND -- why is the potato salad so good???? HOW?! It's a bar!! Get the potato salad. It was delicious.,,,
6,Christine S.,"BAYSIDE, NY",32,38,23,5.0,6/24/2018,"We stopped here for lunch, with some friends who were in from England, with our group of 6 kids and 4 adults!  It was quiet when we walked in but we got the party started!! All of the kids squeezed into a booth and began ordering endless sodas, nachos, wings and mozzarella sticks!  Us adults hid at a table and ordered beers and sandwiches and more beers. The bartender and only waitress did an AMAZING job keeping the kids fed and watered. And away from us!  The owner switched on the jukebox and the kids went crazy with the Macarena and lots of other silly music!  They really did a great job and we had a ball!  The food was surprisingly great.  All the kids gobbled everything up.",1,,
7,Sandy P.,"New York, NY",561,14,0,1.0,7/26/2018,"Got charged 30% tax on a single mug beer and the receipt was handwritten on a cut piece of paper - no breakdown or date or any other legal information, just a single number. The waitress was rude and the whole payment situation with only a number hand written on a scrap paper was totally unprofessional and probably illegal. I will be going to other bars / pubs in the neighborhood next time",,,
8,Brandon D.,"Philadelphia, PA",232,56,39,5.0,6/29/2017,"I have been here twice now and the last time was such a great time that it warranted a review!The place is a neighborhood bar on Reade St in Tribeca.I was originally here in October of 2016 after visiting NYC with family. We had ordered burgers and wings and a few beers. The staff was quick and the menu was easy. It is just the kind of place that I would frequent if I lived in NYC.I went back on a trip with my girlfriend and two friends of ours based on my recommendation for a bar to get a few beers and relax. We got there around 11PM and were one of the few people there. Shortly after, the place was packed and we were drunk. The bartenders were nice and talkative even though we were outsiders and probably the only people not from NYC there. Our bartender hooked us up with a round of shots and we returned the favor with a sizable tip.We will be back when we are in the city again!",1,,
9,Jack M.,"Winter Park, FL",8,36,1,5.0,6/11/2018,"Passed here many times, think the first time was winter and the Christmas decorations caught my eye!  Went there for the first time last week and was great.  Nice to see a reasonably priced establishment with good food and drinks.  Well done and we will be back!",,,
10,Brandon K.,"Edinburg, TX",68,76,39,5.0,3/9/2017,Outstanding service and atmosphere. Ordered the mushroom burger it was delicious Bar tenders are very attentive to their customer and the bar was super busy. Apparently there was a party.  Sat at the end of the bar and observed while eating my burger and having my Guinness.,2,,1
11,Catherine C.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/21/2018,"Waited over 30 minutes for a few burgers because waitresses, drunk in the early afternoon were standing around and laughing at us and not checking the food. I asked several times for napkins and when she brought me the check instead, she saw I was angry because I hadn't asked for the check. We were still eating. She yelled at me for not saying please to requesting napkins for the millionth time and asked around to other waitress as if I was lying about asking. When I complained about service, they screamed for us to leave. This place is a dirty dive for drunks only. No place to get food. It's even filthy.",1,,
12,Michael W.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,76,11,3.0,5/9/2018,"""A ok"" bar to catch a beer, have a bite and watch a game. I don't care about the 80's on your walls or 60's on your ceiling. Just upgrade your tv's and google what's HD stands for (for God's sake)!",,,
13,Robert G.,"North Hollywood, CA",6,28,8,5.0,1/29/2018,Smitty is amazing!!!  We Stumbled into this bar. Read it with a smile and an ice cold beer. Very welcoming and an excellent reprieve from the cold weather walking our way around New York City.,,,
14,Justine R.,"Rutherford, NJ",34,250,441,5.0,5/11/2017,"I came here every single week in my twenties while in college. It was just a given amongst my friends and I that on Thursday night, this is where'd you'd be. I don't know what we found so great about it, but it just worked for us. All my nj friends would meet me here at 10pm and we'd stay until close. The bartenders were always super friendly and the patrons just as happy to be out and about. The beers were good, the food was good, and the music even better. Most Thursday's they'd have live music. The inside is so comfortable with more than enough room to accommodate many. When I left NYC I was sad to know I wouldn't be frequenting this place much after. Wonderful times and memories. Recommend!",,,
15,Heather L.,"Westfield, NJ",47,165,243,3.0,7/9/2016,"In an area of pricey and trendy places, this place is a welcome gem. It probably hasn't seen an update since the 80s but it has reasonably priced drinks, full bar, and decent pub food. When you are looking for a place to catch up with an old friend, this may be one of the perfect spots in the area. I got a beer and veggie sandwich for about $17. The sandwich was fine, though nothing special, and came with a healthy helping of fries. Service is there but you will have to flag over the waitress for a drink or check or anything.  Bartenders were relatively friendly. Laid back environment and my friend and I were able to catch up uninterrupted for hours, exactly what I was looking for.",,,
16,Mike G.,"Union City, NJ",0,15,0,5.0,8/4/2017,Came in during the holiday season. Had the kids and we were hungry. Everyone was very friendly and the food was good. The portions were large.

18,Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",600,1428,20,3.0,2/26/2016,"This is pretty much your solid local, neighborhood bar in a somewhat dead stretch of Tribeca. Friendly bartenders, decent prices, adequate selection, and lots of TVs--everything you need for a school night hangout with your crew.",2,,2
19,Matt K.,"New York, NY",263,93,22,4.0,6/29/2016,"Reade Street Pub is your all American neighborhood dive bar (note that the neighborhood is still Tribeca though), with cheap drinks, friendly service, and a wide variety of patrons ranging from blue collar workers, to students, to bankers. This is one of the few places left in Manhattan where $12 pitchers of house beer still exist, and their food menu is stacked with an assortment of tasty pub fare. There usually are plenty of tables available (even on busy nights), but it can get a bit routy on Friday evenings when people stop in after work.All in all, a no frills place to grab a cheap, cold beer if you're in the neighborhood.",,,
20,Jersey J.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,16,0,5.0,2/25/2017,"Fantastic flashback to old school New York City.I've ordered multiple food items and they have all been spot on!The food and drinks are a few bucks less, compared to most NYC spots.  This is old school... so don't walk in thinking gourmet.  This is a locals spot, but visitors get a friendly welcome.The menu is standard bar food and is above average for what you will get at an upscale bar.  The pizza is OK, but fills the bill when you are out and about late night drinking.  I love their burgers and chicken sandwiches.  They also offer an awesome potato salad, which is hard to find in the city.The drinks are also reasonably priced.  $5 - $6 for a beer and same for a mixed drink.  Walking in here, you feel like you're walking back into 1990's NYC.  Places like this are now a gem and hard to find,  They support their locals and new friends as well.  This place must stay a staple for years to come!",,,
21,Jaime B.,"Lenexa, KS",0,6,0,5.0,9/16/2016,Great place and awesome music!  The place is homey and the service is outstanding.    Excellent place to have a drink (or twelve) with friends OR to make new friends. Decor is fitting of a neighborhood pub.,,,
22,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,356,4.0,1/16/2013,- $19 pitchers of Goose Island IPA seems like a good price.- Friendly high-fiving bartender.- Had a turkey club that was much better than I expected it to be (either that or I was terrifically hungry and already a little drunk).- The place was lively but not packed (Tuesday evening)- The music on the jukebox occasionally got annoyingly loud.,1,1,2

24,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,4.0,7/1/2012,"The last day of June 2012 brings an intense purgatory heat wave to the Metro NY, where my travels induce me nearby Teardrop Park, Nelson A. Rockefeller Park and firstly Poets House that I was to abate at Reade Street Pub & Kitchen.Bar tender Benny is friendly, attentive, and welcoming to all patrons, albeit not portraying extreme impeccable hospitality, but gets the job done for abate in relief for the air conditioning is fully blasting strong and powerful.  Relief!!  Reade Street Pub & Kitchen, is a local Irish pub for sports watching and/or after-work hang out spot.  It is not a pretentious bar housed with stuffy, upscale bar tenders or wait staff but attends to all in their line of sight.  Benny, the bar tender fully exhibits humility and attentiveness to serve patrons.  A replica of a bronze statute ""Lunch Atop A Skyscraper"" 1932 famous photo by Charles C. Ebbets sits behind the bar.  The atmosphere encompasses baseball caps, model trains, including MTA Subway Downtown sign 1, 2, 3, 9 Trains, an old Greenwich Street sign.Pub food of fish and chips at $12.95 was plentiful to be inhaled within mere minutes from hunger pangs due to abject pain from heat intensity.  I finally was able to attain a good fish and chips entree which Old Mill Inn, a seafood restaurant in Mattituck, NY sourly failed to deliver.  There were actually more than one fish... whoa!  I'm actually seeing three pieces of fish on my plate as it was not a dream which is adequate compensated unlike the vile Old Mill Inn, WOW!!  My Seltzer Water was served cold at $2.05, which together, totals a reasonable $15.00 for my bill.  To enjoy my early dinner/late lunch at my own time in a restful cool air conditioning atmosphere without being bothered by other patrons or being ridiculed was a pleasure.  I hate when male bar tenders or male patrons interject their nonsense inflicted onto me as their rude and vulgar way of so-called flirting.  I do NOT miss the pain of being ridiculed!!Back on point, Reade Street Pub & Kitchen features Reade Street Ale and Magners Irish Cider for the avid beer drinker.  No comment for the alcohol as I did not imbibed any, by choice alone.  Match books with Reade Street Pub & Kitchen's contact details are the substitute for a business card.  I would return but not alone for round #2.",2,,1
25,Mia K.,"New York, NY",572,381,1805,3.0,10/4/2014,This was an ok bar. Dragged here caveman style by my boss. I take it he likes the older divey style crowd. The food was mediocre bar food and the drinks were lightweight so you may need to load up.,1,,
26,Jessica N.,"Somerset, NJ",9,31,10,4.0,7/28/2014,"Super chill pub. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a place to grab a quick drink or hang out with friends. Drinks and food were up to par for any local pub but a downside was that there was no table service; therefore I had to continually get up and go to the bar in order to order food or another drink. But on the bright side their table-cloths are made of paper and they provide crayons, so that mixed with some liquid courage definitely resulted in some interesting artwork!",2,,
27,Christian T.,"Boise, ID",63,2,0,4.0,1/3/2017,"My wife and I spent a few days in Manhattan just before Christmas.  I have always wanted to spend a few days in this great city.  One of those days we spent in the financial district walking around looking at buildings and seeing the sites.  We did a lot of walking trying to get it all in.  Finally, we were hungry and thirsty.  Melissa's knee was hurting and the vitamin I had not kicked in yet.  I was really wanting find a nice warm pub and I had something in mind.  But, Melissa was fading and getting hangry.  Just when we were about to settle for a place that was just a bit more swanky that we were feeling Melissa spotted a spot.  She spotted the large green awning and we headed straight for it.  And, as soon as we stepped inside we new we had found a home away from home.  We sat down and ordered up two hot toddy's a slice of Cheese cake and an apply pie.  Both I must say were very tasty.  The pie was not too sweet and had a nice delicate crust.  We sat next to the hold fire place and soaked up the vibe and the heat!  I noticed on the wall a Idaho License plate from Kootenai County.  Just less than an hour from my home town.  What a funny coincidence.  There is one thing I learned about Irish pubs in NY.  The food and the drinks are some of the cheapest in town.  And, they don't skimp on their pours.  And, the food is really good.  It's the kind of food one would want to eat on a cold cloudy/rain day.  I guess the Irish are good at that.  If you every in the Financial district a recommend stopping in.",,,
28,Honey B.,"Bronx, NY",18,35,7,4.0,8/5/2015,"I have been coming to this pub since 2010, this place gives you the feel that it is a neighborhood bar but with a grimy feel in the heart of Tribeca and surely I wouldn't have it any other way.  From blue-collared working stiffs, BMCC students, and Wall Street types all gather in this place to grab a drink or 3, and mingle with old friends and associates.  My friend    had his retirement party here last year and we practically took over the whole place.  The drinks are typical hard living kind but I am not coming for anything fancy and absurd; I just want to get a buzz.  The food is pretty good as well, my favorite are the Jalapeno poppers.  I have not been here in a few months, sadly but I think this Friday I will be paying them a visit.",1,,
29,Jeff R.,"Arlington, TX",0,13,0,5.0,11/11/2015,"I met the owner of Reade Street Pub, Bruce Barasky, while having dinner at Tribeca Grill. We were both waiting to use the men's room and he struck up a conversation with me. He's a super nice guy and very friendly. With an owner like this, I can only imagine that the pubs he owns are phenomenal. I told him I was on vacation from Amarillo TX and by coincidence, he said he was stationed at the old air base there some 40 years ago. He introduced me to his wife of many years, a lovely woman whom I also enjoyed speaking with. Bruce invited me to visit him at the Reade Street Pub, however sadly, we were unable to. I will definitely come see Bruce the next time we're in NYC and hopefully he'll remember me.",,,
30,Christine L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",447,584,714,4.0,8/2/2013,Came here for drinks and appetizers and it was a fun little divey bar with plenty of tables in the back and a dart board.  They have paper on the tables and crayons so you can draw all the things that your drunk heart desires.  Super cheap drinks and really awesome bartenders.,1,,1
31,Kristian J.,"Breinigsville, PA",5,65,66,4.0,10/18/2015,"This is the type of place that you can call, The Bar, in NYC which is really rare. What I like about this bar is there's always open tables, the service is good enough, the pitchers of beer are cheap $14 for the Reade St Amber Ale is in anyone's budget and is a pretty good beer by all accounts, you can draw on the tables, they show sports and you can generally hear/talk to your friends. It's not a hole in the wall but it's not pretentious either, it's just a bar. And I love bars.",,,
32,Ryan B.,"North Haven, CT",28,145,0,3.0,10/20/2013,"We ended up here last night for our last drink. (It was probably an unneeded last drink.)My best friends and I have fond memories of this place. There was our first visit, during a frigid winter night. Our relationship with alcohol was young. All NYC bars were still a novelty. The music was good and the drinks were reliable. There was a famous story with an escaped puppy. We have had similarly pleasant experiences over the years. They are random and infrequent, but that adds to the charm. The place always has a crowd but is never elbow-to-elbow.This place is a go-to spot that is likely to continue to be visited by us in years to come given its proximity to friends and family.",,,

Now I live 500 miles away and my mouth is still watering for it. Bonus: it's family and group friendly.",,,

35,Jorge G.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,636,246,4.0,7/17/2012,"I was once a regular here; but I just kinda outgrew it; moved on. You can't go home again, as they say. But I had so many good times here, that's for sure. Quite a cozy joint with good prices; clever (but still blue-collar) variations on classic pub favorites and a variety of the tastiest beers. The house brew particularly is a fine choice. Lots of local people throng this bar--its not a 'scummy dive' as some of its neighbors are; nor is it 'ritzy and uptight' as many of its other neighbors are. It exists happily right in the middle between those extremes. Best 'middle ground' in Tribeca. Well-run; never any trouble.'Co-workers needing a place for happy hour' come here with regularity. The best thing about it was that nothing ever changed, really. The food was reliable and heart-warming; as were all the cute, fey, little waitresses. Just gentle darlings--never cold or abrupt; they'd sit and chat with you at length. Wan, 'actresses-someday'.One downside is it that it the ownership is grossly Republican--however this does not come out in the open all that much. Don't worry. Focus on the fabulous jukebox instead--classic rock all the way; and totally 'old school' (flip-style). You can hardly find a better jukebox for blocks and blocks in any direction. All in all: you could sit in this place for hours content and cozy, and never worry about the time passing by. What more could you ask for.",3,,
36,Lissa V.,"New York, NY",567,242,4,3.0,4/26/2012,"Great neighborhood pub in Tribeca. No frills, no attitude. They also make a great Bloody Mary (which you know earns them extra points in my book).

A decent go at an Irish bar, much like you'd expect in New York, and it's one of the more roomy bars in the area.The major selling point is the fact you get a table-sized piece of paper and a cup full of crayons to draw with! ...if you're lucky enough to get a booth. Unfortunately these are often used by THAT crowd: the group of 6 after-workers who stand in everyone's way whilst their jackets sit on the otherwise unoccupied seats they don't use. Lame.",,1,

42,George L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,27,0,4.0,1/27/2014,"Great old-fashioned NYC bar, the kind of place that used to be so common around NYC but is now almost extinct. Nice long bar with well spaced bar stools, a lot of tables, most or all of which are filled at night, very decent pub grub, and reasonable neighborhood prices. What more could you want?My friends and I have been meeting here every few weeks for years now, and we very much look forward to each get-together. We tend to go for the nachos and chicken wings and we always think they are among the best pub grub around. (WARNING: Thursday nights seem to have been reserved for the student body of NY Law College, located nearby. On Thursday nights it can get very hectic and very loud, too much for our taste, so that is the one night we avoid.)This is the kind of place that you won't know how much you'll miss until it's gone (hopefully never). It's a great place to sip the beverage of your choice and nibble on some decent bar food. Probably not worth going out of your way, but if you're in the 'hood, definitely stop in and enjoy.",,,1

Reade Street is as low key as it gets. No pretentious bouncer to deny you entry. No cover charge. No bridge and tunnel intruders. None of that is allowed here. Just good drinks and a casual ambiance. It's never overly crowded which is a nice departure from....any other bar in NYC. Once you sit down you're quickly acknowledged. When you're a regular here the chill bartenders usually ask if you want the usual, which is always nice. The drinks here are easy on the wallet.The patrons are always friendly and have no problem rubbing elbows and starting conversations with you.Good choice if you want to go off the beaten path.",1,,2

The bartender, a native of Cali, even comped me a free beer when he mistakenly gave me a pint instead of a mug. Nice touch. Reade Street Pub is the kind of place where you can rub elbows with the local cops and firemen. It's old school. And another stop on my quest to hit every bar in NYC.",4,2,4

If you got tired of Morgan's (it became Katie O'Tooles and a couple of other things in the 80's and I notice the awning in the yelp pics says Morgan's, has it never been changed?) you came here.

47,J M.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,8/17/2015,"Best neighborhood pub!  Loaded fries, a cold beer, and Chris Decker on the guitar = perfect evening.",,,
48,Kenny K.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,53,53,5.0,9/19/2013,Reade St Pub is consistently great. Love their house amber beer on tap and the food is better than your average bar food. Servers are always pleasant and conversational. Went in on a Saturday morning for some mimosas and the older man behind the bar was great. You have to love a guy who works part time as a bartender well into retirement on a Saturday morning.,,,
49,J. K.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,335,55,4.0,4/20/2013,"It's not a dive bar, really, and it's not an Irish pub.  It is just a good old-fashioned American watering hole with tons of regulars.  This is one of the reasons I feel as if TriBeCa is an actual neighborhood with a small-town feel.  I have not had the food, but have had some excellent Stellas poured by Josh, the charismatic and down-to-earth bartender.  I knocked some back with Ladder 1 and subsequently made friends with a gladiator as well.  (I am not joking.  Some guy whose job it is to be a gladiator walked in after his gladiator shift was over.)  It's a nice place.  It's REAL.  Josh told  me that it was the first bar to re-open after 9/11.  I back it.  And they also have a model train running on a constant loop through the bar.  I will have to try their food next time.",,,1
50,V J.,"New York, NY",89,346,120,4.0,2/22/2010,"* The real deal here is to get the 9$ pitcher of dark Reade Street Ale. The pitcher fills about 3-3.5 glasses, bringing the cost-per-pint to merely about 3 bucks. Its really a good deal for this neighborhood which is house to many pricey establishments. * It also offers typical pub food menu like fries, burgers, nachos etc.* The bartenders are cheerful and can engage and entertain you with the light casual conversations. Else, you can also watch some sports on its TV's. * Overall, a warm friendly bar, I really look forward to coming here frequently.",4,1,3
51,Charlie M.,"Floral Park, NY",1,44,0,4.0,4/22/2015,Nice to see a real local pub in trendy Tribeca.   Beers are a very good price.  Also a decent selection of bottle beers and drafts.  Food looked like typical pub food.  Very down to Earth bar staff.,,,
52,Martin W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,1.0,2/28/2015,The food sucks.  The cook has no idea what good food tastes like.  He must count on the clients being so drunk they cannot taste the bad food.  He cannot even make a good hamburger.,,,
53,Alex G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,3,1.0,7/16/2014,By far the worst meal i've had in the 3 years I lived in NYC. I was starving all day and only got through 1/4 of the burger before giving up. My friend couldn't finish her food either. Never again!,1,,
54,Benjamin S.,"Manhattan, NY",77,7,0,1.0,1/17/2014,Went here to meet old coworkers for lunch on a Friday. The place was mostly empty. The four of us ordered sandwiches. After 45 minutes and no sign of our food or the waitress we walked out.  Never coming back.,2,,
55,Gaby O.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,0,5.0,6/28/2012,"We got to NY after a looooooong flight from san Francisco last Thursday... it was like 119 degrees hot and had no idea where to go after checking in at the hotel. We walked down the street and there it was... The Place we called HOME during our stay in the city. The people form that place made the difference. From the waiter, to the bartenders (Poster Guy) and not to mention the guitarist, Chris,  playing the best music (Jealousy from Gim Blossoms will never be the same after listening Chris playing it).The Nachos, the burgers and the cheese stake  were delicious and the drinks were perfect! The prices were awesome too! We went back every single night before going back to the hotel and it was like getting home!When we FINALLY said goodbye it felt like we were leaving the house of this very cool uncle! We miss you guys! Gabriella and Crazy Friends!",,,1
56,Amanda B.,"Woodbridge, NJ",28,58,23,3.0,8/4/2012,I was here on a Thursday afternoon and it was just ok. A bit of a dive bar but the beer was cold and service was good.,,,
57,Justin P.,"Richmond, VA",172,136,6,3.0,3/18/2009,"This is my go-to pub in TriBeCa, especially on Mondays-Wednesdays when the pub is almost empty  Both the food and beer options are reasonably priced, the decor is decent and the bar is walking distance from my apartment. I definitely recommend ordering a cheeseburger here, which is quite delicious. The service is usually on-point and friendly. Each person who tended to my table did a good job. Overall, if one either lives in TriBeCa or happens to be in the neighborhood, I do recommend going to this pub, at least between M-W,  for a nice and relaxing evening filled with beers, food and good conversation.",4,,3
58,karen b.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",8,31,21,3.0,3/15/2011,"The bacon blue cheese burger is great and the Reade Street Ale is great but the place gets super packed at happy hour time and the space is a bit awkward. I have been at many a happy hour here and haven't even been able to get to the other side of the bar. It's great if you are going with a smaller group, but still a solid choice for unpretentious and decent pub grub in the Tribeca area.",3,,1
59,V W.,"New York, NY",6,153,0,3.0,1/2/2010,"A nice casual bar. Their beer selection was fairly limited, but their prices including their own ale for $9 for a pitcher (yes!) are a bargain.The crowd was surprisingly nice on the cold January Saturday. I don't get their infatuation with hats from NYPD, NY State Police and even ATF (the same group that is regulating your alcohol) and I personally prefer not to have televisions all over a bar, but overall it's a nice place.",,,
60,Dave P.,"WALL STREET, NY",11,17,0,4.0,7/30/2007,This local spot is a master of under-promising and over-delivering.  It is a perfect spot to enjoy some classic bar food like the amazing Reade Burger and Nachos.  They have good beers on a tap and will let you park yourself at a table to enjoy an entire football game.  This is my go-to spot for Monday Night Football games.The only reason for a 4 star rating is the lack of top quality TV screens.  There is one out-dated LCD screen in the back and a few old tubes sprinkled around.  The food and fun atmosphere more then make up for that though.,4,,2
61,John Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,140,21,4.0,9/25/2008,"You get  a real nice mix of people here. From blue collar construction guys to white collar office people and all the randoms in between. I ended up in some drawn out conversation with a drunk woman and her friend and we shared some wings. Good times. This is the kind of place you can make ""your bar."" This bar also confirms my opinion that everyone looks good in Christmas tree lighting.",2,4,
62,Mickey M.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",272,683,43,4.0,1/27/2009,One of the best burgers in NYC. Good beer choices. Fair prices. I love going to the Reade Street Pub!,1,,
63,Andy D.,"Manhattan, NY",3,37,0,1.0,9/30/2010,"Sucks balls. The only thing worse than the food was the service. I wanted to send my food back, but I couldn't find a waitress to do so.",2,2,
64,Marisa B.,"Chicago, IL",30,105,20,3.0,4/20/2007,"Went here with some friends to watch March Madness last month.  Yes, it is bar food, but guess what -- IT'S A BAR!!  Burgers were perfectly done and actually looked handmade (as opposed to the frozen patty you get at some places), juicy and thick.  Fries were almost too crispy, but I like them that way.  Beers were cold and kept coming with a smile.  Props to the one and only waitress in the place - she kept the beers filled and was fast with the food, despite the lack of waitstaff.Update: $8 pitchers of Bud Light!!!  Yes, I know it's Bud Lite.  BUT IT'S EIGHT DOLLARS!  Love this place.  Love it.",1,,1
65,Rick L.,"Woodinville, WA",1,67,4,3.0,1/23/2012,Awesome hummus plate. This is an older pub with locals and old timers...thankfully not for tourists.,,,
66,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,4.0,4/6/2007,"The pub food here is fantastic, the burger is one of the best I've had in the city. The drinks are ridiculously cheap (we're talking under 4), and the bartenders friendly. Definitely a great place to go to if you're into pub grub and a couple drinks after work, a solid old wood bar to kick back and get casual.They have some new flatscreen HD TVs, and now, it's a great place to quietly watch the games because no matter what, this area of town is never going to get that crowded, especially since the pub itself is against type compared to the upscale restaurants and lounges. It's a well lit bar with plenty of photos of times gone by, and the bartenders are fairly chatty and attentive. It's one of those places where the winter chill will cause you to look inside from the window and see that the normal lighting is fairly inviting.",1,,
67,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",184,618,2,3.0,4/1/2009,"Meh. I can't think of anything great to say yet can't think of anything horrible either.

68,Noname N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,60,0,4.0,8/19/2013,"Good unpretentious bar, not too expensive. Perfect for Tribeca - where there are not many reasonable options - home of $8 beers (Walker's tavern used to be a good choice - alas no more).

70,Erika G.,"New York, NY",58,94,0,3.0,1/24/2010,"$5 for bottled & beers on tap but they have a good selection (and some domestics are $4).

71,Juliette S.,"Maplewood, NJ",79,26,0,4.0,2/26/2013,"Fun place to go to meet up with friends.  It may be a little hard to get seats, but that's probably the same with most places!  The prices are relatively cheap - $5-6 a beer and when I went on a Thursday night, there was live music which was fun.  It was loud, but I was still able to have great conversations with my friends.  If you are looking for a laid back kind of night, I would recommend this place.  However, it is not a fancy place, so no need to dress up.",,,
72,lauren n.,"New York, NY",6,10,0,3.0,5/19/2011,Very chill and comfortable place. the food is OK but very good portion size. the only problem is the very slow service-- very very slow service. but the drinks are well priced and they have TVs all over the place playing all the exciting games. not stuffy at all! great for groups!,,,
73,Jared H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,12,5.0,1/8/2010,"Reade Street, how do I love thee- let me count the ways. Reade St. is my consistent go-to place when I have friends in town. Decor is unpretentious and authentic -- relics of the neighborhood and past/present patrons. Reade Street ale is something special. For $9 a pitcher, you get way more than your money's worth. I wouldn't recommend asking for anything other than Reade St Ale or you're likely to get a dirty look. And with good reason. The menu is solid pub food. I've had most of the appetizers at some point and can recommend them all. Just make sure you allow sufficient cooling time for the Jalapeno poppers, as they resemble little hand-grenades of mouth-scalding goodness. The spaghetti is surprisingly well-cooked. I regularly watch football and hockey games on the various tv's, and the staff is pretty receptive if you want to watch a specific game. Some tv's are better quality than others, but thats a minor point.The crowd varies widely: ATF agents, law clerks, bank analysts and locals all make regular appearances.From time to time, there is a guitarist who performs @ night. Not sure of the exact schedule but he's always entertaining and the crowd near the bar gets pretty into it.",1,,
74,Broke-Ass Stuart S.,"San Francisco, CA",575,69,3,3.0,5/13/2008,"This place doesn't lie; it is a pub and it is on Reade Street.  A mug of Bud is $3, a pint is $4 and the crowd is exactly what you'd expect it to be: after work people, locals, and the random, fat, 50 year old drunk guy who tells you how much he likes your hat and how many ""bitches he's got right now"" (you know who you are).  Actually this place is exactly what you'd expect in all regards.  They just aren't big on surprises I guess.",3,3,3

There is nothing attractive about Reade St except for the happy hour drinks, so the company you are with better be good.  If you get a chance to glance around the room, you will see the locals, random old guys, and other like-minded groups convening for a drink or two.  FYI: This is Tribeca's local pub, if you ever need to get to one.",1,,
81,Adrienne B.,"New York, NY",40,322,5,4.0,4/22/2006,Seems like a fun neighborhood bar.  Went there once when I was visiting NYC.  I would definintely go back.  My boyfriend goes frequently with friends and enjoys it.  The pitchers are cheap and GOOD!,1,,
82,Mark A.,"Chicago, IL",8,69,5,4.0,7/14/2007,"I am always surprised when people slam a pub for not being more trendy or more like a lounge.  I love pubs because they don't try to be more than they should be.  A pub should be dark, slightly grungy with fresh beer on tap and great bar food.  Nice service is a plus but sometimes surly waitresses just add to the atmosphere.  Reade Street lives up to that promise.  The burgers are really juicy and good and the beer is fresh, not skunky.  They have the requisite TVs everywhere to watch the game, which makes this a good spot for Sunday afternoon football.  Good stuff.",1,,

They don't rip you on price of drinks, the bartenders are friendly, you get a mix of area professionals, and locals, young and mature. Try a pint of the Reade St. ale, it's delicious, they should bottle this stuff and sell it. The food is decent, but the best part about the place is that it doesn't have attitude. Come in have a beer, chat it up with the bartenders (they don't forget you), toss a buck into the jukebox, sit back, and order more.",,,
