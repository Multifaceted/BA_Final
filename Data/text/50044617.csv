Updated review","Preferred the corn beef over the pastrami. The potato knish is hot, soft, comforting, and the perfect type of bland. The mustard is God-like. I will be ordering bottles. It added an incredible burst of flavor to the sandwich and knish. It was as if everything in this deli was made for this mustard. Service - Rude, confusing, and disorderly on Friday 10AM.",5,4,4
1,Justina E.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,80,45,4.0,11/19/2018,"Food is great. If you have patience for waiting in a long line at a typical tourist trap, why not? Came here drunk, and was satisfied, although I will admit the ordering process is a bit chaotic and it gets more and more crazy the later it gets. Their mustard is magic, put it on everything. We did half pastrami, half brisket and it was fantastico ~~ ALSO, REMEMBER YOUR TICKET so you can leave. That is all.",1,,1
2,Matthew B.,"North Bergen, NJ",71,21,4,1.0,11/18/2018,"Wow, never been treated so rudely at a restaurant. I went one time and we got a seat and there was no problem. This last time it was a cluster f. The employees were yelling at people. After beeing open for so long you would think they would have it down and know how to run a deli. Clearly not. We got into an argument with two employees. They don't tell you what line has what and it doesn't make sense. A employee told us we had to get in one line to get a sandwich and another long line to get fries. Say what?!?!If you want to deal with a bunch of crazy people go here.",,,
3,Marco S.,"Bellflower, CA",121,237,400,3.0,11/12/2018,"Came here for a quick snack at around 5pm. This was on our list of places to go to New York months ago.You line up and tell the carver what you want. We ordered a half pastrami with coleslaw and matzo ball soup. You pay on the way out so don't lose your ticket.The place is huge - when we were there tables were available but I guess the size goes to show that it could get packed at different times.The pastrami sandwich is good. It was also my first time eating matzo ball soup, which was ok for me.Overall I think the place is good but I also think that it's a bit overhyped.",1,,1
4,Pete F.,"Orange County, CA",302,581,1847,3.0,11/7/2018,"I'd like to know where New Yorkers go for pastrami's.  When I was there, everyone looked like tourists. I have to believe New Yorkers don't pay $24 for a pastrami sandwich, no matter how good it is.  For me, it's a once and done.  The pastrami was very good.  But we have equally good pastrami at Langers back home.  And I don't experience  nearly the sticker shock, including $7 for a scoop of slaw.  And that outdated New York attitude I can do without.  Is that intentional for the tourists or do they just really don't give a F.  The only smile I got was from the cashier.   Call me old fashion but a few smiles would be nice when I m shelling out $40 for a soup and sandwich with a side of slaw.",4,4,4
5,Amy L.,"Cerritos, CA",230,257,161,3.0,11/9/2018,"When it comes to deli sandwiches, I love thick-cut pastrami, and that is what Katz's is known for. It is definitely popular with tourists and for me, I tried it, it was OK and I probably won't be back again. My bf and I ordered a half sandwich-pastrami-and half soup-matzo ball-to share. Frankly, I've just had much better pastrami elsewhere, even in small neighborhood deli's back home. The meat lacking that smokey flavor, which in my opinion, is essential for pastrami. The matzo ball soup is just OK as well. It tasted the same as if I was going to dissolve a soup packet in hot water. Also, the butchers here either really hate their jobs or they are just plain rude. I understand some people really dislike tourists, but if you applied to work at Katz's then you're kind of asking for it? When there is a clear line in front you, it's not ok to pick out ""locals"" and Spanish-speaking customers to go to the front and order. It's one thing to give me attitude and another to not honor my place in line.",1,2,
6,Jasmine L.,"Burnaby, Canada",202,73,81,5.0,11/12/2018,"When I first saw the lineup, I was immediately turned off. I hate lines and went onto my phone to ask people if they thought the wait would be worth it. With a resounding ""YES!"" that they all unanimously replied with, so I stood in line and waited. Surprisingly, the wait was quick and I was inside within 15 minutes. They give you a ticket to pay and exit with, even if you don't purchase anything - it's how they ensure everyone has paid in the end. After entering, I was given the option to line up with cutters and I hopped in line. As soon as it was my turn, I ordered the pastrami and my cutter put a slice on a plate for me to try. I stared at it, confused, so he actually had to instruct me to ""EAT. TRY."" I carefully ate it with my non-sanitized hands (didn't love that) but I really enjoyed the pastrami and happily accepted. The sandwich itself is expensive. It bothered me that it was a wait to find out it was $24USD for the sandwich (my own fault for not researching) but it was quite large and I found the taste and quality to be very much worth it. Also - if you're paying by card, make sure you have your ID with you! I happened to have lost my wallet on the trip (ugh) and had a bit of trouble with it...",,,
7,Adrian A.,"Long Beach, CA",277,353,776,5.0,11/2/2018,"Why can't I give this place 6 stars or even 7?! This place is literally the embodiment of what a sandwich should taste like. If God goes down from the heavens to eat a sandwich, I am 110% sure he or she would eat here. This deli joint feels like a DMV from the inside with Disneyland lines from outside to their order counters. The employees are the best as well because they give this place that NYC feel, hardworking, tough looking, but very helpful. They have collection of pictures of famous people on all of their walls and that is a sight to behold. Anyway..  leggo on the food shall we...I ordered their Pastrami sandwich, which is melt in your mouth.Their sandwich is simple; a meat (which is pastrami for me) and a rye bread. Their meat feels like butter when you're eating it. I am actually having foodgasm by just describing it. Their rye bread is thick enough to hold that juicy, meaty goodness, not to mention it is best the best dough in the business, as well. My girlfriend ordered their Corned Beef, which we shared half and half. This, too have the same quality as the Pastrami, so you can nevet go wrong ordering what. For the our refreshments, we ordered their Egg Cream shake. So good, taste like a way better version of an eggnog. It is the right drink to compliment the best sandwich I ever had. Yes, I said it! No doubt about it! Overall, if I get bored, I would go to NYC for a day just to eat here.. that's how I love this place :)PS: Hey why is my picture not on those walls?! I am famous being yelp elite lolPSS: I can only dream haha",2,,2
8,Sheila G.,"Seattle, WA",433,52,196,5.0,11/9/2018,"Seriously, this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had in my life, hands down! The meat was so tender and juicy and ever so perfectly seasoned and grilled, oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it..Few tips:- Beware!! Price for one sandwich is $25 and they only accept cash in the front. Prices add up, so be careful what you order there. - Don't bother with the corn beef, so straight for the pastrami.- Don't loose your orange ticket! They will charge you 50 bucks if you loose it! - Sample the meats! You might go in thinking you want one thing, and leaving with another. That's what happened to me with the corn beef vs pastrami. - Lastly, it might be expensive, but it's so worth it! Definitely try it out.",,,
9,Jacob D.,"Providence, RI",261,127,529,5.0,11/4/2018,"Sandwiches SO good. Didn't know what to expect as I made the line on a Saturday. Lots of tourists making their patronages. But it was worth it. Wait wasn't too long even though we were wrapped around the side of the building. They hand you a ticket as you walk in (for each person). DO NOT LOSE IT. If you do they assume you got two sandwiches and two sodas which is around $50. You head to whichever cut station has the shortest line when you get in. Tip: go in to the cut station furthest from the door, generally the shortest line. You pick your meat and they give you a plate with some small slices to taste to let them know you like it.Their pastrami is what they're known for (from Instagram) and it is SO delicious. A little more fatty than the corned beef sandwich which I got as well, so that gives it a little more flavor and a leg up over the corned beef. Matzo ball soup, superb. It's a huge ball so you could probably share it between two if you're getting sandwiches. Got sides of fries and coleslaw (yum) as well. Tables have ketchup and mustard. Mustard is good. Add extra to your sandwiches. If you're paying with credit card, go to the counter beyond the cut stations.",1,,1
10,Hung N.,"Houston, TX",41,79,75,4.0,11/2/2018,There is one in Houston where I live. I have always wanted to go to the original one in New York.  We got that chance today it was an interesting experience.When you walk in they give you a ticket even if you aren't eating.  That's how they keep track of people and keep them from trying anything sneaky because you have to provide the ticket when you leave and use it to pay.  We opted to go to the counter and order directly from the chefs.  We got the pastrami on rye cuz you just have too.  It came with a pickle and a slightly pickled cucumber.  I must say it was quite good.  I added their mustard and it it spiced it up even more.  It had a great Smokey salty flavor and they pile the meat pretty high.I'm glad I was able to take this off my bucket list and they did not disappoint.,1,,
11,Andrea M.,"Chicago, IL",125,112,108,4.0,11/16/2018,"I mean, how do not go here at least once in your life? Upon walking in you will be greeted by two friendly ""bouncers."" They Will hand you a green ticket. This is your pass out so don't lose it. You will then be asked if you want to order and the counter and find your own seat or have Wait service. We chose Wait service and well...we waited. Service was definitely slow. They also make community seating so be prepared to sit by people you don't know...or may not ever want to know. More than likely they are tourists too. The place is filled with celebrity photos from their time dining there and has a cool old fashioned vibe.We went with half sandwich and soup. Corned beef, pastrami, matzah ball soup and a frankfurter because why not. It was all delicious. We paired it with a beer. I think my biggest complaint was that the bread was generic in nature and flavor. While I know the bread isn't the Star here I would have liked it to be strong enough to support my sandwich.The waitress came by our table (finally) and confirmed we didn't want anything else before taking our ticket and writing the price. She told us to pay by credit card we need to pay her. NOTE: they charge a service fee for this...that they don't tell you. We went with cash. You'll wait in line to hand over your green ticket, pay and then they will allow you to leave. It's sort of a I don't trust you to pay your bill method.PS. This place is extremely expensive. Prepare to pay $60 plus for some soup and sandwiches.",1,,
12,Renee C.,"New York, NY",475,106,179,5.0,11/4/2018,"This is a NYC bucket list destination, and it's also good as hell. When I went there, I was initially overwhelmed with the restaurant system; when you enter, they give you a ticket, and when you leave, you give them back that ticket.I ordered a pastrami sandwich; they give you slices to sample, and it was perfect. I knew I was going to have an enjoyable gustatory experience. The pastrami was perfectly warm, and the mustard was perfect. It was the best pastrami sandwich I have had in my life! They also sell these craft sodas, and the diet cherry coke doesn't even taste like diet!I'm not going to lie, the sandwich is a bit pricey ($21.95!), so it's not a place I will be frequenting OFTEN, but it is a place that I need to go to once every 2 months.",,,1
13,Amy R.,"Louisville, KY",55,183,181,3.0,11/5/2018,This is quintessential NYC. be prepared to wait!  Suggestions1.  Split a sandwich-they are HUGE (seriously like over a pound of meat on each!) Avg $32/sandwich2.  Seat yourself and order at counter - this takes less time and is part of the experience3.  Drink water - sodas are like $44.  Don't go during regular mealtimes - line can be around the block5.

15,Jason P.,"Coral Springs, FL",483,363,5039,5.0,11/12/2018,"There are certain institutions that for me define a particular dish or a food item -- one of these is Katz's Deli, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. For many of us that lived in the NY area, there is currently no other pastrami being served that deserves the level of praises that Katz's receives. It is also a deli of legend, dating back to the 19th century, and has survived two world wars and contributed to the American victory of the second, with its ""Send a salami to your boy in the army"" campaign and mail order business that that continues to survive this very day.For many who visit New York City, a Katz Pastrami on Rye is the definitive food item which represents the very best the city has to offer. It is the embodiment of culinary pride in the foods of our Jewish heritage. In my opinion, once you've visited Katz, the city becomes a part of you, and you become a little bit Jewish and a little bit New Yorker, no matter where you're from or how you grew up.",4,2,6
16,Celia N.,"Nashville, TN",35,37,165,3.0,11/17/2018,I have to say that the flavor of the meat is pretty good! And the people working there is really really nice! But after all the hype I expected a more juicy pastrami. And the cakes and pies are expensive and don't even homemade. After waiting for an hour I was a little bit disappointed. If is a great pastrami sandwich? Totally! If would I wait another hour just for it? No way.,,,
17,Saxon M.,"Carrollton, TX",211,130,285,5.0,10/14/2018,"This is the best sandwich I've ever had. Not being dramatic. Get the Reuben sandwich with the pastrami. It is melt in your mouth good. Love the character & history of this place. The pickles & cucumbers are a great addition. Btw: the ticket system is kind of confusing if you have never been here. When you walk in everyone gets a blue ticket. This ticket is where your order is written on. You have to have one to exit, even if it is blank. If you try to exit without a ticket they will charge you $50.",3,2,1
18,Tiffany P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",334,117,203,5.0,10/18/2018,"Is $21.45 for a pastrami sandwich worth? YES!After seeing the amount of reviews this place had and how expensive a typical sandwich can cost, I had doubts about this place! Ugh, I was totally wrong. This pastrami sandwich was the best I have ever tasted. Literally. The texture of the meat was just so juicy and plain, how can that sound so tasteful right? The serving was a good sharing portion if you aren't too hungry. They also serve pickles and cucumbers on the side to go with your sandwich.This place left me missing New York ;(",1,1,2
19,Katie L.,"New York, NY",251,233,532,2.0,10/9/2018,"Go to Sarge's on 36th/3rd Ave for a hefty pastrami sandwich and quintessential NYC experience! They put the deli in delicious, not Katz's.After hanging out in the LES, Katz's pastrami sandwich and a cream soda sounded like a winning combo at 4am. However, expect some attitude on the side, especially by the bouncer harassing people for tickets when they leave. A great way to swindle more money from unassuming late-night patrons, who are not paying attention to a raffle ticket handed to them at the beginning of the meal. I misplaced mine briefly, and they were not going to let me exit. I did find it stuffed in one of my pockets, but their attitude was ""Find it....or else"".The pastrami sandwich itself is fine, if a bit fatty and hardly 1-lb like they advertise. It's large enough to share with a friend, if you don't want your digestion to work overtime at the crack of dawn. Harry & Sally's table is clearly marked, to the delight of my movie fanatic friend, who made sure to sit underneath the sign. Overall ok to do once, hopefully without the bouncer exchange at the end. I still say go to Sarge's in Murray Hill all the way!",9,5,5
20,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,3.0,11/11/2018,"Katz' must be great because it's been around so long and literally everybody I know loves it. Therefore my review may not apply to all, as I do not eat any red meat. Katz' is not somewhere to go to unless you love pastrami or smoked meat.I got their turkey sandwich because there was nothing else for me on their menu, and it was bland with no toppings, and it was mad expensive. Totally understand that turkey sandwiches may not be their specialty! But considering the size of their menu and the fact there's like a hundred sandwich options, wouldn't hurt to add a few non-beef items or a better turkey sandwich.",1,1,1
21,John S.,"Washington, DC",42,62,315,5.0,11/14/2018,"When in New York, go to a Jewish deli.  We ordered the Pastrami and Reuben sandwiches.  These sandwiches are legen - wait for it - dary.  They were huge behemoths.  The Pastrami meat was cooked to perfection.  I still cannot decide which of the two sandwiches was my favorite.  This is definitely a must stop in NYC.",,,
22,Emily C.,"Queens, NY",487,79,569,5.0,10/6/2018,"Katz's is definitely an iconic spot in NYC and is so well known for their pastrami. There's usually a huge line so either come really early before the crowd gets there or come really late when it's way past dinner time. I came really late for a late night option and didn't have to wait at all. The cutters aren't too friendly, actually depends on who you are. I had a cutter who was friendly to the customer in front of me but was indifferent towards me. Once you walk in, each person is handed a ticket regardless if you plan to order or not. Make sure you do not lose your ticket since it's your way out too. Then you go up to any cutter station and order from the cutter. They would give you a small sample of the meat that you chose while you wait and then write the price on the ticket. There's a separate counter for ordering fries. After finishing your meal, you exit by handing in your ticket and paying.I tried the famous Katz's pastrami on rye and added swiss cheese. The pastrami was absolutely delicious. It was so tender and practically melted in my mouth. The mustard that they have on the table adds a nice contrast of flavor to the meat. The cheese was placed in between the cuts of pastrami which made it melt a little and tasted great. The bread was also soft and soaks up the juices from the pastrami but doesn't get soggy. They also give you 2 types of pickles; one is definitely more pickled than the other but the sourness and crunch factor is necessary.I definitely think that it's a must try spot since the meat was so delicious but it is definitely pricey. Be prepared to spend at least $25 on one sandwich.",4,1,

Server had an edge... who woulda thunk it... a NYer with an edge lol.Anywho they have the STUPIDEST ticket rule. They are killing trees to hand out ticket number. Your ticket gets written on when you pay for food. If you do t get any food, you must return the ticket. Lost tix are $50. So you order the food, someone writes on the ticket then you take your ticket to pay for the food. Why on Earth dont you order your food, pay for it and wait like other places? I have not idea.

They are a mediocre deli that treat their customers like we are bothering them for coming into their deli and expecting to be pleased. Overrated and overpriced. It was $200 for soup and sandwiches for 4 of us.  Outrageous. The portions are large, that is the one positive. We will not be back.They have this confusing ticket system that makes no sense. Each person receives a ticket when you enter. Heaven forbid you lose your ticket. The manager yelled at us and made a scene to check our pockets and find it, or we could not leave. I'm surprised you didn't have your security guards hold us upside down and shake us to find the missing 4th ticket. The ""ticket"" is not the check, we had already paid. The fine for losing your ticket is $50. What are these stupid tickets for? Totally unorganized madhouse. Overrated MEDIOCRE FOOD and an unorganized outdated ordering system. The rye bread was more of a Wonder white bread rye that falls apart, greasy broth soup (with no noodles) and a large blah Matzo ball.  Under seasoned pastrami, so-so latkes and under-brined pickles.  Very expensive too. $24 for a pastrami Ruben. They do not grill the bread on the Ruben, so it falls apart from getting soggy. The meat cutters are an unhappy looking tortured bunch of men. Don't ask questions, just order and go to another cattle line for your soup. Then another line for your drinks. Then another line for your latkes. A different CATTLE LINE for each thing that you order.

That magical crisp of the casing when you bite into the dog. Matzoh ball soup good but not as good as 2nd Ave Deli. Terribly crowded so don't expect to get in and out in 30 minutes.

I was looking forward to some New York deli fare but was astounded at how incredible the food was at Katz! I wanted a Rueben but my husband would rather eat his hand than a sandwich with sauerkraut so we asked the carver to make the sandwich half straight up pastrami & half a traditional Rueben. It was according to my husband the best pastrami sandwich he ever had. My half was scrumptious , too -- fresh soft bread, creamy dressing, streaming hot pastrami & kraut. Pickles? Perfect. Topped it off with a Dr. Brown's Cream Soda. We sat at the very table the scene was filmed and even though my sandwich was amazing I didn't ... you know.",4,1,3

Old school diner-like atmosphere, friendly employees and expensive (but huge!) sandwiches with freshly cut meat. I will agree with what someone else said since I think it accurately describes my feelings as well - ""It's delicious but I wouldn't say life changing."" We got there around 3pm and there was no line to get in, however, there were lines behind each ""counter"" inside (there are maybe 8-10 of them?). We didn't have to wait long to order though - the counter line we got in only had two parties in front of us and it moved pretty quickly. We ordered the hot pastrami sandwich ($22) that came with cheese and mustard on it and an assortment of pickles on the side. We also had an onion bagel with cream cheese and tomato ($5). There were two of us and we shared both items - it was a lot of food. We didn't even finish everything! The hot pastrami sandwich was good but typically I like my pastrami cut thinner. I also think the mustard is a necessary addition to the sandwich. It was very dry when I'd get a bite that was just the bread, meat and cheese and I was happy they had more mustard available at the tables.Overall, we enjoyed the experience and it's fun to dine in and see all the old pictures and feel like you're part of something that's remained pretty unchanged for many years in the city. However......... I will say that I feel this way because we were able to get right in, get some food and enjoy. If I had waited 45 min or more to just get in the door, I don't think I would have been as pleased. I don't think the food is THAT great that it's worth the long wait times. Just my two cents!",,,

I got the pastrami and brisket sandwich and Katz cheesesteak. Both the sandwiches I thought were way too dry and overt expensive for the size.

36,Ellen P.,"New York, NY",267,18,64,4.0,11/14/2018,"To check off your bucketlist. Worth it? Yes! When I was unemployed, I would pass this by on weekdays, and there was no line. Finally came in on a Saturday afternoon and there was a respectable line outside. Were told by fellow line waiters that it would be around 20 minutes until the door- which is not too bad. You will receive a yellow ticket which you must not lose (a $50 fee if lost). Inside is a little chaotic, where you queue behind a cutter station to contemplate your order. Pick and then the cutters will skillfully cut your meat in front of you and even give you tasters while you wait for your sandwich to be crafted. Ordered the famed pastrami on rye and also the beef brisket on rye. Portion of meat is very generous & a side of crunchy pickles! Pastrami on rye: would recommend if it is your first time as this is their most popular item. I personally am not a fan of pastrami but this one was well-seasoned and tasteful. Beef brisket: a little flavorless and dry but still good! Would probably need condiments for this one. Would not get again but not bad. Saw others getting the Reuben which looked cheesy and delish but would probably try the salami next time",,,
37,Marla F.,"New York, NY",413,122,3593,5.0,9/22/2018,Fuck yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah. I've grown up on their pastrami on rye with mustard since I was a little girl my father would bring it home from us after work in the city. BUT THE KICKER that *newbies and tourists always miss* is to ask for their pickled green tomatoes!!!Katz Sandwiches usually come with sour and dill pickles but you have to ask for the pickled green tomato. Gives that perfect acid which pairs so nicely with the fatty succulent buttery peppery pastrami. So sad that I moved. I used to live 4 blocks away from Katz's. Nothin like the smell of pickles and meat on my walk to the subway at 7:00am. The son runs it now or something cool. He's a hottie. And he's bringing this place into the new age so it's really wonderful to see Katz's integrating with other restaurants and showing up at pop-ups.,2,1,1

39,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,5.0,9/15/2018,"We came around Saturday at 12pm and the line was fairly short. They have 7 different stations and I'd recommend going to the one furthest from the entrance, which probably has the shortest line.They allow samples. I tried the roast beef, corned beef, and pastrami. Personal favorite was the pastrami cause it had the most flavor and on the saltier side. Paired with the sauerkraut and swiss cheese, it tasted heavenly. Pastrami was soft and juicy, and the sauerkraut neutralized the saltiness. It is absolutely massive though so I'd highly recommend splitting an order or you'll probably have leftovers.Heard about this place for a long time now, but it definitely lives up to the hype!",4,2,4

This is probably the second time I've had pastrami in my entire life so I am indifferent towards the flavor because I really have nothing to compare it to. The prices are outrageous! But, hey...I get it...you're a renowned delicatessen and your customers are definitely willing to pay. However, I am sure you can find something equally comparable elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. Or, make a pastrami sandwich at home!",,,1
41,Jenilee C.,"Wauwatosa, WI",111,107,68,4.0,11/1/2018,"This place is a zoo, and for good reason. We got there mid afternoon, on a Monday, thinking we'd have a short wait and I guess you could probably consider a 30 minute wait short at Katz's. They keep you moving through the line as quick as they can, to get you to the cutters. It seemed quicker for us to order at the counter than the people who were separated and waiting to be seated and order at the table. We had our heart set on a Reuben which we're familiar with the corned beef version. Our cutter was kind enough to suggest we try both that and the pastrami before we committed, and I'm so glad he did. The pastrami is WHERE IT'S AT. It was so moist (I know everyone loves that word) and delicious, it wasn't a fair fight. My mom and I were able to split one sandwich comfortable and it was served with a variety of pickles. They stack the sandwich high with meat, Russian dressing and sauerkraut. The only thing I would have changed is the option to toast the bread, as we normally do. But I'd still eat it again un-toasted. Well done Katz's!",2,,1

Updated review","Unbelievable amount of juicy meat in these sandwiches. They pack 3 large meat portions into one sandwich and slap on some german ingredients to almost perfection. The line is longer than supreme on any given day. It's expensive but you won't find another sandwich in NYC like theirs. The only drawback is that they don't have as many options as they should, but they cook their meat so well that it's perfectly fine with anyone who walks in here. It will be a very expensive trip to the deli but by far worth it every now and then. One more thing, they have great beers, coffee, and soft drinks.Very spacious restaurant, quick service, just don't lose your ticket, otherwise you'll get a hefty charge. Highly recommended for anyone who loves meat and a nice german sandwich/beer. There's a reason so many famous ppl eat here.",2,1,1

Updated review","I love deli and for me there's nothing like a great corned beef and matzoh ball soup!  To start, this place is a complete zoo! You get a ticket like you are in a theme park. Than you go and try to find a table. Ok I got my table, off to order..... My corned beef was pretty good, the bread was by far the WORST bread I've ever eaten. It's pre-sliced bread that you would find in a diner. In addition super dry, not even moist, almost like day old:( pretty horrible when I spend over $20 on a sandwich that you are craving. Matzoh ball soup was very salty, I wasn't impressed. For me, I wouldn't return. In a city filled with delicious food, I was seriously disappointed that a deli would serve up a sandwich with bread that you would feed to birds. Maybe not even.... I suggest 2nd avenue deli, saddelles or russ daughters",1,,
44,Katarina L.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",267,64,119,5.0,10/28/2018,"Coleslaw? Good. Pickles? Good. Pastrami?? GOOOOOD. Don't let the tourists deter you; this place is a gem. You get a ticket when you walk in that will get marked as you order so make sure not to lose it! You can either walk up to the counter, order there and find your own seat or you can get table service. There might be a wait but if you prefer having someone take your order and get your drinks for you, just opt for table service. If you do end up just going to the counter yourself, try a piece of the pastrami and a piece of the brisket. See which one makes you happier. They actually have a pretty big menu, like all good Jewish delis, but you should be here for one thing: the pastrami. Or the brisket. And of course the pickles and coleslaw. Oh and they make their mustard in house... There is a lot you should be here for, never mind. My typical order is a pastrami with mustard and coleslaw and a cream soda on the side. Absolute perfection. This $21+ sandwich comes on two pretty underwhelming and flimsy pieces of rye bread and will feed two, trust me. My mom is your typical Jewish lady from the bronx that moved to Jersey and constantly complains about her inability to find good pastrami. Every couple months I'll pick up a pound or so and surprise her. Go ahead, sit at the When Harry Met Sally Table (there is a sign), say the line. No judgment here.",3,2,2
45,Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",401,1407,1784,4.0,9/8/2018,"We couldn't leave NY without trying out a classic deli, and we definitely wanted to try the most famous!LOCATION: Towards the lower east side, this deli is literally on the corner of the main street so it's very easy to spot.LINE/WAIT: There was already a line out the door the moment we arrived. Once we entered, we were given tickets to hold onto (do not lose it or they will charge you), and shuffled into various lines to order our food.TABLES: You can either put your name down to have them find you a table and be serviced, that would take about 20 minutes or you can do self seating. All of the tables towards the wall are reserved for service, but the ones in the center are all self seating. My friends had me find a table for them, while they ordered my food. I recommend doing that if you're not going alone! Tables are extremely cramped, pretty difficult to find, so if you find an open table, KEEP IT.ORDERING SYSTEM: Is so CONFUSING. There were 8 cutters for the meat, so if you want just a sandwich, make your way to the furthest line the back, because there should be less people waiting. Once you order your sandwich, they will put the price down on your ticket. There's also a separate line for the drinks, if you want to try their cream sodas. You pay at the kiosk before you leave the restaurant!MENU: Katz's is known for their Pastrami, so that is at the top of their list. If you're not a pastrami person, there are other options like tri-tip or roast beef. You can order the whole sandwich, which is about $23 per sandwich, or you can do a combo of half sandwich and a side for about $19! Most of the sandwiches are pricey, but they will definitely make two complete meals.Here's what I ordered:Half Roast Beef Sandwich (3.5/5): I was so excited to try the cold roast beef, but was disappointed by the lack of flavor. The quality was outstanding, perfect medium rare, tender and juicy, but it just needed some sauce or mayo. My friends tried to put mustard in it for me, but I didn't enjoy it much. I regret not getting the pastrami instead.Small Side Salad (3/5): It was in a plastic box, I don't know how long it was kept out. The lettuce was a bit wilted, I was not too happy. I should have gotten their soup instead.Pastrami Sandwich (5/5): So this was my friend's, he had me try part of his since I wasn't too pleased with my roast beef. This was absolute perfection, nothing like any pastrami I've had back here. The meat was so tender, it reminded me almost of brisket. It was smoking and piping hot when my friend unwrapped his. Definitely worth $23! It was so much that he took the rest to the airport with us. CONCLUSION: Definitely order the Pastrami sandwich, nothing else! Don't make the mistake I made! The ordering system was a bit confusing, but I guess it's the only way to cater to large masses of customers. My friends told me the cutters weren't too nice towards them, since my friends were confused, however, they let it go. I thought they had quite an honor system going on, since you basically pay at the kiosk before you leave the restaurant, anyone could easily walk out without paying. I think they should come up with a better system, but it might be hard since they're so busy and popular!",6,4,6

We also ended up with two yuengling beers and found that it was one of the few locations in New York City where we could find Yuengling.

Cut thick and nestled between two moist pieces of rye, this is an experience to remember. It's a bit pricey at nearly $22 for the Pastrami sandwich but you're also partially paying for the experience. Their ticketing system is another thing though, everyone and I repeat every single human body, must have a ticket to not just order but to exit the premises.

It was funny when I'd see her posts or she'd see mine and we'd both be commenting, ""I was just there!"" So, on my last night in NYC, I DMed her and asked her what her plans were for the evening. She said that they were headed to Katz's Deli and I should meet her there if I were free. Indeed I was free and Katz's was only a 10 minute walk from my hotel in the LES. Sweet! I made it over to Katz's and was given a blue ticket on the way in. They asked me if it was my first time and reiterated that I needed to return the blue ticket before I could leave. Okay, sure. I greeted Fia and friends inside, then went to order my food. I got into the wrong line; surprise, surprise. The guy at the counter pointed me in the direction of where I should be.

I debated between getting a half sandwich and a soup for $18.95 but I wasn't that hungry. I figured that I could, you know eat half a sandwich at the airport so I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich. I asked for mustard on the side and the guy preparing mine motioned to the tables and said, ""There's mustard on the table."" He gave me a slice of pastrami to try and proceeded to make my sandwich. He cut it in half and added a pickle on the side. Okay, he handed me my plate and the sandwich is massive. You may want to share it or save it for next day. I sat down with my friends and proceeded to devour the massive pastrami. I am not a rye person but the rye bread they use is mild and soft. The pastrami is thick cut and tender. It's a delicious sandwich, that's for sure. I went to have my second sandwich half wrapped up to go and paid with my credit card at the same counter.

68,James K.,"San Diego, CA",492,440,686,3.0,8/18/2018,"We came because of the hype and reputation but found it to be average.  We were visiting NYC and this was near the top of our list for places to eat.  We walked in and it's not a very friendly or the most inviting place.  I imagine they are inundated with tourists.  There was a man who sort of barked at us to get in a line the very second we walked through the door.  We asked about the tables and he put our name on a list and then herded us to an area to wait for our table.  We came in for the sandwiches and ordered their classic Hot Pastrami Sandwich and the Turkey sandwich and for a side we got the steak fries.  We didn't have to wait very long before they brought out our meals.  The steak fries looked amazing and tasted just as good.  The sandwiches were stacked with the freshest meats... but that was it.  We were surprised to see dry sandwiches; no mayo, no mustard, no lettuce, tomato, cole slaw or anything atop the sandwiches.  They do have their own Deli Mustard which is unquestionably the best mustard ever to go on a sandwich.  I'm sure we could have ordered a side of mayo, some cheese, lettuce, tomato or slaw but our server was hard to flag down which is to say it was impossible.  Other than delivering our food and the check, we never saw our server.  And, unlike the photos you see online and menus, the meat isn't stacked up like the pictures.  The turkey was freshly carved from a roasted turkey.  I'm from San Diego and there is a Jewish deli out here (Milton's) that's equally as good (if not better) that Katz.  It was fun to visit such an iconic place, but for the price, I am sure there are other places equally as good in and around NYC and probably not as expensive and better/friendlier service.",1,,1

When you walk in, the overpowering and incredible aroma of pastrami hits you over the head. I queued up in line and began to place my order for the most amazing Turkey sandwich of my life.

There is so much to love about you.This staple in the LES is a must eat if you are a meat lover.I've had that reuben (+pastrami) and the macaroni salad. GUYS, the meat is tender, juicy and piled HIGH, but what was such a surprise to me was the macaroni salad. I am constantly craving it now.If the food wasn't amazing in itself, the theatrics of the whole thing make it a cool place to stop in.When you walk in you get a ticket for all your ordering needs. The place is jam packed with people (mostly tourists). You choose which meat cutter you wish to order from. Take in the giant restaurant filled to the brim with pictures and memorabilia. Watch the cuter slice your meat, taste a bite and get ready for the pile of meat you just ordered.It is truly unique and gives you a taste of old New York. The only thing to gripe about is the price tag. Get ready to shell out at least $20 for one sandwich, but at the end of the day, it's worth it.",1,,1

They act like they're doing you a favor serving you and the prices reflect that. $26.50 for a sandwich. I'm sorry, that boat don't float.

They give you a very large amount of meat and a side of a pickle. The experience is fun, with the professional meat cutters behind the counter where you order your food. Remember not to lose the ticket that they give you at the entrance, if you lose it you will have to pay a fee before exiting the restaurant.",1,,

We were a party of 14 and we all ordered something different...of course we ordered the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. We also had cheese steak sandwiches, chicken sandwiches and more. Most of the meat was on the dry side. Our overall rating of the food was average.The way you order is a bit confusing. Upon entry you get a ticket. When you order your food, you give the server your ticket and they write the price it and return it to you. The same goes for ordering sides and drinks. You pay as you exit. If you lose your ticket, you pay $50...which would have been perfect if we lost ours, cuz after 2 $17 sandwiches, sides and many beers they would have lost money! Staff was friendly and helpful when asked how to navigate the ordering system. The only time I said, ""I'll have what she's having."" is when I was asked if I wanted another beer.",2,1,1

I got in line and immediately knew what I was going to get. Pastrami sandwich on rye, with mustard. It also comes with pickles and cucumbers as well. I got it to go but you very well could eat it here - there are plenty of tables here. Oh yeah, they also give you a small plate, a sample kinda, of the pastrami to see if it's to your liking.For paying, if you are paying by credit card, you'd have to go way in the back because that's the one place that they have to pay by CC. Cash is up front. Here is where keeping that blue ticket pays off and gets you out of here.The pastrami is good. It's not too too too salty and has a lot of flavor - you'll have to taste it to experience it haha. It's made perfectly and was a welcome addition to my stomach at 8:45 in the morning haha.

80,Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",305,524,724,4.0,7/17/2018,"It's popular, crowded, loud, and kind of uncomfortable, but it is a must try.I went on a Saturday afternoon to try to hit off hours. For the record, I've tried to eat here before but Saturday night the wait was insane. It's a little confusing inside. They hand you a ticket that you have to give back on your way out (there's a sign threatening a fine if you lose it but I can't tell if it's a joke or not). You can either order at counter and find a place to sit or you can get waiter service and you can't sit in the wrong place or they'll quickly ask you to move. We were told our 2 person party would be a half hour wait but we were seated in less than 10.There's a few things on the menu, but the pastrami is a must have. They make it in house and it's like no other meat you've ever had. I got it on rye bread and a sign threatened about asking for mayo (again not sure if this was a joke) but the meat comes out SO hot and juicy and salty and succulent you don't really need any condiments (and I love condiments).They also give a complementary bowl of pickles, which is probably great if you like pickles. I also got a side of fries since it seemed like a good idea with the sandwich a) the fries were amazing too b) the sandwich is enormous so only consider if you are sharing. I only ate half the sandwich, so big and delightful as it was, then I felt kind of queasy later (it's a LOT of meat on a sandwich) then the next day I had my other half sandwich cold, and it was still pretty good. It's no fresh hot sandwich, but still close.Some cons: We got in line to exit/pay, waited until we were in the front to tell us it's cash only there and you can use a credit card in the back. Hey that would have been nice to know before waiting in line. There was very little seating if you ordered at counter, so consider that if you are trying to skip the waiter. It's also like a $20 sandwich which the highest priced non-lobster roll sandwiches I've ever eaten. But if you can come on an off hour or take it to go somewhere where it'll still be hot, oh man. It is a must try.",7,2,4

The decor, the crowdedness, the hard journey to the table while trying to secure your plate in a sea of people, the faces, the ticket system lifted the whole Katz's experience to another level.

The hype is real in terms of the fact that you get a huge sandwich with tons of meat that is very very delicious. The price is pretty steep and I will agree with some of the other yelpers --- It's delicious but wouldn't say life changing. We got there at a pretty good time, around 9am on a weekday morning and beat the line but the place was already jam packed on the inside. There are about 10 lines/counters and each of them had about 8 people in line. The seating area was packed and you are forced to share tables with others, which I didn't mind. There ticketing system is pretty interesting. You get a ticket going in and they stamp it when you get your food, and stamp it again when you pay. Then when you exit, they make sure you have paid. Wonder if that has been a real issue lol.When we were leaving though, the line was out the door and around the block. Pretty scary. I asked a person who was entering at the time, how long they had been waiting and she said 45 min... to just get to the door. Protip: Off peak times is clutch.",,,
85,Shannon H.,"Long Island, NY",207,196,1290,3.0,9/22/2018,"""Been There Done That"" type of place! Very Crowded, Disorganization to the Max, Waiter Service Wasn't Great, High Prices, Some of the Food was Spectacular! Basically a Tourist Trap. I have been hearing about Katz's since what feels like centuries ago...but I was disappointed in the pure chaotic disorganization that ensued during my visit. Walking in and it being my first time I had no idea what I was doing. They just hand you a ticket with no explanation on what comes next. Well I'm here to explain it to you: You are handed a ticket, keep it..it's basically your receipt-at the end of the meal your server will fill it out. Next you can either pick between self service or waiter service. If you choose self you walk right up to the window of your liking and order your food. After you can sit in the designated areas and enjoy it. If you choose waiter service you will need to give your name to the host... after your name has been called you will be seated on the left wall at one of the tables. If your in a small party they will shove you with another small group. At the end of your meal you can pay at the front. I wish someone would have explained it all to us but everything overall was way too chaotic for my liking. Now for the service. Our Waiter was very abrasive and wasn't friendly. I wasn't impressed with the service whatsoever. The food came in around 20 min I'm assuming because of the crowd. The Prices are high and honestly I would pay for the Pastrami again because I felt that it was worth it. I loved how juicy & tender it was and the rye bread complimented the meat perfectly. As for the Corned Beef...ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!! It was super dry and had a nasty after taste. The Chopped Liver w/ Onion- best chopped Liver I've ever had hands down!! Overall I most likely won't visit again. Been there done that! The service wasn't great and it was too crowded and unorganized.",8,2,4

88,Samantha L.,"Los Angeles, CA",785,109,295,3.0,10/15/2018,"Pastrami is good but I don't think it's worth it for the price and the amount of tourists bustling inside. I came here on a Monday for lunch in september and it was PACKED inside. 1) It is not tourist season 2) It was a monday. I wonder how busy it gets on the weekends during the summer!!!After semi pushing through the crowd I was finally able to stand in line and order. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and the butcher gave us samples of the pastrami. The pastrami was so hot and delicious. HOWEVER, each sandwich is ~$25. Granted, you can probably share the sandwich with one other person but it's not a HUGE sandwich. After you order, find a seat, and sit down with your food, the pastrami cools down a bit and it's not as good as when it's hot. Because of this, I thought the sandwich was just alright. Definitely not worth $25. Bread breaks apart super easily as well. If you come here, make sure to be in good company because the food ain't worth. In my opinion, the hype of this place is not real. Although the pastrami is good, the chaotic jumble of this place makes it not worth it. This place is more like a ""try once for the experience"" type of place.",,,

Ive seen a lot of documentaries and read lots of articles about this place and have been really excited to try it. You walk in, grab a ticket, and walk up to the ""cutting station"" where a cutter will take your order, take out the fresh cooked meat, have you sample, then cut the meat in front of you. You'll then take your food to the left, grab a drink, then sit down at a table. They will mark your ticket as you order things. YOU PAY AT THE END SO KEEP YOUR TICKET! MINIMUM $50 CHARGE IF YOU LOSE IT. YOU CANT GET OUT WITHOUT PAYING AND/OR THE TICKET. Enough hype, let's get to the food. I tried both their Pastrami and Reuben (Corned Beef) sandwiches (came two days in a row). I know this place is famous for the pastrami but the corned beef was just as good. The pastrami was to die for though! Such good flavor and cooked perfectly. The Reuben had melted cheese and their special sauce/relish spread. Totally made the sandwich next level! I didn't have sauerkraut because I'm not a big fan, but theirs was actually really good. Here just look at my pictures. It tasted better than I could take a picture of.

After you get your order, hand the ticket to the guy, he will give it back to you and you'll have to bring it to the next counter to pay. They do accept card and apple pay!

What amazes me is despite the throngs of tourists and hype - the deli is so damn good, they have not commercialized. That Ruben I got that melted in my mouth and was washed down with a can of grape soda, still melts in my mouth. Also the service is shockingly good-  look behind the counter and you'll see professionals moving like machinery to churn out orders (also so New York- we can't wait for anything!). In short: Katz's actually worth the hype, has not changed or diminished in quality and is not a tourist trap - ( just not the trap part). Classic NYC.",1,,1
97,Joanna C.,"Vancouver, Canada",161,131,248,5.0,6/30/2018,"Wow!!! To be honest, I was a bit indifferent when we arrived at Katz's, perhaps partly due to being traumatized by eating 1 slice deli sandwiches with no sauce or other filling for lunch almost everyday for something like 15 years. But this blew away my non-existent expectations. - Katz's Pastrami Sandwich: of course we had to try the classic, and it was probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The meat was so juicy, flavourful, and melt-in-your-mouth good. The layers of pastrami were twice the size of the bread that enclosed it. It comes at a bit of a price tag, over $20 for the sandwich, but they pack it with such a generous portion of mouth-watering pastrami that makes it so worth it. It's quite interesting how ordering and paying works. As we entered, we were each given a ticket, even if not all were ordering something (we shared because the sandwich was so ginormous haha). Then, we lined up at a cutter, who took our ordered, and also gave us a little sample of the pastrami! What a nice guy - free food is the key to the soul hehe. After receiving our piping hot sandwich, we claimed any open table, devoured our meal, and only as we exited, we paid. I think it's a pretty ingenious system, since it reduces the bottleneck of payment and front loads the traffic on the food preparation. That's also why everybody gets a ticket, and if you lose the ticket, you're charged a penalty (otherwise it could have been that you walked out with a free meal). Anyways, the sandwich at Katz's was amazing and it's definitely somewhere I'd come back to for a satisfying boatload of pastrami!",6,1,1

104,Mito I.,"San Francisco, CA",21,60,82,4.0,7/10/2018,"Quick Summary:- Line is long, and it depends on luck (customers order one order, but I lined up where a customer ordered four sandwiches, so the slicing took a while)- Card is accepted.- Viewing the wall and seeing ""the forever reserved table"" is part of the entertainment- The sandwich is huge, and it's all meat, even I who like meat ordered a soup side- The matzo ball soup became salty near the end- inside is crowded, so it can be a struggle to find seatingI've known this restaurant thanks to many episodes on Food Network and Traveling Channels. The ordering style is very unique. If I can provide an example, it as if I went to line up to ride in a small amusement park ride. Once you enter the restaurant, you receive a ticket and you line up in one of the many slicers, who stand behind the counter (That day, there were seven slicers). There, the slicers slice up the meat on the spot. Depending on the slicer, they will ask different questions. For my friend, she was asked a choice if she wanted mustard in her sandwich. The slicer I had didn't ask, so I needed to pour mustard on my own. The sandwich is very large, so instead only ordering a sandwich, I ordered a 1/2 sandwich with a soup side. There were three different types of soups to choose from, and I ordered the matzo ball soup. This was also a dish that one of the food stars spotted their light on. The pastrami sandwich was very delicious. The meat was extremely soft and tender. No teeth required. Just smash your lips together and the meat is cut through. It was that soft. It is good on its own, but I love mustard, so it tasted even better with the tang of the mustard. The pickles were good too - despite me not fond of anything cucumbers. The matzo ball soup was a surprise. It was good for several spoonfuls. The matzo ball was tender and it tasted like a soft and gigantic meatball. However, near the bottom of the bowl, it grew salty. I had a cup of water as my aid as I slurped, and drank another cup of water after finishing the soup.After clearing the plate, the checkout is done by either near the entrance/exit (if you have cash), or at the end of the counter of the slicers (where customers order drinks). The price is written on the ticket and the order is completed. With the ticket still in hand (with a stapled receipt) you leave the restaurant by returning the ticket. The restaurant warns to have the ticket at all times, even if you don't order. I wonder what happens if you lose it on the way?",1,,

Then you have to pick your line to get your food.  I sampled the the brisket, pastrami and corned beef.  The brisket was bad.  The corned beef was just ok.  It fell apart in little pieces and was dry.  The pastrami was great.  I was really hoping the corned beef was going to be awesome.  I was disappointed.  I tried the chicken noodle soup.  It was not like my grandmas but on a day like that it hit the spot.  I will say been there done that.  I will try other places next time I visit New York.",,,

109,Jaesung J.,"Seattle, WA",206,49,175,4.0,7/2/2018,"Overall - awesome to see what is probably the most famous deli in the world. The famous pastrami on rye was  very tender and delicious with the mild mustard that goes with it. Pros - being at an iconic spot in the culinary world and Manhattan was a great experience. The pickles were a great pairing for the sandwich - there was a traditional full sour pickle, and a new pickle. The new pickle had the right amount of pickling to balance the rich taste of pastrami. The mustard was mild enough to compliment the sandwich and not overwhelm it. Definitely a must-try in Manhattan as a first time visitor.Cons - for ~$25 per sandwich, the value is just not there to come back for a second time. There's value in having something traditional and authentic, but for a tourist with no emotional attachment to the establishment, there are many better options out there at the price range.",1,,1

Sandwich was very pricey $24, not worth the quality or amount of food. 1/5 experience. Staff is very rude and act like you are bothering them by being a patron. The man at the entrance is unnecessarily threatening, loud, and rude. Ticket system is disorganized and wait staff yell for people to get out of their way. Overall decent food at outrageous prices in unfriendly environment. I took my elderly dad here who was shoved and yelled at by staff.

114,Sacha D.,"New York, NY",93,85,430,5.0,7/8/2018,"You haven't lived if you've never had a hot pastrami sandwich from Katz's Deli. Unless you've lived under a rock, you should know this staple Jewish deli/restaurant, that raised to fame not only for their delicious juicy pastrami, but also thanks to a pretty darn famous scene with Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal from ""When Harry Met Sally"" where she fakes an orgasm and subsequently results in one of the other customers to blurt our the famous ""I'll have what she's having"" line. And guess what she was having? So here's the thing - some people may think it's over rated, that it's not worth the hype. Sometimes the crowds can be intimidating and can deter you from even attempting to go in. But oh it's so worth it. You can either wait for waiter service or go to one of the seven cutters, give them your ticket (and whatever you do don't lose that) and pick your meal. Then all you need to do is find a seat  I've done both and usually the fastest one is the ""self service"" version, but the most I've waited for a table with a waiter is 25minutes (and if you're from NYC you know that's nothing). They have so many good options but def do not skip on their hot pastrami (and keep it simple just with mustard), their delicious Reuben, and their Jewish staples. Keep in mind that a whole sandwich might be a lot, so you can easily opt for a half sandwich paired with a side - and I'd recommend you to try their Matzo Ball Soup. Can you believe my mouth is watering just causeI'm writing about it? Oh goodness - Katz's here I come!",,,1
115,Jim C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",225,150,721,4.0,6/24/2018,"Their ordering system is a nightmare. We were directed to go to Cutter #7, but he just stared at us and said to go to #6. That wasn't actually open either so about 15 of us had to merge with about 10 in line #5. So what appeared to be no wait other than about 4-5 people in each line turned out to be 30 minutes of disorganization by Katz. They are constantly telling the guests where to go, what line to stand in, and they seem to be frustrated that people don't get it. They don't get it because it's flawed. On to the food. Pastrami sandwich on rye was fantastic. Definitely a sandwich worthy of the hype. Is it worthy of the price? No. There probably isn't a sandwich that would ever be worth more than $12. It's a sandwich for crying out loud. So $21.95 is absurd. Cash only is also absurd. I get it from a business sense, but the 3-4% you pay to a credit card company has more than been covered with the outrageous pricing. Now it's just greed and another discomfort for the guest. Today's diner is looking to use Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other tech related forms of payment, and this place still hasn't caught up with the credit card movement from decades ago. The bagel and cream cheese was okay. Nothing spectacular. And the cheesecake was not work ordering again. Very dry, not creamy at all, and not made on the premises either. The dill pickles were good, but the half sours were more of a not sour at all. Also known as a cucumber.",1,,1
116,Devorah K.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,98,189,5.0,6/10/2018,Best pastrami and hot dogs ever! Do not forget the sour pickle! Can't stress how good the food is.

They meat is good, but I want In the French bread instead of  bread slide. I didn't know their extras $1, other wise I order come with it already. The sandwich very simple, just meat and bread. Very boring. I used to have my sandwich with vegetable, and sauce or mayonnaise in my sandwich. This style, is definitely is not my style of sandwich. They give you cucumbers and pickles on the side but I preferred my sandwich with cheese and vegetables instead. Their sandwich is pretty pricy, $23 for a portion of one person. I ask had their bottle tea. Kat lemon ice tea, which is pretty good. That bottle cost about $$4.60. At least now I can said that I come here. Also, they will give you a ticket, if you lost your ticket you will paid at least $50 minimum plus what ever food you ate. That insane, I saw the guy lost his ticket and he worry so bad, I didn't know what going on, I was curious. When I left she told me $50 plus the food. Also, there two kind of service, you can sit at the table that actually has someone to serve, or you can order by the stand and ask for sample.  Come here again, probably not, because New York has to many good restaurant and I want to try them all.",,,

I went for the pastrami sandwich and my boyfriend got the reuben. He finished his (somehow), but I was stuffed after eating half. I've never felt so overwhelmed by a sandwich before- the meat was extremely tender and practically melted in my mouth. We also shared the matzo ball soup which is a must try side here.Katz may be a bit too pricey to eat at regularly, but trying this place at least once is definitely an experience that is worthwhile.",,,

Katz's sandwiches are legendary and you will not be wrong with any choice--although the pastrami sandwich is a work of art! A few things to note: it's always bustling, you order your meal in a variety of lines (sandwiches in one line, fries and drinks in separate lines) and the servers update your ticket to reflect the total cost. You pay on your way out the door. Katz's has local craft beer on tap. You don't need a reservation (haha).

And this is the second occurrence of said dry pastrami. I thought it was just a one time thing. But it seems they're just consistently on the decline.

They then mark your ticket with what you order and you pay at the end. A pastrami sandwich goes for about $21 here, and it is worth it! If you are unsure of what to order you may ask for samples! I ordered the pastrami sandwich and my boyfriend ordered one of the sausage sandwiches. The pastrami dish came with pickles and cucumbers. We also ordered a plate of fries to share. The pastrami sandwich was by far my favorite. It was so juicy and tender. It was a bit oily from the fat but I definitely loved it. I ate the cumbers and pickles to cut the oiliness. It was the perfect combination. The sausage sandwich was also good but nothing special. I would skip out on this. The fries were also basic.

Food: The pastrami sandwich was the best I have ever had. Definitely, too big for a girl to eat alone though. I also shared an everything bagel with lox, which was really slacking. Dough was chewy and bland. Price: Okay, this is the only reason I have given this Deli 3 stars. I spent $20 on that stupid bagel!!!! I will always regret this !!! Lol. $20 dollars, for a bagel with cream cheese and lox? What!!! I get that this is a tourist spot, but come on, completely crazy. My normal bagel spot on WALL STREET charges $6 for the same bagel...... (and their bagel is actually good). The Pastrami sandwich cost us about 25 dollars, still completely ABSURD.

Updated review","Worth.Please come here.With over 9000 reviews and all the fame it needs, there's not much for me to say. The only beef I've had that topped this was Texas brisket. Enjoy the heap of pastrami between two pieces of rye and nothing else (other than cucumbers and pickles). I love the concept--the entire show is on the pastrami.Otherwise, portions are huge, so be mindful. Ordering can be confusing, and lines can get long, so ask before you waste too much time.The matzo ball soup is also pretty good. Reminds me of the Chinese meatballs from my childhood, but much softer.

Katz is dead, it may have well turned itself into a Times Square dive tourist trap.  You enter via a bouncer and then stand in line to order from the counter.  The sandwich was overpriced and completely underwhelming; I have had better at my local deli. Stale bread, bland mustard, and overcooked pastrami.  Only saving grace was a half way decent overpriced matzah ball soup.  Overall a sad experience I would not recommend to anyone.",,,

My friend didn't believe me and ordered a combination platter of brisket, pastrami, and corned beef. Guess what happened? We inhaled the pastrami. Ended up packing the rest to go. You could order at the counter and ask for samples before you commit. It's usually very busy though so it's not exactly a relaxing place to ponder the big decision. If you don't feel like scouting for your own table, you have the option of getting table service. The only thing is you don't get to try samples but a great option if you want to sit, now. If you are feeling adventurous, the liver is very good as well. Get it from the cold-cut counter by weight will save you a few bucks.",,,

Everyone was at work so there was no crowd or much of a wait. Located about a block from another famous Jewish deli so we just came here the next day after going to that one.Be sure to grab one of the tickets the ""security guard"" hands you when you walk in. Don't lose the ticket because that's how they keep track what you ordered and how they charge you when you pay for your food. As you walk up to the counter, it's just like you seen them on t.v, staff working the meats, asking next person to step up so they can get their food, employees talking smack to each other etc. Be sure to read the signs above each counter as sandwiches are over here, and if you want other items, it's over there.  We decided to get the popular hot pastrami sandwich and a bowl of their matzo ball soup. As they are making your sandwich, they gave me a slice or two of the pastrami to taste, it was very good!!! Staff dude was real cool, only took him a few minutes to fix up my order. Pastrami sandwich was what I hoped it would be, super flavorful, peppery, super moist, meaty & fatty at the same time, and they gave a pretty good amount of it on your sandwich. They only put mustard on it, so that was fine with me. Yea, I can see why this sandwich is so popular, it was pretty darn good!  Matzo ball soup was very good too, Jewish mother's chicken noodle soup and it totally hit the spot! You get a huge matzo ball, it was very good being so light & fluffy, soup itself was tasty as well. We killed this as well! I'm assuming if you order a sandwich, it comes with a side order of their pickles, those tasty little briny cucumbers were very good as a side and they know you can't eat a sandwich without a pickle to chew on too. After you get your food, go sit down wherever, the spot is marked where When Harry Met Sally was filmed, in case you desire to sit there and have an orgasm. Celeb photos all over the wall so be sure to check that out.  Prices are pretty expensive, especially their sandwiches, they can be up to $20 - $25 for a sandwich. Yea, I got the same reaction too! Glad we came by to check it out, have a delicious sandwich and visit this NYC landmark.",22,15,18

There's often a line to get in, but they do a great job manning the line and it does move quickly. As diners enter, iconic images of the past and memorabilia/merchandise are shown. There are also several lines customers have to go through: the cutters (for sandwiches and soups), the sides and drinks, and the cashier (when you exit). The sandwich consists of lean yet fatty pastrami and (Dijon?) mustard sandwiched by two slices of rye bread accompanied by regular pickles and slightly pickled cucumbers! The matzoh ball soup has an interesting texture - tastes like meat but it doesn't contain meat. The soup base tastes like cup noodles tbh LOL. The fries (potato wedges) are pretty good, but not amazing. I prefer a crinkle cut with a bit more salt.

They give you a ticket right by the door and you must not lose it unless you want to pay a hefty fee. They write the total of your purchases on it as you go along and it's how they know how much you owe at the end. I already knew what I wanted when I went up to a cutter, but he still gave me a sample of the pastrami I'd ordered while he was making my sandwich so I'd know what the meat tastes like by itself. It was steaming hot, juicy, tender goodness. I got a pastrami on rye with mustard for $21 and it was totally worth it. I almost left the counter without the included pickles, that's how much of a hurry I was in to get to a table.The sandwich was a heaping mound of freshly carved pastrami between two thin slices of bread with just the right amount of mustard to give it a bite. It was obviously on the salty side, which is just what you need sometimes. It was so satisfying, and I had no room for sides or desserts. I washed it all down with Dr. Brown's root beer, which was a great complement to the meal.The walls are covered in pictures of somewhat recognizable people, and they sell merch.

162,"Frequent Fryer, T.","Los Angeles, CA",233,36,36,1.0,8/10/2018,"Katz's Deli: An icon of NYC's Lower East Side and a tourist destination for many film- and food-lovers that some fans argue should finally be declared a landmark after 130 years of business. Katz's has stood through two World Wars and plenty of radical changes, but is still serving up kosher-style (not actually kosher, notably) meals for anyone who shows up to eat them. And for some reason, people keep showing up in droves. What you see is what you get at Katz's, and I'm pretty sure that's intentional. There is plenty of signage meant to avoid confusion, including the famous façade ""Katz', That's All!"" and the interior declaration that they have ""no connection with any other store."" There's the dangling banner noting the table Where Harry Met Sally, in case you're planning a kitschy photo between rush hours. There's a row of meat cutters ""waiting"" to take your sandwich order, but these meat artisans won't hold themselves back for something as menial as ""your final answer,"" so study up before coming. Surely, The Frequent Fryer is not the target audience for this famous pastrami shop, but apparently their quality is good enough to warrant extensive international orders to fans and fatigues worldwide, so make sure to ""Send a Salami to your boy in the army"" if you think they'd enjoy it. On top of the controversial ticketing system (which, to Katz's credit, is clearly explained and displayed), there is a lot to take in for first-time diners who've only heard the name or seen the Deli on the silver screen. But, like I always say...None of that matters. Let's get to the fries!Katz's Steak Fries, That's All! These fries are certainly...wide. Each plate is $6.95, and the fries are piled on in spuds, I mean, spades. But, any portion will look big if you put a small plate underneath. Nevertheless, the steak fries are quite chunky and generously cut. Steak fries have a unique quality when being cooked: since their surface is so expansive, one side could easily be cooked to a crisp while the other could be left unexposed to the oil and raw. That lack of caution was definitely the culprit here, as seen on the thawed-out raw fry in the left side photo. The consistency of the whole batch is a mixed bag: you might have some enjoyable crunches, or you might get weak crumbly potato flesh, often both in the same fry.You won't need to wait in any of the Cutter lines to get your fries, in case the staff doesn't tell you that (and they won't). You can pick them up straight from the side counter: room-temperature and unsalted. Don't worry about waiting long for your sandwich in case your fries get cold: they've never been hot! It's hard for me to accept that, with no line for the grill at all, old fries are served to customers. Maybe the regulars know to avoid these $7 sides. Maybe that's why Katz's fries are ""famous.""There is a tiny bit of taste if you search for it, despite any emergency salt or sauce you use to salvage your plate. The raw potato portions just taste like raw potatoes, of course, but the crispy ends retain the oily taste from their frying. So that's something. Bland isn't a strong enough word to describe my experience.The Frequent Fryer almost never regrets ordering fries. But at Katz's Delicattessen, don't have what I had.Final rating for fries: 1/5 Spuds.",3,2,2

I was in town for my friend's wedding, and also did some food adventures to taste what people say are the must eat items in NY. I definitely don't want to miss out on the opportunity of tasting what people called the King of Pastrami Sandwiches! When I first walked in, I was handed a ticket. Having done no research ahead of time, I just held onto the ticket and didn't know what it was for. I went to one of the cutter who was open (found out later that he was the same cutter as Mark Weins in his video!!) and ordered my pastrami sandwich. I was shocked by the price of the sandwich ($23) but knowing I traveled 3,000 miles to here, I'm going all out. I was excited as I can be since I felt like I was in one of the youtube food shows. Everything in the restaurant is as expected. My cutter took out a giant piece of pastrami and started slicing. He sliced two small pieces and put them on a small tasting plate and told me to have a taste while he sliced the rest for my sandwich. The pastrami is so HOT it burnt my finger, but omg it was so soft and tender, and salted to perfection. I watched him sliced the pastrami and it was a work of art. Each pastrami sandwich is paired with some pickles, one type is more cured than the other. My cutter asked for my ticket and he filled out what I ordered.The pastrami sandwich is gigantic with several layers of melty tender goodness. I tried to take a bite of my sandwich without it falling apart since the meat was about to just disintegrate. It was the juiciest, meatiest, tenderest sandwich I've ever had in my life. It was flavorful without being too salty. I also like how there are bits of tendon in the pastrami. I love it. The slightly sour and spicy mustard paired perfectly with the juicy sandwich to cut the fat from being too oily. I loved the fresh pickles, just slightly salty and sour! I couldn't finish the whole sandwich so I took it home to my family to try. They have a wrapping station where they will wrap all of your unfinished food to perfection. My family loved it as well! Definitely worth a try whenever you are in NY!",2,1,2

I asked the counter help what was their top selling sandwiches and he replied pastrami and brisket. So my friend and I decided to order one of each and we split our orders so we could try both.

They gave us two different brined pickles, I liked the two varieties. The meat on the Reuben is savory, meaty and scrumptious.

Yes, sandwiches can be upwards of $25 but don't worry you can easily split it between 2 people, as must do. And they have other options as well like a frankfurter for a few bucks. Either way order something, find a seat, and just take it all in. The lines move quickly so don't get discouraged. I got the Reuben with pastrami and cheese added. They give you a bunch of pickles on the side as well. And if you're lucky, they usually give you some slices of meat to try while you're ordering.

Although it was confusing to order at first, I was able to put in my order almost immediately once I figure out how to order. Fortunately, there were a lot of tables still open. They give you a ticket as soon as you enter the building, and they tell you to keep that ticket until you exit the deli. After you place your order, they will mark on the ticket what you ordered, so when going to pay at the very end, they will ask you for the ticket so they can charge you. If you want to pay cash you heads towards the front. They do take credit cards but you have to go towards the rear to pay for a credit card. It's that simple guys!As for their pastrami, this is truly not your ordinary thin sliced pastrami with cheese and mustard. Here you'll get a very thick and juicy cut slices of pastrami with mustard on rye. The pastrami has a nice smoky flavor and some fat to help enhance the flavor of the pastrami. Most people share this, I don't really need to share. I'm a very greedy person. We also ordered the corned beef on rye. Never been a fan of just Corned beef, should of ordered their Reuben. For sure next time. Because there will be a next time. They also hook it up with a little plate of pickles. If you're really intimated of this place, they also have tables reserved for waiter service. There you can just take a seat and a waiter will take your order from your seat, if that's your type of thing.",6,3,3

Personally I'm not a big sandwich person but if you're looking for a protein-filled meal this might be the perfect place for you.You can sample the meats before you order your food. (Might as well) And the hot sandwiches basically comes with your choice of meat (seems like ~2lb of meat), two pieces of rye bread, and pickles. Me being a veggie fan, wasn't very happy about this... and their sides are OVER PRICED. Honestly I felt like the sandwich was overpriced too.We sampled the corned beef, pastrami, and brisket. Being from Texas, I'm used to the moist tender bbq so I felt like all the meats were dry and none stood out to me. My friend liked the corned beef so we ended up choosing that oneOverall I think my favorite thing about this place was their mustard sauce... Hint 1: don't loose the PINK entrance ticket they give when you enter, they might charge you $50Hint 2: if you're visiting don't be intimidated by the crowd - if you want to be seated faster - opt to find your seat and order food upfront yourself instead of being served by the waiterHint 3: They do take credit card if you go to the back section where you order drinks - up front is CASH ONLY",1,1,

We ordered a pastrami sandwich since that's what all the buzz was about and it did not disappoint. The meat was so so tender and juicy and flavourful.. and fat (I could've appreciated less fat but I guess that's what makes the overall sandwich so flavourful). The sandwich was generously overflowing with pastrami and it was super filling. I loved the complimentary pickles on the side which was a nice refreshing textural and palate change when the meat sweats started to get to me.

I never knew how good and fresh a pastrami sandwich could be until I came here and tried theirs. With the price you are paying for this sandwich I would only hope they give you enough meat. To me the price was a bit over the top considering it's a pastrami sandwich but Understand it is new york and meat isn't cheap lol. However if you want extra toppings added like lettuce and tomatoes it does cost more so be prepared to spend at least around $20-$30 maybe.

Upon the arrival of Willy Katz in 1903, the name of the store was officially changed to ""Iceland & Katz"". Willy's cousin Benny joined him in 1910, buying out the Iceland brothers to officially form Katz's Delicatessen. Their landsman Harry Tarowsky bought into the partnership in April 1917. Katz's Deli was moved across the street, to its present location, during the construction of the subway system. The vacant lot on Houston Street (pronounced ""House-ton"" after a Dutch emigrant of the same name) was home to barrels of meat and pickles until the present storefront facade was added between 1946-49."" - Katz's Deli ""Our Story."" NARRATIVE:After returning to Manhattan in December 2017 from Staton Island, via the Ferry.  My family and I decided to grab some lunch before we continued exploring NY. Being only 10 degrees outside.  We also elected an Uber ride instead of walking or other public transportation.Arriving in the Lower East Side in only a few moments.  I could tell we arrived at Katz's when I could see a long line which started at Katz's front door and extended down the block. The wait time from start to finally getting inside Katz's was a fairly quick.  Once inside, the heat was warming.  The employees / carvers were busy and hard at work and, the smell of fresh pastrami was captivating and had my nostrils break dancing.EVIDENCE:I ordered a classic Pastrami on Rye with, the signature pickles.  The meat was basically a two to three pound brisket piled high on my rye bread.  No other condiments came on sandwich except for the pickles the side of the plate.After finding a place to sit, I squeezed a tiny bit of yellow mustard between my sandwiches meat and bread and, I took my first bite.  After a long chewing session.  I took in a deep breath then, exhaled it slowly.  All while letting out this long and loud sigh.  I did this not because my sandwich was that great (but it was).  It was done to get my mind and stomach ready for what I knew was going to be a struggle.  You see, even after taking that huge first bite.  What I did didn't even put a dent in this humungous beast called a sandwich.Even with all its greatness, I could only finish one half of my sandwich.  The second half was taken back my the hotel where It was enjoyed as a midnight snack after consuming a few Jamisons.RECOMMENDATIONS:Katz's Deli is a MUST see and do.  Even if its just to see for the history, memorabilia and nostalgia.  I can't speak to all but, my pastrami sandwich was well worth the cold weather visit and wait.  I highly recommend a visit and taste for yourself.",4,5,6
180,Vicky N.,"Falls Church, VA",1267,125,1527,5.0,4/9/2018,"Ever since I had my first pastrami sandwich in Philly, I had been DYING to try Katz's Delicatessen! Boy, was it everything I dreamed about and more!Established in 1888 and located in the Lower East Side, Katz's Delicatessen has made a name for itself in New York City. While the $20 price tag is hefty for a sandwich, I have to say that it is indeed worth it. In fact, I was so impressed that I ended up coming back the very next day! Upon entering, you receive a ticket that you must hold onto in order to avoid paying a fee of $50. The ticket allows them to track what you order while you're inside the restaurant. You then proceed to one of their many counters to order. I ordered their famous pastrami sandwich which was listed under their hot sandwiches for $21.45. Before they begin assembling your sandwich, they offer you a sample of the meat which I thought was great! The pastrami sandwich was absolutely amazing and HUGE, might I add. If you're concerned about the price, I definitely recommend getting a few friends together to share. My friends and I (group of 4) had no problem splitting a sandwich. The pastrami was ridiculously flavorful and super tender. I was not expecting it to pack that much flavor at all! The mustard also complemented it very well. I am heading back to Katz's on my next trip to the big apple!",4,1,1
181,Charles A.,"Manhattan, NY",346,24,4,3.0,10/30/2018,"Portions are freakishly enormous and pricey -- plan to SHARE a corned beef or ruben with three others and leave with a full belly!This is a classic icon of NYC and where ""Harry met Sally"" -- so if you're a tourist, you gotta go!  If you're on a budget, get a frankfurter -- they're 100% beef and only $1.50 (well, they were $1.50 when I wrote this!)DO NOT LOSE YOUR MEAL TICKET!  Without it, you have to pay $50!Note: If you're Jewish: Katz's is not truly kosher -- you can get milk in your coffee, cheesebuegers, ruben sandwiches, etc. so just a word of warning.",,,
182,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,204,100,4.0,5/17/2018,"This has been on my list for forever, as it is a New York classic. I feel like I've put it off for such a long time, so when my sister came to visit, I decided this would be the best time to go--when a tourist was in town! I think that I was worried that this place was a tourist trap, would be overpriced, and wouldn't taste great, but I was wrong!We came on a wed for lunch & the place was filled with both tourists and locals. We ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye bread to share--we asked for two extra slices of bread so we could take some of the meat from the original sandwich to make another sandwich. There def was enough meat on the sandwich to make two large sandwiches!! The meat was juicy and tender, fatty but not too fatty, and had a great smoky flavor without it being too salty. I absolutely loved it!I definitely would return to try the matzo ball soup--I saw some people who ordered it & the matzo was huge and smelled amazing!",1,,
183,Dave S.,"Pacifica, CA",215,94,0,2.0,10/9/2018,"There was a time when Katz's was the ne plus ultra of pastrami on rye, but those days are gone. Last night was the third time in a row that their sandwich has disappointed. The meat itself is low in flavor and fatty--not in the good pastrami way; more in a ""tough to chew"" way. The pickles are cucumbery, rather than tasting, well, pickled, and the rye bread is bland. I think the place has succumbed to its status as a tourist trap and has just stopped trying, favoring quantity over quality. Charging nearly $25 for a sandwich this mediocre is criminal.",3,,
184,Dana L.,"Irvine, CA",400,74,62,5.0,4/20/2018,"I know this is a super hyped tourist destination and for that reason I wasn't super stoked about going to this place as I knew that the lines and the prices would be over-the-top high. That being said, once I got there and got through the masses of people and the insane lines that we experienced at 1PM on a Saturday, I was not disappointed. I ordered Katz Pastrami Hot Sandwich which came out to about $22. This is a hefty price tag, but this sandwich is piled about 2.5 inches high with fresh, hot, delicious pastrami. It was definitely more than large enough to share with another person. I ate only half of mine and I was extremely full, so if you split it with someone the price isn't too bad. I got mine with swiss cheese, mustard, and mayo on the side. It also came with a side of pickles and cucumbers. Honestly, (much to my surprise because I don't really like sandwiches) this place was one of my favorites on my week-long trip to New York and I would say it is a must try! Don't let the lines or the tourists scare you away! Also, they have a part of the store where you can send salami home to your loved ones (or yourself.. I'm not judging), so if you're looking for a unique gift you can check that out.",2,,
185,James V.,"San Diego, CA",572,67,48,4.0,9/6/2018,"Meat was pretty good. Quantity is enough and you definitely get satisfied. However, I didn't think it was all that amazing. Wasn't what my friend told me ""top 3 things i ate"" kind of meal. Definitely worth the try, and you get to taste separate meats. But the butcher wasn't all too easy trying to cater to us tourists asking for some help with food choices. I wish I got the toasted buns and maybe added cheese. But I didn't know they were an option, sadly, due to lack of customer service. Prob won't be back but was good. 22 bucks for a sandwich essentially didn't really make me smile.",,,
186,Ian H.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",3,7,8,5.0,9/18/2018,"Lived up to every expectation. Went early to avoid lines and we ordered corned beef and pastrami, both fantastic and highly recommended.Don't ever change this institution as it is amazing!!A must for any New York visit",,,
187,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,4/8/2018,"My pirate friend suggested we go here; despite being born in NY it was my first time. I honestly had begun to think of it as a likely over-rated tourist destination, the lines were off-putting, I didn't care about sitting in the When Harry Met Sally booth, etc. But they serve a quality product! Me and the friend split a pastrami sandwich and it was delicious. Splitting is the way to go, as the portions are massive. The bread to meat ratio is off, the bread could really be sliced thicker. The meat is fatty, you will feel your arteries clogging as juice drips off the sandwich and down your fingers. There's a reason the drunk masses pile in from the bars. But it's still delicious. I still think Harry & Ida's is better, but their sandwich is even pricier and comes with a smaller portion. Besides, this place is old NY charming. Steak fries can be skipped. Instead, get their coleslaw. This might just be the best coleslaw I've ever had. They put freakin horseradish in there- YES! And it's buttermilk based. I wanted a second portion it was so good, I'd come back just for this. The dining area is large, brightly lit, cafeteria like. You're given a ticket (in our case by someone who was a dead ringer for Prince Akeem from Coming to America, outfit and all) which you must not lose. The ticket is how you pay, if you lose it they just charge you $50. Which is close to what you're going to pay if you get two sandwiches, sides, and drinks anyway. It keeps the ordering line moving. You order your sandwich first, they give you a little sample of the meat to try while they prepare it. Then as you move down the line you can order sides, drinks, get silverware, and beer. You pay on the way out by showing your ticket.",2,1,2
188,Ysabella G.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",131,33,33,5.0,10/29/2018,"The line organization and crowds makes it wriddled with anxiety and frustration but the food and friendly service make it sooooooooo worth itttttt. I got a pastrami with only mustard- keep the good quality ingredients simple- and on club bread instead of rye since I'm not a rye bread fan. Unreal!!!! The meat is so tender, perfectly fatty and like butter!!!!! They give you a few slivers of the meat while they prepare your sandwich in front of you. It's not a cheap sandwich but it's very very worth it. Go!!!!!!",,,
189,Elijah M.,"Madison, WI",693,115,1,4.0,10/9/2018,"I almost feel bad about this, the hype was so massive, and everything I got was good, but like 8/10 good, not 10/10 life changing good. Overall, great vibes, real oldschool place. Samples are freely given and quite good. I found the bread and mustard to be above average, the meat was well above average, but not the very best I have ever had. The pickles were fantastic, best part of the whole thing. Its a little expensive, but not for the neighborhood.  Next time I am in the area, I will go to Russ and Daughters instead, unless I realllllly want pastrami.",2,,
190,Gabriella R.,"Atlanta, GA",15,102,362,5.0,4/2/2018,"This spot could not get any better than it already is! A total NYC classic! The staff is absolutely superb! Our waiter was absolutely hysterical. He made us laugh and cry! Truly amazing. Visiting New York can always be bittersweet since my fathers passing, but visiting his old stomping grounds brings a smile. Our waiter gave us jokes, wisdom, and joy on our trip. Getting a variety of everything is a must when you come. Order a knish, split a sandwich, have some soup, order a drink, DO IT ALL! You won't be disappointed. Just thinking about all the food makes my mouth water. The pickled items are divine! If you love green tomatoes, prepare to be addicted! Don't miss out on this classic Jewish deli, it is a New York must! P. S My Mom really wishes you guys would get some visors in your apparel line. Haha, but seriously.

192,Clara W.,"Birmingham, AL",148,116,210,4.0,3/31/2018,"We discovered the place by accident. We were on the observation deck on the new World Trade Center and used the iPad to identify some landmarks, and this restaurant popped up. We read the history and decided to give it a try. We walked about 1.3 miles from our Hotel (Hampton Inn SOHO) to the Deli. It was SO crowded. From the previous review, we decided to order their featured sandwich Pastrami. You place the order in front the person cutting the meat and he gives you a piece of meat to munch on while he is cutting. The meat was really good and I see why it's famous. The sandwich is huge! We order two for three of us and we could not finish it. The meat is at least one inch thick. It came with pickled cucumber and picked green tomato. The sandwich has no vegetables. I know some reviews complained about the price of the sandwich. It cost around $21 for the sandwich, but you really have to share between two people and it can make both people full, so $11 each not bad too bad. If you are not a big meat eater, you can buy one sandwich to share between three or even 4 people. You can also just buy the meat and make your own sandwich. Overall, the meat is very good and pretty healthy and I feel it would be good with a cold beer. We did not order other stuff, like fries etc. They also have soup that we didn't try.",2,1,3

I will admit I was a little disappointed in the pickles, but not enough to take away a star.  We also tried the hot dog and a original potato knish, both of which were really good as well.  Come at a slightly off time like a 3 or 4pm lunch to avoid crazy crowds.  You can do table service or order from the counter and seat yourself.  You can even sit where ""Harry Met Sally.""  This is definitely a spot that everyone needs to visit at least once.  I will certainly be going back again.  Make sure you don't lose your ticket!",,,

197,Daniel P.,"Tallahassee, FL",285,747,4550,5.0,3/12/2018,"1. My review here is senseless, as neither it nor any of the Yelp reviews are necessary.  You're not reading this to mull over the merits of coming here - you're just reading this out of sheer boredom.2. Of COURSE you must come to Katz's Deli - and you must order a pastrami sandwich, a Dr. Brown's soda (I'm a Cel-Ray fan) and half-sours.  If you're feeling extra frisky, maybe get yourself a chopped liver with onion side.3. Everything else I could say would be just for the sake of typing - you KNOW you're going to come here if you can, so what's the point.4. Don't bother googling up other deli's because you're trying to ""stay away from the tourist traps"" - there's a reason this is on the map - for locals and tourists alike (remember, VERY few folks in Manhattan are ""locals"" as one would normally think...).  You find a better Pastrami.  Go ahead.  Let me know about that.  Until Katz, I didn't even like Pastrami, because it was the same-ole, same-ole that you find in grocery stores, sandwich shops across the country.  Katz's Pastrami is phenomenal.  So... - that's all I have to say about Katz's (don't forget, however, to stop in to Russ & Daughters' right around the corner, because Appetizer shop is different from a delicatessen).",6,4,6
