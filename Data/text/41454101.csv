0,Gaby S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,3,3.0,9/20/2018,"Local sandwich deli, close to one of the offices that I work with , so on a few occasions we ordered lunch and pick it up . It's hit or miss, depending I guess of who's working that day and if you can get through on the phone to get someone to take your order.",,,
1,Mike M.,"Manhattan, NY",259,468,388,1.0,11/28/2017,"I work a few blocks away from this ""deli"" and figured I'd give this place a go since according to heir signage they would be open. It was 10:30 AM and the sign said they opened at 9 AM. First thing I noticed when I walked in was they were pre-slicing their cold cuts which is usually a bad sign. Food should be prepared when you order to maximize freshness. That means when you order your Italian hero at lunch they probably used meats and cheeses that have been cut hours before. Subway pre-slices their meats and cheeses but their prices are at least half that of Fresco's. Nearly $11 for a whole hero without a soda or chips.My problem was that I should've turned around right then and there but I decided whatever. I figured their bread would probably make things better but it wasn't that typical Italian bread you'd get with a hero but some kind of steamed bread/public school cafeteria bread. Cheap and tasteless.Overall the sandwich was just ""meh"". Cheap and tasteless. Go to any other deli in the area and you'll get better for your money.",8,4,6
2,Melissa V.,"Jamaica, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/24/2018,LOVEEEE all the food options and the staff. No matter what you're in the mood for I'm pretty sure they've got it. Also the prices are pretty decent considering it's in the city and there is a college nearby.,,,

4,Roksolana K.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,74,16,5.0,4/23/2017,"Came here when I was in town and needed to grab a quick lunch. I ordered the chicken teriyaki wrap. Absolutely delicious! I can't say that I've been to any other delis that offered a chicken teriyaki wrap, and I was quite pleased with my order. It cost me less than $7, which is amazing since I usually end up paying close to $9 for a sub-par wrap elsewhere. Highly recommend this place",,1,
5,Manuel M.,"Manhattan, NY",34,6,0,1.0,5/11/2018,"Burgers are decent... very Burger King-ish (in a good way). But, DO NOT ORDER A CHEESESTEAK from this place. Or anything else really. It is insane how clueless these guys are. The workers are rude. The delivery insists on only delivering fountain drinks that spill all over the place. Am pretty sure the Hospital across the street is the only thing keeping them in business. Do yourself a favor and just go to any diner a block away.",,,
6,Tyrik G.,"Bronx, NY",317,111,32,1.0,12/14/2017,"WARNING FOOD POISONING ALERT!!!!I just want to start with this.. this place needs to be shutdown and inspected by Ecolab or someone that inspects food places. I went here last week on Thursday (12/7) at approx. 12:45PM for my lunch. I went in and ordered for a chicken bacon ranch panini. But to my surprise when the guy brought my expected panini from the oven, it was on some green spinach wrap, which i did not asked for. So by time the other guy was about to add lettuce and other fillings, I had to stop him and tell him the guy who took my order and put it in the oven, did not give me what I asked for. So the first guy takes my sandwich, and gets mad and takes it from the other guy behind the counter sandwich station. He goes to the other counter where the oven is at and as he fixing it, he keeps looking back at me, trying to make sure I'm not looking at him. He does this three times. I didnt think much of this, until later that night and into the next day (Friday) where I start to feel like my stomach was upset. It went all went downhill from there when I got home from work that day. The Saturday (12/16) I started getting bad stomach pains which ran me to the bathroom with watery bowel movement. The pain was so excruciating, I had never felt pain like that in my stomach. It was really bad that Saturday and Sunday. Lasting into this Monday the pains were still there and had just began to start to settle down. I recommend that you dont go to this place if you're in the area. It is really not worth it as you can tell from the multiple bad review. Especially since they gave me food poisoning, I will never be back. They need to be inspected and recordings from that day/time need to be looked at, because there was something done to my sandwich that day. Someone needs to look into this...this is very unacceptable. I hope no one else gets sick from this place.",2,,
7,Alexis T.,"New York, NY",131,67,140,1.0,12/23/2017,"I've been coming here since I was literally a baby. I've grown up with this place when it used to be called blimpies now it's frescos. A few of the employees are nice but majority are just rude. You can come in with a smile on your face, be polite and give them your order and they still will give you the wrong order. They listen to your order and give you whatever they feel like when it comes to sandwiches. I've noticed lately when I walk in I've been charged differently when it comes to getting a bacon cheese burger and fries. Sometimes I'll be paying $14 and sometimes I'll be paying an even $20. They have new people working the registers that don't even know what they are doing. Yesterday I witnessed a new guy right in front of me making my sandwich wrong. Today someone got me food there and they of course messed up the order. And it was pink in the middle. I've completely had it with this place. I've had rubbery grilled chicken in my salads, cold burrito bowls, and messed up orders. I will never eat at this place again.",,1,
8,Denise C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,26,9,2.0,5/17/2017,"This place is usually my go-to spot when I want lunch. I always order a vegetable burrito with some fixings and it never disappoints. Today they really disappointed me when they came 30 later than they said they were (it's funny because they are only 2 blocks away from my workplace). Since the food was not here on time I decided to call them but they just hung up on me three times!Once the food finally arrived I started inspecting the bag: the chips I ordered were stale, the guac recipe changed and is super watery and not like guacamole, and the burrito was sad looking. The burrito should have had peppers and onions and other vegetables added (since it was a vegetable burrito) but instead it was rice, pinto beans (even though I asked for black beans too), and pico de gallo. It was also the skinniest, saddest burrito ever. Even though I've ordered here so many times and enjoyed my food, I don't think I will be ordering from here again.",,,
9,Maria V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,3,1.0,10/17/2017,"I'm allergic to wheat. Not a fad diet. I will break out in blisters if I consume it. Today I went in to ask for a sandwich but I asked if they could put all ingredients on a tin tray in stead of on the bread they usually put it all on. The man behind the counter says,  ""No we can't we don't do that."" He suggests that I have a salad. I said that I do not want a salad. I want a sandwich but just with no bread. Putting the ingredients in a tray is a simple switch. And, no delis or restaurants ever have an issue with it because it's so easy. But, way to take an allergy seriously. And way to lose a customer for not willing to modify what you ""normally"" do.",,,
10,Adam R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,5.0,9/18/2017,10th ave & 57th st has limited great choices.  Fresco fits the bill!  Boar's head cold cuts or even their grilled chicken all with super fresh veggies or hummous or guac. Like Subway if you picked the ingredients from Whole Foods. If you're super hungry their Mexican plates to order are the best in the neighborhood.,,,
11,X P.,"Boston, MA",2,25,4,1.0,9/26/2016,"The service at this place sucks. The sandwich guy was incredibly rude. Proceeded to make my sandwich for me. I saw he squirted ketchup on my sandwich wiped it down with a napkin and then squirted tomato sauce on the sandwich instead. He did this a few feet from me. I'm not blind.Nor am I an animal. So I got my money back. Albeit, I can see how that mistake can happen, when you keep your tomato sauce in a ketchup bottle.  Who does that?!If you want to go some place where you can be treated like crap and eat garbage.

13,Armand K.,"Manhattan, NY",6,1,0,2.0,11/24/2017,I am not someone to complain and write negative reviews. But this place seriously need to revisit and adjust their opening hours. This is the second time I have walked in just past 7 to be told that that are not open. Even though their hours generally state 9pm. I lie in the are and really like the food and have supported this establishment a lot over the last two years. But alas I will no more. Better to call a head and find out if the are still open before making a trip here after 7pm.,,,
14,Brandon L.,"Miami Lakes, FL",14,8,1,2.0,1/13/2017,This place has the worst customer service. I feel like I'm a bother every time I want to order. The men there are rude and charge you for every little thing. Cup of water? Oh that'll be 40 to 60 cents. Extra sauce for my burrito bowl? Another charge! The food isn't that great for the price and service you get. Burrito Box down the street is much better if you're looking for Mexican food.,2,,
15,A M.,"Williston Park, NY",0,16,2,1.0,10/16/2017,"Hours state they are open at 9am however, this is the second time I've gone in at around 9:45am and they've told me they are not ready and won't make anything. I get that places need to set up and prepare for the day but I think wanting to order something 45 minutes after the opening time is not asking too much.",,,
16,Eric S.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,7,0,1.0,10/22/2015,"The owner at Fresco 57 just gave me the wrong change, and when I told him about it, he refused to believe me.The thing is, I work next door at CBS and I eat here for lunch almost every day. Seriously...like 3 out of every 5 days. The owner was on a personal phone call, and was distracted when he made the mistake. He then refused to believe that he gave me the wrong change, made me argue in front of everyone, and I walked out having paid $11 for a $9 burrito bowl.I'm sure none of you care abut my $2 change dispute, but this should go to show what type of nickel-and-diming guy owns this place, and what he thinks about loyal customers.Very disappointing, Fresco!",5,,
17,Tim P.,"East Bronx, NY",4,15,15,2.0,9/26/2014,"I go to school in the area and I often come here to eat. They have amazing food but horrible customer service. The staff never smile at customers and they look miserable. The burrito bowl is amazing with steak. You can choose what ingredients to add. Sometimes they add more of each ingredients and make the bowl full and sometimes they don't. It really depends on if the staff is having a good day. The compliant that I have with them is that one time they ran out of lettuce and they didn't tell me that until I was almost finish ordering. I asked the staff when will you guys have lettuce again and he said ""I don't know maybe 20 minutes."" I was hoping that he would add other ingredients in my bowl to compensate for not having lettuce but instead of doing that he just seal my bowl and gave it to me. I end up paying for the same price as a full bowl and this is ridiculous. Another complaint is the environment of the restaurant. The chairs in them are all torn and worn. And there are flies flying around. I would really hope that they work on the customer service and environment. Their food is amazing and they are not respecting it by having such poor service and environment. They need to give the food it's justice.",2,1,

21,Sammy B.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,334,2,1.0,6/1/2014,"RUDE SERVICE. I tried to order a philly cheesesteak here. ""Sure,"" he says. He comes back with the steak on the bread and asks me what I want on it. I ask for onions and he goes for the raw ones. I ask for the cooked onions and he says they don't have any. I ask if he can just put those onions on the grill for a bit and he says no, they are done grilling the steak so they won't grill the onions. I say ok, what about peppers? He says they ran out. I ask him, doesn't the philly cheesesteak come with the cooked peppers and onions like it says on the board right over his head. He smiles sheepishly & says yes. He doesn't apologize. I say forget it and turn away FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. Overly dramatic ending? Perhaps. But I wanted a philly cheesesteak so bad!",1,1,
22,Stephen L.,"New York, NY",86,8,0,1.0,6/9/2015,I ordered a cheesesteak today. Cashier took my money and I sat to wait for it patiently for over 15 min. Finally when I asked what was taking so long the mgr said I ordered from the wrong section despite the fact that the cashier took my money anyway as if it were my fault. No apologies and because of his rudeness and lack of empathy I asked for my money back and still no sandwich. He implied it was my fault as if customers are supposed to know where to order from and even where to stand! Even the cashier who took my order didn't own up to their own mistake! Horrible customer service!!! I will never come here again!!!!! A simple apology would've sufficed...,4,1,
23,Ellen P.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",7,60,331,3.0,12/12/2015,"I routinely get the classic burger here because it's juicy, tastes like it's straight off the grill (depending on the time, they'll either grill the patty from its raw state or re-grill it to heat it up), and pretty big for your average burger. The classic comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, ketchup, and mayo-- all making it a very flavorful burger.The price for a classic burger (cheapest item on the menu) is about $6.50. Can't really say if it's the best bang for your buck because it doesn't come with anything else... But then again it's a fairly bigger burger. I've never gotten the combo (fries and soda) or any other items (they have burritos, quesadillas, salads, sandwiches, paninis, etc.-- they're all around $9 and I'm on a budget!), but from the looks of it, they all look like they'd be pretty good too.Service is meh, but doesn't bother me. They have seating, which is partly why I elect to get my burger here as opposed to the other quick/deli-ish burger options around. All in all, good for a quick, seated lunch by yourself (probably not the best option for groups)!",,,

25,Todd S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0,3.0,9/28/2016,"I actually really enjoy the food but logistically, this place is a nightmare. There are multiple lines depending on what you want to order but this is not obvious when you walk in. The space for the lines is not nearly big enough for two lines and foot traffic. Then once you order the area where you wait for your food is in the way of everything. On top of all that they have absurdly tiny condiment cups that are just annoying to deal with. My number one complaint though is that the owner/manager has an awful attitude. He is constantly interrupting the flow of the people working to boss them around, seemingly for no real reason. When he decides to take orders, he is impatient and expects the customer to know exactly how he wants you to place your order. He's on to the next thing before you can finish a sentence. No good.",,,

28,Brianne G.,"ASTORIA, NY",15,11,1,2.0,12/9/2014,I hate this place with a passion. I've worked around the corner from Fresco for just under Three years and God only knows why I gave them another chance. Overpriced and the food is lackluster. This establishment doesn't care very much about its customers and I'm guess it's  because they are in the epicenter of people who need to eat fast and have few choices. Very little has changed over these three years with the customer service and I am once again disillusioned.,2,1,

You feel a lot of pressure when ordering because you're not speaking fast enough, they rush the entire experience and they barely listen to you. Granted it's crowded and they're trying to get to everyone but they're extremely rude in the process. The food is just ok. The best thing they have going for them is the burrito bowls. I ordered a wrap from them last week with a chicken cutlet and the chicken had a weird consistency to it, sort of rubbery .

The owner is always around and he checks everything, which is cool because the quality is consistent.FAVClassic Chicken sandwich meal is like $8.99 and so worth it! It comes with chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. Side container of French fries and a regular size drink. Very filling and flavorful, they always put enough pieces of chicken so you're better off eating it while its still halfway wrapped in its foil.You pump your own ketchup and regular mustard, they have salt,black pepper, and napkins accessible from the counter.

FRESCO 57 is a pretty good Burger/Sandwich spot with fairly reasonable prices for the food that is served and is a pretty much well kept place.. Thats as far as my Kudos go for this ""establishment"".  I'm sure if there were more choices in the area this place would surely be ran out of business based on the lack of customer service alone, and that starts from management down to servers.. I find it shocking that a place based in a area where they have mostly repeat customers has such a poor rapport with the community and working class in a area that keep them in business. (Be prepared to deal with a side of rudeness and lackluster customer service along with your order and side of fries, that is unless you have a pretty face and T&A which comes off as disturbing  perverted and creepy... and based on my experience and observation the rude service to different races and or nationalities are sad and balently obvious need I say more... also be prepared for the staff that talks rudely about you in spanish if they feel you dont speak the language.. hint : you guys should be more careful!!)

With this in mind, I won't be going there anymore.I don't expect a lot from fast-food restaurant staff as I know they are often busy and perhaps tired but this place is almost always completely empty when I come in, so I don't know why they miss the mark so consistently. If I were the owner of this place, I'd be very concerned about the health of my business.Here's what I've collected from this place:1) There is an obvious language barrier between staff and patrons. Getting answers about the menu was a huge challenge for me. 2) The staff move slow and seem generally uninterested in their work. Someone even rolled their eyes at me once. Why, I have no idea. I try to be very polite to people. 3) Their business hours are not accurately reflected online. The place is listed as closing at 9:00pm but I walked over at 8:45pm to grab a sandwich and was told they were closed, even though they also told me they were open (but only for people to finish eating).  So, I wasted a trip to the restaurant.

I ask the rude cashier how this was possible and he said it was because I got something extra that didn't come with my quesadilla.....LIES!!! I explained to him heatedly that that's not how it works, you can't charge me extra without letting me know beforehand. Here I am arguing at a restaurant when I thought I was a customer who deserved respect and customer service because without customers there is no business, but Everything is about their $1.50 worth of food that I let them know they could keep and they actually left at the counter while my friends are their whole meal!

I thought the owner was a dick and initially didn't like him and felt bad for his staff but then I quickly realized one of his staff is just as as nasty as he is. They charge an extra $0.50 for guac which is perfectly fine but when you're charging extra don't skimp me. So I asked for just a tad bit more Guac and one of the workers (the tallest Mexican looking one) slapped a whole bunch more on and told me with a nasty attitude that I'd have to pay an extra $0.50 on top of the extra $0.50 I was already paying. So when he rung me up I told him I wasn't paying the extra $0.50 because I didn't ask for him to give me a whole bunch more, I asked for what I'm paying for (if I'm paying extra for Guac I think I should have enough to at least taste that I have Guac on my wrap). So we proceeded to argue and I told him he could keep the wrap and so he took it back. I went to talk to the owner on a whim because I know he's nasty as well but he was actually sort of nice and told me to get the wrap and bring it down to where he was at and he would ring me up. So I went back and told the worker what the owner said and he ignored me for a bit and then ended up ringing me up but this time without the extra $0.50 and told me next time he's not going to give me Guac and ""I'm gonna see"" and I told him next time give me what I'm paying for and not a whole bunch extra, trying to charge me EXTRA, when that's not what I asked for. I still go back in there every other day just to show him that I'll keep coming in no matter what but I do not like him to make my wraps. I always ask the shorter one that works the wraps with him to make it because you can tell the one I had the argument with is bothered by my presence and I don't want him fucking with my food otherwise I might just end up hopping over the counter to fight him lol (super serious!). Only reason I go back and the reason I gave them two stars is because of how good the wraps are otherwise this place can go. I've had the burger and fries and they suck. The only reason this place is still open and they get away with such nasty service is because it's right next to a college, high school, hospital, etc., so they'll get customers regardless. If they were anywhere else I'm sure they'd be out of business or would have much better customer service. Bottom line if you work or go to school in the area only come here if you must, otherwise go somewhere else. Trust me!",1,,

Updated review","Although I have been back several times since writing the first review for Fresco 57, I thought an update was in order.  Fresco is obviously keeping people well fed and happy, because I went there for lunch yesterday and it was PACKED.  I got a chicken parm on whole wheat and they do a good job tag-teaming orders: one guy gets the bread, another cuts the meat, and one more puts on the condiments.  You can really be in and out of there in 5 minutes.  My sandwich was tasty as usual.   They seemed to be handling the volume of customers pretty well, and they are also keeping the seating area clean as well.",1,,1

I decided to go with a few friends for lunch, just to see what the fuss was.I stepped inside and was initially sticker-shocked, prices for burgers and grilled chicken sandwiches flirt with $6 and higher. You can get a combo with a soda and fries for roughly $8 but I decided against that and went to get an Arizona in a nearby deli. (Need I remind you where I'm from)The food is pretty good.

Updated review","When Living Social had an instant deal of $6 for $10 worth of food, I decided to snap it up. It would be a good opportunity to try finally try their burgers. I went with the Cabo Chicken Burger, which consisted of bacon, avocado and blue cheese. All three ingredients I love very much so I was sold! I went full out and got the combo - fries and soda, for $9.49. But I only had to pay $6! Bargain!The burger was surprisingly decent - two grilled chicken breasts, melted blue cheese on the bottom bun, avocado spread on the top bun and crispy bacon. Although, I would've preferred slices of avocado instead of it being it spread. Good portion of chunky fries too.Would I go back without the deal? Meh. Maybe.",1,1,2

The food was an excellent value (super tasty for the price and convenience), there are nutritious options (as well as some less-nutritious items), the restaurant itself practically gleams it's so spotless... the guys working behind the counter were actually having a good time (which is rare in the often-thankless food service realm).

I just wish they would have been fresh cut. Serving frozen fries in today's market just doesn't cut it any more. The reason for four stars. The place is clean and the employees are attentive. Well lit and I sat and read my book no one disturbed me. While I was there (7pm) most of the customers were John Jay students.

The food is decent, but the slow service kinda kills the whole concept of getting a quick meal.  The manager says it's been open since November 2009 but not all of the workers seem to know what they're doing. Also, the kitchen area is poorly laid out - why is the grill 20 feet from the sandwich area? I went during a relatively quiet weekend afternoon though I can imagine a chaotic weekday lunch rush.The best things about this place are that it's very clean (maybe a bit too clean that it feels sterile) and has comfortable booth seating for groups of two and four.

It doesn't taste like a grease mess (like McD's burgers, especially the Angus), but this one was on the salty side. Seems like they may have used some sort of adobo seasoning (was watching them cook it and they sprinkled something on top of it). Aside from the patty the bread was nice and soft, lettuce and tomato fresh, and the BBQ sauce had a nice spicy taste to it.
