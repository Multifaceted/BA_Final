1,Lauren Y.,"New York, NY",2,23,7,5.0,11/1/2018,"My favorite, go to coffee shop in midtown. I only drink drip or americano and it is always on point (way better than starbucks next door). Their pastries and sandwiches are marked at a decent price and are quite delicious. Furthermore, the employees are always nice, considerate, and hard working. However, with that said, sometimes there are long lines and the wait can be quite long due to fickle tourists trying to figure out what they want at the register counter, but the cashier employee is always nice and allows them to take their time. So, their customer service is top tier, albeit the long lines at times.",,,
2,Katie L.,"New York, NY",251,233,532,4.0,10/25/2018,"Tisserie on 55th is a bright cafe a few blocks south of Central Park. They do a huge array of bites and pastries you don't normally see together. Palmiers and pastelitos? Quiches and empanadas? I would say they're definitely French-Latin influenced, which is a nice mix.The quiches I got were great. They recommended the Tomato & Blue Cheese and I got another Mushroom Quiche for later. Both were flaky, eggy, and flavorful, the blue cheese not off-putting as some can be. I have my eyes on the Sweet Plantain & Latin Cheese next time!Desserts were tasty, but could be fresher. Guava & Cream Cheese Chausson had a sweet and tart filling, but the pastry envelope not very flaky. Nutella Brioche was so doughy, with a scant smearing of Nutella. I buy jars of Nutella just to avoid this fate, so a light smear doesn't cut it. Friendly if slow service, with seating indoors, but take it to the Park instead!",5,2,8

The staff was super friendly and attentive.  They were so nice when we told them it was our first time in. They have a lot of options to choose from pastry wise. I also had a warm croissant sandwich. I really like the swiss cheese that was on it. The restuarant is a great place to get coffee, people watch, and eat a pastry. This place is fairly priced. Yum!",,,1

The atmosphere was pleasant, there were plenty of coffee drinks on the menu, and yummy pastries and savories in display.

I would definitely go back!",,,

I have to say, I wasn't impressed with the cold brew - tasted quite watery and a bit too bitter of an aftertaste. I'd rather try one of their espresso based drinks next time. However, their frittata was amazing! It comes with a small side salad that's lightly dressed and the frittata itself is a great portion. I'm a huge fan of egg dishes, so I'll definitely be back to try some more items from their menu. They also had some tasty looking pastries that I didn't get this time around.

Thanks to a photo on Yelp, I saw that they had alfajores, a South American pastry: shortbread cookies filled with dulce de leche and dusted coconut on the sides.I ordered one for each of us along with a double espresso and the dulce de leche latte. We took a seat at a small table and our order was up in moments. I was afraid my latte was going to be too sweet but it ended up being the perfect amount of caramely goodness along with frothy, silky milk.We did not have lunch but noticed a variety of sandwiches and quiches on display.

I'm not sure what the rest of their items are like and, according to the other reviews the coffee might cure cancer. But I am sure those cookies were meh. How does one screw up a cookie? Well they weren't very sweet. Look here, scooter, I only get about 1700 calories a day to not be a total fat-ass and if I am gonna spend any calories on dessert then they had better be good. I don't need any healthy cookies or healthier cookies. Give me sugar and butter, cream them som'bitches together with vanilla, toss in some flour, a little salt, and 3-4 bags of chips and bake 'em.  What I am trying to say is get your cookie fix elsewhere.",,2,

They have some hefty sandwiches, mini sandwiches, a plethora of quiche, and sweets. I ordered ready-made chicken salad with walnuts, cabbage, and craisins.

Conveniently, this place was right around the corner from our hotel, which allowed us to visit it twice.Between our visits, we were able to order a chai tea latte and 3 different types of sandwiches: salmon croissant, turkey croissant and another style of turkey sandwich. Everything was top notch to say the least. I can't emphasize how surprised and how please we were with the consistent quality and experience of this placeBoth visits were different based on the amount of customers that inhabited the space, but the service was quick and friendly each time. We ordered both lunches to go, but it seemed like there was seating for about 20 people (give or take).Again, lunch for two people under $20 in NYC is a win.

I ordered a small Americano with a splash of almond milk and it took over 10 minutes to get it. Shocker- when I got it, there was no almond milk in it.The coffee was good and very strong (hence the three stars) and the interior is funky, but the fact that they ask for tips via iPad for a 10-miniute coffee is a bit of a stretch.",21,7,15

I ordered a chai latte and, after confirming that I preferred spicier rather than sweeter lattes, I still wound up with a profoundly oversweet latte. The Brie croissant sandwich had good flavor ideas, but they oddly heated it up so that only the croissant was warm while the Brie was still stone cold. You couldn't really taste anything other than the hard chunks of cheese! The Nutella cookie fared better - it was a perfect blend of chewy in the middle with a little bit of crunch on the outside. In the future, I'd just grab a cookie and a basic coffee, or find somewhere better.",,,

Second, they have enough seating area and it's not hard to find seats. Nice atmosphere inside and good for reading or chatting! Third, the bathroom is very clean! I don't like to go to public bathrooms in NYC because they are always dirty. But this cafe keeps its bathroom clean for customers!!

They have a lovely array of baked goods ranging from the best muffins I had ever tasted to warm, flakey cinnamon rolls and Nutella pastries. I visited Tisserie 55 upon two occasions, and got a blueberry muffin one time and a chocolate chip one the other. Both muffins were by far the best I have ever had and were moist, not too dense but still slightly cakey and not too sweet, but still sweet enough. They also paired well with my latte, complete with heart latte art, which was lightyears better than Starbucks. Tisserie 55 also serves savory quiches, frittatas and mini sandwiches with a side salad, however I did not have a chance to try those but can only assume they would we as delicious as their other goods!

Initially provided decent service, however that changed when a discrepancy occurred.  I had asked about the flavor of muffins on display and the associate (she will remain nameless for this review) pointed out a banana/ blueberry muffin and I bought it with an iced mocha. But, at the first bite, there was no 'banana' component to this muffin and I brought it to her attention. Her response was 'oh, sorry 'bout that, it looked like the banana/ blueberry flavor.'  Not the response I was looking for, and definitely not the type of customer service that warrants repeat business!!  Too many other places out there to put up with 'just decent' customer service!",,,

Everything I've had here is amazing, and whether you're looking for a fancy latte or a black coffee you can't go wrong. One of my favorite things to get here is their matcha latte and I make it a bit stronger by adding a shot of espresso. If you're not a fan of the matcha, I recommend just a simple almond milk latte, it's delicious. They also have delicious pastries, parfaits, and cookies. The great coffee and food paired with a very welcoming staff make this a great place to go for a little pick-me-up. I take my coffee shops very seriously and this place is one of my favorites to go to when I'm not in the mood for Starbucks during my work day.

Like, I walked past it three times before finding it. It's tiny but bright and lively and with the best hipster rustic decor. Tiny round tables are scattered about the place, but I always took my coffees to go. Their soy iced lattes are great, as is their regular-milk lattes. My mom enjoyed their cappuccino. My aunt wasn't a big fan of their americano - she said it basically tasted like a drip coffee. My biggest regret is not trying their green tea latte (made from the same matcha as Matcha Bar). I'm in love with their spinach quiche (comes with a side of dressed greens) and their carrot cake muffin is divine. 10/10 favorite new coffee place in New York; it seriously rivals Cafe Grumpy.",,,

Same goes for the pastries (the deliciousness, not me being annoying, I'm fun sometimes). The ambience is very relaxing, and if you can snag a spot by the window you should because this is some prime people-watching real estate.

It still took a while after this,  about half an hour for something that needed to just be heated. Am older couple that ordered after me got their food first. When I got my tortilla and salad the only veggies on the plate was lettuce. The older couple had all the veggies on theirs. When I mentioned that the salad only had lettuce it was indicated to me that they ran out. I guess the older couple got the rest of them? Apparently they needed the veggies more lol.

I have been eying them for a long time since I was first introduced to the cafe by a girlfriend last year, but never managed to make it there for lunch until today! I opted for the mushroom quiche as it's freshly brought out from the kitchen. But it turned out to be a disappointment- the shell became too soggy and mushy after microwaved (why don't they use an oven instead?) and the overall flavor was too cheesy to feel the mushroom.

They really need to fire her since she acts like she has something better to do. To top it all off, their pastries are disgusting.

Still crowded, but with that New York bustle that is more raw energy than rubbing elbows rude. If I'm staying midtown this is my go-to for morning coffee to beat the ridiculous overcharges at the hotel breakfast clipperies. It's mostly locals, because, if you're on your way to work it's a perfect pick me up and, if you can afford to live in this neighborhood, you can spring for someone else doing the baking and brewing daily!",4,2,3

I order the same thing every time (iced americano with caramel and almond milk) and it's always delicious. Also their oatmeal comes hot and topped with nuts and fresh berries, would definitely recommend it! My only reasons for 4 stars are the high prices (my coffee costs about the same as my decadent oatmeal) and the occasional long lines... but I suppose people pay $4 for Starbucks coffee anyway, and Tisserie blows Starbucks out of the water for about the same price.",,,

I own a Cafe shop in NYC, and I ordered pastries from Tisserie since Cafe opened. order came missing, damaged or incorrect items several times, I did not complain about that. But our customer found hairs from their pastries. I emailed their customer service, no apology, no credit, no response at all. Even worse, they increased minimum on daily order every time we told them that hairs were found in pastries. Thus, we changed our pastry supplier. You think all bad over? No, nightmare had just begun. They kept our shop's keys since they usually delivered in the very early morning. After we switched supplier, we wrote couple emails to have them return the keys, no response at all. And then we called them, I was told they would have driver find the keys and return to us. Called couple times, same thing were told. One or two months later, we had to call their manager. Their manager(David) finally told us that their driver lost our key. He said that there is no address on the key, so there is no problem even if the key is lost, it is very safe. It does not matter if anyone got the key. Well, I was really speechless by his logic. After several arguments and negotiations in calls, manager agreed to reimburse the cost of changing lock when I told him that I got a phone quotation around $ 100. Later, we changed the lock, the actual bill is $160. Because the earliest estimate was $ 100, so we told him to reimburse $ 120, and we would pay the difference and we sent him the receipt of lock changing. Then he became so angry and refused to reimburse any cost. When we asked to talk to business owner, he began to found all excuses to stop us, He interrupted my call couple times when I spoke with someone else in the office. He told us like their boss was out of State, their boss will be away couple month, their boss barely return to office, and at last story, their boss never return to office, and he is on all charge. But after I kept calling their office, he agreed to reimburse $ 120, but to our own drive to New Jersey to pick up the check, they refused to mail it to us even we paid for postage. Couple days later, they agreed to send check to us. But nothing was received, same thing was told couple times when we called  to follow up. Manager David even called back and said check already been mailed. But nothing ever received anyway. What a company and manager!!",,,
60,Eric P.,"Flushing, NY",660,38,1,3.0,5/19/2017,"Cozy feeling close to Times Square. It's conveniently located right where all the busy businesses and shops are so if you're up for an afternoon cup of coffee, this is the place to go to. It's actually sorta big compared to other coffee shops while also maintaining a cozy feel to it. They serve plenty of other pastries too if you're also looking for a small cheap snack. You probably will have a hard time finding something cheap to eat in NYC. Speaking of which, you can also get a nice view of Times Square if you look straight down the the street from where it's located. I can imagine it's really nice at night.

My first time in NYC and it's cold out so I was looking for a place away from the ordinary chain of something that would delight my senses without hurting my pocket too much and keep me safe from the cold for awhile. Also trying out the Dulce de Leche latte! There is latin music on and it's defnitely a cute place to be. It's full though - I managed to snag the only table available by the door and it only seats one person.

Delicious food, friendly service, ample seating, close proximity to my apt (not objectively very helpful haha), and open early!I had to vacate my apt in Midtown West early in the morning on a Saturday, and found Tisserie to be open, so headed in. There were a few people seated/ordering to go when I came in, which I appreciated (I hate being the only person sitting around when the employees are all working about). I can't say what it's like on weekdays being in Midtown, but it's probably frequented more by to-goers than seated guests. I ordered a lightly heated brie and fig (?) croissant and an iced chai latte. Both came out to be about $12, and so tasty! For the croissant sandwich, the two strong flavors of cheese and sweetness were perfectly portioned. The drink was great-- nothing special, but not bad.I will definitely start meeting friends here or just drop by for the cafe ambiance. I recommend you do too (when you're in the area)!",,,

I went there to pick up an iced cappucino for her and ended up ordering a small chai latte with almond milk for myself while I was there. The service was fast, friendly and efficient. There was a bit of a line while I was there and the cashier was being trained by her superior. The person training her took charge and moved the line along quickly. The chai latte was impeccable; one of the best chais I've had in the city from an independent cafe. I didn't expect it to be as good as it ended up being but it exceeded my expectations. Since my first time there, I've been back several times and have yet to have had a bad experience. Another time, I ordered their Chipotle Chicken empanada and it didn't taste awful. It was a bit on the expensive side as I am used to paying a dollar for an empanada uptown and in the Bronx but I was curious about their take on the dish so I gave it a whirl. Will I purchase it again? Probably not but we live and we learn, right? They have the club card system that rewards you with a free drink after purchasing 9. I am well on my way to getting that free drink! And you bet your bottom dollar, that it will be their chai latte brewed with my beloved almond milk!",,,

So I had a ginger turmeric hot drink and gave it a try. It was good! Mild but distinct flavor and really what I was looking for instead of coffee.I found an oversized comfy leather chair and melted in.

We stopped at Tisserie recently b/c it was freaking cold (30 degrees) and we wanted to warm up. I wanted a pastry and my friends wanted coffee. We Yelped around and we found Tisserie.First thing first, the milieu. It's a real nice coffee place. It's bright unlike your typical SB. They have nicely finished vertical wood panels that really give T a nice chique look. As you walk in the baristas brew the coffee and then you are treated to all of the pastries in the shop. So very nice.The pastries themselves were delicious, and you can tell that they weren't mass produce a la SB. it was coming from their local patisserie/boulangerie. My friend's pain au chocolat was layered beautifully. One of the best I have seen here in the US. Myself some kind of double chocolate croissant and again it was really good. It definitely helped that they toasted it just enough to make it moist and crispy. So really, their pastries were top notch.It's their coffee. Again, it had to be that day but all of our drinks came flat. I had their ice macchiato and the color was very dull as if the ratio between water and milk was completely off. It wasn't sweet at all and tasted like bad coffee. Someone had a cafe au lait that really was mostly lait than coffee. there were 5 of us and each of our drinks were misses!The staff however was very gracious, they gatered to our needs and when I complained about my iced coffee, they were quick to want to make a new one for me. SO big props for that. In the end, I didn't get a new drink but it was a nice gesture.Regardless, I'll probably skip next time I am in NYC.",,,

I mean, you expect flaky crust and a perfect mix of buttery softness and flaky crunch and it just didn't deliver texture and overall foodgasm wise, Taste wasn't too bad though. Latte had a great tasting foam and depth and service was adequate.Overall, I don't know, I'm kind of disappointed. I might give them a second chances cuz we all have our bad days, but so far, for the price you might as well go to Korean takes on French pastries like Paris baguette that area tad less than here.",,,

To my surprise it came with a side salad in the box, which was great, but the quiche itself was not up to par.  It was a little mushy on top and at first I was afraid it wasn't cooked all the way.  It turned out fine, but the lack of good customer service was a bummer.",,,

Also this place has prices that are low, it leaves you kicking yourself for paying $6 for that subpar bagel sandwich at the deli down the street. Ordered some pastries and coffee for my family before flying out of NY and was so glad it was across the hotel we were staying at. We ordered a drip coffee, latté, Argentinia Empanada, Blueberry and 7 grain muffin, Caprese and Turkey/ Cheese mini sandwich and two Guava and cheese Chaussons.The latté was brewed well, lovely latté art too. The Caprese sandwich was decent, Blueberry muffin was soft, moist with hints of Cinnamon. The winner was the guava and cheese pastry that was warm, flakey and sweet. All tasted fantastic with the coffee. Each pastry was warmed up-optionally of course, the coffee was good and strong and the service was quick, friendly. Such a great environment to sit around to lounge in and sip coffee, it's clean and designed similarly to Shake Shack ( black, wood grain, lights ).

There isn't an actual register so having been my first time there, i was unsure of where to go. The woman next to him holding an iPad was doing something else, so I started walking a little further to an area that was blocked from my vision. I thought maybe I was supposed to pay there. When I realized I had to go back to the iPad lady, she gave me a look that could only mean ""what the hell are you doing?!"" She threw both hands in the air too.

The cafe serves different types of pastries, baked goodies and coffee at a decent price (probably along the same price as Starbucks, but not outrageously expensive as other tourist traps).I immediately loved this place when I walked in because the cafe had a quaint, local feel to it and it wasn't as noisy as I expected, given its location right in the heart of Manhattan close to Central Park. You could expect to order and find a table to sit and sip your coffee/enjoy your food without the hustle and bustle of the normal busy NYC life. The cashier was friendly and was patient when taking our orders, even if we were not quite decisive as to what we wanted to order. We ended up getting 2 types of empanadas ($2.50 ea) and a zucchini muffin ($2.75) and they were quite tasty. Together with our drinks, we paid less than $20 including tips.Overall, this is a good place to grab a quick lunch bite before heading off somewhere or even a quick snack after walking through Central Park!

They have some awesome food and drinks, but I find their customer service somewhat curt and brusque. This place would improve vastly if they could just work on that. I'm in the city everyday so I'm very accustomed to NYC's no time for b.s. service, but a little more effort would be appreciated.They serve Stumptown Hair Bender coffee (my hands down fave)! Their cafe au laits and lattes are excellent. I once ordered an iced chai tea latte, which was sweet and delicious, but nothing more than Oregon Chai right out of the carton, milk, and ice. Nothing artisanal about that. If you like Stumptown, you can buy a bag of beans there for $16, which they'll grind free of charge if you want. (Perfect souvenir for tourists!)Their selection of pastries is absolutely mouthwatering! I love their French-Latin fusion! I've enjoyed their palmiers, guava and cream cheese chaussons, chocolate concha (which they warmed up), and croissants. I've yet to try their savory dishes but they look wonderful as well. I typically come by in the morning or for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.This location is right next to a Starbucks and Tisserie is as busy, it not more, than them. A hotel is located right next door to Tisserie, which I've observed results in a higher amount of foreign customers. It's a shame that more domestic tourists don't come in here because Tisserie really does offer a unique flavor experience in how they offer French pastries with Latin flavors.At times, it can be hard to find a seat, especially in the morning from 8-10 am and around lunchtime. Seating seems to be better later in the afternoon if you want to sit down and try their quiche, sandwiches or salads.As mentioned, customer service is brusque, not rude typically, just not very friendly or particularly welcoming. Whenever I had questions, I always received an answer but I definitely felt hurried to make my order. Luckily, I've been happy with everything I've ordered in the past! They have a great selection of foods and drinks (including teas, juices, and Harmless Harvest coconut water).

It has nice branding, a variety of pastry/drink options, ample seating, Stumptown coffee, and all these amazing Yelp reviews. However, I ordered an almond croissant, which is my pastry benchmark for all NYC coffee shops, and it was so soggy and mushy that I couldn't finish it. (this was after they toasted it too) It's one of the worst croissants I've ever eaten, but maybe I got a bad batch? In any case, Petrossian is just a couple blocks away and they offer a far superior almond croissant at the same price.Also, Tisserie's weekday morning service is painfully slow. During my visit at 9:45am, there was only one cashier with 9-10 people waiting in line and my whole experience lasted ~7-8 minutes. The Starbucks next door gets a similar volume of people but they're able to churn out drinks at a faster rate.Unfortunately, Tisserie missed the mark.

The cafe is on the smaller side and while always busy it's never taken more than a few minutes to be served. Their dulce de leche syrup is to die for and they have a great selection of pasties and other food items. If you prefer lighter roast coffee I highly recommend giving Tisserie 55 a visit.,,,

116,Andrew K.,"Yarraville, Australia",13,48,226,4.0,7/27/2016,Tisserie is a bright and tasty addition to the Theatre District scene surrounded by otherwise somewhat dull offerings at other cafes. Tisserie has a unique French Argentinean spin on pastries. On entering your eyes are drawn to the multitude of french pastries but look closer and there are some really cool pastries with Argentinean flavours. Also around the corner are some underrated empanadas. Unfortunately the empanadas are simply microwaved to heat them up so the pastry becomes soggy but the flavours are still there. Coffee skills are good and service is exceptional. This ticks all the boxes when you are walking around the empty morning streets looking for a delicious pastry and coffee.,,,
117,Christine C.,"Flushing, NY",187,18,0,4.0,3/22/2016,"I love stopping in this place for an afternoon pick-me-up. Always a warm, bustling atmosphere. Expect it to be crowded in the mornings. They have a difficult morning rush to deal with; a small space, plenty of up-and-at-it tourists, and lots of people stopping in on their way across town. May not be as speedy as Starbucks, but of course, my expectations as a New Yorker will always be unreasonably high. Any slightly-longer-than-lightning-fast wait times are cushioned by their focused staff and the quality of the drinks/food.The pastries and mini sandwiches are always fresh and delicious. Their cold brew is pretty good, just a little bit too watery for me (get light ice). My favorite menu item is their standard latte: it's one of the best I've ever had.

Updated review","Ok, so with all this free PayPal credit (another $5 and another $20) since my last review, I thought Tisserie 55 deserved an update.I've tried a few things here now and have decided that I wouldn't come if it weren't for the continuous free food.Caprese sandwich - I don't know how to describe this except for meh.  You can't really mess up a caprese sandwich, but this was just not satisfying whatsoever... I think it might be the bread being too had and the mozzarella not being as fresh as I would have liked.Guava and cream cheese chausson - the chausson itself seemed a little stale.  There wasn't enough cream cheese and the guava was just heaped in a giant glob on one side.  That, and there was more air than substance in this pastry.  Disappointment.Empanadas - chicken was better than the beef, but nothing like an actual empanada place, obviously.  They warm them up in the microwave, btw.  They warm everything up in the microwave, actually.Iced coffee... wait, no iced coffee because they ran out.  What kind of coffee place runs out of iced coffee?Iced Americano - that's all they had. No iced coffee.  Espresso is freshly ground and pressed, but nothing out of the ordinary or special here.Turkey and cheese quiche - I've decided that these quiches are overpriced and are mostly eggy filling.  I don't remember tasting much turkey if any.  I doused this in my own hot sauce.Overall, not that impressed with Tisserie anymore after trying it multiple times.",3,2,1

Instead the workers offered me sandwiches and pastries to take home for free. Apparently they donate all the leftovers to the nearby church but on some nights, they have so much leftovers that they just have to throw them out. I happened to come at a perfect time! Parfait, smoked salmon sandwich, walnut brie fig croissant, and a caramel/chocolate filled bun - well fed for the next 2 meals.

Updated review","I come for the tasty pastries and ambiance, not the sometimes just plain rude service.  If it weren't for the positive facets, I'd rate this place a solid 3.  I'm never returning in the morning because:(a) I don't want to deal with your brusqueness first thing in the AM.  We all get enough of that on the subway during our morning commutes, thank you very much;(b) There was a long line; and (c) They gave me the wrong order.  By the time I realized it, I was already running late to work, so I was stuck with it. I also didn't appreciate being grilled about where my phone was (to pay for my order with PayPal), and then not being offered an apology when, oh, look at that, you found my account???  Gee, thanks.=====================================Spacious cafe with free WiFi and nice decor.  Can keep up during busy times.  But indifferent staff.  Prices below include tax:GOOD:-Chocolate Chip Muffin ($2.72): Yum!  My favorite item here so far.-Zucchini Cream Cheese Muffin ($2.72): Savory and slightly sweet.-Turkey & Cheese Quiche & Salad ($7.08): Nice and cheesy, but the salad was sparse and raw (No dressing.  Blech.), so not worth full price.-Mini Turkey & Cheese sandwich ($3.50 + tax): Small for the price though.PASS:-Double Chocolate Chip Muffin ($2.72): Very chocolate-y as promised, but somewhat dry.  I wouldn't get this again.-Cranberry Muffin: ($2.72): OK.  No cranberries actually inside the muffin, just on top.-Blueberry Muffin ($2.72): Disappointing.  A little dry.  Could have used more blueberries and vanilla extract.  Maybe some more sugar, too.  Same applies to the Cranberry Muffin, as well, actually.  -Diplomat Bread Pudding ($3.27): Holy mackerel, this thing is heavy. Moist, but also completely flavorless.  Ick. -Nutella Croissant ($2.99): Meh.  Not worth it.-Dulce de Leche Brioche ($3.27): Looks cute and has a tasty filling, but those weren't enough to make up for the actual brioche, which was low in flavor.",3,,

133,Joy D.,"Raleigh, NC",386,313,404,4.0,12/16/2013,"A friend and I found Tisserie by accident as we were wandering around the block looking for a place to eat. The Yelp reviews for the corner deli's weren't very good, so we figured a cafe/bakery would suffice. Boy was it a pleasant accident!!I ordered a frittata, turkey and swiss slider, and beef empanada for lunch which totaled to $12.63 with tax. Not bad for NYC! The portion was perfect for lunch, and I loved that I was able to sample so many things. The beef empanada had a nice pastry shell compared to usual empanadas I've eaten, and the beef had a spicy (but not hot) kick to it. The frittata was flavorful from the onions and was what I imagined a naked quiche to taste like. The turkey and swiss slider was what exceeded my expectations. The bread was UH-MAZING - sweet, soft, and went well with the turkey. Overall, I am absolutely in love with this quaint and modern cafe bakery. If I worked around the area, I would probably eat there the majority of the time for lunch. My only complaint is there was a burning smell every so often - perhaps burning the coffee?

Yeah, that's my kind of cafe experience.I was in the area searching for food and after walking three blocks under the unbearable heat in the afternoon, I was going to just opt for anything. I looked to my right and there was Tisserie's big, flashy, glamorous letters calling me. So I j-walked my empty stomach over. This place is a perfect for a quick lunch if you're in the area; they have so many small, yet filling eats like quiche, empanadas and sandwiches.I got a smoked salmon sandwich with oat bread and even though it's a standard item I can get at any cafe, it was not bad at all and at $8, I cannot complain too much for Midtown food. I also got a small cup of apple cider but wasn't worth the $3 for a kid-sized cup; it's nothing compared to apple cider from orchard farms. The decor here is gorgeous and has this modern American feel to it--with some New York style, of course.

156,Mommy Z.,"Winchester, CA",3,79,75,5.0,4/12/2015,"Recently took a trip to the big apple. This place was right across the street from our hotel. Right next to Tisserie is Starbucks, but I don't do their coffee so I decided to try Tisserie. As a big coffee drinker, this place hit home! They serve wonderful great tasting coffee along with four different types of creamers (soy included.) They have a wide variety of hot drinks along with a delicious variety of wonderful pastries. I had the croissant with chocolate drizzle with slivered toasted almonds. A match made in heaven! I was provided warm friendly service which was another reason I came back! Looking forward to visiting Tisserie 55 again! P.s. I didn't get a chance to try their croissant with Brie cheese, walnuts and fig marmalade. I left wanting it so please enjoy it for me!",,,1
157,Yasmine K.,"Manhattan, NY",90,150,11,2.0,2/14/2015,"It is my second time here and I have to say I am very disappointed by the customer service. After paying on one of those swipe things attached to the iPad, I proceeded to enter my email address as I wanted the receipt emailed to me instead of printed. The woman behind the counter snatched the iPad for me, printed the receipt despite me saying I wanted it emailed, and said that she needed to use it now. I don't think I have encountered such rude behavior from a cashier before.The food is just average on the most part. The only unique thing here is the Brie, fig and walnut croissant. I won't be coming back!",1,1,
158,Rosen V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,12,5.0,11/8/2016,Amazing coffee shop. My favorite is special pain au chocolate! Delicious! The staff is friendly and helpful! Very cute space with wifi and a big couch.,,,
159,Denice C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",96,101,18,4.0,1/13/2015,"Really a great spot in Mid-town. There is not 1000 different types of lattes here but they do the basic stuff exceptionally well. If you're looking for a fancy, slightly burnt expresso drink, or watered down coffee, the two shops for that are just a few doors down. This is a place for those that like high quality, hand crafted drinks and small plates. A true asset to my neighborhood.",1,,
160,Victor N.,"Boston, MA",1,33,130,5.0,3/12/2017,They offer a variety of tasty pastries and sandwiches yummy!!! Fast and friendly service!!!,,,
161,Geanr L.,"Porterville, CA",27,71,163,4.0,4/10/2016,"Great fresh variety of croissants and pastries and coffees, very reasonably priced. Will return.",,,
162,Sarah A.,"Philadelphia, PA",22,270,62,5.0,6/16/2013,"Needed to caffeinate and do some work requiring WiFi. Saw Tisserie 55 and it looked legit. It didn't disappoint.Great mocha (deep and rich with the requisite pretty foam design), but the piece de resistance was the splurge on an alfador. My first and now one of my favorites: soft shortbread + dulce de lece creme? Fan-friggin-tastic.The cafe itself was pretty and functional, with outlets by each (most?) of the tables, and it was quiet in between influxes of (mostly) tourists (due to the neighborhood).",,,
163,Kelly P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,4.0,1/13/2015,"I rarely... seriously rarely... write reviews but Tisserie is one of my favorite places in the city and the sole reason I have a latte addiction. Everyone there is so friendly and remembers my name/face (I mean I do come in a couple times a week..) All of their baristas make delicious drinks and you can't beat Stumptown coffee. I don't LOVE their pastries (well except the almond cheese danish) but their sandwiches/snacks are pretty tasty. That being said, do keep in mind, it is attached to a hotel and can get very busy and tourist-y, especially in the morning. Everyone working here is super patient and friendly even when there's a language/accent barrier. When it gets busy and a line forms, its a bit awkward. The line has to double back and crowds tables. This is really the only reason I took away a star.. that and the pastries just being OK. But really, I'll continue to come here as long as I work in the area and will be very sad when I no longer do.",1,,
164,Cam H.,"Portland, OR",2,5,1,5.0,10/6/2014,"I had their cold brewed coffee and the almond croissants. The coffee was quite good- better than most other iced coffees I've had! The croissant though was amazing! The best croissant I've had in the US, and one of the best I've had.The atmosphere in the cafe is great too. A really nice place to relax. My one complaint? I couldn't get on the wifi there. Not a big enough problem to keep me from giving a 5 star rating though!",4,,
165,Melissa F.,"Washington, DC",116,129,75,5.0,2/26/2015,"What a cute, little bakery!  Nothing to complain about except my inability to choose just one item to order out of all the seemingly tasty options!  I ordered a Mushroom Quiche to go and loved that, when I opened the box, it was served with a a vinaigrette salad--what a nice touch!  Outside of the delicious food, the employees were also very friendly (much needed in the morning hours).  Definitely take a pitstop here for your breakfast--you won't be disappointed.",,,
166,Carmelo E.,"Downers Grove, IL",13,8,2,5.0,5/29/2016,"Lovely place! Elegant, delicious coffee and really good pastries. I had a dulce de leche latte that was not super sweet (which I appreciated) and quite tasty. Nice ambience and wonderful service.",,,
167,Maria P.,"Moonachie, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,8/17/2016,I went there and made a mistake with the name of my coffee and order a tea drink instead. I told the girl who took my order and they were unfriendly and nasty. The food is good but I won't comeback.,,,
168,Dimitri M.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,4.0,8/16/2015,"Cafe is clean and nice insight, food is perfect, fresh and soft salmon sandwich is only $3.50. Coffee is exceptionally good. Best choice to start a new day!!",,,
169,Anne D.,"New York, NY",2,11,2,4.0,1/25/2017,"I thought the space was great in that it wasn't too crowded. I didn't really mind the tables being close together. Had hot coco and a muffin, which was good, until I found a lump of flour in the muffin - hence -1 star.",,,
170,Pavirin S.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,4.0,1/4/2016,Great place for breakfast and lunch. I love a coffee here it's testy not too strong and people who work there very friendly. The place look cozy and clean.,,,1
171,Luigi A.,"Chinatown, Washington, DC",23,12,0,5.0,6/22/2016,"Try the plantain and Latin cheese quiche, along with a freshly squeezed OJ! Totally worth it.",,,
172,Selina L.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,10,0,5.0,8/22/2014,"I had an informal meeting here after work this week and arrived a bit early, so treated myself to a small peach iced tea and zucchini cream cheese muffin. Total came to $5.50, perfectly reasonable considering how satisfying everything was. The muffin was quite dense, not like the crumbly cakey muffins I'm used to, and proved very filling. Tea was not too sweet, very refreshing.We ended up closing the cafe, but aside from a quick heads up to us and the other occupied tables they let us do our thing until the very last minute, sweeping around our feet and not hassling us to leave. As someone who used to work retail and *hated* stragglers with a passion, I'm impressed that they let us stay as long as they did. Please don't use this review as an excuse to linger past closing time! Seriously, that would make me sad. I just wanted to give em credit for being so gracious after what was probably a long shift. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the neighborhood.",3,,
173,Mike M.,"Apex, NC",0,57,2,4.0,6/14/2015,"I love to try different coffee houses and get a cafe mocha. This place was right next to a Starbucks, and I was glad I made my choice. Starbucks is good, but this just tasted better to me. There was just the right of mocha flavor that didn't overwhelm the coffee flavor.This hit the right spot and enjoying it while sitting in Central Park just made it that much more special!  I'll be back tomorrow morning, but I'll get the large next time!Back again this morning , busy place. Had the spinach quiche and it was good just not very hot. Still 4 stars",,,
174,Nir V.,"Johns Creek, GA",58,9,0,5.0,6/12/2016,"Very nice bakery and a coffee house. My family  got the salmon sandwich, spinach kish, almonds croissant, chocolate muffin, latte and the fresh orange juice. Everything was great! A mush have breakfast!",,,
175,Chris O.,"White Plains, NY",0,58,2,3.0,2/20/2017,"The theme here was good-but-not-great.  Good but not great coffee, good but not great pastries, good but not great empanadas.  I'll bump the staff up to very good.",,,
176,Sandy Z.,"Toronto, Canada",7,32,24,4.0,4/7/2015,"This is a quaint french cafe and bakery. It's a great place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch. They have quiche, muffins, croissants and an assortment of pastries. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is warm and charming. We came here after indulging in large and expensive breakfasts at Norma's and sarabeths and found this to be a great alternative to a big NY breakfast.",,,
177,Rachel P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,39,0,3.0,11/21/2015,"Get a second cashier, Tisserie.The coffee is good but they insist on making you wait every morning for 15 minutes just to get a regular cup of coffee.  The line is ALWAYS held up by tourists at the ONE register.  Is no one managing this place?",,1,
178,Captain S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,85,47,3.0,7/9/2016,"Brie, fig, and walnut croissant was really good. Chicken empanada was OK. Coffee was OK. Ambiance was nice. Good location to people watch, especially all the travelers.",,,
179,Stephanie V.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",75,130,154,3.0,4/9/2012,"I have never been disappointed in this location.  Located inside of the Park Central Hotel building with a street front entrance, I walk past Starbucks and into Tisserie whenever I am in the mood for an empanada and a cup of coffee.  If you haven't had Tisserie pastries before, they are worth a try.  Many upscale hotels and restaurant venues use their product so you may have tried it and not realized it.  They are known for French pastries with a Latin flair.The spinach & mushroom empanada hits the spot for a little snack.  The quiche is another favorite.  It comes with a small dressed salad and has a flaky crust that is never rubbery.  They have a great line of pastries and sweets including a tasty guava chausson.Their coffee is consistent - strong without being bitter.  They brand their own stick shaped sugar, Splenda and Sugar in the Raw and always keep the condiment area clean and well stocked including soy milk.  If you take your order to go, the handled bag is just the perfect size.At this particular location you can take advantage of available wifi from the local area but they don't have their own so it isn't a particularly strong signal.  It is frequented by a good number of tourists.  They have a few seats by the window out to 7th Avenue which is always good for some people watching.They also have one of the best well kept single bathrooms in the back.",2,2,3
180,Julieann M.,"San Clemente, CA",351,86,25,5.0,9/3/2015,What a great looking coffee shop. We got the Stumptown cold brew on tap and it hit the spot. Our friend got the Stumptown chocolate cold brew and that was so delicious. Service was great; we also got the dulce de leche cookie and our friend got the chocolate chip cookie and they were a nice compliment to our coffees. We'll be back,1,,
181,Mandy S.,"Beverly Hills, MI",32,80,26,4.0,12/7/2014,"Whoa! If you like quiche, come visit this great little cafe. Served with salad, it's a great breakfast to start your day.",,,
182,Rebecca P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,5.0,2/12/2017,Service is quick. I highly recommend the turkey and cheese quiche! It was the best quiche i have ever had. Coffee is also excellent. Will definitely come back here again to try their other quiche.,,,
183,Rochelle A.,"Jersey City, NJ",197,27,24,4.0,12/13/2016,"Visited for the first time on a lunch break invite from a good friend/coworker, and am I so glad I did! The different types of quiche as well as the pastries are just scrumptious. Everything was super flavorful, but not overwhelmingly so. Meaning, if you have a palate that is not desensitized from an overabundance of junk, you will love this place. The plantain cheese quiche was wonderful in a way that you can't verbally explain the flavor and texture, but must experience it yourself. The guava and cream cheese pastry had the guava really stand out as opposed to countless other times I've had a pastry with that name and wondered where the guava was. The pastry itself, even prior to tasting the filling was already quite delectable. The blueberry scone was not as sweet but would make the perfect breakfast, both filling and satisfying, not the sugar rush that would bring you tumbling down. The matcha mocha latte was good as well and had a cute heart shaped design. Overall a great spot to have some worthwhile and tasty treats in a very chill atmosphere.",,,
184,Olga P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,143,0,5.0,5/19/2014,"I have a serious, chronic problem with this place. Lately, I've been coming here every day.Their coffee is excellent. Excellent. And their pastries are ridiculous. Best almond croissant I've ever had. The apple millefeuille is so good. It takes all of my willpower NOT to get a pastry when I come here.I've never actually tried the ""real food"" here so I can't attest to that but if you want good coffee or good pastries, this is the place.I'd take a star off for the price but I don't have the heart. Technically, if you take each item separately, a medium latte is $4 and a large is $4.50 which, especially considering the quality, is reasonable, and the pastries are around $3.50, which is also reasonable. I guess if you're walking out of here every day having bought over $8 of things that will not give you actual sustenance, it gets to you, but that's an individual problem. The staff is nice and friendly. If you come here often, make sure to get one of those little cards they have. Every time you get coffee, they stamp the card. Get 9 coffees, and the 10th is on the house.",1,,1
185,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,7/10/2017,"There are far better places to go than this.  I saw a number of people walk out without anything, and now I know why.  They chose not to wait in the line like I did.  Starbucks is next door and is probably a lot faster.  The person at the register must be new because she didn't know how to use the POS system.  That's strange because it means she wasn't trained.  Strike 1.  Then, while I was signing on the ipad, she tried to twist it back to her to start the order of the person behind me, but my transaction wasn't over yet.  She was in a rush because she realized the line was getting too long, but I don't want someone else's order on my card.  Strike 2.  Now here's the best part.  The ""barista"" starting my drink put in whole milk when I asked for skim, and then topped it off with skim after reading the ticket, and tried to pass it off as a skim drink!  Strike 3.  What a complete joke.  This place is seriously lacking competent people.  The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because they weren't unpleasant.  Thanks, but I'll take my money elsewhere.  Coffee is expensive enough in this city.",,,
186,Michael S.,"New York, NY",45,34,17,5.0,12/15/2014,"I cannot say enough good things about Tisserie. A new pasttime these past few weekend mornings has been to relax with a house coffee (they brew Stumptown!), one of their assortment of incredible pastries (likely a blueberry muffin or scone), and marvel at the folks who bypass this place and head to the (incredibly crowded) starbucks next door.Kidding aside though, Tisserie offers an incredible selection of fresh baked pastries, properly made coffee and espresso, freshly squeezed juices, and quiches I can't stop thinking about. Do yourself a favor, skip the nearby chains, and go.",,,
187,Travis S.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,5.0,2/2/2014,"Tisserie 55 is by far my favorite coffee shop in Manhattan to get work done while enjoying a delicious beverage. After visiting numerous coffee shops since moving here in August, I've determined that Tisserie fits my criteria for a perfect coffee shop to do work.1. Drinks - Mocha has the perfect mix of strong coffee flavor with smooth chocolate finish.2. Price - 3.50 for a small mocha in a mug. For NYC crazy cheap.3. Internet - free and unlimited. Even when down no problem because you can snatch the signal from the Starbucks next door.4. Seating - plentiful Even have card where you get your 10th drink of your choice for free. Does it get any better than this? If so, I'd love to know about it.",2,,
188,Josh M.,"Miramar Beach, FL",129,12,6,3.0,8/21/2015,Looked great but Yelp had it listed with 1 $ which was way underpriced. I would give it $$ because it was a tiny sandwich for like $8. Everything looked amazing but too expensive.,,,1
189,Diane D.,"Audubon, PA",6,40,18,4.0,11/22/2014,"Great late breakfast...mushroom quiche and mocha.  Sat in the window for some great people-watching.  Since we were eating-in, it would have been nice to have a real coffee cup instead of paper.  But the place is friendly, food is very good and coffee was great, even in paper...",,,
190,Deborah S.,"New York, NY",92,89,4,4.0,10/14/2015,"Although they did not initially want to accept my Amazon Local Deals voucher (which was still valid), and that got things off to a bad start, by the time the food and drinks were ready I was a happy camper. My friend and I both had the very delicious Nutella hot chocolate.Then I ordered the Blue Cheese Tomato Quiche (outstanding), which was accompanied by mixed organic greens and my friend had the brie, walnuts and fig jam sandwich on a croissant. For dessert we shared the Nutella Danish (again, outstanding) and a Red Velvet cookie (nothing to write home about). I will definitely be going back here.",,,
191,Jessica M.,"Grass Valley, CA",12,3,2,3.0,12/15/2015,"While visiting NY I chose to get my coffee here everyday because it was right next to my hotel and my other choice was Starbucks.  They did not know what a London fog was (earl grey and steamed milk, I always say it's like an earl grey latte) and basically refused to make it once I had explained what it was so I had a chai latte which was tasty, nothing that blew my mind, but tastey none the less. They had all sorts of yummy looking croissants and quiches but they only warmed them up to Luke warm.  The cheese wasn't melted on my plantain and Latin cheese quiche, or on the Brie, walnut and fig croissant which makes the food only subpar.  Their Nutella filled brioche also left us wanting...something else.  It looks so cool in there and I wanted so much to love this place but I thought it was only average.",,,
