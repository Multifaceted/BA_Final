0,,8/13/2018,154,,"Houston, TX",Leena C.,146,5.0,419,I left my heart at this NY bar. A lovely bartender name Caroline from Dalton's (see my review) recommended this spot as a fun gay bar coyote ugly style and it did not disappoint.The two main bartenders were hot and friendly. Taylor. TAYLOR. Taylor.  Beautiful and so very sweet for putting up with 5 hens. Lol. He had my heart at hello. I told him about 20 times that I was in love with him secretly lol. There is a whole lotta bar dancing and shots. Do not look needy when they are looking for a shot taker or else you will get passed up. They had great drink specials the night we were there. I enjoyed the music. Country and a mix of 80s/90s. But who is paying attention when hot guys are dancing on the bar? We definitely had a fun time. The crowd was friendly and the staff was fun.Definitely recommend this as a go to spot.,

Not much of a place for dancing but if you want a drink with friends and a hangout spot this place certainly has it. Only 4 stars because I like dancing. lolI will be back.",
2,4,6/20/2018,395,1,"Oakland, CA",Vincent L.,7998,4.0,4085,"I enjoyed everything about this country-themed bar, whether the music (which I don't usually listen to) or the bartenders who are dressed all cowboy-style and dance on top of the bar every now and then.The atmosphere is chill and casual, without any of the attitude that can permeate cruisier places, and drinks are decently priced. For a relaxed, unpretentious good time, this place hit the mark. Thanks Yelpers for a great find!",4

Great spot for ending the night with a large group of friends. The actual layout of the place feels a little crammed and the bathrooms can use a little love. It can feel a bit like a tourist trap with the line dancing on the bar and such, but don't let that keep you away-- this place is worth a visit if you're in the area. Also, love that it is a laid back gay bar where everyone can feel welcome, regardless of how you identify or your orientation --- major props to the staff for making such an inclusive space.",

6,,9/20/2018,0,2,"Alexandria, VA",Kim K.,0,1.0,2,"Came in as part of a bachelorette party, hoping for a fun night with friends. This venue had specifically been recommended to us by several people. We were kicked out because the bride to be was wearing a tiara. We spent over $200 at the bar and yet were surrounded while we were in the bathroom and escorted out due to said tiara. You would think we punched someone in the face. As we asked questions as to why this was a policy (I saw someone wearing a cowboy hat, etc, so clearly not a 'hat policy') they said we were being ignorant. Just because it's a bachelorette party, doesn't mean she's marrying a man. Nor should that matter. No one was being obnoxiously drunk. It was our first stop of the night. Still waiting for an explanation as to why this is a policy. Don't pull the 'a bar can say no open toed shoes' excuse. There's a clear reason behind it and it's garbage.",1
7,,12/26/2017,106,,"Mercer Island, WA",Matt S.,14,4.0,313,So far so good - It's another gay bar with dancers on the bar. Clientele ran the gamut which was refreshing in a touristy kind of way. Cowboy roadhouse theme. It was fun and wasn't too creepy or overtly sexual. Bartender dancers seemed to have a good time and enjoyed keeping their clients happy. Drinks were outrageously expensive even for New York. Worth a visit.,4

It was a cool vibe and the staff was awesome.They dance on the bar to specific songs and have fun. It was a nice, safe break, from the crazy city outside. If you're looking for the bathroom it's down stairs below the ""head"" sign. Definitely recommend you to check this place out. We had a great time and enjoyed the environment.",1

One of the bartenders stood up on the bar, placed a bottle in front of his intimate area, and poured vodka straight into a customer's mouth. This place will not disappoint and you will not be bored. The entertainment factor is there. The music here killed it.  They played other genres besides country music, obviously, gotta cater to a diverse crowd of people. This bar was so much fun. You'd honestly have to be a homophobe to hate on a bar like this. Definitely coming back again.",1

As a Texas girl in NYC I loved the music and that they had The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas playing on the TVs. Felt like home again! The guys dancing on the bar were obviously so fun. It was like a super low-key, gay coyote ugly and I am into it. We went on a Wednesday night around 11, so I'd imagine it gets rowdier on weekends and actually late at night. Gay guys definitely get a heavier pour on drinks than straight girls do, so get someone else to order your drinks!",1

So I told the bartender I was waiting for some friends and I'd have a drink while I waited. So he made it, I sipped it and he said ""that'll be $8"", I gave him my card and he said ""cash only"". Okay, so no prob, where is there a bank or atm around here? He said he didn't know and asked the patron, they said like on 56th...so since I already told my friends I was there waiting, I told him I'd run out when they came so they could watch my stuff and drink to get cash. He REFUSED. He said ""what if u leave and don't come back?""!! So, in essence, he held my drink prisoner for like 15-20 mins till my friends got there. THEN, my friend pointed to an atm that was IN THE BAR!! I hadnt seen it!! (Before u say it, yes I am blind, in one eye)...so all this shit for me not to even have to leave the bar to get my money anyways!! So me and him just avoided each other the rest of the nite...Anywho...the bar stayed empty just a few more patrons came and we left by 8:00. Wasn't a lively crowd at all. The bartenders did get up in the bar and dance but they weren't very fun and outgoing. Maybe it was just an off day...the frito pies were good. Meh, just wasn't too impressed. Also,in the ladies room, there r no licks on the stalls...not good. Oh well, Hell's Kitchen rocks though!!",

The bartenders dance on the bar regularly and also at one point there were all of them in the bar. I've been bar hopping for days. This place was the most laid back atmosphere than any other bar in the village for me. Loved every second.,1

What it actually is is a ""western themed"" gay bar that people come to for a cheesy saloon-style experience. The playlist is 40% pop, 40% Taylor Swift (new Taylor, not even the old stuff that could've passed for country), 15% 90s country to keep with the theme, and 5% modern country music. The bartenders get up on the bar every so often to perform a hacked line dance/butt-slapping provocative act to keep all the boys happy. At least the bartenders were pretty nice while serving their overpriced beer.",

Pros: music, prices, friendly clientele, casual atmosphere Cons: bartenders talking too much to friends and ignoring customers, dancing on the bar got old after the first minute (watch your drink and iPhone or it may get struck by some heavy cowboy boots). Overall a fun bar, I'll be back.",2

However, I do have a soft spot for gay bars/clubs and I haven't gone in years. That being said, I really had a great time here last night with my gay cousins. At this bar particularly, the guys jump onto the countertop and perform a Cowboy Rodeo dance in muscle fit tank tops, extremely tight jeans, and cowboy boots. I swear some of them were wearing butt pads to enhance what their mama gave them. I would say 3/4 of the bar was full of gay men and 1/4 straight women who just wanted to have a good time.",3

This country western bar brings a bit of the South to the Yankees. The bartenders are prettier than a glob of butter melting on a stack of pancakes especially when stomping to Shania Twain.After a couple of the strong pour concoctions you'll be happier than a tornado in a trailer park. I reckon as far as guys goes it draws all sorts of mix. On a busy night better hold your horses trying order drinks but ever  surely you'll get it.

There were a lot more wasted drunks (considering I wasn't ""wasted"" after ONE FUCKING PUSSY SPRITZER in 3 1/2 HOURS!) continuing to be served inside without hesitation, so I can only conclude this place is run by a bunch of VICIOUS EVIL QUEENS.  STAY AWAYFuck New York, go to Amsterdam or Barcelona to party",

Loved the dancing that the bartenders did and decent priced drinks ($12/top shelf mixed drink & $6 coors light). I'm so used to getting raped with no lube in the city for drinks so that was cool. I get that it's a country bar but I thought they would at least throw in a little top 40 song or something but nope-nothing...strraaaaaight country all night. Sorry I just can't really dance to country like that. Other thing I wasn't fond of- they are cash only.

It's so much fun. I already miss our favorite bartender there, Scotty, who moved shortly after we adopted this is our spot. We always get the same back table. We yet have to venture to try their Fritos chips pie, but to be real, this is not a place I would eat at, just drink. After happy hour, their drinks still are fairly priced but we are already buzzed so doesn't matter much. They also have after hours happy hours stating at 11 or 12... (Sorry, can't remember) and you can get two for 1 drinks. the drinks are for anything basically..

I kindly asked whether I could charge using my laptop on my lap (instead of keeping the laptop on the bar top), and he also said NO. This was despite the fact that the bar was HALF FULL, if not less. The bar tender told me I was NOT allowed to ""nurse"" my drink, even though I had ALREADY PURCHASED ONE DRINK AND WE WERE ONLY AT THE BAR FOR 30 MINUTES. So in other words, I would have had to purchase a few drinks per hour to have been allowed to sit at the bar.  It was outrageous that the bartender REQUIRED me to drink more than I felt comfortable drinking (or I was forced to leave).

The bartenders dancing on the bar is classy and the vibe is very southwest which is mandatory. It's tiny compare to the Los Angeles one which has 2 floors and 3 bars. There's also nightly Go-go dancers at Flaming Saddles L.A. but no biggie. You guys are the southwest bar more than a club. Very much a gay saloon ;),

Unlike the other local LGBT establishments such as Therapy and Industry, the vibe is still semi-dance without being clubby at all. The drinks are affordable and they also give out free chips for redeeming no cost beverages later in the night.

Sweet.If you want to know what it feels like to step inside a gay western, walk into Flaming Saddles for quite the unique experience. The distinct features of this bar are the unending country music and the giant wooden bar top. About every other song, anywhere between 1-4 bartenders will hop onto the bar, usually bottle of whiskey in hand, and break out into an intense dance routine. Get up close for a good view and occasionally whiskey pour in the mouth!Always in time with each other and singing to the songs, these guys must put in lot of overtime to get them down. Although I'm not a big country fan, I can only imagine working at Flaming Saddles is a blast.Drinks are decently priced, about $7 for a mug. I'd go more for the show; you easily see the action from the tables in the front and it's far enough away where you won't get your toes stepped on. I'll be back!",

There are some added perks.I think the quality of people here is a little higher here than most bars around. Maybe it's all the county music, who knows. The bartenders are nice, and by that I mean that they look at you and smile when they hand you your drink. They do dance routines to country songs on the actual bar, which is the best part.Drink prices are a little less than average for Manhattan which is nice. The bathroom is gross and smells horrible but at least it can it more than one person. One thing I absolutely hate about. This place is that it's basically a hallway and it's a constant struggle to move past people or get outbid the way of people that want to get by.

The house controls the playlist so don't even bother paying to get music heard. The staff here has no idea what country music is.

(I will never forget his face)As I could not hear him over the music I said beer with my lips as clear as possible. I held out my ten$, the bartender slams down a cup of ice water in a plastic cup. I picked it up, look at it and laughed, he screamed that is what your wanted as I held my ten out.I look at him smile, and said no, I wanted beer, I said it louder and more clear. He quickly turned and within 2 minutes slammed the glass of beer on the table. He snatched the ten out of my hand and gave me four singles. After a brief sip I placed a two dollar tab under the unfinished glass more than half full. He took the top and pushed the beer back in front of me. I proceeded to watch the next guy on the bar Dance. He had walked off the floor, after 3 minutes a security guard pushed into my back and continued to make eye contact as he walked to the corner of the bar and glared at me. I am not sure what the deal was or is with the hospitality I can assure you it was the most impolite, unprofessional bar experience I have had to date in NYC.FYI the bouncer outside was a gentleman as I asked for details about management for s follow up complaint.",2

I'm from nj so worked for me!Started the night here with a round of drinks. Friends and I managed to get a table towards the back near the bathrooms. It's a good angle from which to look around and watch the bar tenders lip-syncing on the bar. It was off-broadway meets country. Fun to watch.

(Yeah, I get kinda uptight about beer, sorry!)The bartenders sometimes danced on the bar, like an alternative Coyote Ugly.  I didn't mind that too much, although the one bartender couldn't stop looking at himself in the mirror, which was kind of funny.The other thing that was kind of annoying was that they were playing country music really loudly and country music videos on all the screens.  The problem wasn't with the music; I like Garth Brooks as much as the next urban guy, but the music on the videos was different from the music being played so it was weird to see a serious/sad video when you're hearing ""she thinks my tractor's sexy"" being played full volume.Overall, I don't get it.  There's a kitsch factor and some campiness going on, but it's not ironic enough to not appear self-conscious.  I wish any new business well, but I give this place til February.  If it was a lame horse, I think you know what I'd do to it.",2

But I don't like the way the place is run, so I don't like going. The Happy Hour ends at 8pm (while other bars, even the touristy Splash, go to 9:30) and doesn't include a lot. Prices overall are far too high: The house beer on draught goes for a ridiculous $10 a pint and its mixed drinks are far too weak for Ninth Avenue standards. And although it sounds fun, the dance-on-the-bar thing is not done well. It's kind of enforced on you rather than being a fun part of the atmosphere. Bartenders dance on the bar to the full song, with far too many verses and choruses, and during that time you can't get a drink and you're politely waiting for the performance to end. It frequently ruins conversations. Because performances are timed somehow, the rigid schedule brings out the worst in the rest of the music. The manager (he usually wears a kercheif)  regularly slips over to the jukebox with his remote control to reprogram with his own choices. So if you make the mistake of inserting money in the jukebox, you are probably wasting cash that you will need for the overpriced drinks. Your song won't come up. The dollar-stealing jukebox -- and the fact it's cash only -- is pretty typical of the way this joint is run, unfortunately.

Very little alcohol/watered down and definitely not cheaper than what you'd find at nearby gay bars. Happy hour specials are pitiful. - Music is country about 90% of the time.

164,,10/11/2011,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Michael H.,0,2.0,7,"I was here over the weekend for my friend's bachelor party.  We did a bar crawl and gave him tasks to complete at each bar.  One task was to get up and dance with the bartenders on the bar.  The bartender went over to ask the owner if it was okay.  She sat there stonefaced and just shook her head no.  Another task was to grab the bartender's butt.  He said he was okay with it, but had to check with the owner.  Again she sat there stonefaced and just shook her head no.  I completely understand that she needs to keep things under control, but it was pretty early in the evening and all in the name of good fun.  But judging by her sour expression, fun is not allowed at this bar.  She seriously needs to LIGHTEN UP.  The gay community is pretty fickle and if she's gonna sit in the corner all night being a buzzkill then she's gonna find herself out of business before she knows it.",1
165,,6/19/2012,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Sebastian S.,0,2.0,5,"Absurd but festive place. The bartenders getting up on the bar and doing their jig is ridiculous. I rather they pay greater attention to getting me drink than chatting amongst themselves then half heartedly dancing something that's supposed to be ""country western."" Instead it resembles a bad country western broadway dance number. Save the dance for your Broadway auditions and GIVE ME A DRINK!!!",
166,,4/16/2013,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Charlie J.,0,1.0,2,"Out of all the bars in the city, this is the first one I bring all my friends to who are in from out of town. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the staff that brings it to life. Up until recently, I have had nothing but amazing things to say about this establishment. However, this past Saturday night marks the second time that I have seen/experienced the same bartender drunk while on the job. As someone who has worked in the service industry for the past 10 years and understands the game, I am embarrassed to bring my friends to a bar where an employee is clearly wasted. I didn't catch the name of this person but they were shorter with dark hair, fumbling their words, clearly having a hard time dancing on the bar, and rude to their customers. There is no excuse for allowing an employee to be drunk on the job. It is a very poor reflection of what I assumed was a pretty well kept establishment. I don't see myself making any effort to come back to this bar anymore let alone bring my friends who are looking for a taste of the south in the big city. If I wanted to go to a bar where the service was as sloppy as its customers, I would move back to Oklahoma.",1
