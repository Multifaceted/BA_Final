Updated review","M&M isn't my usual nail salon, but I was so impressed with their atmosphere and service I'd be happy to consider them my new manicure mothership. When I had a broken nail late one night before a big photoshoot, they got back to my Yelp message right away and fit me in the next day. When emergency strikes, time is of the essence, and you need help now! No wait when I walked in to their cute and calm studio - just a quick fix from their kind tech. They keep their color samples displayed on earring bubbles, a nice touch! She fixed me right up and the price was great, only $5 to fix my broken gel and hook me up with a new one. They also take card, which is nice since not a lot of salons do. I'm happy to call them back up next time I'm ready to get my nails done again! Update: I come here regularly every other month now and my nails are always beautiful, they create anything I show them and my nails get a ton of compliments!!",3,,

Updated review",I've been going here forever. Unfortunately updated prices without advising. They now charge $10 bucks if you have gel from another salon. It's customary not to charge anything if you're getting a new application done.I've seen $10 charge if removing and then leaving. Won't be coming back anymore,,,
2,Kathy Z.,"New York, NY",201,101,297,5.0,11/2/2018,"They never disappoint me! I don't pick an artist, I just do whatever fits my time and every time, none of the artists disappoints, whether it's doing extensions for me, my real nails that's in an okay length or my natural super short nails. My nails are very brittle so sometimes they're not in good shape but this place never fails me. They always make my nails look awesome! They have a lot of technicians and every one of them has skills! I had a decent amount of technicians from here help me and I like each of them. But you should always make appointments ahead of time because there's rarely any last minute openings, they are usually pretty booked. I've tried many nail salons similar to them but they are my favorite so far. I know I can count of them when my nails are in need of an emergency. The techs are very nice and friendly and they really do take their time and get your money's worth. And they always ask if everything is okay, is the shape okay, am I satisfied so far. I wished they had one closer to home. They also have this card (stamp card system except they don't stamp your card lol) there's goodies along the way. So definitely ask for a card if you're going to go there often! I got 10% off one time.",,,

I am writing my review exactly three months after I had gotten my nails done, and they still look amazing, its like i just got it done. No chipping, no breakage, and im gonna go back soon to get my nails done! This place gets booked quickly, so I would make an appointment instead of walking in on the day!",2,,

Updated review","Though my days of coming in here and getting a different design every time are over (because I fell in love with gold chrome, and cannot get anything else without feeling regret...) I love this nail salon and all of their nailists! It is very easy to make an appointment (email, text, call) and the prices are worth it. I can go four weeks without a chip or budge and still get compliments on my nails. That to me says it all. They have a loyalty card that gets you 10%/15% discounts after a certain amount of visits. Be sure to bring cash, especially for tip.",4,,1

Updated review","I'm usually a regular here, but this time I switched technicians and I didn't have such a great experience. I was late for my appointment, but I don't think that makes it okay for the technician to have an attitude. The tech's name is Yako I believe. She didn't cut my cuticles, only used the machine on them when I clearly needed some of it to be cut. She also only put lotion on one hand? I'm not sure if she forgot or legitimately didn't really care. She also charged me for extra topcoat. She didn't ask me or tell me if I wanted extra top coat either... I'll be coming back but I will make sure to go back to the lady I like.",2,,

Not a lot of frills, so less like a spa than other places I've been but I didn't mind cause the quality of the manicure was so high. Did still get a nice hand massage at the end though.

My friend gave me a gift card because I took her here for her birthday and had a nice time getting our nails done together. The actual gift card was on a paper business card, so it was easy to lose and was accidentally thrown out during my apartment move. I messaged this business saying that I had photos of the original card with the reference # and amount, but the owner would not honor it because ""it expired"". What a waste. It's only expired because the business owner chose not to honor it... just pocketed $100 for nothing #grinchmode #holidayspiritinreverse #stealingnotgiving.

12,Yuxin S.,"Boston, MA",2,1,1,1.0,10/28/2018,"I am a regular there, but I was super disappointed by their attitude this time. I made the reservation online and forgot to choose art design option. But even though I did not check for the art design option, I should have a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes for gel manicure and removal. When I had done 2 fingers with designs and others without, my technician said she cant do others and asked me to leave other fingers without design, because next client has already come. At that time I should still have at least 15 minutes left!!!!! It is just so ridiculous. And I was charged for the medium art price, no detailed breakout about how she calculated the price. SHE JUST SAID THE PRICE. I will never ever go to this salon again. Super angry.",,,

Updated review","Tried to come back for the offer of a new pedicure. I had called about a month after the offer and was promised I could come back at any time for the offer, and when I tried months later but within a years time I was told the offer was no longer valid. Very poor customer service and quality work. I have a similar offer of a free blow dry after I received the wrong service from last year, and the offer is still valid.I recommend 28 Nails - its more affordable and my gel stays on for well over 2 weeks.",2,1,

18,Jina L.,"New York, NY",152,6,19,4.0,7/20/2017,"Pro: unique nail art/friendly staffCon: make shift basin for quick feet wash/lack of meticulous cutical careIf you are looking for unique nail designs, this is the place. I picked shades of colors and showed some designs I picked out to Mia and I let her be the expert. She did a great job!If you are looking for the typical salon with massage chair, feet soak, and meticulous cutical care, I would not recommend this place. With that said, for what I was looking for, it was perfectly fine. One sour note - unlike their ad on their site, I think they charged me for gel off procedure unless nail designs on 8 fingers were $25.Regular pedi + gel mani = $65Gel off = $10Design on 8 fingers = $15Total investment = $90",6,,1
19,Fanny F.,"Manhattan, NY",50,25,4,5.0,10/7/2017,"First off, the salon is very cute! Loved the minimalistic feel of the place. Secondly, make an appointment! There were so many people with no appointments that walked in to inquire about same day availability and had to be turned away. Now to actual visit, I had a 5pm appointment yesterday with Fumi. She was super sweet! I went in for a gel removal and new gel set. I usually go to a different Japanese salon further uptown but figured let me try a new place since it's walking distance from my office. Fumi was quick but gentle, we made small conversation throughout the session which was nice. Nails turned out beautifully. I've been strictly going to get manicures from Japanese salons because of the quality in gel they use. It's pricier than your standard gel mani (OPI, Gelish, Shellac). But trust me, it's worth it! My manicures can last up to 6 weeks! Yes, I said 6!Another awesome thing M&M offers is a loyalty card! Unfortunately my current salon doesn't offer that. It's a great incentive to keep returning and saving money on future visits! Thank you M&M, I'll be back very soon!!",,,

I have an event at 6:00 to attend now what should can I do to burn thorough the next few hours. I find M&M on Yelp with great views. I decide to give it a try but I am aware that with it being a Friday and day before New Years Eve I may run into a problem going without an appointment but at this point what can I do. I got super lucky and was able to get a gel manicure and a pedicure. My manicure was done first then pedicure. Not the usual order but I didn't have an appointment so no complaints. My nail artist was Maiko, yup I'm calling them artists because that's what they are. Never been to this kind of salon before. They use paint pots and paint brushes to do your nails. I saw some of the artists doing really cool designs. A lot of the ladies come in with a photo of what they want done. I wasn't that prepared so I kept it simple and they came out so pretty. They said their gel can last 3-4 weeks which would be very impressive. My pedicure went went no issues. They looked very pretty and well done and dried pretty quickly. The staff there was very nice and pleasant. I'll be back again and will make an appointment this time.",4,2,2

Updated review","I have found my nail spot. The girls there creates any design you want or they have their own selections. They are a bit pricier than any other salons that I've been, BUT so worth it. The place and atmosphere is total CHIC. So far I've been there twice and both times was a hit. The ladies there really take their time to make sure your nails are filed properly and not crooked or awkward. If asked, tThey will give you their opinion (not sure if it's honest or not) about color choices and designs. The UV gel that they use are not the ordinary Shellac or Essie, these ones LAST. Attached are some proof. If you don't mind to spend your hard earned moolah and get your digits blinged out - THIS IS YOUR SPOT - however don't get the wrong idea, you will NOT get a hot towel or anything at the end of the service, you will get a short hand massage and that's it. Update 9/8/17: Only 3 days in and lost a stone already. I guess it was expected",,,
22,Katie H.,"New York, NY",76,2,1,5.0,8/15/2017,"This salon is an amazing little gem. I was looking for a place that specializes in fantastic nail art but without the frills of some of the downtown locations (like paintbox and bisou). This place is exactly what I was looking for. Mikiko did my gel extensions and then beautifully and carefully turned my nails into perfect pieces of marble art. I couldn't be happier with the results! I went during off hours and the salon was almost completely empty. They take walk-ins or appointments by phone or email. This isn't the place for pedicures or spa mani treatments. But if you're looking for unique and beautifully crafted nail art, this is the place to go! They even offer a loyalty program!",1,,

Lots of natural light and actual pedicure stations now, but my review is for the gel nails only. Color selection could be bigger, but they seem to be expanding frequently which is good to see. Every time I go my nail color lasts for at least three full weeks, which is incredible since they've never lasted that long when I've gone to other salons. Like Vanity Projects, they use cal gel which comes in little pots and is painted on with an actual paintbrush. My favorite is the white/silver glitter gel (see picture), and while I haven't gotten nail art done here yet, I always see other customers getting designs that always come out amazing. Pricing is average for gel nails of this quality, but they offer discounts for first time customers and have a rewards card. The entire staff is also super nice.",1,,1

36,Alicia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,3,5.0,6/9/2018,"Soooo I am soooo excited to write this review because I have read nothing but great reviews on here about this place and I want to be among them!! Back story: I had been researching, looking for a place that does exceptional gel extensions! Every SINGLE search I did led me to this place! I wanted something closer to Brooklyn but I couldn't deny that this place was raved about! I was the first customer there today and I was blessed enough to get Chiho!!! I didn't request anyone specific when I booked but she was absolutely amazing so she is the one I will be going to from now on! Lol! She is jus absolutely so sweet and really cares that your nails are jus perfect. So in my research I noted that the gel extensions can be pretty expensive but this is for my bday so I was ready to shell out some coins. At M&M the gel extensions range from $60-90 (depending on the type of polish u want (gel or no gel)). In my research I did note that the process is 2 hrs long and I see why. This is a meticulous process! I showed chiho a picture from yelp that I wanted to match the design. She was very clear with me the prices it would be and I appreciate that because In no way was she trying to up-sell me. In fact, she created a beautiful modification of the design that ended up cheaper than what the original would be (and I think it's actually cuter... no shade lol) . All in all I am beyond pleased! But to not outdo themselves, I wanted to get an impromptu pedi and this place is so busy that everything is basically booked in advance but thankfully I was caught in a sliver of free time that allowed me to be squeezed in for a regular pedi.!!  Chiho did my pedi too and she was so soft and gentle. One thing about me is I am super sensitive about my feet. Like I jerk and fuss when they scrub it (yes I am one of those pedicure people lol). When chiho did my feet scrub with the pumice stone it was the most non-fussy I've EVER been in a pedicure. The one thing I wish they had was more of the callus remover. I have rougher bottom feet so I like when they have the callus remover. But No stars removed for that!!! To top it all the way off because i did a gel extension and pedicure they packaged it as a mani/pedi and made my grand total $15 cheaper! CRAZY!!! This was literally they best experience I've had for my nails. The design is gorgeous! My feet are soft and flawless. Made my 3 week appointment for a refill before I left!! Thanks Chiho and M&M!!!",,,

Updated review","I went back to get 3 of my nails fixed because they chipped off within 5 days. Although the lady who did my nails was super nice, she seemed to want me out as soon as possible. She did a horrible job. It is very very uneven, thick, bumpy and on one nail there is a patch of no color polish just the top coat. The top coat is so thick that the color polish looks foggy. You can see a layer of white film on 3 nails that she fixed. I couldn't stay longer to ask them to fix it again because I had to get ready for my own birthday dinner and nor did I want to because the lady just wanted to be done with my nails. Also, she said that the polish came off because I cut my nails but I cut my nails right before I went to the salon and two of my nails chipped off at the cuticle so even if I did cut my nails before they chipped then there should be no reason for the polish to chip at the cuticles.... Also, the next day my other nails started to chip as well.",7,1,
41,Yasmin R.,"Teaneck, NJ",255,333,201,4.0,2/5/2016,"Note to Reviewer:  90% of this score is based solely on my gel manicure/nail art.I stumbled upon this place on Groupon, there was an offer for gel manicure and pedicure for $49 - good deal, so I Purchased.  But what the deal/fine print did not specify was that it applies to select nail techs.  I wanted nail art done by a tech that I read about on other reviews named Sakaya.  However, Sakaya does not take Groupon, so because she is a gem in nail art, I did not use the deal.  So just a heads up - inquire on the techs that take the Groupon deal. As for:The Venue:  Located in Koreatown.   Its basically a 14 x 10 ft room, not your typical nail salon; very makeship - nothing matching, four tables/ chairs.  The Service:  I made an appointment via text, and received a relatively quick response for an appointment the next day evening.  On arrival they were very polite and cheerful.  I arrived 15 mins early (5:45PM) for a 6 PM appt, and my tech was not there yet.  SO I waited, and 15 mins later she appeared.  The Performance:  Oddly enough she started the gel manicure first, which took a little while because of the intricate details to the design I was getting done.  Needless to say I was left very HAPPY AND EXCITED, on a scale from 1-10, I give her a very satisfied 9.   My pedicure was done on a chair that sat high on a wooden block,  and they used a large, oval metal pail to wash my feet in.  Without delving too much into this experience, which was atypical from what I use to, on a scale from 1-10, I give the pedicure a well deserved 1. Payment:  Sakaya is an independent contractor - she accepts CASH ONLY!!! Clearly, I would never go back for a pedicure, but most definitely for nail art.",5,,

I wanted negative space but the nail tech said that my nails were to short. She didn't really have any ideas so I kind of just went with a pink tip looked like a French manicure. Lasted 2.5 weeks I was satisfied. I went back last week had a different person do my nails. I went  with a picture of a flower design she was like I can do it. She didn't sound 100 percent confident so I showed her a cherry blossom design from there IG account. She couldn't do it so we went back to the original picture I brought. It's not what I wanted but it's not bad. Two nails weren't filed properly either. I feel like I've gotten new techs which is ok because that's how you learn but if they're newbie then I feel like a discount should be offered. I'll go back because it's right next to my job but next time I'll call and make an appt and request the popular nail tech from their IG account.,,,
43,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,4.0,12/23/2015,"I'm giving an extra star for the color choices available and well the nail artist is also nice. But I don't think they practice the usual standards of sanitation. My cuticles were cut with a clipper that was dipped in acetone for a moment. The brushes are all sitting in a vase but I don't think they're getting cleaned that often. The one she used to paint the gel on had pink color on it from a previous use. And I came in the am so my guess is that it's had pink color on there for hopefully only overnight.My nail color was applied with a swiftness that ended up in decent color application but I was stuck with some of it on my cuticles since my nails are always on the shorter side. I wanted the clean up service to be a little better. Just a little more attention to detail is always appreciated. I guess if you get an upgrade and do designs which seem to be great from here, they pay more attention to the little things.I was in a small room getting this service which also had two eyelash extension beds. The whole suite seems to be like a three room mom & pop salon (the Asian version) that operates on appointment only services.",6,,1

49,Yeny M.,"Bronx, NY",6,44,21,3.0,3/3/2018,"I booked an appointment via the website  for gel manicure and pedicure. They really take the time and care into the nail art that you want. I took pics and they did the exact replica.They use paint pots and paint brushes to do your nails. I saw some of the artists doing really cool designs. A lot of the ladies come in with a photo of what they want done. I wasn't that prepared so I kept it simple and they came out so pretty. They said their gel can last 3-4 weeks which would be very impressive. The staff there was very nice and pleasant.  Price: not a bargain, but not too steep. They do accept cards, but if you pay in cash make sure your tip is evident. If you are looking for the typical salon with massage chair, feet soak, and meticulous cuticle care, I would not recommend this place. If you are looking for unique nail designs, this is the place.",,,

I booked an appointment less than a day in advance, later that night got food poisoning, called to reschedule and was told I'd be hit with a cancellation penalty. The manager, who mockingly and with laughter in her voice, expressed doubt over the timeline of my booking the appointment and then getting sick, clearly treated me like I was being dishonest with her. She backed off a moment later, but did not acknowledge the condescending treatment. I also cancelled a routine doctors appointment this morning, and that office waived their policy without protest. Policies like this are set to penalize no-showers, not legitimately sick people, particularly those who are telling you they want to remain a recurring paying client. If NYC has more than enough of anything, it's nail salons. Don't patron a place that treats honest, paying customers like liars. I'll bring the $80-$100 I'd have spend in service feed and generous tipping somewhere that knows how to treat people.",,,

I was a few minutes late for my appointment, and I was told they wouldn't be able to do any designs due to time constraints (uhm ok, five minutes is that big of a deal?). I went with a baby pink color, with one white nail and one glued gold arrow on the white nail, matte finish. The precision and application was done well, but it seemed she was in a big rush. I also hated how they used the machine to take off my previous gel color, that can hurt if you get too close to the nail bed!The total came up to around $40 after the yelp discount. I would have considered going back, but my nails CHIPPED two days later, as did my friend's!

When I arrived they took me right away. The ambiance is very calm and relaxing. R&B music plays lightly in the background and the employees work on each customer's nails quietly. I'm so accustomed to noisy nail salons with employees talking amongst themselves but it wasn't like that here. I really appreciated this because I was able to wind down a bit. My nail technician was very gentle and kept asking if I liked everything so far. I didn't get her name but she has very short hair and is super sweet. She was meticulous and took her time. Even when the next appointment arrived, she didn't switch up her pace whatsoever. She made sure my nails looked absolutely perfect and then guided me to the drying station.

63,Deeana B.,"New York, NY",23,28,5,3.0,7/5/2016,"Have been wanting to try this place for a while I was excited to get a last minute appointment right before my baby shower a few weeks ago. After almost 2.5 hours, calgel mani with super cute designs and regular pedi that cost nearly $100 with tip, I left thrilled with the outcome. That was Wednesday afternoon. And you can see from the first photos how great the nails looked.By Tuesday of next week 4 nails have chipped or came off completely. The studio was lovely enough to offer to fix without charging as it was within a week. The problem was the ""fix"" which happened after I sat around and waited for 28 minutes to even start - was simply them globbing more coats on top of the old polish which made the nails look extremely thick and what my acrylic fake nails used to look like in HS. So it wasn't anywhere as nice as the initial work, but I figured simple enough fix till I come back the following week for a new one (though usually my gels last me about 3 weeks). Well 2 more days and you can see from the new pics that the gels just started coming off again. That was on Saturday. It's now Tuesday morning and ALL the polish is off ALL the nails!!! Worst part is due to the thickness when coming off they took off a lot of my natural nail, which took so long to grow, with it. Definitely not worth the premium price for the quality of the service received. And I wants to love you M&M. Wanted to bring my coworkers and clients here but alas... Must look for a new mani place ASAP!",2,,

First, my technician ruined my one of my nails when removing the gel--she used the machine too much and it created a pink line straight across one of my nails. She did not acknowledge or apologize for this. Then when she was cutting my cuticles, she also went a little too much and now I have scabs on nearly all of my fingers. I'm giving them two stars because the art is always nice and what I want, and she is so talented--her name is Chiho, I believe. However I find it surprising that she didn't apologize about ruining my nail. This is not a cheap place. And if I'm dropping that much money to get my nails done, I expect better service than this.

Then I said excuse me and one lady came up to me and asked what I needed. I asked if they took walk-ins, I was looking for a fill-in. She looked me up & down and said no, they were booked. Ok. So then I was curious about pricing. I have acrylic nails. She stated that they do not do acrylic. Ok, so if I get gel then how much. She then starts talking with another female there in their language which I HATE!! And tell me it would start off at $60!!!! WTFFF to start? For a fill-in?? $60 and they're literally located in a dingy, hole in the wall. I walked right out.

Giving 4 stars because as much as they charge, the room itself should be well decorated and have the correct equipment. At first I was very confused because there were no pedicure chairs just two chairs on a high blocks. So my girl had to drag in a metal bucket of water! I felt so bad for her but thankfully the water was the perfect temperature and everything went smoothly. My toes look great but I am a little concerned about the cleanliness of their tools. 3. This is probably the best gel manicure I've ever gotten. Maiko took her time filing and fixing my nails. I love the Japanese gel technique/paint pots that they use! She paid extra attention to my nails and I am in love with the outcome! The nail art was $22 on top of the $60 gel mani & reg pedi which I was fine with. The little ""love"" was $2. After the 20% coupon & tax it was about $72 which I think is well priced because of how tedious my nail art was. My nails are smooth and shiny and ain't budgin any time soon!4. They do take the 20% off coupon advertised, so there was no problem with that. They also give you a rewards card so that on your 5th visit you get $10 off and on your 10th you get $20 off.

79,Trisa T.,"New York, NY",199,401,583,3.0,1/14/2016,"My go-to place in the city is Fresh Spa (near Union Square) but ever since I moved I've been trying to find a place closer to my new apt. I think I need to give up my search and just stick to what I know. Came hear after reading about the great Groupon deal. It is in fact, great! $22 for gel manicure. I called and made an appointment no problem. You can even text or email them if you want, which is nice. You can walk-in but because they only have 2 stations you take your chances. I got a regular gel manicure, no nail art. White, very basic.What I liked: The girls were friendly and they seemed very meticulous. Place seemed clean and well kept. Why I was disappointed: The technique was time consuming. Instead of doing a coat of polish on each hand and rotating between the UV light (like every other gel manicure I've ever had), she did 2 fingers at a time, which took twice as long. And despite what I thought was attention-to-detail, my manicure was sloppy! Polish was all over the base of my nail bed and cuticles. I guess others had the same experience. See Brenda H.'s photo! I could tell she was trying to clean things up, as she kept using a nail stick to scrap away the excess polish, but it still turned out shoddy. At their regular price for gel manicure ($40), I wouldn't come back. However, their expertise seem to be in nail art, which based on the pictures, seems like a good bet. One final note: the gel they use here is strictly a Japanese brand (ace gel?). They don't have any of the usual OPI, CND or Essie stuff. This type of gel comes in a small tub and is applied using a small brush (versus a standard nail polish bottle where the brush is embedded in the cap). The color selection is decent but doesn't offer great hue variation. Tips on location: Look for the eyebrow threading salon. Walk through the entrance but pass the salon on your right and go down the hall. At the end of the hall go right and down a second hall. At the end turn right again (at the florist shop) and M&M's at the very end.",1,,

83,Raven R.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,4/23/2017,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! They have become EXTREMELY DESPERATE and GREEDY since they moved to the new location on 6th Avenue! The SERVICE is HIT or MISS depending on who you get!  I started going to them in May 2016 after seeing a Groupon and wanted to get my nails done. The hours of the Groupon offer did not align with my availability, so I got regular priced service which was base rate of $60 for gel manicure and pedicure and more when they ask you what you do for a living and started raising there prices when they perceive that you can afford to pay more. I got manicures and pedicures each time by a different person. Sometimes it last for a couple weeks, some times chipped after a few days and the my luckiest lasting almost three weeks. After trying the different manicurist I started requesting Maiko, as hers had lasted the longest and I wanted to develop some type of service relationship so I can get the results that I want instead of constantly going to different stylist and salons. Well, my loyalty recently backfired in the worst way! Maiko isn't perfect either, however, customers like me who are thoughtful and generous has sent her clients and been kind to her and the salon, so now she thinks she is the best thing ever! I had an appointment on April 1st and 3 days later they started texting me RUDE and demanding messages to inform me that Maiko's price will be $5 more moving forward. I responded letting them know that they didn't need to text that to me as I just visited the salon and this was unnecessary. They claimed they that Maiko started to charge extra because of her skills and many request, but I could take other manicurist with the same price. I told them that this is a horrible way to do business as I felt harassed! They could just raise their over price if they are so desperate to pay their rent! YES, when I was getting my pedicure the landlord came in and was asking for the rent that was OVERDUE. Very awkward!!!The owner Miho contacted me and apologized for the nasty messages they sent to me, saying that she didn't approve of them sending me any message, she had told them to let customers know of the changes when they call to make appointments. I had made my appointment before leaving the salon, so she offered t honor the old price. However, while I was out of the country on vacation, over a week prior to the appointment they started to text me again to find out whether or not I am coming in to my appointment! Hence the desperation! (They usually confirm 24 hours before the appointment not over a week). I asked them to refrain from texting me as I was out of the country and would incur charges. I certainly wasn't thinking about my nail appointment when I am all the way across the globe! They are obsessed and crazy and I figure they were just trying to make sure they had the spot filled, as they were nasty to me and didn't know whether or not I would return!I decided to face them 2 days after I returned from my trip. I had my plans, I am very busy and I decided not to let their stupidity get to me, so ""stupidly"" I gave them another chance!!!!! Bad decision. One person did my pedicure which is horrible! They never gave good adequate pedicures anyway...Now they raise the combo gel manicure/pedicure to $65 start price and they don't even use any proper exfoliating products. I self-care at home, so I usually got it because I was getting the manicure, however, it is extremely basic and leaving much to be desired! This last manicure that I got from Maiko is horrible as well, done without much care and some hostility I gather from her not getting her extra $5 as they agreed to do it for the regular price! The thing is, these people have gotten no less than $95 each month I stepped in their salon. I always got a little extra design and all of that added up, plus tips each and every time!!! Remember since May 2016! Yet, April 21st they were all icy cold and nasty, especially Maiko who told me that she didn't know her schedule for next manicure because she might be going somewhere!!! Just ridiculous! She is also very jealous of my traveling, as she has stated, so that was her way of ""shading me""!  I didn't expect this type of nastiness and jealousy of clients from a nail salon. They don't even offer water to their clients...no tea no nothing!!! They suddenly have this big BAD NASTY attitude because they put out a Groupon to pay their rent and they have some new customers, so they think it is okay to abuse people who have been loyal to them, even when they weren't that great! PLEASE TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE! There are so MANY other proper nail salons who will give a chic gel manicure and pedicure. Some even give you wine, champagne and other accommodations, without all the attitude and their price is just about the same! Don't let the $65 fool you, you WILL be spending A LOT more when they nickel and dime you for every little thing. Your nails may CHIP AFTER A COUPLE DAYS!!!",6,1,
84,Jenny C.,"New York, NY",6,74,6,4.0,1/15/2017,Very reasonably priced for the quality of their nail art. $60 for a gel mani and regular pedi plus $18 in design surcharges. The technicians are meticulous and super sweet to boot. Will definitely return.,,,
85,Bethany C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,1,2.0,8/23/2017,"I wish this place was nice. I didn't have a BAD experience but it was just a cheap joint. Pedicure was $28 and no massage chair, not the usual array of color choice, there weren't even magazines. It was just kind of rigged- IKEA chairs and a small sink on top of wood crates to create a pedicure 'area.'  And the paint job was messy. Again, it wasn't awful but I wish they'd put a little more into the experience.",,,
86,Trista W.,"New York, NY",21,18,16,5.0,9/26/2015,"Great place to put on your list of TOP nail art salons of NYC. It's an authentic Japanese hair/lash/nail salon in the heart of Ktown. The business is extremely small in the back hallway of a building, but the excellent services and skills makes up for it. I will definitely come back here after checking out other places on my list. There's currently a groupon for $22 and you can add art/decoration on top of it. My total came out to $27 on top of the groupon. Which is an incredibly reasonable price compared to other places I researched. The ONLY thing I wasn't so happy with was their sanitation. The technicians looked really busy, but I just wished they would sanitized the tools before taking another customer. This place gave me a great first experience for nail art. Would strongly recommend.",3,1,1
87,Anjelica S.,"Manhattan, NY",20,25,8,5.0,5/20/2017,"I found M&M through Yelp while looking for a new place to get my nails done. For some background, I was sick a few months ago to the point where I lost most of my nails. Recovery had been slow and I finally grew them all back and was seeking a new nail place to do gel and keep my nails relatively healthy. I contacted them through Yelp and they texted me a few hours later. I scheduled my first appointment with Fumi. I was a little early when I showed up, but was seated rather quickly. One nail tech worked on my nails and prepped them for Fumi, which really helps out instead of having just one person do everything. Fumi was so detailed and took her time and I was really happy with my nails, that I scheduled a follow-up for a few weeks later. Naho did my nails next and I have not looked back since. This past month, I got gel color extensions with chrome and I've been so happy with them and have gotten nothing but compliments. Unfortunately, my nails did end up breaking twice - which I don't blame on them, as I have fairly brittle nails along with not being used to long nails. The first time, since it was within the week of me getting the extensions, they repaired it for free.I would definitely recommend this place - it's worth the time and money.",1,,1
88,Mindy H.,"Colton, CA",74,8,0,5.0,7/1/2017,Love love love this place! The girls are so kind and talented. Seriously the best gel mani I have ever had. And it legit lasts over 2 weeks!

89,Christina S.,"New York, NY",157,13,1,2.0,5/26/2017,"Not a great experience. Got a pedicure and she barely scrubbed my feet or used the stone. Had to ask her to apply a third coat because you could see through the polish. Drying time took forever. I told them the machine wasn't working and they said ""sorry!"" Instead of doing something about it.",1,,
90,Elle P.,"Tenafly, NJ",105,180,68,3.0,5/15/2017,"Overall, it was a very mediocre experience. Decided to try out this nail salon with a Groupon for a gel mani / pedi and found they were really not accommodating about scheduling an appointment and were quite inflexible. The actual experience was fine. It took more time than I would like. They use Japanese gel and paint brushes (rather than typical gel polish brands). The space was nice, bright, and airy, but will not be coming back. Also, given the quality of my final manicure (just okay) it would definitely not be worth the full price.",1,,
91,Caroline H.,"Manhattan, New York City, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/24/2018,"Unfortunately my nails looked better before than after my manicure. Every nail got a different shape and when I mentioned this, they did not even see the issue. I went to the cvs right after to buy some nail products to try to fix it myself. Waste of time and money.",,,
92,Mel B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,65,24,5.0,10/13/2015,"Came here with a Groupon deal for $22 for one gel manicure. I booked last minute and they were quick to respond via email (I always hate calling to book appointments when I'm at work, so it was super convenient for me). I arrived a few minutes early and they took me right away. The studio is small, not very pretty and tucked away in the back of the building, but none of that really matters to me as long as they are friendly and care about the work they're doing.I actually asked for a special design on my nails, so it came to $20 additional for all ten, which is a fair deal, considering the Groupon. If you want something particular, I think it's best to email them the photo ahead of time and come with a print out photo. The manicure took a little over an hour.This place is convenient for me to get to and the woman who worked on me took her time and was very polite. I'll come back here - especially since they have a punch card!",1,,
93,Jackie Y.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,4,1,1.0,8/5/2016,"I really, really wanted to love this place. Especially since I get my eyelashes done next door every other week. But this place was beyond the worst. They honestly lost a valuable customer today. I have gotten nail art religiously in LA. And my eyelash and nail places were at the same place so i was hoping for the same in NYC. The girl that greeted me as I walked in was great. She had a bubbly personality and very accommodating but then... 1. I was 30 mins early which I mentioned I might be since I was getting my eyelashes done right before. But the lady I was assigned to was doing someone else's toes so I had to wait an extra 10 mins which ended up being 40-45 wait. Which I was ok with.2. Then when she actually got started with my nails, the customer she was helping right before found something wrong with her toes that were just painted so the nail technician literally stopped doing the designs on my nails to redo the other customer's toes. If I was drying my nails I honestly wouldn't have been so mad. And then on top of that the technician didn't wash her hands after touching someone else's toes and back to my hands3. I don't think the tools are sanitary. I'm always used to technicians ripping out the tools from those sanitizing bags or dipped in Barbicide but my technician was cleaning it by pumping some alcohol on it. Her tools were literally used on someone's toes right before using them on mine4. Please see attached picture of my fingers. I got them done 5 hours ago today.",2,,

95,Steph W.,"Manhattan, NY",191,122,60,4.0,7/8/2015,"Found this place on Groupon and bought a deal for the gel manicure ($22). As I wanted nail art I paid an additional $26 for my design. This place was a bit hard to find. The store shares the same address with like 5+ other shops so finding this place was a bit difficult, as the shop is located in the very back. I brought in a design for Sayaka to reference. She was very meticulous and the design came out amazing! I would recommend her/ come back again :)I recommend calling in advance and making an appointment - this place is extremely small and serves only 1 client at a time for nails.

96,Leanna T.,"Jersey City, NJ",591,136,112,3.0,6/16/2016,Super sweet ladies! Im giving them 3 stars because it took them 2 hours to do a pedi and gel mani. One week later my gel peeled off. One thing i really do appreciate  is that the nail technician mixed her own gel colors for me since she didnt already have it because she knew i had a wedding to attend too and the color needed to be duplicated like the nail polish.,2,1,1
97,Lyss B.,"Freehold, NJ",6,13,1,5.0,8/5/2016,"I love this place so much that I'm writing this review as my toes dry!This is my new favorite nail salon. I came here for the first time 3-4 weeks ago for a new set of extensions and a pedicure. I was blown away by the quality of work and customer service. I have been getting gel extensions done in the city for years, and never had I loved a set more than the set I got from this salon. Their products are high quality and the prices are 100% reasonable. They do beautiful art (check their IG) and flawless work overall. For a pedicure, extensions, and gel polish I spent $110. That's less than most of the other salons I've been to, but their quality is 100000x better! I came back today for a gel fill, gel polish, and a regular pedicure and was pleased yet again! My nails and toes look absolutely perfect, and the women were even nicer this time (and I didn't think that was possible)!! They gave great recommendations on colors, and aren't pushy to up-sell you. I highly recommend coming here but definitely call and book an appointment first! There are only a few stations so they book up quickly. This isn't some in-and-out salon, though, so make sure you have the time to spend. Both visits were about 2 hours for nails and toes, but I also choose a more detailed type of nail work (long gel extensions) so if you're coming for a regular gel mani it might not take as long. They also just moved to a new location, and the space is much nicer than their old salon. Overall, love love love this place. 100000% worth the visit!",1,,
98,S O.,"New York, NY",2,12,0,4.0,11/21/2017,"They did a decent job on the gel manicure.  My only criticism is that they use an electronic file on cuticles rather then just trimming. And the too much space between cuticle and polish. Good location if I'm in a pinch in mid-town; however it won't be my go to spot.  They are friendly, however my technician was not fluent in English so communication was a little difficult.",,,
99,Paulina S.,"Burnaby, Canada",0,1,0,1.0,3/7/2017,"Getting nails done in New York has been a complete and utter nightmare. I went into this place to fix a broken gel nail and the nail tech was kind but clearly inexperienced. I walked out with my nail way too long compared to the rest of my nails and had to go back to get her to fix it. She couldn't do a coffin shape, a very very common shape, so I have one nail a different shape then the others. The nail was incredibly thick and flat on top. There was a clump of clear gel on the underside, which is very gross when you touch your nail. and it hasn't even been a week and the nail is lifting.... seriously!? 2nd largest city in the world and I can't even get normal gel nails done. If you're a girl who knows a lot about gel nails don't go here or you will be disappointed.",2,,
100,Ting Hua C.,"Manhattan, NY",94,3,154,2.0,3/19/2017,"Went there for three times, and the service never satisfied me. Therefore I only go in for removing gel nails from other places since it's near my place.",1,,
101,Whitney B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,1,1.0,2/19/2017,"Great customer service, but bad quality!

I've been here twice and on my first encounter (thanks to a Group On deal), one nail chipped after 4 days and I returned for them to fix it, which they did. That manicure ended up lasting ~2 weeks. I returned around Valentine's Day weekend (they offered a $5 discount) and one nail chipped the next day. 3 days following, the gel from a whole nail came off and I again returned for them to fix it, along with 4 other nails that had chipped. 1 week after my manicure, the complete polish from a nail has come off, after lightly brushing it against a counter and 1 other nail has chipped.",2,1,

I'm at two weeks now and my nails still look amazing. The color hasn't faded and I still love just as much as the day I got it done.The specialize in nail art and design so I would only recommend gel mani/pedis.

The nail salon I went to before this one filed my one of my nails so much you can see through to my skin because the nail is so thin. So the nail is quite sensitive and filing causes pain.

I made the appointment and two days later I am sitting in the chair.  The location seems like it's a shady place but it's not.  The salon itself is cozy and frankly just perfect.  It's the best place to go with four of your friends and take it over.  Seriously.

Miho was not social and did not start up a conversation during the entire process. I don't expect a therapist, but cmon!

Make sure you have plenty of time because they take a while, but only because they are so detailed and careful with every step. If you have gel on already, they will make sure they get every single bit of it off, which many salons don't do! They also massage your hands and feet a little bit for free. They cut my nails exactly how I wanted them, and they were very gentle. Loved my gel mani and gel pedi. The two women next to me were getting nail art and the technicians did not take so long on them, but the art was AMAZING. The clients were so excited about their nails. If you get gel mani and gel pedi, it's $80. What a steal in Manhattan. Also if you come 5 times, it's $10 off your next visit, and ten times gets you $20 off!

The service was really good. Normally I would prefer that only one person do my nails, but in this case it worked well! They try to stick to their appointment schedule, so one girl began the preliminary, filing, then another girl came to continue until the end. I must say she did an amazing job! She took her time and care with my nails which is what I seek with the experience. Also, I showed them the nail color I wanted from a pic and they happily blended two colors to make it for me! The way she placed the gel on my nails was art! She didn't use simple nail polish bottles. She blended a color on a piece of foil and uses a full length paint brush and did an amazing job! I requested a matte color finish, although simple, love it! It costs $40 for the gel mani and $5 extra for the matte finish. The groupon however was $22 so I think I got a great deal especially for the meticulous care that was taken with my nails! The only negative part is how they are not easy to find, when you go as I recommend that you should just walk all the way to the back and make a right!

131,Sabina S.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",4,30,2,5.0,9/16/2015,"Satomi is the bomb. A few tips:Call and tell them exactly what you want - gel/mani pedi plus nail art. I didn't say I wanted nail art so when I came in for my appointment they only had time to do a mani, but I loved it! This place is hidden and definitely a tiny salon, the work is top class. Highly recommend it for a special occasion!",,,
132,Alyson A.,"Dumont, NJ",144,11,0,5.0,8/5/2015,I had been looking for a nail place in the city that A) did beautiful Japanese gel nail art that doesn't damage natural nails and B) didn't cost an arm and a leg. This place fit the bill completely! I used the groupon for 22 for a gel manicure and it is so worth it. I explained what I wanted to Sayaka and knew exactly what I meant. She really took her time and made my nails perfect!Like other reviews said it's a little hard to find but just look for a threading place and follow the signs all the way to the back. Be sure to book ahead of time and make sure you have a lot of time to relax. Wish I lived in the city all the time so I could come here. Overall awesome!,,,
133,Laita C.,"Boston, MA",0,27,6,5.0,8/2/2016,"The best. They did nail art with gel at an incredible price. It only took an hour even if what i had asked for had been very meticulous work. The studio was brand new and had some communication barriers with some of the staff, but if you are getting nail art, in so far as you know what you want, you should take a picture and they will do it exactly! It was a great experience and I will def go back! Its been almost 2 weeks and I cant tell the difference!",,,
134,Lisa J.,"Manhattan, NY",133,32,0,1.0,1/30/2016,"The employees are very nice but service is a different story. When I first came in, there's only two employees working here. Chloe that handles nail care and Satomi handles nail art/ painting the nails. I came in at 5:30 and Chloe started cutting my nails, filing etc etc after she was done, I had to wait 30 mins for Satomi to finish her other client. Satomi asked me what nail art I wanted and she agreed to do 2 glitter nails and 2 nail art and once she started paint my nails, she changed her mind and told me I can only do one nail art and one glitter nails. I had to ask to add one more glitter nail....She painted my nails super quick and gave me a sloppy job with nail polish all over my fingers  (on my skin not on the nails) which I pointed out for her to remove...... I literally had to direct her to do everything since it seems like she didn't want to do anything and rushed to paint my nails so she could help someone else since she was the only one who does the gel nails.   Long story short, one of the uv machine broke so I had been waiting for a long time there to cure my nails while the employees paid no attention to me.... Finally, Chloe saw that I was still there and came over to notice my nails still was not finished and put some top coat on my two thumbs and switched the gel machines. By that time it was already 7:15ish and my reservation was at 5:30. Also, you girls out there know that your hands are dry as hell after getting a gel manicure and I noticed my hands were dry so I had to put lotion on myself......at this time I was already fed up with the service and wanted to go home already since I was there for almost two hours for a gel manicure!! At the end, I still left a good tip because I felt bad since they were nice. Once I got home, I noticed that Satomi didn't even put any gel top coat except my two thumbs which Chloe was the one who applied it and now most of my nails look matte while my two thumbs are shiny as hell. Super dissatisfied and super disappointed because I really wanted this place to work out. They should hire more nail technicians who has knowledge and is able to apply uv gel.",3,1,1
135,Suruchi K.,"Providence, RI",0,19,3,2.0,3/23/2017,"I went for a gel manicure about 10 days ago. The gel is great and hasn't chipped or lost its sheen but it applies much thicker than any other gel manicures I have gotten at other places. They use some special nail paint that comes in small pots. As for the manicure itself, I left pretty dissatisfied. The woman who did my nails just pushed my cuticles without applying anything to soften them first and cut them dry which didn't look very finished. There was also no hand massage, just applied some moisturizer on my hands. So now I have gel nails with uneven cuticles growing back. Having said all of this, the people were polite and welcoming so the two but I am on the fence about going back.",,,
136,Rachel S.,"Manhattan, NY",7,6,4,5.0,7/15/2015,"A bit closet-like in atmosphere, but worth the crammed conditions. Sayaka is lovely & talented. She knew exactly what I wanted when I described it & she painted my nails like a true artiste. I'll be back!",,,
137,Tessa C.,"New York, NY",334,2,0,5.0,5/18/2016,"Initially went here for a Groupon. This is one of my favorite spots in NYC to get nails done. You have to make an appointment so you know you're not going to be waiting around for someone to open up. It's small but the women are extremely good at what they do. Really loved coming here and will def be back. Also note, it's not luxurious by any means but you can tell they care about how your nails look which I appreciate.",,,
138,Maga M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,2/10/2017,Found this gem of a salon on Groupon and loved my gel manicure! The ladies here are super friendly and professional and I look forward to going back!,,,
139,Nicole B.,"Hoboken, NJ",18,16,2,5.0,5/23/2016,"Sayaka is awesome.  Spent two hours meticulously making my nails perfect, was professional and patient when I couldn't pick a design, and basically let me pick whatever I wanted.",,,
140,TJ W.,"Manhattan, NY",17,6,2,4.0,3/2/2016,"I always come here before a special event like a work conference, weddings, or my birthday because the design and attention to detail is hard to find anywhere else. Make an appointment if you don't want to wait. Use the reward card for discounts or even better, check  Groupon before your first visit. It's expensive, but a great treat if you want to deviate from the boring ubiquitous solid color manicure.",,,
141,Catherine L.,"Manhattan, NY",43,1,0,4.0,7/8/2016,"I get my hair done by Miho, and it's in the same place as they do the nails. I was looking at the amazing work they do.  The colors and designs blow my mind. True talent! You've got to try it. They are moving to a larger location because they are so busy. Check it out! In the next few weeks they'll be at 818 6th Avenue-2nd floor. Right now they are at 3 East 33rd Street  (right off 5th Ave)",,,
142,New Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,78,11,1.0,"7/18/2016
            





Updated review","The answer of owner pretty much speaks for itself and showcases owners understanding of ""customer service"". Nope, Miho, in other salons I get a good quality regular nail polish for half of price. Since you are offering ""just a regular nail polish"" maybe it makes sense to charge just a regular price for it and not double? Also it's gonna be nice to have a disclaimer on your website with info that you are offering just a bad quality regular nail polish because some of customers might mistaken you for a good quality nail place, which, obviously, you are not.",3,1,1
143,Mary Y.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",0,25,13,5.0,1/3/2016,"I loved this place so much that after purchasing a groupon for a gel manicure, I purchased the Yelp deal for this as well.The location is very difficult to find (inside a small doorway at the very end of a winding hall of storefronts) and the technicians were very patient in providing directions.Quality of the manicure is comparable to the ones I've gotten in Tokyo. They can imitate any design as long as they have the material. Selection of colors and 3D studs were great as well. As the salon is very small, be sure to book several days ahead of time.",,,

146,Kathleen S.,"Ithaca, NY",0,3,0,5.0,12/29/2016,I can't say enough nice things about this place!  They really take their time to get your nails done exactly the way you want.  I've gone here three times now and each of my gel manicures have lasted three weeks without any problems.  Definitely going to make this my go-to place!!!,,,
147,Lyuh K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/27/2016,"I loved M&M. Everyone was polite, and despite the fact that I asked for a very intricate pattern and art on my nails, it was done perfectly. They last long (none of the jewels fell off) even when I tend to use my hands carelessly! I'll definitely be visiting again. If you want amazing gel nail art, this is the place!",,,
148,Ipsita D.,"Union City, NJ",2,67,25,2.0,7/6/2016,"I used Yelp to find a nail place near to where I was one day, and given the high star rating I expected much better. Seems if I read closer though that the stellar reviews are more for one particular nail tech who is running her own separate biz through the place doing specialty manis (with designs etc--which from what I heard her quote to ppl are quite expensive)! The place is just a room at the very end of a long winding corridor, confusing to even get to. Glad I brought my own polish since there was not much regular polish choice. And the pedicure is just shoddy--basically there is a regular chair against a wall, then they get a metal bucket & plop your feet in! So odd. The girl didn't seem to know much about what she was doing, maybe that's why another lady was standing over & watching. Then had a different girl for the manicure. There's no reason for the regular mani to be so expensive (almost as much as the pedi!), they do just barely the minimum. And there are no proper dryers! They placed a fan near my feet, and later another fan near my hands (and they were tripping over the wires)! So even though I was there forever it's not surprising that my toenails smudged in my closed-toe shoes, and even my fingernails were a bit bumpy & smudged. It's good I used my own polish as I had to re-do a lot myself. So I basically just wasted money going here.",1,,
149,T W.,"Austin, TX",0,3,1,5.0,9/29/2016,"My appointment was at 11 am, they were there ready to go right at 11 and were patient when I couldn't get my Groupon to load on my phone. In addition, Miho took her time filing each of my nails to the shape I asked for and did not pressure me to try anything that I didn't want. She did an excellent job,  I will definitely be back in 2/3 weeks when my nails grow out.",,,
150,Song J.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,5.0,12/26/2015,"I will consider  M&M my first option the next time I need gel manicure,  and quite frankly,  it should really be my number 1 go-to place for mani pedis, plus they also do lashes, I might make this a one stop shop! Maiko did a wonderful job on my toes and my gel mani is so pretty,  I could not be happier. The difference is she really pays attention to details,  without you having to say too much;  she shaped my nails exactly the way I liked, and she really tried to find theperfect color I wanted for my vacation,  even tried several customized colors by blending 2 colors. We ended up putting a tiny little gold bead on all ten fingers, after seeing how pretty it was when she placed just 1 finger to test and see, and I loved it! Service is great, they are sweet, nice, and very attentive, and they are not greedy or pushy, what a big difference from so many nail salons in the city! Location is convenient too!",,,
151,Adrienne S.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,4.0,11/29/2016,"I used to frequent another nail salon that was getting a little too pricey. This salon is nice, the techs are good and the pricing is reasonable. Still feeling it out, but have had all positive experiences thus far.",,,

153,Rita R.,"Briarcliff Manor, NY",5,15,0,2.0,4/14/2016,"What nail salon doesn't have a nail dryer? $10 (before tip) for a color change and it took a solid twenty minutes to awkwardly put my hands on a fan, which didn't really work. I don't like negatively reviewing small businesses, but this is like a business person going to a mtg without a pen. Not professional. Maybe they do great nail art, but not standard manicures.",1,,

156,SM S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,2.0,8/13/2016,Unfortunately the bio sculpture gel mani only lasted a week. The first try I thought it was because it was too thick and the edges weren't smooth which makes it peel. I tried again - same thing - barely lasted a week. I really wanted it to work as their location is great for me. I'm back to Yukie for the gel manicures. They last 3-4 weeks. If I didn't hate the grow out probably could go even longer.  If M&M can perfect their technique I'd give them another try.,,,
157,Sydney C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0,5.0,7/19/2016,"I've been here twice for gel mani - gel design the first time and simple nude color gel for second. Fumi did my nails and she is AMAZING. Very very meticulous and so attentive to all my needs. She is literally the only one I can go to in Manhattan since I have very high standards for nails and very nit-picky (I'm from Seoul so I'm used to getting perfect nails done everytime! ;) ) With Fumi, I don't even have to point out the minor flaws since she examines the gel very closely and fixes every small things.
