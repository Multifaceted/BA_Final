0,Tiffany N.,"New York, NY",129,96,86,4.0,11/5/2018,Nickel & Diner was a great find for creative and tasty breakfast options. Make sure to order a glass of coffee - super good and strong. My party and I also ordered the cashew bowl. What a beautiful composition and perfect for pictures. This dish was one of the more healthier options and it did not disappoint!IG: @twomorebites,1,,1
1,Abby B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",564,2,0,1.0,11/4/2018,"If I could give Brett our bartender 5 stars, I would. An establishment like this is lucky to have her. Her service was fantastic. We ordered the lemon zest pancakes, avocado eggs Benedict and salmon Benedict. Our food came out cold, we politely asked if we could have a fresh order warmed. To us, this wasn't a big deal, it's busy and things like this happen! Brett was understanding and apologetic, always had coffee refills ready and did everything she could to get our food out. She's also doing this alone, mind you. There are other customers she has and she now has to fix a kitchen error, not fair to the other guests. The food came out again, not all at the same time, and cold. No manager ever came and spoke to us, coffee was taken off the check, but still a pretty steep bill considering the food was relatively inedible,and we had to eventually get breakfast somewhere else. In addition when coming out of the restroom the manager almost ran me over (it's busy, I totally get it) when I said ""oh sorry"" he gave me a look of disgust and kept moving. I get it, brunch and breakfast is busy, but the lack of care really showed from management and I unfortunately don't think we'll be coming back again.",,,

I had the spicy margarita which was perfect, and it truly was a bit spicy on the rim.For dinner, I had the chicken and waffles.  The waffles were crisp, yet fluffy on the inside. The chicken was cooked to perfection. It came with some absolutely delightful maple syrup.Our server was very friendly and made sure that we were well taken care of.The atmosphere is a great mix of casual, classy and elegant -- all at the same time.   Not sure exactly how to describe it; however, I would most definitely return again.",,,1
3,Jo K.,"New York, NY",271,505,429,5.0,10/23/2018,"Nickel & Diner has been one of the most pleasant surprises in my NYC dining experience in my recent months. I went there as it was a very convenient location to have a quick lunch with a good friend and it turned out to be a really wonderful meal. First off, the decor is very nice inside considering the outside looks like a random Chinatown building. The service was excellent and we were seated quickly. We ordered the burger and a lunch special lamb and both were honestly divine. The burger was juicy and on a brioche bun and the lamb was so flavorful. I would definitely come back when I were to be back in the area.",2,1,2
4,Andrea A.,"Philadelphia, PA",507,137,271,4.0,8/5/2018,"Really great brunch when you want to eat healthy but also need a detox from weekend festivities. The cashew grain bowl was phenomenal. Simply outstanding. My only pet peeve was that the ingredients didn't match the menu. No asparagus, instead of kale we got spinach and the cashew was chopped so small, you couldn't really taste it. But it was still absolutely delicious.  Also highly recommend the pancakes. Just sweet enough.",2,,1
5,Anna N.,"Manhattan, NY",61,199,240,3.0,9/24/2018,"I was impressed with the beautiful and modern décor. The bathroom was also clean. It's spacious inside. I enjoyed my eggs benedict. It tasted great and had lovely presentation. My friend enjoyed her chicken and waffles. The chicken was very tender. I was not impressed with service. The restaurant was mostly empty when I arrived, and I had to flag a waitress down to take our order. That's inexcusable when the place isn't busy. I also saw a lot of staff standing around and not being attentive. Food is great, but service needs work. I would try again if I was in the area.",2,,1
6,Kevin Z.,"New York, NY",140,437,586,4.0,7/24/2018,"Was here for a Saturday dinner with friends. Was seated at 6:30 and was pretty empty. We had Jake as our server and he was pretty welcoming at the get go. My partner got a glass of bubbly and the pour was VERY generous. The bubbles quality seemed  was fresh. The food's pretty inventive. We had some spiced watermelon and croquettes and were good balance for warm and cold apps. To be honest, $9 for a tiny plate of tinest cubed watermelon and some spice is a bit much. If you want to feel like a 1%, by all means order that. Entree however is pretty generous portion. My partner ordered the pork chops, which were tasty. She didn't really enjoy that it was swimming in polenta, but all items were in generous portions. I ordered the burger and was satiated. I am a purist and didn't add bacon or anything, but the meat and buns were as I anticipated. For desserts, shared a trio of ice cream and we opted to have ginger, hazelnut, and avocado shishito. The avocado shishito tasted like vegetables and we all regretted this. The other two were incredible though!Service is on point. It felt like a fine dining and worth the price and time to visit at least once.",1,,
7,Nhu H.,"Chicago, IL",189,107,117,5.0,10/7/2018,My friend and I split the nickel burger and fries as well as the Caesar salad with salmon. Both were really good.

Other customers around me were complaining about the heat as well.Server gave us almost no time to look at the menu before asking for our order. Food was nothing special, just looks good. Got the spaghetti primavera and cavatelli gratin. The cavatelli was overcooked and had a weird aftertaste. I forgot it was supposed to have ricotta until I got to my last few bites and was eating chunks of ricotta...",,,
10,Billy C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",436,200,765,3.0,6/4/2018,"Hype in the surrounding Chinatown area. I was looking forward in coming here for awhile and after dining here for brunch on a Sunday, I was sadly disappointed with not only the food but the overall menu. The hostess also needs some attitude adjustment as well, smile! No one wants to see a RBF when you walk into an establishment. Ended up ordering the mushroom item on menu and it came out basically pieces of shredded mushroom stuck together with some cheese and salad. It was edible but not impressed....if I had to say the best part of the meal was probably my fries and even that was lacking. Thin fries with a few crumbles of cheese on it. Boring. My Arnold Palmer I ordered was also watered down and tasted like nothing. Stick with just a glass of water, don't bother. Overall - disappointed and I probably will not be back. Maybe their dinner menu is better? Let me know.",4,2,2
11,Dana Y.,"New York, NY",350,238,726,5.0,6/14/2018,"I love this place! Such a sleek and modern restaurant located near Little Italy. I didn't understand why it was called Diner, but I get it now, it serves diner classics in more modern flavors. It's such a great concept. The décor and seating area are also inspired by your classic diner. It's great for brunch, dinner with friends, or a date. Unlike other brunch places, they don't emphasize alcohol. They don't need to because they offer great coffee! I went with my friend for brunch on a Saturday. We were able to make a reservation, which is always a plus! We both ordered a cold brew with the Kale Cashew Bowl. Want almond milk with that coffee? They will happily bring you a little cup. As for the Kale Cashew Bowl. I love love loveeeeeed it. It's a big bowl of roasted sweet potato, avocado, asparagus, green beans, faro, cashews, served with a poached egg. It tasted amazing. Everything complemented each other so well, that I couldn't put my fork down. It's a very filling meal as well. I understand why people were complaining about the prices, but honestly, I expected it - for a spacious, nice restaurant downtown, these prices are common. The guys next to us ordered this egg burger, nicest presentation ever. I will be trying that next time. The wait staff were great. Very attentive and nice. All smiles. Definitely will be back to try other items.",1,,

Bathrooms were very clean as well. The menu doesnt have many options but it has all the usual suspsects. I went with the most classic breakfast item... The eggs benedict.  It was a meal that was good but did not stand out. It is served with a side salad which gave me a healthy start to the morning. Overall, a 4 star joint.",16,1,6

14,Rebecca W.,"Los Angeles, CA",878,403,913,2.0,4/10/2018,"The food here is INCREDIBLY overpriced. I have never felt so underwhelmed by a restaurant with such great reviews/chic ambience. My friends and I came here on a Saturday night. We had reservations ( we were a large group), but it wasn't a packed place. The food took forever to come. Maybe it's because we had a lot of people, but there wasn't very much going on outside of our table. We ordered fries for the table but they weren't very good. They tasted dry and underseasoned. McDonalds would have had better fries than that.I ordered the Salmon dish, and it was alright. Parts of it were cold, but parts of it were good. It wasn't cooked very evenly. There were well done parts of the filet, and rawer sides of the filet. The dish was small as well.BUT SPEAKING OF SMALL, EVERYONE'S DISH WAS MICROSCOPIC. THE CHESTNUT PAPARDELLE WAS LAUGHABLE. IT WAS LITERALLY LIKE 2 SCOOPS OF PASTA. For $22, that is almost immoral. It wasn't delicious enough to be worth that much. This place is also supposed to be $$, not $$$. We were APPALLED at how small the portions were. All the pasta dishes were small. Everything about the restaurant was small. The waitress's attitude was small too. You could tell that everyone was kind of shocked at how much money they had to dish for the quantity of food they got.Oh, and the REAL kicker in this story? A couple of us had to go out for SECOND DINNER after this. Thanks for the $30+ appetizer, Nickel and Diner. Won't be coming back.",3,1,1

I had the classic egg sandwich and it was really greasy. The bottom bun was soaked in oil and you can see the oil running. Cheese was not running and the egg yolk didn't run out when I cut it. Other than that, it was good and flavorful. FYI, there was pesto paste on the bun.My friend's shaved vegetables was okay. It was what it is with a sweetness from the dressing.We would head to a cream puff store after here, so didn't try their desserts. Service: Main dishes came out like 15 mins after we ordered them. Our waiter was nice and friendly. The only thing is he didn't check on us nor refill our water. Bathrooms (only 2) were spacious, tho lol.",,1,

17,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1269,914,4.0,4/1/2018,"As parts of Chinatown near Canal Street have begun to change over the years, I watched with interest a couple years ago as Nickel & Diner was built and finally opened.  This beautiful venue is a literal corner diner with a beautiful modern look inspired by art deco design of the past.  Complete with a long counter space with bar seating and several booths lined up along the side, this diner looks to merge the old and the new in a convenient downtown location that is a short walk from both the Grand Street and Canal Street stations in Chinatown.In addition to the beautiful main dining section, the back area (beyond the immaculate rest rooms) is a private room that can be rented out for parties.While Nickel & Diner opened a couple years ago, every time I have tried to drop in the place was so packed the wait was estimated at over 45 minutes.  Finally I decided to make a reservation and that made the process 10x smoother.  I highly recommend setting up a reservation before you go to guarantee your seat.Here's a rundown of what my girlfriend and I tried while we were at Nickel & Diner:ROASTED MAITAKE MUSHROOMS(Poached Eggs, heirloom ratatouille, melted provolone, fine herbs garlic butter)Absolutely delicious.  Even without the two perfectly poached eggs the mushrooms, cheese and ratatouille were delicious together.  Add in the poached eggs and you have a very satisfying dish that has layers of flavor.EGG WHITE FRITTATA(Fennel sausage, spinach, wild mushroom, puff pastry, ricotta, parmesan)In contrast to the maitake mushroom dish, this frittata was wonderfully rich.  It's actually a good thing it uses egg whites because the sausage, puff pastry and cheeses really kick this into high gear on the taste buds and I feel like having regular eggs with the yolks may have been *too* rich.  This dish is delicious, but very rich.POTATO HASHThis has consists of small potatoes cooked with sliced sweet peppers and cheese.  It was sweet and savory at the same time.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned as well.BRIOCHE FRENCH TOAST(Fresh berries, caramelized banana, maple whipped cream)This dish was simple yet perfectly done.  The brioche had not been drowned in egg wash.  It had just enough to give it the right consistency and flavor.  The maple whipped cream was nice and tasty but I will be honest, I did not notice any caramelizing on the bananas.  They seem like they had been fresh sliced and tossed onto the dish (which honestly, I have no problem with).  The toast was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful texture.I was very pleased with my first Nickel & Diner experience and I look forward to going back.",2,,
18,Lisa C.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",36,224,353,3.0,4/8/2018,"Nice looking ""diner"" (sleek with a slightly retro feel due to the black & white color scheme) with booth and table seating available. Tables are spread out so there is lots of space to move around and you don't feel like you are brushing elbows with the party next to you. Waitress was attentive. This place is more upscale (re: expensive) than your local diner and it doesn't really have a lot of the traditional diner offerings... New American cuisine is a proper label. Definitely make a reservation if you plan to go.The plating of the food was nice & ""instagrammable"" but honestly was not very memorable for me. Ordered the roasted maitake mushroom. It was okay in terms of taste, but the portion seemed quite small for price paid. My friend said her kale cashew bowl was good and the portion looked decent. Matcha latte was good (not sweet).Overall, it's a ""just-okay"" spot for brunch/lunch if you want to try something different in the area. But the food didn't have any amazing ""wow"" factor to make me want to go back anytime soon.Food: 2 ""meh, I've experienced better"" but combined with the nice ambiance and attentive waitstaff, I give this place an overall score of 3.",1,,

We were seated at the counter which was fine, the decor is really nice and there was a good atmosphere. Two couples were subsequently seated on both sides of us soon after us. It took the server, no joke, 20 minutes to even acknowledge us. I know we're pale Irish people, but we're not invisible! I had to ask a busboy to ask the server to come over to take our order. Meanwhile, the two couples on either side of us had ordered long before us. I ordered a grilled cheese and my boyfriend ordered fish and chips. It took another 30 minutes for it to come out. The server did not apologize for the wait, and when the food did come out he did not check to see if we needed anything. I can think of much better ways of spending $60.00 in NYC...",,,

Not what you would expect from this neighborhood, but still a pleasant surprise. It was another typical cold morning this January when I walked in. Despite the cold outside, I was warmly greeted by the hostess and seated in a decently located booth. They have a nice breakfast & brunch menu and also offer cocktails.I decided to order all the sides. I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, an avocado and the potato hash. The potato hash was prepared with peppers and had a spicy kick to it. Definitely a welcome choice to combat the cold outside. The avocado was fresh and thinly sliced. The eggs were cooked just right, yellow all around but still had a soft texture about them which I really loved. My waitress Melissa was friendly and welcoming. Definitely has my recommendation as a great server. I also ordered 2 rounds of Cappuccino, both of which I slowly sipped in between my breakfast.",7,2,6

24,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,5.0,1/30/2018,"Nickel & Diner is participating in Winter 2018 Restaurant Week, but my friends and I ordered from the regular menu. Keep in mind that if someone orders from the restaurant week menu, everyone has to. The restaurant opens back up at 6 pm for dinner, and we arrived right at 6, so the restaurant was still empty (and remained pretty empty for the hour we were there). We were seated at a large booth that had coat hooks (very convenient for huge winter coats). I ordered the crab fettuccine with shoestring fries as a side. The food took about 10-15 min to come out, but once it did, boy was it worth the wait. The fettuccine had a lot of herbs in the sauce (pretty sure it was dill?) and it was sprinkled with a good amount of crab and asparagus. I was worried it wasn't filling, but it was actually a good sized portion for $22! The fries balanced it out well, and were honestly some of the best seasoned fries I've ever had. 5/5 would def come back for dinner! The decor is also nice (spacious w/ dim lighting).",1,,

We sat at the bar for a quick breakfast, the kitchen served it fast and food was nice. We left the place quickly due an urgent event, while  20% - 30% remained empty. Great food, poor attitude by hostess made the whole experience one star. If you cant walk into a diner to eat comfortably, then no need to go.

The overall aesthetics of the restaurant is clean and neat and perfect for pictures. When our whole party arrived, we were seated in the back area. First things first, some drinks we ordered were a regular latte, two matcha lattes, and one chai latte. I felt that it lacked the rich tea flavor in all the drinks but the regular latte wasn't bad. Nothing spectacular though.For entrees, we got Eggs Benedict ($17), Eggs Florentine ($16), Kale Cashew Bowl ($17), and Grilled BLT ($16). Our side dish was potato hash. My two friends that had gotten the Classic Egg Sandwich ($12) said it was way too salty. The Eggs Florentine which I got was pretty good - the muffin was nice and crispy. The birthday girl got a Kale Cashew Bowl and was happy with her choice. However, at the end of our meal, we had asked our waitress to help us take a group photo but she rushed it and did not seem to care. She did not even ask if everything was alright throughout the course of the brunch. In all, I felt that it was mediocre and was not entirely impressed as I thought I would be based on past reviews I saw. The prices are a bit steep for the quality of the food.",,,1

Me and my boyfriend stopped by for brunch and ordered the eggplant parm sandwich with the cavatelli gratin (just fancy mac and cheese tbh) and side orders of potato hash and french fries. We love our potatoes. Overall the food was pretty good but not something I can't find anywhere else. Overall it was a good experience; the waitress lowkey forgot about us for a long time because of where she seated us but I didn't mind it until she kept checking if we left a tip every 5 mins even though we already paid and had the tip on the table. There's other brunch spots in the area that I've been to which are better but it was super cold that day and we didn't want to walk any further than we already have.,1,,

With all honesty I didn't feel the ""vibe""( hate to say the word but I had to) was very welcoming. Do you ever feel when a server feels too much of a rockstar to serve anybody? That's how it felt.The lunch menu had several items I would try, and probably would have ventured more on it if I felt treated more kindly. The chicken soup is incredible! Light and flavorful perfection. I Would go again just to have this. Hopefully if I go again and ask for a freaking lemon to squeeze on top of my avocado, water or my own eyes I'll get it, instead of having 3 different employees asking  what a lemon was  and never bringing it.

So we put our name for 1:30 and given our number to call when a table was ready.  Waited 20 mins and called back and immediately got seated with water and menus. Here's wat we ordered:We ordered 3 sides for our little one having to be a bit picky:Shoelace fries- lightly topped with parmesan cheese made no difference.  It was to me no special fries and kept my 9 year old eligthed but $6 for just a handful of fries, I expect some special fries.  Not too mention they were cold. 2 scramble eggs- For some reason it looked a bit too yellow to me.  I didn't try these but my little one said she couldn't finish it all as the more she ate them it tasted kinda weird.  Hubby had a tried and said was ok.Side bacon- who doesn't like bacon?  Was crispy like good bacon.  Egg white Frittia- very good.  I thought it might be a bit heavy with cheese but surprisingly light with the perfect amount of taste equally amount of sausage and veggies.  BLT- mmm...  so good. 3 layers of goodness made up one great empire having the salad on the side. The bacon is aromaticly smoky and crispy. The salad I found it overly dressed with olive oil but hubby had no complaint.  Overall, we like our food and service was only medricro.  And a diner having to ask about having a reservation is definitely not our style or very unexpected. $65 for brunch style food I would expect more from both the quality of food and their service.  Granted that I love my egg white frittia and despite the other flaws,  I would go back for their other dishes.",,,

We made it work.. Our server was very nice. And my sister has a small service dog, and the server got us a high chair for the dog... Cute dinner atmosphere.  I got the pasta but did not care for it because it had a strong roasted pepper taste.  I don't care for bell peppers of any kind in anything.  My hubby switched with me and he liked the pasta.  The serving could have been larger and I should have been offered some Parmesan... it needed Parmesan.  My hubby got the burger and fries.  That was outstanding!  Fries were perfect and seasoned perfectly.  Burger was huge and very flavorful!  I could only eat half so my hubby ate the other half.  Several in our group got the egg sandwich and they all raved about how good it was.  My niece got the power bowl and it looked healthy and delicious and she reported that she liked it.  My brother in law got the pancakes and they were just ok.  Nothing remarkable.  No special topping.  The restaurant was not full when we left... but I'm sure it was the time of the day.",,,

35,Diane K.,"New York, NY",217,108,702,4.0,9/27/2017,"Reviewing based on a visit for Saturday brunch.The diner has got a simple, black and white theme going on - I like! You will see their coffee maker - a cafe corner when you walk in. After greetings by the hostess, you will see a lot of 2 x 2 table booths that you normally see in diners. It wasn't crowded when I went with my boyfriend, no wait, around 2pm (pretty late for brunch typically). We were seated all the way in the back (far into the restaurant) for 2 people groups. The lighting is great, big windows to see people walking on the street. I ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich ($12) simply because 1. Brunch = Eggs! 2. A table of 3 ladies ALL ordered the same thing, so that triggered my curiosity (you can say I'm a follower for all I care!).Conclusion: Good choice. It is what it is. 2 eggs with bacons and ham and some pesto on a kaiser roll.My boyfriend got the Marinated Hanger Steak and eggs ($25). Although it was on the expensive side because it's steak, he enjoyed it very much. The steak was cooked well to his liking - medium rare. It was a filling meal. We also ordered a Bloody Mariko ($14). It's a bit expensive for a whiskey glass size. There is a bacon with it but it wasn't anything special. Overall, solid brunch place. Will come back again for the variety in their menu.",1,,

The restaurant is cute, with bright lighting and friendly staff!I ordered the maitake mushroom dish and was impressed. The ratatouille was sweet and tangy, the eggs were poached perfectly, and the mushrooms were well-seasoned and flavorful-rich and earthy. The portion size was a little small, however, and it was pretty pricey at nearly $20. Service was pleasant and my friends both enjoyed their French toast. I'd definitely return but overall, just another standard NYC brunch option.",1,,
37,Kira L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,13,21,5.0,4/13/2018,"Love love loveeeeee this place! Nickel & Diner has been on my list for a long time and I recently found myself in the area and starving. Nickel & Diner is beautiful inside--strongly reminiscent of your classic diner, but more sleek and modern. When my friend and I got the menu, EVERYTHING sounded great. The menu is not overwhelmingly extensive, but is still packed with great options for anyone. After a good 15 minutes of deciding, I settled on the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and my friend ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich. The food took a bit of time but that's probably because it was being prepared to perfection. My sandwich was great: very fresh tasting, lots of flavors, but not too salty, greasy, or heavy like I find many eggplant parms to be. My friend was also visibly very pleased with her choice. She raced about it even after she had finished it. I decided I wanted dessert, and the waitress told me they had vanilla, chocolate, and swirl soft serve. I asked for swirl but when it came it was vanilla and charcoal, as opposed to regular chocolate. It actually tasted quite good, but I wasn't really interested in eating charcoal, so I sent it back and the waitress had no problem replacing it. She was very understanding about it. The vanilla soft serve was great. My friend ordered the hot chocolate assuming there would be the marshmallow in it that we've seen in pictures on here; however, it didn't not come with it and she said the hot chocolate was watery. Neither issue put us off from Nickel & Diner. We both agreed we would definitely be back to try some more of the amazing stuff on the menu.",,,1
38,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,3.0,7/17/2017,"I LOVE a good diner so I've been dying to check this place out since they replaced the sketchy $5 for 3 item Chinese place that had been there for years. I was really encouraged when I walked in and saw the sleek, minimal interior that still had the friendly feel of a diner. I've heard a lot of great things about the breakfast sandwich and I wish I had stuck with that because unfortunately I wasn't happy with my meal for the most part. I was excited to splurge on a burger which came with their shoestring fries. Though I asked for the burger medium rare, it came out medium-well to well done, which just makes me sad - such a waste of good meat. The poppyseed bun was a bit hard, and the fries didn't taste fresh at all. My date got the Benedict with some potato hash on the side, which they forgot, but the server felt really bad about it and took it off our check, so all was forgiven. The hash itself wasn't very tasty either, though. Though it came in a piping hot cast iron dish and was piled high with fixins it was still lacking flavor.We also got excited to share the milkshake of the day, which was mango. Sounds really fun and interesting, right? But what I tasted was just a vanilla shake with some orange wisps on the bottom which I kept trying to stir to get more mango flavor but I honestly don't think they added to it at all. And though I should have known better, I got coffee because diner coffee is one of my favorite things, but like many organic/fancy coffees I found this one much too sour. Totally a personal preference thing, but be warned that you're not going to get your traditional diner coffee here. All of this being said, I really am willing to give Nickel and Diner another shot because there were so many things on the menu that sounded tasty and they could have just been having an off day. The service was friendly, ambiance stylish and cool, and it's a great location if you find yourself in Chinatown/Little Italy and want a non-Chinese or touristy Italian bite.",6,4,4

Very friendly, the waitress said there wasn't any outside drinks allowed, but brought me one of their cups to put my drink in so I could keep it. Overall, the food was very good. Got the veal reuben which was tasty, and tried some of the steakhouse burger which was delicious, cooked just right and a good sized portion. Only con was it was a bit pricey. Lastly, tried the chocolate charcoal ice cream, which as advertised is purely black. A little disappointing as it did not have much chocolate taste, but then again soft serve is always a good end to a meal. Overall a decent place for a bite, I would definitely recommend the steakhouse burger! Would consider coming back",,,

From the outside, this looks like a large place, but upon walking inside, its actually really spacious, but not too much seating. There are a few booths along the windows and towards the back and just opposite that is a long bar.The menu is simple and they serve breakfast/brunch and dinner. We came for brunch and had a great meal. The lox bagel on pumpernickel was amazing. Very flavorful and fluffy. The egg sandwich was delicious as well, but much heavier and messier since it includes a perfectly cooked fried egg. We also got a side of potatoes and they were good, but not the best I've had.

Updated review","A diner with a modern twist has made their way into Chinatown. I love that the location is close to the subway station because it's easy to get to and less of a hassle. If you want to go shopping in SoHo after brunch, it's right there. Convenient, right?When we arrived, we were seated at the booths and I loved the contrasted teal against the minimal black and white interior. The boots were spacious for a party of 4 so it was very comfortable. There were so many little details I loved and I always appreciate the details at restaurants. My table ordered the salmon lox, fries, hash, steakhouse burger, and the egg sandwich. I really enjoyed the salmon lox and fries even though I couldn't finish the fries cause I was so full. The steakhouse burger was really good too. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. I didn't try the egg sandwich but it looked so good, and the person eating it was totally feeling it. I'm also a person that's really into drinks (non alcoholic) so I was wondering if they'd have any smoothies but I was told those are coming soon so I'm excited to come back to try those. The service was great. I didn't experience any problems like my food not being ordered or forgotten. Our server was friendly and made sure we got what we asked for so good enough for me! It's definitely a cute new spot to go to for brunch and I'm certainly coming back again. I'm thinking of coming back for dinner since their dinner menu looks pretty tasty too!",,,
45,Ken L.,"King Township, PA",0,1,0,1.0,9/14/2018,"The food was good but the service was bad. We were at the counter waited forever for our food. Had to keep asking server for water and coffee he never came by to ask how things were. Two other couples had the same issues the manage had to comp their meals because the got their food after us.   They got my wife's order wrong but we were so hungry she ate it anyway.   I had to ask for our Check three times. We left a low tip 10% but I also told the waiter why I tipped him low. This was a failure on all levels the kitchen not putting the food out, the waiter not checking on us and the status of the food the manager not paying attention to the over all operation of the restaurant. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands go elsewhere.",1,,

I'm not a huge drinker either but the drinks were good as well.I opted for the tempura battered boneless fried chicken, the chestnut pappardelle, the braised short rib, and ended this fantastic meal with their desserts.The fried chicken was juicy, the pappardelle cooked just right, and the short rib was fall off the bone, melt in your mouth, pure satisfaction.The service was great as well, and I will definitely be back to try their brunch menu!",2,,
47,Kristen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,270,76,4.0,7/2/2017,"I'm a tad bit obsessed with the decor and vibes here. It's laid out like a really modern or industrial diner (you know the style I'm describing - all neutrals and smooth countertops). There's plenty of seating and the arrangement is nice and spacious so you really do get that diner feel.The service is friendly and for a Sunday at noon, the place was far from packed, though maybe it was because it's July 4th weekend. Nevertheless, this place is definitely on the up-and-up, conveniently a few blocks away from the Canal Street stop, so I'm sure it'll start to fill up as time goes by and its reputation builds.I got the iced chai latte and the classic egg sandwich, which I HAVE to rave about. The two fried eggs were runny and even though the yolk got everywhere, I really can't complain because the flavors were fantastic. Nice, crispy bacon coupled with some savory ham and cheddar and a basil vinaigrette (which added a nice little kick to the sandwich) on top of a poppy seed kaiser roll - what a genius and fantastic combination. I was so full after that sandwich and for $10, it's really not bad at all.My friend got the kale cashew bowl, and YES for warm grain and vegetable bowls. I loved the flavors of the avocado and quinoa and definitely the roasted sweet potato too. It was a huge order to top it all off.I'm a big fan of this place and I can't wait to come back.",1,1,1

Nickel & Diner seems to be a very popular spot for brunch and was packed. Even so, the service was top-notch. We liked the modern updated ""diner"" decor, including the bathroom!  The food was excellent. We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, the kale cashew grain bowl and corn beef hash and all were delicious and well presented (insta worthy, our daughters spent a long time photographing the dishes!). Special thanks to the manager, Felix, for his excellent and most appreciated customer service: one of the dishes we ordered did not come with the others and we had to wait several extra minutes for it.  Felix brought us a small fruit bowl while we were waiting and took the dish off the bill, which I thought was a very nice gesture.

Me and my party of 3 sat at a booth, which was nice and spacious with comfy seating. The 3 stars I'm giving this place doesn't have to do with the ambiance or service but entirely the food. It was so average. Given the price, I expected bigger portions than we received. My Kale Cashew Bowl was not filling at all, and I don't even eat that much to begin with.

Must have some magic mushrooms in it for this price.The manager was very accommodating and mixed up two different teas for us in one pot, but when I asked him for whole wheat penne (from different dish) instead of fettuccine with our crab, we're told chef does not make substitutions (""pre-made"" makes one think?) Got Crab Fettucine and grilled-looking Cod. Fettuccine (by look and by taste) was too watery to stick to the pasta, and taste was a bit sourish-metallic and unnecessarily bitter. Honestly, I'm writing as I just swallowed my first bite and the sensation in my mouth is similar to having just chewed on aluminum foil (don't ask but I HAVE done it). When the waiter insisted that I share my opinion and I told him about the sauce being watery, the response was ""every chef makes it differently, that's why you get the spoon""Ironically, my girlfriend decided not to continue on the Cod, which I guess I chose as lesser of two evils. It was ok in my opinion. I guess we got lucky having chosen two different evils haha. I initially gave them 3 stars and was hoping to be able to add one for the food. The food obviously didn't deserve a star, but I subtracted one for the... punchlineSo here's the punchline: I went to add a 22% tip (just to round off not because I'm so generous) and paused thinking why two dishes and a tea are costing $68, then realized they added 20% service charge even though the menu said ""to parties of 6 or more.""

My husband is Hispanic but appears middle eastern due to his beard. We were given a wait time of 30 minutes. They said they would serve us by the bar for now. The bartender was clearly unhappy with this, wanted us out, so they escorted us back to the front. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I figured it was because my stepson was underaged and should not eat by the bar, we said no problem.However, they then asked if we would like to be served in the waiting area for now, I agreed, assuming they'd seat us properly in a booth when one was free. Again, giving the benefit of the doubt, I thought we were seated there due to the diner being full. However, as more customers showed up, they were seated in booths immediately, no wait time, we watched  as customer after customer got seated. One lady even had an entire booth to herself, while we were kept in the front, at a small table in the waiting area. At this point the message was clear, the staff didn't want someone that looks like my husband at their diner.God bless the waitress who noticed how poorly we were treated and was very apologetic, trying to make our experience better. As we watched the staff talk about us and refuse to seat us at their restaurant, we bit our tongues, smiled, paid for the coffee we had, tipped and left.

We were told that the chef makes no substitutions for anything at all unless it is already on the menu. The options were only ""white"" cheddar cheese or bacon. We noticed the sliders came with grilled onions and the chef agreed to add them ""as they were already somewhere on the menu"".-- Why onions and not greens too?We have never heard of a restaurant in this health conscious age that will not exchange fried potatoes for veggies. If we wanted salad we would have to order a separate house salad and still get the fries?!?! Note lettuce was on the menu elsewhere?!?! Go figure.)We were given the fries which were super dosed with salt, so inedible anyway. The burger was very good but smaller than advertised, still it was enough meat for us.The waitress felt horrible about the fries only rule. Why does management want to create these unpleasant interactions between guests and staff where they have to make apologies for the chef's rules? While we were there folks at other tables were allowed to add options that were not on the menu. Iced tea with just a splash of lemonade...those guests did not have to get an Arnold Palmer, or a lemonade and an ice tea separately.Someone else added chicken on the side of a dish where it was not normally served...but that was OK with the chef.How would exchanging salad or some lettuce for fries or a cup of crudités served just like the fries hurt the ego of the chef?

Opting for the $4 machiatto with the Valentine appropriate heart.  Torn between the BLT on sourdough bread or the Egg/Bacon sammy, we opted to share the latter w/ a side of potato hash.  The sandwich was amazing, on a roll so soft, it was almost flattening with each bite.  There wasn't much ""hashy"" about the potato hash, but they it was an ample serving in a small skillet.  Sharing one breakfast meal was about $30, all in.   Service was quite impeccable.  Time from order to arrival left something to be desired, especially since it wasn't overly crowded.  If that stresses you out, keep that in mind.  Finally, I'll be back for one of those $7 milkshakes that I kept seeing pop out.  Sometime change is good.",4,1,3

The service wasn't great; it was hard to get the server's attention and she rarely came into the room we were in. I got the grilled BLT and my boyfriend got the burger. They were both good. I was hoping to try the charcoal soft serve, but they only had vanilla. The vanilla ended up being really good.",,,

Liquor license pending.Started with the foie gras terrine. Although plated beautiful and tasted fantastic, the foie was served on a hot plate which literally melted the terrine and became soupy.The crispy skin duck was very nice. Cooked medium rare, the meat was tender and succulent inside while the skin was salty and crispy. If available get the slow roasted acorn squash! The show roasting brought out the natural sweetness of the squash. A bite of the squash, sliced almonds, Swiss chard together...party in your mouth. (Seasonal dish)If you're looking for something hearty, the Berkshire pork chop is great. They recommend medium rare but we decided on medium which was a better idea...the center was only slightly pink and still very juicy. The meat has a smoky flavor, very delicious. Doesn't come with sides so you'll need to complete the meal.",1,,

71,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,267,1183,5.0,1/30/2017,"First impression: what is this American diner doing in the middle of Chinatown? I believe the space used to house a popular Chinese restaurant for affordable eats. That being said, it's been completely transformed into a modern-ish ""diner"" (or rather a nice room with diner-style bar stools) with shining white tiles and light flooding through its giant windows. The vibe is perfect for brunch that's casual yet elegant. The menu is perfect for the same.Salmon Lox: one of my favorites, a filling and healthy dish with an awesome combo of spinach, cucumbers, avocado, and lox on an impressively good pumpernickel everything bagel (2 of my favorite bagels in 1!). It's near impossible to eat as a sandwich - eating it open-faced is the way to go. Roasted Maitake Mushrooms: the healthiest dish we ordered, mostly vegetables. The ratatouille has a nice zing, and maitake mushrooms are my favorite. Some grains or bread to soak up the sauce/egg yolk would've been a nice addition. Yummy but not very filling. Eggs Florentine: pretty standard, well executed with a fresh non-goopy hollandaise. Buttermilk Pancakes: larger than your face and really delicious. Bits of macadamia and hints of orange throughout perfectly-fluffy-yet-densely-satisfying pancakes, and a trio of toppings including one very cinnamony apple compote.Potato Hash: interestingly mixed with roasted red peppers and some gooey cheese, a decent carb side (would be perfect with the mushrooms!). I may go for fries next time.Sharing is highly recommended, so you can order a bit of everything for a well-rounded meal. I had my eye on the breakfast sandwich and burger, which seemed popular. Service was fine, and what I really appreciated was the faint jazzy background music and moderately quiet noise level. It's just what you need on a Sunday morning.",3,,2

There's also bar stool seating at the bar. For brunch we ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich, Eggs Benedict, and Potato Hash side. I thought the Classic Egg Sandwich was delicious! The Eggs Benedict was good but definitely not as good as the Classic Egg sandwich. The potato hash was hearty and very filling. It was a good meal for 2 people. For drinks we got the an OJ (pricey!) and Latte. Service there is really quick. Our server came to check up on us several times. One thing I have to say is that I was finishing off my plate and the one of staff came by and just picked up my dish thinking I was done.

Though the lunch options looked intriguing (specifically the burger) we really decided we were in the mood for more brunch fair and ended up just ordering coffee - my boyfriend got a plain coffee and I a cappuccino. Honestly, for the price I was disappointed in my drink. The foam was super thin and not very frothy at all. I also didn't care for the taste of the espresso - it had a very bitter aftertaste, which personally I do not care for. Definitely a personal taste though.

That aside, the decor is SUPER cute. The banquettes are actually really comfortable - although I can't help but feel having these large banquettes doesn't necessarily maximize potential seating space. I had high hopes for the food but as Yelp put it, it was A-OK. I was expecting more interesting flavors than what I got. The burger was overcooked but the fries were pretty good and crispy. Kale cashew bowl is very healthy, partially because the portions are so small. I got the maitake mushroom dish which was highly recommended by the waiter. I did not like the way the mushroom was cooked and the flavors of the dish just did not meld for me. The breakfast sandwich was okay, but small.This is a good choice if you're in the area and don't want to wait for ages for one of those trendy restaurants in Soho.

87,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,232,325,4.0,12/10/2016,"Oddly situated within the bounds of Chinatown, but I loved the feel as I walked in - a sleek, clean, modern day diner that's spacious enough to comfortably fit the long counter running the length of the space and banquettes lining the perimeter.The weekend brunch menu is divided into salads, eggs, and sandwiches, with most options falling within the great price range of $10-15. I went for the classic egg sandwich - hickory smoked bacon, sharp cheddar, fried eggs, ham - per recommendation by my server and added on a side of fries to make it extra healthy. The sandwich turned out to be good but ok - tasty, filling, but not quite to the point where your mind consciously registers ""hey pay attention, this is good stuff"". The kaiser roll was too soft to support the weight of the sandwich, especially when it became soggy from the spread and egg yolk; I wouldn't have noticed the supposedly sharp cheddar if it weren't visibly melted onto the bacon; the bacon tasted like normal bacon to me - didn't hint at much hickory smoked flavor.The thin fries came with a liberal sprinkle of parmesan and herbs on top, but personally speaking, I would've loved if the cheesiness/herbiness were on all the fries, not just the top ones!Can't fight the price point though - I paid $15 for the entire meal and even though it wasn't fully satisfying, I still came out of it feeling like I'd just gotten an awesome deal.So - 3.5 stars on food, but service, vibe, and price push it up to 4.",4,,

89,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",533,293,1896,1.0,12/6/2016,"New diner on the borderline of Little Italy, Soho and Chinatown, right on the corner of Howard and Centre. My friend had told me about this new diner that had recently opened. Perhaps our expectations were high but My friend and I left very disappointed. You walk into the entrance on Centre St., the host will be on your right and in front of you, you will notice a nice coffee station serving up Nobletree coffee from Redhook Brooklyn. Five and dime counters with fixed diner bar stools. Large, bright windows with spacious and comfy booths. The host offered us a nice spacious booth. The server was repressive and did not seem into the job even though it was not that busy. The server took our order then left the table. When the food came, the server asked if we needed anything and we declined. After digging into my meal, the server did not come by to check on us. Not that I needed supervision but I was ready to speak up if he would come and check on the table. The food was sadly disappointing. Less than mediocre. I was honestly not planning to touch the food and see if the server would stop by and check our satisfaction. The other staff members even hawked over my table many times because they have noticed that i was not touching the food anymoreIt is a huge red flag if your customers order only a few items and not even finishing one fourth of each dish. But nope, no questions, concerns or interactions. Distastefully, did not even bother to give desserts a try. Table was just cleared, check was paid and on my way to out to quickly find another place to grab a fast lunch at before work. The burger was super dry and bland. I had asked for the burger to be medium rare and the burger came medium well, was there a miscommunication there? did the server ask for the wrong temperature or the chef not know how to make a burger medium rare? The brussel sprouts and shishito peppers had a weird herbaceous taste. Not sure how I feel about these two items mixed together. The cavatelli could use some salt, actually a lot of salt but unfortunately that did not save it either, just super bland. I was excited for their shoestring fries, nothing about it tasted exciting, not think enough either. Even the coffee was too acidic. There must be some spectacular item on the menu that I would want to try for me to return.",4,,

This place is an upscale, high-end diner so don't come expecting a greasy spoon. All the patrons surrounding us were NY chic. The food is good but overly expensive. The burger topped with cheese and fried onion was cooked perfectly and topped with a delicious aioli. The BLT was too messy in my opinion and fell apart on the plate. However, the taste was great and the salad was tossed in a TRUFFLE dressing.

I've experienced better.This place has been sitting here for a while, but only recently did they start doing dinner, which I went for.Arrived at 8:30 PM and tried to get a booth, but was unsuccessful as they told us we needed to reserve them. As the night went on, the place got pretty crowded, despite it being a Wednesday.My friend ordered the carrots and potato and celery puree, with an appetizer of fried chicken, which was laughably small. I got the fries with the pork chop. The portions here were quite small, and quite the pork chop was cooked just fine, they threw some sort of spice/flavor on the pork chop that was very distinct, and kind of ruined the whole flavor. Fries were fine, but it's not too difficult to mess that up.This is a pretty clean establishment and a welcome addition to the greater Chinatown area, but the thing is this place isn't really a ""Diner"" at all as far as dinner goes (which is kind of misleading). It has the words diner, but the dinner menu suggests that this is more of a typical contemporary American restaurant. Don't expect to get patty melts, milkshakes, or any of that kind of typical 'Diner' food.While overpriced, I do understand that making the rent at this location must be tough. This place is fairly notorious, and though it wasn't a wholly positive experience, I hope they do well. I may come back for breakfast or coffee, but not for dinner, as the prices aren't really worth paying for the food offer.",1,1,

Heard about this spot through one of my co-workers and since I was in the area, thought I'd give it a try. It opens at 10AM and I got there about 10:45. There is street parking available, but beware, it can fill up quick. I was bit skeptical to try out Nickel & Diner since it was a grand opening, but i kept an open mind. We walked into the restaurant and right away we were greeted by the hostess. We asked for a table since it was empty but she informed us that they were reserved. Shucks! She gave us an option to either put in a reservation and wait 30 minutes for a table or we can sit at the bar. I was wayyy too hungry to wait so we chose the bar. Walking to the bar, you feel as if you are in a contemporary modern 60s restaurant. Really nice decor and very very clean. Almost to clean.. lol.. As we sat down, we had water poured for us and menus right in front of us. I glanced around to see what most people ordered and behold: the classic egg sandwich! I quickly made my order with a side of corn hash. I also ordered orange juice but it was going to take a while because it was being squeezed fresh from the oranges. Looking around and there is natural light everywhere! I took a few snaps of the joint! Came out really nice. An ideal place for photographers. 15 minutes went by and my order came out. I couldnt wait to dig in. I cut the sandwich in half and watched as the yolk oozed out of the juicy morsel egg sandwich. First bite and it was love at first bite! In under 5 minutes the classic egg sandwich made its way into my belly. Didn't stand a chance. Up next is was the corn hash. Just as good but nothing compared to the sandwich. You can taste the freshness of the potatoes and habanero sauce. At this point the orange juice just made its way out just My overall experience for Nickel and Diner is simply fantastic!

97,Natasha G.,"Sunnyside, NY",541,225,278,3.0,11/27/2016,"I spotted Nickel & Diner's clean/sexy decor on my way to the MoCA, and after some quick Googling decided to check it out after my museum visit. I was drawn in both by the beautiful interior design and the Chikarashi pedigree -- Chikarashi is my absolute favorite poké spot in NYC. I think Nickel & Diner probably runs a stronger brunch/lunch game than dinner, though my dinner here (during its opening week) was solid. They weren't doing anything revolutionary with their dinner dishes, whereas their brunch menu seems to provide higher quality fare than a lot of places in Manhattan that are just phoning it in. The waitstaff were all attentive, kind, and helpful -- though they weren't able to mitigate the odd timing of the kitchen (we got our dishes all out of order). And like Chikarashi, these dishes are all Instagram-ready. There's a nod to Chinatown in a few of the dishes, which seems fitting, given the location. We liked but didn't loooove the bok choy stir fry, and found the foie gras + diver scallops ($16) rich but not especially complex (both of these meats are sumptuously textured but didn't play well off each other). The roasted mushroom side was disappointingly devoid of salt, though that didn't hide the natural umami flavor of the fungi. The acorn squash was delightfully autumnal but ultimately a bit too sweet, and the shrimp was probably the best-spiced dish but even so, wasn't the most memorable restaurant shrimp we'd had recently. I felt that every dish needed a little more excitement; mostly, they felt like the small plates that every somewhat upscale, trendy restaurant in Manhattan is serving now. In the end, the food just wasn't all that memorable. New American/elevated classics is already done well in NYC, and I can't say that Nickel & Diner really bucks the genre. At least with Chikarashi, they were able to make their mark known in a relatively uncrowded market, but with Nickel & Diner, they have a lot of competition.",2,,1

The fries are delicious and totally sharable.The hot chocolate was really delicious after our meal. The chocolate marshmallows are placed on the side and super delicious. At first, I felt that the hot chocolate did not have enough flavor, but after the marshmallow melted, it was very delectable.

The Brussels sprouts & shisitos needed an aioli or dipping sauce, the dish was a tad dry .

101,Caroline Y.,"Potomac, MD",235,7,6,3.0,1/6/2018,"Clean and simple minimalistic interior --very instagram friendly with the black and white aesthetic. I like the idea of the coffee bar in the front of the restaurant.Had the shoestring fries with Parmesan, brioche French toast, and eggs Benedict. Food was high quality and what you would expect. Knocked off one star for the service being notably bad. Our server was a young woman who didn't even greet us, but abruptly asked us to hand her the water glasses so she could fill them. She visited the table exactly 5 times: to fill our water glasses, take the order, ask us if we were done yet, brought us our check, and brought us the change. She was extremely rude and seemed bothered by us from the getgo. I do have to mention the manager did come by asking how everything was and if we needed anything else which was a nice touch, but the server was a major turn off. I'd come back for the food, but definitely not the service.",1,,

Friendly, engaging, stellar service as well! We will be back...often and soon. Glad my husband had jury duty or we might not have discovered it!!  Decor is fresh and lovely!

It has definitely gotten a bit more crowded, but we were able to walk right in at peak brunch time and get a spot at the bar. The best way to describe it is a ""fancy diner"". I've come here twice, both times for a post-workout breakfast. It's definitely nice having a casual spot with some better-than-casual food.The bacon egg and cheese is a must. The hickory smoked bacon and basil sauce give it a distinct flavor that sets it apart from a typical breakfast sandwich. It's $8, which is a bit on the expensive side, but it's worth it. I have also had the kale and asparagus bowl which I would highly recommend for a healthy and satisfying option. This was around $13. Food is great, atmosphere is perfect for a casual meal, and the price is right. I will certainly be back, and am very glad to have found a casual but tasty spot right in my neighborhood!",2,,1

""Diner"" this might be by day but it has to be one of the nicest ""diners"" I've ever been to! Because it was late evening, the lighting and the overall decor made it feel more like an upscale but casual restaurant. The food and the prices are definitely more than a usual diner but they are well worth it. I had the hangar steak salad. Wow...the salad was excellent, and the steak (medium-rare) was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and just absolutely delicious. My son had the Nickel Burger and he loved it. The bathrooms are clean, spacious and well-maintained, also great decor, and the best surprise is that right by the bathrooms is a private dining room that can seat 10 people, and it is BEAUTIFUL. The food here is definitely deserving of that setting. Yet and still, my son and I felt quite comfortable casually walking in here and eating.

Bad enough that I feel compelled to write a review.  The eggs were rubbery and came in a thick, sheet-like shape. The eggs looked and tasted like they were poured out of a carton and into a mold, like the egg patty you get inside a McMuffin or from the food court at LaGuardia. The sad dollop of ""ranchero"" sauce atop the eggs tasted like a few chunks of tomato drenched in vinegar. And after cutting into the omelet, the eggs sat in a pool of water. The burger was $17, plus $2 for cheese. There are a lot of $19 burgers around the city. Except they are usually served at higher-end restaurants and are usually exceptional. This burger was mediocre, at best. The meat was overcooked and of middling quality. The bun tasted store-bought.",2,,

They also have some nice mocktail options. We shared two of the following : tartare, potato croquette, fried chicken, and shoestring fries all of which I would order again and again. The tartare has wonderfully balanced acidity and offered a nice refreshing bite to contrast some of the heavier items we ordered. The fried chicken had a delicious crunch which offered a great mouth feel and the croquettes were incredibly light but somehow still managed a nice ratio of fried outer portion to soft inner potato. The owner/manager went above and beyond to take care of our table even bringing ice cream over for the birthday celebration. I cannot recommend checking out this place enough.

114,Joanna G.,"Manhattan, NY",50,142,0,4.0,4/17/2017,"This is a really weird restaurant in the middle of Chinatown, which makes me feel somewhat guilty because I feel like I am contributing to the slow gentrification of Chinatown by dining here ... but at the same time, this was a great place to have brunch.Made a reservation a few weeks in advance for brunch (which happened to fall on Easter) to celebrate my birthday. I arrived early and the rest of my party was about 20-30 minutes late to the reservation, but they didn't seem to mind that I was occupying a booth by myself. It's a really cute modern take on a diner - very clean, minimal, and pops of color with the seating.The coffee is pretty sour - not really happy about that. But the kale cashew bowl was pretty awesome - I definitely recommend this as a dish. My friends ordered the eggs benedict and salmon lox and they enjoyed their meals as well. All of the dishes are around $15. Service was okay - they were not the most attentive, but the food came out pretty quickly and we never felt rushed to leave the restaurant, even though towards the end, there seemed to be a wait for a booth. They still don't have any alcohol, so I'm assuming their liquor license hasn't been approved yet, but I'm not sure about their BYOB policies.

Conveniently Nickel & Diner is located in Chinatown and I had to do some grocery shopping :). I got the roasted Maitake mushrooms that comes with two beautifully poached eggs. I love mushroom and I love eggs so I was perfectly satisfied with my dish. Bf got the classic egg sandwich. I tried a bite and it was good, nothing special though. But for $9 that was pretty decent. We also got the potato hash. Can't go wrong with that yum. The ambiance was good and the restaurant was well designed. If I had to say one thing that could be improved, it would be I felt kind of rushed. Literally I would finish the last bite and the server would come and clear my plate in three seconds.

Also to die for are the mushroom side dish.  The Old Folks is an amazing cocktail and I'm not even a fan of bourbon.  Other cocktails I've sampled and were very tasty are the spicy margarita and their version of a Moscow mule.

Updated review","I came back on a Thursday lunch hour because my friend remembered that I said I want to try it for brunch.  Brunch, lunch, I think the menu is the same.Abbreviated review-If you want good service, I do not recommend coming here. The food is okay. Nothing mind blowing. My friend and I shared the egg sandwich and great steakhouse burger. The egg sandwich is something you can make yourself at home without much more effort. Just get a kaiser roll, fry an egg and make some ham and bacon. The burger was fine, not particularly flavorful. My friend said he liked the texture and beefy taste but wasn't a fan of the roll. The feedback below is based on lacking service in both my experiences. We were seated in the back again, same seats. I don't understand the purpose of the translucent glass. Be warned that if you get seated in the back, service may be lacking or extremely slow. It's one thing to not be pushy and let your customers easy at their own pace. It's another to have customers trying to get someone's attention (several times) and no one notices. This includes the bus boy, two maitre d's, and waitress. I didn't know the bus boy was just a bus boy. Even when I got his attention, he proceeded to look around for more dishes before getting the waitress...I asked the waitress how I'd be able to get her attention going forward and she said she'll walk back there to check more often. Didn't really happen considering the repeat of my experience happened shortly with the customers seated next to us after. It may be busy, but it's not a holiday. I think that as a business, you can tell if you need to hire more. After charging $10 for a not so special egg sandwich and $18 ($16+2 for white cheddar cheese), I have higher expectations. This place isn't shoddily decored to warrant the service that I experienced.",,,
123,Nicoline S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",47,2,0,5.0,5/2/2018,"After a friend of mine suggested I check out Nickel and Diner, I finally went with a few friends of mine for an early dinner and I pretty quickly wondered what had taken me so long to finally make it in!VIBE: I was hesitant at first, wondering how a concept of ""diner"" meets fine dining would work out, but I was definitely impressed. The decor of the place is reminiscent of a diner, with the big comfy booths and long bar lined with stools, but the ambiance, service and food is that of a fine dining experience.DRINKS: We started with a round of drinks, a spicy margarita, the ruby soho, and at the suggestion of our waiter, Malic (more on him later), what he called gin and roses. Now, I'm not a gin kinda girl at all, but he convinced me to try it and to my great misfortune, I had to admit to him and the bartender (I think his name was Thaddeus) that I absolutely loved it. Thaddeus even came over and asked if the spicy margarita was spicy enough after we ordered another round (bonus points!)FOOD: I ordered the crab fettuccine (again at the suggestion of our waiter) and it was so unique, delicious and did not disappoint! **eye roll at another admission at a great suggestion lol**My friend, who is a vegetarian, loved the potato tasting, which for an appetizer was a generous size. The sauce was rich and delicious and the crispy things on top made for a great contrast of texture.My other friend got the burger and hardly said a word the entire meal, only making sounds of pleasure at every bite. She's a bit of a burger aficionado and it was safe to assume she was very happy with her choice!SERVICE: Malic was very friendly, hands on, and kept us laughing the whole time, without being too overbearing. He made us feel right at home and was definitely the cherry on top of our overall fantastic experience here!! If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would - can't wait to go back!",,,1
124,Yae-Jee H.,"Queens, NY",234,112,49,4.0,11/12/2017,"Unexpected diner in SoHo. Loved the retro interior. Definitely an instagram worthy spot hahah. My favorite was the shoestring french fries- the shaved parmesan on top was a nice touch. Brioche french toast was pretty good. The caramelized bananas and whipped cream made each bite so much better. Roasted maitake mushrooms were good, but the ratatouille seemed lacking in flavor. Custard soft serve was a waste of money in my opinion- nothing special about it. The charcoal custard have an unpleasant grainy texture and left my lips and mouth grey.",,,

We were really looking forward to trying the lox and everything bagel, but the waiter told us they were out of lox. It's pretty crazy for a place known for their brunch to run out of a main dish. We decided on the breakfast sandwich and cashew kale salad. The salad was outstanding! I definitely recommend it. The sandwich was tasty, but we were disappointed they wouldn't swap out the bun for an everything bagel given that they ran out of the lox. The waiter wasn't very friendly and seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  It's a cool spot but probably won't be back.",2,,

128,Suki W.,"New York, NY",128,167,1166,4.0,4/17/2017,I love coming here for breakfast. I work around the area and I think it's an amazing concept that they have here. What is even more interesting is the sheer fact that they are related to Chikarashi (right around the corner from them basically). I think the concept is great and it's quite smart to open it at that neighborhood. What I dislike is probably the coffee. The coffee could improve in my opinion--however their lattes are great. I also think the food menu isn't bad but I would love a couple of more options. I mostly like their breakfast and I think lunch is alright. I would recommend going more for breakfast!,,,
129,Jung Joo K.,"Great Neck, NY",492,104,263,4.0,1/17/2017,"I love the drastic contrast between the Chinese exterior and the modern, Western diner interior. Nickle & Diner certainly knows how to decorate. However, to be honest, the large booths (though comfortable) seem a little bit of a waste of space. Meaning, it has the potential to seat  six people but more often it seats 3-4 people. If they were smaller they could fit more parties. Anyways, the food--the thing that matters most. My friends ordered the hot chocolate with the chocolate marshmallow. I tried a sip. It was so good! Not too sweet, not too bland. Only con: a little pricey (but what do you expect, it's NYC). We ordered the burger, the BLT, and the eggplant parmesan. Personally, I thought the eggplant parmesan was a little underwhelming. It would've been nice if it had a side that filled up more the dish or something that made it seem more worth it for what we were paying. BLT was pretty good, according to my friend. She particularly loved the truffle dressing on the salad. I ordered the burger, and I think I made the best choice. It was filling and rich with flavor. I loved the poppy seed bun!! We ordered the rosemary fries to share, which was a good portion, enough for 4 or more people. However, while there was a slight noticeable difference, it tasted rather similar to the regular fries that accompanied the burger dish. Everything was so filling. I came here a second time for the breakfast food. GET THE POTATO HASH. It's worth it. We got the eggs florentine and the egg sandwich. Both good, full of flavor and texture. I really loved how they balanced the flavors. Only complaint about the egg sandwich: the egg. It was neither poached nor boiled fully. It was rather confusing, maybe we were just unlucky with overcooked/undercooked egg.So overall, in terms of what to order, my favorites were the potato hash and the burger. There is a separate cafe at the entrance. So if you're only interested in drinks, there's that option.",3,1,1

It's a no for me. Like I said food was finger licking good but it's not worth it when customer service is not there. Asian girl with glasses wasn't even there. Like what's a waitress??? We would have to ask her more than once for something, I swear I asked for water about 3-4 times until I finally got some. It's like she wasn't even there.

The interior is beautiful and new, although a little weird given it's Chinatown adjacent. The service was fine and not as bad as the others here described but I have to agree that it is overpriced. I ordered the mushroom with poached eggs and the mushrooms were flavorless. It was under seasoned but there was no soul, empty. The pancakes were almond ones and they were different enough that my husband liked them, but for the price, there are much better options within a few blocks where there is a line 7 days a week. I think it's a good option to have a business meal, but it's not where I would spend my own money again.",6,2,3
134,DK N.,"New York, NY",12,79,125,4.0,7/15/2017,"Nice diner. Very clean. Minimalist and modern. The food is great but missing diner breakfast staples like egg, bacon, home-fries combo. Here you have to order all of that separate. A side of egg, a side of bacon and a side of hash browns. There are omelette combos, eggs Benedict etc. It looks like while trying to be a cutting edge diner near Chinatown and Little Italy the menu lacks the essentials. We can allow the twist on essentials like here your hash browns come in a little pot with melted cheese and a bit spicy  and taste delicious.

136,Jenn G.,"Atlanta, GA",5,138,103,3.0,2/23/2018,"We came as a walk-in for lunch and was seated within 10-15 minutes. Got the sliders which were great! I also got the chai latte which was great but not as flavorful as I had hoped.. my friend got fries and coffee float (?wasn't entirely sure what the specific name was but featured black coffee with some nonspecific alcohol and topped with whip cream). He wasn't too fond of the drink or the fries, citing the drink too sweet/heavy and the fries too salty. Moreover, toward the end of the meal, he became irate that the waitstaff took their time to pick up his credit card despite the lunch crowd dying down .. overall, would I return? Probably not. It's essentially refined dinner food, which is good but not exceptional. The location is very strange (GASP an American diner in Chinatown?? Who would've guessed!) but that's New York for you where dining is intermingled with PR and building a unique brand ..",1,,
137,Tommaso S.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",18,105,121,3.0,2/28/2017,"Bit of a mixed review for this place. First off, the space itself is beautiful - crisp, clean, bright a perfect balance between a hat tip to the old school and modernity. Nice laid back vibe, and the people working there all seemed friendly and helpful. The only abject negative is their availability of high chairs - we were four adults plus a toddler and needed a high chair. They seemed to only have one high chair for the entire diner, and this was being used so there was a long wait, loitering in the entrance waiting for the high chair to become available. There may also have been some murmurings of the high chair only being an option at the tables in the back in order to avoid fire hazards; i think there are probably some staggeringly simple solutions to that particular problem but the place is still in its infancy so maybe they'll figure it out...or maybe it's an intentional policy to prevent the place from turning into a crèche. Hard to say.The food - we had the egg sandwich, ranchero omelette, scrambled eggs and potato hash.  It was perfectly ok but a little underwhelming. It just seems like standard diner fare but smaller portions. One exception - the scrambled eggs were superb! Some of the best scrambled eggs i've had since the Caravan back in London. Also to be fair some of the dinner options (like the sliders) look very good.It's a great space for a coffee and i'd go back again for the eggs and to try the dinner options.",1,,

I tried the hot chocolate with the chocolate marshmallow which was really good and not overly sweet (was a tad pricey though). I ordered the blt which was smothered in cheese and delicious; the salad is tossed in a truffle dressing which was also very good.

It took me awhile to get my waitress' attention since she was chatting with a colleague.As for the food, my daughter didn't care for her pancake, my friends's Kale Cashew Bowl was bland, and her son's burger was left half-eaten. My daughter, ever the devourer of burgers, ate the other half and found it blah.  The food and service were not worth what we paid. Definitely not going back.",,3,

The restaurant also includes a stand alone coffee shop open all day. The menu/hours recently extended to include breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner service.My dinner experience was really fantastic. All around great service and a great experience that's clearly been thoughtfully designed by the owner and chef. The food was outstanding and the environment was unexpected casual perfection. Seems like a good spot for a friend gathering or date night...big booths with lots of space and very cool counter seating that is a smart update to diner dining. I ate a lot () and still have no regrets. Highly suggest trying some of the vegetable sides and apps that may not pop off the printed menu because...reasons. Some of the highlights:- slow roasted squash is a must- spicy shrimp a la plancha- tuna escabeche (wow...just wow!)- foie gras terrine is the best I've ever had- roasted mushrooms - lobster tortellini- beet salad- cavatelli gratin- fried chicken app Looking forward to a return visit to try the brunch menu and spending more time in the chill coffee shop.

It's still within a short walk of my current apartment, but had they opened a little sooner, they'd have been seeing me darn near every day. Some may call it a sign of gentrification in a predominately Chinese neighborhood, but I say they filled a much needed gaping hole in the market. They're fully open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (after a hard stop at lunch), but so far I've only had a chance to try a fantastic breakfast sandwich. Hickory smoked bacon and country ham, two fried eggs, sharp cheddar, and basil vinaigrette on a kaiser roll, it was a step up from the classic deli BEC, but with many more bells and whistles. And at $8, it's a lot less that some of the other elevated breakfast sandwiches going around the city. In a slick setting with good music and beautiful people, it seems like it's only a matter of time until this place is a mainstay.",24,9,13

We were prepared for a half hour to an hour wait on Sunday afternoon. However, the waiter said it'd only take like 25 mins which was good. The waiter (kinda gave me the typical"" I AM SO FASHION and I ONLY shop at SOHO"" kind of feeling....) -,-   asked if we wanted to sit at the corner bar area but couldn't switch to the table if it opened up. So we ended up ordering coffee at the front sitting area. While we were sipping our coffee and juice, another waiter came up and asked if we'd like to sit at the bar, and we could switch to the table area if available. I think that they need more internal communications.. otherwise we would deftly sit at the bar first. This kinda confused us. We finally got seated, but in the inner area where the tables were black with chairs and the space wasn't as opening and modern...which was kind of disappointing for meFood-We ordered a kale cashew salad, a classic egg sandwich, roasted maitake mushrooms, and a parmesan fries.1. The Kale cashew salad was warm and flavorful! The soft boil egg was cooked perfectly with the egg yolk running through the entire bowl, bringing all the ingredients together!! I hope there was a lil more cashew to add more crunchiness!2. To me, the Classic egg sandwich was more like standard. Pretty filling3. I love the the roasted maitake mushrooms! I liked the use of melted provolone, which didn't take over the mushrooms flavor at all! Also, my favorite was actually the heirloom rotatouille! which added the acidity and sweetness to the dish. YUM!4. The parmesan fries was crispy and delicious! The delicious food bumped up the score for the service part so it came up to 3.5.",,,

My sister had made a reservation for the both of us at 11:30 am on a Sunday. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:25 and was asked to wait. Fine, we were a few minutes early. No big deal. However, by the time 11:30 hit, we still had not been seated and other parties who had arrived as walk-ins had been seated before us. We tried not to let that bother us as we were brought to a nice big booth for the two of us. Seemed a little like a waste to seat the two of us at a booth big enough for six, but we weren't going to complain.Our waitress soon arrived after to introduce herself and poured us each a glass of tap and asked us for drink orders. However, it was only later when the table behind us sat down that I heard them being asked if they would like still, sparkling, or tap water. I'm not sure how I feel about not having been even given an option, but that's fine. Not a big deal.We soon put in our orders for Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, Classic Egg Sandwich, and a side of Potato Hash and proceeded to entertain ourselves with our phones and with conversation. However, fifteen minutes soon turned into thirty, at which point I believe our waitress stopped by to tell us that the food would be out shortly. Thirty minutes turned into forty-five minutes, and at that point, we were pretty concerned about how long we'd waited. We were really tempted to just walk out at that point (doubt we would have done it but the thought certainly crossed my mind), so it was good that our food showed up right then.By this time, we pretty much shoved our faces with the food because we were so hungry. I can't say that I would say the food was exceptional in any sort of way. It was good, but certainly not something that I would wait forty-five minutes for, especially since we consumed all three dishes in fifteen. Likely will not be coming back since I feel like there are plenty of other better options in the city to try out.",3,1,1
159,Timothy H.,"New York, NY",3,78,102,4.0,1/17/2017,"For now this place is BYO, and paired with the excellent food, this is a recent favorite spot of mine.The only thing this place has to do with a diner is the modern, fresh interior which looks like the diner of the future. It really looks sharp. The food is nothing like diner-fare fortunately. I have ordered the pork chops and half chicken and both were superb. Well cooked, oozing with rich flavor and the fries, you must order the fries, there are a lot of them and they are sublime. My gf has ordered the beet salad twice now and greatly enjoyed it both times. A couple weeks ago, I organized a dinner of 7 people, planning to take advantage of the BYO policy while it was still in effect. Most restaurants would see seven 20 year olds with 4 bottles of wine and show a level of disapproval, but the staff here were very accomodating and did not make us feel like the hooligans we were for stretching the meaning of BYO. Our waiter the first time was perfectly polite and well-trained. The second was nice and chatted us up a bit but I could tell that he was new to the job and attempting, in a slightly infuriating fashion, to persuade us to order appetizers to share (as recent college graduates, we were not looking to break the bank). He went thru the menu, item by item, mentioning which were his favorites and it took him a few minutes. Hopefully he has excised this from his routine by now. High-quality food in a comfy setting with friendly and mostly adept waiters.",,1,

The booths have a cozy vibe, and the bar has a sleek and clean look. My friend and I picked the booth because it was more intimate compared to sitting on the stool by the bar. There are hooks on the side of the booth, so it was a perfect location to hang our hoodies and bags. I ordered the Nickle Burger and we shared the Bacon Carbonara pasta. The spicy mayo in the burger has just the right amount of spiciness (at least for me!) and the arugula was a very nice substitution from greens that are commonly used in most burgers - lettuce. The burger was very fitting for the temperature steadily dropping into colder months. The bucatini was al dente, and the garlic complimented the Parmigiana-Reggiano, and vice versa. The pricing when compared to the portion as well as the quality of food, service, and ambience Nickle & Diner give, is very fair.",,,

Everything was delicious - my favorites being the grilled lobster and new croquettes.  Staff was attentive and friendly as well.  It's not super packed right now because they just opened a month ago but that won't be till very long. Oh also try the coffee! It's Nobletree coffee and in my opinion better than la Colombe - I've started buying my coffee to go at the counter here in the mornings.,2,,
162,Ben L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/7/2018,"Located in the heart of Chinatown. Unfriendly to local chinese traditional looking customers who were looking to be seated at 11am. 4 indoor booth seats available. 3 side tables against the wall available. 3 small outdoor table available. Hostess ushered out local patrons for not having a reservation and offered bar stools as an alternative to elderly patrons that were clearly physically handicapped. The front of the restaurant, not trained properly in customer service. Excellent training in having an poor attitude versus educating/understanding of local patrons of Chinatown. Clearly, this place from the treatment of hostess is trying to cater to affluent community while emulating and exhibiting discrimination. As a local to the area, I want to support an establishment that may look out of place in a predominantly Chinese community. But was turned away as though we were not in the right socioeconomic status to be served here. This is a weekend call ahead place. Dont even dare coming in when they first open for the day, in an attempt to be seated or offered a wait time.

You can literally get one with almond or even HEMP but nooooo, not soy.  Listen, soy is the original annoying milk substitute and I'm plain Jane when it comes to being pretentious, thank you very much.  Had to further invest in the ""danish of the day"" because I wasn't close to full but it turned out to be a week old burnt turd with a mere suggestion of raspberry which was actually just a paper thin coating only for show.  In summary, this place looks like it should be good (and should be faster considering there are more staff members than customers) but don't be fooled by the upbeat dance music and the slick marbled decor, they're skimming your greenbacks faster than dolt 45.",3,4,2

Guess I will go back another time to try its lunch menu or other dishes, and hopefully it will serve some other drinks  beside coffee and juice  by the time, also with better preparation of food that they ran out of food and juice I wanted to order originally, but it could be understandable due to soft opening.",2,,

It was a quick walk from his apartment, where we'd met up since I'd never seen his new apartment! This place was brand new, with only just over 100 reviews and I was excited to give the new neighborhood spot a try. The wait wasn't too long, but my friend had hoped to get a booth seat - they were large and we were only 2 people so I can see why they placed us at the bar. We were seated after a 15 minute wait (we went to the post office down the block so he could mail a letter, and came back and waited some more). Service was slow, but the wait staff seemed really busy and stressed. We ordered, him an eggs benny with the hot chocolate special of the day and myself a brunch BLT with side salad. I really liked my open face sandwich! The cheese was super melty and dripping down the sides, and their choice of green steak tomato was quite interesting. The dish itself wasn't too aesthetically pleasing but the flavors were all there - BLTs are probably my favorite sandwich of all time, and this was not a disappointment. My friend's hot chocolate was actually REALLY good, the huge chocolate marshmallow block floating in his drink was, as we found out, handmade and set in stores, and made specifically for that drink. I'd go back for that hot chocolate, it was so good!! Friend liked his eggs benedict, didn't say if it was particularly good or bad (he's in the nation of food eaters who call food ""good"" or ""bad,"" no descriptors). Check was brought out kind of slowly, but I really liked how the restaurant was designed and the minimalism of the plateware and the store as a whole.

All was flavorful, although my colleague was a bit disappointed with two small sliders on his plate. The quantity could have been a little more substantial for the price... or the price adjusted to the quantity. Service: Okay. Our server was nice, but we had to try and get his attention several times. Once the food was served, no one came to check on if everything was okay ( I guess I am used to this question at other restaurants). We had to get their attention to get the check.

Breakfast and brunch is what they excel at here. The classic egg sandwich ($9) is a fancier take on the bacon, egg and cheese on a roll. The roll is a deliciously fluffy poppy seed Kaiser roll, the bacon is delightfully crispy and gets some reinforcement from slices of country ham, and in addition to a couple of really well-fried eggs (runny yolk, crispy edges) and melted cheese, there is an amazing basil vinaigrette that elevates the dish. The sandwich by itself is great but I think adding half an avocado makes it extra special. The bf got a shaved vegetable salad ($13) which is a great choice for vegans/vegetarians. Everything in this salad is crispy and well seasoned (helped especially by a delicious sunflower pesto). The portion size for the salad is huge so even though you're just eating vegetables, you will still get quite full.",1,1,1

It took them 10 minutes to bring water another 5-10 to take our order and the waiter was incredibly rude when I asked a question about what was in one of the menu items, as if I was speaking in another language.Would be willing to give it another shot but super disappointing.",1,1,1

184,Attina Z.,"Manhattan, NY",16,19,13,5.0,2/15/2017,"If I had to grade Nickel & Diner for the aesthetic appeal alone, that would already be a 5-star rating. The black and white decor may seem incredibly minimalist, but don't worry, the booths are comfortable enough. You get to relax on a cushy seat while you're regaled with amazing food and drinks; their hot chocolate is amazing: none of that powdery artificial mess you'll find in most stores. Good service, great interior and amazing food. What's not to like?",3,,2
185,Holly C.,"New York, NY",511,285,85,5.0,10/14/2017,"The food is AMAZING! I have only tried their dinner menu but was extremely impressed with the flavors and how well everything was done. The environment is an upscale modern diner design with neat touches that was warm and inviting. I've been meaning to try this place for so long because I LOVE Chikarashi and eat there more often than I'd like to admit sometimes. The chef truly cares about his food quality and flavor, which is very important to me. My friends and I met up for dinner and this is what we tried:-Wild Mushroom and Lobster Risotto: perfect texture and great lobster and mushroom flavor-Grilled Spanish Octopus: so tender and chewy in a good way (not tough at all), it felt like they massaged the octopus for hours -Roasted Chicken: very flavorful, but could've been a little more moist-Crispy Duck Duo: they weren't kidding about the crispiness, I don't always love duck, but this was really really good.-Black Truffle Burger: uh, this had real black truffle shavings on it...YES, IT DID. I was shocked because so many places use truffle oil like they their lives depended on it or some sort of imitation stuff. The fries were also crunchy and seasoned well.-Charcoal & Vanilla Softserve: You don't taste much of the charcoal flavor, but I had the impression it could cleanse my body of all the food I ate (hopefully), but beware that it will tint your lips a little black! This is probably not a good first date dessert idea haha.Overall, I am a huge fan and will definitely be back! I'll have to try the brunch menu some time as well!",,,1
186,Jepha R.,"Middle Village, NY",3,35,29,4.0,6/5/2017,"firstly- just wanna throw in that this spot is in the heart of china town and it's so weird that it says little italy. now that that's been addressed to the good stuff!! got the egg sandwich, sliders (not pictured) and the potato hash. all sooooo so so good especially the sliders. the beef was buttery and juicy in all the best ways!***ordered a cortado at the beginning of the meal and they had to ""check if it could be made"". they later came back and said it couldn't be made. another person at our table got a latte & it was fine. just confused as to why a cortado couldn't be made when it's a basically a latte with less milk (in its simplest form). that's why they're getting 4 stars ‍wait staff was also strangely scattered but the ambience was super nice.",,,
187,Ryan H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/21/2018,"I was meeting 2 friends at Nickel & Diner this evening. We did not eat there due to a bizarre interaction. While waiting I had to use the bathroom, a much older ""gentleman"" chased me into the bathroom and told me that the bathroom was for patrons only. I told him I was waiting for my friends and had to use the bathroom. He was clearly under the influence....he told me to leave immediately, eyes wide, red and a bit shaky. I was blown away and startled by him. I left and called my friends telling them not to come and to meet me anywhere else. I am a New Yorker and live on the block. I am still in shock and will never go there again. Now I know why this space is typically empty and encourage you to stay away.",2,1,
188,Genevieve H.,"Manhattan, NY",55,47,0,4.0,5/26/2018,Decor is super cute with big banquettes for larger groups.  Some smaller tables in the back room where you can sit and people watch out the windows. Came in for brunch and thought the food was good - BLT which was more of a croque monsieur remix and pancakes which were delicious. Also got a latte that was tasty. Obviously it's pricey...this is NYC. Waitstaff was extremely attentive until it was time to pay and then had to go out of our way to flag someone down. Would come back.,,,
189,Charlotte K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,25,58,5.0,7/5/2017,"This is probably my #1 favorite restaurant in the city. The interior is sleek, without trying too hard. The dishes are not conceptually over-the-top, but they make the tastebuds explode with their unique and memorable flavor profiles. My go-to dish here is the Shaved Vegetable salad with chicken - it's the perfect combination of crunchy (fried shallots), sweet (dried fruit), and savory (chicken and vegetables). The service is also impeccable - the waiters, waitresses and hostesses are all so sweet! The location is also ideal, as it's at the intersection of Little Italy, Chinatown, and SoHo. Although this is such a gem, there surprisingly is rarely much of a wait, so definitely make sure to check this spot out - you won't regret it!",,,
190,Thien T.,"East Bronx, NY",82,21,0,5.0,8/19/2017,"Visited here a couple of times for brunch and late lunch and I was never disappointed! The decor of this restaurant/diner is very unique and eye-catching when you're sitting and waiting for the food to come. The Grilled Steakhouse Burger being served here is one of my absolute favorite burgers in the city for good reason. The juiciness of the patty and flavors from the variety of ingredients makes it stand out from the competition for sure. As for the service, it is always consistently good and the menu is fairly priced for the quality that is being served. I would recommend giving this establishment a try if you're around Chinatown looking for some recognizable cuisine.",2,,
191,Daniel A.,"New York, NY",69,34,3,5.0,8/2/2017,"Great service. Quick and easy. Solid menu selection. Tried some staples like the egg sandwich and the chicken soup. They were Fantastic! The egg sandwich was a protein dream, cooked perfect and the pesto was a great touch. The chicken soup had mind blowing ricotta dumplings, there's no oil slick on the surface and it wasn't a bowl of salt water.",3,,
192,Ivan C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,12,6,1.0,3/3/2018,"This place is so over priced. Average Salad dish for brunch is $16. If you want to add an bacon or egg, easily go over $21 a salad dish. $6 for OJ. Jesus Christ.",1,1,
193,Jessica L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,4,0,5.0,3/1/2017,"In terms of neighborhood gems, this place is tops. Located in one of my favorite neighborhoods of the city, Chinatown. The aesthetic vibe of this place bridges the crossover from Soho to Chinatown. The booths are comfortable and inviting. The staff are friendly and at any given time the diner is full of an eclectic group of fashionistas. Now, let's get to the food. As a vegetarian the options are fantastic, but they're known for their sliders and fried chicken, so not to fret carnivores!Top faves:Vegetable Tempura is a must. Perfectly seasoned and crisp.Shoestring Fries Slow Roasted Squash Roasted MushroomsPotato & Celery Root PuréeHousemade Artichoke RavioliOne more thing to add, the tabletops create the perfect background for your instagrammable meal.

197,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,3.0,3/7/2017,"A cold, rainy night. Nickel & Diner is completely empty. My friend and I show up for dinner, telling the hostess we're waiting for 2 friends to meet us. She tells us she can't seat us until we're all present. We're forced to sit in the ""coffee shop"" while we wait. After 15-20 minutes of that nonsense, time we could have spent eating appetizers and relaxing at a table, we realized Nickel & Diner was BYOB. Thanks, hostess, for telling us that. So we ran out into the rain to get some wine. By the time we returned, our friends had arrived and we were deemed eligible to sit at a real table.The food was good, don't get me wrong. Expensive to be sure, but what do you expect at a trendy new eatery downtown? But honestly, what could've been and should've been a 4-5 star review is 3, bordering on 2, because of the ridiculousness of being forced to sit in the coffee shop while the actual restaurant was totally empty. I understand having rules, but come on.",1,,

Sat at a stark white counter, my food was dropped off by a bus boy at a trot. I guess I'm too old to be treated politely by anyone there. The hipster lumberjack vibe is cute and all - but it won't kill you to be polite. I had to call someone over for ketchup (for burger and fries!) and again for pepper. Apparently the lone diners cannot be afforded condiments. I assume the staff is friendly - you know from their lovely discussions amongst themselves, too bad their contempt for the diners was palpable. PS I was dressed fine and I tip so I don't get it. And $4.00 for a 12 oz can of coke. You just remodeled, spring for a fountain soda machine.",1,,

My bf and I were wandering around chinatown and came upon this newly opened restaurant. Booth waiting was 20 mins so we opted to sit at the bar. We ordered the Mac n cheese (not called Mac n cheese on the menu but something with gratin); the steak burger and the chicken soup. Service took awhile and we waited 20 minutes for the food hence -1 star. Everything tasted delicious and I especially loved the rosemary fries that came with the burger. Although a bit pricey, you certainly get the quality that you pay for.  Not to mention the service was impeccable, waiters were attentive and constantly cleaning the counter and refilling waters.",4,2,3
