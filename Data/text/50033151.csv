0,Brittany J.,"New York, NY",31,211,11,5.0,11/13/2014,"I have a pretty great work cafeteria but one day ventured out to Gourmet 53. I'm now obsessed. There are so many great things about this place. 1) variety: daily rotating hot entrees (chicken parm, fried chicken, baked tilapia), salads (at least six choices-Greek, Cajun, chicken Caesar, southwest, Portobello, gorgonzola and fruit, avocado chicken...), a grill in the back for wraps, sandwiches, etc. 2) the daily free lunch giveaway. the ""take a number"" machine isn't for queuing, it's for giving away free lunches! They give away several a day, so if your number is one of the lucky numbers posted, it's on the house. this has happened to me! :)3) the prices. A ""Small"" salad is plenty and comes with a cookie of my choice (love all of the cookies: chocolate chip, macadamia nut, oatmeal and raisin, I think there's a fourth I'm forgetting), and warm! fresh out of the oven! pita chips or rolls/bread. all of this for $6.50! The entrée meals (meat, two sides) are in the $9 range.4) yummy: I have really enjoyed everything I've had. it wouldn't win any Michelin stars, but it's a tasty lunch. 5) super efficient and quick: the line is never too long and it moves very quickly. I'm in and out in maybe 3 minutes every time. I didn't expect to find such a great lunch spot hidden in the basement (I mean...concourse) of 875 Third, but it's a happy surprise. Tip: you can enter the concourse directly from the 53rd and 3rd subway station.",2,,1
1,Ediz I.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",20,1,5,1.0,10/23/2018,"It used to be one of my favorite lunch spots. I have been visiting this place at least 3 times a week for 2 years.. Delicious food and big portions and reasonable prices.. After they changed employees and reduced the portions, I don't feel the same. When I want to have some meat my plate turns into a salad plate. When I tried to talk to the manager about the issue, she gave me an attitude by showing me the meat in the container. I normally do not use Yelp for reviewing but they urged me to write my first. Hope they change their way of communicating with their customers.",1,,
2,Shirley T.,"Brooklyn, NY",181,336,1407,3.0,12/1/2015,"Friendly and fast service but very underwhelmed with my meal. I got the soup and salad combo for $9.20 which includes a free can of soda. Greek salad: tons of veggies but almost no greens. They left all the seeds from the peppers in and I found more trunks of romaine than actual romaine. Good portion for a combo though. Vegetable orzo soup: tasty, spicy and generous portion also. Tasted like minestrone soup.The food set up looks unsanitary despite the A rating. I don't know what the hype is about, this was a real meh experience.",5,4,4
3,John I.,"North Bergen, NJ",62,113,8,4.0,4/5/2017,"Its not gormet as the name suggests but fantastic value place.. you can get entree from the salad bar + side + premium salad (with chicken) + dessert + chips or bread + drink for $9.00  that is unbeatable in this area.  Or just a massive salad and you can mix them up.  I really like thier salad selections (like 10 different kinds) and they always have a good meat to choose from (chicken, peril, steak, etc) plus they make every kind of sandwich, burgers, cheestesteaks, etc.  Great selection.",,,
4,Molly N.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",12,84,81,5.0,8/22/2017,"One of the best lunch deals in midtown east. You can get a ""small"" (enormous, filled with toppings and very filling) salad PLUS choose multiple of the following: pita chips, bread, cookie, brownie, blonde, fruit salad, jello- all appear to be homemade and fresh (chips, bread and cookies always warm) ALL for $6.80 after tax. Customer service is wonderful- the people at the counter truly care about the customers and enjoy what they do. The salads are pre-mixed (most without dressing), and the dressings taste/might be homemade. My favorite so far is the southwest chicken salad- comes with kale, romaine, watercress, grilled veggies (peppers, eggplant, zucchini, onion), cherry tomatoes, grilled corn and black beans, maybe cilantro, and grilled chicken- you can taste the marinade in the chicken and the char of the grill. Only requires a tiny bit of dressing- I like the balsamic. Love this place.",,,1
5,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,3.0,11/9/2015,"Honestly I'm not a big fan of cheese, so after I opened up my salad bowl and discovered that about 1/3 of the food were cheese, I was actually pretty disappointed! That means the veggie/eggs amount must have been decreased proportionally.  The sauce was also way to greasy and you could literally see oil floating on top of the real sauce - no matter how hard I tried to pull them apart. Overall not recommend to come here.",2,1,1

9,Mike S.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",359,572,149,5.0,4/5/2016,"LONG awaited review of a place I frequent at LEAST twice a week for work lunch. There just isn't a better variety of salads for such a LOW price in Midtown! I get the small which is STILL huge. Mix it up! Get two types in one bowl. My favorites are Southwest, Terryiaki slaw, greek, avocado, and of course classic Caesar. The sandwiches and daily meals are also good, but for me if I'm gonna eat here it's all about the salad. And please understand, I am MR. ANTI SALAD. I hate em, I cry when I have to eat one. BUT Gourmet 53 makes them bearable and of course tasty. And for this alone you deserve all the praise I can give.",2,3,1

11,Karina F.,"Manhattan, NY",292,164,98,4.0,11/5/2014,"Thank-you, Yelp! This will definitely be one of my new go to salad places. I went around 2pm. 875 Lex. Go down the escalators and voila.

12,Rohan K.,"Issaquah, WA",380,527,121,4.0,3/26/2015,"Surprisingly good food considering it's literally in a food court. My wife and I were easily able to split a Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti and marinara and a greek salad. It also comes with a warm fresh dinner roll, a cookie and a drink.For under $10, that's incredible value for money.The chicken was moist and perfectly cooked, well seasoned and went really well with the spaghetti and the bread. The salad was fresh and vibrant.I really great place to stop for a quick lunch. Be warned though that the portions are massive so consider sharing.",,,
13,Richard L.,"New York, NY",223,119,139,5.0,8/13/2014,"Found this hidden gem based on Yelp reviews. This is as good as it gets. Came here on a Tuesday and got the Cowgirl Chicken special (3 pieces with rice or pasta and salad of your choosing). Long line, but it goes quick. Also you get a free cookie or jello, a can of soda or bottled water, and bread or chips. I usually eat everything but I only could finish half the chips and soda. You win this time, Gourmet 53. But I'll definitely be coming back for a rematch.There's also a bubble tea next door that's not bad if you're into that kind of stuff.",2,1,
14,Rachel J.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,5,4.0,2/7/2017,Love to stop in for lunch...they're chicken advocado salad is great and they make the best balsamic salad dressing I've ever had. They've achieved the right balance of oil and vinegar and salt it's a little thick jelly like and just perfect!...if you're trying to stay on the healthy path this is the place to frequent..Best thing is the salads are all already made so you can drop in and grab one quickly and go!,,,
15,Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",496,1574,1473,4.0,8/1/2013,"Great lunch spot. Don't feel like paying $10 for a salad? Come here. You get a salad, and free pita chips, a cookie (oatmeal raisin was good) for about $8.50I think they forgot to give me the free fruit cup. I had the shrimp salad, which was delicious. Dressing comes on the side.HOW TO FIND THE PLACEI came here looking confused. You have to go inside an office building and take the escalators to go downstairs. There, you will find a bunch of take out places with seating. There was even a guy playing jazz piano. Can't wait to come back and try the other salads!",4,,
16,Holly C.,"New York, NY",409,1256,5,3.0,5/17/2016,"I've heard my coworkers talk about the salads here. I agree with what they say - they give you a lot for the price! A large is $7.50. The only downfall is that these are all pre-made. The one I bought had lettuce, avocado, shredded cheese (more than I would have liked), and chicken. Not a bad lunch option if you want to get something quick, relatively healthy and at a good price.",1,,
17,Mick J.,"Boston, MA",2,72,0,2.0,4/26/2016,"Based upon the reviews I gave this spot a chance and was disappointed. Had the sandwich, soup, salad special. The good was the turkey sandwich (only two choices for the sandwich). Mediocre was the teriyaki chicken cole slaw.  Overdressed, more roots than leaves of cabbage and dry chicken. The bad was the chicken noodle soup. Campbell's makes it much better. Given the variety I would give it one more shot.",1,1,
18,Catfish H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,229,107,4.0,10/11/2016,"Little did you know a delicious homestyle meal was available right below you.  Every weekday $10 even gets you an entree (think sliced skirt steak, grilled chicken or meatloaf) side (the mashed here is awesome), some salad, some homemade chips, a cookie and a can of soda.  Also for $10 you can get a small soup, half sandwich and small salad - just enough food when you don't know what you want.  Folks that work here are all chill too.  Check it out.",,,

25,Matt L.,"Mountain View, CA",4,108,12,4.0,6/9/2014,"Big salad! Seinfeld fans rejoice! Not only is your salad pretty big (definitely filling), but they scoop it out of huge bins right in front of you, so you know exactly what you're getting. I also like how they have a free add-on of a cookie, fruit cup or jello. Yes, jello. Not that sugar free, watery stuff, but real (red) jello. Service is kinda like at a bagel shop. You line up, and eventually a staff person behind the counter asks what you want.",1,,
26,Jennifer G.,"New York, NY",160,26,0,3.0,6/29/2015,"Came here today for a salad after reading the yelp reviews .. it was alright, not the ""greatest salad ever"".   The Caesar was slathered in dressing which was a bit too much for my liking.   Chips were good, they were out of cookies.   Maybe I'll go back .. maybe I won't.   Other salads in the area are more expensive but the dressing situation is a dealbreaker.",1,1,
27,Erin S.,"Manhattan, NY",62,108,5,5.0,9/11/2014,"obsessed w their Greek salads. A ""small"" is pretty darn big (deceivingly so) and costs only $6.80 including tax and comes with free pita chips and if you want it, a cookie, fruit etc. definitely the best value you can get for lunch in midtown. careful with those pita chips tho- addicting!",,,
28,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",453,537,935,4.0,7/15/2009,"Hidden in a lower-level food court on 53rd and 3rd, this little gem of a lunch spot shines brighter than a cubic zirconia. The long lines are intimidating, but they go fast. A gentleman stands outside the entrance to offer us samples of jumbo fried shrimp while we wait. Ranging from excellent pre-mixed salad options (such as teriyaki chicken, cobb, caesar, etc.) and BBQ sandwiches on a roll to daily special rice plates with seafood, you will not feel cheated with options or your money.Where else will you find a meal of a BBQ sandwich, fries, pita chips, a cookie, fruit cup, and a soda for $7? That type of a deal would even make Chinatown blush. So why spend $8 for a salad at Cafe Metro or Europa Cafe when you can making out like a bandit with Gourmet 53? John Dillinger would be proud.Thanks to Yvey for showing me the light. Otherwise, I'd continue to be shrouded by clouds of darkness, letting unrewarding lunch spots rob me blind. 4.5 Stars!",4,,3
29,Stephanie P.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",163,89,60,4.0,10/21/2014,"I go here often because they have delicious salads at a great price. The Greek salad is one of the best around and comes with a cookie and bread for only around $7.It is a little hectic in there and difficult to tell what each salad is, so try to come the first time with a veteran so they can help you pick out the right salad.  They also offer a variety of entree plates that are supposed to be very tasty.The bad: I once found a hair in my salad here and it happened to a coworker once, too. It seems like this happens because the salads are out in big tubs, but needless to say, it hasn't deterred me from going back!",,,
30,Samantha R.,"New York, NY",36,72,2,4.0,10/3/2015,"Good deal. Ten bucks got me a veggie wrap (which was wonderful: sautéed bell peppers and onions with hummus and avocado), a salad, jello if I wanted it, and a drink. I'd like to add that the man working there was kind enough to improvise a veggie wrap for me since it was only listed on their catering menu. Yum!",,,

It's easily enough food for lunch, I wasn't able to finish everything in one sitting. I had the chicken avacado salad, and it had tons of avacodo and fresh lettuce with chickpeas and other treats. There appear to be many options to choose from, some are more adventurous looking (teryaki cabage salad - still looks delicious) and other classics like cobb salad. The building also has a lot of tables that are great for grabbing lunch with a buddy or making some phone calls that you can't make in your office cube.

Highly recommend it.) I also searched it online and it got pretty good reviews. So I went there and I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting... but it was just okay. I got a Southwestern Salad, plus they gave me chips, brownie and maybe a fruit cup (can't remember). The brownie was my highlight... very good! Everything wasn't bad actually... just average. You did get quite a few things included in the price and I believe I only spent about $9.00 so not bad at all but not sure if I'd be back. I was expecting more and I felt like I could only choose from salads, I saw nothing else on the board. Just okay for me.

Always nice to step away from the desk to enjoy some nice tunes. Gourmet 53 has lots of options and is reasonably price. I usually get their salad and all their entrees come with complimentary sides. I definitely recommend their bread as it is hot out of the oven and has the perfect crunch on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. The dressing that comes with it is also pretty amazing.

45,Amy C.,"Washington, DC",558,946,44,5.0,3/16/2009,"This is a popular lunch spot for my office as well as all the surrounding offices it seems. This isn't your usual deli with panini sandwiches and soups displayed in glass counters. Gourmet 53 is located in the lower level food court of 875 3rd Avenue (an office building with a couple of salons and store fronts on the 2nd floor).The best time to get here in order to beat the line is before 12:30. Between 1:00 and 2:00, the line can get so long it wraps around the surrounding tables and plastic foliage in the food court. The line moves VERY quickly. On the average day, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes. (The longest I've had to wait was 20 minutes, but that was because they were doing an anniversary promotion.) Sometimes an employee comes out with a tray of samples for people waiting on line (coconut shrimp, chicken satay, or tuna tartar). The menu is HUGE with daily specials, 2 soups made daily, salads, sandwiches, kabobs, fried shrimp, and even sloppy joe. $5.50 for a small salad, cookie, homemade pita chips, fruit cup/jello/brownie/blondie. $7.50 (or $8.50 if it's salmon) for a lunch special with side salad, pita chips, cookie, fruit cup/jello/brownie/blondie, and beverage.

47,Larry L.,"New York, NY",357,186,103,4.0,11/17/2010,"One of my favorite places to go for a quick lunch. They have huge portions with lots of extra options for you to really get your money's worth. I usually come here for the $6.50 salads with a free cookie, baked pita chips and fruit or jello cup. Don't be afraid to ask for the extras. The server will be a little reluctant and want to limit you to one, but he really doesn't care in the end.I have only focused on their cobb salad. It has all the key ingredients of a cobb salad - bacon, chicken, and corn, but the dressing is a little weird. I still don't know what the dressing is, but I know it is greasy and oily. Also, watch out for the cheese. They dump mozzarella by the handful, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but...you're eating a salad for a reason right?Come here because of: - Great value- Huge portions- Good extrasSecret pro tip here: Every year they have an anniversary lunch with $3 specials. It's on November 17 - put it into your outlook NOW. They serve hor d'oeuvres such as bruschetta, mini hamburger sliders and coconut shrimp while you wait in line. The line starts at 11:30 AM and by 12:15, it's pretty much up the escalator. So come here EARLY and you'll be rewarded!",5,4,4

49,Abe C.,"New York, NY",0,34,0,3.0,6/5/2014,"Gourmet 53 offers a decent value option for your lunch dollar. For $6.25 + tax, one gets a substantial salad + bread or chips + a cookie or small fruit cup. My tuna nicoise salad contained chunks of both tuna and hard-boiled egg. I opted for the raspberry salad dressing rather than the house.Don't forget to grab a few pita chips before ordering. And don't forget to grab a numbered ticket while in line- they give away several free lunches every day. The person in front of me was awarded a freebie.One quibble: I get annoyed whenever I see a cashier post a ""zero"" sale...makes me wonder if they are remitting tax proceeds on the sale. I vow to mention this the next time I observe this action (anywhere).",,,

Updated review","THE GOODThe food is still consistent than ever and tax is included. They also take credit cards w/ no minimum purchase. Customer service is good, as you get free coconut shrimp w/ some CRACKTACULAR berry cream dip if the lines get long. For 2010, they also started a ticketing system where 7 free lunches are awarded daily at random. I particularly fancy the chicken avocado salad (mesculun mix, garbanzo beans, avocado, multi color bell peppers, tomatoes, chicken, corn, radicchio, etc), and the choco/coco/mac nut cookie here! The balsamic salad dressing here is also crack. You can find me regularly checking in here for lunch w/ my Yelp app! Bumping the review update one star for consistency in quality and great customer service!For the entrees, you get ALL of the following:ENTREE1) meat or pastaSIDE2) starch/veggiesSIDE SALAD3) pick one (you have to ask for it)COOKIE4) the coconut/macadamia/choco chip is CRACK!DESSERT5) choose from a brownie/blondie or mini fruit saladSODA6) choose any can (help yourself)PITA CHIPS(7) seasoned and gratis if you ask for itTHE BADsammich combos increased a buck since 2yrs ago and now go for $7.50, entrees $8+ (salmon is $9.50), salads ($5.95/sm, $6.50/lrg), no free soda w/ the salads. Valuewise, it def doesn't make sense to buy a small salad here.Oh yeah, once a year for their anniversary, they roll back the prices for $3 entree lunches (no soda incl). No, I'm not telling you the date as lines are long enough as is that day.",12,4,3

53,Jessica K.,"Washington, DC",44,260,4,5.0,4/7/2010,"We stopped in as tourists looking for a cheap lunch, and this place definitely hit the spot.  Note that the restaurant is in the basement of the building, with plenty of seating and a semi-cheesy piano player. As previously mentioned, you get the freebies with your food, for $7.50.  This is a killer deal if you're traveling on a budget, and it kept us full for hours.  We got a mozzarella melt, a med wrap and a turkey & bacon club.  The mozz melt was satisfactory with very good mozz, lots of basil, and too few tomatoes in a warm pita.  The wrap came with salad and rice and was enjoyed, and the sandwich was pretty big. The portions were huge and even if the fruit cup and cookie are small and cheap gimics, it just feels great to have someone give you things for free!  Most places charge $6-8 for just the sandwich, and personally, I totally dug the fresh fruit!Vegetarian note:  I don't think any of the salads were vegetarian, they all seemed to have chicken, but this might not always be the case.  The only vegetarian entrees I saw on the menu were the mozz melt and a grilled cheese.  So, not a ton of variety, but good for one stop.  There may be something else vegetarian hidden in there, but the line did move super fast and the process was a tad intimidating so I might have missed a sign or a special!  If you're traveling with a vegetarian or vegan that wants more options, you can still try this place and they can check out the Chinese spot next door (they had a full veg menu).",3,,

At 12:15 there was no line (so I didn't really get to stuff myself with free pita chips). I got the Thursday special of surf and turf with steak and shrimp, veggies, and mashed potatoes. I thought the included salad would be just house greens but they had a big selection - Greek, Cobb, etc. and I got Caesar which actually had chicken in it and was great! Then I got my free cookie and red jell-o and an orange soda and headed outside to eat in the sun. All this for only $8.50. It's unreal!!

While still one of the better values in Midtown for the amount of food you get, the service (which was always spotty) has fallen off and even the quality of the food is not as good. The former manager left to start his own business and it hasn't been the same since. But, it'll do in a pinch. Do not get the beef stew, bland as hell. The bbq chicken sandwich is good.

I got half of the chicken and shrimp southwestern salad and half of a vegetable salad where he piled on extra delicious mushrooms and tomatoes on top. I only got the small because it is a very good portion for one person. The shrimp weren't tiny little shrimp that you can barely taste, the shrimp are big and flavored to perfection! And the vegetables were very fresh and tasty. On top of that they include a cookie, fresh garlicky pita chips right out of the oven and a fruit cup all for $6.48 with tax!!

63,Brian B.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,7,0,4.0,11/3/2009,"Probably the best deal in the area that doesn't involve a cart. You get either a sandwich with fries or a platter with salad and rice, with a can of soda, fruit cup or jello, and a cookie included. Salad is also an option, though I've never ordered it. And prices for all of this range from about $6.50 to about $8. No, you didn't just lose your ability to comprehend numbers. Those are, in fact, the prices.This isn't even including the samples you get while waiting on the line, which include pita chips, fried coconut shrimp, and bruschetta. And did I mention you can take a number for a chance to get your lunch free?The line can get long, though it moves. A little too fast, actually, as they're ruthlessly efficient in there. It can be a bit much for a first-timer once it's your turn. In addition, some of the platters can be hit or miss, though they're generally good. But these are minor complaints. If you're looking for a good, inexpensive lunch in East Midtown, it's hard to do much better.",1,1,

65,Reid T.,"New York, NY",10,7,1,4.0,1/9/2009,"Bargain Eats in the BasementSoon to become my favorite midtown lunch spot, Gourmet 53 is found at 875 Third Ave (at 53rd St). It is amidst the other 5 underground eateries, accessed by either escalator or elevator, and has a direct/walkway from the subway.There is always a line at the place, but don't let that discourage you; it only takes about 5 minutes for to get through a 20+ eater lineup. In fact, the amount of people waiting to eat here trumps the total number of people at all the other places in the ""foodcourt"" combined. I recommend heading straight for the daily specials. I got the stuffed chicken breast (spinach, peppers, and feta cheese) special. Others on the list during that day were chicken alfredo and a quesadilla.With each daily special (total cost of $7.50) you get a side item, salad, cookie (several varieties), a bag of freshly-made pita chips (must request), and can of soda. This is an amazing amount of food based on the price. As far a taste goes, the meal was fantastic, and definitely exceeded expectations based on the cost. The chicken itself was tasty and juicy, and the filling was a well-balanced combination. I ordered garlic mashed potatoes for my side item, but you can also get rice, pasta, fruit salad, or a few other options as well.I'll definitely be visiting here more often!",6,2,2

I use to get their chicken shawarma but my current fav. is their greasy cheesesteak - most sandwiches with fries. If your entree doesn't come with fries, ask them to give you a handful of fresh pita chips (I always grab one or two chips to munch on waiting for my order.)

They also have classic sandwiches, pasta, and some random specials. They usually have about 6 salads to choose from, pre-made, but be careful with the ones that contain cheese- the last two I had were literally chock full of bleu cheese - which is great, if you like a little salad greens with your cheese.

The best thing about my whole experience was the free cookie I got while waiting online to pay.  All in all, this place was not for me.  There are so many better places (treehaus being one of my preferred) but it was cheap, you get chips and a can of soda with your order and the wait wasn't long- plus there's always seating in the atrium- you get what you pay for.",,1,
