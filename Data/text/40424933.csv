The attention to detail on the 1978 Corvette was unbelievable. Working off of pictures, Bill was able to create a masterpiece which looked amazing and tasted great too (no yucky fondant!) I highly recommend Creative Cakes!",,,
1,Razvan N.,"Manhattan, NY",18,9,0,5.0,1/12/2016,This little place has a big heart. The owner Bill and his wife Denise make brilliant cake designs . They can do just about anything you want and the name Creative really apply to this store. I got my wife the best cake she ever had from this store and also did a theme cake for my company.,,,
2,Cassandra R.,"Manhattan, NY",83,3,3,5.0,9/29/2014,"William made the most awesome cake ever for a 30th Birthday. It was a taco bell cake with incredibly intricate details. There was shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce and diced tomatoes as well as fire sauce packages made of fondant. He used whipped cream to make sour cream and even used cookie crumbs to create a textured look for the meat. This cake was brought out at a restaurant and everyone was in awe and tons of pictures were taken. This was the most creative cake I have ever seen, and it tasted great too!! William is uniquely talented, and was a pleasure to work with. He was open to my suggestions and helped me make decisions based on his many years of experience to make sure the cake came out exactly how I envisioned it. Hands down I would recommend Creative Cakes to anyone who wants to give someone a creative and personalized experience for any occasion! Thank you so much again William!",3,,
