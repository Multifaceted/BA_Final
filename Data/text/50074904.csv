1,John W.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,285,151,5.0,8/19/2017,"Cozy and quiet. Excellent location between 9th and 10th Ave. Very nice room, which has really tall ceilings and is surprising big for NYC. Helpful and super-friendly staff. Enjoyed the daily guest newsletter they leave at the door. Nice continental breakfast that reminds me of the hotels in Europe. I want this place to be first on my list for NYC visits in the future.",,,
2,Brian H.,"Jacksonville, FL",128,203,436,5.0,9/5/2017,"This place was absolutely perfect. All the reviews on trip advisor that gave it a five star were spot on. It's nothing special, but it is extremely friendly, clean and convenient. Happy hour in the evenings and some free breakfast. What more could you ask for?. Well how about a concierge that really knows what she's doing. Extremely helpful. Gave us detailed hand written instructions on what subway to take for where we were headed. Also called our car for us on the last day. And, we even left some clothes in the hotel room by accident and she quickly mailed them back to us. Amazing service. Location is awesome, tons of nice little hole in the wall restaurants within easy walking distance. Never felt unsafe walking the streets.Next time we go to New York we will definitely stay here.",2,1,1
3,Jerardo A.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,15,14,5.0,6/8/2017,"This is currently the #1 traveler rated hotel on Trip Advisor and it deserves it! I decided to write a review here as there are currently under 50, while Trip Advisor has over 1,300.Thank you Susan, Jacqui, Emmy and other staff members for the great stay.The best thing about this hotel is they actually care to learn your name, where you're from and why you're in the city, what your plans are for the day and how they turned out at the end of the day.You will not be treated like guest number 1,602, in room 812 of 935, here for days 162 to 165 of 2017. No, instead you will be a part of a small 22 room hotel that will feel like a community thanks to the staff and the hotel guests you will meet during the free breakfasts and happy hour. It will start to feel like home. Throughout the trip, I would say things like ""When we get back home"" when I meant to say ""When we get back to the hotel.""During breakfast, Susan and her crew will ask you how your prior day was. They will ask you what you have planned for the day, and if you tell them what you plan on doing, they will offer general tips and guidance on how to get there. For example, we told Susan we were planning on going to Central Park, and she told us she recommended taking the blue line to 72nd Street and then gave us her recommended route through Central Park. It was fantastic!You'll have a daily newsletter at your door giving you details on the weather, as well as tips on what to do on that day. For example, Friday's newsletter said the Museum of Modern Art is free on Friday evenings. On a sunny day it recommended walking the Brooklyn Bridge and on a rainy day, the newsletter had museum recommendations.A few weeks before arriving I asked Susan for Broadway recommendations and she recommended a musical called Come From Away, which my wife and I both loved. Susan was also aware that my wife and I were traveling to celebrate our wedding anniversary and they provided us with a free bottle of champagne and chocolates. On our last day at the hotel, another couple celebrating an anniversary was there and the couple's children brought out a similar gift provided by the hotel and the entire room of people having breakfast sang them a happy anniversary version of the happy birthday song. Another time, Susan asked one of her employees to make 7 more eggs as the eggs were running out and a different employee said that it should be doubled to 14 as multiple guests had still not come down for breakfast. It's the attention to small details like this that make the hotel such an awesome place to stay.You're not going to get a luxurious hotel room, but the room we stayed in was clean,quiet,  had a comfortable bed, nice tv with multiple cable channels, and functioning AC. What it won't have are outrageous prices for daring to take a bottle or water or candy from the in-room refrigerator. Just $1 for whatever you take.My one gripe with the hotel? The door to our room was tough to close. Maybe it's because we didn't want to leave.",7,,2
4,Steven M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,0,5.0,1/15/2018,"What a gem! There is a good reason as to why there are so many 5 star reviews!   We stayed at 414 Hotel this past weekend and did not know what to expect.  All of the reviews were great, but we still were a bit skeptical.  Well, this hotel is fantastic.  We are frequent NY visitors and always stay at one of the bigger hotels...but not anymore.  We have found our preferred hotel in NY.  It's quaint, very clean, the service is fantastic and the rooms are very large (for NY standards).  It almost reminded us of quaint smaller European hotels that we have stayed at overseas.  I cannot say enough nice things about this place. The breakfast was great...the staff was super friendly....I could go on and on.  We are so happy to have found 414 Hotel!  Thanks to all of the staff for a great visit!",3,,

6,Abbey G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,0,5.0,4/2/2017,"Exceptional! Had a lovely 3 night stay. This is a charming boutique hotel that provides a daily continental breakfast and happy hour for guests. Susan and her friendly staff immediately learned our names and were so accommodating. It was a great value, and they even held our bags post checkout. Perfect to stay if you are going to a Broadway show. Highly recommend!",3,,
7,Sophia R.,"Atlanta, GA",27,25,4,4.0,5/24/2016,"Our stay at the 414 Hotel was a true delight from start to finish. The hotel is very well located, close to tourist attractions and great restaurants / bars. It is also very well placed with regards to public transportation. The hotel itself is very charming, clean, very good sized room, perfectly working Wifi, wonderful service, excellent hospitality and warm and welcoming. The breakfast service (hot and cold choices) and happy hour in the afternoon are both great! I would recommend this hotel to anybody, and we will definitely be coming back soon again. Susan and her team are wonderful!",4,1,2
8,Nick B.,"Ashburn, VA",4,5,0,5.0,5/16/2016,"We searched for a nice non chain hotel prior to heading to NYC for our first time.  I stumbled upon the Yelp reviews and thought this place looked great.  It was nice and quaint and reminded me of many of our stays in Europe.  I couldn't be happier that we picked 414 Hotel for our anniversary trip.  We'll definitely be back.The booking was pretty effortless, we filled out the information online and they got back to us within a day.  When we showed up we had some beautiful swans made from the towels on the bed and a bottle of prosecco waiting for us.  It's the little things that really stood out and how they genuinely care about the people staying.  I loved the location, just a few blocks from Times Square, easy access to the subway.  My wife and I walked everywhere, and were just very happy with where we were staying.  It was raining while we were there and they had umbrellas to borrow if you didn't have your own gear.  Susan and the rest of the staff were so knowledgeable and gave recommendations for places to go and things to try.  It was also pretty great to find out that she was vegan herself and had vegan recommendations for places we should try.  The breakfast and happy hour were really nice touches and it was fun to hang out in the lobby with other guests and really just get a family vibe going for it.  Finally to top it off, a personalized thank you note when we got home was super special.  All in all you really couldn't ask for a better place.",4,,1
9,Karen H.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,0,5.0,8/24/2017,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was lovely. The room was very nice, the staff was great. There was even a ""happy hour"" with cheese and drinks. I would definitely return!",,,
10,Katie S.,"Orlando, FL",28,53,40,5.0,7/31/2016,"I am the type of person who researches every possible place to stay, and scours through internet reviews for the best place. Through this I found 414 Hotel, and I'm glad I did! We stayed here four nights for a trip to NYC, and had a great time here. Our room (205, one of the 'premiere' rooms) was definitely spacious by city standards. We had our own bathroom (toilet, shower/tub). And still had room to walk around the room! You enter the hotel from the street (a secure door) and someone is always there at the front desk. All friendly, helpful staff. The price of the room includes daily housekeeping, breakfast (every day 7-10:30ish), happy hour (every day 5:30-7pm), and they even do a daily hotel newsletter to give you the weather, suggested activities, and listing countries that fellow guests are visiting from on that day. Lots of Europeans there with us, including a few with children. After entering the front lobby/dining area (this is where breakfast is set out for you, and where their happy hour is self-serve in the evening), we walked through the hallway to a small courtyard (more patio seating, you could take breakfast outside in good weather) and up a few stairs to our room. The daily breakfast included several choices for cereal, bagels, english muffins, toast, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal packets, juice, tea, coffee (and an espresso machine!), yogurt, and they have six different squeeze-bottle containers with toppings (peanut butter, nutella, jelly/jam, etc). Each of the staff members were helpful and seemed to enjoy being there, and were ready to offer suggestions or answer questions about the city. Definitely recommended - homelike, clean, friendly, centrally located (especially for theatergoers), and not as expensive as many other hotels in NYC - especially considering the happy hour and breakfast included. Go! Now!",3,1,1
11,Chris N.,"Tampa, FL",59,77,3,1.0,11/14/2015,"There are no ceiling fans or central air so it's too stuffy to keep all windows closed unless using AC in summer, and once the windows are open on any front-facing room the noise will be ridiculous, as will the smell of reefer emanating from the street below, which is hardly a pleasant or ""quaint"" view as advertised.Keep fit by traversing the very narrow and steep stairwells, and handling your own luggage. Staff on arrival said they could ""take one up for me"" - firstly, we had three pieces, secondly, although booking months in advance i got the fourth floor front instead of a quieter easier option, and finally it was clear the woman offering was not going to have a very easy time of it herself.Enjoy the long line of street people moving through the neighborhood to access St. Clement's Church food assistance across the street. They join the Turkish Bar next door in creating a lovely noise barrage. Again, not very ""quaint"".  An inner courtyard room is the only way to go here, but i'd never stay again with so many other superior options.  Though the neighborhood is somewhat regentrified, it's still midtown west side, and it's crappy. The claimed air of refinement and calm just isn't here.When full hot water is also a problem in the hotel.",1,,2
12,Clark P.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,13,0,4.0,10/28/2016,Pleasant and ready staff. Nice place in the heart of Manhattan. Quiet and very clear room. Perfect happy hour every day in the Hotel. Contribution report with good tips for every day. We was in this Hotel for second time.,1,,
13,B S.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,0,5.0,9/18/2017,"This is a gem - a boutique hotel not far from Times Square. We were willing to pay more for the big hotels (and earn points from a myriad of options), but chose 414 for a more intimate NY experience. Clean rooms (maybe Spartan, but with a flatscreen & Golf Channel), wine and cheese  every evening (I passed while my wife went down, but picked up on the availability of a nice selection of whiskeys) ... but the most lauded and appreciated benefit is the staff. The warm staff quickly learn your names to greet you each morning for the conti breakfast. All staff are essentially ""concierge"" that patiently help each person or couple get to their day's adventure in NY - which bus - subway - corner to stand on - ""hidden"" subway entrances/exits - they really assist in experiencing NY. Toward the end of our weeklong trip (we do our best to understand the local lifestyle in our vacations), we went to a major hotel (which has served me most excellently for business travel) for drinks and the views and realized how appreciative we were for the intimacy of The 414.",1,1,
14,May L.,"Honolulu, HI",174,251,172,5.0,12/15/2014,"This hotel was wonderful! Very small, intimate and cute with nice little area with a fireplace and happy hour. The staff was very friendly, attentive. I ended up leaving my brush there and they offered to send it to me.Room was super clean. Our room was facing the garden, although a bit noisy being on the 1st floor. But hey, we never really slept in NYC anyway!  Thank you for all your hard work!",2,1,2
15,L L.,"Westborough, MA",0,15,0,5.0,12/22/2015,"It's very impressive how this nice small operation really gets the job done in a great way.  Our room was spacious and very well maintained.  There is no elevator, but the staff will gladly take your bags up and down if you want them to.  Our room was on the top/4th floor, but we only had small bags to carry.  The bed and pillows are very comfortable.  All the people working there are very friendly, pleasant and helpful.  Nice continental breakfast; and very nice to offer the wine and cheese happy hour.  The location is tremendous; nice quiet spot, but very close to lots of action.  There are tons of restaurants, bars and shops nearby.  The subway is not too far away, Time Square is only two avenues across walk away.  We took a quick subway ride to the lower Manhattan, East Village area.  It's a short walk to the Central Park, Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center area.  We also walked over to 5th Ave., Rockefeller Center and a lot more.  To avoid the hassle of driving and traffic in Manhattan, we drove down the west side (Henry Hudson Pkwy, I believe).  It was easy to get to the hotel, but it was clear that going any deeper into the city the traffic was heating up.  We parked in the garage close by that was listed in the information we receive with our hotel confirmation. First they said the garage was full, but when I said we were staying at the 414, they were happy to park our car in the garage!  The hotel stamped our parking slip so we got a discount on the parking cost.  It was easy leaving the city by the west side, as well. Very impressive focus on customer satisfaction.  Thank you 414 staff!",2,,1
16,Susan B.,"Salisbury, MD",0,19,14,5.0,12/6/2014,"This experience literally could not have been better. The owner, Susan, and the rest of the staff  was very hands on and friendly. She spoke with us on every opportunity and was very helpful with directions and restaurant suggestions. There's a free social hour where they provide wine and cheese in the evening and a small free breakfast (both of which were a surprise to find in NY) .The room was bigger than most in New York and very intimate with only 22 rooms in the entire hotel. On top of this; it's within walking distance to Times Square and Fifth Avenue however still out if the way so that noisiness is not an issue.I don't think I've had a better hotel experience anywhere and would recommend it to anyone but especially couples looking for a nice intimate get away in New York.",1,,
17,Jacqueline C.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",3,20,0,1.0,9/8/2015,"This hotel was pure crap.  I had a room right off the ""courtyard"" and can say without question, this was the dirtiest hotel room I've ever stayed in.  I could not take my shoes off because the carpet looked incredibly dirty and was very stained.  The only thing that rivals the dirty room was the strong smell of cleaning products used to cover up the horrible stench of the room.  It was truly the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel.",1,1,
18,Neal C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,0,5.0,3/14/2014,"Midtown location of this property a big plus for business travelers and pleasure seekers alike. On biz last weekend at a Trade Conference held at the Javits Convention Center. Hoofed it there every a.m. No problem at all. As far as the property itself, I requested a quiet room when I checked in. Susan and Staff went out of their way to accommodate my request. Room was clean and comfy. Staff quite cordial and professional. Morning continental breakfasts and evening 'wine & cheese' offerings were nice touches that reenforced the impression one was staying at a boutique hotel and not at a corporate chain. The fact many of the other hotel guests hailed from various backgrounds and nationalities made our chats together in the common area all the more pleasant and interesting.Thank you, 414.",2,,1

20,Adam W.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,3,0,4.0,5/18/2015,"A wonderful little hotel in a fantastic, convenient part of the city. The staff is extremely helpful and more than willing to answer all your questions, assist with arranging transportation, and giving sight-seeing recommendations. The rooms themselves are adequate size and clean but are very sparsely decorated. Bathroom supplies were sufficient. The TV is quite old and ran only on analog cable which had very poor reception. More importantly the wifi had a strong signal even on the fourth floor and was stable for our entire stay. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in this area of the city.",1,,1

31,Beau E.,"Lexington, KY",6,31,18,4.0,10/18/2009,"The 414 Hotel is in a GREAT part of NYC if you're an out-of-towner. You can walk to Times Square, Broadway shows, tons of restaurants/bars, and it's a quick cab ride to get anywhere. When you pull up to the front of the hotel, all you see is a very plain-looking red door with a 414 logo. That is it! If you didn't know about the place, you'd never notice it. It's a very European boutique-style hotel with nice rooms and a very inviting (but small) lobby. The lobby has a fireplace, a PC with internet, and a table for breakfast. The free breakfast is OK, but why eat a plain hotel bagel when you can walk to 20 local places that offer GREAT meals to start your day. Amy's Bread (one block away) is a great place to grab a quick bite and coffee.As mentioned in the other reviews, the main drawback of this place is the lack of an elevator. The stairs are very narrow and steep, so keep that in mind if you are elderly or disabled. Our room was on the 3rd floor, so it was a bit of a job to get our two huge suitcases up there. The staff did not offer to help, but I didn't ask for help. Not a big deal for me.Once in the room, I was very impressed. The rooms are small, but nice and clean. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean. The water-pressure was decent in the shower, and there is an iron in the closet. Our room faced 46th Street, so we were worried about the street noise, but it was never an issue. The hotel is on a fairly quite block, and the air-conditioner sound helped block out the sounds of the city. Overall I would recommend this place to a friend.

It is a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Hell's Kitchen and the Theatre District. It is not ""fancy"", but rather a very European feeling establishment that is lovingly owned and run. There are many opportunities to interact with other guests (Europe style) from the breakfast to the daily Happy Hour. We stayed in the back rooms, so had no interference from street noise. It is a very easy walk to Times Square and the Subway. Did I mention it's in the heart of Hell's Kitchen?  Amazing Resturaunts within walking distance.

39,Kelly D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,7,0,4.0,12/4/2012,"What a great stay.  The hotel is simple, lovely, and all you would want for a comfortable stay.  The price was great per night and the staff, comp. breakfast, quick walk to all that Hell's Kitchen has to offer, etc made for an amazing trip.",,,
40,Daniel W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,3.0,7/2/2014,Cute place with nice staff but the rats all around the street and sidewalk really turned us off. Hard to go for a relaxed walk when dodging rodents just outside the door.,,,
41,Ryan S.,"Arlington, VA",86,121,0,4.0,8/11/2008,"3 1/2 Stars, and I choose to round up in this case.It is hard for my non-NYC brain to compute $250/night for this hotel, but few things are less expensive in NYC. We were on the first floor, so the lack of elevator was not a problem. For my weekend getaway, little luggage was brought anyway, so walking up to an upstairs room wouldn't have been too bad. The neighborhood felt safe, and was within walking distance of most of the midtown attractions.Our room, while small, had a very comfortable bed, a refrigerate, and air conditioning that worked great. It was clean, bug free, and modern with a flat screen television. The free WiFi was strong in our room, and if you needed it, there was a public computer in the lobby. We didn't spent a lot of time in our room though, as NYC has too much to see to waste time in the room.There is some room for improvement though. We had forgotten a razor and toothpaste, neither of which the front desk had for complimentary or for a fee. I feel at $250/night, this is a small thing they could do as a convenience to forgetful travelers. Also, the door to the courtyard slams shut when customers come and go, which was very audible (enough to wake me from a dead sleep), and could easily be mitigated by installing a door closer. Finally, while they allowed us to leave our luggage in the lobby after checkout until we were ready to leave the city, I'd feel better if it was kept behind the desk or in a closet.All in all, I'd stay here again, although I'll probably try somewhere else if I can find a better deal.",4,,1
42,Terry L.,"San Francisco, CA",17,27,0,1.0,3/21/2011,"As stated above, I found little to like about the 414 Hotel.  From the time I arrived and throughout my stay I was amazed out how much deferred maintenance I saw.  My room, 305, had a space heater as the sole source of heat.  It didn't have a thermostat that worked so I would get very hot and dehydrated and then when I turned it off, I got cold.  All of the outlets in the room were being used so I had to unplug things to charge my things.  Lighting is abysmal with no light source near the desk.  There was mold in the shower and peeling paint all over.  Hall carpets were filthy. They have a 72 hour cancellation policy which makes comparison shopping really difficult. Rather that stay here I would recommend The Jewel Hotel near Rockefeller Center.  Brand new, about the same price.",3,,
43,Robert C.,"Compton, CA",0,8,0,4.0,5/21/2014,"Yes, been staying at the 414 hotel for years now and Sakina has been wonderful along with the staff. I enjoyed the morning paper and the complimentary wine in my room on occasion! I recently tried to stay here and also stayed at the French Quarters...loved it as well, plus on elevator and bathrooms! Thank you Sakina for all your help and guidance. Got my friend in from Australia as well...MUCH appreciate it...anyone looking ask for her--great rates and VERY helpful. keep intouch and looking out for your guests...thank you Sakina!",,,
44,Erica S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",87,78,320,4.0,12/30/2011,"My girlfriend and I just stayed here for four nights starting on Christmas day. The rooms were very spacious for New York. The breakfast is pure carbs, just croissants, cold and hot cereal, bagels, bread. We only had it once. The hot teas are very good. The front desk was kind enough to let us grab some hot tea from kitchen after it was closed. My girlfriend had four bites on her and I had one after the first morning. Looked like a spider was happy to see us! We had new sheets put on the bed after that and that seemed to help. I had a good experience. The location was AMAZING!! Walking distance from times square and plenty of different restaurants to choose from. We accidentally came across a drag show at Vlada off 9th on a Tuesday night. It was pretty entertaining.",,,
45,C. M.,"Bethesda, MD",0,3,0,5.0,4/17/2014,"We recently returned from a stay in NYC at this hotel and would absolutely recommend it to others.  The staff and Susan were all extremely welcoming and offered recommendations for dining and sightseeing.  We traveled with our two pre-teens and having breakfast included, and leaving the hotel for sightseeing on a full stomach was a great bonus.  The rooms were clean and nicely decorated, beds very comfortable. Great location.  Will stay again if we are back in the city!",,,
46,Jess H.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,147,64,4.0,5/21/2009,"My girlfriend and I planned a last minute trip to NYC and found the 414 Hotel on a travel website, and  the rates were halfway decent since we were booking last minute and it was a weekend. We arrived and it was a cute little place. It was centrally located in Manhattan, close to the theatre district, times square, restaurants, and more. Everything we wanted to do was within walking distance, or we easily jumped in a cab down the street from the Hotel. The staff was great and even helped us pick out a few places to eat while we were there.  I'd definetly stay here again the next time I'm in NYC.",1,,
47,jessica b.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/7/2011,What a great little hotel/inn. Been staying here for years and with the upgrades going on really makes a difference.  I highly recommend it and it does not break your wallet,,,
48,Lynne B.,"Austin, TX",0,4,0,4.0,1/5/2012,"We very much enjoyed this quaint little hotel during our recent trip to the city.  The location is amazing, and the staff (especially Sean and Mary) were wonderful.  We had a large, quiet room in the back.  I highly recommend this hotel.",1,,
49,Sabrina R.,"Alexandria, VA",0,36,0,4.0,6/9/2011,"This was  a cute little hotel in midtown near times square.  No elevator as others have said and I was on the 4th floor, so that wasn't fun at times, but it was clean and the staff were friendly.  I hated having to go into times square anytime we needed the subway, but it's par for the course.  A good value. I would stay again.",1,,
50,Marcia K.,"San Diego, CA",9,111,0,4.0,10/13/2009,"We just finished an entire week and then a single night the next week at this reasonably priced hotel.  Great location, wonderful customer service, lovely amenities. It's not fancy, but it's so comfortable. The four desk people serve as consierges and are so helpful. All of their advice was spot on. The bed was comfortable (and we are picky) and the a.m. breakfast was appreciated.  The no elevator is the only reason why it's not a five. The first week we stayed on the second floor and the last night after a cruise we were on the 4th floor.  In all cases they did all the suitcase lifting up and down for us. There's a lovely little courtyard to sit in and a front teeny patio to watch NYC go by. Theaters, restaurants, transportation, and Times Square all in easy walking distance. We can't recommend this place highly enough and know that when we go back to NYC, we'll stay there. We've already told our friends about it, too.",,,
