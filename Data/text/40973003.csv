0,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",203,238,1439,4.0,10/16/2018,"Many people wonder, ""what makes a patriot""? Is it loyalty to ones country? Is it living up to the ideals of the founders of the nation? Or is it really cheap booze, bartenders that leave little too the imagination and southern trimmings? If we're going by the Patriot Saloon's definition, it's definitely the latter of the 3 options. While it seems that every bar in the entirety of Manhattan has moved to high priced, ultra luxe cocktails, there's still a few places that have still resisted the tide. Often times, these crack-slippers are more unique and worth going to if only for the ambiance. Patriot Saloon fits the bill, decked out in what can be charitably described as southern hillbilly, something wholly unexpected North of the Mason Dixon line. While the decor may lead to some askance looks, the cheap shots and drinks definitely help straighten out those looks (if only because the rest of your body is now tipping to the same side as your eyes). Whether here for pregame, post game, or all night partying this bar can more than accommodate. Maybe the speakers could be a touch quieter so conversations could be heard, but otherwise call me a Patriot for the Patriot Saloon",4,1,2
1,A. J.,"New York, NY",87,185,21,3.0,11/19/2018,"Can def be a fun place on the right day/night, but varies. One thing they should have is better music.  Not a country music fan here (which they play a lot of) but if you are you will likely enjoy the vibe.  If you're visiting from out of town though, it's not really a very New York experience.  More house, pop and better rock would liven up the mood considerably, or maybe a DJ.  Fun bartenders overall.",1,,1
2,Amanda D.,"Brooklyn, NY",315,138,414,5.0,7/3/2018,"Patriot is just...perfect. It never ceases to amaze me how cheap everything is (ex: bought a vodka soda for me and IPA for my friend for a whopping $8 the last time I was there), how fun the soundtrack is, and how friendly the people are (but not in a creepy way).There's also a little food menu if you're in ever in need of a snack and don't wanna step out. Just can't really go wrong at a place with a gator hanging from the ceiling.",1,,1
3,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",620,332,2371,4.0,4/27/2018,"I mean who doesn't love a dive. A lot of people, that's who, but if you're pro dive, then you'll appreciate the Patriot. This place has been around forever, walking in the door clarifies that immediately. The bar is old, the music is old, the booths are old, and of course, most of the dudes who come here are old. Not that I am complaining about that in anyway shape or form, as I appreciate a dive for what it is - a crap hole where old folks come to get cheap beers and listen to music they appreciate. this place also serves up food, but a quick trip into the bathroom lets you know that it's probably not a good idea to eat here (I like dives, but food poisoning, not so much). Come here for crazy cheap drinks, and a throwback to NYC of yesteryear (authentic old men included in the price of admission).",9,8,11
4,Michelle P.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",18,91,86,4.0,4/15/2018,"I woke up craving buffalo wing so I stopped at this bar on my way home. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the bras, the cheesy love songs, a blast from the past.I ordered mild buffalo wings and a very cheap beer. I could not have been happier. The price was very good, the server was very friendly and the wings were simply delicious. I will definitely return there with friends. It's decadent, I loved it.",1,,
5,Dumond A.,"Manhattan, NY",7,87,5,4.0,6/26/2018,"It's precisely what you'd want and expect from a dive bar, but with more over-the-top decor and a nice vibe!  One of the bartenders once challenged us to drink a whole pitcher of beer in one go, for free.  Didn't take her up on it because we're lame.Prices for pitchers of beer and bar food are excellent, especially for the area.  You can get a pitcher for as low as $10, most expensive is around $20 for Guinness.  Only downside is that, like most dive bars, it's cash only and the ATMs require a surcharge of about $3 per withdrawal.  So all you have to do is remember to bring a wad of cash and avoid the giant alligators hanging from the ceiling.",1,,
6,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,3.0,1/15/2018,"TLDR: dive bar with affordable beer and pay as you go foosball / pool; no frills feelCame here on a Tuesday night around 11:45pm with two friends. Understandably, the place was pretty empty. Given that I prefer wine and cocktail bars to dive bars, this review is probably biased, but the ambiance of this place left much to be desired. The tables and chairs were pushed to the side and stacked, making the already empty bar seem abandoned. There were also many bras hanging from the ceiling, which I found odd.The one major upside to this place was the well-priced beer. I was able to get a pint of my favorite beer (founder's all day IPA) for less than $5. The bar is cash only, but with drinks this cheap, it seems silly to pay with card.The one pool table and foosball table on the second floor are both coin operated and cost $1.50 and $0.75 per game, respectively. While we were able to get one game of pool in (other patrons played us for the table and we ended up losing in a very close game), the people we lost to dominated the pool table for the rest of the night, which was slightly annoying. We retreated to the foosball table though and had fun getting in a couple of games there.Would probably opt for a place with better ambiance and more pool tables vs. returning here, but if you're seeking really affordable beer, this place could be your spot.",,,
7,Sarah G.,"Jersey City, NJ",107,142,26,3.0,5/25/2018,"Waaaaay too country for me. I get it ""patriot saloon"". The name should have indicated that I wouldn't like it that much, but since the bar we went to prior had the worst service ever, this was our back up option. The three stars I'm giving this place comes down to the service we received. I don't remember what the waitresses' name was (I will update after I ask my friend; as he does remember), but she was so polite and kind to us when we arrived to have a few drinks. I appreciated that a lot after our experience at a bar down the road where the waitress was more interested in talking to her friend than serving customers. Overall, it's kind of divey but it seems a lot of folks come in for cheap drinks (they have pitchers of budd...or coors...or pbr...one of those beers I wouldn't touch if you paid me.) The atmosphere was lively, so it wasn't horrible. I don't know if I'd come here again, but it's not because it's a terrible place. It's more because it's just not my kind of bar.",1,,1
8,Beril E.,"New York, NY",155,99,458,4.0,2/21/2018,"When it comes to dive bars, The Patriot is as divey as it can get. As an absolute lover of dive bars, I don't understand why people are disappointed with the atmosphere. After all, you're not going to a fancy bar on Stone Street, where you pay $8 on a pint and are able to get table service for on your order of truffle fries. You're going to a true dive bar, where the drinks are dirt cheap, bras are hanging from the bar area just because, the food is greasy and basic, and the clientele is your neighborhood repeat crowd. I love and feel at ease in this place. Aside from the few moments when rowdy Wall Streeters hijack the place, the occupants are not pretentious or showy; they just want to get a drink after a long day of work.  People mostly sit around the bar area and speak with the chatty bartenders, so you can easily find regulars who come here on their own. Everyone minds their own business.Most of their pitchers are within the $9-13 price range with offerings like Guinness, Shock Top, Goose Island IPA, Yuengling, Blue Point Toasted Lager, PBR, and Stella Artois. If you are looking to have a really cheap and greasy time, get their $7 pitcher of Patriot Ale and a bunch of their tasty sliders to share and keep 'em coming. They have fries, hot dogs, onion rings (my favorite), mozzarella sticks, and wings as some alternative fast food options. Don't expect to be able to order a salad here. The music vacillates between classic rock and country. I've been here enough times to know exactly when it switches from classic rock to country, so I ensure to have had a bunch of drinks by that time to endure the transition. As you can tell, I am not a country fan.  There's also a pool and a Foosball table for those who come in groups.",1,1,2
9,Nikk A.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,139,34,4.0,4/1/2018,"The Patriot is exactly what it should be, nothing more, nothing less. It is a dive bar, there are bras and cowboy boots on the ceiling. They have a nice selection of beers and liquor. The bartenders are super cool and the bathrooms, although small, are far from the worst I've seen. There's ample seating, two floors and they serve food. Which I can only vouch for the fries- and they're pretty damn good. The booze is cheaper than most of the other bars in this area, but they only take cash. They do have an atm available though which is good. I took away one star because they really need to add to their music collection.",,,

I have been here for 4 nights now, and The Patriot is by far my best experience (and trust me, I've hit about EVERY pub in this area-ha). It's supposed to be a dive bar, but is decently appointed inside. Bar was crowded, but we were able to belly up after 5-10 minutes. The CHEAPEST drinks I have found, by FAR.  There were two employees working. A worthless door person who didn't lift a finger, and a bartender who simply kicks ass!  This lady handled the bar like no other. She was running from end to end. Clearing tables, pouring drinks and personable to EVERY customer. She said hi to every person who walked in and bye to everyone who left.We didn't order food (and not sure if they serve it).

Real, classic country mixed in with current country hits - really a playlist you wouldn't find in many other NYC bars. The place is divey and pulls off that down and dirty country vibe as opposed to a classier country vibe. There's a Big Buck Hunter in the corner (which was unfortunately turned off when I was there) and an old jukebox on the wall where you'd be hard pressed to find anything other than country. Bras hanging from the lights and random signs scattered, it's a place that definitely doesn't take itself seriously, and that's awesome.Add in the fact that I got a big pitcher of beer for $9 and I already know I'll be back.",1,1,1

They do have a small food menu with decent prices, but they also let us buy a pizza across the street and bring it back to the bar.  Not sure if they'd let anyone do that or if we were just lucky because we were with a regular.  Either way, it made us stay longer to chat in a nice corner booth.",,,

If it weren't the only real dive bar close to where I work I wouldn't go back, but that's what it has going for it! Head over if you're strapped for cash in TriBeCA.",,,
51,Neal W.,"New York, NY",58,129,0,2.0,5/6/2017,"A true dump. This neighborhood could use a good bar. If you're young and want the experience of a divey bar, okay this passes, but the prices are too high to be a real dive bar. $11 for a shot of tequila that sells for $18/bottle is not dive-bar pricing. Prices are inline or above other nicer bars in NYC. It's cash only, so be prepared. If you're looking for a place to meet someone professionally in that area after work, there are very few good options, but this one is really not appropriate.",1,,
52,Eamonn H.,"Easton, PA",43,148,85,5.0,11/4/2016,"Pretty much the perfect dive bar, located right in Lower Manhattan.  Where else can you get $7.50 pitchers of (crappy) beer, cheap bar snacks, friendly bartenders, and Big Buck Hunter in the city?  My only complaint is that it's cash only.",,,
53,Débora L.,"Jersey City, NJ",110,38,26,4.0,9/25/2016,"Cheap beers, great service and good music. What else is there to say? Don't expect a classy place, you get what you pay for. Come if you want to have fun and if you don't want to care if people are judging you for what you are or wear. No one cares about that in this place, that's what I like about it.",,,1
54,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,5/22/2015,"Went on a Thursday around 5:00PM.Ambience: Like others mentioned, very dive bar-ish with interesting decoration. In one corner you have bras hanging, on the other, the Buddha statue.  The crowd was mostly male; from construction workers, to hipsters, to corporate guys that work in the area; the crowd is eclectic. I was there with one guy and one girl friend but I noticed when my guy friend went to the bathroom, all eyes were on us; so I can see why girls could easily be harassed.   Music was mostly rock and country. Service: Bartenders were friendly and attentive.Drinks: Cheap...a double shot drink was $7.25; shots of vodka are like $4.Overall, this is a good place for pregame or cheap (and fast) happy hour.",2,,
55,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1851,4.0,4/19/2013,"4.5 stars...This is my kinda place. This is a very spacious two level bar that's ultra divey. It's a mixed crowd of locals and the bartenders are not only amazingly hot but some of the friendliest and most attentive ones I've ever come across. The music here was awesome but that's highly subjective (not everyone is a fan of Johnny Cash and Bon Jovi). Best of all are the prices. There isn't a single beer in the house more than $4.75 (beers are $2.50-$4.75). They also have a small menu of sliders and fried stuff (also at super low prices). As I said this is a duel level bar, hey have pool upstairs and a couple games downstairs. If they just put in a couple dart boards I would have probably bumped them up to 5 stars.Update:Came back and had the best bartender ever, she wasn't the one I had before so I know it wasn't a fluke last time. I'm practically in love with this girl. Anyway I tried their food this time. I got the sliders. The cheeseburger sliders are $2 each unless you get 10 or more then they're $1.50/each. They're thick (like they started with a ping pong ball size of meat and flattened it a bit) and served on potato rolls with some pickle slices and ketchup packets on the side. Sadly they don't ask how you want them cooked but they were juicy and really very good.",2,,3

Yes. There just happened to not be a lot of scenery/interesting crowd there during happy hour. I love my dive bars so I'm going to give this place another shot at some point. 1 star for price, 1 for service, and 1 star for staying true to your Roadhouse-like theme.",,,

Or maybe it was the 3 pitchers of beer and 9 deep fried oreos we had for under $25.Whatever it was, this place was the shiznit and I would definitely come back here again.Awesome bartenders, awesome music, awesome everything and I didn't even know there was a second floor until I came on here.Everything is so cheap.Aaaaand you are super close to the PATH train which allows you to get back to the greatest state in The Union.",4,1,1

They have weird drink/food specials and the guys in suits have their eyes glued to what's behind the counter. Can someone please explain to me what a ""pumpkin pie shot"" is?Minimal seating.

Whoever was the slim long curly haired woman working upstairs on Jan. 9th has some serious working to do with her customer service. Never met anyone treat customers so rude. Was immediately hostile to me, throwing money at me after ordering a drink, even tho I still tipped her, figuring she desperately needs money to survive by the looks of it. Treated all customers with unbelievable rudeness, and didn't care at all to see if anyone was taken care of. I will definitely not be coming to this place again. This woman definitely needs to be retrained, not only in bartenders, but in life. Wish her the best in life!",3,2,
76,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,11/22/2013,"Oh, Patriot Saloon. The first time I heard about this dive was when a friend from Michigan was in town with his brother. He was staying around the block in a fancy schmancy hotel and started day drinking while I was at work. He later commented when I was free, ""We have to go back to the bar across the street from my hotel! It's amazing! There was this old lady behind the counter that I swear was a Golden Girl! She gave me drinks. It was so cheap and amazing!"" So we walked in here at happy hour time and girls with hot pant short shorts were strutting their shit and disgusting well drinks were being poured out to greasy hard laboring men, bras hanging from the rafters country honky tonk kind of place folks. . . . .both of my friends jaws I saw slightly drop and we downed one gin/tonic apiece and ran out of there. ""I SWEAR IT WAS DIFFERENT IN THE DAYTIME."" Ha. I believe him. But Patriot Saloon is kind of a coyote ugly-esque bar of the downtown Tribecca area. Have I come back inside after that first experience? I sure damn have. Probably at least on 3 separate occasions. Drinks are cheap as dirt. This time we were having a girls pow-wow. Not my idea and we were all upset and these dudes offered to buy us shots. The shot special of the day was pumpkin pie. It was the best decision I have ever made in my life and I make some pretty god awful ones. PUMPKIN PIE LOVE LIQUID GOLD. Disgusting bar with some genuine charm. Of course, I will be back one day, Patriot Saloon.",1,1,

80,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,8/30/2012,"So, now I know what it means to enter the dark world that is Jerry Springer's mind. Cheap beer. Effing. Cheap. Beer.  Bra's and panties hanging off the walls and ceiling. Pinball machine, pool tables upstairs, killer jukebox, divey decor, and goofy weird stuff like an alligator on surfboards suspended from the ceiling.  The bathroom is the portal to Hell and every STD known to human existence. Country music and southern fried rock playing all day long. Think Alabama, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Outlaws, and Molly Hatchet. Cute-ish female bartenders that look a bit like they either want to call you ""sweetie"", make out with you while smoking a cigarette, or shank you in the back when you're not looking. Or all the above. When we walked up I noticed a sign outside proclaiming, ""Shameless Slut Bartenders Wanted - Inquire Within."" Inside scattered about a few tables the ""talent"" or ""victims"" were filling out job applications.  It was early in the evening, and the place was kind of empty save for a few of the regulars that look like they could have actually been on the Jerry Springer show. We still had a few more bars to hit and the night was young, so we just had a few PBR's and admired the trashy dive decor. Grimy, dirty, smelly, and beaten down with shattered dreams of hopes and wobegone optimism of all the youth that have worked here or passed through those doors. Sigh - I love a good dive bar.

My only issue is that the jukebox downstairs has only country music, and the one upstairs has *almost* only country music. I did find some Journey on there, but yeah, I can't listen to country western the whole night, it just doesn't do it for me.

However, I had such a great time on Friday that it is now review time!First, a shout out to our server, Diana. She's awesome. Every time we wanted more drinks she was never far away. Plus she was genuinely friendly! Both, the girls and guys, in our party enjoyed her service and small-talk. Sometimes you get the vibe that servers are only friendly for a tip or that their company demands them to be over-the-top friendly; she just came across as someone who loves her job and loves facilitating fun for other people. Thanks Diana!Second, the beers are cheap. I don't really recall how cheap, but it's in the $3.50 to $4.00 range and I think pitchers are like $9.00. I don't know of any other spots in the area that try to compete with that price point.Third, they have two levels, so there is plenty of space for a big group.Forth, they have an old-school sit-down table arcade gameFifth, they serve bar food pretty late. I recommend the sliders. They aren't earth-shattering but they are fun sized and what you'd expect from a dive bar.Overall, this is a very good dive bar. If you are into that scene, The Patriot is about as good as it gets. (Note: this is not a super-dark, dingy, quiet dive bar, it's a bit more on the upbeat side)",5,2,2

Which I must say-the cherry one was good. Other than that I was disappointed- My friends ordered Onion Rings  which were so burnt & crushed together it looked as though they took an animal & just threw it in the depths of the fryer. It took a while for my 6 sliders to come out, which lacked any type of flavor except the taste of meat (I am pretty sure garlic powder or pepper & salt is not scarce around Chambers St.-Sazon,the restaurant is around the corner). The wings were alright, they also lacked some pizazz.The only good things about this place is if you want cheap food or drinks its the place to be-just remember you get what you pay for. A shot of Fireball was like $4.75 and the $5 Margaritas is the only thing I actually tried but my friends enjoyed the ""P***Y Juice"" drink. If you want a fake Alligator on a Surfboard over your head,with undergarments in his mouth-this is the place for you. If you want a hole in the wall bathroom with dry rot wood around the sink & look like it hasn't seen a mop since its grand opening-this is definitely the place for you. If you want something with some sort of normalcy close to class this is NOT the place for you. Just because its a Dive bar doesn't mean I have to go to an abyss to get good service.After ordering our items separately-my friends wanted to wait until they were done ordering for the afternoon to give the bartender a tip. Before they even had a chance to do so-she moaned and groaned about receiving $5 when they weren't even done with ordering. She must have talked about it for a good 10 minutes & told everyone that came up about it. That really turned me off from wanting to go back there or even have her serving me-she even said ""Next time I won't be so nice."" Are you kidding me? What the heck happened to Customer Service- you need to provide a service first before you are compensated for it. We ended up leaving & they did not leave more tip for her because she was very unprofessional. She's a slim, dark haired Caucasian chick.",3,3,1

100,Eddie G.,"Bronx, NY",34,120,21,1.0,6/18/2014,Randomly stopped by the patriot saloon and well it's definitely sketchy. I gave it a try because I was with friends who wanted a good drink. We had our drinks but I ordered their hamburger sliders. Food service was very slow. 30 min for 4 sliders? Unacceptable. Michelle our bartender reminds us that the kitchen would sometimes run out  of supplies which would make the wait longer than usual. As for the sliders...not very good. For me I'm glad it's the only time I show up to the patriot saloon,1,1,
101,Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,317,179,1.0,5/2/2016,"I felt so discriminated in this place it was like being transported to Arizona during the 1070 law and being an illegal immigrant. None of which I am. Obviously I am Hispanic, and my friends are Hispanic and African American. We came in and sat next to a table of Caucasians and the waitress automatically made us PAY after each round meanwhile the Caucasian table next to us had an open check. We weren't asked if we would like to open a tab, we weren't given an option. It was pay per order or leave. Somehow (and I don't know why) we decided to stay and order. The wings brought the carrots and celery in a ziplock bag, the hot dog wasn't really grilled, the fries were cold and the whole experience was simply horrible. Avoid this place unless you're Caucasian, you will be discriminated against solely on the color of your skin. Also, they only take cash.. Supposedly.. Or maybe they just thought since we were Hispanics and blacks our credit cards were stolen or something. I wouldn't put it past them.",2,6,
102,Andrew S.,"Manhattan, NY",143,90,2,5.0,8/13/2013,"I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm a huge fan of the Patriot. It could be the divey feel which the Patriot readily embraces while other bars actively shy away, the outdated country music from the jukebox, or the clientele that find their way in, but for some reason it all adds up to a place I love.The Patriot isn't strictly limited to fratty late nights either; I've brought my co-workers in for a quick after work drink and come away with the same great time. Drink prices here will give your favorite cheap place a run for the money with pitchers of almost all domestic drafts $11 and under, including Brooklyn Lager and Blue Moon, and wines and cocktails are priced to buy as well. The upstairs area is huge with a pool table tucked away in a corner and friendly people always ready for a game. More importantly, the servers are happy to engage in conversation or serve up more shots than you can handle at either bar on the two floors. Don't be surprised at the various state of undress you find the bartenders in. I'm not sure they have a dress code here for anyone, and if they do, I'm not sure I want to know what it is. If you haven't been in yet, check it out and you won't be disappointed. Just make sure your expectations are set in line with the experience you're about to enter. It's called the Patriot, get ready to feel very American.",4,3,5

104,Russell B.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",298,199,415,2.0,12/9/2013,"I guess if you're a single dude and you goto  this place with a bunch of ""bros"" it's awesome, but I came here with my GF and my co-workers... sooo yea, we were just looking for good beer.The price of the pitchers were affordable, but the beer was seriously watered down. I thought the coors light, was flat ginger ale. The burgers are hit or miss, out of 4 that were included in the order, 2 were overdone and 2 were medium rare. The wings were ok, but they give you the Blue Cheese and the celery/carrot in a plastic glad bag like it's a 4th graders lunch. Really lame. They confused a bunch of orders, and the waitress was running around with her head cut off trying to get them correct. I mean this was for the order of fries, she was so determined to find the order of fries, and who got them... while we're all thinking ""They're only fries for 3 bucks. Just make another batch."" Nope she was determined to waste 10 minutes to find them!The bouncers/guys who stand at the door are pretty rude. I guess that's entitled with the position, but dude be cool to the people who are in your bar spending money. Also they don't take credit card. Really?! At a bar in NYC? how do these places exist anymore? Oh that's right! The bar tenders!!!Yup, the bartenders (all woman) pretty much wear nothing. As a dude I was even asking myself ""Dag, isn't that a little too much they have out?"" It was like Halloween in there. You know the chicks who justify their extra extra revealing outfit on that day of the year? Yup it's like that in here on your regular December 6th 2013 Friday night. Lastly the bartenders can't even poor beer. After my pitcher was poured, I had to wait 5 minutes for all the foam to go down. When I asked her ""How did that happen?"" She shakes her head, and does a dance... I'm waving my ten dollars trying to get her attention and thinking in my head ""Just get me my damn change.""3 for the bros.1 for every other type of human.",,5,2

106,Jennifer C.,"Ossining, NY",0,8,0,1.0,10/5/2013,"I like dive bars, I really do... the Patriot just puts on dive bar garb to hide the fact that it's a shitty place. If you like good beer, don't go here - from the taste of the beer, I have to assume that the taps are all caked in mold. (But don't worry, they've got $2 cans PBR for frat boys who just want to get trashed.)If you are a self-respecting woman, don't go here - the bartenders are all strip club rejects who dance on the bar (poorly) in an attempt to get over their daddy issues and increase tips. They also encourage female patrons to do this, but for some reason not the men. Oh and don't forget the bras hanging everywhere, which according to previous commenters are from past patrons who were given shots in exchange for their dignity.If you hate country music, don't go here - you'll find little else on the jukebox.If you don't want to spend time with homophobes, don't go here - many of the douchey frat boy patrons are homophobes and the staff sees no problem with it.If you want to have space to sit on the toilet while you use the restroom, don't go here - I've been in roomier (and better smelling) port-a-potties.So basically if you're a douchey frat boy whose sole aim is to get fucked up, this is a great place.

That being said, if you're in the mood for cheap drinks, $5.00 burger sliders or some cheap attention this is your spot. It's definitely a surprising juxtaposition against the fancy shmancy Tribeca folk or the after-work professionals bustling through the area in their suits. This place is far more laid-back then the aforementioned crowd.There is loud country music that blasts through the bar and sporadically the music shuts off and then resumes once more. The decor is at its bare minimum with random knick nacks tacked up on the wall. The bartenders are pretty friendly and since there isn't too much of a crowd here, they give you pretty individualized attention.",,1,2

She's asian and I believe her name is Nicole. My first time seeing her. So energetic and lively and just puts you in a great drinking mood. Very quick and attentive. Got me to dance on the bar even though I'm quite a shy person.

However, the prices here are a bit of a draw, USD3-5 for a US-sized pint is pretty good value for a good beer even when you stick the ridiculous tip on top. I mean really, pay a living wage people!

113,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,3.0,2/16/2011,"The Patriot Saloon is the diviest of dive bars, and it wears this title like a badge of honor. It's blue-collar, trashy, loud, cheap, and almost always a good time.Perhaps my first visit here some years back will set the scene for what you may expect. The jukebox kicks into Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"". The room of middle-aged day laborers erupts in anticipatory applause and cat-calls. I sit meekly on my bar stool, both scared and excited about what is about to unfold before me. Out walks a barmaid with an outfit of simply short shorts and booby tassels, carrying a hula hoop. She swings her girls around a bit, takes a shot of what-looks-like motor oil, then proceeds to exhume a flame through the hoop once her expelled liquor is lit to dramatic effect. The song ends and she returns to her post behind the bar, slingin' drinks. I was scarred for life, yet still ordered another.Now, I don't know if this happens every time someone plays this Man in Black signature song. I would imagine it losses its effect after some time and it's an awful lot to expect from a woman outside of a strip club. However, in my visits here since, it hasn't stopped the bartenders from tending bar while scantily clad for the mostly-male clientele. Leather, fishnets, and lingerie seem to be encouraged, but cleavage is most certainly mandatory. And lots of it. Plus, let's not sell these girls short - ""Ring of Fire"" isn't the only trick they've got up their sleeves (read: G-strings), but I'm gonna let you experience the rest for yourselves.The Patriot Saloon is filthy fun, but I can't help feeling, upon exiting, like I need a shower or at least an eye-wash from one of those contraptions in the back of high school science classrooms. Plus, the taps here rarely work, and when they do, you don't want none of that. The regulars have cans in their hands, anyway - it'd be wise to follow suit. This place is a circus, a sideshow, and a train wreck. And yet sometimes, you just can't look away.",6,5,5

When all of those things intersect in one establishment it's cosmic in its serendipity. Ergo...the best dive bars are ones which possess as many of those qualities as possible simultaneously.

I tell them that I'm still working on getting a beer.  My first beer.  Finally Sunglasses notices me.  She walks over, and mutters something. I say ""I'm sorry?"" She mutters it again and smiles, and then kind of falls over a little bit.  I assume she asked me what I was drinking. I tell her a Bud Light.  She frowns.  She gets really quiet.  And then she lifts her hand above her head and SLAMS it into the bar screaming in gibberish.  She then turns around, and crumples up into a ball.  She does not get me a beer.5:20PM: Sunglasses is still standing motionless in a ball like formation - so I give up and decide to try the upstairs bar.  My friends had warned me it was a shit show - but I can't imagine it's worse than what I just witnessed.  5:21PM: It is worse.  Much worse.  The bar is more crowded upstairs - all older skeez balls watching the scantily clad bartender bounce up and down around the bar.  She is most likely old enough to be my mother, assuming she had her first child when she was 13 - which is when I'm assuming she had her first of many children.  She is clearly high, and for all of the bouncing she's doing, she's not pouring very many drinks.  In fact, I watch her for 10 minutes and she opens not one bottle.  Instead, she is draped over the bar, licking her lips at an older gentleman.  Everyone seems happy but me.  No one is drinking.5:45PM: I'm outside, getting a breath of fresh air.  I am contemplating leaving - except for the fact that I haven't even had a chance to say hi to my friends yet.  I instead tweet about my sadness, take a deep breath, and walk in with new determination to get a DAMN BEER!6:00PM: I have three beers in my hand.  I have ordered three so that I do not have to go through the experience of ordering a drink from this bar ever again.  The busy bartender is apparently busy because she's the only one in this awful place who is concerned with the sale of alcohol (and also not high on quaaludes).  6:05PM: I have drank my three beers and I'm in a much better mood.  As I stand there, my friend grabs me to warn me about the shirtless waitress carrying a large tray of beers behind me.  The following interaction takes place;Friend: Chris, watch out - there's a bra coming up behind you.Waitress Only Wearing a Bar: I AM NOT JUST A BRA!

Updated review","A-ok, is the word, not that great though, not like years before.  This place is a dive bar, yes and worth coming to for the cheap booze.  I come here once every two or three months.  Last time I was here was actually new years eve, I was heading home to actually be home before 12 then ended up here.  Already had a few beers from early in the evening, the atmosphere was cool.  Nice little countdown to the ball drop, about 4 or 5 ladies dancing on the bars and two other girls wearing a fake diaper and carryin around a pen wanting you to sign their butt (I helped them out).   This place is weirder than that, seriously.  Country music is blarred here, it is ok though to hear some Johnny Cash and Rolling Stones (Paint it Black and Wild Horses) as first songs I listened to in 2013.  The best part coming here was alot of free champagne samples were passed around, not just one per person. I was like just keep drinking till they are gone and pass some more around to the people next to you.   Sometimes there are some drunken regulars that seem to be here from like 4pm and not leave till 1am or something, but it is cool they seem harmless or harmless enough.  The girls are here to entertain you, beers are mostly what I stick to ordering here.  I get the beer on tap but mostly only from downstairs, upstairs sometimes the tap are wack or just somehow funky.",1,1,3
124,Nick H.,"Long Island, NY",32,196,109,5.0,11/26/2012,"A Country Western themed dive bar that feels like it's set in Seattle circa 1991.  When I first walked in and saw the grungy, dirty, dark interior I expected to be greeted by the sounds of Mudhoney or the Melvins, but I would hear nothing of the kind.  I walked up to the jukebox, and after a quick glimpse at the available songs, I realized that The Patriot Saloon was more Hank Williams than it was Kurt Cobain.  Absolutely nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I expected - but I guess with a name like The Patriot Saloon, I should have put two and two together.  After a few rounds of cheap $2 or $3 beer, I settled in and began to really take a liking to this place.  I began to think about what a real gem this place was.  Seems like you really have to go out of your way to find great places like this.  I would have never even known that this place existed if it wasn't for my friend who lives in the city.  I don't do a lot of drinking when I go the city, but I now know that I don't necessarily have to pay $7 or $8 for a beer at some bar that has no personality.  The Patriot is an awesome place to unwind and have a few beers.  The atmosphere is lively and energetic, and from what I was told we didn't even get to see the real debauchery that usually occurs here.",3,,
125,Jorge G.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,636,246,5.0,7/18/2012,"""No ties allowed"" --if you forget to take off your dorky, junior-stockbroker's-assistant power necktie when you order; you have to do a shot. A house rule which says it all, really. You almost expect to find Judge Roy Bean behind the bar in this place. (That's muh rulin'!)Yes, this filthy tumbleweed of a bar is ""win-win"" in so many ways. I don't know if any one review can summarize why it transcends all 'standard' dive bars. Its the kind of place so far gone in its own weird dimension that its beyond any kind of criticism. This place separates the boys from the steers.For a while, I've been in the habit of bringing dates here as a test of whether they are really as 'down to earth' as they claim to be. Lots of New Yorkers like to say they can hang with anything; well this bar experience is the way to find out for sure. The Patriot is an old standby of mine; seen me through good times and bad; for me its a place to re-charge my spirit. But its interesting to see whether a girl 'gets it' or not.You walk in and right away there's that unmistakable noxious odor to deal with; that odor that all long-time bars have. Combination of urine, vomit, armpits, stale beer, must, mold, sweat, cheap cologne, and cleaning products. She's still with you? Good sign.Next: sit yourself down in any of the chairs--if you can find one without the stuffing coming out; or appearing ready to splinter underneath you--and get ready for some **serious** drinking. Cheap shots and cheap beer; is the way things go here.Next, realize that its a country & western bar. Even for girls who say they 'love all kinds of music'; this can be a hurdle to overcome. But there's the old-school jukebox, right there in the back (flip style) and it ONLY has C&W available. Hank Williams & Co. And its loud. Can she deal with it? Next: time to 'freshen up'. Another challenge. Women usually return from the Patriot's restroom with all the blood drained from their face; and shock in their eyes. Well, I'm sorry but the men's lav is not any better, I assure you. Next: the choice of waitstaff and bar-wench (selected by the bar's mysterious owner) is not difficult to fathom. These girls are mostly aspiring actresses; they run their legs off in this place; and they're always in a great, upbeat mood.  They expect--and receive--some of the highest tips in the city. Worth every penny, too. The reason is, they are some of the bustiest, most eye-poppingly buxom babes imaginable. Falling out of their shirts, right into your face! Shirts? Often they're wearing mere bras. The Patriot is the next best thing to a strip club--heck, in some ways its better than a strip club. The bartenders sometimes dance on the bar; sometimes make out for ya (or with ya); do shots right along with you; bump/grind for ya; they participate cheerfully in ""lingerie night"" and ""bikini night"" and are just the coolest, sexiest, awesomest bar girls ever. Rest assured, they know exactly what is legal --and what is not--and they never stray over the line. But man, you can sure live on the difference. If the bathrooms had any privacy you'd probably have to go in there to beat off.But back to your date. She's still there? Where is she? Well at this point she may either be shocked by your gall in bringing her here; she may be disgusted and despising you; she may be wilting and woozy and having the worst night of her life; she may be glaring daggers at the too-saucy bar-wench; or she may be tonguing tequila out of one of their navels. If the last-mentioned is underway (true story); you know you have a winner on your hands. If any of the former are in evidence; let her leave --boot her out, actually--and you just stay right there in the decrepit bowels of The Patriot and continue to enjoy yourself. Good riddance. Order another round of PBR; sliders; fries; and o-rings. If she can't hang with this scene, send 'er packing! This is a place where you come to be a man. She might as well see this side of you sooner rather than later.And afterwards? When its all over? When romance is dead? This bar is here for you when all women have left your life; when they've dropped you to the curb for good and agony keeps twisting you up in knots. When you're a failure, loser, low-life, jerkoff, crud, and crumb...well..you can still come here and find solace. If not--if all else fails it is probably the best bar you want to be in to commit suicide. No better way to go out; than partying your ass off here.""Sundance, a man's entitled to his opinion...."" --and in my opinion-- this is the best bar in the entire city. Viva la Patriot!

130,Thomas S.,"Manhattan, NY",302,87,1,4.0,4/24/2012,"Every time I've ever gone to The Patriot I've drunkenly screamed the question to my friends, ""Why don't we come here every night?!"". This is usually followed with a trip to the cramped bathroom where I throw up everywhere. And it's at that moment that two things happen. One, I realize why we don't come every night. Two, I reevaluate my life.The Patriot is one of the few great true dive bars left in the city. It's two levels, plays country music, and has a $5 whiskey shot and PBR special. The bartenders drink with you, and as a result usually end up dancing on the bars themselves while handing out free shots. My liver could not handle being a regular here, but it's fun every once in a while to get bombed here. Big events in my friends' lives are marked by a trip to The Patriot. One time my friend got engaged, and I asked her if she wanted to celebrate with a nice dinner, and I could see the wheels in her brain spinning. The light went on. And she whispered as if we were in an old Gary Cooper western, ""The Patriot."". It ended up being one of the best nights of all time. Of all time.If you're looking for a hot club scene or a date spot, then this place is not for you. I have to say that if you find a girl that likes getting bombed at the Patriot, she's special and you should keep her. You'll never find a tourist here, and it's not very clean. Come here with a good group of friends after work, play some pool, and forget your troubles with their ridiculously cheap drinks.",10,14,9

If such a thing were possible. And I don't mean the movie Coyote Ugly, I mean the actual chain of bars in flyover states that claim to have hot girl bartenders with daddy issues in teddies, singing and dancing on tables while pouring Absolut Vodka down everyone's throats. I'm sure such a place exists, but this is not that place.At The Patriot, you will find haggard lady bartenders (just look at the Yelp pictures. Regal beauties they are not) that reek of whisky and desperation dancing around in unflattering outfits while pouring plastic-bottle liquor down everyone's throats. And those are just the people that are paid to be here. Yes, the liquor is cheap, but you have to be hammered to appreciate this kind of place. It's not generosity that keeps the girls pouring shots for you, it's something akin to the bait-and-switch. After about 10 full-sized glasses of rubbing alcohol, a Zimbabwe children's labor camp would probably seem tolerable too. Hey, if you like this kind of thing, go for it. Just make sure you get the HIV swab on your way out.One star for the jukebox. Another for enthusiasm. Actually, scratch that.

My night started and ended in margarita shots. At $2 a pop, I gulped down an inglorious 20, or so was the tale, my barmates told. We stapled our diet with $3 PBRs and Six fiddy pitchers. The tavern servers and barkeeps are attractive enough, in their little short shorts and tight tops. The beer goggles can make a 7 into a 10! If you want a fancy smancy date night, this is not for you. If you want a dance club, this is not for you. If you want fancy cocktails, this is not for you.

Rather, I'm just a girl from Western Massachusetts with a fondness for cheap beer and a deep seated hatred for pretension. Well get ready, because there are no pretenses at The Patriot. You will see at least 80% of the bartenders boobs. You will feel vaguely sticky by the time you leave. You will pay between 6 and 11 dollars for a pitcher of decent beer. You will appreciate the Johnny Cash/Credence rotation on a juke box. You will unabashedly get randomly completely trashed on a weeknight...OK, maybe that's just me.

Looking at the low reviews, I'd say people expected some cutesie bar dressed as dive, and got the glorious mid-american watering hole that is The Patriot instead.  Rather than enjoying the ridiculousness of this bar and having fun, they judge it for what it is not, a place with good food and where the bathroom doors lock (at least the guys doesn't).  This is a place to drink cheap beer, play pool, and get hammered.  I tend to arrive between 1-3 am, but i could see it as a solid place to start off the night too.  If you expect the staff to meet your every need or require overpriced drinks to satisfy your bougie appetites, go elsewhere.  If you want to drink a Budweiser and listen to rock and roll, go here.  Heads up: cash only.",1,1,

Fear not, weary traveler, that is the smell of freedom. The Patriot is a extremely divey, cowboy type bar in unsuspecting Tribeca. The Patriot Saloon, like the Patriot Act, is very polarizing. A lot of people will complain about the music selection (country,  Bruce Springsteen, CCR, and Tom Petty only) the scantily clad bartenders, and the lack of ""good cocktails"". If any of these things bother you, you're probably not a dive bar person anyway so this place is not for you.However... this is a great place to have a silly time with a group of people on a weekday. The drinks are cheap ($5 dollar PBR-well shot combo), the pool and darts are fun and the crowd is surprisingly diverse. The bartenders and servers are also very friendly. By far the best dive bar in the area.",2,,

I will report this because this is not acceptable nor tolerable it sends a bigoted and racist message that this bar seems to me caters to bogoted and racist accepting people, but for the love of God why must the public need to hear this insensitive music which must be removed immediately or I will make several phone calls....Its not only me, several folks of mine told me to go in and see for myself, sure enough they were correct, that racist music has too go, it only fuels unnecessary hatred and misunderstanding otherwise it would have been a pretty good bar to go too, I d8nt recommend  black hispanis people to go until those racist music is removed permanently, and I will call to complain that bigoted racist music is tolerated in this bar.....",,2,

155,chris s.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,4.0,1/16/2014,"Let me begin by saying I am an ""old"" PATRIOT fan from way back. Not of those New England sissies, of course, but of Tribeca's seediest dive bar, The Patriot, on Chambers St. The guy who owns the place, is clearly ""whack"" from the 60s - and it turns out that is at the core of what I have always liked about the place.  It's unconventional crazy - and just the right spot if you are in the mood for such a venue.  The atmosphere is dive, the bartenders are dive, the food is dive - the decor is pure garbage dive - everything is dive!  Even the smell (years of spilled beer) is dive!  The scantally-clad bartenders come and go through an ever-revolving door - but they have been pretty much cut from the same (smidgeon of) cloth for years.  It's all another affectation of their certifiably crazy boss.  They are generally engaging and pleasant (feigning or practicing the art of ""slut"") and entirely mercinary (responsive to reasonable tipping). But that's all good to any dive bar connoisseur worth his fat ass (upon which he prefers to sit - rather than stand).  And speaking of sitting, there is usually ample room to do so at the classic, beat-up, old bar..There are good nights and bad nights at the Patriot.  On a good night the music is loud and the atmosphere is charged with energy.  People of all ages sing along and dance (sometimes on the bar). Everyone is happy and drunk or on their way to being so. Mercifully - even on the bad nights when the bar is full of bore-ass, twenty-somethings, there is no crap on the jukebox through which you have to suffer. On occasion, a tasteless bartender (who has a headache from being up for five days straight on methamphetamines) will turn the volume down. One can only assume she would rather be listening to something familiar and soothing to her like Kanye or Justin Bieber - or whomever.But all that aside, it is a really great cheap drunk.  Beer is cheap. The hard liquor is cheap. The food (as it is) is cheap.  The bartenders are cheap.  The talk is cheap. You could easily hang out for an hour or two with a pitcher of beer and some sliders/fries, after having thrown $5 in the Jukebox (18 songs) - all for under $20! It's not a place you would normally bring a date - unless she is a prostitute, or she has been fully versed on what to expect in advance.  But hey - it isn't a place full of a lot of social expectations, so do what you want. Oh, on that note there are certain limitations. There is a big scary bouncer out front who will politely ask you to leave if you get too loud/obnoxious -  or if you threaten to kill everyone's generally good buzz in any way.  He too is pretty authentic ""dive bar.""Oh, and one final note. I read one Yelp comment about The Patriot being a ""Coyote Ugly"" wannabee.  Uh, you do realize that Coyote Ugly was a Hollywood creation/fabrication, right?  Where's the authenticity in that?",1,1,

That's when I noticed more than half of my beer was fill of foam.

167,Brian H.,"Brooklyn, NY",108,11,75,5.0,11/19/2012,"I had lost my native tongue somewhere between Chambers Street and Franklin...the sensors between salty and sour had leapt out of my mouth and run down Broadway shouting ghastly things.  Earlier in the night I had been sitting upstairs in the Patriot Saloon and wanting to say something along the lines of ""...all these tap beers taste like banana Runts,"" but while this was true what had actually come out was ""ANOTHER SHOT OF WILD TURKEY""...my face planted on the wood bar.  The waitress says ""$3.50"" and I know it's going to be a long night as I raise the glass and swig...the fucking fowl pecking at my esophagus.An old man was next to me crooning Johnny Cash which was coming in from the over head speaker...his eyes glazed over like fresh doughnuts and the waft of stale cigarettes coming off his flannel button down.  At this point in time (roughly two hours into my stay) I had become very right aware of the buzz about my head as I sifted through my wallet for a $5 dollar bill in which to purchase another pitcher of the only beer worthy of the blue ribbon.  I connected the feeling to lack of food but it would be a while before that was taken care of as the thought of eating one of their $1.50 cheeseburgers disgusted me more than the middle aged woman across the bar in pink velour tongue kissing the pug dog owned by the patron sitting next to her.  I had been to this bar before and was familiar with its bestial tendencies but the anxiety of a whoozy head coupled with nicotine sputters was almost too much to take at a sight like that so I headed to the stairs and made my way down for a smoke....a Willy Nelson tune and the shouts of recently laid off businessmen waiting for me when I got there.I stumble a bit on the way out and catch myself on the side window flower pots...a habitat for pre chewed gum and tobacco ash.  Placing my elbow on the end corner I hold myself up and try to light my cigarette...the end of February gusts blowing out my Bic torch.  My first slips of the tongue start to creep up my throat as I nod to the bouncer and announce ""I neeeed anotherrr burrrr""...the last few words coming out in thick syrupy slurs.  The next hour or so would be similar to this but with many more ""dudes"" and ""bros"" thrown in the mix as I mingled with the Tribeca circus...all gathered together in wonderful theatrical display.  I don't recall all the events of the night but I remember thinking ""if that taxidermied alligator comes off the ceiling, I'm tha fug outta hurrrr."" Last call comes swifter than expected and as the few patrons left order their last round, I pour myself off my stool and leave while listening to Toby Keith (""mmm mmm mmm I loooove this barrrrr"").  The world is spinning but I manage to hold my tongue down long enough to form the word ""TAXI!""  I slump in to the yellow carriage and between my double speak and his thick accent it's a wonder I ever got home.The next day approaches like a man on the brink of Alzheimer's...the full embarrassment of the not knowing mixed with flashes of remembrance...such as the dosey-doe I did with a head full of liquor in the downstairs bathroom that can't lock...people coming in...pausing...and judging.  And though I was able to speak again...a general sense of what-the-fuck happened would waft through the air for days to come.",6,10,5

Some of the reviews here seem to stem from Mr. and Mrs. Upper East Side who somehow wandered in here expecting haute cocktails while perusing a brunch menu. Listen, this place is like Mos Eisley. It's dingy, it's dirty, and it's exactly what it advertises to be. A friend and I used to hit this place up often after work and it never ceased to disappoint. What's that? It's 5:30pm, rush hour in Lower Manhattan, Tribeca yuppies shuffling up and down Chambers while inside this haven lies the owner taking a piss in the corner next to the juke box that seems to only play Waylon Jennings? Is that what I think it is? Yes, it's drunken day laborers bidding on the bartenders offer to show her tits, all while the other bartender is hands down the most drunk person in the entire bar? Awesome. Stick to the PBR in cans. The taps are ungodly gnarly. I've had a few pitchers of the ""Patriot Ale,"" along with the other fine selections of wife beating brew, and I strongly believe the draft lines all pull from the urinals both downstairs and upstairs. Want to feel like Pablo Escobar for telling your buddies that you've ""sat on a couple kilos of Blow?"" Then literally sit on a kilo of blow, caked on the toilet seat, while admiring the gorgeous nautically themed wallpaper that would adorn any sea captain's estate, or that of a rental in Montauk.The food is...well. It's made by some gremlin in the basement who utilizes a dumb-waiter to send up whatever he can scrape off the deep fryer. I once ordered the ""famous"" $1.25 burger and, while waiting for the A train twenty minutes later, went into Anaphylactic shock from some sort of allergy to something in that burger. I rode all the way back to Brooklyn looking as if I was attacked by a swarm of bees or gnawed on by a couple of rattlesnakes.

I hope I can find my way home,"" she said as she started heading away.Me: ""You'll be fine. Take care.""My girlfriend: ""Good luck"" she said in a friendly way, the way anyone speaks at bars.)The woman exploded into a tirade (where my girlfriend and I were speechless) and four minutes later the woman told me I was nice and then continued her ghetto tirade against my girlfriend.
