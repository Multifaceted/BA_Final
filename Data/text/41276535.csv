0,Alina M.,"San Jose, CA",33,18,8,5.0,8/11/2018,"Perfect rooftop bar!It's small, not overcrowded and cocktails were great!Try salmon and coconut mojito - delicious and not pricey. City view is amazing!",,,
1,Jimmy B.,"Vienna, VA",102,13,2,3.0,6/23/2018,"The bar is conveniently located inside our hotel, The Paul. Just to set the scene... It's Saturday night in NYC, Happy Hour, in the Summer, the weekend of The Gay Pride Festival. They bar was not prepared. Missing ingredients and could not make the first three cocktails we picked off THEIR SPECIALS MENU. Could not make guacamole off their apps menu. The drinks we did get were really good. We skipped the apps and decided to go elsewhere for food. Also, there is a roof top bar on 22 BUT no signs on how to get there, no staff up there, and no signs saying when it opens. The top floor is 23, btw and just for maintenance staff.",1,,
2,Namarazzi N.,"New Orleans, LA",4,52,73,4.0,7/12/2018,"Look, this is a cozy sized rooftop bar that is nicely decorated and has a clean bathroom in one place. You can get bar drinks and bar food here. There is an excellent view of the Empire State Building and other surrounding places. Victoria is a kind bartender and her drinks come out looking great. Its nice and not crowded up here. Good stuffs.",2,,
3,Hanna R.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,3,0,5.0,8/11/2018,Nice little bar on the rooftop of the Paul hotel. Both drinks and food were nice. Great place if you're looking for a quite place with a view.,,,
4,Eugene M.,"Glenview, IL",23,7,1,5.0,8/11/2018,"It's a nice rooftop bar on the corner of 29 and Broadway, with a beautiful city view and reasonable prices. Bartender Victoria was serving us delicious margaritas and tequila shots!",,,
5,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,1.0,11/14/2017,"While the ambiance is nice here, it is not worth the price for watered-down drinks. I watched the bartender make a whiskey & ginger ale and he literally measured out a SINGLE shot. I mean... what?? I've never seen a bartender skimp on alcohol that much. And the kicker: it cost $13!! I cannot believe what a scam that is. Seriously, save your money and go somewhere else where you can get a real drink. Don't pay $13 for juice or soda :P",3,1,1
6,Kathleen O.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,5/8/2018,"Used to really enjoy this place when the weather gets warm. Small, but comfortable rooftop bar with good happy hour specials in a convenient location. I went yesterday and asked the bartender what the happy hours specials were for and he gave me a very rude response. ""The happy hour is downstairs. This is a rooftop bar."" Apparently, being on a rooftop makes them incapable of offering the happy hour that they had offered previously and continue to advertise on the signage outside. Maybe would have stayed if the regular prices weren't outrageous ($10+ for house wine and $8 for a budd light) and the service wasn't so rude. Found another rooftop bar in the same neighborhood not afflicted with the same inability to discount drinks on a Monday afternoon.",,,
7,Morgan S.,"Passaic, NJ",16,24,2,5.0,8/30/2017,"Rooftop Bar. That is all you need to know. The food and drinks are amazing, dont get me wrong but the rooftop bar faces the empire state building and the view is just magnificent.",,,
8,Zac B.,"New York, NY",139,4,0,1.0,2/23/2017,Expensive as a three star spot ($8 bud light bottle) but marked as one dollar sign. Other than that just a basic hotel bar.,2,,
9,Ana D.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",0,22,0,1.0,9/25/2017,"This is the most over priced bar in the city.  The drinks were terrible, sugar water with no alcohol.  The staff had no personality and little ability to mix.  Not recommended other than the views!!",1,,
10,Kayla G.,"San Jose, CA",46,10,31,5.0,11/10/2016,I had a great time during happy hour! It lasts until 8. I had wine but I heard from other customers the mojito and martini are great. Def recommend this spot.,,,
