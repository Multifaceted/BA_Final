Bottom line its a must go to visit and revisit.  Apparently they serve food which I've never tried, however it is on my list for the summer.   Job well dome Duplex :-)",,,
1,Hunter F.,"New York, NY",98,8,6,1.0,10/27/2018,"Be careful with this place. It's one of those traps where they force you to pay for expensive drinks when you go support your friends in shows there. They don't even have options for people that don't drink. No tea coffee, iced tea, not even milk. Best choice is a bottle of water for 5.50 + 20% forced gratuity.Edit and addition: My review is NOT incorrect. If you can't take criticism you'll deserve what you get. Which in this case is a poor review.",1,,

Updated review","Not what it once wasThere was a time where this bar was fun, lively and staffed with people that truly careTo the owner-Your responses to yelp reviewers are often nasty and unfriendlyTry listening rather than continually bashing what people writeLast evening a few of us stopped inThe door staff were rude, cocktail waitress not friendly at all and the overall vibe was not funSad reallyWe've been regulars for years and unfortunately rarely go anymoreThe longtime staff are gone and the vibe is offToo bad really",,,
3,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,3.0,8/7/2018,"The piano bar is always where I randomly end up before I go somewhere. This isn't my final destination, more so because they cater to a certain population of people. These people are always in here enjoying the music but I find it sometimes cheesy and charging $5 for a Poland springs water is ludacris. I definitely feel like a minority when I'm here.Also they aren't happy if you come and do not partake in imbibing. The minimum drink limit for the seats is two. They make sure you know without a beat that this is the case. You'd better not order at the bar if you're sitting in those seats...Anyway I'll probably continue to end up here begrudgingly...",1,,1
4,Jennifer D.,"New York, NY",32,1,0,5.0,10/12/2018,"There is nothing better than this piano bar. The staff is amazing. One of the best places to go out any night of the week. If the two drink minimum bothers people, it shouldn't - you'll have so much fun you'll stay for more than two. As a straight woman, there isn't a more positive place to go and just have fun.",1,,
5,Mark K.,"Milton, MA",2,1,0,5.0,10/15/2018,"It's been a little over 3 years since I started coming down to New York on a monthly (or better) basis and since I've made the Duplex a regular part of those trips. I've found the piano staff unfailingly talented and the wait staff consistently courteous as well as talented in their own right.  As a straight man I have felt as welcomed there as anyone regardless of gender orientation, race or national origin who walks through the door with an open mind and an open heart.  Their intermittent charity cabaret series, The Duplex Gives Back, has genuinely provided some of my favorite times in the city.  The Duplex has very much become \like a second home and my ""happy place."" When i ask myself what I want to do on a given evening in New York, the Duplex usually wins eventually.  (All this after nearly nuking their sound system many years ago on my first visit but that's a whole other story).",,,
6,Derrick M.,"Indianapolis, IN",7,37,4,5.0,4/29/2018,"Recommended by friends who live a few blocks away and couldn't have had more fun on a Sunday (or any night).  We were welcomed and treated wonderfully by staff to a music extravaganza!  The drinks are more $$ than I'm used to (outside of NYC) but I would come here every night if I lived here.  The talent of the waitress, bartender, and pianist/singer was outstanding and they accommodated everyone's musical taste in the most crowd-pleasing, best ways possible. I CANNOT WAIT to come visit our friends again and go back.  I understand not every visit to any restaurant or bar will be perfect and reading some of the other reviews, I hope you keep that in mind.  We didn't even get in on Saturday night due to overcrowding - Sunday night was perfect and we were treated like we belonged, even as visitors to the area.  We also saw them handle very intoxicated people with class.   One of the most fun experiences I've had in my life!",3,,1

9,Celeste A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",313,53,4,2.0,5/21/2018,"We were out celebrating a graduation so in between plans we wanted to grab a few drinks. There were only 3 of us. We sat outside at a relatively unoccupied patio at Duplex. We were told about a 2 drink minimum per person. This was a fine concept but it turns out this policy practically ruins the vibe of this venue. First, our service was utterly slow. Then, our drinks were tasteless and plain. Then we didn't get the water we asked for until we got our bill.Then, there was a 20% gratuity already applied without any warning (either on the menu or elsewhere). This explains the poor service. You didn't deserve that tip, guy. As one sever to another, get it together. Bonus was that the door guy was really friendly, and the bathroom was moderately clean.",1,,

12,Joshua D.,"New York, NY",566,24,4,1.0,5/17/2018,"My husband was assaulted here a few weeks back.  It took the owner(s) over 3 weeks to get back to us, and even with video proof of their employee, Armando, touching my husband inappropriately and yelling at us, they refuse to fire him. Armando even threatened to cancel a performer's show when our confrontation had nothing to do with the performer themselves.  NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE!  THERE ARE BETTER CABARET SPACES TO PERFORM AT!  The Duplex used to be one of my favorite places to grab a drink and catch up with friends, but now I can't ever go back there because the owners don't take assault charges seriously enough.UPDATE BASED ON COMMENTS BELOW:My accusations of assault are actually NOT inaccurate.  Armando touched my husband inappropriately to try and get him to go sit back in his seat.  That's called ASSAULT.  And no, my husband did NOT call Armando an a**hole--I DID.  AFTER HE ASSAULTED MY HUSBAND!  As you say, you even have video of Armando touching my husband and you STILL refuse to let him go.  And no, I did not ""demand to film the performance from a space that is prohibited.""  First off, the space I wanted to film in, I've filmed from there before.  Secondly, Armando REFUSED to even talk to me about filming, hence why I got upset in the first place and why my husband was trying to talk to me from the back of the house.  All of this occurred BEFORE Armando assaulted my husband and then BEFORE I called him an a**hole (and rightfully so.)  Armando then got inches from our faces and ABUSED his power by threatening to cancel the performer's show when our confrontation had NOTHING to do with the performer in the first place.  The manager, Stephen, was on MY SIDE of the situation and told me in person that this type of occurrence happens with Armando ALL THE TIME.  So although no one's asking you to fire someone based on a Yelp review, you would think that emails of the occurrence and video surveillance of your employee touching my husband inappropriately would be MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE to fire someone.  But for this establishment, apparently not.  We did not go to the authorities at first because we thought The Duplex would do the right thing and take our accusations seriously, especially with video footage.  But I'm starting to think the reason The Duplex took so long to respond to our claims was to PREVENT us from going to the authorities.  Here's hoping the social media world will know how poorly this establishment is run as we now search for representation.We also hope Yelp does the right thing by reaching out to us.  I'd be happy to provide the emails in which The Duplex ADMITS to seeing Armando touch my husband inappropriately, but not ""inappropriately enough"" for them to fire Armando.  They would rather their patrons ""not return to their establishment.""",,,
13,Kate J.,"New York, NY",425,427,234,3.0,7/20/2018,"Went on a Friday night around 11pm and it was pretty crowded, sort of impossible to sit down or interact with anyone. The upstairs lounge was nicer though, and the pianist was pretty good. I wish there was more space in here because that would've made the experience much more enjoyable, but we ended up going to the Stonewall nextdoor instead.",1,,
14,Lee W.,"Manhattan, NY",9,35,0,3.0,10/6/2018,"I have mixed feelings about the bar,  ground floor bar is fun with the piano and singers but the staff are VERY pushy about the level of tips. I usually tip $1 for a beer and maybe $2 per mixed drink. If you take a table they push you to open a tab with a credit card and then say they expect 20% because they do table service. The bar staff often sing and they pass around the collection for the piano player. Upstairs is another bar that is much more relaxed place to drink, there is also a performance space where they do shows. The bar is very often packed out at weekends but I am out off the main bar by the level of tip pushy attitudes all round. I usually have a couple of beers upstairs these days.",,,
15,Anh N.,"Aurora, CO",125,68,77,4.0,8/13/2017,"I had such a great time here! I'm not from New York, so this place was completely a new experience. It was so lively and fun! Technically it's free to listen to the pianist and singers, but they strongly advise you to tip them. Also you should order a drink or two of you plan on staying long -- just common courtesy.The way it worked when I went was there were about 3 servers, and one pianist. Two of the servers came up to the stage to sing. The servers earn their own tip from waiting tables, or from getting song requests. The pianist earned his tips from people throwing cash into a plastic top hat that was occasionally passed around the room.You can request songs for the pianist to sing, or you can get up on stage yourself to sing! Either way, you write the song on a napkin and slide it onto the piano to the pianist. I had written a request for one of the servers to sing and put the cash right on the napkin. Unfortunately the servers were very busy, so I never got the chance to hear him sing... So that was a let down but I understand it was a busy night. Overall it was such a great time to hear people sing, and to sing along altogether! Definitely want to come back in the future!",,,1

HOWEVER the last time we went I was charged $13.50 for a Cosmo which was served in a small glass AND not even a full pour. Did I mention this was during Happy Hour? What ever happened to pouring the remaining cocktail left in the shaker into the customers glass instead of dumping it out in the sink? You do not serve a cocktail 3/4 full and charge $13.50,,,

20,Lindsey E.,"Atlanta, GA",165,338,199,4.0,10/20/2017,"Two out-of- towners wandered into The Duplex late one August evening. They were weary from walking and in need of some entertainment and stiff drinks. They knew they had come to the right place when they walked upon the doorman engaging a stately woman, dressed for the night in skirted spandex and size 11ish heels. ""Downstairs is the piano bar, upstairs you get me"", she said through a smokey exhale of what I fantasized was a Virginia Slim, but was more than likely a Marlboro light. Without hesitation, the two travelers made their way upstairs. They passed a bustling piano bar on the left, but they already had their sights set on the upstairs entertainment. They made their way to the bar and were promptly greeted by a theatrical bartender. He danced from one customer to the next and didn't miss a beat. He served the couple with a heavy hand and they made their way to the last available seat to settle in for the show. The air was heavy with anticipation and a small crowd began to form. A young couple at the bar ordered a second.. or maybe third round and then, she appeared! The glitzy gal from outside burst onto the stage and immediately demanded our attention with a comical account of the night before. She was working through a day long hangover, you see, and she nursed it with tequila shot after tequila shot throughout her performance. I think I fell in love a little bit. The performance turned from comedy act to lead vocalist about the same time as her skirted spandex became skirt-less. With one fell swoop the skirt and an another tequila shot were gone. It pains me that I cannot remember her name but she embodied the best that night- Celine Dion, Madonna, Adele, Whitney Houston- never missing a beat. Yes, this was a night to remember for two weary travelers. We left The Duplex feeling like we had found our NY neighborhood bar- a place that welcomed us and everybody else with open arms and proper pours. We will find our way back here one day and hope that when we do, the lovely lady that made our night will be center stage.",2,3,3

24,John D.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,0,1.0,8/26/2018,"Some places in NY have the attitude that they can treat their customers badly and it doesn't matter because a new group of tourists arrives everyday and will replace them. Over MANY experiences I have found The Duplex to be one of these places. They are all about the $$$. Once on a slow night I was berated for not drinking/spending enough (on microphone to everyone hostess told me I needed to order more drinks...I walked out).Tonight I tipped the waiter and later discovered he already charged me a ""mandatory"" gratuity...thus he got a double tip. I have no issues with passing the hat, I get it. But tired of the rude staff who lets me know as a customer I am replaceable.",1,,
25,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,2.0,2/23/2017,"In an impetuous night of bar hopping, we ended up at this dirty gay dive bar in the hub of old West Village gay nightlife.   The front reminds me of the cheap kinda junky 70s rentals in my college town, Austin.   This attitude of ignorant bliss will serve you well here. The downstairs bar was almost full, but we were able to get some table seats and watch a campy piano sing along.   The vibe was cheery, bright and gay. The bar stock seemed limited, small and maybe with a 1986 item profile - with flavored vodkas featured and no real wide selection beyond the basics.  Expect tanqueray and absolut, but not Whistlepig,  or an amaro.The place feels dirty, if sticky, but you'll feel like you walked into the set of Glee rehearsal, and everyone is contagiously smiling. Piano sing alongs seem to be the thing here, and the upstairs bar might offer other features, but I was probably too drunk to walk up the stairs. The place feels a little dilapidated.  There's a outside patio seating area that gets full early during happy hour.Drinks hovered around $10.I left happier, almost like after a night of camping.  Ready to go home and take a shower.Star report Atmosphere - happy seedy.

28,Gabie M.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",244,1,0,1.0,10/18/2018,"Music was fun. I've never felt more unwelcome in an establishment as a paying customer. We sat down at a table after buying drinks and the waiter immediately approached us asking if we planned on buying more drinks. Happy with our recent purchase, we told him we were fine for the time being. He told us that tables are reserved for people who asked the bouncer; however, this seemed made up on the spot. He was looking for customers who were ready to buy rounds of drinks and make him profits off tip $$. We watched as he asked multiple groups of people if they wanted our seats and told us that we should be ready to move at any moment. Keep in mind that we had full drinks in hand purchased 5 minutes prior at the bar. He finally found a group that seemed drunk and surprised that he was offering them a table. They accepted and he immediately asked us to move to sit at the corner of the crowded bar. Horrible customer service. I've never seen such transparent behavior. This place only cares about money and tips. Do not go here. You're better off torrenting Cabaret as you down a bottle of wine.",,,

Came here for a show at the cabaret space upstairs and they were very organized and on top of things. I like how they take both drink orders when you first arrive so as not to disrupt the performers. My only complaint is that they take *forever* to get change back to you at the end of the night. Either pay by credit card or bring small bills if you need to book it right after a show.,1,,

There was a particularly short, mousy looking bartender with  bleach blonde hair who threatened to kick us out if we didn't buy a drink. Once we did, she was still condescending as ever when we asked how the piano singing worked. This place was cramped and the bartenders kept pushing those who didn't have seats back, (and unfortunately, they hadn't pushed any deodorant on that day) To top it all off, the piano player made fun of my friend as she was signing a song ( as if his leathery seal barking was anything to write home about).

I have gotten better service at McDonald's and better attitude from the hobo screaming down the street.  I think any respectable person can skip this place in New York and support businesses elsewhere that actually still retain basic human values. I would rather feed rats on the streets because they are more worthy of my money. This is how lowly I think of this establishment. If Yelp would allow negative stars.....We walked in to what seemed like a cool hip live music venue, proceeded to go to the bar to order a drink and chill for a while because the atmosphere and ambiance seemed like a good idea at the time. Could I have been any more wrong? I shall, word for word, recount my experience: Bartender: ""What can I get for you guys?"" Friend: ""Umm how much are the drinks?""Bartender: ""Don't ask that question. Come on, we're all adults here."" Friend: ""What? I'm not even allowed to ask what the price of the drinks are?""Bartender: ""If you can't afford it, don't come out""Wow. My friend at this time was speechless, as was I. Who was he to judge if we are ""adults"" and on what basis??? So he automatically assumes we cannot afford the drinks if we ask what the price is? I don't think I have seen this much attitude from a bartender in any place, gay/straight/lesbian/trans in my history in New York. Certainly not anyone that should have a job in the service industry, that's for sure. I think he would have a better time screaming at people as the hobo down the street for a living. We moved upstairs and decided to go to the bar there and order instead. My friend was still very angry and could not believe what just happened. The bartender upstairs asked what happened, without really listening and called the manager. The manager came to speak to us, and what I thought was an attempt to rectify the situation obviously was not the case. ""The bartenders will not serve you, so you will have to leave. You cannot 'hangout' here without buying drinks and they will not serve you. Please go."" WHAT? I was at this time infuriated. When we moved to the bar upstairs, we were never even attempted to be served anything (at this time we were a group of around 6-7). I have never in my life been the victim of such discrimination and disrespect, let alone pure insolence from someone who wasn't even serving me.This is New York City with many other live music venues, do yourself a favor and stay far away from this disgrace of a place.",17,13,4

I brought it inside but was frantically told it ""doesn't count"" towards the two-drink minimum for the event. I felt a bit hustled here. I ordered two drinks so he would go away and I could watch the show in peace.After the show, I would have stayed for a beer, but their force feeding me drinks during the show left a bad taste in my mouth.

We ordered Vodka Redbulls and while they used Tito's vodka, they used some vanilla soda from the tap and didn't inform us that they were out of redbull and substituting with something else. The cocktail was not something I would drink even if it were free and my friends all felt the same way. While this was just one event, we all left disappointed and hope that the management makes sure that the bartenders at least inform customers when they don't have the correct ingredients and improvise.",1,,

Updated review","The Duplex used to be one of the best places to go on a Friday or Saturday night. Gay, straight, old, young...it didn't matter. Everyone was welcome, and everyone had a great time. It was the piano bar to beat all piano bars!Women could go in there for an evening, feel comfortable & not worry about getting hit on by drunk & obnoxious patrons.You met the people around you & joined in the communal experience of live music.I've enjoyed short & long evenings in there with famous, infamous & not-so-famous people.I've had nothing to drink & too much to drinkI've watched as Broadway singers debuted songs & as other patrons worked up the courage to sing with a live pianist. I've seen amazing talent & those who truly believed they had amazing talent (but didn't).All the while drinks were good & plentiful.I have nearly 10 years of incredible memories of weekends at the Duplex.Well, times have changed, and it seems the management would rather court drunk millennials who screech along to the piano, the pianist & the singers (both the staff & the patrons), as if it were live karaoke & not a piano bar.The ever-changing parade of bouncers outside are rude & arbitrary, which starts the night on a negative note.Once in, if you're lucky enough to get into the downstairs piano bar, you need to find a place where you won't be assaulted by the vocal stylings of drunkards screaming lyrics off-key at the tops of their lungs. (Don't get me wrong, I'm not against sing-a-longs, but respect for those playing & singing & enjoying the music is crucial to the success of a bar like this.)The talented waitstaff used to do regular sets, which is apparently no longer allowed (or encouraged). The floor used to be incredibly clean for a crowded bar, now it is a sticky, trash-filled mess...and now I'm told that Maria, the heart & soul of the Duplex, will no longer be working Friday & Saturday nights? Maria, who has an incredible voice, warm spirit, can sell ice to Eskimos, calm a belligerent drunk & made the most amazing drinks, is no longer the weekend anchor? There is no logical reason for management to remove her (aside from jealousy & a desire to attract a young, drunk, obnoxious crowd).There are so few places in NYC where you can enjoy live music on the weekend without having booked a table & bought tickets in advance. The Duplex was the go-to choice for that.No longer. My concern is for the staff, who will suffer as tips plummet as millennials don't tip as well as more established & wealthy patrons.Unfortunately for New Yorkers, the Duplex is over.We can only hope that management sees the error of their ways & returns the Duplex to its profitable (& enjoyable) past.",1,,1
58,Ashwini M.,"Davis, CA",0,1,0,5.0,9/11/2017,"I love this bar! The piano bar is so fun, and the drag shows upstairs are incredible. The space is small which means you get to hang out with the performers, it is the best. Highly recommend!",1,,
59,B H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1,5.0,11/18/2017,"I often end up at the duplex unplanned.  While it never seems to be the the intended destination for the night, it is always the most fun.  I have been there several times after evening meetings and always seem to be the only guy in a suit on a Friday night.  I get ribbed for it, but always in good fun and friendly spirits. The staff is great.  Adam, behind the bar, always provides enough shock value to crack you up when you don't expect it... even when you know his shtick!  He's a genuinely nice guy though.  I miss Maria Gentile on the floor, but love Tina.  You just don't expect a waitress to be that sweet in a gritty piano bar... a beautiful person inside and out.  But as the song says... it's always the piano man I come to see.  The music is great.  Michael Issacs is my favorite.  From his hyper-ethical insistence on returning  your tip if he doesn't know your song to his political commentary, he's a lot of fun.  I tend to scream about Neil Diamond and John Denver... throwing in Walking in Memphis.  While he plays to the crowd, like any good artist, it's aways his show no matter how much you tip.  Respect.  It's a place where you can relax and have fun.  It definitely has a gay vibe, but you never feel out of place as a straight guy.  The drinks are good and inexpensive.  The vibe is upbeat.  The staff is great.  Even, Tony the owner gets up and sings Neil Diamond from time to time... what more could you ask for!",,,

The bar is two levels, first floor has the piano bar and the second floor has another bar that sometimes houses shows (and also has the bathrooms.) The piano bar is absolutely so much fun. The pianists we have seen are all talented and know about any song you throw at them. If you are going to sing, be prepared to know the whole song (this aint karaoke so dont expect the lyrics provided for you.) The only tip Id give you is to keep an eye on what you're ordering.The drinks here will add up quickly while you're having fun (Titos Vodka Soda ~10$ and beer on tap ~8-9$.) Last time we were a group of 5 and gratuity was automatically included. The staff is fabulous and will sing songs during the piano show. Also! Bring cash to tip the amazing pianist that day. Def recommend for a fun time!",2,1,1

65,Salvador G.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,5,2,1.0,11/2/2016,"Fun atmosphere when they decide to be nice to you.

66,Luke T.,"Croydon, United Kingdom",3,9,0,5.0,1/6/2016,"Came to NYC from London especially for my fiancé's 30th and he wanted to explore the scene whilst we were here. After two false starts we stumbled across this place purely by accident and we weren't disappointed.Bar tender Adam was the first that evening who didn't look at us like aliens because we weren't clued up on the American bar language. And still not sure what the phrase ""Well drink"" means or came from, but hey. Adam even gave my fiancé a birthday shot too. Nice touch. And I'm sure there was more vodka in that drink than coke. At the time there was just a handful of people in the bar and it being happy hour drinks were coming in at just $5 each, which was a bargain compared to the first place we were at ($15 a time). Strangely it was quite quiet, there was just a handful of people and we put this down to it being a Tuesday evening... Although even back home Happy Hour offers tend to be well patronised. Still it was nice to be able to have a conversation and relax.Once the piano got going the place filled up and the atmosphere changed. By that point we were over the need to converse and were very much in to the lively cabaret style act. Although I suspect we stuck out a bit as we were referred to as the ""Sexy Brits"" at the bar... If only I was sexy these days! Guess it was a nice attempt though! Very entertaining and the banter between pianist and bar staff was epic.Couldn't stay too late as we were still reeling a bit with jet lag - Had to call it quits around 11pm as our eyelids started to fail us - it is 4am back in the UK after all. But certainly didn't leave because of the atmosphere and could have stuck it out much more if we were awake enough!Little gem of a place - Well worth a visit if you're passing.",2,2,1
67,Robert R.,"Queens, NY",0,2,0,5.0,5/1/2017,"The Duplex is my FAVORITE place in the city. Nowhere else has the history, the talent, and the sense of humor that this place does, while maintaining a neighborhood-hang vibe. It has become a home-away-from-home for some of my friends, but you don't have to be a regular to feel welcome. For an extra treat, be sure to stop by when Henry is playing. All of the pianists are fairly adept at requests but Henry is so game (and gifted) and likeable that it is almost MORE fun when someone requests a song that has no business being played in a piano bar. The whole crowd gets united in seeing just how he'll pull it off and it makes for the most fun night. See you there soon!",,,
68,Pelin C.,"New York, NY",20,121,88,2.0,3/5/2016,"It is surprising how this place has 4 stars. Last night my boyfriend and I trusted the reviews and decided to check this place out. The place is smaller than a smallest bar. The bathroom line was 15 people at least and the whole place smelled like bleech. Then we realized there was a ""secret"" door to the other part of the place which was packed and had no place to sit, we still decided to check it out and was standing and watching the show. We found the show very boring it was basically some lip syncing and was $15 per person to stand in an extremely hot and small room.

The atmosphere is awesome and Darius leads the night by engaging the crowd and keeping the music coming with a wide variety of styles and genres, from smooth R&B to Broadway to rock and pop.

Like 'bearded clam'. Look it up. - I love gay bars because there a lot of good looking men that don't care to talk to me.. which is grrrreat!!! It's a little grungy in here, but you know what?

Their special for the night was that you pay for a double drink and get a triple. So they give you a big glass and put three shots in.

The owner allowed far, far too many people to buy entry. They had the doors open along Christopher street with space for patrons who wanted to get a close view of the parade. Drinks were not allowed outside, so after we finished our fist we decided to take a peek and then wanted to come back in. When we tried we were told to get in line, they had reached capacity inside. There was no easy way to exit since we were in the outside space they had prepared for people at Duplex. We also could not get back inside to buy drinks or meet up with our friends. It took 45 minutes waiting under the hot sun to get back in. The owner seemed to have decided to sell as many possible wristbands as he could regardless of what he could accommodate. Completely unsafe. I asked to speak to the manager. The owner was there and was completely dismissive. He could have cared less. His primary purpose was to collect as much money as possible. We could have stood along the sidewalk for free. We paid so we could be inside somewhere. If you're going to sell entry, that should be possible for whoever has paid.

One of the most memorable cabaret experiences of my life. BUT: Please note that when you go to a cabaret there and are not a ""guest,"" you will be given far lower priority than the people getting comped or friends of the performers.

The staff was fine and the space was cozy - a bit too cozy though when all seats were filled.As several reviewers below have stated, they try to trick you into paying two tips which I think is pretty shady. The bill includes gratuity in every check and then leaves space for you to add a tip. I understand it's ultimately up to the customer to read the check thoroughly, but when I order two glasses of house wine, I'm not expecting a tip to be included and easily could have missed this and paid a total of $7 for tip alone.

The performer tried doing comedy and was disrespectful to republicans. The comedy portion was not funny at all. I was ready to walk out midway through the show. I guess that's what you get for going to a $15 show. (Although to be fair there's a 2 drink minimum per person so it does come out to a lot more).

With the rise of the new shiny bars in midtown, I like this place.  Not a stand-and-pose kinda of place, but a good grab-a-drink-with-friends place.",,,

OK, we were told they had 3 beers on tap and we ordered a couple. When we asked for a check later on, the waiter told us that our check was $19.50. It's a strange number for 2 beers so I went inside and asked how much the beers were. They were $7.50 each, I was told. When our waiter returned I confronted him about the beer prices and our ""bill"" not adding up. He explained that there was tax added. I told him that the tax in NYC is 8.875% so our bill still doesn't make sense. Finally, he offered to bring us a printed bill. Dropped it off and never returned. The bill had 2 beers, tax and 20% ""suggested"" gratuity, which added up to $19.50. Now, telling someone that their beers cost $19.50 strongly suggests that the tip and tax are not included and is a total scam and disgusting practice. Gross! Not coming back.",6,,

From drag shows to cabaret and stand up, it's all there and up to you to choose from. I've been going there for years and have seen mostly cabaret shows. The stage area is nice and since the place is long, anywhere you sit you'll see the show. The place is conveniently located near the path and subway stations and is easy to find and very well known in the neighborhood, if you get lost, just ask.The wait staff is usually magical and works throughout the shows and will bring you your two drinks minimum or more as you order. They do not serve food during the shows and that is a problem as 2 drinks without food can get people fall from their stools. But the shows are on average 60 minutes or less so you should survive. Be aware that you must climb steps and there is no elevator, so if you are in a wheelchair or with crutches, good luck. Since at times they are three shows the same evening, and the place is tiny, the audience arrives on time and leaves on time as well. This is a business not a place to chill after the show.

While I was disappointed that I couldn't order any food, I was very happy with the quality of their drinks.I had one friend who was arriving late, so I texted him that he wouldn't be able to get in unless he gave them the code word BIG BANANA. With this, I wrote that on a napkin and gave it to the guy who I thought was taking tickets for the show, explaining the situation. He agreed that my friend could only get in if he gave the password and took the napkin for reference. I then proceeded past him to my table to find a toilet and sink, realizing that I had just given that whole spiel to the bathroom attendant!So the drinks are good and the people are cool. Then, there's the entertainment.I was blown away by how good the N.W.A. show was. I expected that at $10 per ticket it was going to be less-than-funny, but all 5 comedians were incredible. I actually fell out of my chair I was laughing so hard, and I was exhausted by the time the show as over.

I will say going into my night, as I was told we would head to this place, I was a bit reluctant, because as others put it, it's possibly not one of the best bars due that it's so weird in color and decor and the crowd is never really defined, wheat her gay or straight or drag or goth... Just such a weird space, that happens a to do very well because on the other hand, it's always packed.I have been here, so I can say this, no matter how packed it is, you can always make your self to the bar and get a drink. I was lucky to have met such a great bartender... I think her name was Alisson and she prepared me a very amazing margarita. Now, I do wish they had a bigger selection of tequila, but as long as I am not stuck with Patrón, I was cool. so I got Hornitos tequila. not my favorite, but far better than Patrón. I can't speak to the price. I thought it was pretty fair for a my drink.The singers are not from broadway people. But they are entertainers for everyone there. Drop a dollar or two, it's always refreshing to get live entertainment, even if sometimes your ear screeches a bit. It's still pretty darn entertaining and helps to create conversation and share your opinions when there is nothing else to talk about. I don't care how open minded, gay or low key you are... this is not a dating place. This is a place for hanging with friends or your partner if bored and want to do something different.

Watch and listen as the waiters and waitresses sing their hearts out for the crowd.  It's raw, real singing, with little more than a piano for backup.  We've been going for years and almost the same waiters/performers have been there the entire time.If you're thinking this sounds like the touristy Ellen's Stardust Diner in midtown, you're wrong - completely different atmosphere, so much more real New York, (and not particularly family-friendly).I was once here with about 15 other people for a friend's birthday party.  I have no idea how we managed to find enough tables and chairs together, but we managed to pull it off.Warning:  The humor is adults-only and can be raunchy at times.  Don't go if you're easily offended.",1,,1

Originally, we were going to start here and hop somewhere else after, but we ended up staying for HOURS and ended the night here. -Both the patrons and the bartenders were beyond friendly. The crowd was a little older (we're 24-26), but didn't make us feel ostracized or that we didn't belong.-The drinks were fantastic. They had a special of the day - made with a fresh batch of real pineapples - that was freakin' delicious and that we couldn't stop ordering-The downstairs is for the real show - a lot of INCREDIBLE singing (by the bartenders!!!) and hilarious banter (between pianist and the bartenders, between them and the crowd, etc.) And yes, drunken singing from the crowd, especially the later (and drunker) everyone gets ;P-The upstairs is much more chill, and has some nice window seats that overlook the streets/square outside - good for people watching. This part reminded me a little bit of the Lookout back in SF.All in all, a great space for catching up with friends, some friendly banter with other drunken folks, wonderful music - perfect when you're looking for a non-dancing night out!!",3,,1

148,Josh H.,"Arlington, TX",54,108,4,4.0,8/4/2013,"This is one of my favorite bars in NY..but I may be a bit biased since I used to work there when I was a resident of the ""Isle of Joy"".  A fun, piano bar/cabaret venue where you can drink, be merry and sing a show tune or two if you like.  It's basically a live broadway karaoke bar and it's a blast.  If you aren't into the live music, the upstairs bar is a more club atmosphere with regular top 40 music and music videos going playing on a large screen.  The atmosphere is fun and on my recent trip to NY, it was great to revisit my old stomping ground and see old friends.  The Duplex is also located literally 2 doors down from the infamous Stonewalls, where the gay rights movement really took flight in the city in 1969 when a group of gay men and women took a stand against the local police force.  The owners of the Duplex also own the Stonewall, so there is a lot of history going back and forth between the two bars.All in all, this is a great place to have a good time and meet some very fun and interesting people. All the pianists are very talented and very accommodating to the drunken demands of a group of guys wanting to burst out in song and sing ""It's Raining Men"".  :)",1,,

Generally , the staff has always been friendly and the place , unpretentious and chill. Last night was a completely different experience. Met a friend there around 5:30pm. We were having drinks , poured by a very nice bartender , enjoying our time. Shortly before 7 that all ended,  when this so called ""comedian"" was given a microphone to apparently berate the audience with. This guy was not funny , he was nothing but a misogynist who was given a platform to insult two paying customers. We decided to  leave after a few minutes of being repeatedly insulted. I now would strongly suggest avoiding this place. There are plenty of other great establishments in the area (Cubby Hole, Bar 55) that know how to decipher between talent verses tirade. I would suggest spending your money in those places. Otherwise know that when you walk into the Duplex for a simple drink, you may just be attacked by an angry man who clearly never got very far with his life's aspirations of being anything other than a lowly barfly.",3,,

There had been an umbrella massacre in the city because of the monsoon since we'd been at the theatre, so I'm glad we wound up @ The Duplex for more music & laughter to soothe my soul and keep my high on life going. My parents had been here years and years before and were worried it wouldn't be the same, but they were delighted to find that the pianist/singer Gerry is still there.  We scored a seat and enjoyed the music & singalongs the rest of the night. We made friends with the people on either side of us (the nicest people btw - surprisingly for nyc - im not hating.. it's just fact). My mom, social butterfly that she is (and perhaps a little tipsy), had everyone swaying to a song and doing spirit fingers -- it was hilarious.

She was the main reason we came to the Duplex several times a month on Friday and Saturday for the past 16+ years. I'm afraid the owner has made a mistake and taken away one of the real gems that the Duplex had to offer. Personnel changes at a place as intimate as the Duplex have devastating effects on the overall atmosphere. We will need to reevaluate our loyalty to an establishment that appears to value its employee's loyalty, skill, and hard work so little. I'm sure newcomers and tourists won't notice anything different, but regulars will.ORIGINAL:  It's not for nothing that those of us who go to the Duplex several times a month refer to the Duplex as ""the happiest place on earth.""  We patronize the piano bar downstairs the majority of the time.  The staff is excellent and committed to making sure everyone has the best time.  Maria, Gerry, Adam, Michael, Will, Dan and all the rest will see that it's an evening you won't forget.  The drinks are excellent and fairly priced.  The crowd is very mixed and everyone is friendly.  We've met so many friends there - friends for the evening and friends for years.  Sure it's a gay bar but everyone is welcome as long as you aren't obnoxious (and you know who you are).Every night is different, but the process is the same - come and hear great singers, songwriters and amateurs have a turn in the ""glory that is the spotlight at the Duplex.""  The music is a excellent mix of old and new, Broadway, Motown, and pop.  You won't be sorry.  We've be going for 15 years and it never fails to make me joyful for having been there.And it you get really wasted, they will hold back your hair.",1,1,

We started and ended our night with the wonderful staff.  The bartenders and cocktail servers were all wonderful, nice, and eager to make you feel right at home upstairs or downstairs.  The pianist was superb!  His voice and key skills made our entire group very happy.  We were lucky enough to be there on a night when 2 other guests were having birthday celebrations as well.  Not to mention they take requests and if you have the guts to get up and sing yourself, they just may let you! ;-)",,,1

194,Pamela B.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,400,3,3.0,1/30/2013,"I never would have thought I'd end up in a place like this seven years after moving to NYC--it's like the place you go to seven days after you arrive, and then never again. I arrived on a quiet weeknight and was very pleased to see the place lightly populated with regulars and a friendly bartender...singing along to the Glee soundtrack. Because, please: stereotypes have to start somewhere. The bartender graciously obliged my request for a hot toddy by tracking down a tea kettle--because that is how to responsibly treat a cold--but then he charged me $10.50 for it! Is this what passes for normal drink prices in the West Village? Ugh, I am a huge curmudgeon these days. You young whippersnapper can have these downtown bars. I'll be slurping down my discounted drinks in Brokelyn.",1,2,1
195,Nikki S.,"Manhattan, NY",114,35,2,4.0,6/28/2011,"On Sunday nights, Brian sings and plays piano.  He takes requests. He talks to the audience.  He'll do a shot if you buy it for him. He'll play that Sondheim song for you, even though you've already pressured him into playing what you think are the greatest songs from the greatest musicals ever written.  The drinks are a little pricey and the bar is a little dirty, but it's a decent time on a Sunday night.",1,,
196,L M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,4.0,8/31/2016,"The Duplex has a rich history of preserving music of the theatre as well as promoting rising and accomplished stars.  Lovers of musical theatre cherish the intimacy of a cabaret setting, where the connection of singer to song and singer to audience is pure and palpable.  There are not many cabarets left in the U.S.--and the Duplex is one of New York's finest.  If you've never gone to a cabaret show and you enjoy listening flowing melodies with singable lyrics, you should definitely plan to see a show at the Duplex.  If you're in the mood for something more casual, you can stop in for a drink and sing along if the mood strikes.  I saw that someone had a bad experience with a rude bartender; that's not been my experience.  But I will say that some of the bartenders are always ""on"" and may have a cutting sense of humor that is not for the faint of heart.  Why not five stars, you might wonder?  Well...I don't think that the Duplex in its current incarnation lives up to the Duplex of the past, when the venue was located across 7th Avenue at 55 Grove Street.  The rich history of that room bore the energy of some amazing performers whose careers started there and some outstanding pianist/accompanists also (e.g., the incomparable, late Richard Burke; the inimitable Karen Miller; Glen Kelly--whose arrangements sounded like duets but he was only playing with two hands!; Mark Cherry; Christopher Marlowe).  Whether you're making a special trip to the Village or find yourself with some extra time between stops, the Duplex is a worthy destination to which you're likely to return.",,,
197,Jeanette L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,258,19,4.0,11/23/2013,"3.5 stars. It was late, they were open. It's a boozy good time with live music and some sort of walk-on cabaret setup. Definitely a fun, end-of-the-night stop with friends.",,,
198,Victoria L.,"Manhattan, NY",44,37,0,5.0,9/29/2011,"Some friends and I ended up here at the tail end of a bachelorette party last night, and we had such a fantastic time. Everyone was wonderful. Brain was singing and playing the piano, and he was super talented, funny and just a total sweetheart, especially to our bride-to-be. The waiter, whose name I unfortunately didn't catch, was great, too. Attentive, charming and also very sweet. And the bartender! She's got a wonderful voice. I don't know her name, either, sadly, but I think she was filling in for someone. Regardless, we loved her.Shortly before we left, Natalie Joy Johnson arrived and stole the show. She was the perfect note to end our party on. She was over-the-top, hilarious and just lovely. Thank you, Duplex, for a wonderful impromptu end to our bachelorette party! It was perfect.",,,1
199,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,4.0,12/7/2011,"I first came here back in 2008 to fulfill my fantasy of having a drink where Jack performed his ""Just Jack"" and ""Jack 2000"" shows. While I quickly realized that the show obviously used a false set for the episodes, I wasn't at all disappointed by the good times I had at Duplex.I've returned several times over the years since. The waitresses and bartenders are always sweet and courteous, the music is always a blast and the atmosphere is such a throwback to ""old New York"" that I just get tickled by it. I highly recommend a visit to ""Mostly Sondheim"" which is upstairs in the cabaret theater. There's a drink minimum, but for the laughs and music you'll find there, it's more than worth it.I've never left Duplex without a smile on my face!",,,
