This review is about Allan; the 5 star gentleman in the back that will be sure to make you feel at home with every eiseys experience. The best waiter in NYC hands down. It's been rumored that he is in high demand, as many jazz bars throughout the borough have been headhunting his services. After all it makes sense; he mixes in your old school serving etiquette with his own unique razzle dazzle. Thank you Allan!!

But everything was just slightly off and no one was impressed and something always went wrong...First the order was wrong with the meal being brought out on toast instead of a bagel, then instead of fixing the order they just brought out a toasted bagel... Because the sando had melted cheese, nothing really transferred to the bagel. Pancakes weren't really fluffy... Tasted like cheap box stuff.Egg sando wasn't warm and the eggs were horribly overcooked.Oh well, no big deal. I'll just mark it in my 'passssss' food list.",1,,1

Biggest problem being, are they a Jewish deli? Are they a diner? Are they a sandwich shop? Turns out they're a mix of all. You can grab eggs all day, a warm pastrami and corned beef special, a cheeseburger and more. Turns out that mix means that nothing is a 'specialty' of sorts. The pastrami sammies are good, but not great. Come to think of it, that's the case with everything here. Nothing is bad, but you're not telling your friends about it here. In an area with all sorts of restaurants (and a ton of fast casual spots) it's nice to see this 'old school' diner slinging some griddled eats around.

9,Sara B.,"Jersey City, NJ",3527,649,4934,4.0,12/6/2017,"Classic Jewish comfort food - ya can't beat that! I've worked in the area for several years and somehow just tried Eisenberg's for the first time. It's safe to say that I'll be back very soon.I started off with some matzah ball soup (partially because it was a chilly day, partially because I won't pass this up if I see it on a menu). For five dollars the bowl is pretty large and comes with one very plump matzah ball, chicken, noodles and carrots. The broth was flavorful and only needed a little bit of pepper to liven it up.I also tried an order of latkes. A side is 3 dollars and comes with one pretty large latke and a side of sour cream and applesauce. The latke is perfection. Perfectly crispy and golden fried. Homemade potato pancakes are a pain to make and the frozen guys just don't taste the same, so it's nice to know that I can grab one at Eisenberg's when I have a craving.I snuck a bite of a pastrami sandwich which was tasty but not amazing (certainly not the best pastrami that you'll have in NYC - and most of us agreed). The pastrami was a bit burnt. But the sandwich was still very good and came stuffed with a ton of meat.So while this is no Katz's, Eisenberg offers a classic homemade Jewish meal / diner experience. This is a great place to visit if you are looking to satisfy that type of craving.",23,7,17
10,Jessica K.,"Queens, NY",130,134,252,3.0,3/12/2018,"This place is just OK. Decent spot to get a fast greasy meal: bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll, tuna or egg salad, etc. Price isn't worth the quality of what you're getting, but I guess that's what happens when you have to pay rent for a prime 5th ave location. Place has been here forever, still has that old time charm. I'd also be careful ordering from them online. See my pictures. What I ordered was an egg salad sandwich and added bacon to it. So essentially, what I ordered was exactly what that picture looked like. When I opened the wrapper, well, you can see what reality was. Egg salad, no lettuce, no tomato. $9+ for two slices of white bread, some egg salad, and 2 pieces of bacon. I dunno what the deal was today, but my sandwich looks nothing like any of the pictures currently posted. I even double checked to see if I perhaps missed something on Seamless and had to have specified the lettuce and tomato, and nope. No option.",,,
11,Linards K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6,5,2,5.0,10/14/2018,"Went here for breakfast. Really wanted to try Reuben sandwich as Ive never had one before. Was not disapointed- juicy pastrami with mild, creamy, melted cheese. The sauerkraut was perfectly spicy and the sandwich with the crispy bread was in perfect balance.

That is something I would definitely recommend. The waiter was nice and was even able to let me taste test the rye bread.",,,
14,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",913,269,1028,3.0,8/28/2017,"What a bummer! It wasn't a terrible sandwich, mind you, but after hearing my coworkers talk this place up for several weeks I had high expectations. I'm also not the world's biggest Katz's fan, which pains me to say, so I was hoping that I could find a corned beef sandwich to beat them out. Unfortunately, Eisenberg's didn't even come close. I ordered a reuben and a side of potato salad - ordering the reuben was slightly confusing. I was using our corporate Seamless account and the description for the reuben is pretty straightforward, listing corned beef, kraut, thousand island, and swiss cheese. However, when you select the sandwich, a variety of choices pop up - your choice of meat between corned beef and pastrami (I chose corned beef because I'm not a heathen), whether or not you want to add a side (I did, see above) and LASTLY, whether or not you want to add cheese for $1. Maybe I'm an idiot and just misinterpreted it, but I figured this was either a typo or an option for someone to add extra cheese - I figured swiss came on the reuben. So, I didn't select anything, and I ended up with a reuben without swiss. That in and of itself was a disappointment, but again, maybe I'm just a clod.Where I DO fault Eisenberg's, after the whole cheese debacle, is in the quality of the sandwich itself. It was egregiously mediocre corned beef that ended up being very very dry (nothing like Katz's where it melts in your mouth) but the worst part was the extremely soggy rye that just could not hold up the ample amount of beef piled on. The potato salad was actually delicious, but I think me saying that is more a reflection on my own bad taste than the potato salad - it was basically chunks of potato swimming in mayonnaisey cream? Hard to describe and harder to say why I liked it, but I did.The portion of meat was massive for the price, although it still ended up being a $20+ lunch for what I thought was a pretty below average sandwich. Maybe they were off their game and it's worth trying again, but I don't think I'll rush to order again.",3,1,1

29,Emma P.,"Hoboken, NJ",12,86,95,5.0,1/2/2018,"Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop is exactly how you imagine a New York diner to be. It's fast, noisy and seems chaotic but it runs like a well oiled machine and it even has pictures of 'famous' people all over the walls. There's seating in a back room but to soak up the atmosphere you should sit at the long lunch counter where you can watch your food being made to order. Grab a menu, tell the counterman what you'd like and you've got yourself a real old school New York experience. Food is classic NYC diner/Jewish deli style. There's a variety of soups, breakfast items and daily plated specials but the best thing to get is a sandwich. All the sandwiches are great, they have a big selection of breads and if you don't see what you want on the menu just ask and they will make what you want. The meats are cooked on the premises, (their roast turkey is very good) and their BLT is the best in town! I'm also partial to their tuna sandwich with bacon added to it and although you don't really need anything other than a sandwich if I'm with other people I will get an order of half fries/half onion rings as they're pretty darned good.The owners and the counter men are all very friendly and it's great value for money.

After finally ordering we waited a full 30 minutes before realizing that they never even started our orders.  We were the only people at the counter without food or even a glass of water! We were completely and utterly ignored and nobody batted an eye as we just stood up and stormed out.  I had notice that the service had been dipping the last couple of times I had been but today was truly appalling.  The staff is more interested in chumming it up and cracking jokes than taking care of the customers.

These places were once the working mans lunch. Of course, absurd Manhattan rents disallow that now. Packed with a healthy mix of white collar workers, and tourists who've wandered out of midtown, tucked into a building on broadway. Grab a stool at the counter, or fight your way to the back in hopes of grabbing one of the few tables they have. The Matzo Ball is yummy. Rich, with big flavor. The Matzo is full bodied, but still light as a feather. Not as dense as a pool cue as you'll often find. The Reuben, eh. Not a fan. It was grilled on a flattop, and was super greasy. Ended up being a lead weight in my tummy. Their breakfasts are served all day and are tasty. They do real justice the the Bacon, Egg, and cheese. The official breakfast of NY'ers. Really a great place. If you're looking for refined service with groveling waiters, this isn't your place.

Updated review","Beautiful. Simply b e a u t i f u l. I came here for the first time a month ago and fell in love right away. Via Seamless I ordered their meat loaf and for $13 it was a steal coming with a few sides as well. So flavorful, moist (I know I hate the word too), and just damn good. I absolutely need to come back and try one of their reuben's which I now know should taste as good as they look on their site. Their chicken soup is also fresh and has a great homemade feel to it. It is miles above canned or most places. The only thing that makes me sad is it appears they no longer serve the meat loaf as it is no longer listed via Seamless :( I highly recommend once you have finished reading this sentence, get off your butt and visit this gem!",1,,

Last night a friend and I wanted matzo ball soup and pastrami on rye with mustard. Don't forget the pickles. It was a Monday night and it wasn't packed at all! We sat at the counter and were greeted with menus instantly. (Sit at the counter for faster service.) I got the double meat combo with pastrami and brisket. Holy Christ, I wanted to live and work there after my sandwiches. I am giving this place 4 stars because the brisket was just okay. But the service was great, the atmosphere was cozy even in a huge city like NYC and lastly the matzo ball soup warmed me up instantly. Try this place out! Just because it's cheaper than most deli's, doesn't mean the quality is subpar. I'll be back for more pastrami, applied pie and maybe lox and bagels!",,,
50,Bernard O.,"Kurraba Point, Australia",5,75,142,4.0,5/26/2017,"I've got to admit, one of the first things I do in New York is try to find a good diner or deli that serves an all day counter breakfast. And for me, Eisenberg's at Flatiron ticks all the boxes.It has one of the longest deli counters you will find anywhere and you dine under the gaze of old time celebrities whose photos line one of the walls. I've been here several times over the years and it just never fails to disappoint. It's nothing flashy but it is authentic, the food is good and the vibe is welcoming.This place opens early so it's a great spot to stop for a counter breakfast. I've had the scrambled eggs  and bacon  (I just wish they'd leave off the potato hash. It's too much). Another time I couldn't resist ordering a classic Reuban - piled high with pastrami, Swiss cheese and pickles. For an Aussie visitor, this seemed like a quintessential New York thing to do. It didn't disappoint.Eisenberg' serves all the classic diner hits including a delicious patty melt - a toasted rye sandwich with melted Swiss cheese, onions and a beef patty. Of course, it's all served with good strong coffee  which is topped up regularly. Eisenberg's is really no-frills but it's honest, reliable and inexpensive. It's also a favourite.",,,

Updated review","I wish Josh and Bonnie only the best.  To the new owners - there is an old saying, ""Change is good"", but in this case....of an 86 year old institution which has held its own for that length of time, change is probably the worst thing that could happen at Eisenberg's....and for your new business venture. The streets of NYC are lined with sterile looking, white tiled eateries; each a clone of the one right next door! Panera Bread salad clones...nothing more and nothing outstanding in any of them! Eisenberg's is one of the very few bastions of an older New York City which is still open....still serving egg creams, lime rickeys, giant latkes, great coffee, garlic pickles, 4 inch high pastrami sandwiches, giant matzo balls in chicken soup, a chocolate cake to die for, bacon, egg, & cheese on a toasted roll - Ahh...all so delicious..... and all at decent prices!  And...let's not forget the cooking staff - a well-orchestrated group of smart, short order cooks and servers who know how to seamlessly work together to bring our hot food to us fast and who make damn good egg creams. As the Eisenberg T-shirt says, ""Either you get it or you don't!""  New owners, I sure hope you get it!",,,1
52,Aj L.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,0,5.0,6/20/2018,"Big fan of this place. The pastrami sandwich is absolutely killer. Has that old school New York deli vibe to it which is not for everyone but I love. You'll be cramped if you sit down or will be feeling ""in the way"" if you are waiting for takeout, but the sandwich has always been worth the hassle for me. As long as you have the right expectation of atmosphere when you go in, you won't be disappointed.",,,
53,Ken A.,"Honolulu, HI",1,47,4,5.0,6/6/2018,"Our recent visit gives us hope that the new owner isn't going to throw out a time-tested formula. My LEO sandwich was perfectly balanced and not too heavy to go with an egg cream soda, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed her French toast platter. The staff gracefully accomodated our five-person party at a table in back. We'll be returning next time we're in NYC.",,,
54,Rob K.,"New York, NY",0,23,1,5.0,3/4/2018,"To the millennials and clueless tourists, this is not a deli. It's not a diner. And it's not on Broadway. This is an old school New York lunch counter. There used to be hundreds of them. Now just a handful survive, thanks to an ever increasing influx of imagination challenged cookie cutter suburbanites who prefer Chipotle for lunch. Like any restaurant, Eisenberg's has its strengths and weaknesses. Don't come here for Michelin star food, and certainly don't complain if you do and then aren't served it.  To the person who said you don't bring friends here, well I'm glad you're not my friend. For over 25 years, since the days of ""The Hawaiian Room with your host Phil"", I've been bringing friends and colleagues to Eisenberg's, and every one of them loved it.  If your friends only eat gluten free range farm to mouth organic avocado toast and cold brew craft water, served by man bunned flannel mannequins, then please do not bring your friends or yourself to Eisenberg's. People who appreciate classic real New York experiences need all the stools they can get. And don't order delivery from here unless you have been to the place in person first. Half of what makes the food great is watching it being prepped and soaking in the atmosphere. Combine that experience with the tasty comfort food, like the stellar tuna melt, and you will fall in love. But if you don't allow yourself to be romanced by the restaurant itself before ordering, you're doing yourself and the restaurant a disservice by complaining about the delivery. Like they say, either you get it or you don't. Just because you don't doesn't make it bad.",2,1,1

Full of grease and everything was burnt. I ordered 3 eggs over easy, and they broke 2 of the eggs and still served them to me. The dried out sausage and undercooked bacon really made me sick to my stomach. There is no comfortable seating and the service is terrible. I asked my server about items on the menu and he was extremely rude when answering my questions. On top of that he only came to our table after waving him down to take our order, bring our food, and give the check. The other server was walking around the floor on FaceTime with a friend using very offensive language. I'm not usually one to post reviews but this deserved one. I will NEVER go back.",2,,

The tuna melt is great (which takes a lot for me to say because I'm very picky when it comes to tuna) and the fries are DELICIOUS!! I got a side order and honestly that could have been my lunch.

61,Erin H.,"Chicago, IL",117,63,15,5.0,7/5/2017,All I wanted when I was in NYC was a good Jewish deli and that is exactly what I got!

Eisenberg's is an NYC institution and was featured on a few lists for the best bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll.Overall verdict on the breakfast sandwich: way overpriced for what it is -- which is teetering around average. $7 for a breakfast sandwich on a roll... in NYC. Blasphemy. The egg wasn't cooked well and the lack of cheese made the sandwich kinda dry. I wasn't a fan and had to douse it in ketchup and hot sauce to add flavor.On Eisenberg's itself and the other foods it has to offer? It's a solid spot. When you walk in, you're instantly taken back to old New York. It's a greasy spoon where all the workers know your name, what you do, and the general goings-ons of your life. Even rolling in on a weekday morning before work, you can see families and regulars as well as visitors of NYC.It's something you can to try at least once in New York. The ambiance at Eisenberg is what you really need to experience.",2,,
64,Kirsten M.,"Portland, OR",0,4,2,5.0,10/9/2017,"I stumbled upon this place as I was walking to another sandwich shop. There was room at the counter and I loved the feel and smell so I walked in. I enjoyed a pastrami Reuben and a coffee. The staff were kind, but busy, so don't be afraid to speak up! The Reuben was awesome, and very filling. The reviews that disagree with this, obviously don't know what a Reuben is supposed to taste like or they simply don't like Reubens. If you like Reubens, especially pastrami ones, go here",,,

68,H. Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,2.0,6/8/2018,"This place has been hit or miss for me. Sometimes they make a great sandwich, other times they don't care. Today is an example of a miss and I'm not coming back. I asked for an egg and cheese with a few toppings. They clearly forgot my order because I waited too long for it and I heard one guy repeating my order to another. Then they started making it. He rushed it and handed me an egg on top of two unmelted slices of cheese. I immediately hand it back asking if I can get the cheese melted. He looked at me like I was crazy. I explained that I asked for it to be grilled because the cheese was just thrown on and with a hot egg and cheese you expect the cheese to be melted. He just kept looking at me and so I got up and left. No reason for me to pay for a sandwich thrown together without regard to me and made to feel like I'm crazy because I want the cheese melted.",1,,

I do love Eisenbergs but this experience was enough for me to find another Jewish deli. Can't speak about the experience at the restaurant, but do not order delivery unless you want a headache.",,,
70,Victoria C.,"Staten Island, NY",81,106,9,3.0,6/28/2017,"I'm eating this disappointing sandwich as we ""speak"". We had a delivery order for our staff lunch. I requested melted cheese and toasted bialy for my turkey, Swiss, and slaw sandwich, and they did not oblige my request- who eats an untoasted bialy?!?!?! The turkey is carved turkey as opposed to ""cold cut turkey"", which is fine, but does not seem like it adequately lives up to this place's promise to raise my cholesterol. Hopefully I won't retain water like crazy from this either. The potato salad tastes just like the mass-produced stuff you'd get at a supermarket or local Costco/Sam's Club/BJ's. So does the coleslaw, which was on the disappointing sandwich and saved it from being totally dry.  Luckily, we have a toaster oven in the office, so that helped a bit, but not enough to bump up the stars on this review. In full disclosure, I was really hungry (and still am), so much so, I was kind of getting the shakes, so that may have resulted in me being a little less lenient on this review than I typically am. But let's face it, when you're that hungry, shouldn't just about anything taste good? Not this. It wasn't terrible, but it was a total, TOTAL let-down.Edited to add:I should probably take some responsibility for this. I was stupid and maybe should have ordered the brisket or pastrami. Shame on me for ordering turkey. But... I still feel justified in having expected more. And there was no excuse for that tasteless bialy and mass-produced potato salad and slaw!  :-/",,,1

72,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,7/7/2015,"Eisenberg's encapsulates all that's amazing about Manhattan. The moment you step in the door you're hit with the old-school charm and historical ambiance that you just imagine should be on every street corner of this great old city. The menu is extensive and features all the oldies but goodies: egg salad sandwiches, BLTs (and the first time I've seen a egg salad and BLT combined - genius), grilled cheese, matzo ball soup, egg creams, classic 2-egg breakfasts, etc. Though the front is always jam packed during lunch with takeout hours, it's surprisingly easy to get a seat at a table in the way back or at the counter. I personally love sitting at the counter  and watching the chefs do their thing. Service has always been efficient and on point except when I've come in on the weekend. Weirdly, though it's a lot less busy, almost empty, the service has been a lot slower and they've messed up orders, one time serving fries that were ice cold (hence the four stars instead of five). Maybe they have their B-team doing things during slow hours? Finally, I love that though this place oozes retro goodness, they're still nice enough to have an online takeout menu and they take credit cards. That's just about as modern as I want them to be, and not one ounce more!",11,6,11

Then I went ahead and called seamless,  they spoke to the shop as well while I was on hold. The shop told them that I cancelled the order and that was food was prepared.

Don't expect anything fancy - it's very basic and probably in need of a reno. The decor is pretty old-school, which, I think adds to its charm. This place has been around for ages and is a bit of an institution in these parts. The goods: Both my date and I ordered chicken salad with bacon, on rye. I added avocado on mine. We also shared an order of fries. So, first, you get a bowl of pickles! Awesome, since if you go out for smoked meat here in Montreal, they make you pay for it. The sandwich was great - pretty big for me so when I was done, I felt pretty darn satisfied. The chicken salad looked to be white meat only, and it tasted fresh, the bacon was crispy and the bread was fine. The fries were great - they were fat wedges that I think, might be home-made. They needed a little seasoning so we added salt. Service: Good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive!Price point: The sandwiches were $9 each (add $2 for the avocado) and I think the fries were about $4. Personally, I really enjoyed this place.

It's been 20 years (?) since my last egg cream, so this treat definitely brought back childhood memories. It was not quite an ice cream float, but more like a chocolate soda. Since I've tried to sample most of the pastrami in the city, I ordered the Two Combo. It was served unusually here, with each half of the cut sandwich having layers of pastrami AND reuben. While I couldn't judge each meat individually, this was a good sandwich. Not Katz good, but still tasty. The (somewhat bland) mustard comes on the side, via countertop bottles.

The additional sad part was that it wasn't a garden salad--rather it was all the yellow leaves of iceberg lettuce (my least favorite lettuce especially the yellow part, yuck). When the waitress brought my friend's order (which by the way contained lots of French fries), I asked for dressing. She said, ""oh did you want dressing""? What? I'm not a rabbit, of course I want dressing (especially to mask the sad looking salad. At least the cucumbers and tomatoes were fresh and the egg salad was quite good.

The decor of the place is clean, not fancy or impressive. It has a divey feel, like a 1920s speakeasy. I also took a bite of the roast beef sandwich served on sourdough bread. To be honest, that was the best tasting roast beef I had in my life and sliced very thin. The sourdough bread tasted good, too. I will definitely come back to eat here again.",2,,

I like coming in here for breakfast before work.The food is solid and reliable - but not the most stellar diner food I've had. The pastries and bagels don't taste super fresh and I don't think they're made in house - which is a big reason why the food is only so so for me. (I may be biased because my favorite diner - B&H, makes all their challah daily in house, and it just makes such a huge difference in how everything tastes.) That said, they make a mean sandwich, pancakes, and eggs. It's definitely a reliable and cheap meal if you're in a rush or just want something low key.",1,,
95,Lori S.,"Buffalo, NY",1,35,49,5.0,9/7/2016,Ambling down fifth and hungry for lunch. We had considered two other very famous delis but I opted for this one and are extremely glad we did! The atmosphere is perfect-- like stepping back in time. We sat at the bar and ordered sandwiches with matzoh ball soup. The soup was so delicious I will dream of it on cold winter nights.  I had a BLT sandwich that was at the top of the best I've ever had anywhere. The service was extremely friendly and quick and the prices were very reasonable. If I could eat here every day for lunch I think I would be a much happier person.   There is a reason this place has endured since 1929.  I would put it on a list of things not to miss in New York.  I wish I could compare it to the other two delis but I would be hard-pressed to even venture away from this Nirvana on fifth.,2,2,2
96,Daniel L.,"Birmingham, AL",3,56,2,5.0,7/1/2017,"When I think of New York there are two styles of restaurants I think of: new, hipster places that are excellent but trendy and older, classic deli type places who know how to make a sandwich that will change your life if you're not from around here (like me).  This place was in category 2. We really enjoyed this meal as it was our last vacation lunch in the city. I have an affinity for Reuben sandwiches and there is only one at home that even compares to northern ones, and I say that to set the stage for how I judge sandwiches. It was so good!! The pastrami was very good and everything on the sandwich blended together perfectly. I also enjoyed the potato salad which is probably not anything to write home about but it's different than what we have in the south. We also loved our waitress. She was so kind and taught us a few things about life in NYC.",,,

100,Sally W.,"New York, NY",680,990,6006,2.0,10/24/2013,"I was okay with my meatloaf platter that came with meatloaf, mixed vegetables (frozen kind) and mashed potatoes that were blah. The mashed potatoes are real? I make better mashed potatoes. I also asked for extra gravy. I was okay paying $8.50 for this platter. The quality was not the highest but I didn't expect it to be. Reminds me of Woolworth counter food, if you know what I mean. I think Woolworth's was a tiny bit better but not by much just a teeny bit better because the service there was excellent. I thought my bf's sandwich was skimpy for $9. I have paid less for a larger sandwich. It was tasty though. Just very skimpy in portion. His sandwich maybe should have only been about $6.50-$7 at most! A sandwich should not cost more than a meatloaf platter. I sat by the counter where I can watch the action. The stuff I saw was quite disturbing to me. There was cross contamination everywhere. UGH. I pointed it out to my boyfriend. It is disgusting. If you are allergic to dairy, DO NOT GET THE LIME RICKEY! There is no milk in Lime Rickey until you are in Eisenberg's. I saw the soda counter guy mix drinks with the same spoon. When he made a milk beverage like an egg cream, he would lay the spoon he just used back onto a dirty part of the drip tray, then use the same spoon if someone ordered the Lime RIckey. What if someone is allergic to dairy?! The spoon was laying on the part of the counter where there was dried milk. OMG it was disgusting. Maybe some people are okay with unsanitary habits. The same gloved hands that prepared food also cleared garbage away. But to cross contaminate and not care about mixing things and putting ingredients into things that shouldn't have that ingredient then that is nasty. I had to leave. AT LEAST, use one spoon for egg creams and one spoon for lime rickeys etc. etc. and keep it off the dirtiest part of the counter! Use napkins or something.I work in the service industry and I am much more mindful than at Eisenberg's. gross.And does the sandwich have to be so greasy on the outside of the bread? No need for that much grease. I use a panini press and I don't use grease on it and it comes out fine. I am sorry Mr. Eisenberg. I hope no hard feelings. It was just hard for me to watch.",15,6,2

I stopped in here on my way to work the other morning when I was desperate for a bagel and coffee. With out any real bagel options in Flatiron I popped in here to see what they had. The women at the register was welcoming and friendly, and assured me they had whole wheat. Even though they didn't have jalapeño cream cheese (my go-to), they were super accommodating in slicing up who jalapeños to layer on my bagel. I also ordered an iced coffee for a whopping total of $.25. You really can't beat that price in this area. Much to my surprise, the coffee was DELICIOUS. Like, better than Starbucks.

So I think I may have changed sides!I came to NYC for the day from Denver..flew out in the morning and then back that night. My lunch choice was a no brainier..matzo ball soup, hot pastrami on rye, and a cream soda. Eisenberg's hit the spot..added bonus that it is right next to my friend's office. Service was great. They brought out some pickles (really good ones too) to start. I got a little impatient waiting for my matzo ball soup to cool and burnt my tongue a bit..it's hot! But it was really good! Then the pastrami came out. I REALLY enjoyed the thin sliced..it was as if there was more flavor or something. Loved it!

We gave both our breakfast orders to the surly, bad humored guy behind the counter. His body language and communication skills were terrible. The early signs were bad. We should have left at that point and gone to Eatly for some delicious overpriced pastries! Anyway we wanted the ""old diner"" nostalgic experience so against our better judgement we stayed. The coffee was like dirty water also, terrible. So one order came out correctly but not the other one, it had home fries instead of French fries. We told the dour guy behind the counter of the mistake. He first contradicted us that we ordered home fries. Nice! We said no we ordered French fries. He reluctantly took the plate back. 25 mins later and still no sign of the eggs w/bacon and French fries. Still loads of attitude coming from the guy behind the counter. The cashier was sweet and was getting involved by this point because it was beyond ridiculous, apologizing for the mistake and the delay. Anyway after some more time lapsed and still no sign of the food we had had enough. We paid for the one breakfast that we got and left. So much for getting pulled in by nostalgia!! Never again.",,,

It is one of the oldest Cafés in NYC, and it feels like it too. Not is a bad, or dated way, but in a cool retro and authentic way.They have a modern sense of humor in their marketing and branding, and I am always curious as to what joke the sandwich chalk board is making when I walk by.

The able counterman who served everyone at the counter while he filled take out and online orders. The checkless check-out where I simply told the person at the cash register what I had and she believed me.What I hated: The borscht. I won't say Eisenberg's cheats, buys jars of Manischewitz at the supermarket and serves it to you for $4 a bowl. I will say this: If Eisenberg's makes their own borscht from scratch (which they should), then amazingly it comes out tasting exactly the same as the Manischewitz you can purchase in a jar in any New York supermarket for $2.79. This is the weakest borscht so far in my New York City survey, worth a trip from no-where.What was OK: The tuna salad sandwich on pumpernickel.

No, not that you pervs, I'm talking about an old fashioned sandwich shop. Eisenberg's is the type of old school sandwich/deli shop that as you walk inside you feel as if everything should be seen in black and white. It's like entering a time warp back to the 1940's where you can picture the men wearing fedora hats, the women dressed like in I Love Lucy style, and kids drinking egg creams at the counter. In fact, not much has changed with this place as it still looks like it should be in the 1940's with all the decades of dirt and grime that came with it. Some who come here would say that the whole place needs a scrub down and complete renovation. Those who say that and get a bit skeeved by a little wear and tear from age just don't get a place like this, and never will, as that is part of it's charm. In an age when gentrification threatens to wipe away our history this sandwich shop defies modernization. Thank goodness because to me there is nothing like grabbing a seat at the counter, ordering a sandwich, and an old fashioned egg cream in a beat up old classic NYC sandwich joint.When I ate here for lunch the other day I went totally old school. Tuna melt on toasted rye, onion rings, and chocolate egg cream. The sandwich was made perfectly - just the right amount of mayo in the tuna with melted cheese and thick toasted bread. The tuna here tastes great. The onion rings were large, greasy, and crispy - the way they are supposed to be. The chocolate egg cream was awesome, and made with U-Bet's chocolate syrup - they way it was always meant to be made, and the only correct way. It's one of those classic NYC lunches that is served up fast and hot, you eat quickly, and head back to work or wherever you were going. Service is a bit gruff as expected, but actually quite pleasant if that can be said in the same sentence. Also, it's fun to sit at the crowded counter during lunch hour and watch the counter staff run back and forth putting everything together.It's not the cheapest lunch - tuna melt at $7.50, onion rings at $3.50, and an egg cream at $2.00 - but still not that bad overall at $14 with tax. It was actually quite delicious and a bit different than the normal lunch I get from the area deli and chain spots. Plus, looking at all the past and present celebrity photos, wanna be celebs, friends and family pics in a mish-mash of frames hanging on the walls is a trip.  Just a classic example of a NYC sandwich shop from a time long ago passed by.

145,Linda W.,"New York, NY",110,491,138,2.0,11/2/2013,"Eisenberg's was featured on an episode of Bourdain's Disappearing NY from No Reservations. Don't get me wrong, if anyone knows food, it's definitely Bourdain. I worship this man. This was his famous commentary:  ""Continuous service of these fine [lime rickeys and egg creams] for 70 years, sublime tuna salad on white, and prices that are pretty much along 1985 lines. But most important, this is not some lame-o Johnny Rockets recreation, this is the real thing."" Keep in mind that this episode was filmed in 2009.Fast-forward to 2013, and the prices are no longer along the 1985 lines. Most of their famous sandwiches- Ruben, Tuna melt, Pastrami, and Hot tongue are now along the lines of $7.50-$10.00+. True, a vintage institution as Eisenberg isn't exactly charging an arm and leg for the NY diner fare. Take for instance, Carnegie charges $22+ which is a hefty tourist trap. The difference is Carnegie is infamous for their monstrous and stacked sandwich portions. Hence the price difference. Whereas Eisenberg isn't exactly cheap either for their small portions.We were seated across from a table that had a trash can placed on top (see pic). We also witnessed some of the staff members picking out pickles from the bins in addition to sweeping when customers were eating. Ice was stored in a trash can bin that was dug out and served.  As some yelpers noted- grim, dirt, and grease. Waitress served our platters by slamming down on the table so hard that it knocked into our utensils. Thanks, lady. We had the Ruben and scrambled eggs with corned beef hash. Waitress told me either fries or lettuce/tomatoes that comes as sides when asked for home fries. Ok, no problem, fries is fine. The Ruben portion was a joke. It was a mini looking thing no bigger than a bagel. The french fries looked as if it had been re-fried 3X in the fryer. Waitress simply asked if that would be all and threw the check. Once we got up to leave, no thank you or goodbye of that sort. We were better off serving ourselves. Bottom line- if you don't mind raising your cholesterol level, overlook the run down paint and interior and filthy floors, and waiters with an attitude, you're in for a real treat.

Eisenberg's is no exception. Been here twice (once for a grilled chicken sandwich, another for hot pastrami), and both were just okay. Service was pleasant and I'm glad they have Arnold Palmer as an option, but wasn't really impressed by either sandwich.

Thinly sliced pastrami with sauerkraut on rye lightly toasted and cut into little triangles.  Maybe it was because I hadn't had a good pastrami sandwich in a while or the fact that I was a little more hungry than usual, but this thing was amazing.  It's not as tender as Katz deli because it's not cut into thick slices, but I like the seasoning and the excellent portion.The tuna fish is apparently the best in the city.

There is a big crowd of people near the door waiting for take out so it would be easy to think there are no seats. Not to worry my friends, there are plenty down the back! As others have mentioned, this is an old school dining experience. The menu is large with tons of tasty options to tempt you all at crazy reasonable prices. I am a big fan of the milk shake. I think if this place was around the corner from my house I would be SO screwed (and fat) because I would be in here every weekend.When you sit down they bring over home made pickles.. amazingly tasty home made pickles I might add. I have had sandwiches and fries the few times I have been in here and left satisfied. The first time I came in I had to try their chicken salad with bacon and it was great, loved it! The fiancé had the tuna melt and also enjoyed - the amount of tuna was impressive! He almost didn't even finish it if you could imagine that. If you are in the neighborhood definitely check Eisenburg's out!",1,,1

As it should be ;) Sit up at the counter, have boys assemble you some sandwiches you just can't find easily in Manhattan anymore.And Friday is Manhattan chowder soup day. Dead on delicious. And Egg Creams - choc and vanilla. They're all over this!I spied them spooning rice pudding from a catering pack which I was a bit disappointed at, but you're here for the soup and sarnies anyway, right?",1,,

Flounder - which is a very thin fish to begin with - is breaded thickly on both sides, dumped into a deep fat frier for WAY too long and then sliced into strips like chicken tenders. My question: where is the fish?? Inedible. My mom had an openface turkey sandwich which the owner actually described as having 'beef-ish' gravy. The turkey was dry and served with canned 'medley o'corn 'n' stuff.'  The only good thing was the coleslaw. Stunning why this place has customers. Must be nostalgia. Fugedaboudit.",1,,1

Another star.I ordered a Pastrami sandwich. First: the pastrami was overcooked; the meat was brown. Second, they bathed the rye with a lit of mustard; overpowering the pastrami flavor. Zero starI will give them another chance in the future and will revisit my review; but I will stay away from the Pastrami.",,,

Besides the fact that the sandwich is absolutely mouth watering, it's super affordable compared to the other Jewish delis that'll charge you 20 bucks for a sandwich. Went to Carnegie delis the other day which charged 27.95 for the open face Rueben and it wasn't nearly as good. If you want food for the sake of it tasting good come here. If you're about the hype and must go places, which can sometimes be a tourist trap-you'll have to reconsider after the Rueben here. The place and decor is nothing to rave about but the sandwich was amazing, nothing else really mattered. Not sure about everything else on the menu but having the Rueben sandwich really makes me wonder why the place has such few stars. Maybe because it's super old 1920's, they don't really care to market.",1,1,1

Good sign.I was advised to get the pastrami sandwich and so I did (with matzo ball soup to share). The soup was very soothing and comforting, especially after enduring the cold. I enjoyed it, however I don't think I could judge matzo ball soups as this was my first. The pastrami sandwich was good all over, from the bread to the meat. The bread was perfectly toasted, light, airy and the right crisp. The amount of pastrami they put in the sandwich was also fitting (unlike other Delis that just pile a ridiculous amount on). The pastrami was wonderfully smokey and salty. With bites of pickle in between bites of sandwich, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.",1,,

Updated review","I finally tried this place, and maybe I wish I hadn't. The service is awful, I couldn't get anyone to take my order, the counter person was walking away while I was ordering, I couldn't get a second soda, I couldn't ask for more ice, just terrible neglectful service.  The food, not delicious The pastrami sandwich, the bread was so manhandled and falling apart, the pastrami was some of the fattiest I have ever seen, also some of the least flavorful pastrami I have had. The fries and onion rings, greasy, greasy, greasy and completely unseasoned! Not a speck of salt! This is a place that just screams I've given up and don't give a shit!",,,

192,D I.,"Rocky River, OH",72,128,151,5.0,3/29/2012,"Unhappy people extrapolating from one experience to write a negative review - CHECK. Misspelling the word ""reubens"" while attempting to appear witty? CHECK.Repeatedly typing the word ""check"" in all caps? CHECKIgnore the people giving this place negative reviews. I wish I could meet these people so I could ask why they're so unhappy. They probably hate their parents and grandparents, too. Their kids will probably hate them someday. Oh well. There are always some people who take a less than perfect experience and then generalize in order to have their opinion out there and feel better about the ruinous state of their existence. I love them. I really do.This place was everything I wanted a NY deli to be. Amazing hot corned beef. My girlfriend got it. I got the pastrami reuben - very good, but the corned beef was better. No mustard. No toppings. Just straight dope. Matzo ball soup was pretty good too. Not the best, but that's not the main attraction. Cured meat is their winner.The fifth star is for great food at a much better price than the competition. So much cheaper than Carnegie, Stage or Katz. Check it out. Good political discussions on the bathroom walls, too.",7,9,7

Whether you come for some eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee in the morning or come for a pastrami sandwich for lunch you really can't go wrong.

For Example...Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, to the uninitiated, could look like a dive if you didn't know it's the best sandwich shop ever. When you've had one pastrami sandwich there...you'll give them five stars, unless you're placing unreal expectations on them. You'll get amazing food in a really amazing environment with real character.  Now, you've had your food and your experience...get out! LOL.

197,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2400,4793,2.0,1/17/2012,"Here's a history lesson. Say, 80 years ago the Irish Immigrants came to NYC and wanted to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day with their traditional dish of Irish bacon and cabbage. The problem was there was none of this specially bacon available. So they went to the local butcher on the lower east side. Here's how the conversation went:Jimmy O'Hagen - Laddy, We need our Irish bacon for our celebration but its expensive and can't find it in AmericaIrving the butcher - Easy there my friend. Why not use Corned Beef? Its cheap, available now and you can make it with beer.JO'H - Why Thank You! Let there always be smiling Irish eyes upon you Danny boy!Here's the deal. I'm from Brooklyn. I ""KNOW"" Jewish food. I've been to Carnegie Deli, Katz's, Ratner's and even Grabsteins in my hood. Matzo ball soup? Its in my Brooklyn DNA.I waltz in wanting soup. Its cold outside baby! I sit at the counter and look around. Is it Kitschy in here? Nice countertop, luncheonette style with a lot of seats. So far so good.Now, I sit down and really start looking around. Mirrors all dirty. Pickles overflowing out of a container? A big potato salad bin that's open on a shelf? The counter is all dirty?? hmm.. Now I start seeing all these Hollywood types on the wall. Dude, I'm from NYC! And this place to me is not the real deal! So, the stars all went here and said Mmmm.. the pastrami is so good! Uh-huh. They also put pineapple on pizza in Los Angles and drink the blood of salmons to keep that just fresh movie star glow.I'm not getting soup here. I was afraid to be let down. Instead I ordered and what I was served was a crime. Eggs and Corned Beef on a platter.First. the corned beef was all dried out.Second, The french fries were all dried out and stale. Ever eat a stale, previously frozen and overcooked steak fry? Its sucks nads..Third (and this is a biggie) THEY HAVE A BLT ON THE MENU?Now, I get this place isn't Kosher. There should really be a big ""D"" on the door its so dirty and grimy. Its just a sin to serve corned beef this way with a Jewish sounding store name. You have all these Hollywood types here, posting pictures. I saw Jim Carry filming a movie outside last year. That's all its good for, a backdrop for films. This place is a Hollywood sham, its like a backdrop of NYC old deli. If you want good Jewish deli? Look elsewhere my friend. Trust me....The toast. I liked the rye toast that was buttered with my meal.Never again.",17,7,9

199,Stuart T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",530,254,1331,4.0,6/29/2012,"Eisenbergs, a discovery I made as a hungry teenager on the streets of manhattan in the early 80s when most every guy behind the counter spoke fluent yiddish- and it has stuck with me ever since. Ask a NYC native where the best delicatessen is (which literally means, fine foods to eat), and you will most likely be pointed to NYC's tourist spots which all serve really fine NY Deli fare- But for me? I will always choose Eisenbergs.First off- the interior, the counter, everything behind the counter, clean but as old as this store- 1936 I believe; a walk back in time, take pictures, but be discreet, this is an old standby, many regulars, the ones who came every day, probably a happy death by Pastrami and rye, but I digress...Its sandwiches which were always piled high seem to have shrunk in stature the last time I was there, but still, its an overall positive experience. The quality of the meats are always top notch; my favorite- the Reuben, is sublime. Get it with Russian dressing and ask for extra pickles and Sauerkraut, that's what I do.And make sure you wash it down with a NYC Egg Cream (squirt of chocolate syrup, splash of milk, Seltzer topped off- so so soooo good, yet simple. Or the Lime Ricky- not sure what's in there, but its fantastic as well, and both staples since before most anyone reading this was born (especially you young punks always staring down at iPhone screens, but then again, I have tshirts older than you).Half a star off for cutting the piles on the sandwiches down to almost half- previously it was about a 4"" stack- nowadays- 2"" or so- if theres an old recipe book, I suggest the new owners carefully look it over and make an option to stack the sandwiches ""old school style"", leave the skimpy portions to the newbies and the fearful.Kudos though for keeping a NYC tradition alive- Ive seen it go through 3 owners in the 30 years Ive been a customer.",2,,1
