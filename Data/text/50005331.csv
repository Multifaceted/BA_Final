1,Beverly D.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,3,0.0,1.0,8/31/2018,Worse bachelorette party ever! Do not go to this club period. Too small to be around so many pos in one room! lol to close for comfort. Not only are girls stuck up but they are ungrateful self entitled and rude.Security is no help they only add to the dissatisfaction and disappointment. They didn't let me tip girls onstage and were intimidating.We were there to have a good time but the pos in club made it impossible. Thank you but good bye!,4,,
2,Alan C.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,7,2,5.0,10/5/2018,"Went to Vivid a couple of weeks ago when I was in NY. This club is a real party environment. Had a lot of fun with a couple of my friends. Good looking girls and friendly staff, the host were not rude like most clubs and were very outgoing to help us out, getting a table of a seat by the stage. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in NY.",,,

8,Tony S.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,4,0,1.0,5/25/2018,Place is empty. Waitstaff is rude and far from having an appealing appearance. On the times I've stopped in we usually left since there would be 8 other people in the place (including workers). Save your time and go elsewhere!,1,1,
9,Helen K.,"Atlanta, GA",303,73,71,5.0,2/6/2017,LOVE this place. They are my go to spot in NY. The cocktail waitresses are great and the dancers here are seriously so beautiful.. I am not going to lie I cannot comment about the prices because I am usually intoxicated and whoever I am with takes care of that - but whatever. The bathrooms are upstairs and they are fancy AF. But PLEASE be careful when going downstairs. You could easily take a tumble. Best part is the upstairs outdoors VIP. They have it opened for bottle service too. If you go you will not be disappointed!,5,7,4

15,Steve B.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,10/5/2016,"If you want to go to a cool strip club, go to Flashdancers and skip this place.  Seriously!The bouncers were distracted and inept.  I could have been strapped and they would have missed it.The coat check lady was deeply offended that I took her away from her texting. Who knows? Maybe she was in the middle of preventing global thermonuclear war.The beers were overpriced, although I expected that.The girls were surly, sleazy, hostile and, yes, I am going to say it, all beat up.I do not think I have ever seen such a collection of run-down, beat-up,  scarred retreads in one place in my life, and especially such a scintillating assortment of cranky losers with a condescending, go screw yourself attitude.Truly amazing!Bloated, diseased-looking gross women taking off their clothes, and charging you cash money for the experience.  Customers should be paying them to put their clothes back on!!So, the good thing about this place is that after one visit, you know what to avoid in a NYC strip club.Yep!!",9,15,1
16,Richard E.,"New City, NY",23,8,0,1.0,4/13/2017,"Brought in a bachelor party on a Saturday night. Accommodating, but very seedy. I blacked out after an hour there. I was hardly drinking and I think that they might have put something in my drink because I was not the only one in the bachelor party to blackout that night and I have never in my life blacked out. All the girls just try to take you for more money, which is expected at a club, but they are pushy about it. Avoid this place at all costs.",6,4,1
17,Mark G.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,1/12/2018,Stopped into this place for the first time with a buddy right before Christmas. Bouncers were friendly at door and shook my hand. I was coming from the Rangers game and they waived my cover by just showing my ticket stub. That was cool. Inside the place is small but nice and to my surprise the place had a lot of girls and many 10's in my opinion. I was greeted by a gentleman who seated my friend and I at a table. I could not remember his name as I could barely hear it. The music was loud. I was not harassed as some other reviews said. I was a little worried about that but everyone was cool from the girls to the waitresses and wow these waitresses were hot. The guys working there were helpful and funny and made my experience very enjoyable I would definitely go back and would recommend to friends. I felt comfortable there and I am in no way a baller. Just a bunch of drinks and dances. No bottles and definitely no VIP rooms. I just can't afford that.,,,1

Updated review","Not a big strip club guy but came to vivid as a suggestion from a local bartender 2 blocks from the club good tip to know if you close to vivid and don't have free passes give name of a local bar they will wave the $20 cover, reason I don't like strip clubs is that they want you to spend a tone of money and if not they ignore you, but I got to say at vivid everyone is a VIP no matter how much you spend, waitresses are super hot and the dancers.Went to the bar had 3 beers and 2 shots stayed longer than I thought because there was no pressure on me by anyone definitely a great experience. 5 stars. Also check out the roof top it's beautiful On negative was bar was crowded and hard to get a seat",,,
20,Arthur K.,"Seattle, WA",378,791,647,4.0,9/30/2014,"We got some free passes for this place through a bartender friend. Be warned though that even with free cover you still have to purchase 2 drinks and they cost $18 each, but I'm used to that having been to Vegas several times.The women here were top notch. I love Hispanic women and they had plenty of Puerto Rican girls to choose from. They were all very friendly and none of them pressured me for a dance or the VIP room. This is a real first for me-especially on a Friday night. I also liked the fact that most of the music was electronic music and not all dirty south.",8,2,1
21,M. H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,25,0,1.0,8/31/2015,"I picked up a bunch of custom bookmark passes advertising this establishment. The offer showed three pretty women and offered the sexiest party in NYC. But what really grabbed my attention was the offer of a free lunch Monday-Friday 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. It  also stated that there would be no cover with the pass.I flipped over the pass and scanned it very carefully for the fine print, the catch as it were. Were women restricted from entering this club? Was there a dress code? Was there a drink minimum required? No, it appeared to be clean, a legitimate offer of free food. I wouldn't mind paying for a drink if the food was any good; it can be a little dry choking down a meal without sufficient liquid refreshment. But it seemed that wasn't a requirement.When I arrived there was a tall bouncer/bodyguard/doorman standing outside. He made no objections to my being a woman; he only asked to see I.D. He casually mentioned that there were $9 drinks on offer at the bar. I ignored it. I had no intention of paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage. Seriously, it was only 11:30 a.m. in the morning!However, I should have heeded that as a warning. When I got to the bag check, the woman behind the counter was more explicit. The free lunch came ONLY with a two-drink minimum, specifically the $9 drinks the bouncer had mentioned. I pointed out, with all due politeness, that there was nothing like that stated on the bookmark I'd picked up nor one of the 4x6-inch notecards I'd snagged at the entrance. I also mentioned that I had been very careful to look for this because I'd run into these kind of miscommunications in the past. She said that I could talk to the manager. I silently decided it was pointless since this misleading advertisement was in all likelihood the manager's idea. I took the bookmark and the notecard as evidence of this deception and departed.I don't condone this sort of deceit to be practiced on potential customers. If drinks, gratuities, restrictions or other requirements are necessary, it would behoove the owners or managers to make that absolutely clear on their pamphlets, flyers, notecards, etc. This sort of deliberate omission is annoying and wastes the time of the employees, especially that woman who had to explain the club policy to me. I see that one Yelp reviewer at least had the decency to warn people. I only wish whoever was in charge of getting these passes printed had been as forthcoming.",16,20,2
22,Karen L.,"Plainfield, NJ",67,8,13,5.0,10/9/2016,"We had an exceptional experience here tonight! The girls were beautiful and fit and friendly. My partner got me a lap dance and multiple massages, all were wonderful!",4,,1
23,Jennifer V.,"Manhattan, NY",6,8,1,4.0,6/25/2015,"The only reason I love this place is because of Maria C and Chris S. Chris S. is a great host!! My boyfriend and I have told our friends about this place because we always receive the best service from the bartender Maria who works upstairs. Seriously the only reason to go upstairs at all (unless you're in a room ;)) is to get a drink from Maria C. The girls are okay, maybe the rejects from Ricks cabaret. You'll find a couple good looking girls. But Maria C. makes you feel like you're at your neighborhood bar. This place is honestly a dull fest on most days but you'll find some great people here. It's a great spot for tourists, couples, after work drinks, etc. When you come here, ask for Maria C.!",3,,2

Updated review","One year later and it's worth noting how many people agree with my assessment of this place. And yet the average rating is still pretty high...So the thing I feel compelled to add is that if you take a hard look at some of the people praising this place you will find at least a couple of individuals who WORK FOR VIVID CABARET.That is called a CONFLICT OF INTEREST - a simple but very important concept to  understand in life, but even moreso when evaluating strip clubs where getting crunk, turnt up, and wilin out with some freaky girls at a reasonable price and venue is critical.",7,2,5
25,Jerry B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,1,0,5.0,4/25/2017,"As an experience club goer, if you are looking for a great time, I strongly suggest to visit this classy Cabaret.  I stopped by there last Thursday and I had a great time.  The staff is extremely courteous, gorgeous ladies, great DJ and fabulous food. Since I have been told that I am a fun guy, it did not take me too long to get some of these sexy ladies around me and start having a great time.  I had a blast and lots of fun.  This is going to be my new hangout spot for a long time.",,,
26,Jimmy S.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",0,8,1,5.0,9/9/2016,"What a top notch establishment!!! All my friends  always rave about this place all the time. They told me it how beautiful the girls were and how great the energy in the is club. All the bartenders and waitress are gorgeous. You can't tell who is management or security because they all wear sharp suits with pocket squares. They are all so friendly and happy. When I first walked in I received about 5 hand shakes. I was also very impressed with the food. I order a skirt steak. It came with chimichurri sauce It was amazing!!! I saw so many different kind of  beautiful women spanish,asian,western european,american and african american.",,,
27,Alison S.,"Manhattan, NY",323,6,0,2.0,5/17/2016,"There is one very rude stripper. She's either Asian or half Asian. But, in any case she doesn't listen. I was there with my boyfriend because I am okay with that, and this damn bitch sits on him. We both say get off and she refuses, but eventually got off. Then, she complained about me sitting on him and grinding to the security guard, which guys no worries you can pay off. Other than that girl, the strippers aren't bad. AVOID THAT GIRL IF YOU'RE A WOMAN",1,,
28,Philip M.,"San Francisco, CA",404,786,1109,2.0,5/17/2014,"maybe I am just used to the midwest hospitality of the dancers in Illinois, or the charming smiles of the girls at the Rhino, Las Vegas...but I have never felt so uncomfortable at a strip club. My friends and I left after 30 minutes here.*lack of seating for patrons*all the seating tables required a 2 drink minimum*staff was trying to up sell friends and I on VIP bottle service every 15 minutes, even though we continuously said we were ok without it.VIVID, stick to producing high quality XXX films, instead of dipping your hand in strip club establishments.",11,3,2
29,George D.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,409,656,3.0,9/9/2014,"This is the second of the two bar that I experienced during the course of the evening. The first place being Rick's just down the way. See that review for the reason that I ended up here. That bar was two stars, and this one received an extra star for one reason: CJ. She woke the party up. Prior to that, there is a cover charge. I've paid that before. But then I get inside, and there is a ""show"". A ""show"" means that you're seeing professional athletes in their birthday suits either (a) performing feats on the pole that should have Cirque Du Soleil calling pretty soon, or (b) jamming to the music until the sweat drenches the first row like a Gallagher ""sledge-o-matic"" bit. What I shouldn't be exposed to for my hard earned money is a quasi-depressed girl obviously forcing herself to smile while sauntering around the stage and occasionally striking the factory standard stripper poses. Too real. Too depressing. I want the illusion of Fun. CJ brought the fun just as I thought the nigh was a bust. I'm sitting by the stage, which thankfully had a pole on the stage. Rick's doesn't. A few dancers were putting me to sleep, when fffwappp! Hello! CJ does a split on stage that was like a call to reveille. Then she proceeds to pop the buttocks to the music. And she was smiling, because she was generally having fun, or she was extremely good at faking it for the crowd. I threw my bills on stage. And I had to get that private dance.I go to a strip club to be compelled to go broke. But that requires seeing something I won't see if I take my money to a regular bar or dance club. $250 is usually my budget. I'll see nudity by the end on the night. Especially since I'm only nursing a $30 scotch all night. If I'm not getting the memory of sleeping with someone for $200, at least I want the memory of moves that most women in bars are not capable of without running up their insurance premiums. I did get a lap dance at Rick's. The only thing I remember about it was how pathetically uneventful her hustle was. Here at Vivid, CJ gave me a good memory.",2,6,3
30,Casual O.,"Maywood, NJ",0,17,0,1.0,11/23/2016,"Um. Went here on a busy Thursday night. Only a handful of good looking girls. The rest looked trashy. Just a lot of very unattractive girls. Ghetto club too. I couldn't take my clients in there, so we went some where else better.",2,1,1
31,Milana N.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,2,1,5.0,3/2/2014,"Wow!! It's like stepping into a Miami club right in the middle of NYC! Can't wait for the summer to hang out on the outdoor terrace, make sure to bring all ur money to spend on the beautiful girls. The bartender Hanna is super funny and gorg! The place has such a dope atmosphere you just lose track of time. But if u do decide to check out other places around (Ricks cabaret) make sure to stop by the hottest coat check girl jbreezie for free passes!",5,,3

33,John B.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",76,82,9,4.0,4/25/2015,"Stumbled across Vivid after driving friends here from a Yankees game.  It turned out to be worth the trip, mainly because they paid for my cover charge in exchange for the ride.  The women were smoking hot, and clearly were interested in making sales any way possible (e.g., lap dances, massages, etc.) I saw at least one or two tens up on stage; however, costly to be there for awhile.",2,1,1
34,David D.,"Hopkins, MN",0,9,1,4.0,6/16/2015,"Got a free admission card, they said I had to buy two drinks. I bought one sat down by the stage it was fun. The young ladies were very nice and they gave very good table dances. You have to keep your hands to your self but that is Farly normal in a high end place like that. Dance were $20, beer $12. So it is pretty expensive too, but the women were very top shelf.",,1,
35,Kime M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,7/3/2014,This place is horrible. The minute you walked in they force you for bottle service and they sit you away from the dancer. The security guys are rude. they think everyone is under their shoes. we go to stripper club to enjoy god given nature bodies. No customer service at all. They are only made to treat the bottle service clients. We spend over $1000.00 bucks a night two weeks ago without having bottle service and we had a great time. we went again this week the attitude of two security guys are not up to par and we left the place. my friend was a little drunk and took his phone to take a picture of us not the stripper and one of the security guy went on his face..no professionalism. I decided to leave the place and will never come back again. This is NYC and plenty of place to go,10,,1
36,Kathryn C.,"Fremont, CA",14,2,0,5.0,3/4/2014,"Let me start by saying that the decor in here is sick! It's neon purple and pink and has purple leopard carpet! It looks like the W Hotel of strip clubs :) It has a chic feel to it, not seedy, like the other clubs in the city. I went with my man and another couple on Valentines day and we had a great time. There were tons of girls and I had my first lap dance ever! That was fun although I think if rather watch the stage than get dances myself haha. Some of the girls were doing insane pole tricks. I was literally in awe! If I were a guy, I am sure I would be in heaven. Check it out. It's awesome.",5,2,4
37,Chad D.,"Miami Beach, FL",19,16,2,4.0,2/18/2016,"My first step into this place a year ago was impressive to say the least but a year later this place just keeps getting better. The vibe, music, and talent here is amazing and really gets you in the mood to party. They  have such a great team of staff and service i always feel right at home the second I walk in. But let's keep it real what really matters when it comes to a place like this? Well to a guy like me and most every guy that I know of it's THE GIRLS!! You can find a girl from almost every part of the world and that is the best thing about this place is the variety and it's all quality. This would be my top 3 of all the clubs I've been in hands down. Btw a little secret for first time visitors If you check it out and like cigars they have a 3rd floor rooftop where all the VIP's go and a hell of a cigar selection. But you might have to spend some money to get up there it's well worth it in my opinion see for yourself",,,
38,Robert B.,"New York, NY",0,8,1,4.0,9/27/2014,Went there for the first time. The club looks great. All the girls are hot. Music is great. This has become my 1 of 2 fav clubs.,1,,

I just visited New York for my girlfriends bachelorette party and she wanted to go here before we hit the regular club LOL (She's crazy)!

I would definitely come back just to watch the stage show!,3,,2

It is super sleek from the outside and the entrance into the club looks as classy as any other club in the city! When I turned the corner, you can imagine how surprised I was to see girls hanging from the pole! And also to my surprise, I had so so so much fun! The atmosphere feels like a normal high-end club--except all the people that work there don't carry that ""too cool"" for you attitude, which is a HUGE plus.  I found everyone I encountered to be really friendly and approachable.  They didn't treat us differently just because we didn't order a bottle, so that was a breath of fresh air! I've got to admit, strip clubs are not normally my thing (I've actually never been to one before because the idea of one grosses me out) but for what this place is, it's great!! I could see that all my guy friends were having a blast too, so I give two thumbs up!",4,,2
