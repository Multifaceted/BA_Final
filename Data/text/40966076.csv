JOHNSONS totally caught our attention. The sign outside saying DEVILS WAITING ROOM made us laugh and the atmosphere and attitude drew us in. The decor was unbelievable, so unique. They were playing a vhs tape of Alfred Hitchcock's  movie ""Vertigo"" which was playing on a tube TV. There was a a Vintage/creepy vibe going on for upcoming HALLOWEEN. Which was cool! The Bloody Mary,  Kate made me was ""made with love"" and a unique mix of ingredients that made it one of the best Bloody Marys I have ever had. The ""locals"" and the bartender Kate made it a kick ass NY EXPERIENCE!!You must go, maybe we will see you there cuz we will definitely go there next time we're in NYC!",

Then once I got carded and got my beer I went purchase another and she asks me with nastiness dripping from her voice ""whose this beer for?"" Since she'd seen my bf drink from my beer. For reasons (possibly known) she was friendly to my bf. Maybe she need some d*ck  but surely not mine.",

Two dollar PBRs (let's be real here, that's what they're worth), and a one-dollar pool table. A bunch of couches, and weird pictures on the wall. It all has the feel of the basement of that weird uncle of yours.All odd and retro, to the point where paying for the pool table involved putting coins in the slots, and then having to go ask the bartender why only three of the billiard balls came out, only to have a patron grab one of the cues and jam it into the hole where the balls come from in order to wrench them out.

You go in there when nature calls or to do bumps, not to get dressed for your wedding. It's grimy, worn down, and cheap. These are good things. The atmosphere is a time capsule of the late 90s and early 2000s low-paid hipster aesthetic when theme bars were everywhere and every bar had a kitschy beer and shot special for five bucks and rents were reasonable and you could live in NYC and be a working artist or struggling musician or a normal person without a stipend from daddy. I don't spend as much time in here as I used to (I used to be in there almost every day way back when) but I pop in now and again when I work in NYC for extended periods of time to drink cheap PBR and grossly and ostentatiously overtip because I vividly remember when the bartenders would give my friends and I lots of buy backs.",

There's quite a bit of seating here so on a Fri night it was no problem - however really unappealing in the sofa areas. Bar and tables were fine. This place has an A grade rating so maybe looks are deceiving...  Friends wanted to close their tab and head out but the bartender was outside taking a 10m cig break so we stood around waiting till she finished.

Let's start with the fact that it's safe to say this place is a step below a dive bar. The furniture is gross (couches are covered in plastic protectors, which as you might imagine end up disgusting and literally slippery when covered in sweat and every surface is DIRTY. There isn't AC (but a nice tiny little fan on the bar) and the ""wallpaper"" is graffiti. You could try to swing it as it just being a trendy, hipster dive, but I honestly thing that would be insulting to hipsters. Anyway, on to my actual experience here. Came at around 12:30 on a Saturday night and it was PACKED. I assume this is due to the low drink prices and not the ambiance. It was pretty hot in there (due to the no air conditioning in the middle of the summer) and after being there for a while and all of my friends ordering drinks, I started to get REALLY lightheaded. Like to a point where I could not see or hear much. I was standing close to the bar, so I started trying to get the bartender's attention to get water. I said excuse me a few times, but I assume she just thought I was trying to get her attention for a drink, as I'm sure she has to deal with all night. Not wanting her to think I was just being obnoxious, I started saying ""I really need water please, I think I might pass out."" I had to say this three times before she literally screams, still without even looking at me ""DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S YOUR TURN?"" I immediately obviously tried to explain, ""I feel like I'm going to faint I'm just asking for water"" and she literally just walked away. So another bar tender comes up kind of close and makes eye contact and I tell her I've been trying to ask for water. She doesn't hear me and comes up closer, so I said ""I tried asking the other bartender for water. I feel like I'm going to faint and she just screamed that it wasn't my turn and walked away."" This bar tender's heartfelt reply? ""I don't care about that, but I'll get you some water."" Ok, didn't realize everyone who works here is so nasty! Sorry that I'm ordering something you won't get paid for, but you signed up for that when you became a bartender and on top of that, just giving me water is better than dealing with EMS at your crappy bar for the rest of the night. I then overheard the bartenders talking to each other and laughing about it to top it off. Glad to know they thought their attitude was funny. Will definitely never come back.",8

I had been served along with many other white newcomers. Whether her bias was outwardly racist or simply an inward bias is not even important.  The only people who were ignored were my Asian friend and a black man.

I made this account specifically to write this review and warn others about this disgusting establishment and its horrible, disrespectful, entitled staff. Here's my full account:I was standing at the bar with my friend and there was a Caucasian male in his late ~20s standing at the end of the bar wearing black and a black hat. He spoke to us briefly about the music and was singing along. He was alone. I yawned and the next thing I know there's a foreign object in my mouth. I was completely confused and opened my eyes to find that this stranger had stuck his finger in my mouth. I was obviously disgusted and completely taken aback. I wanted to throw up. When I confronted him, he said ""you're not allowed to yawn at the bar"" and acted like what he did was appropriate. I told him he's not my friend and it is not ok to touch another person without their permission, and he didn't seem to get it. He later asked my friend, ""haven't you heard of 'yawn rape'?"" as if that was some kind of excuse for his behavior.First of all, if you use the word ""rape"" to describe something you did to a stranger and you think it's normal/acceptable, there's something wrong with you. I went to go complain to the bouncer about this piece of garbage. The guy happened to walk by and I told the bouncer that he was the guy I was complaining about. This man proceeded to complain to me about how it wasn't a big deal that he put his finger in my mouth without my permission, and acted like I was crazy. He became aggressive and was cursing at me. He told me he was the owner of the bar and that he could do ""whatever he f*cking wanted"". This was not only disgusting, but also terrifying. The bouncer just stood there. He clearly knew the perpetrator, so maybe he was in fact the owner, or maybe an employee. Regardless, the bouncer should have stepped in and at the very least defended me. He did nothing. Completely fed up with this dirtbag and the hopelessness of the situation, I said I was leaving this garbage establishment. As I was leaving, he told me that he would see me in hell. I told him I wouldn't be there, and that place is deserved for pieces of entitled sh*t like himself. He said many things to me that were rude, offensive, and terrifying as a woman. I was on the brink of tears due to anger and frustration. I don't even know what to say. I'm shocked that an establishment like this is still in business.Do not go to this place.

As soon as we walked in, people were pushing around us with sour expressions. Some really shady looking drunk guy almost fell on us and gave us dirty looks. It seemed super cliquey like everyone was a regular. Some dude was passed out by the pool table. Then some other guy walked in, started yelling and immediately removed his shirt. Wtf? Maybe I wasn't drunk enough or maybe you need to be a regular to feel comfortable here. I couldn't finish my beer fast enough.

A woman next to me sitting at the bar told the female bartender and she told the bouncer to keep an eye on him. The bouncer then purposely looked at his phone as if to say ""I don't really give a fuck about this."" Eventually, one of the sketchy guys goes up to the woman who had told the bartender to watch out for him and tries to touch her. The woman rightfully pushed him away. The bouncer came over and pulled the guy to the side. Then, without provocation, the guy screams, ""something something, THAT BLACK BITCH."" WHOAH. The woman became upset and asked the bartender why the man had not been escorted outside. A simple inquiry. The bartender then tells the woman that the bouncers ""know how to do their jobs."" When the woman said she didn't feel safe and how derogatory it was for the sketchy guy to say that, the bartender takes her drink and tosses it in the sink. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK?! The woman becomes even more upset in a ""what the fuck is wrong with you sort of way,"", again, rightfully. The bouncer then escorts both her AND the guy outside!!!!! THE VERY SAME GUY WHO WAS HARASSING HER!!!!! Another bouncer comes out of the back and follows the other one outside. From inside I can hear what is going on.

I liken it to an old, reliable, cheap pair of jeans that you never seem to toss once the new fall wardrobe threatens to force them out year after year. They are beat to shit, have probably got their fair share of rips and frays, but they're super comfortable and you don't give a damn how you look in them. They aren't made to appear broken-in or worn or vintage. They actually are broken-in, worn and vintage. They're real. They're sincere. And in this same respect as your favorite blue jeans, Welcome to the Johnson's is a true blue dive bar. Or is it?Perhaps it's all manufactured to look like some druggie-drab basement hangout from Dazed and Confused, but it could certainly fool the masses. Rather that put in a half-ass acting job for the role it's been assigned, Welcome to the Johnson's goes all method in its part as de facto dive bar of the Lower East Side. The drinks are cheap. The joint is dark. It has a certain musk about it. The pool table and poop-brown couch are as decorative as it gets. And the bathroom sports layer upon layer of graffiti, like something out of a meticulously-built set design. Even the toilet itself has been lovingly vandalized with a variety of spray paints.That being said, you'd be wise not to plan your whole night around Welcome to the Johnson's. Get sauced here pre-game style, or stumble in for a night cap, but making this spot the main event, with its wallet-friendly libations and underbelly persona, can be dangerous.Still, a certain sincerity does reign supreme here, as the following anecdote should hopefully demonstrate:Recently, I dropped in and ordered two mixed drinks for a friend and myself at $14 (mind you, this was a Saturday night, whereas weekday happy hour prices are a fraction of this cost). From my twenty, the bartender gave me a five and a single as change. I typically tip a dollar per drink, so I asked him to break the five so I could give him two bucks. He reacted in such a thankful manner, you would've thought I'd offered him my kidney. He immediately gave me my five singles and then topped off my drinks, effectively turning them into doubles. I tipped him an extra buck. Why does any of this matter? It'll matter when you try and get that kind of sincerity (or naivety, still not sure which) elsewhere in this part of town. Sometimes it's the little things, people - real, forced, or someplace in between.",4

It was last call and the bartender was talking to someone at the other end of the bar. My friend waved to get her attention.

Bare in mind we had been good customers, tipping on each drink. Recognizing murder when I see, I said ""let's go"". My friend continued to stare in her direction waiting to be served. Finally she marched over and asked ""what do you want!?""""Water please"". Oh jeez, this guy is about to have a bottle smashed over his head. I swear I could hear the arteries popping in her head as her blood pressure shot through the roof. I started to distance myself. She reaches into the fridge and grabs a bottle of beer and says ""is this what you want?"" ,pretending this guy did not just ask for water. ""No, I wanted a glass of water"" he said, still failing to fear the angriest look I've seen in my life.

The only thing that keeping this place from being ultra-supremo dive is the old skid-row alcoholic men. (If you're interested, go to this one bar located at E. 14th street. You know you need help when you end up drinking at that place.)Back in the early 2000s I used to come here quite a bit. It always looked like as if it was a crack den for early 80s Heavy Metal burnouts. Drinks were always cheap 'tho. Jukebox was decent. My favorite was the barely working tabletop Ms. Pacman machine. The bathrooms were always gross, but not as bad as Mars bar (R.I.P.)One time either late 1999, or early 2000. This young African-American male started circling around me. Walking back and forth, checking me out. I suspected that he was slightly off mentally. I was wrong. He was very mentally off. He sat next to me and my ex on one of the many broken down couches this bar had. His opening conversation subject? ""I heard white people get freaky when they have sex. Especially white women. They get real freaky, know what I mean?""The hell?Then he went into detail against our wishes, describing his encounter inside an elevator with a white women. About how 'freaky' the sex was. We tried to end the conversation, but freaky-ass homeboy just kept on going. Then he asked how freaky our sex life was. My ex then put an immediate squash to the freakishness. Freaky homeboy must've just got released from a mental institution. So I guess he wanted to celebrate and get freaky over at Welcome To The Johnson's. Other than that, never really had any complaints. Most of the patrons were pretty laid-back and friendly. There was a pool table, semi-decent jukebox, and at one time, cheap Guinness on tap. Basically went to this place for the cheap Guinness. Good place to take pals for some cheap brews. Then I didn't come back for a few years. Nothing major, just found other places to hang out. Early last year, I was walking around the area, and remembered this place. Out of curiosity, decided to see how it was holding up. Unfortunately, not too well. It looked worse than ever. Although the bartender was nice.Worst part - no more cheap Guinness. Now I love me some dive bars. Dive bars have character. This place however, lost its character a long time ago.

I guess I'm comforted knowing I'm not going to go home with a bad case of bedbugs, but they had a serious stank goin on.

We decided it was the couches. Uh, gross. And don't even think about going to the bathroom, unless youre ready to step in puddles of gawd knows what and get sprayed by the toilet when you flush. YES, thats right. Imagine my surprise... I've wrapped my hands in toilet paper so I can hold on to something while I gingerly squat amongst puddles of LES bile, relieved and ready to GTFO of there cause I'm about to pass out from holding my breath and all of a sudden a shower of what I keep telling myself had to be clean toilet water (but its still effing toilet water, no matter how you look at it) comes spraying out of the toilet onto my newly dry cleaned slacks and fancy button down shirt. A little bit my fault for stepping into a dive after a client meeting, but regardless, that kind of nasty is seriously unacceptable.For those of you who think that dive bars have to be filthy to be considered legit, you need to expand your repertoire. I don't mind a little grime but there are plenty of places around that have all the necessities for a healthy dive-- small seedy spaces, pool, darts, cheap drinks, and a 'who gives a what' attitude-- but that don't make you wonder if you might have caught a disease after leaving the place.

That's it. I will sit in a dirt hole for cheap, and this is one or two levels above, as there aren't a lot of places on which I'd actually want to sit my butt, let alone hover over in the bathroom. If you can appreciate an authentic dive bar for what it is, and that is cheap beer and no modern conveniences, then Welcome to the Johnson's is one of the best of its kind.",

(Angle the glass and then let it sit, dear...)",1

It looks like 80% of every friend's basement I've ever been in back home, including the lame yearbook photos on the wall! Cheap PBR's, good tunes, and a friendly staff. The people working usually look like it could be THEIR basement we're partying in. Either way, it's a good time and somewhat ironic to me. I moved across the country to the biggest city in the world, to drink in a bar that looks like a basement.",1

It's too crowded with hipsters searching desperately for some ""cool dive"" in the LES. You could do better. And clean up that disgusting bathroom.",
