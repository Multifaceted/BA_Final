(I just started eating them) just wow.Please be patient during happy hour times- it can be very busy at the bar and limited servers. But overall- I'm gooodddd.,
1,,10/30/2018,588,,"Sylmar, CA",Armen M.,30,3.0,70,"My two friends and I were recommended to come here from a NY native, and it was a nice bar to come out to.They have a Thursday special for beers that was great. I love the mugs they bring the beers in too. They have dart boards and a pool table where you can get the equipment by giving them something as a collateral. The place almost felt like a dive bar - dim lighting and cheap beers. I think they also have a comedy bar attached to it.The really big issue I had was with the bouncer and our waitress rushing to me to tell me I can't charge my phone there. I understand that might be a rule but you can't talk to a customer OR rush a customer like that. They offered me to charge my phone in the front where everyone walks in; I declined since I didn't want to lose my phone.Will I come here again? Probably if I'm in the area but I'm going to make sure I have a fully charged phone.",1

The comedy act was not for me. I was hoping for something beyond taking jabs at the crowd and making fun of different religions, ethnicities, your ""run of the mill"" comedy routine. The show was $20 with a 2 item minimum. I stuck with my Tito's and tonic and ordered some fries which were good. I think we all had higher hopes for coming into NYC for a comedy routine. Maybe next time...",2

I asked to move over and they wouldn't let me due to space and I told them he was being obnoxious. This woman (who wasn't even my bartender) said they couldn't do anything about it even though they work there LOL. Service is awful obviously and it's just an intermission to go somewhere better.,

There are couches near the front of the stage that are close to the action and extremely comfortable. If you sit too close, the comedians will pick on you for fun. Our group of 5 was split cause most seating was 2/4. Interior decor is certainly dark and gloomy. I would imagine an opium den to look like this. We saw Hasan Minhaj here for only $5 and he absolutely killed it! Tonight's show was about affirmative action and mainly focused around Asians suing Harvard. It was a pretty dense topic, but fairly interesting. He was practicing it on us for his upcoming Netflix show. Two item minimum here. I opted for the beef skewers, minimum 2 orders for $2 each, and a bottle of water for $4.",4

As for the bar interesting name to go with an interesting looking place, very dimly lit, dark decor & decent music playing adds to the gloomy interior of this restaurant , bar.

I've been a loyal visitor for almost 7 years and I try to drop by once in a while just to reminisce old times.Amongst the pros, this place magically seems to have all the space to accommodate large groups on the craziest of Friday nights no matter how packed it is :). I don't recollect ever paying an entry fee to get in but times might have changed. The drinks are fine, service is commendable and the music's straight out of your Billboard top 50.

I personally love to dance, but even if you aren't into it- the music played this particular night will make you want to. I believe when we came here we opted for the pitchers of beer (even more cost effective) although my friends had the homemade sangria. I will say this place gets packed really quickly. Although the venue isn't small, it sort of feels that way when there's a lot of people. (maybe table placement?) Although it was packed, I was pleasantly surprised to see the ladies room was clean! Ladies, you know how it gets sometimes. Overall, I loved FBPC on a regular night and am eager to visit for one of their events. Happy hour was great, staff was friendly, and bathrooms were clean. Fun time!",

I always thought this spot was a bit bigger whenever I would pass, but it's quite small like an intimate setting size if that is a thing. Anyway came chilled and did exactly what was intended. The music was ok, the crowd was diverse and was just a chilled spot. Cool spot, would go back to drink and chill.",1
15,,4/22/2018,88,,"Hoboken, NJ",Ashley J.,914,1.0,104,"Steven, the security guard was the nastiest, most disrespectful security guard/bouncer I've ever met. I was with my girlfriend and we just came from the Groove which is nearby and I've been here before and I wanted to stop by even though I knew they were closing shortly. We arrived and sat at a table and no one greeted us or anything (they were closing soon.. for us only). My friend and I were out all day and so she was a little sleepy so she drifted off (it happens). Anyway, I was waiting for a server to come and greet us and then the security guard Steven says that they're closing. I said okay. I noticed that Steven only came up to us to express the fact that they were closing and he made sure that he Hovered over us to make sure we got up promptly. As I am walking out of the door, I simply asked Steven..why he didn't tell everyone else to leave and his response was that they all worked there. Nowwwwwwww that was impossible! The bar was pretty busy. On my way out he said that I didn't spend money so He doesn't care how I felt about feeling targeted. He said I just want to go home and that's why I don't like FUCKING like people and then called me and my friend a nigeress. Thats when I was completely applauded. That was completely unnecessary and unprofessional. This man should not even be at the Fat Black Pussycat representing this establishment in such a way. Him being frustrated with me questioning him is not an excuse to call me or my friend a racial slur (and this man is BLACK, I posted him). I couldn't imagine him calling anyone of a different race a racial slur to quote on quote make a point so why would he do that to two young ladies?! Plus he put his hands on me. Steven is a disgrace to society and should never have a job where he is working around people. Period!",5

Updated review",453,3,"Long Island City, NY",Louise D.,559,1.0,437,"Terrible. Ever since the cellar moved across its like the waitresses are MIA. Where did all of you go, really? Anyway we came here on a Sunday night for pride. The service was terrible. The poor dude behind the bar had to take our order. We had to clean our own booth. Literally like a busboy would. We wiped that table down and moved plates. I should have tipped myself.I was charging my phone for like 40 minutes and a waitress out of no where unplugged my phone the wire fell on her head. Then said I need to charge in the lounge. Um OK? Where the comedy show is and I'm not eating? Then she disappeared for an hour. Its like you ghosted us. Not to mention even when the show was over 3 different waitress came to our table out of no where to take our stuff. For some reason after an hour they felt the need to come over to put napkins under our drinks. We didn't even get asked if we wanted more drinks. Isn't this table service? Or is there no point to your job? Or am I just mistaken?:::BATHROOM ALERT:::DISGUSTING. I seriously would of felt more comfortable pissing in the street. The room smelled like hobo butt sex on a warm sunny day. Not that there is anything wrong with butt sex. But cmon clean the damn bathroom. EkkOur stay just made us not even want to bother to get a second drink. The calamari was good and so was the two sauces we got with it. I'm just a little confused by the ghosted waitress that didn't want me charging my phone no other employee seemed to mind but her. I think she was just having a bad day. But seriously you're rude honey boo boo. The bouncers were nice but you can tell they just didn't wanna deal with anyone. We had to show a passport because an ID was expired. That's fine but seriously why did we have to ask a second person if it was OK? Little confused here. This place used to be fun but now its just like go next door. 3 sheets gives you free WiFi at least. Not one person went over to their dedicated darts section. Some people were playing pool which is in the most dumb spot ever. Getting out of the womans bathroom is the worst when this place is packed.",4

Since there was no table service (on a Friday Night), we had to order at the bar.  Because we were using the discount, the manager had to be called over. There was no manager in sight, so it took roughly 10 minutes after we ordered and received our drinks before we could tab out and go back to our seats. The martini that I ordered was not good. We left after one drink. We went somewhere else and had a much better time, drinks, and service.",1

The service was extremely slow and the Male bartender at the time paid little to no attention to my friend and I. We order 4 drinks and it literally took 20 minutes for us to get each drink. The the food took about 1 hour to come out. He never checked back o is to see if we needed anything or to update us on the status of our order. Then on top of that the bar itself wasn't being cleared or cleaned. We literally sat at the bar and had our drinks and food while the cups, plates & garbage from people who were there before us was still on the bar. INSANE!!!

The first time was for my gf's 21st, the last of us to hit, and it was an awesome night. We booked the closed off balcony area and ordered bottled service.What's great about the place is that it has the club down stairs, the lounge and bar on the main floor, and then the private balcony at the top. So it really caters to everyone's preference of a night out. We all had a great night!Fast forward almost 10 years lol I threw a surprise 30th here. I was constantly on the phone and email with their party planner who helped me every step of the way. Again, I reserved the balcony, with bottles and food.

After getting the rag, I cleaned the table off myself and threw everything away. Finally they told me I had to get up from my table to order my food at the bar. ( why do you have tables ) finally I saw a manager. He said severs don't start Serving until 7pm. Totally confused at that one as well. Basically, horrible service and horrible management!

I found this place online and have always loved the idea of seeing comedians coming in to work out material. Anyone can stop by and it's amazing to see their process. Tonight was excellent. Great comedy, great times and good food and drinks too. I really enjoyed it!My only gripe was the website and how poorly structured and I feel misleading it is. I was enticed by a $5 cover and half priced drinks which I understood to be in the show. I complied with the request of printing the coupon and keeping everything on one tab, but when I gave it to my server he informed me that was for the bar next door. My bill therefore was WAY more than it should have been and I felt a bit taken advantage of honestly. I looked at the site again and yeah, it's just not very clear. It was still a great time, but just more pricy than I'd anticipated.",5

I'm ALWAYS down to get drinks by she said more importantly, I need to order the wings. In my mind wings are wings. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the wings which came with home made chips celery carrots and sauce. When my food came, I noticed the wings were nice and hot and fresh and for $8.95 I was surprised to see that it came with about 6or 7 wings. Can't beat that price. Then I bit into my first wing and i can see why she rants and raves about them. They were absolutely delicious. On top of that, the vibe was really chill, the music was great and it was an intimate setting; perfect for catching up with old friends. I will definitely return the next time I'm in the Village. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the waitress gave us a hard time about wanting to split our orders on 8 different tabs. She told us there was a limit of 2 tabs per table. Super inconvenient but overall the ambiance and food was amazing.",2

We arrived after midnight and there were no crazy lines. Located next to Village Underground is FBPC. We paid the $20 Cover and headed to the basement to party. We hit the bar, bartenders were on point and the line moved fast. We were able to find a table for our party of 4 near the performance stage. Amina Buddafly was performing along side a great band. They performed a few covers and I really loved the diversity of the crowd. The DJ was skilled and played a variety of jams. While seated we ordered wings and snacks from the menu. You can also place your drink orders. Priced right and tasty. Security was tight and they run a tight ship here. I love the interior design, very Goth and vintage.

I didn't get the chance to experience the different rooms but where I was sitting was cool. Tables need to be leveled. One wrong move and there goes your drink. Bathrooms are claustrophobically small. No breathing or turning room. A renovation needs to be in the works.

I didn't try the food, but my friends all seemed to enjoy it. They play a good selection of music. They have pool as well. My favorite part besides the drinks, is the tv in the back that plays a continuous stream of music videos. If you're a sucker for music videos like myself, you will enjoy that. The bathroom is also surprisingly clean for a bar. All in all, if you want to have a good time visit The Fat Black Pussycat. It will be a night to remember, or a night you won't remember...

38,,6/25/2017,19,,"Encinitas, CA",Gabriel M.,0,1.0,2,"I live down the street from the fat black pussycat on Bleecker and Macdougal street and have been coming here for years. I generally come after work or late at night to wind down, have a couple drinks, and play some pool.Last night was like any other night: I walked in, grabbed my drink, and went to the pool table. There were people playing so I asked if they were using the list and they said yes. I put my name up and they said I'd have next. The game they played was super close so they nicely asked if I'd mind waiting another game so they could settle it. I said no problem. There was no one else around the table for all of these games. After the next game they said it was my turn and I proceeded to put money in. Out of nowhere a lady comes up that the security guard knows and just starts racking the balls. I calmly explained that I had been waiting and that if she puts her name on the list that she would be next. She was visibly intoxicated. The security guard sees us talking and without asking questions just pulls me off the table (in assuming because he knows the girl). I explain the situation and he starts getting aggressive and hostile with me for no reason. Saying things like ""I Don't Give a Fuck About No List or Who Was Waiting, This is MY Table and I say Who the Fuck Goes Next"". Just super hostile for no reason and when I was clearly in the right. The funny thing is that at the exact time that he's yelling about him ""not giving a fuck about no list"" there are people writing their name on the list and the people on the pool table complaining that this girl wasn't next..Again I have been coming here for years and we have always used the list system, the only exception to that is if there's literally no one around, which obviously wasn't the case. The point of the list (especially on a Saturday night) is to PREVENT these type of situations. I'm not going to argue about the sky being blue so I simply told the security I didn't appreciate his hostility, gave my bartender his 25% tip (hey its not his fault right?), and checked out.No customer should receive the treatment I did, especially a local that spends good money here, tips well, and is always respectful to everyone. Front door security is always on point but back room security I have seen escalate situations many times, it had just never happened to me personally before last night because I always mind my own business. I have seen people complain about security here for legitimate reasons and management (as can be seen from other yelp reviews) always has a ""the customer is wrong"" or ""they were probably just drunk"" attitude about the complaints. That is why I chose to write a review here as well as sent a direct email to management, we will see if they do anything about it. If you doubt anything I've said please look at the security camera footage from last night at around 3AM and you will see everything I described happen. Besides aggressive security being a legal liability to the business (especially after many written complaints), it defeats the purpose of having good bartenders and a pleasant atmosphere. No security guard should curse at people unprovoked in any situation. FBP is an iconic bar in a great location, I hope they are able to remedy this security situation.Feel free to contact me at gabem@nitrousmt.com",8

A lot of times the couches are reserved so you have to stand around even after hours of shaking your bum bum but people are usually cool and let you have a seat. The bathroom is tiny and there are 2 stalls for women and barely a mirror and sink. There is a selection of cutely named cocktails and the drinks are good.,

If you like hip hop the old school videos will have you reminiscing. Can get crowded but if you grab a booth and are with friends you will be locked in. Tasty ass wings too.,1
47,1,7/26/2015,720,,"San Leandro, CA",Janelle V.,977,3.0,353,"It was my first time visiting New York & my friends and I wanted to hit the town after going to all the typical touristy attractions and we wanted to unwind. My friends' friend who lives in the city recommended this place and the first thing noted: It. Was. Packed. I mean this place was poppin'! So much so that it was hard to get from point A to point B, which we personally found to be frustrating and it was almost impossible to get a drink from the bar....so that kind of sucked. Nonetheless, I do wish I had the chance to explore the venue more, but there was just too many people and time was of the essence, so if I ever come back to NY and have the time (maybe, just maybe) I'll stop by....but tbh that's under debate.The bathrooms are tiny so if you're with a group and want to go, there's a pretty good chance you're going to have to wait your turn.There's a comedy club next door & not sure if this is still a thing, but the guy at the door of the comedy club usually has cards that they can hook you up with if you go to a comedy show so that you can get discounted drinks at the Fat Black Pussycat! Overall, 3-Stars is all I can grant because the vibe felt pretty good only if you like crowds, but it was definitely hard to maneuver. I liked the overall atmosphere and decor though because it was very vintage and was consistent on the room that my friends I were in.Debatable on if I'll come back if I get the opportunity because tbh one of the big reasons we stopped by here was not only because of the recommendation but also because of the name of the bar itself. I mean? Meoooooow!",3

Everything else of the Village's over-the-hill, overrated and overcrowded dive-y, wannabe meat market with only one cute bouncer is, as was my rare and ruined Saturday night out spent there, just terribly over.I did mention it was a rare Saturday night out for little, old me. And I was hanging with my friend of a year. A queen of casual Atlanta native seeking spontaneous excitement and revelry in Manhattan. Regardless of my doubts, I have a long list of Saturday nights that went wrong in the City, we hopped on the subway, gleefully ready to take over bar stools and the world. Fast forward to an hour later, and my very less than gleeful but definitely grown ass is getting kicked out of the lovely side room (look for the rat traps ""hiding"" in the corner) for one of the following reasons:a. being drunk, disorderly and violent;b. punching the glorified waitress that asked me to leave in the mouth, as I'd imagined;c. refusing to pay for the drinks from a place that doesn't appreciate my business and will never see my beautiful black self again; ord. an ""expensive,"" upscale engagement party held by idiots that don't believe in ""Closed for a private event"" signs and/or paying a bouncer to wave off innocent, unknowing non-guest patrons so they don't feel embarrassed and dejected. You guessed it. Even though I wished it were A through C, it was D. The icing on the cake was the same bitch that kicked me out, as I waited for my friend to bring us drinks, asked me to come back into the room five minutes afterwards. Won't be returning, ever!",4

51,,1/13/2017,3,,"New York, NY",Victoria V.,0,1.0,20,"What I am about to write still has me beyond appalled, in disbelief and so upset. I'm in complete and total shock that I feel so compelled to warn others so they can avoid a situation like this. My coworkers and I went for a happy hour celebration at The Fat Black Pussycat. We spent hours there enjoying the service, drinks and food before something totally out of line, something completely racist, something I've never seen before in my life, happened to us. My coworker and I stepped outside where a bouncer told us we were coming out of the wrong exit and needed to head back inside. We complied, apologized and turned back. The bouncer then followed us back to where we came and out of no where began yelling at my coworker. Not me, just her. She's a woman of color and we were both doing the exact same thing at the exact same time. Except he targeted her, came after only her, to yell and scream about nothing. He started telling her she was being rude and disrespectful to him. She responded by asking what she did wrong and without hesitation the bouncer tells her and our entire team to leave the bar immediately. While we were closing our tabs with the waitress, I began telling her what had just occurred. She was great to us the entire night. We had spent hundreds of dollars by that point and I began to feel so upset by the pure racism I just witnessed. My boss and I began asking for the manager immediately. When the manager came to speak with us, he defended his employee and did not listen to anything we had to say. His responses back to us were cold, non-apologetic and he did not seem to care. He said that this man has worked there for 10+ years and there has never been an issue. My response back was that just because there has never been an issue doesn't mean there isn't one now. He did not care that we were a group of professionals or that we had spent a lot of money with them or that we were clearly upset by what had just happened. He basically walked away from us during our conversation and refused to say anything else to us. I will NEVER visit this place ever again. I've already starting telling friends about what happened who are equally as disgusted, and we will be sure to spread the word as much as possible. I do not stand to support a place of hate, racism or rudeness by any means. I'm sure most of you would agree with the same. There are plenty of other bars in the area that I would recommend to go versus wasting your time and money with a place that clearly has a lawsuit waiting to happen.",39
52,,3/16/2016,58,2,"Chicago, IL",Payal P.,97,1.0,72,I'm very mixed about this place. We cameIn on a Wednesday night around midnight. We first ordered shots at the bar and the service was great. The bartender was friendly and fast with service. We then moved to a table and the waitress was horrible. I tried to pay with a card and the waitress said I didn't meet the minimum. So I then left cash at the table under the receipt. We left the place only to be chased down by the waitress who accused us of not paying. She forced us to come back inside and we then proceeded to show her that we did indeed pay and she simply said a sorry and left with the payment. I'm very upset by the treatment of the waitress (not sure what her name was but she had dark curly hair). Who accuses customers of not paying without even checking the table? Such bad customer service on her end. I'm overall very disappointed with the experience because of her.,7

Let's just go to the bar ourselves and get a drink, you say? Oh wait NOPE. Table service only, but she's just not coming by at all. It wasn't even packed! I eventually went around to the other room (which is playing different music - kinda cool actually) to get a drink and bring it back to this side of the house. In addition to the subpar service, the music was odd- a mix of top 40 and semi old school hip hop? Also the speakers were cutting out for a second every 30 seconds or so, so you'll be dancing and then all of a sudden the music cuts out for a second. It totally killed the vibe, and maybe it was a one night issue but it was hard to get into a rhythm of whatever song they had decided to throw into the mix.

Lucky for us, some of the booths weren't reserved until 9PM.Tip: If you go to a late night show, the seats will probably be reserved.

I'm not typically a fan of dive/sports bars - which is all that is really in the neighborhood - but for some reason, I was really feeling this one. It may have something to do with the early 2000's hiphop music that dominated most of the playlist, or the random vintage decor spaced out around the lounge area, or the fact that everyone just looked like they were having a fantabulous time. Also, the hostesses were really friendly and quick to serve. Even with the huge crowds and everyone demanding attention from them, they were really attentive.

When asked she said the table was reserved after 2 and half hours. Which definitely we were not planning to sit there  after how the bartender treated our friend.

The Fat Black Pussycat looks like a bohemian opium den that Oscar Wilde might have chilled at. Dark lighting, good music, and some counter-culture weirdness projected on big TVs give this place a Victorian era deviance. It'll make you wanna not be sober. Also, the staff is dope, the drinks are strong, and the bathrooms are clean.",4
91,,5/13/2015,101,,"Buffalo, NY",Katie V.,173,3.0,110,"The Fat Black Pussycat has a very nice interior. There is a pool table, dim lighting, and a room off to the side with vintage sofas. The bar is very long, with comfortable seating. The entire place is very spacious, when there is not a crowd. I tend to stop here on quieter nights, mainly because it is conveniently located near public transportation. I have never eaten here. I am a cocktail enthusiast, and they get two thumbs up for drink accuracy, a strong house pour, fast service, and thorough knowledge of liquors. If I have more than one drink in a night, they all tend to be consistent in strength and flavor, a sign of a skilled bartender.I have extremely mixed feelings about the quality of the customer service. By all standards, I've always received courteous, timely, and professional service (however, I always sit at the bar - I cannot speak for table service). My ""thank you"" is returned by a ""your welcome"", but regardless of who's working, the individual is usually very monotone and almost never smiles.There is a certain lack of energy and enthusiasm in the conduct of the staff. Having worked in this industry, I can excuse someone for being dead on their feet (I do come in during later hours), or having a bad day. However, this demeanor seems to be consistent among the staff. It won't stop me from coming back in, and I don't expect them to burst at the seams with sunshine or engage me in conversation, but a little more charisma would go a long way. When an employee seems cold or standoffish toward one customer and seems to focus more on others, it gives off the wrong impression - an air of exclusivity of the ""regulars"", or that other patrons receive preferential treatment.My only harsh criticism is with the way the doorman acted the last time I visited. I'm not sure if he even looked at my ID when he asked for it, because he was preoccupied with his phone. He didn't seem to be keeping much of an eye on the place, because he was busy with his phone every time I looked over at him. When I was leaving (it was quiet by then), I told him to have a nice night, and he looked up, but didn't say anything. I GET IT - it's New York, and I'm nitpicking, and I'm old school. And it's his job to be big and tough, or whatever. But as a woman, I do feel safer at a bar during late night hours when the bouncer is attentive to his surroundings, and at least occasionally looks up from his phone to scope out what's going on. (I have been in situations at other bars where a bouncer's assistance has been necessary, so it's paramount that he is somewhat attentive to what's going on.)",3

The bar is always packed which for the bar is great for me... not so much. I mean I like a place that has a crowd but not one that it's so packed you can't move left or right.  I definitely think that a good time can be had if you reserve a section in the room next door with all the vintage seating areas.

She was very professional, and over the next two days we discussed via text what options I had to host a party of 20. I decided on the Moroccan Lounge - which only required a $5 table fee per person, and a 2 drink minimum. Easy enough, right?The evening of my reservation, the majority of us arrived at 10pm. We were welcomed warmly by the hostess and led to our tables. The Moroccan Lounge is intimate and dimly-lit, with throne-like velvet seats and beaded lamps. It definitely makes for a great backdrop for those of you who love to take photos with your friends. The DJ played mostly Top 40's radio hits, but we were able to make requests. Their appetizers were delicious, and their martini list is extensive. The waitress could have been more visible throughout the night, but we didn't encounter any problems.My guests who arrived before 10:30 were able to get stamped for free admission into The Village Underground downstairs, but the woman who was in charge of the side entrance had a nasty attitude with us. There was supposed to be a live band playing, but when we went down there it was only a DJ playing cheesy 90's pop songs. The crowd was older, and it was much more packed. It was kind of lame, and there was vomit on the floor near the bar, so you can imagine that we didn't spend much time down here.Back upstairs, we closed our tab at around 2am. It came out to around $530 for a party of 20, including gratuity, which was a lot less than I expected. Not sure if I would come back though, since places like these lose their novelty the second time around. Definitely a great place to check out if you haven't yet, though!",3

It may look small on the outside but there's a lounge area in the back. I believe there's a certain dress code to go in because my friend had a tank top on and the bouncer said you have to have a shirt with sleeves. So another friend gave him a shirt and then we were able to go in. It is like 6:30 on a Friday so it was pretty packed. At first, we didn't really have anywhere to stand. Then we realized there were seats and tables in the back. I'm not sure how we got ourselves a table, but we did. My friend ordered a whole lot of drinks for everyone. And our waitress was very nice, but a little slow, which was fine because it was a Friday night and there were a lot of people. The furniture in the lounge area is very interesting. It reminds me of like Victorian decor or something. There's a TV that was playing some black & white shorts. I don't really know. Overall, it's an alright place for a group of friends to hang out, talk, and drink. There's also a pretty wide variety of cocktails and drinks.",

In terms of the space, the first room when you walk in has the bar and pool tables in the back, and is pretty big. There's tvs all around, one playing music videos for the songs playing and one playing random, very old school movies. There was a loungy area adjacent, which had cool sofas and seats and was fun to hang out in, but there was definitely no dancing vibe there, (the music wasn't great either) so my friends and I headed back to the first room for dancing. It ended up being that the space was better than the music. A lot of people were just hanging out, playing pool or sitting at booths or standing at the bar, but plenty of people were trying to get their dance on too. The problem was the music was really uneven, and the transitions were terrible. One minute they were playing Daddy Yankee, and the next they were playing Bon Jovi. Huh? I tried my best, I really did, but even I couldn't make it work with a lot of the songs.I have to say it's a very fun, enthusiastic and FRIENDLY crowd that we encountered there though!

When your guy friend sends an email inviting you to a spot called ""Fat Black Pussycat""...you have to question his intentions. Maybe I'm a little immature-- but ""Fat Black Pussycat"" is extremely subjective. BUTTT....Yes. Yes for so many obvious reasons. I love LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Extremely cheap happy hour and 90's jams blaring through the flat screen televisions. I was downing vodka & cranberries as I sang En Vogue to the top of my lungs. The atmosphere seriously gave me all the life I needed for a Friday night. I had a table-- please reserve a table, there's not much room to stand around in that main room. The main room is decorated with a pool table and cheap art (which somehow added to the nostalgia of the music..but maybe i was just way too drunk).  The bouncer was hella nice and it was super easy to get in. Now everything can't be all peaches and cream. The bathrooms are disgusting. I'm talking D.I.S.G.U.-STING! I was contemplating on going outside and peeing on the curb because I felt like it would've been a hell of a lot cleaner. There's only two tiny stalls and they are littered with bloody tampons and piss. But heyy, if you don't want to break your seal.,,,you don't really have to worry. The happy hour drinks are definitely watered down. I'm a light weight. No, like I'm the lightest of all light. After downing 4 vodka and cranberries, a shot of tequila and a shot of some fruity drink..I still knew my name! That doesn't add up!

104,,4/2/2015,7,1,"Rocky Point, NY",Christopher S.,0,2.0,68,"Had a terrible experience here last week. Came here after dinner to sit in the lounge. Upon entering my girlfriend and I were told by the waitress that there were no tables, when it was apparent there were. Luckily, as we turned to leave a couple tapped my shoulder and said they were leaving. Ok, perfect. They got up and we sat down. We waited 10 mins for someone to clear the table. After the table was cleared, waitress came over took my credit card, our drink order, some food, and left. While waiting for the drinks, I watched 5 more parties were sat with no problems. I've been here multiple times and I understand you can make reservations ahead of time; these people did not have reservations. So 20 minutes goes by... No drinks. Finally they come and they're good, like usual. While drinking and taking in the atmosphere, my girlfriend and I watch not one, but two tables get up and leave due to lack of service, outright saying how horrible it is. After an half hour we wanted a new round of drinks. I should've made a smoke signal because anything short of starting a fire in the lounge was not going to get the attention of this waitress; to the point where it seemed she was outright ignoring us. Finally got her, ordered new drinks and enjoyed my company.The rest of the night is uneventful, except the extreme lack of service. However, when the bill finally came I asked for my credit card back so I could pay cash. When i got my change, the waitress shorted my change... Thanks, your service was terrible and you shorted me. Gave her, her a tip minus what she shorted me and left. Extremely disappointed in the service quality since I've been here before and never experienced a problem.

127,,3/30/2015,2,,"Lincoln, CA",Davinder C.,3,3.0,13,Came here for a friend's birthday.  The bar is nice and spacious and has a back room where you can reserve tables for birthdays and special events.  The front portion of the bar felt like a regular old sports bar. The music they played was actually spot on and there was enough floor space to stand with your group without being in the way.The back room has a really cool Moroccan theme to it with a DJ.,

Their drinks menu is extensive and the servers were pleasant to deal with. Music does get a bit loud at times, especially by the reservations only area. We had a huge table for the group and a couple of chairs that looked like thrones (one of which I snagged for myself). Bathroom situation is dire tho- not sure if there was another washroom we could've used but 2 stalls for that big of a place? Jeez. And you couldn't even be slick and use the men's stalls because they have a big bouncer just waiting for you to break the rules. Eeeek. Anyway, you do get to make friends while on line for the ladies' room so it's not too bad.A bit touristy since it's right by NYU and West 4th but overall not a bad experience.",

I have yet to try their food, karaoke, or downstairs lounge, though, so I can't comment on much else.Drinks were in the $10-15 range.I'd come back on a weeknight with friends or my S.O.However, bathrooms were tiny and the toilet was crooked.

I had been avoiding this place for like 7 years, ever since my rowdy friends got us ejected from the Village Underground, but when my friend's 30th was planned here, I took a deep breath and sucked it up and made it.Reality of the place is that it is still a divey college bar. However, I liked that because of that, I walked in with a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and didn't get any grief from a snotty bouncer about how i need to look hot for the ladies. #1) I'm married #2) the ladies love me anyway.Drink service was really good... I almost did a double take when the server remembered who ordered which drinks and was a nice guy about it. I've seen servers walk around with eyes in the back of their skull with how far they've rolled their eyes back, and this guy, and the rest of the staff, just seemed like they wanted us to have a good time. They also do this for every birthday party, but it's still a nice touch... a plate of mini cupcakes lit by sparklers.DJ was pretty good too. Played a decent range of music, but what I thought was really interesting was that he was mixing in the videos too. The TV screens would have the music videos and actually cut in and out with the songs. That's a first for me at least... and I was pretty impressed.We went down to the adjoining Village Underground, the site of my unfortunate incident 7 years ago, and the place has changed a lot (or I was drunk the last time...), and to my utmost surprise, there was a live band there that was actually,,, GOOD. The band took us on a trip through the 80 and early 90s in medley fashion, from Prince to Nirvana, Mariah to Biggie. It was a really good time... the downstairs was packed but it wasn't grimy, we had enough space to move around without getting shoved in the face or the back. Girls also mentioned short bathroom lines too... so kudos to that FBPC.After this experience, I'm more likely to come back... it won't be another 7 years like last time.",

I had first been here back in 2002 with a date that was familiar with this neighborhood, and I remember not liking him, but the place was a different story. I couldn't wait to bring my (actual) friends here to hang out and chat while checking out the crowd. The back room with a Moroccan theme (heavy drapes, velvety seating, lanterns) was the preferred haunt, although I was happy in the front bar or downstairs. I remember this is one of those rare times where I spent $14 for a drink (when I still did) and liked it.I'm happy to say the life span of this place seems to be a long, healthy one, and I can only hope it will be there when I finally return.

They offer billiards and plenty of seating areas. We chose to belly up at the bar and use our half price drinks cards and although it was packed, I tipped the bartender an extra $10 to make sure he didn't forget us quickly. And we continued to tip as long as we stayed--- two weeks I think. There is a long bar and above in the middle of the room is a chandelier about the same size as Rhode Island.

Plenty of seats to choose from although if you're going on a weekend night you'll probably be delegated to the bar unless you're rolling deep (like 5-6 people). The day I went the bathrooms were closed and I had to go downstairs (to the Village Underground) to use them. If you don't mind sticky floors and drunken dancing (hopefully you are the one doing the dancing and not getting knocked down by other drunken dancers), then this might just be the place for you!",4

First of all, they serve you at snail pace, and when I flagged down the waitress to cancel my last pitcher after our glasses were empty for 20 minutes, she blatantly ignored me every time we made eye contact. And to top this off, when I received my bill for the four pitchers I had ordered, they charged me $7.50 for each pitcher instead of the $5.00 YELP drinks deal. I spoke with the waiter and he told me that the deal ends at 8pm - OK fine... But I clearly arrived and ordered my first pitcher at 6:30pm. So his explanation was that the deal ends at the time that you finish drinking... not when you start drinking.Seriously?I was not THAT drunk.AND THEN! He had the nerve to tell me that he'll take the discount off JUST THIS ONE TIME.As If I should be ever so grateful to receive this discount that I had been entitled to this whole time... Ugh!",8

Updated review",491,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Stephanie F.,8,4.0,452,"So I ventured back to Fat Black Pussycat yesterday night with some friends. This time, we took a booth, ordered a couple pitchers and enjoyed some conversation.The bouncer was friendly and seemed to be in a good mood. I'm not sure if he was the same bouncer that lectured me two weeks ago, but he was kind. The bouncer had a little ID scanner, so fake ID's beware!Inside the bar, the server took our orders in a snap. He was very friendly and offered to keep our tab open. I liked the music selection, and the multiple flat screen TVs mounted to the wall, some that showed sports, and one that had the music videos that accompanied the songs being played. The music brought me back with Poison (YAY!)  that had everyone singing in their booths.I think at one point, the manager, or owner came by our booth and asked us how we were. I was pretty sloshed at this point, so I don't remember the exact exchange.I definitely had a better overall experience at FBP than my first time. Their drink selection is HUGE. They have so many beers, it's kind of intimidating. My only qualms would be the slow service and the extremely loud music, but the music bit may have been because our booth was directly next to the speaker. C'est la vie. I'll be back FBP, for happy hour!",4

Additionally, the music is loud but minimal space for dancing.  My friend loves this place but I'll pass next time.",
159,2,9/16/2013,153,3,"Astoria, NY",Steve A.,5,3.0,274,"Getting a drink at Fat Black is like being like Brandon Jacobs, you just have to know what holes to go through to get to the bar or otherwise you may end up injuring yourself. Also like Jacobs, you could be a regular and swear you are never coming back but you'll be back at the Fat Black Pussycat. Bartenders are timely with service as are the waitresses considering with all the commotion they have to deal with. I would advise on sticking with beer as the mixed drinks taste a bit on the weak side. The tables in the center of the room are good if you have a party of six and want to listen to upbeat top 40 r&b/pop/rap. The back area has a pool table and dart board and good for larger groups. There is a lounge adjacent to this in another room which is perfect for a more laid back night with a small group. If you maneuver downstairs, you'll stumble into: yelp.com/biz/the-village…",
160,,10/13/2013,20,1,"Manhattan, NY",Aaron L.,51,4.0,94,Very cool lounge area.  This place is really two bars. The right half is a fratty sports barish place with out of towners milling about.  Over there always feels like trouble is brewing.  On the left half is the bar is a super cool moroccan lounge type place that's great for mellowing with small groups.  The strong contrast between the party atmosphere of west 3rd and MacDougal outside and the lounge is very nice.  It's a great place to relax and have a drink.  The only thing is don't stay too long.  I find that the place zaps your energy and kills the party if you sit around for more than a couple drinks.,1

Whatever, who cares, just go and get wrecked on $4 top shelf drinks. Then keep it simple and order French fries and mozzarella sticks when the drunken hunger pangs kick in. Shimmy shake to the music.

Lots of interesting singles here. There is a pool table in the back on the 'more fun' side. The 'less fun' side is a lot more comfortable. I think that side should be strictly for people who come just to enjoy each others company. It gets live on the 'more fun' side. Lot's of good music, minglin', and all around fun.

Loved the atmosphere there & love black cats so decided to go to The Fat Black Pussycat.  First thing first, we waited at a table for about 20 min before being greeted (1 server for the whole restaurant). Once she finally came to take our order I was ready for my Moscow mule!  Guess New Yorkers do not know much about Moscow's since she didn't know what I was talking about & asked for ingredients that went in the drink. Told her vodka & ginger beer, which she had never heard of. So she asked me what else I wanted because she didn't think they carried that.  I ended up telling her to give me a beer but decided to ask the bartender which he did know what a Moscow Mule was!!  Told him I like the mint muddled so he said he would take care of me.  Drink came & it wasn't even served with a lime & it tasted horrible!! Since the waitress never came back to check up on us I decided to just drink it. Secondly, we both ordered the basic bar foods (wings, mozzarella sticks & French fries) but only two of the items came out. We waited for about 15 min & asked the server where the mozzarella sticks were. Server just looked at the table & turned around & walked to the back area & BAM there they were (who knows how long they were sitting in the kitchen for). Unfortunately, I didn't get to order another drink because the server didn't check on us & were over the horrible service.Basically, this is the first & last time I will ever go here.  They need Bar rescue BAD!

They were playing 90s/old school videos and music which is fun if you're in a nostalgic mood. On the louder side, pool tables and booth seating, pricey weak drinks though :/. Maybe a place to start the night",

176,1,3/11/2013,33,1,"Queens, NY",Chris G.,11,4.0,122,"This pussycat has changed its stripes in the last year.I was in here recently for happy hour and the place seems to have become the new minority hangout spot for after work.  The former crowd has migrated next door to the 3 Sheets Saloon.  Since the 3 Sheets Saloon opened up next door, Fat Black has been trying to keep up with the Joneses...or at least their prices.  Fat Black's happy hour is now 4-8 with everything at the bar half price.  So beers are $3 and mixed drinks can run $3-$6.  There are three locations inside to enjoy:  the front entrance room which is a long bar, some booth seats and a game area in the back (pool and darts); the lounge equipped with Game of Thrones seating and some secluded sections; finally the downstaris ""nightclub"" equipped with a bar and underground jook joint atmosphere.The Music is mostly urban now since the crowd has changed and it gets packed during happy hour.  Head to the lounge early and get waitress service.    Check out the downstair band for some great live music and fun.  If you went across the street to the Blue Note, you would be shelling out $100.....you will not be over your head with the $20 or so you may spend.",1

It is the Mecca of prime time crappy hip-hop and girls in mini-skirts and guys with 2/3 of the way up buttoned up shirts and chains.AND I LOVE IT! The happy hour is pretty ridiculous, the ENTIRE BAR is HALF PRICE!! So if you don't mind Bobby Brown and shitty ass Ludicrous playing in the background , this is well worth the $5 pitchers of beers and $5 mix drinks.Advisory, the Yakitori skewers sucked terribly.

OK the Fat Black has gone trough the some renovation and it is much better than it was.  The drink specials are still cheap and good, but the decor has a less ""hole in the wall"" look to it.  The bathroom looks less like the CDC does testing in it and more like a decent restroom.  The food was pretty tasty even though they don't start serving food until after 6pm.  They music needs a bit of an upgrade, but hey let's just get our drink on right? Good after work spot...I did have one creepy guy hovering around, but I chalk that up to being in New York.",2

188,,6/4/2014,58,,"Chicago, IL",steve o.,0,1.0,11,"Came here after work for a beer. (I work in the industry and 2 blocks away) This was the only bar that was not crowded on west 3rd Street during the first game of the Rangers Stanley Cup. There could not have been more than 8 people at the bar (which seats 15 - 20) and I believe one table in the back. After sitting down the bartender finally acknowledged me after 5-8 minutes. His response was, ""I see you I'll be over in a little bit."" This kind of blew my mind considering I have been watching him listen to a customer,  whom I believe was a friend of his, tell him how to make shots AND drinks. Both of which were on the ""drink"" menu.After he walked away from me he walked to.the end of the bar, waited for his buddy to come back and began TALKING. Not even about getting anot her drink. This was obvious due to the fact that they were randomly laughing and going back and forth for a couple of minutes.  At this point I got up and left. I kept looking behind me to see if he noticed, but he didn't due to the fact his back was to the bar.In all honesty, I know you're a college bar, but st least be professional. There's a reason why this place is the only.empty place tonight. Maybe try hiring people who don't seem under the influence. Needless to say I will not be returning nor will anybody from any of the multiple,  local establishments that I work for.",5

190,,6/12/2016,2,,"New York, NY",Melissa D.,0,1.0,3,Do not reccomend. Very disappointed. My sister made a reservation here for my Bachelorette party because the menu on their website said there were over 30 martinis for $10.  When our waitress came around to take our order she rudely informed us that they don't have those martinis and non of their cocktails are less than $14.  For a place that charges a two drink minimum for overpriced drinks you would at least expect good service. Don't waste your time and money. And they really need to take that menu off their website because it is false advertisement.,
191,5,2/15/2012,581,9,"Wilmington, NC",Mandy O.,85,3.0,198,"Seems like I somehow inexplicably wind up here every 2 years or so. It's the bar you hit after you've been to some other bars, but never the first pick. I wound up here last month with a friend who was visiting and we did get a front couch-ish type seating/table, but I don't need to see the furniture clearly to know that it has not seen a Bissell in a long,long time. Luckily, it's dark as a tomb at all times so you can try to convince yourself that this might not be a bed bug breeding ground.Drinks price is about average for the area, but they are pretty weak. The resident band always seems to be the one playing when I'm in attendance and they play the same mix of songs I've been hearing there sporadically since about  2004. 'Play That Funky Music, White Boy' gets pretty cheesy but you'd never know it by some of the patrons reactions. One strong point of the band though is that they do know how to belt out some latin hits. I will give them a 5 out of 5 when they do Celia Cruz's 'Carnavale' (which they always do) but they do an outstanding job with that. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Some serious salsa dancers frequent this place, though.If you use your Capital One Visa like I did, take note they cut the 'cat' off the end of the name in the statement of your charges. I almost bought a frame because I laughed so hard when I got that in the mail (Wait.....eighty-five dollars on whaaaaat???). Good luck explaining THAT one if you try to pawn it off on your expense account.",8

193,,8/13/2013,66,,"Brooklyn, NY",Michael C.,0,3.0,35,"The Fat Black Pussycat is an interesting character, and draws some peculiar people. The crowd the night I went seemed much older than I, but seemed like it tried to act way younger than it was.As for the venue, there's a main bar area with tables, loud music, and a pool table. I didn't like this area so much, but the lounge to the left was awesome. Like, really really awesome. They have these badass throne chairs to sit in, in this room that looked like it was some old rich guy's cigar den. Dope. The beers were decently cheap, but we got a lot of attitude from our waitress. As for the weird people, we saw a man with a two popped collars sitting in his sofa chair doing some sort of interpretive dance to Ke$ha. Yep, that happened. I'd recommend checking this place out, but it certainly isn't my spot to go to.",

Friday night, the bf decided we should go bar hopping in this area, so we decided to meet a friend here and go from there. We got a drink to start off before finding ourselves a table. We were told that the tables are serviced, that's good, save us the hassle of going up to the bar! The service is really good, our server is very attentive and can easily hunt him down. Drinks are a little pricy, but stiff.We ended up here the entire night before heading to ""off the wagon"" to end the night. I gotta say, it's always a good time when we are here.",2

Can't count how many times I've stumbled out of here. One of my favorite bars, the dj is always jamming and if that doesn't tickle your fancy there's usually live music downstairs for 10 bucks or so.

Good iron lighting display in the backroom and unfortunately it was too late when we found out that the room next door had some nice chaise for lounging and more comfy seats for killing time. Nice bohemian theme as well.Minimum 2 drinks/pp, but somehow we managed to get past that with Dave H.'s charm with the waitress. There was a pool table and a big sign ""Live Nude (something)"" which definitely was fake and yes, it's more toned down than next door. Our waitress was pretty cool too, she took a shot from us. Their menu was kinda weird, as they had yakitori/skewer on their menu, so we gave it a try, ordered a chicken and veggie skewer, they're just okay, typical bar food. I don't know if I would come back since I don't drink, but I think their happy hour shouldn't be bad on the prices. My friend's gin and tonic was about $8. I forgot how much were my coke and my food. Service was good and I didn't know they have underground stuff, maybe next time I'd check it out. Lastly, I had a bad habit of forgetting the -cat in the back, so I often said it, ""Fat black Pussy------cat"", I hope my review didn't get flagged. =)",6
199,2,2/17/2010,780,3,"Brooklyn, NY",Matt E.,1851,4.0,2201,"3.5 stars... I can't say that I've been to a bar before with such a mixed crowd, guess it's the central proximity to the W 4th St stop and the mixed neighborhoods and businesses that converge in the area. I came here during happy hour (which lasts till 8pm) and got a pitcher of Bud for like $5, yeah a $5 pitcher! They've got some great drink deals here. In addition to the bar area they have a huge back room with comfortable benches to drink and/or eat at (I didn't get to try their food yet). The place seems to always be packed which is kind of annoying (there was one bench free on a Tuesday at 7ish and there was barely any standing room left on a Saturday night). They also have another back room that's a really nice lounge with lots of vintage couches. Unfortunately that room isn't open all the time for some reason. The lounge opens at 8pm Sunday-Wednesday and 5:30 Thursday-SaturdayFor people who like games, this place also has a pool tableNot crazy about the crowd here, haven't tried the food, and don't really have an opinion either way about the service but other than those things this place was pretty cool.",3
