0,Marco I.,"Washington, DC",0,8,0.0,4.0,9/17/2018,"Great place for the summer, with a lot of outdoor space, awesome views, and a good selection of drinks and food. It's overpriced, which might be the reason why it was always quite empty every time I went there.",,,
1,Gabriella M.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",39,24,10,4.0,8/13/2018,"Great little spot for the summer with amazing views of the city. There are two levels and many areas for seating but everything is self-serve, there is no table service unless you are eating at the Frying Pan, the accompanying restaurant. I came here on a Sunday about 6:00 pm and at 7:00 pm a band came, it was really nice. Minus one star because there are no happy hour specials and everything is pretty much pricey. A bucket of beer ranges from $35-$45 depending on the beer and my boyfriend and I shared calamari, hummus with some fries. Tasty but expensive. The ambiance is lovely but come for the vibes and limit yourself on the drinks and food.",2,1,2

3,Diyang Y.,"New York, NY",238,88,103,4.0,8/14/2017,"Came here on a Saturday evening after walking the high line and visiting Chelsea market. We sat at the self-serve area.Food: Overall, I would say the food was surprisingly good. I got the salmon dish, and it came with quinoa and onions. The salmon tasted fresh, and the basil pairing was good. However, the quinoa was the highlight of the dish! It was a wonderful base for the protein, and a healthy alternative to rice. It was very flavorful and mixed tremendously well with the salmon.Value: I felt for what the environment was (boat), this was a pretty good value. I paid around $20 for a fair sized portion, but I definitely felt that some of the price was due to the good environment. I felt it was good value though.Environment: If you can get a good seat, it's absolutely beautiful. We were lucky in that regards, and found a place right by the edge of the boat, while being able to see the sunset. With that being said, I could see how you could get screwed in seating, and have a less than optimal experience. Super crowded on the weekends though.Overall, I would come back here. Good place to catch up with friends, and one of the more unique restaurants in New York.",,,
4,Austin T.,"Holmdel, NJ",0,1,2,1.0,7/21/2018,"Disappointing from the beginning. We arrived with a party of 6 and we were not let in as only one of our friends was underage (20 y/o). The bouncer (large man with weird ponytail) was extremely rude and completely ignored us. We were not even planning on having drinks, we just wanted lunch. If you even have one person underage to do not bother coming here. This place doesn't care about its customers, and it just lost a few more.",1,1,1
5,Megan K.,"New York, NY",0,12,10,5.0,7/24/2018,"We ordered fish and chips, crab cake salad, and mussels. Fish-and-chips was so good. The french fries were covered with cajun seasoning and they went so well with perfectly crispy fried fish. The portion was largest out of all the dishes we ordered and well worth the price.  For crab cake salad, the salad was not enough even for one person so we will not order them again if we come back but the crab cake was delicious. Mussels were also very good. The boat shifts a little so I felt like getting seasick at first, but I was fine and we enjoyed our food on the second floor watching beautiful sunset!",,,
6,Avi S.,"New York, NY",12,98,27,4.0,7/9/2017,"Came here on a Wednesday evening with a couple of buddies and colleagues of mine- at first I was a bit skeptical of getting on a boat but I figured if hundreds of other people can do it then so can I. There are a few different sections here with people all over, but generally you can roam freely unless a section is closed off/reserved. When my buddies and I went the only section which was ""closed off"" was the top deck where people had to wait to be seated and order which wasn't much a deal to us. Sangria here was lethal! My buddies ordered two pitchers of them they are definitely well done. Bucket of beers is $36 so not bad at all. Food here is nicely done too- you can have family style to share or individual entrees as well. It's fairly priced considering you're on the west side of Manhattan so keep that in mind. Overall- worth checking out! Nice place to be after work or if you want to be outdoors somewhere with some friends",,,
7,Saila W.,"Manhattan, NY",189,18,99,3.0,7/22/2017,This place is a bit pricey in terms of what you get for food and drinks. It's also really crowded and hard to get a table. The views however are amazing and it's a beautiful spot to impress your date at sunset. It may be less crowded on weekdays?,,,
8,Brandi F.,"New Rochelle, NY",1,30,0,1.0,6/22/2017,"Bad experience. Bad customer service. Don't come here. I came here for a work party. We paid per person to get appetizers. When I arrived (a few minutes late) the vegetarian options were gone (nachos, pizza and hummus). There was some guacamole left but no nachos. When I asked the manager if he could please fix me a small plate so I could eat something for the $27 I paid, he shrugged and said I could go buy something at the bar. So I finished my beer and left. I was there with about 45 other people. We all decided to take our business elsewhere for the rest of the night. We went somewhere where the management isn't rude and actually cares about customers. On a positive note, the bartender was nice.",,,
9,Sarah T.,"Bayside, NY",4,19,15,4.0,6/13/2017,Came here randomly on a Friday afternoon and was not disappointed. Fun laid back ambiance...drinks were fairly priced and plenty of space to stand or sit. We chose to sit on the top deck and we were able to  enjoy the views with the warm sunshine. The bartender was an absolute delight and had suggested spicy margarita which was great. I would definitely go back and try their cucumber beverage!,,,
10,Rica Z.,"San Francisco, CA",229,90,115,4.0,8/12/2016,"The ambiance, not surprisingly, is great. There are little flags and lights strung across the ceiling and large tables that are great for big groups. There is upstairs seating but downstairs seating on the deck is also very nice.The food was surprisingly good. I got the burger which had some nice savory flavor thanks to the mushrooms I added. The meat was a bit dry though and the bun a little boring. I also got the Old Bay Garlic Fries which were delicious. The garlic flavor is very light and they also have a variety of other seasoning on there such as cajun (I think).",1,1,1
11,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,144,0,4.0,7/26/2016,"My roommates and I came for a little Sunday Funday and really enjoyed our time. As you enter the pier, you can go to the boat on the left for dinner (the Frying Pan) or just head towards the back with the tables and bars. They have an extensive menu of seafood dishes and other hearty type food. We split the calamari and fries, which were both good. For drinks, I suggest getting a bucket or pitcher. For $40, we had a bucket of Coronas (6 in total) and the pitcher of sangria is also $40 (it's about 6 small glasses). There is no table service, but there are a ton of deck hands around busing and cleaning tables. The atmosphere is the best part. Especially on a cool night, it's great to sit outside and enjoy the pier. Tables are chained together, so be prepared to sit very close to other groups. Overall, it's worth the fun for the little time it's open.",1,1,1
12,Rachel F.,"New York, NY",334,160,41,5.0,8/29/2016,"Most people know about the Frying Pan, but the bar at the pier may be even better (if you're not hungry that is). The drink selection is really great, but you come for the views of course. I came with a group of 6 and it only took a few minutes to get in. We originally sat ""inside"" because it was os crowded, but then a spot opened up right on the edge of the pier and we were able to collect a bunch of chairs around two small tables. Watching the sunset from the pier should be on everyone's to-do list! Great views of Jersey and great vibes all around.",,,
13,Kim H.,"Newark, NJ",0,41,1,3.0,7/29/2017,"Came here on a Saturday, but they appearantly close the kitchen sort of early so we just got drinks and appetizers. The food tasted okay but was very expensive. Everything is also self-service. The bartender was nice but the drinks could have used with less ice. The view is the only thing really worth stopping in for.",,,
14,Kristina S.,"New York, NY",44,151,131,4.0,9/6/2015,"Decent go to spot if you're looking for some casual food/drinks and great views of the Hudson. It's always nice to come here early before it gets crowded, during the week this happens around 730-8pm. If coming here, I would say enjoy a bite and the sunset before heading over to another spot. If so, try Gallow Green rooftop at the McKittrick which is only a few blocks away.The Frying Pan (because let's face it everyone calls it by this name) serves up decent drinks, the white sangria is really tasty and refreshing. If you're going to go for some food, the lobster roll is solid but the fries are the real star, covered in old bay seasoning. YUM.",1,,
15,Kyle C.,"New York, NY",107,88,40,4.0,5/14/2016,Cool place to grab an afternoon beer and feel like you're on a boat. Basic bar food with a seafood flare. Nice beer selection too. One of the only places I know in New York you can drink on the water.,2,1,2
16,Angelee S.,"Newburgh, NY",192,115,59,3.0,5/13/2016,"This is a great spot to bring a group and grab drinks, especially in the nice weather. The food is ok, but can be very small portioned depending on what you get. The burgers, fish and chips, and sandwiches are well-portioned, the tacos - not so much.This is definitely a place to go for a social outing and happen upon food, not a place you make your way out to just for a bite. Cool place though.",2,,
17,Midori K.,"Manhattan, NY",47,156,182,4.0,9/13/2016,"I enjoyed this place a lot! It was fun! Bar and restaurant are on the liver and ship. Food is just normal American, but that's fine. This place is best for summer and movie night at the next park :) enjoy your beautiful view and hung out with friends, lover!",,,
18,Anna C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,6/30/2017,"The manager: Brent wouldn't let our out of town siblings come sit with us while we ate dinner! Even though they were underage this place doesn't accept any underage people... such a shame! Will not be back and highly don't recommend for a good time! Wish they could have accommodated us by letting the underage have ""X's"" on their hands to identify as underage.",1,,
19,Cathy H.,"Nashville, TN",484,7,0,3.0,9/8/2015,"Went here for lunch and my first impression was that this was a pretty cool space - it is on a boat outdoors (warning for those who get seasick, though the waters weren't bad when I went). Great space for a casual environment.Service is order food and drinks at the bar and self seating. Lunch food is just burger and fries type of deal. I got the steak baguette with fries - it was a little difficult to eat, bread was very hard. Fries were seasoned nicely but overall the meal was overpriced for its quality. My company ordered the pulled-pork sandwich and he didn't think there was enough sauce, therefore mediocre food. But you don't have to tip so that's nice!My recommendation and what I hear is this is more of a place for drinks.",3,,2
20,Pinky C.,"New York, NY",524,482,1140,3.0,8/17/2014,"Awesome spot, but I'm not sure I would come again.  The ""being on a boat"" feeling is only cool that first few moments you're on it.  Then you come to a realization, I'm on a freaking boat with all these people.  I wouldn't do this on land, why would I do this on a boat?!  Hah.  I really didn't appreciate the swaying -- it was a windy day.  I am putting into account that 30 minute wait to get in, even though my colleagues were on the line for me.  I wouldn't wait 30 minute to get on a crowded boat to drink.  I don't even think I need the drink to get a little dizzy, the boat was doing that for me.All the staff were kinda antsy and rushed -- I get that, there were like what felt like a thousand people on the boat.  You can purchase the beers in a bucket or even get a coconut.  The view was nice, but the seats weren't that comfortable -- basically lawn chairs.PERHAPS I will come back to try the food? But will I even be able to keep it down?  I am so sensitive to becoming dizzy that it's not even funny...",2,1,
21,Ricardo D.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,14,23,4.0,9/7/2015,"The venue is great,  food is decent.  I recommend it more of a spot for drinks rather that food.  Food can be a little bit pricey for the quantity you get.  But I overall recommend this place.",1,,

23,Jeri E.,"New York, NY",15,42,4,1.0,1/18/2016,"The people who work here are the WORST! The bouncers are jerks and aren't trained to handle the crowds this place attracts, so as a result they end up pushing and shoving customers. Last time I was there someone I was with was pushed down the steps by a bouncer who was freaking out about too many people being in the upstairs area. I've had my entire purse dumped out for no reason by security at the front and the bartenders are so rude, they act like they're working at a 5 star restaurant and freak out if you don't move fast enough or leave a huge tip. The view is great and it's a fun place to go in the summer, but I've stopped going back because the people who work there are so awful. I've never eaten here, but I know a bunch of people who have gotten food poisoning from the seafood.",2,2,

I came here on a Saturday right as the clock hit noon and it was not busy - within 30 mins the place was packed, so let that be a tip! Get a seat right by the water and enjoy yourself.

One problem: if you're a girl with long hair, tie your hair up if you're going to eat anything (my hair was constantly flying into my mouth while trying to eat and it was not pleasant lol). Food: 3.5/5Alcohol: good priceAtmosphere: 5/5! I loved being on the ship and feeling the swaying (even though i did start to feel a little sick after a while). The view is amazing.

Other than enjoying the sight of young ladies trying to wiggle their way to and from the fry pan without their stilettos falling through the large gaps in the wooden planks on this pier in the warmer months, pier 66 is also the home port for a variety of water sports. You can learn to or master your skills in the kayak, canoe, and sailboat.

What's nice is the Frying Pan restaurant--while pricey, but very tasty--is at the pier. If you're into water sports, you can find that here. If you'd rather watch, grab a seat and sit back. If you're in the mood for a bike ride or a run, there's a path nearby. It's a lovely spot. The only bad thing is it's several blocks away from the closest train station.",,,

35,Sayuri M.,"Maspeth, NY",103,79,79,4.0,11/24/2011,"Came here for a date and had a great time! It's an old ship along the Hudson that they converted into a restaurant. I came here for dinner in the summer and it was packed! I ordered the lemon-herb chicken breast wrap and it was really good.. full of flavor and came with a salad. My date had the burger which he enjoyed as well. The atmosphere is really nice and while it was packed with people, we were still able to have a good conversation with each other. I think that this would also be a good place to have dinner with friends as it is really chill and you can order a bucket of coronas and share it with them. The only con is finding a place to sit. Since I went in the summer, this seemed to be a popular after work hang out and there were plenty of business people drinking beers and eating food. It did take some time finding seats, about 20 minutes. There are plenty of tables with plastic chairs scattered around and they are some what close together. Luckily, my date was able to find a little 2 seater table on the side so while we were surrounded by people, it was kind of private in a way too which was great. Hudson river park is also a couple steps away so it's a great place to take a stroll after dinner! And the wonderful views of the city, Hudson, and NJ are always a plus!",3,,2

Casual atmosphere with a beautiful view of the Hudson River and the NJ skyline. you can catch a great view of the sunset here. Very romantic. However Please note this is a place where you order and pickup your food at the counter and find you own table type of restaurant. No waiter services. Also food is served on plastic plate and utensils(I would have give it a five stàr if they provide real plates and utensils). It was prefect for my family to relax and watch the sunset after a day of biking.,,,
39,Eternanda F.,"Alexandria, VA",219,9,1,1.0,5/27/2014,"Took my mom to ny for a late Mother's day gift. Once she got up the courage to walk across the mini bridge to the restaurant we were greeted by a very sweet lady named Tara. It was our first time so we ot a bit mixed up and went straight to the bar. As we passed another sweet lady, Stacey greeted us with a great smile and comforted my mother in being on the pier, since it was hard enough to get her there! All was well until we approached the bar. The day was so lovely so I couldn't understand what the ""sour lemon"" face she was making. I asked her for a menu and she points upward and keeps doing what she was doing. No ""hello how are you what can I get you"". Then I ask if I can take it dpwn because I couldn't see it. She spat out something about company policy and kept standing there like we would get the menu thru osmosis and hurry up and order and quit wasting her precious time. Then she unravels a ball of paper and hands it to us. Suprise, a menu. We thanked her kindly and her response to our thank you was silence. I said thank you again...silence again. Then she stood there waiting once more. As my mom begin to order and ask questions she rolled her eyes and looked down for the rest of the order...pursing her lips as though taking our order was the equivalent of being forced to clean a restroom. Beautiful restaurant. We were hot, starving, tired and just trying to enjoy the breeze; however an attitude plastered on the face of some bar chic quickly soured the mood and though we cpuld have stayed, there is PLENTY more food in new york city. Pier 66 Maritime ought to have a few more staceys and taras cause im not sure where that young lady came from. Still starving..but folks should know none pf us are obligated to it with your restaurant. ...fix your face and serve if thats what you signed up for....and I promise, we tip pretty damn well ;-)",5,1,1

Apparently a lot of NYers DON'T know about this place as it's rather difficult to get to (not really) and I'm a bit hesitant about writing this review because I mean, duh, I'm so popular on Yelp, why WOULDN'T people be flocking to Pier 66 after reading my review? I just hope the good folks on that docked barge can handle the masses and masses of people my review will bring. The food isn't bad and the drinks are MORE than reasonably priced (6 coronas for less than $30.. IN A BUCKET!!). The best part--hands down--is the view. You can drink on the ROOF of the barge or on the Frying Pan. Yes, you WILL hear drunken people yell out that they're ""on a motherfucking boat"" and you MAY witness someone jump into the river.

There was music and pitchers of beer and a pretty awesome view.  They're open all day long (not just nights) so you can enjoy lunch out on the pier if you'd like, and only during the warmer seasons, but I'm so glad that I found this place as I'll be sure to return another time.",4,1,3

Harvey.  For added interest and atmosphere, there is a train caboose hanging out near the kitchen.Sitting out on the barge while enjoying your food and drink is a really cool experience -- relaxing in the afternoon (which is when we went) and apparently more rowdy when the evening crowd rolls in.  You've got a great view of Manhattan's west shoreline and of Hoboken, NJ and Weehawken Cove across the Hudson River.  I can only imagine what the view would be like at night, with everything lit up.  You can sit back, relax, enjoy the gentle swaying of the barge, as well as any water sports that might be taking place in the river nearby.  Because Pier 66 is also apparently ""home"" to certain water sports and a water taxi, we were able to watch some people playing kayak polo -- a sport I didn't even know existed until this particular afternoon.  Overall, with the barge gently swaying, the views, and the mildly entertaining activities going on around us, we didn't want to leave.Beyond the atmosphere, the important part of this review is (of course) the food itself -- which is great as well.  The fries were only average, but I appreciated two things: they weren't greasy and they had Old Bay (a spice) for the fries.  Having lived in Maryland and acquired a love for the local seasoning, I appreciated the familiar alternative to plain old fries.  My husband and I both had burgers, which were cooked basically to perfection -- medium-well and well-done, while still being juicy / not too dry.  What made me even happier was that you could order not only cheese on your hamburger, but bacon, avocado and / or mushrooms... my favorite toppings for a burger.  They came out on really tasty buns (not cheep, squashy ones) and these were truly the kind of burger that you have to struggle to fit into your mouth -- but worth every messy attempt.  This was definitely the best restaurant burger that I've had in a long time.Finally, my husband was quite pleased that for a meal in Manhattan, it wasn't obscenely priced.  We got away with two burgers (complete with some extra toppings), an order of fries and a drink for around $30... which, for Manhattan, seems cheap.  Others have commented that the price of drinks isn't too bad, either -- so I'm definitely planning to go back for evening of drinking out on the barge!Check this place out -- it gets five stars, both for atmosphere and tasty food!",2,,
46,Six N.,"Sunnyside, NY",0,31,0,4.0,9/4/2011,Had the burger and fries which was very good.  Reasonably priced and a good spot right on the Hudson.  Good place to go with groups but usually packed.,,,
47,Rachel G.,"New York, NY",0,126,0,3.0,5/30/2011,"This place is a lot of fun in the summer, but if you go when it's crowded, the lines are crazy. The main bar is reasonable, but the mixed drink/frozen drink bar has some of the worst bartenders in the city, and I think I waited around 40 minutes or more for some overpriced daquiris. Also, when we asked a waitress if she could ask some people to stop smoking, she gave us an attitude about it (even though it's illegal). The best thing about this place? The view is fantastic and it's pleasant to sit in the sun even when it's hot, since there's a breeze. It's best when it's not incredibly crowded.",,,
48,M R.,"New York, NY",0,32,0,4.0,8/15/2010,"i went on a wednesday.what makes this place great -- interesting space (fyi, its a boat), lots of interesting spaces to explore including a poop deck (ha!), crows nest, aft, bow, and other places to hang out on a boat??, incredible views, great to brings groups of folks, affordable food/drinks that are good (had a tasty veggie burger)what makes it not so great? the crowd is not very diverse and can get a bit rowdy",,,
