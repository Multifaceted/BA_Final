While I waited I got the gold rush cocktail (all cocktails are $15) which was sweet and to my liking. After ordering we got biscuits brought to the table that were very very flaky, light and the best part - warm. To start we throughly enjoyed the deviled eggs $9.Entree wise I will say I liked my husbands double cheeseburger $25 over my pork chop $34.To end the meal we didn't order dessert but they did bring out mini ice cream cones, a nice touch.",3,1,2

But the first 5 minutes of service (while incredibly awkward on the servers end) were good -- delicious burrata, everything went downhill from there. It took us forever to even be able to give our entree order and an additional 25+ min to get our food. I ordered a drink before we got our food and it came when my steak was finished. It took another forever after we were finished (over 30 minutes) to get our check. The manager took forever to have a conversation with and eventually he comped our drinks. It's a lovely place, but not worth the time or the wait.",,,

5,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4794,5.0,3/8/2018,"We stayed at the Arlo SOHO and Harold's Meat + Three is connected to the hotel. We had such a great stay at the hotel and were hoping the restaurant would keep up with the same chic as well as quality.Walking in and being greeted by a cheery hostess, Harold's Meat + Three is an open & airy space. We're seated close to the kitchen. The space is so open I can see the refrigerator with whole chickens marinating on beer cans.I am ""Mr Southern"" and I'm gearing myself up to the fried chicken I read about from past reviews. We're given brunch menus, I see as a menu choice the ""German Pancake""?? It takes 15 minutes to prep?! I'll come back for the chicken, I want this pancake!My wife ordered an egg white omelet with 3 toppings. (Hence the +3) Her omelet? I think there was more +3 than eggs! It was a really good and chef'd up omelet. Even the toast was high end, she was served sourdough. While I'm waiting for this German pancake, the chef sent over two homemade Cinnabuns. I'm drinking some quality coffee, fresh baked goods from the chef, I love this place!Finally, my German pancake comes to me and man is it molto sexy. Its huge, there is no way I can finish this bad boy. It's fluffy, large and in charge. I loved the fruit compote and fresh maple syrup. I was in the zone, taking a pancake piece, some compote and syrup. No 3 breakfast meats are needed, this big mamma was a breakfast treat. I'll come back for the fried chicken. For now, I have met the Harold's Meat + Three German pancake. I loved it as well as the great brunch I had over the weekend.Harold's Meat + Three, I highly recommend a visit.",15,7,12

All the staff is well intentioned and certainty trying hard but no one even knows the menu, let alone how to do anything more than set a napkin, fork and knife. If you order multiple courses be sure to be explicit that you are expecting it to come out as such. You have to signal for everything/anything you might need. I think this problem lies on managements shoulders as the staff seem willing and able to provide great service. They're almost delightful, except for the bartender closest to the lobby.

It's a nice atmosphere and it certainly wasn't packed, like most brunch places on a Sunday.We arrived at 10 am and a few hungry people decided to go for their continental breakfast buffet, which was a little over $20 per person, and that price goes up once their hot food menu starts. The rest of us decided to wait until 10:30 when they serve their brunch menu. The prices are outrageous for what you get. I ordered the Shakshuka ($18) and was really small and disappointing. The dish was overcooked and the yolks were solid not runny. The tomato based sauce had no flavor or spice. I dumped half a tablespoon of salt in it before it had any flavor. We all agreed that the food left something to be desired. The service was very friendly and when they were out of avocado at the buffet the waitress brought a plate to our table. The buffet isn't very large, but they have some nice things like Matcha Chia Pudding, bagels, lox, little ramekins of poached eggs, fruit, etc. they have an interesting selection, but unless you're eating a lot it's not worth it.",,,

We have been waiting forever for EVERYTHING.  There is one fantastic server who has been lovely. Otherwise, our service has been a disaster. At one point I went inside to find the manager to talk with and he said he would come to our table to talk. 15 minutes later he still hadnt come.

I've come here for both brunch and for dinner and I find that the concept, the food, ambiance and service are all a delight.It's a nice additional to the area! I was quite curious as why the name was so particular, meat + three? One of the really friendly guys who works here informed me that it's a Southern thing and that it really is what it says it is... you pick a meat and then + three sides. I like that there are a lot of healthy options here. You can do the salad bar, (this is good during breakfast, brunch or dinner) or you can order off the menu for one of the meat + three. The staff here has always been pretty friendly. I have yet to have a bad experience here- they are also open on most holidays. I also like the openish kitchen. It's a very homey place!",3,,4

Coming from the hotel, the entrance to Harold's was simply astonishing! I loved how they decorated the place. It was very modern yet rustic.The staff seated us right away and I noticed that they had an open kitchen. I love open kitchens so it was a nice surprise! The menu offered a lot of dishes and they all seemed delicious. I realized why its called Harold's Meat + Three because each dish offered a protein such as steak or fish and 3 different sides that went along with it.My friend got the breakfast platter which included an enormous amount of food and I stuck with the Salmon + 3 dish. The food looked incredible once it arrived and everything tasted extremely fresh and well seasoned. I really enjoyed my sauteed spinach and salmon and my friend really enjoyed his breakfast platter. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm ever in the area again!",1,,

Highly recommend the Meat + 3 Option. For breakfast we had the buffet and it was everything you'd hope for a crafty upscale buffet. We put together bagel and lox, are crispy bacon and dipped in delicious coffee. It's a perfect stop off for the weary traveler.",1,,

19,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",639,413,1077,2.0,8/27/2017,"Expensive and the food is not good. Sunday brunch:Entree comes with 3 sides, plenty of choices (mac n cheese, broccoli rice casserole, sweet potatoes, grits, French fries, various veggie sides, etc). Most entrees cost $20+.They have a special hot dog special for each day of the week. Brunch menu also includes sandwiches, salads, drinks. There's coffee alcoholic drinks such as a breakfast dessert coffee, White Russian, and Irish coffee. All were pretty strong. The mimosa had a weird taste to it. The sangria was pretty watery, has slices of canned yellow peaches in it. The venue is fairly big and is really cute inside, it's a 50s diner vibe with a southern charm. Service is also very friendly. There's a market bowl you can get for $21 with your choice of 3/4 things you want in it. My friend got salmon, Quinoa, sweet potato. The French toast sticks are not good. The egg is overwhelming in it and it's not good on its own, you really need to dip it in the maple syrup. The avocado toast is decent, probably my favorite plate out of all. For sides, I chose the biscuit (has corn bits in it), the broccoli rice casserole, and the mac n cheese. I thought all were pretty bad.. I didn't take more than a couple bites out of all of these. The mac n cheese and the casserole has an overwhelming taste of artificial cheese. The biscuit isn't good either, not warm and the corn bits inside don't really aid in making it any better. For dessert, they bring a tray of options including a double chocolate cake, a coconut cake, cookies, and a funfetti cake. The cake is fine, nothing shocking. The cookie looked old and the coconut cake tasted like it had been out for a while. I won't be back, think the fact there was no one else in the restaurant should have been a sign.",2,1,

I figured I'd order an app, the grilled octopus, and if they don't get that right then I bounce. No harm done. But it was on point!So, I continued by ordering the whole black bass.  Amazing! I even tasted the mac + cheese, which was like WHOA!  I mean, the pasta was still al dente, which RARELY happens.Carmine was the server and she was lovely.

22,Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",495,794,740,3.0,6/4/2018,"Came here after being denied at the rooftop. Quality of food and drinks are very good. The service is slooooooooooooooooow. It took FOREVER to get a complete drink order finished. I ordered three drinks. I had to sit and remind the bartender to make each one, when all I wanted her to do was make my three drinks so I could take them outside...I had to say, ""where is the beer?"" and ""where is the margarita?"" And the bartender asked me ""are they here yet?"" I'm like ""yes, they are outside and I would like to bring to them."" She was like ""oh, I didn't realize you wanted to bring them outside."" How about you just worry about making the drinks when I order them vs worrying about where the people are...it took FOREVER to just get a round of drinks. Then we ordered some appetizers. We needed extra bread to go with our heaping pile of DELICIOUS chicken liver mousse, seriously tasty AF. And also the deviled eggs are legit too. But we needed extra bread for the mousse and we needed to ask more then three times for it as well as have at more than one waitress come over and say bread was on its way nearly 5 times. Are you kidding me? It's freaking bread. So we just kinda sat there waiting and waiting for them to come...but slow as molasses again. Yes, they have great food and drinks, but speed up people. People actually want to eat and drink and not just sit there thinking about it.",2,1,1

My friends were staying at the Arno hotel so we hit this restaurant 3 times in 3 days - different people trying different things. All DELICIOUS! If you're in the area I highly recommend. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was the server we had on the first night was unfriendly and didn't even attempt a smile. She also seemed a bit ""hard of hearing"" if you know what I mean. The other servers were good to great. Also, be sure to check out the tents in the back.",,,

We couldn't get our waiter's or anyone's attention. It's challenging when it's busy at a place but it's also challenging when it's too empty (our case due to bad weather). We dined on a special foie gras starter and then explore another app with egg. We realized much later that we didn't need apps as each main dish comes with three sides. Our main entrees were lamb, lobster, and steak. All were very well prepared. Although this was interesting to explore, it's not convenient as it's very west.",,,
25,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64808,5.0,9/22/2016,"Harold Moore's new spot is good like all his other ones have been, so hopefully this one sticks around a little longer than his last extremely short-lived spot on the Upper West Side.This one is a take on the traditional ""meat & three"", in which you choose an entree and three sides to go with it. Their are three different grades of entrees available, going for $19, $29 or $39, with six choices in each section, so there's a pretty good selection of anything you can think of. There are also 19 sides, so you can mix and match quite a bit. You can also get just the salad bar for $25, or add it on to your meal for $17 extra. It looks pretty substantial, with all you can eat shrimp and salmon among lots of different veggies, so it might a be a good choice too.They start you off with an excellent biscuit, piping hot and buttery, so no need for the supplied butter. For my entree, I went for the Fried Chicken ($19), and chose the Mac & Cheese, Broccoli & Cheese Casserole and Grilled Asparagus for the sides. The chicken consisted of 5 or 6 small pieces of all different parts of the bird, including the tiniest little drumstick I've ever seen. It was pretty salty, but all super juicy with nice and crispy skin. The Mac was the really cheesy almost soupy kind which I'm not the hugest fan of, but still tasted pretty good. The others were fine too, but I feel like I should've gone with the devil on my shoulder and just ordered all beige so I could try the fries. Next time.For dessert, it's either Coconut Cake or Birthday Cake ($12 a slice). I went with the birthday, which they serve with a lit candle atop a nice, huge slice. The cake is excellent, but it would be nice if it were a bit smaller and maybe under the $10 price point.Located inside of the Arlo Hotel, it's a beautiful space with high ceilings and beautiful decor. I'd definitely come back more of the entrees and maybe the salad bar if I'm not going somewhere else after for dinner.",15,9,15
26,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",418,354,3232,4.0,10/5/2016,"I'm super excited that I saw this on Yelp and that a friend and I decided to come by for lunch today. The space itself is beautiful. There's exposed brick, open seating, great lighting and everything is new, sleek & clean. We sat at a high top table by the window. At first we found the menu a little confusing. No one explained (and I didn't read Yelp reviews before coming) that you choose a meat entrée and then 3 sides are included... We felt a little dopey after she explained that, as that's exactly what the restaurant is called. But, the upgrades come separate (so, they won't add bacon directly to the burger). The lunch menu is really good. You can do a salad bar for $16 (or $11 if you add it on to your meal). We both decided to do burgers and postpone a salad bar trip. The burgers were GOOD. They don't take cooking preferences (my burger was like medium), but the two patties were cooked perfectly. The bun is soft, the cheese is melty, there's pickles & diced onions, ketchup and mustard. A really tasty burger. The sides were awesome. We had fries, Mac & cheese, asparagus, string beans & coleslaw. The fries were perfectly cooked wedges that weren't overly oily. You get a sealed mini ketchup to accompany your fries. The Mac & cheese was perfectly creamy. The asparagus & string beans were also super flavorful. Our service was a slow and the waitress was clearly still learning the menu- but they've only been open for 3 weeks, so it's excusable for now. :)  We will definitely be back with coworkers & friends!",4,3,3
27,JJ M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,14,1,1.0,11/14/2017,"We decided to ignore the Yelp reviews after a long day of trade shows and work in NYC yesterday. We were tired and cold and figured well, it's in our hotel... it can't be that bad. Wrong. Worst meal I've had in NYC ever.  The drinks were AWFUL, my wedge salad had so much dressing on it that you couldn't taste any of the ingredients. I got a side of mac n cheese to go with it, and that just tasted like Velveeta cheese sauce.  My coworker got the ""hot chicken"" Monday night special, and was also very disappointed.  The only thing that wasn't gross was the biscuits. However, ALL our food came out at the same time (why?).We also had 3 different servers (again, why?) during our meal, and the one who finally came to clear our plates could tell we weren't happy. She offered us complimentary dessert, which was nice of her - but I didn't really want to eat anything else there.  Within an hour I was sick throwing up that wedge salad in my room. I'm honestly still surprised that food this bad would be at a hotel restaurant in NYC.  To pay such high prices to end up throwing up your food is unacceptable. Never again!",1,2,

Promptly seated and greeted by the waiter, who was friendly and explained the entire menu to us. The atmosphere is cool, it's a brand new restaurant and everything feels fresh and open. There is plenty of seating inside and a limited outdoor seating area. The food is pricey, however, you get three sides with any entree, which makes up for the price. I had the Fried Fish Sandwich and it was quite amazing and didn't make me feel full afterwards. Totally recommend for brunch or lunch, have not tried the place for dinner yet, but will update when I do.",,,
29,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,3.0,4/6/2017,"KenScale: 7.5/10One of the more underrated restaurants during my culinary journey in the Big Apple was Commerce, which had pleasantly surprising dishes here and there displaying chef Harold Moore's penchant for richness of American fare. To my great sadness, Commerce was closed a couple of years ago. After a short hiatus, chef Moore decided to come back in a more casual setting inside the new Arlo hotel in downtown Manhattan. This time, the concept was more of a cafeteria setting where you get to choose one entrée along with three sides. It sounds Southern but I would say it is more an eclectic mix of traditional American dishes; in any event, I didn't quite have the same memorable experience I had had at Commerce when I recently visited with my fiancée.Before the main dishes, we ordered spicy ricotta toast to start the meal, which was serviceable but not particularly impressive. Chef Moore was known for cooking some mean meat dishes so I was really hoping that they could surprise me. Unfortunately, both meat dishes felt short of our expectations. The good part: the seasoning of each meat (we ordered a rack of lamb and NY strip) was properly moderated so we can focus on the textural element. The bad part: the said texture was at a surprisingly underwhelming level. We asked the server to bring both meat dishes in medium rare, which some steak pundits say is the ideal state of a meat's temperature to taste the flesh with an ideal texture. I saw that the meat dishes came out with red color in the middle (often a good sign), and yet they tasted tougher to chew than I had imagined. Of the two, the lamb was marginally better for me, while my fiancée gave a slight edge to the NY strip. The sides that we ordered were a mix of the good and the bad too. Of these, my favorite was the brussels sprout salad that displayed a ton of crunchiness and aptly neutralized the taste of meat. Crushed cauliflower and shishito peppers were also fine, while French fries and potato salad were largely forgettable. For dessert, we shared a delicious banana pudding that somewhat helped mitigate the underwhelming meat dishes.Getting a reservation at Harold's Meat + Three isn't that difficult, although it got quickly packed in the course of our dinner with what we believed to be mostly crowds staying at the hotel. The vibe of the dining space is that of a typical downtown hotel restaurant with casual vibe amenable for large parties. I did like the cocktail selections from the restaurant a lot, so order one or two from the menu. It is often hard to live up to your first accomplishment in the second venture. I understand that Commerce and Harold's Meat + Three are not really the identical concepts, but I will certainly miss the former even more after the experience at the latter.",2,,2

34,Amanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,110,129,4.0,2/28/2017,"Look no more for classic Southern food with a modern and trendy twist. I came by for lunch on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised. The interior was lovely with lots of natural light and a modern twist on retro decor. Overall really great ambience and a great place to catch up with friends or grab a bite. The classic meat and three is a great way to sample as much as you can of their expansive menu. For brunch, they offer breakfast favorites like French toast sticks and shakshuka in addition to meats such as rotisserie and salmon, all with 3 sides of your choice. To start, they have biscuits, although they were a bit dry and not very flakey. I was in a ""treat yo'self"" mood and opted for the fried chicken with potato puree, grits, and green beans almandine. My boyfriend ordered the stewed tripe with mac and cheese, green beans almandine, and the broccoli rice casserole. Everything was tasty, but also way too salty, the green beans especially. I do commend the fried chicken for being very light and crispy (as light as fried chicken can be) but why did they have to sprinkle extra sea salt on top? I also appreciated the tabasco honey and the gravy that it was served with. Service was polite, but we did feel a bit rushed because it felt like the server approached us constantly to ask if we were done with our meal. Don't be fooled! The portions look small in the little bowls but the meal was actually quite filling. They were really nice about giving us boxes to pack our leftovers to go.

36,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,554,265,4.0,2/13/2017,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. First off, the space is really beautiful, open and airy. It's especially nice during the day and during the meal I felt like I was outside of the city somewhere - it was a nice escape.The premise of this place is that you order a protein and then choose three sides to accompany it. It's a pretty straightforward menu in that sense, but there are so many great choices for sides! I'd recommend getting different sides than your friends and sharing them. Between my wife and I we tried six sides: mac n' cheese, crushed cauliflower, grilled broccolini, green beans almondine, japanese sweet potatoes and sliced avocado.All of the sides were delicious. My favorite were the sweet potatoes and green beans almondine. The japanese sweet potatoes are not something you see on many menus so I had to get it. Japanese sweet potatoes are less sweet and more savory than traditional sweet potatoes. The green beans almondine is green beans sauteed in almonds, garlic and butter. That's a winning combination to sautee any vegetables in.For protein I had the fried chicken - it is top notch! The batter is flaky, thin and flavorful. The chicken was not overcooked and remained super juicy. They served it with two sauces: gravy and spicy honey. The spicy honey was so great that I wanted to take a shot of it. Harold's Meat + Three is a great brunch spot that pairs a laid back lounging atmosphere with excellent food.",2,1,

Of course we came for the food and everything was delecious. The sauces were well balanced and all of the food is cooked fresh (not frozen) so it behoves you to order appetizers like the succulent kosher ""pigs in a blanket"" with Dijon or the crispy ""fried pickles"" with spicy ranch to start off and allow the kitchen time to prepare the entrees which came out perfectly timed. We also started off with the ""warm biscuits"" that had cheddar, onions, scallions, and... you name it in them and were to die for. We recommend ordering the ""Plat du Jour (plate of the day)"" which is their daily entree special which changes depending on the day of the week.By the time you enjoy the complimentary desserts you will be leaving sated with a smile on your face!Full marks to Harold's Meat & Three!!!",,,
40,Seby I.,"Manhattan, NY",2,17,78,3.0,10/9/2017,"Four of us recently celebrated a birthday. Chef Harold McGee's meat-centric restaurant was surprisingly slow on this Saturday evening. The menu is Southern inspired and has entrées which are in the high $20+ range which is accompanied by a choice of three sides. There are a lot of sides to choose from. Tina and Marilyn ordered the ribeye which arrived sliced. Between them they had ordered the cheese dumplings, potato purée, blistered shisito peppers and sautéed spinach. Vicki had the fried chicken and I ordered the spice crumbed pork chop that was chili hot. I had the grits which was rather plain, sautéed broccolini and the shisito peppers. Two cocktails were good and so was the rosé. The cheese biscuits were similar to popovers abs were delicious.Dessert disappointed. When two large slices of cake with candles are placed in front of renown pastry chefs, the cake has to be superb. Alas.....it was quite the opposite. Dense and hard, we were throughly sad. I think our dismay must have gone across because we then were given twice four mini softened sprinkled with birthday sprinkles. Now these were a dream! The service here was slow and communication confused. Our drinks took a long time to arrive even after two servers asked us if we wanted drinks. This was inefficient even though the restaurant was three quarters empty. Our food also took time to arrive despite the five line cooks working tireless in front of the kitchen.This dinner was expensive and I  not sure if any of us will return.",,,

So the server said i should wait for the manager.

The good:-- Servers and host are very friendly and patient.-- Ambiance is great.The bad:-- Food took forever, despite the restaurant being 30% full on a Saturday afternoon.-- Food wasn't worth the wait.-- Portions are absurdly small.The market bowl with Japanese rice, sweet potatoes, spinach and a sunny-side up egg was so bland I had to add ketchup to give it some flavor (and I usually avoid ketchup like the plague). This dish definitely wasn't worth the $15 price tag.My 11-year-old had the avocado toast, corn, potato rosti, and spinach. Avocado toast was the best thing on her plate...everything else was (again) absurdly small and (again) not worth the $18 price tag. She was starving after lunch if that tells you anything.My cousin had the Shakshuka, which was good, but the accompanying cucumber salad was miniscule. She also had the corn and mac n cheese which she said was good (I didn't taste these).Maybe this restaurant is still working out it's kinks? I doubt we'll return.",8,1,2

The new Harold Moore venture like many hotel spots embodies a very high standard in NY dining. The light, bright spot is open & airy  with the sensational smells wafting over as you enter the restaurant. I went for brunch and there are so many delectable options, but I read about the salad bar. Salad bars were popular in the late '80's early 90's in many chain restaurants, but this is no ordinary salad bar.$16 for a curated super salad bar. Poached shrimp, smoked salmon, beets, turnips, tomatoes, figs, cauliflower and roasted peppers. So many delicious surprises like turnips which I thought were potatoes. Love the variety of lettuces. The housemate chicken liver is an acquired taste, but well done for sure, served in Mason jars. The location is a little tricky to get to, but the hotel is a welcome after meal treat and the healthier Southern fare will call me back again.",3,1,3

49,Lauren S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/27/2017,"I went here for Thanksgiving dinner but took a few days to write this review, not wanting to post something in the heat of the moment.  Before drafting this I asked myself ""was it really that bad?""  Well, after careful reflection I can honestly say that it was worse.  We made a reservation for 6:15 and showed up a little early, partly because we were excited but mostly because we were starving.  As soon as we walked in the door it was obvious they had overbooked as the entrance was blocked not only by stacks of boxes but also with a line of hangry patrons.  We made our way to the front to check-in where we were told by security that everyone with a reservation had to wait in the hotel lobby.  The relief that we were going to skip the chaos of the restaurant was short-lived when we were ushered into an overcrowded seating area full of disgruntled, not so soon-to-be diners.We waited patiently for 30 minutes before heading back into the restaurant for an ETA.  The crowded seemed to have doubled as more people arrived but those who'd been waiting still weren't seated- I overheard several customers complain they'd been there almost 2 hours with a reservation.  Harold and his wife were at the front but rather than offering their sincerest apologies for the wait or complimentary drinks (even a glass of water would have been nice) they were berating their patrons, shouting to ""either wait patiently or just leave."" They took no ownership for their lack of preparation or poor management, instead blaming those already eating for taking too long to finish their meals.At this point it was too late to find another place so we stuck it out hoping the food would make up for the inconvenience.  When our name was finally called an hour and a half after our reservation time had passed, we asked the women who seated us (we later found out she was one of the owners) if they were offering complimentary drinks for the wait. She rudely snapped ""No!"" before adding that we ""catch more apples with honey,"" whatever that means.The food arrived shortly after- thanks to our waiter who was lovely and the only redeeming part of this awful experience.  We hadn't eaten all day in preparation for a feast so by this time we would have eaten anything- except this food.  The turkey was dry and the sides were either completely devoid of flavor or reminiscent of microwave tv dinners. We declined the waiters offer to pack up the leftovers and left deflated with our stomachs as empty as our wallets.",1,1,

My friend's fried chicken was a small portion. I had some of my friends sauteed spinach which I also enjoyed.  We were stuffed and opted out of dessert but they brought cute mini ice cream cones out which was just enough sweets for me.Now on to the fashion and ootd part of this fashionplate.  The restaurant was eerily empty on a Thursday evening.  There were a few families and one couple one a date and a group of girls and that's it.  You definitely can dress down here, more of family type of place.  I would come back for brunch or with friends who have kiddies, the grub was pretty good.",2,1,2

You can go for brunch or get the salad bar...if you're a psychopath. No but really, don't get the salad bar. I'm serious.Among many other things (we were a large group), we got Roast Chicken ($26), Prime Rib ($39), Branzion ($29), and 5 sides ($26). Side dish highlights: Brussels sprout salad, cole slaw, potato puree aka mashed potatoes.We didn't get any of the extra sauces, but the table next to us did and seem extremely satisfied. If I didn't make this clear already, I don't think you should get the salad bar.The restaurant was relatively empty, perhaps due to the less-than-deal location. I should note that I got on the subway going the wrong direction on my way (I'm a creature of habit, give me a break dude), so maybe the location is actually not that bad.

Lots of options, interesting dishes and classic favorites alike. Love it.FOOD is good, though needs some refinement. If anything, i think they suffer from the huge menu and could focus on a few things. We had:Warm biscuits- A little doughy, probably because they were full of corn and cheese. Wont lie: I ate them, but I'm a picky biscuit-eater. Could be flakier.Chicken and dumplings- starchy and simple in a very pleasing way.Fried chicken- decent, but weirdly bland breading. They give you some spicy maple syrup and some KILLER mushroom gravy to dip, so that helpedMac and cheese- has that aggressive tang of super processed cheese. a pure dose of nostalgia.Brussels sprouts salad- a little sweet, but goodFarotto- As in farro risotto. Maybe the best thing I ate? I want to make this. Creamy, with parmesan and really heartyJapanese sweet potato- some kind of butter-wine glaze. Rich and satisfyingGreen beans almondine- it takes a brave man to willfully overcook a green bean. I appreciate the commitment to the throwback concept, but these were kind of grossTons of leftovers though. It's all kind of heavy starchy, in a good way, but there's only so much you can eat!The AMBIANCE and SERVICE were kind of a mess.First of all, there was a huge subwoofer under the banquette so the entire time you feel like someone is kicking you in the butt. It was totally nauseating. The space is kind of neat and open. Way less crowded then Commerce, chef's over-crowded previous restaurant. Service was ok, more weird. They were clearly training a bunch of new people, which they should have just said, because there were several times that trainees were kind of awkwardly shadowing someone and not being helpful, made it unclear who I should talk to.

The food is closer to 4 stars but the service and few other mishaps brought my review down to 3. We had a party of 14 people and arrive a little before our reservation and were seated immediately. As we sat down they notified us that any part over 7 will be a fixed price of $44 a person. We were all very surprised since each meal is under $20 (and are relatively big servings so we could have split dishes). So it more than doubled the price we were expecting to pay and we hadn't even ordered anything yet. I would have liked that to be written on the website/menu/ told to us when we made the reservation so it wasn't such a surprise. Service: the service overall was good - the restaurant was mostly empty other than for our table so that made it better. They brought the food out at a good speed given we were 14 people. But we had to keep asking them for water and other food items that were included with out meal (ie. Biscuits). It also took a while to get coffee/tea. Food: with the price fix we got to order 4 mains and 6 sides. Mains -Avacado omlet: good - basically egg white stuffed with avacadoBacon omlet: also good but VERY saltyFried chicken: comes with maple syrup and (what I think was) mustard - the chicken was relatively dry and not my favorite French toast: crispy on the outside soft on the inside. Among the better french toast sticks I've ever had.Sides: Broccoli rice: mostly cheesy rice with a few pieces of broccoli good but I wish it has less cheese and rice. Mac and cheese: YUM definitely recommend. Very cheesy French fries: salty potato wedges were god but nothing AMAZINGSquash: came with 3 pieces about half an inch thick and 3 inches in diameter,  nothing specialSpinach: big pieces of sautéed spinach. Very goodCauliflower: it was basically pureed - I didn't think it had much of taste but others at the table enjoyed it Sweet potatoes: came with a few pieces of sweet potatoes over a sauce - nice presentation but taste was nothing specialWould I come back here with a large group? Probably not - I don't think it was worth $44+tax+tip per person (aka about $60)Would I come back here with less than 7 people? Yes!

60,Raghav S.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",33,3,0,2.0,2/13/2017,"Was a big fan of Commerce so tried out Harold's this weekend with a group of four friends. Unfortunately, I think they will have a tough time making it past a few months.Let's get the food out of the way. Everything is fine to good though not what you'd expect given Harold's Commerce background. There's significant inconsistency between portion sizes. A friend got the daintiest fish possible, another got a smallish steak and another got a whole pig (ham steak)! The good thing is once you add in the +3, its an overwhelming amount of food.Now for the bad part. Service is atrocious. Its almost like they are running a reality show ""Never worked in a restaurant before"". A sampling of what we experienced: No drink order took less than 30 mins to fill (even just a Diet Coke) and it took several promptings/reminders each time to finally get something. They struggled to remember what we ordered (even if it was one thing) and would keep coming over to check if we still wanted it. When taking our food order, our server mentioned ""You really should have appetizers - there is no way you're getting your entrees before 40 mins"" - and she was right. Once the food came, the staff struggled to identify what was ordered (i.e., no, that's meatloaf, not meatballs and so on).

61,Evan L.,"New York, NY",8,30,31,2.0,1/5/2017,"Quick Takes -- I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Harold's. Food was okay, but my biggest knocks with this restaurant are on service and the crazy $44/person prix-fixe price forced upon us for having a group (no mention of this online, on the menu or when we made the reservation). That said, I probably won't come back here again. If you're looking for a place for brunch, I suggest looking elsewhere. ---We came here for New Year's brunch at 12 PM. First thing the waitress told us was that parties of 7 or more (we had 14 people total) were required to order prix-fixe meal that lets you choose up to 4 main courses and 6 sides but you had to pay $44/person. Considering you can get 1 main and 3 sides for $19 (and according to some in our group this amount of food was enough enough bring leftovers home), I thought the $44/person was pretty ridiculous. Service: Service was lacking. I struggled to get my water glass refilled since no one came around to check on our table. We had to ask for water refills multiple times during the meal. Also, had I not asked for biscuits while waiting for the food to come out (saw other Yelp reviews mentioning them) , I doubt we would have gotten them. Finally, after our food came out, the waiters/our head waitress all but disappeared. It took me halfway through my meal to find someone to flag down to ask for extra condiments. Our Mains:- Fried Chicken: probably the best main we ordered, some of the smaller pieces were slightly dry on the inside but otherwise good; dish came with gravy and maple syrup- French Toast stocks: hugely disappointed as they were poorly done; they were severely overcooked and very charred on the outside giving it a woody texture - Avocado Egg White Omelet w/ broccoli: didn't try this one but the table seemed to prefer this omelet over the other we ordered- Bacon, Cheddar Omelet: decent omelet but very saltyOur Sides:- Mac and Cheese: best side we ordered, right amount of cheese- Cauliflower: one of the better sides we got...pureed with a slight butter flavor but not too rich - Fries: mixed bag of crispy and soft fries but flavorful overall- Butternut squash: tasted okay, looked like big squash ""french toast"" sticks with some sort of thick mayo sauce on top- Broccoli and cheese casserole: this dish positively surprised me but probably won't get it again...something about cheese and rice in the same bowl throws me off- Sweet Potatoes: didn't try this either but no one talked about this one",4,,

We ordered basically everything on the menu: main dishes - fried chicken, avocado toast, bacon omelette, and veal + Parmesan meatballs. Side dishes - macaroni and cheese, cucumber salad, broccoli, sweet potatoes, and fries. We also tried a couple of slices of cake for dessert (birthday cake and coconut). The fried chicken, veal meatballs, and avocado toast were the biggest hits at the table!However, the resounding favorites amongst our group were the biscuits! Yes, they were THAT good. I took all of the biscuits home. Not even sorry about it.After we were finally seated, the service vastly improved. The staff was friendly, attentive, and extremely fast. The nice lady (I didn't get her name unfortunately) who sat us even got us extra biscuits to go! She was the highlight of our time there - courteous with a great sense of humor.

64,Jonathan D.,"New York, NY",13,53,210,4.0,3/30/2017,"""Harold's Meat + Three"" earns its' name, I suppose, from the Plat du Jour option. For $28, you get the daily main, plus a choice of 3 side dishes (off a list of 10). Since I often find sides/apps to be the best part of dining out, I'm predisposed to like this scheme. It delivered great value and variety, but I'm a bit worried that I poached the 3 starches from the list, and abandoned the remaining veggies.Of my small plates, the Mac N' Cheese was the most classic and indulgent. Just a little bit sweet, and with an incredibly thick and substantial cheese sauce. The ""Farroto"" (an ersatz risotto) was wonderfully toothsome, and its' creaminess was matched by that of the grits. The latter dispensed with the cheese, gravy, etc of this archetypal southern dish; instead delivering a clean great taste. In the absence of bells and whistles, I usually salt or sugar my grits, but there was no need for that here. Fried fish was today's protein; once again simply prepared, restrained, and delicious. Along with the grits, it best demonstrates the culinary ethos of the establishment. 'Elevated southern cooking' can mean almost anything, and (on the whole) the menu doesn't read off as southern. But having had the meal, and thought about it; I get it. And I like it.",,,
65,Allison R.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,15,6,3.0,2/6/2017,"Three stars because this place shows promise, but still has a few kinks to work out before it's ace. THE GOOD: The interior design of this place is pretty sweet - like walking into a cross between an American diner and a photo studio. Really nice choice of materials, floor tile, and unexpected lighting solutions.  The food is plain jane - purposefully. Their menu includes items like meatloaf, mac n' cheese, and fried chicken - plus every entrée is served with 3 sides. Definitely enough food to split between two people if needed. THE BAD:The combination of the diner meets upscale vibe creates some awkwardness. For example - their ""salad bar"" reminded me of when Wendy's used to do salad bars in the mid-90's as a way to appeal to the healthy dinner crowd. Messy ingredients everywhere just looks unsanitary. Also they prep their combo platters in the same area as the salads which is just confusing and kinda gross.THE UGLY:The service was terrible. Really terrible. Literally waiters running around with their heads chopped off like they've never worked in a restaurant before. This is totally fixable which is why I say give them a chance, but I would avoid this place on Saturday night for now.",1,,
66,Jasper W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,10/29/2017,"I finally joined Yelp for this one. Went here on a super rainy night with my girlfriend because it is a block from our house. We looked at the menu online and seemed like it had a lot of options and that we'd be able to find something we like. Pick a meat and three sides - basic concept...When it opened a year ago we were a little interested because it was something new in a neighborhood that doesn't have many restaurants in it. We stayed away though because the insanely high prices it had when we'd pass by and check a menu, as well as when looking into the restaurant it didn't look particularly high end.Anyway, walked in tonight and the host jumped at us as though we might leave if given a second to look around. It felt a little desperate. Place was pretty much empty and we sat down. The AC was cranking and it was 60 degrees and raining outside. Our waitress came to give us menus and we noticed right away that the menu was completely different than what is on their website. We were a little bit bummed but we decided to roll with it. Oddly the menu was not at all running the concept and title of the restaurant. No pick your own sides, just a really limited small menu. I was a little bit put off and decided I'd just order the turkey club sandwich. My girlfriend decided on the fried chicken with mashed potatoes. Our waitress asked if we would like an order of their ""bread"" and I said yes because we were pretty hungry. We then sat there and waited.Ten minutes later, a basket of biscuits come out. Not plain biscuits - ones loaded with cheddar cheese and onions and corn and all sorts of stuff. That would be fine if we were told what we were going to get, but the waitress had said bread and this was something very different. She had also sold it to us, we didn't ask for bread or anything. She threw the idea out there and we went with it. We both ate one as we had them in front of us and needed something. Then came our entrees. My sandwich looked pretty uninspired and bland. My girlfriend's chicken looked better but weird. Chicken on a paper towel with coleslaw on the towel too. We tried our dinners and they were just really really mediocre. Actually - my sandwich was straight up bad. Untoasted dry white bread, shitty cold cut type turkey.... for 18 bucks. I thought I'd try and remedy the situation with a little hot sauce. It was impossible to get our servers attention. It just seemed like she really couldn't care less about her job. The place had started to fill up with guests from the hotel that it is located in, but it still wasn't busy by any stretch. She just wouldn't look our way and neither would any on the other staff walking around. We picked at our food but it really wasn't good. Eventually it was just sitting in front of us and we weren't touching it. Our waitress came and asked if we were done as though she knew it had been a bad meal. We said yes thank you, and she cleared it up. We asked for the check as we just wanted to go back up to our apartment and be done with it. She left and returned and literally THREW two plates down. Like slid them our of her hand so fast onto the table in front of where we were sitting. All she said as she did it was ""Our complimentary dessert."" No explanation of what it was, no enthusiasm, nothing. Just rude service. She left and was back in two seconds to slosh some water into our glasses really quickly. Spilling and just not caring. Came again to give us the check and said ""Whenever you're ready.""We didn't say anything, we just wanted to leave. Check was $90 with tip. Biscuits, our two entrees, and a single glass of wine my girlfriend had. Bad food, bad service. My take on it is that the place really isn't doing very well. Seemed like they probably had to scale back their menu because it was too big and was losing them money. The whole place was just really uninspired and generic concept of what a ""cool"" contemporary restaurant in NYC is. Won't be going back and hope you don't go either. Weirdly I had read positive things about the place when it first opened, but I guess their business model wasn't sustainable or they just didn't have enough people coming in to dine with them. Please just avoid this place. It's a lousy room service kitchen type thing. None of their guests looked like they knew any better because they were all from out of town. Stay away.",,,

70,Gob L.,"Stamford, CT",0,6,5,5.0,10/2/2016,"I had lunch yesterday and enjoyed my food.  The service was really nice, the host is very friendly.   I ordered the cheeseburger w/ three sides,  1) mac & cheese 2) French fries 3) coleslaw.  I didn't realize there was an all you can eat salad bar, I probably would have order that because I love salad and grew up with restaurants like Brock's and Victoria's Station that had salad bars. Next time I will order the salad and three sides of meat. When I saw the plate of French fries, I was a little disappointed since they were thicker cut fries until I ate one.  They are the most beautiful fries on the planet.  They were so crispy on the outside and unusually light and creamy on the inside.  I was expecting a bite of dry, mealy potato but that was not the case.  I have never had a fry quite like these and the entire plate was perfect -- not one was soggy, they were absolutely delicious and I will never look at another fry quite in the same way again.  Next time I will order three sides of fries.  I want to see what they give me, there is no law that states my three sides can't be three sides of fries.The macaroni and cheese are a thick, elongated corkscrew shaped pasta with very creamy sauce,  I wanted to eat the whole thing but I saved half for my brother.  I don't know what he ordered or why he didn't order his own fries and mac/cheese dish but I was forced to share, but he paid the bill so why do I care.  Who the hell knows.  I don't remember what my new baby nephew ate.  He's 8 month's old and has only four teeth and he can't eat solid foods but if he tries to bite you, watch out!  The cheeseburger is actually a double burger.  Our waitress didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked and I didn't think to tell her.  Mine came well-done but I still enjoyed it.  Next time I will ask for it medium rare or maybe even black and blue with some moo.  Next time I will order the fried chicken or KY hot brown.  That's a lot of next times. I wanted to try dessert but was really too full.  If you're not full and sit by the window you can think about how lazy, weak and out-of-shape you are while eating your dessert before considering to join the strongman gym across the street.  I saw a muscle man move a giant tire that was laying in the middle of the sidewalk.  That was awesome.I've resisted yelp for a very long time, and that time is no longer now.  This is my first review, and may possibly be my last.  Too much typing involved.  5 stars for Harold's and three sides of fries.  If you find it's a lot of food, AstraZeneca maybe able to help.",2,4,2

I have never been here on a regular night..but thanksgiving was an absolute shit show. If you want to make a reservation and be seated 2 hours after that..than this is the place for you. Also, if you want people to yell at you because you are inquiring about when you might get a table cause you've waited 2 hours and you're hungry, then definitely go here. And not to mention the owner himself Harold Moore was in the front of the restaurant yelling at guests. So much for ""staying devoted to your customers,"" as it says on there web page. I didn't realize it was our fault that you don't know how to run a restaurant on one of the biggest American holidays..then maybe don't do it. You took the reservations, you know how many people were coming. I felt bad for the servers because they were working so hard.As for the food it was good, but nothing amazing.

While the food wasn't bad, the service was so appallingly awful that I can't in good conscience give Harold's two stars. Disorganization and apathy are the two words I would use to describe the staff. For a restaurant that seemingly holds themselves to moderately high culinary standards, they need to take a serious look at how they treat their patrons. This was perhaps the greatest disparity between price and service I've ever experienced.",1,,

74,Carrie L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,5.0,9/8/2016,"I walked into this place after a boxing class, looking for a healthy option. I think it just opened - the inside was beautifully designed and very spacious, but there were still covers on the Windows from construction. I'd guess it opened just a day or two prior, if that. So I was one of the first customers! The concept is great - choice of meat (beer can chicken, NY strip steak, pork schnitzel, protein waffles, and others) + three sides from an extensive, vegetarian friendly menu. You can also add more ""premium sides"" for a higher cost, or go with a salad option. I got the steak, which was a generous portion and perfectly cooked. At first it was a bit under cooked, but I asked for it to be cooked a bit longer and they accommodated quickly, friendly, and professionally. I believe the owner even was the one who delivered it to me when it was ready. It was really my fault since I requested it done more rare, but they were so apologetic they comped my and my friends meal! They really didn't have to - it was a perfectly cooked steak in the end, with great, fresh sides, and a feeling like I had done something good for my body. This is a great spot, with stellar service and wonderful food. I'll definitely come back.",1,,2

Harold himself came out to introduce himself and offered to select our food for us (at a fixed price, which made things seamless and took a lot of stress out of deciding what to order). We were absolutely thrilled with everything that came out - all delicious twists on Southern classics (the pimento cheese dip was a crowd favorite). There is a TON of food, but they bring out tupperware for you and I can guarantee that myself and all of my guests will be feeding ourselves well on leftovers for the next week.   Located in the Arlo Hotel in Tribeca, Harold's atmosphere is also the perfect mix of casual and cool. I would highly recommend anyone planning a birthday dinner or special celebration looking to have a good time and eat a LOT choose Harold's.

When I arrived, we were a little early, there were ample tables but were asked to wait in the lounge. That's fine. The hostess never came and got us. We walked back up a few minutes after our reservation time and she said 'do you have a reservation' not remembering she had sent us to the lounge. Let me again say, there were over 12 open tables. She then escorted us to a tiny two top by the front door (on a frigid winter night) next to the waiter station. Now, if I walk in somewhere, then fine with this table. But I made a reservation and you are going to sit me at the worst table in the whole place? Nope. She wanted me to go back to the lounge, even though there were open tables.

Food is seasoned right as expected. But nothing really jumps out at you as so signature that would have you say this is the best prime rib or deviled eggs I ever tasted. If they keep the food consistent and service satisfactory, this can grow into neighborhood gem. Decor is cozy, and ambient music is great energy. I am going to give it another visit with a larger group as it seems like the fun place for a group celebration. The NASCAR Spritz was my favorite thing about this food centric restaurant. Surprisingly, even with such common ingredients like Miller Hi Lite and Aperol, the combination is like peanut butter and jelly... a forever hit. Lobster thermador was just ok.

90,Emily T.,"Manhattan, NY",7,14,217,2.0,10/2/2016,"I'm disappointed. After reading about Harold's Meat & Three on Eater and GrubStreet, I was extremely excited to give it a try. I had even told all my friends that we needed to make this one of our Saturday night group dinners. I guess I was too excited because I jumped the gun and made a reservation for Sunday brunch. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were seated right away. A server came over to ask us if we wanted anything to drink and we promptly ordered some beverages. Another server came over almost immediately and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. At that moment, the first server re-approached our table and seemed to have a silent but intense conversation with the latter server (as if ""back off, this is my table""). Surprisingly, our initial server relinquished our table to the latter server and was never to be seen again. The approach to the menu is very simple (pick 1 main and 3 sides). I was having a bit of decision anxiety (couldn't decide between the roast chicken and the steak and eggs) but it was only exacerbated when our server was constantly checking in with us to order. When re-approached, I politely said that we'd need 5 more minutes and was given an almost disapproving look (""You need FIVE more minutes?""). When I finally settled on the steak and eggs, I pointed to the item on the menu. I was surprised that I was neither asked ""How would you like your steak cooked?"" nor ""How would you like your eggs cooked?"". I was even more surprised when our server asked if I would like to add an egg to my dish (how many eggs would I be eating?). When our server ran back to ask me, ""You wanted your eggs scrambled right?"", I was perplexed as I wasn't sure I had given any indication of any cooking method. I went with over easy (I like runny egg yolks). When our food finally came out, I was surprised that on my plate was not one, not two but THREE eggs and no steak. Obviously perplexed, I caught the attention of another server who brought our remaining food and asked, ""I'm sorry. I ordered the steak and eggs but I'm not sure where my steak is"". He said that he would check. A few steps behind him was the manager who asked me if there was a problem. I asked him the same thing. He ran over to the server I had asked to check. After a lot of hush hush, our server returned and told me that I had ordered 3 eggs and had confirmed I wanted 3 eggs when asked what type of preparation style I wanted my eggs. My father and I were confused. He asked if we could order a side of steak to go with the existing eggs. Our server replied no, you'd need to order the Steak and Eggs with ANOTHER three sides. Looking down at the three eggs already sitting on my plate, I sat in confusion. Our server asked me if I wanted the steak and eggs. I replied with ""No, that's fine, I'll just eat the three eggs"". The server asked me if I was sure. At that point, I was annoyed that I was paying for a $25+ brunch looking down at 3 over easy eggs I could've cooked myself. I had come here for the steak I had heard so much about but instead just settled on the 3 eggs (tired and annoyed that my experience was so lackluster on a service perspective). Luckily, my father shared half his creamed chipped beef with me (which was very delicious) and we finished off our meal. In hindsight, maybe I was misunderstood. Maybe I should've spoken up during moments of confusion. Overall, this did not leave a good first impression and I understand that this is a new restaurant but more could have been done on their part to correct for what happened. Sadly, I will not be bringing a group of friends there any time soon.",9,,1

An hour in all we'd been served was potato chips and deviled eggs. Once our entrees finally came I can only say they were totally underwhelming.

Two of us ordered the avocado toast which was TINY and $19. It also came on cheese on it, which is not standard and the menu didn't specify. I typically don't eat dairy so I would have ordered this without dairy on it if the menu had been more descriptive. The sides were fine but the homefries were incredibly oversalted.

96,S P.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,2,2.0,1/3/2017,Nothing special here. Party of six had average meal with average drinks.  Prices seemed disproportionate to the quantity of food as one diner only had half a hanger steak. Half??? Only 'southern' thing I saw on the menu were grits. Life's too short for an average meal in Manhattan.,,,
97,Geoff H.,"Houston, TX",53,41,115,5.0,11/28/2016,"I may never have known about this place except it was in the hotel in which I'm staying. It's kind of an old fashioned name but it's a very modern hip place, both in decor and food. Service was friendly and the bartender offered enthusiastic recommendations. They bring out a warm corn biscuit after you order, which is phenomenal! I ordered the whole branzino, which was delightfully flaky and brightly seasoned with citrus and garlic. For my sides I had the brussel sprout salad, Japanese sweet potato, and mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was rich and creamy and flavorful--kudos to the bartender who convinced me to order it! The salad was bright and refreshing, but also had some bacon bits for added texture and flavor. The sweet potato is a special Japanese variety, off white in color and bit more subtle and floral. I will definitely return in the future to try the other items on the menu. Thanks for a great meal!",,,
98,Julie D.,"Manhattan, NY",125,53,4,5.0,11/22/2016,We came here with a group of 6 last Saturday night and loved our entire experience. I made a reservation and we had no problem being seated. The man who seemed to be hosting was welcoming and chatted with us as soon as we sat down. Our waiter answered any questions we had and we were off. We all got different things and tried each others dishes and sides. It's a fun menu and I like that I get to choose my sides. A friend got the salad bar which looked just as delicious as any of the meat entrees we got. Harold came over and chatted with us and genuinely seemed like he wanted us to have a good experience. We will definitely be back!,,,
99,Christie K.,"Manhattan, NY",63,21,0,2.0,10/14/2016,"Fun restaurant, cool mix and match concept, and friendly staff.  But the food is just OK if that. You'd think the sides would be phenomenal given the whole concept of '3' but our whole party was disappointed. Good for a fun time with a big party, but don't go for the food. And how can you go wrong with birthday cake? Again fun idea, but we left more than half the cake on the table.",,,

The Thai inspired ribs were to die for, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. Everything about this place was awesome. Loved it!",,,

We had the 44$ pp family style option and pretty much much had a every meat on the menu and all the sides The pre dinner biscuits and apps provided were prosciutto deviled eggs and a cheese spread. These were all very tasty  and a pleasant surprise to our orderI will recommend to any meat and side lover that I know The sides were all tasty and well seasoned. We did not Leave  hungry Oh and the leftovers were still amazing!Thanks Harold!,,,
104,Lloyd M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,0,5.0,10/29/2016,"Harold Moore and his team have created an extraordinary destination for Southern-style ""comfort food"" in New York City's new Arlo Hotel. Starting with the Pimento Cheese Spread and Bacon. Moving on to main courses like ""Beer Can"" Chicken and Hangar Steak offered with a myriad of sides including Cream Cauliflower, Brussell Sprouts doused in Balsamic and, of course, Grits.

106,Beth M.,"Fell's Point, Baltimore, MD",1,1,0,1.0,12/4/2016,"Being West Villagers and knowing Harold's old great Restaurant, Commerce, we were very excited to try out his new spot in TriBeCa.  We arrived around 8:10PM and saw many open tables, but we were not allowed to sit due to our full party not being present (we realize most restaurants do this) but the pretentious way they ushered us to the bar was upsetting and set a bad tone. When we arrived at the bar, it seemed that the restaurant manager was spread out with his laptop taking up 1/2 of the bar, causing us to feel cramped in what was a massive and empty bar space.  The bar tender was not able to multitask and it took 15 plus minutes to order two bottles of beer.  He also was unable to name the selection of beers the restaurant had on tap, definitely a red flag. When the rest of our party arrived we sat down and they ordered their drinks. We had three different waiters come to the table and ask them their order (they told all three) and their drinks STILL did not come. We waited about 20 mins for their drinks to come at which point we decided to order an appetizer, after being told by one of our three waiters that since they were busy that night and 'have a small kitchen' that our meals would take 30-40 mins to prepare. WHAT?! Keep in mind these dishes are not complex and the space is absolutely enormous especially by New York standards. So we ordered a sampler plate which consisted of a bag of lays potato chips (still in the bag) some cold pigs in a blanket, and pimento cheese which was just about edible. We waited and waited and waited for our main courses to come and when they did we breathed a sigh of relief because this meant we could leave the restaurant soon. The mac and cheese was OK. A member of our parties' baked potato was the size of a golf ball, and his leak side dish was quite literally ONE SOGGY LEAK. The roast chicken was tasteless and the fried chicken appeared to have been sitting out for hours, which is confusing given we had waited 40 mins for our meals to be freshly prepared. Additionally, many of the orders were wrong. One member of our party asked for a baked potato and got a small barely edible heap of mashed potato. When were finished they brought out 'complimentary ice cream cones' which made up for.....actually nothing, but they tasted ok. It's pretty rare to have a bad meal in NYC and I have never written a review about a culinary or bar experience in my life. However, I feel that I would be doing my fellow New Yorkers a disservice if I didn't spread the word. That said, maybe Harold and his crew will read this and try and turn the restaurant around, because if they don't they surely will not be around long.",3,,
107,Bob G.,"Wellington, FL",0,5,1,5.0,4/24/2017,"Wow. I travel 3-4 nights a week (just hit 1,100 nights at Marriotts alone) and dinner often becomes monotonous routine of run of the mill same old same old cuisine. But ever so occasionally there is a gem in the rough, an unassuming but memorable meal. Harolds Meat + Three defines freshness, taste, and genuine hospitality rather than patronizing fake niceness. From beginning to end, genuinely superb! Thank you.",,,
108,P R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,1.0,1/13/2017,Sitting at harolds waiting for food- 40 min and counting... restaurant was 2/3rds full. I would like to tell folks how the food is ...,,1,
109,Chris A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/5/2017,Overpriced restaurant in Arlo hotel. Service is slow. Menu doesn't give accurate description of food on the brunch menu. Too much salt on all the food. Place was empty for brunch/ more of a tourist place. Our orders were not accurate.,,,
110,Lisa W.,"New York, NY",2,27,0,2.0,2/25/2017,"Food -great. Service - disorganized when not absent entirely. Stopped by for lunch, restaurant was only half full. Two guys looked like they were playing host, but not doing much else. Servers had no sense of urgency or organization. Took 15 mins to get water and order, and at least 30 mins to get a burger. So disappointing as I am a huge Commerce fan and had high hopes. Harold's- please get a handle on your service, your food is fantastic but the floor management and service is deplorable.",,,

112,Bud F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,11/11/2016,"Don't waste your time coming here. The food was basic level cooking. Things came out cold and not cooked through. I asked to speak with one of the owners, a blonde woman came over and introduced herself as Julie. She was dismissive and uninterested. She seemed abusive to her wait staff too. The place was mostly empty on a Saturday night, I can see why now. Avoid this restaurant, this is Tribeca and there are too many great options too even consider this place.",1,,
113,Noelle W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,1.0,2/6/2017,"Quite possibly one of the worst/most bizarre restaurant experiences of my life. I really wanted to like this place because Commerce was one of my favorite restaurants and I miss it. I also used to live in Nashville and love the ode to the southern meat and three concept.It all started with poor service at the bar while I was waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. Despite a relatively empty bar for a Saturday night, it took several minutes to even get the bartender's attention. My two friends and I eventually ordered drinks while waiting on our fourth to arrive. Despite hearing the bartender offer to transfer another patron's drinks to their table a few minutes before, he insisted that we settle at the bar first. However, it became hard to settle our bar tab since the bar computer did not work. Without any explanation or apology, a manager then paraded my card around the restaurant to several computer screens. There were many empty tables yet we were still waiting at the bar while multiple people tried to find a working computer to no avail. Finally, I suggested that we be seated and to please return my card once they figured it out. Eventually my card was brought to our table and I was told that they were going to transfer the drinks after all of that. Rough start but my cocktail was good and I was still optimistic for the food.Our server was friendly enough but his lack of experience was evident. Our meal itself was somewhere between unmemorable and horrible: my Gruner came out lukewarm, my friend's pork chop was raw, the mac and cheese was just plain bad (how can you screw up mac and cheese?!), just to name a few issues.The manager was understanding and took the pork chop off of the bill and our drinks at the bar never even made it to the bill because they still could not figure out their system. By the end of the night, we just wanted to get out of there and left as soon as the bill was returned. The whole experience ended with the manager chasing us down Renwick accusing us of not paying the bill. We had to show our paid receipts in the middle of the street on a freezing NYC night. Yikes.AVOID!!!",,,

116,J. T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,5,0,3.0,1/17/2017,"We were very excited to try this place, as it came up on many ""Top/Best"" lists in research. The space is big, beautiful, and comfortable. No wait. Service and food did not necessarily match the lovely environment. All staff encountered seemed a bit nervous and felt as if they were still in training. Our wine that came out was not chilled enough, the adjustment was not much of a difference, we had to add ice in our glass. The pour was very light. I was hoping waiter would think to make up for the issues by a nice heavier pour just to take our experience back up a notch. Upon ordering food, we were told prime rib would be rolled out on a cart and carved at the table. This did not happen. Busser brought all the food out not very elegantly. We could immediately see that food had been sitting, as there was a layer of cold glaze on top all dishes. The portions were great and the pairing with 3 sides is quite generous and lovely, as you have more to sample which is always a good experience. Busser cleared table once again, in a rough manner, food scraps flinging at times. A nice touch at the end was complementary mini ice cream cones. Thankfully, our evening was made better upstairs at the Arlo Hotel's rooftop bar by their lovely environment and bartender.",2,,

Service was excellent and atmosphere was really cool. Birthday cake is a must for dessert! Can't wait to come back.,,,
119,Samantha W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,3.0,11/3/2016,"Concept is interesting here. You order a main and then 3 sides... there is also a salad bar which always raises a flag in my book.
