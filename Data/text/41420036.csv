The space is really big and you don't feel claustrophobic even though there are a lot of tables with people playing.The decor is modern, the drinks are really good, and ping pong is just good clean fun. My only dig is that I think it's pretty expensive. It was $50 an hour (peak) and that hour goes by real fast.Overall, we had a great time and would return.",
1,,11/10/2018,153,,"Chicago, IL",Sara N.,54,2.0,154,"My partner and I came in around 4 PM to play ping pong. The employee at the front desk told us there was a two hour wait, and that I would receive a text message when a table became available. I gave her my number, waited for two hours, and received no texts. We walked back to SPIN, and a different male employee told us they sent a text message at 5 PM. He also said I should've received a welcome text at 4 PM. The original employee I dealt with walked over and muttered under her breath ""I put in 01 not 00.."" meaning she entered the last two digits of my phone number incorrectly. When I asked the male employee if they entered my number incorrectly, he vehemently denied it. However, I'm not deaf nor am I blind. The other staff member clearly stated she entered my number wrong. We were now being told we would have to wait for another 25 minutes. My partner and I checked our coats. When we came back to the front desk area to walk towards the bar, we heard the female employee say something sarcastic about my partner's tattoo. 25 minutes later, we were able to play ping pong after hunting down an employee to give us paddles.  Despite ping pong being fun, the unprofessionalism and overall hostility we received dampened the mood. Both my partner and I were very friendly from the beginning, and I would say we are generally patient people, but the experience was overall frustrating.",

I cannot emphasize the kindness of the crew.The food they had catered was ok. The meat and cheeses were great and so was the veggie platter. I wasn't crazy about the mini sliders, or the buffalo chicken or the artichoke dip.I really enjoyed their Chardonnay and liked that they had a sour in tap too.Ping pong is fun, the music WAS.ON.POINT.I really recommend this spot for group birthdays or work events.

I had actually never heard of the company and wasn't sure what to expect after deciding to come. Regardless, by the end of the night the place had me sold! I'll start by saying that if you're deciding whether or not to come, DO IT. Fun is certainly guaranteed here.Our party booked two tables at 8:30 PM. The spot itself is located downstairs from it's main street entrance. After walking in I realized just how massive the space actually was! Imagine the size of a bowling alley, but instead of lanes there's organized ping pong tables all around, with a bar located towards the back. They also have a ""tub"" filled with pong balls that you're actually allowed to get inside for an impromptu photo op.Since our party also opted for the $35 per person drink package (which is required if you make a group reservation). We had two hours to get the beer and wine going. All I can say is that with drinks flowing and friendly competition going around we all had a great time. This is definitely a great idea if you're looking to organize something with a group or get your friends together for a more unique birthday celebration. They also have food for purchase here as well, but we didn't opt in for it.Overall this is a great experience if you're looking to do something active while enjoying drinks with friends all around. Be warned though, the competition could get intense as the night progresses...",1

We were able to walk right in and get a table to play on for a half hour. You can reserve a table for either a half hour for 18 dollars or an hour for around 30 dollars. Each table gets a server so you can order drinks and even food while you play. They had a descent beer list and lots of cocktails. Everything is decorated really well, plus that tub of ping pong balls is so unique. There's also a bar or tables you can sit at if you don't want to play ping pong. Don't worry about picking up ping pong balls as you go because someone goes around and does that as you play! I definitely can't wait to go back next time I'm in the area.

Because it was done up for an event, I can't really speak to the venue as it's used for ping pong, but the space is really, really big. Multiple bars; attentive, friendly bartenders and staff all the way to closing. I wish I could remember more about my experience, but I wrote myself this note: ""Kelly at Spin was eggcellent"". I think she worked there, I think her costume had something to do with eggs, I think I was amused by her puns and said I would Yelp her. Here's to you Kelly!",1

Unfortunately, all the tables were booked while we were there but we decided to stay for drinks and food, and I'm glad we did. The food was surprising amazing! We had the truffle fries that had an added touch with rosemary and pecorino cheese. After a couple beers (which were decently priced) we decided to get the Tutto Bianco flatbread which was to die for. I'd love to have those same toppings on a slightly chewy pizza crust. The mix of sage honey and ricotta was soooo good, and throw on some savory sausage and fennel and you're good to go. The place has a ton of art on the walls which is amazing, I kept looking around and saw pieces I'd love to have in my own place!Hope to come here again and get a table next time!",

I love how you dont have to chase a ball when it flies away. But it doesn't quite justify $30 for 1/2 hour of play. Especially a 30 dollar t shirt. Most concerts charge 25 bucks for a shirt. I for sure wont pay higher at a bar.  But I loved the art, the paddles were pretty good minus slight peeling.",

13,,12/30/2017,529,,"Queens, NY",Carl B.,488,5.0,461,"You get 100+ balls and staff comes to sweep up loose balls and refill. You're left with ping pong without the part of ping pong that sucks: bending for or chasing after the ball. That makes the high price -- which is much more reasonable weekdays during the day -- more worthwhile. You're never forced to stop play, so you can squeeze in lots of games, and about as much per-minute exercise playing table tennis as you'd get playing tennis. Be sure to wear layers so you can strip to your base layer for pong.There's also a server to bring you water -- you'll need it -- or a cocktail; they have good ones.Enforcement of the time limits was inconsistent; usually they seem to give you a few extra minutes, but the last time we went they were real sticklers, even though the place was half empty.",1

It is underground and was packed when we arrived at about 11:30p. The bar was two deep and all of the tables were taken. Pretty consistent prices with the drinks and we actually ended up renting a table for an hour which did not take that long to achieve.

The equipment is also in much better condition, which adds to a better experience.We ended up playing for an hour and a half.

20,1,3/29/2018,563,1,"Queens, NY",Justin C.,57,3.0,115,"3.5* I've got mixed feelings about this place. A part of me loves the atmosphere with the hip and trendy space, but the competitive side in me could use a little more love. It's got the vibe of a fun filled good time, with drinks and food, to make for a cool hang out spot and to get a little friendly banter going with some friends/coworkers. If you're going here for a serious game, probably not the best place to do it. It'll do the job, but if you take table tennis more serious than your basement showdowns, this place can feel a little restricting. Lighting is low, although they use orange balls(also 2 star rating, not competition 3 star balls), it's still not easy to see in some darker areas.  The ceiling height is low so you can't quite do your best Olympic defense impression. Overall space for movement is mediocre, especially if its a full house, you'll be bound to rub elbows with someone. I guess it just depends how serious you take this game, if it's to just have some fun with friends and hang out, this place is great. They also have dedicated ball boys so you'd never have to pick up any balls which is a really nice touch, unless again, you're a serious ponger, you'd probably bring your own balls which you'd have to pick up yourself anyway. I get the appeal of this place though, it's a good balance of keeping it trendy while not losing too much focus on the game. It'll be a fun time regardless especially with a full bar to intoxicate your frenemies to bring you a victorious outcome. My biggest gripe are their house paddles, if you don't own your own paddle, the recreational ones they offer you to use are terrible for a place that is suppose to be for table tennis. Stay hip mother suckers",3
21,,12/7/2017,298,,"Carlsbad, CA",Nancy L.,665,5.0,400,"Exercise in the big city is pricey but quite the event.  We aren't clubbers, and had already dropped $1500 on a Broadway show, so I guess $80/hour for center court at SPiN was a deal.  It certainly was a luxury having unlimited ping pong balls constantly replenished for you.  They scoop them up with a net, and the guy almost tripped me up with it... didn't expect the old girl to move so quickly ; )We only had pizza and beer, but service was attentive and unpressured.  After our hour ended, we stayed at our courtside table and watched someone (I don't think he was affiliated with SPiN) give a lesson to a girl in a dress and medium heeled booties... makes sense if that's what you'll be wearing while you play.Other tables were occupied by a women's league, boys with their Dads, couples, and then there was us, three generations shouting and working up a sweat.  Actually, it was totally worth $80; I almost forgot that Butcher Shop Gal had another of her crying laughing fits which I've only seen a few times in 39 years.It was pretty early, around 5pm, and the weather outside was good, so I can see how other times would be busier.  There was a private party going on in a completely separate area.  You can reserve on-line.  Next time we'll bring our own paddles... yeah, we should be a lot better, Defense Dollars even has his own ball feeding machine at home!",

I was here this past weekend for a charity fundraiser event, and had a pretty good time.The vibe is super chill - great music, cool art, tons of staff walking around. Everyone was really friendly. The drinks were spot on - I was pretty happy with my rosé and prosecco for the night. The food.... not so much.The best dish of the night for me was the tuna tartare. The empanadas and risotto balls were OK. The sliders were cold, and the pigs in a blanket and grilled cheese were way too salty. I think this place would be a good spot to hang out if I knew someone who was a member or came to a pre-planned event, but it seems way too expensive for a casual happy hour place. Overall, cool to check out but I wouldn't go out of my way to be here. 3.5 stars.",

Updated review",0,,"Spring, TX",Vince A.,7,1.0,10,Only reason I did the first review was because they had a promo going on where you get a free hour for writing a yelp review. Me and my friends wrote 3 in total. We played for 4 hours to kill time and to wait out the storm. Only paid for one hour.Place was decent. Nothing special. Drinks ans food are expensive.

24,,4/2/2018,20,,"Cranford, NJ",Alan L.,339,4.0,382,"A fun outing for a small business group. Clean, well organized with reasonable bar hand food and drinks. You get a reserved ping pong table (or more - depending on the size of your group). The quality of play depends on the attendees - each table has two buckets of balls that are refilled regularly. The cost includes unlimited beer / house wine which makes a visit relatively expensive for a business group that drinks moderately.",
25,,1/11/2018,87,,"Manhattan, NY",Sumo H.,0,1.0,53,"Success has gone to their head. I recently called to make a booking for my team at work. Their strategy is to not open the table bookings online for weekdays (when most corporate events happen). Instead, they suggest you call them for weekday bookings. When you call, they force you to pre-purchase 70 dollars of drinks and dinner per person. They then proceed to charge you the advance rate of 79 dollars a table/hour. Their walk-in wait times are no less than a couple of hours, so it really pushes customers to go for the advance payments. Spin should learn that manipulating their customer base to make the most profits in the short term has a negative impact in the long run. Customers are not dumb: we can see through these arrangements. I'm writing a strong letter to the Events team at my company discouraging them from making bookings here. I'll take my team to Fat Cat, which has live Jazz, pool, ping-pong, shuffleboard, board games, and most importantly, a fair business model. Cheers!",3

This place was more fun than I thought it would be! Upon entering the host asked us if we were bringing our own paddles? I didn't realize that she was being serious before she said that everyone on one side of the location was a professional! Not kidding when I say that I saw people sweating harder and breathing heavier than a person running a marathon!My friend and I rented a table for 30 minutes and ordered a few diet cokes in the interim. Pong is underrated because we had SO much fun! It's a relief to find a place you can go as an adult and have fun without being too serious. There were a few times that we were hit by rogue balls (insert that's what she said joke), and we were approached about getting professional lessons (because that's a thing...no really!) There are ball collectors walking around with specialty nets the entire time picking up balls and dumping them in your bucket.

I think the first time I came here was probably like four years ago, when it was just me and a bunch of college friends looking for something interesting to do. For the uninitiated, yes, spin is a pretty cool concept. It's a bar/sports hall where you can order drinks while you play ping pong. The space is air conditioned, very clean, has television sets, and has high quality service. If you like ping pong, this is a good place not only because you can play, but also because you'll meet a lot of other very good players. I think some of the pros who play here also hold lessons here, but they're not specifically affiliated with Spin- rather, you'll simply be renting the tables from spin while you have your lesson. If you have interest, ask the staff for more details.The only and biggest problem with this place is that it's so damn expensive. I went to play with my friend for like an hour, and the total came out to like around $50. It's just way too much to play a sport which is extremely casual and doesn't really require too much space or capital expenditure. I could maybe see myself coming here if I were on a date or something where I would want a more... controlled, upscale setting, but generally I much prefer going to fat cat, where they have cheaper prices ($7 an hour), great selection of alcohol, other games as well (pool, shuffleboard), sometimes live music, and a slightly more vibrant atmosphere.Not saying I'll never come back to spin, but generally can't justify the price.",5

There was a waitlist on a Tuesday, but it looked like it was because of a big group function that was happening, and the wait was maybe only 45 minutes at most. The nice thing is, there is a fully-loaded bar, so you can have a drink, relax and before you know it, it is your time to play. What I liked is you never need to chase balls, people who work there collect them and load you up again. The tough thing is that some of the tables are positioned funny, so balls were flying at us and our table the whole time, which made it tough.Really fun and different.

After checking in at the front desk, you and your party are taken to a ping pong table, and soon after that, a server will swing by to take your drink and food orders. You can pay for half hour and/or hour-long intervals, and while pricey, SPiN is VERY well set up for ping pong. The space is clean and spacious, and each table has two *buckets* filled with ping pong balls, so need to fetch fly balls. The drinks are also pricey - $8 for Harpoon IPA, ouch - but that's the cost of admission as they say, and their selection of drinks and dishes is vast. The service is always friendly, and dance and pop music makes it easy to get into the game. It's a good time.So all in all, while SPiN isn't cheap, you get what you pay for - a fun, hip, well-run ping pong bar. I'll definitely be coming back soon.",1

I was recently looking for a place to celebrate my 30th birthday, and I wanted to do something more engaging. Since the beginning when I contacted them, I knew this was the place where I was celebrating my birthday. Laura the sales manager was very responsive and helpful. She really made the planning process very simple and easy. The day of the party all staff was helpful. My party had a corner section in the back by the bar, and I can say everyone was having a great time. The music the DJ was playing was on point. Half my group was playing a ping pong tournament while the other half was cheering and drinking. We all had an amazing time and took some great insta worthy pictures. The place decor is artsy and hip. I recommend Spin to anyone who just wants to have a different night out.",2

Be sure to make reservations on the weekends because it gets busy.Space - Clean and open space with beautiful wall art. You don't even have to pick up your own ping pong balls!Service - Waitress was super awesome and very attentive.Chips and Guacamole - Most beautiful presentation of chips and guacamole I've ever seen. The addition of avocado ice cream was fantastic.Truffled French Fries - YUM! The French fries were thin and crisp, and tossed perfectly. We finished these in 5 minutes and had to order a second serving.Amish Chicken Wings - The skin looked a little dry, but the chicken was moist and tender when I took my first bite.If you're only looking to get one appetizer, go with the French fries. Pairs well with a gin and tonic.",8

That's pretty cool.I kept hearing about spin from friends ever since 2011 and I finally made the trip this past winter when a friend suggested we spend an afternoon before Thanksgiving here.We decided on 2 hours since it wouldn't be that expensive split 4 ways. We were placed in a more crowded area with a table right next to us and also behind us. It was tough playing 2v2 without accidentally bumping into someone passing us or another ping pong patron.The net in which they use to pick up the ping pong balls off the floor is pretty freakin' cool.After our table time was up, we sat down to finish our beers and chat. No one bothered us!Good spot to spend the afternoon if it's chilly outside or hold a corporate event. They do have a private room in the back!",5

52,2,1/17/2017,298,1,"Evanston, IL",Mindy H.,257,4.0,130,"This is hands-down one of the neatest bars I've ever been to. I really enjoy playing ping-pong (it's probably the only sport I'm not terrible at), so naturally the idea of combining ping-pong and drinks seemed like a super fun way to spend the evening. I visited SPiN with my boyfriend and two other friends on a Sunday night around 6pm, and there was a 2-hour wait since they were hosting a company event at the time. We placed our names on the wait-list and ended up wandering around some shops/restaurants nearby, which turned out to be a good idea since our table opened up a whole hour earlier than we expected. The entire space is quite huge, with ping-pong tables as far as the eye can see and a large bar area towards the back. One of the best things about playing pong here is that you don't have to chase the ball if it flies away from your table - there are plenty of ball baskets hanging around and there's always someone walking around using these fancy nets to collect the flyaway balls. The four of us rented the table for an hour and a half, which totally flew by.SPiN can get kinda pricey - at $60/hour for one table, it's probably best if you come with four people and play doubles or switch off. We also ended up sharing a growler ($22), which made the experience even more fun. If you're looking to find something eventful to do for the day, definitely drop by! Just plan ahead a little since it seems like the wait times can get incredibly long.",4

55,,11/11/2017,2,,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",Jeffrey S.,11,4.0,4,Nice atmosphere to chill around and have a drink while you play a game or two of ping pong. A little pricey but it's what you would expect in this part of town,
56,1,8/16/2017,318,,"Boston, MA",Erin E.,9,5.0,259,"Checked out this place for a work event and had a great time!  It's a swanky, artsy ping pong parlor that is extremely New York... for example, if a ball falls on the floor, do you pick it up?  Of course not, are you a peasant?  You just grab a new one from the endlessly refilling ball basket in front of you.  The menu includes some delicious, over-the-top Taproom-style milkshakes, great cocktails, and serviceable appetizer basics.  The service is also terrific.  It is a little pricey but if you can get your company to pick up the tab, so much the better!",1
