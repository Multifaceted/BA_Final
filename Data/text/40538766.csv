1,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,3.0,12/25/2017,"3.5 stars? We obviously came to try the infamous sushi burger. We made a reservation beforehand for our party of 2 on Opentable. When we got there, the host acknowledged my reservation but proceeded to still seat the other parties of 2 that had arrived before us. Even though, we didn't have to wait that long it was still annoying that it seemed like our reservation didn't matter and we were still just put in the queue like everyone else. We got seated in the smaller room off to the side of the front, which I also didn't prefer as much as the main dining room. The waiter took a while to get to us, and we didn't have drink menus originally, so we were unable to order our drinks when he first asked us. It also took us a while to get any bread brought to our table, and we never got offered seconds although I would say the thick pretzel sticks were pretty good although served cold. For our entrees, I got the sushi burger and my boyfriend got the burger with fries. We also shared the lobster mac and cheese side. The waiter told me the sushi burger was not that big or filling, but it surprisingly was for me. It was very tasty and flavorful, so it was worth the $22 price tag to me. The lobster mac and cheese was also a somewhat hefty price at $22 for a side, but the portion is way larger than a side and could definitely be an entree. Thankfully, they didn't skimp on the amount of lobster meat, so I enjoyed that dish as well. The burger was also tasty and came with a good amount of fries although maybe a little less worth its $24 price tag.Overall, the food didn't disappoint, but the initial slow service did. Our food got brought out pretty quickly and the latter half of the meal was fine, but the beginning just left a sour taste in our mouths. Overall, it was a fine meal but just more of a one time thing to try, not really yearning to come back.",3,,

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Service was ok - but could definitely be better.Anyway the important part: the food.Salmon poke - definitely my favorite thing. It had a ton of flavor and was just really fresh and amazing.Sushi burger - great for photos and also very tasty.Calamari - had a bit of a kick but was cooked perfectly.Chocolate cake - REALLY rich and decadent.I would definitely recommend this place. Super tasty, great menu, etc.",5,,

4,Jessica V.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,8,5.0,5/8/2018,"This place deserves 5 stars!I'd been dying to stop by to try the infamous sushi burger - so my friend at I stopped by for lunch around 1PM on a Tuesday. From the moment we stepped foot into the door we were treated like royalty. The host was beyond warm and welcoming. We didn't make a reservation and were seated right away. Our waiter took our orders quickly and remained attentive throughout our entire time there. He even gave us a complimentary round of the rose we were drinking!For an appetizer we ordered the fried calamari, and sushi burgers as our main course. The calamari was fresh, and the sushi burger did live up to the hype!While we were waiting for our food, the host came to speak to us and even ordered us complimentary brussels sprouts. (I am not a fan of them, but he insisted they were a must try, so who was I to turn them down? They were absolutely delicious!)Lastly, I ordered the chocolate blackout cake and my friend the banana cream pie - both were tasty. It was the perfect end to a perfect dining out.",1,,
5,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,4.0,9/16/2017,"Stopped in for lunch specifically for the sushi burger. Was surprised to see a prix fixe is also available for lunch (but too bad for me the sushi burger isn't on it)The sushi burger had all the flavors I expected and enjoyed: spicy yellowfin tuna, wakame seaweed salad, watermelon radish, ginger, and avocado sandwiched between black sushi riceThe sushi burger is best eaten with a knife and fork. Also tried the lobster roll which was impressiveBoth dishes are light yet satisfying options for lunch The sushi burger I believe was debuted in 2016 here but Redeye Grill has been around a long time with a large menu focusing on steak and seafood. May have to return to try the meats next time.",2,,1
6,Steph G.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",282,87,22,5.0,2/25/2018,"Made a reservation before coming here on a Friday night. Was surprised by the live music and the delightful service! The focaccia they bring around at the beginning is soooo good I'd go back for just that (we also had cookies and brownies fresh out of the oven brought around on the baking tray at the end of our meal). We each ordered a glass of wine, the sushi burger of course, and the fish tacos. The tacos were very meh compared to how great I'm sure other menu items are so I wouldn't recommend that- but the sushi burger is a must!",2,,
7,Karsten V.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",219,107,194,1.0,7/26/2017,"One of the most overrated places that I've gone to for lunch. Located on 56th and 7th, Redeye was a bit disappointing, considering that there are numerous better options in the area for a nice business lunch. Seating on the outside makes for interesting people watching, but the food and service leave a lot to be desired.The chicken wings were really mediocre, barely drizzled with sauce that brought some flavor. A fellow luncher at my table had the kale salad - the presentation was really horrible. It literally looked like food that would be better suited for a cow. I'm giving them a star for the miso glazed cod, which would have redeemed the experience, except that the service was a bit slow. We got here for a 12 noon lunch before the usual suit and tie crowd did and the service was still slow even with only a few people in our section.There are better places to go if you'd like lunch in this area.",1,1,

I ordered the Rainbow Roll and the Grilled Asparagus, and of course ended with New York Cheesecake. It was all perfect. Know that the sides are all meant for two. I dined alone and had to take home most of my side.",,,

Updated review","This was a delicious and perfect late lunch!We shared the Cheeseburger, which was really tasty, and the Lobster Mac n cheese, which is divine, and to die for!Then we enjoyed the chocolate cake with whipped cream - about the best dessert of my life. Our server was no nice and attentive (Kay ?). What a lovely restaurant and great experience! Highly recommended!",,,
10,Jessica M.,"Houston, TX",252,207,393,5.0,1/26/2018,"VEGAN burger was delicious, ask for window seating it's the best, the staff is friendly and on it !!!

11,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,4.0,4/12/2017,"Came here for brunch with a couple of friends and had a great time. Reservations were easy to make on Open table. Restaurant was spacious, modern, well decorated, and comfortable. Definitely a little more upscale than your typical casual brunch place - as it is located in mid-town. There was a mix of both casual and business attire. Was really impressed by the food. It has a seafood inspired menu (hence - the food being more on the pricy side). Our table ordered the hot dog, poke salad, and sushi burger ($22). It was the biggest hot dog we've ever seen - almost a foot long! The sushi burger is an item off the menu. My friend found it on Instagram - and so glad she knew about because the sushi burger was amazing! So much better than the overhyped ramen burger. The spicy tuna was fresh and had a lot of flavor. Great texture with the rice and nicely seasoned. The poke salad was little overpriced in my opinion - just go to pokeworks and you get the same portion for half the price. Overall, great food and atmosphere. Food was delicious and service was friendly.",2,2,2
12,Laura B.,"New York, NY",298,78,85,5.0,11/14/2017,"The service here is incredible -- you feel really loved and taken care of from the minute you step in the door! And they don't judge you if you take multiple huge chunks of the free chocolate bark at the door. They understand you.I want to bathe myself in their brussels sprouts and the warm cashew-y sauce they come in. Could eat them for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snack. The vegetarian sushi is GREAT. I've officially converted to a black rice fan. Down with white rice!Amazing selection of mixed drinks and the bar staff are all knowledgable and excited to help with wine pairings or talking about your feelings. Portions are big and the live music is always fantastic, so it's worth paying the high-ish price point. You won't find anything better in this area!",1,,
13,Richard P.,"Manhattan, NY",6,1,0,1.0,4/4/2018,"The dinner was okay for the most part, until this happened: Adjacent to the Host's desk, my partner was facing the window and I was facing the interior of the restaurant--gorgeous, by the way: warm lighting, high coffered-ceilings, earthy and erudite wood paneling, and art-deco murals celebrating the city. Deep in the shadows of the interior, I had noticed whilst we ate our dinner a gentlemen jacketed and pomaded with a crisp green and white bowtie dashing to and fro with two trays of graphed goodies. We didn't foresee the amuse bouches, but were delighted as any fine-diner might be and anticipated our own private presentation. As he drew closer, they appeared to be cookies. Yum! He darted behind the on-point! musical entertainment for the night to an alcove of guests, and we knew we were next! My partner made eye contact with him as he swiftly came up a step to our section of the restaurant, carrying a choice of sweet treats for us to indulge in. Then he darted to the table behind my back, closer to the window. I thought, ""Did the cookie-Kris Kringle just 'Get Out'-Challenge our table?"" We were confused, and witnessed his next move mum. He slid to the adjacent window table. Then the next. Then the next. Then back to the table next to us. He zigzagged to the corner offering and thanking, offering and thanking. Until he had turned the corner and made his way to the interior of the dining area.Was it supposed to be paired with alcohol? We had neither beer nor wine nor liquor. Why not tell us?Was it supposed to accent certain entrees? Some had not ordered yet, some were on their way out. Was it our wardrobe? Other tables had jackets and dresses while my partner wore a gray pantsuit jacket and I wore a linen striped dress-shirt. Or was it as simple as racism? My partner is a dark-skinned Jamaican woman (#BGM #melaninpoppin) and I'm white. Every-other-table was ostensibly white, but certainly light-skinned. I couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the week and gave the gentleman every possible benefit of the doubt, but the process of elimination has left me with no other choice: he silently and cowardly bypassed our table because she is black. After we discussed what just happened, he had curled behind a pillar with the trays and, though I got up to address the gentleman, he had disappeared into the kitchen. We resolved to inquire with our waiter, a manic bohemian with a distractingly Moe-ish haircut who seemed simultaneously inattentive and anticipatory to the predicates of all of our sentences, especially this one: ""Excuse me, the gentleman with the trays--"" ""RIGHT AWAY, SIR!"" and off he dashed to retrieve what his darting eyes observed we did not yet possess. He rushed back with a plate of gingerbread morsels sprinkled with sugar pebbles and cheesecake-frosted brownies. He left as soon as he had dropped them off. He had neither the time nor we the temper to address the issue in the moment. We settled our bill (twice; our waiter overcharged us the first time) and left. E.B. White wrote in ""Here is New York,"" a romp of an essay, ""the citizens of New York are  tolerant not only from disposition, but from necessity. The city has to be tolerant, otherwise it would explode in a radioactive cloud of hate and rancor and bigotry...In New York smolders every race problem there is, but the noticeable thing is not the problem but the inviolate truce"" (47). A truce we had enjoyed up until that moment the bowtie dashed past. But the Lobster Mac & Cheese was phenomenal.",1,5,2
14,Johnny Y.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",72,52,18,5.0,4/15/2018,"I'm just going to say that the customer service here is impeccable. We were greeted by the person at the desk with a handshake and was already expecting us! One thing that they did that stood out was when we got to our table they had sat us done at the wrong table but we were comp'd with free onion rings, guac and chips and champagne. They said we are sorry to make you wait longer than your reservation and for sitting you down at the wrong table. We had group of 11 for a birthday reservation and almost got full off the appetizers. The waiter was also nice to bring out cotton candy for the whole table and not just the birthday boy, made everyone feel appreciated!  I wish I took pictures of the food but it was amazing! I will be coming back here for the amazing customer service!'",2,,
15,Joanna N.,"New York, NY",846,415,2009,3.0,2/21/2017,"My experience at Redeye Grill was a solid 3 stars. I had bookmarked this spot a few months prior when I saw a mouthwatering video featuring the sushi burger. CG and I stopped by for an early dinner before heading to see Book of Mormon. We were seated promptly after arrival.The vibe here is very classy and upscale. Definitely a business meeting or date type spot. There's also nightly live music which we got to hear a bit of towards the end of our meal. We were offered foccacia or pretzel bread to start and split the calamari as an appetizer. The calamari rings were very small but I loved the taste and texture -- super crisp and the batter was light and flavorful. As for entrees, the sushi burger is not listed on the menu but you just have to ask for it. Our entrees took about a half hour to come. We were not in a rush but this was annoying since we we hangry. Anyway, after my sushi burger finally arrived, it was just ok. The idea is cool and the mix of tuna, avocado, seaweed salad and cucumber was delicious but the burger did not hold up well. After a few bites, the whole thing just became a mess. I will stick to eating sushi with chopsticks. We also ordered the lobster and truffle mac to split. This was very underwhelming. There was a ton of lobster but not even a hint of truffle. The mac was drowning in a watery cheese sauce. The worst part was that it was served just warm -- the top layer of cheese was just hardened and sort of floating on top. Expensive meal for just ok food and spotty service. I'm glad I got to check out the sushi burger but am unlikely to return.",10,2,3
16,Alyssa C.,"Providence, RI",91,307,505,5.0,9/23/2017,Came here for the sushi burger and loved it! I went in the afternoon on a week day and there wasn't many people there. The service was fast and helpful. We also started with the guacamole and chips which was great. The sushi burger was filling and really flavorful. It was probably the equivalent of two rolls. I'd like to go back another time to try other things on the menu. The location is easy to get to - I used the subway and walked.,1,,
17,Jason M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",47,59,34,5.0,3/18/2017,"This is an amazing spot for a pre-concert dinner before heading off to Carnegie Hall! The service was very attentive and I like being able to make reservations on OpenTable. We had a reservation for 5:45pm and made it just on time for our 8pm show. Delicious food and prime location!My girlfriend and I both did the prix-fixe dinner (starting at $49).-- fried calamari: very big (and rather heavy) appetizer, but we appreciated it! The yuzu mayo it came with was great! One of the best plates of *fried* calamari that I've had.-- yellowtail sashimi: pretty good sashimi, especially for an American restaurant. The only problem is the plate it was served on: the sashimi stuck so much to the plate that it was hard to pick it up, especially trying to keep the avocado with it. We made it work, and it was tasty!-- filet mignon ($10 supplement): absolutely delicious filet. It seemed like it could have rested a bit more, because there was a lot of liquid and blood on the plate. The lemon parsley butter on top was great, and the fries were pretty good too.-- salmon & wild mushrooms: my girlfriend really enjoyed this, and it was perfectly cooked with nice crispy skin. Lots of great mushrooms as well. Well-balanced dish.-- tiramisu: not the best I ever had, but quite nice.-- chocolate cake: quite heavy, but delicious.-- coffee: just your standard light/medium coffee, but they brought it to us in a nice little teapot.",1,,

We started off with sushi burgers. They were incredible!  Definitely lived up to the hype from other reviewers. Note: they aren't on the main menu. You have to ask for them. We also got a side of Brussel sprouts. They were drenched in oil but were tasty. For dessert we got banana cream pie which was unbelievable. One of the best desserts The only negative was our waiter. We had to ask him for bread, everything was painfully slow, and he forgot to bring out a side dish. Will definitely be back for more sushi burgers!",6,1,3
19,Risa S.,"New York, NY",4,194,385,4.0,1/14/2017,"Overall experience was nice and all staff members were super friendly. My friend and I came here on a Friday night before a concert at Carnegie. The place wasn't packed yet (tad before 6pm) but by the time we left (a little past 7pm) the seats were pretty full and live music was playing too! We both got the sushi burger with black rice and a side of lobster Mac and cheese. The sushi burger, we thought, was pretty good but it def needed more sauce mixed in it. I'm sure we could have asked but we didn't. It was super filling too (mostly from the rice buns). Also, it's not on the menu but don't fret. Just ask your server and they'll take down the order :) The mac and cheese was okay. It's a big portion. They have chunks of lobster on top and drizzle of truffle oil. But the putting the topping to the side and just eating the Mac and cheese...I've tasted and can make better. My friend and I were so full from the sushi burger that we ended up eating a good chunk of the Mac and cheese but then just eating the lobster chunks at the end.lol. The owner or manager of the restaurant stopped by our table midway. Super nice and friendly but he def kept most of his attention to my friend. He acknowledged me but you can tell by his body language and eye contact that he cared about how my friend found out about the sushi burger (even though I was the one who suggested it). My friend laughed but he did notice it too. I felt a little excluded by that but whatever. We both had a glass of wine and I think the total came up around $102 (without tip). I should have checked how much the sushi burger was but I'm guessing it ranges between $25 - $30? Don't quote me on this though! Overall, 3.5 stars but I'll bump it to a 4.",3,1,1
20,Iryna G.,"New York, NY",146,27,21,4.0,2/2/2018,"I am not sure why this place has only 3.5 stars, it deserves more.First of all, the staff was wonderful! The staff was in a meeting, so the manager took our orders promptly, taking care to recommend some specials. They have a great menu selection (which is on a pricier side). But I knew what I came for, which is the sushi burger! We ordered two sushi burgers and lobster Mac and cheese to split between 4 people. And believe it or not, that was enough to fill me up. The Mac and cheese alone was sooo rich and full of flavor that it would've been enough for me. Now the sushi burger was very good, especially the sauce, but the taste was exactly as if you were eating a tuna poke bowl, only in burger shape (which actually easily fell apart). So even though the burger was a great experience to have, it was a bit underwhelming and I think a pole bowl would've been more worth the price. I was a bit surprised by the lack of choice of wines by the glass, it seems they basically want you to order by the bottle. And in conclusion, I think this place is a solid 4 star.",2,,

Music is a good mix with the oldies and now music genre.On the other hand,  the food are so so.I ordered three bones prime steak, it's way too salty. The only thing to balance out is mixing it with mash potato.My wife ordered their own signature Hanger Steak, came with kimchi rice, it's way too sweet.Again had to mix it with the sour and spicy kimchi rice to balance out the flavor.I understand the idea to eat the main course with the side dish to have a complete flavor, however, pls consider the idea to have the main entree by itself, the flavor not to overwhelmed.Overall, for night hang out, i recommend the place.

Service was a little slow but nothing horrendous happened during our meal. Ultimately our server was quite helpful, particularly since we were on a tight schedule.Request a table with a view and you'll enjoy your meal doubly. Though the sushi burger isn't on the menu, check it out if you're into that sort of thing. We ordered one with white rice and one with black rice. I do not recommend the black rice burger because it's not as sticky as the white rice... and then falls apart on you. That's probably the only main negative I'd take away from this trip.

The restaurant is on the upscale side and the burger is not part of their standard menu. The burger was served very quickly and the plating was well done. The patty itself was made up of spicy tuna and included what I believe was seaweed salad, cucumber, avocado, and pickled ginger as fixings. The rice bun had some pieces of seaweed and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The sauce flavor was quite zesty and refreshing with a spicy aioli drizzle, but there was a bit too much for my liking. Initially, the burger held together well. However, as you eat more, it becomes extremely difficult to keep it together. By the end, I was finishing up with my fork. All in all, it was an interesting experience. I was able to get some decent photos (a bit difficult because we went for dinner and the lights are dimmed) and try something new.",5,3,2

31,Joann L.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,100,70,3.0,10/15/2016,"I would give it a 3.5 rating. Saw all the images of the sushi burger on instagram and I wanted to come to try it for myself. For some reason the images on Instagram gave me the vibe that this was a casual place, so luckily I checked out yelp before coming since I found out that it was more of a dressy place. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and inside was pretty dim when we came in and there was a decent amount of empty tables when we came since we did come for dinner at about 5:30 pm on a Friday. We got seated immediately facing the front of the street. For food we decided to order two sushi burgers (since they were the reason we came here) and we also ordered the lobster truffle mac and cheese. They came around with bread prior to the meal which was a tad too salty for my liking. The food came out pretty quickly which was a plus since we were starving. The sushi burger did not disappoint, it was absolutely delicious. The flavors were amazing together and it was so yummy. The only downside was that it was very difficult to eat. I started eating it like a burger but after a couple of bites it was obvious that the rice (which was used as a bun) was not going to hold up if I continued to eat it. I ended up eating it with chopsticks and a knife. The lobster truffle mac and cheese was just alright, it was pretty creamy but I found that some parts were a bit too salty for my liking and it was a bit offputting after a while. The service was pretty good in the beginning but after it got more busy it became more ""meh"" but we did not really mind since there was a bunch of big groups around us. Overall, I think that I would come back for the sushi burger but I did not really see anything else on the menu that really popped out to me and that I would really want to try so I do not think I will be back for a while since this place is pretty pricey.",3,1,
32,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,4.0,8/29/2016,"Excellence. I ventured here for a friend's birthday celebration last week. I've walked by this restaurant a million times, but never noticed it. Huge mistake.I arrived around 10 PM and was immediately greeted by the host; he located my friends table and I was seated. My group was there about an hour before me, but the waiter immediately brought me a menu for food and one for drinks. I opted for the patron margarita ($19) a little steep, but well done. I'm not a fan of tequila but the drink was awesome and strong. I opted for the rib-eye steak and fries ($28) and they both were cooked to perfection.The restaurant has intimate dim lighting that is perfect for a group outing or a date. Also, they have outdoor seating which is ideal for this time of the season.The waiter was attentive and helpful.

I had tasty steak skewers, the chips w/ salsa and fresh guac were addictive, and there was this vegetarian mini cup thingy on pastry dough which was the best. For my main course I had a healthy serving of steak which was top notch beef cooked to perfection (medium). I really enjoyed the mash potato as well which had pork grinds in it. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their regular menu.",1,,1

Went with the sushi burger, which was good but it's just sushi in burger form so it's just as pricey, and the lobster mac and cheese, which had a good volume and nice sized lobster chunks. The atmosphere is a bit pretentious but the service and food were good so I'd consider going again.",,,
36,Nick C.,"North Brunswick, NJ",27,142,76,3.0,11/3/2017,"Came here for lunch on a business meeting. Walked in and was immediately seated and restaurant was half empty. Waiter had an attitude and seemed annoyed when one of our guests had a question about the menu. Ordered off of the prix fix which included appetizer, entree and dessert. Salad was fresh but has a lot of dressing for my taste. Chilean sea bass came out nice and hot but was over salted-still a decent size for the price. No complains with the raspberry sorbet but very average. If it wasn't for the pricing of the prix fix I would've knocked the rating down to a 2. Main menu items were overpriced ($35-50) and portions were small. Waiter was rude. Would I return? No due to the mediocre food and rude waiter.",1,,1

Redeye serves up some iconic New York City snacks such as pretzels and hot dog but with more thought into it. I was here with my party for a late lunch one afternoon. I opt for their trendy Sushi Burger while my guests opt for the New York Hot Dog and the Ribeye Burger. We were offered a mini pretzel bun and butter to start off with. I thought this was quite unique item since I have not seen that before. New York Hot Dog made a jaw-dropping entrance. It is not your average New York City hot dog cart style. It is a long and big hot dog sausage on a toasted bun. Big deep-fried onion rings and fries came as sides. Ketchup, mustard, relish all came in another plate as well. This was a really tasty and filling dish all together. Ribeye Burger was tasty and filling. I thought it is on par with grill spots in New York City but nothing extra special. A safe choice.Sushi Burger was slightly disappointing. I thought the fresh tuna was overly dressed but the yuzu added a refreshing taste. Rice was a bit too hard for my taste. It is okay. It was served with soy sauce and pickled ginger.Overall, a decent business lunch spot that serves the purpose of business. At the end of our meal, we got cotton candy!",7,3,6

We could not even finish our food we were so disgusted and disappointed. The service was horrible, the bus boy gave us butter and Never came to give us bread. Our waiter never asked how our food was or if we needed assistance. I never like to give any Resturant a bad review, but the quality was so just so horrible it's unfair.

(Correction: actually, our server forgot a side dish of mashed potatoes we ordered.)There is a good variety at this restaurant, with burgers, meats, seafood, and an option for Prix Fixe. I wouldn't say there are many choices for each though (3-4 per section). The online Yelp menu is misleading.The bread given at the beginning of the meal was too salty, but that's pretty negligible. We ordered the baby kale salad, Lobster & crab lasagna, Salmon mushroom, chicken Schnitzel, Three short ribs, a side dish of mashed potatoes and tiramisu for dessert. I think this place is known for seafood, so it's notable that the lobster & crab lasagna was tender and flavored an appropriate amount. The salmon was decent but nothing particularly special. Now, the short ribs (which come with mashed potatoes!!) were REALLY good. Juicy, soft, it entered my mouth in a melt-in-your-mouth kind of way. The chicken schnitzel looked like a chicken patty, but squeeze lemon zest from the little bag given and you've got yourself a fancy meal. The chicken also came with an underlying layer of bits of dough dressed with what might be parsley. Interesting and tasty.P.S. Some of the art here is kind of inappropriate...",1,1,

We were not disappointed.We were warmly greeted by the manager, Mara, who was also attending to the hostess stand.Several tables were occupied. As it was 17 degrees, a temperature that doesn't register well when you're living in Miami, we were permitted to select a big, comfortable booth with direct sunshine.Our primary server, Sean,  appeared quickly and took our drink orders.My friend asked for a mimosa, and Sean made the brilliant recommendation that she get the ""bottomless"" mimosa, allowing her unlimited Mimosas, Bellinis, or Kir Royales.A very smart option as she mixed it up and had 5, all for the collective cost of $20!We each wanted egg-based dishes.She had a beautiful dish of poached eggs with spinach.My ""steak n eggs"" was a cleverly deconstructed omelette of Japanese-style rolled eggs sliced up with alternating slices of tender teriyaki beef on a bed of perfectly cooked sushi rice.Not what I expected but unarguably the most delicious variation on brunch!As a side, we also shared creamy mashed potatoes with gribenes.Throughout our meal, we received a fabulous amount of attention with zero interruption.Our server was assisted by another staff member, Mohammed, and Mara checked on us to ascertain we enjoyed our meal.She also recommended a slice of a dense, chocolate cake.When it arrived, we were overwhelmed by a piece of cake that could have served 5!And, it was moist, thickly covered in silky icing and satisfied my chocolate Jones for several days. I should mention that this restaurant has been in on the fringe of Central Park for nearly 30 years.The decor is comfortable.Exceptionally high ceilings (25 feet?) in a large, spacious main room lined with wood paneling and oversized colorful canvases by Red Grooms, a back room filled with large oil paintings by Mark Kostabi. A large fun wine rack composing an American flag is recognizable on the upper deck.Overall, a very, very good experience that I would happily reproduce next time I'm back in NYC.",1,,

Everything was great until I got seated, service and attitude of staff needs a little work.

Upon entering, the host was friendly enough, but the rest of the experience as the night continued left a lot of room for improvement.

So here comes the food.... well to start off, I'm a very discriminating Italian from LA. The pricing for one is extremely reasonable!!! Yes no BS, we had the king salmon and Chilean Sea bass. The portions were at least twice the size that we're used to. The presentation was 5star and well... for the taste????? OUT of this world!!!!

I picked the snow crab: they declined to maintain their offer for a free appetizer...- I picked ravioli lobster as my main dish, they didn't have it either. So I eventually got a salmon. Ordered bread too.- the salmon was served with 2 asparagus. Yes, 2. A side of rice or a couple more asparagus wouldn't hurt this dish, but they didn't have that. So I asked for French fries (assuming they'd probably have that and to save me from the pain to hear again ""we don't have that tonight"". - still no bread on the table at that time. - Ordered tiramisu for dessert.- when the tiramisu was finally served, I told them to forget about our bread (I had reminded them about 4 times all along the main dish).- tiramisu was a sort of cheesecake, didn't taste like coffee. Quite disgusting actually. All of this for over $100. As a comparison, we had a lovely time and great food in all other restaurants we visited during our trip to NYC, for the same price or lower.

The team of bartenders was professional and helpful. When one of them realized that he forgot to give my bf a glass of rose, he offered it on the house. It was very nice. We split the guacamole and a roll of tempura shrimp. The guac was fresh and chunky. Perhaps it was too chunky cause it was a bit hard to scoop the pieces. It also lacked salt but overall it was good. The roll was surprisingly large and filling. The restaurant didn't have a gluten free tamari sauce - I found it a little odd considering that they have a whole section with sushi rolls. Chopsticks were also not available. My partner got black cod, it was very flavorful but he couldn't finish it cause the teriyaki sauce was too sweet for him. I got the Cobb salad without lobster.

Our up charges totaled $20, bringing the meal for two, without beverages, to $119. We both ordered the crab cakes for a starter. Eh...not bad but we've had much better, and just recently. The entrees were pretty good. My husband said his fillet was great and it was cooked to perfection. I had the roast chicken. The flavor was good and the portion was large - half of a small chicken. It came with half of a tomato, cut into two quarters and roasted. No vegetables...not even three or four haricot verts and a baby carrot. I also think it could have used some pan juices (finished with some white wine) lightly spooned around the chicken. Nothing soupy, mind you, just a little extra moisture and flavor.The desserts were good. I loved the berry sorbet. It was delicious and light. My husband ordered the chocolate cake and said it was pretty good. The slice was big and so was the sorbet serving.All in all, nice, vibrant atmosphere, good wait staff, decent food but not over the top. A solid three stars. We would go there again.",,,

Actual came to this place only because it was on the way from my the office to the hotel. Menu was mostly seafood based and they have a live band. How could I resist! Started off with a Manhattan to drink. Hey while in Rome...you know the rest. Well, one of the best I have ever had and I have had a lot. Even left the shaker at the table so I could get every last drop. Nice! Ordered Miso Cod and their world famous onion rings. I know , strange combo but I am a sucker for good onion rings. Food took a while but that's ok. Gave me time to savour my drink and listen to live, badly played and poorly sung 70 's and 80's covers. How great is that. Got to love a bad band covering Prince.  The place was hoping.  Wishing Burd was here with me to take it all in. Well, the buttermilk battered onion rings were crazy good , although not as good as Harry's.  The dish could feed a family of four. Got to love portion sizes in the US of A. The Cod was nicely done , if not too nice. Was hoping for something a little different but definitely a crowd pleaser. Overall a nice place, maybe a little conservative.   Would definitely recommend it if you are in this part of Manhattan .  Everything is good in NYC. Please come again.",,,2

Food would always hit the table before silverware. You know the feeling when you get the soup before the spoon. It's like that with every course. The sushi burger is definitely worth a try at 22 dollars a pop. Salad was the best of the appetizers we ordered but still just ok  and the rest of the apps were ok.I would go back.

The lobster was ok. Two people in our group orders the prix fixe menu and thought the food was so good for the value. The service was fantastic.

I wanted to come here because I kept seeing the sushi burger posted on Instagram. It's not on their menu but definitely worth it. You can't really eat it with your hands though, it falls apart.

90,Mitch B.,"Fanwood, NJ",115,102,29,3.0,4/3/2017,"Extra points for being unique.  Any restaurant that passes out house made chocolate, cookies, and cotton candy as part of their service deserves some extra points.Food itself is okay.  It's not great, but it's good....the negative to being ""not great"" is that they charge ""great"" prices (as to be expected in Manhattan).  I had the dover sole and it was sufficient, but didn't have anywhere near the flavor I would expect from such a flavorful fish.    My wife had the seafood lasagne, which was actually quite good.  For a restaurant known for their clam chowder, I found this to be ""okay"".  Not great, but okay....certainly nothing that I'd rank in the top 5 in manhattan, as they claim.  Onion rings were excellent.The rest of my complaints have to do with the staff...and I really hate to do this because they were VERY friendly, but it just seemed like they didn't know what the hell they were doing.  They do the whole ""remember your order"" thing, and then proceed to get it wrong.  My son (14 year old) is an unbelievably picky eater, so we needed to ask for some slight tweaks - nothing insane, but things like ""steak sauce on the side""...pretty normal requests.  Pretty much anything outside of standard got ignored.  The lack of attention to detail pretty much pervaded the entire experience even beyond that: I ordered a stone crab claw for an appetizer.  It came out cracked, as one would expect, however I was also provided a cracker, a fork to pull the meat, and dipping sauce....which arrived about the same time as our appetizers were being cleared from the table.  In addition, in the two hours we were there, trays had to have been dropped a dozen times.  It seems that throwing crap on the floor is just what they do when things are getting too quiet.  There must have been 15 glasses and 2 dozen plates broken during the time we were sitting there....it happened with such frequency that all five people at our table were looking around for the hidden camera.The service was PAINFULLY slow....for a party of five, it took a bit over 2 hours to have dinner...and mind you, we got there at 5PM, BEFORE the dinner rush started.  I certainly don't think the place is deserving of the one star beatings that it's taking here in terms of the food itself...but it's unlikely that I'll be coming back.",,,

The place is huge with a very jazzy upscale ambiance and there was even live music in the corner which was really enjoyable. I split the sushi burger as an appetizer and got the lobster and crab lasagna. The sushi burger is completely overrated and nothing special. For $20+ dollars you get what is basically just a lump of stale hard rice with a tiny bit of tuna on top. It's a gimmick and completely not worth it. Thankfully my lasagna was really good and the serving was huge and had a generous amount of lobster and crab. However my cousin ordered the shrimp and crab cake which was the same price ($38 yikes) and just got a tiny crab cake and 4 shrimp. Probably won't be coming back as I don't think the food is worth the price point but the ambience is very nice with a snazzy interior so it might make a good place to take someone for a fancy date night.,,,

The restraunts hours were posted, and said it closed at 11:30. I dont like going places that close to closing time for several reasons. Anyways i had an appetite after the show and the walk there, this place was right across the street from where i was staying so it was convenient.I ordered the ny strip cooked medium with fries. The steak came out and it was perfectly cooked. Nice char on the outside and perfect pretty pink on the inside. I ate every bite of that 16oz prime dry aged piece of meat. I think it was 54$ for the steak and fries. It was on par with other steaks ive had from places like capital grill and the palm and flemings to name a few.The wait staff was wonderful, very knowledable on the menu and very attentive to the tables needs.

Now, it looks like it was purchased my foreign investors and has become a tired establishment. The food is 3 star quality and so is the service. The live music is a nice touch but the night I was there, it was similar to a bar open mic and not the greatest. This place has potential but I don't think ownership is interested in revitalizing it and making it the spot it used to be. It's worth stoping in for a drink and a bite to eat but that's it.

We were looking for a fun, classy-yet casual place for brunch while visiting the City.  This was it.  We were greeted and served by Renee, a delightful gentleman with impeccable and attentive service. He was personable and friendly.  Since we arrived early before the place started getting full, the General Manager Richard Sanchez came over and had some great recommendations. The Creme Brûlée Stuffed French Toast was honestly, the best I have ever had. It was luscious and creamy inside with a crisp burnt-sugar coating on the outside of the toast...ughhhhh...yes yes yes!  My wife wasn't sure wha to get and Richard suggested the Japanese Omelet with Steak.  It was glorious!  Juicy slices of rib-eye laid and slices of rolled Japanese omelet all laid over sushi rice complimented with a sesame asian sauce.  It was unexpected and just perfect.The highlight of the afternoon (and a hidden gem of the Redeye Grill) was the $19.50 all-you-can-drink Mimosa or Bellini special. The day before, we paid $15 for a very so-so bloody mary at another local bakery / restaurant near Central Park.  This hit the spot and the Redeye kept them coming.All in all, the service, food, and decor here were top notch.  They also have live music most nights and we hope to head back to listen and sample some other dishes here.

There were 7 of us there for a business dinner and they treated us like royalty. The staff really directed us to try some fantastic courses. I would say that if you are there on your own dime and not a corporate account they have a great Pre-Fixe Dinner offering that is well worth the value. We started the night with the seafood tower, Hamachi poke, and Tuna Belly tartar. All were very fresh and delishious. More than enough for 7 adults to share. Main course consisted of 5 rub ribs, crab and shrimp cakes, Chilean Sea Bass, NY strip steak and more. But dessert was decadent! I highly recommend trying the Banana Cream Pie.

The nudes adorning the pillars, heavy, rich wood walls and floors, flowers filling in the empty spaces gave the immediate distinction of upper class American fare.Having had the opportunity to sit for dinner on more than one occasion with splendid company, I've sampled a few of the wonderful appetizers and entrees. I've not ordered anything off the fish & seafood menu, but did have a shrimp off the plate of my close friend (Mick M) who ordered the Lump Crab with Shrimp. Scrumptious to say the least.Currently I'm not recollecting the name of the sushi rolls we ordered, although not a traditional American dish, all of the choices we ordered were absolutely splendid. The ruby red tones and background spice of my non Hess, Cabernet Savignon worked perfectly to help me take down my 12oz Center Cut Filet Mignon.

Both my friends ordered the Crab & Lobster Lasagna and they both agreed that it was amazing & delicious with the right amount of meat (which was real) and sauce. We all give this restaurant all 5 stars ' definitely recommend trying if in the area!!!,2,,
123,Christian S.,"Evesham Township, NJ",241,408,390,4.0,1/1/2014,"Once my Wife and Mother nixed my choice of lunch from the Burger Joint at the Le Parker Meridian due to the line of tourist, and visitors stretching out of the door. Contemplating our next move, we decided to take a walk west on 56th street. Hungry, tired, and a bit grumpy we stopped in front of Redeye Grill to gather our thoughts. Now I usually do my best to avoid eating in Midtown due to the prices associated with these eateries catering to the out of town visitors but something said to come inside.  One of the major highlights of this meal was my wife's Miso Matzoh Ball Soup. They combined two of my wife's favorites into one bowl. I am not the biggest soup person but that was an excellent combination of ingredients and flavors. In addition to the soup we also had a half-dozen oysters and calamari. The calamari was some of the best I've tasted and the oysters instantly were a great start to a meal. The wife went with the pre-fix lunch menu and had the braised short ribs. My Mother and I were both torn between two items, the Redeye burger, since we were initially planning to have burgers, and the crab cake BLT so we both decided to order each item and share. The crab cake was pretty decent and the bacon was a good addition. The burger was very good! Really good! You know I had to take a stab at the braised short ribs; excellent. The meat was super tender and filled with so many flavors. I was visiting my hometown of NYC for the second time in two weeks last Friday to once again take another family member out on the town to see all the Christmas flare around the city. After stumbling across Red Eye Grill tired, and hungry, I am glad our tired feet made us walk inside. The ambiance is excellent, the service was excellent, and the food was excellent. Once we were done with our meal everyone was all smiles and I was ready to tackle the crowds once more. Fate intervened, and I now have another establishment I look forward to visiting while I am in the city. P.S. The wife and I were truly happy with our dinning experience that we really considered paying for the New Years Eve package right then and there",6,,1

Our waiter Sean was friendly and knew to give us our space and yet was always available. The good was good, large portions. I had the tasting menu: calamari had a nice kick and not too much breeding. 2 pound lobster was cooked perfectly. Tiramisu was delicious.

Came in out of the rain tonight and we were instantly judged by a middle-aged man who questioned if we had been caught in the ""to-be-expected"" rain shower? Wow. We had attended a show nearby and thought we could run for it....I do not appreciate judgement when about to pay a couple of hundred dollars for a nice meal on a Saturday night in midtown. We were told to wait until a table could be set up even though many two-tops were visibly available. Another group of two women (not rain-soaked) entered and were sat immediately - also with no reservation. We are patrons of many restaurants in this area and my husband has been here frequently with business clients. We will not be coming here again and my husband will be taking clients elsewhere.",2,1,

And of course, since my youtube channel is focused on finding all the BEST spots in NYC, I knew I just had to try this place out!And they did not disappoint! I made the mistake of thinking this place was a casual sit down restaurant. It wasn't until my husband and I walked in that I realized it was actually a beautiful, high end restaurant, and we (being dressed ultra casually for an expected ""casual"" lunch) stuck out like sore thumbs.They host was so gracious and offered to let my husband borrow a suit jacket from one of the other workers (because he was dressed in a tank top at the time), and did not turn us away. I thought that it was incredibly sweet of him to be so welcoming and accommodating!We soon found out that the famous ""Sushi Burger"" is actually on their SECRET MENU.

131,Scott H.,"Arlington, VA",60,300,116,4.0,7/8/2015,"Good food and service, a spacious, elegant dining room, and a balanced menu that offers up not only great steaks and other grilled meats, but plenty of fish and seafood options as well.I came here for the first time a few weeks ago and had a very enjoyable meal.  We started with oysters (very good, chosen from 3 East & West Coast types) and salads, which were also very good, owing to the just-from-the-garden freshness of the produce.For entrees, I ordered the strip steak, which was a great cut of meat, cooked exactly to order.  If I were to nit-pick, I'd say the only thing that kept it from being perfect was the exterior crust, which was good, but not quite as developed as it would be at a steakhouse like Keen's or Club A.  Still, the steak was delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My friend ordered 'off the menu', and requested the salmon with a sesame crust.  It too was cooked perfectly, and the staff had no trouble accommodating his request.  The sides (asparagus & fries) were excellent.  In fact, the asparagus here might be the best I've ever tasted.  It was incredibly fresh, cooked perfectly al dente, and was well-seasoned, with a subtle garlic note adding to the deliciousness.  Service was very good:  attentive, professional, friendly - everything you'd want.  Given the setting - an unusually large (by NYC standards), high-ceilinged room with plenty of space between the tables, elegantly furnished - this would be a good choice for a 'special occasion dinner'.  It's also good for mixed parties, where some might want steak, but others something else.  Compared to pure steakhouses, there are more (and better) non-steak options on offer here.  Finally, hats off to whomever is sourcing the food here.  As noted above, all the ingredients were notably fresh and high-quality, even when compared to other well-regarded restaurants at the same price point.  That attention to detail and quality really added to my enjoyment of the meal - bravo!",2,,1

It wasn't listed on the menu - we had to ask for it  maybe because we came during lunch time? The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. It was pretty busy but our food came out promptly. The sushi burger, in my opinion, was pretty expensive for what it was - a giant spicy tuna sushi. If I were to do it over, I'd share the burger with my boyfriend and have their other entrees which were pretty good. Their lobster Mac and cheese is extremely heavy so unless you're SUPER HUNGRY, skip it. Everyone was dressed up, def a place you could take a date or go for a special occasion.",2,,

The two performers were amazing singers/piano players. Service was very attentive and the decor was beautiful and high end. Although I stayed up near the front for the music it is a huge dining space. The food was all really high quality, and the price showed. The brussels sprouts were like none I have ever tasted, cooked with peanuts. The fried calamari was cooked to perfection. It's right across the street from Carnegie Hall so probably a good place to go before/after. The live music is nightly from 6:30-10:30 and a great performance.",6,1,1

The atmosphere is classy, almost reminds me of the bars the guys from Mad Men frequent. The bar is large and the dining area is pretty big too. There is a private room upstairs as well. As for the food/brunch set up. The menu is pricy but everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully served. Our waitress was accommodating, however it did take a while for our drinks to be served. She had to put a fresh pot of coffee on for me so I guess that's why it took a while. Also, if your looking to drink your way through your meal, drinks aren't served til noon. When we first sat down we planed to order the bottomless mimosas @ $19.50 a pop which seemed like a great deal considering we were going to have 2-3 while sitting down. Unfortunately we sat down at 11am and our waitress explained that they don't serve booze til noon, bummer!!! So wait til noon we did... And it was worth it Items we had included: salmon eggs Benedict, cartelized banana waffles and the feta and spinach omelet. Both egg dishes came with a side of salad and toast. Eggs Benedict came with potatoes too. Everything was delicious!",2,,

Right off of the bad, the staff bent over backwards to accommodate the four of us and the two small children with us. They were eagerly helpful repeatedly. Very good customer service. Aside from said dish above, the rest of the food exceeded our expectations, and they handled the problem dish as well as anyone could. No pushback, no unwanted charges, no nothing. Just plain and simple excellent customer service.The dishes that were our favs: the angus steak, the sesame tuna, the trout, and the currant and wine sorbet, and the cotton candy they gave the table for free as a consolation for the problem dish. Easily the best cotton candy I've had. Tons softer than normal.",4,,

We shared a piece of cheesecake that seriously ruined all other cheesecake for me - out of this world, DON'T MISS IT. One in our party who never gets desserts and had the banana cream pie as she'd had it before and it too was supposedly amazing. The quirky spinning huge metal shrimp over the entry and fish carvings at the bar made the space unique and the location across from Carnegie hall was perfect walking distance to most hotels in the area.

In terms of food; just great. Came in at brunch time, so I ordered a burger. Presentation and taste wise; not your average burger, not exceptional, but just a great burger, well cooked and great taste. It was rather quiet when I came in, but it started getting busier around 4:15! Great playlist; classics from the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel and so on, great tunes to enjoy an Old Fashioned to!

I'd assume it's not on their menu for lunch. We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese as well as a half dozen of raw oysters. The lobster mac and cheese was cheesy and had a decent amount of lobster. Raw oysters were fresh but was small, we just thought it could be slightly larger for the price we're paying.

The Salmon was a bit overcooked and started to dry and flake on the sides.  The meal was nice, but not  memorable.  It felt overpriced. I was basically paying for the ambiance and not so much the food.  It seems to be a nice place for lunch but wasn't really a dinner quality meal.  The biggest selling point is the fact that it's across the street from Carnegie Hall.",2,,

I had called to make reservations before to write on a plate congratulations on a new job! When we sat down champagne was brought out and hostess said oh we celebrating new job. It's supposed to be a surprise. I was so upset! Then the cake was brought out with no writing on the plate! I spoke with manager and they apologized for confusion and gave us desert on the house and also the cotton candy!!! I had red eye birder and their secret menu spicy tuna rice burger (black rice). Loved the atmosphere!!! Love the rice burger, pricier then it should be but worth trying it one time! Be ware cake size is big good for two people!!!",,,

171,Jeff G.,"East Rockaway, NY",5,102,0,4.0,10/25/2016,"Friday Oct 21, we had tickets to see Jeff Dunham at Carnegie Hall for 8pm. Our original intention and prior plan was to have dinner at Carnegie Deli considering they are permanently closing. When we got to the deli and saw how long the line was, we knew our plans had to be changed quick, While walking around, My son said a steak sounded good after looking at the menu outside of the Red Eye.So we walked in and recognized a similar atmosphere similar to Sullivans steakhouse.Very nice place, live singer, pleasant staff. We both ordered NY strip steaks that were cooked medium as requested. steaks were OK, not the greatest. The mashed potatoes was a huge portion but nothing special, no garlic or seasoning at all. The fries should have been steak fries, not skinny wimpy fries. We also both ordered the appetizer, a vegan split pea soup which was excellent. Overall we had a good dinner with drinks other than fries and potatoes. I understand we are in NYC  but for my son and I, the bill was 199.79. 2 Long Island Ice Teas were 30.00, 2 Amstel lights were 17.50 the 2 soups were 24.00. A bit over priced. My son didn't want the fries and requested the mash potatoes was charged an additional 6.00 and I make better mashed at home.Like I said, We are in NYC but at the same time, we are not tourists.",2,,
172,Cathy L.,"New York, NY",85,25,15,4.0,1/22/2017,"First time there. Will be many more. We had poke, kale salad, tuna roll, vegan pasta.  All were delicious. Reasonable prices for Midtown.  Great atmosphere. Background music, but quiet enough that we could enjoy our dinner conversations.",,,
173,Chris C.,"New York, NY",148,185,24,3.0,10/25/2014,"Average at best. I wandered in here with my parents that were visiting on a Sunday evening. For a place that shows up as a seafood restaurant the waitress didn't seem too confident about how good their seafood was, so we all went with meat dishes. The food was extremely overpriced, and greasy. I got the onion rings as a side and I couldn't believe how gross my mouth felt. I might as well had just drank the oil from the fryalator. Not good. If you are in the area try some of the other restaurants in the area. Heck go to the Halal Guys, you'll save $$ and you won't have to worry about if you are breaking out on your face. It's a win, win!",1,,
174,Alan C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,91,46,4.0,2/16/2017,"I have hosted large luncheons here and am always satisfied with the service and food.   my guests are treated as intimately as if we we're dining in a more intimate / smaller setting and feel welcomed.   food is always exceptional - the lobster cobb salad is a great choice for lunch as are the lamb, steak and all the seafood.  the shrimp cocktail is perfection as are the desserts, especially the banana cream pie and tiramisu.",,,
175,Philip W.,"Upland, CA",45,19,8,5.0,9/9/2016,What a nice and friendly place. The staff are over the top courteous.  We were treated to a great meal and wine with no rush or attitude.  I wish I could take this place back to LA with me. You must try the Jewish mashed potatoes omg they are good. I had steak that was done perfectly.  I had the brown rice hot pot as an appetizer what a presentation.  Nothing but nice things to say Rene was our waiter and took wonderful care.,2,,
176,Carrie W.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,7,0,5.0,9/9/2015,"I LOVE the Redeye Grill, always been my regular stop when I vacation in NYC. This time was even better since I met Glynna, the manager. She offered me suggestions to try different menu items, I normally get the same thing everytime. She is a genuinely a kind person who knows how to make a customer happy. (I have a few dietary restrictions). I ate there twice in one week, everything was wonderful. My recommendations, the Crab cakes, Tuscan chicken, guacamole and any of the desserts. Actually everything I saw being delivered to tables looked delicious. The wait staff are polite and very knowledgeable of the menu. Beautifully decorated and the seating is comfortable. I recommend it to anyone visiting the city. Ask Glynna for recommendations!!Across the street from Carnegie Hall.",2,,
177,Thomas K.,"New York, NY",247,20,10,4.0,12/25/2016,"I would've given this place a 3.5 stars but gave it it's other half star because they did well for how busy it was (Christmas Day).When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by a warm and welcoming staff member who joyfully introduced himself and escorted us to our reserved table. Our server was kind but due to the holiday, couldn't give us his full attention. We were on a tight schedule since we were having early dinner before watching a broadway musical. Our server did a very good job expediting our meal which is why I gave the restaurant the extra half star. I wish I remembered his name...With a family of 5, we ordered 1 appetizer to share of a dozen oysters, 3 pre fixes and 2 entrees.The oysters tasted fresh although it took quite a while to just get them out... maybe 25 minutes after our order.My order included their Alaskan crab legs as an appetizer which was AMAZING! Full of meat and quite filling. My entree was their 8 oz filet mignon done medium well. Cooked exceptionally! For dessert, we were able to try all 3 of their desserts provided by the pre fixe: tiramisu, chocolate mousse cake and sorbet. They were all just Okay...My mother chose this restaurant and I was happy I was able to come here. They had great customer service and the food was good although a bit pricey since almost most items on the pre fixe menu had a supplementary charge. I would recommend this place to others!!!",,,
178,Samantha L.,"Elizabeth, NJ",184,273,13,3.0,12/22/2015,"So I had a really odd dining experience here last night. The restaurant was not busy. I would say less than half full. I ordered a ginger ale- never got it. Ok, no big deal...Waiter came to take our order. Ordered a Rib Eye and then the waiter asked what sauce I wanted on the steak. I asked for the Oscar sauce. He said that was not a sauce option and that it came with the Oscar dish and something about asparagus. I was really confused as it was clearly listed under the column ""Steak Toppings"". Ok, again, no big deal. I was not about to go back and forth with the waiter about it.The final straw came when our food arrived and they informed me that my side of onion rings was no longer available as they have run out. How are you going to wait until my food comes to tell me that one of my sides is not available? Wouldn't it be a good idea to inform me at any other point during my 20+ minute wait for my food? So very odd.With regards to the food, it was good. I can't really complain about the taste of the food but I highly doubt I will return with the plethora of dining options in NYC.",,,
179,Shivani C.,"Austin, TX",543,32,0,4.0,1/22/2017,"Loved the sushi burger (on the secret menu I think), but probably would not go for anything else. Seemed like a normal, overpriced seafood restaurant. Large space, quiet ambiance, classy and old-style.",,,
180,Amanda P.,"New York, NY",181,24,1,5.0,8/1/2016,"What a great date night spot. Live music, delicious food, and a tasty cocktail list. The decor is interesting because it's casual yet classy. The menu had so many interesting items I didn't know what to try but ended up getting the tuna and it was cooked to perfection. I've had guacamole everywhere and I have to say (though a simple dish) theirs was awesome. The guacamole was made with pine nuts and the chips definitely were made that night because they were still warm. Highly recommend this restaurant.",2,,
181,Jeannie H.,"West End, Washington, DC",0,2,0,5.0,1/17/2017,"This is my favorite place to eat a leisurely dinner when I'm in NYC. The food is reasonably priced and a really good value overall. The atmosphere is laid back and the wait staff are just the nicest. This is a place where locals go and where they get to know their repeat customers and treat them well. Not a touristy place, which is why I like it so much. When I eat here, I feel like part of the community.",,,
182,Eugene M.,"Santa Monica, CA",8,56,8,5.0,6/17/2015,"This is a great restaurant -- now one of my top three for steak with excellent service as a bonus. Steak and fries is my test for any restaurant and Redeye Grill passed on every count. We started with the Dragon Roll sushi special. The soft-shell crab was cooked perfectly and served still hot. Carol had the crab cakes appetizer as her entree. It must have been okay because I did not get any, not even the usual half-hearted offer to share. I ordered the 20-ounce bone-in NY strip, medium rare with fries. The steak was cooked perfectly and was so good the memory of it brings tears to my eyes. Hence the name Redeye Grill? Seriously, this was one great steak.We finished with banana cream pie -- fantastic  -- and coffee. Other reviewers have described this pie and are correct, it is wonerful with a thick graham cracker crust that is the best I have had in about 70 years. The coffee was good, hot and strong.One of the things I notice in well managed restaurants is there is always plenty of staff and they are all busy. This is the case with Redeye Grill. This is a great restaurant and good enough to bring us back to Manhattan just to try something else.I know that my enthusiasm might make you think that my child owns this restaurant but, sorry to say, this trip was the first time I have heard of it.",2,1,
183,Sharkus N.,"Westchester County, NY",5,93,257,4.0,12/13/2013,"I had a business dinner here last night and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.Normally when I go for steaks, I only choose from the top three or four steakhouses in the city, but this location was convenient for my client.The restaurant itself is huge and packed.  Tables are very close together and there was a great buzz in the atmosphere.  I could see they also have private rooms.The menu is extensive without overextending themselves.  Their specialties seem to revolve around seafood and steaks.I got the Caesar salad (good) and the prime rib eye ($49.00) which was outstanding.  Cooked just like I like it (between medium and medium rare) and it was a nice size, very flavorful and tender.  I am not an easy person to please when it comes to my steaks and I left very happy.The creamed spinach was so-so and the asparagus was forgetful.  The wine we had was terrific and the dessert wine was wonderful as well.  Desserts were banana cream pie (good) and cheesecake (excellent).Only knock I have is that the service, while quick and attentive, was not very polished.  While I understand this is far from fine dining, I felt they were a bit too casual for me.  Oh, and they forgot to tell us the specials.I'd definitely recommend Redeye Grill if you are confined to this area and you are looking for a great steak.",3,,
184,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,5.0,8/24/2011,"I usually don't splurge on a weeknight meal with my wife (and she can verify this) but after the afternoon shakeup of the great NYC tremor '11, I figured it was time to live it up , carpe diem and all that latin jazz.So why Red Eye Grill? Three words and these are the three most important words of my review (and there will be quite a few): Banana Cream Pie.Say it again. Slowly. Emphasize each word. Repeat. Look at the picture I posted. Close your eyes and imagine having this entire slice to yourself or sharing it. Ok, wake up.It's a whopper of a slice, a chunk may be more appropriate a title. And in the 14+ years of Redeye Grill's existence, the BCP has been present. (Business continuity plan?) Graham cracker crust, check. Jello-interior? Heck no. This is the real deal as in, real bananas are in there for your enjoyment. The pie is prepared on premises. I'd go back just for this pie. I almost forgot to mention the chocolate that graces the exterior. So the story so far has been one of dessert but what of entrees and appetizers? Opting for a backwards in time approach to reviewing, my entree was the surf and turf. The turf component was filet mignon but not the usual block one receives. Instead, it was neatly sliced and rested atop a bed of spinach. Enter the surf of lobster, riding the waves and using the filet as a boogie board. One slice of this triple threat revealed the combined flavors of land and sea. We shared a side of parmesan truffle hominy grits. I'm a total parmesan partisan after sampling this side. As an appetizer, we shared a lobster cocktail from the raw bar. Redeye Grill is known for various seafood specialties, such as the ice seafood tower, both 2 and 3 tier levels. Dancing shrimp is a house specialty too. There was enough tail and claw for two to easily eat.The dining room is large and spacious- no elbow banging here or overhearing of fellow diners' conversations. There's a large mural that features assorted Hollywood personalities having fun-- Marilyn Monroe and the Marx Brothers for example. I also spotted a painting of tasteful nudes for those who are into that.Our waiter was extremely personable, going so far as to show us the tray of desserts we could have had if we didn't order the BCP right away. He's been there for 14 years and seemed to actually enjoy what he was doing. No disgruntled staff here!I'd easily fly the redeye to have the banana cream pie (and more) from this restaurant. Dinner for two with drinks was about as expensive as a round trip ticket from Chicago to Fort Myers.",6,2,4

It was a busy Thursday night 6/8 and when i arrived I was asked by Richard, ""Is this a surprise?"" I said we did not have a reservation and was told it was a 10 to 15 minute wait. At one point I noticed that another couple came in and Richard went over to talk to them. When I said that they came in after us, Richard responded, ""Are you calling me a liar? These people have been waiting in the back for a table."" I was not going to argue and I have never seen Richard before in my multitude of visits. 45 minutes later we were seated. The food is wonderful. The table wobbled and was fixed once but continued to wobble. ASHLEY, assisted Richard and she is an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT. Without her calming factor we probably would have left.
