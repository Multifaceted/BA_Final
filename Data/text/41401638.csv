0,Russell W.,"New York, NY",37,143,0.0,5.0,9/28/2018,"This is one of my two favorite diners in the city (the other being Mansion on York). The service here is really good. The diner food, while the same as every other diner, somehow feels cleaner, tastier and more like actual food than most greasy spoons. People here tend to remember you when you come back, remember what you ordered, which drinks you had etc. They do not deliver which kind of stinks, but they are worth leaving the house and walking past a half dozen other diners to get to.",,,1
1,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3652,952,2095,3.0,9/30/2018,"Needed a quick lunch and it was pouring outside so stopped in at the Madison. It doesn't look like much from the outside...I would put it in the diner category instead of a restaurant. What wasnt great about it was the not the most friendly service. The lady didnt seem like she wanted to be there. Not the the best.The one really great plus is they have good wifi here. I had to get some work done and it was so clutch that wifi was available. I ordered breakfast for lunch which is the beauty of diners. Two eggs over medium with sausage and avocado.  Very hearty lunch but everything was good. Eggs made just the way I like them, the sausage was on point, and the avocado was fresh.  What more can you ask?!I would definitely come back. Yes the service wasnt great but who cares. The place did the trick.",17,3,12
2,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",907,317,518,5.0,9/25/2018,"Neighborhood diner on 1st Ave with a low key atmosphere and HUGE menu. We came for Sunday brunch and spent 15 min debating what we should try. We ended up splitting an item on the bunch menu - the Madison omelette.The bunch items come with toast, coffee or tea, mimosa/screwdriver/bloody mary or fresh juice, and fruit bowl or melon. Such a great deal and since we weren't super hungry, was great they let us split an item! The hash browns were golden brown and tasty and the omelette (unexpectedly in small pieces) was different but tasty. The feta gave it a rich texture and flavor. The cake display contains beautiful desserts of all colors all with many many layers. Looking forward to coming back for brunch and to try all the cakes.",,,

The food is one of those places that has all of the great traditional diner options, but the food is better here than other diners in the local area. The eggs, potatoes, meats are all cooked to perfection. You can almost always get a table quickly. Great for a quick pit stop when you have a group too. They are the nicest people. Can't go wrong.",,,

The waiter had THE worst attitude, messed up our food, hovered over us when the bill came, told us to leave him a good tip, and then had the audacity to ask what tip we were leaving him as we were still signing the bill! We had to ask him to leave us alone while we were trying to sign the check and leave. We gave him a poor tip, as deserved, and then he FOLLOWED ME AND MY FRIENDS FOR A BLOCK AND A HALF yelling at us. It was the weirdest, worst experience I ever had. If you go there and get an elderly gentleman as a waiter, with little teeth, RUN!!! Zero stars if I could give it.

The menu gave me sticker shock as soon as opened it eyeing what I saw was essentially $30 for all dinner entrees. Sandwiches were a tad more reasonable but with fries not by much. That being said they entrees here were massive and seem to be made for two people not one. I ordered the chicken parmigiana with pasta and no human being of average size could eat the portion they provided. I happily ate half and took the other half to go home in a doggy bag. Might come back due to the convenience and the desire to always go to a local diner for breakfast. Comfortable and clean",,,

My fiancee's burger was very thick and unseasoned I should also make mention of.Also, food is way too expensive.  Diner up the street is on average probably 3 or 4 dollars less per dish.  Please do better.",2,,

Updated review","The Madison is pretty decent. Although their menu extremely diverse, with more option than most, the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a cheap bite, this is really not the place to go. Almost everything on the menu is fairly expensive, yet the price is definitely justified by their portion size-- almost everything is huge. What really sets the Madison apart is the atmosphere and interior. Whenever I go to the Madison I just feel happy. The aesthetic feels classical yet comfortable, and the waiting staff are some of the nicest people out there. But, what really ties it all together is the soothing jazz that is being played throughout the restaurant, and while that may not be a plus for others, it certainly pleases me. So, if you're looking for a decent moderately priced breakfast, lunch, or dinner, then stop on in to the Madison. Enjoy your meal and enjoy the misic.",,,
12,Lynn R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,56,7,3.0,12/18/2017,"Giving this a 3 star because they can do better. What happened to the friendly diner like on the west side?For the price you can do better, repeat for the price. It's a local staple but the same sandwich can depend on the wait person, the day and the tky.! I usually get basic tky, or an omelette. Have had all kinds of experiences  the same 2 orders. How is that possible say you? I don't know but it's true. Everything from soft and delicious tky l&t to getting that skirmish almost sick. I should probably give it a 3 1/2 star I am being a bit of a tuff critic with them. It's because for the prices they can do so much better.",1,,
13,Farah K.,"Rockville, MD",58,180,393,3.0,12/14/2016,"Me and my friend grabbed a quick brunch here. She ordered a cheese omelette with hashed potatoes and I got the Monte Cristo.The biggest plus here would be the proportions. My Monte Cristo was gigantic. There was no way I was going to finish more than half.Now the minus for me at least was.. the Monte Cristo itself. Generally I thought the meat was kind of sealed between the slices of the bread before the whole thing is dunk in batter and then deep fried. However mine was served open face. No gooey melty cheese either, as it kind of congealed and hardened by the time it was served. And also no side of jam, just syrup. Considering my expectations, the reality was slightly disappointing. My friend also said she found her omelette to be a tad bit greasy.Fast service though. But in a place like NYC, there's plenty of other options for a better brunch.",,,

15,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,2.0,3/12/2017,"I really wanted to like this place because let's be honest, there's not an abundance of casual restaurants in the neighborhood, and even less so good breakfast spots.I ordered pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and turkey bacon. These are all simple foods, virtually impossible to screw up, right?Well I'm Canadian. And one non-negotiable must is having my pancakes with maple syrup, and I mean the real stuff. The maple syrup aspect is so crucial to me that I even asked the server ""do you server real maple syrup?"" and he said yes.As I'm sure you can guess, I received my pancakes with a warm pot of some gewy sugary chemical. It was nasty, my pancakes were tarnished. I'm not one to make a scene so I just dealt with it.My husband had ordered some grotesque version of a croque-monsieur that consisted of brioche smothered in a disgusting amount of Swiss cheese (and I'm a cheese lover but enough is enough), with ham between both brioches.I'd be reluctant to return but I wouldn't be aggressively opposed to it. I felt the syrup deception was very troubling, but maybe I'll get over it.",1,2,
16,Jenn G.,"Atlanta, GA",5,138,103,2.0,5/3/2018,"It always blows my mind when I see how crowded this place gets for brunch on the weekends .. I live across the street and this is the last place I would go in the neighborhood. When we first moved in, we used to frequent Madison because it was opened 24/7 (did business hours change recently?) or it was opened early enough in the morning that we could grab breakfast after my overnight shifts .. And every time we visited, we were always stumped by what compelled us to come. In the past, we have ordered their omelettes, bagel with lox, French toast, chicken salad sandwich.. the portions are HUGE but the price reflects that (most menu items ranged $12-20+). More importantly, the food was just bland .. it felt like I was consuming a low sodium diet. I will say, however, they make a great French toast with challah bread but everything else fell flat. I feel like people that come here enjoy it because it has a great diner feel with large portions, and the service is great (they fill up your water before you're even half way done)  .. But man, the food just sucks, especially with the many great competition around.",,,
17,Robert J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,1.0,7/27/2018,This must be under new management. There is no supervision and the service is absolutely horrible. We used to go there for great diner food.

18,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,4.0,1/21/2016,"After my routine work-out at the gym, I hit up the local diner just a block away. Service was quick, the waiter seated me right away and had my coffee within 30 seconds. They have an extensive menu here, obviously breakfast could be served all day but they also have a large selection of sandwiches, burgers, and dinner entrees.For me personally I'm a breakfast guy. I ordered my own combination 3 egg omelette, with mushrooms, bacon and cheese. It came with a huge serving of home fries and buttered toast. The omelette was cooked well, and I really loved how they did the home fries, they julienne them here and they had just the right amount of crisp.I couldn't leave without dessert of course. I decided to have the cheesecake with a side of ice cream. A few minutes later the waiter came out with a big slice of cheesecake topped with strawberries and blueberries with an equally generous scoop of ice cream. Now I'm pretty sure they don't bake their own desserts here, but still whatever bakery they order them from is pretty damn good. I liked that the cheesecake was chilled at the perfect temperature, I've had the misfortune of hurting my teeth trying to bite into a frozen cheesecake at some other restaurants before. But no, here the cheesecake was cool but creamy and smooth, just the way it should be.",9,4,5

I say that I'm working out more than I really am and that I am eating salad to get healthy. And when you want to lie to yourself about eating salad, you order a Cobb salad. However, not just any Cobb, this place has THE Cobb. A nice big, fat salad that would make Elaine from Seinfeld wake up in feverish sweats about. After you're done you feel almost guilty about it (Is that right? Can salad make you feel guilty?). I've looked all over and I haven't found its equal. I even went to Texas. It's got a ton of bacon and they throw a whole avocado on it! It's not like a couple of slices of avocado that some other places give you. This place throws a whole freaking avocado!!!! It's obscene! Yeah, the chicken is extra, but so is my food b0n3r. It's so worth it. It's not like some premade rubbery chicken they have lying around in the fridge. They cook it fresh and pile it high. It's seared with the Maillard effect all over it so the chicken cutlet has a nice tasty crunch. THE Cobb had so much chicken on it, I had to turn on my fan at my desk from the meat sweats. Soon the office vultures started circling from the smell. I instinctively snarled and barked at them like a ravaged dog with a bone and I highly recommend you do the same with your office vultures. You may get some strange looks and a polite call from HR later, but at least they'll leave you alone with you and THE Cobb. When you dress THE Cobb up, you want it made up like a cheap date. Just glob it on. All over. Cause it's going to run out halfway through this thing anyway and you'll need to pour on more. It has some random radishes thrown in, but I don't mind them. It's like Scarlett O'Hara's previously undiscovered craving for a peppery radish in the middle of her journey. And just like Scarlett O'Hara, when you are eating this salad, you'll shake your fists at the heavens screaming, ""I'll never go hungry again! As God as my witness, I'll never go hungry again!!!!"" Anyway, there needs to be a rule about how many people can order this at one time to maintain quality control and make sure it doesn't get any more expensive than it already is (the biggest downside). Like no more than 5 at a time. If anyone goes over that, then I'll throw bananas at them. That's right, because I'll go B-A-N-A-N-A-S . . . which they have. I've tried some of the other stuff which can be hit or miss. So stick with the tried and true . . . like THE Cobb.",,,

Not only was the chicken salad absolutely bland and tasteless, it also came on stale bread. BF's mom also did not get a pita but a hero roll. To top it all off, the waiter never filled our waters unless we specifically flagged him down. The total was around $60- which I thought was outrageous for the meal we had.

For some inexplicable reason, they had hidden the ham underneath my pancakes and placed the scrambled eggs on a separate huge plate where they looked really small and lonely. It was an unnecessary waste of space and really confusing because they had stuffed all of my friend's meal onto one large plate.The pancakes were dry and difficult to eat. I don't think I even finished one, and the part that I did eat, I had to drown in syrup in order to get it moist enough to chew. The eggs and ham were the only palatable parts of the dish and I had to settle with eating just that.Our waitress took her time getting to us to finish up our meal and settle our checks.

There were many huge chunks of avocado and tons of cheese in the omelette! It was LOADED.The sausage and eggs were plain, but I wouldn't complain.  The hash browns which came with both dishes were also kind of plain; I'd probably add more spices to it to add some kick!I would definitely come back here, there are too many items on the menu I'd want to try and the service was pretty good.",6,3,5

There were a good number of people inside and they had a good Yelp rating so we decided to check it out.The greeter was friendly and quickly seated us, but our server was unbelievably grumpy. Maybe she was having a bad day, but she was impatient and rude. I had one egg sunny side up, which came with two slices of toast and home fries. The egg was decent and probably the best part of the meal. The toast was already cool when we got it and a bit rubbery, and I wasn't a fan of the whipped butter. The home fries had also cooled down and were oily and crunchy? Not quite sure what they were going for there. Luckily, I LOVE ketchup and anything with ketchup can taste loads better.I was extremely disappointed by this visit, but looking at all of the other reviews, maybe I will have to give Madison Restaurant one more chance.",2,,

68,Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",896,694,903,2.0,7/4/2013,"My in-laws have a crashpad in the area which my wife and I use from time to time. This area, in general, is just utterly dreadful. Walking around here is like being an extra on the set of ""The Walking Dead.""  I'm 41 and feel like a child in this part of town -- a child on the set of ""Flesh-Eating Grannies,"" that is...  #scaryI open my review with this because I lived on the Upper East Side for many years so I grew accustomed to living among really decrepitly old rich people. Contrary to popular belief, they don't want to eat brains.  But they do love their diners! Unfortunately, they have very low standards for their diner fare.I know the place I like to go to when I sleep over at good ole Plaza 400. I won't name it here for fear of Yelp's review filter singling me out for shilling. That doesn't actually matter, though. What does matter is that you may find yourself stuck in this area one day, using Yelp to try and find something to eat, and maybe -- just maybe -- you'll stumble upon my review and think twice before going to the Madison.To be fair, this is not a 1-star review. I am very careful about separating my 1-star reviews from my 2-star reviews.The Madison Diner (I love how they recently changed their name to ""Madison Restaurant"") is your typical run-of-the-mill, sub-standard diner. Nothing is totally awful. But nothing is really all that good. Of course, you wouldn't know it by the crowds that flock here. Sorta like food virgin lemmings who relish quantity over quality -- the hallmark of just about every diner in the Tri-State area. I was raised in New Jersey, so I know a little bit about diners. Diners are great when you're 18 and stoned and out late and dying for a burger to cure your munchies.But I'm a grown-up now. (I use that term very lightly.) FWIW, I love really greasy, almost-scary food. Straight up, I like anything that tastes good. But everything at the Madison is just so definitively BLAH. And to make matters worse, the booths are about half the size of a normal diner booth, and there are so many tables packed in together that you can barely navigate the space if you're sat in the back. (But I guess 75-pound old people stack up nicely.)Oh well.  Service was very nice.  There's that.  The food is not their fault.",5,2,3

Then the staff got into an argument of ""he said, she said"" and no one ever told me they'd fix it or they were sorry.  It was a joke.Waiters and waitresses/bus boys seemed very interested in joking around with each other and socializing with each other.

It's one of those meals that fuels you for your entire day and (for me at least) puts you in a happy mood. I wasn't one of those kids in high school/college that had a bite of a nutrigrain bar and called it a day. I'm a eggs/toast/hash browns/oatmeal kinda gal. I find that some of the best breakfast spots can be found in diners (good ones.) Madison is one of those places. Came here for a bite and prepared myself for the long line. Luckily we were only a party of 2 and I think our wait time was about 15 minutes. Not bad for NYC on a Sunday --late morning. Larger parties, beware. The wait was about 45 minutes. So when in doubt, arrive early. Madison has a pretty extensive menu like most diners do. I was torn between the cinnamon raisin french toast and the eggs over easy (my go-to) since those hash browns looked very tempting. I opted for the eggs and was very pleased with my decision. Everything was done well and was reasonably priced. I like that Madison is out of most tourist's reach and they have a decent selection to choose from-- Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner -wise.

I should have asked to move but didn't as the place filled up fast...which was evident by how long it took to get our order.Food was typical diner stuff, the cheddar cheese was stringy. The corn beef has skimpy in the portion. The toast, not buttered, was served cold. Yes, many folks have god reviews and clearly it was packed with local regulars - but I wanted to share they were not the friendliest place - I had one waiter stare me down and had me move out of his way after I paid.To many options in NYC.  This was not a good one for us this day.",6,,

Recently, we have found that the Madison is going down hill. A short time ago, they stopped serving any veal entrees, claiming the cost has gotten too high. Why they couldn't just raise the price is a mystery. Their delivery people now seldom speak any English and often do not bring change for cash payments. Orders have been delivered incomplete. Food at the restaurant has gotten worse, often arriving at the table cold. One waitress got our order completely wrong and brought the entree before the (wrong) salad.

However, turnover is pretty fast. You are seated in cramped quarters, so I hope you don't mind the people to the left and right of you hearing your conversations, and vice versa. I found out that the couple to my right were planning their wedding. Really, you can't help eavesdropping. Service is diner-like. Friendly enough but cursory. Now... the FOOD. The French Toast is made with Challah Bread which makes the best French Toast I've ever had. I know I said it already, but it deserves to be said twice. The taste is slightly sweet but bread-y (not a real word), and the texture is amazing. It's got a soft center that is the right balance of ooey gooey and fluffy. Awesome. I don't even like French Toast, but this was amazing. I ordered the Belgian Waffle, which was good, but the French Toast definitely stole the show.

The menu is huge, including breakfast all day, lunch specials, weekend brunch and dinner specials. But to quote the guy at the table behind us, ""with prices like this we could be at a 'real' restaurant."" The prices are on the high side - $7.95 for my 3-eggs, homefries, toast combo, and about $13-14 for the Greek salad, but entrees range from $16-$30 for pasta and dinner plates.The plus is that with the exception of the weekend breakfast rush, you'll get a table (or a booth!) and the huge menu means there's something for everyone, making this a great place to take groups or visitors looking for a low-key meal.About what we know: The Greek salad - go with regular size. They go heavy on the feta, and the grape leaves are bland & smushy. Breakfast plates are winners here, with big servings of homefries (actually potato shreds, no veggies in them, no spices), and bottomless cups of coffee.We saw a deluxe waffle sundae come out and it had about one entire can of whipped cream on it. The waffles are a step above the ones you'd make in a hotel breakfast lobby. The shocking winner last night was the chocolate cream pie - excellent diner pie. In all, this is a diner with NYC prices, decent service, plenty of seating, a huge menu. It's A-OK but not so great that I wouldn't try others in the area.

Walked in by myself to read the paper and relax, I asked for a booth and was told that because it was around dinner that they reserve the booths for parties of 2 or more.  I said ok and sat at a small table.  I get my water and deciding what to order.  Another person walks in by themselves and they get seated at a booth.  I actually like the diner but the place was empty and the staff was clueless and rude.  Very odd for a service establishment and how they treated a repeat customer.There are many places around here and I would recommend you frequent places that actually appreciate their customers.  This place is off my list.  Rudeness does not deserve patronage.",2,,

It smelled terrible and looked like gooey chicken dropped into brown sawdust.

108,Erin H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",43,211,23,2.0,4/22/2014,"Ehhhh really not my favorite place. After walking around all morning I did a yelp search of breakfast in Midtown.Madison Restaurant looked promising.I walked in around noon on a weekday and the place was surprisingly busy, which, again, looked promising.I sat down and before I was even given a menu the waitress rushed over and asked me if I was ready to order. Um, no? I kindly explained to her that I'd never eaten here before and that I need a menu to make my decision. One of the busboys overheard the conversation and brought over a menu before we were even done talking. Yay for that.However, the menu was weird. There was no organization to it at all. In my menu the breakfast items were smack dab in the middle of all the pages. Weird. So clearly, this place caters to regulars who don't NEED to look at a menu. Okay, thats cool. That must mean the food is good, right? Unfortunately I was disappointed with my meal. I ordered coffee, berry french toast and a side of home fries. All were underwhelming. The coffee was watery (which I've come to expect eating at a diner), the french toast was just weird (too eggy, maybe?) and the home fries had no taste whatsoever (well, except cheap oil). I was also slightly uncomfortable eating here because the table I was seated at was apparently right in front of where all the busboys stand to observe whether people needed more water/coffee/etc so I had a busboy standing directly behind me, looking over my shoulder literally the entire time. You know that icky feeling you get when you can feel someone watching you? Well, thats exactly how I felt here. I actually felt like the person behind me was actually trying to READ my book. Not really...now I'm just exaggerating. Anyway, not-really-long-story-made-unnecessarily-long, I probably won't be returning.",2,1,

With a capital ""S.""I realize this is a typical diner, so my expectations are appropriately calibrated and low. They still managed to disappoint me. Staff is inattentive. Utensils and plates were dirty. My coffee cup was chipped, grimy, and sitting in an equally unappetizing saucer, with a hastily torn napkin under the cup to mop up the coffee spilled in it, with a couple of pre-packaged milk-thimbles balanced next to a dirty spoon.I ordered an omelet with fries. They brought it with hash browns. I did not bother sending it back because it would have delayed my meal and forced me to stay in this over-crowded, unpleasantly over-packed dump longer. Oh, and the vegetables in my omelet? They had the precise cuts and consistency of mass produced, generic frozen or canned vegetables that were probably picked and packed during the Reagan presidency, and had the distinctly generic pallor and flavor that screamed, ""I am a spewn forth from a factory machine run by the food-industrial complex!""My companion ordered the tuna melt. The bright orange slice of semi-melted cheese (which could be a pieces of formica at a different temperature and specific gravity) sat atop cold tuna, stuffed between two generic pieces of rye toast. When she protested, the waiter insisted that it was supposed to be this way but he could microwave the sandwich, yes, microwave the sandwich with tuna fish in it, if she wanted it warmer. She did not and sent it back. By now this whole experience was so unpleasant that she decided to forego ordering anything. I hurriedly ate my food and we left. As we were paying the cashier, my companion mentioned the (hitty, with an S) tuna melt and he shrugged his shoulders and said we were not charged for it. Well, thanks for that, pal! You did not charge us for terrible food that we did not eat!Worst $21 I have ever spent! Do not go here unless you want to put yourself in a foul mood and risk getting salmonella and e-coli poisoning.",3,2,1
110,Feroz Q.,"Manhattan, NY",111,18,1,1.0,12/29/2013,"If I could give them zero stars, I would.To give you a background, my roommates and I order from here at least 2-3x a week as we live 2 blocks away. This is my horrendous experience trying to order a vegetarian Eggs Benedict on 12/29/2013.The biggest issue is that their order takes do not speak proper English. In the food business, being able to understand a customer's order is basic, if not the most important thing.After being 20 minutes late, calling twice to verify my address, they delivered the wrong food. I am Muslim and do not eat pork, and made sure to ask for no meat on the eggs benedict. Of course, not listening to me, they put Canadian Ham on it. When I called back, they apologized and promised another dish is on the way. 20 minutes later, they change their mind and the restaurant calls again and says I'll need to give the old dish back. (Remember, it has now been over 1 hour).After leaving the food out and giving it to my roommate (who does eat pork), I let them know that I obviously can't give it back unless they want to come and get it from his stomach. The manager, Kazi, refuses to send another order until I somehow produce the old meal and gives the phone back to the order taker. I ask to speak to him again and am placed on hold. After waiting several minutes, I call him again, and after 10 minutes of explaining, he finally decides that they will send me another meal. Instead of being apologetic, he rants for another 5 minutes about how I should know what I order.Whatever happened to customer service? Their order takers and managers LITERALLY fight with customers instead of speaking like humans.This is New York City, there are hundreds of better and fairly priced diners out there. I would not waste my money on this pathetic excuse for a diner. Sub-par food and absolutely horrendous customer service that ruins your day. Kazi, and the restaurant management, you just lost 5 loyal customers from my household that will never order here again. I really hope that one 14 dollar meal was worth ruining your reputation on Yelp for and losing hundreds/thousands in business.",6,3,2

The food was pretty darn good and way better than average. I loved (LOVED) my beef Gyro platter. Huge portioning and fresh tasting. Gyro, fries and Greek Salad were all top notch.  Plating / presentation was great.My son loved his caesar chicken wrap but could not or would not finish it. It might have been a little bland for him because he was applying a lot of hot sauce (this place has both Tobasco and Cholula brand - extra points for this!!!). My mom loved, and raved about, her tuna salad sandwich platter. My only complaint is that they give (to those who order sandwiches / wrap plates) servings of cole slaw with sour pickles before the sandwich plates come to the tableThey should be giving cole slaw and pickles to EVERYONE at the table before meals arrive or are ready!Don't punish those who order more than a mere sandwich plate!!The cost of giving away cole slaw / pickles is relatively low; don't burn bridges over the small stuff.

This week I was looking forward to pancakes all week - not any old adulterated, brunchified hussy pancakes, but old school, American diner-style buttermilk.The mountain of frying-pan size cakes I had this morning was SO worth it. They were fresh, huge, and without any dry, crusty edges. My friend had an equally large plate of whole-wheat silver dollars, and they have a huge menu that covers all the other diner standards. The restaurant was full of happy families, and super clean - no sticky tabletops or floors. I can't give it 5 stars because of the service.

All around me customers eat huge plates of delicious breakfast food. I'm hungry, but am I hungry enough?? Apparently not. We had pancakes with egg and syrup (sooooo American) and french toast with egg on the side as well. Double egged. I can eat ... but I had to give in for this one and leave pancakes behind.

That being said... the side of hash browns accompanying my entrée  was perfectly crispy on the top (loved!) and my boyfriend's banana & chocolate chip pancakes were great. There can be quite a wait if you roll in early Saturday/Sunday afternoon but so long as you aren't adamant about sitting in a booth, you should be seated within 15 minutes or so.

They are huge omelets that come with a generous helping of crispy hashed browns and two slices of toast. It is definitely more than enough to satisfy your munchies the morning after a drunken night out.The prices are kind of high for a diner, but I guess you do get a lot of food. There is so many options on the menu; I'm sure you'll find something if you're craving something in particular. The desserts taste like the ones that the supermarkets have in the refrigerated section, so stray away from those.If you're looking for a casual, no-frills restaurant with average diner food, this fits the bill.

My boyfriend drinks seriously like 5-7 cups of coffee anytime we eat out and his cup was never empty, they refilled it so fast every time. I wish I got our servers name he was so polite, fast and nice! We both got breakfast food, I did the belgian waffle with egg and bacon on side, and he got an omelette with home fries.. FYI they are huge!!! but everything was so delicious. I also had a bloody mary, it was spicy!! So if you like yours that way you will love it there.

You could tell it was made from homemade bread and was super thick. When we took a bite however, it wasn't even closed to cooked well enough. My boyfriend and I both ordered the French toast and both orders were gooey in the middle. So gross. We ended up just paying and leaving. I was so disappointed since I love French toast so much.

She was was so courteous and prompt throughout our meal. My vegetable omelet with hash brown and my side of french toast(substituted for the toast) were superb. The veggie omelet was fresh, big and full of great veggies. It was even better when I requested it with swiss cheese. The hash browns were a big hit with us. They were golden crispy and delicious.

Flour, eggs, nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce...I don't know...whatever the hell is in there. Madison does it to perfection. One waffle served to you right off the iron. Crispy.

The Deli only charges around $4 for an egg sammy if that much and it's 10 times better.  On top of that, the home fries here are terrible. They are simply just shredded and beyond bland.

Went there for brunch as a party of 2 and we were impressed with the huge brunch menu; they have all the classics here! Brunch also comes with a fruit cup or a slice (more like a huge chunk) of melon, and a drink (OJ, grapefruit juice, or something alcoholic), and a coffee or tea. If you think that's generous, wait until you get your food, which will come out fairly quickly on a HUGE platter. Seriously, we both got the bagel with lox and I think we both got an entire fish to ourselves. The omelet that the table sitting next to us had looked like it was bigger than the eater's face. And the quality of the food was pretty good!Overall, definitely a more casual brunch place that feels a bit cramped. But you would be going for the casualness, the speedy service, and the portions!

I don't think prices seemed unreasonable for Manhattan - 3 burger/sandwich type dinners (no fries; just the complimentary pickle & coleslaw they came with) came to about $27 plus tip.

187,Brad B.,"Wellesley, MA",0,11,1,2.0,6/29/2013,"We came as a group of 5 at around 11AM. The woman who greeted us at the door seemed surprised that anyone would want to come to their restaurant, considering she said ""Are you freaking kidding me?"" when a line of only 2 people was there in front of us. Not off to a terrific start service-wise, considering the restaurant wasn't busy at all and we were seated in only 2 minutes. However we were to learn that she was more than just a little frazzled...The atmosphere is that of a typical NY diner for the most part, but nothing about the decor, furniture or look and feel of the building gives any indication that they're trying very hard. It has a bland and uninteresting appearance inside. Not dirty, just boring.The menus are jam-packed with so many options that it seems almost inconceivable that they could produce the variety shown in the pages. Everything from Greek to Italian to generic American fare and breakfasts are available, and I began to get the feeling that the Madison couldn't decide what kind of restaurant they wanted to be.Having had a long night previously, we all ordered various sorts of breakfast food, which was served diner-style with hefty portions. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't anything amazing either. Pancakes were tasty enough, the french toast was thick and moist, and the meats and eggs were as you'd expect them. Nothing we ordered was outlandish; coffee, OJ and diner food made up the whole of our meal.We paid an impressive amount of money for this average meal, however, and with 5 people getting nothing but diner food cashed in at over $125! If it had been really impressive food with great service and a comforting atmosphere, we'd have considered it worth it. However the staff was very stand-offish and outright rude to us at times. We left a 15% tip, but didn't really have our hearts in it.On our way out, my wife went to use the ladies' room, and the rest of us waited outside. We were surprised to find out that while she was in the locked restroom, the woman who seated us banged on the door and shouted ""Your friends are looking for you!"" My wife was disturbed and bothered and when she came out to meet us was incredulously wondering why we had asked after her...but we hadn't. We knew where she was and weren't looking for her, but the crazy woman at the door decided to try and remove her from the restroom by lying to her that we were searching!I very nearly went back inside to demand what her problem was, but decided instead to leave well-enough alone and we went on our way.Suffice to say, we will never be returning to this establishment.",4,,

First, it was 7am, and we were sitting in a moving truck waiting for the service entrance of the building to open. At 9. Madison to the rescue-- nothing like breakfast mozz sticks! (Technically this was our dinner because the meal we'd had prior was a bagel we split at 12am).Anyways, the mozz sticks were fine. Nothing special, although they did come out piping hot so they definitely hadn't been under a heat lamp or anything. But it was $11, which is double what I'd expect to pay for an appetizer at a diner. I also wanted to get a soda, but at $2.70/pop, I ain't interested.Then that night, after having been awake for 55 of the last 60 hours and running on pure 100% caffeine, we couldn't bear walking more than half a block to eat something and immediately fall asleep. Madison to the rescue! I had the avocado and cheese omelette with home fries and a mimosa. YUM. I cleaned my plate, which happened to be an extremely large plate, and still managed to drink half of M's super thick milkshake (which was also YUM). He had the tuna sandwich which was blah, but what do you expect of tuna sandwiches? Has anyone ever had an exceptionally good tuna sandwich? Prices are considerably higher than we're used to (Market Diner on 11th used to be our go-to and we could both eat for $15, here that's the price per person) but then again it's a fancy neighborhood, the food is better, and it's more convenient.Regardless, we passed out full and happy.

My favorite belgian waffle deluxe with a side of hash browns which were enormous and very tasty. The food was still hot and fresh and there's still some left for the morning! Be sure to visit during brunch hours also!",,,
197,Dara R.,"Annapolis, MD",20,34,3,3.0,10/24/2012,"Tons of menu options here! Food was pretty good, unfortunately they were out of sub rolls and our waiter wasn't the best. One waitress was very helpful when we ordered the wrong dessert she was happy to switch it for us. Side of fries was huge, we got one for the table of 5 and it was plenty. The ""philly cheese steak"" was more like a roast beef sandwich if you're looking for a philly style. The table next to us did have french toast that looked really yummy. My mom liked her cornbeef sandwich!",,,

199,J D.,"Long Island City, NY",4,64,0,4.0,12/19/2011,"We always go here when we want diner food/brunch on the weekend.  I haven't had anything like their French toast anywhere else.  So good.  And they have delicious hash browns, seems like its hard to get these rather than home fries at a diner or restaurant.  Also, I love that the coffee is topped off constantly.",1,,
