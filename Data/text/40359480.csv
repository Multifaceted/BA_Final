0,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,80,74,4.0,11/20/2018,"I like Tacuba a lot, I've been a handful of times and have always enjoyed the experience. Their food is delicious, I really like their brunch options and their tacos. Pictured is the suadero, served with rice and beans. Delicious with a tiny hint of spiciness, can't go wrong. And the tangy house sauce they serve with their tortilla chips is awesome.Their margaritas are another draw, as the place seems to pride itself on its tequila selection. I have yet to try a margarita I didn't like, and I've had several on different visits.The space is great, very open and airy, with lots of light, especially in the back. Service is solid, if not a touch slow sometimes.So why four stars? As with a lot of my NYC dineout experiences, I can't get over the sticker shock. Some of the menu items are just too expensive, it feels like there are limited options if you're trying to eat at less than $25 per person (without drinks). Other than that, great spot in a great area!",,,
1,Laura C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",753,759,1634,4.0,11/19/2018,"Lovely spot that we made reservations for a pre-show meal. We need the energy and some drinks before a concert at Terminal 5 and my friends found this spot nearby. They were able to accommodate our last minute change in reservations with ease and sat us at our table the moment we walked in. Rarely does that ever happen!We got to chatting at our table and kept getting distracted by our conversation so we had to keep asking the waiter to give us some more time for decisions. We all started out with cocktails. I ordered the mango mojito (yum) and my tablemates ordered the coconut one. I tried a sip of theirs and it was also delicious.For starters we went with the guacamole that comes with chips and tomato salsa and the baked cheese dish. Omg that cheese. Forreal. Serving up some major salivation on my end right now. We each ordered tacos, which were definitely very small, but perfect size for us as we also had ordered sides and were feeling pretty stuffed up from the apps. I ordered the calabacita ones. The taco was pretty good, a little on the dry side. For sides we went with the Brussel sprouts and the plantains. Those plantains were amazing! The Brussel sprouts were very Brussel sprout-y. Which isn't a bad thing because i love the veggie, but it wasn't the best introduction to our friend who had never tried Brussel sprouts before!Our meal ended with tequila shots! As one of our friends doesn't drink tequila, the waiter was happy to knock that one back with us. All and all a good experience and some yummy eats!",4,1,4
2,Alexis T.,"New York, NY",131,69,147,4.0,10/23/2018,"I came here with a group of 9 for my birthday this past weekend. This place gets bussyyyyy. You'll definitely need a reservation, you'll be lucky if you walk in on a Saturday night around 6:30 and get a table (even just for two). So anywhoo I'll start with the cons, the only thing i didn't like was how we were treated by the hostesses. They seem to be upset that everyone in my party have not arrived. They kept peeking at the tables behind where they stand (which is where we were seated), and counting who was present. Pros: The food was very, very delicious. I'm not sure what the shrimp dish was, but I believe it had rice and some beautiful orange colored sauce on top; but most of my party ordered that and loved it. My friend ordered the enchiladas and she was in complete awe. I had the steak tacos with cheese, and before coming here I've read the comments on the portion sizes of the tacos, and thought ""hey it can't be that bad"". Let's just say the size of the tacos were appropriate for a happy meal. I am an adult, I love food, and so does my inner bitch. I have to feed her too, that simply was not enough. I also ordered sweet plantains, and i'm glad i did. I also ordered two coconut mojitos, most of my party ordered margaritas (which they raved about alllll night long). Also, an order of the Pina para la nina (someone correct me if i'm wrong. I think that's what it's called). Alsoooo our server Marta was fantastic! She was so patient with us when ordering food, and accommodating my guest and those who arrived late. She was very helpful when recommending what drinks we should try and asking us our preferences. Alsoo, I definitely appreciated the double birthday shots! All in all, the food was delicious. I've definitely had better food, but i would love to come back and give this place another try. Preferably, at a time when it's not too crazy. Thanks Tacuba!",4,,2
3,Karen J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",154,36,45,4.0,9/16/2018,I've been to the tacuba in astoria but something about this Manhattan location def has an edge to it... the food of course. Decided to mix the frozen mango n tamarind margarita you won't go wrong with this combo. The steak tacos are great I'd recommend them. I'd also say try the octopus appetizer taco I can't remember the exact name but you won't go wrong with that either. Staff and servers are very pleasant and attentive.,,,

5,Addy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1018,533,2282,3.0,11/6/2018,"I was meeting my acting teacher/mentor in New York City. We met in his neighborhood and started walking. He mentioned there was a hip and trendy Mexican restaurant on the block. It was Saturday afternoon so everybody was out brunching. We were able to walk in right away and got a cute table over by the open window. It was one of those brisk, sunny fall days so everyone was out and about wearing their best scarves and boots. We were greeted by our server, who seemed a little bit flustered. Very nice, but flustered. My mentor ordered a Diet Coke and I ordered a water with lemon. After 10 to 15 minutes we never got our drinks, finally when they did show up my acting teacher said his soda was flat. There was literally no bubbles. He sent it back and it came back flat once again. He settled on a water after that. Our server apologize and said it might be something in the beverage gun that they use. I ordered a salad and my acting teacher went with one of the breakfast specials. Our food came out faster than our drinks. We then ordered a few coffees so that we could chat. The environment was pretty busy and everybody was having a good time. I was surprised by the bill, it wasn't very expensive at all. This place is cute, but the service was definitely off. I probably would skip this the next time.",7,2,4

Updated review","Hope the owner appreciates her staff. The people at the front and welcome you are extremely friendly and the bartender also explained the food menu as well as suggestions on drinks. All of these things make up for the small portions and very good but not great food .The fish tacos were my favorite, the rice and beans were rice and beans. Might go back again because of the staff and the fact that is very close to home. I do have to also say that the place is very nicely laid out and and feels very homey. Not sure if it's always so quiet at 5:30 on a weekday but they might consider happy hour .",,,
7,Neel A.,"Frankfurt, Germany",174,226,416,3.0,6/24/2018,"Came here for dinner for two late on a Saturday night around 9:30pm. Very crowded, but were lucky and got seated right away.The menu is expensive. Lots of tacos options but they specifically state on the menu that the tacos are appetizer sized. I ended up ordering the chille relleno ($16) and my friend got the quesedilla ($13). The quesedilla was a comically small portion size and I laughed at my friend who ordered it after it was served. For $13, expected a bit more. The chille relleno was marketed on the menu as an entree but was similarly quite small. I enjoyed the flavors - creamy, spicy, cheesy, savory. Just wish I had more. The margarita I ordered was quite refreshing. Would come back maybe just for drinks and not dinner",3,,1
8,Priti K.,"Jersey City, NJ",582,536,706,3.0,8/22/2018,"I came here at 7p on a Friday night with a bff and we stayed until midnight -- so much catching up to do! Although in the beginning of the night the restaurant is quite packed and loud, so it's not a quiet place to talk just FYI. We ordered the classic margarita pitcher which was strong and I have it to thank for that killer hangover the next day. The ambiance at Tacuba is really fun, it's a bustling Mexican restaurant with cute decor. The space is pretty big and can accommodate a lot of people. I'd definitely say make a reservation on a weekend otherwise your wait will be long. I do feel like it's way overpriced for the food. The dishes itself were decent. I got the vegetarian tacos and we also ordered the rice and beans to share. We had particularly nice service on that night which my friend and I really appreciated. I think overall this is a fun place and can be very enjoyable, but unfortunately the food and price points don't match.",5,1,5
9,Nick B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,6,11,5.0,11/10/2018,Amazing food amazing service. I got salmon a la plancha  it was an explosion of really good food in my mouth and the dessert was amazing too. I come back for sure .,,,
10,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,6/6/2018,"Fun fun fun! We had a super fun girls night out at this place last night. We had made reservations in advance cause this place is quite crowded always. We started off with their signature pineapple drink. It's good for two people. I didn't think it was too strong though. For the appetizer we ordered the guac(of course!) can't go wrong there. They served along with their habanero sauce, which is real spicy. I am indian and I love spicy stuff but this way too hot for me as well! But mix it up with the guac you'll get a great flavor. I even liked the tangy tomato sauce they gave. The guac was well made. We hogged and finished it off in literally 2 min. For the main course all three of my gfs got the fish tacos. They are most popular ones and quite delicious as per their review. I tried the Chile Relleno. This was quite an interesting dish. The Poblano Pepper is stuffed with quinoa, mushroom and cheese, cream and salsa. This was an amazing dish and if people are not ordering it enough, then highly underrated. I absolutely loved it. The service was great. Very friendly staff and he catered to us with the most energetic smile. The crowd here was also very good. Would definitely come back, especially since it's 5 min away from my place.",1,,1
11,Jennifer J.,"Los Angeles, CA",437,39,31,4.0,10/31/2018,"We had a family dinner in NYC and needed a place that could accommodate groups but was good food also. So happy I picked Tacuba! They were great with a decent sized group of us (we ended up being 12) and the food was SO good! Get the guacamole for sure. I had the salad and loved it, and everyone's food looked delicious and they were all happy! Success! It was loud but it was NYC on a Saturday night. Wish I took more pics!",,,
12,Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",169,173,98,4.0,7/31/2018,"Quick stop for drinks and a bite before a concert, but I'd definitely come back!Margaritas on point. I started with a watermelon marg, which had actual muddled watermelon in it and not some lame sticky sweet syrup. For my second drink I decided to live dangerously and get a watermelon jalapeno marg......Mm Mm MMM! Not too spicy, made just right. Their bartenders know their stuff.Onto food... Guac, obvs. It was good/standard. We split the chorizo/octopus and carne asada tacos. Both were very good and come 4 to an order since they're sized for ants. I preferred the chorizo/octopus over the carne asada, but I would recommend ordering a variety and sharing with your table.The space is cute too, with plenty of nooks and crannies for different size groups.",6,3,3
13,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",202,215,342,4.0,6/2/2018,"I gotta say that it's a nice place. Located in Hell's Kitchen, it serves great Mexican food. Very good servers. We were super hungry but we got seated promptly( thanks to the fact that we reserved it in advance) please reserve before u happen to go on a weekend or on a Friday.We got their famous pina drink which comes inside a pineapple. It's a tequila based drink- well made. Perf for two ppl to get drunk on it. I got fish tacos which I must say were really good. The guac was on point-very tasteful. Overall had a good time. Tuna ceviche that we had, in my opinion,could have been better.",,,1

15,Carina P.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",674,378,382,5.0,3/18/2018,"I am officially obsessed with Tacuba. It is on 53rd so its a short walk from the heart if times square. The salsa that came with the chips and guac was spicy and had a thicker texture- absolutely divine. I wish I had more room in my stomach to have also had one of the quesadillas (burrata is one option, short rib is the other)Upon recommendation from a friend I had two skinny pineapple margaritas. You can order for two people and its served in a pineapple! Beautiful presentation, magnificent flavors and I did not feel guilty drinking it! Octopus and chorizo tacos were an interesting combination but some how Tacuba not only managed to pull it off but they were top 3 of the best tacos I've had in my life (and Ive traveled to Mexico on various occasions). Cant wait to return!",4,1,3

I came on a Friday night and was shocked that there were many empty tables! I recommend getting a reservation though, because later on, more tables started to fill up. It is nice because you can tell they put in a lot of effort into making their food taste great. The staff is super friendly and welcoming.",,,

Great food and margaritas.. However, when the bill came, there was an automatic 20% gratuity charged to our bill. (what I see now on the website is that 20% gratuity charged to parties of 6 or more, BUT we were just parties of 2) I see some touristy craps try to rip people off with 20% mandatory gratuity.. (I think it's super shady and sneaky especially when we were given no service really) and we might have looked like 2 tourists visiting.... Got itWe gave 2 cards to split, and the amounts were charged unequally. (And plus there were additional 20% tips suggested on the bill) I was trying to talk to the server but his attitude towards us was VERY aggressive and made us feel extremely uncomfortable. This has made the whole experience worst. I would never return to this place nor recommend to any of my friends.",6,,

I've been to 100 Mexican restaurants and this is the first time my sangria was ever made with tequila instead of brandy. Then the pancakes.... they were great, until I got to the bottom pancake and it was completely burnt and not edible. We told the staff-- only the bus boy who cleared my plate seamed to actually care. All they did was remove the pitcher of sangria from the bill as if they were doing me a courtesy.As someone who works in service, I expected more from the staff to try and rectify our experience.

28,Regine A.,"Bloomfield, NJ",75,111,157,4.0,1/9/2018,"Came to Tacuba for brunch on a Saturday with my best friend and we had a lot of fun. The restaurant was full, mainly with larger groups filling our area. We made our reservation for 1PM but arrived pretty early and were seated immediately. Tacuba is a bit on the pricier side for Mexican food but you should already know that going in. You're not going to your small, local family-owned Mexican joint where you can snag tacos for $1. You're in Hell's Kitchen. So the prices will reflect that. The place is beautiful inside (no shame in taking a few selfies and food pictures).An appetizer of guacamole and chips will run you $12 but that's pretty standard in NYC. Their drinks are so yummy - I tried out a watermelon margarita ($12) (I forgot the exact name on the menu) while my best friend got the Piña Para La Niña ($12). For our second round, we both got Paloma cocktails ($12). All of our drinks were so good - no overpowering tequila flavor but definitely did its job. As for entrees, I ordered the Carne Asada y Huevos/Steak & Eggs ($17). It was served with a cheese enchilada which wasn't that great but the steak was cooked to my liking and had great flavors. She got Enchiladas de Pollo en Mole ($16). I didn't give it a try but I think the fact that she pretty much finished the whole thing says a lot about the flavor! We ordered sweet plantains and avocado fries for sides - both we could have lived without. I had a few avocado fries, which were tasty, but not stellar. The sweet plantains, unfortunately, were not sweet. Not a deal breaker for the meal.. just won't order it next time.Fun times at Tacuba, would probably come back with a large group since they take group reservations! Also a few things to note:- Service was great - our server was very accommodating and friendly.- Coat check available if you need.",,,

And this place was a hit with everyonePlace has a nice vibe, decor & staff. We all ordered different plates but there was only one compliant with the food, their salsa for the chips & salsa was eh. More like a spicy sauce than a salsa. Another disappointment was the drink: piña para La Niña. I would pass on that one. But the food was all a hit. I ordered tacos with zucchini n other veggies. Order comes with 3 lil tacos on a corn tortilla. Yummy. I was a fan of the portion size. Kinda small in comparison to what one usually finds at Mexican spots but I find those a bit much so this was a pleasant deviation. Tacos came with a bowl of  rice and beans as well. Yum!

Updated review",If I could give this place zero stars I would. The food was okay. Extremely small portions. However the service was abysmal. The waiter would not take our order. He avoided eye contact. We had to have the bus boys bring us our drinks and everything. He forgot he had our credit cards. If I could just tip the bus boys I would. Our server was clueless! Avoid the Middle Ages man with hair in a ponytail.Update:Manager responded they were busy. When we first got there there were no other parties in the restaurant. There was no one else for at least 30 minutes after we got there. This is not a decent excuse. Even if they were short staffed and busy doesn't mean the waiter can't make eye contact and come over and check on us. He avoided our table and never looked over at us to see if we needed anything. Which we did. We needed to order our meals! What waiter says he doesn't want to take our order yet and he will come back and did not come back! We had to get him to come back by calling him over way after he said he would be back.,4,,
31,Matt R.,"New York, NY",242,18,17,5.0,9/13/2018,"Literally the best place I've eaten in NYC. Carlos (our waiter) was the best! I came in with my husband for dinner and had such a great meal. We had the Paloma cocktails... eventually Carlos had us taken some shots... and the food is beyond amazing.

32,Theart P.,"San Rafael, CA",12,275,562,1.0,5/30/2018,"As a whole, this place was quite disappointing. A group of us went here for dinner (5/26/18) and the overall experience was pretty flat for everyone. The service was okay, a little pushy at times and often none existent. The food however was a major disappointment. When we originally called the restaurant to confirm they could accommodate different dietary concerns (especially a vegan diet and gluten-free options), they were reassuring it wouldn't be a problem.After getting there and looking through their menu, we found out that wasn't the case. There were very few vegan options. As a matter of fact, their rice is made with chicken stock so that eliminated 99% of the options right there, something they failed to mention during our initial call. I ended up with a small side of black beans and side sautéed kale. The kale was so over salted that it was inedible. The beans were okay but certainly underwhelming as my only dinner option. Their cocktails were good and so was their guacamole but again, that doesn't/didn't make up for the unbelievably lacking vegan menu options at this restaurant. Everyone at the table, all 7 of us left there dissatisfied.",,,
33,Gopal K.,"Manhattan, NY",17,106,131,3.0,12/1/2017,Went here for brunch. I got the huevos rancheros equivalent from the menu. The dish was presented really well. The eggs were overcooked though and that ruined the taste. The sauces in the dish were average - good but not outstanding. The portion size was pretty small - I had to snack again in less than an hour - but at least it was only $12? Definitely not rushing back here but next time I'm here I'll definitely get a side with the food.,,,

I love the vibe of this spot, and could definitely see this as a great place to have a group of friends for dinner and drinks. We ordered Chips & Guac, Aguachile Ceviche, and the Pulpo y Chorizo Tacos. The guacamole wasn't anything special, and was actually overpriced at $12 for a rather small portion. The Aguachile Ceviche was very light and refreshing and definitely had a good amount of lobster and shrimp. We really enjoyed this and I'd highly recommend if you like seafood and ceviche! The Pulpo y Chorizo tacos which combine octopus and chorizo may sound strange, but they were surprisingly tasty. I would 100% get this again.While this is no authentic Mexican eatery, but yet an upscale Latin fusion type of restaurant, I enjoyed the food and could see myself coming back in the future!",1,1,2
35,Allison B.,"Westwood, NJ",387,220,452,5.0,8/25/2017,"I am in love with Tacuba - my husband and I came here on a Thursday after work, showing up early for an existing reservation. We were seated right away, and the interior drew me in right away. Lots of wood, gorgeous tile, and industrial looking chairs, with a bar situated in the center. The bar highlights all of the tequilas available, which had me in love from the get go. The next aspect that had me loving Tacuba was the service - our server Pilar came right over to take drink orders, and wisely convinced me to order the Pina Para La Nina cocktail (a skinny margarita with pineapple puree) in the double size, which comes inside of a pineapple - the regular drink is $12, it's $20 for the double, and she said most people get two drinks throughout the course of the evening (plus, the Instagram opportunities for the pineapple were gold). It was absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. Seriously, just get the pineapple. I cannot speak more highly about Pilar, as well as the whole staff - was surprised to see any review about rude, impolite service because we raved about the level of service and professionalism of the everyone we encountered at Tacuba. For food, we started with the guacamole, which was the perfect amount for two people (though I probably could have put one down on my own). For dinner, I ordered the avocado fries, because guac obviously isn't enough avocado, and the quesadilla de flor (burrata, zucchini flower, and a kale pesto). My husband ordered the fried Brussels sprouts and short rib quesadilla. We left absolutely nothing on our plates - everything was so delicious, so fresh, and so different from the Tex Mex that we're accustomed to. I wouldn't change a single thing about what was ordered - it was all that good. Also, one of my friends told me that she ordered from here on Seamless and it was also delicious, so keep that in your back pocket if you're in the mood for delicious food, but don't feel like leaving your apartment. This has become one of my new favorite restaurants - we will absolutely be back, and this time, I will not even question getting the double Pina Para La Nina.",5,1,1
36,Luba K.,"Seattle, WA",215,52,38,5.0,2/21/2018,"Buckle your seats for a long review. I visit New York often and am always searching for the new and hottest places to try. Imagine my surprise when we stumbled upon Tacuba and received the best service from the best waitress I've ever had. Her name is Marta. Pro tip: do not forget her name if you plan on coming in. Servers like Marta are nearly impossible to find: she's extremely knowledgeable, hilarious yet charismatic and genuinely passionate about the food served at this restaurant. She makes you feel like family and her energy is contagious. The way she described each item literally made my mouth water. Every. Single. Dish. We started with Margaritas. Let me preface this by saying I am a strict vodka drinker and never stray. Marta said the margaritas were a must, so I listened. Each of us tried the La Refrescante and OMG it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Loaded with tequila you can barely taste, it made for a great evening after 3 rounds! As far as food, the guacamole here is actually life-changing. I have never had guac like this - they make it to order and it was so incredibly creamy and flavorful with the hints of cilantro and jalapeno. I was in heaven already and we hadn't even ordered dinner.Then, Marta suggested the Suadero tacos, which are brisket tacos cooked in beer! They were to die for - rich, tender and full of flavor. Pro tip: add the spicy sauce served with the guac to these tacos for an even better bite! Brussel sprouts are a must-have on the side as well!Needless to say, the evening ended in tequila shots. I had such an incredible experience with Marta that I came back 2 more times! So during a 1 week trip, I ate here THREE times. Don't sleep on this place - it is a GEM and so is Marta.",4,2,2

The tables are very close together, so be prepared to chat with your neighbors.  We used this to our advantage and the locals setting next to us were so nice and gave us great recommendations.  The street tacos I ordered were good.  Not a fan of their house salsa, but they brought out a nice pico de gallo and the guacamole was good.  Overall we liked it, service was excellent and with a yelp reservation we got right in on a busy night.",,,

Updated review",On my last night my friend Janice and I wanted margaritas and tacos and I found this place on yelp. Very good pick!! Excellent managers special margaritas with chips and guac. Then tacos with a side of beans and rice. Asked for an order of flour torts to go with beans and rice but mistakenly thought I wanted my tacos w flour. So you'll see them here with flour. But wasn't trippin. Still good! Plus I got the grasshopper tacos. First time ever. Awesome!! A little salty but GOOD!! Craving more now!! Gonna look for them back home in SF now.,,,

50,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,817,371,3.0,1/3/2018,"This is not Tex Mex. I was dying for tacos and in the area. There were other Mexican restaurants but this had the highest score on Yelp and the most favorable reviews. It's upscale (brisket, octopus tacos). I walked in at 5PM on New Years Day and it was deserted. By 6 pm, it was fairly hopping. Pros: Cute inside Good serviceHigh-quality meat Salsa verde great: but you have to ask for it specially as they bring another weirdo salsa with the regular chips order. Entrees looked phenomenal (but again, in the mid-high 20s) Cons: Expensive for what it is: the tacos are *tiny* and you get three for 13 which don't come with sides (rice and beans) Beans are mediocre and watery: only good when hungry. Salsa is terrible (the one that comes with the chips: creamy weird habanero; more like a dip than salsa). Mediocre, flavorless rice. Utterly unremarkable guacamole: bland and unsatisfying. The drinks looked good. I just wouldn't come here for upscale Mexican; if I were spending money I'd go to Rosa Mexicano or Maya or the place on the UES that everyone loves and I've not been.",2,1,2

I order ""la pina para La Niña"" (aka skinny margarita) and was suckered into ordering it ""for two"" which came in a pineapple- cute for the insta, but you get barely as much liquor as you do in a regular drink for one, so id stay away from that. However the drink itself was actually really good and didn't taste like it was made with margarita mix which is sometimes hard to find around here. The shrimp enchipotlada was really good, the sauce was nice and spicy, but it only comes with 5 shrimp so you might leave a little hungry. Solid spot, but nothing really worth writing home about.",,,

For dinner, I got the chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans, and he got the pork tacos (I forgot what it's called but it had avocados in it) and man those tacos were delicious! The chicken tacos were so flavorful and tasty- it was amazing. Sadly the chips and guacamole can the same time during our meal but our waiter apologized and said it was on the house since they forgot about it.The drinks were amazing!!!! I got the mango margarita and my cousin got the Strawberry margarita and tamarin and they were delicious. Not to sweet and strong enough to get a good kick.

53,Devki P.,"New York, NY",299,72,33,1.0,3/4/2018,Would say this ranks as one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Arrived 2 mins late for my reservation and they had already given away the table even though I had called earlier in the day and they had confirmed that they held tables for 15 minutes. I decided to look past it but the night only slid further down hill from there. We waited at the bar for 30 mins for a table and when the waitress finally did come she weirdly ran away and we couldn't find her for another 10 minutes - don't understand why you would tell someone their table is ready and then play some weird game of hide and seek? We were finally seated at our table and no one checked in on us for 20 minutes and when I was finally able to flag down a waiter he had the audacity to tell me they were really busy and couldn't get to everyone as soon as they sat down.. last time I checked that's how a restaurant works? We finally placed our orders and after 30 minutes another waiter came over and said they had misplaced our order and that we needed to reorder. I asked for a menu to recall what we ordered and the dude straight up disappeared and never came back. I flagged someone down 10 mins later and she confirmed that our order hadn't been lost and would be out shortly. Food wasn't even that great and drinks were cool looking but tasted horrible - all in all avoid this place it's not worth the headache and the horrible review you will undoubtedly write after.,,,

The ""salsa"" was more of spicy dip but was delicious. I had carnitas. It was moist and flavorful. A lot of people at the table ordered tacos. It was three small tacos that left everyone satisfied. Several sides ordered for the table. The brussels sprouts were unbelievable. The plantains were fantastic. Overall I would say this restaurant is outstanding.

55,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,5/18/2018,"Tacuba is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, second only to its fancier sister, Toloache.  Their menus are fairly similar, but Tacuba is more focused on tacos, ceviches, and lighter courses, all at more affordable prices and in a more casual environment.  I had been there several times and even received their lunch delivery at my office, loving their Brisket Tacos, Beer-Brined Grilled Chicken, and more.  For the sake of relevancy, I am going to focus my review mainly on my recent visit.Knowing that the restaurant was often loud and crowded, I requested a more spacious table in order to secure extra comfort for my pregnant friend.  When we arrived, the manager said that our best option was to sit downstairs, where we had more room around our table, and it was easier to hear each other.  We accepted the offer, despite the table being steps away from the kitchen.Though I had initially thought of skipping a cocktail, I was enticed into ordering the Pina Para La Nina.  This version of a Skinny Margarita was made with Jose Cuervo Tradicional and received a tart pop from pineapple puree, agave nectar, and fresh lime.  My companion and I also decided to order a side of medium-spiced guacamole, which was served alongside a basket of flawless tortilla chips and a creamy, roasted tomato salsa.  We then both proceeded to Tacos, and I went with the Fluke variety.  The pan-seared, white fish had been dusted in chilies, topped with a kohlrabi-habanero slaw and chipotle aioli, and then wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  The addition of the slaw was the key to tempering the heat from the seafood spice rub.  Sure, those were great tacos, but their version with braised brisket and horseradish crema had always been mind-blowing.  Their authentic Cricket Tacos had also been a thrill in the past.  While this was not my favorite meal at Tacuba, the spot still holds a place in my heart, along with other Julian Medina restaurants.",5,1,7

Firstly, this spot is really pricey for Mexican cuisine. One guacamole to share, two appetizers to share, one entree and two drinks (one each) was $60 per person.The food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't anything spectacular. I've had better Mexican food in the city for far less (I'm looking at you Sinigual). We asked for spicy guacamole which came out mild at best. My quesadilla was pretty good but it's kind of hard to mess that up. Considering we only had one drink each and only one entree and the food was average at best this seems pretty pricey to warrant another casual visit anytime soon.",,,

I'm at a lack of words because honestly it's almost sad. The guacamole was just salty but other than that has no flavor. We ordered a spicy and a mild and they both tasted the same. They also came in the smallest little bowls, maybe enough for 2 people to share, but not even close to a group of 10. I know of MANY other Mexican restaurants who serve a huge bowl of guacamole for the same price and some even less.Then the food itself, some over salted and some completely bland. Mine was over salted and hard. I got the carnitas tacos and the carnitas was crunchy and hard and just not food. My boyfriend got the shrimp tacos and there was about 3 pieces of shrimp overall. My cousins got a couple different things and they all complained about the cooking of the meat and how little meat was served and how the flavor was totally off.The drinks were ok, the pineapple which seems to be their best seller, was just eh.

I went here with a group of 8 girls for brunch - we had a GREAT time. The food was wonderful, we all got at least one drink, some people got dessert. It was all around a fantastic time! And then it came time to pay.We asked if we could get separate checks and he said no. Which, fair enough. We asked if we could write down credit card numbers and split that way and he said yes. Cool. So we did that. And then find out there was a maximum card policy. Which again, fair enough... you could have told us that before but whatever. So we redid it and give it to the waiter. The waiter then proceeds to run our cards at the register that is NEXT to our table and TALKS ABOUT US in Spanish to another waiter, complaining about how this group of girls just wanted to come in here and split the bill and acted entitled (we did all the work splitting it but OK). Good thing a girl at our table knew Spanish and was translating it all for us. We were livId and then we get the check back and see it's a 20% automatic gratuity (that they definitely do not inform you of and actually try to trick you into doing more). I never tip below 20% unless exceptionally bad service and I would say a waiter actively insulting you in another language that you can also speak is exceptionally bad service. So I was angry I couldn't reflect that in my payment. In the end we decided to not ruin this guys job and complain to his management because we get it sometimes you have a bad day and you don't assume a bunch of girls next to you can also speak Spanish, but my friend did approach him in Spanish and left him pretty stunned which was enough ""revenge"" for us enough. I've been back for a friend's birthday and had great service and this time we knew there was a maximum amount of cards allowed. Still didn't inform us about the automatic gratuity and still tried to trick you into paying an extra 20% tho.

The interior is very large and open feeling, with a beautiful long bar at its center, where I sat. The bartender was very attentive, and I was off to the races with an order of skirt steak tacos and the house margarita. The tacos were delicious! Three tacos (some places try to get by with just two, boo) and a nice portion of beans and rice. Very tasty and filling. For my second drink, I decided to try the Chef's Margarita, which was a great upgrade and would be my first choice going forward. Prices were fair and the food came out very quickly! My only complaint, if there were any, is that the acoustics are a little bad so I can imagine that when this place is at its peak it would be very loud.

Tacos  come in 3 pcs but bite sized with rice and beans - the menu does say ""appetizer size"" but who really reads the fine print when you are already swaying to the Mexican music and sipping margarita that had arrived already. We ordered the brisket tacos and octopus and chorizo and loved them both - juicy and flavorful, a tad bit of oil does come out but the tacos are small enough you don't feel too guilty. The guac is a good size for two people and we also ordered extra chips to finish 'em off. Since I'm on a diet where I try to eat only one person's portion vs two, we skipped the dessert but next time the Mexican churros dusted with cinnamon dipped in chocolate will be ordered.Service: Absolutely top. Our main server in the front dining area was extremely attentive and nice. Ambiance: there is a small dining area when you walk in, that's where we ate but the next time we will be specifically  asking for the tables at the back in the ""mezzanine"" level with group of friends (more light here and you feel more of the nyc boozy brunch vibe) or park ourselves at the bar if it is just us two again.Highly highly highly recommend it.",1,2,1

This may have been because it was the eve of Cinco de Mayo, but still...Overall: 1*Food: 4*Ambiance: 1*Service: 3*VIBE: Dark - I had a rez and had requested a well-lit table, but we were stuck in a dark corner; when I asked if there was a brighter area, I was told ""no, sorry, there are a lot of reservations tonight."" Oy. NOISY - we could not carry on a conversation due to the music and the roar of the crowd.SERVICE: I could not really hear the server most of the time, but she was attentive, and the food came out in a timely fashion.FOOD: To be fair, it was very good. Mole on my enchiladas was among the best I've had - nutty, piquant, cocoa-kissed. My companion declared her fish taocos to be very good, as well. We didn't try anything else - we just wanted to get the hell out of there.If you like noisy, possibly dim, dives, Tacuba Hell's Kitchen may be just your thing. The food seems to be quite good.

First the guac. I looooove guac. Sometimes I like a lot of shit in it, you know tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc. But sometimes I like it to be simple. And there's was simple with a lot of flavor. The salsa was delish and my tacooooos MAN!They were hittin it. I can't exactly remember, but I think I got pork or something. My dude had something else and his was aight, but not bad. The accompanying beans and rice were delish. And my drink was AWESOME sauce. I got a little buzz from it (peep the pineapple). I gotta say for a cramped NY spot this place was great. The service was good. I like that they were nice enough to store our stroller somewhere safe. Even tried to set it up for us when we were ready to leave.

Yes, the tacos were smaller than usual but I still gave it the benefit of a doubt...hoping that the tastes of the filling might help save the dish altogether! So wrong. The taco ingredients were just so mediocre and dry that there was no further justification. The rest of my party of 7 folks also shared the same thoughts. The redeeming factor was the side aka fried brussel sprouts, in which everybody enjoyed and wanted more after each spoonful bite. I personally wish there was some char on the sprouts but definitely not a deal breaker. I had an after-dinner cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised by the thick, dense layer of foam! It was far away from a watered down espresso drink too. Is it weird that I'd only come back for the cappuccino?",2,,

We also shared the Pina para La Niña drink for two in the pineapple which tasted good but was mostly ice. The quesadilla de costilla was really good.

My tacos came with beans and rice. Very tasty and I found plenty of lobster meat on each taco. The meal was a perfect size and I left feeling satisfied.

The food here is excellent, the ambiance great and the service top notch. We came here on a Friday night and easily got a last minute reservation for four. First thing we noticed is how big, bright and airy the space is. The walls and bar are nicely decorated with Mexican knick knacks like painted ceramic skulls, cacti and tequila bottles. Gives a very cool rustic sort of vibe. To drink, we got a pitcher of the La Sandia, and a Pina Para la Nina in a pineapple. The Sandia was refreshing and strong, with watermelon bits in it, The pina was good with a strong pineapple flavor. For the food, we got the grasshopper and the octopus-chorizo tacos. The grasshopper was very well done and the octopus-chorizo was good too. We also got the Japones ceviche, which was delicious! It had a nice peanut-soy sauce-citrus flavor to it, definitely a unique blend of ideas. We also got the duck enchiladas, which were perfect. The duck filling is smoky with a hint of sweetness and the enchilada sauce was light and flavorful, not the tomatoey cheesy mess you typically get in most tex mex places.I later found out that this is a Julian Medina establishment, and being huge fans of Toloache, I'm not surprised we loved the food here so much. A must try for sure!",3,,
123,Shelley L.,"New York, NY",95,449,1169,3.0,8/5/2016,"Oh Tacuba, you are an expensive taco joint. Service, decor, layout, food are all good but damn it's expensive for a tiny taco. We came to dine during the night with the crazy thunderstorm and glad we got a comfortable corner seat.Guacamole - Started off with guacamole which was really good! They give you a side of salsa, which was just OK, but go for the guac of course. The chips were nice and warm...that's the best!Brisket tacos - I highly recommend getting the brisket beef tacos. SO GOOD. Very delicious, the flavor is on point and good chunks of meat. The green sauce really compliments it well. Just sucks that the tacos are so TINY. Chicken tacos - these were OK. Not bad but if I had to choose, I would rather go brisket! The combination of the chicken and salsa on top was good but I can't get over how small they were for that price!Carnitas - these were delightful...if you like pork and you like a bit of crunch with a side of vegetables, this is the dish for you. It comes on a sizzling plate of pork on the bottom, crispy pork skin, guacamole and greens to top it off. You get six hot soft taco shells to build your own meal. Again, tiny taco but the filling was great. Fried avocado - this was just OK. I would pass. All in all, three main dishes with an appetizer, side and drink came out to about $100. Would I do it again? Probably not but it was a good experience.",2,2,

I can't say why it was such a treat but I really liked it.  The carnitas was good too, maybe a little greasy in spots but there was nothing left in the pan when we were finished!This is a nice alternative to El Centro (which I love) and Arriba Arriba (which I like a lot).  I would say the food and vibe here are a little more upscale than those places.",9,2,4

Also has a lovely red sangria.  For food, get the fried brussel sprouts as a side - absolutely incredible, not a traditional brussel dish. I generally do an order or two of tacos: the fish and zucchini have been my favorites. But, I've worked my way through the menu and truly everything is good!

129,Missy S.,"New York, NY",556,222,143,4.0,6/2/2017,"Green sauce here is underrated. It packs a punch that could make any dish a star. If you're looking for two drinks, an app to share, and dinner for two, this is definitely a $$$ experience, not $$, but if you're up for that classy yummy fiesta, you probably won't be disappointed here. We tried the watermelon and cucumber cocktails, both were delish. Shared the quesadilla to start-- we were lured in by the sound of a burata(dilla) (they should rename it that), which was good but not spectacular-- in fact maybe not as good IMO as a classic dilla. I got the bronzino for dinner which was quite tasty and was served filleted with the head still on and had two sauces, one on each half of the fish-- a green sauce and a mole-- served with a few corn tortillas, a cabbage slaw (meh), and the (Magic) green sauce. My friend got the drunken chicken which she really enjoyed. I think for the price that the mains should be served with a side of rice and beans or at least chips and salsa, but that's the old deal seeker in me. Alas... this place is packed, has a cool, fun, upscale but not pretentious environment, and shares bloodlines with Taloache and other pricey Mexican establishments in the city, so they know what they can charge and still fill the seats. All in all the cocktails, food, service, and decor work for any kind of dinner or drinks for a date or small party, so enjoy, break out that magic plastic card, and shrug off the reality of NYC living on your next mini staycation to mejico.

Tacuba comes in with a rustic decor and open atmosphere.Fairly busy on July 4th day, but secured a table for 2 near the window. Had to start the with the Guacamole ($12) - a medium sized bowl filled with creamy avocado goodness served with a plethora of chips. For the meal, ordered the Carnitas ($22) and a sangria ($10). Carnitas comes out as a giant roast pork dish in a bowl, cooked crispy with lots of oil/fat in the bottom. A little greasy yet excellent flavor. You roll it up in the provided tortillas and add a dollop of guac and some sauces, perfect. Sangria is okay, has some odd juice inside that tasted a bit syrupy.Service here is super friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. Prices are higher than I'd like to spend on this type of food, so try to get things you normally don't find in other similar spots. Will try to come back for brunch.",2,,

There are even a few options for vegans like me! The only thing I'll mention is that the tacos are super tiny (and they're soft shell) - like an appetizer.

She offered us ""chips and dip"" and brought out salsa and guacamole, but neglected to tell us the tiny bowl of guacamole cost $12, which we only found out when we got the check. We would certainly not have ordered it had we known.She got our drink orders wrong from the start, and attributed this to her being unable to hear clearly because the restaurant was so loud. Perfectly understandable because it WAS noisy, she switched out our drinks and everything was fine.Then comes the food. She got several orders wrong once again, saying ""but you ordered this plate"" when we clearly hadn't. Again said she couldn't hear us -- wtf?? If you're unsure, repeat the orders back to make sure you heard correctly, especially since this just happened with our drinks. We will obviously assume you understood if you don't clarify. The manager was rude, came over saying ""the dishes you ordered will take at least fifteen min to prepare"" and stared at us as if we were supposed to just eat what they served us. What a joke. Also, our correct orders ended up coming out less than ten min later.In the end, the waitress gave us the bill, complete with the overpriced guacamole AND all of the incorrect drinks and food she had served us that we sent back. 20% gratuity was also included for our party of 5, which sucks because the waitress certainly did not deserve 20%. One star for the tacos, they were decent. But they really need to work on their incompetent staff.",,,

A woman server took over for him for a bit and she was much better. I wanted to just hand her the tip. So overall this is definitely a drinking spot. The drinks were good, the mezcal was excellent.

I get That could be a normal thing to do but I was just really interested in getting their burrito they had during brunch.  Anyway, we end up starting with drinks and my margarita that was supposedly made without syrup, had a ton of marg mix and sweetener in it. Had to send drinks back because it had no alcohol. Was pretty much all marg mix and ice. In terms of food, portions were small and prices were wayyyyy to high for a place like this. I'd rather have gone to rosa Mexicano for these kind of prices. Bill was 250 for 6 people and only 2 of six ordered entrees.  4 of the people ordered apps. Quesadillas were a little cheese on top of one matching sized tortilla. Can fit in palm of your hand. They were trying to charge me for more nachos. As they gave us one tiny bowl for 6 people.

The avocado on top of the quesadilla was brown and inedible. Secondly, the portion size is terrible especially for the quality of food you get.

I swear they maybe put a teaspoon of meat on that thing. The only food item that was good were the plantains. The food here is not worth the price whatsoever.

That being said, our service was so-so. We ordered chips and guacamole. We asked for a chip refill and never received that. Our server came to our area several times to go to the register and he appeared to be looking around to see who needed help but he never looked behind him. So the tables assigned to him that were behind him (including ours) rarely got attention. The food was also only ok. Also, the restroom situation was different. The doors to both the women's and men's restrooms downstairs were left open. There are stalls but that still seemed weird/less private to leave the doors open like that. The biggest issue for me is that I saw a male waiter go into the restroom and since the door is wide open, I was able to hear a urinal flush and that a faucet had not been turned on or a rustle of paper towels to indicate that this worker, who was on the clock, had washed and dried his hands. That is gross, seeing as I'm sure he came in contact with people's food several times during his shift and I'm sure it's not the first time he hasn't washed his hands before returning to work.",1,,

Definitely a cute location, it's not too crowded and the tables are nicely spaced so you have room to breathe. In the warmer months there is a mini open garden in the back as well: it's where we ate lunch and really enjoyed the afternoon!The drinks are delish and customizable (spicy margs, anyone?) but the margaritas are pretty sweet so beware - overall good prices though. As for the food, my favorites are OBVIOUSLY the guacamole, as well as the pork carnita tacos, and I love me some side of rice and beans!The other things we've had there, though, were just eh - the chicken enchiladas (3/6 of us ordered these!) were just okay, not a ton of flavor other than the immense amount of molé on top, and dry inside. They could definitely use some more cheese and salsa verde in my opinion, but none of the 3 of us even ate half - they're big portions but we also just didn't really like them :/ so we drank instead. The tacos are much more flavorful and the way to go, otherwise their menu has some odd items we didn't try. The other things we ordered weren't great either, and with so many Mexican places around this just didn't do it for us.Overall, if we come back it will be for guac and tacos, but realistically you can get those at any Mexican place.

The Suadero tacos (brisket, avocado, horseradish cream, et al) will eliminate your disenchantment the Roaring Twenties as a whole, the Enchiladas De Pato (duck carnitas, hazelnut-fig mole, cheeses, et al) will restore your faith in the Lost Generation, and the guacamole will blur life at its edges. From the Dia de Los Muertos themed logo paired with a custom logotype on the facade to the simple aesthetic of the menu, carefully considered design carries through the restaurant. Tacuba's interior is open and spacious with cozy date-night spots as well as long tables for larger gatherings. Gems like Tacuba are to be shared. *I hold myself personally culpable for referencing a Hemingway work that has a circumbendibus correlation to the cuisine on which the restaurant is based. However, Tacuba evoked in me a sense of expatriate wonder/lust/wanderlust via its convivial milieu, flavescent tones, and borderline holy menu, and left me with no choice but to draw a literary conclusion to/from a glorious novel to a glorious restaurant.",4,5,8

188,Rhea Z.,"Staten Island, NY",107,215,242,4.0,11/16/2017,"Went here for date night. We were seated about 10 mins after we showed up for our reservations. Hostess was very nice. Tables in the back were pretty close to each other, but it was a Saturday night. Enough elbow room since no one was seated to our left which was good. Reggaeton was playing in the background. Our waiter was an older gentlemen who wore a headband (im assuming to keep the hair out of his face) who was very nice and attentive. I ordered the Carne Asada and my boyfriend ordered Carnitas. We also had the guac and chips. I got the Trip Tequila which is like a sample of 3 different tequilas. It was very good. You  must taste it in order to get the different taste of each one which I must say I enjoyed very much. Food was delicious. My steak was perfect. I wish they gave me more of the avocado salad which was amaze balls. The lime in that salad was omg! Dessert was perfect. Not too much or too little. Churros with the dark chocolate sauce was delish. Very glad I tried dinner here. You will impressed.",2,,1
189,Robert T.,"Miami, FL",1,27,30,2.0,9/18/2016,"This place is truly a joke. $13 tacos which contain a total of 1oz of meat. Quesadilla $13 can fit on 4 toothpicks. The food just ok but the portions are an insult. I would call this haute Mexican. Will not return here for food. Bill was around $70 for two, left hungry.....Good luck to the owners of this place!Living in NYC for 25 years tells me the place will not be around for too long.",4,3,
190,Emily L.,"Manhattan, NY",151,13,0,4.0,2/19/2018,"I had heard good things about Tacuba and it lived up to my expectations. Made a reservation for 6 on Saturday (note, I made it through Yelp two days before). Food:--We split two orders of guacamole. We ordered it medium, but it came to our table very mild. They brought jalapenos and hot sauce on the side so we could adjust--They also gave us salsa that was VERY tasty (I almost liked it more then the guac)--For main courses, I split three tacos--the fish tacos, suadero (brisket) and carne asada with friends. They were all VERY tasty although we all agreed we liked the suadero the best.  We also ordered rice and beans on the side which was quite good. My other friends got Carne Asada (the main dish), short ribs (which I believe was a special) and a chicken dish. They were all quite pleased--For dessert we had churros, we enjoyed but didn't love. We got (multiple) pitchers of margaritas to drink and not only were they delicious, they were a very good deal. If you have more than 3 people, it's worth it (especially if you want more than one margarita). .Lastly, the service was excellent. We never felt rushed or hungry, very well taken care of. We ordered another pitcher at the end (and probably didn't need it) and they were more than accomodating. At one point the server brought us an extra order of fish tacos on the house. Overall great meal, fun night! I will be back!",,,
191,Fran B.,"Los Angeles, CA",897,657,120,4.0,9/9/2016,"SUCH a cute little place! Well, it's actually not that little, but it is nice and cute. Came here for lunch just randomly, since we stumbled upon this place while walking around hungry and in search of booze. I myself was NOT hungry, because we had just come from biking around Central Park, which in most people's case is a nice little exercise, but in me and my group's case..... the longest, beautifulest, most tiring bike ride ever. We were not 100% sober either, so it was just .. so difficult to pedal. Bhahah we were all fine and capable, but seriously.... it was so hard biking up hill. After we finished, I pretty much just lost all my appetite and wanted to die/throw up/pass out, but we ended up here.So someone force fed me a glass of sangria, which was yummy btw. I didn't try the red one, but the white sangria was good! I ordered some brisket tacos, the suadero (the guy made me say it lol), even though I still had no appetite nor a desire to eat/live. But once the food came, I sloooowly got my appetite back, mainly through just eye sight and smells lol.But after that first bite, I had to admit, it was a very VERY tasty taco. Then I stopped feeling like shit altogether, and devoured my 3 little brisket tacos. The brisket was gOOOOOD, and the tortillas were excellent! Tasted super fresh and chewy, just the perfect texture. My friend gave me a piece of her octopus taco (I just ate the octopus), and it was PERFECT! Some of the best octopus I've had actually. Super tender, flavorful, not at ALL rubbery. Nobody likes a rubbery octopus!The servers were all very sweet, and the place is very nice. I guess I should get used to it, but.. coming from LA it was crazy to see that 3 little tacos = $13. I mean, depending on where you go, I can probably get 3 tacos for $3 LOL. BUT.... that is LA. This is New York. And not to mention it ISSSS a nicer place... so ok. I accept it. Good tacos. Good food. Good sangrias too.",3,2,3

I was so lucky to have been surprised by my friends here for my birthday, and we all had such a great time! The staff were so accommodating, so I'd like to say an extra thanks to them! :) GET THE AVOCADO FRIES!!!!Mojitos were delicious! Can't go wrong with any of the tacos. Prices are a little steep, but I guess what can you expect from Mexican food in NY. I will be back!!",4,2,2
199,Matt T.,"New Rochelle, NY",11,74,0,4.0,3/28/2017,"Really enjoyed Tacuba. Stopped in for lunch and had the lunch special with the soup and a torta. It was delicious. The price was ok at $16, but you can get a burrito or torta on its own for $12. That's in comparison to some other stupid Mexican place nearby that will go without being named that charges $22 for a veggie burrito. The service was great and everyone was very helpful. My one grievance (and it's a big one for me) is that they charge $5 for a coke and then charge for refills. Drives me friggin crazy. Good spot other that though and I will return.",3,2,1
