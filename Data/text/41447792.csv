My friend and I ordered the Power BLT. It had 2 eggs, avocado, tomatoes, and pesto. There wasn't much avocado but this was still a very filling meal that will last me to early/mid afternoon. Service was quick as I came in around 10:00am. I'm assuming that it may be a bit busier around early morning. The restaurant is quite big so you will find ample seating. There is 2 power outlets at the back if you are looking to charge your phone (turn left when you enter).They have a lunch menu as well with sandwiches and salads. If I visit NYC again and I'm in this area, I'll be back :)****This is my 131st Yelp review overall. 85 reviews for 2018.I am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018.Reviewed on 19 October 2018.",1,,2
1,Wulandari D.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,27,15,1.0,8/21/2018,"If I could sue this one, I would!I got food poisoning from this restaurant. Ate there ln Thursday night. Hospitalized on Friday. And been throwing up and diarrhea for the whole weekend. I just felt better today (Tuesday). Long story short. I made a pick up order through their website around 5PM. My husband picked it up at 6PM. We ate at my Chirropractor's waiting room right away (just accross the street from this Fresh & Co), I realized the fried chicken & honey dijon mustard dressing that I ordered are not there. Fine. I'll eat what I can. (My husband ordered chicken caesar salad, I ordered custom salad ; kale, spring mix, onion, corn, mushroom, tomato, fried chicken with honey dijon and avocado dressing. Plus rice pudding).At around 7.30 my tummy feels funny. After I finished the chirropractic session at 8PM, I came back to the restaurant. I told them the orders I paid for was not there. The cashier was apolegetic, asking if I want anything on the house. I said maybe just little bit extra corn. I got my salad back. But, she gave me steamed or grilled chicken (it wasnt the chicken I ordered), but I didnt complain. It's not a big deal, it's chicken anyway.At around 8.30, my tummy is getting worst. I had abdominal pain and cramp, extremely bloated, nausea. I felt so weak and weird. I got home at around 9.30, I couldn't sleep and when I slept, I had to push my tummy. At 6AM the next day, I went to E.R, they said I had stomach flu. I stayed in E.R for 5 hours. With the clumsiness of the staffs, I'm not surprised if I got sick. They probably forgot to wash their hands, wear gloves, or doing proper food prep.",,,
2,Olivia M.,"New York, NY",28,100,320,5.0,8/13/2018,"So good!!!I made my own salad and was really impressed with their selection of veggies. Everything looked deeeelicious and super fresh. I custom made my salad with arugula and kale as the base, arugula, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, pico, shaved Brussels, corn and topped is with lemon and lime juice (fresh squeezed) and sriracha. Mixed allll up in their bowl. And topped with a really nice size piece of salmon! I'd say at least double the size of minigrow and maybe 2 oz more than sweetgreen. Super fresh and tasty!They offer a nice sourdough hunk of bread as a side. Coffee was delicious here too. Will definitely be back for more!",1,1,1

4,Isabelle F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,2.0,10/24/2018,"The food is wonderful, but the price isn't. Fresh & Co is 98% the same as Café Metro, which it used to be. As Fresh & Co the price is much higher even though it's the EXACT ingredients as Café Metro. Turns out they are affiliated. Same fresh ingredients and recipes, but definitely not the same prices. I won't be going back again.",,,
5,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,637,2.0,1/30/2018,"I usually don't get salads. I'm more of a burrito, pizza, and all the other unhealthy lunch foods you can think of kind of girl. But sometimes maybe during a blue moon I want a salad. I'm never happy after my salad but these cravings happen. Fresh&Co happened to be near me during these blue moons. I'm not the biggest way that this place is set up. It kind of reminds me of an airport cafeterias. There's multiple lines for different foods you might want and all the lines move extremely slow. It's like everyone here doesn't know what they want. I usually go with their preselected salads. My friend decided to make her own salad. I don't know why people pay $15 for a salad. It's crazy! But I guess I'm one of those people. The salad is solid but to be honest how do you mess up a salad?? I like all the variety that Fresh&Co has to offer but I just don't see myself craving a salad to come here... Especially because there so many other salad options that are better and cheaper. They also have a check in offer for a free water bottle but you can only by their brand water which is never in stock making this check in offer useless.",4,,1

Each time is worse than the time before.There's something that makes you feel especially dead inside when you stand in a line of people staring and scrolling on their phones as they don't look up and motion to the board for their grain bowls. Everyone who works here seems totally miserable and like they are just going through the motions of being a human being. It all happens at a pace that would make a pit crew proud. You will leave Fresh&Co hungry and deeply sad about the state of humanity.",2,4,

I was really hungry and saw an advertisement for a sandwich and didn't feel like walking around so I came in. Service was actually good, despite others having a different experience. I ordered a seasonal Mango chicken fresca panini which tasted fresh and had a unique combination of ingredients that actually mixed well. I enjoyed my sandwich and didn't mind paying the $10-$12 it cost. Overall good experience can't complain about my visit here.",,,

This place is always absolutely spotless, and food truly is so fresh and delicious. The manager should be very proud of his staff, because he truly has the most friendly and polite staff I've ever interacted with.  Today is my birthday, which was casually mentioned to one, and by the time I got to the register my lunch was comped. Thanks for making my day feel special.",,,
13,Helen Y.,"New York, NY",334,838,3671,4.0,8/17/2017,"As if preparing for the arrival of a ravenous army, this location has a huge area in the middle of the store to easily accommodate it. As with other Fresh&Co locations, this one serves up fresh, tasty salads and bowls in pre-made  or custom made combos, sandwiches and even breakfast parfaits. The food is fresh and supposedly sourced locally, though I had an edamame, tofu and shitake salad and I am not sure how local those ingredients are. The space is airy, with several communal tables of pale wood by the entrance. It's a pleasant place to eat at off-peak hours. Staff here is friendly but clueless. No one seemed to know what the specials were except for the manager. Who promptly removed the sign outside that listed specials they weren't offering. More staff training might be in order. A good place for a healthy meal, with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. Protein and add ins are an extra price. Just note that if you have a hearty appetite, a $9 salad without the addition of any proteins like chicken or tofu will most likely result in a desire to finish off your meal with a dash to a nearby pizzeria.",12,5,10

The order wasn't put together well. Dressing was mixed up. Instead of a pellegrino I received a Poland spring. The funniest was the tomato sushi. I was curious so I spent the $5 to order it. I love tomatoes, I love sushi, what could go wrong? Pieces of peeled tomato, looking gross.",2,1,1

I would try elsewhere and personally, I am not sure if I will be returning in the future.The food was mostly quinoa based but I opted to get a turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato (pre-made) sandwich. The fresh food did not really appeal to me because they did not really look ""fresh."" The fountain drinks were very bitter and I had to pour at least 5 packets of sugar in the cup. The staff member at the register was not friendly and maybe we caught her attitude at the wrong time, but it might have been because it was Easter Sunday and she did not want to be at work.The sandwich was just okay; I think I could find a better sandwich elsewhere (even CVS pre-made sandwiches tasted and looked better/fresher)!",2,,

I really have never liked it, but it's literally a couple doors down from my office so sometimes it's just the most convenient place when I'm short on time. I went in this AM for an iced coffee (one of the hottest days of the damn year)...Pay for it (almost $4), get the cup and when I went to make it...noticed I was basically pouring hot coffee into my cup from the iced coffee machine.  I HATE IT SO MUCH WHEN THIS HAPPENS! I could have made my own iced coffee at the office if I wanted it this way. Melts all the ice and results in a watered down glass of $hit!  Fresh & Co should really know better! If they ran out...just say you're out and don't replenish until the coffee is cold. I would expect this from my $2 coffee from a cart on the side of the street but this seriously pissed me off!Also, I got a salad here a few months ago and some of the toppings were rotten! Meh!!

21,Nataly T.,"New York, NY",215,7,0,1.0,6/7/2018,"Let's start with the customer service I received at the salad bar, the guy making my salad was rude and dismissive, he seemed to be annoyed at any question I asked him, very unprofessional. I let that go, perhaps he's having a bad day. Next, the girl mixing up the salad in a very dry and unfriendly tone asks me what dressing I wanted. Fine, a this point I just want to pay and go. When I got to the register to pay, I asked why my salad was a different amount than what I'm use to paying at the 10th Avenue location, the girl at the register got such a nasty attitude with me. As if I was disturbing her, my apologies for asking questions about the money I'm spending. I'm usually lenient when it comes to customer service considering I use to work retail when I was young, but these are $15-$25 salads I'm paying for here, can I at the very least get a smile and less attitude. As she finished explaining, I smiled and told her I didn't want the salad anymore and walked out. I will not be coming back to this location.",,,

If you think they're high prices, it's possible that you're not in this environment regularly. For what they offer, $7.50 juice, $7.50 quinoa huevos rancheros( amazing!) , $5.95 collard greens vegan tuna wrap ( amazing!), $4 breakfast Sandos- you can't go wrong especially if you're staying nearby.",1,,
24,Andrea L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,40,0,2.0,7/6/2017,"Many people I work with like this place for lunch, which is why I've given it a second and then a third chance. I have struck out each time, I'm sad to say.*The first lunch was the grain bowl. The man making it squirted so much chipotle sauce that it came out more like a soup. I've been turned off by chipotle since...it was like that. * My second lunch was a container of tuna salad, with the lemon on top. I found a thick piece of twine in it. * Recently went back for my third try. I tried a salad this time...can't screw that up, right? Wrong. I asked for chicken but got no chicken. I'm not sure if I paid for chicken or not. I feel like the man making the salad was not even listening to me. It's weird how you have to wait on a separate line to get dressing on your salad and how other people cut in front of you. The whole salad assembly line is awkward IMO and uncomfortable. The people who work the registers aren't exactly on top of things either. One morning I went in for coffee and ordered an iced latte. The woman directed me to the iced coffee machine. No, I explained, it's made with espresso. She asked me how to make it. Really? Do I work here now? I would not recommend this F&C for lunch options. For salads or other healthy options there's many other choices in the area. They do make a nice oatmeal for breakfast though, hence the extra star. Just don't plan on getting the coffee, it's terrible.",,,

South Beach Salad^ grilled chicken, craisins, walnuts, fresh apple, crumbled blue cheese, local mesclun & romaine. 3.

I believe the store manager was present and was the one taking care of my order.The SECOND time I went - which was yesterday; the service was subpar. The person in front of me ordered an avocado toast and lady behind the counter looked annoyed. It seemed like she didn't want anyone to order this item. I also ordered an avocado toast and the same lady behind the counter said something in Spanish to her co-worker, behind the counter and rolled her eyes. She then looked at me and said with attitude ""well I'm gonna give it to you with the whole wheat bread because we are out of the other bread"". Ummm.....OK? Her tone was basically like 'well this is what you're gonna get, so too bad'. Literally. I said, ""yeah that's fine"". It wasn't a big deal but her attitude definitely was. So here's a piece of advice to that lady: hey there! maybe management didn't provide you with the best training on proper customer service skills or maybe they did and you still choose to give attitude. However, NEXT TIME, maybe you should say ""hey we ran out of the bread we usually serve the toast on. Do you mind if we serve it on wheat bread (or whatever bread you have)?"". Simple...right?

I honestly didn't know what to expect from this dish, but it turned out to be very good and tasted extremely healthy. The portion size is also filling.

There's a lot to choose and well, the eggs and turkey bacon sandwich I was got was tasteless but I guess that's what ""healthy"" is these days. I don't have much to complain about the food.My complaints though are the lines. It was like herding cats. I don't know where the line starts/begins, people are waiting, scattered near the cashiers. If you're ordering a sandwich, go the station where they'll hand you a slip of paper which you take to the cashier. I didn't see anyone else doing this so I didn't know the convention. Once I was checking out, the cashier didn't ask me for a receipt which I had to go back and ask for. Ugh... slight pain to wait while customers behind me are trying to pay.

The variety of options here is what initially attracted me - I never get bored here. Even if I just get salads for the week, they offer a ton of different proteins, so I'm in no danger of getting sick of chicken/chicken/chicken/tuna (sorry coworkers) /chicken/chicken...etc. I've gotten their turkey, tofu (smoked, so it's actually better than the tofu at a lot of salad bars), tuna, falafel, and, yes, chicken.  And as the name suggests, the ingredients do indeed taste pretty fresh. Also - the pace could not be better. Considering the volume of hungry corporate bodies that come in here between 12-3, this place is damn efficient. I do have to say that as far as the salad bar is concerned, I think that topping quantity is inversely proportional to speed. These custom-made salads are expensive, and I want my money's worth. I'd honestly prefer a slower pace if it meant getting an adequate amount of each topping, but that's not exactly not the New York way - especially in midtown. I just I really like food and stinginess is not cool. So when the line for the salad bar is shorter, more often than not I get more bang for my buck. The few times I've mentioned perceived stinginess (in less loaded terms, of course), the response has been a bit hostile, but oh well.

Once there, we ordered a Burrito Bowl and some other kind of bowl that is slipping my memory. The bowls themselves were created in a few minutes each, and they were still steaming when handed over to us to walk across the store to the cashier to finish our healthy-ish transaction.

Updated review","Alfer a long abstinence, I decided to try Fresh again. It seemed to have changed-upped its staff, and made improvements over their service. After a few different visits during the course of this year, I find their food choices delicious and updated often, the customer service & staff keeps the busy lunch crowd moving, and there is a much more professional, and friendly customer experience.",,,

If every fresh&co location is like this one, I'm a customer for life. I often come here after a long day, brain is so fried I can't make a decision and the staff makes suggestions (haven't steered me wrong) and always say something kind that turns my mood around! I'm a fan of the quinoa bowls - good enough for two meals AND good ingredients. Please open a location near 50th and 3rd....on second thought, don't. Or I'll never bring lunch again :)",,,

54,Chip R.,"Morrisville, NC",510,469,1035,4.0,5/29/2013,"So on my recent trip to NYC, I wanted something quick but substantial for breakfast...and don't forget reasonably priced. I started walking around and stumbled upon Fresh & Co. on 7th Ave and glad I did.The place is pretty new, and is nicely kept. I mean they keep it clean. They were even mopping mid day just to keep it up, not because of a spill (check out my pic). A plus. Next, there are a great variety of food choices for breakfast, lunch, etc. to choose from. For breakfast I noticed egg plates, build your own omelets ($5.95, not bad at all), bagels, fresh made danish, hot cereal bar, fruit choices, etc. Lunch included hearty sandwiches, paninis, custom chopped salads, baguettes, soups, etc. And they even deliver as I found a delivery menu to take as well. The omelet I built was wonderful (you get a meat item, cheese, and veg item to add), and with some Greek yogurt to accompany it made a great breakfast. I was so taken by the cleanliness of the place, the fast service, and the tasty eats that I did breakfast here each day of my NYC visit. And will probably visit them again if in the area.Bottom line: Great breakfast and lunch offerings in a clean, nice environment. Good variety of choices and acceptable prices considering. Quick, easy, and tasty.",1,,

I decided to try one of their quinoa bowls, the bangkok bowl but without cilantro and subbing pickled ginger. They were training a new hire so it was a bit slow getting my bowl done but they were pretty nice so I let it go even though I was on a tight time crunch. The bowl itself is like average stir fry on top of some quinoa. The liquid from the stir fry does soak into the quinoa so it doesn't stay as chewy. I honestly though these bowls would be served cold but it's an interesting take. I would probably order it again.",,,

A little on the pricier side for a salad, but it is Midtown.I got a grainless blondie for dessert as well which I have to say was actually really good.

Hastily making us pay before we got the sandwiches thrown in our face. The price was ridiculous - $12 for two breakfast sandwiches and here's the best part - it didn't even have cheese! Yes.

Just like most cafes in the city, there were ready made sandwiches, baked goods and soups. But in addition, Fresh &Co. offered separate stations for made to order salads and quinoa bowls. Since Levelup was offering $10 credit, I decided to go with their smoked tofu edameme quinoa bowl ($10.07 with tax included). When my order was fully prepared + packed to go,  I learned that this Fresh&Co wasn't fully set up and equipped to accept my payment through the phone. Instead of taking back the food or asking for another form of payment, the manager offered to let me have it for free and apologized for the trouble (maybe he just felt bad to see a small Asian girl ordering 1 quinoa bowl to go on Valentine's Day). Whatever the reason was - major kudos to their customer service! Loved my quinoa bowl - fresh ingredients, perfect mixture of texture + taste (i'm obsessed with edameme and loved that they didn't go crazy with the amount of sauces), very generous portion too (had enough leftover for lunch the next day). Felt extremely satisfied and I can see myself eating this every day! Definitely will be back to try their other quinoa bowl with my still pending Levelup credit!",3,,1

The quinoa seems like it wasn't cooked right, way too much moisture and the kale was rubbery probably cause of their quick blanching process. the dressing was mustardy tasting. Other than that it was kinda bland. I dont think it was tossed properly cause the ingredient weren't mixed well. It just didn't taste right. I'd probably give it a second chance but usally when I get a quinoa salad I go to Cafe Blossom, more expensive but leaps and bounds better.UPDATE: Threw half of it out. Had to call out sick the remainder of the day. Probably won't return. My suspicion something with the kale and how dry kale was being dipped in the same hot water bath, of course the quinoa was water logged. I dunno but I'm taking a half day cause of it.",10,,

And anyways I specifically told whoever took my order I was going to pay cash, no excuses! Okay so for my gaucho salad, it was ooookkaayyy, nothing special, and to be honest, didn't taste like it had any dressing at all, and their grilled chicken was completely dry and tasteless.

Guess they forgot to leave that out. Every single time I give this place a chance, I walk away dissatisfied. Usually, I come here for a salad at lunchtime that ranges from $11 - $15 dollars. First off, it's never fully chopped whenever I request it to be so, they do not carry Italian dressing (HOW the world do you not have Italian), and I always want to add way too many ingredients in my salad resulting in cataclysmic monetary losses. Yet, I still order a salad here because I'm drawn by some divine intervention to come to Fresh & Co. Yeahhhhh.... Fresh & Co. SURE I'll go for a healthy LUNCH!!!!Recently, I decided to venture away from a salad and try one of their specialty signature sandwiches, the crispy chicken and mozzarella. Luscious, carby, soft bread and protein stocked bits of fried crispy chicken. And after a long work out session at the gym, I couldn't possibly deny. My desire for fried, healthy goodness had betrayed me yet again. The sandwich looked very appetizing but once I sunk my teeth in, all I tasted was disappointment. It was overly hot and there was hardly any melted mozzarella on the bread. The chicken strips were over fried and but still a bit tender on the edges. I had to get hot sauce and ketchup to resuscitate this poor excuse for a sandwich. Hot sauce fixes all, enough said. I guess I should have just gotten pizza after the gym instead. With my eighth or ninth lesson dealing with Fresh and Co, I will probably have the common sense to NEVER ever come here again (hopefully). Sometimes, it takes time to learn.",9,,

It's located right outside of Penn Station, so I can see it being a very busy, frustrating place to go to during peak food hours. Luckily, I went at like 3pm on a Thursday so the lunch rush was gone and the dinner rush hadn't started yet. They do these chopped salads where you pick your ingredients, meats, and dressing - then they take it all and chop it up together into really tiny pieces. Usually when I go to a salad bar like that they just toss everything together, but this gets chopped and mixed so well - the flavors really have a chance to all merge and become one. It was fantastic. This is also a great spot for vegetarians and vegans. They have ""beyond meat"" chicken which is fake meat, made to look like real chicken. I think they also have real meat, so I would ask to make sure. I'm not 100% positive it's a meat free establishment. There's not a lot of seating, so it's a better place to grab and go instead of sitting down. I did get a seat and sat and people watched.

When you buy a salad that is upwards of $10, it's pretty frustrating to get back to your desk and realize you've got about 2/3 of a salad bowl.

They first sauté Napa cabbage and daikon. Yes, I said sauté. They prepare it right infront of you. Definitely beats a tired cold salad any day! Next they add carrots and a really nicely marinated ground turkey. I usually have my bowl sautéed with olive oil. Using just water it can come out a little watery. A sweet and sour sauce they top your bowl with adds another depth to it. If you are brave, get your sriracha on. Lastly, your amazing food is placed ontop of warm, fluffy quinoa.

Updated review","This place gets worse and worse. For some reason management feels they need to have 50 people working at all times. Yet despite the deluge of employees, none of them have the common sense/are trained to handle the most basic of restaurant tasks. Most just stand around so you end up staring at them for two minutes while waiting to order. There can be 10 people in line waiting for one cashier and none of the 25 zombie employees on the floor ever approach the four open registers, nor does management direct them to. It's like the perfect storm of incompetence and mismanagement every.single.day. Oh and then they screw up your order 3-4x, you complain on Twitter, they promise to make it right over email, and then they stop responding to you",,,

Variety was great since you could grab sandwiches, salads and small items from a cold case or get a hot item made fresh from the staff. I ended up getting an awesome turkey sandwich and some snacks to go and it did the trick.The next morning I had breakfast. It was nice that they were open on Thanksgiving Day to serve me since I was that asshole that goes out to eat on Thanksgiving morning.

I used to be a die-hard fan for Chop'T until I found a blonde hair in my salad- no bueno. ANYWAYS, moving on, I usually get the kale with chicken and I add on a buncha veggies. Their dressing options are by FAR more tasty than any other fast-food type salad chain (ie. europa, chop't etc). The dressings are ""trendy""-- spicy tex-mex (my fav), avocado chimmichurri (another fav), roasted garlic vinegarette and the list goes on. To top if off, the dressings that I prefer are on their low-fat menu which is GRRRRRRRRRRREAT.I also like that when dressing the salad they ask if you want a small, medium or large amount.

133,Sharon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,733,856,4.0,11/16/2013,"Fresh & Co is bright, clean and spacious, with ample seating and friendly helpful staff. A big plus is the two individual unisex restrooms.My friend and I had boxed ""grab-&-go"" vegan sandwiches. My smoked tofu, arugula, black bean & corn on multigrain was tasty and just right with a cup of lightly sweet tomato-based veggie soup for a simple meal before a concert at MSG. My friend's ""Beyond Meat"" chicken, arugula & spicy Sriracha mayo on multigrain was fresh and healthful, but missed the mark on taste--not at all spicy and pretty much lacking in flavor in general. Beyond Meat is a relatively new product, and it was great to find it here and check it out. Though it does have a very mild flavor the texture is satisfying, like tender white chicken breast.Of course Fresh & Co is a bit pricey but, being vegan, and choosing organic and locally-sourced whenever possible, I'm used to paying more for food I'm willing to eat. And if you eat animals and care that they're humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed and antibiotic-free, then you'll appreciate Fresh & Co too.",1,,1

I asked him if the Mexican salad (I forget the exact name) was any good, and he brushed me off saying, ""Oh ma'am, they're all the same! All very good!"" I then told him I wanted that pre-designed vegetable bowl salad (again, don't remember the name but know that it contained swiss chards and a whole array of leafy greens). The dude went on to make the Mexican salad, even though I requested a different one. Needless to say, he was very absentminded. The store didn't have pumpkin squash; fine, whatever, I'll take the salad... Another attendee added the dressing and asked me if I wanted ""Medium or Heavy?"" Now, I'm basing my experience off of Sweetgreen in Philly, but his interpretation of medium was a generous, cholesterol-slathering of dressing designed to throw me into an immediate heart attack. Gross. I paid for my salad and ate it on the train, completely unimpressed. Moreover, I hate this pretentious ""go green"" and ""eat local"" movement by restaurants who are not faithful to this motto. Most of their vegetables contained no labeling as to where they are from (How would you otherwise know it's local)! And their containers were not biodegradable, and their forks and spoons were not the vegetable-based ones I see in ""true green"" stores. Bottom line: Fresh & Co is trying to cash in on the ""eat local"" and ""go green"" motto with no true commitment. Look at its cutleries and packaging; plain plastics you see in other restaurants.

Updated review","After monitoring this location and giving it many chances, my dissatisfaction intensifies over the past year.  They really lack an understanding of what it takes to deliver good quality food. There is an overall lack of culinary knowledge at all levels of their McDonald's-like operation. First case and point ... behind the glass they have a nice variety of sandwiches enticing you with the nice fresh arugula and other greens. As soon as you order one they automatically throw it in the convection oven and you're left with soggy greens, which is a buzz kill to any sandwich. I though about asking them to take off the arugula before heating, but it really is not that kind of environment for that personalized attention to detail. Besides, this is not something I should have to ask for if they cared anything about quality. Secondly, I order a ""Kale Yeah"" sandwich and the amount of kale has decreased over the years and today there was ZERO kale when I unwrapped my sandwich at me desk. Third point, I noticed them getting creative and with offering a variety of trendy drinks, including a tea with chia seeds. They offered me a taste and as they hand me the sample the woman says that it is ""chai tea"". Chi and chia are so completely different and they need to do more to educate their staff, especially not in front of the customers. I remember seeing one manager step in like a tyrant to correct a belittled employee on how to wrap a sandwich and it made more of a scene than was needed.  That manager has bigger problems to fix in my opinion.",2,,

Most of the restaurants were very commercial eateries like TGIFridays, Starbucks, McDonalds, BK, etc. When we saw this spot, we were immediately sold.I love how they had vegan options for every category--soup, paninis, and pastas. It's also spacious, clean, and easy to navigate. I was so impressed by the options inside that I got a little overwhelmed. Luckily, much to my delight, the worker offered me a sample of the soup I was pondering (butternut squash). It was delicious, but it helped me decide that I was more in the mood for the vegan falafel patty panini. Wow, was it a good choice! The sandwich in general was tasty, but the bread they use for their paninis is really special. It's multigrain, and it thus has quite a nutty taste. The flax seeds add great flavor.Portion sizes are perfect. I didn't try any drinks, but they had coffees and teas available. You can also get packaged chips and sodas .

Again, the name of the restaurant is Fresh & Co. She was very nice but not even close to understanding how to manage a restaurant. Also, the employees appear to be given WAY to much freedom. They are all too busy talking to each other to be bothered by you so be careful, you will get a dirty look when you ask for help. I stopped going here a year ago but missed the cous cous soup so I went in today. The soup was fresh today but I also got the steak and fontina sandwich which was heated up and wrapped and placed on a counter for a few minutes while the ding dongs talked about some girl until I had to ask for it. Took 3 tries cause they kept grabbing the wrong sandwich. Sorry guy for interrupting your conversation. UPDATE: I wrote this review yesterday. Last night I had awful food poisoning. Up all night.
