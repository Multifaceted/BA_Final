0,Donna P.,"Red Bank, NJ",754,563,3199,5.0,4/26/2018,"Horizons is closer to Port Authority than to Times Square.  A two stage playhouse.  Off Broadway theater that supports American writers. Main stage has 198 seats and Peter J Sharp theater has 128 seats.  The place is wheel chair assessable and has an elevator.  Get there early if you need the elevator as there is just one and could take a bit to get a ride.  The facility is always clean. The staff is friendly and welcoming.  I really enjoy attending their performances.  I've seen two plays here, Indian Summer and Flat Earth.  Both excellent. I use to only go to Broadway to see plays but a friend started taking me to off broadway and I'm loving it.",8,2,5
1,Deanna F.,"Levittown, PA",51,57,49,5.0,7/3/2017,My daughter wanted to take me to a play for my birthday so I chose Bella. I was a little apprehensive about it since I'd never heard of it. We were fortunate to get five tickets the day before. Although we were told we wouldn't be seated together that wasn't the case when we arrived. The theater offers a very intimate setting without a bad seat in the house. We were second row from the stage!  The sets were comfortable enough that I didn't feel cramped. The play was a delightfully funny musical. It featured an eclectic mix of characters. A tale of a young women and her trials and tribulations learning to use her (ass)ets to maneuver thru life. Despite never having heard of he play we were all very happy with the choice. I will have to keep an eye out for more plays at this venue. They offfer quality shows at reasonable prices!!!,,,
2,Marissa M.,"South Hempstead, NY",627,521,1428,5.0,3/2/2016,"I attended Danai Gurira ' s (Michonne from The Walking Dead) ""Familiar"" last night and this theatre really exceeded my expectations.  Friendly competent staff, comfortable seating, modern design and features (the IG/FB Photo booth). I wish the theatres On Broadway were like this off Broadway theatre. I love the arts and attended acting classes in college.  I love that PH provides this kind of platform for new writing. This theatre is very cozy yet very spacious. The design was impeccable! The way the set designer created the house was remarkable.  Even down to the snow outside the windows was cleverly done and realistic.  The actors in this production were amazingly skilled. Seating was easy to find with the labeled carpet letters. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. If you need a bite before the show there are several restaurants on 9th Ave and 8th. Do your Yelp Homework 1st!",3,2,4
3,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,4.0,6/9/2016,"I accidentally came into this theater looking for the nondescript one next door, the first time. I was a little disappointed I was in the wrong place. Playwrights Horizons is exactly what I expect a modern theater to look like. I didn't take pictures of the lobby, silly me, but it's quite nice. The second floor is a half floor so you're basically in a cathedral of a theater. There's concessions center rear and seating along the left. The restrooms are downstairs and just how I like them. Like the ones in the airport where you don't have to touch a door on your way out. There's a freight sized elevator so it's ADA accessible. I was seated in Row E Seat 5. From the seating chart you can see that I will be extremely biased about the leg room. God bless Row E! I didn't even need to get up for the Intermission!The seats are nicely padded and roomy. The sound was very good. The ""I'm not sure if the actors are miked or not"" good. The staging was well done though the foreshortening may have made the stage look smaller than it is. I'd need to see a different production in order to tell. Right now ""Indian Summer"" is playing. I'd be remiss if I didn't write a review of it. It was very funny, yet with a melancholy ending. Good stuff. I really hope I'm able to see another play here in the future. It's a lovely space.",8,6,9
4,Su-Yee L.,"New York, NY",117,306,154,5.0,8/29/2016,"Playwrights Horizons is an amazing off Broadway theater that shows new work by contemporary playwrights. So many of their shows have won awards so the talent (of both playwrights and actors) is definitely there. It's a great space to see a show--small enough that no matter where you are, you'll get a great view.Love that they offer rush tickets, their Live for Five lottery, and the free young members membership where you can always get tickets for $25 if you're under 30! I've seen tons of shows here from Sarah Ruhl's Stage Kiss to Greg Moss' Indian Summer and just recently, Aubergine (which just opened last Friday!) By the way, I'd HIGHLY recommend seeing Aubergine- one of the best plays I've seen this year. Go now!",1,,1
5,Nat M.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,305,741,4.0,3/27/2016,"This is 2 reviews in one - for the facility and the play I attended.Really nice building that is 4 stories and hosts more than one theater/play at one time. Large, clean bathrooms in the basement and they serve drinks on the 1st level.Attended Familiar, which was written by Danai Gurira. The room it was in didn't have a bad view from any seat and was small and intimate. The play was hilarious!!!! At least the first half was. The second half became more serious and brought me to tears. Overall, I loved it.",1,1,1
6,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",417,497,8935,5.0,7/19/2015,"Love, love, love PH!  Every show I've seen here has been a winner, musicals and plays alike.  And their venue is totally gorgeous.  Intimate, yet also modern and welcoming.  Their memberships for young people and students can't be beat- and they throw totally killer parties for their under 30 nights.  Themed food and decorations galore!",1,1,1
7,Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1183,814,1154,5.0,1/14/2013,"One Word: Mulan!What a fantastic performance by the Red Poppy Ladies all the way from Beijing!  For 32 performances only sadly, they will supply you with 70 minutes of percussion music to the beloved folklore of the infamous story of Mulan.  The intimacy of the theater allowed the viewers to be immersed in history, and also more importantly - feel it in the drum beats.Written up by the New York Times, these women stirred up a storm with not only an amazing arm workout -wow!- but, they did it with such profound certainty and feeling on their faces, that you couldn't help but wish it was a bit longer.  13 Scenes telling the life of Mulan from childhood school days up unto the day she is given awards from the Emperor.  Each girl is clearly distinct in their pose, and bring wonderment into the Chinese culture.  The scenes were projected with a little abstract before each, to give a little highlight as to what to expect.  Scenes ""Victory"" and ""A Song for Mulan"" were really profound; I would have bought the soundtrack if I could!  Percussion is more than just the drums - these ladies used laundry baskets, sticks, tables, chairs - you name it!  To call it more of a woman's ""Stomp"" I think is really short changing these girls talent!  Costumes were elegant as well, and made you wonder actually how much planning went into this production!Prices range from $69, but thanks to Living Social, I paid two tickets for $80!Please bring these ladies back soon!",3,2,2
8,Anna N.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,90,19,5.0,4/18/2014,"Last night, I went to see my first play at Playwrights Horizons and it was fantastic. So much so that I am seriously contemplating getting the 30 & Under membership. The play, ""Your Mother's Copy of the Kama Sutra,"" explored what it means to make yourself vulnerable, to be honest, and to really KNOW someone. I wasn't prepared for how much it'd affect me - after the show, I walked down 4 flights of stairs out of the theatre and down the street, holding back tears (only because everyone else decided to take the stairs too. Also, not a spoiler - it's a very intense, beautiful, emotionally charged story). I HIGHLY recommend it and I would go see it again in a heartbeat.To echo another reviewer, the seating is surprisingly spacious. Even without getting up to let people in, there was still a lot of room left between me and the passing patron. I sat in Row A (the third row) and had no trouble seeing what was going on onstage (except for a scene or two when the characters were sitting on the floor near the edge of the stage, but my short height also factors into that. I'm sure if I was taller, I could have seen over the heads in my line of sight).",4,1,1
9,Jeff L.,"Matawan, NJ",45,238,707,5.0,9/29/2015,This theater has two venues in main stage and a black box on the 4th floor.   They do a lot of new plays.  Very intimate space.  Have seen some great theater here and a few plays the were way out there.  A little bit away from times sq. but well worth the walk,1,1,2
10,Ondrea D.,"Bronx, NY",55,23,14,5.0,6/9/2014,"I love this place! My first show here was ""Stage kiss"" and it was a ridiculously funny. The theatre itself is spacious and the stages are decently size (off Broadway) which I love because during the play I watched last night "" Fly by the Night"" we were in the last row but it was still close enough to not need binoculars to see the actors. They are trying to get younger members to come so they have heavily discounted tickets for 30 and Under along with certain nights dedicated to the younger crowd. My favorite thing hands down is how they always have a photobooth to capture the moment and is it usually is based on the play going on at the time.",3,1,1

Updated review","Yesterday we saw the last show of the season - a musical, entitled ""Fly By Night"" - and we LOVED it; it's the best show we've seen there all year.  Not only did every single performer do a terrific job in their respective roles, but the storyline was very touching and it also had a lot of humor.  Performances continue through June 29.",1,1,1
12,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,4.0,12/9/2013,"Decent space.  And very welcoming staff.  The seating looked like it might be tight initially, but proved to be quite roomy.  There was a bit of a shuffle issue in that, when one person near you moved, your seat shuffled a bit.  And sitting in the front row was definitely not the best option, as it is right up on the edge of the proscenium.  But the staff were lovely, the space is clean, and the production I saw (The Curious Case of Watson) was quite nice.",1,1,1
13,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,5.0,3/14/2011,"I've always been curious what kind of plays they stage in this space and finally had a chance to see the inside for Ma-Yi's Flipzoids. The space is beautiful and perfect for small indie productions. It's small enough to maintain that sense of intimacy I like to have when enjoying off-Broadway plays. And yet, it's a very well maintained space. I'd love to come back here again!",3,1,3
14,Ray S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0,4.0,9/21/2014,"I have a secret that I have decided to share.Several days later, I am recovered from an astonishingly fun 30 & Under night at Playwrights Horizons to see their new play, Bootycandy. So this is mostly going to be a review of the party. But first, as for the theater: it is a nice smallish theater with all great seats. Now as for the party...AWESOME.There was DANCING (with and without embedded instructions ala ""to the left..""), there was ICE CREAM (technically custard but sweet holy red velvet), there was FOOD (spring rolls, pita chips, hummus, shrimp), DRINKS (beer and punch) and as Irving Berlin once said, there's ""no people like show people.""I am tempted not to review this because I'm afraid if the 30 and Under nights get too popular then the lines to get food will be even longer than they were, but even those lines were fun in such company.",1,1,1
15,Lauren B.,"San Francisco, CA",106,110,23,5.0,5/22/2009,"My boyfriend and I went with some friends to the ""30 and under"" party here last night, hosted by PH.  Got to see a fantastic play and mingle with young theater-goers like ourselves. and the after party served tater tots and cupcakes so obviously I was smitten. hooray good theater, talented actors, and a wonderful staff!!!GREAT Theater, GREAT prices, GREAT all around!I miss doing theater so much.tear.",4,1,3
16,Laur T.,"New York, NY",26,780,0,4.0,4/12/2010,"Small but clean and compact theatre. I really love the view overlooking the rooftop park and playground from the concession / lobby area.Theatre-wise, it's a small but manageable space. I was here to watch A Cool Dip in the Barren Saharan Crick and while I did not necessarily love the performance, it was ok.BTW, I love that the concessions stand provided those large bottled water with a tap that one may help themselves to gratis.... it's the little things like these that count!",4,1,3
17,DeDe D.,"New York, NY",18,142,0,5.0,9/11/2010,"Hands down my favorite place to see a play in New York. I saw ""Clybourne Park"" and Albee's ""Me, Myself and I"" here and it's just a terrific venue. Every seat is a good seat and it's a very comfortable, modern facility. I also love the opportunity to see new work at a reasonable price. You may not catch the latest blockbuster here - but you will have an excellent night at the theater.",3,1,3
18,Zakiyyah A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,10/5/2014,"First let me start off by saying that I REALLY enjoyed the play ""Booty Candy"". It was funny as well as eye-opening. I absolutely loved the message!!I did however have an issue with the house manager who worked on Saturday Night 10/5. The show was to start at 8pm, sometimes that doesn't always happen and that's fine. At 8:05pm myself and another friend got up to make a quick run to the restroom. Before leaving, we asked the two ushers at the door if we had enough time to run to the restroom, they said yes and we headed down the stairs. 5 minutes later when we returned, the house manager was standing upstairs and told us that we could not enter the theater because the play had already started and suggested that we wait downstairs and watch the play on the screen until scene change. I informed her of what the ushers had told us, and she replied, ""yeah, you didn't have time to go to the restroom"". By this time, my friend (who caught the elevator from the restroom floor) was up the stairs where there were chairs. As I walk up to her, the house manager comes speeding behind me up the stairs and stands in front of the door as if I'm going to barge into the theater. She proceeds to tell us that she saw us walking to the restroom and attempted to get our attention. I do not believe that because the lobby was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop. The only people there were myself and my friend, so her attempt to get our attention was a complete Lie. We then asked her at what time do they usually stop people from going to the restroom and she stated 8:05, then said the time varies and sometimes it's 8:10, which basically meant that she did not know. We also asked how long until scene change and said she had NO IDEA. I asked for an approximate time and she stated that she did not know. This was NOT opening night, the play has been showing since August but she wanted us to believe that she had no idea what time scene change occurs. She further insulted us when a group of about 10 people walked in and were escorted up the stairs, she went got them and escorted them INTO the theater on the other side....IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW, not during scene change. So my friend and I, walked in at our own will and sat in empty chairs to not disturb anyone. A few minutes later, we saw more people coming in, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW and was seating in the overflow sections so they could not disturb anyone but still see the show. I wondered to myself, if she had just brought us up the stairs in those seats to begin with, everything would've been fine.She, the house manager, did not know at the time but I was there with a party of more than 15 people who all came to support our friend that was in the show. She didn't offer any smiles until she saw the amount of people we were with $$$$$$$$$$. Absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED the play but the manager working that night was a HORRIBLE host.",,,
19,Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",168,1243,167,3.0,7/17/2009,"This theater is kind of random because it is upstairs and when it is crowded people gather on the stairs which makes it hard for them to open the door, etc.  The theater itself is small which I guess you could label as giving everyone a great seat/view but I don't really agree with that.  I hate feeling that close to the stage.  It overwhelms my senses.  Also after the show everyone filed out and gathered downstairs which was really crowded.  For a small theater there isn't much they can do about space issues and I think they do the best that they can.  If I were given free reign to redesign this theater I would definitely change the layout/seats.",3,1,1
20,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",100,2100,2099,5.0,12/5/2005,"For nearly thirty-five years, Playwrights Horizons - located on West 42nd Street's Theater Row - has embraced both established and novice playwrights, composers, and lyricists and given them a home where they can develop and showcase new works, fine-tuning them based on audience reaction to workshop and fully-mounted productions in one of two theaters. Residencies in areas such as directing, stage management, musical theater, and marketing provide training for a career in the arts. Among the highly-acclaimed plays that have emerged from the theater are 'March of the Falsettos,' 'Sunday in the Park with George,' 'Driving Miss Daisy,' 'The Heidi Chronicles,' 'Marvin's Room,' 'Assassins,' and 'I Am My Own Wife,' all of them winners of multiple awards and honors, including the Tony, Obie, Olivier, and Pultizer Prize. Upcoming in early 2006 is 'Grey Gardens,' a musical based on Jackie O's aunt and cousin, former society belles who became eccentric recluses reduced to living in a decaying mansion in East Hampton.",9,1,8
21,Peter D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",125,265,1,5.0,9/16/2007,"Which to review? The place, or the shows? Well both get 5 stars. Just off the beaten path of Broadway is something better, more intimate, friendly, accomodating that what is the drawn out, revived and overpriced 'Main Stage' on Time Square. The sets are fantastic every time. A friend turned me in this direction 3 years ago, and I have been hooked since, and looking forward to performances  months from now!",4,1,1
