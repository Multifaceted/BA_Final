0,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",322,351,303,4.0,11/18/2018,"Came to Hill Country for a birthday dinner with a group of 8 on a Friday evening with a 7:15pm reservation. We were able to make a reservation the day before, which was great! There's an interesting service concept here that was different than anywhere else I have been. Basically, you need a table for your party but then you go up to 2 separate counters for your meats and sides. Pretty cool if you don't want to wait very long for your food. You can order drinks at the table and party platters if you wanted. Also, I give hill country 3.5 stars (yelp plz give us a half star ability!!)I ordered an IPA from a wide draft and craft beer menu. To eat, my fiancé and I split 1/2 lb pulled pork, 1/4 lb brisket, and 3 small sides (mac and cheese, green bean casserole, and baked beans with bacon). I preferred the pork to the brisket as the brisket wasn't particularly tender. The pulled pork was very tender but I felt it could have had more flavor. I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce either because it was a bit bland. Maybe our table only had 1 type of bbq and the hot sauce...I feel like there's normally a few different bbq sauce options at similar places. The green beans were absolutely out of this world! The baked beans and mac and cheese were both good too, but they didn't stand a chance against the green bean casserole!Fun spot for a group meal and one of the better bbq places in the city (on par with dino bbq but better than mighty quinns).",,,1

But who cares. Here for the meat right? And boy it did not disappoint. The ribs were large and well cooked, little rare on the inside, but oh. so. tender. I got the pulled pork sandwich as well which was delicious. Granted everything need a heavy dose of BBQ sauce which they have in pour bottles at each table, but who doesn't love sauce. The sides were great. Risotto to baked beans to mac&cheese to cornbread and green beans.Because of the lack of crowd the BBQ guy took us to the back and showed us the pits. Imported wood from Ft. Worth, TX and the pits were giant. Definitely recommend if you're missing some good ol' southern cooked BBQ and some finger licking sides. Being from TX I approve of Hill Country BBQ!",,,
2,Damon M.,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,3,2.0,10/3/2018,"Visited for the first time this past Friday on an early evening with two other friends. Service - We came up to the hostess and asked for a table which there were plenty unoccupied. Few more people came in after us and also waited to be seated. We were told it would be an HOUR wait because ""people are going to start coming in at this time"" and suggested us a high top in the bar so we took it but what bothered us (me at least) was that people were headed down for the live music and not for a table and it felt like the hostess was intentionally saving the tables for larger parties who may or may not have reservations. Menu was brought to us at the high top and as it was our first time there, the hostess could've explained how the system works better instead of giving us the brief version and leaving us confused, and I had to get up and asked again. Menu could've been organized better especially since some platters were not listed as seen on their online menu. We got up and ordered our food but when we got back to our table, we had to ask for utensil and water which should be brought to us when we were seated in the BEGINNING. An hour into our time, still unoccupied tables. People were coming in for live music and I was observing the hostess when people were coming in. A party of 2 came in and it appeared  they were told a wait time as the gentleman was looking at his watch; THEY WERE FREAKING SEATED IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. More small parties showed up, 2-4 people and to no surprise, they were seated. Food - Two of us ordered the Pitmaster. For me, the brisket was delicious and loved my portion. Ribs were a little dry so I had to pour on bbq sauce and all I tasted was salt and pepper before I used bbq sauce. Sausage was good, had a spicy kick and had a slight smokey taste to it. Chicken was nothing special as it was like eating rotisserie chicken from Costco, and the sides I had collard greens and baked beans which were great.Would've gave it 3 stars but the service was the main problem. There is no way majority of the tables were reserved, and those that arrived should be seated and not told it would be an hour wait when they can see people immediately getting seated. Utensils, water, napkins and sauces should be provided when customers are seated at high tops, since those were seated at regular tables were already provided. The hostess could at least notified servers that there are customers seated at high tops. Would not come back to an establishment that screws up the basics.",,,

Originally read about the great barbecue experience at Hill Country and tried it about 5 years ago. Everything is excellent, from the meats like brisket and ribs to delicious sides like mac and cheese, skillet cornbread, and corn pudding.My experience tonight was pretty spectacular. Long day visiting the city, basic food, and starving. To my stomach's rescue was Hill Country's very reasonable ($32) all-you-can-eat Monday special. But beyond that, this restaurant was kind of an oasis from the hectic day, and the friendly excellent service really made it a tremendous experience. From the folks at the front to those at the meat and sides stations and especially to my server Fausto, thank you thank you thank you.",,,
4,Jay S.,"Manhattan, NY",55,9,2,3.0,10/31/2018,"Gf and I ordered delivery for the big game since we were craving good BBQ. We ordered the 2 meat special among other items for $24.99 and thought we'd treat ourselves & eat a lot. The size of it was laughable & I'm embarrassed for ordering it. Even the sides were kiddie size LOL. No value. We ended up cooking after all. Won't consider this a dinner place any longer but a ""TAPAS joint"" if I'm on a diet.",1,1,
5,M P.,"Whittier, CA",2,10,10,5.0,9/30/2018,"Welcome Texas BBQ to NYC. This is a great approximation of Hill country BBQ, which just so happens to be their name. I came early on a Sunday morning to avoid thier crowds and I wanted time to see the rest of the city.  Glad I did, the meal I ordered was huge and will leave me full the rest of the day.First off, I judge all BBQ on 4 criteria, BBDD;A) Brisket and RibsB) Beans and Mac & CheeseC) Desserts (No Texas BBQ meal is complete without a cobbler/pie/bread puddinD) DrinksTheir brisket is on point. Smoked, a bark, and offered lean or moist. While the bark could use some work, it was out an out a great approximation of the Texas brisket. While the deeper meat lacked a bit of debth of flavor, the outter cuts were outstanding. The ribs, were evenbetter than the brisket. Moist, fall apart and very flavorfull. They were cut a bit thinner to get that flavor in there, but not in a way that made you think you were being cheated. They also have sauce and dry rub table side, a nice touch.Bean! Yum. Huge chunks of meat, great flavor and made me want to go home to try to recreate the flavor.Mac&Cheese, what can I say? I love a thick rue of cheese, and this hit the mark. Penne style noodles, can cheesy goodness.Desserts, in the menu/meal card it marks their Hill country favorite as the chocolate chunk cookie. It was good, but didn't remind me of my second home. Ice cream, cupcakes and pudding. The no longer serve pie, but it's still listed in the menu. I opted for the banana pudding. It was small but good. As for drinks, they have a full bar with quite a few beers from Texas (Shiner, Lonestar, Austin) I opted for a Shiner Bock, served in a ball jar. It took me home. Thank you HCBbq for a great meal.So if you dear reader are ever looking for a quick trip to Texas without the requisite travel, head to Hill Country BBQ and order to your hearts content. You won't regret it.",4,,
6,Nimita P.,"New York, NY",10,65,40,3.0,10/5/2018,"My bf was in the mood for some bbq and so we decided to give this place a try. It's pretty hard finding a good bbq place in New York City. We went on a Friday night at around 6pm and it was just starting to get crowded, good thing I had a reservation! The table they sat us at was right in the middle of two other couples and really close to each other. We just decided to sit at the bar at our own table, such a good decision! We ordered almost a pound of pulled pork, two Kreuz jalapeño cheese sausage links, and a side of Mac n cheese and potato salad. The sausage links were delicious! The pulled pork was alright, nothing great. It was a bit dry so we added a bunch of sauce to it. The Mac n cheese was great, I would definitely order that again. The potato salad was also pretty good, but I would try another side next time. The food was pretty pricey but I guess that is just NYC!",,,
7,Yael D.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,538,1769,2.0,7/26/2018,"I have this Mama friend whom I adore.  When it comes to our senses of humor, we're likethis.  But we're not so compatible when it comes to picking restaurants.  If she (a) is desperate to take a load off; (b) is ravenous; or (c) NEEDS a beer, then all bets are off.  She will walk into the nearest halfway decent looking place without a second thought.  I, however, would never dream of setting foot into an eatery without properly vetting it first (read: checking Yelp).  But never mind.  To make a very long story short, against my better judgement, I caved to Mama friend's insistence we stop here.  And yes, I lived to regret it:So yeah... Ordered a Cue & Two Combo Platter, 'cause why not try everything when you're doomed anyway?Both Chicken & Sausage weren't bad in that they were tender and flavorful, though not especially special in terms of seasoning or anything that made me crave a second bite.  They were also alarmingly pink.  So much so that I decided to ask our server about it.  She explained that it was something to do with the way they're cooked, though am blanking on the specifics.  At any rate, I lived to tell the tale.  Ribs were uber bland.  My Oven Ribs, coated with dry rub, mustard, and liquid smoke, cooked low n' slow, and then slathered with regular 'ole bottled sauce are infinitely better than this was.  Considering I am a Jewish girl who only recently dared break taboo to attempt making these, that is very sad, indeed.  Brisket was pretty tender, but again with the uber bland issue.  I didn't get any smoke or bark.  Yet again, I felt like I could do this better at home, armed with some chili sauce, beer, a touch of brown sugar, and lots of onion and garlic.  Just sayin.'Sides of Mac & Cheese and Baked Beans with Burnt ends were forgettable.  'Cause I can't recall a darn thing about 'em.A word about the Sauce Selection:  There were just two sauces on the table and they were not near magical enough to resuscitate my meal.On a bright note, we lucked into a Happy Hour, running from 4 - 6 pm on the Saturday we visited.  I think a Classic Margarita was maybe $8(?).  Too bad I couldn't really detect much tequila, and believe me, I wanted to!Bottom line:  Hometown is my BK go-to for BBQ, and while I'll be the first to admit it has its flaws, every time I stray, I realize how non-sucky it really is.  At least in relative terms.  So it was here.:(",14,6,8
8,Carolyn L.,"Vancouver, Canada",125,1169,10578,4.0,4/13/2018,"My friend highly recommended this place for the moist brisket, so that was what we had. We were not very hungry at 4pm so we shared a Cue and Two combo. It was choice of 2 meats, 2 sides and skillet corn bread.We had 2 portions of the moist brisket and some of it was the burnt ends. The burnt ends were surprisingly tasty. I loved that much more. It reminded me of the Chinese char siew (bbq meat). We were also given the more fatty cut, I wonder if one can request for less fat. For the sides, we decided on the bourbon sweet potato mash and corn pudding. The corn pudding was to die for! I could eat a big tub of it! It was just sweet corn but somehow the mix was delicious. The bourbon sweet potato mash also nice but was too alcoholic for my taste. It sure had plenty of bourbon in it. It was also a bit on the sweet side. Then again it was sweet potato. The skillet corn bread was so good too. Move over, Kenny Rogers. I would want to come back again just to have the burnt ends brisket/moist brisket with corn bread and corn pudding. Mmmm.....I'm drooling just thinking about it now. The place is huge, and you can definitely host parties or mini celebrations here. There is also a space downstairs with space for a band. The washroom is decked out western cowboy style. Interesting.",2,,1

Amazingly friendly staff who made sure we were taken care of. The cocktails and beer selection is great here. The guys who work at the meat counter were so friendly and we were having a good laugh at how much we were ordering. We definitely over-ordered. I recommend next time ordering less and just going up more often as needed.Get the cornbread, brisket (fatty!!!), and for sure the mac and cheese. You will NOT be disappointed. Oh, and the pork belly!  They even had enough side options to satisfy a vegetarian in our group.The brisket though tasted just like I remember from Austin, TX. You know what, just GO NOW!",9,5,9

12,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",4,72,0,4.0,9/22/2018,"This place is great!!!!! Barbecue in the city is almost always horrible. I've been to bbq places here that are cooler, hipper, and trendier than Hill Country, but Hill Country absolutely has the best food. Ordering is pretty easy. You just wait in line to pick your meat and then wait in a different line to pick your sides, basically buffet style. The food is expensive but if you order a sandwich or something for lunch it's cheaper. I liked the pulled pork and the ribs. The Carolina sauce for the pork was great and you should definitely ask for more, as they only have Texas sauce and hot sauce on the tables.The sides were hit and miss. Collard greens were pretty good. Potato salad was gross. Does this place not have fries?? Sort of weird for a bbq joint.Anyway, it's expensive, not fancy, you don't get table service, but the food is surprisingly good.",1,,1

14,Marissa L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,187,388,4.0,2/8/2018,"Hill Country is where to go if you want Texas-style BBQ in Manhattan. It's modeled after the Texas meat markets, so you get a ""meal ticket"" to take up with you to get your meats and sides, and then carry it all back to your table. You can get drinks and bar snacks from your server, but otherwise it's all just get up and get it yourself, which I like.Over the many years we've been going to Hill Country, I've tried a lot of their meat selection. My favorites are the chicken and the various Kreuz sausages, although the brisket and pulled pork are also good. On our last visit, I also got the turkey, which I regretted because over 1/3 of it was skin and fat, and it was so salty it was almost inedible. I didn't remember it being like that in the past, but not doing that again when so many of the other meats are consistently good.As far as the sides, I don't think we've had a bad one, but I personally like my BBQ there with some combination of the green bean casserole, corn pudding, collard greens, black eyed caviar, and mac and cheese, in part depending on what's available on any given day. We also tried the smoky chipotle deviled eggs for the first time on our last visit and really liked those.This month is chili month, so we also got their chili sampler for $16 on our last visit. It came with three bowls: the usual EAK bowl of red, a white chicken chili, and a special Chiang Mai pork chili in collaboration with Fish Cheeks. I love chili of all varieties, so I was happy with this. It was a nice treat to have this in addition to our usual BBQ items.I haven't really spent time in Texas, so I like that Hill Country brings a taste of Texas to NYC with actual Texas products like the Kreuz sausages and other specials. I also like that you can make reservations instead of just waiting in a long line. Although Hill Country isn't my favorite BBQ spot in all of NYC (a certain place in Brooklyn holds that honor), it's a very solid choice.",1,,1

Great service. Check. Great atmosphere. Check. Great live music in the basement that keeps me distracted from the war waging in my belly. Check. On those merits alone this place is an easy 4. Not a country fan but still had a great time here. This food however. Epitomizes hit or miss. And miss. And miss. And - you get the point. Chili wings with ranch sauce. Awesome. Pulled pork nachos. Tortilla so hard and thick. Almost painful to eat. Then the cool toppings and cheez whiz. Just not good. Then we got a mayor's platter full of forgettable cuts. Hard short ribs.

She called the restaurant and spoke with the receptionist (didn't get her name) who was very helpful and rectified issue for us immediately. She arranged free delivery to us and the food came shortly after the call.

20,rhett t.,"Miami-Dade, FL",0,68,0,4.0,11/4/2018,"I went to pay tribute to a pioneer in barbecue, my family tagged along for the food. The ambience is dead on, a decent replica of a Texas barbecue  restaurant. Servers are a mix of NY attitude with subpar attention.  I'm guessing the tips are small because you actually get your own food, so it's possible HCB isn't hiring the best servers. Here's what we tried:Babyback ribs -- Probably the best thing I ate.  The ribs had the traditional Texas salt and pepper rub, which can put some people off, but I found the rub balanced and not over powering.  Once I added sauce -- I know that's a no no to some purists, but that's how I roll -- it was great flavor, not too sweet or salty.  There was good mouthfeel from the ribs.Pulled Pork -- Very nice interpretation. The pork lacked a strong smoke taste and a smoke ring wasn't visible. That said, the pork was moist and carried a nice pork flavor. The sauce aided the pork nicely, but it could have carried it off without sauce.Prime Rib -- Cooked to a perfect rare temperature, the prime rib was surprisingly not tender and succulent. Also, here the dry rub was too powerful as the salt and pepper intruded on what should have been the star of the show. The meat was not as tender as it should have been.  A real disappointment.Market Chicken --  This was a nice surprise.  Here, the breast meat was very tender. The skin was excellently seasoned with a balanced rub. The chicken was a reasonably priced hit.  Sausage -- Extremely disappointing.  The meat in the casing crumbled.  It was impossible to cut and it really destroyed the sausage.  The mouthfeel was yucky (sometimes a children's word is the best descriptor).  The sides were just ok.  Nothing stood out among a normal crop of mac and cheese, cole slaw and other expected sides. The bar was well stocked on the beer side. The banana bread pudding was a huge hit with the family. Hill Country delivered some tasty barbecue.  It wasn't the best I've had by any measure; that said the meat was nicely executed. Any stop of top BBQ joints in the City should probably include HCB.",,,

E had the Pitmaster special that comes with two sides. The chicken was tender and moist, the hot link and brisket was a bit dry but very flavorful and delicious and the spare ribs were delicious. Sides of Mac and cheese and greens... how could we not. I had the Bloody Mary which was spicy, like I like it, and my Bo had a local dark beer- both were very good. We left happy and full.

23,Akansha B.,"Manhattan, NY",260,326,179,4.0,3/26/2018,This is pretty much the fast food of BBQ.  Is it 100% authentic and fresh? Nope.  But it's tasty - and I might even like this set-up more than Dinosaur BBQ (but Dino has the better sauces).  The upfront ordering keeps this place casual and also considerate when it comes to portions.  Ended up having the brisket and mac n' cheese when I came here last.  Loved the brisket and shoulder but was not a huge fan of the mac n'cheese - it did complement the meal ok which was fine with me.I would say if I am craving a super casual/meaty meal - this might not be a bad option if I'm in the area.  Should you go out of your way to come here for a meat fix?  Not necessarily.  Come here if convenient.,6,1,2

The side of mac and cheese cost $6.50 and was super small. Even if the prices were 50%off it still wouldn't be worth it...Service - Bad. Staff didn't seem friendly but rather like they were working in a high school cafeteria and didn't want to be there. You get seated, a server takes your drink order, then you get up and do counter service to get your food, but then your server doesn't bring your check, you pay on the way out. On the way out the server told me to pay at the cashier and the cashier told me to pay with the server... this is easily the worst restaurant setup ever.Atmosphere - casual, decorated to be like picnic tables sorta but seemed like they only committed half way.

However, my office cafeteria serves better food on a regular basis for less than half the cost. Although I didn't have some horrifying experience (such as finding a fly in my food) it was still well below average. The best thing I had was the barbecue sauce and it was just slightly better than what you might buy at a local grocery. Although sauce is an important part of barbecue average sauce with undeveloped flavors should not be the the best thing at a good barbecue joint.",1,1,1

We also ordered a bunch of sides including baked beans, coleslaw, and collard greens (just so-so), nachos and wings. They brought the food to us and we didn't have to pick up. It was seamless.

With a wide yet simple selection of classics like brisket to special sausages my eyes were causing my mouth to drool (nearly) in anticipation of smokey goodness entering my mouth hole!With my classic selection of brisket, pulled pork, Mac-n-Cheese, and baked beans I sat down at my table with an extra side of corn bread since it came with my meal, and why would I turn down corn bread?!?!The pulled pork had a rich smokey flavor that was so juicy and tender that was so good it just seemed wrong. I gave the brisket the ""squeeze test"" to see how juicy it was, and boy, it was just dripping with goodness. The brisket was fork tender and was enhanced by the vinegar and tomato sauce that was available on my table.As for my sides, the Mac was just ok, the corn bread was not served hot which was interesting but was still very good. The only bad part of the meal was that the baked beans were under cooked, but when I told the counter it was exchanged with out a seconds hesitation!Even the wet napkin that was given just screamed of quality, I have NEVER gotten such a robust wet napkin at ANY BBQ before!Nothing I like more than some good BBQ and great service!****4.5 Stars",,,

I also ordered a deviled eggs side (2 small pieces), and that side dish alone was a whopping $4.25. I think for these parts of town, the BBQ is considered to be amazing, but I just thought it was okay. The chicken was juicy and tender, but the brisket was dry and the chopped pork needed more flavor. I had to douse the pork with LOTS of BBQ sauce. As for sides, I really enjoyed the creamy corn pudding. The coleslaw tasted average and the cornbread was more like a corn muffin instead of real cornbread, but it was still a nice side to share. I just wish they had hushpuppies here!There was live country music playing on the night that we went and the music was great.

This is a must-get!We also got Burnt Ends and Pork Short Ribs. Burnt Ends were not as crispy as I expected them to be. Pork Short Ribs, it tasted like smoked ham but I am not a fan of it.For sides, the Mac and Cheese had really good flavor but it was super dry as well. It was not the saucy cheese that I expected. Collard Greens was worth getting if you want some greens. The applewood bacon adds a good smokey flavor. It's good.Barbecue meats were just okay.",7,6,6
30,R B.,"Maitland, FL",0,1,0,5.0,10/29/2018,"Hill Country BBQ is the best BBQ I've ever had! The moist brisket was amazing as was the lean brisket too. They were the most tender and moist brisket I've ever had. I also had the ribs which were also very tender and tasty. The portions were huge even for the lunch menu.  All of the sides I had were great - but the bourbon sweet potatoes and beans were both unique and especially good. We also had heard the desserts we're really good so we tried the banana pudding - which was incredible. Again, the best I've ever tasted.We also really liked the casual atmosphere. Most restaurants we visited in the city felt very cramped, but this one felt nice and open and comfortable.  We also liked being able to watch the football game on the TVs they had.The servers and staff were very welcoming and friendly.  It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!Thanks Hill Country for an awesome meal and fun experience.",,,

So if you can't handle sodium, I would advise you to avoid this place. But if you're ok and healthy, yeah this place is great. I love how spacey it is. It's nicely air conditioned and has two levels of seating. They have a live band in some nights and the people who work here are great. They know each cut they and make good recommendation.I really like their baby back ribs. I also had their regular pork ribs. Wasn't a fan of the sausages, I thought they were too oily.",,,
32,Christian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",672,199,205,3.0,4/7/2018,"Clearly a popular spot because the place was busy and loud. We didn't wait long before being seated, however they have a ""station style"" of ordering that was new to us. The servers bring you drinks and side things but it's up to you to go to various stations to get your food. I wasn't a fan of this method since I'm so impatient when it comes to standing on lines. In spite of the ordering we enjoyed our ribs and fries and the lines didn't take too long. We'd try them again since we both love ribs",,,
33,Ricky C.,"Austin, TX",1,1,1,1.0,7/20/2018,"We ordered delivery from Hill Country on Seamless and while the food that we received was good, we ordered 1 pound of prime rib and were delivered the portion in the photo attached. When we called the restaurant and seamless to ask for a refund and inquire about the size of the order, the restaurant refused to offer us a refund. We had also ordered a half pound of pork loin and the fact that the ""pound"" of prime rib weighed less than half pound of pork loin was rather telling. Honestly very disappointed, not only for the money wasted but also the time. As a native Texan, this embarrasses me and makes me quite ashamed that such a restaurant would even advertise that they source their meat from central Texas. Seamless/delivery customers be warned, order at your own peril",1,,
34,Eric B.,"Hoboken, NJ",185,102,57,3.0,2/23/2018,"Every time I've gone here, and this over a 5 year period, the quality and expectations have gone downhill.And that's unfortunate. Hill Country is modeled after the best that Austin has to offer.  Think La BBQ.  And, of course, Franklin's. BBQ's best.Any my first time here it rivaled these grail establishments. #find.But overtime the quality has -sadly- declined.Meats, as they have been presented, have become drier.  Less flavorful. And pricier. Turkey breast has become an industry standard to a drier meat I can no longer recommend.  Same goes for brisket.  Sausage has been consistent, but that's likely because it's outsourced to Texas' best (look it up).While still a promising BBQ joint, this being NYC and all, when considering the very high price (a healthy guy ain't leaving here spending under $25 for lunch) I'm not sure I can recommend Hill anymore.",1,,
35,Tim K.,"Evans, GA",3,98,102,4.0,9/11/2017,"This is a solid BBQ place in the heart of Manhattan Unexpected goodness. However, since NYC is such a cornucopia of good restaurants, I might not go back. That's not because it wasn't good. That's based more on available selection of other places. Let's start with the cons: the upstairs tables where we were seated was a mess. The tables were placed in wonky spaces so not only did we basically have to climb over other patrons, but the waitress could barely get to us to take our order. She eventually had to move other tables around.  Weird. The pros: Our waitress Catherine (goes by Cat) was very friendly and knowledgeable about the establishment. She had a great sense of humor which made it easy to stay for a while. Since we were newbies, she explained how it worked and took our drink orders and off we went. We ordered the big sampler of meat that came with two sides. Actually, we ordered two - since there were four of us. We didn't get through it all. The brisket was excellent as was the chicken, ribs, and sausage. Uncharacteristically, we ordered dessert (thanks, Cat) and we weren't disappointed. I had the strawberry shortcake and was very happy with my selection. They have a great selection of beer, wine, and liquor along with your normal soft drinks. Overall, we left satisfied.",,,1
36,Britt D.,"New York, NY",346,50,81,1.0,7/22/2018,"This place is an actual joke for takeout. Their meal sides are so small-legit 2 tsp. There was probably 9 noodles in my side of Mac and cheese. Everywhere else on the seamless menu tells you ounces, but it's almost as if they purposely left out the size, knowing it's so small. I would not recommend this bbq, also because it's truly not even that great. The brisket was honestly very dry. Very bad experience- very dissatisfied.",,,
37,Karla M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",30,54,68,5.0,5/28/2018,"If you're looking for great ribs & BBQ chicken- this is the place for you! It was so good- but you do have to serve yourself. There is an all-you-can-eat option for $32 (not bad)! The chicken was so good, there BBQ sauce was great, and the sides were great (especially the mac & cheese and corn bread).It's not fancy or nice at all- if you show up in stretch pants you'll fit in fine and if you wear anything nicer than jeans you'll look out of place.

We had lean brisket, pulled pork and burnt ends.  I am a vegetarian (weird, I know but my family are avid carnivores) and enjoyed the cold slaw, deviled eggs and corn casserole. My problem is the process of getting the food. There is a meat counter and a sides counter. The wait for meat counter wasn't too bad but the wait for sides was very long. I took the meat to our table so our table could start at least eating that. By the time I got back with the sides they had pretty much eaten.  Most customers that I talked to were also confused. You have to have a ticket which several of us did not have.  If they offered full service, we would skip Blue Smoke and always come here",,,

Once your seated at your table your given a ticket which you will use to order your food. So essentially you have to get up and get your own food. I ordered the brisket and which was okay, a bit on the drier side. Once i added bbq sauce it became better. I really enjoyed the wings. They were amazing and AJ would definitely come back for the wings. Everything else was just okay. The sweet potatoes were delicious, but I wasn't impressed by the baked beans or cornbread.

Our server was great, came by to take our order and then explained how to order food. You go up and get your food in one of two lines, one for meat and one for the sides. You have a menu card and it gets marked depending on what you get. We decided to do the 2 meat deal, you get to choose two types of meats, two sides, and you get cornbread on the side. I tried the pulled pork and the lean brisket. Both were very good!! For the sides I got cole slaw and corn pudding. You can also ask for white bread on the side, and I made myself a pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce. While it doesn't look like you get a lot of food, it really is a lot!! I only ate about half before I was completely stuffed. Only complaint we had was it was so hot in the restaurant. It was a hot day, combined with the meat being cooked right near our table, it was very warm. I had to make my way to the downstairs area, where it was a bit cooler, to cool off.Overall great food though, will definitely be back!!",1,,
45,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",70,302,103,5.0,1/29/2018,"Hill Country BBQ Market is an awesome place for a large party because you can have separate checks and because everyone can get something different! We came here for a birthday party, which was awesome because Hill Country BBQ Market is like a large mess hall with long picnic benches, meaning it's really easy for individuals to grab their own food and then convene to eat together. Each person takes their own order form around to each station (meats, sides, desserts, etc) and gets it ""stamped"" with the price of each item. You can order drinks from the servers, who will ""stamp"" your order form with your drink price as well. After dining, you check out individually (or with however many people you decided to include on your order form) and pay that way. It's great because you can dictate how many people you want to pay with. The BBQ is delicious. We chose to split the moist brisket and duck. 1/2lb of each was barely enough for 2 people to share, so I would suggest getting a higher quantity. The moist brisket was indeed juicy (why would anyone choose lean?) and the duck had a strong herb flavor and was very tender. Sides worth getting: Sweet Potato Bourbon Mash and Skillet Cornbread (delicious maple butter included). The confetti coleslaw was not very flavorful and not worth getting. Also, there is live music in the lower level later in the evening! We didn't get to stay for it, but they were starting up just as we were leaving around 9 PM. We had a great experience and I will definitely be back if we have a large group to entertain!",,,

My wife's cocktail was not good.Most of the food you go and order at separate counters, but there is table service for the drinks and for taking away dishes. Getting someone's attention to order drinks took several minutes. We ended up not touching them (my wife hated hers and I didn't want to drink alone) and left most of each of our side dishes for them to take back, but none of the servers thought to talk to us about that or remedy the situation.A few things to recommend it -- I would probably order out meat from here again if I already had sides lined up from someone else -- but on the whole our dinner here was a bust.",,,

In other words, the card acts as your check so be careful not to lose it!My friend and I sat at the bar ordered a couple of beers and shared a bunch of different meats such as; ribs, brisket, chicken, & of course you can't have BBQ w/o the mac and cheese & corn bread.

57,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,4.0,8/11/2017,"When I came here the first time (Friday, 10pm), it was so loud and such a bro-fest that I didn't try again for a whole year.The next time, I came earlier, with a reservation in hand. Didn't matter - when we left around 8pm, the place still wasn't crowded and there was no line. The live musician was crooning to no one.Hill Country is a cavernous space in the Texas ""barbecue market"" style, with super country decor and pretty decent BBQ. You order drinks from your server, who will appear at your table sometime after you're led to it by the hostess. You'll also get a little paper booklet, which you hand to people at each of the different stations (BBQ, sides, etc.) to log your order. A line at the center of the room leads to the different stations.The sides were mediocre, which is a crying shame because sides are an easy place for BBQ spots to shine (easy to make in heaps, easy to keep hot!). The green bean salad and mac&cheese were both served lukewarm - kind of a travesty. The corn bread with whipped butter was dry and flavorless.BBQ is weighed and packed in brown butcher paper. The ""'Cue & 2"" ($23) includes two smaller portions (about 1/4 lb) of meat of your choice + two tiny sides. It's meant for one person, and it's not a ton of food, but great for sampling. - The moist brisket was excellent: dreamy, tender and smoky. - The burnt ends were a continuation of my never having had the Lifechanging Burnt Ends everyone talks about. Sadface.- The pork belly was wobbly and decadent, but the fat was so aggressive! It's something about the flavor of the fat that can make pork belly start to taste awful after 3 wonderful bites. And yes, I've had lots of great pork belly where this wasn't an issue.Tasty and all, I'm glad we went with sampler sizes, since the salt and fat of everything would have been too much, even in 1/4 lb servings.Happy hour (4pm-7pm and 10am-12am, every day) is a nice bonus.",4,3,3

The moist brisket is also very good. The sides are also sold separately at a different counter so expect to spend a good chunk of money. Their mash potatoes and corn muffins are very good.

The best thing is that western dancehall/barnyard feel when you go downstairs. I got to see Jakob Dylan once, and that was great. I even saw an ENTIRE TABLE of people from the famed Kreuz's Market (a famous Texas BBQ place)- they made the trek all the way to NYC to eat at Hill Country! They have karaoke nights, but depending on how many margaritas you've had you may consider the quality of the singing... questionable.

The baked beans were yummy and the collards, even yummier.I will have to go back when a live band is playing.",,,

76,Steven H.,"Flushing, NY",0,12,0,2.0,11/27/2017,"First time doing the all you can eat Monday night, food was good but the service was horrendous. Our server, Francesca (that was the name on the receipt but she never bothered to introduce herself to us) came and said she was going to bring us wristbands for the all you can eat deal. We sat for 15 minutes waiting and trying to get her attention before she came back with the wristbands saying ""oh you don't even need these."" Why would you tell us to wait for wristbands? This was the last time we saw her. We got our food, which was good as usual before we needed refills on water. After 5 minutes of looking for her we went to the bar and refilled our own water. The dirty platters were never cleared from our table until the very end of the meal which made getting more food difficult. After our third time refilling our water at the bar, we walked up to another server at the service station letting them know she wasn't around. He just replied ""oh something happened with her"" and walked away as if he could care less.Upon paying we let the hostess/cashiers at the front know that we hadn't seen her and our service was terrible. Their reply was ""she left don't worry about it."" Second time that we alerted staff members and didn't even receive an apology. With so many other great options around the city this will be the last visit for some time. The attitudes and the management of the staff can definitely be better, it made a good experience disappointing and subpar.",5,,

78,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",316,454,6448,5.0,10/26/2016,"Love me some BBQ. And this is the joint to get your grub on. I've been here many times and it's spot on every time. The format has changed slightly with the waiter service but the atmosphere and the food has not. This place is a great hang out any night for casual dining and excellent food. There's live bands and karaoke nights. They show the games on a huge drop screen. Two levels of spirited fun. Note the happy hour times. Onto the grub:Drinks: love the Texas Red, served straight up in the bottle. The sweet tea is a classic served in the mason jar. And full bar scene - they have it all. Just order it. Nice assortment of Beers as well. BBQ:MUST try the Moist Beef Brisket. Tender, juicy,  smoky, great char on the edges (crisp), and by it's name - moist. Very flavorful. They have lean as well for those who don't want the fat. But that fat makes the brisket complete. Pork lovers must try the Hot Links and Spare Ribs. The hot links also smoky, packs some heat, wakes the taste buds. I don't eat spicy as most know from my reviews but this is a must try. My mouth was on fire but it was so good. As for the spare ribs, falls off the bone tender (the meat) but it remains in tact. Perfect. It's got a nice sweet glaze but then you bite in and get all of the rib flavor. The way meat should be. No sauces needed. No salt or pepper needed. Awesome as is. For the poultry lovers: besides their grilled chicken, they offer turkey and an apricot jam smoked duck breast. All Delicious! Pick any. I had the chicken leg last night and it was not for sharing. I liked it so much I didn't want to share! I'm bad, sorry. Notable sides: of course the mac and cheese, baked and rich cheese blend. It's a must. The second favorite was the baked beans slightly blackened and soft. Had a nice sweet gravy to it and a smoky velvety finish. I had two helpings. The cucumber salad (cold) was a stand out as well. The vinegrette was slightly tart and sour but it was a good balance. It is great for sharing. My friends got the dirty rice which I tasted but didn't want to fill up on so I only had one spoonful. Sadly last night they didn't have the sweet bourbon mash. I normally would get that. Desserts: I like peanut butter so I would often get the peanut butter and jelly cupcakes but they didn't have it yesterday. I ordered the Banana Pudding and Pecan Pie instead. Both desserts were heavenly. The banana pudding was light and fluffy. The vanilla wafer on top was a nice compliment. And the pecan pie I ordered it a la mode with salted caramel ice cream. It's good with vanilla too but we chose the caramel. Must try the chocolate pudding if you're a chocolate lover. That looked sinful but I stayed away given my sweet tooth is not chocolate induced. Hee heeTips: do not lose your meal ticket. It's a system that's just how it works. And order by piece or slice not by weight. You'll tend to over order but so worth it.",6,3,3

The hostess handed the 4 of us each a Meal Ticket card.  There are two separate lines...one is for the meat and the other is for the sides. One of my colleagues and I decided to share our food...we picked The Butcher's Pick consisted of 1/4 lb of Brisket which comes with either slices of bread or crackers so I chose bread. The guy puts a price label on my colleague's Meal Ticket card then we went over to the other line and got a side of Longhorn Cheddar Mac & Cheese and an extra side of Corn Pudding then the guy handed us two pieces of cornbread with sweet butter spread.My other colleague got a Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of Collard Greens and an extra side of Corn Pudding. My manager got a Brisket Sandwich with a side of Longhorn Cheddar Mac & Cheese (oops didn't take a picture of his food). This was the right amount of portion to share between two people. O M F G the brisket was seasoned so delicious and I love my meat to have some fatty parts on it. Ooooooooooo the cornbread has actual corn kernel in every bite ""mama like"" baby come into my belly. I absolutely love corn and that corn pudding sooooo freaking yummy as well and also the mac and cheese...mmmm superbly delicious!We left tips on our table and walked over to the cashier to pay for our individual Meal Ticket Card.

So this place has been on my list. We get there and sit down and are told to wait for a server to give us a ticket. After 10 mins we believe we might have heard them wrong and get up to order the food. The guy then asks for our ticket which apparently you need. He  Was so nice and got one for us. I wanted something on the bar menu which I had to order with the server .... We wait and wait and finally he comes to ask if we needed anything 15 minutes after arriving. Then I tried to get up to pay and he they said no, to wait.. wait 10 minutes then for someone to come.... then they recommend a 18/22% tip? For what? Getting us our water and confusing the heck out of us? Having us wait and try and take our food before we are done...this all would have been fine if you didn't ask for a tip.. that just seems like you don't pay your staff well enough. We the customers did the work.Then 9 pm the music started ... terrible ... get some cover  bands!! That would be fun",,,
81,Eric G.,"New York, NY",236,103,63,5.0,1/13/2018,"I've been eating at Hill Country since 2009 and I just came here for dinner this Thursday and it did not disappoint. I had the Pitmaster special. Having skipped lunch I thought I could possibly finish the whole tray of food. But luckily the side dishes come in take out containers so it's easy to take home what you can't finish. The moist brisket is what you should most definitely order from the meat counter. The spare ribs, jalapeño cheese sausage and chicken are all so good but the brisket stands out against other bbq restaurants around the country. I've traveled and have attended the Big Apple BBQ festival every year in New York and Hill Country's brisket is a stand out. The sweet potato bourbon mash and the burnt ends baked beans are my favorite sides. You should also come here later in the evening for awesome live country music in the basement and happy hour from 10pm-12am.",,,
82,Wedge A.,"New York, NY",0,22,12,1.0,7/25/2018,"I hate this place. The only good thing about it is the prime rib which is overpriced. The turkey and chicken wings were dry beyond imagination. The turkey has that fowl taste. It was like eating desert roadkill. The barbecue sauce was nauseating. The waiter didn't refill my water the entire time until we were ready to leave. This place is self serve except for drinks. You get your own food and you used to go pay your own bill with the hostess. This time the waiter rang us up but it took over ten minutes to get him to do so. The check comes with the options of 18, 20 or 22%. For what? I think Hill Country is only good for alcoholics and people that The Hills Have Eyes was based on. Yep it's that much redneck dudefest.",,,

89,Helen C.,"New York, NY",25,80,114,5.0,6/2/2017,"Could be a very confusing and overwhelming experience if you've never been here (or to the other numerous locations across the country). Basically you: - Wait to be seated by host/hostess- Waiter comes to take your drink order and gives you a card- Take the card and stand in one of two lines - meat line or sides line- Order off the menu (or order meat by the pounds) and give your card to the servers to mark off your order- Bring the card with you to check out and pay at the end  The servers were hands-off and seemed preoccupied with another event going on downstairs. Great if you want to be left alone to pig out, but not so great if you need guidance on where to start. Personally, I was confused as hell but our server explained everything to us once he did come over.  The meat - moist, tender, fatty, melts in mouth, would do it again and again. Favorite sides are - beans and chili. Mac n cheese is all right. Happy hour is so worth it - one shot & a large Pabst can for $5!!",,,1

93,Autumn B.,"Floral Park, NY",0,1,0,2.0,9/24/2018,"Not what it used to be. Hill Country used to be my go-to place. I've been coming here for at least 10 years. The food was always consistently amazing and the service was great. I started to see a decline in the service the last few times I've gone, but I dealt with it because the food was so good.  However, I came in this past Saturday afternoon with my family and was very disappointed. The woman who served the meat was very unpleasant. She didn't speak to me but sort of grunted instead. She left my ribs sitting on the scale and walked away.  I assumed she was going to get a tray. When she returned several minutes later she glared at me and walked away again. I had to ask someone else behind the counter if they could take the food off the scale and get a tray for me. When I went to the side dish section I got the same treatment. A woman placed someone else's food on my tray and walked away without speaking to me. I gave the other customer their food and patiently waited. Eventually a different woman helped me but also without speaking to me.  There were no forks in the utensil section and when we asked for some we were met with looks of disdain and were told there were no forks. My daughter ordered a salad so eating a salad without a fork is not really an option. When we finally sat down to eat my husband noticed there was a tray of forks on the table behind us so he took three for us. The waitress comes flying over and very loudly exclaimed ""you're stealing my forks""!!  Afterwards, we didn't see her again until it was time for the bill. I'm sad to say the food was not good this time either. The ribs were cold and not seasoned well, the sides were room temperature, and the drinks were not even made well (a mixed cocktail with no ice?). My daughter did enjoy the salad though. I hope Hill Country can get back to what they used to be...a friendly Texas bbq spot with a fun atmosphere and delicious food. I'll be taking a break from them for awhile though. Hopefully they will get some new employees who are not miserable and rude.",,,

He handed me everything not by the handles...so I actually cut my finger because I didn't realize he'd hand me a knife serrated blades first... The moist brisket was great although extremely fatty.

I was quite pleasantly surprised I have to say!The moist brisket was the best thing I had. Fatty, but not too much, and not too many burned parts on the meat, perfect for making sandwhiches. The jalapeno sausage was also as spicy as it touted, but slightly dry. Pork ribs were great as well with the meat being very tender and coming off the bone very easily. Mac & cheese was great and my favorite side. The potatoes on the other hand were somewhat odd with saurkraut, but the corn caserrole was good if that's your type of thing.While the happy hour was fantastic with the cheap food and $5 drinks, the liquor selection itself left something to be desired. We tried getting the bartender to make us a few different drinks, but each request was denied since they didn't have the liquor we were asking for. They weren't complicated drinks (i.e. Irish car bombs, Butter Nipple, etc.) either, so it was somewhat disappointing. The live music was also supposed to start at 9, but was closer to 9:30.

Why did they go for this setup? It would be much more enjoyable if you could order from the waiter. That said, the food was delicious and was kind of worth the wait. Maybe it'll be a place to go once a year or so. If you decide to go, make sure you put enough bbq sauce on your food, it's truly delicious!

Updated review","I have a lot of fun every time I go to HCBM, and these last couple times were no exception. Even Pete Wells gave it two stars: ( nytimes.com/2012/07/04/d… )One of the last times I visited: showed up at 8:30 PM on a Friday, which is probably a little later than you want to show up, because the line was pretty long. Even though we were seated in about 15 minutes, you still have to line up a second time to get your food from the counter. I'd recommend you try to get a seat somewhere near the back.I got the brisket and pork loin as part of the 2 meat 2 sides combo. For your two meats, they give you 1/3 pound of each of the meat you choose. The pork loin was good, but nothing special and a little dry (nothing copious amounts of BBQ sauce won't fix). Next time, I'll probably wind up getting double MOIST brisket, since this simply cannot be beat. I also tried my friends sausage and pulled pork. The pulled pork is a little dry and while fine, I wouldn't recommend it. Sausage is great and has a real smokey flavor, and was probably the second best, but also cannot beat the brisket.I tried some new sides this time around, the hot potatoes, the sweet potatoes and the collard greens. Holy lord, the sweet potatoes are amazing. There's obviously so much sugar in them, but they are definitely the best side. I never like collard greens because they're sour and underwhelming, but I get them every time because I feel like I need to balance my meal out if only a little bit. However, I'm gonna stop doing this because it's futile. The hot potatoes were fine. Oh, the root beer is okay here. Another option that you may want to consider is getting the three meats set to share with another person. It's definitely enough food (so long as you're not starving or something) and drives the price down from $20~ per person (assuming you each get the 2 meats set) to about $13~ per person (the three meat set is $26 dollars). Throw in some white bread, the two sides, and it's honestly enough foodOverall, coming here will be a little bit more expensive than your run of the mill casual restaurant, but if you order strategically, and given the fact that great BBQ is just so uncommon in New York, and coupled with the super fun ambiance of this place, and the fact that there is free live music, HCBM is too much fun to pass up. I like Mighty Quinns, and dinosaur is okay too, but they're not as good as this place.",2,,3
105,Christopher B.,"New York, NY",0,26,0,2.0,10/16/2017,"This is truly not worth the time or the aggravation. We showed up on a Sunday at 5:30 without a reservation. The hostess was probably the surliest I have ever encountered in New York City. We were shown to a table that had not yet been bussed and told to wait. More like the hostility business than the hospitality business. We almost walked out then and there, and that treatment alone is reason never to return. Completely unacceptable. What possesses companies to hire people who seem so resentful of their customers always boggles my mind. Who needs this?Our waiter, however, was friendly and apologetic. The people behind the counters were very congenial. The food, however, is only passable and pricey for what it was. The Hot Link Sausage is completely devoid of flavor. The chicken was overcooked and dry. Collards are good, if not noteworthy. The gimmick is that everything is served on paper and in paper cups. Not very easy to eat.The crowd was a noisy mix of drunken people and families with children. Interesting.I've gone back to places with average food in the past, but I will not return here. Over-priced, mediocrity served with a resentful attitude isn't what I go out for. Skip this place and find BBQ where your business is appreciated.",1,,

The brisket was so tender and flavorful that was my favorite, I wasn't a Hugh fan of the other meats on the platter, the ribs weren't tender and didn't have a lot of flavor and I got tired of the sausage very quickly after a few bites.

There's better barbecue in Brooklyn of course, but for those who must remain on the island, it's a great option. It's Texas-style barbecue. Get the moist brisket and the burnt ends, they're the best thing on the menu. You will be tempted to over-order. I really recommend you not try to eat more than a half pound of meat in one sitting, despite the temptation. It's better to get several cuts and share. The sides are all pretty average, come here for the meat. If you've got vegetarians with you, they are gonna have a bad time.",,,

Updated review","If you are familiar with and love southern pit-smoked barbeque that falls from the ribs as you pick up the bone, stay away from this place. This is not the pit-smoked St. Louis or southern style barbeque ribs that you'd enjoy in Big Mama's back yard with drinks, while everyone is dancing to ""Before I Let Go"" by Maze. It is a big, overpriced disappointment. I decided to check it out after seeing the bald-headed guy from The Chew profile it on the Food Network.  Now I'm looking at The Chew with a side-eye.

111,Edward C.,"Matawan, NJ",152,324,1298,3.0,4/1/2016,"Not doing my annual Texas trip this year resulted in some serious BBQ withdrawal, so I made a decision to try Hill Country BBQ with my sister as we were in the City to visit the NY Auto Show.Let's just get to the food first.I ordered half pound of the moist brisket and a half pound of the beef shoulder clod.Moist brisket lived up to it's name as it was super moist with the all that tasty beef fat having been rendered. However, I found it a bit too moist to the point of making the brisket soft. I literally could not pick up a slice without it breaking apart. In addition, I found the level of smoke pretty mild and the bark of the brisket a bit tame.Beef shoulder clod was a new taste for me as it's not a common cut of meat except for the famous Kruez market in Texas. It was quite tasty with a nice assertive bark of salty and peppery flavor which is just pure Texas. The beef itself was quite lean and in turn not the most tender of bites, but I went in kind of expecting a decent bite and chew so it was fine for me.Sister had the ""BRC"" special platter which consists of 1/4 lb. of brisket, 1/4 lb. BBQ chicken, one pork spare rib, one side, and cornbread.The lean brisket which was okay. Presumably being from the flat section of the brisket, the piece I sampled was okay, but like my moist brisket, I found the level of smoke mild and the bark just adequate.BBQ Chicken was really excellent. The meat was still very moist and had a really nice sweetness to it. The chicken skin also had a nice little snap crisp texture. Really difficult to get proper BBQ chicken but Hill Country delivered. BBQ Pork Sparerib was pretty sad. The meat was underseasoned and the meat was not tender. Yes ""proper"" BBQ pork ribs aren't totally bite through; having some slight tug, but the sparerib was plain chewy and needed a nice pull to get it off the bone. This was disappointing. Collard green side and cornbread were good but nothing special as you don't come to a BBQ joint to eat sides.We also shared an 8oz. Confetti Coleslaw which was just alright.I was not very fond of Hill Country's ordering system that consists of small menu cards  which you review and line up first at the meat counter where they cut and weigh your meat choice(s) and then proceed to the sides area. At each stop they stamp you selections with a sticker with the price(s). I think the system created some unnecessary confusion and added to the queue of confused patrons.Lastly, what really irked  me was the layout of the tables, particularly where we were seated. The ordering line runs right through the middle of the restaurant, bisecting the main seating area. Our table was near the ordering line so people that needed to get to the tables besides us were constantly walking behind my sister's seat (being the easiest route, despite being very narrow) requiring her to pause whenever somebody walked by in case any food would drop or just in case somebody would bump into her chair.Hill Country is alright BBQ, but IMO, not on the level of either Fette Sau (still my NY BBQ favorite) and Mighty Quinn's.Sorry for the substandard photos as I left my personal cell phone and had to rely on my work cell phone camera :(.",5,2,1

120,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",465,862,4808,4.0,2/2/2016,"The bbq is okay, but the sides are where it's at. That corn pudding!!! And that mac and cheese!!! The place is popular even on a Monday night, but there was no live band the day we went. For 3 people, we ordered The Pitmaster special which came with 1/4 lb Brisket, 1 Pork Spare Rib, 1 HC Hot Link, 1/4 Chicken and 2 Sides. We also ordered an extra 1/2 pound of moist brisket, 1/2 pound pork ribs, and collard greens side. The three of us couldn't even finish all of this. On Mondays you have AYCE bbq and sides for $32/person. The waitress might tell you otherwise, but the food is so heavy I think it's more worth it to order individually. Unless you're some kind of competitive eater or something.The moist brisket was super fatty, almost too fatty for my taste, and melt in your mouth. If you want something more meaty go for the lean. The HC hot link sausage is a standard spicy sausage. Crisp casing and spicy, juicy meat. All around good sausage. The pork ribs were dry. I'd skip ordering those. I was most surprised by the surprisingly good chicken. It looks dry, but is actually quite juicy. In terms of meat, definitely order the moist brisket if you like fat, market chicken, and hot link sausage.The meat was decent, but oh man I really loved those sides. Make sure you get a side of the delicious White Shoepeg Corn Pudding. It's more similar to a creamed corn casserole than cornbread due to the creamy texture. They must have put a lot of butter in their to make it taste so good. Logical second choice is the Longhorn Cheddar Mac & Cheese. I had to control myself from not eating the entire thing because we were sharing. The collard greens were kind of lackluster compared to the first two sides, but it's nice to get some greens in your diet along with all that fat and protein.====================================Update on 3/14/16I came back a second time for the Pitmaster special again. The mac and cheese was just as ridiciously good as the first time. This time we also got the Campfire Baked Beans w/ Burnt Ends and a side of cornbread. Definitely get the beans with the burnt ends instead of the regular pinto beans for some delicious meatiness and sweetness. The cornbread was a muffin instead of a skillet cornbread but it was moist and tasted great with the ancho honey butter. Love their sides so much.",8,2,7

If you include the visits to the Brooklyn location, that would make it 5 in total.  I try not to keep going back to the same place and try a bunch of different restaurants, but the food here is top notch. Each time I come in, I always split the Pitmaster. I think it gives a good sampling of what they have to offer. Now my one complaint would be the service. I had a major issue with the seating, We were just a party of two, so it shouldn't be a problem when it comes to seating. However, I guess there were a lot of reservations that night. The waiter insisted on clustering all the early diners in a very tight space. We were being led to sit right between other parties. Although it was technically a separate table, it was pushed right next the other tables. We were all sitting on top of each other. We made a few requests to be seated elsewhere, but he wouldn't budge. So I guess the next time  I will try at an off peak period or stick to the Brooklyn location, which has a lot more room.",2,2,2
127,Alan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,681,3400,4.0,2/2/2016,"Hill Country Barbecue Market is a real hit for me. I think they serve some really good barbecue food. The environment is very classic southern like. They even play some live country style music during happy hours, which is neat. Keep you entertain while you eat. Ordering food is different here than other restaurants. You take your little menu they give to you, take it to the barbecue stations, order your food, and then they will mark off what you got on your menu. The total will be added at the end. My girlfriend ordered the brisket combination. I ordered the brisket, chicken, and ribs combination. Both combos come with a side of cornbread and one side. My girlfriend got the side of sweet potato bourbon mash. I got the Green Bean Onion Casserole. The Sweet Potato Bourbon Mash was creamy and sweet, but with a good kick of bourbon in there. The Cole Slaw ain't a bad either. The Green Bean Onion Casserole was BANGIN'. That was so delicious. Great taste and flavor. Definitely get it. The Brisket, Chicken, and Ribs were all smokey, juicy, succulent, and very tasty. All that food and we had no more room for dessert.",2,,

The brisket was moist, soft and had just enough fat. Their mac & cheese was pretty standard. Overall, this was a solid meal and I can't complain. They gave me 2 mini-muffin sized corn bread.

Perfect brisket- both lean and moist- and ribs that call to you. I've even sampled the turkey and it was one of the best birds I've tried. The sides are just as good as the meats. Try the Cool as a Cucumber salad. It's the perfect acidic accompaniment to all that meat. The corn pudding is another favorite.

Hill Country Barbecue has some of the best barbecue I've had this side of the Mason-Dixon, now that's not to say I haven't had better, I truly have. Nevertheless Hill Country is a great place and a staple of Midtown. Little to my surprise, on Mondays Hill Country has all-you-can-eat which includes delectable brisket, pork ribs, chicken and a few sides that were not exactly specified. Everything was absolutely delicious from the moment you touched my lips, till the moment it exploded out of them.

The ribs did not even have much meat on them. Complete rip off. The Brisket was very tough and fatty. Which is okay, because I can understand if the food quality misses the mark for me subjectively, but being ripped off and paying $22.00 for three ribs is not acceptable Objectively. $22.00 gets you a rack of ribs at Mighty Quinns, and/or any competitor barbecue restaurant in the city.

Brisket - was average, not too much flavor, if I had to rank the three, it was best of the other choices. Chicken - they added this very sweet glaze to it and I felt the reason the sauce was there was to mask the actual taste of the smoked chicken. Would be better if they used a milder sauce. Spare ribs - completely overcooked and spicy. I would definitely avoid this as it is definitely not worth it. Also very tough, not how it should be if it had been in the BBQ for hours.

It's like gourmet fast food bbq. The hot links are the best in town. The spare ribs were ok. They were a little burned with very little salvageable meat. The moist brisket was delicious. The Chicken and pulled pork were some of the best. Use the BBQ sauce and hot sauce with those two and your taste buds will thank you. The sides are delicious. Perfect mac n cheese.

To sit at an ""official"" table it was a 45 min wait but if you wanted to grab a seat at the bar, bar top tables or general picnic-type tables near the bar, you could be seated immediately. You will need to sled-serve in this area. Ordered a 1/2 lb of ribs and 1/2 lb of brisket with cornbread, mac and cheese, and coleslaw side-dishes. The meat was alright. Mac and cheese was good but not outstanding. I was disappointed with the cornbread. I love cornbread and know how good it can be and  this wasn't it. Also, it is supposed to come with honey butter and it only came with a regular packet of butter. If you have a large group, this place can accommodate and they have some live music performances if you want some entertainment with your meal. Atmosphere is causal and comfortable. Hostess was friendly and helpful.",,,
157,Que B.,"Queens, NY",0,10,12,4.0,8/8/2016,"I had a great first experience here. The food was great... probably not the best BBQ in New York, but it was really good. I had the BBQ wings, which were better than both of the sides I had (potato salad & collard greens). In my experience, I've found that most places fail to master both meats and side dishes. I think that this is a place you come to for the array of barbecued meats on the menu - the sides are secondary.The thing that I most love about this place is the atmosphere and overall vibe. It didn't even feel like I was in NYC. They really captured some key aspects of the midwestern/southern dining experience.",2,,

159,Catherine R.,"Cedar Park, TX",196,48,11,4.0,5/7/2017,"The BBQ at Hill Country is the bomb! My husband and I are BBQ enthusiasts and make it a point to check out different spots on a quest to find the one.First thing that's different about Hill Country is its marketplace setup. You're handed a meal card at reception and brought to a table. Here's where it fell apart for us a bit. When we got to our table there was no instruction on what you were supposed to do. There was a line leading up to a counter to get meats/sides but no one told us if were supposed to wait for our waiter then go or if we could just go ourselves. We asked the couple next to us who was just as confused. We waited for our waiter who took about 5 minutes to get to us who told us to go get in line. So we wasted valuable time waiting for the waiter which was annoying. The line to get food wasn't too too bad but it still took awhile to get anything. My husband and I both went with the ""Cue and 2"" meal which allows you to pick two meats and two sides. We both got double brisket. I love my meat moist and he loves it lean. Both were really really good. My brisket was nice and moist and just melted in my mouth. Also really loved their Mac and Cheese and Sweet Potato Mash.So overall the food was top notch and was super amazing!! The service was a little spotty and left a bit to be desired. With a setup like this it would be nice to give a bit more instruction from reception especially for first timers.",,1,1
160,Alexander W.,"Manhattan, NY",566,623,1221,4.0,8/7/2015,"One of my biggest fears in life is bad barbecue. There are an abundance of places in this country where my anxiety is realized. Thank goodness for Hill Country Barbecue NY. Walking in and seeing the beautiful reddish butcher paper is a welcome sign. A Texan is at home.I ordered the Butcher's pick with brisket moist (hot side) with a side of Longhorn (HOOK 'EM) Cheddar Mac & Cheese, and two flaky pieces of cornbread. The brisket was tender, had good bark, and a smokey the bear flavor. The Kreuz's jalapeno cheese link sausage is famous and does not need to be described any further. White bread is free on request.The dining process is as follows: 1. Get a meal ticket (and seating information?) from the hostess  2. Order your meats (or combo) from the butcher. 3. Receive the sides from the Sides & Trimmings station. 4. Find your seats and order drinks from your waitress. 5. Eat, drink, and be merry. 6. Pay after your meal is finished.Although the 'cue is not up to par with the hallowed BBQ markets in Austin, Lockhart, or Killen's in Houston, it hits the spot. I will be back.",1,,2

163,Andrew Y.,"Princeton, NJ",9,72,1,2.0,11/11/2017,"I'll admit I have high standards for BBQ. I've been spoiled by Texas BBQ for a long time now and was excited to try this place out since they were boasting lots of Texas menu items. We came with a party of 9, the service was incredibly slow and disorganized. Drink orders forgotten, mischarges everywhere, overall an extremely painful experience to pay the bill. Onto the food, we did it family style and shared items and sides with the table. The pulled pork was of questionable cut and the jalapeño cheddar sausage tasted old and was dry. Brisket was okay. The sides were fine but nothing special. Ended up being around $80 a person which seems crazy considering the quality of the food and amount of food for the price. I hope this was just an off night for them but I won't be returning. There are other BBQ joints in the area with better quality ingredients. Good BBQ doesn't need to be masked with sauce, yet I found myself reaching for the sauce quite a bit.",,,

To be honest, the Kreuz Market in Lockhart is very mediocre barbecue, just like this place.My main problem as others have stated here is the lack of smoke and the flavors from the rub. A good rib should be plastered with rub and a good brisket should have a thick smoke ring around it.I did enjoy the link and the chicken was not bad either.

Jackhammering is quieter.  The food is ""eh, ok"" and definitely not worth it given the music level.  Not a place for groups because conversation is impossible.

169,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10944,4.0,5/27/2015,"I can't believe that I haven't written a review for the original Hill Country bbq spot yet. I've been here a number of times pre my Yelping Yelp days. For a hot minute my buddy Stephanie P. would host her birthday here almost every year. Which is actually smart since your bill is always tabulated separately on little score cards for what meats and sides you order. Each personalized score card makes you pay up at the register - so no squabbles over which one of you didn't tip enough. Drinks are medium priced. Mason jar cocktails, Lone Star, pbr. I was shocked when I came in here like two weeks ago and they had one of my most favorite beers ever on tap - Birthday Shiner beer! It tastes like birthday cake and chocolate and love. For food this time around I had just had a side of their macaroni and cheese. It's penne style with copious amounts of white cheddar in a thick creamy sauce. Not my favorite ever because it can get dry, but its a solid mac. I've had their brisket before and its pretty darn good. Close to being one of the best. I've also had their jalapeno cheese sausage, campfire baked beans, and sweet potato bourbon mash. All really good food though I don't understand the insane waits to get in now. Years ago it wasn't nearly as bad of a wait. Now - 1-2 hours for a table on even weeknights. We had our drunk night food the other week up near the bar, which is another option if you are in a small group. They have an all you can eat Monday night special that I've never partaken in (yet) for $32 (it used to be $25). They also have live music on certain nights and happy hour pretty much every day with marked down drinks until 7pm. I think its definitely one of the better bbqs in New York. Its no frills and just tasty.",3,,

Updated review","Second visit to Hill Country BBQ Market was very good on Jan 5, 2018.    Freezing outside but warm and smoky inside (if not sitting by the window or door), that's a good thing.  Bought a guest with me who enjoyed the food.  Ordered burnt ends, pork belly, brisket (moist and lean), ribs (so-so), Kreuz sausage, sweet potato mash, beans, mac and cheese, collards and coleslaw. Total food was 3 separate meals, called the Pitmaster Special, 3 meats with the 2 small sides & cornbread.   Asked for samples of the potato salad and chicken salad.  OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!  ***Oh yes I Did.  Asked for a nice container of the hooked-up chicken salad to go along with my leftovers.  Delicious everything!  Will be back soon.  Now I have to finish the leftovers.",,,

They have live music and great service. Everything is always neat and clean.They have very good brisket, and their market chicken is some of the best chicken I've ever had. They used to have these beef ribs, but it doesn't seem they serve it anymore, or they're just always sold out by the time I get there.They also make a mean lemonade :) I know that's not a high priority at a BBQ joint. Coming by for lunch is also awesome. It's very quiet and it's like you have the whole restaurant to yourself. Great time to read a book :) Anyway, go. Try it. I don't think you'll regret it.",,,
175,Bin L.,"East Elmhurst, NY",33,377,24,5.0,9/7/2016,"Came here for lunch at around 12:25 pm. When I entered, they have a host in front of the dining area. I told her that I have a reservation for today. She then gave me a food ticket.I started my order by standing up in the line. Ordering the slices of meat was a time-consuming process. Waiting on the line can take a while. When I was up, I told the server that I want a quarter pound of moist brisket, a quarter pound of pulled pork, a quarter of pork loin, and a quarter pound of shoulder clod. The server gave me a bit more than I expected, so I told him to cut it off.After ordering the cuts, I ordered a side of sweet potato bourbon mash and a side of Hoppin' John's rice.When I sat down to eat, the waiters asked me if I wanted anything else. I said that everything is fine. When I opened the packet of meat, the pound of it was a lot for lunch. After eating the lunch, I felt full.When I left the dining area, I gave the food ticket to the host. The bill came to 65 cents shy of $35. The food was a bit expensive, but it was delicious.",,,

177,Ande L.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,22,8,2.0,2/19/2018,"Today I tried the pitmaster, which included brisket, chicken, sausage and burnt ends instead of pork ribs since they ran out. It included two sides (Mac and cheese and baked beans), cornbread and deviled eggs. There was a significant wait to order, which gave me hope that this would be the best bbq I have ever had...... Sadly, this is not the best bbq, like a lot of others have stated. There is some Smokey flavor but the brisket and burnt ends are extremely salty, that I am going to have to down 20 glasses of water a day for a week to detox from salt. The sausage was just ok and the chicken was moist and Smokey but didn't taste good. I can't say much about the Mac and cheese since it was over cooked and lacked much flavor, the baked beans were ok.... cornbread was lackluster.... the deviled egg was just ok as well. The service was at least excellent, well once I was finally served..... my search for good bbq in NY is still ongoing......

180,Ricky O.,"New York, NY",398,122,286,5.0,4/2/2016,"I absolutely love this place!!! Hill Country is one of those ""staple"" places that you're proud to bring your friends, out-of-towners, and BBQ aficionados to. Every time I go I'm blown away by the food, service, and the experience. It's just ""one of those places.""Here's what I love about this place:1. FOOD!!!! The moist brisket is by far the BEST I've ever had! I've had great BBQ in Texas, Atlanta, and I now live in SC by the critically acclaimed Smokin' Pig - and the moist brisket at Hill Country outperforms them all! The brisket is cotton candy-like, melting in your mouth and falling apart at the touch of the fork. The dry rub creates a perfect crust & crunch on the exterior of the brisket in the smoker, and it provides a great peppery flavor. Once you take that bite of brisket though!!! Oh my god! There's nothing better!! It's so tender and so rich offering the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and salty. If you can't tell, I absolutely love the brisket, but the ribs and the pulled pork are also killer! The sides are made fresh daily and my personal favorites are the Mac & Cheese, turnip greens w/ bacon, green bean casserole, and the German potatoes. The meat is ordered by the pound (usually  1/2-¾ pounds along with 1-2 sides is enough for 1 person, but I tend to go with a little more because it's that good!), and the sides are ordered separately, but you can always go back for more.2. EXPERIENCE - At Hill Country you walk up to the butcher counter to order your meat(s) and right before your very eyes, the butcher pulls the meat out of the smoker or the warmer and chops it right there in front of you! This means you're not getting BBQ that was sitting around for several hours, or even a day, and they're guaranteeing you the freshest quality possible. At a separate counter, you can order your side items as well as salad and other items. The restaurant reminds you of something you would see and experience in the heart of Texas, and on many nights they have live, quality music.3. SERVICE - To top it all off, Hill Country has exceptional service and they really care about our experience. For instance, this last time I was there (3/30/16) our server felt that the service she was providing was ""slow"" (to my party we thought she was going great) so she offered dessert on the house as an apology. That type of service going above & beyond is what sets this place apart.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in NYC, YOU HAVE TO GO to Hill Country and experience it for yourself!!",2,1,2
181,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,2.0,3/29/2015,Visited this location on a Saturday around 8pm.  Spoke with the hostess and she asked how many people in my party and I told her only 2. She informed me a hour and a half wait.  She explained to me food is served market style.....basically cafeteria style.  I was trying to wrap my mind around the hour and a half wait for food that is already prepared. We sat at the bar until it was time to be seated.  The bartender was a super sweetheart.  We ordered some drinks until it was time to be seated.  We also ordered queso & chips.  Queso was mediocre and nothing to rave about.  Their homemade tortilla chips were just too thick .A hour and a half later we are seated at a table to only to wait in another line to get our food. My husband got ribs and brisket.  I got a chopped brisket sandwich and potato salad.  The brisket my husband got was too salty.  The ribs were salty too but not as salty the brisket. My brisket sandwich was extremely dry and salty.  I even put bbq sauce on.  The potato salad was great! We sat and ate for about 30 minutes and asked for to go bags.   I was not impressed with the food at all.  I love BBQ and the food and dining experience overall did nothing for me. If you are from the south or the Midwest you know good bbq and this was a let down . I am on the verge of giving up on BBQ in NycThey do have an awesome happy hour.,3,,

I had the ""Cue + 2"" special, which was $23 for 2 meats and 2 small sides and corn bread (there is also a 3 meat option for $27). The moist brisket was absolutely delicious and so were the pork spare ribs. I ordered sides of green bean casserole and collard greens - both were yummy but the portions were very small. The corn bread was alright, nothing special.  The BBQ sauce was great but there was only one kind I wish there were more options (a tangy sauce and a spicy sauce at least).

Amazing brisket, smoked turkey, and ribs.  And all the sides are temptation hidden within a little paper cup.  Some of the best Mac and Cheese you'll encounter in NYC, I guarantee you. Go easy when ordering, though.  You rack up a hefty bill in no time at all.  Especially since meat is priced by the half pound.

191,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,1059,8595,4.0,4/13/2015,"LOVE...THIS...PLACE! I've been to many barbeque restaurants in NYC, but somehow Hill Country managed to elude me all of this time...until a recent Friday evening. I made reservations for 8:30pm, but arrived at 8:15pm and the host had no problem seating my girlfriend and I asap. The restaurant is huge, with 2 full floors of seating. Being that it was a Friday evening, it was very crowded inside, so be sure to make reservations. I'm not sure if we would've just been seated without the reservation, but it's better to be safe than sorry considering the huge crowds.First, the service was great! Our waitress was very accommodating by explaining to us the way the ordering system worked. You decide what you want and then get on the line, order your food, let the employee mark your card and that's it! When you're ready to pay, the waitress will just take your card at the end of the night.As for the food, one word --- AWESOME! It definitely met my expectations of what I was expecting since I heard so many great things in the past about Hill Country. We ordered the The Pitmaster Special, which came with ¼ lb. Brisket, 1 Pork Spare Rib, 1 HC Hot Link, ¼ Chicken and 2 Good Eatin' Sides (Longhorn Cheddar Mac & Cheese, Green Bean Casserole with Durkee Onions). In addition, we decided to throw in 3 more Good Eatin' Sides (Collard Greens with Applewood Smoked Bacon, Confetti Cole Slaw, Campfire Baked Beans with Burnt Ends). Here's my quick thoughts on some observations I had on specific items we ordered:Brisket - Unfortunately, they ran out of the moist brisket, so we had to get the lean brisket. The texture on the brisket was good, but since it was lean, it was a bit dry so we had to counter that by dipping it in BBQ sauce.Longhorn Cheddar Mac & Cheese - Strangely, I've never seen Penne used for Mac & Cheese.! It wasn't the moist kind of cheddar mac & cheese though, but rather the dryer version where the mac pieces stick together. I'm someone who prefers the moist version, but nonetheless it was still good!Green Bean Casserole with Durkee Onions - My favorite side of the night! I absolutely recommend this if you're a fan of casseroles because it truly tasted like one! Tons of flavors were partying in my mouth with every bite. Confetti Cole Slaw - My girlfriend made a bold statement and stated that this was the BEST cole slaw she ever had in her life. Most cole slaws usually have a sour taste to them, but this one had a touch of sweetness to it. To me, this cole slaw was really good, but I'm more in favor of the sour cole slaws.Other than those observations, the other sides were pretty much what we expected. They didn't blow us away, but they were solid. To be honest, there was nothing I did not like all evening about the restaurant. The atmosphere was perfect, not too loud, but there was plenty of chatter all around. The one gripe I did have was that there was no pulled pork on the menu! However, that didn't affect my opinion of Hill Country much as the food was still really good!",1,1,
192,Mason G.,"Long Beach, NY",92,68,19,4.0,1/31/2017,"Ordering is a little tricky and confusing at first, but makes sense in the end. Try not to over order as you can always go back. I recommend the wings, Burt ends and the moist brisket. The ribs are just okay. Great sides to choose from but nothing that blew me away. Save some room for dessert, the banana pudding is a ""MUST""!",1,1,
193,Joe Q.,"Westville, NJ",15,4,0,3.0,5/6/2018,"Food and service was good but was shocked at my bill. Brisket, 2 sides and 2 beers with tip for one $50.00 !!! For the same money I could have gone for more swank.",,,
194,Carol H.,"Boerum Hill, NY",246,256,63,4.0,9/14/2017,The best thing here is definitely the brisket. Super tender and juicy with just enough fattiness. Please don't get the lean brisket.. that's like asking for your milkshake to be made with skim milk. MOIST BRISKET all the way. The sides are decent but nothing to write home about. I would skip the other meats.. they're hit or miss.,,,
195,Hanane D.,"Heartland Village, Staten Island, NY",79,113,615,4.0,2/18/2017,I visited here last night (Friday night) with my friend and her parents. It was live music night. One of their family friends plays in the Nashville Attitude band. They did a great job. I enjoyed it. The place feels like you're hanging out in a honky tonk down south. An awesome vibe. The menu was very limited and especially the desserts section. I ended up getting banana pudding and they got the ice cream. They didn't have the chocolate chip cookie. Their desserts were just alright. Either way we had a nice night out and enjoyed the great country music.,,,1
196,Patrick O.,"Manhattan, NY",102,68,0,5.0,10/29/2017,Delicious. The service format is a mix of counter service and waitress service. The food is excellent and it's a laid back atmosphere.,,,
197,Patricia S.,"Daly City, CA",7,19,6,4.0,10/28/2017,"Visiting NY from SF, this place was the closest to our hotel so we went ahead for it. Meats were good, loved the brisket. They're not shy with portions either. Mac n cheese was delicious. Didn't really like the collard greens, but it was my first time trying it so it might not just be my thing. I'm giving four stars because I did not like how they only had one type of BBQ sauce. Like I was stuck to drench my meat with the sauce. It was not very good. It would be nice to have a variety of sauces to choose from.",,,
198,Joey C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,126,0,2.0,8/21/2017,"I've been here four times.   I've found that when you go all out and order a ton of food and drinks with no consideration of price, you can have a good time.   But, when you try to have some BBQ here on a budget, you'll be disappointed.    The shoulder clod I got was all gristle - they should have been embarrassed to serve this.",,1,
199,tiffany c.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",1,48,2,3.0,5/10/2018,"We ordered the special with three meats and got the brisket, pulled pork and spare ribs. Note that they don't include any types of ribs in this special which was a bit of a bummer. The brisket was really fatty, however it was sitting out for a while so the fat had already solidified and was too heavy on my palate. The pulled pork and spare ribs were a bit dry. We got two sides: corn pudding and Mac n cheese. Mac and cheese was with penne instead of macaroni. Corn pudding is alright, I've never had it prior to this so I don't have anything to compare it to. Also, they forgot to give us our cornbread.",,,
