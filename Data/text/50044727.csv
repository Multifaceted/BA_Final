You absolutely must try the WHOLE SASSO CHICKEN. They bring the full chicken out while it's still burning to show you and take it to the back to chop it up for you to serve. OCTOPUS, perfectly charred with great vegetable compliments. I can't wait to come back again. Only feedback; They need better ventilation because when they bring out the chicken the entire small restaurant gets SUPER smokey, and your eyes start to water. ENJOY!",4,3,3
1,Sabrina C.,"New York, NY",6,31,29,3.0,10/21/2018,"Worst restaurant I have ever had the misfortune of dining at. If you think this is ""French"" cuisine, you will be disappointed when you go to France. The only competent employee was the bartender, two of the stars are for him and the water closet.It took 40 minutes to get 2 canned beers from the condescending ponytailed waitress. She discriminated against my date and I by seating us in the worst area of the place. A waiter admitted to us that they just built this section. It was blatantly obvious they ran out of money and time or didn't have access to an eraser or wood stain. Cannot believe this place has a Michelin star. I have worked as a food runner, busboy, barista, bartender and host before, and have never been treated so poorly anywhere. Even McDonalds has better customer service. The 69 dollar chicken was pink and undercooked. The prawns were overdone and mediocre. I will not be returning to this overhyped hole in the wall, have already told my friends to just go anywhere else for a semi decent meal.",1,,
2,Alyssa Y.,"New York, NY",72,256,39,2.0,10/6/2018,"As a Francophile who typically fangirls out over any French new wave gimmick, Le Turtle was simply a letdown. Sad to write this since Le Turtle comes from the team behind Freemans and The Smile, both of which I quite like. Ambience: I'd heard how eccentric and fashionable the space was, but honestly it was nothing to write home about. Though the servers were a tad lackadaisical, I wouldn't say they were rude like the other Yelpers have.Food: The highlight of the famous chicken for two was its display in smoldering hay. While the skin was a nice mix of crispy and chewy, the meat was average: weirdly sweet from the brine and not enough flavor otherwise. I wish it had a smokier flavor given that it was literally just on fire! Otherwise, the other dishes were below average: fried octopus was flavorless and one-note, and the soft cheese with beet powder was straight up odd (not interesting odd, just odd). Long story short: there's a reason this place isn't even full on a Friday night...",3,2,
3,Danica D.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",1,6,1,3.0,10/2/2018,"I get that this is a French restaurant but what's with the snobby attitude from the staff? You guys ain't in France to pull off that level of sass. I was there last night with a couple of friends. I got there 2 mins late and my friends were already seated. I approached the bartender who was the only staff person I saw when I walked in. I politely asked him where they'd be seated even letting him know the person under whose name we made the reservations. He replied saying, ""Did your friends eat and leave?"". I was quite taken aback with that curt reply, and was going to give him a piece of my mind but my friends saw me and raised a hand to motion me to where they were. I noticed they seemed pissed off and on asking them what's up, I found out that the bartender along with some other waiter was rude and sassy with them too. That literally put a bad taste in our mouth even before our food arrived which was a shame since the food was pretty good. Overpriced & overhyped but good. Just wanted to add that the only person on their staff who was nice, warm and friendly was the guy who brought out the chicken. Another thing I didn't understand was why would they give us a table at 9.30pm when they shut at 10pm on Mondays? We felt rushed to be honest. They let us sit till 11pm but not before interrupting 2-3 times asking if we were done, and eventually making loud noises while clearing the space so that we'd get the message and leave.Would only recommend this place for the food, and only if you have that kind of money to spend.",1,,

We opt for a cabernet to accompany the meal.  Our server let us try a couple other wines before sealing the deal on this one.  This is a true neighborhood gem that I can't wait to revisit!!",1,,1
7,Sara M.,"Chicago, IL",166,221,93,3.0,4/24/2018,"For me this must of been the weekend of bad service. On saturday night 8:30pm reservation arrived seated right away, waiter came over we asked for tap water. It literally took forever to get our initial water, like past 15 min of sitting down. Then throughout the entire meal, we had to consistently ask for water, as they would not leave a bottle on the table. the waiter took our order than did not check on us that much, to the point we had to ask other waiters or the bar to give us water. I get thirsty when I eat sorry. The food overall was fine, visually pleasing but taste wise, I really wasn't that impressed. I know this restaurant is very trendy right now, but the best thing from the whole menu was very specifically the pancetta in the carbonara. Unfortunately there was like five tiny pieces in the carbonara. Moving along, otherwise we had the scallops (meh), the Sweet potato (its fine), the Cauliflower (eh), and the cheese (good), beef and uni (good). Honestly it's tapas, with the intent of you ordering chicken or the steak to share, otherwise if people don't want either of those things, Its not really worth a visit. Just keep that in mind, we went and got pizza after.",2,,
8,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1672,521,984,4.0,9/6/2017,"Love the space, ambience, service and food. Bread was super crusty with very little chewy center. Some people like the soft center of artisan bread- I like the crust more. Here, it's all crust. Served with 2 types of butter... I was not fond of either. Bread can and will stand alone.More of the delicious pine nut dark loaf came with our meats. A chorizo salumi that had our companions whip out their phones to google exactly what it was, it was so good. They were the thinnest slivers of light pepperoni with bit of red pepper oil and nuts. The saucisson was a first and delight for me. I am definitely going to berepeat offender in this category. The 2 types of procuitto- knuckle being the leaner, succinct and porky flavor while the loin was supple, melty and buttery. Each were deliciously subtle and gobbled up as fast as polite people would. The scallop dish was a double edge sword. So small yet beautifully plated with very interesting components and flavors. They were small but seared perfectly and paired with goat cheese, espuma, grapes, toasted oatmeal and micro greens. And a gelatin swirly on top- whatever that was... it was pretty. We enjoyed it but almost seemed too much fanfare for really 1 bite. The chicken. Oh sasso chicken... they brought u out in a big display of campfire that we all just looked on in curiosity and cut u up for us to enjoy. It was good- great even. Moist, flavored well (a Teensy bit under if u asked me)... and tender. It wasn't a lot for 4 and the side was sparing but the Asian carrot spinach medley was tangy and paired well. All in all sasso chicken is a bit of a hype and oversell. Then again, it's better than ""the best ever chicken"" at Nomad. Hmmm... 3rd time's the charm? I think I will stick with pricey Red meat from now on.",4,,
9,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",773,173,56,3.0,1/23/2018,"3.5 stars. I wanted to give this place a 4, but there were just a couple odd things that made the night less than a 4.Le Turtle has some hip vibes and some great food to match. Definitely on the pricier side for dinner (~$17 cocktails, $20-25 tapas) but was very delicious. Our server recommended 2-3 tapas per person, and if we got the big entree dishes, to still get 2 tapas per person; however, we found that to be a LOT of food -- definitely more than necessary. Despite us seeming very skeptical about needing that much food, our server INSISTED that we needed to order more because we didn't have enough. I'd say that if you're starving, perhaps; otherwise, one of the big dishes + 1 tapa per person would be more than enough food. My group of 3 had the ends meat, broccolini, sunchoke, and whole sasso chicken. The ends meat came with 3 kinds of meats with bread, 2 of which were fantastic but 1 of which was basically all fat... That was definitely a bit disappointing, as we didn't touch that meat at all. The sun choke and broccolini were both delicious, but we particularly enjoyed the sunchoke paired with the pickled flavours of the black trumpets an sweeter melon pieces. The star of the night was definitely the whole sasso chicken though! They brought out the whole chicken with some embers still aflame next to it to show us, then brought it back to the kitchen to carve up into manageable pieces for us. This chicken is apparently brined for 2 days and cooked at 3 different temperatures, and boy does it work!! It was so flavourful and moist, and we couldn't stop ourselves from eating more despite being stuffed.The one weird thing about the chicken is that the server explained to us that they select differently sized chickens for different parties... so if you're a party of 5, you'll get a larger chicken than we got for a party of 3. That was certainly a strange thing to be told, as we essentially were paying the same price for a smaller chicken, which I don't believe to be customary in the industry.",1,2,1
10,Charlie R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,53,1,3.0,7/10/2018,"Look, this review is totally subjective. The bottom line is that the food here is good. Overall, it just isn't my vibe. I don't like small share plates/ tapas. I'm always hungry after. Any time I eat at a place like this I find a bodega/ taco truck/shake shack to get a sandwich/ taco/ burger at after. I'm fine spending $100+ each for a delicious meal, but I don't want to be hungry after. Ps. We got 2 small and 2 'large' plates between two people. I also can't stomach that a single glass of wine is $20+What also bothered me is the place smelt like incense/ burning. Not a pleasant smell and the only objectively negative thing I can say.Again, the food was tasty and the wait staff were knowledgeable and happy to recommend dishes.",1,,

I've been to 50+ NYC restaurants and  find myself wanting to go to Le Turtle again rather than try somewhere new. The best part about this restaurant is that you can taste the passion from the kitchen through their dishes. They have this ""fresh cheese"" dish on the menu where they change the accompaniments by season. Best dish I've ever had hands down. I've been to EMP, Blue Hill stone barns, chefs table at Brooklyn fare and this is the best dish I've ever had. The exec chef takes care of everyone and bounces around from table to table in the dining room, just great hospitality. A true NYC gem. Did i mention they bring a whole chicken to your table, on fire?  I just love le turtle. I haven't had a disappointing meal there yet. I will keep coming back for more!

13,Lisa D.,"New York, NY",12,326,308,5.0,1/1/2018,"My husband and I had a stellar New Year's eve meal at Le Turtle.  A day later I'm happily reminiscing on our meal, so I decided to review.  We were warmly greeted by two employees as we entered. (Hostess and I think the floor manager based on the fact he inquired on our dining pleasure mid meal).The ambiance is LES chic without trying too hard. I understand several reviews which mentioned the neighborhood place vibe. They offered an amuse bouche which I had to skip due to dairy sensitivity. Biting into the perfection of their french bread instantly reminded of bread I had in Paris years ago. That little moment of food bliss was pleasantly repeated more than a few times throughout the evening. I had fennel and endive salad to start. The roasted pineapple and toasted sunflower seeds balanced the dish perfectly. My husband enjoyed the broccoli salad. For the next course I enjoyed the hamachi tartar -divine. (I liked it even better than the hamachi at Cosme the day before - and that was excellent)  John tried the dry aged beef carpaccio which practically melted in my mouth.  We both ordered the filet for our entrees. They were perfectly prepared and excellent cuts. A generous portion of beef for both of us. I would have preferred a larger portion of veggies to balance it, but the tastes of the accompanying veggies were wonderful. Smashed purple potatoes, pickled mustard seeds, and a mushroom temptation as well. Pre dessert we were presented another amuse bouche of spoon of strawberry sorbet on a tiny almond macaron. Adorable and delicious. My dessert selection of chocolate sorbet was so creamy I inquired to make sure it was dairy free. (It was.) John and I loved the chestnut financiers with jalapeno sorbet. That flavor balancing was spot on in this dessert course as well. We both commented that we will be back to try the regular menu.",1,,1

My boyfriend and I got Cab Franc and Grenache and both were more acidic than expected.The service was just okay. It took a while to bring items requested (like ketchup) and they didn't refill our waters.We shared the following:Cheeses and meat.  We got Project X and St Stephen and both were delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed the Coppa meat.Foie Torchon. A little bland but very smooth otherwise. The bread came on the side because we noted the gluten allergy. The bread had an awesome grilled flavor. The jam was also very good.Himachi, this was not my favorite and was very fishy.  Sea bass had a nice sauce and was well cooked. The skin was crispy but a little too many scales.Steak was very salty and flavorful but extremely fatty. They also didn't ask how we wanted it prepared but luckily it was medium rare. They also messed up this order and brought the fries on the same plate instead of on the side (they're fried in the same oil so are not gluten free).Overall I just wasn't that impressed and likely won't be back.",3,2,1

We had a reservation, but that was unnecessary as there were only a couple other patrons when we arrived.First off, this space is...sceney? I don't even know how to describe it, other than it's a tad over the top and the music is pretty loud.After perusing the menu a bit, we decided to split the carpaccio, the charred broccoli salad, the scallops and the halibut.The two appetizers were decent, but nothing to write home about and were relatively small portions.Following suit, the entrees were definitely a lot better flavor-wise, but still lacked any real sustenance as they were small as well.Overall, this place is definitely unique and creates a vibey atmosphere that can add or detract from the dining experience, depending on what your preferences are. The food is good, but not amazing--and the pricing is all very high. There are some dishes here that are very good, but I'm not sure the small portions warrant the high price tags.",2,,
17,K C.,"New York, NY",6,15,1,2.0,2/2/2018,"I work at a gallery in the neighborhood and have passed Le Turtle dozens of times, so I thought I would have dinner with a friend. The decor is comfortable and cool, the small plates delicious and shareable. I enjoyed my glass of wine, a Chardonnay from Jura that was delicious. A great evening was made odd and uncomfortable by our waiter, who hovered next to us as we chatted to take our order, ask us if we wanted more drinks. He also had a weird way of trying to induce us to order more food. After placing our order of one vegetable dish and two entrees, he asked ""What's your hunger level on a scale of 1-5? Because from what you ordered it seems like a 2."" Having eaten at thousands of restaurants and being what one would call a grown up, I did not appreciate that the waiter second guessed our order, and passive-aggressively suggested that we made a bad choice. He walked away as though to say, ""You'll regret it."" Most places would simply take our order as given, and if we want more food, we can order it. Plain and simple. Instead, we were given a weird guilt trip about what we ordered, which by the way, turned out to be just enough. I overheard him tell the table next to us to order two small dishes and two large, which would have been too much. I understand that running a restaurant in New York City is not an inexpensive proposition, but unless we ask, don't tell us we are not ordering enough. We would have stayed for more drinks and dessert if we weren't so put off by the attitude. The treatment was shocking given the prices asked.",7,1,1

I loved everything about Le Turtle- the decor was comfortable, cozy and elegant, great music and most importantly the food was excellent! We shared several small plates and everything was deliciously innovative without being 'precious.' We had the beets and cheese, octopus, pork chop and rice pudding for dessert. Our server, Maddie was very sweet and attentive, and the all of the staff was knowledgeable and friendly.

21,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,4.0,12/29/2016,"Rather than being a typical French, Le Turtle in my opinion is tilting more towards New American. Food was cooked in a way that, rather presents its original flavor, brings a more sophisticated taste that easily left me with enough impression.We decided to skip all apps and small plates and went straight with the big plates for share. Let's save the energy and go directly to the most renown dish - the flaming chicken. Described as to be shared by 2, we hardly finished it among the four of us. Every piece of meat was gigantic, juicy, crispy, and very flavorful. The chicken skin was actually very similar to the famous Peking duck skin, carrying a crispy and oily texture, while not greasy at all. Other dishes were a bit of lackluster - to me, both the wagyu beef and the oxtail were over-cooked to some extent; nevertheless flavor did make it up.Their dessert menu was rather limited, and we opted for the poached pear wit yogurt. No mistake, yet not too much impression either. If one thing, the chicken! Make sure you leave enough space for it (by skipping other main courses), or prepare to suffer from food coma.",12,5,7
22,Cristina X.,"New York, NY",434,447,3554,4.0,12/29/2016,"Loved the vibe and the food: a somewhat weird and artistic twist in the dining ambiance in reflection to the nice twist to the French cuisine. While your host wears suit, all other waiters are in grey jumpers like mechanicians; while part of the dining room looks formal and upscale, another part looks like wild and there is also a hidden table in a small pink room.Came here as a group of 4 for dinner and we shared all 4 dishes in the special section (last section) of the menu.- Bread with house butters- Wild Mushrooms (Parsley root purée, grapes, lovage & perigord truffle)- Oxtail (Celery breadcrumbs, mirepoix, horseradish  & grilled narrated)- Wagyu Beef Cheek- Sasso Chicken for two (the famous roasted chicken, also ranked in the Top 10 New York dishes of 2016 by New York Times)- Poached Pear with fig and yogurtMy favorites are the bread with house butters, Wild mushrooms, wagyu beef cheeks, and the Sasso Chicken. Does a bread dish worth $6?? YES! Crunchy fragrant(sunflower seeds) bread with two kinds of house butters: fluffy aromatic butter, and thick creamy cheese-like butter.You can hardly go wrong with mushrooms and truffles! This creative dish also has refreshing ingredients like grapes and a light sweet purée. I like the interesting idea of balancing the savory mushrooms with the delightful and refreshing fruits/puree.The wagyu beef cheeks is also savory yet not overwhelming. It's so throughly cooked that the meat almost falls apart once you fork it. Excellent idea to pair this juicy and savory meat with crunchy dry bread.The chicken is excellent (worth the $$$)! A thin layer of fat under the crispy skin makes it aromatic yet still juicy! Each bite of the chicken is juicy, tender, and flavorful. None of the bite is boring or dry! The the Brussels sprouts side is excellent too--Brussels sprouts are nicely caramelized with crispy edges.Overall, highly recommend this place! Nice twists to French cuisine. I love how each dish is sophisticated yet very well balanced: savory vs sweetness, dry vs moist, perfect fat to meat ratio, and the right amount of salt in each dish. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Also like their background music. Would love to come back when they update the seasonal menu.",9,6,6

They were good .... There's a larger steak dish.  The quality of that meat was the best meat I had ever had in America , or maybe just ever.  The bread was $6 for a four inch loaf of fresh Italian.  Fine, but when your bill is $458 before tip for four people, you'd except a few comped bread orders (we ordered four bread.  That's right 6x4= 24$Petty.  That's the difference between a good and excellent waiter.   Still tipped 20% but left a little annoyed.

25,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,4.0,6/3/2017,"According to NY Eater, Le Turtle is conceptualized as some sort of tongue-in-cheek industry in-joke, where ""the act of actually eating dinner at Le Turtle is just one small component of experiencing dinner at Le Turtle"" but where the food also happens to be exceptionally good. Maybe I'm just oblivious, but I didn't really get the in-joke vibe. Sure, it's a scene, but what restaurant on the Lower East Side isn't a scene? Other than the weird, slightly elevated room that turned out a be a VIP room, the place honestly seemed pretty normal.And the food was great! We mainly came for the Sasso chicken for two, which is brined, roasted, and presented on a bed of hay to you and your dining companion (and, okay, the rest of the restaurant), the smell of a smoky campfire lazily wafting through the room. Once the chicken makes its next appearance, it's been cut up into legs, thighs, whatever elses, and the most amazing wings with this incredible salty, fatty, smoky skin. For the big chunks of white meat, there's a plate of veggies - lettuce, pickled carrots, a truly fiery jalapeño - so that you can make little chicken sandwiches with the lettuce for bread. One of the legs has a little gesticulating claw attached to it, seemingly begging, ""Don't eat me!"", but oh, it's too late, and you will. It is a delicious chicken. It is so juicy. It is full of flavors and textures. It is also $68, so I'm never going to be able to eat it again. The whole chicken preparation process takes about 20-30 minutes, so it was recommended that we start by ordering something else. The upsell worked, and we got cocktails and a meat and cheese plate. We had the lomo (like a prosciutto), St. Stephen, a mushroomy triple creme cheese, and the Shropshire blue, a neon-colored blue cheese for people who like blue cheeses. All was served with honey and a warm, supremely crusty bread.For the cocktails, we tried the tequila-based and the gin-based drinks. They were simple, refreshing, and clean-tasting.",8,3,3

28,Paris S.,"New York, NY",0,31,0,5.0,4/30/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here last weekend for an anniversary and had a great time. I've read some other reviews that service was a bit slow, and that wasn't at all the case for us (we came around 8:30 so a bit before the 9:00 rush but not at all ""early"" for dinner). The ambience was well designed but comfortable and warm--not at all a stark modern, stuffy place--and our servers were really attentive, even including a free dessert and glasses of rosé champagne for our anniversary. The place isn't cheap and to some, the food may be ""tricky"", but for a stylish, cool-but-nice venue with beautifully plated food and thoughtful, inventive flavor pairings, it was well worth it. Also, for someone who tends to eat *mostly* plant based like myself (not perfect don't come @ me vegans) it was SUCH a refreshment to have so many interesting vegetable-forward plates. We ordered:Avocado-radish salad: A new Spring menu addition; beautifully ribboned radishes with avocado ""crema"" and toasted/popped farro and grains. Really light and texturally balanced. (Not our favorite dish we ordered, but not ""bad"" at all)Cauliflower with labne, apple, and pistachio: 10/10!! One of the best dishes I've had at any restaurant  in a long time. The cauliflower was so well seasoned and the labne with it was perfect. We both agreed we could've eaten about 3 more plates of it. Arctic Char with broccoli rabe: delicious, perfectly cooked fish (medium/rare) with a crispy skin and well cooked charred broccoli rabe and some sort of harissa-like sauce. Almost as good as the cauliflower, which is saying a lot. Carbonara: My boyfriend had the carbonara and loved it--he joked he was still starving after the appetizers (the portions are me-sized, not him sized) and the pasta was very well welcomed. Le Turtle definitely makes their carbonara right (and doesn't add any cream or uncalled for ingredients)Specialty dessert: We were served some sort of chocolate sorbet with flaked sea salt and olive oil--reminded me a lot of this sundae at Bi-Rite in SF. Delicious, but not as well plated as any of the other courses.",,,

30,Akshay G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,34,2.0,1/25/2018,"To begin with the first impression was bad. We had a table for six, but the host gave us a hard time to accommodate the 7th person. I agree, our fault completely. Instead of trying to figure out a way, he decided to give a 101 on restaurant reservation. The place was empty when we arrived. Eventually they did add another table and accommodate us.Moving on. The food was only average, nothing stood out per se. The warm fresh bread was my favorite, that says a lot, I guess. The only saving grace was the desserts and cocktails, ordered all. The financier and chocolate mousse we're outstanding, rice pudding was meh. Cocktails we're pretty good, all were repeated. Special mention for the mezcal.We like to order most things to try n then repeat things that we liked. The server was adamant that we should order more as the portions were too small. Felt forced to get 2 of almost all things. Don't think I'll visit again. 2 stars for desserts n cocktails, that's it.",1,,1
31,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,5.0,8/6/2016,"Came here for a group dinner for 6, and we just shared the majority of the menu, as well as a couple bottles of wine. Gotta love it when it turns out like that. The place has an upscale feel, but even has a section that needs renovation, so it's a strange mix between casual and elevated. Also, the hosts were dressed neatly in suits, but the waitstaff was dressed in strange gray jumpsuits, similar to the outfit of an auto mechanic. I'm really not sure why that's a thing, but to each their own.What we got:- Fresh cheese with pickled ramps and spring onion- Chicken Liver Mousse- Dry-aged Beef Carpaccio with grilled batard, black lime, fennel pollen, and lovage- Heirloom Tomato salad with buttermilk & spelt crumble- Romaine Caesar salad with anchovy breadcrumb- King Crab with avocado mash and radish - Grilled Wagyu with cubanelle pepper, and kunik and peach mostarda- Scallops with nectarine, corn pudding and blue cheese- Green Vegetables (Fiddlehead ferns, broccolini, celctuce)- Sasso Chicken for Two- Mint and Chocolate sorbetsMy favorites were the carpaccio, green vegetables, scallops, and of course, the famous sasso chicken. The carpaccio was nicely sliced, and the grilled buttered crostini was perfect. The green vegetables came on a bed of aioli, which gave a nice layer of fattiness to the dish. If only all green vegetables came with that aioli. The scallops were huge and nicely seared, and the corn pudding and nectarine provided a nice amount of contrast to the rich scallops. The sasso chicken was delicious, and presentation was pretty great. Most people assume that it would just be like getting a rotisserie chicken at your local supermarket, but the chicken at Le Turtle is leaps and bounds better. The fattiness is just really well distributed, and there isn't a dry bite throughout the chicken. Sorbets were a great palate cleanser at the end of the meal.Service was for the most part, quick and efficient, although a little bit on the apathetic side, and again, I don't really get the whole jumpsuit thing, but the actual dishes just really put everything over the top. I really enjoyed my time at Le Turtle, and am really excited to try it again, with a revamped seasonal menu.",61,38,58

It's warm and inviting interior and the friendly staff has a take-your-time attitude that is hard to find in New York on a Saturday afternoon or anytime for that matter. But best of all is the food and drinks which is crafted with reverence for the highest quality ingredients. The charred broccoli salad with pickled apple, labne cheese and pistachio crumbs was carefully curated and the best salad I have had in a long time. The same goes for the heavenly mushroom risotto. The wines and the cocktails alone are worth a visit.",,,

They weren't bad by any means but just weren't all that special either. - Lobster - definitely not a huge portion but was amazing. Not too much butter. - Chicken - hands down the best chicken I've ever had. Make sure to place your order as soon as you walk in as they run out quickly and would be a shame to come here and miss out. It easily can feed three people assuming you get a few sides to shareThe waiter also comped us a microgram salad and  roasted asparagus.

36,Steve P.,"Irvington, NY",14,149,7,3.0,7/9/2017,"4 stars for the food and 1 for the service. Haven't been down to the Bowery for years and we drive past the same grungy corner twice and just could not find this place until I parked and walked over on foot and there it was nestled by some decrepit lots. Very nice elegant inside its neat tables (including one in its own alcove), brass ceiling lights, well stocked center bar and cool bathrooms lot of really good music pulsating throughout as well. The manager was kinda friendly, the bartender was way friendly but, alas, put waiter was pretty snarky and not at all friendly so that was very off putting. $7 for sparkling water which we had as every glass of wine was about $18 and every cocktail about $16 and a beer about $8 so we just split the water which was good and cold. The waiter must have said about five times that we ""really"" need to share 4 small plates (at $15 an average each) because th special chicken takes just soooo long to cook but we held our ground and had just the rawTuna with cherries (very good) and the homemade bread with 2 butters - regular and herb which as a hunk of really good homemade bread I'll admit but still paying $7 for bread was kinda wired. So about 5 minutes after finishing the appetizers out came the waiter with the flaming chicken! Long wait?! Right. Anyway the chicken was on fire and that wasPretty neat especially for a $68 chicken for two though I will say we're eating it again tonight and it was really tasty - meaty & juicy and the skin was crunchy and good. Came with lettuce to wrapThe chicken but no veggies which would have made the better accompaniment. Dessert featured cream caramel, cold, with a crunchy topping that was also super tasty. $140 with top which, while it was a freaking awesome chicken, was overall pretty expensive for a chicken dinner split between two people and without any alcohol I gotta say. I did like the food but I won't be back to Le Turtle.",4,1,

That's it, the cut of fish was 2 bites worth of food. In all we ordered 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 desserts  for two people and were still hungry after dinner. Also, the gnocchi tasted like tater-tots. The service was aloof and uninformed. A server messed up my wine order and offered to buy our dessert, which was never taken off our bill.

43,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,1053,63,4.0,12/21/2016,"Excellent gastronomic experience to be had at Le Turtle. Our party of six enjoyed every single dish which is rare for such a discriminating group. The ambiance was also quite nice for me with perfect lighting to offset the sorta weird interior design of this place. Also the Erykah Badu they were playing in the background didn't hurt. I could give this place five stars if it wasn't for their service which was absolute *rubbish*. But lets stick with the positive first- the food.What's wonderful- the bread with the escargot butter, the carpaccio (not as beefy as I'd like, but it melts in your mouth), the broccoli salad (totally special), the kohlrabi bisque (perfect in every way).What's really good- the chicken (briny perfection), the oxtail (maybe not special but done really, really well), the charcuterie and cheese (gave everything that French touch), the fresh cheese (not everyone's favorite, but for those who liked it, they really liked it).We also liked the wild mushrooms but it wasn't that memorable. And really the only dish that wasn't a success was the fig and pear dessert (maybe trying too hard). But this was offset by really good libations.Now on to the unpleasantness... the service is bad and it wasn't because of one thing in particular but just a bunch of bad things compounded on top of each other. Let's start with the 15 minute wait even when we had a reservation. Normally that would be A-OK but don't rush us out at the end (we would've been gone 15 minutes sooner if you had done your job).The worst was the waitress- didn't manage a smile the whole time. Mostly just a look of condescension when she learned that part of the group wouldn't be having drinks. The absolute worst.Drinks came out after the food even though we had ordered them way earlier (they did apologize for this).We were going family style so we needed separate bowls for the bisque. We asked the waiter and he said they didn't have bowls. Our soup came in a bowl...Can you re-position the empty chair next to us so that you can stop bumping our table every time you go by? Another look of condescension.I gave the waitress my credit card early in the night so that we wouldn't have to fight for the check. The waiter brought the check out anyway- let the fight begin.Brushed through the dessert menu (obvious they were trying to close the place and go home early) and started snatching dishes away.There were other little things but you get the point. It would be difficult for us to go back considering, but not saying you shouldn't experience their great food.",3,1,

The waiters do push you to order lots of small plates and they say, you can always pack up the chicken to go, which I thought was odd. They are definitely trying to get the bill up. This wouldn't bother me if the food was good. The lamb chops were raw and when I asked if that was normal, waiter said yes. He didn't offer to cook it more. Well, we couldn't eat it, it was like bubble gum. They did take it off our bill without asking us, which I guess was nice. I would have rather they cooked it more-because we left hungry. And the chicken was just ok. Didn't taste like much of anything to be honest. Not all of the skin was crispy and I really wished they had some kind of sauce. There wasn't much flavor. It was nice to try a new spot, but unfortunately we won't be returning.",1,1,1

46,G L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,121,38,4.0,12/11/2017,"The drinks are expensive but also delicious, especially the hot cider drink.Foie gras dish was great, loved all the flavors on the dish but the texture is more like a mousse. Broccolini salad was well seasoned and well cooked. Carpaccio was basically a prosciutto, I liked it but no one was blown away. Wouldn't order again.Cote de boeuf was really flavorful but not as juicy as I would have liked. For the price I would have wanted more.The pork belly was served with beets and was well done.Oxtail risotto was worth it and I also really enjoyed the scallop dish.Fennel dessert was interesting, not too much of a fennel taste, more chocolate mousse with the added fennel as texture. I would absolutely order the hazelnut dessert with chai ice cream again.Loved the 90's early 00's hip hop playlist :)And they have a very cute elevated booth area lit by a pink light all by itself, making it feel very private and intimate. I just wish these cool new trendy restaurants would put actual, real, freakin mirrors in the bathroom. they have what can only be described as a black ceramic glazed dish. Wth, how can I reapply my makeup or check my teeth for aliens and gristle without a proper mirror??!",1,,1
47,Carolina N.,"New York, NY",58,203,16,3.0,8/29/2016,"I have very mixed feelings about this place. I thought the food was good, but the service was very weird.As for the food, the bread with butters and the chicken were great. We also had a steak special which was delicious. They sent out a number of complimentary salads (probably because we were clearly off-put by the service) which were very good.These were the service issues:- The bartender referred to my sister and me as ""girls"" and was oddly pretentious when telling us what his favorite items on the menu were. He then asked my friend's husband if he was going to pay for all of our drinks, despite the fact that we were on separate tabs. It was generally uncomfortable. - We were a party of 6 and wanted to order 2 chickens. Apparently they have a policy of only one chicken per table, which is nowhere on their website or menu. The manager came out to talk to us, but refused to give us the 2 chickens. I think this is why they sent out the complimentary salads. The food was good, but I wouldn't go back.",4,,1
48,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",128,190,1032,5.0,6/22/2016,"One of the best dining experiences I've had this year. The food was fantastic and service was impeccable.  I was so taken with the food that I forgot to take pictures, which I completely regret as pictures of my favorite dishes bring me immeasurable pleasure (my guy and dog understand they take a back seat to food pictures in my camera roll). Anyway, enough babbling, let's get to the dishes I've tried:Fresh Cheese - the second we sat down, my friend started to talk about how we needed to try the fresh cheese, she has heard so many rave reviews about it. Ok, Fresh Cheese it is. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but woah, it definitely lived up to the hype!  The cheese itself was like a smooth ricotta cheese, super flavorful, while the addition of leeks provided a chewy texture the dish needed. I wish it came with small pieces of toast to spread the cheese on.  But that didn't deter us from scooping up the cheese with our spoons and polished it off in seconds. Beef Carpaccio - the beef was thinly sliced, but not too thin that it falls apart when you try to pick it up with a fork. It was also well seasoned and tasted extremely fresh, almost like there was a cow in the kitchen (ok that was gross, I've acknowledge it). Weirdly, it came with a giant piece of buttered bread, I think it would've complimented the cheese dish better. Chicken for Two - another dish that completely lived up to its hype. I think it exceeded the much hyped chicken from Nomad. As restaurants generally do with whole chickens, they present you with the whole chicken before taking it back to slice it up. I love the smokiness of the smell of hay below the chicken. The fact that they decide to leave the chicken claws is a bit weird for me. Chicken feet is a well represented in Asian cuisine, but they are usually cooked differently, the claws here just look burned and sad. Haha, chicken feet aside, the dish is amazingggggggg.  The chicken skin is perfectly crisp, while the meat is juicy and flavorful. It is one of the best chicken dishes I've had in awhile. Even the accompanied salad was delicious, I really loved the dressing.  Brought the leftover chicken back to my guy, and he gobbled them all up within minutes. Mint Chocolate sorbet - it was the perfect end for a delicious meal. The sorbet was just light enough as a palate cleanser and the mint flavor was perfectly subtle. I have to make a special note about how impeccable the service was. I didn't realize the back of the chair was hallow and dropped my purse the second I've sat down. Our waiter was quick to pick it up and put it on an empty chair for me. Small gestures like that made a huge impression on me. Our water glasses never dipped below a quarter full, and when my friend ordered a second glass of wine, our waiter filled my glass as well. As noted by Pete Wells of NYT, it is strange that the waiters are forced to wear a weird jumpsuit, it was pretty ugly. I am glad service was not affected despite the unusual dress code.  I can go on and on about how fantastic the food was and how pleasant the wait stuff was, but I think you should just go experience it yourself. Highly highly recommend this restaurant!!",5,2,2

51,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,3.0,8/9/2016,"A restaurant of the future! I say this because all the waiters are dressed like they're on the set of hunger games in district 12. The decor is modern chic and while the space is small, the restaurant doesn't feel cramped.We started out with the bread - it comes out looking like it was ripped off of another larger loaf. No matter how ridiculous it looks - it's actually really good. There was some really good black pepper butter on the side that I couldn't get enough of. Next we had some of the home made cheese. It had the consistency of ricotta but it's less sour. The cheese was a nice way to cleanse the palate in prep for the main course.Our main was the Sasso Chicken which is probably the most popular dish at Le Turtle. The waiters bring out the whole cooked chicken so you can have a looksie and smell the burning chicory. They'll also let you take some snaps as well before they tuck it back into the kitchen for carving. The chicken has great flavor and I like how they serve the leg with the feet and toe nails intact. It's like something you'd find in a Chinese restaurant. Except the flavor is pure French. The skin is probably the best part of the chicken - so be sure to eat it all!Le Turtle is a trendy modern restaurant that serves up pretty good food. I'm sure I'll return some day soon!",2,1,

We also ordered foie gras and grilled broccoli salad.  Both were interesting while tasty. Chef added unique ingredients to allow us experiment with how we want to eat our food. Service was attentive and friendly. Ambience was cozy. My only complaint was their wine by glass price is high when compared against by bottle. The same wine was $62 by bottle and $21 by glass.

54,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,3/15/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10There are so many things out of the ordinary for Le Turtle, which recently opened in Lower East Side as ""new wave"" French restaurant. I'm not sure what that exactly means, but then I visit their website and see all these weird videos (including a clip from the excellent movie Ex Machina starring Oscar winner Alicia Vikander as a mesmerizing robot). It certainly triggered my interest in visiting this place, even more so when I stepped into the artsy dining space with all servers in jump suits. If there is a place where artists frequent in a futuristic setting, Le Turtle looks like the kind of place that fits the bill. I was hoping that the food would be as good as the creative force behind these surreal settings, and found a lot to like here.The relatively concise menu at Le Turtle, with the kitchen helmed by the critically acclaimed Brooklyn tasting menu palace Blanca alum Greg Proechel, displays plenty of modern twists on French cuisine. While it would be somewhat of a travesty that bread is charged for $6 at other restaurants, I actually didn't mind at Le Turtle because the bread is excellent, especially when accompanied by butters with interesting flavor like escargot. Kabocha squash and fresh cheese was a light appetizer that should be on your table to start the meal, too. My favorite dish at Le Turtle was kohlrabi bisque along with lamb belly and smoked cabbage. I absolutely loved the rich, aromatic flavor of the bisque that was so elegant without overpowering your palate. My dining companions and I made a quick work out of this dish, and I secretly wished I had this just for myself. Some dishes felt a bit pedestrian. Maine lobster, which came with pickled aji Amarillo and Asian pear, felt slightly overcooked, as was the lamb that came with squash and roasted carrot. But then the restaurant made up for it with this insane whole chicken for two that was accompanied by rutabaga and chicory salad. The server brings the entire chicken as a show (I've actually seen photos of the chicken with burning flames but unfortunately all the fire died when I saw it, leaving only the ashes and smoke), and then carves it in different pieces. It was an excellent chicken (definitely one of the better ones I've had recently) that had juicy, tender meat with moderate seasoning to make sure people enjoy the texture of the dish. Desserts were also delightful without being overly sweet. I enjoyed the simple-looking hazelnut financier with yogurt sorbet and pear puree that was deceptively elegant, and dark chocolate sorbet was also a winner.As mentioned above, the vibe of the restaurant itself is something to visit Le Turtle for. Getting a restaurant could be a challenge due to the relatively small space and its recent attraction to young, artsy crowds in LES, so make sure to book advance. There is full bar menu, with some nice wine selections (some natural wines sprinkled in between). LES is really experiencing an explosion of good restaurants lately, and Le Turtle certainly fits in that category. I'd love to see how it evolves over time.",5,2,3

A la that episode from Portlandia where the characters really care about the chicken they ordered, the waiter came out and said ""this will be your chicken tonight"" holding a huge bird on fire. In the tone he spoke, he could've continued with ""his name was Steve and he enjoyed tennis and evening walks in the park"" but he was professional.  Speaking of, the other waitress was high AF but still recommended an excellent red wine to compliment Steve the chicken and took care of us well.For dessert we finished with the dark chocolate sorbet. So delicious.  Overall, my expectations were exceeded. I thought this place would be a ""try it once for the novelty"" kind of thing, but I do see myself coming back in the near future.",6,3,4
62,Alexandria M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,10/13/2017,"Fun environment for dinner before a night out! The food was creative but execution was lacking. For the main dish the scallops were overcooked.

The food was not memorable except for the sasso chicken because upon being served, i realized i can get the same thing for a third of the cost a few blocks over in chinatown. The service was bad also, the staff kind of gave us blank stares as we walked in. The only thing worth mentioning is the decor which does look pretty cool and hip but overall i wouldn't come back.",2,,
64,Frank R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,3,1,4.0,4/2/2018,I absolutely love this place... the cocktail are amazing and the food is delicious.

The decor is simple yet refreshing, and love the architecturally innovative touches.

Nice but with a ""yeah, you are at an it place and you should recognise. Music: 1; simply atrocious and trying way too hard (this is the part where if you like this stuff you're likely going to think it's amazeballs - i don't like angry music that shouts at me when i am eating chicken just saying). Drink: 5 stars. We had wine, it was amazing thanks to the most lovely Sommelier who you could ever encounter. She navigated and advised with so much care and joy. She is worth a trip alone, when you go, ask for her. Food: 5 stars. this stuff is legit and so good and amazing, reserve you damn chicken. So the weird thing is i wont go back cuz the atmosphere is a bit too hip and cool with a tad too much attitude (for me), but it is a good place and the food is amazing.",3,,

The restaurant staff were dressed in grey jumpsuits with striped undershirts almost like a outfit inspired by Maison Margiela. My boyfriend and I had the wagyu beef cheek and grilled lobster entrees, both dishes did not disappoint. Served at the perfect temperature with lots of flavor. But the star dish of this restaurant to us was clearly the lamb belly bisque. The multitude of savory flavors and combinations of unexpected spices combined together with the subtle flavor of lamb was spectacular. Definitely a dish he and I will remember out of all our dinner dates and will look forward to having again. Thanks Le Turtle!",,,

We also had the Tilefish (white fish) with some of the best mushrooms I've had in the city. Out of this world.

71,Troy S.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",3,4,0,2.0,3/11/2016,"I have to say, first impressions of this restaurant were not so good. My party was honestly running late for our 6:15 reservation, on March 11, which is naturally our fault. 2 of us showed at 6:30 and were told we could not have a seat at our table as the whole party of 3 hadn't arrived. Typical NY busy restaurant rule, however they had just opened at 6 pm and only 2 two tops were occupied. They told us we could order a drink at the bar while we wait, so I did and the bartender was absolutely lovely, served me a delicious glass of wine. I spoke with my mother about how the policy of not be able to sit ""in an empty restaurant"" was absurd but on the other hand if it was full I would have totally understood. A man overheard us, who I later found out worked there, offered a glass of wine and I told him that I could order for myself as I thought it was just a guy who was trying to hit on me. He provided no introduction or apology, thin shorter and greying haired man.Right after ordering the wine, the Host came ( tall thin black man with glasses) and said he would sit us, but we had to make sure we left by 8:15 pm. I don't like a time limit, and his tone was quite rude. He could have said the time limit in a much nicer way. Our other party member didn't arrive until well after our reservation at 6:50. We were late, no question. But there's a way to manage people and still provide a good outcome for both the restaurants business and their patrons. After we finished our first bottle of wine, the waiter asked if we would like wine by the glass, I told him I have felt rushed and treated poorly the whole night. Isn't it a waiters responsibility to upswell? Why not offer another bottle? There was 3 of us drinking and it was only 7:20 well out from our 8:15 curfew. When we left, only 4 tables were occupied. We were rushed out for no reason at all. Unacceptable.One final note, the company website didn't offer an email for the manager.  I would much rather have reached out to him personally than in such a public forum. Also wished that the staff would have sent the manager over to listen and respond.I must say, the food was absolutely phenomenal, the Foie Grais was absolutely amazing!",12,4,3
72,Ian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",346,205,0,5.0,6/12/2016,"I really enjoyed Le Turtle, it is stylish (sexy vibe), has great food, and the price is reasonable for the quality of ingredients/inventiveness of the food.  We had the scallops, chicken liver mouse, the crudo, and the chicken for 2.  The chicken for two was beautifully presented and tasted great.  It is less rich and a bit less flavorful than the NoMad's chicken, but it is also easier to eat and in a way more refined (due to its simplicity). Overall, I think Le Turtle is a great restaurant, especially to go on a date where you are trying to impress.  Highly recommend.",3,,1

74,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,359,3,4.0,2/24/2016,"Le Turtle, in the LES, is TRENDY - the type of place you'd expect to see Derek Zealander..or perhaps Jennifer Aniston...who was actually seated at the table next to us. Like a good New Yorker, I 100% kept my cool and DEFINITELY did not stare.  (So, Jen was there, with Justin Theroux...as well as Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.  All celebrating Jen's birthday.  I die.)The wait & bar staff wear a highly chic, seemingly inmate-inspired outfit - a super baggy, olive-green onesie.  They all looked fabulous.  The menu is a little difficult to decipher, but the star of the show is certainly the chicken, which I'll get to.  We started with fresh cheese & squash, which was delicious and light. The foie gras is good, as foie tends to be - however, it's prepared a little differently than I'm used to seeing (in a pate form, with crusty bread.) This kind is served seemingly pan-seared, so it becomes a gelatinous, fatty bubble, with a bit of crust at the edges, atop a sweet sauce.  Definitely a new-age rendition.  Lobster with aji dulce - my second-favorite - is just a tail and a claw, but beautifully presented and delicious.And now the chicken-  It comes out atop live coals, sizzling, with the head still attached and feet aflame, to be presented to the diner for their approval.  The waiter will pause for pictures, which comes out a little graphic on the iPhone, but I've seen journalists capture it epically (below, not my photo.)  They then take it back to the kitchen to be broken-down so it's easier to share - and it's incredibly good.  The crispy skin is a treat in itself.Definitely a place to see & be seen, so I'd take an attractive, well-dressed friend or date when you visit - one that can keep their cool around celebrities (aka, not me.)",8,7,6
75,Barbara D.,"Denver, CO",445,383,9,2.0,2/6/2016,"It's not often that I return home and immediately fire up the Yelp review.  However, after tonight's awkward adventure, I felt the need to do so.   For a place that's all about ""the scene"" and with an eclectic selection of individuals dining there, you'd think they would care a bit more about following thru and attention to detail. Started out ok.  Ordered a good bottle of wine.  Sat at the bar.  Had the cheese and meat plate.  Bread came with it.  More bread showed up at some point.  Bartender accidentally broke a glass, meaning everything had to be cleared.  We were more concerned about his welfare than really being annoyed, as the wine in our glasses was almost finished and most of the cheese/meat plate was finished.  He apologized profusely... we told him not to worry about it and we've all been off our game at one point or another.   More bread shows up.Then our lobster dish.  Tasted great.  Did I think it was worth $29 for a claw and tail?  Not so sure, but hey... it's NYC, so whatevs.  Moved onto the wagyu beef, which bartender had said was his favorite dish on menu.  Soooo... let's just say that I had to excuse myself at some point bc there was so much fat in the piece of meat that I had, that it was like chewing gum.  So it was either spit it into the cloth napkin at the bar, or bathroom.  So there was only two large pieces of meat... which meant that about 1/4 of mine...was sheer fat.  Greeaat.  Anyway, brushed that off too... kept going and bartender tells us that he's getting our desserts bc of the broken glass debacle.  Awesome.  Nice and not necessary.   So out comes 2 desserts that he picked for us... the hazelnut cake thing and a vegan chocolate gelato.   My friend is allergic to cheese/dairy... so she couldn't have the lemon frozen yogurt with the hazelnut, but was perfectly happy nibbling on the cake and the chocolate vegan gelato.Ordered 2 last glasses of vino.  Then bill comes...  We were CHARGED for the desserts that he chose for us.  Yep... $12 for the cake.. another $7 for the other gelato.   WE WERE ALSO CHARGED FOR THE EXTRA BREAD.  Ummm... didn't ask for it.. just showed up... and you charged us $2 for it?  Seriously?!?  Nothing was taken off our check.   We didn't choose the desserts, nor were we asked if we wanted bread or made aware that it was going to be an up-charge!    The saddest part is that the bartender cheerfully told us where he works elsewhere and told us that he hopes we'll come in... Why?  So you can fool us into thinking that you're doing us a favor and then charge us for it?  No thanks! The decor was cool and I think we would have come back and tried the chicken for 2, had we not been ""taken for a ride"".   Sorry, it's only $21 between the dessert & bread, but the general style of not one person coming over to ask if we were ok when glass was shattered across from us... and then lying to us... yeah, that's not the way to gain repeat business.  Way too many other places to check out instead.  NEXT...",22,6,2
76,Lauren R.,"Philadelphia, PA",138,8,11,2.0,11/13/2017,"This review is strictly for their brunch. I came here with a group of friends because it was right around the corner from our hotel and the wait was very long for us at other brunch spots since there were 10 of us. The place was pretty empty at noon on Sunday and we were seated right away. First, the menu is really lacking selection and is very overpriced. $5 for a slice of bacon that was basically a slab of fat. Our server was rude and snobby. When we asked for milk, his response was that he had asked earlier if we wanted milk and no one responded. Even if that was the case (I did not hear him ask), that's just not how you speak to people in the service industry. He was very obviously annoyed. My friend got the yogurt and granola bowl and later asked what was on top of it since the menu did not say. The server referred to it as a  ""snow"" that is made in the kitchen with a chemical he couldn't pronounce...what?? His exact words. Overall, the portions were small and the price was definitely not worth it",,1,

I can only speak to the sasso and the cheese plate but that evening the smoking chicken came out as if the food runner lit the grass stuff with his cigarette lighter right before running to present it on the table... so that moment was bungled. I think the smoke died down pretty quickly and was only partially charred. Maybe I overhyped it but I wanted my guests to be awed... not like fajitas when they come out without smoke.

The main reason I wanted to go to Le Turtle was because of the design (I had already heard the food was so-so). Still I would have thought the food and drink would be better.  The actual choices of dishes are great. Inventive but not trying too hard. I only wish the taste was more exceptional. Le Turtle reminds me of The Pines in Gowanus. It too offers bread you buy as a dish. At the Pines this bread dish had something special about it. I would almost return only for that dish. There are 3 different hunks of bread and a generous portion of homemmade,  whipped butter. In contrast, the bread dish at Le Turtle seemed a rip off. Nothing special about it. It came with 3 types of butter which were no more tasty than any of the glorified gourmet butters you can get at a speciality grocery store.  And now the service: we were one of the first seatings and our server already miserable. He was pushy, impatient and had no sense of humor. We asked what size the chicken was and he said it's the size of a chicken. Ah, ok, right. Dumb question. All chickens are exactly the same size.The people who brought the actual dishes to us and cleared our plates were extremely sweet. They should be the servers.  With all this said I can see why Le Turtle was full with Summer tourists; they do not know there's much much better out there with less hype.",,1,

They didn't pressure us to order more but we did feel our waiter sort of hovered and made it hard to relax. Also my friend who is not a drinker was having club soda and they kept refilling his drink and then charged us for the refills! I mean are you kidding me? They already charge $17 a cocktail and then they charge $4 a club soda? That's pretty tacky. The cocktails are tasty but not amazing. Everyone raves about the chicken so we got it and we both thought it was just ok. It tastes fine but isn't mind blowing. In fact although the skin was moist and absolutely delicious, the meat was already drying out by the time it hit the table. The side it comes with is dry and feels like an afterthought. The middle of the menu is where it's at. All the smaller plates were delicious. The sunchokes, romanesco, sweet potatoes, and raviolis were all amazing. The raviolis in particular were actually exceptional. If you go, get those. The vibe is cool, music is chill and not too loud, and the hostess was super nice when we had to add an extra person last minute.

Updated review","Went back to the Turtle to try the spring menu. It was even better than the winter menu.  We ordered a bunch of things from the menu including the famous roast chicken.  The wagyu, fresh cheese and the lobster were out of this world.  I don't really like steak but the wagyu was cooked perfectly and it came with broccolini, which was insanely good.  The fresh cheese had some sunflower seeds, onions and grilled ramps - great combo. I would come back here for the fresh cheese alone.  The lobster was on point. The lamb belly was also a huge hit - super tender.",3,,2

I was looking for a fun, delicious place to have my best friends 27th birthday party and le turtle was perfect.  The atmosphere is intimate but fun, chic enough for my fashion friends but unpretentious enough for me and the food was some of the best I've had in my 20+ years of Manhattan dining.  Since our party was large we had to pay a minimum, half of which was due up front but the staff was incredibly helpful and responsive to all of our needs.  Our waiter Duncan was so helpful and charming that I ignored the fact tip was included because he absolutely deserved every penny after dealing with us.  From the man who seated us to the guys who cleared our table, the staff was friendly, efficient and on top of their game.  Side note: come for the amazing food and great service but stay longer than you planned for the eye candy; every person in the place is gorgeous, just as it should be on the lower east side.  But don't get me wrong, this eatery has substance, it is not just a pretty shell.Let's talk food: we started with warm bread accompanied with a trio of butters including escargot butter- I didn't know how badly I wanted escargot butter until someone gave it to me.  With our bread we also got a meat and cheese plate that was good enough to be the whole meal.  The next few dishes we had were salads, a food group that could be boring but turned out to be one of my favorite parts of the meal.  They have this one salad that is like a deconstructed Cesar and it blew my mind.  It's also worth noting that some of my party were vegetarians and they left just as satisfied as the carnivores.  Following salad we had the meats: steak cooked so perfectly I could cry, ox tail that could turn a vegan into a meat junky and the chicken, sweet baby Jesus the chicken!  Le turtle's chicken is by far the best chicken in New York.  Not only is it displayed interestingly (singed hay anyone?) but it tastes like heaven in poultry form.   We were so full and happy after the meat course we had to skip out on dessert.  Even though we passed on dessert, they still brought out a little something with a candle in it for my friend, but by that point I was already lighting up a post coital cigarette because le turtle had just rocked my world.",3,2,1
102,F.D. C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,4.0,1/15/2016,"It is hard to believe that a restaurant can be built around chicken liver mousse. But that is the most important thing to eat here. I think they will stop the 2$ upcharge for a little extra bread -- but the baguette from Roberta's is a perfect accompaniment. I would not stop at that first course, though. Their fresh cheese is also a revelation, and achieving silken kabocha is no small feat.  The lamb was deeply satisfying.  The cockles were a touch salty but they will get that dish right over time; it is obvious that little refinements are still being made. There was still some trouble with the swordfish belly and its consistency. Service is unobtrusive, helpful, and classy. Insist on sitting away from the door on cold nights until they do something about the draft. The tucked away tables here and there in the space are worth seeking out. You will be rewarded with intimacy, so often hard to achieve. The wine director has a great eye. One hopes over time the list expands. This is food made for wine.",8,4,5
103,Molly P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,0,3.0,3/5/2016,"I have mixed feelings about The Turtle. The food all tasted good. Our server was attentive and knowledgable. We especially enjoyed the squash appetizer, the lobster dish - which is small but mighty - and the mint ice cream. But, we ordered the chicken for 2 and the special, $100 steak - both came out completely cold! We mentioned this to our server very politely, and he took the steak back. When it returned, it was still cold. The chicken was also not presented on burning hay, as it was for other tables. Our meal for 6 was almost $600, and 3 of us were only drinking water. It's a lot to pay for cold food. I would be interested to see if they are able to fix this glitch as time goes on.",4,,1
104,Lei L.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,12,1,5.0,4/4/2016,"Went with girlfriends to this hot new restaurant. Did not disappoint! We all dressed up and did a girls night out. Food was delicious! The cute waiter was attentive and came back often for plate changes and requests. I love the chicken plate and the braised oxtail! The lobster dish was out of this world, fresh lobster and cooked just right! I wanted seconds but there are more food coming. Romaine salad was surprisingly delicious! It wasn't chopped up like normal salad, very crispy and savory. One of my favorites! At the end of the night, I was too full to move and very satisfied, will certainly come bak again when I get a reservation!",2,2,2
105,Glen W.,"Manhattan, NY",403,358,5,5.0,8/11/2016,"This is a wonderful place.  Fabulous drinks, best chicken (Sasso Chicken for Two) I have ever had.  Delicious hazelnut cake for dessert.  Very hip and fun atmosphere.",1,,
106,Vett D.,"Rogers, AR",19,10,3,1.0,9/29/2016,"Deserves ZERO stars for service alone!! As a tourist in such a lovely city, I must say this business is filled with extremely rude employees. After a nice dinner we came here to meet some friends of friends and were instantly met with attitudes and ""eye rolls."" For the shitty drinks we received this place is barely worth the review I'm writing. Don't waste your time visiting... Go somewhere else!",,,
107,Ki G.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",250,707,92,4.0,2/1/2016,"Came here the day before the blizzard for a late-night catch-up dinner with an old friend. Decor is modern and not warm, but intimate and interesting. We, like so many others, ordered the chicken for two and shared the fresh cheese and kabocha app. The flavors in both were spot on and the best part of the dining experience was the the feeling that you could take your time and enjoy, even with the snow starting to fall in soft, persistent waves out of doors.",3,,3
108,Katie B.,"Berkeley, CA",51,113,1,5.0,1/16/2016,"Stopped in for a quick drink and the bar was full--the waitstaff let us sit at a table. Great wine selection, and service was quick and friendly. Can't wait to return for dinner!",3,1,2
109,FoodieNY C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,20,2,2.0,3/29/2016,"Understand it's only a few months in, however the food was mediocre at best.  Tried many things on the menu in our party of 8 and I took away no memorable dishes.Wine selections are very young and absolutely horrendous.Not impressed.",2,,
110,T Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,4,2.0,3/29/2016,Disappointing. Small portions that are overpriced. Chicken liver mousse was inedible -- which was sad because that is always my go to appetizer. Wagyu was average. Mushrooms were the only real winner.The website makes this place appear much cooler than it actually is. The mechanic jumpsuits aren't cute either.Maybe worth a revisit when they get their liquor license and switch up the menu.,2,,
111,Summer O.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,9,0,5.0,5/21/2016,"Brunch! Brunch! Brunch!!!!! Le Turtle is the place to be for brunch. Such a hip but relaxing atmosphere. My husband, my brother and sister in law had a great time. Our experience was fantastic from the initial greeting, to the service, to the FOOD!! We recommend the omelette with the thick cut side of bacon, the salmon plate with rye toast, the sticky bun and the waygu beef hash... all AMAZING!! I know we will be back soon!!",1,,1

113,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",50,140,439,4.0,5/7/2016,"Trendy place, cool door guy. When our waitress appeared, I was taken aback since she was wearing a mechanic's onesy outfit. Seemed odd and noticed all wait staff had baggy onesies on which was strange for a French place. She recommended the Main lobster dish. Really good, but expected an actual entree. Instead, we got half a lobster tail. Menu should really say lobster tail at least and not ""Main"" lobster. Otherwise, a decent place - excellent garlic salad and decent wild bass. Dessert was supposed to be hazelnut and chocolate which was good but didn't taste hazelnut. Wouldn't go back, but good for a quick drink and app if in the area.",,,
114,Gus U.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,14,0,3.0,4/4/2016,"Nothing too spectacular. LOTS of hype. Service was !!! (On point). Left feeling a bit underwhelmed. Most of the dishes, while seasoned and executed well, lacked any true sense of passion.  The fresh cheese and squash dish was delicious and so was the bread course. The wagyu dish was boring. Was expecting a little more creativity with the plating. A lot of the dishes I had looked the same, in terms of technique. Space is beautiful. 3 stars.",1,,
115,An B.,"Manhattan, NY",29,29,6,4.0,4/13/2016,"Very cute corner! Decor wise I loved it! note; pink velvet stools that fit in the rounded cement benches were brilliant, mid century raw hide leather banquettes/ wood chairs and graphic marble tables and gold light fixtures make for a very sexy interior, (minus the gold foil patch up wall though) . Bathrooms were large and beautiful with the best candles from Lfredo, nice touch! Okay Foodwise; I went there for brunch and it was Okay... Their beet and root salad was very fresh and zesty w a nice dressing and ground pistachios , was very appealing to the eye. I had the Egg/Gruyere breakfast croissant after that and was mediocre at best, hit the spot but nothing to write home about. I did try their wagu beef and eggs hash that had a lot more flavor and made up for my snooze fest to dismay of my partner who had to share his dish...The bloody Mary's were also okay... Not too thrilling but hit the spot.",,,
116,E. M.,"Manhattan, NY",14,130,55,3.0,1/24/2017,"Went here the other night to try their famous chicken everyone has been talking about. We had a decent reservation at 9:15pm, late but not that late by NYC trendy restaurant standards. Anyway, we were shocked when we tried to order the chicken and were told they had run out. I'd read many articles about this place and didn't know this was even a possibility. So that was pretty disappointing considering it was a big reason we chose to come here, so be forewarned if you like many others are going for the chicken. That being said, we stayed and ordered other items that were by and large good, particularly the lobster and Wagyu. So overall the meal was pricey but good, the scene is energetic, and its got a good ambiance and music. I just think if you're going to be known for something you shouldn't run out of it, that seems more like poor management.",,,
117,Kaitlyn F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,0,2.0,10/6/2016,"Very disappointed in Le Turtle. Went with my boyfriend, we had a reservation at 9:15 but were not able to be seated until 9:45. When we finally got seated our service was horribly slow, we were ready to order for 20 minutes before we finally saw our waiter again and were able to put our food order in. We got the wagyu shortribs and the chicken for two. The food was good, but not great. Overall a disappointing experience, especially for a restaurant with so much hype and such great reviews. Will not be going back.",2,,1
118,Michael B.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",1,11,0,4.0,3/30/2016,Ate here last week. Trendy new spot for the LES. The oxtail was amazingly tender and fell off the bone. Going back I'd definitely have that again. Wagyu was a winner but would rank the oxtail better.,,,
119,Ophelia T.,"OAKLAND GARDENS, NY",150,169,88,4.0,10/13/2016,"This is like 3.5-4 stars. I can't quite decide. I feel like 4 stars may be too much, while 3.5 is maybe too low. I can't put my finger on it. Came here on a weeknight around 6 and the place was popping by the time I left. The servers here are as other helpers mentioned: in formal attire. Where as the waitstaff or bus boys were in interesting hunger game like jumpers. But that really didn't matter to me that much. Came with a friend and the server was attentive to us and made good suggestions and since it was just two girls and we wanted to order their famous chicken, they assured us the chicken portion is large enough for the two of us and never pressured us to order more or to pair it with any alcohol. We decided to get the chicken with the beef carpaccio since he did recommend that. Both were good. Especially liked the baguette that came with the beef carpaccio. I personally liked the chicken more than the beef carpaccio though. The portion was generous and the flavor of the smoked herbs were prominent for both smell and the palette. Definitely did not disappoint!",1,,1
120,Isa B.,"West Caldwell, NJ",0,4,0,3.0,4/21/2016,"I will start off by saying the food is good. The experience over all was pretty terrible. First I had to make a reservation 3 weeks out for 6pm because there was nothing available. Fine, not a problem. When my sister and I arrived at 557pm they would not let us into the restaurant because they ""we're closed"" while the staff were sitting at the bar on their phones. Congrats you just lost yourself 2 drinks at the bar. Then when we were allowed to enter the restaurant we sat down ready to order because we knew we wanted the chicken for 2. We ordered some tap water and the chicken and the waiter gave us this look because that's all we ordered. (Like he was calculating how much tip he could possibly make off of us). He asked ""would you like anything before the chicken because the chicken is going to take awhile."" We decided on the pickled cauliflower (very good). Well for a chicken that takes awhile it came out 5-7 after we ate the cauliflower. The chicken was very good, moist, and wonderfully presented. The plates however are very small so eating it was a bit of a struggle without having the food go everywhere on the table. They cleared the table and our waiter had asked us if we wanted to dessert. We passed because the chicken was very filling. Gave us another look, dropped the check, we paid and left. Dinner was exactly 60mins (we even sat for about 10-15 mins after paying chatting), the restaurant wasn't full so that whole ""we're booked"" line is garbage. Your food is good but it's NOT THAT GOOD. Don't make yourself appear more exclusive than you really are.",4,2,1
121,Deborah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,0,4.0,8/1/2016,"This is a nice find in an area with a lot of restaurants, many of which are the same. Le Turtle is definitely not one of the crowd. It has a cool, glamorous ambience, without trying too hard. The waitstaff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the food and wine, without being at all snooty. The host was friendly, funny, totally relaxed on a busy night. The food was great. It isn't cheap, but definitely worth returning.",1,,1
122,Ashley M.,"New York, NY",1,10,0,2.0,4/25/2016,"I was incredibly excited to try Le Turtle, but left feeling disappointed. They were out of 2 of the 5 entrees. Since they did not have the the fish or chicken for 2, we were left with 2 beef dishes and an entree called ""grilled asparagus."" Since the group does not eat red meat we ordered appetizers and this (so called) grilled asparagus entree (not even by New York standards could this be called a vegetarian entree). The asparagus ""entree"" was a total of 3-4 thick stalks of asparagus cut up with sauce. The pickled cauliflower and broccoli rabe was charred, sour (and not from a unique fennel taste, but a wow I need to spit this out taste) and inedible. The other appetizers we shared had interesting flavors but were in no way unique and certainly did not compensate for the other things mentioned above. I'm typically a dining optimist and will let a few things slide but this was notably unsatisfying from a service to a food standpoint.",1,1,1
123,Michael E.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,27,0,5.0,5/3/2016,"We loved this place.  Great food and great environment.  Everything we had was delicious.  Unfortunately, they were out of the chicken but all our alternates didn't leave us unsatisfied.  And now we have a reason to return.",1,,1
124,Jared B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/7/2016,"Ton of great unique dishes.  Wygu beef and the home made cheese were our favorites.  The vegetarian options were also a big hit, particularly the asparagus.  Try not to fill up on the delicious breads to start!",,,
125,Casey B.,"Manhattan, NY",41,25,11,3.0,4/25/2016,"I have to say this was the first time I ever walked out of a restaurant truly disappointed. I made a reservation long in advance and was really looking forward to trying the chicken for two that I'd heard so much about. Upon arrival, every seat in the restaurant was taken and we were told there would be a bit of a wait; which usually wouldn't bother me much. The hostess was really kind and brought over some champagne for us as consolation. Soon 30 minutes had passed by and still nothing. Eventually we found a seat at the bar and the staff sent over some bread and butter for us while we continued to wait. Finally, after nearly an hour, we were seated. Our waitress was really sweet and greeted us quickly, but informed us that they were out of the chicken dish for the night. At that point I honestly wanted to leave but it was 10pm and I was starving so we stayed. I just wish someone had let us know sooner that they were out of chicken, knowing that that is what most people come for - nearly every table in the place had ordered it. Had we been seated at the time of our reservation this probably could have been avoided. We ended up having the kohlrabi bisque and the grilled wagyu, both of which were good but overpriced for the portion size. Overall, the kindness of the staff helped to make up a little for the disappointment of the actual meal. I think the place would benefit from some better front of the house management.",,,
126,Geo A.,"Staten Island, NY",8,1,0,1.0,6/17/2016,Wow whoever said pretentious was spot on. This place is food junk. The price will make you believe this place stands out but I assure you.. if you enjoy decent food.. this will not do for you. Choose anything else and you're ahead. The appetizers are a joke at best.. I don't mine spending money on great food.. but this is not even mediocre. The chicken for 2 is.. well not good is the nicest way to say it.. you'd be better off getting a pre-made grocery store roasted chicken.. it will definitely taste better. The salad that comes with the chicken will definitely make anyone used to eating decent food gag. No lies gag. It's bitter and disturbingly bad. Disturbingly bad. At the end of the horrendous meal you will be served a bill that is soo far away from the foods quality that you will understand why someone like myself would even bother posting on yelp. Terrible stay away. Do yourself a favor and choose any Asian place in the area. Wow. Just stay away and let this place die,1,4,
