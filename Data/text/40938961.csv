0,Yash P.,"Old Bridge, NJ",85,3,0.0,4.0,7/8/2018,We had to pay 30$ cover charge for the guys to get in after 12:30 am on a Saturday night but the vibe inside was absolutely amazing and free drinks were going around. Definitely recommend this place.,,,
1,Ebrahim H.,"Denville, NJ",10,15,13,1.0,9/2/2018,"One star is one too many for this place. There was a time where Cielo would be my go-to spot for good house music, world famous DJs and dancing with like minded partiers. However last night just proved that this place is all about getting as many young (barely 18 y.o old) kids into a crammed space and feeding them drivel instead of good music. We stood an hour outside in the line while youngsters who claim to be promoters corral a lot of similar aged kids to the front - just pushing past those standing in line while the bouncers turn a blind eye. This was so frustrating and even resulted a fight when some these kids busted past the patrons who've been patiently waiting in line. Another promoter came to ask me and my wife if we wanted to skip the line for a mere $75 per person. WTF? There was probably some drinks thrown in for that price - but still that's ludicrous. It's just a way to get those tired of waiting in line to pay more to get inside faster. When we eventually got inside the cover was $60 total for the two of us- but because I paid with a credit card they charged me $64.50. This extra $4.50 was probably to cover the credit card machine service fee.  And they never told me about the extra charge - I just saw it on my statement. You'll swear this was a mom and pop bodega who has to make sure they get their pull payment and so they charge you the extra % that the bank charges for cad payments. What a joke. The music inside was crap.  Such a great sound system wasted on cheesy commercial music to appease the un-discerning masses. We just returned from a week in Ibiza where none of the velvet rope and promoter crap exists. And the white isle has super clubs (Pacha, Amnesia, Hï, Ushuaia, etc) where the bouncers welcome you and tell you to have a great evening. Cielo, and so many other pretentious NYC clubs, treat their patrons without any dignity or respect. Unfortunately this venue will make money in spite of the crappy DJ lineup, unfair admission practices, dodgy promoters, and blatant over-charging of covers when paying with a credit card. The crowd that now seem to frequent the this venue are there to get wasted while listening to Top 40 hits - and Cielo does fine job keep them coming back. Sadly I will not be back. If you want to party with like minded folks and listen to stellar DJ lineups the head to Output or Schimansky's in Brooklyn",7,,
2,Keilon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,312,1877,3.0,11/13/2018,"I've been here several times now.  I believe it's always on a Wednesday night for a fix of deep house music all night with a good friend of mine.  The music is always a vibe with DJs who know what they're doing.  The crowd comes ready to party and sweat so be prepared especially the later it gets.  Arriving early gets you in sans cover which is appreciated.  There is a mandatory coat check however, so be prepared to pay regardless on those cold winter nights.  The drinks are expensive club prices for very bottom shelf liquor well drinks.  I'd recommend just ordering what you'd actually like to drink (i.e. Jameson, Grey Goose, Patron, etc.) because you might as well pay for something that will at least taste good.",1,,

I get that it's New York and lines to these clubs are long but the people were pushing us to get in like animals.

6,Angelo B.,"Westfield, NJ",199,679,611,4.0,12/30/2017,"Pros:-music was really good tech house-reasonable cover ($20 when we went, apparently can email for free guest list)-in Manhattan (don't need to venture to Brooklyn)Cons (comparing this place to Output, which I love)-crowd seems more like edm style... Lots of girls in heels, guys in ties, etc-expensive drinks (no surprise)-it's a tiny club -weird layout... There's a platform right in front of he DJ booth. I was wondering why it was so dead, then I realized the speakers don't really aim in that section In summary I prefer Output by a big margin.

Only the most savvy, popular and best looking could make it to the front of the obscenely long line and actually step inside. Cover charge, if any, varies by night.The sound system is booming; the type that makes you feel like your heart beat changed rhythm. And oh, it just takes you away.   There is a coat check and I'd say you should use it. There is little room that isn't used for dancing so you should make the best of it. And dance you will!!!Bathrooms are clean, bartenders pour heavily and make sure to check out the back area. People watching and adults at play are plenty to keep you entertained if your limbs get weary of dancing. The staff was on point and made me, if not everyone else, feel like this was home. Cielo is one of a remaining few, long-standing institutions that deserves the reputation it's earned.

15,Nati Y.,"New York, NY",0,44,4,3.0,2/24/2018,I went to Cielo as a favor for a friend. The music was primarily tech and EDM. There wasn't much hip-hop or r&b. The drink prices seemed standard for NYC. It's in the middle of the meatpacking district which is a playground for young professional on Fridays and Saturdays. The day that I went the club wasn't too packed and you can walk around easily. Occassionally you'll see people on the dancefloor who don't want to dance but only observe. The dancefloor is reserved for those who want to dance.,2,,
16,Nicole H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/3/2018,"So many of the men in this club were beyond disrespectful to the women in attendance--granted, this happens at a lot of clubs but it was especially noticeable here and what's worse is the bouncers even encouraged it. A man on line made obscene gestures towards my friend and I and the bouncer laughed and kept chatting with him. And it was no better once we got inside the club. The music wasn't anything to rave about and the club is surprisingly small inside (and way overcrowded). We were able to get in for free on a guestlist which made the night worth it, but the covers are way too pricey for such a mediocre club with such awful employees. Ladies, don't waste your time here.",8,,

Updated review","How lucky were we to walk into a club on a late Saturday afternoon and get in for free?!  And then to top it off, hear old school Hip Hop and some back in the day R and B pumping. Though, I think we may have missed the first few hours of decent dance music as we came in towards the 4:00pm hour. Upon walking in, we caught  the final few tunes from the DJs previous set which was good to hear. But then the music started waning towards the repetitious commercial radio tunes. Oh well, it's all good. Anyway, what limited time of semi-decent music played, it was just enough to break a little sweat and then stand in front of the musical air conditioner aka bass speaker; no earplugs required. The bass speaker has the wonderful ability to make it seem like your clothes are being blown off from all of that wattage and in turn dry you off a little. So you get a twofer, deep bass vibrations coursing through your body and also the best way to dry off before stepping out in the frigid cold....awesome!!I wasn't expecting to dance at all on this particular hang, so stopping in here turned out to be a bonus. Thanks Mercedes for being a cool hangout partner and thank you Cielo for having your speakers directly on the dance floor and not floating from the ceiling!!",22,19,20
18,Theartist F.,"Belleville, NJ",13,41,95,5.0,4/29/2018,"This is one of my favorite dance clubs in NYC.  This is a place ONLY if you like house music.  If you don't like house go to the hundreds of clubs in NYC:  Cielo's nights are Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.  I can only vouch for Sunday , Wednesday, and Tuesday because I visited on those days.  Drink prices standard for nyc.  There is a place you can smoke out back and trust me they ""smoke"".  Anyway, you will waste your money if you want to only hear r and b and hip hop.  This isn't the club for you.  Waste is for money and waist is on your body.  (Pet peeve from reading these reviews).  I also like this spot because if you get there early you can sit the hell down anywhere.  Enjoy!!",5,4,2

22,Kristina L.,"New York, NY",987,506,1239,1.0,2/18/2017,"Not a fan........Unless you like house, you are at the wrong place. I dig more hip hop than EDM/house music when I wanna go out to the club and dance the night away with my friends. Rule of thumb, If there ain't no booty poppin', the dance floor ain't poopin'. I do have to give it to the people who came out the night I went though. People actually ""danced"", which is not usual for NYC.Another reason I wasn't feeling the place was because it felt like I was having a seizure due to the blinking lights......It was too contrasting that my eyes were dying and I ended up just closing my eyes most of the time.The base was also TOO much causing my heart and body to feel uncomfortable. Super pricy: $30 per personWe tried giving our names for the guest list and only 1 was on there, which pissed us off, so we ended up having to pay. At first they said $30 per person, but we argued since they messed up and didn't have the other girls names on the guest list and was able to bring it down to $40 total for 3 girls.

They didn't explain their policy correctly then they gave me an attitude when I asked them about it. I wasn't happy with the service. To top it all off the bartender there had the nerve to tip herself 20% without my knowledge. It's not right to take money that isn't yours. And when I contacted Cielo they took forever to respond and they still haven't given me any update on why this happened at their establishment or any kind of apology. These people are scammers.",2,,
24,Kaylen T.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,13,1,3.0,1/3/2017,"Last night was my first time at Cielo. I had a good time. Fun, but not memorable. But I need to address something up-front first:No. Security. Pat-down. Are you kidding me? With all the madness going on in the world (and the very next night in Istanbul!!), you need to at least be checking for knives and guns. I brought a fifth of Jack with me in my back pocket - and boy it saved me a fortune. You should really fix that. --------------------------------------------When I arrived at 11:30pm there were about 10 people in line ahead of me at the door. The doorman was letting only a few people in at a time to make it look busy, but I was in after waiting about 10 minutes. They make you check your coat for $5 before even selling you a ticket or checking you on the list. I want to at least know I can get into the club before checking my jacket. Coat check staff were organized and quicker than the people in line. The admissions lady was terse but I was ready with my ID in hand and she waved me in quickly with a half-smile. I got in for free before midnight with RSVP for this particular event. Keep in mind that this was December 30th, the day before NYE, so things were probably a bit slower than usual since everyone was gonna party on the 31st.The space isn't tiny, but it is on the smaller end of Manhattan nightclubs... it is just one room with a small outdoor patio for smoking. Their Funktion One sound system is one of the best in Manhattan - the sound was crisp, the bass was strong, the volume was perfect - as loud as possible without being painful. Bring some ear plugs! The decor and lighting and visual effects systems seem pretty limited, but the disco balls are cute. Maybe I'm just jaded.The mens bathroom was efficient but only had one cramped sink. There is a lot of comfy seating available until someone buys bottle service (totally ok by me... they paid for it...); it looked pretty standard, nothing frilly and no sparklers (while I was there). The booth/table on the dance floor is really cheesy. Yes we can all see you paid $400 for a $20 bottle of liquor. Good for you. Now stop blocking the dance floor. I'm 30 and I liked the crowd. It was more mature, generally late 20s to mid 30s. Compared to many other clubs where people go to pop bottles and socialize, most people here were on the dance floor. It was a sausage-fest... probably at least 2 dudes per lady. Patrons were kinda B&T but were discrete with their business and I didn't see anyone trashed or causing trouble. Only a couple fist-pumps. The staff was very attentive at mopping spills and clearing empty drinks so the place was pretty clean. All the security and staff were courteous and professional.I came because the promoters of the evening's event and their DJs always throw a great party. I must have been really lit, because around 2:30am I realize I'm dancing to DISCO. wtf? I came to listen to deep house, not Donna Summer. The music wasn't bad but it killed my buzz... personal taste I suppose. The crowd had started to thin out, so I called it a night. The bouncer gave me a ""have a good night"" as I left, and I did, but I doubt I will return. If you are looking for a bumping party with good house music, look in Bushwick.Three stars.Pros: Mature, chill crowdRoom to dance, not packed shoulder-to-shoulderGreat sound system - strong bass, clear highsClean venue, professional staffAn eclectic mix of musical genresYou can BYOB, because security doesn't pat you down at the doorCons:You might get shot, because security doesn't pat you down at the door'Average', not memorable.

Crowd with Zero Class too.  So disappointing on a otherwise great trip. Oh an some other person on yelp noted how loud the fog machine was.  Jesus they were right, I do not have sensitive ears at all and the sound was shrieking.  Zero attention to detail.  Lighting terrible.  Just  a perfect storm of crap management.  The sound system was good but wow was it not being used well.",,,

Cielo truly has an unique vibe to it  as both times I have been here the place has been packed with professional dancers. The dancers don't work there, this seems to be where they come to let loos.  They have dance offs all over the dance floor, it was funny going towards the bathroom watching these guys have a battle in front of the bathrooms. It's pretty entertaining at first to see these pros go at it. The drinks are okay, the place gets pretty crowded, and definitely a little to loud to socialize. The music was house music but with beats I just wasn't feeling. I do like house but not the house the DJ has spinned the two times I have came here. Everyone I mingled with here seemed to be having the time of their lives, This scene isn't for people who wanna hear radio hits or ones who want that social lounge vibe.That being said it is an experience but one I don't care to experience again, unless my homies dragged me into this place again.",29,21,27

Updated review","Hello, An update from management at this club. I sent an email complaining about the situation and one manager got back to me. Another manager got back to me as well, who I assume is the front door manager I originally complained about and said she should not have responded because I am an idiot. The exact words were: ""Did you not understand me saying ""no need to respond  back. We ignore shit like this because we know their are idiots.""Despite the improper use of their and they are, it is simple to conclude that this is not a setting friendly to customers. Management finds falt in customers who come to have a good time at their venue. Very sad stuff.",5,,1
44,Bianca C.,"London, United Kingdom",3,27,21,1.0,8/27/2016,"0 stars! I would hesitate coming here on a weekend night even with a guest list. The bouncer and Bridge Troll Lady(GIVE ME MY MONEY OR ILL EAT U) were very aggressive while we were waiting for our guest list person who got bumped to the back of a line. The list was ending a 12 and I'm sure we were there at 11:55. Lo and behold when my friend got inside the hallway she said ""I don't care, it's 30$ or get out"" in the most aggressive tone. She almost called security on us and made it seem like we were instigating. I told everyone Cielo shouldn't have our the business because I've been here before and was wholly unimpressed. 1. small club, with one dance floor 2. weird atmosphere and older vibe, not for me. Its kind of a place where 40 somethings are coming here to do Molly 3. too pretentious to enjoy. 4. really unpleasant staff ruined it for me. Maybe only come here for an open bar happy hour and that's it!! Cause it's not even worth 5$ to come in this nasty place. Do they even host any good DJs here?",11,3,3

When you are outside in the line you can hear the edm music and hope that there is a variety on the music but that is not the case. I was there for about 10 minutes ,not because I wanted to but because my gorgeous  girlfriend was drinking her $21 sex on the beach made with cranberry juice because that is all they had to make it with. She said that the drink was strong but not worth $21.  The music selection was awful. If you like edm/house and likes to listen to the same beat on repeat for hoursssss then this is the spot for you.",,1,

For best results, check ahead of time to see who and who's playing that night.

Music was weak; sounded like a beat I made with my Yamaha keyboard back in 2001. Took a peek inside...couldn't see much, but what I saw was unimpressive.

61,Aleksey K.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,84,2,1.0,11/15/2015,"Never seen so many H&M button downs in my life. I was enjoying the music, and two idiots were discussing how they are going to get home right in front of the booth. Go outside and talk it out.Let's not forget the 'staff with a bright flashlight' checking for stuff every 5 minutes. Get glasses dude.Bartenders were friendly, the guy running the bathroom was nice.Bouncers were the worst; coat check this, and that pay this and that. You can say the same thing in a nicer tone and come across as a professional. What takes the cake is the disrespectful, arrogant shell of a woman that manned the entrance.If she is not the owner; you should probably put the guy running the bathroom in her place and let her do his job.She is too cool to look at the guest list. Too cool to speak to you. I'm not on the list then all of a sudden I'm on the list. She won't answer any questions. Threatened to deny me entrance for asking a simple question.  Her aura reeked if unhappiness and killed my mood. If you are reading this; your hat wasn't that great, and nobody was impressed by you or the establishment.On my way out I barely ran into some girl that was hiding in the dark corner with her (boyfriend?) as I was going through the bathroom traffic. Her boyfriend grabs my arm like I killed somebody and tried to move/push me. I think he realized that he was too weak to manipulate my arm. I looked at my arm as he was trying to push/pull it then looked at him and decided this was not going to go anywhere, so I helped him out and showed him how to do it properly.Broke the grip; so he starts the 'yapping' blah, blah. Do something or move on fella. All of a sudden bouncer rushes in and tells me to 'chill out' 100 times. Mind you, the weak little manmore was almost twice my size.After hearing 'chill out' over and over I decided to continue my journey to the nearest exit.

For a nice club in meatpacking, that is a pretty sweet deal. The setup for this place is very cool, there are lights everywhere on the walls, and then the dance floor is in the middle with lots of couches on the perimeter of the room. I haven't been on a weekend but I would expect these to become VIP areas then. However, on a monday they are open to all. The DJ's are not super well known but they were very good overall when I went last Monday. One of them was spinning too much jamaica-me-crazy music but then it got back to more traditional deep house (including some trap, which i am always a big fan of!).",4,,

Ticket said they would honor reduced cover after 12, and that's what we were told at the door. Yet, when we went inside to pay the woman would not honor the price. When she called in the hostess to ask her, the hostess explicitly lied and said she in no way told us there was reduced cover. The attitude of the women collecting cover was something else as well. She had this horrid bark and would yell at the customers. We were trying nicely to talk to her, yet all she could do was scream back in return. Disgusting attitude and ridiculous prices.

Full disclosure: I've only attended on weekday nights.Firstly, the music selection is largely house, though at the moment Toca Tuesdays bumps more traditional hip-hop. I've been really impressed with the sets (residents and guest DJs alike). The sound system is also phenomenal. On weekdays at least, it seems to be about the music and the dancing more than the name behind the booth.The crowd is perfect. I get the feeling it's a lot of house OGs who have been coming to Cielo for over a decade. Nearly everybody is there to dance, though sometimes it takes an hour or two for the dance floor to fill out.The staff are congenial and helpful. When I forgot to close my tab I was let back into the club no problems.The drinks are not cheap but with a generally free/low cover if you arrive early, you get more than your money's worth if you like the music.

77,Tara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,4,0,1.0,5/4/2015,"This place confirmed my opinion on the NYC nightlife scene - IT SUCKS!!! (I had to give it 1 star because Yelp MADE me....in reality it deserves NOTHING)I would not even recommend this place even to my arch nemesis.Where do I begin? If you've ever wondered what hell is like, go to Cielo. There it is. Hell smacked right into your face.Previous to coming to NYC, I asked friends on the east coast, what NYC's best nightclub is. Having previously been to Pacha, I told them to recommend me something else - 10/10 recommended Cielo, so I had high hopes going in. Let's just say that my friends must really hate me if they recommended this place.I came here the other week for the Subculture NYC pre-party - first off the outside of the club is beyond sketchy. There's construction going on and the entrance into the club is so small that you could walk right by it and not see it.The first thing I thought of when I stepped into the club was ""I done f***ed up and landed in Miami Vice"". It was like a failed attempt to be a Vegas club - truth be told, this place looks better in pictures than it does in person. I go to the bar which is right at the entrance and order a drink (Adios Motherf**er/AMF) - the bartender said she doesn't know how to make it, so I pulled out my phone to show the her the ingredients. She then claimed she didn't have the ingredients and refused to serve me (Ummm....it's a freakin long island with blue Curacao!!). After waiting 10 more minutes, I was able to flag down another bartender to make me the same drink (which was weak and more watered down than Joel Osteen's gospel presentation).I then proceeded to meet up with my friends who were at the front of the club near the booth. As I was walking a sloppy drunk chick bumped into me and made me spill my drink all over the both of us (mind you this was around 11:30 pm so the night was still young). To top it off, as I'm wiping myself off, I feel someone grind up behind me - I turn around and look only to see a 70 year old man (YES - 70) trying to dance with me. Sorry honey, but you're gonna need about 7 more 0's in your bank account before I even talk to you, let alone dance with you.The club is literally the size of my closet, so as the next hour went by, the sardine can of a ""club"" kept getting more and more packed. To top it off, there was no fan or air condition going on - this place became hell in the most literal way possible. It got so packed that people were taking more shots to the ribs than being in a ring with Mike Tyson.As you walk into the dancefloor, you're slapped across the face with strobe lights which I'm sure will induce a seizure - imagine yourself in that scene in the original Willy Wonka where they're on the boat and going through that acid trip tunnel - now imagine that scene extended and molded into a club, and then imagine wanting to kill yourself and everyone around you as each second passes. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW CIELO IS.After staying for an hour, I told my friends that I couldn't take it and that I wanted to leave. They tried to convince me to stay by buying a table for our group of 30 friends (most of which were from LA or SoCal) so I obliged. The ""table"" was so small it literally only fit about two people and since the tables are on the dancefloor (with no velvet rope or bouncer around it), we opted to buy TWO tables on the other side of the DJ booth.Now let's get into the bottle service itself - the Bride of Chucky reject bottle service girl was rude and unprofessional - she never came by to check on how we were doing, and on top of that, they tried to make my friend who paid for the table, walk ALLLLLL the way across the club to sign a receipt. REALLY? Needless to say I will NEVER come here again. If Jesus himself came down and offered me the position to rule the entire world, I would say no. This was literally one of the worst clubs I've ever experienced - even all my friends from LA thought the same thing as well. I've never seen a group of people so much more miserable at a club, than I did that night.If this is the ""best club NYC has to offer"", then I don't wanna know what the worst one is.",40,56,25
78,Dolly G.,"Springfield Township, NJ",0,8,1,1.0,7/25/2015,Had to give it one star because Yelp forces you to.Went to this place with my cousins and my husband to have a good time on a Sat night. This club is a disappointment for NY nightlife. Music is really crappy and boring. They charge cover about 30-40 dollars based on their mood. Also the cocktails here are 20 bucks which I personally feel is on the higher side. The woman at the door is so rude. She wouldn't even look at you or greet you she just wants the cash.

Drinks were pretty pricey as well, but it's NYC so that's a given.- Music was fine. It was mostly EDM and trance music.- The strobe lights and stuff were crazy but pretty cool. Felt like I was having a seizure though haha.- The club itself is pretty small as is the dance floor. Many people were dancing but it was a very weird crowd.- Bathrooms were clean and had a few amenities.- Bartenders were friendly and fun!- Have to pay for coat check.

83,Sam M.,"New York, NY",52,26,3,2.0,4/24/2015,"I'm publicly shaming businesses that refuse to serve water for free. Cielo has a policy to not give free water, but only has (miniature) bottles of Evian for $6 plus forced 20% gratuity. I don't care if this is Meatpacking - it's incredibly rude and offensive to customers (and unsafe). I actually thought this was illegal and a built in stipulation to most liquor licenses. Unfortunately this is not the case. If you have plumbing, you should be obligated to provide water at no charge (especially if you're already buying other drinks).So disappointing they decided to be inhumane about this, because everything else (the sPeAkErSSS and the BASSSSS) was great! When I got tired I hopped up on a subwoofer and hung out for a bit, felt like I was riding an earthquake!!(posted similar review on deejbase.com)",12,4,3

We were group of 10 and took a table for $1000 which included two bottles of grey goose and a scotch.  It was pretty packed, but the crowd was decent completely. The reason I am giving 4 star is because, I felt it little pricy, plus the table that we paid for was not worth it as it was right at the edge of dance floor. And so random people kept coming, and kept sitting on it, sometimes even having a drink or two. It was so dark and that we couldn't even notice sometimes. But yes, I would def try it out once again during a random weekend just to see how it is during a normal weekend.",,,

The best sound system, great and fun lighting sequences, place is clean including the dance floor all through out the night, it never has that stickiness which grabs on to your foot and twists your ankle like some other clubs in NYC, no matter how crowded the dance floor is. For the dance enthusiast a nice clean sticky free dance floor is very much appreciated. The crowd very fun and professional, no bother. Awesome DJs and music played, new and latest techno, house, trance, and club beats. The best DJs such as Thrillseekers. This is a club that I can stay at through out the night till closing, the music and sound keeps the night fun and interesting. And to mention, I left my wallet with significant $$$$ on the coach and did not realize it was gone till 30 minutes later. Someone was kind enough to turn it in to the bar and those at the bar returned the wallet to me. Honest venue and patrons.",,,
93,Liam V.,"Staten Island, NY",15,16,0,3.0,7/26/2015,"I have only been to Cielo once and it was to visit a close friend who was spinning there that night (among some of his other crew). I went there with my girlfriend and paid 30$ for myself to get in and 25$ for her as well. The forced coat check was to be expected. That was an additional 5$ but luckily I was able to add my girlfriends coat with mine!  So before even getting busy on the floor I was already down 60$. The arrangement of the place is confused. It doesn't know whether or not to be a lounge or a dance club!  I will say though once you're on the dancefloor the sound is great!  Their Funktion One speaker system absolutely flourishes in the middle of the dancefloor. Lots of nice lights lasers and smoke too (which I simply adore). So the vibe was good, crowd was a mixed bag of people who clearly either don't like house music or didn't have any other ideas about their Saturday night.  Mostly men as well but when you get into the techno and house venues that is ALWAYS the case.  Mostly men love techno and house, it's a reality of the underground scene that some folks clearly haven't grasped yet. The main reason I gave Cielo 3 stars is the absolute ripoff prices of their drinks. I normally don't drink when I go to dance because I typically explore much better drug choices to be on that keep me dancing and having a great night without spending a fortune on alcohol just to vomit the next day!  So to say the least I may be a bit biased against buying drinks when out at a club because I normally don't. So I bought 4 drinks total. 2 shots of fireball and 2 Long Island Iced Teas.  The total?  79$!!! Insane. I've been ripped off at the China Club before and other similar scummy spots but then looking at the bill and seeing that these sludges add 20% gratuity to their tabs is a very underhanded way to force tips. That's not how the world works, you serve drinks well and have good customer focus you get good tips!  This place is crazy for making that choice mandatory. Overall not a bad spot but not a good value for that amount of money spent. I spend waaaaaay less at Output and that place absolutely destroys Cielo. Same owner too interestingly enough. The advantages are so much higher, I can park in Williamsburg easily and don't have to pay a mandatory 20% gratuity charge if I do want a drink. Meat packing district has never done it quite  fairly in general anyhow, no parking anywhere even though the city hasn't packed meat around here in over a decade.  If you plan on going to Cielo you better pregame accordingly and have a great car service for the winter.",1,1,

97,Ed A.,"Jersey City, NJ",239,386,43,3.0,12/4/2013,"I popped into Cielo one night, unexpectedly (then again, any night that begins with Kumo Sushi should probably not have any expectations). I was with 3 other dudes, but luckily this presented no problem at the door. $20 cover for everyone if I recall correctly (guys and gals alike).  No line, although admittedly we were a little early (around 11pm).The inside was dark and, for lack of a better word, cozy. The main bar was on the outermost section of the club, with VIP tables and a dance floor farther in. There were a couple of birthday / bachelorette parties going on that night, and in general people seemed to be enjoying the scene. The house music was pretty decent as well. Nothing about this place made me want to gouge my eyes out or burn a small city to the ground (for something along those lines, see ""Marquee NYC"").Overall, nothing to really hate on this place (besides the small size), nor anything that really wowed me. 3 stars",1,,1
98,Shani T.,"Boston, MA",148,232,124,5.0,3/24/2015,"Yes, Cielo, yes. If I could live anywhere else besides my own apartment in NYC, it would be in Cielo. Not that I'm not already here most weekends already (once a month for Trance.Here.Now. guaranteed, with certain bouncers telling me ""you come here a lot, don't you...?""). I have so much to say about Cielo I don't even know where to begin.1) The vibe here is amazing. Almost everyone who goes to Cielo, is there for the music and to dance. All good vibes, all fans of the music.2) The space is so intimate! When you walk into Cielo, you'll be met wth a rectangular (almost square) space, and that's that. The bar is at the back and the DJ booth is directly across the room from it. I've gotten to interact with my favorite DJs on many occasions here and this is very hard to do at other venues.3) The amazing Funktion One sound system here is literally one of the best in Manhattan (and, dare I say, better than most places in Brooklyn as well). Due to the intimacy of the space, you really feel the bass vibrations when you're in the middle of the dance floor, and the sound is so so so crisp it's amazing.4) Trance.Here.Now consistently brings in amazing acts. As a huge trancehead, this is my scene. This is my home. Esscala also brings in a lot of acts to Cielo, which only makes the place even more amazing.I normally always buy tickets in advance for shows, but have paid cover for regular Wednesday/Thursday nights here. It's never too much of a hassle. Only for super popular Trance.Here.Now. shows will they match tickets to IDs and charge ridiculous prices at the door ($60 for ilan Bluestone?! I mean, I would pay that in a heartbeat anyway, but thankfully I got my $20 ticket online...) Coat check can be kind of annoying, as it's right by the entrance down a narrow and short hall, but fairly efficient. They do make you check coats and bags no matter what in the winter, but I've seen some people give the bouncer puppy eyes and get away with not needing to check their coats.There's a nice smoking area outside in the back near the bathrooms (which are kept very clean, though there are few stalls and the women's bathroom can be a bit of a wait), which is also perfect for just sitting and chilling during the warmer days as well. While buying tables is possible at Cielo, I don't consider it much of a thing and have frequently sat down on the nice couches surrounding the dance floor on less busy nights without getting told off.Lately, Friday nights have been extremely crowded. I miss the days of Trance.Here.Now on Thursdays, but to be honest the crowd is always one of the nicest you will encounter, never insanely crowded like some other places (ugh, Pacha), and it typically clears out a lot around 2am.My biggest gripe about Cielo is that water costs $6 and is pretty much the smallest bottle you can receive (it's one of those mini ones).Cielo, keep doing you. I took my friend from SF here and she loved it. Highly recommend anyone that's into the music scene to check out Cielo--it's honestly such a timeless venue.",2,,1

103,Manny C.,"Hayward, CA",1,7,0,1.0,1/17/2016,"Honestly way too much money for small drinks. The coat check was said to be ""mandatory"" by the staff member behind the cash register who yelled at whomever didn't want to check their coats. Because although it was ""mandatory,"" they had large signage indicating they would not be responsible for lost or damaged items. Finally, the security guard and cash register had poor communication with one another, despite just being about 3 feet apart, which resulting in the guard placing their hands on you and pushing you back despite the cash register staff saying you could enter into the club. It's difficult to appreciate the fog, lights and disco balls when getting in is a hassle and the small drinks are too expensive",3,,1
104,Steph W.,"Manhattan, NY",191,122,60,1.0,7/23/2014,"Come here at your own discretion, there are pickpockets here and the club knows yet does NOTHING to salvage the situation. I have conquered all clubs in NYC at one point and wanted to give Cielo a try. Came here on a Friday night for deep house, paid the $20 cover, but then decided to get a table with my friends. The club isn't spacious but there wasn't much of a crowd that night. I was having a good time until I realized that my phone was stolen. My friend saw a man take it out of my purse, when I realized he ran out the door. My other friend also got her phone taken. To clarify things, I was still sober when I realized it was gone. We confronted security and the bouncer, to which they responded that they knew about this ongoing situation but couldn't do anything to fix this. To break it down, my conversation with security went something like this:Me: My friend and I just had both our phones taken by some guyBouncer: Yes, I saw him just leaveMe: WHAT?! Did you stop him?Bouncer: No, I did not. He was wearing a backpack and hoodie when he left.Me: Ok, so you didn't check his backpack? Bouncer: No. As you can tell the conversation was extremely dull and pointless. Essentially, the thief left with our phones in his backpack without having it checked when the security knew it was him. Who brings backpacks to a club anyway?! From then on I promised myself to never come back. Plain and simple, thieves are welcome here.",18,3,2

Updated review","Deep Space at Cielo is the best party in NYC, without a doubt.  Francois K.'s mixes are the stuff of legend. I've never heard a dj flow in such a genius way between genres. I guess that's why he's been credited as being the best resident dj in the country. He gets the best sound out of Cielo's jaw dropping Funkion One sound system (still the best sound system in NYC). The guests are incredible too. I often discover dj's there waaay before they hit much bigger levels of popularity. All the guests play really eclectic Deep Space sets which makes it all the more compelling and creative.  I love the crowd too. It's such a great mix of real dancers, warm locals, costume-culture folks, pan-sexual everyones,  and plenty of international music heads. We love getting there early, when there is time to really stretch out on the dance floor. I always feel like I'm with family when I go. Truly a special vibe every week! This is such a gift.",,,
110,Rex F.,"New York, NY",36,84,0,2.0,4/11/2014,"Everyone's got that one friend who has that one CRAZY apartment, where all of your other friends want to hang out because you can actually sit and talk and eat crackers and drink shitty wine without your face jammed into your bestie's neck sweat. Now imagine one night you go over to this friend's place and you find out he/she's invited over all these people you don't know, and has ripped out all the ceiling lights and duct taped them to the walls. He/she has also spent a bazillion dollars on some kind of insane sound system that is vibrating the paint off the crown mouldings. And right when you think your friend might have had some kind of work stress-induced psychotic break, he/she walks up and shoves some ecstasy in your mouth and you're like ""oh shit I don't know if I'm OK with thRRAAARR LET'S DANCE MOTHERFUCKER.""That's Cielo.I heard they have a Funktion One sound set-up here and I believe it. Music is excellent here. BIG low end, solid mid range and clean highs. It's just TOO small for the crowds it wants to have. The apartment metaphor is not a joke, being that the space is about the size of a big suburban living room. So you get dance music but you can't dance much. Cattle car, sardine can, stepping on your foot and elbow in your drink, fire code type situation all night long. And they're expensive drinks too, so you don't wanna be having no rolling-face rave-bro or rave-ho putting their sweaty extremities in it, namsayin.",10,17,4
111,Donald W.,"Manhattan, NY",169,178,355,5.0,3/30/2015,"Cielo is by far one of my favorite dance clubs in the city! It's a smaller sized venue, that really goes to show that it's not about the size of the location that makes things exciting but more so the energy and the crowd that comes through.Every single time I have been there, pretty much everyone was dancing. Anyone that says they didn't see many people on the dance floor, just weren't there late enough because it starts off slow, then once 12 am and beyond hit, it gets really busy. A lot of really fun and friendly people come through all the time and you get the full gambit of all that you could expect. Friendly dance battles, smoke screens, lasers, incredible DJ's, and an awesome MC that works to keep up the hype.I even went there this one time and they had a live band playing bongo drums to go along with the music.

I was never informed of this ahead of time and did not see any conspicuously posted signs (or any signs at all ) stating that there was an automatic gratuity.

126,Diana Z.,"New York, NY",63,32,35,1.0,4/1/2015,"***Update***I originally posted this on March 10th but two days later, the club called the person who invited me to his weekly night there and asked that I take down my review. I complied since I didn't want to interfere with my friend's event for its duration during the month of March. In my opinion, however, this request implies that the establishment understood that their behavior was unacceptable.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've been to Cielo many times for various events and I've never been insulted by management like I was tonight. It's currently spring season so I was only wearing a light jacket that was part of my whole look. The very nice bouncer inside informed me that I needed to check my jacket. Now, I have been going out in NYC since the early 90's and this is always been a point of contention. Generally, it's something that can be bypassed once I explain that while I understand a club who's policy is a mandatory coat check, it has to be complimentary. No one can allow complimentary entrance into an establishment but then demand payment for a service without giving the patron a choice. The manager had to be called and he wanted to deny me entrance to a party my colleague was hosting. I found this behavior deplorable and horrible customer service. No place is nice enough to be treated so poorly. Don't go to Cielo, a better time will certainly be had elsewhere. One star is one too many.",15,4,3
127,Sarah K.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",168,179,252,5.0,3/17/2014,"This is by far my favorite club in Manhattan.  There is no pretentious attitude at the front door keeping you outside in the cold for no reason.  If there's space inside, they'll get you in.  The dress code is lenient and the staff is friendly.There is a small outdoors green space for smokers or for those just needing a quick break from the club vibe.Drinks are standard Manhattan prices. Above anything, the sound system in here is amazing!  It has a full, warm sound.  It envelopes the dance floor, which sinks in a couple of steps below the seated/bar area.  Above the dance floor are not one but MULTIPLE disco balls!  Woo!The ambiance of this club lets everyone get down however they want.  This place is a lot of fun, and because the sound is great, I plan on going back again and again.",2,,1
128,Nicky J.,"Narragansett, RI",29,101,2,3.0,7/6/2013,My experience here has varied since the vibe can get a little strange depending on the crowd. I saw Oscar G last month and he was great but his presence attracted an odd past their prime crowd who all wanted bottle service and would freak out if anyone got near their table maybe because they were allergic to people under the age of 35. In terms of the venue it is really clean and unpretentious which are rare nightclub traits. I go to clubs to dance so I'm drawn by the great sound system and the fact that there's usually room on the dance floor. My major complaint is probably the layout of the place its fairly small and doesn't flow well. Theres only one bar on one side of the club right near the entrance and it seems to be cut off from everything else. The bar itself is small so it's always crowded and you have to devote considerable time to getting drinks. In addition theres really only one or two narrow paths to exit the dance floor so its always congested making it hard to move around. The club is not very discriminating about letting people in and I was really surprised how many bros were there because crowd was close to 3/4 men. I never really appreciated having the appropriate ratio of male to females in a club until the sweaty bros started grinding up on us and stalking my girlfriends around like they were hunting wild game. I wouldn't come here on a techno night for that reason and wouldn't pay the cover unless there was a DJ I liked. Check their website and FB page to see if they have a signup list so you can avoid the cover. At the end of the days its worth checking out just be sure you look at the schedule ahead of time so you can anticipate the crowd and like a lot of nightclubs in the city the party doesn't start till around 1.,7,2,1
129,Mohib Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",162,410,3617,4.0,5/22/2011,"Perhaps you've seen this place in the movie Get Him to the Greek. A small club for most coming from Los Angeles, I came here with my buddies Danny, Jeff, Jimmy, and Adria as we were ushered without a line. No bouncers, no wait, and within minutes coat-checked we rolled right into a busy night full of people having a great time. Blaring house music, I was immediately relived to not be experiencing the usual tones of Top 40 music being remixed and played repeatedly. Upon hearing the immediate complaint from one of my friends about the prices of drinks, and having little room to move two feet in any direction, I began to have mixed feelings about the place. Regardless of my emotions, the dance floor was absolutely packed with happy and pumped people. Moreover, the ambiance provided for a refreshing double-take. The paneling was dark wood, mixed with black, and the usual lounge equipment was already nice, but the use of bamboo, step down dance floor, and frosted glass just made this place look cool. I didn't find too many ""bros"" here, but the crowd was definitely young enough to be looking for trouble. I didn't care though, because I had a great deal of fun as did my friends. Despite not being able to hear each other because of the blaring music, we all agreed that this place is good for a club hopping night, or perhaps when it is less crowded. I might be back, but only after exploring a greater part of the city.",7,5,4
130,Davide C.,"New York, NY",1,8,1,1.0,3/22/2015,"Worst Saturday night ever in a New York's club.We went here to celebrate the birthday of one of my friends. He reserved a table, total cost 700$. Then around 2 am my friend started to feel a bit sick. He went to the restrooms, all the cabins were closed. He felt dizzy and he throw up for a few seconds in the urinators. Result? He got kicked out. The bodygouard didn't want to listen to us. I understand that it's something you should avoid doing in a club, but it is not excuse for treating people like shit, especially when they have spent $700 and stayed for only a few hours in the club.  Avoid this place.",5,,1

But then the crowd... boys with Tshirts and jeans everywhere! Maybe 3 quarters of people are ethnic minorities (Indians, South Asians). I like diversity. But that place that night, it was just so wrong!The size of dance floor is fine.

What more could you ask for?The only thing that is that cover and drinks are pretty expensive, which on a lot of nights is a turn off when I'm just looking for a good spot to have fun at in Meatpacking... but Cielo is pretty much the best choice for that, so it makes sense that they would charge so much, even for girls.

Well, it is, and oh boy, I wish it didn't.This night was a strange mixture of 80's music (which I like btw), and a dark place with no real theme and such a weird atmosphere. Maybe I am over the age for the place, or I don't know what, but it was a sad night.Maybe they have better nights, or maybe the place just had better days, but I will never set foot at the Cielo on a Friday night again.

141,Thiago D.,"Newark, NJ",56,21,2,5.0,1/29/2013,"This is hands down my favorite club in NYC. Here are the reasons why:1. They book the biggest names in electronic music. I've seen the likes or Roger Sanchez, The Martinez Brothers, Marcos Carnaval, and many other international DJs here.2. They have the best sound system - Funktion One to be exact. The system is so crisp that it'll make your soul move with their thumping bass yet you can still have a clear conversation with the person next to you. The dancefloor was perfectly made to enhance the music vibrations.3. The ambiance. This club is definitely one of the classiest places in NYC from their decor to the way it is set up. 4. No douchey bouncers. I have come here many times and have never been denied at the door for not having enough girls and/or other reasons. 5. Great deals. Although drinks can be expensive, there are several nights when they have open bar until 11pm which makes for a great pre-game for an amazing night.",12,1,6

We had always had a good time going out in the meat packing district, so figured we couldn't go wrong with a club there, but we were wrong. On a Saturday night, the place was 90% guys. And the bouncers were clearly just letting anyone in, the crowd was not what you would expect at a night club in the meat packing. We had ordered two bottles, so against our better judgement we decided to stay for the night in the hopes it would get better but it did not. I was really embarrassed for having picked the place and will not be coming back anytime soon.I would say save your money and just go to any of the hundreds of other bars in meat packing and you will certainly have a better time.

Good service and a clean venue though ensures they're working for your money, but I just don't think it's quite worth it.Dance floor is kind of weird. But that's probably just me.Doesn't look like I'll be heading back any time soon, especially with Output, TBA, Verboten, and BLK Market getting all of the good techno bookings nowadays.If you don't have anywhere else to go and someone good is playing, stop by this place.

It was like walking into hell.My friend insisted we go here as she had been a few years ago and enjoyed herself. This is also after she told us most places in NYC don't charge a cover. We are from Boston we are used to the standard 5-10 so i was pumped to be in NYC where they don't charge cover at all. Well unfortunately she must have been mistaken because we paid $25 to get into hell. I wanted to legit turn around and walk out when i heard the cost. But my friend insisted. We went straight to the bar and the drinks were outrageously priced in tiny glasses. Not to mention i have never seen uglier people in my entire life. I thought bartenders were always pretty people, not here. My friend and her sister want to check their coats i was holding on to mine in this sketch ass place so it's $3 a coat my friend pays for hers and her sisters $6 total hands the girl a $20 and the girl just keeps calling up the next people sorry hunny we aren't on drugs like the rest of the people here we'll notice when you don't give us $14 in change so my friend finally gets her change after asking and having to wait for the girl to get her ish together. The music was horrible i hate house music in general but can usually stand it not here and with the strobe lights going off in yours eyes it's like you're having a seizure. It was just miserable. There were couches lining the whole perimeter of the place so i asked one of the bouncers if we could sit without getting table service and he said that was fine so we sat for a bit and i needed shots to with stand this place. Go up to the bar ask for 2 red headed s*** shots and a vodka red bull. Give her my card get the receipt and it is $57 i was outraged my friend asked how much the shots were and they were $16 each plus like 14 for my friends drink which is only $46 oh they are so nice as to add on a 20% + tip themselves. Is that even legal? I was done after that and just wanted to leave.The bathrooms were disgusting; some girl was trying to walk into everyone's stalls because she had lost her MK bag.

Updated review","Over the past 3 years I've become a huge fan of 107.5 WBLS and listen religously to the station. I was happy to have discovered Roots NYC listening one Friday night and soon after found out about their residency at Cielo. Unfortunately I could never make it due to my work schedule. However, just in time for their 11th anniversary, the stars aligned and I was able to finally check it out. Cielo, though a small but intimate venue, boasts one of the best sound systems in the country.

He's a huge house head and had wanted to come to this Wednesday night party for a minute.  Complimentary admission before 11pm but because I was at home reliving my youth, there was no way I would make it on time so I paid the $20 cover.  They have the standard ridic protocol.  Wait in line to make the place look like the most inaccessible sexy spot on the block when in fact it's hardly full inside.  Oh the sacrifices you make in life.  The space is much smaller and intimate than I imagined it would be but it worked perfectly.  Perhaps the Roots party attracts a less douchier clientele than your typical Meat Packing crowd because everyone was dancing and having a good time.  None of this ""I'll stand in the corner and bob my head because I'm too cool"" ish going on. Drinks are standard expensive prices for the area but what made it crazy expensive was the mandatory 20% gratuity.  Oh that's kinda whack.  Music was on point though and we had a great time.  I can't speak for other nights but Wednesday night certainly delivered.",3,7,1

I can definitely see that you'll probably have a much better experience at this place if you are either a) a girl or b) a wealthy business man. Went to the bouncer, was asked if I had a ticket, I said no, after getting scoped out for a few seconds he decides to hand tickets to me and my group of friends. I didnt realize the significance of this until I got in the door and was told it was a $45 dollar cover unless I had a ticket. THANK YOU KIND BOUNCER. As a broke college student I didn't enjoy that the cheapest drink there was $12, but hey its the meatpacking district. A kind Brazillian man offered to buy me a drink and when I said to surprise me handed me a literal glass of grey goose with nothing in it. This turned into him buying myself and my group of friends $1000 bottle service. Basically, my experience at Cielo was one of the weirdest/craziest/most out of character nights of my life. If you are looking for that crazy NYC club experience then come here. Pros would be strong drinks, good DJs, and a pretty cool dance floor. They also do a good job of making sure it isnt too crowded.Cons are the cost, and the abundance of creepy foreign men grabbing at you.

Maybe it was based on their terrific sound system and DJ? Because we definitely did not have a good time. This was a Friday (a big ""no no""... locals don't usually go out on Sat & Sun because of the crazy crowds) but we had no problem getting in. As soon as my friend (also a girl) and I were in, we were immediately approached by men. It was pretty impossible to dance w/o getting interrupted or touched; and not the normal interrupted, but the pushy-interrupted. Sitting down made it even worse. I lost it when a guy picked up my drink and drank it as he tried to talk to me. Then that's when it hit me: the male to female ratio was like 10:2!! After we each took our $20 shots, we got in contact with a friend who took us to some of the local bars (East Village). Bars were not what we were expecting, but there we were able to have SO MUCH fun. If I could give you any advice, it is to look into more nightclubs than what lists claim are the ""best.""  Ask someone whom you know lives in NYC!I literally felt like meat in the meatpacking district.",6,7,

162,N T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0,1.0,6/20/2012,"I don't even want to give this place 1 star.For starters, the dance-floor gives off the aura of my 5th birthday party at Chuck E Cheese. The crowd is incredibly lame, full of bridge and tunnel jerks, Eurotrash, and wealthy old men getting played.Secondly, the place is overpriced. Ridiculously overpriced. I assumed a Jameson on the rocks would have been $10... uh, no. It was $15. PLUS there is a $4 ""rocks charge"". When I went to close my tap, I ended up spending $162 on ten drinks. The receipt was not even itemized and it did not list the prices of anything. We had to fight with the bartender to get an itemized receipt. When we did receive an itemized receipt, it turned out that they added a 20% gratuity and another Jameson no one had ordered. We had to fight to get the Jameson taken off, which brought the entire bill down to around $140. If we were anywhere else (or cooler), our drinks would have costed less than $100.THIRDLY, I just checked my bank account, and several days after the $140 was taken out of our account, Cielo attempted to take $120 out of our account. It is still pending, but WHY do they still have our information, and WHY did they try to charge us again? It wasn't even for the same amount we spent, so that makes it even shadier. They are con-artists. We just contacted Cielo and we received no explanation as to why there was an extra charge, and were told to just wait until Friday to see if the pending charge goes through.

Upon finding the place, I have a flashback to a couple of weeks ago when we had to wait in line for 15 minutes and pay cover to get in, we ended up not going. So my first trip here was a fail.This time around we waited for about 10 minutes and got in smooth without a cover, but we were on a VIP list. So my suggestion is to get on a VIP list and go during the week. Open bar from 10-11pm isn't bad, get in your four drinks and rave out. We went on a Thursday night around 1030, we didn't have to fight the crowds to get drinks, and it was still pretty empty. The crowd was mixed but mostly guys so being two girls we got some looks but no one bothered with us. I forgot that I enjoyed House music, so I enjoyed myself. There were too many crazy people. The music was pumping, but there was one song that was horribly screeching terror. For the most part the music was one point.The male bartender was great! The female one had an attitude problem. The glass had soap at the bottom of my friend's drink, she refused to replace it and said that someone put drugs in her drink and that wasn't her problem! Really!

This is the second time I have been served by her and had a horrible experience.I have been bartending / working in clubs for over 6 years (Miami/NYC) and never once I have I come across someone so arrogant and rude.Friday I went to Cielo to see a close friend perform a live house set and showed up about an hour and a half after my boyfriend had arrived. When I showed up my boyfriend had already had 4 drinks so I ordered 2 drinks on his tab before leaving. When we received the bill I saw a charge for ""ON THE ROCKS"" - $4.00. My boyfriend ordered Bulliet Rye whiskeys with soda all night, none of them being whiskey on the rocks, so I called her over and asked her why she charged him essentially for ""ice.""(ordering something On The Rocks is asking for it straight with ice, equalling about 2 shots over ice, which then he could be charged more due to the fact that it was more alcohol than normally served in a mixed drink) But, I know he does not order anything on the rocks while we are out and I am certain that this was clearly a mistake.. NOT TO MENTION EVERY BILL AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDES A 20% GRATUITY CHARGE. Therefore CLEARING any SHITTY bartender from not missing out on a tip regardless of poor or great service.Now, when I called her over to try and explain that she might have misheard him while he was ordering she looked at me and said ""He ordered whiskey splash of soda - that's 'on the rocks' don't tell me what I heard because YOU weren't here, this is HIS fault"" All while pushing her hand in my face and trying to reprimand my boyfriend. I then tried to calm the situation by telling her I understand what she is saying, however, I know this was probably a miscommunication considering the last 3 drinks he got were not charged for being ""on the rocks.""This is where is gets realllllllly funny. This woman stood behind the bar and cocked her head to one side, looked me up and down slowly as if the 4 1/2 foot high bar separating her and I was a moat separating a Queen from her peasants, and said to me ""OH! Okay, LISTEN - I'll take your FOUR DOLLAR CHARGE OFF YOUR BILL FOR YOU. Is that what you want?! When I take it off will you be able to AFFORD the rest of the bill?!"" all while screaming this trying to bring attention to herself (she surely doesn't need any more unwarranted attention I'll tell you that much.)She turned away, deleted the charge from our bill and threw it back in my face.I then handed her $97 in cash and said put the rest on my card (the total was $110) and she threw the money and card back in my face and screamed ""NO, NOT UH HONEY, NOPE I AM NOT DOING IT SORRY."" And stormed away. (ANNNNND, That is illegal to turn someone away in a Bar for the payment method they are using, whatever those methods may be, unless they are NOT paying the full amount, which I was not doing.)As a mature adult who has worked in this industry for years I did the only logical thing I could think of - I found the general manager. his name is David, and he was very kind, listened to my entire story and took care of the bill for me. I paid him the $97 in cash and he told me the rest was on him. I was EXTREMELY pleased with the resolution other than the fact that this psychotic bitch was not fired on the spot.The reason I am giving Cielo 3 stars is because I have been going there for years, I love the sound system and David was an incredible help that night.I hope Cielo's upper management reads this post because their business is run off of HOSPITALITY, and this bartender SHOULD NOT be working behind the bar or any bar for that matter. She insulted me, my boyfriend and herself with her attitude and I am certain I am one of MANY she has tried to belittle.

We opted to skip coat check and lined up to go in - only to be stopped by the bouncer who told us we must check our coats. So much for saving money! Where in the world is coat check ""mandatory""?

The downside: I have to dock 2 stars. One for the rude door staff and two for the ridiculously overpriced EVERYTHING. I had a comped ticket to see Victor Calderone and it still cost me $40 just to get in. They said it was cash only and the ATM machine's fee is $7.

Avoided what I've heard can be an annoying cover charge by RSVPing online under some guest list that my friend sent over to me from a coworker. But...nothing in life is ever really FREE, thanks to the ""mandatory"" $4 coat check...hmph. Also they had us wait in line a little too long considering how empty it still was when we got inside, but that's nightlife for ya. One thing that impressed me was how much I liked the staff, especially for nightclub staff. The guy who checked my bag found my flask (oops) and although he did dump out anything that was left inside, he promised to hold onto it for me until the end of the night which was definitely unnecessary, and super nice of him. Even the bartenders were pleasant, despite the crowd at the bar. They were attentive and got us our drinks quickly, and they made them STRONG. Like, really strong. Which is always a plus. What sucked was the automatic 20% gratuity put on my bill solely because I paid with my credit card (which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't $13 dollars for a vodka-club soda). So my advice is to spend a few extra bucks at the ATM and tip as you please. Venue set-up was okay, but the crowd was very foreign and kinda weird. Very guy-heavy, and most of them just stood around the dance floor, watching the few girls in the club dance with drinks in their hands. Those who did approach were kinda sketchy. Can't complain about the music but it was nothing that blew my mind. We ended up leaving early and heading over to the top of the Standard towards the end of the night since Cielo was nothing super impressive.Not saying I'd never give it another chance, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",2,,1

Updated review","so.....after the re-opening of Cielo last fall, everything seemed to have changed. I'm not sure if the place was closed down for 'renovations' as they said or if it was actually seeing a change in staff/ownership or whatever, but needless to say much has changed to make this place way less attractive (at least for me!);-door people have become extremely rude and at times inappropriate. During one particular visit, the manor with which the Cielo-Napoleon doorman was speaking with two of the girls in our group, made me wonder if he was on drugs (shamelessly trying to force a patron to take his #). -DJs spinning are not as high calibre. And it's not because the DJs haven't been visiting the City.-Crowd is still the same mixed bag.basically Cielo with the door attitude of Tenjune, rude staff, and a less attractive/more touristy crowd is just not that great!",4,1,
184,Mike H.,"Boston, MA",68,119,1,4.0,5/31/2012,"So I give the Meatpacking District a somewhat iffy vibe overall most of the time, but Cielo isn't half bad, or at least I had a rare good occasion. First off, I love the size of the space. It's small. They do a god job on keeping the right amount of people in, but you don't get an ultra-exclusive vibe from the place either. (Don't get me wrong, it's still a Meatpacking Dist venue so you're going to still want to be on your toes, but it's not impossible.) The sound system and house music playing all night was perfect. So many of the clubs play remixes of Top 40 songs which is great, but to consistently play house is rare and very much welcomed if you're in that kind of mood.Give it a chance, you may hate it, you may not. But put a bottle of Jack Daniel's in you before hand and you'll be good to go!",5,1,1

I also like the way the dance floor is set up and how there's seating around the edges of the club.A few issues I have with this place are the prices (and how they change at a whim sometimes depending on who's working the door) and the fact that sometimes they advertise open bar from 10-11pm but they won't open the doors until 10:30 (or later) and won't extend the open bar.The bathrooms stay pretty clean and the attendant is usually nice but sometimes they guilt trip you about putting more money in the tip jar. It's funny because if you don't put in any tip, they won't say anything to you, but if you stick a dollar in the jar, they start talking to you about their kids and family, thinking that you'll continue your generosity or something.

193,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",869,273,672,3.0,3/8/2012,"I wanted to like Cielo more, but it's not the be-all end-all I was hoping for. The first knock against it is that the drinks are insanely expensive. Yes, yes, I hear you everyone: ""Drinks are expensive everywhere in theeee cittyyyyy."" Seriously, not every club you go to charges you $15 for a rum and coke. They certainly don't automatically add gratuity on top of that, like they do at Cielo if you start a tab. I'm sorry, but saying ""drink somewhere else"" doesn't preclude me from rating Cielo accordingly. There are places where you can dance and drink without feeling like you need to sell an organ. Above all, you're getting a weak drink! If it was that sort of money and you got smashed after two drinks, ok, that's fair enough. But the drinks are 90% mixer. My other real complaint is the layout. I don't mind that it's small. I really don't. It works well with the sound setup they have, which is quite a good one. But it's a little strange to have tables in such close proximity to the dance floor. It encourages a lot more observation than dancing, and that can lend the place a bit of a strange vibe at certain points during the night. This is compounded by the odd crowd of late 30ish consultant types, early 30ish media 2.0 dudes, and mid 30ish Korean ladies who the other two groups compete for the attention of.That said, if you go on a good night, you can still have fun. Also of note, aka PROTIP!, if you rsvp to one of the lesser known acts, you can get in without paying a cover. I find that not paying $10-$20 just to dance makes things a lot more enjoyable.",8,,2

196,Joanna H.,"Culver City, CA",491,8,0,4.0,1/3/2012,"What a breath of fresh air!  Finally, a club in NYC that knows what a club should be like.  Went to Cielo Monday night for Deep Space and had an amazing time.Music: this is one of the best sound systems I have heard in general.  The music is loud enough so you can feel it, but it doesn't blow your ears out.  Some truly sexy house music was played :)Lighting: well done, Cielo!  Hovering over the dance floor are tons of disco balls which create a fun atmosphere.  There are tons of lasers and strobes (a bit much at times - especially if you've had a few drinks ;) haha) and even the walls light up at times!$: We had a flyer with us that was a promotion for free admission and complimentary vodka drinks before 11pm.  Not only was our admission truly free, but the bartender poured us free vodka drinks up until 10:58pm.  Our drinks were STRONG.  It was so nice to finally take advantage of complimentary drinks and especially after the watered down nastiness that goes around on NYE, this was such a nice treat.  Coat check was $2 and mandatory.  Drinks however were $17!  My friend bought one drink after 11pm and they billed him for his drink AND included gratuity (cheeky cheeky).  So, make sure you're well liquored up before (or find an awesome deal like we did).Atmosphere: There was a nice mix of people there.  The crowd was just bopping around, nice chill atmosphere to compliment the deep house music playing that night. If you get there early you'll be able to get a table.  Some are reserved but there are definitely quite a few places to hang out along the wall without a reservation.  Bathrooms were clean, attendant was friendly, and there was hardly any line.4 stars because as yelp says, ""Yay! I'm a fan"" but $$ is a consideration here and it is a bit pricey.  Look out for promotions or get there before the cover charge begins.  Overall an amazing night.  Thank you, Cielo!",13,,1
197,Mario D.,"Merrick, NY",12,8,2,1.0,5/17/2014,"I want to write this while I'm still in the bar so it stays fresh. This place is horrendous. The music is disappointing. The drinks are beyond overpriced, even for a city bar. Absolutely no dress code. I did not expect to be seeing capris and a sweatshirt at a bar where you pay a $25 cover charge. I officially know what it feels like to take a $50 bill and crumple it up, set it on fire, and piss on the ashes. I don't mind cover charges if I can put a value to it. I'm embarrassed to have brought my girlfriend to this bar.",2,5,1
198,Dani B.,"Charlotte, NC",252,2,0,4.0,5/22/2013,"Went on a Tuesday night for Q-Tip's BoogieBack residency (just for the month of May) As others have stated, the sound system is awesome and the drinks are expensive. I made it in around 11 because I didn't know what to expect for the line and ladies were free before midnight (no need for guest list.)  Lo and behold the bar was open for house vodka drinks until 11:45 or so AND there were free fried chicken wings (which were rather tasty.)To my luck, DaM-FuNk was the opening DJ and it goes without saying that the music was amazing. I danced my ass off all night and in a move I always appreciate -- the bar kept the tap flowing and I didn't have to spend money on bottled water. The dance floor is small but it suited the size of the crowd just fine that night. The bartenders and bathroom attendant were very nice and friendly; the bouncers seemed to be on a power trip. They were heavily enforcing a mandatory coat and bag check because ""there's no space inside for coats and bags"" but I slipped through with a smallish tote bag (in addition to my purse) and had no problem stashing it and my jacket on a couch while I danced. Did I mention I danced? I was glad to see a crowd that was willing to get out on the floor and move. A guy I ran into on the train home later said someone asked him for molly, and I was apparently quite fascinating first to a group of officey-yuppie types, then a band of young Russian guys, but the atmosphere and people were overall decent and not stuck up. I'll definitely make another visit on my next trip to NYC... and I'll remember to bring a flask.",,,1
199,Irene P.,"Manhattan, NY",95,104,16,1.0,9/24/2013,"Went here in a group of four Asian chicks. (Is it okay for me to say we four were all friendly and attractive? No self-aggrandizement intended.) It was 11 p.m. and fairly empty inside the club. Door lady eagerly demands we fork over $80 in cover charge cash. I hand her four comp passes. She scowls, then pauses. A lightbulb seems to click on over her head. ""Check your coats!"" she barks. It was 60 degrees out, we were freezing, and we had no inclination to bare any more skin than our mini dresses were already exposing. ""These are -blazers-, it's cold, and we're not undressing,"" we said. ""No coat check, no entry,"" lady retorts. Fine. We left.",21,12,7
