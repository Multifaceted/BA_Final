0,Alexander B.,"New York, NY",150,55,111,4.0,11/12/2018,"If you read nothing beyond the first line of this review, the chicken parm sandwich was beyond phenomenal.Admittedly, it's strange to see a Michelin starred chef develop a fast food restaurant.  However, Chef Michael Ladner (formerly of Del Posto) was quite clear that he believes Pasta Flyer occupies the same market space as McDonald's and Taco Bell.  With prices ranging between $3-$12, it's sure to save you some expense, but the food is far and away better than standard fast food fare.  As some others have noted, the location is not the most enviable.  Near the intersection of 14th street and 6th avenue, Pasta Flyer is certainly positioned to capture the commuter crowd who might be in the area, along with the tourists who have strayed just west of Union Square. Similarly, the crowd while I visited for a brief lunch was loud and messy, managing to spill a very full bottle of water over a significant portion of the floor, which speaks more to the quality of the consumer than of the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant, while not offensive, reflected a restrained budget and the potential for patrons who are there to consume calories, not partake in some kind of foodie adventure.  The Halloween decorations were a nice tough, however.  To order, just approach the host and order from the menu above.  You're given a number and you can choose any open seat.  Once your order is prepared, the meal will be brought out to you (if anyone is a Whataburger fan, they are familiar with this process).I ordered the well-hyped chicken Parmesan sandwich which lived up to all expectations.  Perfectly crisp and fried to perfect, the breading stuck to the meat throughout the entire meal, which reflects thoughtful and proper preparation of the chicken before frying.  The sandwich was well constructed and didn't fall apart, with just enough sauce and cheese to give you flavor without drenching the chicken.  The sesame buns were a little flatter than one might expect with a chicken parm, but this assisted with fitting the rather tall sandwich in your mouth without an issue. You could also tell the chicken was high quality, as it wasn't stringy or tough at any point.  If nothing else, try this sandwich. As many others have noted, the pasta is very good, particularly for its price point.  I ordered the fusilli with pesto, which cost an astonishing $7 (other pasta spots of lower quality can get away with $18 pasta and a $15 sandwich). Despite the bargain, the pasta was cooked al dente and the basil pesto gave a fresh, herbal kick to the bowl.  Between two people, the pasta and the sandwich was more than filling.  If replicable on a larger scale, Pasta Flyer has uncovered the secret to Italian fast food that isn't solely pizza.  I wholeheartedly endorse giving Pasta Flyer a try if you're in the area, or even making it a regular lunch option if you live or work nearby.  Pasta Flyer provides a very compelling argument that fast food can both be fast and quality, while not incurring astronomical costs that must be passed on to the consumer.",,,1

I ended up returning my third course because I could not eat sooo much fish! They were nice to replace it with potatoes and chickpeas but I was pretty much done by then. We just finished our dessert and left.I gave this experience 2 stars only for the service which was impeccable!",,,
2,Richard L.,"Rosemead, CA",240,3,0,5.0,10/18/2018,"I don't normally go to restaurants that are rated less than 3.5 stars on Yelp. But after trying Pasta Flyer out, I truly believe it is worth 5 stars. Their pasta is al dente, reasonably priced for the area, and came out in minutes. Their chicken nuggets (highly recommend these despite their unfortunate name) were perfectly seasoned, crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Yelp's aggregated reviews, but this restaurant goes to show that sometimes the best way to judge a restaurant is to give it a chance. Honestly, I'm writing this review because I know poor Yelp ratings can kill a restaurant and Pasta Flyer's restaurant experience is just too good for that to happen.Side note - if I still haven't convinced you, just look at how many Elite Yelp users are defending this place. When's the last time you've seen that happen?",2,,
3,Paul A.,"New York, NY",256,402,462,5.0,7/25/2018,"I personally found the pasta here, which is somehow miraculously gluten free, to be pretty much as a good as the last two Michael White restaurants I ate at. Also, I remember when this place was a popup and everyone was losing it on Eater and Grubstreet, but honestly, I like it more now. It doesn't have the best atmosphere perhaps and I am not crazy about this part of town but sweet baby Christmas this is really solid pasta and equally awesome sides.I only tried the rigatoni with meat ragu here and the broccoli raab, which comes with a dollop of fresh ricotta on top, and both were outstanding. It is like a story about a child who grows up and stays a child, who is as in awe of the world around her as when she first saw the earth. There is a kind of honesty and naiveté about this place, as if simply serving truly excellent food could be enough. I know, in this age and especially in our fair city, that this is never enough, that good food is irrelevant next to how good something looks on Instagram or how long the line is out front. But I can't say that, as I ate here, that thought didn't fill my eyes with tears.",2,1,
4,Dia Q.,"New York, NY",123,99,201,5.0,9/18/2018,"Well made AND well-priced pasta that I don't have to make myself?! Count me in! This place was started by chefs that have worked in some of the best Italian places in the city. It shows in their food. Whether you're a broke college student or not, you can enjoy a high-quality meal and not spend too much. Entering the restaurant, you have to walk up a small set of stairs or they have a chair lift. The decor is cute and eccentric: an Italian UFO landing site with a touch of feminine pasley prints. The wheat stalks evoke visions of crop circles while calling on the origins of what you're about to eat. Try the garlic knots; they will melt in your mouth.",,,
5,Michael V.,"Manhattan, NY",76,86,45,4.0,6/5/2018,"Reading some of the reviews - I don't know what people's expectations are. If you're looking for a full on 5 star Italian dinner - picking a fast food joint isn't your best bet.With that said. I think the food is great. I love the way the pasta is cooked, as well as the sauces/flavoring/seasonings etc. It has quickly become a favorite go to spot. Have yet to step foot inside, as I've mostly stuck to ordering. Give it a try! Ive had the Rigatoni & Nonna's Meat Ragu and the Fusilli & Petso, as well as the fried cauliflower. All delicious.",1,2,1
6,Lieselle B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",759,170,157,3.0,4/22/2018,"This is more of a 3.5 for me because this is one of the few spots near the union square area that does cheap, fast, and casual italian.Pasta bowls range from 8-10 and you get a decent sized portion. I tried the nonna's chicken parm sandwich which I really enjoyed with my first few bites, but I soon found that the chicken parm sauce had a spicy kick to it. It wasn't super spicy but I wish I was given notice of that prior to ordering. Also, the bread to chicken ratio was off and that bothered me. Overall this place is okay, i'll definitely come back to try a pasta bowl because of the prices.",4,1,1
7,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,2.0,4/17/2018,"Convenient? Yes. Clever idea? Yes. Good? Not really. Honestly pasta is the easiest thing to make at home, so I expected it to be as good as something I can easily make for about $6. But it wasn't. And it cost $9. I had the spaghetti & meatballs. Meatballs are baby (bite size) and I got 4. The pasta was cooked al dente. No issue with that. Maybe I expected more out of my spaghetti and meatballs that was ready in 3 minutes. I didn't try any of the sides, but not sure I'll come back to even try to. I think the concept is really a great idea. And I'm sure they're making a killing selling bowls of pasta that probably cost $1 to make! Nice seating area inside to dine in! Oh and they serve alcohol. Always smart.",2,1,2
8,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10947,4.0,4/9/2018,"I'm starting to become a fan of these convenient cafeteria style pasta places that make amazingly delicious authentic Italian meals for $10 or less. Mark Ladner previously was the chef at Del Posto and opened this fast-food style place for quality food at a reasonable price. They were written up in the New York Times and everything with rave reviews so it had been bookmarked for awhile.For our meals we split the organic fusili with a basil pesto sauce and the fettuccine with a creamy alfredo sauce. Thoughts: the fusili noodles were cooked better than the fettuccine. Both sauces were really good but I think the alfredo sauce tasted slightly better. For being only $7 or $8 the portion size was very generous and the food was well above average. Maybe not ""the best"" alfredo I've ever tried but for it's value - damn. One thing you do have to get here are their garlic dots. I've died and gone to heaven. They're warm, buttery, flaky, and an explosion in your mouth. We also had a side of the spicy broccoli rabe (which I mostly consumed because my dining companion is afraid of vegetables) but I loved this. It was both sweet and spicy with some kind of vinaigrette dressing and covered with a pillow of fresh ricotta to cut the bite of the vegetables. I'm such a fan. I have to come back because also we were told Chrissy Teigen orders from here all the time and loves their chicken parm sandwich. (Special of the month) I'm already envisioning John Legend saying 'hey, this chicken sandwich is clutch. Let's order from that pasta flyer spot again, babe.' and I can't mentally get this imaginary scenario out of my head.",5,2,5
9,Dan L.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",150,179,19,4.0,7/12/2018,"A fast food place where you can get a decent-ish meal for under $10 in one of the more expensive food neighborhoods in Manhattan. Not bad.There are *a ton* of complaints about this place on yelp, but the complaints don't really seem to make sense? A lot of people think the food should be half the price because they could make it at home for half the price, but that's also true of basically any sandwich, salad, or steak place, not to mention 80% of the menu at most ""ethnic"" restaurants if you're familiar with the cuisine. Who goes out an expects the food to be as cheap as you can make at home?The other half of the complaints are about how the food is terrible. That's ultimately a matter of taste, so I can't say for sure that those are ""wrong"", but I think people are comparing to food that's way out of the price range (and speed) of this place. This place has pricing comparable to Chipotle and gets you food in the same amount of time. I think the food is a bit better than you'd get at Chipotle; I could believe that people with different taste would say that it's a bit worse, but I don't think warrants giving the place one star. Maybe you'd say it's one star food if you compare to Pepe Rosso To Go, but this place is half the price even though it's in a neighborhood where food is more expensive. You shouldn't directly compare it to a place like Pepe Rosso To Go!",1,,1
10,Jake M.,"Indianapolis, IN",10,318,7,3.0,11/2/2018,"It's like this place doesn't know what it is, it's like Fazolis with a fresh coat of paint but without the awesome breadsticks. I was curious so I tried it, I got the Fettuccini Alfredo, for $8 all it was was a small bowl noodles with Alfredo sauce, it actually was pretty good but there needed to be more, more noodles, a piece of bread, something, the overall experience is lackluster, it won't last in a city with so many better options as is.",,,
11,Denise L.,"Queens, NY",457,140,183,4.0,11/23/2017,"I'm a fan of the fast casual phenomenon that is sweeping the city right now. Pasta Flyer is part of this trend, serving mix-and-match bowls of pasta and sauces using fresh ingredients. All menu items are $10 or less, and its proposition is that your order will be ready within 3 minutes.On my visit, I ordered the whole wheat rigatoni with the basil pesto sauce as well as a side of the baked eggplant parm. The portion was decently sized, and I was able to taste the quality of the ingredients. For $11, you can't really beat that anywhere else. From reading other reviews, it seems like there was a special offered which includes a pasta bowl, side, and drink for $10. I was not able to see this deal during my visit, so perhaps it was removed, but it would have been nice to have that offer as well.Friendly staff, nice ambiance, I'll be coming back!",5,,

It is good for someone who is not starving because the portions are not large but full with a seasoning sequence that makes your soul smile.  Since I was not super hungry, I only got the deep fried lasagna but man did it hit the spot.  The lasagna was crunchy but also soft, spicy but also sweet, great but also wonderful . In reality, it was the dipping sauce that made the snack. I am not sure what it was made out of but I am sure it was a handful of spices that are hard to pick off of a spice rack.Overall: Cannot wait to go back and get a different menu item but my initial trying of it was GREAT!",,,

Updated review","Pasta Flyer is finally open after several years in the making, and it's even better than it was at its brief popup in 2014.From chef Mark Ladner, formerly of fine dining restaurant Del Posto, the idea is for it to become like a McDonald's for pasta, but with actually good ingredients.It's a simple menu with just pastas and a few sides and everything is prepared super quickly. This is the year of fast casual pasta with so many others opening recently, and this one is definitely at the top of the list.",14,3,7
15,Franny A.,"New York, NY",840,1280,1046,3.0,10/31/2017,"Pasta Flyer brings fast food style Italian to the masses with major chef cred with Mark Ladner of DelPosto at the helm. Ironically, this spot was once a Chipotle. The good news is that the pastas and sauces are terrific and cheap. Otherwise,the pre-packaged foods are a turn off.Ate:Whole wheat rigatoni/ pestoBroccoli Rabe Side saladTotal: $16.24The only customizable and made to order foods here are the pastas. They are top notch. Yummy pesto. The salad with little mirepoix and cheese at the bottom was flavorless even with the blah dressing and the broccoli Rabe merely mediocre. Now, eating food already made and in plastic is a huge negative for me  but if you like value priced  pasta then this concept may work for you. Like Made Nice, credit cards only !

17,Grace F.,"Manhattan, NY",89,109,837,2.0,11/29/2017,"Ok I actually loved how inexpensive this place is!! It's the cheapest you can get pasta without cooking it yourself at home.  That being said the three main pastas we tried (fettuccine alfredo, pesto spirals & spaghetti & meatballs) were all inferior to the garlic dots & deep fried lasagna appetizer snack.  For a place to have pasta in its name one expects pasta to be its standout or at least not embarrassing.  The spaghetti & meatballs were the embarrassment of which I spoke.  The sauce is ketchupy & the meatballs both small & bland.  The alfredo was acceptably buttery (my toddler gave her approval) & the pesto spirals were mediocre at best.  The sides: broccoli rabe, cauliflower & side salad were also lackluster with cauliflower being the most tolerable.  Now for positives:  deep fried lasagna snack us yummy especially with the spicy dipping sauce--however it's smallish & at $4 a pop you'd need 4 to make up a whole meal.  The garlic dots were flaky & good.  Also on good end: dining area quite nice & as toddler friendly as you can get for not having high chairs.",,1,
18,Sen L.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",42,48,62,2.0,6/4/2018,"I've been here twice and both times I've been underwhelmed by the food. The garlic dots are nothing like garlic knots so be aware. They are more like greasy, garlicky zeppolis. I was not impressed. Too doughy/chewy for my liking. I thought the lasagna bites were yummy (I love them at Olive Garden) but thought they tasted a little burnt. I would have liked to give them a 2nd try but they were taken off the menu the 2nd time I went.My last time here I tried the chicken parm sandwhich and the mozzarella sticks. One thing I really dislike is that specialty items (like these) have no description listed anywhere. I had to ask an employee what the sandwhich consisted of: garlic bread, chicken cutlet parm with spicy tomato sauce and lemon zest.I found the sandwich unsatisfying - too spicy for me (why isn't it called Spicy Chicken Parm sandwich??), bread was thin, soggy, and too small for the meat, and lemon flavor was a total contrast to the tomato sauce. Also, the sandwhich was served to me in a tupperwear container. I was so confused! Why, just why??As for the mozzarella sticks - I quickly learned why they are only $2. It's because they only give you two! Great, thanks for the heads up. Also, they looked so weird!! I was kinda grossed out at first to be honest. It looked like some vegan version of a mozzarella stick, but no, there was cheese inside. It tasted okay (the cheese was good and had a lovely consistency actually but the breading was weird). Definitely different than a traditional mozzarella stick. I had to ask an employee before I left what was the deal with them. He just said it was the same breading as the chicken sandwich.I have not tried the pasta and I don't think I will. I've seen the portion sizes from other patrons and they seemed quite small.",,,

There's chipotle and Dig Inn, and then there's Pasta Flyer.I got the pesto pasta and it was surprisingly good. I also got a side and mixed it in with the pasta; I do feel that this meal probably would have been a lot blander without it. The pesto pasta really got the pesto taste mixed together well. Bad pasta makes it feel like you're tasting some bland carbs with some juice attached to it. Good pasta does exactly what Pasta Flyer does; blends it well.This meal didn't exactly set my tastebuds on fire, nor was I compelled to declare this the happiest place on Earth.

Updated review","I was pleasantly surprised by this place- it's more of a 3.5. My friends and I were starving and needed something quick and this satisfied just that. It's definitely what I would consider fast food pasta but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. I had the pasta with meat sauce with a side of spices broc rabe and a pellegr and it was under 20. The pasta was aldente and the sauce yummy and the portion fitting for the price (around 7 or 8 bucks). It was out in like 5 min so I guess most stuff is premade which makes sense because the menu is quite small. One thing I will critique is that the ""spicy"" broc rave side was anything but spicy. And the chicken parm sandwich my friend had was apparently extremely spicy (but the menus did not indicate that fact). Good place to go for a quick bite but only that... it's definitely not a date spot- you've been warned!",,,
23,Nick C.,"Manhattan, NY",67,526,235,4.0,3/22/2018,"I was taking a course nearby and when this was done, is was closer to a late lunch-early dinner. I passed by Pasta Flyer, looked at the special board and went in. It is a large space, more tall than wide and one wall has a picture of Rome, circa 1965. I walked up to the counter. The special that day was the organic fusilli with basil pesto, the side was a spicy broccoli rabe with sweet peppers and onions with a dollop of ricotta and this came with a bottle of acqua Panama. This was all for less than $10. It is extremely reasonable. I would recommend and return.",1,,

I tried their pesto and fusilli. The portion at first glance seemed small, but it filled me up more than expected. The pesto was really good, tasted fresh and very flavorful. The pasta was cooked al dente. For $7, it was definitely a nice quality light meal. I'd definitely go back and try the other pastas. No cash, card only.",6,3,6
25,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",232,801,242,3.0,2/25/2018,"Two stars for price, one star for food. Unfortunately, this place was a Miss for me. The pasta was poorly prepared -- I got the fettuccine alfredo and hub got the fusilli with pesto. My fettuccine was drowning in sauce, so much that it felt more like an Alfredo soup than a sauce, and noodles felt overdone in both dishes. I really liked the concept of this place, and the price point is awesome for a quick bite in the area, but honestly my own homemade pasta is more to my liking so I doubt I will be back.",,,

You can enjoy a delicious pasta in under 5 minutes for less than 10 bucks. It's a good meal for a good price.The fusilli with pesto sauce is my favorite so far. The rigatoni with pink sauce is also a go to. The eggplant parm, lasagna bites, and garlic dots are all solid sides. Chef Ladner was extremely nice and friendly. He offered my son and I cannolis stuffed with tiramisu cream and they were amazing! I'm still thinking about them. My son is still talking about his meal.

They have about 7 choices of dishes with the option of switching up the type of pasta for each dish if desired. There are also a couple of salads and several sides you can choose from. My friend and I both settled on the pesto pasta and decided on 2 sides to split. We got the eggplant parm and the cauliflower side. Everything came out relatively quickly and the things that needed to be cooked a bit more were brought to our table when it was ready. As we were about to dig in, a staff person came out and brought 2 more sides saying they were compliments fo the chef. He asked if we knew the chef and we did not! I still have no idea who he is or why we got lucky but we were thrilled! He brought out the fried lasagna and the garlic knots. We started eating and we were so pleased. The pasta was cooked perfectly and pesto was truly unbelievable. Seriously, SUCH flavor. I ate every last bite of it even though I was insanely full with are amount of food we had. The eggplant parmigiana was delicious as well. Great flavor and cooked well. No mushy eggplant here.  The cauliflower side was just okay honestly.  A bit underwhelming. The lasagna was delicious. I mean how can you go wrong with fried lasagna.  The garlic knots were almost like a savory garlicy zeppole. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. It's an interesting concept for fast food! I hope the expand on their pastas. Let's get some puttanesca in there!",1,1,1

I've tried the meatballs once. Those are great but I am not a fan of pork which they have in them. If you are a fan, I say give it a try. I tried the rigatoni the pesto is really good and not sweet. It's a pretty fresh pesto. It tastes even better with the Parmesan cheese on top. The Parmesan gives it that kick of salt it needs. The prices are good here for the amount of food you get. Also thank you so much to the front of house for actually taking the time out to recommend items on the menu based on your likes and dislikes.  The only thing I wish is that there were more toppings to put on the pasta.

I got the Nonna Loves You combo meal ($12), which included spaghetti and meatballs, a side salad, and a drink. The texture of the pasta was fine, but the 4 small meatballs were a little dense, the sauce could have used some more flavor, and the portion size was pretty small. The salad, which had arugula, escarole, radicchio, lentils, carrots, celery, and pecorino cheese, on the other hand was quite good.

My friend got the fettuccine Alfredo and chicken bites. My sandwich was pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way for it again though. I've had a much better chicken park sandwich at Parm. My friend's portion was very small and the chicken bites didn't come in the pasta. They were a side that came with what tasted like a vinaigrette which seemed odd to dip chicken into. I think this place is good in a pinch, but not somewhere you should travel to.

My friends pesto was lacking taste and her pasta was quite hard, even for al dente.We got the cauliflower appetizer which was unexpectedly cold? And the garlic dots were a little too soft and tasted/felt like a doughnut. I really wanted to like this place but honestly I would rather go somewhere else. It's 'inexpensive' and quick but the food is not good.",5,,

I ordered rigatoni with pesto and my boyfriend ordered fusilli with pesto and pastrami, and we both enjoyed it as a takeout meal. The sauce was flavorful and the pasta was al dente.

34,Lucie P.,"Manhattan, NY",11,17,129,5.0,11/3/2017,"I've been walking by the storefront for months and was so excited to hear they were finally open. I stopped by the day that they opened around 7pm and was surprised to see it wasn't too crowded. I ordered the Eat Your Greens meal combo ($10.88), which includes the fusilli with pesto, choice of side, and a drink. I went with the fried cauliflower with capers and raisins as my side, though it was a tough decision to make since they all sounded delicious (fried lasagna!). The food was ready within a minute and was somehow perfectly al dente and tasted like it came from a much fancier restaurant. The pesto was fresh and tasty and the fried cauliflower was way more than your average side veggie. Compared to other fast casual pasta places that have opened up recently, you really can't beat the quality of the ingredients and great prices for the amount of food. I'll be back to try out all the sides!",2,,

They also offer three difference sides (eggplant, broccoli rabe..) as well as garlic knots. Their garlic knots are different from your typical garlic knots and have a cake texture rather than your normal tough dough you find in NYC Pizzeria's. Definitely recommend to try if you're looking for a quick lunch. It's nothing special but great for a quick pasta run if you're in a rush. I would compare this to a chipotle for pasta.",1,,1

Portions are deceptively filling for a healthy person on a moderate diet, but if you are hungry definitely get a side. Ambiance is very laid-back and you can grab a fountain drink to loiter for a bit if you need to kill some time. It is a little confusing at first for cleanup since they bring the food to your seat but the trash cans are by the front so make sure you toss your stuff before leaving. For those who can't get over pasta being cheap and dishes costing 8-10, you are really paying for a decent sauce and a nice place to sit and eat.",,,

Reading previous reviews, the owner responded to other yelpers that their portion sizes have gone up and it really didn't. I had the fusilli with marinara with a side of meatballs and it was bland and not warm to the temperature I'd like it to be, also the inside of the meatballs were pink??  I understand it was beef meatballs but personally I don't like underdone meat. Perhaps they were meant to be that way? Worker at the cashier that rung me up was super nice and gave me an extra heap of cheese like I asked for. I went with 2 other friends and out of all 3 orders, mine was considered the best. In no way is this meant to bash the business but the food is not up to par even if it was to be a quicker way of grabbing pasta. Also the menu can be maybe adjusted?? Like list the pasta and the sauce separately and possibly give us more sauces and pasta to choose from?

When I opened it the sauce literally smelled like warm milk, was super runny, and actually gleamed with salt. I would guess the sauce is basically milk, an insane amount of salt, and a pinch of parm.

The place was not busy, the time I went.3= The fried cauliflower was good, but was missing more cauliflower, they should change the name for fried capers instead because it was more capers and chickpeas in this side order, also very small portion.

I went right at 5 when they open of week 1, so I'll cut them some slack, but they opened a few minutes late and my full order (pesto fusilli, side of cauliflower, and garlic knots) took about 5 minutes, not the advertised ""60 seconds"". The garlic knots were the bottleneck.Pesto fusilli: pasta was great. Portions are on the tinier end of what you'd expect but tastes awesome and honestly is still enough to be a meal.Cauliflower: cashier recommended this over the broccoli rabe, and I was a bit disappointed. Heavy caper taste overpowers the flavors of the cauliflower and chickpeas.Garlic knots: they're pretty delicious, can't deny that. But for $2.50 and only 3 per order (which btw, contradicts what I've read about getting 5 per order), not a great deal and wouldn't get them again at that price per knot.The staff are friendly but are still trying to get the hang of everything and have to direct people in an unnatural way (head chef stopped me mid sentence while ordering my sides, because apparently you only order your pasta first, THEN order sides at the cashier). They've got a process they're trying to enforce that still feels off.

72,Patti J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/25/2018,"I walked into Pasta Flyer and was pleased by the nice ambience and decor. Sadly, that's where the pleasantness ended.First of all, for a place with pasta in the name I wasn't overly impressed with the pasta. I saw one of the employees opening a WHITE PLASTIC BAG and dumping frozen pasta into individual containers. I'm talking a big bag you'd buy at Costco. I mean really??? If your main thing is pasta, try to have better standards than frozen pasta. The spaghetti and meatballs was decent, but in what way is $8.50 for a small-ish bowl of pasta ""affordable?"" I could cook the same thing at home for $5.00 and have three times the amount. The spaghetti was nicely cooked, but the meatballs tasted rubbery. The broccoli rabe was absolutely drenched in dressing, I mean I picked up a fork's worth and the stuff literally dripped off in globs. The garlic dots were basically fried dough soaked in melted butter. I got the chicken parm sandwich to take home and my husband wasn't impressed. The bread was thin and ratty looking, and the tomato sauce was unexpectedly spicy. I think it's weird that they don't accept cash. What about kids who don't have credit cards? They can't come eat there? Also I attempted to leave a tip but was informed they don't or can't accept tips, even on a card. I'm sorry...it's the restaurant industry! I insisted on leaving something but the cashier seemed almost offended. I've never experienced such a thing in New York City. Bottom line the place is nice looking, but the combination of mediocre food (a small bowl of frozen pasta for $8.50??) and no cash/no tipping policy really rubbed me the wrong way. Having fresh instead of FROZEN pasta, and real china instead of plastic bowls and forks would help this place immensely.",,,

The Organic Fusilli lacked flavor though so that was a little disappointing. All of that came out to be around $20. However after looking at each plate, I didn't think I got my worth. The portions are pretty small so for people who can't finish large dishes and enjoy having smaller portions, this is for you but I eat a lot so this did not fill me up. All in all, lesson learned.

They forgot to put some of my roommates sauce on the side for the ""to-go"" style. And my biggest complaint is that the portion is small and when looking at it in the bowl it looks sad. If they don't want to give big portions, they need to use smaller bowls. Or else fill it up so customers are satisfied. See my pictures attached from two different times that I went.

90,D C.,"New York, NY",0,18,3,4.0,1/25/2018,"The food here is definitely worth the price.  I had the rigatoni.  It was al dente and the meat sauce was good.  Also had a side of spicy broccoli rabe, which was good.  All the entrees were under $10, but the portions were a single serving, small compared to what I usually get.  I left satiated.  I would definitely come back to try the other pasta options.The dining area was relatively small.  The large table had a concave fixture which had sounds bouncing off at odd angles.  Maybe try to sit at one of the side tables.",,,
91,Vikas B.,"Montreal, Canada",0,9,10,5.0,1/13/2018,Great Italian fast casual by ex Del Posto chef - must try. Love the creamy Alfredo sauce. Very reasonable for great Italian. Pasta was al-dente just how we like it.,,,
92,Diem L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,18,0,3.0,12/2/2017,"When Mark Ladner was the chef at Lupa and then eventually at Del Posto, they had THE best pasta in town. His new venture Pasta Flyer, though not intended to be at that level, is just barely ok. Pasta is cooked al dante but sauces are pretty average. Fried lasagne is the thing here that could turn into a cult favorite if they played it right (hello instagram??). Also please hire someone to restyle the space and concept!! It's much too bland and generic, from the paper bowls to the much too basic layout and decor. Needs a stronger personality!! Which I know must exist given the fried lasagna and the cool selection of canned alcoholic beverages!!!",,,
93,Greg R.,"Charlemont, MA",38,5,6,4.0,1/8/2018,"Good, Fast & Cheap.  The saying goes you can have  two out of the three.   But guess what, here you get all three.  Started with the classic spaghetti and meatballs & side of broccoli rabe.   Outstanding.  Then had rigatoni with nonas ragu.  Also outstanding.   If I wasn't full I would try the fettuccine alfredo.   Next time for sure.",,,
94,Jessica L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,6/21/2018,"It's quick and the price is good, but the food isn't great. Pasta is very basic and lacks flavor. Place to go for quick basic pasta.",,,
95,J. K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/28/2018,"Unfortunately I got food poisoning from the Spaghetti and Meatballs here. (It was especially fun as a breastfeeding mother to a newborn baby). Even without the food poisoning, the meal was pretty yuck.",1,,
96,Ree M.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,44,0,3.0,12/18/2017,"Pasta was very tasty. I had rigatoni with ragu. I felt it was a small portion though. I can go to any pizzeria and get twice the amount of pasta for the same price. Also I asked for black pepper which they didn't have. What kind of a restaurant doesn't offer salt and pepper? They only accept cards and I understand their reasoning, but not everyone wants to use their debit card given the fraud that is prevalent these days. I feel they are alienating a certain demographic by doing so.",,,
97,Crystal L.,"Boston, MA",368,8,0,4.0,11/11/2017,Good quality for the price. The pasta itself is very good quality (imported straight from Italy). The options are not that expansive or inventive but are classic.  I personally ordered the organic fusili (the pesto was a little lackluster). The portions are also on the smaller side. But if you're looking for a good casual dining experience this place is perfect and on a whole I do recommend this place.,,,
98,Stephen D.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,28,1,5.0,2/18/2018,Pretty incredible. This was absolutely delicious and super affordable. The only reason there aren't more people here is because they don't know it exists.,1,,
99,Phil M.,"Edmonton, Canada",65,1,0,5.0,2/18/2018,Excellent pasta at light speed!!! Can't beat the flavor and especially not the price!,1,,
100,Michael W.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,5/29/2018,Really good option for high quality Italian food that is also cheap and fast. We tried a few pastas and a few sides and enjoyed everything. Food came out within five minutes of ordering.,,,
101,Matthieu B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",60,2,0,2.0,11/29/2017,"Small portions, pasta ok, no salt & pepper or Parmesan on the table...For pasta better cook at home...",,,
102,Sk R.,"Manhattan, NY",65,3,3,4.0,11/29/2017,Spaghetti and meatball was to die for. Awesome combination would definitely recommend going back to his place.,,,
103,Rosie G.,"Washington, DC",193,3,1,5.0,11/2/2017,"Loved the cauliflower! Pasta is fresh, in a convenient spot with a short wait. Also has a wonderful ambiance, great place to catch up with cherished friends.",,,
104,Kate W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,0,1.0,6/4/2018,"DOES NOT TAKES CASH  Walked many blocks to try this place out, only to discover it does not take cash. I did not have my credit card on me so I could not eat there. Never heard of any restaurant that does not take cash. The reason is supposedly hygienic but the person taking the cash was not the same person dishing out the food, so that reason does not make sense. On principle, I don't plan to return, even when I have my card on me.",,,
105,Phyl M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/15/2017,"EDIT: I originally wrote a semi-critical review of Pasta Flyer when it first opened and they were still working out the kinks. I'm happy to say that my complaints are now obsolete-- I've stopped by several times since and the food has been fantastic (and somehow, the service has even improved).",,,
106,Jeffrey P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0,3.0,1/19/2018,"The food is tasty and appears nutritious and the people are friendly and attentive.  However my $10 dish could have used a few more veggies to make it a truly filling meal.  Also, for a fast food restaurant serving wine at $7 a glass, the glass needs to be more full.  My recommendation for success is that the facade needs to be improved to make it look like an inviting restaurant.  From across the street, I could not identify it as a restaurant as it looked more like a residential building facade.  Perhaps a more colorful logo and a couple of flags would help.",,,
107,Yelp R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,5,5.0,11/12/2017,"Run, don't walk because as soon as this place gets known the line will be out the door. The pastas & sauces are amazingly delicious - the basics perfected (pesto, alfredo, pomodoro). I know some fellow yelpers think the portions are small but I think the quality is so high that the pricing is fair. A pasta dish alone may leave you slightly less than full but that's where the sides come in - fried lasagne is an ingenious creation. And the eggplant parm is really tasty. The cauliflower was just ok  (I'd love for them to offer a version of the classic broccoli/garlic/ooo instead). Overall a great place.",1,,
108,Ashton B.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,5.0,1/11/2018,"Stepped into Pasta Flyer for a lite bite, immediately you can tell everyone really enjoys working there, the experience definitely wasn't your typical fast casual assembly line experience...service was pleasant and accommodating to answer any questions you have about the menu which is traditional and streamlined. The Dining area is sophisticated but not intimidating, it was perfectly maintained and I noticed each table being wiped when someone left which is something you rarely see. The pasta was fresh and clean, not overly sauced. The garlic bites were fantastic, light and airy, they melted in your mouth leaving you with that perfect craving of more. I definitely recommend Pasta Flyer for a delicious bowl of pasta and an amazing price point! Until next time PF!",,,
109,Amy W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,0,2.0,2/15/2018,"Pasta Flyer doesn't know what ""hot"" means. Their pasta comes out moderately warm and by time you get to sitting down to eat, it's cold in 5 minutes. The sides look great because they're $2 but when you get 2-3 it adds up and you end up paying what you would have paid if you got yourself a sandwich somewhere else. The side salad is meh. The broccoli side comes cold. The garlic dots are greasy. Ugh. I've had so much better. I'll go somewhere else.",,,
110,Abigail A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,1/18/2018,"Love this place! Pasta is so tasty, and all of the sides and salads are so delicious also. Quick and friendly service. Whatever those garlic dough balls are are also unreal.",,,
111,Leigh S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,1/11/2018,"Oh, Pasta Flyer, you were so worth the wait. How do you manage to keep the pasta al dente and yet have it ready in a minute? I know not. I do know thatI am so happy to have you in the neighborhood. Love the pesto and the garlic dots.",,,
112,Donald V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0,2.0,12/12/2017,"Got spaghetti and meatballs - the meatballs were tough and chewy, as well as being rare (undercooked?) inside, and they were also not as hot as the pasta and sauce. Disappointing...",,,
113,M D.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",148,22,0,5.0,12/2/2017,"We had a great experience at Pasta Flyer - they're really executing the fast-food-but-fresh pasta experience. I'm SO happy to report that the gluten free pasta is delicious. They explained that only the specific sauce is available with it, as they do cook it in a separate area, which I appreciate! Love the pasta, but wasn't enticed by the side I could have. Would be a dream to get gf garlic knots...",,,
114,Albert D.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,2,0,5.0,11/20/2017,Great pasta! So fast! Amazing fried lasagna and garlic dots. Loved the red sauce. All perfectly cooked. Great value for the money. We ordered a lot and it was all under $20 total.,,,
