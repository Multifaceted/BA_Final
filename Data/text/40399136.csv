0,Victoria P.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,0.0,5.0,8/7/2018,"Boyfriend and I came to The Bonney Read for happy hour on a Sunday recently. Big plus for happy hour specials on weekends (2pm-4pm). What really made this meal special was the service. Our server, Peter, was knowledgeable about the menu and provided on point suggestions. He somehow knew what we wanted before we did. Very hot day and coming from the beach, Peter suggested the Mexican Iceberg. The frosty cold mix of Pacifio and frozen margarita hit the spot. Followed this up with $3 rolling rocks (happy hour pricing). Again, iced cold drafts on a hot summer day. Onto the food...Swordfish bites - THE BEST. We ordered a second round of these before the first was even finished. They were buttery, fresh, and delicious. These were a special, I do not remember pricing but would have paid double because they are THAT GOOD. Smoked White Fish Dip - smokey and delicious, came with crostini, in my opinion this small plate is a not to be missed, easily shareable for two people, $6 for happy hour pricing.Dozen Oysters - extremely fresh, was told they were local from NJ. Came with a lovely mignonette that was not overpowering. Really complimented the oysters well. $1.5/oyster for happy hour pricing. Fisherman's Fry - fried shrimp and calamari. Again, tasted very fresh. Came with marinara or chile sauce for dipping, both delicious.This dish comes with fried kale on top, unexpectedly addicting, I could have eaten a bowl of just the kale and been very happy. The added chile peppers provided just the right amount of kick. Not featured on the happy hour menu but easily worth the $13. Shrimp Cocktail - large, plump shrimp. Cooked perfectly. The spices (I believe Old Bay) were a nice touch. $12 for a 1/2 pound for happy hour. Ending our meal, we thought we couldn't possibly consume another bite until Peter suggested some oyster shooters. How does one say no to an oyster shooter? Perfect way to end the meal. The Bonney Read offers two varieties, cucumber or tomato. We opted for tomato. Perfect meal finisher.Also, this restaurant is decorated beautifully and is quite large. I can't wait to come back.",,1,
1,A A.,"Monmouth County, NJ",0,62,1,2.0,11/10/2018,"Saturday night. Crowded, noisy, servers running around like crazy. I had a few oysters which were good, but on the small and expensive side.We then ordered three small plates:The crab cake sliders seriously lacked a sauce that might have made them a good dish. They were great cakes but on dry bread were not enjoyable.The ""Fisherman's Fry"" was just lame with a ketchup-sauce. So not worth it.The Burrata (soft cheese and bread) was so bland and such a disappointment. We had a those-- all done with lazy execution-- and a couple of glasses of wine and decided not to proceed with entrees. Our table was so close to adjacent ones and it was so loud that conversation was nearly impossible. The server did her best but was clearly over extended.",,,
2,Sammy J.,"New York, NY",10,30,28,1.0,8/6/2018,"Not worth the time or expense! The cooks are asleep at the wheel and concepts of hospitality have flown out the window.I've been here 5-6x in the last two years.  Initially it was amazing. However, the second to last visit, the bartender seemed so annoyed to be there, we could feel her seething. We seemed to be a bother.  We were never offered second rounds on drinks.  It was difficult to get her attention to order a second round. It's was infuriating. But we made the mistake of thinking that we wouldn't let her bad day ruin a place me and my friends liked.  Last night I went again, and for the last time. The hosts told it would be a 45 min wait without looking.  Yet when we sat at the bar, their was 5-6empty tables. Accompanied by three friends, we ordered a round of drinks. My dark and stormy was incorrectly poured into an old-fashioned glass by my bartender with the dreads. The drink was neither dark nor stormy. It was muddy.  But honestly I can get over that.  My friends ordered the pasta dish, the seafood bisque, crab cake sliders, clams casino and a salad.  I ordered the king crab app and the steak.  I think their was one or two more items I can't remember.  The pasta was al denté but devoid of all flavor.  My friend asked for salt, parm cheese, then pepper flakes. When she mentioned the issue, the dreaded bartender's response was ""I don't work in the kitchen, what do you want me to do?""  Excuse me? The bisque didn't taste like lobster. The clams casino came so dry and rubbery, it was like eating someone else chewed gum. It was so dried out, it had clearly been under a light for way to long or left in the oven so long, sand could have turned to glass! I then watched my entire party literally disapprove each dish one by one.  The only palatable dish was a salad with feta in it.   While my friends ate, I waited for my steak. And I waited. And I waited.  15mins...25mins...45 Minutes later I asked the bartender with the dreads, now that my party was done ""eating"", where my was my medium rare steak. He made an excuse that the small kitchen was trying to cater to the large restaurant.  I'm from NYC.  I've seen smaller kitchens take on larger spaces.  It leads me to believe the kitchen leads are asleep at the wheel. Though I suspect ownership probably refuses to pay for competent kitchen leadership. But that's hard to tell.   Eventually I asked for my check as we reached an hour since we ordered.  The manager with the salt and peppered beard  came over and explained that the steak was coming out and would be here at any moment. Aka another unknown wait.  Should I have ordered another dark and muddy? I paused for a moment and contemplated whether I should mention, the improper drink, our flavorless pasta, the bland bisque, the clams that were cooked under so much heat we could have created diamonds or the annoyed attitude in which he approached me...As though I was the issue. Instead I paid for my drink and 4 tiny cold pieces of crab, all while I devised my plan to get a burger across the street.  Like I said, the kitchen is asleep at the wheel, the staff are annoyed they have to be there and good luck getting a basic cocktail.  As an slight aside, I mentioned to a coworker, who has a beach house close by, that I had this experience.  She mentioned most people she knows stopped going there a while ago and she gave me 5 recommendations of place within a few blocks.  Lesson being, keep it moving. Theirs good stuff to be had close by.",3,2,1
3,Phuong N.,"Louisville, KY",174,99,90,4.0,9/4/2018,"I loved it here.  Our group got the Spanish octopus, which was great.  I've had octopus a lot in my life, but it's never been so large and tender like it was here.  We also got the lobster rolls and snow crabs.  The pieces of meat were large, fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to go back.",,,
4,Amanda A.,"Freehold Township, NJ",185,86,250,4.0,3/6/2018,"I ate here as part of a party of 7 on a Saturday night; we had a reservation and were seated at our reservation time.  The restaurant was pretty lively/loud so it's definitely not a romantic atmosphere.We tried a few different cocktails, and the fan favorite was definitely the St. Elmo's Fire, which is what I had.  It was like a Moscow Mule, but spicy.  One qualm I had was with the bread.  They don't serve you bread automatically; you have to order it, and it costs $6 (see my picture).  That is RIDICULOUS.  I haven't been to many places that charge for bread, and I feel like this should be a given particularly in a seafood place where many dishes have sauces/juices that you can soak up with bread.  The bread itself was pretty good, but again, you shouldn't have to pay $6 for it.  The serving was enough for 2-3 people, so we ordered 2.  My husband and I shared the Surf & Turf, which was a special on the menu that night.  The lobster tails were a bit small, and the filet mignon was not even a whole filet - it was two slices.  The filet was also slightly overcooked (we ordered medium rare).  So overall, we were also a bit disappointed in the portion for the price ($60).  However, the potato gratin they served with it was DELICIOUS - I'd go back for that.  The service was excellent!  Our server's name was Tommy and he was very attentive throughout our entire meal.  Although clearly busy, he was constantly refilling our waters and was available whenever we wanted to order more drinks.  I'll be back to try other things - especially the Bloody Mary, which I hear is pretty good.",8,4,8

Updated review","Came here on a Friday for happy hour with a friend. Arrived around 545, and all bar seats were taken, except for a random single chair here and there. After doing a lap to look for two seats and almost leaving, we were able to find a free table on our second lap. Fast forward a couple of minutes to a family of 3 asking if they can share our table. Seemed like a lot of the high tops were sharing their table with strangers, so we did the same. My girlfriend wanted a Moscow mule, which they had something similar, but not a true Moscow mule. I opted for a frosé. Mine was definitely refreshing and potent. My friend didn't really like her ""Moscow mule"", as it was a little spicy, but she drank it anyway. We decided on half a dozen of their daily oysters ($1.50 an oyster). They were definitely on the smaller side in comparison to other restaurants I've been to with a happy hour oyster special.We also ordered the clam and chorizo bites. These were overly fried and lacking in flavor. The dipping sauce was a saffron aioli, also lacking in flavor. We decided we needed something else since we weren't full, so we went with the mussels. For $8 you get a nice portion of mussels, the server said it's half a pound. These were pretty good, in a white wine sauce, served with a crispy piece of bread. I definitely enjoyed the look and feel of the restaurant, and the server was very nice and patient  even though he looked overwhelmed as he was bartending and taking tables. 3 stars for atmosphere and strong drinks, but lacking in the food department.",1,,1
7,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,9008,5.0,9/6/2017,"The Bonney Read has everything I want in a restaurant near the beach.1. Picnic tables outside where my friends and I can eat and drink in the sunshine.2. Excellent fried food. Whether you're looking for high-quality fish & chips, a fried clam roll, oyster po'boy sliders, chorizo and clam fritters, a great fried chicken sandwich, or just a simple order of fries (punched up with Old Bay if you'd like)...they've got it. 3. A solid happy hour. $4 shots of Jack, rum, or decent tequila, all kinds of other drink specials, cheap oysters, and discounts on certain apps like $7 Chowder Dogs. We came for a late lunch and stayed right through, much to all of our chagrin the next day.4. Chowder Dogs. If you've never had the pleasure, it's a goddamn great sausage in a fluffy bun, smothered in clam chowder (bacon is a smart addition too). It's much better than you think it is, and if I know you, it already sounded pretty great, didn't it?5. All the seafood. The raw bar is excellent, the mussels are fresh (as always, the broth is the star), and they've got all the lobster, crab claws, clams, oysters, shrimp...anything you wanted, they've got it.6. The Ultimate Bloody Mary. Honestly, I'm not a fan of anyone claiming such titles on their menu, but this thing deserves the crown. In addition to being a large, delicious Bloody, it comes garnished with a jumbo crab claw, a littleneck clam, a cocktail shrimp ($8 of seafood right there), a piece of bacon, olives, citrus, and celery. It's honestly a bargain even at $18 when you consider the cocktails are $9-12, and there's enough vodka in there to slap your hangover into tomorrow.7. A great burger (just look at that thing, AND it was properly cooked), for when I get tired of all the seafood.8. Great service. Shout out to Ander and Kim (not Genevieve, which was our initial guess). They were friendly and quick with the drinks, and just all around on top of things.But just so you know that I don't actually work here, I'll admit it isn't perfect. Happy hour specials are only for the bar and outside tables (not a fan of that), the food can take a while, the old bay fries were WAY too old bay the last time we came in, and it's not the cheapest spot around...but that's why happy hour exists, people. Overall, this is just a high-quality establishment. We ended up here twice in two days, and I don't regret a thing. You won't regret it either.",10,3,5
8,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1726,624,4345,4.0,8/26/2017,"I've been here twice for happy hour and I really enjoyed myself!! I like to sit at the long wood tables with high stools next to the bar in the back...The cocktails are Eh to me although u can get tipsy but the food at happy hour is where it's at TOTALLY worth it!!! Especially if u like seafood!!!We like to get the mussels ( with the Delish bread to dip), the clams, the oysters, lobster bisque etcI tried the Spanish octopus that has a pretty presentation  and is good. I wanted it to be better than I thought but maybe it was because we filled up on all the other stuff.  We also tried the shark bites that my friends loved.  Old bay fries are ok- very salty. I would come back for sure on another happy hr day .....",10,3,8
9,Roxanne O.,"Freehold Township, NJ",74,594,716,3.0,2/16/2018,"I'm not sure why, but this restaurant had been on my to try list. It seemed pretty busy, but it was still early enough on a Friday that we were able to get in without a wait. We ordered drinks and food, and even though I was starving, the food didn't take long to come out. I ordered the a clam pasta dish, which had a lot of pasta, a little lacking on clams. We also got the lobster roll, which I was not a fan of--it was cold and tasted like something I could have made at home. Definitely smaller than other lobster rolls I've had, like at Luke's Lobster and a little skimpy on the meat. Seems to be a reoccurring theme here. We paid close to $80, and I definitely did not feel like we got our money's worth.",8,2,4

11,Patricia P.,"Parlin, NJ",210,174,688,4.0,7/3/2018,"The Bonney Read is one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Asbury!  I love seafood and this place delivers every time! The restaurant sits in a corner building which reminds me of the flatiron section of NYC.  It is spacious, well lighted and modern with plenty of outdoor seating for those hot summer days... There is a moderate sized bar set up towards the back of the space which is always packed so prepare to wait for seats.   I have hesitated to write a review because the few times I have visited I have not had a full dinner; we have enjoyed it during Happy Hour and have always been satisfied!  Happy Hour runs Mon-Fri 4-7pm except for Wednesday 4-close, Saturday and Sundays 2-4pm.  During Happy Hour they offer most cocktails and house wines for $6; feature draft for $5; the menu consists of various small plates such as Smoked White Fish Dip and Raw Bar Selections such as Oysters for $1.50 each.  On this occasion even though we enjoyed items from Happy Hour Specials, we dined.  Being a hot summer day, we ordered their refreshing house Rose and accompanied it with the cool and fresh clams and oysters from the raw bar; next my husband had New England Clam Chowder from which I had a taste and it was flavorful and satisfying with large, meaty clams and pieces of bacon.  We split the Spicy Clam Stew over Linguine.  What a meal!  From start to finish all the selections were well executed and served.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  No wonder we love The Bonney Read!",1,,2

13,Eric C.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,93,4,2.0,2/1/2018,"Well, the cold seafood platter was great. I mean, fantastic. Unbelievably good, to the point that it made the rest of the meal just a shock. Everything else... All I can say is that the chef must love his salt. Every single dish that touched heat was loaded to the point of being inedible. And shockingly, there are huge cylinders of additional salt on the table!We started with the jersey green chowder, which was so salty that we asked the waitress if this was normal. Her response was that it was just the chorizo making it too salty.Next was the mussels, which were not only loaded with salt, but garlic and cheese as well. Each mussel shell was at least half full of garlic and/or cheese.The crab cakes, clam linguini and other dishes were all so salty that we could not even eat more than one bite. Thankfully, there was a steady supply of water.The service was pleasant, quick and brought everything exactly as expected. However, the front staff cannot overcome the failures in the kitchen. Until the salt lick is exorcized from this location, it should be avoided by all interested in cooked seafood.",2,,
14,Tracy S.,"Belmar, NJ",2,54,33,5.0,3/11/2018,"From the food to the service, everything was excellent! We started dinner with the ultimate Bloody Mary and raw oysters! The oysters were perfectly briny. Then we had the New England clam chowder and the the jersey green clam chowder. Both were full of clams and bacon flavor. We finished our dinner with the fish and chips. The best we ever had and the homemade tarter sauce pour it over the top! We will definitely be returning soon!",,,

Updated review","After my last experience I ended by saying I wouldn't return.  It's been about a year since we were here but decided to give another try as we were meeting friends in Asbury who love seafood.  Group of 4 this time.   Waitress attitude very similar to our last experience, not knowledgeable and rude. Service was very slow and barely anyone was in the restaurant.  Appetizers came out and one was wrong.  We kept the wrong one but requested one we ordered also.  Would gladly pay for both.  When the second appetizer finally came out after 15 minutes the description given to us by the waitress was wrong, it wasn't cooked, it was raw with an uncooked egg.    We didn't touch it and asked for it to be removed from the check,   $15 is $15.   Rather rude attitude she spoke to her manager. It was taken off but should have done without us asking.  Poor customer service. The best part of the menu is the ultimate Bloody Mary which is an appetizer in itself.  The food was better than our last experience but still I stand firm by saying it isn't the best and it's costly for what they provide.",11,3,6

Updated review","We are regulars- the lobster bisque is the best in NJ and Hawaiian rolls are exceptional  The chowder is fresh, with the right amount of clams and and potatoes.  Go for a few of the shrimp cocktail to round out the meal but if you want an entree, the burger, fish tacos, fish and chips and Spanish octopus are winners.  Have to rave about the staff- they are delightful and attentive-and because we linger over great drinks (the rum flight or the Painkiller) and dessert (Key Lime) we can see how seamless they interact with the kitchen, bar and each other.  Doesn't get better",,,

Well, it's gone south - the white and red mussel sauces were unbelievably salty, the dish no longer comes with fries (you order and pay for them separately), the grilled bread is kind of a stale chewy flavor. The only saving grace was that we had originally sat in the bar after being told it was an hour and a half wait for outside seats... About 10 minutes later, my husband went outside and saw 2 tables empty, asked us to be moved, and we were. But still, really lame to be told there's a 90 min wait when obviously that's not the case. Outside is way better than the cramped, loud, TV-laden bar. One extra star for the very sweet and friendly server.",1,1,1

Updated review",Out of this world seafood and the freshest salmon I have ever had. I decided to grab a few small dishes but they turned out to be more then just little. I ordered the octopus which has amazing flavor and had come with potatoes that were seasoned to perfection and accompanied the perfect tender but not to tender octopus. That also came with a yellowish mustard looking sauce and did not tatse anything like mustard but it had an amazing flavor that accompanied the octopus like no other. In my opinion you should not skip or look over this restaurant. Get to it as soon as you,1,,1

As the name suggests, it's large hot dog smothered in clam chowder, and includes bacon if you want to shell out another $2. This combo may cause a gag reaction for some, but for me, it was a must order and totally worth the risk. If culinary curiosity is your superpower, then be sure you order this creative little vittle. It's $12, but drops to $7 during happy hour (4-7pm). Besides the chowder dog, there are plenty of other highlights you'll want to look out for. Tons of shellfish, oysters/clams, rolls, etc... They also have a monster bloody Mary that's a force to be reckoned with. It comes correct with a shrimp, lobster claw, bacon, olives, and a slice of bacon. It's basically a meal in and of itself, and it's the perfect solution for wiping away a hangover by way of the Shampoo Effect.

For a group of 10, last dish came out by 9:45. This is definitely slow. What makes it worse is that the waitress only came over once to ask us if need more drinks. She never came over to inform us when the food would be ready.The service definitely needs some serious work.For food, I ordered the Spanish octopus and tuna tartare. The octopus was over salted and slightly overcooked. Overall it wasn't worth the $20. Tuna was good but I've had better 3.5/5. Overall, I dont think I would come back here. Overhaul the service and improve dish flavors and maybe I'll be back.",1,,

42,Joseph V.,"Bordentown, NJ",13,76,10,5.0,1/29/2018,"I decided to spend a rainy, miserable, Sunday at this establishment with my lovely wife. We got there just in time for Happy Hour. Get the Pearls and Bubbles. A bottle of champagne with a dozen oysters for either $50 or $75 depending on your tastes. We ordered a proper French Champagne which arrived promptly. It was iced down and poured by our bar maid. Ice cold and tasty! A few minutes later the Oysters arrived and they were spectacular! Blue points, if I know my oysters. Very nice size and fresh as you can get them. The champagne minuet dressing was very flavorful. I thought the horse radish wasn't as hot as it should have been. The chili sauce was pretty bland, but decent. The oysters were properly cleaned and shucked. And it wasn't he end of the meal! We ordered two fish tacos and the lobster Roll to share. The fish in the tacos was lightly breaded, fried and beautifully fresh and crunchy. The taco itself was soft and nicely seasoned with cilantro and lime and a Sriracha sauce. The lobster roll was on a soft hot dog type roll. The lobster meat was incredibly fresh, lightly seasoned and had some celery chopped in. Spectacular! We finished up with a couple of Rock and Rye cocktails. Nice to see old fashioned cocktails making a comeback! The service was good, the food among the best seafood we've had. The Sunday happy hour is an amazingly  good deal. They had a nice crowd for a rainy Sunday after noon. Get there early and make sure to sit at the bar!",,,1

The wine and beer selection was sub par. The water, served from a bottle was warmer than room temperature. Not good. The meal, a poorly cooked grey colored tuna, was supposed to be medium rare. It was not. It was medium well. The small baked potato was ok, but nothing to write home about. The waitress made sure that the tuna was replaced with a different fish, salmon. The request to the cook ( no way would I reference this person as a Chef) was to make this piece of meat rare...it arrived as medium rare. For the price, this was not a good experience.",,,

The Bonney Read is owned and operated by the same owners and chef as the Biergarten, so if you have been there you already know the food is good. All of the seafood is fresh and none of it is farm raised. There's a selection of local catches daily and a raw bar. I haven't had one thing I didn't like. My favorite is the snow crab legs, it says family style but I tear that bucket up on my own. Everything is cooked to perfection. Can't go wrong with anything here. I recently had the shark fresh catch and it was the best I have ever had. It was so moist and flavorful. Food tips: snow crab legs, shark bites, raw bar, fresh catch, artichoke hearts.

We live 15 mins from some great beaches and AP is one of our favorites).So after being on the beach all day we decided we wanted a raw bar. I turned to my trusty App, Yelp. Saw the Bonney Read. Once again fellow Yelpers did not disappoint.The atmosphere at the Bonney Read is great. The staff was attentive and friendly. From the time we walked in to the time we left. The staff was aces.For appetizers we had the raw oyster sampler. The oysters were fresh and buttery. Went nicely with a Chardonnay. We also had the tuna Ceviche with NJ sweet corn. This was delicious. Finally for those that didn't like raw fish, they had the clams casino. They looked and smelled incredible. For entrees my brother in law and I had the crab cake sliders. Probably the only disappointing part of the meal. The cakes were tasty but Iv had better. Maybe 50/50 crab to bread ratio. Would like to have more crab. However with the aioli they had a good taste. My wife had the fish and chips. This looked amazing and she said it was delicious looked fresh not frozen. Other members had the linguini and clams, bucket of crabs, chicken sandwich and burger. The fries had a seasoning on them. They were also very good. So if your in Asbury and are craving fresh seafood with a raw bar, look no further then The Bonney Read. You won't be disappointed.",,,

Being right on the corner gives you a great panorama of the neighborhood. The food and service on the other hand are solid, but in my opinion, nothing amazing. We started off with the clam and chorizo fritters. I feel they would be more aptly named hush puppies, as they were more doughy; I think they could be improved with more clam or chorizo in each bite. I had the clam strip roll, which just amounted to a bunch of clam strips on a hot dog bun. Nothing about the meal was terrible, but nothing was superb either. That being said, two others at the table had the fish and chips, which looked really good. I did feel that the place was on the loud side, but that might have just been the night we attended. I'd give Bonney Read a solid 3.5 out of 5.",1,,

Great spot with indoor and outdoor seating, with a nautical theme (as expected). Staff was friendly and knowledgeable of their food items. We were there around 4pm on a Saturday, so it was not crowded yet, service was quick. We started with the oysters we sampled all of their offerings from the east and west coast. I have to say that we were impressed. We love oysters and are a little snobbish when it comes to oysters. These were fresh and well loved, the taste of the ocean was prominent. We also had a fish plate and the fish and chips. They were both good, but like our other favorite oyster house in Toronto. The entrees were just OK. So definitely come here for oysters and a drink, and enjoy another restaurant in Asbury for your meal. Its a great way to go to a couple of places!",3,2,2

Updated review","Three of us had an absolutely great meal here during happy hour on a Thursday night. My second time dining here and I will certainly be back. What stands out so dramatically was the taste and quality of their seafood. We had half shell oysters, mussels in wine sauce, and steamed clams.The seafood can get no fresher. I've never had oysters so fresh and with exquisite flavor, the mussels and clams were awesome.  In fact we order them three times; couldn't get enough. We asked for bread to soak up the mussel wine sauce. It wasn't until we got the check that we noticed they charged us $3. After spending over $100? Come on! I thought that was petty and irked me enough to give them 4 rather than the 5 stars they deserved.",4,1,3

Updated review","Sadly my visit to Bonney Read for Lobster Night 3 days ago has downgraded my previous review.  I have been here several times & it has always been very good.  That being said, unless this night was an anomaly, they need to get their Lobster Night straightened out before they lose business.We had 7 pm reservations & arrived early to enjoy happy hour for a bit before dinner.  They have a few good beers on taps & the prices are decent.  While at the bar we ordered shrimp cocktail.  The guys ordered muscles a short time later.  Maybe 20 minutes later the muscles came out while we were still waiting for our shrimp cocktail.  When we asked the bartender he advised there was a high demand of raw oysters & it was slowing down the kitchen.   By 7 pm (half an hour later) we were seated for dinner we were still waiting for our shrimp cocktails.  The bartender & hostess told us 'they would find us' & deliver them to the table.  I hoped they would come before dinner...Waitress service was pretty slow but we were there for the lobster special & we let her know when she arrived.   Then we waited, along with many other diners....  We did not receive our meals for close to an hour.  As we looked around the place we knew we were not alone.  We asked about the delay & were told because it was lobster night, everyone was ordering lobster & the kitchen was overwhelmed.  If you are going to offer lobster night, what do you think people are there to order?  Make sure you have sufficient staff! I have to say, the lobster was delicious & served with one small potato in the pot & an ear of corn.  We did notice when the food started coming out that the ears of corn were shrinking (maybe running out of corn?)   I would like to give then another chance & see.  I'm not sure what changed (since I had eaten the about a week before & left a much better rating), but I hope they either do away with lobster night or get their act together.",2,,

We sat at the bar and were greeted by our servers Nicole & Casey. After ordering our drinks, we looked at the raw bar menu. Large Buck oysters, steamed clams, & mussels hit the spot. The mussels came in a wine based broth. All three were great tasting, so very fresh as one would expect. The atmosphere was excellent and upbeat. I have one minor complaint: I asked our server if we could have bread to sop up the moules frites sauce, she acknowledged and subsequently the bread came out for us to enjoy. Looking at the bill we were charged $3 for the bread. That I consider a no no. We should have been advised of the charge prior.",3,,

60,Lydia B.,"Wayne, PA",220,240,867,3.0,8/13/2017,The Bonney read is the top notch seafood restaurant in a really fun town I've been craving. I could not give it more stars because unfortunately both times I went to this restaurant/ bar we were served warm Drinks. The first time our Prosecco was warm. This time my husband's beer lukewarm. I was delighted that the delicious plump oysters were nicely chilled. The table next to us has the crab cake sliders. They looked epic. I'd try those next time along with the oysters again. I also recommend the muscles with the delicious grilled bread to dip in the perfectly seasoned broth. The atmosphere is clean and vibrant with a hustler and bustle that the staff was handling nicely. I kept thinking that this was the quintessential seafood restaurant on the Jersey shore that I've been looking for for years and can't wait to go back. I will make sure I ask that they make sure our drinks are cold enough in future visits.,3,,
61,Mike H.,"Montclair, NJ",28,23,0,1.0,8/10/2017,"Upon entering the Bonney Read I was very excited, they have $1.50 oyster special from four until seven, that sounded like a fantastic appetizer, and I was delighted that they had the catch of the day. Upon being seated at a table I realized that the oyster special is only good for the bar area, Fair enough. Upon finding that out I promptly moved to the bar area. The waitress had an attitude as if she had just sucked on an entire bag full of lemons.When I was ordering my drinks I inquired as to substituting the loaded baked potato that comes with the catch of the day salmon, for a vegetable of some kind. The waitress then informed me that they do not do that. I find it completely ridiculous for a restaurant to refuse to make A simple and reasonable substitution. I was informed that I could purchase a side of garlicy greens for $5. I don't know that it would've been possible for the waitress to deliver that news in a more condescending tone. I looked around for a manager to give the restaurant a chance to make this right but it seems as though they were notinterested in my business.This was a complete turnoff to actually ordering dinner to go with my oysters. In all honesty, how does a loaded baked potato go with a fresh piece of fish?My disappointment was allowed to grow, and in fact was encouraged when I got my bill. For two drinks and a dozen oysters at $1.50 apiece it was $50. Now I would have known how much my drinks were ahead of time had the restaurant been kind enough to list the prices on their menu. I cannot in good conscious recommend a restaurant that does not list their prices, is unwilling to make reasonable substitutions, has rude wait staff, and oysters that were festooned with grit. On a positive note that the decor was simply darling.",3,,

Oysters delicious. 1/2 priced bottles of wine and $5 drink specials! Couldn't resist the Pineapple Pisco Sours. My husband and I shared a Lobster Roll that was on regular menu at MP, shocked when we got the bill and it was $28. It came with fries and a small Cole slaw. It was absolutely packed with the lobster and delicious!  Now we know!  The Bonney Read was hopping on Sunday afternoon. They also have a Blue Plate Special for $20.

It was the last stop on the Asbury Wine Tour and dinner seemed like a good idea after tasting 12 or 13 wines over two hours. Their location is great and the building has a very distinctive shape - think of a small Flatiron building in Asbury. This is yet another addition to the great restaurant scene in Asbury Park.We were seated immediately and the place began filling up quickly. Their food sample for the Wine tour was a thin clam chowder which was very good and served to whet our appetites. Tim (sometimes goes by Tom) and I both had the linguine with clams which was excellent - nothing left in my plate! Carol had the fish and chips and took some home while Sue had the Bonney Burger that looked good to me.Service was very good and attentive and my only minor complaint is that we had to pay for bread to go along with our linguine.Definitely worth a trip back to see what else is on the menu.No dessert, but we meandered down Cookman Street, stopping at the Brickwall and House of Independents but that is another story.",2,1,1

The homemade cocktail sauce and champagne mignonette were great too. For our meals we had green curry mussels and grilled mahi mahi. The mussels were super tasty with just enough spice. Mahi was fresh and cooked just right. We sat at the bar and Brittany took excellent care of us. The cocktail list is extensive, as is the rum menu. She was spot on with her recommendations.

We constantly kept asking where the food was and the server was like ""just a few more minutes"". It took about 30-40 minutes after ""just a few more minutes"" to get our food, which was mediocre at best. It would have been nice to speak to a manager or someone in charge but it seemed like there was nobody. Honestly I used to be a server and I have great appreciation for anyone who works in a restaurant  but this felt we were were being treated like a joke.

Nothing. Two requests for a staffer to come by after sitting there for 25 minutes and nothing.Waited for another 2 minutes and got up and left. No excuse for what took place.

You can also order soup, olives, crab cake slider (1 slider only) and a few more items. For happy hour, it's really worth it. I cannot say about their lobster roll because husband and I were too full to eat anymore. We started off with two east coast and four west coast oysters. Gotta give it up to the east coast. Theirs is plumper and tastier. They use fresh horseradish which I appreciate. Next came the Nj green clam soup with oyster crackers. That was also very tasty. Then the marinated olives came out. It had various types of olives along with some anchovies and skinless almonds that were marinated with the olives. While it was good, it was too much in one sitting for two people.  We couldn't eat another bite so we skipped out on the lobster roll. Their roll is cold and a tad bit of mayo is added I'm told. They use at least a pound and quarter too. This is not part of the happy hour so it's at market price.  Next time.",5,,2

New England clam chowder can't help but make you feel cozy inside. The waitstaff is lovely, patient, and more than helpful with recommendations. Warning...this place does induce your mouth watering when you think back to it lol. I can't wait for my next visit; I know where I'll be stopping!",,,

We were wandering around downtown looking for a place with good seafood when we stumbled onto Bonney Read. When we asked to see a menu the hostess told us that everything was seafood except two dishes so we basically hit the jackpot. Happy hour is all day on Wednesday but it's only in the bar area. There's good deals on drinks and food. We lurked for 20-30 minutes until two seats opened up at the bar, and the wait was definitely worth it. First off, the happy hour food is DELICIOUS. We got oysters, steamed clams and pull and peel shrimp (my favorite!) and they were all so flavorful and well seasoned and delicious (it's 8am as I write this and my mouth is still watering). The portions are not skimpy and the presentation is beautiful. After our impressive happy hour snacks, we decided to order even more - a chowder dog (woah), the octopus (omg) and even a small salad (yummy!). I really cannot overemphasize how delicious this food was and if I lived in the area I would be at happy hour every single day. Things were a little rocky with the bartender. She seemed very angry/overwhelmed and was hard to catch. However, she apologized to us for how hectic things were (without us having complained) which pretty much negates any discomfort I had about her. As a server, I know we all have our off days and get frustrated, and all we can do to rectify the situation is apologize. She handled that situation nicely and made sure we left feeling happy. That's good customer service! :)Anyways, highly recommend this place and cannot wait to return!",5,2,4

Their was a lot of clams on it which is good. Also had the clam and conch fritters which looked like hush puppies to me. They tasted good as well. Also had some clam chowder hot dog which was good.

Updated review","Finally a decent raw bar in our area since the loss of the Original Oyster due to Hurricane Sandy. And the  whole thing with Rooneys CrabHouse is legit, but prices are sky high. The Bonny has a cool bar and some outdoor seating. Bartenders were good and friendly. We sat at the bar. They had Pacifico on tap, and a bunch of other different beers - some real good specials and deals... Oysters were super fresh and good. Fish and chips were excellent. The rum deal and list was awesome. FYI They are a rum bar and have some of the best rum in the world.  Try the flight it's good.  Food was out prompt and it was on point.

Updated review","It's been about a year since the Bonney Read opened, and I visited for the first time. The food is still as good as ever, especially the raw bar offerings; and they continue to offer more items to try during their happy hour specials. Although I haven't had their drinks here at the bar, I hear from everyone else that they're doing it right.On this latest trip to the BR, we celebrated my cousin's birthday. One person in our group has a seafood allergy, and we notified our server. A few minutes later, the chef actually came out to our table to explain all the menu items, helped with non-seafood suggestions, and even offered to customize a salad entree, to suit our needs. What great service! It's rare to find a restaurant that will go to these lengths to satisfy their customers. The negative reviews posted here that complain about poor service unfortunately must have come on an off day, because I have never had a bad experience at the Bonney Read.The daily specials were both clever, and delicious. In celebration of shark week, they had shark bites for appetizers, which were (sustainably caught) mako shark on skewers, served with a delicious house-made dipping sauce. We also tried their grilled octopus, which is served on a bed of potatoes and chorizo crumbles. That octopus dish is hands down my favorite thing on their menu. I could order two of those plates for an entree and leave a happy customer. The grilled tentacles are crispy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the inside. Perfectly seasoned, there's no need to add the yellow aioli garnishing the plate; a little squirt of lemon juice is all you need to enjoy the subtle flavor and delectable  texture nuances. Keep up the good work, Bonney Read!",,,
117,Melinda M.,"Springfield Township, NJ",115,15,3,2.0,11/19/2017,"We went to the Bonney Read several times over this past summer and fell in love with their fish and chips. Recently, we went to the restaurant with friends. On two separate occasions the food was marginal and the fish and chips seem to go from being prepared with cod to being prepared with some lower grade fish. The fried chicken sandwich seem to of been made with chicken fat and dark meat. My guest described it as a fried fat sandwich. We mentioned the difference in the food to the waitress who did not seem surprised with the lower quality. We are so disappointed that Bonny Read is no longer our favorite ""go to"" place because of the lack of consistency with the quality of the food.",,,
118,Vicki C.,"Little Silver, NJ",6,48,3,3.0,9/22/2017,"We came for dinner on a Friday night.  Drinks were ok and the food was ok as well.  I had the clam and chorizo fritters and lobster roll. Hubs had the oyster po' boys and fish and chips.  Everything was good, but not memorable.  The MP for the lobster roll was $30, but the lobster meat itself wasn't that tasty.  Maybe we didn't order the best things on the menu, but I'm not sure that would necessarily change the review.  The ambience was REALLY loud.  The music was up pretty high and I felt like I had to yell to have a conversation across he table.  I also felt the wait staff was rushing us.  We probably won't go back.",,,

Overpriced unfresh salt.The barely there mussels were so fishy that I was scared to eat them all.The Lobster bisque was cold and you could tell by the look of it even it had been sitting in the fridge for about a week.The octopus dish was overcooked and the bacon in it overpowers the whole dish.

This gem in Asbury Park is one of the best seafood places at the shore, PERIOD !!Have asked many people who go down weekly and they've never been here for some reason??Have been there 3 times in the past month and the service and food is consistently wonderful. 2 of the 3 times Britney has been our server and she's the best!! Great insight on the menu and paces your meal as you like.LOVE the Oyster Po Boy sliders and the Fish n Chips are the very BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!! Energetic atmosphere both inside and out.

Once seated, we ordered as soon as we could ... then waited about 45 minutes for our lobster, shrimp, and crab legs to arrive. All was hot and pretty tasty, but the lobster was definitely a little tough. The Hawaiian rolls were great.

Order small plates item, the grilled squid was good. The garlic was a little burnt and bitter, chorizo was not a fresh chorizo, it was the dried chorizo.The Fishermen Fry was also delicious and the housemade chili garlic sauce was delicious.Raw Oysters were delicious however for an asbury park area the pricey were a little high. It's almost the same price as NYC restaurants.Linguine and Clams-pasta was overcooked, the clams were rubbery. There was pork belly in the dish which cause the dish to be super oily.Bouillabaisse was good up till the point where the mussels were bad.I think the only saving grace were the service, decor, and drinks.",2,,

We were able to make a reservation and even though we showed up about 20 minutes early we were still seated right away. We had 4 of each of their daily oysters and all were great as the appetizer. I had seen online that Thursday was Lobster night so we both ordered that as well. The lobster was absolutely delicious and for $25 can't be beat. We can't wait to come back down and enjoy this food again. We did stop back in Saturday night with friends and they fresh and steamed clams and loved them as well. A+ restaurant on Cookman Ave.,,,

Everyone at this place was super nice and she had a great time! We ended up sitting at the bar since there were no tables available. The busboy cleaned the bar area so well after my mom noticed the water left from the people before, and he brought her a whole plate of lined up lemon and lime slices when she asked for a piece of lime in her water. The bartender had great food recommendations and we loved the lobster roll and shrimp scampi, and he was so nice and physically pointed my mom all the way to the restroom when she asked where it was. We had come from the Asbury Park boardwalk and a restaurant that was half empty, but they refused to seat us so they wouldn't ""overwhelm"" the kitchen. We were so glad we left and found this place instead! My mom pronounced it ""very good"" and that's actually the first time she's said that to me while we were still at a place.

We were not looking for a free meal but he said the entire meal was on him and gave us a gift card to come back, which was very nice of him.

146,Megan K.,"Howell, NJ",65,2,2,1.0,6/19/2016,"Currently sitting in the restaurant as I'm typing this. On Father's Day, you would expect the restaurant would be overly busy, but it's not. There are at least 6 empty tables nearby. I mention this only to show that what I am about to write cannot be attributed to poor service alone. My party of 6 has been sitting at the table for one hour. We ordered three appetizers, one of which were they Ipswich Steamers ($19). My biggest regret at this moment is having not taken a picture to share. Some of the shells had NO STEAMERS inside them. The ones that did were one tenth the size of the shell and had clearly been 1) over steamed 2) sitting under the heat lamp for an extended period of time. Considering the amount of time we waited, both could be true. Regrettably, we sent them back. Never in my entire life have I had to do that, and I eat out somewhat often. We recently checked in with the host staff, who advised that our food would be out in 4 minutes. It's now been over 10. I've never had the desire to review on Yelp until this experience. To say I'm disappointed is an extreme understatement. Our entire party just walked out... Almost an hour and a half from when we first walked in the door. Another first for me and my everyone I'm with tonight. There are so many other wonderful restaurants to try in Asbury.. Avoid this one.",2,1,

My initial impression of it was that it had a very cool atmosphere, placed on the corner of two roads, surrounded by windows. There is a large bar area, and a good amount of casual seating, they have some outdoor street seating as well. The service was acceptable, we were there on a very slow, late afternoon. The food was fantastic though! I got the crab cake sandwiches (picture attached), it was a good size for a small lunch, two crab cakes on simple mini buns with a little side salad. My boyfriend got the fish and chips, which was one HUGE piece of fish deep fried over a massive pile of fries. The fish tasted fresh and was well battered - but do know, it is one piece of fried fish. This was a great plate for the cost. Another friend got the lobster roll, the lobster was lightly mayoed and lots of big chunks of lobster... overall a good lobster roll as well. This place seems best for a casual seafood lunch/dinner... food was good, prices were standard! Thanks Bonney Read!",,,

We don't know if this was their regular playlist, but my bf and I had a lot of fun singing with the 1980s music (duran duran, flock of seagulls, etc).The food! I came here with the ""treat yo self"" attitude and that's exactly what I did! First I picked out a dozen oysters (4 of the 3 they had that day) SO GOOD and fresh but I wish I had remembered the names of them. Next, the octopus with chorizo and potatoes, the crab cake sliders, and the green curry mussels. I can only say amazing things about each of those dishes!!

Some of the worst food I have ever eaten, they should be closed down. I would never set foot in there again and would recommend anyone eat there. Let's start backwards. The coffee and my bailey's up were very good. The chocolate cake and ice cream were 50%, the ice cream was good the cake was a week old at best. We were 4 people, we ordered 7 dinners, because we sent back 3 that could not be eaten. 2 lobsters, 1 @ 1.25 lbs, way over steamed and very soft. 1 @ 2 lbs. and way undercooked, so hard I broke a crown. My wife had clams over paste, if you like tons of garlic and tons of salt, you would like this dish. But really all 3 of these dishes were the worst seafood ever. One of my daughter has a NY steak and she like it. o we sent back the 2 lobsters and got 2 steaks. Once again loaded with garlic and salt. We both ate half the steak, which was served with cold baked potatoes and a side of slaw. Who serves steak with slaw as a vegetable? $29 NY strip with side of slaw. Very, very cheap!!!We all like garlic, BUT not drowning in garlic taste. The too much salt of top of the garlic.The clam chowder was frozen and watered down, the clams were like rubber.The server was nice and we gave her 20%. The food was not her fault, then kitchen is poorer then poor.The manger came over and told us the get the lobster fresh from Pt. Pleasant. I asked him if they got it fresh last week and then had it frozen until tonight, when the dropped it into  a steamer and over steamed 1 and then under steamed the other.They don't carry the wine my wife drinks, and they don't carry the gin I drink.If this chef was on Hell's kitchen, then he brought HELL with him.Bad, Bad, and Very Bad.",,,

This is our second time and while the food is good, I need to vent about two things.Service: each time we get our appetizer right away and had to wait close to 30 minutes for our entrees, which were served warm each time, not hot off the grill, more like sitting under a heat lamp.Soda: last night I was drinking Diet Coke and was charged for each one.

This should be changed to $$$.  Drinks were pricey as well.  I asked how spicy The Bloody Mary was and was able to try the mix. This had a little kick but it was not bad and I ordered one. This drink was way so spicy it was difficult to finish.  For $18.00 I should have been able to order it the way I wanted.  Overall it was a nice restaurant but I don't think I would go back.,,,

180,Rachel S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,0,2.0,6/19/2016,"Hit the bar for a cocktail & raw bar to kick off the night, don't bother waiting for a table or the entrees. And definitely don't try to come on a busy night. After good first time a few months ago, tried again last night. Food is okay, service is ""fine"" but they obviously have management/kitchen issues. No reason 2 cold entrees - a salad and lobster roll - should take over an hour to be prepared.At least offer us a round of drinks or dessert on the house. Too many other good places in town for my money.",,,
181,Mimi M.,"South Orange, NJ",0,3,0,4.0,8/31/2017,"We slipped in here last week as they were opening and enjoyed sitting outside on a breezy afternoon. Happy Hour has some great deals--drink of the day, Nelson's Folly(I believe)-delicious--we shared NE Clam Chowder, Clam&Chorizo fritters and each had steamed clams--loved everything. Our server, Kim, was friendly& knowledgeable--and all staff were welcoming and personable. Cool design elements inside...what can I say? It worked for us! Cheers!",,,
182,Brandon C.,"Englishtown, NJ",2,44,175,4.0,11/28/2015,We had the happy hour oysters. Two were from the east coast and four were from the west coast. My wife and I had 1 of each and we agreed the we both preferred the east coast oysters for their brineiness and fullness. Next we had the marinated olives. It was an interesting assortment of olives topped with a few anchovies and a serving of blanched almonds. We then split the jersey green clam chowder. It was a clam chowder with a green vegetable and herby broth. We enjoyed all of the dishes.,1,,1
183,Mark C.,"Secaucus, NJ",1,18,0,5.0,8/25/2015,"Have a hankering for succulent seafood in asbury? THIS is the place!My GF and I were in this predicament and remembered passing this place on a previous trip. Looking at their menu online it definitely fit the bill...plus gelato next door! Pro tip! : try and make reservation ahead of time. We walked in and at first were told it would be 30 minutes. However, luck was on our side and we only waited 15. Still, if you're hungry like we were, make reservations. It's only going to get more crowded from here because this place is so good. First: the decor is awesome in this place. Very modern old school vibe. Edison light bulbs in the light fixtures, a lot of metal and wood. Very cool. Second: as soon as you walk in, look to the right. There you'll find their impressive raw bar. Clams, shrimp, oysters, lobster...I'm having a craving relapse! Third: impressive, well-stocked bar. Different types of rums, beers, liqueurs. Bar staff very engaging and well versed in mixology. Fourth: do yourself a favor and get the clam fritters and the clam roll. You'll thank me later.",6,,1
184,Leslie F.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,9,0,3.0,9/6/2017,"The food was quite good.  The waitress was nice, but the kitchen was backed up terribly.  We arrived for our reservation at 7:00pm.  We received our entrees at 8:15pm.  The waitress said that ""this always happens on Sundays"" - however, it was Monday, not Sunday!  Friends warned us that the service was unpredictable, that it sometimes took a great deal of time for the food to come out.  For these prices I expect good food and I don't expect to wait 75 minutes for my food!",,,
185,Sarah H.,"New York, NY",4,7,0,1.0,8/24/2015,"Horrible place. You should never go there - this place will ruin your night. AWEFUL staff - They know nothing about customer service and are extremely impolite. It usually takes a lot to make me mad since I have this bubbly personality, but they achieved it. If you're not ready to open yet, just stay close. FYI people, reviews on facebook are fake. How can you have reviews about the restaurant before it even opened?",3,4,2
186,Xrsizer4u J.,"Red Bank, NJ",0,16,1,5.0,9/3/2017,Awesome place. Had to sit at high top as no more tables for the night!  Fine with us! Meal was great and server was the best! Our first time and will be back soon.,,,
187,A G.,"Jersey City, NJ",93,90,6,5.0,7/17/2017,"Review for Happy Hour... Amazing seafood and cheap drinks! $2 Rolling Rocks to accompany the steamed clams, peel and eat shrimp, and oysters are sweet. 4-7 on weekdays and 2-4 on weekends. The seafood is the freshest around. This happy hour is a must for the seafood lover. Eventually I'll get there for dinner, but the happy hour deals are so great that I'm never still hungry.",,,
188,Anita B.,"Old Bridge, NJ",11,9,17,5.0,8/15/2015,"Lobster Bisque was so tasty, lots of lobster chunks. Oysters were so tender. Staff is awesome!!!! Can't wait to go back and try rest of menu!!",4,,1
189,Gabrielle M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",108,7,0,5.0,8/22/2015,"Service was excellent. Our waiter was very informative and walked us through the raw bar menu. The oysters were so fresh and delicious, exactly the taste you want when you're on the shore. My husband and I both got the fresh catch as our entree, he got mako shark and I got tuna. Both were perfectly cooked and not overdone with any sauces that can sometimes overpower the flavor of the fish. Everything was very simply done.Good, fresh seafood with a cool rustic atmosphere. Will definitely be back for more.",3,,1
190,Tori B.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",0,13,0,5.0,7/23/2017,"Spent a Sunday afternoon happy hour here and it did not disappoint. A large group of us had drinks and a few of us took advantage of the happy hour food menu. The steamed clams were delicious and the raw bar was fresh. It was also discounted for happy hour which was even better! The drink menu has a Spanish flare, so they are not your typical bar drinks, but still tasty! Definitely recommend for a happy hour with friends.",,,
191,Marilyn J.,"Princeton, NJ",16,15,0,3.0,8/14/2017,"We called and was told the wait was one hour and that they were booked with reservations until 10:30 . We decided to go anyway. Walked in the door and was seated immediately.There were many tables open . on a Saturday night. What was that all about.? The clams were fresh and tasty. The salmon was good . The crablegs were also good. The only problem was the drink called ""Painkiller"" It had so much alcohol in it , I actually drank about 2 thimbles full when I started to feel really bad. I mean really bad , what kind of alcohol was in that ? If I drank one drink I would have had to be carried out. They took it off the bill.Thanks. The service was very good !",,,
192,Dan G.,"Newtown, PA",2,9,0,4.0,2/11/2017,"A great place to grab fresh seafood in the winter time. Go at happy hour to get oyster specials. Had a mako shark special for dinner that was fantastic. The restaurant is very nicely done, but can get a bit loud with the open floor plan. Overall a great experience and one of my favorite seafood places.",,,

194,Penny O.,"Whitefield, NH",54,6,0,2.0,8/7/2017,Food was ok not great given the prices.  it was very busy and honestly the service was horrible.  Bartender came to us 5 times in the first ten minutes we were there to get our order but once he got it it was a long time before he che led back in to see if we wanted more to drink.  Water was placed on the table for everyone and it was warm and a very long wait for food.  Will not go there again,,,

197,Johanna K.,"Astoria, NY",146,5,2,2.0,7/2/2017,"Friends and I ate dinner at Booney Read and had a mostly pleasant experience until we made the mistake of ordering a loaded baked potato. Little did we know that our idea of a ""loaded baked potato"" conflicted with that of the chef. Our waitress informed us when we requested shredded cheese and extra sour cream that the chef did not want to honor our request. We hadn't realized that this was Michelin Star rated restaurant! Needless to St our server came back to our table with more sour cream but without any cheese. Our waitress was of course embarrassed. We then spoke with the manager of the restaurant who was not understanding and sent us a second potato which was the second saddest thing we've ever see in our lives. We asked our server and the hostess about the manager and they both confirmed that he is unfriendly and unpleasant to work for. I sincerely hope the owner reads this as the chef and manager we both rude and did not grant their guests wishes.",,,

So we went immediately to put our name down and they said we can sit you now but we can't take your name for later. We didn't have our whole party so they said come back in an hour and see what we can do for you. An hour later we go back with our whole party, they say sorry we are completely booked we can't even take your name. They did offer a table outside in the rain with no cover. We got so frustrated we left.",,,
