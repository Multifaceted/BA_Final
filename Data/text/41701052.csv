1,Wilma G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",18,8,2,1.0,11/2/2018,"I placed an order over the phone for an egg salad sandwich, chips and a pineapple salad.  The delivery guy comes 30 minutes later (meanwhile, I'm a block away).  I look at my receipt and see that I was over charged.  I call the place, and I'm told that they charge an extra dollar for fruit when it's a delivery, plus another dollar for the actual delivery.  Who chargers an extra dollar to deliver fruit???? They send the wrong chips and refused and exchange them.  Never will I ever order from them again!!!",,,
2,Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",244,545,8,5.0,8/31/2018,"This is a small shop that is kind of like a deli but it has everything. I specifically went here for a healthy affordable chopped salad. I was quite impressed with the bountiful fresh options for toppings and the reasonable prices (about $10 for a salad with protein). It was affordable, service was efficient, and the salad was quite tasty. My only complaint is that the salad dressing lacked flavor and seemed watered down (I had the sesame ginger) but hopefully it was just that salad dressing and the others are good! I'll be sure to ask for a sample of the dressing next time. They also had smoothies, sandwiches, hot food, pasta, etc. and really anything you would truly want!",1,,

I ordered an egg & cheddar on a hero w/ black pepper & butter & they added ketchup (didn't ask for that) but it was a perfect touch & it was delicious!! I also had 2 small chocolate chip cookies (DELICIOUS!) The cookies tasted homemade,I loved them. My absolute fave part of my meal was the blueberry muffin. I asked for it to be warmed up & the guy also cut in half & put butter on it...YUMMMY!! The muffin tasted like they make it from scratch,I loved it. I will DEFINITELY BE BACK :)))",,,

The staff is ALWAYS very friendly and recognize me each time I go. They know how to deal with a lunch time rush, while being courteous and patient with their customers.The food is always extremely fresh and I appreciate their variety of food. Also, their prices are very fair. There's many places in the area that will overcharge you for a sandwich, but here you get fresh food and decent prices. Also, I really like that the restaurant is nice and big and there are plenty of places to sit. Overall, we enjoy coming here quite often, and truly feel that this place definitely beats the competition in the area.",1,,
6,Eve L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,8,0,3.0,6/22/2018,"The service has declined here within the last year. I dropped in while waiting for a movie and ordered a turkey burger with blue cheese -- an order I've gotten plenty of times before. The cook made my food while my husband waited and I sat. The cook never asked me or my husband if I wanted anything additional on the burger. Not only did he not give me the blue cheese but when I questioned him he said they don't have any-- something that should have been expressed when I placed the order. The cook instead gave me American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce ketchup AND mayo. None of which I wanted and walked away into the back while I was complaining about it. Extremely poor customer and I'll definitely be going to the Le Pain Quotidien across the street instead.",,,

Delicious salad - with kale, chicken, broccoli, scallions, chickpea and blue cheese + chipotle dressing. Really delicious combo, fresh and good portion (small) great for lunch size. Came with yummy multigrain bread (no butter). great option for $12 plus a tip. They don't charge delivery which is nice. The same salad at a big box place would be close to 15 plus tip. Will order again. Delicious and healthy!",,,

I got a chopped salad with 4 veggie toppings, shrimp, cheese and dressing for just under $10. Not the cheapest but more reasonable than some of the larger salad chains in the city. Very good! I also got pastries and chips--all good. I'm giving a four for service; my salad chef was attentive, but not very patient. He handed me my salad before asking me if I wanted my salad chopped and with dressing. I had to ask another employee to get me dressing on the side.",,,

The panini had tomatoes that had gone bad, making the whole thing inedible. A pretty simple veggie sandwich had an avocado that had gone bad. I just don't think they make (or throw out) the sandwiches in that window display on a regular basis. Stick to the prepared food, maybe.",,,

Updated review","Credit card fraud!After checking my online credit card statement just now, I see Green Cafe charged me $20.03 for the one salad we purchased. Scroll down for reviews from other yelpers noting their overcharging. They are robbing people blind, insane! They tell you the price at the register, then type in a different amount. I'm always looking at receipts, but I admit this one got passed me. They do not usually give receipts if I recall correctly. Word of advice, do not go there and if you do demand a receipt or pay in cash.",5,,
17,Arthur R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,15,8,5.0,3/16/2018,"My favorite BLT was delicious! Lots of bacon, just the way I like it. They have lines but service is very good. This place is organized. Nice and clean.",,,

Forgot 1/3 of the meal2. Forgot 1/3 of the meal3. Took an HOUR AND 45 minutes to deliver French toast five blocks. For 45 minutes the lady on the phone insisted the delivery guy would be here any minute. Why would I want initially hot food that had now been roaming the streets for 45 minutes? Why didn't it occur to them to send a new delivery guy if the first one vanished? Why not just comp the food at some point? I have no idea what happened to Green Cafe but they mess up every order and their customer service is non existent. I can't order from them anymore.",,,

20,Sasha D.,"Bronx, NY",2,9,3,4.0,4/6/2017,"I absolutely love their food here ! I mostly get their breakfast and lunch. They are fast and efficient ! Their prices are NYC prices, but it's definitely worth it.",,,
21,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,3.0,1/10/2013,"This new cafe just recently opened not too far from the subway stop I use to get back and forth to work. It's a nice addition the the area, and is definitely an improvement over the disgusting bagel shop that used to be in this spot. It's also an alternative to the Starbucks in the hood when craving a cup of coffee. The space itself is bright and cheerful looking. Still clean and shiny new. I noticed a manager/owner was barking out orders to the staff and having them make sure all was in order. I know they call this a cafe yet to me it's basically a glorified deli that is a step above with a large variety of food options and seating inside. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, pastries, coffees, cold drinks, salad bar, sandwiches, soups, entrees, desserts, pasta bar, etc.    I had an egg white and turkey sandwich here, and a cup of coffee before heading to work today for about $5. Not too bad, but pretty standard and served it's purpose. Seems they have multiple locations throughout the city so it is like a mini-chain of sorts. Still good to see something like this open up on the UES rather than another useless cell phone store or bodega.",9,5,4
22,Lizi C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",34,492,83,4.0,3/19/2013,"For a quick meal with no frills Green Cafe is a good option. The salad bar drew me in at $7.95 for a small, $8.95 for a large. Includes choice of lettuce, 4 veggies, one protein, one crunch (i.e. nuts, croutons etc) and one cheese.  The ingredients all appear fresh and are appetizing in presentation. They even chop it up for you when they mix it.   The restaurant feels clean and well lit.  There are tables and chairs and a big screen tv to watch as you dine.  Call me insecure, but some places I feel weird eating in alone, but Green Cafe is totally amenable to a solo diners just trying to grab a quick meal. Glancing at the menu the prices on most things seemed reasonable although slightly inconsistent.  i.e. $1.25 for a small coffee seems reasonable, but a ham egg and cheese on a roll is a little steep at $3.95.  Some of the drinks and snacks are a little overpriced.  i.e $2 for small bag of chips.  Just be cognizant of the prices and you shouldn't get ripped off.",2,,1

25,Linda T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/20/2017,"Green Cafe is not even worth one star.  Their customer service is the worst I've seen in any restaurant/cafe.  They are rude and you can barely understand what they even say.  English is clearly not a language they have learned yet.  They charge a difference price for the same item every time you go in. The food is old and stale.  It is never fresh and clearly not organic!! I'm not sure why they even have the name ""green"" Cafe.  It is extremely misleading.  When I purchased two muffins they said were made fresh that morning.  When I got home, they were both extremely dry and stale!! I went back to return and they initially wouldn't even take them back! Eventually they agreed but they were not going to give me back what I paid for them.  It was a situation where the woman at the register overcharged me.  A classic example of how they make up their prices on a whim.  It took me 15 minutes to get the money back that I paid (or should say overcharged) for two stale muffins.  They have not learned customer service, how to run a restaurant/cafe, make and buy fresh food and teach their employees how to speak English.  This place should not be in NYC or more importantly on the UES.  It is truly a disgrace.  Anyone who still decides to go into Green Cafe, I would do it with extreme caution.  If you want bottled water, do not pay for their tap water that they put in their own plastic bottle with their sticker on it.  What a gimmick! Again, showing how much this place is a rip off.  Best advice...stay away!!!! There are so many restaurants/Cafe just across the street!",1,,

I needed a quick snack to hold me over while waiting in the long line to enter on a pay what you'd like day. I ordered a smoothie and a cinnamon raisin roll with a little icing drizzle over it.  Either I was very hungry and it was great or as my friend said who was not particularly hungry, it was just alright.

In these situations it fits my needs very well: it's fast, the vegetarian food isn't awful, and the prices (while certainly less than ideal) are manageable. If I lived on the Upper East side, I'd surely get sick of them soon and find more to gripe about, but for now I can just say I'm not blown away by anything about this place, but I've never been majorly disappointed either. Best thing I've had: fried egg white bagel sandwich with cheddarWorst thing I've had: cherry streusel square (under-baked and cloyingly sweet).",,,

32,Maria K.,"New York, NY",4,41,7,1.0,12/17/2013,"The manager/owner is a jerk and I rarely say that about anybody. This is what happened: I was in there with some people. The place was not super crowded but the cashier was busy. We all ordered and handed the cashier our form of payment. It was one of those days that we wanted something to drink since it is snowing out and a warm drink hits the spot.After patiently waiting for some time, the person making our drinks handed our hot chocolates to us. All of a sudden, this guy who might be the owner/manager came in our direction and accused us of not paying for our drinks. We ordered a total of six drinks on two separate tabs. Four on one and two on the other. We handed the cashier our credit card and cash, respectively. The owner accused us of not paying at all since we do not have our receipts. Umm... the cashier did not hand us our receipts at all so how is this the customer's problem? There was a whole stack of receipts in front of the cashier, so it might just be the cashier who does not give people their receipts in general but I don't understand how any of this is the customer's problem. Long story short, the manager/owner was extremely rude to us, especially to the young lady who is half the owner's age. Seriously, a real man should not yell at a little girl. It was uncalled for. I had to come to the young lady's defense since the cashier and the workers there seem to cower under his tyranny.Usually I thought the food at this place was okay and the people who work there are okay but after this incident, I have to come on Yelp and let people know that Green Cafe's management is terrible!This is a business with a rude mindset. I rather give my money to people who are kind.",6,,

Updated review","UPDATE: This place is a SCAM. They rip you off by overcharging you thinking you won't notice. This is the 3rd time that I've been checking out at the register and questioned the price and they've had to give me money back for overcharging. Today got 2 water bottles, an egg sandwich and a yogurt and they asked for 20 bucks. Normally I don't pay that much attention but it seemed like a lot so I questioned it. Low and behold, they overcharged (third time) and had to give me money back. There's always a ""new employee"" ""learning"" the register. Anyone else have this experience there? I swear they probably get away with it 9/10 times. It's a good scam actually, but really uncool.",1,,

35,Mark T.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",18,213,68,1.0,2/2/2014,"When this place first opened, I was excited there was a new café/grille spot nearby.  Unfortunately, they do not have enough help in the grille area. They consistently get overwhelmed, get orders wrong and the orders take a long time if there is a line. I always try to give them another try but they constantly fail.  My most recent visit was today, 02/02/14.  I ordered 1 breakfast platter and also an egg with turkey bacon sandwich.  Approximately 6-7 people after me received their orders.  I inquired about my order and ""they"" said oh, sorry its coming up.  I walked out.  That was my last attempt, I wont be going back.  The owners aren't customer friendly either.",1,,

The employees don't look like they hate their jobs yet! Seriously, I went here for lunch twice last week and everyone was so cheerful and peppy. I was taken aback by all the friendly service! Fingers crossed it stays that way. I like the salad bar because the price for a small (read: normal serving size) includes a protein and a cheese and a fruit/nut and four veggies.

There's seating, including a nice banquette against one wall, and delivery.My chicken panini was good, my smoothie a bit watery (and lacking a to-go lid). Nothing on the lengthy menu looks brilliant or even unusual, but everything is solid, and the folks here seem eager to get things right.The place was overrun after school with Dalton students.

43,Seyhan C.,"Manhattan, NY",28,7,0,1.0,12/21/2014,"If you're going to advertise something, and not follow through with it. Then don't advertise it.I ordered off Seamless and ordered the Pancakes from there that said would be served with Eggs and home fries, which seemed basic, as every other deli or diner serves that same exact dish combination.My order arrives and I only received pancakes with toast. Which seemed like a strange combination. So I call them back up and tell them that my order was missing the eggs and home fries (also says comes with strawberries but I didn't care for the strawberries at this point, as long as I can get the eggs and home fries that was advertised through Seamless) so I call them back up and I had to speak to 2 people. The people that worked there kept playing hot potato with the phone, probably didn't want to speak to me. Before I could even say more than hello and mention that my order being wrong, they hung up. So I call back and the manager picks up this time I think (only one that had the balls)Finally we get into it, talking as polite as I can because I don't wanna see anything out of the ordinary in my food if I do get it,I tell him my address, name and order, also that I'm missing the eggs and home fries with the order. He tells me they've ran out of home fries, so I then mention am I going to get the home fries and eggs? He says I only have French fries left if that's okay (honestly, at this point I'll take anything just to get the rest of my meal and off the phone with him) so I mention how about the eggs as well. He says okay, eggs too. Scramble okay? (Prefer sunny side but again, anything to get off the phone and get the rest of my meal so I can enjoy my breakfast at the end)So, we've came to a compromise, French fries over home fries (whatever) and the eggs at last. But I kid you not, no less than 30 seconds. The deli calls back and says the pancakes doesn't come with eggs and home fries and just kept saying sorry and thank you while trying to hang up. I wasn't even going to fight it, I just said okay and hung up.This is just my experience, was a pretty sh*tty first experience. Take my review however you'll like, But I'll never order from them again. They also seemed like a bunch of di*ks over the phone too. I should have just stood with the Deli I'm most familiar with and along with knowing the people too. Which is the Blue Moon Deli on 92nd & First.For the food by the way, the pancakes were decent. The toast was stale.",2,,
44,A K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,131,0,4.0,7/31/2016,"The delivery was a bit slow but the food was better. I ordered the chicken quesadilla, and the almond poppy muffin with butter. The quesadilla was quite good (sour cream and salsa were watery) but the almond poppy muffin tasted a bit bland (a lemon zest would make it better). But the prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good so I'll probably order from here again sometime.",,,
45,Ross W.,"Manhattan, NY",30,71,1,1.0,8/19/2014,Weak deli here. I wanted to like them and figure they have to improve on the lousy bagel spot that was here but nope. I have given them three different tries to win me over but my meal was never better than mediocre and today's was just bad. I rarely see people in there when I pass by which is pretty much every day and I will be surprised if it still exists in a year. One block either way is Milano or bocado which both do everything better than this dump,3,1,

Walked it back to them to show them, spoke with the ""manager"" and when I said I thought I was getting a combo breakfast platter and showed him on seamless that it says what the order comes with, he said it was wrong and it doesn't come with that..  They increased their prices a few months back and never updated it on seamless.  He wasn't apologetic at all about the fact I had been misled or about the fact I had a hair in my food.  I just got my replacement food and left, haven't been back since.",,,

52,Ratalie N.,"New York, NY",0,24,0,1.0,6/25/2014,"As there are not many 'make-your-own salad' restaurants in the area (food desert!),  I'm somewhat forced to order from Green Cafe on the rare occasion that I order lunch.  The first time I ordered, the salad was good, but the delivery was atrocious.  Aside from not following my directions and arriving at the wrong location, I had ordered AND PAID EXTRA for an extra dressing on the side.  This dressing was not included and when I called Green Cafe, they said,  ""do you actually want us to refund you $1?"".  I responded that I should be refunded for an item that I paid for and did not receive, regardless of the actual price of the item.  They proceeded to transfer me to a few people who all equally thought I was doing something wrong in feeling I was entitled to a refund and then, finally, I spoke with a representative who agreed to do it.  It has been weeks and I'm still awaiting this fabled refund.   I gave them 1 last shot today and my lettuce arrived in an inch of water.  It was soggy, brown, and utterly disgusting.  This will absolutely be my last order from this restaurant.  An utter disappointment.  For $10 a salad, it ought to be impeccable.  Rude customer service, illiterate delivery people, and soggy, brown lettuce just don't cut it.",1,,

55,Allison D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,0,1.0,11/24/2013,"I'm befuddled by some of these positive reviews. This is the consistently worst place I've ever been to; my boyfriend, friends, family all agree. I live a block away so I've tried it at least 5 times, hoping each time it will be able to get something right. However, I was sadly disappointed each and every time.I tried a bagel toasted with cream cheese, it was cold and absolutely awful. I tried two of their wraps, again, bland and gross. I tried a salad, and a sandwich as well, and they were as terrible as each other item I've tried. The final straw was buying a teeny tiny, $5 cupcake of some sort and literally gagging it up, it was completely stale. I don't understand how a place could get such simple things so wrong every single time. The only decent thing I ever got from there was a danish pastry, at 8am. I'm praying somewhere new will move in ASAP!",1,,

We went for lunch shortly after it opened and have now been back for a few breakfasts and some quick dinners too. There have been many days where we have eaten multiple meals from Green Cafe. I recommend the hot sandwiches and the make your own salads as well as the bagels for breakfast.,1,,

I love to go there and seat and relax while enjoying watching people coming in and out or seating around me having a great variety of sandwiches, soups, salads, eggs, pastas, burgers, fruits, pastries, juices, coffee, etc. Prices are very reasonable in comparison with other cafes  in the UES area. The place is very clean and gleam with a great panoramic windows facing the street but I have to say that I complaint very often because the tables doesn`t get clean often. The service is great and very courteous and like Meagan C. said they are always happy, cheerful and peppy. I will see you there. Enjoy it!",,,
