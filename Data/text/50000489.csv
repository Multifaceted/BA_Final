0,Teri L.,"Richmond, Canada",103,264,204,4.0,11/18/2018,"MMmm cooookieeesss.We heard great things about this place so we had to check it out. It was only a few blocks from our apartment so we stopped by on the way home from dinner. It's a small store, easy to miss but you can just follow the smell of freshly baked cookies.  They have about 9 classics to choose from and 3-4 specialty cookies. You can have just the cookies, with a scoop of ice cream or as an Cookie ice cream sandwich!We each got the Cookie a la mode - a scoop of ice cream and a cookie. I had the white chocolate raspberry on a white chocolate macadamia cookie and the bf had the oreo ice cream on a snickerdoodle. We also took home a box of 6 for the rest of the trip. I love that the cookies were so fresh and warm. I think they kept them in a warming oven and they kept very well the next couple days. I would say they are a bit pricey but that's expected of a ""specialty"" cookie place in Manhattan.",,,
1,Veronica C.,"Bronx, NY",202,95,191,5.0,3/26/2018,"Stopped into this location, which is tucked away in an alcove up a short flight of stairs. Upon entering, my colleague and I were greeted by warm smiles and the smell of freshly baked cookies! I had the ice cream sandwich and selected chocolate chip cookie dough filling sandwiched between a confetti and chocolate chip cookie. That was probably the best sandwich I've ever had. The ice cream is super rich, and the cookies absorb most of the mess. I also picked up a macadamia chip cookie, which is on par with the best of them! The storefront is cozy and has a lot of natural light coming in.  The sweetest part of the experience was chatting with the staff and store manager. After learning we were in the area for a conference, the lovely manager prepared a box of complimentary cookies to bring back and share with the conference attendees. Excellent marketing opp, and several attendees said they'd be going back in the future. Thank you D. for such a kind, sweet gesture!",1,,3
2,Raquel A.,"Manhattan, NY",1471,179,1102,2.0,1/6/2018,Came in because the smell outside was calling!! But the truth is they smell better then they taste. If I have to pick a favorite it would be the white chocolate macadamia nut.I also noticed they make the cookies much smaller then the sample looks at the register.,6,2,2
3,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",465,862,4808,3.0,1/4/2018,"Some cookies taste delicious when they are warm and fresh from the ovens, but then taste horrible the next day when they're cold. Insomnia Cookies are those kinds of cookies.It was freezing cold the day I went, so these cookies were a lifesaver. The Chocolate Chunk is super gooey and delicious. The Oatmeal Raisin is pretty average. My favorite was the Double Chocolate mint. It wasn't actually very minty since they use mint chips, but it was still good. It's $1.80 per cookie. I like that they show the calories per cookie right on the menu board. It doesn't make me eat any less cookies, but it's nice to know. The shop is tiny, so if there was a crowd, it would be hard to eat the cookies there. Definitely eat these fresh if you can. The next day the cookies were rock hard and way too sweet. They are actually pretty low quality cookies the next day, but amazing while they're warm.",6,3,4
4,Steven C.,"Bronx, NY",17,89,110,3.0,8/16/2018,3 1/2 star cookies. Good but nothing special. Not much of a variety just regular normal cookies. Nothing like the options at smackeries. Best part about insomnia is they are open late to fulfill your late night cookie cravings,,,
5,Risa S.,"New York, NY",4,193,383,5.0,5/9/2018,Delivery review! Just ordered a delivery to be made to my friends' office that's 3 blocks away. Made the order (12 cookies) through yelp around 11:40am (on a Wednesday) and it's now 12pm and my friend just called me saying he got them. Estimated delivery time on the app said 12:14pm so it definitely arrived sooner. I know there are a lot of reviews on here stating how delivery is horrible. And I was expecting them to take around 1 to 2 hours reading the reviews. But it only took them 20min. I'm guessing it really depends on the time and day (and maybe the staff?) I have no complaints and my friends are happy.,,,
6,Fay A.,"Seattle, WA",18,136,113,4.0,4/4/2018,"I would probably give this place a 3.5. It's super tiny and there is no seating, it's the type of place you would come to grab some cookies on the go. There were many of us crammed in front of the cashier while waiting for or cookies.They have a good selection of cookies such as snickerdoodle, macadamia nut, m&m and double chocolate chip. They also make cookie cakes, do deliveries, and have milk in the back.Service was pretty good and efficient in taking and giving our orders.I ended up getting a m&m cookie and it was pretty good when warmed, pretty heavy too. It wasn't that great of a cookie but it wasn't bad either. I would say there are probably better places in the city to get cookies, but this isn't a bad choice either of your craving cookies.",,,1

The girl up front didn't seem too thrilled to be there but she put my dozen cookies together in a box, I paid, and I went on my merry way.The cookies here are fresh but some were super warm, others were not.

There's room for about 6 people inside and there are two stools at a small counter for people to enjoy their sweets. Service here is inconsistent and the quality of the cookies to me isn't as good as other locations.But, I keep coming back because I love the cookies. My favorite flavors are chocolate chunk, double chocolate mint, oatmeal raisin, and snickerdoodle. I also enjoy the cookiewich with red velvet or cookies and cream ice cream.

15,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,3.0,6/28/2017,"I'm so disappointed to only give a 3 star review because I love these cookies.The cookies alone are without a doubt worth 5 stars, and I actually was going to give this location a 5 star review until I read through some other feedback and started remembering a bunch of hiccups that affected my experience.First of all, I live 3 blocks away from the location.  The first time I ordered, I expected the cookies within an hour or so but it took about 2.5 hours for them to arrive. By the time I actually received the cookies, I didn't even want them anymore and I was ready to go to bed. I had to call the customer service line multiple times for any type of status update.I was granted a coupon on my upcoming order so I was fine with that.For my next order, which was of 30 cookies, the coupon code that was issued to me didn't even work. And I was within the bounds of expiration. I was apparently also entitled to a free cookie with my order based on the app's promo, but that code wasn't accepted in the app either! No freebies for me! This particular order did come promptly at least, but the app scrambled up my address and there was a misunderstanding with delivery. I'm just sick and tired of these fake promotions and coupons and complicated customer service. All I want to do is order my cookies, and receive them within a reasonable time-frame. If it takes 3 hours to deliver cookies, just say so! Also don't send out promotional codes that don't work. It's insulting.",3,,1
16,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",161,340,2193,3.0,12/10/2016,"No where else but a city like NYC can you get hot out of the oven cookies delivered to your doorstep at just about any hour of the day or night... I get the feeling this company was the brainchild of someone who gets ""the munchies"" at all hours, if ya catch my drift...  lolz :-P ;-). The cookies are really good, warm, and fresh and there is a variety of cookies to choose from..  chocolate chunk to double chocolate mint chip to oatmeal to sugar to snickerdoodle to peanutbutter chip etc..  Have never had issues with delivery as others have mentioned. I do think they are overpriced for what you get though.. I think the icecream sandwich cookiewich is worth $5.50 for sure. $10 for 6 cookies plus a delivery fee on top of a tip is a bit overpriced. In a way I am glad they are not so wallet friendly, otherwise I'd have warm cookies just about every day! Lolz.I mistakenly ordered bigwiches last time.. Be careful not to mix up your ""-wiches""! Cookiewich is an icecream sandwich.Bigwich is an icing (vanilla buttercream I think) sandwich. Bigwich was meh for me, I wanted icecream!! :-( was my bad).",3,,

However, anytime I'm in the city I have to run into an Insomnia before I begin my journey back to LI. Yea I'm being dramatic but these cookies though (insert heart eye emoji) yummmmm. I believe there's at least 10 Insomnia Cookies scattered around Manhattan. Who can come between a person and their warm cookies and milk??? This specific location is super tiny though lol. You have to get in and out and hope there's no line.The concept of late night cookies with delivery options are dope. I think they deliver to you up to about 3am. I never came and was disappointed. Yummy chocolately ooey gooey goodness that just melts in your mouth. Don't go too crazy though--diabetic shock might ensue. But I do like to spoil myself then drink about a half gallon of water after to make me feel better about all the calories and sugar I just consumed.Hey, live a little.

Get with the program, please. I work within delivery range of this location and sometimes my coworkers have the insatiable craving for overpriced cookies. An insatiable craving that needs to be satisfied as quickly as possible. Of course we are all reasonable human beings here. An hour delivery? Not a problem. When we start to get into the 2 hour + delivery time frame, you can just keep the cookies and forget it (at $2.50 per cookie especially, on a 20-25 cookie order). Last time we ordered the cookies at 3:45 pm and they did not get here before close. We close at 6 pm. What the hell???Is this ""too-long-cookie-delivery-time"" a white girl/first world problem? Of course it is. But if your entire job is to deliver a $50 order of cookies, then damn could you do it under 2.5 hours?",5,2,

Was told 6 cookies were 10.50 or 11.00, i really don't remember. The box had 8 cookies and the girl said she made a mistake and gave me her employee discount which she couldn't change, so cookies were around 5.50. Thank you.....I think.2nd time, 6 cookies again, no extras from this girl, cookies stale, price 7.523rd time, same girl from first time, some cookies a little hard others soft, I'm thinking 7.52 price she says 11.00 and i gave you 3 extra. Not to sound ungrateful, but if you give me extra that i didn't ask for and charge me more, give me the 6 cookies at 6 cookie price.My best advice for anyone going to this location get clear pricing and if they give you extras without you asking that means free in my book so don't pay extra or return the extras.

Walked in and got the a la mode and a cookiewich, which are self-explanatory items.The issue here primarily is the ease with which the cookies can be eaten in this way. The cookiewich allows you to choose two different cookies as well as the ice cream flavor. I got the trip chocolate and another one with whoopie pie flavored ice cream. All the elements separately were good, and they mildly heated up the cookies. However, it was so hard to eat! They basically give you a small pizza box and you're there to fend for yourself. My cookies were not that soft, so it took a little digging to be able to get a chunk out. The ice cream melted within 2-3 minutes, so there was a puddle around my cookie sandwich. Sad!It's also quite pricey for what you get. However, if you are craving gourmet cookies, maybe come and get the cookies and have some ice cream on the side?",5,1,3

I imagine weekends are busier, so why not increase manpower so that your customers will return? My roommate and I have to call repeatedly and promises of delivery in 15 minutes are unfulfilled after these calls. Please improve your delivery service and then I'll return as a faithful customer.

At 3pm, I checked the tracking and it said it was delivered. I went to our front desk and the lobby and it was nowhere to be found.

We called for an eta at 11:20pm (40 minutes later) with a response that they had to wait for the driver to come back to the store to pick up our order but he'd get them to us soon. We accepted that at the time. We placed a second follow up call at 12 midnight (an hour and twenty minutes) and the response was that the driver was on his way. Still no explanation and no offer of any kind of compensation for the inconvenience until we essentially demanded it. Then we were offered coupons for our next purchase which is a bullshit marketing ploy by the way. At 12:20 we called again because guess what still no cookies. We were then informed that the driver had left with three orders seven minutes prior. We were again offered coupons for future orders but informed there would be no compensation on our current order which we had almost been waiting two hours for. We were actually instructed to simply ""not answer the door"". This has been the most appalling customer service interaction of my life and I've worked in customer service for the past ten years. I suggest NEVER ordering from this company.Update at 1:30 am: the delivery guy finally showed up and the only thing he had to say was ""Hey, how are you?"" As if nothing at all had happened.

Additionally, we were about to walk out after we got our cookies and the worker told a customer to wait just a sec. I thought he was going in the back of the store to do something. No, he needed to send a text.Who does this? I guess this is the new worker of today. Each time I see this when I go into an establishment, I tell my kids what not to do in the workforce.

For delivery, I've tried ordering through the website twice - once, we waited multiple hours for the wrong order to arrive, and another time we waited two hours, contacted customer service (which only gets you through to the national insomnia cookies line) to someone who just said ""oh wow, you really have been waiting two hours, yeah, they look really back up here.

It definitely makes sense that most of their business is delivery or take out, the place is a tiny room with a bench and the counter.  I was under the impression that this was only cookies but was pleasantly surprised to see they have ice-cream and you can make a of ice-cream cookie sandwich. As soon as I saw the smores cookie I knew I needed to have that.  I love marshmallows and eat them every chance I get.  We ordered a smores and macadamia nut cookie sandwich, the very nice guy working there told us that you cannot order a regular and deluxe cookie to create the sandwich. Both have to be deluxe or regular, this made sense later on when I saw the size difference between the two.  We insisted and he was nice enough and gave in and made our cookie sandwich with a,deluxe Abe regular. The smores cookie was delicious, warm gooyie and the melted marshmallows was amazing! The other macadamia nuts cookie was good but didn't really compare to the smores.

She notified us of the promotion and gave us her opinion on what we should order and what is most popular. We got and dozen mixed cookies (no deluxe) we will try that next time. The cookies were moist, warm and decadent. I'm a dessert lover and have tried a number of different type of cookies but none quite as nice. I really enjoyed them. My favorite was the double chocolate chunk and my boyfriend enjoyed the oatmeal raisin best. The shop was really clean, it was small and didn't offer space for seating. They also serve ice cream which would be nice for the summer. The only thing is that the parking situation was hard, I just left my hazards on and parked in a no parking zone for the few minutes that we were in there.

Both these cookies were so hard and generic tasting. It really didn't taste much better than something you could buy in the grocery store. In fact, I would have preferred buying something store bought. The marshmallows in the s'mores cookie were hard and chewy, they stuck to my teeth making it hard to eat, and was overly sweet. The peanut butter cups in the peanut butter cookie just seemed thrown in. And the cookie part itself was dry. Served warm and fresh? I don't think so. More like old, hard, and sitting there for days. Terrible cookies. And to top it off, service was bad. I was the only customer in the store, but the employee was too busy cleaning to want to help.I'm really surprised that this place is even around. It's a great concept, so maybe that's why. I imagine this place is open due to its convenience, and not the actual product. I knew this place wasn't going to be in the same league as say Levain Bakery, but it should at least taste better than something I could buy in a tube and throw in the oven. I was expecting them to at least have a similar generic quality and taste found at a Mrs. Fields in the mall. Nope. I took a couple bites and threw the rest in the trash. FYI, this place is super small and has some steps leading up to the business. For sure not a place to bring a stroller and/or wheelchair.

I asked for the offer immediately and decided on the white chocolate chip with macadamia nut cookie. First bite - Taste just like I remembered from my good old college days - warm, gooey, soft and super sweet. Wished I had a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream to go along with. To be honest, the cookie itself tastes very much like the ones u can get from subways - maybe just pop the subway ones into the microwave for 10 secs. Nevertheless still very tasty!

We order three cookies and receive two...no big deal, because we thought we could be either reimbursed for the other cookie or sent a new one in its place. I know what you're thinking - one lost cookie is not a big deal, but we really wanted that cookie.

We walked in to a gentleman sitting on a crate behind the counter with his headphones on and phone in hand. He did not even bother to look as us but put his finger up and said ""someone will help you in a second"". Oh, alright. So there we are, standing around for 5 more minutes until a young lady walks out with her hair in her hands. She proceeded to finish braiding her hair while saying ""how can I help you"". You cant.

Upon entering, the young lady manning the register informed me, that they had ran out of all but three cookies. I ordered one of each, to split with my coworker later. When the nice young lady handed me the cookies in the bag, imagine my shock when I felt the warmth of the cookies. The cookies were warm & soft. I can't remember the last time I experienced that. I thanked the young lady and hurried back to the train station to head back to my office. When I got back to my office and took them out of my purse, they were still warm & soft. Each one split so easily in half, for me to share. Let me get to the flavors:Sugar Cookie - Typical sugar cookie but it being fresh and not hard like most I get from other places, made me enjoy it more than I usually do.Peanut Butter Cookie - Sometimes I like peanut butter cookies and sometimes I don't want to deal with the after taste. This wasn't the case. Remember how I said the cookie was still warm. How couldn't you? I keep mentioning it. Anyway, the peanut butter pieces/bit, just melt in your mouth. It's the perfect amount of chewy goodness.Dark Chocolate Mint - Anything dark chocolate, I must try. Adding mint, is a bonus. I think my eyes or a combination of my eyes & stomach were playing tricks on me. This cookie looked bigger than the other two. I saved it for last, so I could savor the taste.I am going back. They have more flavors that I need to try.",3,3,3

Its all about me, me, me when writing a review.Anyway,  while on our long journey to Morning Star Café, our GPS was so nice to lead us on the trail to pass by Insomnia Cookies. My future ma-in-law saw the sign, pointed and said ""look, Karen!"" She was happy to have someone in her life to share her greed for chocolate with. Open late? That's great! ""We have to try those one night when we're in the room"". We really had a conversation about ordering these cookies before our weekend stay in NYC was up.So we did. We ordered a dozen cookies. The goal was to only order 6 - 2 per person - myself, my beau and his mother. Then the rep just had to tell me that I was honored 3 free chocolate chip cookies! Yay! I am like the 100th caller tonight or something? This must be my lucky night. Then she offered milk? really? How cute is that. I declined. I don't drink milk and my beau def didn't need any dairy at 1am.I was sent the cutest email that had the status of my cookies - they let me know when they were baking and when they went out for delivery - each status identified with different levels of stacked cookies. How cute.  The cookies were delivered in no time. The concierge buzzed to let me know that we had a delivery. I was hoping that they could just come up. I had already twisted my hair and everyone else was sleeping. Since it was my idea to order them, I guess I had to pick them up. Ugh! The delivery dude was cool. He had the cookies in had. I wanted to eat one sooo badly while on the elevator but I decided to wait to reveal these warm goodies to everyone else. They smelled so good!Here's what was in the box:Chocolate Chip - divineDouble Chocolate - heavenlyMacadamia Nut & White Choc - amazingPeanut Butter - greatOatmeal - yummyThey had so many other flavors that Im curious to try.Overall these oowee gooeey cookies were the BOMB!

The kind of cookies you dream about when you've got a sweet tooth and a hunger for something warm, heavenly, and satisfying.  Delivery on a busy day can take an hour or more, but if you stop by and pick up, you get them fresh.

I only make these bad reviews because I'm shocked when people seem to give excellent reviews to restaurants that are so clearly average or even bad.  Have Americans completely lost their taste and ability to distinguish good food?",2,1,1

Moving on to the review: cookies are excellent, warm, fresh , ooey- gooey, super good. Delivery took 30 minutes, 15 less than expected, delivery guy was very polite. Ice cream isn't great, I think it's Hershey's or some similar flavorless brand, but whatever, that's really my preference, the cookies more than made up for the lack of flavor in my moosetracks.",,,1

Your options are to have a limited menu or order through their horrible website and app. Ordered tonight and after waiting 30+ minutes noticed an email that stated there was a problem with my order. Called into their support number as instructed in the email and from the start all I got was attitude Me: Hello. I placed and order about 30 minutes ago rudely interrupted Rep: well it takes 45min to an hour Me: that's ok but I got an email that stated there is an issue with my orderRep: What's your order number? Hold on while I contact the store. Rep: Well you didn't put your phone number in the order so that's why it didn't go through. Me: Ok well I didn't see a place to put my number. Rep: if you ordered from the mobile there is definitely a place to put your number.Me: Well if the number was so important that it was required for the order perhaps it should be a required field just like the payment method is. Rep: Don't get an attitude with me I'm just trying to let you know the reason your order didn't go through is because you didn't put your phone number on the order. At this point I was tired of being caught in the ghetto hell of insomniac cookies customer service so I let her know to forget the order and all future orders for that matter,2,,

155,kim r.,"Manhattan, NY",1,36,2,2.0,4/6/2016,"This is a review for the Insomnia Cookies online delivery service.I ordered cookies as a gift to surprise someone. The website is very unclear. If you click ""ship cookies"" in the top nav, there is a statement in bold underneath that says ""Orders placed before 3pm Monday - Friday will be shipped same day."" To me, ordering in NEW YORK and delivering to a NEW YORK address, that certainly reads as the cookies will be shipped and arrive same day, as long as I order prior to 3pm. This is not the case. You place the order, and the cookies are then shipped GROUND UPS unless you upgrade. This is very unclear and led to me sending cookies that subsequently arrived when the intended recipient was traveling and could not pick up the package. Additionally, once you receive your order confirmation email, there is a link to track your cookie order. Guess what - it doesn't work. I called multiple times and was told that I had to call UPS to find out where my order was. For 2 days, Insomnia could not provide me even a tracking number to do so. On day 3, I called again, and they again told me to call UPS myself. I asked the customer service agent why she couldn't just track the order for me. This did not go over well. I was put on hold for 5 minutes while the customer service agent tried to track my order. It turns out that the cookies had already been delivered. I asked how I, as a customer, was supposed to be able to confirm delivery, since Insomnia never sent me a UPS tracking number. I asked what action I could have taken if the recipient had never received the order. The woman had no answer for either of these questions.Will not be ordering again.",1,,

157,Gaby R.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",18,5,1,1.0,8/26/2013,"I love Insomnia Cookies generally - their peanut butter cookies are always soft and gooey, even after they've cooled off, and without that chemical rubbery texture that manufactured ""soft-baked"" cookies have. This is not about the cookies. This is about the service at this particular location.I was really excited about the Midtown East location, since I regularly visit the Upper East Side location when I visit family that live near there, and I was always disappointed I couldn't order late night cookies to my own apartment. Tonight's terrible service has really turned me off ordering again. I ordered 4 oatmeal raisin, 4 peanut butter, and took advantage of the 3 free chocolate chip deal. My cookies arrived but I was in the middle of eating dinner so I didn't look in the box. When I looked in it some time later, even though the receipt was taped to the top of the box with my order, I got 6 chocolate chip and a snickerdoodle - lolwut (not to mention that it was 4 cookies less than what my order was for)? I called their excellent customer service line and spoke with a lovely rep named Aggie who gave me a coupon, assured me that my correct order would come in about half an hour (and that it would have been sooner had the delivery person not already been out on deliveries), and said that she had told them to deliver mine first since at that point I'd made my order an hour before. Oh, and I could keep the extra mistaken cookie order.An hour LATER (i.e. two hours after my initial order, so either Aggie lied or was ignored; I live less than 10 blocks away from the location), the delivery guy arrives, shoves the box in my hands and leaves (before I've even managed to open the taped-shut box to check that my order was correct this time). A third of the cookies were in pieces. The midtown east location is terribly staffed, I have to say. I've walked in a couple times and the contrast between the sullen staff there and the nicer staff at the Upper East Side location is stark. It's a pity because I was really excited to have a closer Insomnia Cookies that would actually deliver to me. So much for that. It'll be better for my figure anyway.",1,,

Ordered a cake here to be delivered to my friend on the morning of her birthday. I tracked the order and it said it was delivered. I found it weird I hadn't heard from her and checked if they got it and they said no!! I called and they told me they had sent it to the wrong address and could send it out tonight. Their was no extra offer or anything to make up for the fact that my friend would not receive this cake the morning of her birthday but rather it would be left with the doorman now to be received late at night after she got home from celebrating. Not what I wanted!! I should have learned my lesson the first time I placed an order with them for pick up and when I got there was informed they accidentally sent it out for delivery. Seriously how hard is it to read an order correctly?!? I am furious and will not make the mistake of ordering anything from insomnia again.Update- the second cake that they sent to make up for it never arrived either!!!

I was really hoping this place was going to replace or at least be another option for me when I can't get to my favorite place. Insomnia is located in a very convenient location in midtown east right near the 6/E/M trains. Now about the cookies... when you buy it, they give it to your warm and the normal cookies cost $1.50. The reason why I don't like it is simply it is not my type of cookie so to be fair the rating is based on my taste. Their cookies are the ones that are hard, crunchy on the outer edge with a soft chewy middle. I ordered a chocolate chip and a snickerdoodle. Chocolate chip was very average and ordinary with the chips all melty and snickerdoodle was a huge disappointment. It tasted like a sugar cookie with cinnamon sprinkled on top. I know... that is basically what a snickerdoodle is but I definitely had a much better snickerdoodle that had enough cinnamon sugar on top that tasted separate from a sugar cookie and was soft and chewy. Their snickerdoodle just felt dry and crunchy. Tasted kind of pathetic. If I was an insomniac and I wanted cookies I would not come here and instead go bake my own from scratch. Probably tastes better than this place ;p Also, staff was not attentive at all. I went there around 6pm with no one in the store and probably stood in front of the counter for 5 minutes before being greeted by anyone. Maybe they were playing angry birds or fell asleep :p This cookie monster will keep searching for some other place.",1,,

I recommend the cookie ice cream sandwiches where you have the option to choose which cookies and ice cream you want.
