After walking the Brooklyn Bridge and exploring Dumbo, we decided to stop at this bar to watch THE soccer match (Real Madrid V.S. Liverpool).  All tables were full and there was no more room for a single soul. We only noticed a waitress/bartender and a cook- later on another bartender arrived.  For one person to be able to take care of more than 50ish people all thirsty and hungry, she did a perfect job.  I noticed how she was getting to every sigue customer on a timely manner.  No angry customer. Well, only those that were cheering for Liverpool.",,,1
1,Ashley P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",55,23,26,4.0,10/9/2018,"I went here for a birthday party on Saturday and had a blast. The cocktails were well made, the bartenders were friendly, and the food was delicious. There was a big spread of finger foods for the party (sliders, chicken fingers, parmesan truffle fries, veggie platter, quesadillas, veggie spring rolls). The parmesan truffle fries...omg...so good!! The venue is cozy, but fit our group of about 50 perfectly. There was a DJ, but they still had the baseball playoff game on in the back. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the AC was broken and there was a lot of body heat dancing around the bar!",,,
2,Ryan B.,"Lodi, NJ",4,3,0,4.0,11/13/2018,"It's a nice bar close to commute. No wait time, seated immediately. It was Tuesday, so they had deals every day of the week like most bars. That day was half-priced appetizers. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and my friend got the Cowboy Burger. The sandwich was not bad. The bread was rough to swallow. Dessert was obviously not freshly made and tasted like it was in the fridge/freezer for long enough to absorb the flavors of other foods. Customer service was okay. All in all, would recommend.",,,
3,Alicia C.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,281,840,4.0,6/24/2018,Cute bartender but weak drinks. Came here for happy hour. Got a sangria but I tasted like grape juice lol,1,,
4,Janelle T.,"New York, NY",1,10,22,4.0,5/3/2018,"This place was a nice surprise. My friend and I stumbled across this place one afternoon, like 3 or 4. No wait time, seated immediately. It was Tuesday, so they had deals every day of the week like most bars/gastropubs. That day was half-priced appetizers. I am no stickler for cauliflower, however I was getting over a cold and I wanted to make a semi-health conscious decision. So we had Cauliflower Duos (one side was buffalo and the other barbecue). When it arrived, I had to do a double take, IT LOOKED JUST LIKE WINGS. And the taste was heavenly. 10/10 for the apps alone.I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and my friend got the Cowboy Burger, keeping to duo theme alive. The sandwich was not bad. It was edible. It just felt like the Buffalo was too tangy without a nice soft sweet finish to contrast. The bread was rough to swallow. The menu said potato bun, the bun was rustic for sure. Customer service was okay, they had a party to cater to so I didn't mind the late check ins. All in all, would recommend. I would definitely visit back and try other items on the menu.",2,1,1

6,Jesse W.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",21,22,12,4.0,9/2/2018,"Sat at the bar. The barman was very thoughtful and attentive. Good drinks menu. There were a few people at the bar and another table of four. I had the ""Proper"" burger and it was delicious. Guinness was awesome. Also they have few big  TV screens. Probably a good place to take a group if some want to watch sports.",,,
7,Joseph S.,"Chicago, IL",172,182,235,5.0,10/30/2017,A very nice sports bar in tribeca.They have multiple giant TVs playing all kind of sports.You'll see lots of finance people getting their hapoy hour drink.The food is delicious. Especially the Proper burger. The beef was amazing.The southwest chicken salad was also tastyThe staff was very friendly and helpful.I would recommend that place if you're in lower Manhattan,,,
8,Laura M.,"Queens, NY",156,70,140,4.0,5/2/2018,"Went in around 1pm for lunch with my boyfriend and it was pretty empty, only two other tables were taken. Got a burger and it was pretty good, 7/10. Fries were really good. Staff was very friendly. Close to work so probably would come back.",,,
9,Olaedo E.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",20,74,59,5.0,7/13/2018,"I came here for happy hour on a Thursday around 5:30. The place is dimly lit and definitely a good place if you want to have an intimate date. Our beautiful waitress was so nice and informative. She took care of us and let us know all about the happy hour deals going on. We tried the truffle fries (hugeeeee portion..definitely enough for 3-4 people), the barbeque chicken flatbread pizza, and the chicken sandwich. I didn't have any of the chicken sandwich, but the bbq flatbread pizza was perfect and it had avocado on top, which makes everything taste 10x better. They also played the entire Drake album while I was there, which was even more amazing! The vibes are awesome, the food is bomb and the service is exceptional. I will definitely be coming back here!",1,,2
10,Mia K.,"New York, NY",572,381,1805,3.0,1/5/2018,"I can fairly review Manhattan Proper given that I have now patronized them both in casual drinks and for lunch. Overall I think I will pass on this establishment going forward. The drinks were decently crafted I enjoyed a Rum Runner that was fruity yet mild on the alcohol. My burger looked great but was just about meh.. The beef burger was a little tough and didn't not have much flavor. The buffalo wings, fries and salads are decent.The staff is not customer friendly but rather curt and not accommodating to guest. My party of 4 was turned down to sit at a 6 top table with more room because it was meant for ""6 people"" there was no wait of guest in sight, there were only 4 tables occupied with guest. On another occasion while here for drinks we were told ""don't pass this area"" in a mostly standing room only bar area. I was also granted complimentary drinks for myself and 10 friends but was contacted to cancel because of a booked party, that's no problem but they never gave me alternative dates. There are many restaurant/bars in the area so management make the establishment more welcoming and feel less restrictive.",15,5,10
11,Jogin J.,"Niles, IL",262,10,1,3.0,11/12/2018,Came here for a quick bite and bottomless brunch. Solid bar food . Nothing to spectacular. Did wish the services was a little better.,,,
12,Sung K.,"New York, NY",242,520,0,4.0,3/22/2018,"Came here for my birthday party this year, and am thinking of coming back to host another party.Tribeca doesn't necessarily draw the night crowd due to its location, and that can be a good thing for those who are with a big group. The manager and the bartenders took real good care of us and showed everybody a good time. Will certainly be back!",,,
13,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,4.0,1/29/2018,"Perfect spot for happy hour in FiDi. They can accommodate large groups and set up drink specials for occasions. If you come here on a Thursday night after 5pm, it will be packed. If you are coming here for a large party, try to plan in advance so you can have a section to yourself.The apps here are great, but I have yet to try the burger (which I heard is a real treat). I'll update once I try it!",1,,
14,Kristia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",228,591,145,5.0,1/26/2018,"I rarely frequent sports bars, but had to meet a colleague for a quick lunch meeting. I loved that they were open for lunch and that I could select my own seating. The staff was very cordial and attentive. I loved the clarity of the menu, which provided perspective on the size of each dish (ex. small bites vs shared) I ordered the Proper wings ($12) smothered in sweet chili sauce and they were delicious. Great ambiance! Given its elegance, I did not feel as though I was crossing into the male domain. I definitely love the name too, Manhattan Proper just sounds upscale, without expensive menu items. Since it's so close to work, if I'm ever in the city, I know where to stop in and grab a quick bite solo or with friends.",,,1
15,Keilon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,312,1877,4.0,11/12/2017,"Solid bar in FiDi.  I have not one complaint about this place.  It's not tiny, it's intimate but carries a nice atmosphere. The draft selection isn't expansive but it hits all the high points.  They have a proper happy hour with actual happy hour prices on things that you actually want to drink.  Even after happy hour is done, there's sometimes $5 draft specials on beers. I'm a Goose Island fan and I missed happy hour on my last visit and it just so happened to be $5...I guess the beer gods just love me?!  Check this place out after work, and bring (just) your favorite coworkers (as space is limited) and enjoy a few rounds.  Chill bartenders and friendly staff.",3,,2
16,Mark M.,"New Providence, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,7/13/2018,Made a quick decision with friend to give MP a try - and glad we did!Friendly with good service and the food was very good. We shared a few small plates like truffle Cesar salad and loaded sweet potato-fries and the shrimp bruschetta and all were delicious. Great to have a solid new place close!,,,
17,Joseph C.,"Staten Island, NY",22,7,0,5.0,9/27/2018,"Oh my God! This place is perfect. Upscale sports bar, elegant decor with comfort food. Burgers are incredible, truffle fries as good as Cut for half the price. Went for happy hour and you can't beat the drinks and food. I would give 6 Stars if I could.",,,
18,Rant E.,"New York, NY",17,52,96,3.0,3/27/2018,"The food was just okay, nothing to write home about.  Had a burger which was dry, some truffle fries which were pretty good, and a shrimp appetizer wasn't tasty.  The drinks were equally disappointing. I started with a Manhattan which wasn't great, so I shifted to an old fashioned--one of the worst I've ever had.  The friend I was with sent the sangria back it was so bad and got the house red instead, which was pretty good.  Staff wasn't very attentive.",2,,2
19,Tiffany T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,71,11,4.0,5/21/2018,Burger was quite solid and the seasoned fries were delicious! Ended up getting a pulsd deal for bottomless so all around good time! Our waitress refilled our mimosas quite frequently.,,,1
20,Lupe S.,"Richmond, VA",71,12,13,5.0,4/7/2018,First time to New York and I felt like I needed a burger. Pretty lively happy hour crowd but I was able to snap a seat at the bar. I usually don't get to note this but the bartender and staff were so neat and organized. I'm not sure if that's a New York thing but I was nevertheless refreshing. The service was prompt and helpful. The food came out quickly. It was hot and delicious. Great spot of grab a meal solo or to grad drinks with friends.,1,,
21,Charles K.,"Brooklyn, NY",226,348,513,4.0,10/23/2017,"Manhattan is a great spot to grab a bite or some after work drinks. Its located steps from city hall so they get quite a bit a business from city employees. The happy hour specials are affordable and the food is better than average for sure. The burger and truffle fries and solid. They have a longish bar than can seat about 12 along with some larger tables in the back. I usually visit for lunch meetings and happy hours. The staff isnt very diverse but they are all really nice. They play top 40 music but its one of those places that you dont really notice whats playing. My protip would be to leave your business card in the raffle pot. If you do you have the opportunity to win a 1 hour open bar (house wines, mixed drinks, and drafts) on the house for up to 15 people. I have been to 3 or 4 of them and even won one myself. Just remember to tip!",,,
22,Naomi Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,293,331,4.0,9/19/2017,"Never a bad time at this place. While you can't expect the royal treatment (hello, this is a BAR in lower manhattan), you can expect decent service, fair prices and a solid menu variety. Located a few blocks from the city hall stop, M.P. has the unique ability to be located in both Fidi and TriBeCa. *~TaLeNt~*. The food is decent and comes out quickly...but not so quickly that you're wondering if your burger trained for a marathon. The staff is friendly whenever I'm there and the prices are in line with the rest of the area.",,,
23,Greg J.,"Bronx, NY",272,55,463,4.0,9/6/2017,"I've been to both Proper West and Manhattan Proper, thanks to a deal they were running at the time. I like both locations. The interior design of this sport bar/restaurant/lounge is amazing. Narrow outside the seated restaurant area, but amazing. You can feel as if you went to the right place for happy hour regardless of if you're wearing a tie or henley. The drinks are slightly different, but I enjoyed them either way. I'd definitely recommend trying one of their signature cocktails when you're down there.",,,
24,Jordan D.,"Cranston, RI",16,28,0,5.0,7/14/2018,Such a good happy hour or late night spot. Amazing bartenders and staff that create a fun atmosphere and give you outstanding service. Especially Mauricio and Jen!,,,
25,Stephen K.,"Chicago, IL",267,35,1,4.0,3/24/2018,"I went here with a couple of coworkers on a Tuesday night. The food was outstanding. I had whatever their house burger was - and our group shared the Mac and Cheese - highly recommend! The place was setup with large speakers, so I could imagine that it gets pretty lit on the weekend. I tried to go back here the night of a Nor'easter earlier in 2018 and they were all locked up ""because of the weather"". The snow wasn't that bad and I was super disappointed - given the loss of a star. But I'll certainly be back.",,,
26,Alina U.,"Staten Island, NY",49,42,0,3.0,5/24/2018,"Nice place. Been there a few times. Some servers are nice, but some make not to nice comments to the customers. Commenting on their age. I think that's rude. Also, drinks depend on bartenders. Some water down the drinks, other make them great. I guess you just need to choose your best pal and visit this place on the nights they work. Food was ok, good for the bar. The only complaint is a customer service.",2,,
27,Bea L.,"Crown Heights, NY",0,314,0,3.0,9/7/2018,"Everytime I go after work this place is practically empty, which would make me a little nervous to order food, except that it's a great deal for happy hour and tastes good for bar food. I always have a nice time with coworkers or friends, but the emptiness is strange sometimes. I would never show up alone as a woman.",,,
28,Tony C.,"New York, NY",122,14,1,5.0,2/18/2018,"I believe this is one of the classier sports bars nearby the FiDi area. The tables and bars seem clean and new, and their glassware is very presentable. Took a lady here on Valentine's Day and she liked the place, and that's saying something because she is well traveled. Drinks are a little pricey ($13+) but I think that's normal for this area and they were strong. They missed my drink order,  but it's fine since both were whiskey drinks. We split the truffle garlic fries and a bbq chicken flatbread, and that was enough for two people. I'll be back to spend more money in the future",,,

Updated review",Great atmosphere. Happy Hour $5 Beers and 1/2 price appetizers. Had a Prosper Burger... it was cooked perfectly( asked for Mid-rare)...and the fries were hot and fresh!!! Will visit again next time we are in town!!,,,
30,Florinda G.,"Hialeah, FL",42,98,432,4.0,10/16/2016,"We stopped here for lunch after crossing the Brooklyn bridge and man, were we impressed! We started off with a few Stella's which were delicious, as usual. Next, we ordered some ""Nachos Locos""- crispy tortilla chips topped with beef, melted cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, and guacamole. Not the best nachos I've EVER had but they were absolutely delicious; I'd order them again. For our entrees we ordered the Proper Burger, Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and Truffle Burger. - Proper Burger: Delicious patty, thick and smoky bacon, and fresh toppings. No complaints at all.- Buffalo Chicken Wrap: This is what I ordered and to be honest, I was disappointed. I got this because I love buffalo chicken and blue cheese, this lacked in both areas. The buffalo chicken was super dry (seemed as if they over fried it??) and I couldn't even taste any of the blue cheese! If it wasn't for the delicious French fries, I would've considered this a total failure. - Truffle Burger: My brother said it was ""good"" but he couldn't stop raving about his truffle fries-- I tried a few and HOLY CRAP! Best truffle fries I've ever had, hands down.",,,
31,Frank P.,"Bethel, CT",5,62,10,5.0,5/16/2018,I came here with a friend and let me tell you I had the proper burger with fries and it was fantastic!!

33,Maggie N.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,19,0,1.0,1/24/2018,"ZERO STAR IF POSSIBLE I ordered and reserved tables or section of the bar for 11 PEOPLE and MORE for my birthday.  Someone I spoke to a day before said that she will give me the high tops as well as I have to put down my credit card to reserve which is normal.  However, I was disappointed when I see what was reserved.  THEY GAVE MY GROUP A TINY, TALL TABLE TUGGED IN A SMALL CRACK between MALE AND FEMALE BATHROOMS WITH NO CHAIRS .  When I asked the waitress about possibly moving they said they are waiting for manager and will get back to me. But NO ONE did.  I was the JOKE of the night because I chose this place. I have been in Manhattan Proper many times but not as a party.  I always recommend people from work to come here for drinks or to do Company Holiday Party.  NEVER AGAIN.",3,2,1

35,Rachelle V.,"Rahway, NJ",56,56,14,4.0,2/19/2018,"I meet up here about once a month for happy hour with a friend. Happy hour drinks are decently priced for the area. The wings, salmon burger, sweet potato fries, mac & cheese and salads are delicious. Service is ok, some days more attentive than others, but it gets busy so that's totally understandable. The place has tvs and music on generally, so it's not really an intimate ambience; oddly, it looks intimate but has a sports bar vibe. In any case, its a good spot for drinks and a chill meal, so I'll be back!",1,,
36,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,4.0,1/12/2016,"AMAZING BURGERS! As a bar in Tribeca, this place may be extremely empty during weekdays or Sunday nights but it is definitely not due to its lack of delicious offerings. I have been here twice now for food and have enjoyed it thoroughly. First, I will just like to give a quick shout-out to their pineapple infused vodka: Sweet and tangy. I could barely taste the vodka and it went down like juice. Deadly but delicious! Now for the food: I have gotten their burgers twice now. The Manhattan Proper Burger and the Turkey Burger which I substituted with beef because I was craving red meat. My boyfriend got the salmon burger.  My comments applies to all three: AMAZING! First their bread holds all the contents of the burgers perfectly. It looked to be multi-grain. It was dense and strong but light to the bite. Great with the burgers. The meat itself was plentiful and super moist. Both the salmon and beef came in large patties. I was definitely getting my moneys worth. The additions to the burgers tasted super fresh and just complemented everything perfectly. The red pepper aioli is spot-on. Their side salad was also largely portioned. A great mix of lettuce with tomatoes and a light tangy dressing. I also got their fries which were super crispy.   On top of that, the service is super nice. We've only sat at the bar to get the full view of their TVs but the experience has been wonderful.",5,,3

We will be going back again!!Thank you!!,,,

39,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1672,521,984,2.0,7/18/2017,"Maybe it was a rather hot day and their AC broke. Maybe it's the inattentive bartender who made OK manhattans. Maybe it was the company.

40,Caitlin B.,"New York, NY",3,266,19,5.0,1/18/2018,"Went here on a Wednesday night around 8:00 with a friend. When we first arrived the bar area itself was full and a few tables were occupied. However, a group was paying at the bar so we decided to sit there, and so glad we did... bartender Steve was great! Super friendly and attentive. We were going to get something to eat and he recommended the bbq chicken flatbread (comes with bacon and avocado & other toppings) so we shared that and it was delish!",,,
41,Zakir M.,"Paterson, NJ",4,20,7,2.0,11/19/2017,"Pretty decent ambience. Good luck ordering, they were out of everything, on a Sunday! Smh. They only had one person on also (bartending, serving & running). So much potential.... gone to waste!",1,1,
42,Missy H.,"Clearwater, FL",603,82,848,3.0,8/20/2016,"I came here once on a visit to NYC in the summer. We had just visited ground zero and I used Yelp to find somewhere to stop on the way to dinner. First entering the bar it looks very sophisticated and pretty. However, it was almost empty. Only customers seemed to be friends of the bartender. Considering it was 630 on a Saturday, not a good sign, The bartender was sort of awkward. He was chatting and looked surprised to have customers. The greeting was wierd and not too friendly. They were out of some ingredients for the cocktails for the cocktail list, but eventually I got a decent drink.We decided to get something small to eat. We got the truffle fries and they were great. Plenty of truffle oil.I think maybe it's more of a late-night bar. The music was confusing, sounded  more like a club.I would not go out of my way to come back here.",4,,1
43,Stephanie F.,"NJ, NJ",172,14,0,1.0,1/19/2018,"Please do not waste your time. The drinks were not mixed well and it was honestly a waste of time and money.

45,Kris G.,"New York, NY",1,3,0,2.0,11/12/2017,"This place had the potential to be one of the best places I've been to but what made it short of spectacular was the rude bar manager who abused his power and refused to serve me because of a mistake. Let me explain. In a crowed, loud bar, it's sometimes unclear who the bartender, bar back and bar manager is. When the bar manager told my friend he wasn't serving us at the moment originally, my assumption is that he was the bar back. I explained that to my friend and the bar manager heard me and took it as disrespect for his already lackluster title. He refused to speak to and serve me which is a bad practice since I was neither drunk nor unruly. He even took it as racial prejudice even though I myself am Hispanic and he said ""no hablas ingles"" when I asked him to serve me. I will be going back despite this. As a manager myself, his actions show me why he manages few instead of many. Maybe instead of refusing service and flirting with his team, he should receive some professional development.",1,,
46,Katie V.,"Buffalo, NY",101,110,173,4.0,6/20/2016,"I came here for the first time a few weeks ago to watch a basketball game with my boyfriend and his friend. Immediately upon entering, I noticed that this is a nice establishment. The interior is stylish and comfortable. The layout of the tables is such that regardless of where you sit to eat, you will have a reasonable amount of space from the table(s) next to you. There were plenty of televisions available to watch the game on, and the staff was accommodating of our wishes to have it displayed on a certain screen (of course, we would have been understanding if someone else had claimed dibs).The buffalo chicken sandwich is great, the fries appear to be cut in-house, and the price and portion of the food is very fair. The price of the drinks is also fair.I filled out a comment card during my first visit and, unbeknownst to me, I was entered into a drawing for a $250 bar tab - and I won! So, of course, I returned. I brought a few friends.The service here is incredibly friendly and prompt. My most recent visit was on a busy Friday night, and the quality of service did not diminish.It seems to get pretty busy in here, especially in the bar area, but the crowd waxed and waned during both of my visits, so finding a seat was eventually possible. This is a small establishment with limited bar seating, so I will be more likely to get table service on my next visit. My only reason for 4 stars is that I feel like they could fit a little more seating in the bar area if they wanted to.",3,1,4
47,Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",70,499,547,4.0,6/30/2015,"Quite nice!I met up with an old friend from HS whom I haven't seen in years. I suggested lunch and he works near city hall... So I relied on his judgment for restaurant selection. Our lunch at 11:30 was tasty. I had the salmon burger and my water glass never went empty. The salmon burger came with a side salad and either I was ridiculously hungry after a morning of walking from midtown to city hall or it was extremely well done. Strangely enough there were no other customers there while we dined. A little strange for NYC in my opinion but I is a Tuesday at the end of the month and maybe people have deadlines? The small space is well used, and the feel is nice. Wait staff were pleasant and not in your face. I'd come back or recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a good bite to eat!",,7,

We had the sliders (very good, juicy and flavorful) and a buffalo chicken flatbread (which had a kick!). The food was great, but service was a little slow owing to only having one person working the bar and waiting tables. All in all, we had a genuinely pleasant experience and will likely be back.",,,

This small but charming Tribeca bar can get real cramped and crowded (in fact it was when I visited twice) but is a good place to get together and chill with friends or colleagues.The  bar area is long and narrow but there are tables in the back of the restaurant for dining. We were a fairly large group tonight and ordered a few typical bar food items. The prices for both food and drinks were reasonable. We ordered the usual bar appetizers served at many other establishments. This included: buffalo wings, truffle fries, nachos with cheese/ground meat, sliders and mac and cheese. All but the mac and cheese (it was just meh) were a cut above the rest you've most likely eaten elsewhere.Two thumbs up for some bad for you food that tasted real good!",,,

This place is pretty much an upscale sports bar, which is great if you're looking for a relaxed yet polished place to have a drink or watch a game. I was satisfied with the drinks, which were decently strong for an open bar. They have a pineapple infused vodka that I thought was tasty. I was also pleasantly surprised with the food which was above average compared to other typical American bars. Some of the standouts were the grilled chicken skewers (I must have eaten at least 15 of these on the low honestly), cheeseburger sliders (super juicy and rivaled some of the more established burger places in the city), mushroom sandwiches, truffled Mac and cheese, penne a la Vodka and blackened salmon. The only real miss of the night was the steak which was cooked far too well done for my taste. Overall it was a good night and a nice place to ring in the new year. I'd come back if I was in the area to have a beer.",4,,1
57,Colleen Y.,"Manhattan, NY",382,196,230,5.0,12/6/2016,Multi-level sports bar a block south of Bryant Park.. came here for a few happy hours. Here are some of my observations.This bar is long and narrow on the ground floor but they have more open space upstairs and in the backThis bar is a Penn State bar?.. They play game sound for important penn state gamesThis bar is good for groups and watching gamesThis bar is loud... I wouldn't come here for a romantic 1st or 2nd date. This bar has great old fashions ... I blacked out after 2.5... I actually shattered my screen that night :(,3,,1
58,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,352,290,2.0,1/29/2017,"The Manhattan Proper burger was not good.  It was just way too bland.  There was no cheese.  Like if it hadn't come with the pickle I don't think I could have gotten it down bland.  It was also super greasy.  Really disappointed that they couldn't get the burger right.  I think I much prefer even Shake Shack over their burger.The fries were nice and crispy.  Other places I have had better burgers but their fries are lacking whereas here the burger is not good but they get the fries right.I haven't quite given up on this place as I will reserve judgment after I have tried their salads, but the burger was really disappointing (as in, it was one of those most disappointing burgers I have ever eaten).  I actually had to have tea after just to detox and I *never* drink hot tea after a burger.",,,1

Bartenders are super friendly and attentive (Jason was awesome!), flat screen tvs are huge and plentiful ... And the food!!! Lemme tell you about the food ...This sports bar has very satisfying bar food but it's notable because it's a step above most bar food I've ever had. Think gooey grilled cheese with avocado and tomato dipping soup ... Truffle Parmesan French fries (thrice fried), lots of burger options. You MUST try the pickle and Jameson shot (try before you judge) and the most amazing Greg goose infused pineapple (for all you low calorie drinkers!!) -- only need some ice and you are set!!

I was greeted by Ariana the bartender and she was really nice and pleasant. Super friendly and social. She made the experience enjoyable. I ordered the honey bbq wings and the truffle fries; both were delicious and a good choice. The prices were reasonable and its a good place for some good food and a variety of cocktails.

They offer a check-in special on Yelp, free draft beer or house wine with the purchase of food (including appetizers).  Too bad I didn't check-in until after I ordered that Gummy Bear Martini.  I was too full from the food and martini (and our earlier wine tastings) to order that free drink.  If I'm back in the area I'd stop in for those Parmesan Truffle Fries and my free drink.",2,,

71,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",445,352,1499,3.0,6/21/2015,"This place was alright - a solid choice for post-work drinks or a spot to go when there's a game on. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Among four people, we split the calamari, truffle Mac and cheese and the brooklyn beignets (filled with mozzarella and pepperoni). The calamari was a little too crispy for my taste, but there was a fair amount to portion size. The Mac and cheese had a strong smell of truffle, definitely a plus! A little too al dente for me, and I wish that it was a bit cheesier.  I didn't try the beignets, but they looked perfect. The ambiance was relaxing, and had higher end finishes conspired to the usual sports bar. They have several televisions around, and the music isn't too loud. Our server was friendly and checked up on us several times throughout our meal (though I was a little turned off when she asked if we had shown our IDs to the bouncer - do we look that young?) Cons?

Got a table in the middle with view of multiple TVs. Their screens are large and great quantity. Decent beer selection with the house ale on tap being very good. Megan and the other staff were courteous and kept checking in on us. We ordered burgers and foods, all very good and above average bar food. They do play music during the games so if you want to hear the commentators you are out of luck. (Although late this night around 11pm, they turned off the music) All and all a positive experience for game watching, drinks and food if you are in this part of town.

After we were seated, the waiter did not bring enough water for everyone and we had to ask for more. It was extremely humid and warm inside the restaurant and we asked the waiter if there was anything they could do with the AC. He explained that it was ""acting funny"" all day (again, this sucks but we understand things happen). After this, everything else was amazing. We order the loaded sweet potato fries- breathtaking! Great combination and I've never had anything like it. For the entree, I had the ginger spiced salmon burger- again, so delicious. So flavorful & I appreciate the originality of the ingredients.

Not only does the bar have a modern and classy décor...the food is quite swanky as well.  Food:I recommend the Shrimp Pasta. 1.

Due to a recent office location change I no longer was able to come to our hang out spot that often. So a couple months past and we decided to meet up here again for old times sake. WHAT A BAD IDEA! 1. They removed the nachos off the menu (What type of cruel human being does that?!)2. They add wings to the appetizer list which may sound like a good thing but they were salter than a cup of sea water!3. The Proper Burger (which I assumed was the main attraction of some sort) was burned! My coworker compared it to chewing on tar (not sure how she knew what tar taste like and I didn't bother to ask either).4.

I believe all apps are half off during HH, and drinks were also very cheap. $7 wines, $8 well drinks and $5 beers, I believe. I tried the watermelon jalapeño cocktail ($13, not included in HH) and it looked beautiful, but it was way too spicy to even enjoy. After that, I switched to wine which was great ($7 HH), and a nice pour. I also tried the sangria ($13? Not on HH) and that was very good and refreshing. My friends and I got the loaded nachos and truffle fries to pick on and both were amazing. The only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 stars is for the service. We had a group of friends and wanted to sit at a table (since there was no room at the bar) and we were told we had to be out by 6pm because a group was coming in for a party.

The fries were sooooo good, the Mac ::Homer drool::, shrimp really delish just not enough. Good happy hour specials and delicious food. Service was ok... Be sure to check in for a free drink!!!

105,Chandler A.,"New York, NY",316,43,18,3.0,11/15/2016,really good drink specials (free drink with purchase of appetizers on Sunday)! Also the calamari was super delicious. Just stumbled upon this place without previous knowledge so I highly recommend it!,,,
106,Brittney G.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,7,40,5.0,9/17/2016,Went last night with a friend. We got there about an hour before closing so people were leaving but we still had a BLAST.

107,Morgan P.,"Dallas, TX",5,19,0,5.0,4/10/2017,"This cute bar is about a block and a half from my office. I have only sat at the bar here, however, I absolutely love it everytime I go. I am usually there on Monday's and Wednesday's, when Victor (wonderful, funny, personable bartender who makes a MEAN bulleit rye old fashioned) is working the bar. The bartenders who accompany him are usually fun and upbeat as well. I am a big fan of the overall vibe of this place. I feel like I am walking into a neighborhood bar that is comfortable, along with nicely decorated. Not originally being from NYC, I found this difficult to accomplish elsewhere. I love places where I feel that if I were to ask if the bartender can make me something not listed, they would give it a try and not give an attitude, actually they would do the opposite and interact with you while they are attempting! Love it here and I highly recommend it for after work. (I have had the food, but only bar snacks, although not anything to write home about, I am never disappointed in the quality)",,,

109,Stephie L.,"New York, NY",48,63,5,3.0,8/11/2015,Was recently here on Saturday night with my boyfriend with high expectations on the menu and drinks. The drinks we're ok. Overpriced for the quality. We sat at a table. There were only 4 people at the bar and two bartenders. One of the bartenders was our server however her attention was paid directly to her friends sitting at the bar. We ordered drinks and we saw her make 4 drinks for her friends before she prepared ours. We sat 20 minutes waiting to order food and the manager had to come because the girl was too busy talking. Ordered honey BBQ wings which were fried so long it hurt to bite into. The burger was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the steak frites and the chimchurri sauce that came with it was more like a sweet pesto. Really not worth the $80 bill. If you come here make sure to stick to the bar.,,,

One of my colleagues won a $250 bar tab and a few other co-workers and I drank for free. Seems like one of those pyramid schemes that McFadden's or Irish Exit tries to pull, but I'll take the fratty banker/finance crowd over college kids who might actually still be active in their fraternities. A couple of my friends have guest bartended here, because that's a thing that happens, and they seemed to enjoy themselves doing so, thus it seems that the clientele can't be THAT bad. There are also a ton of large screen TV's everywhere, so it seems like a good place to catch some games if you're in the area.As for the food, we mostly got sandwiches and salads. Salads were huge, all sandwiches came with fries, and the prices are definitely better than most bar restaurants in the area. I mean, it's just typical bar food, but everything was executed without any problems, and the service was attentive. Probably won't be back for anything other than happy hours and lunch, but only a few high traffic bars in New York run smoothly and Manhattan Proper happens to be one of them. Sure, it's a little on the douchier side, but it's a quality bar with decent drinks and food. What more can you ask for?",,,

PERFECTION for the gentleman in the group. My complete party drizzled in and we had no drama (none of that ""we can't seat you without the full group"") .The food was yummy and reasonably priced. The specials on Sunday were $5 Mimosas/Bloody Mary's and beer buckets for $15.  The guys had beers and the gals...we ordered a bottle of champagne and made our own Mimosas. We probably ordered every appetizer on the menu... the standouts : truffle fries, chicken nachos, wings, and this shrimp cucumber/avocado dish.Service was attentive and friendly.  Our server visited us to make sure that we were satisfied with our meal, and replenished napkins beverages...

114,Christopher L.,"New York, NY",2,8,0,2.0,8/29/2015,"Went here for lunch to try it out as I had walked passed it many times. It was about 1:45pm so the lunch rush was pretty much over. I was with 3 other coworkers. 2 of us ordered the burger with ""seasoned"" fries, 1 ordered the Salmon Burger and the other ordered the turkey burger sliders. There were probably 4 other people there who were going to order lunch. Despite the relatively low number of patrons it took about 25 mins for our food to come out. I was surprised by how small the burger was and how bland the ""seasoned"" fries were. The burger was good, it was just so small. In defense (kinda) it was only $12 and came with fries which is cool for lower Manhattan. If I felt my burger was small then I can only imagine how my coworker who ordered the turkey burger sliders felt. They were tiny and obviously not filling. She order a side a fries hesitantly because she worried it would also take long. Her bill came up to $20 for the sliders ($12) and fries ($6-7?), pricey for maybe 6 ounces of meat and fries smh. I think I will give the place another shot, but probably for happy hour or to watch a game. They look like they have good happy hour specials, a solid selection of brews and nice amount of TVs. When I do go for HH/game I will update.",,,

The bar also has plenty of seating, and Manhattan Proper offers a killer deals if one of your friends ""wins"" the happy hour special - FREE beers (e.g., Bud, Shock Top) and well drinks for an hour.

Then last minute we decided to get some platters, which for a big group are usually preordered. The order was filled and brought out within minutes. Everyone had an incredible time. If I can only add one thing it is that the seating in the back can be a little awkward with the location of the kitchen doors.

132,Anna V.,"PECK SLIP, NY",305,220,317,3.0,6/20/2014,"Things happen, right? Especially things that happen during a busy lunch hour and during World Cup? Yes, things get busy, but how would you rate the fact that you waited 45 minutes for just 3 appetizer plates? Because that's what happened during a Friday lunch out that also happened to have a World Cup game on.If they knew the food wait was that long they should have said so in the beginning. If they knew that something went wrong with the order they should have just said so. Promising that your food will be right out every 5 minutes or so is pretty careless.Picture being told that the food is ready to be out. And picture sitting close enough to the kitchen that you notice every time the kitchen door opens and someone comes out. Alas that someone doesn't happen to be carrying any food with him/her or even worse the food is not meant for your table, or even worse the food is for the neighboring table which you're pretty sure was seated way after you and must have ordered after you.It took two trips to the waitress to remind her about our food. It's not even worth commenting on the food because after devouring everything since we waited so long it was pretty forgettable.Now, to give credit, the waitress halved our bill since we waited so long. So I added an extra star to an otherwise two star review just for that effort. I'll really have to clear my schedule, however, if I want to have lunch here again.",2,,

The space is decent (except the narrow front at peak times), the happy hour is great, and the food is solid. The drinks here are always reasonably priced, and the happy hour is the icing on the cake offering with wine and beer quickly and with a smile. The selection offered is reasonable, and there's enough beer and liquor options to make most people happy. The key here is really the TV screens. They have some of the largest flat panel screens I've ever seen, and they don't shy away from loading them up with every game available. I've never been in on a Sunday, but I can imagine it's perfect for watching.I recently got lunch here for the first time and was pleased. The food wasn't amazing, but given that this is an upscale sports bar, I wasn't expecting it to be. Most everyone got a variation of sandwich or burger and came away pleased. Surprisingly the best looking thing at the table may have been the salads, which were gigantic and looked to be filled with only the freshest ingredients. Given the area, MP is a welcome departure from the traditional Irish Pub and offers a sports bar experience that is welcoming and inviting to come back to.",5,,2

Actually the waitress/ bartender was more attentive to the manager sitting at the bar eating than us. The only person, who I left the tip with for only him to have ,was the food runner/ bus boy. As I sat there with the party going on behind me of staff member only literally 3 feet away I heard all about their lives very descriptive stories while they cursed and carried on. And the food well it was sub par which was predictable as the suppose ""chef""  was in her chef coat taking part in the party. However she did go back to scoop a scoop of gelato.... to bad it was freezer burned so bad my 3 yr old wouldn't even eat it.

We both ordered the southwest salad and they made sure to bring my wife the salad with grilled chicken. The salads were very tasty and had an intense jalapeno flavor which we loved.

We ended up not going to that place, and somehow stumbled upon Manhattan Proper. I wish I had checked what sports were going on that day before stepping into the bar, because this was the most rowdy restaurant I've ever been to. Now, I'm not saying it's a bad thing -- it's a sports bar. It better damn well be rowdy, especially when it's Michigan vs Michigan State college football. But I'm not a college football fan, so I wasn't prepared for the volume. We got inside, sat down at our table, and realized we couldn't hear each other from across the table. Yes, that's how loud it was We considered leaving, but we had already ordered our drinks and the menu looked promising, so we figured we'd stick around. We decided to just snack on a couple of appetizers to fill us up. We ordered the calamari, truffle fries, and hot wings. I was very satisfied with the calamari; it wasn't chewy, it was super crispy, and the taste was great. The truffle fries were good, but nothing special. The wings were probably my least favorite dish. The sauce smelled good and tasted good, but it was extremely thick. I had about two and very quickly got bothered by the sauce, so I stopped eating them. Our waitress was nice, but you could tell she was caught up in the sporting event, so she wasn't super attentive. All in all, the experience wasn't bad, but I don't think I'll go back there.",,,

156,Keith K.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,69,6,1.0,5/23/2013,"This is the kind of no-character downtown after-work bar that you go to with your colleagues to have a bunch of bud lights and coronas and vodka-sodas and see sports on TV while listening to nondescript dancey pop music over a bad PA system. You will be surround by bankers swaying cluelessly to indecipherable dance music. The selection of beers is poor, and beer-lovers will be disappointed.  That should be enough to inform you, but...For me the kiss of death was that we called early to ask if the audio would be on for the Rangers playoff game, and the manager told us yes, it would be on.  But when we got there, we were told that it couldn't be done, because there was a party from Goldman Sachs and they wanted music!  And when they left another party was coming in!  So, thanks, d-bag management for lying to us.  You were gonna get two stars, but you get only one.",4,2,1

Updated review","I can admit when I've passed judgement too quickly. By some twist of fate, my coworker ignored our terrible experience here a few months ago and decided to do a happy hour here.While everything about the crowd remains the same, I must admit that this place has some benefits. This time we only had drinks and appetizers. The appetizers are actually quite good, unlike the main fare we had last time. The calamari is very crispy and comes with a very good sauce, the sliders are spot on, the truffle fries are delicious.The beer list remains okay.The biggest difference this time was the service. Our server, whose name I did not catch, was incredibly attentive and quick despite the place being fairly busy. She made the entire difference. While this place still makes me feel uncomfortable overall, I have to say I could see it growing on me.",1,,1

161,Leah M.,"Coquitlam, Canada",1,17,0,3.0,9/21/2014,"Searched on Yelp for somewhere low-key within walking distance from our hotel & MP had the fewest bad reviews. So we decided to eat there. Sunday night around 7:30 & there was only 1 other table of 4. Bartender/server was very polite & we got our drinks quickly. White sangria packed a punch & while they were out of the IPA my SO wanted the suggested substitue seemed to do the job. Appy of the bruchetta - 6 pieces, 2 of each, with good quantity of toppings. The mushroom was our favorite, the carmelized onion good but the cream cheese was somewhat overpowering. We ordered the steak sandwich & clubhouse to share. Fries were average. Sandwiches were tasty, the steak could have used something to give it some punch like a horseradish mayo. Both had good amounts of fillings & ingredients tasted fresh. SO wanted dessert so he chose the Tollhouse pie. Sort of more like a pecan pie but with walnuts. Ihad a bite, seemed ok, but not my thing. I was eyeing the brownie with the cheesecake filling - the other table had that & it looked good. Overall, MP did the job & wasn't disappointing. Looking forward to some stellar meals however as our week in NY gets fully underway tomorrow.",,,

The bartenders actually ask questions before just pouring you some random crap. My drinks are gin & tonic and most places just pour you whatever house gin they have, but MP's bartenders actually ask what kind of Gin I want - definitely major points for that. And finally, around 11pm they push out the tables in the back and create a dance floor. Good bar, good music & a dance floor.. what else do you need?Oh and if you do need something else they have a bunch of TVs that you can watch whatever game is big on and yell to your hearts content. AWESOME!",9,3,5

Our food orders always get messed up, even when we ask for it to be fixed, they get it wrong. The food it just ok, nothing will knock your socks off. What adds insult to injury is that the servers have attitude, the service is slow and the bartenders are not attentive. With all the options available, I recommend you spend your money elsewhere.",,,

MP really made my birthday great, had a few tables set up for us and gave me free drinks for hosting the party there. They had a great dj, playing a great mix of music, and everyone had an awesome time. The food was not your average bar food, had a classy twist. My second go around here was a blast as well. Great crowd on Saturday, with a nice mix of all types of people, strong drinks, and nice staff. The dj once again played great music and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves a lot.",3,3,2
169,Andrew J.,"New York, NY",137,7,3,2.0,6/5/2014,Food was great. I had the Proper Burger. Meat was terrific. well prepared. Apps were on par for a typical sports bar. Truffle Parm fries were the best. HOWEVER the service was terrible. Atrocious.  Granted we were there during the ranger game with 7 people but the place was half empty by the time we ordered. Very long wait for every drink order and the food came out on plate at a time so we weren't able to all eat together without peoples food getting cold. We had to continually ask if the rest of our order was coming. One top of it the manger- or at least the gentleman who looked/ acted like the manger-  sat down with a couple females friends after we were seated and ate dinner with them. They got served immediately while we waited. Probably will not return other than drinks and a burger at the bar.,,,

Manhattan Proper is a lovely sports bar venue, nicer than your typical sports centric drinking spot. The bar is long and a bit narrow but then opens up to a table seating area in the back. Nice large tvs all around.Bar was well stocked and well tended. Bartenders did a great job with our thirsty crowd! I stuck to wine on my trip, but they also have some really delicious looking pineapple infused vodka that I will definitely have to check out sometime soon.",1,,2

The food is pretty good, the beer selection is fair, service is good, and the TVs are large. And that's about it.I might drop in for lunch again, or recommend it to watch a game for someone looking downtown, but it lacks the kind of character that makes me want to come back or recommend it to friends.That said, it's a solid bar and restaurant and it's worth a go.Weird side-note: the 700 Club was playing on two of the large TVs when I was in there for lunch the other day. The only thing I could conceive of as a reason to have it on is to encourage you to drink more. I'm still scratching my head.",,1,

I asked for a red bull vodka and he replied and said there's no more red bull when there was a fridge literally filled with them right behind him. That's his job to serve customers. Clearly the bartenders here know nothing about customer service. My other friends experienced the exact same thing. The bartenders even threw the drinks at them. This bar is the worst place ever with even worse bartenders.,1,1,

They had a sign outside that advertised that they have Stella and Hougaard beer. We were both excited about since that's our favorite beer but come to find out when we ordered it they didn't have the Hougaard beer but they did have the Stella. The menu looked very pleasing at least from our eyes. We did order the truffle French Fries and thought that was good. The problem with this was it took them 15+ minutes to Make. We had to remind the waitress about the fries and she responded with ""I'm sorry I put the order in but it didn't print in the kitchen""  - in other words, she most likely forgot to put it in and this place wasn't even packed!

It is her birthday, not mine.  I ordered Nachos and Peach ice tea. The nachos were decent but nothing to write home to mom about. The peach ice tea was meh, It lacked flavor. I definitely had better. We had to kinda call out for the waitress often, which sucked. A couple of us got our food after everyone else was done eating, which was not a warm fuzzy. But the cool thing was they did separate bills. I got my bill and it was $26.13. Not bad. I hand them my Verizon visa and they claimed it did not go through. So I hand them my other card. Boom! Success.Two days later, I look at my bank account and it was three different charges. One for $1, another for $24.83 and one for the actual amount. I look on my Verizon card, another charge for $24.83. However, that dropped off. Annoyed, I called my bank who then called them on conference. The manager (who didn't seem to care) told me it should drop off in 3-5 business days. They charge it to make sure there is money on there. But that explains the $1 charge, not the $24.83 charge. Then he catches an attitude, ""well it will drop off, it was probably an error."" Really? Okay. Thank God I am not flat broke and depended on that money, I would be S.O.L. People. if you go, bring cash or avoid altogether. Clearly, they lack professionalism. the food and drinks are not worth the aggravation.",2,,
