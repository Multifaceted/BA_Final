0,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,11/19/2018,"Shuka is the greatest Israeli/Mediterranean restaurant since 12 Chairs. And after a recent visit with a party of friends for brunch, I would contend that it complements, rather than competes with, the longer tenured restaurant just a few doors down. And while 12 Chairs has a strong Eastern European influence on the menu, Shuka's culinary DNA is squarely Mediterranean and Middle Eastern.Our brunch was a real knockout. The big surprise was the Beet Tzatziki appetizer. I grew up eating beets but rarely found beet-heavy dishes inspiring. This one was a hit, so much so we ordered seconds. The house labne  was also good.All the mains are tantalizing, inviting thoughts of family-style sharing. Tunisian Breakfast spoke to me that morning (lamb merguez sausage, fried eggs, muhamarra dip, cucumber, and oil), but I still had gluttinous thoughts of the spit-roasted shawarma, smoked shuka, and even chocolate babka French toast. So many reasons to return.Pro Tip: Shuka gets hella busy during peak brunch times, but group reservations are quick and easy on OpenTable.",1,,1
1,Bridget P.,"West Babylon, NY",90,84,128,4.0,11/17/2018,"Food was very good. We came here for a birthday dinner and started with the labna and falafel. I loved the labna but didn't love the spice on the falafel but that's just personal taste. Other members of the party thought it was great. We ordered four different kebabs to share: steak, chicken, shrimp and chicken sausage. The chicken and steak were clear favorites. Each came with pita bread and a salad. My only disappointment was that we told the hostess that it was a birthday party and she said she made a note and would put a candle in the dessert. Unfortunately that never happened.",,,

Updated review","Went to Shuka again but this time for dinner and it was even better! We really liked the fried halomi, beet tzatziki and the chicken kebabs (the chicken was cooked perfectly and super flavorful!) Sat in the back this time and the decor was super cute. Will be back soon!",3,2,3
3,Al L.,"Miami Beach, FL",324,361,1507,3.0,11/6/2018,"I came here after being recommended by a friend and I was a bit disappointed the food as it did not live up to my expectation. Here is the breakdown:Decor/ ambiance - plus Very unique and such a charming restaurant from a decor and a vibe standpoint. Very nice wall decoration details, the feel of the color choice of the walls and overall clean, light in a romantic setting but yet perfect for small group gathering. Definitely a fan. Food- did not live up for the expectation I was a bit disappointed with the food here. We were some appetizers to start with some spreads and cheese. It started well, I like it, I wasn't blown away. Then I went to order my lamb skewers and was a bit disappointed. It was average but definitely not worth the pricing. We debated ordering the chef's choice and leaving it to the restaurant and we decided not to go with it. But that option is available if you want to try a little bit of everything. Service - averageThe waiter was ok, not rude but also lacked that sense of urgency or attentiveness that we expected. Overall Too much hype but it did not live to what I expected",4,1,2
4,Scott O.,"Needham, MA",12,94,95,5.0,11/15/2018,"This is a great place! Unique items like the pistachio feta dip (you must order this), very reasonable price s for the city, and friendly staff. In fact in most NYC places I feel like they push you out as fast as you finish eating but I never got that feeling here. I got mixed plate with chicken and steak kabobs. The steak was much better but the chicken was good too.",,,
5,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",418,354,3232,4.0,9/27/2018,"The short: super cute Mediterranean spot with really delicious food, incredible service, and a warm ambience. The longer: I've now been here twice and have enjoyed my experiences and meals immensely. I came during lunch for a business meeting. We were given a corner booth area near the door. I had a French Chardonnay and my colleague had a cocktail- both were delicious. We shared the beet yogurt dip and fried halloumi (FAB), and I ordered the chicken kebab skewer as a lunch entree. My chicken was a smidge over cooked, but the side kale salad, all the apps, the drinks & the service made for a really great experience. I'd recommend definitely trying their dips and the fried halloumi! Worth noting: the tables are extremely close together, so it can get a little noisy or distracting if you're trying to have a productive business meeting.",3,2,3

7,Chris K.,"New York, NY",211,32,44,4.0,11/11/2018,"Friends and I wanted to grab Saturday brunch and decided to try Shuka for the first time. The atmosphere was definitely on point and we had excellent service. The food is okay, I wouldn't rave about it since it wasn't really that special.One of my friends ordered a Brunch Bowl and it was just a fancy salad, so no source of protein at all besides the eggs and nuts. But, the poached eggs I ordered was pretty good. It had pork belly as well, so it's a pretty heavy dish.",,,
8,Cri C.,"New York, NY",271,221,1526,4.0,10/5/2018,"I came here last night with a friend. I'm vegetarian, she eats everything but cheese and decided to go vegetarian for the evening.We ordered:* falafel* squash hummus with pita bread* olives* Yukon potatoes (sans feta)* fattoush salad (kept the haloumi in for me)She ordered a white wine and I got the Valletta cocktail. It is essentially a fancy gin & tonic with frozen concord grapes and rosemary. It comes so that you can mix it yourself and fabulously presented - the gin is in a fish shaped flask (mad points for Instagram potential).We really enjoyed all the dishes and the food went well together. If I had to choose a favorite dish it would probably be the fattoush salad (and I got to eat all the haloumi). It was very fresh and the dressing was great. Also loved the sauce that came with the potatoes, and that the falafels were crispy but still nice and moist on the inside. I like the squash hummus as well, probably bordering on a little sweet for me to eat all the time, but it complimented here.The vibe of the restaurant was great. It was dimly lit, completely bumping and felt very trendy. There was a front section with tables and a bar that looked out onto the street, a middle room (where we sat) and an enclosed back patio section. Really nice décor in keeping with the Mediterranean theme. I really enjoyed the music as well - they were playing a lot of Stevie Wonder, Lee Fields, Ray Charles and etc. My friend and I concluded it would probably be a tad loud for a first date considering the music volume, and that the seats were quite close together. But it would be a nice place for a later date, birthday, celebration or catch up with friends.I was also very happy with our server. He was friendly, attentive and sincere; available without being too pushy, able to accommodate dietary needs on the menu and generally looked pretty happy to be working there (which is also nice). On that note, so did all the other staff. At least five of them said goodbye to us when we were leaving.Tip - definitely make a reservation. They are booked out by the weekend (as I previously discovered) and even on a Thursday night it was totally packed until about 10:30pm.I'd happily come back anytime.",,,
9,Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",169,173,98,3.0,10/31/2018,"If you're going to name your restaurant after a dish, you better best deliver! The shakshuka here is super disappointing. Cute space and good vibes here, but that's about it. The only redeeming part of our brunch was the labneh dip and pita. Even the mint tea service I ordered was subpar. We ate at the bar and the bartenders were all friendly, but they didn't seem too knowledgeable about what they have stocked. My friend asked a question about one of their premium whiskeys and she replies, ""I'm not sure""... but didn't bother to find out the answer?! That was off-putting. When our shakshuka arrived, it was piping hot and looked delicious but tasted quite bland and extremely under seasoned. The bread that came with it was good at least.... I guess. Not sure where the disconnect or hype is about because I wouldn't even classify their version as mediocre.",,,
10,Abul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,293,148,3.0,9/15/2018,Beautiful space. Good service.But the food was lacking something. Can't exactly say what. Good but not there yet to great. And if you're charging these prices it should be amazing.,,,
11,Trisa T.,"New York, NY",199,402,586,4.0,8/30/2018,"I loved everything about Shuka -- the food, the ambiance, the decor! Came here for dinner on a weeknight on reservations we made same day. The restaurant itself is really cute and much larger than it looks. The front main area - which includes a combination of bar seating and regular tables - has doors that open up, which is so nice in the summer (when it's too hot and humid to go somewhere with outdoor seating, but you want to enjoy the summer air). There's also an entire section in the back that's decorated like a chic Mediterranian summer home. We tried the fava hummus, the falafel, and shared the chicken shawarma plate. I also tried the watermelon haifa. Our waitress said that we were a little light on food -- but it was more than enough for the two of us! We had a hard time finishing. Everything was so tasty and good!! 5-star food. The drinks were only OK, and not worth the price tag.Service was good but nothing spectacular; and we were asked to move to a shared table (which wasn't a big deal) after our hostess apparently sat us in the wrong section.Overall, delicious spot! Will definitely come back to try their brunch!",1,,2
12,Anna K.,"New York, NY",8,67,12,5.0,11/15/2018,What a nice find!  My friends and I came here for brunch on a Saturday - we made reservations but surprisingly it was not packed at 11-11:30am.  Things did start filling up by 12-12:30pm.The food was great - we shared a Feta Pistachio dip served with Pita - to be fair I didn't really enjoy it but my friends did.I had the Shakshuka and it was delicious.  I also ordered the Turkish cold brew which was a pleasant surprise - we ended all drinking it because it was a pretty big cup.Will come again!,,,
13,Doris L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,14,28,3.0,11/8/2018,"Shuka is where the old Hundred Acres used to be. To be honest, it doesn't seem like much has changed from the old restaurant. Still Mediterranean and serving food with nothing to ride home about. If you're looking for a cute brunch spot, then this place is not a bad choice. Pretty easy to get a last minute reservation as well, including for large parties. As for the food, we ordered the Chicken Schwarma and the Shakshuka. There was absolutely nothing standout about the Shakshuka (the one at Jack's Wife Freda is way better). It was almost bland. I thought the okra would make the dish interesting but I was wrong. The schwarma was decent, but I shouldn't be paying $17 for something I can get at a sidewalk cart, and of similar quality. I tasted a bite of the Chocolate Babka French Toast. It was too sweet! Everything was disappointing - the drinks too. Not to mention our waiter seemed to be rushing us the entire time. Needless to say, Shuka was very underwhelming to me.",,,
14,Marley M.,"New York, NY",401,134,279,4.0,8/11/2018,"This place is very cozy, the staff was warm and the food was well prepared. We ordered the Dates, Olives, and Hummus as appetizers and it was DELICIOUS. I only wish the hummus was served in a greater portion and I wish the chickpeas were mashed a bit more. It was more of a half hummus half chick pea dish and I wish it was at least 75% hummus and 25% chick peas. Other than that, it was very tasty! The dates were to die for. We almost ordered a second order before our entrees came.I only give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't really love our main courses as much. I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad and it had too many flavors that didn't pair together well; I was overwhelmed with the all of the different flavors at once (see photo). I had my partner taste it and he said it ""wasn't bad"" but to him that just means it's edible. He ordered the Golden Mediterranean Paella. It wasn't bad, it was just okay to me. I wish I had ordered a kebab instead but we are both attempting to cut meat out of our diets. For dessert, we asked for the olive oil cake. I don't remember seeing it on the menu but I say the pretty pictures of it on Yelp lol. It wasn't bad either but it wasn't great. I wish they put a bit more of the citrus drizzle on it. Overall, the Dates were fantastic enough to make me want to go back, even if just for the dates and Hummus. I would definitely come back here and try more things on the menu. The food was definitely made with TLC and the atmosphere is very cozy.Last but not least, the staff here is very warm! Coming here will be an overall positive experience.",6,3,4
15,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,4.0,8/14/2018,"To start, the ambiance and service is lovely. I love the decor inside and the lights are beautiful. Red pepper walnut dip: delicious! It has a great smoky flavor and is a ""heavier"" dip. Whipped feta pistachio dip: this is a much lighter dip than the red pepper. I loved it, potentially more than the red pepper dip. Vegetable paella: I felt like the rice was burnt- a lot of it was blackened at the bottom. The portion was a bit small for the price. The flavor did remind me of Spain and I wished they added some type of protein. Zucchini and squash blossom app: major skip! The batter was very dense and heavy, so you didn't get the lovely lightness I often love in squash blossoms. The dip, or whatever the white concoction is underneath, is sublime!",1,1,1
16,Kelly Z.,"Queens, NY",534,186,367,5.0,8/29/2018,"Spectacular experience at Shuka! My boyfriend and I decided to make a reservation for 7:15pm for our two year anniversary dinner. Thankful that we did because it was nearly a full house on a Monday evening. Our server, Nabia, was nothing but GREAT! She asked if we had any questions about the menu and we asked about what items will be included in the Shuka feast. She pointed out some of the items that she has been seeing come for the feast. When the mezze, dips and kebabs came, Nabia explained each item and what it is made out of.Mezze:-Fried Halloumi: definitely recommend on ordering this if you like fried cheese. It tastes like mozzarella.-Crispy Chickpeas: crunchy and not too salty.-Olives: not to salty, we enjoyed it. -Falafel: one of my favorite vegetarian items ever, served with tahini.-Marinated Cucumber with lemon dressing & Market Vegetables: refreshing balance. Dips:-Whipped Feta & Pistachio: I picked this restaurant so I can try this! Not bad, very creamy and cheesy.-Beet Tzatziki: I don't usually eat beets but this was the winner! -Roasted Eggplant: similar to babaghanouge but no tahini. This was also amazing!Kebabs:-SCALLOPS: please do yourself a favor and order this! They were fresh and marinated just right! It had a slight char, this is what you want! -Pork Kofta: a bit salty, but will go great with pita!-Hawaij Chicken: tender and juicy! Goes great with spiced yogurt and the green sauce they give you.Dessert:-Panna Cotta with Blueberry preserves: this was SO GOOD! It was creamy and not too sweet, just the way we like our desserts.Overall, our experience at Shuka was amazing and would look to come back with friends and indulge in their feast again. Nabia was attentive and always checking on us; one of the best servers we ever had. Jonathan, the host was great too! He offered to put the bouquet of flowers, my boyfriend got me, in water while we had dinner. All in all, I will definitely be back and hopefully Nabia will still be there! (She's a keeper!)",,,
17,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",12,229,363,5.0,8/5/2018,"I came in here for brunch this morning and had the most amazing time.  To begin with, the space isa absolutely adorable.  Plenty of natural lighting, fun tiling and designs around the restaurant, and chic decor and pillows at the tables.  The service is also very quick and friendly here too.We started off with the beet tzatziki.  While you don't really taste any beet flavor, the beautiful pink color really shines through.  This is a thick yogurt dip that they serve with either cucumber or pita.  Super tasty & you get a very large portion so it's great to share with the table while waiting on your entrees.  For entrees we ordered the shakshuka and the Mediterranean plate.  The Shakshuka was a hearty bowl of tomato sauce and a couple eggs smothered in a generous amount of cheese.  It came with a thick slice of toast that had a little bit of olive oil on the bread.  This meal would be great on a cold winter day!The Mediterranean plate was the standout by far.  On the plate you get four falafel on a base of tahini, cucumbers, a turmeric poached egg, a few pickled vegetables, za'atar-spiced labneh, and a pita. Wow, I can't say enough about this beautifully composed plate.  The falafel were perfectly crispy and salty, and weren't super oily like some falafels can be.  The pickled vegetables paired perfectly with the turmeric egg, and the cucumbers provided a fresh crunch to the dip.  The absolute standout of the plate though was the labneh.  This ultra-thick yogurt/ cheese was heavenly.  It tasted like Greek yogurt and sour cream, and was very thick but still had a light, whipped feeling to it.  They also give you plenty of this spread so you have enough to put on all of your pita and dip your falafel in it.  All in all, this was a fabulous brunch, and I'd come back here in a heartbeat.  The Mediterranean plate is a must-order.A+ for aesthetics and food as this adorable little Soho joint.",2,,2
18,Sinan Z.,"New York, NY",303,78,239,2.0,8/25/2018,"Had lunch here and the seating is very crammed with no leg space.We shared the beet spread which was really good, but I got the lamb kebab plate as my entree, and the lamb was very difficult to chew.",,,
19,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",273,84,162,4.0,8/14/2018,"Came here for brunch. We got chicken shawarma and shashuka. The chicken shawarma is sooo good! It is crispy outside yet juicy inside. The shashuka, however, is mundane. It is a bit too salty, and it has only one tiny piece of bread in accompany. All food here are in pretty large portion though, as both my boyfriend and I were full when we finished our own entrees, which is great considering how tiny the portions can be in some manhattan restaurants.The service here is also pretty friendly. I will come back some time soon for dinner.",,,

Great for groups (the room at the back is so cute)!We ordered the Shakshuka, Tunisian Breakfast, Poached Eggs, and Brunch Bowl. All of the dishes were super flavorful, and the staff was happy to accommodate any modifications requested. What really stood out during our experience was how attentive and caring the service here was. Despite being late to our reservation on a busy Sunday afternoon, they made sure we were seated right away. Overall, we had a wonderful experience here and I'm already looking forward to coming back. Can't wait to try the Chocolate Babka French Toast next!",1,,
21,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",413,305,542,4.0,7/2/2018,"Beautiful space set in the old Hundred Acres restaurant. Shuka is from the same folks behind the ever popular Cookshop and Vic's, but with a Mediterranean bent. My boyfriend and I got seats at the bar easily on a Saturday afternoon, but the restaurant was buzzing through our entire time there.We ordered the kale salad and shakshuka to share. I loved the salad - the copious amounts of cheese and sunflower seeds added another dimension to what could've been a very boring pile of kale. The shakshuka was very well done, although I actually didn't like the dish very much. I'm not a fan of eggs (my bad for ordering this), but the yolks were perfectly golden and runny and, combined with the melted halloumi, fresh tomatoes, and a grilled baguette drizzled with olive oil, made for a very hearty meal.We also split a spritz (summer y'all), which was fine but leaned a bit too heavily on the prosecco.Overall a solid spot to grab a meal if you're in the area, though I'd probably try some of the other options next time.",4,2,2
22,Trisha P.,"New York, NY",295,67,117,4.0,10/7/2018,"We came here for an early dinner and by the time we left the restaurant it was so packed. For apps we got the beet taziki, fried halloumi, and falafel. The fried halloumi was breaded and very crispy, we really loved this app. The beet taziki was garlicy with a little sweetness from the beet, it was a nice twist on normal taziki. The falafels were good however they were lacking a little salt. For dinner we split the chicken shwarma and the chicken was super tender and flavorful. The prices are a little steep for the amount you get, but it's pretty standard for the area.",,,

The flatbread was incredibly fluffy. Lamb sausages were not salty. The red sauce is flavorful, full of spices, and mixed well with everything. Two eggs were cooked sunny side up. Dish wasn't heavy so easy to finish. Loved the Mediterranean decor here. Very refreshing especially on a warm, sunny day.",4,2,2
24,Jeff M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",209,5,0,4.0,11/13/2018,"My boyfriend and I both partook in the Shuka Feast. For the love. Of. God. Pace yourself.We started with the Safi and Ankara (?) cocktails, both of which were outstanding. So well balanced and ultimately refreshing. The first course of the feast came quickly: highlights include the fried cauliflower, the pistachio feta dip (it is to DIE FOR and the chef's recipe is available online), and Ayesha's incredible falafel. The underwhelming elements were definitely the market salad (Why feature a house salad if the goal is to show off your menu?), and some element which included persimmon and was wildly sweet compared to the rest of the plate. All in all, our biggest mistake with the first course was asking for more pita to finish the dips. Trust me, you'll want to stuff yourself, but if you do, you'll end up like me, wandering aimlessly for an hour trying to digest enough to be able to ride the subway.The kebabs! Wow the kebabs! We had steak, lamb, and chicken, and each was tender and perfectly spiced. The lamb was truly exquisite, especially when paired with the spicy cilantro and olive oil mixture with which it is served. I wish I'd had more room to enjoy this course, but alas. The dessert was tasty but underwhelming. It was likely pre-made just for people who did the feast, and didn't seem to feature any regional ingredients (it was a decently made chocolate parfait). While it was good, it was unremarkable, much like most of sister restaurant Cookshop's dessert offerings as of late. Can't say I was surprised, but I had hoped to try that olive oil cake!",,,
25,Saloni C.,"Manhattan, NY",344,55,30,4.0,9/28/2018,"I had lunch at Shuka a few days ago and it was pretty good! The restaurant had a cute and cozy feel to it, which was particularly nice considering the pouring rain outside.The food was good and came out pretty quickly - we ordered the Muhammara dip, Grilled Shrimp Kebab, and Shakshuka. I enjoyed both the dip and kebab (thought the shrimp itself could have used a little more seasoning but was good with its accompaniments). The Shakshuka was pretty good: the sauce had a nice kick to it but wasn't able to make its way into the okra, which resulted in some bites of chewy nothingness. Also, the dish could have used some more eggs - most of my bites (albeit delicious) were just spoonfuls of sauce.We were hoping to close out the meal with a solid dessert and ordered the Toasted Sesame gelato. The gelato was watery, icy, and extremely disappointing. Both my friend and I were really looking forward to it, and it ruined our otherwise wonderful meal.Tl;dr: overall great food and vibe but don't order the gelato!",,,
26,Lisa P.,"West Hartford, CT",339,70,25,4.0,9/15/2018,"It's a must!!!Im in love with this place, what a great blend of Mediterranean food: their zouka was a hot eggplant dip served with a warm pita, (much better than babaganoush), we also got their beet tzasiki dip which was also amazing, these two dips were more than enough for a meal....but we did get the chicken kabob to split. It was on the oily side, but very good dark meat chicken with a yogurt dipping sauce.Our waitor was very attentive and accommodating, he was fast, friendly and gave us all the time we needed to look through the menu - it was so hard to choose because everything looked amazing.We sat right by the window which was open to the street, we felt like we were in Spain, the decor was so pretty, the ambiance was perfect.

The walls have bright blue & white tiles. Chairs are woven, benches comfy. Overall, very fun, relaxing ambiance.We did brunch. For starters, we split the Whipped Feta + Pistachio (whipped feta is a nice, spreadable take on feta cheese), Beet Tzatziki (gotta love beets), and Tahini. The Tahini fell a little flat, but the rest was great.For the table, we also split:Shakshuka - the namesake. really well done. The okra were a nice touch.Tunisian Breakfast - less imaginative, but solid lamb merguez. And I always like muhammara. Chicken Shawarma - for brunch?! Yes, please. Loved the chicken's flavors. And the red cabbage.Chocolate Babka French Toast - babka is an interesting take on french toast. Plus it was a much needed sweet foil to all our salty dishes.Solid cocktails, though they didn't necessarily blow me away. Refreshing, though.A really strong brunch spot that is great for groups!",,,

Sad.Anyway, I'm not kidding...this place has some mean Mediterranean eats. I came for brunch with my girlfriends and got to sample a lot of dishes. We got hummus and fried halloumi for the table, both were excellent and the halloumi was a crowd favorite. I had the Mediterranean plate which was delicious and very filling. The falafel tasted a bit like a veggie burger but was still good. I had a few bites of the shakshuka which is probably the most popular brunch dish and it was great as well. One of my friends got the poached eggs, but asked for the pork belly on the side so I got to have some and the meat was delicious.I'm a fan of a good bloody and got the bacon one which I enjoyed. Two of my friends also got bloodies but they didn't like theirs and the waitress ended up not charging them for the drinks. The only downfall was that our drinks arrived after our food which was beyond annoying, and it also took forever for someone to come take our order. I get it, its NYC on a Sunday with a crazy brunch rush, but drinks MUST ALWAYS come BEFORE the food.",3,1,2
30,Jesse N.,"Manhattan, NY",401,84,23,4.0,9/16/2018,"Very yummy Mediterranean restaurant, and a super cute space! Came here recently and had a great meal, from the cocktails to the food options, I was quite satisfied!If you're in the mood for cocktails, I highly recommend the Blackberry Medina. Light and refreshing drink that has a delicious blackberry flavor but isn't overly sweet. Garnished with a berry and mint, it was a lovely start to the evening. To start, my party split a bunch of appetizers. The falalel and shawarma pita were amazing, but honestly you're missing out if you don't get some dips for the table. We had the Beet Tzatziki (great beet flavor), Whipped Feta and Pistachio Hummus (honestly a journey for your tastebuds), and the Zaalouk (eggplanty goodness). I could've kept eating these dips all night long, and is probably one of my favorite things about Mediterranean cuisine!As an entree, I had the stuffed peppers which was just the right amount of food. I didn't feel overstuffed at the end of the meal but the amount of flavors going through the meat and sauce made this an incredible entree. Definitely check this place out! You'll have great food and great service in a great part of the city.",,,

32,Savanna M.,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",15,76,95,3.0,6/17/2018,"The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. It really looks like something out of Jerusalem or a coastal town in Morocco. The restaurant just seemed so inviting. The music in here is great too. My friend and I came here for brunch and we split two menu items, the chicken shawarma and the babka french toast. The chicken shawarma kind of came served like a pizza and I would have preferred it a little better without the mint leaves. I also asked for the pita to be substituted for the laffa bread which the waiter would not accommodate. The babka french toast was a little overdone, way too crispy on the outside for my liking. I also felt like had it come with a butter or syrup, it would have compensated for the dry crust.",,,

The chicken was so tender and the sauces gave it so much flavor. My only complaint would be the pita because it was a little chewy which made it a little difficult to bite the pita but other than that this dish was amazing. Also got the salad that the waiter recommended and the cube looking things were to my surprise, amazing! It was fried cheese",1,2,
35,Kelly H.,"New York, NY",5,69,37,5.0,5/14/2018,"So cute! I love everything about this place. The interior is gorgeous, and we got a table at the very front of the restaurant looking out onto the street. We came for lunch on a Friday at noon right when they opened, but by 1pm the restaurant was pretty crowded. The Mediterranean Plate is a good choice for someone who wants to try multiple different options. The falafel was great, and of course the pita and hummus was a must-have. My favorite were the za'atar fries, which were seasoned very well! The prices here are very reasonable, especially given the neighborhood. This is a great spot for brunch/lunch. Also very Instagram-friendly ;)The only bummer was that they didn't have baklava when we were there, so we'll have to come back to try that!",1,,1

My friend and I stopped by on Friday at 2:30 and we were able to sit at a table by the open windows on the beautiful spring day. We ordered kebabs, I the tuna and my friend the lamb. My tuna was cooked perfectly, it flaked off the skewers and melted in my mouth. We both got kale on the side and it surpassed my expectations of the generic kale salad you find at the usual west village cafe/restaurant. The bitterness of the kale was masked by a wonderful citrus flavor and crunchy texture from mixed in nuts. The restaurant is painted in a vibrant blue and the theme carries through to the interior. Rugs and beautiful tiles and moldings add to the overall experience and my friend and I didn't want to leave ! I would love to see what this restaurant is like for an evening drink and late dinner.",3,,1
38,Karen C.,"New York, NY",224,65,317,5.0,4/8/2018,"Quite possibly my new favorite Mediterranean brunch spot!!Amazing that this place takes reservations for brunch but if you forgot to do that and wanted to walk in, there's plenty of bar seats for that! My friend and I arrived 11:45 on a Saturday and were seated immediately though the place was packed!The place is much bigger than it seems and the decor is beautiful, from the outside to the first room to the back room, to the skylit back back room!! Bright, blue, homey, airy.Per our server's rec, we ordered the sweets trifecta to start and it was THE move. It comes with a slice of olive oil cake drizzled with lemon syrup topped with slices of grapefruit (satisfies the sweet tooth in your brunch crew), second on the board are two pieces of very sweet baklava (too sweet for my liking), and the last and our favorite - ricotta fritters. Served warm, looks like beignets, drizzled with honey - the softest, fluffiest, little balls of dough. We ate them with the baklava because they were not sweet by itself (and also saved some to dip into our main's sauces).For our mains, I had to go with the shakshuka... I mean if a place is called shuka, you bet that's what I'm trying. It was the best shakshuka I have ever had, sweet and spicy and chunky tomato sauce dressed in Mediterranean herbs, melted halloumi cheese (a first for me) on top, hiding two perfectly soft poached eggs underneath, and the perfect accompaniment to go with it - two slices of crunchy sesame crusted sourdough bread. By far my favorite dish on the table.My friend got poached eggs over thick slices of pork belly with crunchy smashed potatoes, topped with some kind of red pepper, sour tasting vinaigrette to offset the heavy dish. Not my favorite but my friend enjoyed it! I loved the potatoes though. Dipped in my shakshuka.Also we dipped the ricotta fritters into my shakshuka was well.I would take a bath in that shakshuka.Shuka, I will be back soon.",4,,2

Nice for a low key dinner, a boozy brunch, a meeting, whatever! The vibes in here suit all. I seriously wanna live in there hahaThe food was amazing! great service too! we splurged on the shuka feast (51$ pp) but we got a three course meal with a chance to try all the dips and skewers. It was all amazing. The dips and hummus were so fucking good (I liked the beet hummus the best) and the skewers (shrimp, chicken, pork) were to die for.Really big portions too!!",,,

Updated review","Brunch was good, but dinner was even better. Especially if you go as a large group (we had 12) and get the shuka feast - they take the ""feast"" part very seriously. Round 1: a seemingly endless parade of dips, salads, mezze, all delicious and a little bit of a blur as everyone rushes to tear into their fresh pita and swipe it through everything. Absolute standout was the fried cauliflower, little crispy nuggets of bliss. The muhammara is dangerously good too. Round 2: platters of skewered grilled meats. Out of the assortment, my favorite was the steak. Fairly standard preparation, but all were juicy and well-seasoned. Plus it comes on more pita bread to soak up extra juices (be sure to save some dips to make lil sandwiches!) The salad was also a bit of a godsend, I needed some light greens at that point.Round 3: a round of rosewater cardamom pannacotta for everyone, served in an ornate glass and topped with juicy citrus bits. Perfect light ending to the meal, although we also brought a bday cake which was served promptly and headache-free. Between all the rounds were 2 large format cocktails, both excellent. I had some doubts about red pepper in my drink, but it was actually delicious - and dangerous.Don't say I didn't warn you, you will definitely roll out. But it will all be worth it. Lots of good hospitality all around as well.",2,,1
42,Chris P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",378,97,45,5.0,4/8/2018,"THIS PLACE WAS SO Y.U.M.*** FOOD ***We came for brunch and ordered the Tunisian Breakfast and Poached Eggs. Wow. I tried a bit of the Tunisian Breakfast but soon after realizing the hummus had triggered by now-more-mild nut allergy, I stopped eating it. Still, through my pre-anaphylactic (didn't get there) state of mind I loved what I tasted. The humble sounding Poached Eggs were spectacular as well. Two perfectly poached (aka runny yolk) eggs perched (dark, I know) atop a garden of crispy fingerling potatoes that were soaking up the spicy oil at the bottom of the dish. Four pieces (so eat them delicately and little by little with each bite) of pork belly graced the platter throughout. If you get the perfect bite it really is heaven: the creaminess of the egg with the spicy crisp potatoes and melting and crunchy pork belly really almost killed me. And on top of that the rest of their menu sounds amazing too: Ricotta Pancakes with roasted apples?! Chocolate Babka French Toast?!!! SHAKSHUKA?!?!?!?! And so much more. Will definitely be coming back for more.*** VIBES ***Classic NYC brunch vibe. *** SERVICE ***Average.",1,,
43,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,422,1424,5.0,3/19/2018,"First impressions: each dish here has SO much flavor that it's almost like sensory overload to eat all of them at once. Although the menu looks simple at first, Shuka offers bold Mediterranean/Middle Eastern dishes with a fun and modern flair. My boyfriend and I shared:- Fava and Eggs - this is a pretty boring name for such a delicious appetizer. Smooth and creamy hummus topped with chickpeas and a deep fried egg (poke into it for a perfect egg yolk burst!) and served with a side of warm pita. - Fried Halloumi - there's no other fried cheese I love more than fried haloumi! These little nuggets of cheese packed so much flavor in each one. Although halloumi cheese is naturally salty, the portion size of the dish was just the right amount without feeling overwhelmed with saltiness.- Fried Artichokes - my boyfriend wasn't a big fan of this, mostly because the artichokes weren't as crispy as he hoped. I still really enjoyed it, mainly because I like artichokes in general. This came with a nice lemon-y yoghurt sauce that worked well with the dish.- Lamb Tagine - this was served in a small decorative tagine, which was so reminiscent of my travels to Morocco. The lamb chunks were juicy and tender, and the bits of pomegranate sprinkled over the couscous brought a tasty brightness to the otherwise heavier dish. We had a bit left for leftovers the next day and it tasted just as delicious.- Olive cake - thick slice of cake (similar to a pound cake) with a strong and aromatic orange flavor. I'm personally in love with citrus flavors and really enjoyed this!- Rosemary & Olive ice cream - the scoop is not very large but the rosemary flavor was surprisingly very prominent without being overwhelming. Sweet and interesting flavor.On top of the great food, the interior has elegant and exotic touches, and the lighting is a bit dim but inviting. Service was also fantastic throughout the night. Can't wait to come back with some girlfriends!",2,,1
44,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",237,38,59,5.0,7/27/2018,"Order: I split a Shakshuka with a friend and it was really filling with two eggs and bits of okra surrounded by a pool of tomato sauce. It also came with pita bread too to scoop up the leftover sauce! For appetizers, we had Fried Halloumi and Crispy Squash along with amazing creamy dips like Labne. Price: Decent prices with high quality food and serving sizes.Service: All the waiters are so friendly. There's a greeter at the entrance and the interior design makes the place seem so cozy. Our waitress was very patient and accommodating, telling my coworker (very allergic to wheat) what had wheat or whether any of the other foods touched wheat.",1,,

My friend had a kebab and the serving looked generous and she said it was very good. I had a spritz to drink and it was ideal.

48,Tai M.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,133,57,4.0,9/30/2018,"Came here on a Sunday night without a reservation and were seated right away. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and quiet spacious. It took a while before our waiter appeared to take our drink order. When he finally arrived we ordered a bottle of wine along with zaalouk and muhammara dips. The wine and food appeared quickly, which obviously means that the dips were premade. The zaalouk was really tasty! In fact, it's probably the best eggplant dip I've had. We ran out of pita and asked for another order but it didn't arrive for a long time by the time it came we were done with our dips. Our waiter hardly made an appearance after that. When he finally resurfaced, we placed another order of one appetizer plus 2 entrees: a shrimp kebab and Mediterranean  Paella. Sure enough, the appetizers and entrees all arrived at the same time. Why would we order another appetizer to have it come out with our entrees? The waiter was completely clueless! We couldn't even enjoy our food because we had to eat the appetizers quickly so the entrees wouldn't get cold. The paella had too little vegetables and was mostly filled with salty rice. The kebabs weren't that great either. If I could have rated this place a 3.5 I would have.",,,1

50,Melanie C.,"New York, NY",256,26,92,5.0,7/1/2018,"Does this place really need any more reviews? I stopped by for a classic Sunday brunch, had a plate or five, and waddled out with no regrets besides my decision to wear a tight dress.First off (because dessert first) the lemon ricotta pancakes are crack. That's the only adequate analogy. Despite their impressive size, and regardless of how many other dishes you order, you will somehow find space in your stomach to finish every last delectable, pillowy, zesty bite.I also suggest ordering one of every dip with a side of cloud-like, doughy pita. The labne with harissa was fluffy and creamy, the Muhamarra was excellent textured, and the tzatziki and feta didn't disappoint. I felt obliged to order the namesake dish, which was fine, but I'm discovering that shakshuka kind of tastes the same everywhere you go. The spit roasted chicken shawarma flatbread, on the other hand, was salty and slightly spicy and everything you wanted out of a carb-y Mediterranean feast.We had some form of a mimosa, which also disappeared too quickly. Overall, out of all the hyped-up brunch spots I've been downtown, this is one of my favorites. The courtyard-style, light-filled interior didn't hurt for the Insta story either.",2,3,

Honestly I have very limited experience with Mediterranean food so I'm not sure if this is better than other places but I liked the food. ENVIRONMENT: this restaurant is located near Soho on Prince St and Macdougal St. I took the D train from 34th and it took me less than 15mins to get here. The interior is very cute and the restaurant was full. I recommend making a reservation beforehand since the wait to a table was 1 hour when I got there. But bar seats are available if you are okay with that. Service was good and cost check is available, which helped a lot for a rainy day like today. FOOD: my friend and I came for brunch and got the French toast and the Tunisian Breakfast. We both liked the food. Very instagrammable too. My friend also got a tea but she disliked it so be cautious of that. Overall I definitely recommend this place for catching up with friends and a date.",1,,
53,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",59,467,2648,4.0,1/21/2018,"Very solid mediterranean for somewhat decent prices. We had a group of three and ordered a lot (in rough order of my personal preference):- Fried artichokes- Muhammara- Fried haloumi- Pork kofta kebab- Grilled shrimp kebab----- Bourekas- Whipped feta + pistachio- Za'atar fries- Crispy chickpeas- Chocolate gelato- Olives----- Falafel- TzatzikiMy wife's favorites were the haloumi and the shrimp, but didn't have too many other gripes about the rankings above. I would definitely order everything in the top tier above next time around -- everybody absolutely loved the artichokes, and while I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the beet hummus or baba ganoush on the menu the night we went, it was mostly made up for by the outstanding muhammara (red pepper / walnut dip). I would be more neutral on the middle tier (all good, but I'd be willing to branch out to other things in their place), and I probably wouldn't order the falafel or tzatziki again. (The tzatziki may have been great tzatziki, but it's just not my thing.)Overall, a really solid dinner spot.",4,1,1

55,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",395,4085,7998,4.0,6/1/2018,"Ever since I traveled to Israel and Jordan as part of an epic, round-the-world ""eat, pray, love"" journey after our stolen U.S. election the other year, I haven't found Mediterranean fare stateside that's anywhere near as tasty and fresh as what I had in the Levant. So when I was back in NYC recently, I was excited to find this highly-rated, reasonably-priced venue here on Yelp.I arrived towards the tail end of the weekend brunch rush to find that there was still a wait, even for the first-come, first-served bar. After waiting for a while, I was next in line for an open seat at the bar until a super-entitled woman breezed right past me (and all the pushy people behind me in line) and grabbed the seat that was being vacated without any objection from the front desk.Fortunately, being Asian doesn't have to mean that you're invisible to Caucasians 100% of the time. The front desk noticed and corrected this miscue by ensuring that the next table that opened up was given to me.I promptly started enjoying some beer alongside their Mediterranean plate, which featured a decent helping of tzatziki, beet hummus, falafel, tahini, za'atar, 6-minute egg, turmeric pickles, and pita. The beet hummus and tahini were particularly delicious.Since I'd held back my appetite all day long, I still had room for more. The ""bird's nest"" dessert - shredded phyllo, farmers cheese, apricots, and pistachio - hit the mark. It was appealing for both the eyes and the taste buds, and it was just the right size. It also struck the right balance between savory and sweet. Enough of both, but not too much of either.Front desk miscue aside, service was actually quite good from my waitress. While Shuka might not quite compare to freshly made fare at a beachside Tel Aviv restaurant or in a rustic cottage in Jordan, it's still quite a delightful spot for weekend brunch. Thanks Yelpers for a good find!",4,,4
56,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",322,351,303,5.0,6/17/2018,"Went to Shuka with a party of 4 on a Friday evening with a 9:30pm reservation. We were running 15 min late and then waited another 10 min to sit. It was crazy how many ppl were still eating around 10pm. Reservation was made a week in advance on open table.I had gotten the run down from a close friend on Shuka and she recommended the feast. So happy we took the recommendation and did the feast for 4 since we got to try so many different items on the menu. The feast started with an appetizer course that literally could have been the dinner. I'm not sure who could possibly finish all of the apps and still have room for a main and dessert. The first course had 4 dips (Muhammara, labne, beet tzatiki, and a green cheese based one with pistachio?), roasted chickpeas, falafel, pita, turnips, a radish salad, pickled veggies, and olives. It was all absolutely delicious! There wasn't anything that we didn't enjoy. For the main course, we were literally in awe of how much other food came out. For this course, there was a chicken kebab, beef kebab, sausage, lamb kebab and a shrimp kebab on a bed of salad and pita with spicy carrots and a huge bowl of fries on the side. My personal favorite was probably the lamb kebab. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender. The fries were also seasoned really really well. We couldn't finish all of the main course either. The waitress was able to wrap up our leftovers apps and main course, which was perfect for 2 more meals and a side at home. We weren't clear what the dessert was. It looked like a yogurt parfait with apricot on top. I'm not a huge dessert person and didn't really care for this. We also all got a drink with dinner (cocktail, 2 beers, and rose). The total came out to ~$70/person before tip. I'm not sure I've ever gotten so much value for a quality meal in nyc! Would love to come back soon and highly recommend!!",1,,

I have yet to make it here for brunch or lunch and the menu may differ.I just wish the zaatar fries were not overly salty. Also for such a trendy place the servers are extremely nice.

Our large party was seated around a lovely round table, with a comfortable and cozy bench with pillows for decoration. The vibe was  perfect for celebrating something special. The menu has tons of options to choose from, and lots of smaller plates and dips to share for a big group. There was something for everyone to eat, and there's definitely enough healthy options for those who need it. We scarfed down the following: TARAMASALATA // This smooth and creamy dip was made with smoked arctic char and topped with trout roe. The dish had a mild seafood flavor, and a perfectly creamy consistency. The roe on top added for bites popping with a salty flavor!WHIPPED FETA + PISTACHIO // Another dip I couldn't stop dipping pita into! The whipped feta had a creamy and tangy consistency, while the pistachio added a textural crunch, and the dill added a fresh note. Definitely a must order!FRIED ARTICHOKES // These crispy chokes were so crunchy and satisfying. They aren't fried in a batter, but crispy all along their many edges. They are served with a refreshing lemon yogurt to lighten the dish.CRISPY CAULIFLOWER // These little nuggets of cauliflower were so fun to pop in your mouth! They are completely coated in a batter, FYI, but are light to bite into. The aioli is perfectly creamy and adds the flavor to the plain cauli.HAWAIJ SPICED CHICKEN KEBAB // The kebabs were huge and phenomenal! After splitting all the smaller plates, a friend and I shared one kebab and it was more than enough. The chicken pieces are crispy on the outside, with the fabulous spice mix, but not dry on the inside. It's served with a side salad.Everything was delicious.

66,Alan S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",222,76,14,5.0,8/23/2018,"After Cafe Orlin closed, I was looking for a brunch spot with a vaguely Mediterranean flair, and Shuka has in fact proved to be a superior replacement. While I generally prefer savory over sweet for brunch, every rule is worth breaking once in a while, and I would do so anytime for Shuka's chocolate babka french toast. The shakshuka is also excellent, if a bit untraditional (I wasn't expecting a layer of cheese to coat the dish).",,,
67,Melody L.,"Washington, DC",11,180,382,4.0,6/4/2018,"We came for brunch on a Sunday without a reservation and were very lucky that a group didn't show up so that we were able to take their table. The bright blue exterior of the restaurant is inviting and the interior is gorgeous. The place is much bigger than it seems and even has a beautiful room in the back that gets natural sunlight. The food didn't quite match the amazingness of the interior decorations but was still good. Like some others, I thought it was overpriced. The brunch bowl was a glorified kale salad that just didn't justify the $17 menu price. However, the muhammara dip was excellent and my sister and her boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the Mediterranean plate and poached eggs. I think the best part of the meal was definitely the pita bread that came with the dip. Warm, soft, baked to perfection.",,,

We came pretty late in the afternoon, but we still had to wait about 30 min. We walked around the neighborhood until they texted us. The decor was bright, airy and eclectic. Once we ordered, the food came out super quickly..dare I say too quickly? I ordered the SpitFire Chicken Shawarma. It was really flavorful and not too spicy. I would recommend ordering the pita bread on the side, as it is served with the chicken and sauce on top and gets quite soggy after awhile. We shared a side of fries which was more than enough for three people. My friend got the chocolate french toast...in my opinion the portion size was tiny and it was too rich.",3,,1

The place is very cute and the servers are very attentative even with alot of people at our table. The reason for 3 star is:1) the way our waitress was trying to sell certain dish. - she recommended some dish and was almost like a sales person. The worst is that they were really not up to par. Especially the watermelon dessert. Yuk, don't get it. Not worth 10 dollars for tiny water melon piecee with chili powder on it. 2) the food. We had the kale salad and Crispy cauliflower as appetizer and they were so salty! Also the Kabab was extremely small portioned with one thin half slice of pita and 2 pieces of onions and 2 sauce. It's pretty overpriced for the portion.The best thing was the ice creams, we had Turkish coffee, dark chocolate, and toasted sesame. In conclusion, I will not be returning back because of the lack of taste in the food and the portion.",1,,

As soon as you enter the restaurant, you are immediately welcomed with decorative, warm copper tones which provide for great ambience. Staff is excellent and very hands on.  They really are on top of everything especially considering how busy they were.  You can tell everyone is in-sync and willing to chip in, displaying great teamwork.  Looking around at the other guests in the restaurant, you can definitely tell everyone was enjoying themselves.  We did the ""Shuka Feast"" option which provided for a fun experience.  It really brings everyone together and gives you that warm, cozy family experience as if you're dining in your own home.  We were all so pleased with the plethora of food and vast varieties and options.  No two dishes were the same. You can tell Chef Ayesha is putting a lot of love, hard work, and creative thought into these dishes!  Everything was so fresh especially the soft, hot pita bread which made the food even more enjoyable. We really loved every dish but a few standouts on the table were:  crispy cauliflower (We finished these right away!  A great crunch and texture to them. Loved the aioli. I could totally eat a huge bowl of these), beet hummus (rich and decadent), lahmajoun (This is hard to get right. I've tried many but this was amazing and loved how crispy it was. I enjoyed the spiciness too. That's exactly how I grew up eating them), spicy carrots (never had them this way but really liked it), fattoush salad (I hardly ever find a good one and this was exactly how it should be! What a good crunch and everything was so fresh) and the sirloin steak skewers (loved the spices, very flavorful).  Overall, it was a great, flavorful spread. Oh and last but not least, can't forget the delicious and scrumptious panna cotta desert. It had a silky and smooth texture. Definitely very rich. I couldn't put it down. We all loved it. I loved the pistachios on top. Being I am of middle eastern descent, these dishes are as good as it gets and spot on. There were others of middle eastern descent also dining here which says a lot.  With that said, I highly recommend you try this fantastic restaurant and menu!",1,1,1

It tastes very natural with almost no added ingredients other than beets and hummus.

Very delicious- mezcal tequila based with a hint of grapefruit. Ordered the crispy cauliflower - SO good- basically tater tots. Brussel sprouts were also really good if you want a green, but nothing to write home about. The falafel was also very good, recommend ordering that. We got the lamb Kebob which comes with pita and a mini salad (with pomegranate ). Very very good!!!Would recommend this place - if open table doesn't have a reso just call!

I ordered the shakshuka and my boyfriend had the Tunisian breakfast. Both were very flavorful and very filling. The bread that came with the shakshuka was perfectly crispy. Since we only ordered food and no drinks, our bill was pretty reasonable. Id say pricing here is pretty standard compared to other brunch spots. Lastly, the service here was good. We did get there about 10 min before they opened so they were still setting things up. We had to wait a little while before our waiter came and served us, but after that service was great! I would definitely come back here and try some of their other dishes.",,,1

Updated review","KenScale: 7.5/10For the last meal of 2017, my wife Jun and I went on a double date with another couple. Shuka, in the former Hundred Acres space in the south side of SoHo that was turned into a Mediterranean restaurant by the team behind neighborhood favorites like Vic's and Cookshop, has long been under my radar so I booked a reservation there. Mediterranean is such a broad and concept in culinary parlance so you should be a little more specific on the geographic focus. There is certainly a distinct difference between the more European-bent cuisine and the one more rooted in the tradition of the Middle East. Shuka tends to lean on the latter. While there were some nice dishes, I felt our dinner was somewhat pedestrian.A meal at any Mediterranean restaurant should of course start with dips / spreads which more often than not also tend to serve as a pretty good barometer of how good the restaurant is. On that department, Shuka was already mixed from the beginning. It's of course hard to find fault with the Greek classic Tzatziki. Everyone's favorite seems to be muhammara spread consisting of roasted pepper and walnut which I loved for its smoky feel. The biggest disappointment was, however, the labne with harissa. Jun and I who have grown fond of harissa during our trip to Morocco earlier this year had very high expectations for this dip, which however turned out to be more like cream cheese gone bad where we couldn't even get to enjoy the spicy kick of harissa. Other dishes that followed had varying levels of success. The grills (we've had sirloin steak, shawarma spiced chicke and pork kofta meatballs) were overall serviceable, but I wished the seasoning of each meat were toned down a bit. I kept thinking to the days during our trip to Morocco where we can more successful grills with a lot less seasoning. The best dish of the night was the vegetable paella where the combination of foraged mushroom, squash, parsnips, Brussels sprout leaves and tarragon worked wonderfully together for very nice complexity of flavor that was quite delicious and memorable. On the other hand, the chicken schnitzel with sesame was OK but not particularly interesting. Getting a reservation at Shuka wasn't too difficult although the space got pretty packed during our dinner on the last Friday evening. There is full bar with somewhat exotic groups of wines that I hadn't seen previously and I'm not sure that I will fall in after I sample each. The vibe of the dining space is that of a typical downtown Manhattan neighborhood restaurant looking to draw locals and tourists alike. Shuka was not bad but it had its fair share of hits and misses. For a casual, no-frills dinner, it may be worth checking out just for the scene and the location, but there are other Mediterranean / Middle Eastern restaurants on my list that I look forward to checking out with more enthusiasm in 2018.",4,1,2
85,Poonam D.,"Manhattan, NY",300,74,77,4.0,8/14/2018,Great vibe with an ethnic decor. We got the beet taziki and pistachio feta. They both were really good. They are served with pita bread. The squash dish and the peach dish were both ok. I would probably not get those again. The dates were sweet and spicy. The olive oil cake was also ok. Probably wouldn't get it again.,,,
86,Nina L.,"Midwood, Brooklyn, NY",2,114,3,1.0,7/29/2018,"Can't review the food because I haven't tried it and never will.Came in 5 pm on a Saturday for an early dinner, there was plenty of empty tables. It was a table for 2 people, not a lot of space. However , I was told there's no available tables due to ""reservations"". Doubt many ppl had tables reserved at 5-6 pm , most likely 7pm.I was told I can have dinner by the bar, as I looked around and saw plenty of empty tables at 5 pm , anger rushed through my body and I left.Will not be back. You are not that special Shuka.",,,
87,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,4.0,1/3/2018,"Enjoyable, group friendly and moderately priced Lebanese-Medi type restaurant. This took over the old Hundred Acres space but is run by the same group. You can make a res on Resy easily but I did also book in advance. I made a res wiith Resy (only on Resy) 2-3 weeks in advance...I didn't see a ton of availability as we got closer to date but when arriving at the restaurant, found it rather empty?We had pretty quick service. The restaurant is very cute and decently spacious. We were a party of four- two couples. The waiter made great recommendations. To start, we had a couple of cocktails (the Cairo and another on, name I forget), and couple glasses of wine. They had a lot of variety. I liked the cab franc I bad - felt overall that the wines were reasonably priced, too. For the food. We shared the crispy cauliflower (delicious - but not healthy; tempura'ed with spicy aioli), the labneh yogurt spread (delicious - always is), olives, and fried halloumi which is like an awesome mozzarella stick. Great texture. This one was particularly a bit too breaded for my liking but overall still not bad. For dinner, my husband got the lamb kebab; another diner the shwarma spiced chicken, my bestie the Dizi (I did not try because I don't like lamb but heard it was very flavorful), and myself  -  a big portion of delicious, delicately battered with sesame chicken milanese. Thinly pounded with yummy greens. The menu is quite varied - it's llke Medi/Lebanese/Spainish/Israeli.. they have things like paella on there, tons of kebabs and other regional specialties. For dessert, we had the deliciously soaked, fragrant but not too sweet olive oil cake. It was very yummy, almost as good as my favorite from Otto. Yummy, lively, quick. I recommend. Prices in the $20s - nothing gets over $30.",6,1,6

89,Abeer H.,"Jackson Heights, NY",44,275,1,4.0,7/15/2018,"We got a table for 4 around noon just walking in on a Sunday so that's already a win. They've got friendly service, neat and clean decor, and Mediterranean tapas and brunch. We got the lebneh (great, with yummy fresh pita), the kale salad (also excellent though maybe needed more ingredients), a poached eggs with tomato sauce dish (good though maybe heavy on the tomatoes for me - not so for others - they loved it), and a couple of other dishes which were also enjoyed. I'd go back.",,,
90,Celeni P.,"Dillon, CO",143,38,0,3.0,8/18/2018,"The food was great but my low mark is for how awful the service was...We had a 7pm reservation for 5 people and were told when we arrived that they needed the table for a 9pm reservation after us. That's totally fair and fine, and we would absolutely be respectful and be out by then. But our server made us feel so rushed! It was uncomfortable. We knew when we had to finish by so at least let us enjoy the meal. Then I asked for a straw for my high ball glass because the ice kept hitting my teeth. I am eco friendly so of course I only ask if necessary. The server made such a big deal about it. He was like okay but who actually needs one? We are trying to conserve straws. Way to make me feel more guilty! Then to top it off he brings a paper/cardboard eco friendly straw! Why the hell would you make a scene and make someone feel bad when you are using a recyclable straw to begin with. Pshh it was some rude BS.",,,
91,Sam K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",134,190,351,4.0,3/4/2018,"I love Mediterranean food for its shareable plates, and the menu at Shuka allowed for that kind of dining experience. A friend and I went here on a weekday after work, because we could only get a reservation on the earlier side (6pm). We took our time drinking and ordering apps, and never got hungry enough to dabble in the entree section.For drinks, a fruity champagne cocktail after work makes me happy. The Monaco was that perfect drink! We sipped on those twice over and then ordered some apps:Beet hummus: a great take on a classic, but strong in beet flavor so if you don't like beets it won't be your thing.Fattoush salad: when I ordered this I don't think I knew what Haloumi was, but the salad came topped with these warm melty cheese cubes that made the saladFalafel was a bit different from other falafels I've had. It almost seemed like it had whole pine nuts in it or something. This is the only dish I would skip..If I save the best for last, it's hands down the Smashed sweet potatoes! Baked until the potatoes are super soft, served smothered in a whipped feta butter sauce.. you will have to taste for yourself!",,,

93,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,1/10/2018,"Went here with a friend to grab dinner after reading so many great things about this place. We made a reservation and were able to be seated right away.We were pretty hungry, so we decided to split a few dishes:Cauliflower (4 stars): This was tasty--nothing mind-blowing, but a solid dish.Fried halloumi (5 stars): Oh my god. This dish was so delicious--seriously addicting and a must order.Lamb tagine (3.5 stars): This was probably the least memorable dish of the night as the lamb was cooked well, but just did not have that much flavor.Chicken schnitzel (3.5 stars): This was a solid version of a classic dish and a good-sized portion as well. The spice rub on the breading was a little overpowering though and took away a bit from the meat.Overall, this place served up some decent dishes with the halloumi far and way being the best dish we ate. That dish is definitely in the running for one of the best starters in NYC so make sure you don't miss it. In addition, service was friendly and space is open and lively.

We ordered cucumber mint lemonade which was surprisingly bland. We also tried the crispy chick peas (fried chick peas) which tasted like how you'd imagine it: gross.

After tasting the food, I'd happily pay the price, though sadly not too frequently.We split the summer salad and chicken shawarma over bread. They were gorgeously plated, and absolutely delicious.

To eat we shares three mezes, one dip, and two kebabs. Please note: THE KABABS ARE FUCKING EXPENSIVE AND COME WITH SIX CUBES OF MEAT. Do not expect your $16 kebab to take you a long way. I can't remember what mezes we got besides the fries (which were so good and came with a ton of fries) and the tip we got was the Tzatziki. The dip came with one pita (sad...why not more??) and the kebabs came with one as well (also...we got two kebabs why only one pita guys??). Besides the lack of pita and the stupid prices, I would recommend on the basis was the food was very good. The decor is also SUPER cute and the couch is veryyy comfy.

Updated review","Flavors, spices, and everything on point. Had the beet hummus, pistachio dip, lebne, chicken shawarma, and fried haloumi. Everything was great, and the flavors were so strong that we didn't care too much for the beet hummus. The chicken shawarma sauce was good and portion is enough for 2. One of the best meals we had on our NY visit4/24/2018 visit - wanted to end NY trip at the same place as last time. Tried the lamajoun this time. As an Armenian I was skeptical at how good it would be. Back home they're about 1.75$ each, so 16$ was a huge difference. However, after eating it, it was totally worth it. It was like it was homemade. Beef was really good with the spices, and there is a good amount of it on the bread. This, combined with the crunchiness, made it taste homemade. Try putting lemon on it if you go with this dish. Was really happy.",4,,1

We went with a selection of mezzes, sides, and a dip:Fava hummus - this was our waiter's second recommendation for a dip after the whipped feta, but it was incredible. Served hot, with oil, red pepper, and whole chickpeas on top, it was incredible, 10/10. Would love to try the other hummus as well, though the bread it came with was pretty standard.Fried halloumi - you can't go wrong with fried cheese, but this was totally standout! 10/10 again. Warm dates - these came 5 or 6 to the plate, unpitted, and were lightly covered in a sweet syrup that had a hint of spice, which was amazing, 10/10Falafel - these were served on a bed of tahini, and were moist on the inside with whole bits of lentils mixed in for texture. Really good, 8/10.Roasted carrots - the spice mix and herbs this came with were amazing. We wished that the carrots were roasted a little longer / were a little softer, but still generally good, especially when paired with some of the tahini from the halloumi or falafel dishes, 7/10Spinach pie - this was a bit of a letdown. The flavor wasn't very differentiated (just bold lemon and spinach mixed), and the crust was too thin and crunchy.  We gave this 4/10.Fried cauliflower - 2/10, this was a huge letdown! The breading was too heavy, and the cauliflower was cooked to a mash inside. They pretty much could have been French fries given the lack of texture or different cauliflower fries, which was disappointing! Had been picturing Zahav's fried cauliflower, though of course that's too high of a bar.Ramp flatbread - not at all what we were picturing with a flatbread, this was a thin bread with labneh, cooked ramps, a (turmeric?) boiled egg, and a fried egg spread over it. Pretty good, though it was unexpectedly large and a little monotonous by the end. 7/10The mezzes and dip we picked were almost all incredible, we'd love to come back and try the mujadara or kebabs next time instead of the small plates. In all, the food & service were really, really great!",3,,1

We had reservations, which weren't needed when we arrived but definitely will be if you plan on having a 1pm or 2pm lunch. We order two plates of fries to share. The fries were really, really good - very well seasoned. However, even with the 6 of us, two orders was too much! A coworker and I opted to order 4 small plates and split it. I think our favorite was the pistachio and whipped feta dip and the bourekas, which is a puff pastry with feta inside. Both were spectacular and everyone loved the pistachio/feta dip. We also tried the beet hummus and falafel, but didn't think either of them were super good. I also tried my coworkers' chicken kebab and lamb kebab. Both were really, really good and I definitely want to come back for it.",2,,2

Must say, place is hard to get in even on a weeknight without reservation. We were told that there is about 80 mins of wait but luckily we got in when someone didn't show up for their reservation. We ordered fried halloumi which for me, was the star dish. All of their dips are great in taste too, consistency and texture. I really liked the Muhammara dip. The main course were a spicy chicken kebab and a grilled lamb sausage. Chicken was really flavorful while the lamb was succulent but slightly bland for my taste. I wish there was more quantity of chicken/meat in entree. But overall, the food, decor and ambience was great.",,,

There is copious amount of room inside the restaurant, and lighting is soft and comfortable.* Housemade labne dip ($8) - Bit on the thicker side of dips, the labne is largely yogurt-based. Not for me, but if you like tzatziki, you'd probably like this.* Crispy cauliflower ($11) - This appetizer was so good. The crispiness of the outside didn't harden the chewiness of the cauliflower itself, and each piece was so deliciously meaty that it had a similar consistency of mushrooms. * Veggie paella ($22) - My first time having veggie paella, and it exceeded my expectations. Super impressed how there could be so much flavor, when usually it comes from the seafood that this one lacked. A++* Chicken kebab ($16) - Kebab served on a very heavy and dangerous-looking metal spear, which it was clearly cooked on. Legit. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Not much to add here. Prob not worth the price for the amount we got. Overall, great ambiance and good for large parties as well. Would come back, and try their cocktails.",,,
115,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,5.0,3/13/2018,"""Will you come to SoHo?"" my less than gracious friend asked when I inquired about meeting for lunch.  Despite being inconvenient for me, I agreed to make the trip, but vowed to pick a venue off my wish list to make it even more worthwhile.  Sorting through the options, I immediately selected Shuka.  I was a fan of other Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer restaurants, and I loved Mediterranean cuisine, so it was high on my list of places to visit.  The elegant café was spacious and feminine with the vibe of a ""ladies who lunch"" atmosphere - bright tapestries, clean lines, refined SoHo classiness.  I arrived first and was escorted to a table in front of the floor-length windowed façade and was able to see my friend approaching.  Once we were both comfortably seated with our initial pleasantries completed, we transitioned to planning our meal.  With so many enticing options, we thought it would be best to share a few different things from various sections of the menu.  We started with the Kale Salad, which the kitchen thoughtfully separated for us into two bowls.  The greens had been simply tossed with radish slices and sunflower seeds, but the star of the dish was the sprinkling of sarvecchio cheese, which was a variety of parmesan.  The salty, nutty hard cheese was intoxicating and drove our forks continuously into, what would otherwise be, a boring plate of lettuce.  The delicate Citronette dressing added a hint of bright citrus.  As much as we wanted to instantly finish our salads, we had to pace ourselves for the next two courses that were on their way.  The Mediterranean Plate was the comprehensive offering one would expect from its title - encompassing an array of vegetarian selections.  There was a helping of Labne, which resembled a thick cream cheese.  The Beet Hummus was smooth and bright in both color and flavor.  The Falafel patties were crisp and well-spiced, and the Pitas were soft and fluffy.  Tahini, Za'atar, Hard-Boiled Egg, Turmeric, and Pickles rounded out the classic flavors from that region.  Lastly, the Grilled Shrimp Kebab was dramatically served on its metal skewer, unlike most restaurants that unexcitingly remove the spear.  The plump shellfish possessed the perfect crunch and had been heavily marinated in shug before behind grilled, ensuring their garlicky, peppery flavor.  The shrimp were served with a side of cabbage, pomegranate seeds, spiced yogurt, and more pita, so that we could make our own wraps.My friend and I walked away from our meal in absolute delight, pleasantly surprised by this fresh and vivid restaurant that we felt surpassed all others by this talented culinary duo.   It was a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",7,3,6

So when I heard the same team reopened Hundred Acres under the name Shuka & it is Mediterranean, I have to come check it out.Decor wise, pretty much the same as Hundred Acres, Shuka's previous life - or to ceiling windows open up in the front room. However, the menu is completely revamped and packed up Mediterranean goodies like fried halloumi, lamb tartare and grilled porgy. We came in 8 ish on Monday night and we were seated right away. Starting with spicy carrot, lamb tartare andfri d halloumi. Do note that the carrots are raw, not fried. I like le it, especially it is mixed with cumin and ginger, tho my date didn't (not a salad person).regardless, we both enjoyed the halloumi and lamb tartare. If any comment, I do wish the lam tartare would be less acidic. For entree, he got the chicken schnitzel while I got the lamb kababs. I like the flavors especially the lamb came with spicy tomato sauce and yogurt dip, tho it was some what over cooked. I was asking for medium rare :/Wine list was more limited than Vic's but there are some off-the-beaten-path offering like the sémillon/sauvignon blanc from Israel .Overall, food is good.

The wait times were horrible even though we had a reservation, BUT the food made up for it!We got a few dips (pistachio feta, labneh) an the dates, the hallumi and some kebabs! It was all incredible.

119,Hu W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,122,17,2.0,7/3/2018,Very busy restaurant with a mideastern decor.  I sat by the bar table.  The waitress gave me very little attention and very slow in taking my order or refill drinks or give a check.  Without paying enough attention she got my order wrong.  The menu is on a piece of paper and lack of selection.  Tradition lamb dish for mideastern food they only have tiny sausages with bones in them.  Do not quite understand the rave about this place.,,,

We opted for the platter of the three different pastries (which would definitely be suitable for 3-4 people, as the two of us still had enough to take bomb leftovers home). The ricotta balls with honey were our personal faves. The shakshuka was very good, but it would be cool if they added different types, since it's called 'shuka after all.",,,

125,Alyssa Y.,"New York, NY",72,256,39,3.0,10/16/2017,"While Shuka is still working out some kinks, it's a marked improvement on Hundred Acres. At least when it comes to the revamped decor...Long story short, service was the major sticking point. We repeatedly had to wave down our waiter OR when they were nowhere to be found, any employee. Period. Other gripes: our entrees were served before our appetizer and my water glass was chipped, dangerously so. Brunch food was mediocre. The beet hummus and chicken shawarma were super bland and my eggs in the shakshuka were overcooked, i.e. not runny. Honestly, the harissa mary was the highlight of my meal (WARNING: the jalapeno mary tasted like straight-up tabasco so skip it!). Bottomline: I'm giving 3 stars (instead of 2) because it's still early days and I'm a big fan of Rosie's and Cookshop, also by Freeman and Meyer. I'd wait another few months before returning though.",,,

Everyone was very friendly - no fuss coming in (in gym clothes too), and the bar tender/servers were friendly and easy to talk to.The food was a generous serving.

129,Angelina H.,"New York, NY",257,10,15,4.0,6/19/2018,"Had a great first experience at Shuka. As someone who is half Lebanese, I thought the food was very well done and pretty authentically Mediterranean, except for the hummus (still very good though). We ordered a few starters: the House Made Labne (EXCELLENT), the Fava Hummus, and the Whipped Feta + Pistachio - all very good. My friend and I shared between us the Fattoush Salad and the Crispy Squash Blossoms. The fattoush was amazing and the halloumi cheese was a great touch, as fattoush is not always served with cheese. Our other friend got the Spit Roasted Chicken Shwarma which I thought was great. My only problem with this restaurant was that all of the food came out way too fast, so we left so full because we felt that we ate too quickly. The dessert menu looked good, but unfortunately, we were stuffed. Overall, I really liked this restaurant and would definitely go back again!",,,
130,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5152,3.0,1/30/2018,"Shuka should be on your short list for large restaurants when you plan to dine with several people with varying dietary restrictions. Whether you're paleo, gluten free, vegan, and anything in between, there's something here you can eat, and chances are it'll be pretty good. That's of course how most Mediterranean restaurants roll in general with so many beans, vegetables, nightshades, and meats that make up the cuisine.It's a beautiful space with perfectly fine food. I had the Mediterranean plate with labne, beet hummus, falafel, tahini, za'atar, six-minute egg, with a side of pickles and pita and it was a lovely and light way to start my weekend. At $18 it's several dollars more expensive than you'll find at almost every other Mediterranean restaurant in town, and that's a theme you'll find throughout the menu. Prime location and a beautiful buildout means you're helping finance the debt, it's not a hard concept to understand. But if you compare every related item on Shuka's menu to say, Jack's Wife Frieda - a similarly trendy and upscale Mediterranean operation - you'll notice that you're paying $4-$5 more here on almost everything. Is that a bad thing? That's highly subjective and impossible for me to ascertain, but there's no avoiding the reality that you're paying a premium, comparatively speaking, by dining here.   I feel like 3-star ratings are looked at as a subpar experience, but I beg to differ. Merriam-Webster's dictionary describes the phrase ""A-OK"" as ""very definitely OK."" Shuka most certainly fits this description.",13,9,8

We didn't have the time to enjoy each course at a reasonable pace before we were being rushed to make room on a very crowded table for more food. The most annoying thing though, was that the hostess kept circling the room with an iPad, clearly taking notes on how far along each table was. She came by 4 times (!) slowly pacing like a teacher while you are taking a test.  It took away a lot from the overall experience to feel so rushed and watched.

People hype it up, but there is better Mediterranean places in the area. The dips are OK, again overpriced and better elsewhere. The chicken skewers are fatty and undercooked.

It's on a cool street that was a bit quiet around 1pm on a Saturday, but upon entering we found that the party was definitely inside--the place was bustling. We were seated in the cool back area that is like a patio that has been roofed off from the elements (??? definitely a great use of space, in my opinion) that was smartly decorated.I knew before we arrived that I wanted to order the shakshuka, and my fiance got the chicken shawarma. We also got the beet hummus to share.  The service was really great--they offered us complimentary sparkling water right away (and a bonus, they left the carafe with us), asked if we would like more pita for the gigantic bowl of hummus (the pita was awesome by the way, warm and fluffy), and the meals came out very quickly. I will say that it's a little pricey (fine for the neighborhood, I guess) and our waitress tried to gently upsell us on something every time she came by, but I can't blame her for hustling. The shakshuka itself was PHENOMENAL! It was so delicious and I gobbled it down. It came topped with melty cheese, perfectly poached eggs, and crusty bread for dipping and scooping. The chicken shawarma was also on point (although I am not an expert), albeit a little difficult to eat, being that they serve it as kind of a flatbread (??? you should definitely use a fork and knife for this one, folks). I wanted to try the birds nest for dessert, but ended up leaving too full to even think about another bite.

Very friendly and helpful waitstaff. Our server did a great job describing dishes and the menu and ended up recommending our favorite dish of the evening. However, we were seated in a cramped corner and when I dropped my knife on the floor it took basically a 180 degrees full arm wave to get someone's attention despite maybe three servers seemingly looking around for someone to help out...Some of the dishes were total hits - the whipped feta and pistachio dip, for one. I could've eaten a pint of that one. The foul (fava bean) dip was bland and unexciting. Fattoush salad was flavorful, albeit a bit greasy. The rub on and sauces with the chicken shwarma kebabs were flavorful and interesting, but the chicken pieces felt a bit grizzly in parts. Overall, a really great mid-week dinner spot with gal-pals - fun, easy to get a reservations and tasty. Not mind-blowing, but would be very happy to return.",2,,

Yet somehow we were still waiting for our entrees well after the entire dining room filled up and was dining. We had waited about an hour when we inquired as to our order. The server noted she wondered too and then discovered the ticket hadn't been fired. She was strangely apathetic; perhaps it was because gratuity was included on our large group. When the food did arrive, I was only able to sample the shrimp kebab from our tasting menu as I'm a pescatarian. It did nothing for me.

I went to brunch with a friend; we split the $64 check and our server changed our $6 tips to $60 tips -- each! So he would have ended up with a $120 tip on a $64 meal. The service was fine, but not 200% tip good. Over a week since I first pointed this out to the restaurant, my credit card still hasn't been refunded for the fraudulent tip. At this point I've spent longer trying to correct what happened here than we enjoyed the actual meal. Dine at your own financial risk.",1,1,

Updated review","Came back last Thursday with my boyfriend for dinner date and everything was outstanding. They didn't have a bottle of wine we wanted but server offered us different bottle that was very nice. We had friend cheese again, artichoke app, grilled tuna and salad. The fried halluimi is a mast, so good and cooked perfectly. Artichokes were good but probably would not get it again the portion was quite small:( but still we enjoy it. We skipped the desert cause we were so full after amazing dinner. So glad it open next door and we will be frequent visitors.",,,
158,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,104,69,3.0,12/20/2017,"f.k.a. Hundred Acres, they've re-branded as SHUKA with a similar if not identical menu. Definitely order the kebabs and skip the larger plates. The kebabs and a couple of the appetizers are the much more 'fun' dishes, especially for sharing. The steak is perfectly seared and can be tastefully paired with the spices/sauces. Also the crispy cauliflower is a must try!Although, they're dubbed a Mediterranean restaurant, the food didn't feel nearly as healthy. If anything it was slightly on the richer and oily side.",,,

It was all delicious - if you like fried halloumi (they're huge chunks FYI) get that and the fatoush salad. But it's the same sized halloumi in both. My companion loved it and insisted on keeping both orders. Highly reco the whipped feta, even if you normally hate feta. It has none of the aftertaste  Lamb kebab was amazing and so big. Hence, we only had two bites of our mains before taking them home. That, and they had olive oil cake for dessert and had to have that too. Service was amazing. We've now had the same server twice and adore him. Tables were well spaced apart and you're not on top of each conversation.

Beet hummus was alright, but the texture wasn't really hummus-like so maybe my expectations were just a little different. Labne was good; highly recommend the feta and pistachio (really good). Chicken shawarma had a nice spicy flavor. It was my first time trying hallumi and I really liked it. Also fresh bread was really great.",,,
172,Lucie P.,"Manhattan, NY",11,17,129,4.0,9/20/2017,"I love all the restaurants in this group -  Cookshop, Vic's, Rosie's - and was really excited to see that they had reopened Hundred Acres as a Mediterranean restaurant (my fav dish there was Mediterranean inspired!). It seems still relatively unknown that a new restaurant has opened here. A friend and I walked in around 6:45pm on a Tuesday and were able to easily get a table. We ordered 5 dishes to share between the two of us: crispy cauliflower, whipped feta + pistachio, fried halloumi, tomatoes + peaches, and the boureka. Guys the fried halloumi is SO GOOD. Halloumi is a favorite among my friends but none of us have ever had it prepared like this. It's basically a glorified mozzarella stick but without any breading. Definitely get this. The rest of the dishes were super flavorful with great sauces. I think we ended up ordering a little heavy (crispy cauliflower is basically just battered and fried cauliflower florets, the fried halloumi as mentioned, and the boureka, which is in baked pastry) so in the future I'd try to balance that out a little more. Also wish they'd bring out more hot and fresh pita as the meal goes on; we got a couple pieces initially, one of which was warm and soft and the other which was crunchy (not as good for dipping). The price for the five dishes was under $50 between the two of us and we left feeling very full, definitely a good price for the area/quality and amount of food. Neither of us felt like drinking but did notice that they sell a pitcher of house red or white for only $18, so we'll certainly be getting that in the future. We also already have plans to come back for brunch this weekend with a larger group of friends!",1,,1

While the front room had at least five tables available, the back room was completely open, AND the back porch area was completely open, the maitre d' refused to sit my companion and myself as they were holding ALL of the tables for reservations beginning at 6:30.  It's surprising that this restaurant operates fully on reservations, but I guess they have it like that.

188,Gabi R.,"Manhattan, NY",7,81,4,3.0,10/22/2017,"Food: food was okay at best, no stand outs whatsoever.  Across a variety of mezze options, things weren't just sautéed, they were deep fried.  If you deep fry anything, it will always taste good -- it's our cave man instincts that can't say no.  The kebabs were delicious, but I could get equally delicious kebabs at my neighborhood family run kebab spot, without the mark up and glitz of an aspiring Manhattan scene. Also got the Tagine -- it was more of a shakshuka with lamb meatballs -- probably the must have of the menu, if you get past the appetizers.  Dessert game was too limited -- only one cake-like thing on the menu.  Short but interesting wine list -- that's probably the one thing differentiating this place from the neighborhood kebab jointService: waitress was sweet and friendly but the process wasn't polished.  E.g., after we waited for 15 min for dessert, it arrived with a candle in it for a birthday.. then as everyone was trying to pose with bday boy and candle, the waitress tried to set a table of dessert plates and forks, etc...unwittingly ruining the moment (though not intentionally).  The hostess was terrible -- last minute downsized our reservation from 4 to 3, then tried to blame it on one of us.  Fortunately, we were still seated soon enough, but still set us off on the wrong foot Ambience: restaurant is stunning.  It's like you've walked into North Africa.  Very very pretty",,,

It's tucked away in an adorable blue building, and the atmosphere inside is gorgeous. The menu is somewhat on the small side, but there is definitely something for everyone. Our waiter recommended trying something from each section of the menu (dips, kebabs, sides, and plates) so we ended up ordering the chicken shawarma, chicken kebab, Mediterranean plate, tahini fries, and Brussels sprouts for three people. Everything I tasted was better than the last. The Mediterranean plate is a great choice for groups, because it offers small samples of classics like falafel and hummus. We were absolutely stuffed after our meal, and probably could have fared well with one less item, but I'm so glad we made room for everything. Prices were very reasonable, totaling $77 for large portions in an area that tends to be more on the expensive side.

I'm not one to be cheap but if you ask me if I'd like another glass of wine while I'm still working on my first one I don't want you to pour into the same glass...anyway... really loved the halloumi.
