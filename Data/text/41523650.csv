0,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1509,3603,16292,5.0,10/12/2017,"I was fortunate to be invited as a guest to the New York Yacht Club for cocktails and I was just plan awe struck. As I approached the building I just couldn't believe my eyes. The architecture, as I later learned, was of a Beaux-Arts style, totally stunning with the windows vividly depicting the sterns of early day sailing ships overhanging a wavy sea. Then the interior, the most classic I've ever seen, can only be described as drop dead lavishly gorgeous. The fireplace has a mantel like piece bigger than life exuding the warmth of being in a classic club of the finest in tradition. The club is of course most famous for defending the America's Cup which it did successfully from 1870 to 1983; described as ""being the longest winning streak in history.""As I didn't eat here I can't comment upon the food but I can comment upon the Manhattan I had. It was done with a very good rye and garnished with real Maraschino wine soaked cherries; not those cheapo bright red faux done with a brine cherries you'll find in the typical grocery store. A darn good cocktail done in classic style and tradition. I can only say that if you are fortunate enough to have the chance of being invited, it's an invitation not to be overlooked.",7,4,7
1,Ruth Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,721,0,4.0,10/4/2017,"I too am not a member but was a guest of a member who entertained usat lunch, which was absolutely delicious, served by an expert, Keith,who makes all other servers I have look like amateurs.  The forragedmushroom soup was excellent.  I had little room for anything else.The exhibits in the Model Room must be seen to be believed,as well as the carpet which is, i think, the largest from a singleweave anywhere in the world.  You can just think of a 'magic' persian carpet. You have to be a member to dine here and you may run the riskof disquieting stares from 'real' members who do not 'cotton towomen who don't meet their notion of'appropriate age dressing.'But this happens even at bus stops, so........BTW the people at the entrance, not the checkroom but the frontdesk bent over backwards to helpfully provide subway information,which is really unique, as they are probably the only people inthe place who use the subway!  But thanks to them, a youngman was especially helpful.",1,1,1
2,Ryan H.,"Charleston, SC",616,707,822,5.0,8/17/2017,Very private club and we were happy to have been allowed to stay there as a guest of someone else.  August is offseason because they are all out at Newport at their other location sailing and enjoying being out of the hot city.  The restaurant and bar was closed  But we did not mind.  We took full advantage and were able to check out all the rooms in the place including the wonderful model room.  No pics allowed but trust me the place is incredible.  The architecture is so special and hard to describe but we just loved it.  Our room was small but was really very nice and the bed was super comfortable.  Just an elegant place and in a very well suited area of Manhatten near Times Square.  The desk clerk was about the only one working and he was wonderful and answered any question we had and provided anything we needed in a very timely manner.  We hope to come back again someday.,,,3
3,Liz S.,"Westfield, NJ",0,24,2,5.0,10/26/2016,"This place is first class. I just attended the National Historic Maritime Society dinner. The dining room is gorgeous and historical with thousands of model ships. The food was above and beyond what I expected. The 3 course dinner included a fancy salad with a cheese bread that was mouth watering, a perfectly cooked and seasoned steak with mushrooms, onions and broccoli rabe and a rum raisin dessert. I enjoyed every minute of being there and every bite!",,,
4,Plain White T.,"New York, NY",1,338,124,4.0,1/3/2015,I attended a formal catered event in the Model Room and had a great experience.  They served quality food that had nice presentation.  It is elegantly decorated throughout and has interesting artifacts that would please any Marine lover.,3,,
5,Ka Ning Y.,"Attleboro, MA",0,1,0,1.0,6/4/2015,"Thursday June 4th 2015 around 8pm. I didn't make it past the front lobby. My friend who was spending the night there forgot to tell me that I couldn't wear jeans. I should have known better. However, while informing the staff at the front desk that I was meeting a friend who is spending the night at NYYC, he proceeded to reply with ""you actually have a friend who can afford to stay here?"". After I gave him my friend's name, he found my friend's reservation and then told me about the ""no jeans policy"". I was wearing a dressy top with a cardigan and navy blue jeans topped with heels. Meanwhile he was letting in those who wore leggings and combat boots. I didn't realize that leggings are considered more dressy nowadays. Needless to say I'll never go back. I'd rather spend more money at Cornell Club who will accept me regardless of what I wear and won't be a jerk about it.",2,2,1
6,Anna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,337,22,4.0,3/1/2012,"Came here for an FCS Luncheon and while the food wasn't very impressive, the room was absolutely gorgeous!  We dined in the Model Room, which contains a magnificent collection of ""full and half hull models including a scale model history of all New York Yacht Club America's Cup challenges. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.""  The food and service was a solid four but I took off one star for the stuffy atmosphere.  What can you expect from an invitation only Yacht Club?",2,,
7,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",184,1504,174,5.0,5/22/2009,"We had a private dinner here for an organization I'm in. What a great choice of venue!The service was flawless, the food was amazing, the drinks were stiff but not overly so, and the decor/atmosphere was incredible.I had never been to a place like this before. It was pretty cool to be in a ""high society"" setting.",2,,1
8,J S.,"Washington, DC",0,32,2,1.0,2/2/2013,"Food was decent but the service was awful!!!  My dining partner didn't get any dressing with his salad and when we were finally able to flag a waiter, the waiter responded with, ""I'm not your waiter"" and then proceeded not to help us. 10 minutes later we found our guy.  Worst waitstaff on the island.",3,1,
9,Grace S.,"Zürich, Switzerland",304,441,1824,4.0,10/17/2010,"Love this place.  What a gorgeous venue!  Will upload photos of the Model Room soon!  We had dinner upstairs and the waiters/servers were quite nice except the head waiter.  The food was not very good for dinner but the hors d'oeuvres were great (mushroom pastries, tuna tartare w/ cucumber, pistacchio-encrusted lamb chops--delicious! but hard to eat standing up, crab cakes).  The chocolate cake was too thick, the salad had too much dressing on it, and the fish was tasteless and tough.  But still a lovely place to wine and dine!",2,,
10,Melissa S.,"San Antonio, TX",31,47,5,4.0,4/24/2009,"Because I am not a member of the NYYC I feel a little naughty writing a review, but hey I have been there, twice now - so here goes.  And out of interest, both visits were during weekday lunch in the Grill Room.It is very cool down there, probably one of the coolest restaurants I have been to in NY.  It's beautiful and couldn't be any more properly nautical without actually being on a yacht! My favorite part of the room was for sure the chiming clock on the half hours.  The service was impeccable and the food (in this case a med-well cheeseburger) was perfect.  Upstairs the Model Room steals the show of course, but that is not where we ate.  Four stars only, because well it is *slightly* stuffy, just a bit buttoned up for my comfort, I wouldn't want to have a few too many cocktails and let my hair down if you know what I mean - but perhaps that is not what it is meant to be about anyway.  If you're ever lucky enough to be invited, definitely go!",8,4,3
