The experience of feeling good vibes and positivity make their drinks taste amazing.This is the only place that I would get a Mango Dragon-fruit Refresher with a Raspberry Syrup.

Caren is such a wonderful manager and all of the employees are so professional. They greet customers by name and they know their drinks. Jamaar, Raphael, Merissa but really all the employees are so great!If you mobile order, they even put the straw in the drink. The sandwiches are always warmed to perfectly. I love coming here.",,,
2,Stefania A.,"Wantagh, NY",100,29,68,5.0,1/24/2018,I normally place my order at penn Starbucks when I get off the train but I decided to wait a bit longer. So I stopped here on 2nd ave. I did a walk-in order: venti Iced Espresso Classics - Skinny Caramel Macchiato with an extra shot (ice). And it came extremely fast with no issue and it came perfectly how I wanted it. I couldn't have been any more happier   The place is very neat and the workers were very friendly THANKS STARBUCKS!,1,,1

I have nothing negative to say; unlike - what seems the rest of the ""Cast of Characters"" that Kvetch who visit this place. You have no need for this behavior! - At least, that's based on my judgement! :-)Store was in an amazing location & was clean and stocked appropriately! I'm sure I'll return again soon!",1,,1

6,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1404,1149,1019,3.0,1/24/2018,"I   frequent this Starbucks and it's decent. It honestly depends who you have making your coffee because when you ask for a splash of milk it will either be an actual splash or 1/4 of your coffee cup, which can be frustrating. It is right near the Medical Center so it can be fairly busy during the early morning hours, however the line moves quickly for the most part. I   definitely would not come here to study, sprawl out my books and get work done. It isn't a cozy warm Starbucks, it's a get in and get out. Sure they have tables and areas to sit but people are constantly standing right in front of you while they wait on line for their coffee, it isn't really a conducive environment to getting work done in my opinion. They have your standard Starbucks food and drink, if they don't have bananas out, ask because likely they just haven't been put out yet for the day. They have a code on the bathroom, which you would think is a good thing because it keeps people who are not customers out, however the code is long, I   can never remember it and it still isn't the cleanest bathroom in the world. Overall, a decent place to stop to get in and get out, just reiterate what a splash of milk is if you only want a splash.",,,2

10,Benjamin Y.,"Manhattan, NY",42,112,24,3.0,6/3/2017,"Overall, average Starbucks. Coffee and food items are similar to other Starbucks in the city. And as a plus, this location is less crowded than average, and has large windows which give great lighting. It is also very clean. I am not sure if this is a change in corporate policy, but this Starbucks plays loud and clubby music - hip hop, R&B, house. As someone that loves to work and study in coffee shops, I find this disruptive. Starbucks used to play the soothing and relaxing coffee shop music, but this is not the case anymore. When I asked them nicely about music they said ""as long as there are no curse words, what's the problem"" despite the music being so loud and annoying as to disrupt me (and I'm sure many others on their laptops or reading a book). Perhaps this is the intention, to increase turnover, but it definitely makes it less pleasant to work here.",,,
11,Milton Y.,"South Glens Falls, NY",75,46,328,5.0,11/11/2017,This place is always jamming when I come here. They keep their cool no matter how busy it gets. The place is very clean and a lot of people like to hang out on their laptops and just kick it so it gets crowded. The staff is very friendly and the get it done. This is one of the better locations in the city. It get crowded but the line moves fast just hard to find a spot to hang out. I like the location on will be back.,,,
12,Josmanuel A.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",143,124,763,4.0,8/3/2017,Great Starbucks bar to get your coffee or drink. They are fast and have great customer service. They also have a large seating area with charging outlets to charge your phones or laptops/Tablets. I usually get the Strawberry Acai lemonade. I also order the cake box. I order this on the go from the Starbucks app. This is perfect the place to go before the movies or after. The amc is across the street.,,,2
13,Alfred N.,"Queens, NY",2708,219,1835,3.0,5/29/2017,Great location.  Perfect for picking up on the run cause it right off the bus stop or on the way to the train. The seating is different from majority of the location but I like it cause the seats have a lot of space and you are facing away from the streets so you are free from distractions.   The service is fast and as usual and they will make them with 100% satisfaction so that is why I am a return customer.,5,,3
14,Anthony S.,"Stamford, CT",4,44,1,2.0,11/11/2017,Definitely one of the dumpiest Starbucks I have been too. I am a frequent patron and long-time shareholder.  This is one SBUX I will not go to do any work at.  Just not attractive setup and backs to windows in awkward,,,

17,Teresa S.,"Forest Hills, NY",307,1125,2882,3.0,11/10/2014,I am a newbie starbucks customer and just started exploring different drinks and other small snacks they sell. This particular store happens to be close to my job when I feel like treating myself to a frapp or chai tea. The staff seem okay and not unfriendly but busy trying to tend to customers and they do keep the lines moving quick. Whenever I ask questions they answer and there are no attitudes.  I've only had one bad drink (salted caramel frapp was watery) from here but my first frapp (green tea caramel) experience was from this store and I've been hooked ever since. The stores is always clean and there's a few seats for you to sit and enjoy your drinks/goodies.,,,
18,Jay M.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",123,691,1384,3.0,7/9/2015,"I can't really complain about this branch. Yeah, it was busy this morning but that goes for other coffee/tea shops in the city. The baristas are friendly, as one other reviewer mentioned. Even with a lot of customers, the guy making my frapp was doing his best to keep calm even with a customer berating him for giving him the wrong sized latte, the line getting longer, and other customers asking him a question.There's a number of seats for you to just sit and hang out. Someone mentioned there's wifi but I didn't even bother to check. There are salads, sandwiches, and miscellaneous items in a chilled shelf if you're looking for a quick bite, too.",,,
19,Chris S.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,127,0,5.0,5/4/2017,"An enjoyable Starbucks, in my opinion.I visited here while in Manhattan for the day, and my experience was positive. The staff were fast with my order; the espresso was fresh, and as I'd specified; the dining room was clean, and comfortably sized. Likewise, the bathroom was well-maintained. All in all, the restaurant proved to be a good place to sip coffee and read a book (though, one improvement I would suggest is some cushioning on the back of the bench seats, which dug into my spine in a bad way).Much thanks to everyone who runs this restaurant. Keep up the good work :)",,,
20,Kevin D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,0,1.0,7/17/2016,"Funny I've  been to this Starbucks many times!  And spent more than is needed for a simple cup of coffee. Or more than needed for a mediocre cup of espresso filled with foam and  a dollop of cream. Yet when my wife walks in asking for a puppoccino off the Starbucks secret menu, she was told that the item she was asking for didn't exist!!! I wonder if paying these baristas extra for the same mediocre service is actually validated? Or do we just as a society need to just suck it up? If it's the later then shame on Starbucks for not training their staff properly! Btw :What is a PUPPUCCINO at Starbucks?One of the items on the Starbuckssecret menu, the Puppuccino is a small cup filled with whipped cream for your pup, a.k.a. all things good in this world. Next time you get that grande non-fat chai latte, treat your pup to the puppuccino!",,,
21,Seyoon K.,"Bayside, NY",0,25,5,3.0,2/20/2016,I only come to this location on Sundays. Baristas can be slow. A lot of sitting but there are many students with laptops who sit there for hours. Coffee is usual Starbucks coffee.,,,
22,Michael M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",232,35,2,3.0,2/20/2016,"It's your standard Starbucks with low traffic. I've come here a couple times and their service is fine. Drinks are consistent with other Starbucks I've been to. My only gripe about this location is that there is very little space to sit, and the seats that exist are not really comfortable. Basically the only seats available is the extended windowsill.If you need coffee on the go, then this is the place, but there are definitely better spots to stop and sit around.",,,
23,Grace Seoyeon Y.,"Flushing, NY",113,45,36,5.0,11/18/2016,"I always come here on the way to work to get breakfast. They have great varieties for breakfast (siggis, kind bar, bagel, etc). And the cashier here is so great!!! So friendly and quick to bring you your orders :)",,,

I would normally always go to the closest Starbucks to my office, but I decided the other day that I should go to the one closer to home and enjoy it on my way to work. This Starbucks is really quiet for a morning rush hour, but it makes sense because their location is really not a work neighborhood. They're efficient and so nice!!! I'll continue to visit this location and skip the long lines in the Starbucks closer to work. I recommend stopping by this location if you're in the neighborhood.",,,
25,Hilda D.,"New York, NY",12,123,231,4.0,6/7/2015,"I'm shock to read poor reviews on this starbucks, I find the baristas to be very friendly. In my personal experience( this is before i go to work), I found this place to be very fast and they serve the best chai tea latte (hot and cold). I have to say, there is an elementary and NYU school of medicine near, and I do see a crow of moms early in the morning,after dropping off their children ,grabbing their lattes . It is usually pack in the mornings and in the afternoons with students, but it is not so bad if you are in and out. Please note, despite the fact that they are busy, the baristas still manage to get the flow going....they deserve credit.",1,,
26,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,1.0,2/2/2013,"Kind of dirty looking and definitely not one of my favorite Starbucks locations. Only reason I was here is that I was close by while my girl was in the hospital for the day. Good thing I won't have to drop by this lame-fest again.Not much seating, narrow, and kind of grimy in here. Not too many spots to sit at overall save for a few tables and a strange bench seating area up against the front window across from the main counter area. Saw some outlets to use and most all of them were being taken over by wifi-hog staff and students coming over from NYU Hospital along with others just camping out at tables with no drinks. Would it also kill the staff to sweep up or wipe down a bit once in a while? Staff is kind of impersonal and on the slow side. There wasn't that many people even on line here and it seemed to drag on and on getting my drink. I didn't even bother to use the bathroom here.Someone who also posted here said it was the best Starbucks in Midtown East? Really? Really? LMAO!!!",7,5,5

Well, this one is a little special. Why? Well, it's staffed with a bunch of people who have absolutely no sense of customer service. I feel like all of them bring their personal problems to work. I have trouble making eye contact with some of them because I feel like if I ask for the wrong thing they're going to punch me in the face. This, along with the chronically-playing vulgar rap music, makes for a pretty crappy experience.",1,1,

Where was the SFV? Three, they overfilled my cup so they had to double cup my drink. So messy. That kinda quality doesn't pass. Four, they called frappuccinos, ""fraps."" Uhhh, no. Sorry for sounding like a pretentious b*tch, but this starbucks joint just....well, sucks.The only redeeming factor is that it's a pretty good study spot and it's a block away from my apartment.

35,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",453,537,935,3.0,10/29/2012,"One of the best SBUX in Midtown east when it comes to cleanliness and functionality.  In the midtown East area, this one of the easiest locations for students studying for exams, read a newspaper (not that anyone do that anymore), relax and enjoy a cup of coffee while waiting for their movie to start across the street at the Loews Kips Bay. This location is very quiet unlike most Starbucks located in main cross streets closer to 5th and 6th ave, but that might often be a byproduct of the neighborhood it is in. The staff is very nice. And having a long bench in the middle of the space adds a bit of uniqueness for this Starbucks location. Of course, putting your feet up on the bench is fun if nobody complains about it either.  In recent visits however, be mindful that there seems to have some ventilation issues as it can get a bit stuffy particularly if you are dressed for the cold outside.",,1,

It is currently 6:19am on a Sunday morning, a worker let another girl worker in and continues to indicate that the store is not open and locks the entrance. Who the hell am I supposed to report my concerns to if these people constantly report late to work so they don't open the doors in time for the hours they promise to open when they post the hours on their door. Definitely not pleased. It happens way too often to account for occasional tardiness. I hope their GM reads this review and cracks down on their employees' promptness to their shifts.",,,

Finally, I felt like he got it right... but either I was wrong, or the other guy (who was making the drinks) just didn't bother to read the order. I ordered an iced chocolate chai tea (which was right on the menu)... the guy who made my drink handed me a hot regular chai. I'm not one to make a fuss, and I like regular chai, so I didn't say anything and left.

Updated review","How many freaking times do I have to stand at the counter, only customer there, only to be ignored by the 2-3 staffers?? Holy shit is that aggravating. They don't even give you the courtesy of eye contact half the time or make even the most basic effort to communicate. No, ""one second, Ill be right with you"", or any basic acknowledgment of my presence in their establishment. It's happened multiple times.Is it really more important to fill up a napkin dispenser or hang out by the stock room than serve me a coffee?The last time I was there, this one girl stood right across from me behind the register, and restocked those stupid coffee cup sleeves into a basket without even acknowledging I was there. How obnoxious. How about taking my order? I'm sure the sleeves can wait 20 seconds while you pour a drink. I waited 5 minutes and walked out.

Maybe it was challenging bc I wanted it iced. You work @ Starbucks & you can't make a seasonal staple latte? What the hell else are you going to do with your life? Another time, a barista told me that my drink doesn't come with caramel, which is true, EXCEPT I ordered it with my drink. Frequent times, my drink is questioned ""Did you want it iced?"" I didn't say ""iced"" when I ordered it. Or I've ordered an iced drink & watch them grab a hot cup & proceed to write my order on it. Or my drink would be made without whip cream, which is included in the recipe. No whip cream? COME ON! That's the BEST part! Does it look like I need to diet?! One time, okay, maybe it was just a mind slip. Multiple times by multiple people? Someone is on crack.In fact, there is one guy here who has looked high as a kite everytime I've seen him.

Another lady with short hair was making drinks without a hat or a smile on her face. She was very unwelcoming and moody. A stark contrast to the cashier. She didn't make eye contact not once or thank me for my purchase. I won't be returning here until they get friendlier baristas that can make conversation with the customers instead of scare them off.

58,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1701,2743,655,2.0,6/14/2009,"Well, this place was packed during the various street festivals, but the place is small, quick to order with baristas taking orders directly for the people in line waiting to pay, and relaxing with a cup in the skinny store (there's always only a small area to sit at these places...).Green tea, quick and easy, and no problems, not too much ice, and a nice fast line. One of the better Starbucks, although not perfectly clean (tables sticky).",,1,
59,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,3.0,2/28/2011,I popped in here this morning while a coworker of mine was waiting at NYU Medical Center to get his blood-gushing hand stitched up.I got a venti Pike's and it tasted delicious as I stood in Room 4 and watched the doctor inject anesthetic into his wound. The caffeine was more than sufficient to last me through the entire 5-hour ordeal in the ER.Thumbs-up to this Starbucks for being a wonderful complement to an otherwise ho-hum scene of blood and carnage.,,2,

61,R J.,"New York, NY",1,2,0,1.0,10/21/2014,"Horrible service! You have to repeat your order 3-4 times, and they still get the drink wrong 50% of the time! I go to this location out of convenience, but I'm now done with this location.",1,,
62,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2243,478,2.0,6/4/2015,"this starbucks is one big joint compared to other locations i have visited in the past. but not to many seating options front , center and back unless you like a  bench across the front near from counter( strange). i was in area while doing a little time crushing while my niece and her friend were at kips bay movie theater. some more tables and chairs would be nice , but the front display counter was nicely stocked with goodies and i was able to use the wifi with the other hogs who will stay here for hours. the prices are typical starbucks with the usual pay a little more then other coffee houses. i went with a mocha frappaccino and lemon iced pound cake, not bad on both ends but place needs a little table cleaning here and there and would someone please sweep up a little. the folks who work here are pretty quick with orders and it was not that crowded on the line, so that helps. myself personally i would add more seating options and have a no hanging out playing with my laptop policy unless you order some drinks or food.i am giving two stars cause the pastries, salads, sandwiches , yogurts, etc are displayed nicely in large glass front counter, but minus three stars for  everything else.",6,4,6
63,Nicholas A.,"Sacramento, CA",86,281,172,3.0,6/26/2010,"One of the larger city locations, and has some of the friendlier baristas. I'm not so big on the minimal number of tables available; it's mostly bar seating.But I do like that they are organized enough to write your name on the cup still to make sure the drinks get to who they are intended for.",,1,
64,Amanda R.,"Staten Island, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/12/2014,"so I went to this location yesterday morning and as always the baristas were awesome! However, the woman with short brown hair was extremely rude and unwelcoming. She never made eye contact and she was not wearing her apron. She made the atmosphere feel/look very unprofessional.",,,
65,R M.,"New York, NY",1,50,6,1.0,2/26/2011,"MOST DISGUSTING BATHROOM EVER. In the history of pluming! If you want to see what's supposed to be inside the toilet outside the toilet, then by all means this is the place. Absolutely the worst bathroom. We told the manager who said someone was cleaning it. Which was a lie, since she had been hiding in an office until we asked to speak with her.",2,1,

Mainly because I caught myself enjoying their peppered bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. D&D, I'M SORRY! Dunkin Donuts will always be my first love. The one I'm comfortable with, we're soulmates.

69,alicia v.,"Hauppauge, NY",25,224,9,5.0,10/14/2005,"I know that obviously everyone knows all about Starbucks, but I feel the need to let everyone know that whatever you are doing right now, stop. Now get up and go to your nearest Starbucks and shell out four bucks for a soy pumpkin spice latte. I usually hate this place because it's so overpriced and the coffee is nothing special, but this drink is great. It really helps you get in the fall spirit. You should probably get it to go, so you don't have to sit among the hipsters that frequent Starbucks listening to their ipods and writing in their journals.p.s-i'm giving the drink five stars, not the establishment.",,,

71,Melissa P.,"Manhattan, NY",7,34,12,1.0,5/19/2012,"have to agree with other posters - this has to be the absolute worst starbucks in the city on all accounts. the tables, seats, and floors are always littered with used napkins and old sugar packets. fine if you are taking it to go, but seriously a depressing and gross cafe experience if you want to sit down and enjoy your drink. the baristas are ridiculously slow and can't even get the order right. if i wanted an iced skim caramel macchiato, i would've said ""iced"". there goes another 5 minutes of waiting for the correct drink.",1,1,
