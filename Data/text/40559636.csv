0,Amal A.,"Hoboken, NJ",16,56,223,5.0,7/26/2018,"The restaurant is inside the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. We arrived nearly at 9:30 and ordered food. The waitress got our bill while we were eating and told us to pay because they're closing the system as they don't take food orders after 9:40 and we were the last people to order food. I know it says it's open until 2 a.m. but it turns out that's only for the bar. Confusing, right?!Anyway, the flatbread pizza is a must when you visit this restaurant. It's light, crispy and so yummy. The marinara linguini lack a bit of seasoning.",1,,
1,Emily J.,"Memorial, Houston, TX",56,27,0,2.0,6/24/2018,"I feel like this restaurant is so close but yet so far. Missed on a lot of points. I got a $16 glass of wine (Italian) and it tasted like a $6 house wine. I used to sell wine so I know the difference and this was definitely a poor choice. My husband ordered a manhattan and said it was ""ok"". We then ordered the crispy rice balls  (aka arancini) and while the food was a 3 star level, i would I would negative points on presentation if i could.  The atmosphere was that of a diner. They definitely could have done with a dimmer. It would match the menu better. We ended up leaving after the app because we hadn't seen our waiter, had finished our drinks, and decided to go elsewhere.",1,,
2,Carol M.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",40,94,10,3.0,6/19/2018,"I am in NYC on a business trip, staying at the New Yorker Hotel, which also hosts Trattoria Bianca restaurant. I got in late. Love NYC, but was not in the mood to go very far - this is a work trip. So, after reading reviews, I chose to eat dinner here, at the hotel.Overall it was solidly good. I ordered a cup of minestrone soup, a dozen oysters on the half-shell, and an order of Broccoli Raab.  All the dishes were tasty, presented nicely, and reasonably priced for NYC. I also had a dry martini - which actually wasn't dry - points off for the martini being the worst part of the meal. Their menu is diverse enough to please a crowd also.The service was OK but nothing special. But, given a lot of other choices in the Times Square area, I recommend this place as a dependable solid choice.",2,,2

There are not many places near Penn Station better even worthy of happy hour, this place have great specials, awesome staff, but overall delicious food.

5,Ann N.,"Lansdale, PA",199,71,55,1.0,1/14/2018,"We were staying at the Wyndham New Yorker and thought it was super convenient to eat at the Italian restaurant in the lobby, but that's all it was- convenient.The venue is tight, all the seats and tables are close together so it's hard to maneuver yourself through the restaurant without dipping your purse into someone's meal. I felt bad for the wait staff and hostess, I noticed many rude customers. It was packed and there were only two servers between everyone. When we finally placed our order it didn't take long for our food to come out but the meals were disappointing. The bolognese was sour. Literally the sauce tasted like it was old and reheated multiple times. My boyfriend got the veal it was not veal. It looked like a chicken fried steak, super thin and battered which wasn't in the description and hidden behind some greens. It tasted old and spoiled. This was all super disappointing because out of our whole NYC trip, we were really excited for this reservation. The menu and pictures looked delicious but our meals tasted awful. I hope they hire more staff and have a word with the chef on how to prepare and serve food.",3,1,1
6,Caren T.,"Statesboro, GA",86,126,92,4.0,1/4/2018,"While we were waiting for our room to be available at The New Yorker Hotel, we decided to slip into the hotel's restaurant . Not expecting much (hotel restaurant, after all) we were pleasantly surprised. My chicken was excellent, and my partner enjoyed his pasta dish as well.  The wine was poured generously, which is always a plus in my book, and the service was prompt and friendly. My only small quibble was the cold bread, although I liked the garlicky white bean paste served with it.",1,,
7,Todd G.,"Great Neck, NY",0,8,0,5.0,10/31/2018,"I went here on Saturday 10/27/2018 with my wife and parents. I'm glad I made a reservation at it was busy but let me add that I was never rushed to finish up and leave. Let me start by saying a huge thank you to our server, Dimitri. He was personable, funny and full of excellent suggestions. We started with a bottle of wine and a Moscow mule. Drinks were perfect! We had bread with a bean/oil dip which was fantastic. My father had the chicken parmigiana, my mother had the fish and chips, my wife had the pan seared sea scallops with aside of mashed potatoes. I had a crabcakeAppetizer and on the suggestion of Dimitri I had the italian thin crust pizza.  Everyone's meal was perfect, so much so that my father even said that there was NO down point to the meal.  Since we were there to celebrate my parents anniversary and my mothers birthday, I was extremely pleased! We finished off with the chocolate ganache cake which was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! I understand that everyone has different experiences at restaurants but I'm definitely confused by the bad reviews. Trattoria Bianca exceeded all if my expectations. A huge thank you to them and to Dimitri for the amazing food we had for our Celebration!  WE WILL BE BACK FOR SURE!",,,
8,Evan P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,273,2,3.0,10/3/2017,"Good food!Bad service!Came here recently and was excited about the menu offerings. Looked like the best way to try a few things was with the prix fixe menu. Was told that it was offered ""every night except tonight"" - haha yeah sure!Anyway we tried a few things and everything was pretty good. The apps are definitely meant to be shared which was great. The main courses - chicken, veal were also quite good. And we even had dessert which was large and delicious! The service was poor. We were there over 2 hours, mostly ignored by staff. It was inconsistent though as we noticed another server who was very attentive and turning tables quickly. Our server was cold and disappeared for long periods of time.",3,,
9,Gaurav P.,"New York, NY",474,483,2226,3.0,3/5/2017,"TB is another spot we stumbled on near the Penn Station area by me colleagues and I, during our perpetual search for higher end establishments whether it be a bar, restaurant or combined. Enter, Trattoria Bianca - incredibly friendly servers, very solid and consistent food from their salads to their frittatas, both of which I've had many times. I've also had various chicken and steak dishes as well, both are solid, tasty, not overly salty and well executed. It meets all expectations and the restaurant is elegant, efficient and flexible. Bianca is a solid 3.5 Yelp joint and continues to meet our expectations without breaking the bank - it's nothing to write home about and nothing has knocked our socks off but again, solid and consistent establishments are needed in our society for success in food life.THIS has been a review by Gaurav",3,2,1
10,Seth H.,"Warwick, RI",62,88,9,3.0,3/22/2018,"Don't keep them waiting on them, they'll remind you that it's your turn to order. Sandwich was solid and they have a multitude of beverages to choose from the cooler.",1,,
11,Aysha S.,"New York, NY",474,66,16,4.0,1/25/2017,"If you're looking to burn some time waiting for a train at Penn, forget any of the bars there or Local or Lucy's. Trattoria Bianca is a block up and a nice, quiet, intimate place to catch a drink and some needed alone time. It's clean and the service was on point. Also, an interesting touch, there are mirrors in the bathrooms stalls (I can only speak to the women's). Helpful for adjusting that dress before you head out. Giving them four stars cause their happy hour ends at 6:30 (come on, I work!) and their garlic fries were mediocre. But I will come back when I've got some time to pass near Penn.",2,1,2
12,Dee C.,"River Vale, NJ",320,1008,363,1.0,7/23/2017,"Service was excellent Food horrific Bread - cold teetered on stale. Ordered from price fixed menu. Mixed green salad was just a handful, of salad from a bag.  Not even a tomato or slice of cucumber. Sea bass with arugula and brussel sprouts - not only was fish over cooked but it was trash worthy. When you cut away all the blood, skin and yuck you were left with MAYBE 1 oz of edible fish ( which was over cooked) I would N E V E R go back here.",1,2,2
13,Maulik M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",321,297,885,3.0,3/4/2017,"This restaurant is located off the lobby of the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. The restaurant menu was extensive with choices from Italian to steak to seafood. I had the lunch special of pasta with a side of salad. It came with the perfect seasoning and basil pesto sauce. Others with me had the Chicken parm, spaghetti, and Egg frittata. Everyone said their entrees were ok, nothing to rave about. I would recommend this restaurant for quick lunch while in busy midtown area. Very friendly and efficient service. Restaurant is clean and tasteful. All together, our group felt that the meal was neither good, nor bad, mostly nothing special. Relatively inexpensive lunch.",,,
14,Torie W.,"Queens, NY",235,251,545,3.0,7/21/2017,"Came here with a group and the host seemed a little frazzled once I mentioned the reservation but the service was good - not at all what I read below. The waitress followed up with if we needed more wine, other drinks, or snacks as well. The food was good. Try the deconstructed canoli! However, the salad was just lettuce and cheese. They should either add more to the salad salad or charge a reasonable price for it.",,,
15,Curtis M.,"Torrance, CA",134,31,15,4.0,6/22/2018,"Really enjoyed the traditional Greek salad. But I was expecting it to be a little bigger, as a dinner sized salad.",,,
16,Yoko T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/25/2018,"I had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. Despite making reservations, we were kept waiting by the door for close to 10 minutes and were basically ignored. After finally being seated, we had to wait even more to have our orders taken. The salad came quite quickly, but we were only halfway through our salad when our main dishes came, and the waiter was basically rushing us to eat our salad so that he could place the dishes on the table. When we tried to get our plates changed, the waiter was very curt and told us that we needed to ask the waitress for the plates because it wasn't his table, but this was basically impossible because the waitress was preoccupied with a large party sitting behind us. The server was very quick, however, to give us the check and to collect it. The service left a lot to be desired, and we felt very unwelcome in this establishment. The food was decent, but it was nothing special. I would not return to this restaurant again, and I feel that there are so better options near Penn Station.",,,
17,Genie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,379,1473,4.0,4/14/2017,"Just walking around city, the happy hour sign on sidewalk looked inviting.  We sat at bar and were totally impressed with the bar menu. If you are here for beer not too many choices one IPA, Stella, Perino and one more. The calendar was delicious not chewy, the marinara was flavorful.  The hummus and pita is perfect. Mashed white beans with olives and other seasoning. I want the recipe. The bartender was pleasant and did make suggestions. When I am in this area I shall stop in.",1,1,
18,Tanya D.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,241,60,3.0,10/25/2017,"My friend was staying in town for business, so I met him here as he was staying at the hotel. Decent place, good service. The bartender kept them coming. We shared fondue and sheperd's pie. Sheperd's pie was delicious. The fondue was alright - this was the first time in my life I allowed myself to try the dreaded gorgonzola cheese and I didn't die. We had half the sheperd's pie boxed up and lost it somewhere late in the evening, and I was sad when I woke up and it wasn't there. Hotel bar/restaurants are also just kind of hilarious. If you are ever feeling lonely, just go to one of those, you will make friends.",,1,

20,Prof. S.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,32,5,4.0,7/29/2017,"It's not easy to find a decent place to eat in the Penn Station area, so Trattoria Bianca is a nice surprise. We made an Open Table reservation here, as we were going to see a movie around the corner at the Loew's on 34th. We were seated promptly, the service was professional and pleasant, and the place is airy and comfortable with a good vibe. I'm sure we were the only non-tourists in the place, but so what?It was a hot, muggy NYC evening, so we opted to keep it light and simple: we shared a Caprese salad and a grilled shrimp Caesar salad. The shrimp in the Caesar were huge, perfectly grilled, and delish. My date ordered a few extra shrimp and that wasn't a problem (don't know how much they charged).When we asked for the check it was brought promptly and we got to the movie on time.So next time you're shopping at Macy's, seeing a movie at the Loew's, or catching a train at Penn Station, stop by Trattoria Bianca!",3,1,1
21,Annette B.,"NJ, NJ",46,8,0,3.0,5/10/2018,"The food was on the same level of average dinner food...nothing that would cause me to want to go back and somewhat decent to just consume and move on. Our waitress was unfriendly and seemed to have concluded we were not worth her time. I was particularly amused when our waitress, having with a thick Eastern European accent, corrected me on my pronunciation of the word ""latte"" by announcing it with a French accent. This place is a skip.",,,
22,Jeni S.,"Rockville, MD",6,195,500,4.0,9/22/2017,Tasty but pricey. Nice selections on the menu. Limited hours for a restaurant attached to a hotel in the middle of NYC. Nice that they will serve to the lobby though. Salads and soups are delicious. Fish and chips okay. Great sandwiches.,,,
23,Steven B.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,4,0,3.0,4/9/2018,"Good Italian food that tasted good and consistent in quality, taste and service. My office is around the corner at Penn Plaza the options are mostly fast food except a for a few gems. Location is good if you are near Herald Square or The Garden.",,,
24,William G.,"Minneapolis, MN",14,293,45,1.0,2/13/2018,"With all of the exceptional Italian eateries in NYC there is absolutely no reason to even consider dining at the Trattoria Bianca.  After my previous bad experiences in the Tick Tock Diner also in the New Yorker Hotel and the underwhelming reviews, I didn't expect much and my expectations were fulfilled.  I ended up there as part of a large group and we were limited to the fixed price menu.  I chose the chicken Marsala which came with a salad and desert. The salad was greens with a few tiny pieces of tomato.  A bottle of olive oil and a bottle of vinegar was provided so you could make a DIY dressing. I have never understood the reasoning behind this all to common practice as it is impossible to make a proper dressing without blending the oil and vinegar and it is impossible to properly dress a salad on a small plate without the proper utensils. The chicken Marsala was served with an insipid mushrooms sauce, fries, and a melange of what seemed to frozen mixed veggies. Why fries as this establishment advertises itself as a Trattoria - why not pasta? Desert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream straight from the supermarket.  I had a glass of generic red wine which was over $10. The entire bottle could not have cost more than $5.  Service was barely adequate and the wait staff was struggling with English to the extent it was difficult to understand them and vice versa. Don't eat here.",,,
25,Carolyn C.,"Ashland, OR",0,23,3,2.0,9/15/2017,Just walked in... didn't have high expectations and glad I didn't. Asked about the prix fixe menu at 7:20- was told I was too late even though it was supposed to run until 7:30. So I ordered the Bianco pizza instead- arugula/ prosciutto/onions. The four little pieces of prosciutto on the pie were on top of the arugula (I've never seen it served like this) and the crust was like cardboard. The service was lackluster but fine by NY standards....Keep walking to a dollar corner pizza joint!,,,
26,K D.,"Fairfield, CT",0,7,0,4.0,7/19/2018,"I am a foodie and this was a very nice lunch spot in an area that is scarce for good food choices. Nice service and tasty, beautifully prepared food. I enjoyed my lunch today in between my work meetings in the area.",,,
27,Nicole S.,"Freehold Township, NJ",1,47,22,4.0,3/23/2018,"Located through the lobby of the Wyndham or off of 8th ave, this place is basically right across from MSG. Food is good here, basically average Italian food in NYC. Did not blow my mind. The pork meatballs are not your classic Italian meatballs but ok. My friend had the scallops dish and thought it was the best she's ever had. If you're looking for a good meal though you can't go wrong here.",,,
28,Ross P.,"Katy, TX",17,69,7,1.0,6/20/2017,"Food was average, not enough seasoning and that is very hard to do for Italian food. Service was absolutely terrible. Took 15 min to get waited on when we were sat by the host, then another 10 to get our drinks, and they weren't alcoholic!  Never saw the waiter try and do anything for us mike fill the water glass or clear the table. Had to ask for the check twice and an easy meal at the hotel was 2 hours of torture. Don't bother.",,,

30,Ian D.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,10,0,2.0,6/28/2018,"We were at the restaurant on a Monday night at approx 6:30 PM.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice, very modern.  Service was very slow.  Our waiter was not attentive to us at all, even after telling him we were in a hurry because we were seeing a show.  Had only one glass of wine because he never came back to ask if we wanted another.  Never asked if we wanted Parm Cheese to put on the food either.  Food was not great.  Margarita Pizza was OK.  My wife had the salmon, she didn't like it at all.  In fact, she had indigestion all night from it.  I had the Chicken Parm, that was just OK also.  Considering there are so many choices to eat in NYC you would think they would have it right.",,,
31,Tyler D.,"Storrs, CT",0,17,0,1.0,9/22/2017,"The food was fine here (nothing to rave about), but the service was pretty terrible. Came here before  concert at MSG, and we were completely ignored throughout most of the meal. The table next to us came after us, yet got their food, drinks, and check well before us. It's a little ridiculous how we were treated here, it's as if they couldn't be bothered to interact with us. We will never be coming back here, and I recommend you think twice if you are a young couple.",1,,

34,June S.,"New York, NY",189,552,4070,3.0,8/6/2015,"We went for a lunch on a weekday, so there were lots of open tables. I feel like this is one of the hidden gem, as it serves good and affordable food, even though it is in the midtown. They offer lunch Pri Fixe Special ($13.95), which includes choice of appetizer & entree. That is a pretty good deal...The food was ok, nothing really special, other than their Sauteed Corn & Vegetable Chowder. This soup was really amazing!!!",,,
35,Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1615,1444,4566,3.0,4/16/2015,"Finding decent food around midtown for lunch can be difficult, especially when you're sick of Korean food from 32nd street. Knowing that Trattoria Bianca offered decent lunch specials, I was down. There is plenty of food to be shared, it's Italian after all. The squid ink pasta did not live up to my expectations. I did not taste any sea urchin butter, just regular butter. They had a decent amount of scallops, shrimp and clams though. They were in pretty big chunks too.Lobster rolls were pretty meh. Sure the portions of lobster is fair but it lacked flavor. The dish was bland. The wrap they used was pita bread? Dry and powdery which enforces the bland taste. I'd skip it if I were you. The minestrone soup was decent, a mix of kale and other greens. The soup was light. All in all 3 stars, food is passable but not fantastic just like its overall rating of 3.5.",1,,
36,Jessica H.,"Newport News, VA",26,126,215,3.0,3/28/2016,"This is located inside the New Yorker hotel.... That review will come later. This place is okay.. Yeah, okay is a good word. It's not terrible, but I don't think I'd have the desire to go back unless I was just exhausted and didn't want to leave the hotel for food. I got the beet salad, which was decent, a bit acidic, and oddly plated. Makes you think it's a whole plate of beet (which I would have loved!) but under the outer layer of beet was a mound of arugula. Which was fine but again, I wanted more beets. My son got gnocchi ... Basically gnocchi Mac and cheese it was pretty good. My husband soup looked and tasted like it had been sitting a while. He said the first bite tasted like it was a frozen soup, you know, that frozen soup taste, not the greatest. I think the biggest turn off was the scallops that passed by the table, I feel bad for who ever got those, nothing is supposed to smell that fishy, that's usually not a good sign.",1,,

44,KneeKnee M.,"Massapequa Park, NY",0,48,0,1.0,1/26/2017,"Do not bother, not worth it and service is horrendous! To say the customer service here is an absolute disgrace is an understatement. Please do not waste your time, or your hard earned cash on this joint. For the restaurant being half empty and only a party of two, we waited a solid 15 minutes for water. No exaggeration. When we finally got some bread on the table, it would of been helpful to have a bread plate but nope. Our waitress' name was Donna - and I only know that because that is what it said on my bill since she never introduced herself. She poured our water and asked what we would like to order. I asked her for a pasta recommendation to which she responded ""everything here is good""...I knew off the bat, Donna was in no mood to do her job. We order and sure enough, gone goes Donna not to be seen again until approximately 9:45pm when she decided to show face and proclaim she would be giving us our bill since the kitchen would now be closing. I never got a refill of my water, never ordered the glass of wine I desperately needed and never saw a dessert menu! To make matters worse, the bill suggests tipping 20%. Seriously? I am an adult, I do not need to be suggested a tip amount, and to be quite honest you are out of your mind to think I would come close to tipping 20%. Even better was at 10:20pm when another server decided to shut the lights off in the dining room and only keep the ones in the bar lit because ""well the bar can stay open until 1am"", you need a severe overhaul of your staff. They are rude and subpar. I will never return to this place, and I will ensure my experience is shared with as many NY'ers as possible.",2,,

48,La La J.,"New York, NY",1,153,39,3.0,3/29/2016,"This is a tough one. It's in the hotel so you don't see it immediately when you're looking for it outside. I liked the food - had the chicken parm. It was a large portion and the accompanying sauce and spaghetti were good. The service was also good. The ambiance reminded me of a very nice, updated diner. They have a dinner ""special"" that doesn't really seem like a special at all. You get the appetizer, main course and dessert, but if you want the steak for example, you have to add a lot more money to the special price. Why is that on the price fixe menu if the price isn't fixed?? Felt a little scammy...So the food was good, service was good, and it all came out pretty quickly. I just think there are far better options in the area for the price. Plus you get a better ambiance and more food choices.

50,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,4.0,11/6/2014,"Maybe should be 3 1/2 stars but I will round it up to 4.  In the new Wyndham New Yorker Hotel - Eighth Ave at 35th Street. Signage could be a bit better.  Enter at the corner of Eighth @ 35th or thru the hotel lobby.I really liked the room.  A long bar facing the windows along the Eighth Ave side.  Several four tops near the bar.  Floor to ceiling window looking out to the hotel lobby.  Banquettes and four tops in the L shaped area along the 35th Street side.White tablecloth place.  They swap out silverware between courses - a nice touch.  Background music - set a little too low - was Italian - mixed with a little New Age.  Our server today was fine.  She came around several times to pour our wine. A rather nice Prosecco. Food had it's ups and downs.  Bread came out with a dipping sauce of  canellini bean puree and roast red pepper puree with olive oll - very nice.  The vegetable frito misto - a combination of zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms and kale  - was very nice.  A small order was enough for two people. My guest had the spagetti carbonara; tasted fine; but the guanciale was roughly chopped and rather fatty.  I went with chicken piccata - very nice - with a side of spagetti marinara - seemed like the marinari was made in house - good.For dessert we had the Sicilian cassata - worth a trip - and the pear torte - looks great tasted OK - the pastry was not crisp.The place has been open a month so there is room to fine tune the menu.  But overall I was pleased and would stop by again.  The bar area is worth a stop for commuters before walking over to Penn Station.",6,1,1

If you are in the area and cant make your mind up, have seat here. The drinks are good, and everyone is pleasant.

Then I had the Salad Amalfi which was a Salade Nicoise with fresh Ahi tuna, and my husband had the vegetarian thin crust pizza.  Both were delicious and perfectly prepared.  For dessert we shared a dark chocolate mousse. Despite the fact that this was a pre Billy Joel Concert meal and the waitstaff and kitchen were working at peak capacity, our waiter was attentive and brought us refills of bread, hummus and water as needed without even being asked. The room did get a little too noisy, but that was in large part due to a group of 8 women seated next to us who seemed to think it was necessary to shout over each other!This is a great option for dinner before an MSG event.",1,,
59,Herb T.,"Levittown, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/15/2017,The menu online is a lie!  They promised $1 Oysters for Happy Hour and found out they are only on Monday's not everyday. The Pre-fix menu that changes daily evidently does not exist when there is an event at MSG. The server took 20 minutes to take our drink order (Long before the rush)! The waitress had to be tackled for a 2nd drink order which was left on the bar for 15 minutes. We had to ask the hostess to bring them which came in 2 stages 10 minutes later. The waitress did one pass when dinner was served (appetizer dishes still on the table). We wanted desserts and after dinner drinks but never saw our waitress! We left very unsatisfied!

With so many good options in NYC, why would you go here otherwise. Food: We ordered the Italian cured meats, cheeses, and fig jam.  It was mediocre, nothing special about the any of the items. My husband ordered the Bianca's special spaghetti carbonara. It was very very mediocre. My husband said my recipe is better and I will be the first to say I'm not the best cook (as evidenced by how much we eat out and Yelp!). Chicken parmigiana was also mediocre. Ambiance: Very cute ambiance. White tabecloth. Service: Amazing service. We had such a cute older Italian waiter.

66,James M.,"Astoria, NY",13,52,0,3.0,2/19/2015,"I was pleasantly surprised with Trattoria Bianca. We were searching for a sit-down restaurant to get pizza/pasta before a MSG event (parents insisted on no meat - Ash Wednesday), and there are slim pickings in that area. I found Trattoria on Yelp and was a bit hesitant because of some of the reviews I read, but we had quite a pleasant experience.My table started off with two pizzas, the white and margharita, and both were very tasty. These were probably the highlights of the meal for me. I ordered the pasta marinara for a main course, and it was fine, nothing special. I also tasted the seared tuna main course, which I wasn't particularly fond of, and the parpardella carbonarra sans bacon, which was pretty good. Service was friendly and fair. All in all, this is a good spot to come to before a Garden event if you're set on Italian food. If not, there are plenty of upscale pub-food type places nearby that I'd probably go to before here.",1,,

We finally catch a waiter and ask if we should just pick a table. We are told to wait for the ""hostess"" who was busy talking to other restaurant employees. She comes up grabs some menus and starts heading for a table without saying a word. We quietly follow. We sit for a good 10-15 minutes before asked what we would like to drink. The waiter was friendly and took our order. We had ordered calamari, garlic fries, salmon with mashed potatoes and a side of tomato soup. The salmon and mashed potatoes was pretty good and my husband enjoyed the tomato soup. The rest of the food was mediocre. The low rating is mostly for the service.

After that he never came back, someone else brought our drinks and we were never got our water refilled or asked if we were doing ok. After I order dinner with another server and asked for the check, the original waiter had the nerve to bring me the check and expected a tip I assumed. Any job is is great and if you excel at it even better, this guy has no business being a waiter in a restaurant that hosts so many tourists who pay the money to come here and to get such a shitty service.

Updated review","First of all, for me to write a review it would be really memorable- good or bad. This was is mixed since each experience ( eaten here twice since staying at the Wyndham) was different. Food is good! The Branzino and lamb were really good! Prefer the Branzino over the lamb... And the pizza (sausage and pepperoni) was yummy. The service the first night was great Jose. Then I mistakenly sat in a section with a new guy (Ryan) who was HORRIBLE!!! He knew nothing about the menu, over charged my bill and was angry when correcting him.  I mean really bad... Didn't clear my table, has to continuously ask for water...Must have been his first service job. He didn't even asked me if I wanted my leftovers boxed up. Wish I had gave a review yesterday. Would have been better. Jose waited in is and was wonderful! He gave recommendations and very helpful! Thank you Felix for cleaning up his mess. You and Jose deserve 4 stars!",,,

I ate here with my family a couple of weeks ago while we were on a quick weekend trip to NYC.We walked around for quite a bit before we settled on Trattoria Bianca which happened to be adjacent to our hotel the Wyndham New Yorker.  This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time!  They start you out with nice warm bread and this hummus like dip with olive oil..WOW! My sister, mother and I all had the prixe fixe three course dinner which came with a salad and really good Gelato for dessert.  My sister and I had the Filet Mignon with celery puree (melt in your mouth goodness) and my mother had the fish of the day which I believe was Halibut with Mussels which she enjoyed immensely. My fiance had the Salmon which he said was very good and this is coming from a man who is extremely picky when it comes to food. I would also like to mention this was one of the few places we ate in NYC that the wait staff actually talked to us and made us feel at home. Our waiter was a really sweet  older gentleman who made us laugh every time he came to the table!  It's NYC so I don't expect warm and fuzzy but personable is nice especially when you've been touring all day and want a good meal to replenish.

For our main courses we had the Salmon roasted with crispy celery root, hazelnuts and celery root puree. The salmon was cooked perfectly and I loved the flavors of the celery root and hazelnuts. We also had the pan-seared sea scallops with acorn squash, leeks, garlic which was also quite tasty. For dessert we had the warm pear tart and the chocolate mousse which were average.

Great portion sizes and clean food.",1,,
