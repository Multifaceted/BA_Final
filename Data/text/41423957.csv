0,Marie-Claire R.,"White Plains, NY",0,10,0.0,5.0,8/25/2018,"Rumbling tumby? Come on in to ""Bloom's Delicatessen Cafe""! A pleasant comfy restaurant with courteous waiters. Daniel, was very helpful and even gave me a sneak peak at what coffee they use. He helped me with the food choices as well. The smell made me hear bells. My food came out warm and tasty, with a perfect touch of coffee. I plan on coming to Bloom's more often and having the wonderful coffee. Enjoy  your trip to Bloom's Cafe. 212-867-FOOD",,,
1,Tori G.,"Syracuse, NY",4,126,206,4.0,10/18/2018,"Stopped in here for a quick breakfast one Saturday morning and the people were pleasant enough. We really did not order too much but what we did order came out pretty tasty. The bagel with lox was perfection and melted in your mouth. This was probably one of the best bagels with lox I have had. It actually makes me wish I had this place closer to my own home so I could get this exact menu item more frequently! Their coffee, Vassilaros, is a brand worth sticking around for that bottomless cup. It has a robust flavoring but is not over powering. This is the type of place that one could sit and enjoy the company of someone else and talk over coffee for hours. We liked this place so much that we came back here before we left the city to grab a piece of cheesecake to go. They make it fresh there daily and it did not disappoint.",,,
2,Melissa M.,"New York, NY",69,160,55,2.0,10/10/2018,"Years ago I used to work right near this place and we'd often have lunch here. I happened to be in the area recently with my mom and we opted to have some lunch. In my memory, I loved this place. This last time--meh not so much. Food was just ok. I love matzo ball soup. The matzo ball was cold on the inside and hard as a rock--that alone killed it for me. The fries we shared were good, and my mother enjoyed her burger. I don't ever need to come back again.",,,
3,Michael M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,15,5.0,3/4/2018,If you love New York it is your responsibility to come here at least twice! This place reminds my why NYC is or at least used to be the greatest They treated me like family and made me as good of a corned beef sandwich that I have ever had!,3,,2
4,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,4.0,6/10/2017,"There is no shortage of diners in NYC but having walked past Blooms everyday for over a year, I thought it was due its chanceWhat I really wanted was pancakes but they didn't seem to have any (despite the first yelp picture having pancakes in it...). Anyway, I went for the pastrami and corned beef omelet and I have to say it was superb. Service was only ok. It was perfectly friendly just there were times when it was lacking - there were points when the server was just chatting away with the hostess while I was trying to get a refill of my coffee. If you're in the area, I wouldn't hesitate in going (unless you really want pancakes)",1,,1
5,Thomas M.,"Chatham, NJ",43,9,1,1.0,10/24/2018,$25 for an awful sandwich and unpleasant service. Never again. Seriously I don't understand how they can charge these prices for this food quality.,,,
6,Caroline D.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,2.0,9/5/2018,Mediocre at best. Despite being packed food was raw to sour. I  would never come here again.,,,
7,Carly C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,14,231,4.0,5/5/2018,"Decent spot for gluten free eaters. Separate menu. For breakfast I've tried the gf Lumberjack Special with both French toast and pancakes, and French toast is the better option. They serve with powdered sugar unless otherwise specified. As with most places, the sausage was def mystery meat but would eat it again.",,,1
8,Ponchai R.,"Mansfield, TX",131,91,1402,4.0,2/3/2017,"While walking by I passed this place a couple of times while looking for a restaurant. It's lunchtime in NY and it's just madness everywhere. Finally after walking out from our first plan, we went to this place and it turned out to be unexpectedly very good. I had the Pastrami Burger in Kaiser Roll Bun. When they placed my burger in front of me I was in amazement how big the beef patty was. It looked ginormous, with Pastrami topped off on the burger. The Pastrami was the star. Just excellent I say. This heavyweight fighter of a sandwich did me halfway forcing me to take the other half to go. Way underrated restaurant in a hustle and bustle part of the corner. Looking for brunch?, good place for that too. Service is excellent and so are the Cole Slaw and Pickles. Good place to join in with the locals. Won't disappoint you with the vast menu items that is just lots and lots more to choose from.",9,4,4
9,Safania R.,"Baltimore, MD",181,10,2,3.0,8/26/2018,Just a normal breakfast place in NYC. I think there are better places than this. We just wanted something quick. I honestly think the food is cheap and good for the price. Not good for young people. Maybe for family is good. Not too sure if I would recommend this place to my friends but maybe for my family since it is affordable around the area.,,,
10,Nicky E.,"Boston, MA",205,356,208,2.0,7/12/2017,"I should have known better. We were in NYC, a place where there is a diversity of eateries and restaurants, but we were in a rush, and my Mum was craving a good deli sandwich, so we stopped here. The owner or manager was so sweet and friendly, but the food was almost inedible. We ordered a pastrami sandwich with fries, and to use my Mum's words, ""I've never seen a pastrami sandwich served like that"" (she didn't mean it in a positive way). We were starving, so we did actually consume the sandwich, but it was not particularly pleasant. The best part of the meal was the candy we took as we were leaving (honestly, it was a good candy).",1,1,1
11,Karen L.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,74,51,5.0,2/16/2018,"Stopped into Bloom's to get a quick take-out for breakfast as it was right across the street from our hotel. Ordered 2 egg sandwiches with cheese and tomato to go. Hard to believe that a simple egg sandwich could be worth writing about, but it was delicious! The woman at the register and the cook were both super friendly. The place was packed so I guess a lot of others like the place too. Highly recommend for a hearty breakfast.",,,1
12,Mary e.,"Miami, FL",129,231,110,3.0,2/26/2018,"Typically New York deli restaurant.  Warm and inviting ambience. My friend's breakfasts were great but my BLT was sad.  And at 13 bucks, very, very sad.  Service was spotty, except for the guy serving coffee who was awesome.  Note: don't order a BLT here.",,,

14,Brian M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",10,14,3,5.0,12/17/2017,"What a pleasant surprise to stumble upon Bloom's. Greeted by what I assume was the owner. Very accommodating to us and seated us almost immediately whilst be being cognizant of the fact that we had our 3 year old tagging along.Service was fast,efficient & friendly.Food was delicious with generous portions.Very well priced for NY.Definitely worth a visit.",1,,1
15,BelowZeroResident J.,"Jackson, WY",5,65,11,2.0,1/26/2018,"Good food, very expensive for what you get. I order gluten free whenever possible due to a cumulative intolerance. I got gluten free pancakes. The pancakes were a bit strange, not bad or good good to me. Kinda doughy and stretchy on the inside, while one had a nice crust to even it out, the others were a solid dough that sunk like a brick in my stomach. For the expense they could give a bit of real maple syrup instead of corn syrup crap by Kraft, but did have little packs of nice whipped sweet cream butter. Eggs cooked perfectly and were delicious. For close to $20 for 3 pancakes, 2 eggs and a coffee, I'd expect a bit better, but a decent place.",,,
16,Becca L.,"Shawnee, KS",1,8,1,4.0,7/4/2018,Probably one of the fastest breakfast experiences I've ever had at a sit down diner. We enjoyed it.,,,
17,Emmy H.,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom",0,13,15,3.0,2/13/2018,"not great..The chocolate chip and banana pancakes that I had were okay, but the rest was disappointing. The Greek yoghurt didn't appear to have fresh fruit - the strawberries looked old and the English muffin was drab. The staff weren't the most hospitable and the milk was not fresh, it was packeted heat treated stuff. For what you get it was very overpriced.",,,
18,Chrissy G.,"Elizabeth, NJ",84,72,74,1.0,4/28/2018,Was in NYC with my cousin who was from out of town visiting. Before we went in my cousins bought their favorite coffee across the street at Starbucks. We then planned to eat a huge breakfast at Blooms. As we walked into the establishment we were told we could not be seated because my cousins had Starbucks in their hands. Are they kidding me? Do they think their coffee can compete? Doubt it but I'm sure Starbucks wouldn't be able to compete with their breakfast which is why we were there. Shame on you. Have some confidence in your product.  We will never enter this diner.  Went to another diner and spent a lot of money. For the price of 2 cups of coffee you lost 4 customers = FOOLISH,,,1
19,Michielle F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,0,2.0,6/17/2018,"Below average. The hollandaise on the eggs Benedict was not good. The French toast was just like grilled bread, I don't think it had been dipped in egg batter at all. Even the bacon tasted reheated. I would not recommend.",,,
20,Eric C.,"Amherst, NH",0,1,0,1.0,12/28/2017,"I refuse to believe that this restaurant has the reviews that it has. I ordered a salad... as garnish I got a ROTTEN pepper.... I am not talking slight I am talking black... the lettuce was weeping...ect.... the person next to me got a nice hair in their sandwich. I would never trust a kitchen that puts out the food that this ""deli"" delivers. Service also bad.... ambivalent to problems.... for all those complaints which we provided evidence for we got our coffee off the bill... REALLY?Not the 17.95 + tax salad that i refused it eat... so many better delisAvoid... please....",,,
21,Kimberly D.,"San Antonio, TX",121,719,1322,4.0,1/17/2017,First time in NYC other than changing planes and I wanted a real NY deli sandwich. Bloom's did not disappoint. I ordered the hot pastrami sandwich with swiss cheese and cole slaw. I ate every.damn.bite. with no apologies and consumed way more pickles that I thought a person was capable of. The pastrami was so fresh and tender I think a tear slipped down my cheek. Seriously good stuff. The waitress was super friendly and even took a few minutes to talk to our group even though she was very busy.,2,1,2
22,Sammy G.,"Manhattan, NY",26,132,64,3.0,9/21/2017,"I stopped by for lunch yesterday and I've gotta say, it really is just an A-OK diner. The exterior definitely needs updating. The interior design seems extremely dated and everything felt a little sticky. The chair was sticky, table was sticky... Any ways, I ordered a deluxe burger (aka comes with fries) and an ice coffee. Coffee tasted stale for some reason. Drinkable though...just wasn't rich in its aroma. Burger was surprisingly decent. I like the meaty-ness of the patti and the cheese didn't taste like vaseline. Overall just an OK restaurant. I wouldn't recommend it nor bad mouth it.",,,
23,Marcy A.,"New York, NY",408,158,202,5.0,7/30/2017,"I picked up lunch here with my family because they had a gluten free menu. Although the meals are a little pricey, you get a large portion. The order process for pick up was easy and quick. I had the chicken salad avocado salad and it was very tasty. My parents ordered the turkey and corn beef sandwich on gluten free bread. They each enjoyed their meals.",,,
24,B-Mama D.,"New York, NY",0,66,2,1.0,2/28/2018,"Friend and I popped in because everything else nearby was full. This was, hands down, one of the worst lunches I have ever had. All the food around us looked questionable, so I ordered the safest thing I could think of - chicken tenders and fries. It was practically inedible. I don't think I've ever not been able to eat a fry before. Good job Blooms! Even the bowl of pickles they give you for the table were pretty gross. Oh - and it's hella expensive. Don't waste your time or money here.",,,

26,Sim S.,"East Bronx, NY",161,22,2,1.0,7/17/2016,"The eggs were scrambled and the poached eggs were poached perfectly!! Chef gets an A for that. (That's one of the stars)The mashed potatoes (closest thing to hash browns or home fries) seem to be made from the same powder you'd get in elementary school, or prison. The corned beef hash is made with those same potatoes. Clearly this shouldn't be called corned beef hash because they don't serve hash browns.The coffee was ok, better than the average diner.The service was not good. Water wasn't brought out until a second request halfway through eating.  Pushy staff seemed more interested in getting people in and out then taking care of their customers.In addition to sub-par food and service we were served coffee cream in a dirty glass (see pictures)I would eat here again if I just wanted eggs and French fries and there was an atomic bomb that destroyed all other restraints in Manhattan",2,,
27,George S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,52,2,4.0,12/12/2017,The food is over average for most of the dishes here and the service is very good they also remember local patrons and the prices are quite reasonable for this area.  They are also pretty good at dealing with  patrons requests for seating even in busy times.,,,
28,Harvey S.,"Bushwick, NY",0,5,0,1.0,6/5/2017,"I purchased a roast beef sandwich with cheese from Bloom's delicatessen. The sandwich came with a couple small pickles and a a small potato salad for $17.50++++Besides being shocked at the price I was informed if I wanted mayo, salt and pepper on my sandwich I would have to put it all on myself. Okay that's whatever but for $17.50?To grade my sandwich I'd give it a 2/5. It's relatively small, decent amount of meat, two slices of cheese, small piece of hero/wedge plain bread with no seeds or anything, and it's just relatively a boring sandwich. If the sandwich was $8-10 I wouldn't write this, but please don't enable such high over priced food. It perpetuates the problem of overpriced food in the city. Expensive and underperforming",,,
29,Sue G.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",1,3,0,1.0,11/26/2017,I'm trying to even give this place one star. Walked out and didn't pay when the tuna salad platter came out with rotten cucumbers and tuna 5 that wasn't made with white tuna and tasted old. Walked over the Sarge's on 3rd. Much better choice!,,,
30,Thuy V.,"Fairfax, VA",58,606,495,3.0,4/21/2016,"I think 3 stars is the right rating for this diner. It was close to our hotel and open early (or 24 hours?). Seemed to have several regular customers. We both had a combo with hash browns,  3 eggs, toast and drink. I had the corned beef hash which I thought was just ok. Husband had bacon which was ok. Thought it was a bit pricey for it all but again convenient to us.",,,1
31,Kate L.,"Chicago, IL",266,463,92,3.0,1/6/2016,"Three stars is right on the dot for this place. It's okay, but it's not anything great.I'd read about Bloom's being a great place for gluten free, so I put it on my list of must-visit restaurants during a trip to NYC. Yes, they have a gluten free menu, and yes, it is longer than most places. But the toast isn't anything special, and some of the cool stuff (like French toast and pancakes!) disappears after 11 am. I went with the omelette, as we'd arrived at 11:20 am, and was kind of disappointed at how flat and greasy it was. I think eggs beaters were used, not actual eggs. And I can name at least four brunch places back home in Chicago that can do omelettes better and cheaper. If you're seriously craving some gluten free toast, sure, stop by. But otherwise, for the money, you can find better breakfast options, gluten free or not.",1,1,1

38,Allegra S.,"Weymouth, MA",0,41,13,2.0,8/17/2017,"Sadly, this deli didn't meet my expectations. It's very nice to be greeted with a bowl of cole slaw and pickles--I love pickles--but these were tasteless. The cole slaw was similarly lackluster. I only bothered to take a few bites. The hot pastrami sandwich was good, but the rye bread was dry. The breakfasts people were eating at other tables looked more promising ... try one of those. The service was prompt and efficient. The prices are about what you'd expect in NYC: just under $20. for a sandwich and iced tea. I won't go back, even for breakfast. There are too many other places to try in the city.",,,

Had I known it was canned, I never would have ordered it. The potatoes had a lot on onions and green peppers (not everyone likes or can eat onions!). The pancakes, though fluffy, had a funky taste.

42,Robin M.,"Seattle, WA",40,250,22,1.0,3/29/2016,"This was by far the worst food we had while in NYC. The ""omelet"" was over-cooked flat unseasoned eggs that they apparently pre-cooked then stuffed to order and reheated. The cheddar was more like kraft cheese slices than real cheese.

It's atmosphere is simple family restaurant and the staff was very friendly. It wasn't busy as we went for and early dinner. The food was fantastic. I got a one if their specialties which was corned beef in between two homemade potato pancakes. It was delicious and huge. The corned beef was fresh and juicy and the potato pancakes were the best I've tried to date. My son got a cheeseburger that was possibly bigger than his head. It also was delicious. The burger was fresh and looked like it was freshly pressed as well. Not your typical frozen patty. It came with a ton of fresh cut fries as well. You will not leave here hungry!I think this place will now have to be a frequent stop when we head into the city. Excellent food and service.,,,

Updated review","Local diner more than anything else. It's pretty busy for breakfast. The food is eh.  The omelettes, French toast, pancakes are edible. The one think I found troubling is the no substitution rule or better yet we charge for everything on the side. Don't want hash browns with your omelette BECUASE it has onions or peppers, no problem, it 6$ for fruit or 1$ more for a slice of lettuce and tomato.  You want an English muffin instead of whole wheat toast oh yeah that's extra too. Please note they need to change their utensils as they are kinda gross and looked like they have been used and abused. My suggestion is - there is a diner right down the block. Try them and skip this joint. I'd pass and go else where you are treated as a guest not a hostile prisoner",,,
49,Jess R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,3/15/2017,Awesome spot with authentic New York food. Have the #43 hero sandwich - simple and delicious. Huge servings with hand cut fries and sides of great coleslaw and pickles. Highly recommended spot in midtown.,,,

The food was gross; they put my 2 dripping eggs overeasy on top of the pancakes causing the pancakes to be soggy, and the greasy grocery chain grade ham under the pancakes, making it even more soggy. The waiter was rude. When I asked for sugar-free syrup, he was quick to respond no even before I finished asking the question. A breakfast diner in NY with no sugar-free syrup - I think not. It was too early to argue so I let that go, but on my third bite, the waiter slams my check on the table and said ""take your time, whenever you're ready"" in a thick Hispanic accent.On my way out, I told a customer who just got seated to find another diner as I found the food & service to be way below standards.

We started passing around our food and started bugging out. The hot roast beef was greasy and had ZERO flavor. The cold roast beef was like two week old cold cut trash. The grilled chicken was overcooked and absolutely saturated with Rosemary and garlic. The turkey was dry and flavorless. My wife is foreign. Her comment on the salami was, ""is this sliced meatloaf?""I almost feel like giving this a 5 star just so everyone can experience the pain that we felt today (we are being clowny), but in absence of burning this place down, I'm leaving a 1 star review.

This failed at everything. I probably wasn't going to write a review but the fact my sister told them what her allergies were and she is now sick bothers me. I think it's because this place just lacks any attention to  cleanliness detail.  My water had floaters in it, the bathroom was just gross and the fact that we were given pickles on our table and then at the end of our meal, the remaining pickles went right back onto the shelf they came from ready for the next people that sat down is not a fun thought. The menus themselves were dirty and made me want to wash my hands after touching them but then i would have to wash my hands from being in the bathroom. The waiter had his thumb in the coleslaw he served me. Do I really need to go on?Just because you have a gluten menu doesn't mean that you should eat here. The lack of any kind of detail in the restaurant makes me believe there is a lack of detail in the kitchen. This also gets one star because the food just wasn't good. I am not g free but my Reuben sandwich was pretty blah. The salad was pretty boring and there wasn't anything redeeming here. And at 50 bucks for two people, I won't be coming back.

We were also asked if we will have separate checks or joint and then the waitress went on and on about how joint checks separated at the end affects accounting.4. You have to request to get a cup of water. Otherwise, they will let you die of thirst. 5.

One of the better fries I've ever had in the city. Can't beat fresh. The chocolate shake, eh, more like chocolate milk frothed up. I'd of preferred lemonade.

Just the way I like it, not too much, not too little. Pricing, not bad. I paid 18 for my order+tip, of course.

It was one of those places that I walk by often- it's on my way to my emergency mid-afternoon Dunkin' Donuts fix- so I figured I would give it a try. It looked like it had potential. Sadly, it's just kinda okay.I'm almost sure I got some sort of sausage sandwich, or philly cheesesteak deal. They give you a portion size for a horse, which I guess is nice if you're kind of hungry. I was, and I still ate what I feel like was too much. It's also not SUPER reasonable- I find myself comparing it to the 38th St. Diner in my head a lot. It's not as efficient or as cost-effective, but it's a nice option that's in another direction.The sandwich itself was good, but the bread was kinda eh... I wouldn't say no if you pass by this place and you're hungry, but I went in at lunch time and I remember it pretty much took forever. Might also not be the best place to go alone, as I did, but could be much better if you have a lunch companion or a small group. It's not terribly large inside and none of the staff was overtly friendly when I entered. Put it in the category of 'meh'",1,,

They treat you like cattle, squeeze you in so you can't breath, in and out is their motto. No quality. Their hot chocolate is from a pack (Swiss Miss?) you get the chocolate chunks and all because they don't even mix it right and don't care that they don't.

""Huh?, she asked.  I said, ""you know, does it come with side dishes like potatoes, etc?  Oh! She says, ""yes, potato and vegetable and stuff.""

I guess.So why the 4-star review?  This place drops a big bucket of pickles on the table at the beginning of the meal, along with a couple of little dishes of coleslaw.  The slaw is fine, but the pickles were ridiculous.  My crazy Russian mother used to make pickles from small, homegrown cucumbers when I was a kid, and I've never had anything like that since.  Blooms nailed it:  two types of fresh, bouncy dill pickles in the bucket, made with actual dill, and marinated for just long enough to make them sing--but not long enough to make them pallid and mushy.   Rare and amazing, at least for my taste.But then again, if you don't give a rat's ass about pickles, then I guess Blooms Cafe/Restaurant/Delicatessen is just another Midtown Cafe/Restaurant/Delicatessen.",1,1,

I commented why are my fries so much darker and dryer than my friend's fries. He then left for the kitchen and never returned! We paid for the check and left. Service was fine less the rude manager. In Murray Hill, there are so many other diners with much better food (breakfast is not terribly complicated to make). I would strongly advise against dining here.",,,

This isn't the four seasons - i would expect that at the four seasons, Not some mediocre deli in murry hill.",,,
177,Sloane W.,"Tenafly, NJ",6,81,0,3.0,7/26/2010,"At first glance Bloom's may seem like a kosher deli but its not...not even close. The fact that the menu lacks hot dogs is one indicator. The fact that bacon is readily available on anything is another. But this doesn't mean it's a bad restaurant. Most of the food, actually, is pretty good. But this is not where you go for an awesome pastrami sandwich or matzoh ball soup. This is where you go if you work or live in the area and want some upscale diner food, or if you're a tourist staying at one of the many nearby hotels. Ultimately, you can do a lot better than Bloom's with your buck.",,,

179,Edna C.,"New York, NY",129,372,137,1.0,2/7/2011,"this place gives me the chills.its not even a real ""diner"" so its not open 24/7--although it gives out  ""diner-like"" vibes. and, get this--when its breakfast time lets say 8am, they actually ONLY serve breakfast. ummmmm.....thats quite tricky. judging from that, you can tell i've tried dining here at 8pm and at 7am and was upset both times. yes 8pm they were closed and shut down.when i finally had a chance to eat here, i realized i should have just followed the clues & blaring neon signs telling me no. because the food outright sucks. i ordered mozzerella sticks and a potato pancake because really the menu sounds like a high school caferteria menu. not even a milkshake was available..i really wanted a frikkin milkshake. the sticks came out bland and awkward tasting---so was the marinara sauce. and the potato pancake was fried to a crisp and oozing with oil. yum. oh and get this they ran out of homefries at 11am on a sunday morning so we had to get normal fries. scottys down the block is a bajillion times better.",,,
