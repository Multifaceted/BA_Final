0,Delaney A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,1,4.0,9/6/2018,"Good and cheap! Comfort-style food. I got strawberry pancakes with bacon, chocolate milk, and OJ and it all costed $14 for such a large portion. My roommate got bagels and lox and loved it. Good service. Water was lukewarm and no AC, otherwise a great experience hidden in a little nook of town",,,
1,Gabriel N.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",130,337,875,3.0,8/7/2018,"Sometimes you just need diner food. Not vegan hipster fusion diner food. Not ultra expensive gourmet diner food. I'm talking about passable coffee, greasy plates with more food than plate, and an atmosphere that's seen better days. That is exactly the craving we had one morning and Pearl Street Diner filled that need perfectly.We swung by this tiny nugget of a place for a late breakfast. It was pretty packed which is always a good sign. We were quickly seated at a table in the very back of the place in this almost private pseudo-booth situation.Two cups of hot diner coffee and a bowl of pickles were placed in front of us while we looked over the menu. I miss being in places that serve pickles to nosh on. I settled on the pastrami and egg sandwich on a bagel (so-so choice) and my breakfast date picked the Wednesday special which was a meatball marinara sub with curly fries (far superior choice).The grub was good. The service was good. Everything was pretty good. Did it blow me away into another stratosphere of flavor? No. Did it meet the deep desire for diner food in cramped quarters? Absolutely.This is a place that I can easily see myself revisiting except next time I'm getting the daily special.",,1,

4,Cliff F.,"Bradenton, FL",0,20,11,3.0,10/20/2018,"A typical old diner with counter stools, worn booths and tables.  The staff is friendly but not on top of their game.  I needed to constantly remind the staff to do the basics.  I ordered coffee and a glass of water.  The coffee came but no water.  I asked if I could order and eventually someone came by for the order. The veggie omelette was overcooked, the potatoes hot and the rye toast was returned to add butter which they forgot.  I needed to ask for a coffee refill. However, the wait staff was on the ball in bringing the check.  The price was reasonable for the Financial District and is convenient.",,,
5,Ayanna F.,"New York, NY",115,75,10,1.0,5/11/2018,"This place wins the distinction of being one of the worst, yet more expensive, lunches I've ever had. When you walk in you assume that since no money has gone into the upkeep perhaps it's gone into good old fashioned cooking. You would be wrong!To start off we sat in the back and there was a clear smell of mouse droppings. They got an A but I have to assume that inspector got a hefty payoff.I got a turkey meatloaf sandwich, and it was clear that freezer burn had set in awhile ago, on top of being burnt on the grill. To top it off the patty itself was unrecognizable as meat and would have clearly been terrible even if it hadn't been abused. The bread was stale as well!Then I got mashed potatoes, which were lumpy, pasty and tasteless! It was as if salt or flavor couldn't adhere to it on a molecular level. As if this was flavor's kryptonite! I assume the potatoes were overcooked and sat in the water for 5 extra hours, then they were mashed in that same water. While most people would not recognize this as food at this point, I had the honor of paying $4 or $5 for it. On the bright side, there was a lot of it so you could take it home and use it for a construction project requiring spackling.$17 for all of this! Note: the ginger ale was Delicious",,,

I called when it reached 90 minutes and the guy that answered the phone was extremely rude and said it would take 20 more minutes. I said that's practically 2 hours. He proceeded to scream at me ""IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FOOD CALL SEAMLESS AND CANCEL!"" Well why don't you not accept orders if you can't deliver or change your delivery window to   120 mins so people know not to order from you!!",4,1,

8,Joe M.,"Beacon, NY",11,72,50,2.0,6/12/2017,"So last week I placed an order through Seamless for a hot Corned Beef sandwich with melted Swiss and an order of fries. The food arrived amazingly fast. I was surprised at how hot and fresh everything was. The sandwich could have been bigger for the price but it was excellent. I mean - really excellent. The meat was fresh, lean and tasty. It came with a whole dill pickle and a serving of slaw that was so small it wasn't worth the effort. Both the slaw and the pickle were nothing to write home about but the sandwich was so good it didn't matter. The fries were great. Krinkle-cut. Hot and crispy. Just perfect. The meal certainly took the sting out of eating at my desk during a late night at the office.  But then...The thought of that darned sandwich haunted me all weekend. I knew I'd have to do it again, and soon. Tonight I hit the replay button but ordered the Onion Soup instead of the fries. The whole thing was a huge let down. This time the Corned Beef was fatty and looked grey. The soup contained almost no liquid.  It was just a mass of onions that were overpowered by thyme. It was too nasty to eat. I'm not sure what my recommendation is for the Pearl Street Diner. Had I rushed to review after my first meal I might have lead someone to a culinary let-down. Was the first night the real Pearl Street Diner and tonight just an off night or was last week's excellent fare the oddity?  This is a first for me but I'll tell you what, go there and come back and let me know what YOU think. If I can write a Yelp review - so can you. Get the Corned Beef and give us the low down. I'll be waiting. I was going to give them 3 stars but I took one away for generating uncertainty as to whether I'd ever trust them again.",2,,1
9,Sam M.,"Mount Vernon, NY",415,10,0,5.0,6/30/2018,"Exactly what you need. Classic, old school diner. Food is good, cheap, and the service is fast. Decor is old but it adds to the charm. What you think or when you think diner. I especially enjoy coming in on a Saturday morning and sitting at the counter. The cook takes your order and hands you your food as it's ready. Highly recommend if you're in the area",1,,
10,Zach M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,4,1,1.0,5/11/2018,"I used to come here a lot. It was a middle of the road spot with good prices. Nothing special but has a good diner feel. Went this morning with two friends. My friend ordered two things for himself. I ordered something that was apparently only served during breakfast. Keep in mind it was 15 minutes after ""breakfast"" time. I didn't realize they locked up the eggs at 11.  So I just ordered coffee. Then my other friend just ordered coffee too. The server said we had to order $5 minimum per person. We said we didn't want anything. Then she just stood there waiting for us to order. She said the owner was sitting nearby if we wanted to talk to him. So we got up and went to talk to him. He backed up what the server said. So we left and will never be back. Horrible service. Especially to regular customers. If I could leave negative stars I would.",3,1,
11,Alex M.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,4,0,2.0,9/22/2018,"The food is just OK, but the service, in my experience, is terrible. They got my order wrong and by the time I received my group was pretty much done eating. To make it worse, they removed everyone's plates immediately making me feel like I needed to rush. Also, no apology for any of this. Repeatedly had to ask to get a glass of water, which really seemed to annoy them. And our waitress brought our check about five minutes after I received my food.",,,
12,Sara P.,"Dedham, MA",0,18,0,2.0,1/1/2018,"Always on the lookout for classic American diner breakfast joints. First off:  are they Pearl Street Diner or Pearl Diner?  It makes a difference when using GPS. The outside sign says ""Pearl Diner"".  The hats & t-shirts worn by the staff say ""Pearl Street Diner"".  Confusion reigns. I'll start with the good:  for Manhattan, the prices are good. 3 ppl, around $30 for full breakfast- that's hard to beat in the heart of NYC.The bad:  service was unorganized, disjointed, chaotic. Toast never delivered (picked it up from the counter myself, after waiting a long time - they never noticed). Lots of chaotic wait staff activity, but little actually getting done. The worse:  most of the food was somewhat below average (""tolerable"" comes to mind), but the bacon: inedible garbage. They've totally given up on bacon. They didn't even separate the slices when throwing on the grill. Presentation on bacon:  it looked spoiled & rotten: clumps of grease. Scrambled eggs:  didn't even bother to really scramble them actually (how lazy do you have to be?), resulting in clumps of yellow & white. No pride taken at all.  Toast: barely warm. Certainly not toasted in the least. Again, how little pride do you have to have to serve barely warm bread as toast?  On the plus side: real rye, not fake, like many other places. I'm willing to bet that 2 visits out of 5 would be better than this, but watch out for the other 3.",,,1
13,Justine G.,"Queens, New York, NY",48,6,1,1.0,9/16/2018,"Currently writing this review as I sit in this diner. I waited 15 minutes just to get a cup of water and order my food and I've been waiting for my food for 25 minutes. No one has updated us or came to check on us so WE had to ask, and we were told they're making the outgoing orders. So basically they don't care about the customers who are sitting here waiting for their food, but rather the ones who aren't even here. I wish I got up and left 30 minutes ago but now I might as well just wait. UPDATE I WALKED OUT !!!",,,
14,Dusty C.,"New York, NY",89,5,0,2.0,8/5/2018,This place went downhill. Used to come here all the time but it needs a good cleaning. It's just filthy.

15,Alison B.,"Queens, NY",312,28,16,2.0,10/30/2017,"After a night out, a group of us decided to come to the Pearl Street Diner as it seemed to be the closest diner to our hotels in the area. Definitely a classic looking dinner from the outside, it sits in a very unique location. The inside has a classic diner feel, but did not seem the most clean or organized.Since we were coming from our hotel and planned to head home after breakfast, we brought our bags with us. The manager noticed this and offered us a little nook to leave our bags in, which we were very thankful for. Service was not the best, and I wouldn't return for the food. They have a big menu and decent prices, but the food and service combined were just not good. It was difficult to get coffee/water refilled, and the breakfast food we ordered was rather bland. I'm usually not very picky, but something about this place just didn't seem right. For something quick and rather inexpensive, this place would do the job! Definitely worth it to spend a little more in the area for better quality food and service.",,,

The inside is small  but very cool and has authentic characterThe service is good and the wait staff is very personable.My wife and I love diners and have tried it 3 times hoping for a different result.We both order omelets and they were not good, even the toast was cold each time.

21,Scott S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,11/11/2017,"Pearl Street checks all the boxes of what, to me, make a perfect diner - except the service. The welcome is luke-warm at best. I waited ten minutes after being seated to be acknowledged, only to find that acknowledgement was an erroneous milkshake ordered to my table. Several minutes passed before I was noticed again. After finally ordering my meal was prepared and brought out at lightning speed. It was run of the mill greasy spoon diner food. No complaints there; I love diner fare. However, my check was brought with my food, only adding to the unwelcome air about the place. I didn't even get a refill of water before feeling rushed out. New customers entering were being turned away simultaneously (they close at 3pm; it was 2:20).The cherry on top is that I was stopped short of taking a photo of the classic 60's interior. No photos? I thought they must be kidding. The interior and setting is the only redeeming quality this place has. The food is a dime a dozen (for now, as diners and diner culture are in sharp decline in NYC).I really want to love this place and support diner culture, but after my third attempt I won't be going back to Pearl. Heart and soul is everything and this place has none.",2,1,1
22,Steph W.,"Weymouth, MA",0,26,21,2.0,7/12/2017,"Had breakfast only here - eggs over medium, rye toast, bacon. Decent sized portions. Home fries were good and had those nice crispy edges you like to get. Eggs seemed to have been done in too much oil? Toast didn't seem like it was actually toasted? Not sure what happened there but it was a strangely stiff texture. Bacon was meh. Great atmosphere, very friendly wait staff and seemed quite clean. They bring you OJ and water with your hot beverage of choice which is a very nice touch. I love diners so even though Yelpers didn't seem overly enthusiastic, I wanted to try it out. I've been to plenty of diners that do amazing food so it is possible to have better than this. I'm not sad that I went but wouldn't search it out to go again.",1,,

25,Nik R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,7,0,4.0,3/15/2018,"Only had the cheesecake (which was pretty standard diner fare) and a coffee, but this place is worth a visit just for the atmosphere and to patronize a piece of the past that should be kept alive.",,,
26,Tory L.,"Brooklyn, NY",295,365,886,3.0,8/10/2016,Standard but cool diner that is totally out of place in the midst of FIDi. Has that old school diner look. I believe its been there since 1967 and it still has that feel.  Service is solid and the staff is pretty friendly.  I ordered the special of French Dip sandwich and fries. The sandwich was ok. Steak meat with a lil provolone I think and a cup of relatively flavorless broth. The roll was nicely toasted. The fries are your standard issue diner fries and thats ok by me.  Another time I had the meat loaf and thought it was too salty.  Eggs and other diner fare are solid. This is the kinda place where the clientele are mostly cops and construction workers as there are 2 major projects just outside which makes for one noisy block.,4,2,2
27,Kayla S.,"Fremont, CA",155,10,7,1.0,1/3/2018,Terrible food and service. We only came here cause a friend that was with us recommended it. He regretted that decision shortly after we were greeted by our server. Nothing in this place is updated (clock on the wall is scotch taped just to get an idea). Just walking to the bathroom there were a ton of safety hazards that my boyfriend noticed. We watched a server almost trip on the unleveled floor. Save your time and money & go somewhere better... I wish I did.,,1,

Nestled in among FiDi's skyscrapers, the Diner looks like a throwback to a different era. And stepping inside, you definitely get the feeling the Yankees could be squaring off with the Brooklyn Dodgers in the Series this fall! Besides the atmosphere of yesteryear, the Pearl's kitchen serves up an awesome array of dishes from American ""comfort food"" to very on-trend salads and wraps. And of course, breakfast all day. All delicious, never disappointing. Come check it out for yourself, and you may just discover a new favorite!",,,

31,Brian G.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,7,0,1.0,12/14/2017,"This diner has decent food and gives off the atmosphere of a classic diner. However, the place is dirty with crumbs everywhere on several occasions. I have to ask my waitress to clean the table even after sitting down for several minutes. Staff is rude and not accommodating as well. I understand if certain requests can not be made but they need to learn people skills and how to respond to customers properly. They also assume orders and don't ask preferences. For example, I ordered an omelette with home-fries and I got an omelette with French fries. When I asked why I received French fries she says we ran out of breakfast potatoes. You don't tell customers this after you give them their food, you tell them when they first order. I don't recommend this place for almost anything ESPECIALLY for business.",,,

Inside its small, but just like a diner should be with its booths, formica tables and counter service. I've had breakfast and lunch here, I'm never disappointed.

He enjoyed it. They get A LOT of deliveries even for a Sunday. The cooks were quick. Maybe because of this there's so many bad reviews. The care of cooking diminishes when you have to hurry with the many orders. They have 2 bathrooms. I don't know about the size on the other one but the one I went to was SO SMALL and I'm petite!

Ordered corned hash meal, coffee, and apple pie.Coffee came first. Was decent. About what you might expect from a diner. Was attended for refills on a frequent basis.Eggs came over easy although I asked for scrambled. Wasn't too particularly concerned, since for being over easy, they were well made. Corned hash was decent, and potatoes were ok. Toast was a bit too dry(burnt?) for my tastes. Apple pie was cold. Not sure if that's the norm here, but I was definitely expecting a warm pie. Mediocre food, acceptable service, but the waitress was friendly. For the cost, a good meal. I wouldn't come here expecting a premium experience, but retains a great relaxed feel.

70,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,3.0,11/29/2012,"It's always nice to find a simple diner in the Financial District. ....Let me amend that by saying that Pearl Street Diner IS in a random area, off a random street with nothing else but car lots and forbidding building facades. Definitely still some city grunge remaining here.This old-school diner matches its grimy location, and not in a homey, cozy way. If a pristine space is a priority for you when eating, don't try Pearl Street Diner.  At 2:30pm, they were mopping the floors and dragging carpets around, and there were a couple of roving fruit flies. The food is normal, at normal diner prices. We got burgers from their long list of crazy burger styles - weren't asked how we wanted them cooked, and I was curious about the outcome, so I decided to stay silent. Both came back well-done. That's fine by me (I knowww, enjoying meat cooked through is such a faux pas!). The burgers were on the greasy side, nothing offensive but pretty average.They do take credit. And they have a dish of those crumbly old-fashioned mints by the register. The creatively named ""Diner"" is nearby on Nassau St., in a cleaner, cozier, environment for similar prices, so I don't think I'll be back here until I'm craving a grittier, pre-Giuliani atmosphere. Apparently Pearl Street Diner has been in business since the 60's? I hope they have their share of regulars, because the sticky floors scare me away!",5,3,3

The hostess was rude and pointed to our booth that had different color covers on the seats, both of which were ripped and looked filthy, rather than walking us over or even speaking to us. Our waitress came over and asked us for our order immediately, but it was hard to read the filthy menu. When my iced tea arrived, it tasted like it was brewed with dirt rather than tea. The food came over relatively quickly which was surprising, since it was over cooked. Eggs Benedict are suppose to be runny poached eggs, but they were delivered so hard that they seemed to be made of rubber. The hollandaise sauce tasted like it was made from one packet of mustard and one packet of mayo. Our waitress stood by our table listening to the host yell at her about other customers in a variety of Spanish and English, never once asking us if we need anything.

72,Tim C.,"New York, NY",264,150,0,4.0,10/16/2014,"I have to say that I love diners. It goes beyond the idea that you can get a good meal at a great price. It goes beyond the idea that diners have a wide menu where you can get breakfast 24 hours a day or salads, soups, pasta, meatloaf and other comfort foods.No for me a good diner is a throwback to a different era. An era that is rapidly disappearing in NYC. I can name a host of diners that have closed over the last few years. Cheyenne, Bendix, Empire, Diner 24 and on and on. It's the same thing effecting dive bars like the Holiday and Mars Bar. The gentrification of the city, everyone looking to live in fancy new towers and go to even fancier restaurants makes diners an endangered species.But just like in the movie Diner a diner is more than a place to eat. They used to unite NYC in ways that other cities didn't have. I can remember being in a diner late at night where sanitation workers were eating breakfast, club kids were getting their greasy food drunk fix and business men in suits and ties were getting something to eat while timing the late trains back to suburbia. the every man place to eat.Pearl Street harkens back to the diners of yore. The food is good solid diner food. The waitresses are efficient and of course in the best diner tradition assign you a nickname like Hon or Sweety upon ordering. I am partial to breakfast at all times of the day and theirs is good. Coffee is strong but not bitter. They don't have as extensive a menu as some diners but what they make they make well.The space is tight, tables close together, the counter is small but that also seems nostalgic.Don't come here to plan a murder you will be over heard.

Our annoyed waitress swore that EVERYTHING on the menu was absolutely delicious and I was forced to make a snap decision at the her insistence. Super busy lunch crowd and the place is extremely cramped so I guess they want as high of a turnover as possible, but man, I just really wanted like 2 minutes.When I got my chipotle chicken wrap, something I had deemed to be somewhat healthier, I was shocked to find it literally DRIPPING in grease. Furthermore, the chicken was dry and flavorless and the pepperjack cheese was only halfway melted and gross. I thought at least the fries would be fine cuz who can mess up fries, right?

Definitely a no-nonsense kinda place.The food is decent, but nothing to write home about. I got the lumberjack special. ~$9 for 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, and either bacon, sausage or ham. The pancakes were large and fluffy, the sausages was sub-par and the eggs were... eggs. All specials come with juice or coffee. The juice comes in what is pretty much the equivalent of a double shot glass, so you will likely be ordering a drink separately.Service is fine. They can customize your meal if the menu isn't to your liking. They are fast with the food, but were slow to bring out the check.

The redhead waitress was very warm, but the Spanish speaking blonde hair waitress is a hateful and spiteful woman who needs to find another job.

About half local Financial District dwellers and half local workers. Really good mix. Overall easy-going vibe. Food. Had coffee, english muffin and french toast. Listen, the food was good but not great - but was priced accordingly/fairly. Coffee is light roast, probably brewed medium-strength. Free refills (which feels anachronistic and thrilling). French toast was satisfactory. Nothing to write home about - but good. Location. I saw a few other reviewers somewhat putting down the location of this place - but I love it. If anything, the location assures that only people who are looking for or already know this place will be there. All the more for us. :) NOTE. They seem to advertise that they serve breakfast only - but have fries, hot dogs, burgers and spinach pie listed...Summary.

152,Soy L.,"Putnam County, NY",5,627,57,1.0,10/4/2014,"You won't find an oyster at the Pearl Diner.  Wait staff was inattentive and dumb.  My cheeseburger came out without cheese (mistake #1) and the waitress forgot to bring the corrected burger (mistake #2).  I had to go get it myself from the counter where is was sitting (mistake #3). The booth I was in had clear wrapping tape to keep the rips in the plastic from spreading.  The burger was just so-so and the fries had a funny taste.  The cheeseburger deluxe was $10.  The egg cream was heavy on the seltzer, not on the milk or syrup, a common problem at diners that do not care.  The yellow popcorn ceiling is ready to crash down on you and sadly, the neon sign is just about gone.  You almost have to try it this place to believe it.  Let me know what you think.",,,
153,Isaak L.,"South Orange, NJ",1,1,0,4.0,11/3/2010,"I went here for lunch a few days ago attracted by its old-timey look, a classic diner crammed in between glass and iron skyscrapers. Most eateries in this neighborhood lack character and are very similar to each other, but this place gave me a really good impression. The decor is classic and unpretentious, and the staff was easygoing and friendly.I ordered a double cheeseburger at the counter, and it was truly huge and quite tasty, all for about $9 (very honest price for NYC, especially in the financial district).It didn't strike me as the cleanest place, but frankly that is kind of part of its authentic atmosphere, and unless you are really picky, it should be fine.Thumbs up",,,

157,Britt N.,"New York, NY",5,13,1,4.0,2/6/2009,"I had my second experience in this diner today, during my lunch break at work. I enjoy this place, completely putting aside the fact that during rush hour it tends to become crowded. Here's a warning: if you are claustrophobic I don't suggest dining here.The waitresses are always in good spirits and they serve you as soon as you sit down. There is a hostess, but she is very quiet and timid and you can basically just walk by her without saying anything; but I think that is rude so I don't recommend that! Just tell her where you would prefer sitting and she directs you there without a problem.There are large booths for groups, and small, two-seated tables for couples. Usually you'll be surrounded by gel-slicked haired, trench coat wearing, Wall Street buffs, but don't worry about them; they mean no harm. They are just there for the same lucid reason you are, for the food!Today I ordered one of the many chefs' specials, that being a chicken wrap with a side of curly fries, and it was just delectable. If you want top-notch fries (especially sweet potato fries) then I recommend taking your lunch break at Pearl's. You can even watch as the chefs' prepare the meals you ordered, which I think is a good thing!",2,1,1

We walked it to a dingy looking diner, which i didn't mind to much had the ""old school"" look. The 1 waitress was nice but seemed rushed. We sat in a booth and the first thing I noticed was a little paper taped to the wall at each booth saying something like, please take the least amount of time to not keep people waiting. Okay it honestly turned me off and didn't make me feel to comfortable. Now to the food, I ordered 2 eggs bacon toast and home fries. My bf got the waffle and sausage. I'm one who likes my eggs cooked super well these eggs were still gooey so i had to pick around to find some that were cooked well. So that was a negative, bacon was okay and the sausage not to good. Wouldn't go back. Try the Squires dinner just a little further way, its much better and cheaper.",,,
165,Roger Y.,"Honolulu, HI",15,39,0,2.0,1/8/2007,"Oy to a Grecian BreakfastThe Pearl Street Diner beckons you from blocks away with it's period neon sign; especially effective in rainy or cold weather. The traditional-style Greek diner is a curio in the fast-changing Wall Street area and should maybe be appreciated before it's replaced by yet another Au Bon Pain. Unfortunately the eighties saw all of it's original interior surfaces covered over by solid grey formica or naugahyde, but one can easily look beyond that to discover its true essence. Beneath the ersatz skin lies the heart of old New York. Clues are in the undershirts clearly visible beneath the ironed white shirts of the waiters, the Knossic accents of the line chefs and the faint smell of Mennen Skin Bracer in the air.Food-wise, it is a old-style classic but be careful of what you wish for. My hash and eggs was a fair deal for Manhattan at $7. In addition to the main, I got a middling coffee, two slices of buttered toast with jam packet, a micro OJ, and fried potatoes on the side. Presentation was mannish, the eggs over easy as ordered but just barely. On the plate they looked like they had been roughhoused within an inch of their eggy lives. Potatoes were rustic with the overdone bits just barely outnumbering the underdone ones. CB hash was canned.I won't pass final judgment until the third or so visit and will hold off giving it a final drubbing for now. On the other hand I think this is a place you should go to before it and its kind disappears forever, not because of the food but for the experience. Oh, and don't go by the pictures when ordering.Two Uneven Stars",1,1,

The breakfast was pretty good.  We had the lumberjack , french toast and 2 coffees.  The portions aren't huge but good enough to fill us up.  The bill was just under $15 for both of us!!  I would go back again due to the location being within 5 minutes of our hotel....I will not travel far when I'm starved.",,,

(i don't mind chewy bacon, but this just wasn't cooked!)   And this last time they completely forgot one of  the orders.

169,Derrick R.,"New York, NY",1,7,0,1.0,3/17/2010,"I thought it was cool, with the whole retro 50's/60's diner look, but that is about it.  I suggested to my friend that we should ""try something new"". My famous last words for the day.  First of all, the seats are way too close together. This makes an annoying lunch with the person behind me constantly bumping into me.  Anyone getting up or moving around was uncomfortably close. I mean like ""junk in your face"" close.  I have to wonder why did they seat everyone so close together, especially since the diner was not crowded?  Anyway, thats small stuff.  Why do they get a 1 star? Can you say ""LIPSTICK ON THE COFFEE MUG""? DIS - GUS - TING.  I had to warn my friend who was about to drink off of it.  After the replacement coffee came, I tried a few of the old pickles the waitress dropped at our table.  Of course as luck would have it, I picked the magic pickle... I cant even describe the aftertaste...  The lemonade was OK, however I drank all of it (12oz cup, half filled with ice) trying to rid my mouth of the aftertaste of the pickle.  After several subtle attempts at trying to get the waitress' attention, I realized that there would be no refills on my lemonade or my friend's coffee.  I guess after the lipstick fiasco, it would be rather pointless to ask, ""Is everything OK?"".   The chicken parm I had was kind of bad. Not rotten or anything, just tasted bad. It had very little sauce, one slice of cheese, and was on a hero that made it look like some of the chicken was missing.  But I guess I shouldn't complain because it was on my table in less than 5 minutes.  Finally, lunch was over and the bill came. Wouldn't you know it? Adding insult to injury, they over charged us! It was good for a laugh, of course I've seen this behavior before. The waitress just vanished, so we figure why bother making a scene. If you need to make a few bucks like that then you need help.  Never again!",2,,

Pearl Street is a classic, old school diner, lots of chrome looking things, really just stuck down there in the Financial District next to a parking lot and a whole lot of depression. The grill is open, which I always enjoy watching people cook. The sausage is excellent of course, as is the breakfast. It has a sizeable menu. But the funniest thing was the reuben sandwich that gave my friend Nick immediate runs. He had to run all the way back to the dorm because he described it as, ""I didn't want to subject that diner, that tiny bathroom, to the horror that just occurred""Well I guess don't get the reuben.
