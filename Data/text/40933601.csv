Updated review","Update: went there for brunch. Much better menu. Still not harvest. But much improved since my first visit. I miss Harvest, the restaurant that used to be here. So maybe I'm holding this place to a higher standard. But the menu is very limited. There was no specials. $14 mixed drinks that came in champagne flutes. The food was slightly above average with portions below average. Overpriced for what you actually received. The staff were very nice but inexperienced. The temperature in the restaurant was too cold. I might try again in a year to see if they improve because I want them to be my new Harvest.",1,,
1,Michael B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,6,0,5.0,10/6/2018,"Took my wife to The Hill for her birthday and it exceeded all possible expectations - can not recommend enough.First, the facility is incredibly impressive, not only the dining room with floor to ceiling fireplace, but also the bar area with sleek high tops and a stunning wooden bar where I plan to come back soon to try the bar menu.Some favorites were the first course calamari, impeccably crisp and seasoned. The chorizo and octopus main course was also stellar. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about wine pairings and when she noticed that I was pairing each course by the glass she brought out an alternate pairing for me to try, saying I should see which one I preferred. She was of course correct and I switched to her Pinot Noir selection...that's solid service for New York City fine dining, and is outstanding for Bergen County.Since moving from the UWS two years ago we've felt that there weren't many true fine dining options in Bergen County - well, definitely add The Hill to that short list!",2,,1
2,Tom C.,"New York, NY",6,3,0,4.0,9/24/2018,Excellent - great atmosphere- great food.  Highly recommended.Getting a table was easy. Drinks and wine very good.  I had the scallops. My wife had the pork chop. Both excellent.,,,

Updated review","The Hill has hit its stride! I recently came back again for dinner and had several dishes that I was eager to try. The Duck appetizer was on top of my list. The flavors of this dish had the perfect balance of savory, salty and sweet. I paired it with a Pinot Noir based on the bartender Cory's recommendation and it was fantastic. For my entree I enjoyed the seared sea scallops and a side of crispy chickpea polenta. Both dishes were seasoned perfectly and they complemented each other. If you are a Vegan I highly recommend the Chickpea Polenta entree. I am so happy to have this restaurant in my neighborhood. I am also looking forward to trying their new brunch menu on Sundays, it looks amazing!",2,,2
4,Maridalia M.,"Dumont, NJ",0,9,0,3.0,10/17/2018,"This review is for the lounge area and bar menu. While the service was fantastic, nothing was seasoned. The gnocchi was bland, fish tacos were not great. Not even the calamari was good. Such a letdown.",2,,
5,Sandra D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,4.0,10/21/2018,"Went there two weeks ago on a Sunday. The Restaurant was not busy. We sat in the bar area where we could watch the Sunday Football. I love the decor, But it is kinda of got a cold feel when its empty.The food was light & delicious. Portions are on the small side. I do wish the menu was bigger. Service was casual but OK. Would be interested in going back when they have more to to choose from or if they open for lunch.",,,
6,Barry G.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/9/2018,"Highly recommend. Great food. Large portions. I had the calamari, steak and ice cream sandwich dessert. Well priced. Excellent service.",,,
7,bruce s.,"Englewood, NJ",33,403,16,3.0,9/16/2018,"Our debut visit to the long awaited, much anticipated new Bergen County restaurant, The Hill was last night and met with pleasant yet blasé, meh, lukewarm reception by myself and our party of four. Harvest always had a nice, warm vibe and The Hill refrehened the space a bit adding a more contemporary feel to the room. One very welcome factor is that unlike so many other restaurants, the noise level was very manageable despite the main dining room being full...far better than most other comparable places in the area or in the city. Server was pleasant and eager to please and service was quite nice. The tomato and ricotta salad was fresh and nicely prepared/beautifully plated. My pork chop however was uninspired...I've had far better pork chops elsewhere. It was on the dry side with barely any flavor. Our dessert of homemade ice cream sandwich was delicious. Even in the northeastern Bergen corridor up that way, not sure I see The Hill being differentiated from or superior to Locale, Sear or Dimora frankly.",,1,
8,Elizabeth A.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,11,0,2.0,11/4/2018,"Had dinner there last week. I really wanted to love this place. The chef has an outstanding reputation and I gave it plenty of time to work out the kinks before I came. Boy, was I disappointed. I was excited because I read a great review in a magazine last week and made plans to go the next night. Nothing was as mentioned in the review.The menu, for the price is pretty limited. We shared a lack luster tuna crudo and a gummy pumpkin risotto. For entrees I opted for the chicken, which was fine, but for 28 dollars was not much better than bringing home a roasted chicken from Fresh Market. The gnocchi on the side I ordered were underseasoned. My friend had the halibut that was more than a little over cooked. For the price, I really wanted to be wowed. Instead, I felt a little ripped off.Cocktails were great by the way. Service was affable, but I felt like they didn't notice our disappointment in the meal. There were maybe 10 full tables, so it isn't like they couldn't pay attention to us. I will try again, maybe in summer so I can sit outside on the amazing looking deck with fire pits.",,,
9,Diana F.,"Cresskill, NJ",0,5,0,3.0,10/28/2018,"Beautifully remodeled. Wood fireplace is replaced with a gas burning fireplace. Restaurant has a good happy hour (4:30-7; 10-till close). A number of drinks specially priced and there is a LIMITED bar menu. You can also order from main menu which is not extensive. I ordered grilled octopus entree which was PERFECT! My friend ordered linguine w/ clam sauce which lacked flavor. My biggest criticism is of staff, the vibe of the place. Figuratively, it's COLD in there. No effort to engage by bartending staff. All business. No repartee. Barkeeps meticulously measure each drop of alcohol that goes into each drink. Your  straight up martini is not filled to the rim. And since many drinks are $15+ dollars per drink it's a big negative. We ate at the bar and bartender completely forgot  to set our space. Mad rush as food approached to put down placemats and silverware and napkins. Also empty plates not promptly removed. No bread offered with the meal. Cappuccino very tasty. I know restaurant still in growing stage but there is no positive vibe emanating from the staff. THE most enthusiastic employee we met was the car valet: he told us the chef had been awarded a Michelin Star and he genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves. The inside staff could take a lesson from the valet.",,,

Updated review","Returned to The Hill last night, with another couple, and it was even better than our first visit.  The food was creative, delicious and excellently presented.  The waiter (Steve) couldn't have been better.  It was an entirely satisfying experience.  We'll look forward to our next visit.",,,
11,Angela M.,"Clifton, NJ",1,10,0,3.0,8/4/2018,"The food was good. We got asparagus risotto and calamari and then the swordfish special and the halibut. I have nothing bad to say about be food. Did it wow me? No, but wasn't bad. The atmosphere was odd. We showed up at 6pm to an empty restaurant with a 6:15 reservation but they didn't seat us until exactly 6:15. The restaurant was literally empty so not sure why they couldn't seat us. The staff, although eager to please, was inexperienced and pretentious. The dining room felt more like an office with plastic placemats and rod iron chairs. Lastly, the woman's bathroom doors didn't close which was unacceptable. If I'm going to a ""fine dining"" restaurant and spending $200, I expect to have a bathroom door that closes. The highlight of the evening was meeting the lovely valet man. Among the entire staff (waitress, bartender, hostess) he was the friendliest and most helpful.",2,,
12,Amy G.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,6,0,4.0,7/9/2018,"A little pricey -- But a FANTASTIC mealWe were super excited to try the new restaurant The Hill in Closter.  We arrived and found out that I made an error with the online reservation.  However, the staff was very accommodating, and sat us in the main dining room.We were a party of four.  The server was very attentive, and answered all of our questions.  Two of us got a cocktail -- vodka with grapefruit juice and seltzer from their signature menu.  It was delicious.  Of the four appetizers we ordered, everyone was thrilled.  My duck salad was amazing.  The chick pea salad and tuna appetizer were also hits. Entrees were equally good -- loved the sauce with the scallops.  My husband's halibut was like butter.  Dessert was a fair -- the ice cream on the ice cream sandwhich was not cold enough so it melted, leaving soggy cookies.  However, the stone fruit parfait was yummy.The bill was about $200/couple.  On the higher side for Bergen County, so definitely more of a special occasion place.  However, we will certainly be back!",4,,
13,Thomas B.,"Old Tappan, NJ",0,1,0,2.0,6/30/2018,"We had dinner there Sat night 6/30 at 8:45pm. The wait staff seemed inexperienced but eager to please. I had one of the better green salads that I've had in a long time. My wife really liked her chickpea salad too. We were enjoying it until the entrees were served. I had the grilled octopus, my wife had the scallops. The octopus itself was so salty it was inedible. I was thankful that the accompanying potato's were as bland as they were as they cut the salt in the octopus. The ""chorizo"" sausage was unrecognizable as sausage or anything else it was so bland. The best thing on the plate was the grilled scallions. My wife's scallops weren't as salty as my octopus was but they were a close second.I have to ask: is anyone tasting the food before it leaves the kitchen??? I refuse to believe that our dinner was made by a Michelin star chef. I really don't mind paying $125 for dinner, but when I do I want to enjoy it . . . and I did not enjoy this.",4,1,
14,Steve A.,"Tenafly, NJ",27,2,0,5.0,8/14/2018,"First let me start by saying this place is immaculate. When you first walk in you see the bar area which is beautiful and welcoming , sexy and unpretentious. They seated us right away. Staff was friendly . This place is a well needed trendy place in the area. Let's get to the food . The duck appetizer was cooked to perfection . The pork chop was big and definitely juicy . The manager greeted us and he was very humble and kind . Since it was a limited menu it was nice to be overwhelmed by too many choices and a smart move on behalf of owner. I had a great experience twice over. This will be my new go to place when I have tine to relax and enjoy nice dinners locally. I have a feeling this place is gonna be greater than great!!!",,,
15,Christopher D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,5,7,4.0,8/11/2018,"Great new spot in Closter. The decor is very modern but yet welcoming. The staff is extremely attentive and knowledgeable about all aspects of the food. And the drinks were tasty. Kudos to my bartender for an amazing Shanghai Sling. Now on to the food.  Unfortunately I don't know what happened to my pictures. So the first course I had an orecchiette pasta with fennel, rabbit and green olives in light broth.  It was Tender, rustic and found myself wanting more. For second course I had the grilled octopus and chorizo, my wife had the soft shell crabs. Both were delicious and not a spot left on our plates. My only complaint, which is a small one, are that the price point is little on the high side. Other than that definitely go check this place out!!!",,,
16,Allen R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,4.0,7/6/2018,Had dinner Thrusday.  Server was amazing. Explained limited new menu and set the tone.  We had octopus and halibut. Fresh tasted great  sides we ordered bok choy and shishito peppers excellent.  Brownie sundae to end   Chef Ben bravo great meal. GM mike Greenberg,1,1,
17,Meg B.,"Westwood, NJ",0,3,0,2.0,7/1/2018,"My husband and ate here on Saturday night. The green salad and chick pea salads were both delicious. Our entrees unfortunately were not. The scallops were prepared nicely except they were way too salty. This is coming from a person who is a heavy salter!  My husband had the octopus which was also too salty plus had a very unpleasant flavor. I took one taste and had to eat something else to clear my palate. We mentioned that the entrees were too salty and the that the octopus didn't taste good to the waitress. She conveyed the message to the manager. She collected our check and hoped that we would give it another chance. They didn't even do the right thing!One thing for sure, no Michelin rated chef made those dishes. Not sure who is doing the cooking. So disappointing.",1,,1
18,Karen M.,"Norwood, NJ",0,2,0,2.0,6/27/2018,It was ok.  I expected more from this place and this chef. The menu is too simple rather expensive and the food is just ok.  No real wow flavors or preparations.  The service was good. The servers are attentive and try.    But there are lingering questions about decisions. Why is bread served without olive oil or butter unless requested?  Why don't all entrees have a starch?  The only additional sides are bok choy or roasted peppers.  Why were we told we needed to sit in the bar in a Wednesday evening when the dining room was empty at 6:30 and two tops remained empty until we left at 8:00.  The hostess did let us sit in the dining room when I balked at sitting in the bar. I and I think most of Bergen County has been eagerly waiting for this restaurant to open but it's offering will have to improve if it is to succeed.,,,
19,Jane P.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,7/13/2018,I love this place. The food is excellent This is a five star restaurant The restaurant is beautiful . The chef accommodated. My difficult food restrictions  we not a problem. The staff was extremely accommodating. The  Salad was great and the scallops were cooked to perfection. I hope to have my 60th Birthday party here .,,,
20,Kevin C.,"Westwood, NJ",1,1,0,1.0,8/11/2018,"Overall impression - eh (shoulder shrug).My wife, three children and I went for dinner with high hopes. We were disappointed.Food was adequate, but nothing stood out. Our starters were the gazpacho, calamari, pasta with rabbit, sea bass crudo and shrimp cocktail. No one had a comment, good or bad, about the dishes. That's not a good sign with my family. For dinner we had two orders of the scallops, octopus/chorizo, ny strip and roast chicken. NY Strip was not good, one order of scallops went uneaten as they had no flavor and the chorizo took away from the octopus.For desert we went elsewhere as the menu was not appealing to any of us.Service was ok, and the reason was our wine was kept on the other side of the dining room. I've never seen that before, and it made no sense. We were having a white with our appetizers, and planned on ordering a red with dinner. But since the wine was unavailable to us, we barely finished the white before paying the check.We may go back for a second try, everyone can have a bad night, but are not rushing to get there.",1,,1
21,Jillian D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,5,0,1.0,6/23/2018,"The worst service we have ever had. The food, although good- portions are VERY small. We never actually received our main courses after waiting 45 minutes after finishing our appitizers. The excuse that was made for the wait was poor. No apologies were given- after waiting another 10 minutes we ended up walking out. Our drinks were never refilled, no one came up to us and asked how is was. Just little things you expect when you are paying $30+ for an entree. Atmospher is too much of an open concept- you can barely hear. Nothing was warm and welcoming about the place. Do not waste your money",3,,
22,Kristin M.,"Norwood, NJ",0,2,0,3.0,6/19/2018,Food on the soft open was definitely over priced. Manhattan prices without the delivery. Service was ok. Food for the most part was good but I'd rather go to NYC for the price. After $600+ spent for 4 people it would have been nice for a buy back. Not sure I would return. Not a good fit for the area.,3,,
23,Slap L.,"Warwick, NY",2,3,0,5.0,7/13/2018,"This place is a great addition to the area. Food was fantastic, love the drinks and desert. Service was wonderful, a must try in Bergen County! Need more restaurants like this one!",,,
24,Debra L.,"Township of Washington, NJ",0,10,0,5.0,6/24/2018,My sister and I went for dinner. It was beyond delicious. We had the risotto and the tuna appetizer. Both were great. The scallops for dinner were remarkable. Servers was very good and attentive. The manger checked in.  After dinner we sat on the patio for-just one more drink. As outdoor fans-we loved the space. Looking forward to returning for a night out with husbands.,2,,
25,Judy J.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,2,0,4.0,7/15/2018,"Food is absolutely delicious, especially the octopus entree. Menu items are meticulously prepared and the taste combinations are perfection. Staff was pleasant, attentive and welcoming. Terrific experience! A must-try!",,,
26,Michelle G.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,6/30/2018,"Had a great dinner. Food was delicious with a unique menu, something different in the area. The restaurant was renovated beautifully, very comfortable and friendly atmosphere. The wait staff and general manager were attentive and very helpful with questions. Definitely a place to come and check out. Looking forward to returning with friends and family.",,,
27,David H.,"Mount Hope, KS",0,1,0,2.0,6/30/2018,"Went there last night for dinner with friends. I felt like a beta tester who paid through the nose for a half baked experience.  The prices are NYC prices with service that is very subpar. Attentenive service is not what we received.  While I can tell a lot went into the thought behind the restaurant, I will only revisit if they are able to work out the kinks, especially in the service department.",,,
