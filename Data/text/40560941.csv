Be warned though, if you are a very tall person, the seating can be a bit cramped for your knees.      The cast is terrific and very, very funny.  Their timing is excellent and they keep you guessing and laughing for over two hours.      The play includes every possible snafu you've ever experienced in community theatre from the stage frightened actor to the stage hog and the actor who muffs his lines to the flimsy scenery that falls apart.  This is a real laugh riot and one of the most enjoyable plays I've every seen.     There is some interaction with the cast if you are seated near the front, so get ready for your Broadway debut, especially if you are on the aisle.",

2,,11/19/2018,31,,"Santa Clara, CA",Sedina A.,0,1.0,6,"Just saw the Play that Goes Wrong here. The show was great, but the usher on the balcony was terrible and is the reason for this review. When we arrived, he told us to sit in seats he knew were not our tickets. As the show was about to start, I noticed these could not possibly be our seats. Our seats were in the center of the section, and he had seated us on the aisle. The view was much worse due to a bar blocking the front of the stage in that position. I had purposely chose the seats on my ticket, and he hadn't bothered to make sure we got them. I pointed this out to him at intermission and asked if it was a ticketing error. He said he would check tickets, but only stopped by briefly and one person moved over. Not enough that we could sit in the seats I actually bought still, and we were a group of two. If you aren't here to do literally your only job I can't imagine why you are here.",

Moreover, the $30 rush tickets were fairly easy to obtain providing you show up at least an hour before the box office opens, you're prepared to stand in the cold (the day I went was 35°F so I wore my warmest jacket, brought hand warmers, and a hot beverage), and you don't mind front row right-in-front-of-the-stage seating. Because my seat was the front row all the way on the end stage right, I quite liked my seat because much of the activity was stage left and a stage left balcony plus I had room at my feet where I could lay my jacket down.For me, the play wasn't laugh out loud funny, but I was entertained nonetheless and recommend this light-hearted play for any age.",3

I was there with my daughter (14) because her school offered the show as part of their travel club. My daughter and her friend were bored, they didn't seem to be overly interested in it.

13,6,4/6/2016,848,5,"Middle Village, NY",Maggie Z.,730,2.0,301,"I had the fortunate of coming here Tuesday night with complimentary tickets to see the well loved Broadway production, Fully Committed. Though the show itself was absolutely fabulous with one person, star from Modern Family, playing a shocking 41 roles, I could not say the same for the theater itself. The outside of this place is just a mess.. honestly. There is no fancy lobby that you would imagine a Broadway theater to have, instead it's kind of crowded. Well, okay-- let me describe the whole experience to you. There's a bouncer type of guy in the front who of course, checks your bag to make sure there's nothing dangerous or prohibited that you're bringing in which is fine. He wasn't very kind about it though, more rude and intimidating if anything. The ticket usher was also indifferent. My seat was upstairs, and to get to the stairs I had to squeeze between the tiny space of the usher and the wall.. really. They need to fix this set up. While people who get to sit on the main floor have this huge, but not grand, entrance. The seating itself is very intimate and not in a way that's enjoyable. Who wants to sit through a practically 2 hours, and in some cases more, show without being able to take off your jacket and having your bag on your lap.. not enough space to cross your legs or even spread them (fairly) if you're a guy? It was very uncomfortable and the hand rest situation needs to be fixed because.. well, I guess this will always be a problem won't it? But, when someone uses your handrest, they are practically prowling over your seat which is not okay. My seat all the way at the top was okay, I could still see everything and the sound system is fine. I didn't really have a problem with this..",12
14,,6/8/2016,218,,"Dallas, TX",Stephen W.,2022,4.0,1316,"We went to see a production here (Fully Committed) and really enjoyed it. The production itself is consistently entertaining and witty but not laugh out loud for most of it, or at least I thought so. The theater is not too big so every seat is good. We were in the orchestra section, row 5, so we were very pleased with our seat. The theater has tons of history and character which adds to the fun. I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 for two reasons. First, the sound system needs some work or maybe the volume just needs to be turned up a bit. Second, the price of drinks is ridiculous. The wife got a glass of wine and I ordered a bottle of beer and the bill was $38. Sure, we got a cup that can be reused, but even so, I cannot figure out the math how two drinks could cost so much. My recommendation is to drink first or just wait. That said, it's a fun place to see a Broadway production.",3
15,,6/17/2018,1,,"Sparta Township, NJ",Darlene L.,80,4.0,22,"this review is about the theater and not the show.  I went back to this theater to see 'THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG' for a second time and took my two daughters. This time from the cheaper balcony seats. Since there is no elevator, I do not recommend these seats for the disabled or those needing a cane as the walk up was never ending and took my breath away.  By the time I reached the top I had developed a cramp in my right leg. Thank goodness there were several chairs on the landing just as I entered and the usher greeted me. When I arrived at my seat, I was amazed that I had an unobstructed view of the entire stage and found that I had a clear view of every bit of the perfomance. From this height I saw the very beautiful and ornate statues surrounding the outter edges of the walls of the stage opening.  However, I also saw so much dusk it was unbelievable. Dusk was all over, up high on the statues and walls near the ceiling. I took pics but not easy to see the dusk in the pics. All in all, I will say.... the view from these cheap seats where a great deal better then cheap seats in other theaters.",

18,1,2/23/2016,61,,"New York, NY",Shachi B.,743,2.0,555,"I came to the Lyceum to see Arthur Miller's ""A View From the Bridge"" a few days ago and while the play was phenomenal (seriously, try to see it before it ends this month!), the theater was just average. Perhaps this is a disconnect between my imagination and reality, but when I go to a Broadway play, I want it to be a grand experience. A fancy lobby, welcoming and helpful ushers, etc. The Lyceum fell flat for me on those points, which for almost $100 a ticket, was kind of a bummer. I sat in the mezzanine and found the experience to be disappointing. For a 2 hour play with no intermission, you should be very prepared to be uncomfortable the entire time. I am barely 5'2"" and my knees were almost squished up against the seat in front of me. Since there is little to no space between rows, there is no place to really put your coat/purse. Mine sat on my lap the entire evening since I think i missed the coat check on my way in. Again, not a deal breaker per se, but not the grand Broadway experience I conjured up in my head.Views from the mezzanine are fine (see pic), but as others have mentioned, the sound doesn't travel upward very well. Also, since the seats are quite small and close together, you will definitely hear every small noise around you, which will affect your enjoyment of the play depending on your ability to concentrate on just the actors. Bottom line: Extraordinary performances, but be prepared for an uncomfortable seating experience.",10
19,6,11/29/2016,297,4,"Marin County, CA",Tracey A.,1571,3.0,1262,"The Lyceum is a very, very old Broadway theatre, the oldest continuously operating theatre in New York City, dating back to 1903 .  If something's playing there that you want to see, by all means do.  But heads up:  set your expectations accordingly.  The good:  *  The theater is relatively intimate with fewer than 925 seats.      *  Rush tickets are sometimes offered for that evening's performance.  No lottery, just show up when the box office opens.  Here's the rush policy for the current show:  theatermania.com/broadwa…  The not-so good:*  The seats in the mezzanine and balcony are real nose-bleeds.  The pitch of the theater in this area is so steep that if you lean too far forward your eyeglasses might cascade down to center stage.    *  Seats on the mezzanine and balcony are up multiple flights of stairs with no elevator.  If you have mobility issues the orchestra (or wheelchair accessible) seats are your only real option.*  The sad basement space is set up as a pre-show bar.  Drinking there depressed me and not just because of the $14 price of beer (2nd beer = $9).  I'd recommend you get your pre-show drinks elsewhere.  *  Or not.  If you're female and seated in the mezzanine or balcony there's but a single restroom available to you and that restroom cannot be used during the performance.  Tread lightly on the pre-show liquids, ladies; you've been warned.  None of the not-so-goods would stop me (nor should stop you) from seeing a show here but it's always worth knowing what you're getting yourself into.  Consider that box checked.",13

Everything is dusty and dilapidated, the seats are sprung, and the paint is peeling off the walls in the stairwells. Incidentally, if you're sitting in the balcony, you will be in the stairwells a considerable time because it's an Everest-like hike to get up there.

22,,10/16/2016,357,,"New York, NY",Daniela L.,37,3.0,144,"My first impression, upon entering the Lyceum Theatre, was that it was an unassuming, traditional venue. Little did I know, it is actually Broadway's ""oldest continually operating legitimate theatre."" In fact, Lyceum is also the first Broadway theatre to achieve landmark status, a title it earned back in 1974.Constructed in 1903, the building eventually fell into the hands of the Shuberts forty-seven years later. Outside, the six columns above the entrance are reminiscent of the Greek Parthenon, exhibiting elegant intricacy to an otherwise modest appearance. Once inside, the lobby resembles that of typical performance halls, but the massive staircases on both the left and right open up the room, creating the impression of a mansion's grand entryway.These staircases lead into never ending smaller sets for access to the Mezzanine and Balcony. My seat was located in the Balcony, which is the third level; there are two flights of stairs just to reach the Mezzanine, and then two additional flights up to the Balcony. I don't mind stairs, but it's important to note that the majority of the theatre is unequivocally unfit for patrons in wheelchairs and those who have trouble walking.Lyceum's most impressive aspect is the elaborate architectural detailing throughout the auditorium. The decorative, sculpted sections above the center of the stage, as well as along the private box seats' borders, are exceptionally striking, and augment the venue's historical value.Acoustics and observation quality are the most critical components of a theatre - they can either make or break the experience. I attended a performance of Oh, Hello, a play that literally focuses on the banter between two characters for the bulk of the show. Sound is paramount, as the dialogue controls the entire flow of the story. When the actors were the only ones speaking, the acoustics were fine; but with the audience frequently laughing (Oh, Hello is a comedy), it was sometimes a challenge to catch everything that was said. The visuals weren't incredibly detailed for this play, so I was able to see the whole stage without any issues, despite my Balcony seating.I would definitely recommend shelling out a few extra dollars for better tickets, particularly if dialogue is central to the show. Musicals may not matter as much, so it's really to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, for a venue that has managed to remain standing for over a hundred years (113 on November 2nd), the Lyceum Theatre is in solid shape, and I'm certain it will continue to thrive for many more years.",

25,1,5/18/2015,785,3,"New York, NY",Victoria O.,371,4.0,815,"Over a century old, the Lyceum has a rich history. It's on the small side, like the Music Box (also old) and really beautiful in the theater proper. But the Music Box has a vast basement with ornate bathrooms, a grand piano and much space to purchase souvenirs.  The Lyceum has next to no lobby and the bathroom situation is beyond bizarre. The women's room is downstairs but you don't get to it from the lobby. The men's room is easy to reach and to the left as you enter.  You enter the women's room from the aisle at the rear of the orchestra. I am writing this review because I thought it might be nice for a woman to know where to pee--because you sure as hell can't find anyone after the show who knows. The bathroom has not been renovated at least since Jimmy Carter was in the White House. This is sorta charming. None of those air dryers or pressure assist toilets. But the stalls are rickety with just four or five stalls, it's not as though a renovation would annihilate profits for a year. The seats need to be updated too. They're really uncomfortable and you feel a bit like you're on the 6 train at rush hour. The American Airlines theater (""Roundabout"") is much more spacious and elegant. In summer, the seats present an additional problem for women: they're itchy on bare legs, so if you do wear a sundress make sure it's long. At least you can stick your feet under the seat in front of you. I don't know how anyone over 5/8 could sit in the seat I did. At 5/8 barefoot and 6 feet in heels, I had to shift perpetually. Happily I have some dance training and think I was able to do so without disturbing the nice lady next to me. I would absolutely hate to be short but on airplanes and in cramped spaces, being a munchkin would be nice. She was comfy for the whole show. So why 4 stars? It's beautiful in a shabby chic sort of way, and any stage graced with Chita Rivera's presence is fine by me. It' on 45th so close to the NQR stop at 49th. Wear slacks if you can. As for seating: the ""rear"" of the orchestra is much better than the Mezzanine. I looked. If you're on one of the sites looking at a seating chart, try to get rear orchestra. In a theater of this size, even the last orchestra row is okay. I paid only 91 for N smack dab in the middle. You don't want to be in the side, but the back of the orchestra is perfect.",11

28,6,4/2/2013,4421,4,"San Francisco, CA",Ed U.,35768,4.0,4418,"REVIEW: The NanceWhenever you get a chance to see Nathan Lane in a full-fledged star turn on Broadway, you should take it and gladly as he is a singular talent. He has found an ideal character to play as Chauncey Miles, a headliner in the seedy world of 1930's New York burlesque. His specialty is playing the ""nance"", a stereotypically effeminate man whose string of hilariously accidental double-entendres are usually delivered by a straight comic. The irony is that Chauncey is gay and deeply secretive about his proclivities given that any outward display of homosexuality in the real world can get him arrested.In fact, he is first seen cruising discreetly at a Greenwich Village automat as he pretends to read the newspaper. Most memorable to me for his clever stage adaptation of ""Xanadu"" a few years ago, playwright Douglas Carter Beane alternates the sad-eyed drama of these scenes with outrageous burlesque sketches obviously to point out the stark contrast in Chauncey's personal and professional selves. This dichotomy is at the heart of this drama only in its third night of previews when I saw it on March 23. Complicating his life is Ned, a young man running away from a loveless marriage in Buffalo and right into Chauncey's world of flamboyant performers within the underbelly of showbiz.The idea of an intimate monogamous relationship is so foreign to Chauncey that he struggles mightily with the unearthed feelings he develops for Ned. Meanwhile, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia is determined to clean up the city before the 1939 World's Fair by enforcing a moral code on the theater community that endangers Chauncey's livelihood. His colleagues are willing to either protest or compromise, but Chauncey steadfastly refuses to change his persona for the sake of professional survival. As an ardent Republican, he is in so much self-denial that he is convinced that the mayor is just posturing before the elections and will do nothing.Director Jack O'Brien dexterously picks up the flavor of the period without overdoing the camp factor, but the show's pacing starts to drag (literally) in Act II when the inevitable appears stretched to showcase Lane in a series of predetermined bravura moments. The result feels too long by at least a half-hour, but I understand that trimming has occurred since the performance I saw. There are good supporting turns from veterans Lewis J. Stadlen and Cady Huffman (reunited with Lane from ""The Producers"") as well as Jonny Orsini who manages to be affecting without being overly cloying as Ned. Make no mistake, however, that this is Lane's show all the way, and by all means, go see it if you're a fan.",5

It is relatively small compared to some in the theater district. This means that there are fewer ""bad"" seats in the house. When I saw Disgraced, I was in the left orchestra in row G all the way at the wall. This ended up being a ""bad"" seat due to the fact that part of the stage was out of view the whole time. My only tip would be to sit minimally 2 seats in from the wall on either side to ensure a full stage view.That said, the play, Disgraced, the 2013 Pulitzer Prize winner, was tremendous. At times the play was hard to watch due to its explosive nature, but it necessarily pushes boundaries that as a society we are constantly stretching. Well cast. A must see in my book.",3

Now thinking back I should have went outside but I thought they would not allow outside water. So while I respect there was a $10 min for that establishment, which I only found out after waiting 15mins, the male bartender said ""I can't accept your card for $5 I get in trouble"".

I usually would have gotten a drink instead of a water but conversationally I replied ""oh I took medication I can't buy alcohol but I do want the bottle for me and someone else"" ( someone else being the person I came to see the show with who was waiting upstairs) the male bartender replied ""oh so you are lying to me now "", takes away the bottle of water. I was shocked he just said that for no Effing reason. Who talks to patrons like that ??? Shameful. I told the bartender ""do not talk to patrons like that and I saw the female bartender tell another customer I'll make an exception"" , apparently that exception was for $9. As I am telling the bartender to respect patrons, the manager Heidi steps in. She goes on and on about $10 minimum. I tell Heidi ""my Concern was not about the minimum, I totally understand that, my concern is about how incredibly rude and out of line the bartender was"" . Heidi tells me ""if You want to complain You can but there are cups for water downstairs"" . I asked her if she understands what happened. She said "" I observed and there was a $10 minimum"" . Again ""Heidi I respect that, I believe you missed the part where the bartender spoke to me with utter disrespect telling me if I am lying to him"". She didn't want to hear it and kept circling back to $10 minimum. I asked the male bartender's name since I am going to follow her directions to write the complaint and she said ""it's only these two - male and female who always work"". Now you are the one lying Heidi. I was thirsty and just so upset a bartender unnecessarily spoke to me like that in front of other guests . I was literally in tears. SHAME FOR THE MANAGEMENT WHO DOESNT COACH THE STAFF TO SPEAK TO PATRONS NICELY. All the patrons spent a lot of money to be there and they don't deserve this kind of demeaning service. One last concern - the hygiene of the bar . While I was waiting in line ( which curved ) I saw there were cleaning supplies in the same shelves as extra glasses which they were using to serve patrons. I am definitely going to be raising these concerns with the NY Department of health. Lastly after the show ( since my partner saw me in tears after I was back from intermission ) he tried to talk to Heidi at the end too and again she kept focusing on $10 minimum when that was not the dispute here. Very sly and smart to change to focus of the mistreatment here. It also shows her as a manager doesn't care and will blame the customer. She gave us a generic card and said ""thank you kindly now please escort yourselves out""Yeah she didn't give a shit about customer service either. DONT EVER GO TO THIS PLACE THEY DONT DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS.",2

The ushers are are super nice and the seats are quite comfortable for an older theatre. And every show I've seen here has been quite awesome (The Nance & Disgraced so far).Fun fact: David Frohman's apartment is atop the theatre, and it's currently home to the Shubert Archive.

Also, if you're on the aisle seating near the front in the balcony, the guard rail is so high it blocks half the stage.  And you already have to sit up very straight and tall to see the complete stage past the light rigging.  And the theater is built so severely high that you're literally looking at the top of the performers' heads.And, of course, it's about a four story climb up to the balcony.  We lapped other patrons who couldn't climb that high as quickly.  It's kind of ridiculous....and I can't imagine a speedy evacuation in the case of emergency.",1

It looked like she was counting something so she ignored us for the first few minutes. Then minutes later she says ""I'll be right with you..."" Not the most polite, but I'll live. Easy will call pick up, we bought tickets through Goldstar and it was a pretty good deal. We were running late to the show since it was near Time Square and all. We were like a 5 minutes late. Luckily, the show hadn't started or anything. The ushers were nice enough to seat us quickly. This theater is more narrow than a different place down the street I saw Kinky Boots at. I was looking down at the show, at a high angle. I mean I got what I paid for, no major complaints. From up there, initially i was worried I wasn't able to hear the cast speak.

The box office was a mess, the lines were crazy and they tried to manage them but random things like a trash barrel in the middle of the waiting area could easily be fixed. Once inside, we were in the first row and didn't realize that it was right up against the stage so you couldn't walk in front of it. The usher treated us like idiots for not knowing this, and was really rude when he asked us to go around to the other side of the row so people didn't  have to get up. They were also super aggressive about pictures, my friend took one just of the curtain before the show started and they screamed at her from across the theater. At the end,they were just as rude trying to get people to leave. I only paid 30 dollars for my tickets through linctix but if I had paid 130 like a lot of people, I would be really unhappy to be treated that way.

Hearing an entire instrumental version of Free Bird during one of the most intense scenes of the play was embarrassing for everyone.",

The Lyceum Theatre, now over 100 years old, has received landmark status, and for good reason. The inside and outside of the building is exquisitely reminiscent of theatre of yesteryear - the classical white columns on the exterior are enough to gain anyone's admiration.This past week I attended a showing of Reasons to be Pretty (still in previews). Although I sat on the far left (albeit in the 4th row) I had no problem with the view. Can't speak for the balcony. Leg room was not exceptional, but certainly better than other theatres in New York.",

82,2,7/9/2011,175,,"San Francisco, CA",Annie Y.,44,4.0,115,"This review is for Ghetto Klown currently playing at the Lyceum Theatre.Leguizamo is shorter, feistier, and more boyish than I imagined him to be. On stage and up close, with his toned and supple stature, he stands shy of 5'8. Never the main character in the movies he is casted in, Leguizamo is nonetheless a memorable character. I remember seeing him in Romeo+Juliet and thinking at the time what a badass job Baz Lurhman did in recreating Tybalt.  Leguizamo begins Ghetto Klown, his fifth solo show, with a blank canvas (literally there is a projector) and paints a progressively vivid picture of his whimsical, intellectual, and multicultural life. His acting career in Hollywood (film/TV) and New York (theatre) serve as the backbone to his latest work of art while his energetic dance moves , adolescent sexual jokes (John touches on his early childhood emigrating with his parents from ""El Anus, Colombia"" and growing up ""in the scrotum of Queens""), and dead-on impersonations  provide ample embellishment.Throughout the course of the play, we learn about John, that he grew up in the boroughs of Queens where he is forever a Met's fan, perhaps symbolic of his self-admitted role as an underdog setting out to prove people wrong. We follow him as he struggles to bridge the emotional gap with his father. We witness from start to finish his two failed relationships and see pictures of his loveable children and wife. As the audience identifies with John's struggle to land the perfect or non-stereotypical role in ruthless Hollywood, we are made aware that this fast talking, ambitious and creative man's raw talent is best captured as a writer and then an actor in front of a live audience. Leguizamo often times comes off as self-aggrandizing. His on and off depression and struggle to ""find himself"" begin to sounds like a whiney broken record.  The tune sounds all too familiar. Leguizamo's foibles are quickly forgiven however because of his ability to charm the audience with his humorous self-degradation and Peter Pan syndrome. In the end, Leguizamo is likeable. We get the sense that he is at peace and know that he is triumphant in his endeavors.",1
83,,3/23/2009,686,,"Washington, DC",Jim U.,3044,3.0,1303,"I saw ""Reasons to be Pretty"" here yesterday, but this review is just going to focus on the theater.  It is a very charming old theater which has a very dramatic (pardon the pun) stage as viewed from the vantage point of the balcony.  However, the balcony seating is steeply pitched which can make for a very awkward view of the stage.  Also the rows of seats on the balcony are especially close together, so your feet are very much in contact with the seat in front of you.  Should you cross your legs, you will find the crossing leg dangling more than half way over the seat in front of you -- it's that narrow.  So yes, charming, old, but awkward and a tad uncomfortable.  See my photos to see the view from the balcony.",2

I have been to a number of broadway shows before but my husband is a newbie. i treated us to tickets because we just love Nathan Lane and it was up for 5 Tony nominations. I should have realized that one of the nominations was not for best show. we both almost fell asleep in the first act. I wanted to leave at intermission but the tickets were expensive even with a discount that we decided to watch the entire show. If you go do stay for the second act. it was much better than the first. Nathan Lane as always was great. it was the show that was lousy. if Nathan Lane ever leaves the show don't bother to see it. We couldn't believe all the good reviews we read. What did we miss? The theatre itself was fine. Old. The ceiling needed dusting.,
90,3,8/8/2011,46,2,"Queens, NY",Fritz P.,328,4.0,18,"John Leguizamo's new one-man-show is a live autobiography at the Lyceum Theatre called ""Ghetto Klown"". It is about the love he's lost, found, and fought for since the 1960's when he moved from Columbia to Queens to start a new life with his parents. ""Ghetto Klown"" is a journey with all the people who never gave up on Leguizamo and his talent. Throughout act one Leguizamo introduces and impersonates his best friend Ray Ray, the first person who told him he was funny, to his high school Math teacher Mr. Zufa, who told him to try acting as a way to control his overactive energy, to his first acting teacher who gave him endless material to read and develop his craft at a young age. More influential in his life as he gets older, as Leguizamo blows imaginary lines of cocaine on stage, is his coke-addicted booking agent. The emotional center of the story surrounds his father who constantly told Leguizamo to not pursue opportunities and never supported his passion for acting.Leguizamo's performances are honest and one-of-a kind. The theatre feels like a confessional as he bares his soul sharing intimate details. As his career starts in small roles on ""Miami Vice"" and mindless gangsters in movies, he plays clips on a large projection screen behind him showing his honest effort in each role. His jokes are repetitive, but are always funny and never offensive. An uncensored reoccurring clip plays throughout the story of Leguizamo anytime he's depressed. This includes videos of him masturbating, tossing in bed, and being drunk.To watch Leguizamo perform concentrated dialogue from his past, solo on stage, is watching him breakdown in front of an audience every night and hope he can put himself back together by the end. The last scene of the first act recounts Leguizamo's father threatening to sue him for slandering his family in Leguizamos Broadway original, ""Freak"". His father tells him the show is a disgrace and he disowns him. The savage emotion in the words resonates through the theatre. Leguizamo counterattacks saying, ""You have to own me first--You never played with me,"" in the most defeatest voice. ""I'm a fun guy."" The play touches the difficult and unexpected parts of life making us human. The second act starts with Leguizamo loosing Ray Ray forever over fame and money. ""Thirty-years of friendship, gone,"" Leguizamo says, reminding everyone friends come and go--everyone is a Judas.""Ghetto Klown"" is a journey of self-discovery for Leguizamo and the audience. It is free therapy allowing no one in the theatre to leave his or her emotions unexamined. It reflects the destruction people put themselves through to feel accepted by themselves and people they love. At the end Leguizamo becomes a father to his two children and then marries his wife who was his former costume designer.  He is dyslexic in this way, but there is no denying he is piecing himself back together. ""Ghetto Klown"" inspires and reexamines the American dream knowing with change comes growth and acceptance. By taking a look into Leguizamo's life he invites us to take a look at our own.",3
91,,4/20/2008,89,,"San Francisco, CA",Soozie H.,2,4.0,499,"I am going to break away from the herd here and give the Lyceum Theatre  only 4 *'s. Sorry but I know it's an old theater but it loses it's ""charm"" on me when I am forced to sit in a truly uncomfortable position to watch the performance.I came here last night to see Patrick Stuart in ""MacBeth"". It was my first time seeing a show in this theater. We had orchestra seats in the front row and walked up 6 flights of stairs to get there. We were totally out of breath and dizzy by the time we got to the top. To get to our seats, we had to walk down some VERY narrow and steep stairs which looked a bit scary as well. When we got to our seats and sat down, we noticed our seats were curved and all leaning to the left! Initially we both thought it was just us BUT, after further study, we realized it was the seats that were off! To add to the discomfort, we couldn't sit back during the whole show because the balustrade BLOCKED our VIEW of the stage and so we were both forced to sit FORWARD during the entire 3 hrs show! The theatre does have very nice detailed ornamentation but I'm not there to look at it's design. I must say, their sound system is AWESOME! MacBeth was phenomenal and I highly recommend seeing it despite the poor seating.",

I gather it is landmarked, including the bathrooms, which other people here have referenced. So today, in addition to the huge line for the only 4 bathroom stalls for women down in the theatre basement, I returned to my seat in the mezzanine for the 2nd Act. I heard this banging noise like someone trying to get in a door, and this went on for a long time and nobody could figure out where it was coming from: I put it down to stage scenery, but no. Turned out, there is one additional teeny bathroom at the top of the mezzanine, which because of its proximity to the seats is locked while the performance is going on. Unfortunately someone, presumably the usher, had actually padlocked the bathroom door before the 2nd Act, without checking to see if anyone was in there. I imagine that poor woman was let out after what seemed like 10 minutes of banging the door. Sort of like an Edgar Allen Poe story. Everyone's worst theatre nightmare.",1
