0,Davis T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",192,48,12,4.0,9/20/2018,"I went to the Grayson for the first time last night for trivia night. My roommate and I had just moved to the area and wanted to find a trivia spot. It was great. Trivia started promptly at 8:30. The host of trivia, Mike, was very personable. The trivia they do here has 7 rounds with different themes. Each round goes fairly quickly though I think we finished up around 11PM. Again, the host was great and made playing fun and easy. The questions were challenging enough that it was thought provoking without making us feel stupid. They give out raffle tickets in the beginning which they call out each round and you win very large candy bars. Definitely going back.",,,
1,Joy N.,"New York, NY",1,39,32,1.0,10/1/2018,"Don't waste your time. Coordinated with a really friendly person via email for a birthday section reservation over the course of a week. We confirmed for a table of 8 for 10:30 on a Saturday night. When we got there, the drunk sloppy crowd watching the Friday night game was actually spilling out of the front entrance (in more ways than one... ). When my group was able to maneuver to the front to confirm our table, the waitress was so dismissive and had no clue of the my reservation (which I somewhat get, it's a busy crowded night, but the attitude, I'm not a fan of). After 15 minutes of waiting in a sticky, flatulence ridden corner with society's biggest derelicts, my group quickly maneuvered back out of the crowd in favor for the bar across the street.Don't get me wrong, I love a lively bar crowd, but it was clear they were occupied over capacity and that their reservation planning, knowing fully well that it was a game night which I would've just arrived earlier for to beat the crowd and secure an area, was really poor.Update: OMG my first poorly written angry business owner response! As you can see from the response from the business, I rest my case that they're clearly trying to cover for honestly a misstep with the waitresses who were staffed that night. Yes, there was ping pong exchange between me and whoever accommodates reservations (who I gave kudos to whoever organized the reservation via email in my initial review because he or she was quite nice in adjusting the fickle times of the people I was inviting) but your reluctancy to admit your faults is, oh wait, still your fault.Gotta love the thorough peruse of my Yelp review history and dedication to write your rebuttal at 2am in the morning...",1,,
2,Jackie P.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,23,3,1.0,9/14/2018,"I first visited this bar several months ago purely out of convenience as I had been at a happy hour across the street. It turned out to be trivia night and our team won, which made up for the inedible bar food that was delivered ice cold. Fast forward to this week, when I realized that my trivia prize gift certificate was about to expire. The bartender confirmed that we could use the gift certificate then proceeded to explain the bar's happy hour specials to us. I ordered a seasonal IPA - the bartender explained that the menu was new and that they didn't have my choice because they were ""still getting rid of the old beer"" then asked if I wanted that instead. Yeah, no I didn't want an ""old beer"", so I settled on a miniature glass of what tasted like boxed wine (maybe it was also old?). Other people in my party also tried ordering beer from the menu that wasn't yet available. By the time we closed out, a new bartender had taken over and told us that we couldn't use the gift certificate because we were taking advantage of the happy hour specials. The bartender escalated to the manager who escalated to the owner who ultimately agreed that we couldn't use it. Not only did the original bartender confirm that we could use it, but the gift certificate itself noted nothing about happy hour. The owner ended up adjusting some of our drinks from happy hour to full price then applied the gift certificate to those drinks. Ridiculous.",1,1,

Updated review","Perfect spot for happy hour and MNF. $11 wings and beer, $4 brews, $7 jamo shots. That's a pretty good package right there, especially when you need to drink enough to forget that the Jets blew the game. A bonus that HH starts at noon and covers $5 wells, $8 burgers and more. There are more TV's than you can count here (and even more when you're seeing double). Come on out for game day!",21,10,19

7,Amanda G.,"New York, NY",202,89,73,4.0,9/20/2018,"Wednesday trivia nights at the Grayson are INTENSE. My amateur trivia team and I showed up expecting a casual evening of maybe 10 trivia questions. We were wholly unprepared for the 70-question-plus-a-bonus-round debauchery that ensued. Despite our initial shock at the level of competition, we put up our best fight and had a great time. The Grayson is definitely doing trivia right. They have a beer of the week special for 5$, and they raffle off FREE CANDY. My name was drawn and I won a massive brick of chocolate, which was a splendid consolation prize since our trivia team came in last. We'll definitely be back for a rematch, though. Stop by on Wednesday and give trivia at the Grayson a try. Wait, no, actually, don't do that. Unless you're realllyyy bad at trivia. Then you can come.",1,,

Trivia: The bar was at capacity for game night. You form team (so bring your friends) for game night. There are 7 rounds are trivia (sports, music, history and geography, picture identification) with breaks inbetween. The event was definitely and takes 1.5 hours. Good time to catch-up with friends and impress them with your trivia knowledge.Prizes were as follows:First place: $35 Grayson certificate.Second place: $25 Grayson certificate.Third place: $15 Grayson certificate.The following is my review of the drink and food:Drink: I ordered the Ludlow. The drink was the cocktail of the week for $9. Drink was average i would not order again.Food: I ordered the Grayson burger (and came with an order of fries). The burger was pretty good. The Grayson burger had bacon, sunny side egg and cheddar cheese.For $10.95 on Wednesday, it was great value. Normally the burger is $15.95.Service: Service was good. Water was refilled. Food was brought in a timely manner. (Not in the middle of trivia but during the break).",1,,1

I can't even talk about the Niners. Straight depressing. And to cope w the sitch, the buds were ordering rounds and rounds of shots. Here's why I love this city: pickle backs is a thing. Love pickles. The waitress was coming by effectively and often. The DJ was jamming out the Bay 90s hip hop! Even gave my friend and I a Bay Area shout-out! WOOT! Were we that obvious? Prob bc of our SF and The City stuff happening. Anywho, bar was great. Vibes were cool. But some of the other patrons were TOTAL DBs. It was a lot at some point. One guy had to be told to sit down.

Its a small place, darkly lit (considering its a bar) and has a fun ambience to it. I was a bit confused walking in bc nobody seated us and we had to walk inside past the bar to seat ourselves. And like i said, its a small place so in the middle of broad daylight be aware that there can be and most likely will be drunk ppl sitting closeby having a small ""party"" drinking and being obnoxiously loud. Usually i would not like this but for some reason it was okay at this place..Anyways, for the food, i ordered a burger platter and it was AMAAAZING. Super big portion with a side of your choice (reg fries, waffle fries, sweet potato fries, etc) and burger was juicy and they dont skimp on the ingredients so you will have a hearty meal:) One thing to note is the drinks arent that great... they have happy hour weekdays from 3-7 so i got the vodka soda ($5) but it was super watered down, barely tasted the alcohol or the soda lmao...The beer tasted better than this.

Not seating a party with a view of their team - who responsibly arrives an hour early TO GET A TABLE is bad customer service.

Lunch special here will run you less than 9 bucks for a burger cooked how you like with fries. And it's a decent burger.Thick patty, good bread and crisp vegetables and tomato. Fries come out nice and oily at a decent portion as well.The bar seemed to only have one attendant but she easily serves myself and six others with no problems. The space is open and well decorated / great lighting. Clean restrooms downstairs. Plenty of this to watch on the dozens of tv screens.There seems to be an upstairs section as well (didn't go but curious about it).All in all this is a great place for a good (and relatively cheap) lunch.

My love slash hate affair with sports can be seen in its full glory on fall weekend afternoons at sports bars like this one. It's pathetic. Me, not the bar. TV's. Lot's of them. It's pretty much the best reason to like this place. Each turned on to different games. More importantly, if you ask nicely, they may even turn on the one closet to you to your game, even though no one has heard of your college and can't believe they even have a football program. Attentive bartenders. They are aware enough to know when to ask if you want another and when to  leave you the fuck alone, because your team is getting it's ass kicked. Again. They are also  astute enough to make your drink, post loss, stiffer then your morning wood, because they know what a loser really needs in life: alcohol poisoning. ASAP. The standard basic bitch menu. It's what you need for these kind of moments and for the most part, it's average. Listen, you didn't come here for food made by a 2 star Michelin hack.  Whatever Jose and Louis make back there is good enough. It's merely a vehicle to make sure you don't die from all the alcohol that you have been consuming to get over another loss in the ongoing saga that is: your gambling addiction.

Updated review",The fact that Ms. LeAnn never takes responsibility for the terrible service or negativity at this establishment shows poor leadership and management. Not  one response from you has been kind nor have you tried to rectify anything. It's not my responsibility to seek you out and make a complaint. It is your responsibility to read the dozen negative reviews and say hmmm how can I fix this and do better since I see a pattern here. How about you put your big girl panties on and act like a professional part of management and get this place in order instead of responding with disrespectful insults. I'll continue to tell my family and friends not go to this establishment.,8,2,

Music that day was terrible. ( I'm 24 and thought the music was bad). left after 15 minutes. not sure if thats how Saturdays are or if that was just a day everyone wanted to go to the Grayson.

I started off with a Bloody Mary for the first and last time in my life, I have no idea how people drink that! Anyhow to the venue itself; it's not the largest bar, but it accommodated the large football Sunday somewhat comfortably, if that makes any sense.Food: 4 out of 5: collectively we had the steak queasadillas, mozzarella sticks, French fries, chicken wings, Philly cheesesteak, fudge brownie and apple pie. Everyone enjoyed their food, but the apple pie I had was just ok, not great. However, the Greyson Melt aka a Philly was pretty goodAtmosphere: 5 out of 5: since they have every game on here, the bar had fans of various teams, but the atmosphere was pleasant. During the commercial breaks of the major game the DJ played music and hey also helped put us somber Giants fans in a good moodPrices: 5 out of 5: the prices were very fair, the bar offers daily specials, but most none apply during football Sunday. The Sunday specials are from 11 to 1PM. They begin again at 9PM to close. Everything was fairly priced from the alcohol ($5-10) to the food ($12-16), and finally the desserts ($7).Lastly, a lot of places that offer something for a Yelp check-in either they give you an attitude or have some excuse as to why they don't accept it, but here they accepted it without an issue!I'll definitely visit this place again, and hopefully my Giants will have a better outcome next time...",,,2

Only downside I can remark on was that music was inconsistently turned on during the commercial breaks in games. I like bars that do that, but when it comes in for 30 seconds at a time during a 5 minute commercial break, it feels a little lazy.Good happy hour pricing on the old staples and a decent selection of more premium beers.

They also ended the happy hour like a half hour early, even though my friends and I wanted like 2 more, at least (lol), which I'm assuming was due to the crawl.

Only thing I didn't enjoy was how far the bathroom was.  It was two flights down and allllll the way the back of the restaurant. Hate that but maybe I'll go back here one day,,,
41,Marileny A.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",0,4,1,5.0,3/30/2018,"Put together my friends bday happy hour here and we had a blast!! The menu is loaded with great bar food - and there's 2 happy hours that start as the other ends. It's perfect!!! Two things to consider - I booked for a Wednesday night but didn't know it was Trivia night so definitely check to see if there are any special events going on. Also the back bar area is pretty small. It's absolutely perfect for a group of 15 people but I needed space for 30+ - we had closer to 50 people show up. It ended up working out though. Even with the crowd the servers were able to take care of everyone. The patrons took care of our party while doing trivia. They found a way to incorporate everyone in. So it worked out. I would definitely recommend this bar. It's cute inside and the music, food and drinks are all a great vibe.",,,

The food/drinks were good; had a burger and fries and multiple drinks (no complaints). Angie our server was very polite, and patient, overall I'll definitely be back.",2,,

The bouncer on the other hand...Literally just now I held the door open for my girlfriend and ask asked me to shut the door. I responded I'm holding it open for my girlfriend and he said shut the door you're letting the cold air in (it was 50 degrees outside) so I said okay she's coming calm down. He responded by saying ""don't tell me to calm down, stupid b*tch""So that's the first thing you'll experience when you walk in this place. So, come here for the nice waitresses not the RUDE bouncer .",1,,

47,Mala L.,"Long Island, NY",510,313,1261,4.0,4/3/2016,"I'm a fan. We came to watch the NCAA tournament. The TV situation was great - large and small TVs *everywhere* so you'll have a good view wherever you sit. As it should be though - a good sports bar doesn't have a bad seat in the house. And they also showed the game with sound. Win and win.Overall, I was pleased with the food and service. Their menu doesn't stray far from standard bar food but they do it well! We got nachos and a burger to share. Our server was very nice and attentive whenever we needed something but also didn't bother or rush us at all. Drinks were solid as well.Crowd was decent - we went Sunday afternoon and the bar and tables were filled but it wasn't annoyingly crowded or fratty like some places. On the day of the Final Four (Saturday) the place was jam packed and loud so I assume the vibe fluctuates depending on the day and sporting event. Regardless, I like this place and would come again!",,,

51,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,4.0,9/23/2015,"From the outside looking in, The Grayson looks like any other old sports bar. You wouldn't see it as a place that actually served good food but to my surprise, that's exactly what they did. Yes, they've got your typical wings and nachos, but they also have salads, pasta, fajitas, and a variety of burgers. Plus, it's almost always happy hour! Well, it's happy hour from 4-8 ($4 drafts and well drinks) and then starting from 8 to close, they have different specials each night (including food specials). I didn't go with the $6.95 Monday night burger but instead I opted for the chipotle chicken penne vodka. You could tell it was freshly made because the pasta wasn't mushy and there were actual chunks of garlic. My only gripe was that the bread that came with the pasta was stale but I don't think that's something that'll stop me from coming back. Also, our waitress seemed like she hated life so I guess next time I do come back, I'll just have to hope she's not working that night. Tip - check in on Yelp and you can get 10% off the bill.",5,,1

Grayson burger was super soggy but very good, especially w/the bacon inside. I also liked the french fries too. Went w/two Bloody Marys on special to continue the bachelor party closeout, and they were good, and had a huge stick-o-bacon inside too, for good measure. Long bar, with back seating, and several tv's in the front of the house. Since it was empty, the waitress was super attentive and always asking us if we were ok. Bathrooms are located downstairs. Very good location in the LES and right across the street from the F Train at 2nd Ave. I'd be back if in the area.",1,,1
54,Andre V.,"Cedar Crest, NM",204,4,2,2.0,5/13/2017,"This place is very good for sports watching but the quality of the DJs is definitely poor. On Saturday May 13, 2017 they had probably one of the worst DJs I've heard in NYC. I asked what his name was so I could explicitly mention it here but the bartenders said he was new. To describe him a bit, he was Asian and had sleeve tattoos on his right arm. He played old hits with no twist, probably taking advantage of the upbeat crowd but he didn't even bother playing new songs and he was ride with people who approached him to ask for songs. In fact, he might as well burn ""Drag Queen"" by now because he played it (maybe) 10 times in 3 or 4 hours. I really hope that @thegrayson reads this review for the sake of their business...get rid of his DJ.Update: the DJs name is ""El Filipino"" or something along those lines.",1,1,

Super accommodating to our separate checks need, and having craft beers on happy hour + happy hour food, is amazing. I expected their happy hour burger to be tiny, but it was a good sized burger with fries! My friends lived all the options and everyone was happy.I don't normally trek down there for drinks, but this is a great place to pull together a group of friends. Environment : it's  a sports bar and gets loud on a Fri night. Lots of TVs, so everyone can catch up on their sports while mingling Great place and glad I booked with them!",3,,1
58,Christine C.,"Boston, MA",142,28,77,4.0,5/21/2018,"I was visiting from Boston and came to watch the nba playoffs. Loved the sports bar vibe and during commercials , there was a dj that played some nice mixes  (just a tad loud  but as the night went on, i adjusted to it). Promptly after the game, it started becoming a dancing spot and tables were taken away and folded away quickly. Staff was really nice and accommodating. The dj was awesome and It was fun for the first hour or two when it became a ""club""! ...but then it got really ratchet. It reminded me of college bar and eventually it got too sloppy and too crowded to stay past 12:30-1. Would recommend for chill watching sports (8-10pm ) and for late20s-late30s year olds trying to go ham/who don't mind being shoulder to shoulder and maybe looking for a new friend ;) (after 11pm)",,,1

61,Barry G.,"Charlotte, NC",264,160,61,4.0,8/25/2016,"Stopped by for brunch but ended up having burger instead, my lady is a pescatarian so I assume she saw nothing appetizing enough. She ordered mozzeralla sticks and fries. I got the Mac and Cheese Burger with fries and it was perfect. I experimented with the Bloody Mary since they were $5 but the hit here are the $2 mimosas. Drawback: There was only ONE server working the entire restaurant but he truly kicked tail. But while kicking tail, obviously he couldn't be personable, kinda sucks. We probably would have stayed for a few more if we didn't feel like we were detrimental to his efficiency. Also this place had the AC on an incredibly uncomfortable temperature. Outside of that, if you are in the LES for brunch. it's a go! Two thumbs up over here.",1,,
62,Samantha A.,"New York, NY",84,117,306,3.0,7/20/2016,"For being right across the street from Boilermaker, I was expecting better. I came in around 545 on a Tuesday night and there were like 3 people sitting at the bar. It's a dark spark and has like 40000 TVs which was pretty cool. The bartender told us to sit wherever so we plopped down at a regular table. He came over with a menu and I asked him his opinion which he was incredibly honest about it- nice to see that!!!! After being told the steak sandwich gets soggy quickly, I went with the classic burger and added mozz cheese and avocado and my friend got the chicken quesadilla. They also had happy hour so we each got 2 glasses of their house reisling for $12 ($6 glasses of wine for happy hour) and that was GOOD wine.My burger was SO dry. The avocado was kinda yucky and the cheese definitely needed to be melted more. If it wasn't so dry it would have been amazing! And the fries were superb. Would 100% go back for those.My friends quesadilla looked amazing and was VERY nicely sized. She had no complaints! Staff was sweet and it's in a great spot. They also serve mozz sticks and fries as a meal so I think I love them regardless of the burger, but I am pretty bitter about it.",1,,1

Even if that is their policy, a little common sense would have been nice, we were all military and my wife and I have the same name. If the ID is good enough to get you access to military base, it should be good enough for a bar; we did not encounter any problems at any other establishments.",1,1,

I ordered the skillet dish and expected it to come in a skillet, but it was more of a breakfast waffle sandwich with home fries. That was pretty dissappointing. The prices at this place was decent and the decor was pretty nice so I can't really complain about that. My friend ordered the hangover burger and it was basically a waffle burger which she didn't particularly enjoy either. Stop for the drinks, maybe skip the food.",,,

The menu here looked pretty straightforward so in we went, but I had no idea this place identifies as a gastropub. I saw ""sports bar"", and when I entered was blasted with the most godawful music, so I automatically thought to stay away from anything adventurous, did not examine the menu much, and ordered the chicken tenders and guacamole because they are hard to mess up. They were cranking out Top 40/EDM at a ridiculous volume. There were like two other tables there besides us, one of them had a single guy sitting at it, watching a game with his beer. Who is this music for??However- the guac was good! Fresh, delicious. And the chicken wings were solid, on the thicker side. But two appetizers and two beers came to $41- ouch! Change up that music guys! I can't justify spending that kind of cash on late night pub food with Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift hollering at me. It's a SCHOOL NIGHT for chrissake.",1,1,

I was so glad that this place actually has heaters and you can feel them when you're at your table. Outside was freezing cold!! The place has multiple big flat screen TV's. They're literally everywhere you look. There's decent seating, as well.Before I get into the food, let me tell you about the MUSIC. IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME! They were playing like 2000's #1 hits, instead of the songs you constantly hear nowadays. It was actually refreshing and brings back old times. Me and my friend were kind of dancing to the music because it was THAT good (Better than club music, I must add). I'm already sold on this factor alone and props to the DJ! You're doing a hella fine job! Service was also great!You have to go downstairs into the basement for the bathrooms. It's like a maze downstairs, since there are some many ways you can go. But you'll be fine!For drinks, we order mimosas. They were $2 EACH. WHAT?! I'M IN. Just when you think the place couldn't get any better. They actually have this as a brunch special for Saturdays and Sundays from 11 AM-1 PM. So please, go!We decided to order the two portions of the Loaded Waffle Fries, since we weren't sure how the portions were like and we were in a group of 4. According to the menu, it consists of bacon, cheddar cheese, sour cream and chives. The sour cream is on the side, as well as ketchup. It was so goooood! My words cannot express how good it was. I mean there's bacon and cheese!! CMON! I'm glad I stumbled upon this gem in the freezing cold. So worth it! Definitely coming back here!!!",1,,1

He was a dick to guests and people were leaving. And the way he treated the waitress was beyond ridiculous, it was inhumane. Turns out this guy is the OWNER!

But the staff here was so nice and understanding and they catered to my party to make sure that we had a good time. The music here was the best, and the food was so delicious!

When we first walked in after dinner, it seemed small and unfit for the dancing we had in mind. Luckily, as we made our way further back, we were happy to find a larger space with a nice sized dance floor and awesome DJ. My friend celebrated too hard and crapped out at 11:30.

As far as i can tell it is not dirty here by any means and yet it feels dirty. More dirty because of the intended purpose of this joint; to get 20 somethings drunk. The burger and fries are remarkable in that the burger and fries are unremarkable. They are plain and suffice in a way considerably commensurate with the price!,,,

For starters, the DJ is on point. He plays music during every commercial break and it's good music too not some top 40 type shit. Second, the bartenders are on it, they make sure that you never go long without a drink in your hand. Initially walking into the bar, it seems rather small, but it goes really deep and has a separate bar in the back. But mostly, what you will enjoy the most is the crowd. Everyone here is into the game, and it's just exciting to be around a bunch of people having a good time.",,,2

Nice daily specials.  Although I don't particularly like sports bars, this one didn't feel like a frat rat den on the night I went.  LOVE the 1980s music and music videos that played on alternate screens. Seems like there is something for everyone here. Eclectic young crowd.  The food is good but it could have used a bit more seasoning and flavor IMHO as well as the draft Guinness which seemed not as bold and dark as I've had at other bars (hold it up to the light and you'll see what I mean).  The male bartenders and management in here seem a bit standoffish but the female staff were more approachable and friendly. Saw only 2 waitresses in here on the night I went so I can understand why many reviewers said that theirs was MIA. The place is long and there is a back room which has it's own bar.  Looks like there is a DJ booth and perhaps they have dancing in the back as evidenced by the club lighting effects.

I get an email asking to please change my review and I was considering it but have been busy,  and now I get a response from ""manager"" and I use the term loosely,  basically trying to belittle me. Yes this place sucks, if your ""dress code"" for a sleazy bar is so important you would have your employees enforce it to EVERYONE not decide to single out, bully and berate one specific customer in your crap hole.

The music was great and so was the atmosphere. I ordered a double cheese burger with waffle fries and although the waffle fries were a tad bit too salty, the burger made up for it. The one thing I'd like to go back for is the fudge cake, it's delicious. 5 stars for The Grayson!",,,

90,Amanda M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,3,4.0,7/10/2017,"The Greyson is a good happy hour spot, with different happy hour specials everyday. Came here with a few girlfriends twice so far and the music has been great. A mix of the 90s (which are my fav) and today's music. I also appreciate the service, the waiters come up to you pretty frequently which could be both good and bad. Of course if you need something it's good but if you don't and been approached 3 times you start to feel like your being rushed (maybe not the case) We have plans to be back and I'm sure it'll be a good time. Steak bites and loaded  tater tot's  recommended",,,

93,Eugene R.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,58,27,5.0,5/5/2016,Tis place is great. Music at one side of the bar and in the back is a room completely covered in TV's and projectors of all sizes. They have every game available and a very friendly atmosphere.The other aspect: the food is the bomb. The grayson burger hits the spot and fills you up with pure happiness. The loaded tater-tots are a great appetizer to split for two. Will be coming back for as many major sporting events as I can.,1,2,2

I did come at a particularly good time (finals game), but I'd recommend this place to others, even non Bay Area people. Didn't have any but food looks and smelled good. People were well-mannered--which is a huge plus in my book. Bouncer was AWESOME. Only got one drink spilled on me all night (!), therefore GF-friendly.",,,
97,Christina T.,"Chicago, IL",22,97,363,4.0,4/4/2016,"GREAT place to watch games in the East Village.  We came here during the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament - Round 1 and 2.  It was packed, but comfortable.  We sat at the bar and was able to view all four games from our seats.  Food/Drinks: We had the chicken wings and fries. The Grayson has good bar food.  They have a nice wine list for sports bar, with several options for red and white wines.  I had a glass of red wine and  a whiskey sour.  The whiskey sour was good (not craft quality, but good). They have a few rye and bourbon options to choose from, which was more than acceptable for a sports bars.  Atmosphere: During the commercials, the DJ played really good music, which made the experience even more enjoyable.  We came here twice during our stay.  I will definitely revisit to view games or grab a quick drink if we are nearby.",2,,

The staff was super friendly and quick to bring us drinks.  They didn't mind splitting the bill on a bunch of credit cards, and bought us a round of free pickle back shots (we also bought several rounds of shots, as they were only $5 each on Monday nights).  The bar had tons of TVs, which made the game easy to watch.  We also really enjoyed the $2 happy hour slider special (particularly the philly cheesesteak sliders).Only downside (minus 1 star): When calling the prior day to reserve a spot, the staff said they did not take reservations, but suggested we get there at 5pm for a 9:19 game.  We arrived at 6:30, and the bar was basically empty.",1,1,1
99,Ed F.,"New York, NY",1024,31,0,3.0,2/24/2016,Solid pub/sportsbar with good prices and spoecials!  This is more like a 3.5 (YElp hook us up with  half ratings... it's dag needed).  Went there last night and thought the staff was dope. Friendly attentive and really quick.  The place has a gizzilion TV's (i counted) and I particularly liked the big ones had sports and the small ones had videos... I have not watched videos in years.  It was good to see Bieber back... no it wasn't.  It was taco tuesday and my friends had them and said they were solid.  We also had the lettuce cups and that was tasty.  Solid food.  I will have to come back for wings as that is how i define and judge all sports bars.  Solid hood choice.Ummmm i used the word solid too many times in this review,4,2,2

102,Wilson C.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,33,2,4.0,1/24/2016,"You know when the starting lineups on Sunday Night Football introduce their name and their alma matter starting with the prefix, ""The"", its gotta be a good, reputable college. The same applies when you name your bar beginning with ""The"". And fortunately, THE Grayson lives up to its prefix.If you're looking for a solid sports bar with a bunch of TVs, legitimate food, has a clean restroom, and that doesn't cost you an arm, look no further.  THE Grayson got you. There are specials for each day as well as certain deals available everyday.  My buddies got the ""Grayson Special"" which is a mini-keg along with a large plate of bomb tater tots and 36 wings (plenty of flavors to choose from).  Not only was this deal sweeter than Curry's jump shot, but the food was pretty darn good.  I love bar food when it comes to watching sports and cannot keep count of the number of bars with mediocre wings, fries and other greasy treats that simply fill up your gut with no satisfaction.  Can I at least enjoy some good food while agonizing at Fisher's decision to continue to play Calderon on the court?     So you got the food, you got the drinks, you've saved some metrocard money, but now you need to break the seal.  No worries - THE Grayson got you.  No longer will you have to tight cheek it like you do at every other bar just because there's a single occupancy restroom.  They have restrooms for both the ladies and men, multiple stalls, AND it's clean.  This is such a huge plus and everyone knows this is impossible to find at a late night sports bar in the city.Nice servers, the music consists of mostly pop albeit the music is blasted a bit too loud for my liking. For those who are interested, after most of the games are finished, they close up the tables in the back, dim the lighting and it transforms into a mini dance floor with a DJ blasting classic 80s/90s dance pop and other modern pop. It's pretty much a sports bar up until 11pm then they try to sell it as a dance-party bar and has a DJ blasting classic 80/90s dance pop and other modern beats.  I'd only come here for the sports bar because it's been one of the better ones I've been to, but this is definitely a bookmark when I'm around the East Village and need to watch Porzingis throw it down while I throw down on some brewskies and wings.",2,3,2
103,Diana R.,"Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY",96,9,19,5.0,4/6/2016,"It's pretty good. I mean, considering its a sports bar of some sorts. Their specials are great too and their food. I went here today to have the tater tots that they have for appetizers. It was good - but I expected it to have more toppings (cheese) on it than what it had. Wish I could have the cocktails. I'm sure they taste very well.",1,,
104,Kimberly C.,"San Marino, CA",28,399,176,4.0,6/14/2016,"Came here for Game 5 of the NBA Finals yesterday. I called ahead to ask how early to arrive for a table. The hostess accurately estimated 45min, and we got a great seat with clear views to the HD TVs. It was a popular game so I wasn't surprised with how many people were standing to watch.The food here is extra salty to encourage more beer drinking. I highly suggest getting a mini keg if your party can agree on a single drink. It's totally cost effective and makes your table look like a boss. Otherwise, there's plenty of daily Happy Hour specials and Gameday specials. Try to be nice and order stuff a few minutes before halftime. Not only will you beat the rush of orders at halftime, the food will arrive in time to munch over during the break.Our server was super nice, and the DJ mixed some really good music (mostly late 2000's) that blended well with the intros and outros of commercials. The restrooms are down stairs which can get a little trippy if you're already tipsy.",,,

The price was good which is why we chose this place. Don't let the $58 3 hour open bar food you. They give you a choice of 2 shitty beers, mixed drinks that taste like paint thinner and wine. The one star review is not for the drinks though. The staff all around were SO RUDE!!!  The bartender made each individual person come to the bar and get there drink when we held up wristbands to show him. Once I ordered a drink he told me that I couldn't order another one for 15 minutes!! How the hell are you supposed to get your money's worth. I have never had a worse open bar experience in my life.

The happy hour is good, nothing special but good. On Saturdays, I believe, they have two-dollar mimosas which is awesome! It's a beautiful bar but the food is only mediocre.  And I've asked for things on the menu and they haven't had them. It's great for people who want to catch a game, it's a really nice sports bar.

After reading yelp reviews for an hour my friend and I finally decided to try The Grayson. It's your average NYC pub with tons of TVs. The staff was really nice and honest when asked for their food opinions. It was happy hour so I had their house riesling ($6), which was really good. For dinner, I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which was your average pub quality quesadilla -  AKA pretty good! I would definitely go back here for happy hour but I recommend sticking with their more basic selections (quesadilla, mozzarella sticks, french fries) as my friend ordered a burger and was not too pleased.",,,
116,Chuck B.,"Hoboken, NJ",44,1,0,3.0,10/3/2016,This place could be so good if they just kill the dj music.  I went there this past Sunday for some football and beers but we left after the first game as nobody could take the noise.  Tvs everywhere which was great.  The food was good and decent specials for drinks but turn it down man,3,1,1

Usually I don't order anything healthy, going with the loaded tater tots, nachos, burgers, you name it I've had it. Everything though, even their soups and salads are beyond! If you're looking for a great bar to watch a game, especially a Badgers game as they are an official Wisconsin Badgers bar. It's also great just for a quick meal, a drink, or ten, haha.

118,Nelson L.,"NY, NY",70,130,0,2.0,10/19/2015,"Came here to watch football on a Saturday afternoon after seeing the good reviews and trying to find a place that would be an easy commute for all five people in our party coming from different parts of the city. Got here and it wasn't too full, as the Wisconsin game was then over, and we were able to grab seats in the back with good views of the TVs to watch the Michigan game. Unfortunately, that was the highlight. The rest of the experience was very ANTI-sports fan. The beers were overpriced and they didn't have any drink/food specials. We repeatedly ""lost"" our server, who would disappear for 20-25 minutes at a time, which was weird because it was not remotely full. The food was meh and pretty bland. And several times, we (and others around us) asked if we could turn the audio on for the game, which by halftime, 80% of the bar was watching, and they said they couldn't do it for several reasons (it was a UW bar, the game audio didn't work, etc). It wouldn't have been so bad had the music not gone from 90's and 2000's pop (so much Spice Girls) played at a normal listening volume to techno and hip-hop blasted at ear piercing levels. The table next to us had asked them to turn it down several times to no avail. We tried to go to another bar down the street, but unfortunately there were no seats, otherwise we would have left earlier. It just felt like a bait and switch that it markets itself as a sports bar, but then ends up like Murray Hill frat bar.",,2,1

So I would understand if one margarita was charged at regular price (because it was ordered after ""happy hour"") but when we got the bill we were being charged as followed.... Two draft beers two margarita and one pitcher that costed $25 ummmmmm excuse me but we never ordered a pitcher and the margaritas were being charged $10 each after we were specifically told that they cost five dollars and that its wasn't considered a ""well drink"".   Not even because it was their employees mistake did they honor one of the margaritas at ""$5"" All I could say is CHECK your BILL before you pay!!!",1,,

Nachos was humongous! Super good and probably more suitable for 4-5 people. Chicken tenders were good and crisped and seasoned really well. Music is good, they have some tv monitors on the wall were they displayed the music videos to the songs that were playing. Played a mixture of Pop, RnB, Rap and Reggaeton.

148,Leo B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,1,1.0,4/13/2017,"Men avoid. This bar is full of ugly girls and ""ladies nights"" - mostly full of tourist on the weekend. Me and my buds took our money elsewhere",,,
149,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",13,102,7,3.0,4/2/2016,"We stumbled upon this place a while back. Pretty standard fare, food was mediocre bar food, not bad, no biggie.....but too many tv's, tv's, tv's, tv's ahhhhh!",,,
150,Evan O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,0,2.0,4/16/2016,"Confused at the positive reviews. Typically love sports bars but not this one.Food was average, a 2/5. Maybe would have been better if I was actually served the item I ordered.Service was a 1/5. In addition to getting my order wrong, there was another issue. When we asked for the check, I showed my phone to server to claim 10% Yelp discount. She took my phone with her without asking, which stressed me out. Then she brought out our check--without bringing back my phone!!! And disappeared instantly. Had to search the bar for her for 5 min until I found her to ask for my phone. She told me she brought it with the check. I told her no. She found it at the waitor station. Phew, but unacceptable.Sports coverage and viewing was a 5/5. Saw everything we wanted. Plenty of tvs, good seating.",,,
151,Lizzie A.,"New York, NY",123,4,0,5.0,4/2/2016,"Loved the food at the Grayson. Cassie was an amazing,attentive waitress.  It was unbelievably packed for final four games and whenever we turned around she was there.",,,

I have only eaten there once, I think it was the Mac and Cheese Burger, which is sinfully delicious LOL. Over all a fun spot and the bartenders are kind and have senses of humor. Will be back!",,,

154,Allie C.,"Paris, France",376,522,242,3.0,12/6/2015,"Came here lured by the $2 mimosa and the $15 all u can drink special that i read about in other yelp reviews. unfortunately, they weren't doing the $15 unlimited when we were there. they give u a good amount of food and it was decent. not bad, not great. the mimosas were good according to my husband but i didn't think there was much alcohol in the $4 bloody mary's. staff was really good though. someone welcomed us when we walked in and the bartender checked on us often. she was nice. i'd go back if it weren't for the terrible pop music. oh no..",,,
155,Steff L.,"Jersey City, NJ",98,98,25,5.0,7/5/2015,"The Grayson really impressed me! We went for brunch and took full advantage of the $2 mimosas. They're a bit weak, but they feel like such a steal that I didn't mind. They're now offering an unlimited brunch drink special.. $15 for two hours and it includes mimosas, sangria, or bloody Mary's.The service was excellent. We told the waitress that we wanted to make reservations for a birthday dinner and she sent over the manager. He was incredibly nice, helpful and friendly. He also checked in on us during our meal and told us that we were the first people to try a new menu item: the hangover burger. He was very excited to see what we thought, which goes to show how much they care about their food. My boyfriend fell in love with this burger and took it off my hands immediately. The burger has egg, bacon, and cheese on top with buns made of tater tot waffles drizzled with maple syrup. The sweet and salty combo is really interesting and I think a lot of people will love this burger. I actually preferred each component on its own and absolutely adored the unique and delicious tater tot waffles. I would've personally enjoyed the burger more without maple syrup.The burger also comes with fries which I thought were amazing, crisp and perfectly salted. My boyfriend got the ham and cheese enchiladas which we thought were very tasty but maybe a little too saucy since the sauce was a bit overpowering. The menu is recently updated and it's clear to me that the staff truly cares about the food and not just the bar. I will definitely be back for dinner and look forward to trying more burgers!",3,,2
156,Shannon B.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,14,0,2.0,12/3/2016,Good set up.  But I guess I missed the memo that it's cool to blare music at 4:00pm on a Saturday afternoon.  All I wanted to do watch football and have drinks.  Now I have a headache and no voice.  Going to another bar where I don't have to listen to cheesy top 40 blasting in my ear.,,,

158,Olivia F.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/7/2016,I love the Grayson! My friends and I always do trivia here and I have so much fun I also came here for my birthday brunch. The food is awesome and the service is great too! Josh is usually our team's waiter at trivia and he always goes above and beyond. He worked on my birthday along with a brunette waitress (can't remember her name!) but they were both amazing and helped me have the best day! $2 mimosas too-does it get any better?Everything I've had here is delicious but I recommend the cobb salad and anything off the brunch menu! :),,,
159,Tristan D.,"Chicago, IL",255,5,0,5.0,9/12/2015,"Went there early on in the day and again for the Wisco football game at night.

Going back for sure.",,2,
160,Aislin S.,"Charlotte, NC",44,11,2,4.0,12/27/2015,"Staff is great, waitress is very attentive! Burger is great, had the bbq burger, very delicious. Bloody Mary is mediocre, fries are good enough. It is loud, definitely younger crowd for football, nice that they play music on commercials but it is very loud!!

161,Tanya G.,"New York, NY",162,1,0,4.0,4/12/2016,Food was great! Had the veggie sandwich which was delicious - did not get soggy and was a really great portion. Looking forward to coming back here soon :),,,
162,Johanna K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,2/29/2016,"I held my 30th birthday here and couldn't have been happier! The open bar event prices and food packages are hard to beat and the customer service to set things up with LeAnn and Keith was phenomenal! So attentive and accommodating.  Food: The food itself was surprisingly high quality and tasty for typical bar food (calamari, buffalo chicken sliders, chicken quesadillas). They let me take to-go boxes of all the food platters we didn't finish. Space: I got to reserve the back bar space for no additional fee so me and my friends could have space to ourselves and have a dedicated bartender for just us, while still feeling like we were part of the bar. Good for 20-25 people I'd say.Vibe: Loud fun music, friendly staff, filled but not uncomfortably packed.",,,
163,Cheryl C.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,3,2,5.0,12/1/2015,Cool spot to come and watch sports. Dropped in on a Saturday night for basketball games and we got seats at the bar and a super cool bartender. Shame we didn't get his name. Would definitely stop in again if I'm in the neighborhood,,,

170,K. C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,58,82,5.0,8/9/2015,"The Grayson is great. I watched the US Women's soccer team win the world cup at The Grayson. All TVs were tuned to the match. The atmosphere in the bar was lively and energetic. It was so much fun. So, I decided to celebrate my birthday there. We had brunch with unlimited drinks for 2 hour. On top of that, they comped us a bottle of champagne because it was my birthday. The food, drinks and service were excellent. Additionally they had beer pong set up in the back of the bar, so we were able to play a couple rounds of beer pong to close out the festivities. The Grayson has quickly become one of my favorite bars in the east village.",,,
171,Michelle J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,5.0,8/23/2015,"Excellent new spot in my neighborhood! Planned to dance at One and One on Saturday night, but walked by The Grayson and heard music so thought we'd try it out. My friends and I danced to the BEST DJ for 2.5 hours. So much better than the DJ at One and One. Also, the bar wasn't overly crowded. At one point, more people arrived and a waiter took down a table (all of the tables fold into the walls--ingenious!). Prices are on point. My boyfriend and I went back for lunch the next day. On Sundays, they have $4 bloodies and $2 mimosas! The burgers are deeeeeelicious, and I consider myself a bit of a ""burger snob."" They have other specials every day/night of the week.Try this place any day, any time--you won't be sorry! I can't wait to go back.",,,

He was just fun and attentive. he convinced us to get the Grayson deal which includes a Beer mini keg, 36 wings and tater tots. they also have $ 5 Fireball shots that turned out to be a mistake since we had so many. I will definitely come back for another Football Sunday.",,,

174,Michelle K.,"Bronx, NY",148,6,0,5.0,7/30/2015,"The Grayson and the tattooed bartender Sasha saved my night. I was out with friends last week Friday and made the mistake of stopping in to the bar across from the Grayson, La Linea. Tiny, looks like someone's living room, and a creepy and rude fat manager who made our short time there really unpleasant. Thinking that the night was over we decided to try the bar across the street for one last drink and I'm so glad we did. We ended up staying for a couple hours. The bar is swanky but casual, and the service was awesome. The bartender served us quickly, was attentive, and even made a couple jokes to cheer us up. All in all, a great turn around. Will be back for happy hour or brunch.",,,

177,Chetana G.,"San Francisco, CA",88,71,11,4.0,3/15/2016,"great bar with solid food.came here on a saturday night to watch the ACC tournament. there are several group tables in the back and almost each one was taken. they have happy hour every day and good drink specials on game days. coors light/bud light pitchers were $15 and heineken/blue moon/stella/angry orchard/some others i can't rmr were $25 - not a bad deal at all. the food was surprisingly tasty. we started with steak tacos - delicious and a huge portion. cooked perfectly medium and super juicy - but definitely could have used a little cheese, cilantro, and some lime. then we shared the brussel sprouts salad and the cajun chicken burger. both servings were huge. the salad had a lemony vinaigrette but didn't coat the salad entirely so that was a little dry. the chicken patty was cooked well, pretty juicy, but it didn't taste much like cajun. i requested for chipotle mayo and later saw that they tacked on an additional 50 cents for that! i think it came out to $85 total for 2 pitchers, an appetizer, a salad, and a sandwich which overall was not bad at all. likely will come back again. they have $2 mimosas for brunch!ALSO - shout out to the DJ who was playing until 9:30/10. Great mix of 90's 00's and top 40 music.",,,

179,Daisy P.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,5.0,6/18/2015,"I have to start off by saying I wish I could give The Grayson more stars. I went to The Grayson last Friday to meet friends, I expected to only stay for a couple hours, I stayed until close! The music keeps you going all night and the decor of the place is so cool! The staff are awesome! If you happen to stop in you will not be upset with who your bartender is, Sasha, Joe, Stephy, Matt and Evan make the night so much fun! On top of the great staff, who make you great drinks (ask joe for strawberry margaritas, he will not disappoint) the food was fantastic, my friends and I ordered a different items off the menu so we could try everything and not one of us had a complaint. The Grayson burger is perfection!!! They make a homemade bacon thousand island dressing, top the burger with bacon and a fried egg, you won't want to share this burger. We also had the turkey club made in a wrap, the grilled cheese, the volcano nachos and the fireball burger, which were all just as great as the next. I have been back twice since with friends, The Grayson has defiantly become our new hangout spot!",,,

Then not only did we wait an hour for our food to come I had to go find someone to ask what was taking so long. Finally someone came up to us and said your food is in the kitchen, do you still want to eat here? I was pissed at that point, because they basically let our food sit in the kitchen to get cold.

I was expecting it to be crowded, like almost every other brunch spot in NYC, but it was fairly empty. I ordered the Hangover Burger, which was delicious, and did the $15 bottomless mimosa deal. Our waitress (Cassie was her name, I believe) was very attentive and brought us mimosas often, even offering us another after we had paid the bill and used up our 2-hour drinking time slot. The mimosas had maraschino cherries in them, which I thought was a nice touch. Needless to say, my friend and I got hammered. The music was fun too, and one TV was playing the music videos (a lot of 90s stuff). I will definitely be back, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good brunch deal. I also noticed on their menu that they have a bunch of great food and drink deals throughout the week, so I will have to stop myself from literally moving into The Grayson.",,,
