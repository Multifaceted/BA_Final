1,Kristina I.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",113,173,121,3.0,6/8/2018,"Loud, dark, and smelled like a frat house.  Drinks were cheap during happy hour. This place is a little tricky to find if you don't know exactly where it is.  Good for watching sports and being entertained by ChiveTV.Pretty average dive bar.",,,
2,Jennifer S.,"Brooklyn, NY",497,810,99,4.0,6/6/2018,"I would have said this was a medium, meh bar, but they have an amazing happy hour (on the weekends too!!) that bumps it up to great!$4 drafts that are usually $6-8 bucks. Woo hoo!The food is average bar fare - fried food that probably came from a frozen bag. But the service is friendly and the booths are comfy. Great place to watch sports, too.",4,1,4
3,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,5.0,2/19/2018,"GREAT SPOT for super cheap drinks on a Sunday afternoon.Vodka sodas were $5 and all their TVs were playing the Olympics, what else could I need?Service is also fantastic, the bartender really knew how to hook us up.",2,,1
4,Colin S.,"New York, NY",343,5,0,1.0,7/19/2018,"Horrible service. Bartender is some old washed up sleaze-ball who is terribly unfriendly. We then went to the table and the waitress pestered us about sitting in her territory booth (when there were 3 other open tables). Overall there are many other better, brighter and cooler bars nearby.",,,
5,Taylor D.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",127,3,0,1.0,9/22/2018,Went here for a 90s bar crawl. Ordered jack and cokes but bartender didn't have the courtesy to tell us it wasn't included on the specials. Paid $30 for small mix drinks. We asked to have them poured back but he was like too bad. Bartender proceeded to tell staff not to serve us because we didn't want to tip after spending $15 more than we should have on the drinks. Bar staff was incompetent and unprofessional.,,,
6,Ali B.,"Natick, MA",2,75,2,5.0,5/1/2018,"This was one of the stops we made on a food tour I was taking.  We went in the late morning on a Monday and were the only people there.  Therefore, my review is based on that context.  Our group split reuben sandwiches and fries.  Quinn (manager and working the bar) was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.  The chef came out at one point to say hello and make sure we were satisfied.  The reuben sandwich was absolutely delicious but I didn't notice any coleslaw.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to be on there, but I thought most reubens had it.  The fries were incredibly crispy.  It's very dark inside but it's an old tavern and that's the vibe they have.  I'd like to go back during the evening when it's crowded for a more authentic experience.  Quinn said a lot of people go there to watch sports games.",1,,
7,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1913,3.0,1/25/2016,"I've been to Barrow a couple of times and my overall consensus is good bar for sports watching/chilling, meh for food. The bar itself has plenty of TVs all around and a good number of booths for groups to drink and eat. It's well lit and service is pretty attentive. As for the food, I was very disappointed with what I got. I know it's supposed to be bar food but the portions and quality was just below average compared to other sports bars. My friends and I started with the nachos ultima and let's say those nachos were not ultima. They were barely standard nachos. For a name including the word ultima, I would expect it to be humongous. It was just meh. The saving grace was the pork that it came with. The pork was amazing, super tender and flavorful. I also got the alehouse burger. It was a standard burger with lettuce and tomatoes but I found the meat to be overly greasy. I also asked for it to be medium but it was extremely well done. I substituted fries for tater tots for $2 extra. Tater Tots are my most favorite fried potato so I will always get it when I can. I kind of wish I did NOT get it here. It was way too fried. There was more oil than potato I felt. I can feel my arteries starting to clog the more I ate. What a pity. Overall, I will still give this place three stars because it is still an adequate sports bar. My friends got other sandwiches and wings and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I would be willing to go back and try other things, just not what I already got.",6,2,6
8,Laura D.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,2/2/2018,Me and my two friends came here at 11pm on a Friday. We sat at a table as a group of people were leaving. We sat for 20mins till I finally went to the bar. The waitress stopped me from ordering said I was at a table and needed to order thru her. She then refused to serve us drinks and said we were to few go sit at a 6 person table. Meanwhile there are plenty of couples sitting at 4 people tables. 2 is half of 4; 3 is half of 6. How does that make sense? Also it's after dinner hours. So rude.,1,1,
9,Jessica K.,"Douglaston, NY",0,5,0,1.0,1/27/2018,"My friend and I saw a table open and sat down. The bouncer came over and informed me the table was reserved for a group because it was ""first come first serve."" I said the table was empty and therefore first come first serve was respected. Do not come here if you want to enjoy a nice night out with kind people.",1,1,
10,Jonathan C.,"Seattle, WA",421,213,2321,4.0,6/12/2017,"We got to Bleeker Street Pizza and because they received a huge order, they told us that it would be an hour before we could get a pizza so we placed an order and decided top hang here. Extremely glad that was the case because this place was really cool. Nice selection of spirits and they had a couple IPAs which is always a plus for me when visiting places outside of the Pacific Northwest. This was the type of bar I can see myself frequenting if I lived reasonably close. They had a bunch of tvs, a jukebox and the people were really friendly. Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely visit again. Im a fan.",1,2,2
11,Alex B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",45,79,0,3.0,8/12/2017,This bar/restaurant is tucked away on Barrow Street way in the west village. A little tricky to find if you're not familiar with the intricacies of the Greenwich Village streets. A pretty cool place with a combo of old bar and dive bar and pub feel. The beer was nice and cold. We ordered the nachos ultima and they were ok. We had some wings also that were good. The staff was very nice. I would come back here. Maybe not for dinner but a bar food kind of thing.,1,,
12,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",2,144,0,1.0,8/4/2018,"Just ordered a cheeseburger with tater tots on the seamless app.  I can say with full confidence this was the worst cheeseburger I've ever had in NYC.  It was absolutely tasteless, not seasoned at all.  The only positive about the cheeseburger were the onions and pickles which had solid crunch to them.  The tater tots were soggy.  Put the tater tots in its own brown bag so this doesn't happen rather than in a plastic container where they just soak.",,,
13,Liz C.,"New York, NY",76,4,0,2.0,12/21/2017,Takeout was not as expected. The buffalo chicken salad is grilled chicken with barbecue sauce basically! No buffalo at all.  Husbands pulled pork sandwich was soggy and didn't have much meat on it. Mostly just a soggy bun.  Disappointed.,1,,
14,Joshua R.,"Manhattan, NY",122,4,0,3.0,10/21/2017,Old school bar with a digital JukeBox. $4 beers on the weekend and great fries. It's an average bar.,2,,

Updated review","Vivian, our waitress on a Saturday afternoon, was bubbly and accommodating. I'm updating my review because of her. She was attentive and great at helping me find a beer; I ended up trying and ordering a beer I would never have tried - a triple IPA! - if it hadn't been for her determination. (And a shoutout to the bartender, too!)In terms of food, the tater tots are the best deal; they come in a huge bucket, and they are enough to share. The quesadilla, though, was pretty small for the price ($10+) and quite underwhelming. There's a pool table in the basement, but their cue ball was recently stolen. One of the tiniest women's bathrooms I've seen in a while, though they manage to squeeze in two stalls.",6,2,6
19,J K.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,14,0,5.0,4/11/2017,"Ok so my friend pulled up this spot on a whim when we were looking for a new real bar void of NYU 21year olds and i just tagged along not expecting much more than another bar... Amazing perfectly crisp not over cooked tater tots and a couple pints of their beer selection later the bar felt like an old ""cheers "" place with a great group pf old friends west village folks looking for chichi pretentious bar may not love but those of us that love a great vibe will come back again and again!",,,
20,Ellen E.,"San Antonio, TX",116,148,162,5.0,2/21/2017,"Stopped in here real quick for happy hour before a dinner reservation we had down the street. Awesome happy hour specials with $4 pints.

22,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3651,952,2091,3.0,3/28/2016,This place was A-ok.  It was a little bit of a dude-fest but understandable since the NCAA games were on.Stopped in for a drink and bartenders were attentive.  Can't ask for much more.Well done,,,
23,Yoko M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,140,12,5.0,5/30/2017,"Ok, I understand it's a dive bar, but I can't believe it's rated so low!It's one of my favorite low-key bars in the West Village when I want to hang out with friends and be able to hear each other without screaming and getting shoved by crowds of people - which is pretty much always.Waiters are generally friendly, and though I never have real food there, their fried food is the best.  I literally go there when I crave bar food - mostly the tots, which are always freshly, perfectly fried - and come in a giant portion.  But all their other fried food - mozzarella sticks, regular fries, etc - are excellent too.I guess if you go here expecting a nice bar, you'll be disappointed, but it's perfect for what it is.  No pretenses, good music, chill vibe.  Pool table and darts downstairs is a plus.  Side note - the stalls in the women's bathroom are comically small - I'm a small person and can barely squeeze in and out of the left stall next to the sink.",1,,
24,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10944,4.0,12/10/2013,"What do you do on a Tuesday night when you are already drunk and it's almost midnight and you and your buddy are on the way to the train to head to your respective homes? Notice a bar you've never noticed before advertising $3.50 pick-a-pints. And realize, shoot, I actually don't really want to go home, also I had a left-over end of the year vacation day the next day and decided why the heck not!The bar first off is along a street with little cobbled and historical brick houses in the west village. It's not just a bar. It's HISTORIC. Built in 1897 by a Mr. Schaper of sorts. He was a trucker. And apparently the building was used as an old carriage house, became a Latin restaurant, and then turned into a jazz club that hosted Miles Davis way back in the day. So of course I wanted to stay around a little longer and that is your little history lesson of the day. The beer menu here is pretty awesome. For $3.50 you can get Smuttynose, MadElf, Bronx Ale, Arrogant Bastard, Flying Dog, Lagunitas, SixPoint. Just to name a few. I don't even remember what I had because I was in THAT kind of state. This is a true gem of a bar though. Why? Because it was EMPTY. But it was also late on a weeknight. BUT, they have some kind of deal every single day as well. Not just Tuesdays! Happy hour every day is until 7pm for $3.50 drafts on everything. Most days all day long there is a deal on either Yuengling or Miller or Bud. Food I did not try but they have 40 cent wings on Mondays and traditional bar food that is not too over-priced.",2,,1
25,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,3.0,2/13/2017,"I never heard of this place but they have happy hour til 8 so friends and I decided to try it out. When we came here around 7pm, it was relatively empty, which meant we had no trouble getting a large booth. It slowly filled up after that so that's apparently the best time to go! Over the course of the night, I got a whiskey ginger, whiskey on the rocks, and we all did $5 Fireball shots at the end. Well drinks are $5 which is a good deal, but I didn't feel the drinks were strong at all. They seemed really watered down, even the whiskey on the rocks! I was surprised. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, but when two of us ordered things we assumed were on happy hour, she acted like they were and then when we got the bill we realized they hadn't been and she said she misunderstood what we were asking... I'm not sure that's true but will give the benefit of the doubt since the bar was pretty busy by that point. Not a bad place, but you could get a better value for your money elsewhere probably.",2,,
26,Leo L.,"New York, NY",99,377,1225,3.0,2/26/2015,"Came here to grab some drinks prior to dinner in the west village. The place almost reminds me of a ski house lodge, all you're missing is the fire place. Their normal happy hour runs from mon-fri, 11am-8pm4 dollar draught5 dollar wells6 dollar wineMy jack n coke ran about 7 bucks. A good option pre/post dinner if you're looking for a spot w/ a divey charm to have a drink or three at.",10,5,6
27,Tiffani G.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,146,227,4.0,4/8/2016,I came here to meet a friend late last night after work and it took me a little while to even find this place and walk in. It's pretty discrete so you really have to look out for the post on the outside with the horse!I had goose island IPA which was recommended to me by the bad ass bartender named Brittany. She gave me this because I had originally asked for Stella and they didn't have it so she wanted me to try something that tasted similar. Everyone there was so friendly and amazing it was like I made a whole new group of friends in one night! Cool place to go to! Really nice set up and all! Go go go whenever you're in the west village!!! Only thing I'd say was bad is the size of the bathroom. You have to be like 10 pounds and thinner than cardboard to fit in there!,2,,1
28,Kohinoor M.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,121,126,4.0,3/1/2014,"Came here on a WINGS craving and got our fixes for sure!! We had the chipotle BBQ which was very very good. Right amount of saucy, right amount of heat, and flavor for our taste buds. Also had the honey garlic.. But that was waaay too sweet. Tooo Much honey. Didn't like that one. We also got TATER TOTS and I must say I've still been thinking about them (and it's been over a few days since I was there). So fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the out!!!

32,Paul H.,"New York, NY",68,52,29,5.0,2/13/2015,Cool spot.  The vibe is non-pretentious and the beer is cheap.  Just near NYU so it shouldn't be surprising.  Lots of televisions surround the bar which makes for some great sports watching.Update:  Just discovered a pool table downstairs.  I really like this place.,,,
33,Nadia Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",794,753,5280,5.0,12/25/2013,"After walking around the cobblestones of West Village (on heels!) we stumbled upon the Barrow Street Ale House. I was assured it was great place for a beer or two. Or three.Ok, c'mon, $3.50 for drafts during happy hour. I mean it cannot get any happier than that!Well, wait, I have more to tell you!First of all, this is old - in a good sense of the place where history lived and still can be seen, in booth, walls and floor boards... (Fair warning - bathrooms are old too, and super tinyyyyyy!). I absolutely loved old wooden counters and detailing of the bar and booths...The booth are old school, elevated with little steps for your feet, so people seating are on same level as rest of bar-goers. How awesome is that?Food is decent and inexpensive - $5 for huge basket of tatter tots we couldn't even finish? Nice. Quesadilla was pretty good as well, spicy - went well with those beers.And the music - man, I loved my oldies. I could of stayed there all night, listening. It's not too loud, so you can talk, drink, and be merry.Cheers!",9,6,6
34,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,2.0,11/15/2015,"Another birthday gathering....another new bar. Was here a few weeks ago cause a close friend of mine wanted us to enjoy the Green Bay Packers with her for her birthday. Barrow Street Ale House is an okay spot but definitely could use a touch up as far as their bar furniture and TV's which quite a few of them looked damaged in the screens. The drinks are a decent price. Didn't try the food so I can't comment on that but the bar stool seats are a risk to sit on, more so if you have a drink in your hand (fairly wobbly). Nonetheless though, an okay and I'm stretching it somewhat by saying....o-kay spot to go to, to watch games. Not deterring anyone from coming here but Barrow's could very much use some renovations.",,,1
35,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1045,25545,4.0,11/25/2013,"I came with a friend to have a much needed nightcap. It looked pretty mysterious and intriguing from the outside and feeling as if I had been to almost every bar in the West Village but this one...so we had to pop in.It was $3.50 ""Pick a pint"" night! But I'm also pretty confident that pints here are pretty much ALWAYS $3.50, only you can't choose which beer every night...only Tuesdays :).Still, this Barrow Street Ale House easily the most inexpensive bar in the West Village that doesn't force you to interact with college students. No offense college students, but I'm well past that phase of my life and only want to hang with adults. You'll feel the same way one day...until then enjoy your Budweisers and Natty Lights, lol.Our bartender was friendly and this place sells food. We didn't eat here but their mac & cheese menu write-up sounded tantalizing. I like their Irish pub feel, dim lighting, unassuming wooden decor/furniture - it's nice to enjoy a cheap bar that doesn't throw blaring neon lights at you...Also this place also sells tater tots. Yes, I know a lot of bars sell tater tots, BUT I LOVE TATER TOTS OKAY!! I would totally check this place out again next time I'm in the neighborhood.",3,2,2

Updated review","Burger is just terrible. Old bun. Flavorless beef. Old veggies which have been sitting around for a LONG time. Fries that dry and old and taste like rancid oil.

38,Chelsea P.,"Manhattan, NY",68,68,15,3.0,11/29/2016,"This place has been a hit or miss sports bar for me. I went for the last game of the world series and the crowd was great and then a sunday for football and it was almost empty. But it has some of the most decent prices for the neighborhood, so I will most likely keep coming back. It's especially great if you have a group and grab one of the many booths. They also seem to have drink specials going on most nights.",,,
39,Mickey M.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",272,683,43,4.0,5/19/2014,"Divey-ish pub with pretty damn good tater tots and other pub grub. Solid beers on tap, a bunch of TVs, and a crowd that seems to ebb and flow all night. It's always bustling, but it never seems overwhelmingly packed.I think this is a solid post-work spot, and a great option in an area where the prices might be a bit ridiculous. :)",,,
40,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",543,1119,3574,3.0,12/18/2011,"Barrow Street Ale House has some cheap happy hour drafts of about 15 domestic and import beers. Each is $3.00, with the exception of one that I can't seem to remember. But luckily Guinness is included with a shamrock on top!! The good thing is that the happy hour special is available from 11 AM to 7 PM from Monday through Friday.You'd expect a lot of people to come to this bar, but on weekdays, it can be dead with only a patron or two in there. Things don't start to pick up until after 7 pm, and even then, it can sometimes only be a handful on weekdays. Because of that, my guess that is the reason why the tap beers don't taste as fresh.The bar is spacious with about 10-15 stools by the bar, a few TV's airing sports games, several booths behind it, and a huge open standing space large enough to play shuffleboard. There is also a basement where the bathroom is located as another room that has a few TVs, more seating, and a pool table. The bartenders can sometimes be aloof, talking with their coworkers, but they're more than happy to chat.And just as a notice, there is a $20 minimum for credit cards. We weren't told until we were ready to pay, which was a bit of a nuisance as we were ready to go and had only ordered 6 beers ($18). We wound up having the bartender just charge another beer on the card so we could reach the $21 minimum.",1,,
41,Elizabeth W.,"Manhattan, NY",107,4,0,1.0,11/19/2016,I am not sure if the waitress was homophobic or racist but we came in after a group and before another lady. The waitress served the table of girls looked at us then literally skipped to the lady who ended up sitting in the booth after us. As she walked by I let her know we hadn't been served and she apologized and said she didn't know and asked what we wanted. She was the only waitress there and had watched us since we came in. Unsure how she didn't know. Left without getting anything and won't be returning.,,,
42,Marisa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,612,638,2.0,5/28/2013,"Barrow Street Ale House is  a beer/sports bar located on the quaint Barrow Street which only has a few businesses. I imagine there is some history, seems like a pretty old spot. They have a decent, but not crazy amount of beer choices and a few interesting options. I like that there are booths here, but the service was pretty bad when we went on a Saturday night. It was around 9/10pm and it wasn't that crowded, but our server looked miserable. It seemed to pain her to smile. Really tough to have this kind of customer service. The TVs were also unneccessarily loud and it seemed like they were more to entertain the staff than the guests, because I don't think anyone cared about any of the sports (they weren't even NY teams).The smell of wings were pretty tempting, but didn't seem like it would be anything special. I was happy they had bottles of Abita Purple Haze.",2,,

Our waitress comes back with a freezing cold small container of sauce and a new check. If we had received wings with actual sauce on them the extra 1.10 would be ok, if the waitress hadn't thrown the check at us in the middle of the meal the $1.10 would be ok, if the sauce was warm or room temperature the $1.10 would be ok.Well the 1.10 she lost in her tip no sweat off our shoulders...

53,Morris C.,"Manhattan, NY",335,238,750,3.0,11/4/2013,"3.75 stars, but unfortunately not quite willing to round up to 4. I came here because of it's location in order to meet up with some friends before heading out to another place. I happened to come during one of the world series games, which meant $3.50 Yuengling draft pints. Hard to complain about that. There's a downstairs area with free darts as well as long as you give a $20 deposit to the bartender to check out the darts.This place is mostly unremarkable and feels to me like your typical local bar. I don't mean that in a good or bad way, just calling it how I see it. The one thing that stood out to me though was how friendly our bartender was. My cell phone was running super low on batteries, so I asked if they by any chance had an iPhone 5 charger I could use. She was kind enough to actually go get her own personal charger and let me borrow it for the duration of the time I was there, which was SUPER nice of her! She was young, had long brown hair and glasses, but I didn't get a chance to catch her name. In any case, THANK YOU! While I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place again the next time I'm in New York, I would certainly frequent this place if I lived in the area, and won't hesitate to stop in for a beer if I ever happen to pass by again.",2,1,1

The inside was also very hot and humid so we cut our stay short and only had one round.  I didn't check out the bathrooms, but the reports from others in my group had less than glowing reviews.Based on other reviews we should have ordered the tater tots.  In the future if I am taken here against my will, I will be ordering the tater tot basket for sure.",1,,

By that, I don't mean all the clientele, just a handful of idiots who will have the balls to ask you and your party when you're leaving so they can have your table (seriously.

The veggie burger (that last time I tried to order was not on the menu but I hope they still have) and fries are greasy and amazing. I've also had the quesadilla which isn't the best but I always feel like I need to order. It's pretty basic but huge with large portions of sour cream, salsa, and guac on the side.

It was a great place to unwind for us weary travelers who'd walked there from Fort Tryon Park...All the food we ordered was excellent and they had a good selection of beers for reasonable prices.  I got a buffalo chicken sandwich that was huge, tasty and completely necessary after walking many uninterrupted miles.  Five stars for providing a rustic, cozy atmosphere and prodigious amounts of delicious comfort food in the clutch.  Also, they have TATER TOTS.",1,,1

Neither of us are the sports bar type, but this place won us over easily.Food is traditional bar fare, very reasonably priced Expect ridiculously generous and tasty portions served promptly. The fries were so delicious, I had trouble not finishing them! The drinks here are also shockingly reasonable.... the priciest draft we ordered(Blue Point) was $6. Shockingly, Barrow also has a decent selection of whiskeys and quite servicable wines.What got us was the impeccable service from our bartender, Mike. When my boyfriend ordered fish and chips and the staff discovered they were out of malt vinegar, Mike dispatched another employee to go out and bring us some, which we found quite thoughtful. Before then we were happy with his easy and prompt service, but the thoughtful gesture won us over!Atmosphere isn't as douchey as one would expect. Crowds were polite, and even the patrons in line to use the tiny bathroom were nice... since when does that happen in a bar in NYC on a Saturday night? My one quibble is that the bathroom was literally the size of my closet, and that made for some interesting maneuvering.

Dark oak booths, plenty of room to sit, cheap drinks and cheap bar food--that includes TATER TOTS as a side option for any sandwich or burger option.Sure, it's not the most exciting bar on the block. Yes, the floor is a little bit sticky. And sometimes you walk away with your clothes smelling like a frat party, even if you haven't been drinking OR been spilled on. But it's solid, authentic, and feels way more chill than the Blind Tiger, which is always so freakin' crowded and loud. Here, you can have a conversation AND you'll look like a hero when your group tries to wedge themselves toward the bar at one of the Bleecker Street bars. Just say you ""know a place,"" walk them down this quaint, old village street, and you'll be getting ""she knows the BEST places"" accolades for life. Also, even though it does have a basement-of-a-frat-feel, the high booths and low lighting give it a kinda romantic feel that makes it one of those stealth-sexy first date suggestions. After all, a wine bar is way too obvious, but go to a low-key beer joint and it shows you know how to hang.

Updated review","So the mediocrity that I originally felt to this bar dropped dramatically last night as I experienced the most unpleasant experience ever at a bar/restaurant.  There were a couple great life lessons that I learned from a place such as this.  Even though your menu will advertise something and the waitress acknowledges that deal, the owner will change the bill to be double what is owed at his own discretion.  Obviously a bar is entitled to change specials depending on the night or event that may be occurring however I feel it is the responsibility of the bar staff to notify the customers of the change.  ESPECIALLY when they are specifically ordering Happy Hour Beer and 40 cent wings.  Upon receiving the final bill we immediately noticed the discrepancy and asked to speak to the manager.  Mike Z, who also is one of the proprietors of the establishment was as understanding as parents to the Casey Anthony trial.  He explained that he has the right to change the cost at any point.  He also even admitted that his waitress messed up yet would not take any responsibility for his staffs actions.  This bar can be as closely related to a cheap dive hooker that steals your wallet as you go to the bathroom.  Do not visit this establishment unless you like getting screwed in more ways than one.",13,7,5

However, I wasn't expecting the smell; the smell of a litter box.  Though I sat there for two rather cheap beers, the smell remained (though it would dissipate and return at random). I even thought it was me since it wouldn't go away, but no, it was the bar.We also ordered the vegetarian nachos which seemed like a good idea at the time. Lots of black beans, chunks of carrots, and not so warm cheese covered too few chips. When we asked for more chips to sop up the leftovers we were denied. At least the tiny little guacamole had some kick.",4,2,2

I like ale and houses, so this worked for me.The Good:- Multiple TVs.- Huge booths with leather seats. We comfortably fit eight people in one. If you can snag one of these, it's a great option for chilling with a larger group.- Good crowded-but-not-too-crowded vibe on a Thursday.- Waitress was willing to split the tab between multiple cards.The Not-So-Good:- This place seriously has the smallest bathroom I've ever seen. It would be small for a single bathroom, but they've tried to squeeze two stalls into there. You can't get out of the stalls if someone is at the sink. And because of lack of space, the paper towel dispenser is so high that I had to jump to reach it. I get that I'm short, I don't need the placement of a paper towel dispenser rubbing it in :-P- Beer prices are kind of high for the vibe. $7 draft Blue Moon?- $20 credit card minimum. That there's a minimum is fine. I just like being told that before we start ordering, and especially before we start splitting the check.All-in-all, a decent laid back bar in the West Village. I would go back.",2,,1

I wasn't sure how long I'd stay, but the vibe at Barrow Street convinced me to stick it out until the wee hours of the morning. The place is definitely divey, but somehow it never felt dirty... more rustic. I liked that I could see and hear my compadres (yes, I am a 90 year-old lady with horrible hearing). The staff all seemed pleasant, but a bit edgy. Cheap brewskies put us back $3.00 each, others were more expensive. A group was playing 'quarters' at their booth and the wait staff didn't seem to think it was anything out of the ordinary. We also sampled the chips and guac/salsa, which were both adequate and acceptable for the atmosphere. Barrow Street definitely gets a thumbs up from me. As Arnold would say, ""I'll be back.""",2,,1

If you're trying to watch a game, this is also a good place. They have lots of HDTV's surrounding the tables, and will gladly switch a game on for you. They have MLB Extra Innings, so if you're trying to see an out of market game this is the place for you. A quick warning however.

137,Dan F.,"Manhattan, NY",187,257,70,3.0,9/28/2008,Personally...I think that any place that has a wing special is sexy.  Monday is the day and $.40/wing is the price.  Icing on the cake is the $3.50 Sam Adams Octoberfest.  Came here for the wings but the French Onion walked onto the stage and stole the show.One thing about me is Wings & French Onions get me hot and bothered.French Onion:  Best thing about it was the cheese topping...They went to extra care in getting a nice thick layer of cheese on top and cooking it to the point the cheese is harder on the top.  Most places are just lazy and nuke it or just warm the whole thing up.  They went extra and made sure they cook the top more than the bottom for the nice topping.  The portion was pretty good and the soup inside had good flavor.  Homerun.Wings: Ok I'm very critical of wings in general but this place held its own.  We got the 'hot buffalo' style but really enjoyed having the options of other flavors which a lot of places don't have.  Even the wing 'special' was a little more than most (Croxleys is $.10) they make up for it for them being very beefy.  Excellent meat/bone ratio.  They were some nice pieces of fowl.Fries: Might as well served it in a bucket.  Order was huge & tasty.Atmosphere:  ehh...This is kinda where it lacked honestly.  We came in and there was like downer music playing and nobody was talking out loud.  I felt like I was in kindergarten and we had to use our 'whisper voices'.  But it picked up a little later on when football started going on.Bottom Line:  A nice place to meet a couple buddies and shoot the breeze.  Excellent food and good specials.,1,,

I'm not sure why, but it must have just been a slow night, or at least it didn't pick up until later. The place is very earthy, reason being downstairs is just kind of like a carved out cave, with the unpolished walls kind of giving off a weird vibe. From what I remember there was a spacious upstairs, typical of usual bars with the bar on the left and tables on the right. You go downstairs and there's a pool table waiting for a group of guys to just hang out with no windows and if there was smoking allowed it would probably be perfect.

Despite the place being dead during a Giants game, they gave us crap over taking the only remaining booth where we could see our game from, and then didn't seem to understand that we chose their bar to watch the game.If you're going to be a sports bar, and pay for all those TV and sports packages, you've got to understand that's the reason you have people at your bar at 2pm on a Sunday.  If I were the management, I'd clean house with that wait staff.  I saw lots of people leave at half time of their games.Additionally, beware they have a $20 credit card minimum, and don't tell you this before you purchase or have it posted in the bar or on the menu.  Probably because it's against their merchant agreements with the credit card companies.",1,,

154,Aaron K.,"Astoria, NY",45,366,0,4.0,2/12/2010,"I thought this place was pretty chill for a Thursday night. We sat in one of the booths and had good waitress service the whole night. The beers were a little expensive, but the happy hour specials were just right. So 3 dollar pints (brings me back to Buffalo) and some decent food- including Tater Tots made this a good call. The waitress also had no problem splitting the tab. Huge plus, especially when you run up a huge bill. There's a pool table downstairs, which I didn't notice until I made a bathroom run. that's a definite plus if you can snag it early in the night.Overall, thought this was a decent place to have some brews with a couple of friends, and I would go back. and yes, Tater Tots.",,,
155,Wincheng L.,"New York, NY",14,46,0,5.0,8/27/2008,"Barrow St serves up the best wings (IMO) and paired w/ a decent HH special of $3 draughts on Friday until 7pm, it's my default dinner/drinking plan.  Their fries are absolutely delicious too.  It never becomes that crowded so seating usually isn't a problem but if you have to wait, there's a plethora of flat screen tv's playing some sport w/ some overpaid hunk to gawk at until a table opens up.  I can't vouch for the downstairs area since I have never been but I've heard it's the nastiness.  (that is probably why the ladies bathroom is UPstairs).",2,,2
156,Maximillian M.,"San Francisco, CA",186,2205,1,3.0,11/19/2009,"Divey in my book. On the outside, it advertises like it's a cozy pub. Still, can't go wrong with a cool bartender, and a glass of Magic Hat at happy hour.",,,
157,Tim M.,"New York, NY",2,46,0,3.0,4/5/2007,"We discovered this place back when they had ""Beer Mayhem"" nights.  Although they don't have that amazing deal anymore, it's still a great spot for happy hour.  I'd have to agree with Brian G. in the fact that there isn't anything to love about the place, but it has good bar food, a nice selection of beers and it's not too expensive... never had a bad time here.",2,,1
158,Phil M.,"New York, NY",47,63,0,4.0,1/17/2006,"Slightly hard to find, but worth it.  Good selection of drafts, a good crowd, a feeling like home if home had 10 or so beers on tap.",2,,

162,Jon M.,"Charlotte, VT",27,379,4,3.0,11/4/2007,"This bar struck me as the kind of place you go when you'd like to come just short of puking from drinking too much.  It's a touch nicer than a place where you could ralph on the floor, but not that much.  Probably best to do your business in the restroom here.  The wood paneling made me feel like I was in somebody's basement drinking a case of PBR.  However, it does score points for NOT being pretentious.  It just happens to be rather forgettable and thus I will end my review here.",1,,1
163,Brian G.,"Westwood, NJ",4,33,0,4.0,3/8/2007,"There isn't much to love about Barrow St. Ale House, but somehow we always end up there when we make a trip down to the west village.  The basement is dying for a renovation (especially now that the first floor has been jazzed up with fancy booths).  Good beer selection, decent food, reasonable prices, and decent waitstaff.  Perhaps its the fact that this is just a regular bar in a somewhat irregular part of town, but whatever it is, we typically have a good time here, and it seems to be an easy sell when getting a group together.Can get crowded for big sporting events (but so does every bar in NY), but otherwise it's usually not packed.",1,,1
164,Peter S.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",1,20,0,3.0,12/8/2011,"Come on. It's an honest-to-god dive bar with some class on a quiet street in the midst of the Village that has you feeling like you discovered a spot. Selection of beers is solid, and the happy hour prices extremely reasonable a/k/a 1980's level ($3 a beer? Really?)   The bartender was an opinionated hoot who i developed an immediate crush on because she was so sassy. Seriously, you need a place to catch up over a couple of beers where you don't have to yell nor deal with losers from across a river, you could do worse. Fine by me and I will return.",,,
165,Jeffrey K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,18,0,4.0,1/28/2012,"Good beer selection and great deals in the early week (monday: 40 cent wings and $3 Sam Adams, Tuesday: $3 all tap beers (except paulaner)...)  The waitresses and bartenders usually friendly and the food is surprisingly good... especially the large salads.",,,
166,Maggie H.,"New York, NY",15,55,0,4.0,9/16/2007,"If not for navigating the streets of the West Village on my way TO the bar, I would have thought that I walked into a sports bar back in Chicago.  Barrow Street Ale House was the place for football and baseball and ""Friends"" this weekend.  Yeah, random, but the crowd wasn't.  Sports enthuiasts chugging $3 drafts of Bud and Bud Lite from 12-7PM on Saturday afternoon.  The booths along the wall are good for groups and nice to hold your greasy appetizers after the first couple of pints.  They offer limited views of the TVs so position yourself wisely.  The guy to girl ratio is about 5:1, so ladies, if you love that type, that's the place for you.  Beware, a man did quite seriously ask me to buy him a drink.  Great spots for sports.  The women's bathroom is the smallest bathroom that I have ever seen with two stalls and a sink.",1,,

168,Tiffany L.,"Denver, CO",308,26,0,2.0,10/21/2010,"During the fall for the past few years, my friends and I show up here about once a week. It's pretty pathetic that the staff never seems to recognize us even though we tip really well.  Maybe bc there is an extremely high turnover.  There is a VERY ANGRY bartender there on Sunday evenings.  She is rude to patrons and we have actually witnessed her screaming at her waitresses.  She always has a pissy look on her face and the owner would probably be doing the bar a huge favor by getting rid of her.  She argues requests to turn on playoff baseball games going into extra innings when every other tv is on the same football game.  (Really?  You can't change one single tv?)  The food here is great for bar food, and they have good deals on pints, but otherwise, BOOOO, especially to the icy B bartender.",,1,

170,Joe V.,"Canton, MI",50,415,2,3.0,10/18/2008,"Typical pub. Good food. Service can be spotty if it is crowded - like for football on Saturday. Reasonably priced. If you sit at the bar you will get buybacks...if you have a waitress you won't. Place smells a little funky at times. The basement is cool and has a few games (darts, pool, etc.) but it was really hot down there the last time I was there.",,,
171,Joshua H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,28,0,2.0,3/10/2009,"Not as good as it used to be before they renovated.  Beers are still reasonably priced and the food (the 40 cent wings on Mondays are a good deal) is still decent, but the crowd is unbearable.  It's just one popped-collar douchebag or bleached-blonde airhead after the next.  Used to be you had to go to Hoboken (or, at the very least, Murray Hill) to ""enjoy"" hanging out with that set, but not anymore.",2,2,1
172,Tim M.,"New York, NY",49,37,40,3.0,9/16/2006,"not really impressed with this place. maybe b/c chumley's highly recommended it as they were closing. anyways they have a decent beer selection and surprisingly tasty wings but the place is pretty dingy inside and there honestly isn't much to it, pretty bland actually. music selection was borderline terrible there when we stopped by.",1,,1
173,C. C.,"Orlando, FL",0,25,3,2.0,12/13/2011,"Went here after another bar seemed to be a little too crowded for me. Hard to tell what its like from the outside, but upon entering reminded me a lot of the ""Always Sunny"" bar. Nothing special, but not the worst of  ""dive bars"".  Was one of the only people there so had a seat at the bar.  They had $3 drafts,which I found pretty good considering the beer list.  They had a handful of decent craft beers, nothing crazy, but not all domestics either. They also had a nice little selection of bottled beer; including chimay, duvel, etc.  The bartender girl didn't seem to pleasant, even though I was basically the only person in there.  I don't ask for much, but at least try to force a smile and pretend you're glad to have my business.  She disappeared to the corner of the bar until I needed to order something, kinda annoying, but whatever. I didn't want anything too heavy so ordered some soft pretzels.  They came out with a large amount of their mustard for dipping.  Orignially was happy to see this, I like mustard and hate to have to ask for more.  Dipped a piece in and took a bite...""Holy ****!""  Took a few seconds before a huge cloud to move up my sinus cavity and singe my nose continuing until it caused tearing. Continued for quite a while. Needless to say used not even 1/50 of the musatrd they gave me.  Now I'm not a baby, I actually like spicy food....but this was insanity.  After she takes my plate, I ask her if the mustard was a joke.  She says "" Oh yeah, probably should've warned you about that, huh? It's crazy""  yeah, ya think?  Note to ownership, if you wanna serve something that is basically condensed horse radish...you need to mention it. God forbid someone takes a large amount of that and they can't handle it. It really can do some damage.  Just a thought.  All in all, nice place for some happy hour drinks...but wouldn't make it a night there.",,,
