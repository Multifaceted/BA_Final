0,Susan F.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",1,12,7,5.0,8/3/2018,"Great place for a snack when you don't know what to eat nearby. A lot of the food in this area is either on the pricier side or unhealthy. At cafe r you can create your own salad from the salad bar or get food from the hot buffet bar. They also have pre made stuff like sushi and sushi bowls. Towards the front there's a pizza station and also hot meals, smoothies and wraps prepared especially for you. The place is massive so it could get overwhelming. But there's lots of space for seating and it's pretty clean.",,,
1,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,2.0,8/10/2018,"Let's start with the pros of this place: it's open 24/7. There are few places around to get a snack (as opposed to a full meal) and a cup of coffee past a certain time in the area, so I can appreciate that.That being said, R Cafe was disappointing. It wasn't awful, but fits the ""Meh, I've experienced better"" description perfectly. The employees seemed bothered to give you service (and I do understand that nobody wants to be working at 4am, but alas) and the offerings are mediocre.It isn't horrible or anything especially compared to fast food, but there are so many options in NYC, so unless you need a cup of coffee after midnight, why come here?",,,
2,R C.,"Washington, DC",72,43,51,4.0,6/11/2018,This is a great place for when you are in a hurry and you are with other people and everyone has a hankering forSomething different .. this place is a smorgasbord and you can find something for everyone. We were even treated to loveMusic as we enjoyed our breakfast.,,,
3,Sara G.,"Livingston, NJ",3,2,0,2.0,11/14/2018,I LOVE this place and come here everyday as do all my coworkers. I get the same salad every time. Last time I asked for the fresh mozzarella balls and the guy put the shedded mozzarella in (it's VERY different) and when I tried to stop him he yelled at me and saying I don't have a choice. He said to get over it and they're not getting it anymore and that's it's too expensive. ...are you kidding me out of all this stuff in there? And it's always slammed in there and the prices are higher then any other deli.. sorry I think it's bullshit I have to bye mozzarella separate for my salad they won't even fill.,,,
4,Chunjai K.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,221,1720,4.0,10/8/2018,Nice salad bar place. After my friends and I went to nightclub and wanted to eat something before separating. We went to this place and they have so many food and salad to choose. There is area to sit and not crowded late night.,2,,2
5,Young S.,"New York, NY",32,86,0,4.0,11/7/2018,I went for the chicken teriyaki during lunch time and the portions are HUGE.  They offer a wide variety of foods and different ethnic cuisines.,,,
6,Takeshi Y.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1191,226,5649,5.0,5/25/2018,"OVERVIEW: CAFE R is New York City's largest international food court (11,000 square feet). It is made of the signature giant scale Pay-Per-Pound-Buffet Restaurant in addition to many specialized small size delis, that serve hundreds of popular and delicious dishes, including Americas, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Indian, Mediterranean, etc. CAFE R opens 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and also offers all kinds of popular foods, snacks, and drinks, that can be found at any supermarkets. It is super crowded during the peak lunch time. (1). FOODS:The variety and quality of foods and dishes served at CAFE R is truly phenomenal and breathtaking. When I first visited here many years ago, I was simply shocked to see all these amazing dishes around the world served here in one place - I really felt the powers, strength, and obsession of this amazing city for keep leading this nation. Personally, I really enjoy their Pay-Per-Pound Buffet dishes because I love tasting a variety of cooked meat dishes and a variety of fresh fruits for my each meal. They serve these huge variety of foods 24/7 (although the quality of some of the hot cuisines at the buffet section may not be the prime condition late at night, compared to the lunch time here. Specifically, this was the case for the oxtails - only the ones with tiny bit of meat were left, when I dined here after 9:30 PM today. It was still very tender and tasty, though. see my attached photos.)  -American Cuisine (Burgers, Steaks, etc.) -- all the popularitems-Japanese Cuisine (Sushi, Udon, Traditional Mochi Cakes, etc.) -- The packaged sushi are surprisingly reasonably priced -Chinese Cuisine (Lo Mein, General Tsao's Chicken, Fried Rices etc.) -- Some of these are real Chinese restaurants' quality, in my opinion.-Italian Cuisine (Pasta Bar, Pizza, Italian salads, etc.) -- very popular here-Mexican Cuisine (Burritos, Quesadillas, etc.) -Indian Cuisine (Curry Chicken, Kingfish, etc) -- do not miss the Goat Curry if you like spicy Indian curry dish (This is my friend's favorite here.)-Mediterranean Cuisine (Gyro, Shish Kebab, etc.) -- I think the quality of these are far better than what you get on the streets of the Times Square. NOTE: During the peak lunch time, CAFE R is packed. the buffet section moves rather quickly BUT you may see a long line particularly at the sections of the Salads, Sandwiches & Wraps, Smoothies & Shakes.   (2). INTERIOR:The interior of CAFE R is NOT romantic or fancy/upscale in any traditional sense. Nevertheless, it is clean, well-organized, functional, casual, and well-maintained. You do NOT see any giant bronze statues or pricey artworks created by the famous painters on display here. In short, it is very casual but professionally managed American. Each table is rather small/tiny and with strange geometrical design on the top. (see my attached photos.) CAFE R has two floors of seating areas.  I usually dine at the first floor simply because it is just convenient.  Bathrooms: CAFE R has two separate clean bathrooms in the back. You need the secret four digit code from the cashier to press the door buttons for opening the door of these bathroom to get inside.  (3).SERVICES: CAFE R operates 24/7. They accept all the major credit cards with over $7 purchases (this amount is very common in New York City's restaurants.) The cashiers seem all very well-trained and friendly, as far as I saw them. CAFE R also offers 24 hour free delivery service. Nevertheless, what makes CAFE R so unique and distinctive is the free live music performance by the local professional musicians during the lunch time. I particularly enjoy their awesome Jazz music sessions, personally.   (4). PRICES: Flat rate of $9.99 plus tax for 24/7. There are no discounted prices for after lunch hours, unlike its competitors with shorter operating hours. This rate is quite high but expected by considering the extremely busy and expensive prime location right by the New York Penn Station, and such a high quality of foods they serve. (Although I must admit some of the foods at the food station for the buffet may not be as great as the peak lunch time. I saw some of them got too dry, for an example late at  night, when I dined there.) Nevertheless, overall, their foods' quality is still good (far above average) all day long for justifying the price even at the 1am in the morning, like I dined here. I have absolutely no complains about it, personally. I highly recommend CAFE R to my friends. Please do not miss the free live music performance during the lunch time here, when you are in the area!

9,Danny O.,"Manhattan, NY",12,126,0,3.0,3/29/2018,"This is a big emporium with tons of choices.  There's an udon bar, sushi to go, a large hot and cold buffet, japanese grill, korean grill, pizza, smoothies, deli, american grill, breakfast station, wings, indian, and probably a couple other things.  So you have a lot of choices. Most of the quality is just meh to average, honestly.  It's not super great.  But it's fast and convenient, and there really are a crazy number of choices, so that flexibility is nice.  2.5 star quality, rounded up for convenience.  Pricing is not bad for lunch.",,,

11,Ryan T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5,97,64,4.0,3/8/2018,"This is my go-to place for lunch. I've been coming here for about 2 years now and haven't had a bad meal yet. They have a little something for everyone and the cost is fair, around $10 pp. The buffet food is good (well-maintained with a fast turn over during breakfast and lunch) but the stations are what keep me coming in. My favorite dishes are the Hot & Spicy Pork Belly, the Bim Mi Bop (Korean Station) and the Assorted Sushi Bowl, all which are big enough for 2 meals. Like every market of this type, the grocery items are priced a bit high, but for that you can stop in Jacks. Environment is loud and upbeat, a nice pick-me up after sitting in a quite office all morning, just don't expect to have much conversation if you sit near the live band.",,,
12,Kylie L.,"New Providence, NJ",3,66,1,5.0,9/29/2018,"+Great place for meat lovers.

14,Kasper T.,"København V, København, Denmark",1,53,50,3.0,9/11/2018,I ate breakfast here several times while staying in a hotel nearby. I could see all the cops and construction workers going in to have their breakfast so I went in there too. The quality was quite good and exceptional when compared to the prices. On weekdays  you even get a free cup of coffee.,,,
15,Winnie C.,"Queens, New York, NY",8,91,370,3.0,3/16/2017,"If you can't decide on what to eat during lunch this is the place to go. There's a lot of different options, there's the hot/cold buffet, salad, sandwiches and different cooking stations. A jazz band plays near the cashiers so you can hear the music throughout the store. Not ideal when your sitting there to eat with someone since the music is SO LOUD. But it is a different touch compared to other delis. Very spacious to walk around and think of what you want to eat. Today I decided to go with Indian food. I couldn't really tell what they had displayed so I just ordered off what was on the paper menu. Little did I know there was Chicken Curry, which is what I wanted but it wasn't on the menu. I ended up with the Goat Curry instead. The sign said it came with either rice or naan. I chose the naan. It also came with two vegetable sides, cucumber tomato salad and a cooked/grilled veggie. Neither of it was Indian, but it came with the meal so I'm not complaining. When I opened my meal I was a little disappointed, the naan was NOT naan, it was two warm pita bread. I guess to them it was just bread and it was similar, but it was the kind that you can wrap a gyro in. On to the Goat Curry, it was pretty good. Spicy, flavorful, enough sauce to dip the bread. Can't expect too much I guess since this is a deli and not your traditional Indian restaurant.I would go back for the value of the food and it's not terrible.",3,1,
16,Karen L.,"Jackson Heights, NY",106,103,223,3.0,3/22/2017,"This is your typical midtown Korean lunch eatery but on steroids really because this place is huge. You have your lunch buffet that goes by weight, $8.99/lb, and your various made to order grill stations. There is your usually Korean food station, Chinese, burger grill, sandwich station, as well as the brick oven pizza, Indian grill, Mediterranean grill, sushi, and etc. there is also the juice bar and even dessert station, with cakes and pastries. If you came here without knowing what you wanted, you'd probably have an even harder time deciding what to get with all these options. Clean and modern design with seating on both ends of the store and even upstairs I believe. There was also a live band playing during lunch. Food is decent, not great but not bad. Decent lunch for $10-15.",1,1,

18,Lady C.,"NY, NY",75,249,29,1.0,1/16/2018,"If you are a Salad eater like me, you will encounter Cafe R's ""Salad Nazi"".  If you want to order a health meal and be humiliated in the process with the worst customer service EVER, then beware!The man with the facial scar who makes the salads must be the rudest salad maker in NYC and will make you regret that you took a minute of his time to order your lunch. He makes ordering your lunch the most intimidating experience. Dare to ask a question or even ask how many ingredients you have left and he will immediately snap at you. I do acknowledge that he is very efficient which could be the reason Cafe R keeps him but I know Cafe R lost my business which is the equivalent of $2,880 (based on daily consumption of a large salad for most work days with a drink). The food is fresh and good but the service is DEPLORABLE and a paying customer should not experience this type of service, even if its lunch time. It is not acceptable.",2,1,
19,Cindy C.,"New York, NY",73,26,240,4.0,4/12/2018,"Lunch options galore!! Their buffet is nicely laid out with enough variety and space to walk around, even when crowded. One of my favorite buffet options are the vegetable dumpling. Apart from the buffet there are several stations with food made to order such as salad, sushi, Mexican, gyros, burgers, Noodles etc. It's a great place to grab a quick to go lunch or sit down, at noon a live instrumental band plays, which is nice but can get a little loud if you want to have conversations during your meal.",,,

Prices are reasonable, and sometimes you may be offered a free water if you spend a certain amount on the buffet. There are also ample registers to check out - located in the front and back (past the grill). There's some seating but this is usually accompanied by loud jazz music.",,,
21,Reva R.,"New York, NY",391,163,2444,4.0,9/14/2016,"Excellent, clean place. Large multiple areas for seating. Entered on West 31 Street, but I think you also have an entrance on W.32strert. Huge space, nicely done. Freshly made at lunch time 12:45pm. Enjoyed an under $4!!!! Fabulous & so delicious lunch/snack. Wanted to just try a little to decide if things were as good as they looked, and yesssss, they are!I had the freshly made, lightly egg battered, White Fish, & a bit of lobster with melted cheese. Both really good. Where on earth can you get this for $.Nicely made food items. Lovely looking fresh fruit salads, too bad a woman was tasting it!! NO TASTING!! Minus ONE STAR because, I feel they should have a self serve water put her, or huge covered water container with a spout, like Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken has--it's even filtered water at Blue Ribbon.I asked for a cup for water, figuring they'd at least have self-serve pitchers, but she said to ask the Juice Bar station....so I walked the 1/4 mile lol, place is huge & nice, juice bar pointed to their sink behind counter. I said never mind. I got the feeling he would have let me go behind counter & use sink to fill my styrofoam cup. Just a feeling.So MY SUGGESTION is to have a self serve COLD Water area. Good eats are here. So I actually ate here for under $4, which is also under $5!  Lol",6,,2

23,Nina R.,"Fairfax, VA",324,332,1965,4.0,4/7/2017,"First, I haven't eaten here.  I merely saw it right after eating a huge kale salad from someplace else and automatically regretted my former choice .  I was stuffed and couldn't think about possibly eating, so I walked through and I was immediately impressed.  Clean, organized and well laid out.  There is just about every type of food stall, made to order food, hot grills, burgers, made to order pasta dishes, fried chicken, pizza, hot stoves, an enormous salad bar, fruit bar, fresh squeezed juice bar, hot food bar, suishi...I mean everything.  This place is beyond massive.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  It's a huge, industrial, sleek and modern cafeteria - gourmet food court.  AND - you can enter on both sides of the food hall, I believe on 32nd and 31st.  Something crazy like that.  I felt like such a tourist because I immediately began taking photos.  I hope I didn't weird anyone out!!  I asked someone working a grill what time did they close?  His response, ""We never close.  We're open 24 hours.  You can come anytime!""  What the...!?!?  Unheard of in the DMV!!!On my next trip up to NYC, this will definitely be my first stop for lunch upon arrival to the city.",3,1,2

I got a bacon egg cheese which was typical but the bacon was thick cut and not old so I think it's of better quality than any bodega you might frequent. The paninis I 've gotten thru meal pal aren't anything to write home about but I'm not expecting the best food in the world here. My favorite part: the live music. Usually an assortment of 3 piece jazz and just the music alone is a reason to come here. I wish my breaks were longer so I could just listen all afternoon.

Updated review","This review is super late. Instantly as we walked inside I smelled the scent of bacon and new this was the right place. To my right there was a fresh fruit bar to create any morning smoothie of your choice. In front of us was the buffet full of all your breakfast choices including pancakes, french toast,  home fries, eggs, sausage, fresh fruit, etc.  The buffet was 8.99/pound.We went over to the hot grill section to purchase a breakfast combo. I got the combo #14 that comes with French  toast, bacon and scrambled eggs with cheese. The total with tax was $ 7.04.  The meal was filling and at a great price.  Plus it is one block away from Madison square garden and Amtrak. We were able to eat a yummy breakfast and walk to the train station. I will make sure to stop by again.",,,
29,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",153,765,9976,4.0,4/20/2016,"One of my colleagues Brad B. mentioned about Cafe R and I just had it bookmarked for a week or so. I came here for my lunch hour. Its so convenient on the same block as Jack's. Woah baby what a spacious food court with stations on both sides of different varieties of food from Pizza, Burgers, Chinese, Mexican, Sushi, and so many more of which I took a quick glance. I went for the Hot & Cold Buffet and I remember to take a plastic container than styrofoam. Definitely a lot of more choices for the Hot Buffet than I have seen at as the cashier agrees with me as it was her 4th day hehe. I showed her my Yelp check-in 10% off for Cooked Food but wouldn't it be everything since they have to cook the raw ingredients...am I right? lol There's more seating upstairs as well some tables by the cashwrap area. I noticed a live band going to perform as I was leaving Cafe R. If you are around the neighborhood and starving, come here since its open 24/7!",11,8,11

There is a wide variety of dishes and food stations with more Asian offerings. But can still get salads, hot cooked buffet, sushi, noodles, soups, pizza, sandwiches, etc. the price per pound is a little less expensive than some of the other Midtown places like this and they give you a free water.

The biggest problem is choosing among the many options. It can be very busy at lunchtime, but at any other time there's always plenty of available seating.  The only reason I can see for negative reviews about this or that dish, or how it's prepared, is because there are so many choices.  When so many options are available, there's bound to be something that doesn't suit everyone.

Everything is pretty well done, prices are surprisingly reasonable, it feels a little more upscale than a Cafe Hestia or a Cafe Duke or whatever (live jazz!), and they'll just give you an entire goddamn fish.

Updated review","I was craving a pad Thai and the restaurant I usually go to closed down so I came here. The chicken pad Thai was not good! It tasted of curry, I asked for it to be spicy so they added siracha while cooking but it wasn't even spicy at all. I can't believe i ate a curry chicken noodle. Not satisfied, not happy and will not order from the Chinese station again!",1,2,1
48,Victoria C.,"New York, NY",380,92,173,4.0,5/25/2016,"This place is great, especially for lunchtime on a workday. You can get a made-to-order salad for $7 - that's for the small size. The small size comes with 6 toppings of your choice - that includes meats. I got a small salad today with chicken, shrimp, chunks of fresh mozzarella, celery, and more - it was filling and cost efficient. Very cheap compared to other places in Manhattan.The buffet area is also awesome here. They have so many options - from salmon to breaded shrimp, from spare ribs to spring rolls, from linguine to chicken tenders. So much variety. It's $8.99 a pound - not too bad. It's really worth it for some things in their buffet, like the salmon, which is usually much more expensive. They also give a free bottle of water for buffet if you get over 1 pound.I haven't tried out the other stations yet, but I'm looking forward to it! Like the sushi station, the grill, breakfast, etc. This food court like place is a must go!They also have live music here which I thought was strange but pleasant. Plus, if you're coming from around the area for lunch, ask them if your company has an employee discount! :)",3,,1

I had food for from the salad bar. I recently experienced an event which disgusted me so much that I will NOT return to this restaurant again. After having lunch I used the bathroom. While I was at the sink washing my hands I noticed there was no signage that states ""EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK"". A female employee came into the bathroom she used the bathroom and didn't wash her hands. I immediately contacted 311 and filed a complaint with the NYC Department of Health.Later that evening I got food poison. My symptoms included nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.     The health and safety of customers is NOT a priority for Café R. A standard of cleanliness is NOT maintained. On August 23, 2016 the NYC Department of Health gave Café R a letter grade of ""B"" Card number-FB0052356.A letter grade of 'B' indicates 14 to 27 recorded violations at the restaurant. The majority of NYC restaurants currently fall into this category. At this level some of the violations are noted as 'Critical' by the Department of Health--common Critical violations include ""Cold food held above 41°F (smoked fish above 38°F) except during necessary preparation;"" and ""Sanitized equipment or utensil...improperly used or stored.""I highly recommend that the NYC Department of Health & Hygiene investigate their health and safety license, as well as the cleanliness of their food serving areas, kitchens and general hygiene of the staff preparing and serving the food to customers.

They have different sections for different type of cuisine. Pizza, salad, Korean, Chinese, hot and cold buffet food, premade sushi, sandwiches, and typical grocery store items. Tons of premade breakfast items available all through the day. Such as muffins, cookies, different choices of coffee and teas. There's a Jazz band that plays during lunch time, which is nice but it gets super loud. You wouldn't be able to hear the other person speak. Lots of tables if you want to sit in to eat. The back has tables and I believe there's a downstairs as well if you want to get away from the loud music. I would not recommend the pasta here, if you like your pasta al dente. They make it a bit too soft. However the portion is pretty large, comes with bread as well and cheese. You can make your own quesadilla, 1 meat and 3 different choices of veggies. It comes with chips on the side as well. The hot/cold food don't change too often so you can expect the same food daily.",1,,

It's Manhattan!   Cafe R saved the day.  It has something for everyone... Buffet style.  Most of us love ethnic cuisine and it had a variety of options.It was $8.99 a pound if I recall correctly, so you have to watch little ones so they don't heap heavy stuff into their take out box that they won't eat.Every so many pounds you get a free bottled water, too, so with that we were able to just spring for a few extra sodas so it did not end up being too pricey either.  (It's usually the drinks that get ya when dining out with a big family group).It was clean, spacious and food quality was good.  I personally loved the prepared salads.  It was not overly crowded for the few days we were there (which included both weekend and week day.) You do have to walk your own tray to the table but we found seating in the upstairs.   The hours are great.It also doubles as a grocery store so that's handy.  If you are visitors and your hotel is near there (Madison Square Garden area) it may occasion a few trips.Also next door to Jack's....

Updated review","UPDATE--even worseThe same problematic order service continues. This time I bring to manager, Casey's attention and he does nothing. Nods his head, shakes back and forth. I don't get any sort of real acknowledgement, offer to discount a meal let alone even a sorry. He didn't even walk over to his staff to let them know there was a problem. So now I'm officially done. I would rather visit other delis that may charge a dollar more just to be treated like a customer and receive real service. This place is lucky they are so close to Penn and probably don't need a loyal local base as tourists will use then regardless. Cafe R, R for repulsive.Writing about my frustration of service not food. This is my 4th or 5th morning as of late that when I ordered my standard egg white, peppers, onions, and American cheese omelette, they have forgotten the cheese EVERY TIME! I have to remind them and then they take extra time by throwing it back on the grill. Other delis in NY are slinging breakfast with efficiency. No one has time to wait 12 mins for their food and be because they are consistently incorrect and poor listeners. The only reason why I've continued to visit is because they don't rip you off for the cost of an omelette. I don't want the toast or potatoes and they give you a fair price for just what you want vs other places in the that seemingly still charge you the full platter price when you only have a 1/3 of the meal. So that's pretty much the only reason why I even deal with this ineptness. Just know to allow you buffer negligence time in the AM when you order. And this wasn't just me. The orders around me were all messed up. A guy wanted a roll and got it on a bagel. A girl didn't want hash browns on the sandwich and what do you know, piled high. So yeah, all in all, yeah, re-evaluating my spending choices...",1,2,1

Worse was to follow, one of my dining companions ordered a cheese burger, the chef was so lazy he left the wax paper on from the processed cheese slice, when the box was opened the burger was inedible as it tasted gross with the wax paper integrated with the meat and cheese. Within 10 minutes he started to feel unwell. However the biggest disaster was to unfold overnight, my other friend dining with us ordered the calamari, due to the unusually heavy seasoning it wasn't possible to tell the fish was off. The night has been spent vomiting this seemingly stale fish. While there we observed one lady who took a coke bottle back to the register saying it had a funny smell, the Korean looking man behind the counter took a sniff and said it was fine. Just as other reviewers wrote about the variances in pricing, my pizza according to the board looked like it was $2.50 a slice, was charged $3.80, when I questioned it the man wasn't interested, he just wanted payment. I notice now the pizza slice menu now has more expensive night rates added in pen that are very unclear to read and the original prices now say lunch in the same difficult to read prices. Many of the dishes were unavailable due to it being the weekend. If the Department of Health get a chance to visit and observe the buffet not being temperature checked regularly, no disposable of old buffet food after x hours, food hygiene, preparation and training methodology I think they will find several non compliances. One to avoid, unless your brave enough to risk your health of course.",4,,

I had a chicken burrito and had a stomach ache. The pizza is well below NYC standard. Hummus is a joke.

93,Paul C.,"Manhattan, NY",322,748,206,2.0,9/10/2015,"This is a pretty bad place, though not without some redeeming characteristics.Let's just focus on breakfast, since much of what goes on here is similar to lunch.This place is a maze, it's huge and it's difficult to figure out where to go to get what you need.In the morning, the hot breakfast area is definitely hidden. And no one working there is going to help you find it.When you do get there, the staff are mostly disengaged. You'll put in an order that they kind of understand. Then a minute later they'll say ""what roll?"" You'll repeat: an onion roll. Then a minute later they'll say ""egg whites?"" Wait, you still haven't started my order yet? No they haven't, and it'll take another five to ten minutes for you to get it after that. Many times you'll wait around a few minutes to find they are out of feta cheese and you just wasted a ton of time.Another issue is price. This place is near Penn, so of course they're going to gouge you. It's not disgustingly expensive, but it's definitely not cheap. (Lunch is more reasonably priced than breakfast, though.)The people at the checkout aren't exactly peppy, happy people either.Here's the positive: It's a very clean space.

Last week I took a chance when I was strapped for time and was pleasantly surprised by the new space. Seems much brighter and more open, live music is a plus or a minus depending on your taste. I would still never stay and eat here since I end up smelling like food even when I don't linger, but I am shocked to say Cafe R is now in my regular rotation of Herald Square lunch spots!Mainly because you'd be surprised how hard it is to get a simple meal of meat and veggies in this area. If all you want for lunch is a small amount of protein with some roasted veggies, your best bet would be to go to Dig Inn and pay $10+ for a plate of food that, while tastes very good, isn't always what you expected nor is it the best value considering I can get some rotisserie chicken and roasted brussels sprouts for about half that much at Cafe R.

Wide selection of food but hit or miss...loved the teriyaki bowls, but some of the wraps and sandwiches are disappointing, not as good, leave a bad after taste.

Updated review","Rating of ""C"" makes me wanna puke and food is mediocre if not poor at best, not to mention sometimes a side of metal chippings and plastic are thrown in as a bonus  in your buffet items.Breakfast Lunch Items at the Buffet:-Hash Browns are NASTY, oily, and disgusting-Why are there Chicken Drumsticks for breakfast??-Eggs are Soggy and Bacon seemed old and dry-Sausage and Potatoes tastes like SHIT-Every day is probably the same type of food-Quality of food is horrible not to mention HEAVY on everything (cream, sauce, cheese, etc). Even my high school cafeteria serves better food than the crap served hereAtmosphere:-Despite being a large space, it's so dirty in there. The tables are never cleaned, lots of ghetto people frequent there, and homeless people walk in and eat some of the food from the buffet. While in line, you see the most obnoxious ghetto people starting from ghetto ass people working at JC Penney's across the street bitching about their 'discounts' as well as clueless European and out-of-town tourists complaining about why their plate is so expensive (depsite them having stocked it with a pile of heavy fruit items like melons, pineapples, canteloupes) or not being able to understand the NY sales tax.Management:-Non-existent. I highly doubt managers here even received any professional training and I can swear that they're not even FoodServe certified like myself. AVOID this place at all costs. Having said that, the owner is a very nice man and his wife is a very sweet lady. Don't go there until there's new management and the grading improves. A rating of ""C"" tells me that the manager is definitely NOT doing his job right and really doesn't give a damn either.",3,1,

It's basically a food court but with plenty of options. There's a lot of seating and the lines all move really swiftly. I wasn't that hungry so I grabbed a sandwich from the sandwich spot. I got honey turkey with various add ons. I was quite disappointed when I get my sandwich as it was on wonder bread and made me feel like I paid $10 for something I could've just brought from home. I didn't have the best experience at this location because of where I chose to eat. I will definitely go back and try out some of the other places. The other thing that annoyed me was that there was an employee working there and he kept coming around to everyone leaning over them as they are waiting and telling them things.

Place the order and into the fry pan it goes.  Stirring around in in front of me a strong sent of  kochujang starts to permeate the air and I start to get excited.A heaping load of the stir fried chicken is placed into a black take out container with a about half a cup of rice.  The box is nice and heavy. and cost me 10 bucks.  I am happy.Time to eat.... The chicken was awfuuuuuul and the sauce even worse!!!!  And the rice.... I cant remember having rice this bad before...I'm the guy that will eat rice out of your rice maker a week later, yet I could not finish this rice it was so bad.  And spicy... no  It wasn't spicy.. just oily and pasty.  Yes pasty.As I work my way through the chicken, trying to just scarf it down as fast as I can, I find a metal shaving.  Yes that is right... a METAL SHAVING!  are you kidding me...a metal shaving in my food....I knew there was a reason I haven't eaten here before....Never again.",5,7,2

Without knowing it, I walked into a Korean run cafe. They serve normal Korean fare cafeteria style, but also have sandwiches, burgers and a salad bar.One thing that Cafe R really has going for it is the huge selection. Udon, soup, ramen, sushi, burgers, salads, wraps. You name it! I had a veggie udon. My meal cost $7 all together but the portion was pretty big.However, their udon wasn't that good. They didn't use miso in their soup and something about the veggies tasted off to me. It wasn't THAT BAD, just not very authentic. Oh well!

I would like to put it above average because it's cheap, but the food is just average. I can't get myself to give it more than 3 stars. 2 stars for the food, the price makes it a 3 star place. I would give this place 4 stars but I had an awful experience at the pasta bar.  I used to get the pasta once a week because basically, you get 4 toppings for under $7.  Great deal in my opinion. So I order my usual. Penne with meatballs, chicken, and shrimp....and another order of meatballs. yes I love meat if you can't tell.  Then I proceeded to ask for alfredo sauce.  I wasn't really paying attention but when I looked up, the guy put this huge slab of butter on the pan he was mixing the pasta in.  Then he put milk over the  pan. I was like ok....maybe he's just adding flavor to the pasta. Apparently it's their version of alfredo. I swear they didn't do that before and it tasted pretty good.  But after getting back to my desk at work and trying it, I couldn't take another bite.  It was awful. Who puts a lot of butter and milk in a pasta and say it's ALFREDO SAUCE!?!?!?!??! The guy at Cafe R does. Argh, now that I'm writing this review, I""m giving it 2 stars instead of 3. Sorry.",3,1,

There are numerous healthy choices, and of course some good old guilty pleasures. A huge assortment of snack items and great variety of drinks as well. You can eat well here for around $10.

Also it consisted of broccoli, green peppers, and large pieces of celery as well as chopped up asparagus which is not in pad thai at all. Not very hard to look up a recipe and serve customers in NYC who know what they are ordering, what they ordered.

Ick!), salads, pizza, Korean, etc.  In fact, steer clear of the sandwiches altogether.  One of the guys working there puts the marking pen behind his ear, then uses his gloved hand to mark the prices.  That means every sandwich he makes has back-of-ear gunk on it.  Ick.  This isn't something I've seen him do just once either.  If he does it to you, just walk away. They used to have some good values when they first opened with ready made portions, but they turned that area into shelving for cookies, coffee, chips, etc.  There's nothing there that's tremendously delicious, but there's nothing tremendously bad either.  Everything is pretty ordinary, and ordinary is pretty useful when you can't decide what else it is that you want.",3,1,1

Seriously, if your near Penn Station/Herald Square, then you should pass by Cafe R. The establishment is extremely spacious and offers a variety of cuisine for the pickiest of eaters. From pizza slices to sushi to pasta dishes, you can find it all under one roof. Right when you walk in they have a couple of ads out displaying their breakfast and lunch specials. The majority of these items (ex. taco bowl or burger) are reasonably priced under $7 or $8.I met up with my mother yesterday for lunch and we happened to just walk into Cafe R. We decided to get pizza slices, which they have a deal for. You can purchase 2 slices and get a cup for soda (no refills, unfortunately) or a Poland Spring water for $4.50. That's a pretty good deal, especially in this area. We also got a side of curly fries. Hey, if you're going to have a cheat meal for the day then you have to get something greasy and bad for you. There's not too much seating available, but that just means more space for food and drink choices for the customer. Needless to say, I will go back to Cafe R in the near future for lunch.",2,1,2
165,Richard L.,"Queens, NY",825,717,14,2.0,5/20/2011,"Holy smokes...So much food...this place is huge....Seriously Immensely huge, spanning from 32nd to 31st street straight across!  Everything is set up in stations which is good b/c if you know exactly what you want...you can run over to that station and get what you want.  But if you are like most other people - you'll be wandering around bumping into people while you decide what you want (which is bad).Usually overcrowded places don't bother me.  I'm usually fine being shoulder to shoulder with people waiting in line to get some amazing food.  Only, this place...the food isn't amazing...It's only ok at best.I had a philly cheese steak that was on sale for 50% off since it was their ""grand opening special"".  Needless to say - the meat was already sitting on the flat top already cooked - they grabbed some and put it grilling on the hot side, then put some precooked onions and precooked peppers - slapped some cheese on top with the bread roll and took it off quickly.  Maybe it's that they had a lot of orders since it was the special - but the meat wasn't hot, the cheeze was barely melted, the onions and the peppers were super soggy - it was a disappointment. BUT for $3.51 cents as part of their Grand Opening Special - a mediocre cheese steak and a free 12 oz drink.  Not a bad deal, but i'd rather pay an extra few bucks for much better food.TL;DR: Huge place, no clear cut focus on food, food is mediocre at best.",1,,

167,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",543,1119,3574,3.0,5/12/2011,"Cafe R is one of those massive one-stop delis that serve everything from fried chicken, burgers, pizza, salads, buffet table, sushi, Teriyaki, noodles, kebab/gyros, pasta, sandwiches/wraps, seafood, and specializing in Korean dishes. It's a behemoth of a deli and takes getting used to navigating around, but you'll soon adjust after a couple visits.As part of Cafe R's recent grand opening, they are still having specials. Today, their grilled chicken platter and hamburgers were 50% off. I decided to go with the Grilled Chicken Platter ($6.25). Two pieces of grilled chicken that were precooked with huge grill marks and sitting in a tray,  were thrown on the grill for a couple minutes and then on top of a bed of salad consisting of lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber. That's what they call a platter, I suppose. I walked around and noticed their steam table which had a nice assortment of foods that looked all pretty fresh. There is also a mini glass counter of pre-made Korean dishes ranging from kalbi, jap chae ($2.50 for a 16 oz. container), soups, and a few other items. And then your usual deli stations. I went to pay for my meal, $3.12 + $0.28 tax = $3.40, and I got a free small cup for the fountain soda, score!! I had asked for dressing and the cashier had directed me towards the salad bar which has a variety of ~15 dressings.The verdict? As I noted before that the grilled chicken was precooked, that's exactly how they tasted. Just warmed up enough, but dried out and tough to cut with the flimsy plastic knife. It was even hard biting into because of how dry it was. The Asian ginger dressing that I had lathered on top as well as the hot sauce definitely helped to make things smoother, but overall, the grilled chicken was very disappointing. The salad was fresh but again nothing to rave about as it was simple ingredients. For $3.40, it was worth it, but for a platter that would normally cost almost $7.00, I would feel a bit ripped off.Cafe R didn't really leave the best impression but I will definitely have to return to give their steam table and fried chicken a try. It's new and they are still learning the ropes and just getting their operations down, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.",1,,
168,Jackie C.,"Bronx, NY",108,25,9,4.0,1/20/2016,"I really wish this place was closer to my office! I discovered this hidden gem when I was shopping at Manhattan Mall on my lunch break. This place literally has EVERYTHING! Pizza, burgers, wings, chicken, udon, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, sushi, a salad bar... You get the point! The first time I went here I got the jerk chicken with salad and rice. Can I say De-lish!! I love the fact they have many different stations where they prepare your food fresh. There is never food ""sitting"" around waiting to be re-heated. If you ask for a burger, they take a patty out of the fridge and grill it fresh. Same with chicken breast, fish, and steak. So expect to wait a bit longer for your food but it will be served fresh and hot every time. Recently I decided to try the grilled flank steak over salad. Again, I was very satisfied  with my food. The quality of food you get for the price is amazing! For a whole grilled steak over salad it was only $9.95. This beats going to chopt and getting a spoonful of cold steak in my salad for $11. And since they remodeled this place they even have a live jazz band at lunch time! I love going to this place for lunch!

I realized hot coffee orders are pre-paid with an empty cup where you are required to pour your own, but the week previous, they had made the iced coffee for me.

The salad bar food is unusually fresh and delicious, with some unusual choices like pork belly, grilled Brussels sprouts, and many, many varieties of food.

Yes!Overall - it depends on your taste - the Udon noodles/all the Asian cuisines are good too! Explore this place because you'll find something. Best thing? The portions = super generous for the price. Not kidding.They really do have it all.",2,,1
182,Jas C.,"Manhattan, NY",31,34,19,2.0,12/2/2012,"I only stop here if I'm in the area or have a few minutes before I have to catch a train. The food is decent, but you do get your order immediately which is better than ordering and waiting for a meal at the surrounding restaurants in Koreatown. Pros:-selection of different cuisines (sandwiches-hot & cold, pasta/pizza entrees, Asian fusion cuisine, burgers, etc) -the meal is prepared right on the spot, unless you are getting something from the salad bar -seatingCons:-prices are decent, but based on the quality of ingredients, it is a bit of a rip-off, even if it is NYC-overpriced refreshments/snacks (instead, go to Jack's World next door)-wait time to pay for the meal, they only have two registers, but usually only one line is open-staff could be nicer-disgusting restroomI only stop here after a long day of running around in the city, if I have an extra 15 minutes to kill or my train is a few minutes delayed. I'm not too crazy about the food, but it hits the spot if you are running short on time and didn't eat all day, then it provides a quick fix. I only get udon soup, I would suggest if you are craving a sandwich/pasta/pizza, just try a smaller pizzeria/deli or even a chain restaurant around Penn. station.",1,,
183,A M.,"New York, NY",0,59,0,1.0,4/11/2015,Lots of variety but all of it is really mediocre.  I've eaten here about 5 times trying different food stations in order to judge it fairly and each meal was unimpressive.    The buffet items are poor quality and never at proper temperature and the made to order items are bland and flavorless.   I was done with them when I brought my food from the salad bar to get weighed/pay and the clumsy ass cashier spilled almost 25% of the contents out of the container on the counter then proceeded to ring me up and only offer a 5% discount.  Really bish????,,,
184,Rimmie P.,"Manhattan, NY",106,57,9,1.0,10/13/2014,"Ugh. The only reason I come here is because it's right next to my office AND I only come here when I'm out of options. I really won't be coming back. Cafe R- you're not doing a great job. Your food is mediocre at best and it's too expensive. Basically, it's not worth it. For example, I paid $7 dollars for a few breakfast buffet items. Your sausage was burnt and was leathery (couldn't eat it) and you served really burnt hashbrowns as well (Which I did not take). Your homefries? The potatoes were raw. Crunchy. The nerve.",1,,
185,Jane L.,"Queens, NY",455,559,1732,2.0,2/18/2013,"Usually, I stop here for a cup of Hazelnut Coffee. There is a huge selection to choose from when it comes to cuisine. There is a sushi bar, salad bar, and cooked to order items. Have gotten lunch here numerous times which Cafe R gives a free bottle of water at the cash register. This is a place to grab and go items. There is an upstairs with tables and chairs. Yes, from the other reviews it is pricey but it is the cost of living  in New York City.",,,
186,Richard B.,"Bronx, NY",968,997,600,2.0,9/4/2012,"Spent about $8 for a pre-made cobb salad, but the salad was missing the blue cheese. The seating area was also dirty at the stools by the windows. There was rubbish stuck between the radiator and the window I'm sure making the perfect cozy little place for vermin. I know a place like this does mega volume and tries its best, but in this city places like this that have buffet stations that charge by the pound are first class offenders for dramatically cheapening the dining experience. Its not about the customer anymore once you spent your money foolishly on whatever they are shoveling out.",1,,
187,Jessica C.,"New York, NY",9,2,0,2.0,2/25/2016,"The food here is really good. I've had lunch here a few times, and I really like that they also offer groceries which comes in handy when I want to keep some snacks at my desk. I've also ordered a veggie burger and gotten roasted potatoes from the food bar and the woman at the counter rang me up as a deluxe instead of charging me separate for both which was awesome.And then I tried to order a juice. There wasn't a line at the juice counter and there was one guy behind it who was building a tower of apples with toothpicks for display. I patiently waited a few minutes while standing at the counter assuming maybe he didn't see me? Eventually I knew he had to have seen me so I politely asked if I could order a juice? The guy didn't look up at me and just muttered ""What kind"". So I told him the number that I wanted from the board. He then looked up at me and in a louder tone said ""WHAT KIND"" I said the number again and he told me he needed the name, when I told him the name he said ""That's better."" As if he was scolding a child. K. I came in the next day to order a juice again, you know maybe that guy was having a bad day? Let's try again. I saw him standing at the coffee machines cleaning and refilling them and no one was behind the juice counter. So I went up and stood there again patiently. He continued to do the coffee machines, and then came over behind the counter AND IGNORED ME AND WENT BACK TO THE COFFEE MACHINES. I looked over to the cashier who kept pointing for me to get him, and I told her he was blatantly ignoring me, then I looked over at the grill guy who looked at me like ""Ugh, I know he's the worst""I eventually just walked out. I don't want to be that person who complains about getting her daily juice because I sound like a pretentious idiot, but the service could use a little work. I wasn't rude to him, I'm super patient, and I gave him two chances on two separate days. I can see why there's never a line at the juice counter, because everyone probably just gives up.",,,
188,M K.,"Manhattan, NY",20,388,38,1.0,6/18/2015,"I guess they need money ASAP to pay for their recent renovation because they have raised their prices dramatically in recent weeks.   Or maybe they just think they can charge more because the place is no longer  aesthetically revolting.   Either way, it's not worth it.   Shame too because it used to be a pretty good option near penn station.",3,2,

190,Michael B.,"Manhattan, NY",50,119,16,4.0,10/12/2011,"Cafe R is basically a food court that has quality, tasty food.  Their main selling point is the incredible DIVERSITY OF FOOD.  I mean, it does all tend to be some type of American food (salads, burgers, stir fry) ..... but there's still lots of options.  Even the refrigerator-wall has like 50+ different bottled drinks (Coke, green tea, Vitamin Water, fruit juices, etc).Also, the place is quite spacious and has a clean, modern look.  I particularly enjoy the spaciousness, which is obviously rare in NYC.",6,,

A few months ago I stopped in for an egg and cheese wrap, which was delicious. This morning I stopped in because I noticed they had fresh-made juice. I tried the apple, carrot and orange juice. It was really good -- sweet, not bitter and good flavor balance.My complaint, which isn't really a complaint is that it cost $5. But, if you're looking for a healthy, vegan and gluten-free breakfast the juice is great.",3,,

Mind you, there are not many places for those working around this neighborhood to grab lunch.Cafe R is just a dream come true. This place has every kind of dish you could hope for - from pizza, sushi, udon, kebabs, ramen, mexican, breakfast, ice cream, you name it. FRESHLY MADE! On top of that, there is a whole section for groceries! The prices? Seriously, unbelievably low at times. And the quality, pretty darn high for the price.Very excited to try out all the options - highly recommend you check it out!",6,,1

195,Jessica L.,"New York, NY",40,90,0,4.0,8/12/2011,"Many evenings I have a gym appointment at 7 or 7:30. I get out of work around 5:30. There's no way I'm going to kill an extra hour and a half in my office every night, and if I go home I'll just have to turn around and head back downtown after 20 minutes, so I need someplace quiet to chill out and maybe have a small bite. Cafe R has every kind of food you could possibly want and a vast, generally nearly empty seating area upstairs. Their sandwiches and wraps are delicious and almost all of the employees are friendly and do their job efficiently. It is a giant improvement over the creepy discount store that used to be in the space - seriously, that place made Jack's 99 Cent Store look like Saks Fifth Avenue. Also, there are entrances on 31st Street and 32nd Street, making Cafe R ideal for shortcuts.",6,,

Prices are ridiculous. New options are needed in this hood ASAPSo I end up here because it's so close and I've had a few good experiences with their salad bar. That ended Monday night. The guy mixing salads comes to help me while scratching the back of his sweaty neck. I ask him if he's going to put on gloves, but he doesn't hear me. Instead he picks up a pair of tongs and wipes his nose on his arm wrist and fingers while holding the tongs. I told him I'd changed my mind.",,2,

199,Jonathan N.,"New Orleans, LA",1475,258,53,4.0,6/15/2011,"This is my ""current crush"" when it comes to lunch spots near Herald Square. Why? Let me tell you... Cafe R is huge. The space is cavernous and the options are plentiful. At Cafe R, you can get everything from Korean to burgers to pasta to salad to burritos and just about anything else you can think of. And everything I've had so far has been at least pretty good. The burger and fries was satisfying, the salad bar is fresh, and the burrito was tasty (though impossible to eat without a fork and knife). The chicken Caesar wrap needed more dressing and the lo mein wasn't that great. I also once got a flat Coke from the fountain. That was sad. But perhaps what makes Cafe R worthy of four stars is that it's pretty cheap, at least for this Godawful neighborhood. Even if it's only $2 cheaper per day to get lunch here, that adds up to $10 a week ($40 a month) ($120 a quarter!) ($520 a year!!). The lines are often long but the cashiers are so fast that they move very quickly. And though this may not apply to you, it's also right across the street from my office building, so it's quite convenient. For the reasons stated above, Cafe R is my current crush. Will it go beyond that? Only time will tell.",10,2,1
