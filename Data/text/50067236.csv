When I arrived, the place was pretty dead. Waitress was the bartender. And she definitely filled my drinks fast and strong. Place got packed a little bit later, and the kitchen was a bit backed up. It wasn't until 30 minutes in that I got my meal, and another 30 for my take out. By that time, the bartender had 6 full tables and the entire bar that she was taking care of.They definitely should have had more wait staff, but the bartender did the best that she could for a house of 30!!Food was fresh, excellent bar food and tons of options.",1,,1
2,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,3.0,3/3/2018,"Friday night in the mist of a horrific snow / rain storm to end a exhaustive work week is a long haul trek.  Clientele is a lot of riff raff male chauvinists who berate, chastise and ridicule the female bar tender/ server.  The poor thing was working to the grind fulfilling drinks and taking food orders ensuring customers were satisfied while most of the male customers were riding high with their wave of ridicule and ill mockery - obviously no respect for women and too drunk to understand or have true remorse.  Aside from the female bar tender, I was the second female in this establishment (as a customer) sitting at the bar counter.  Thankfully, none of them said a single word to me as I was undisturbed in a corner at the bar counter.  I am not the girl who they wanted but a silent writer with angry words to attack and expose one's malice attitude.  Truth.  I refuse to pay attention or to answer.  Keep writing!Cobb salad $13A giant plate full of turkey, blue cheese and bacon.  Disappointedly there were no hard boiled egg and this is cobb salad?  I think not! I ordered the whole package including the hard boiled egg, but was missing.  The vinaigrette dressing was very minimal to met the massive portion size of this salad which is a meal in itself.  The bacon was over cooked and very burnt and extremely hard.Basket O' Tots $7A monumental size of tots which is great.  The portion is so large that it is meant to be shared.  Tatar tots, to me, reminisce of Glee's fictional William McKinley High School during lunch who Mercedes Jones's intense liking for tots and her anger when Coach Sylvester discard tots to declare a ban in protest for healthy eating initiative.  Coach Sylvester: I also like tots.Pinot Grigio $7Happy Hour was still going.  This wine was enjoyable and crisp.Nota bene:  This bar is extremely remote access to the nearest subway station at 11th Avenue (between 51st Street and 50th Street) in Hell's Kitchen, Midtown West.  The nearest subway is the C train at 50th Street station at 8th Avenue.",6,5,5
3,Ken P.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,251,189,4.0,12/5/2017,"Wow.  I've been here quite a few times over the recent years and ALWAYS thought that I had Yelped it up and was sad to realize that I haven't.  It's been a few months since I have been here of course but the menu has remained the same according to other peeps and regulars let's me continue in confidence.I began hitting the Retro when I was visiting either the nearby Terminal 5 or Stage 48 venues for a Rock and Metal show.  Its about a three block walk in either direction to whatever venue you are going to and this is the place to pre-game if that is your goal.  The menu is simple and succinct without a hundred and seventy five options and its all very reasonably priced.  I've had burgers, wraps and appetizers here and can safely recommend them all.  The Retro burger is a massive dish so that's all you need to eat unless you are a bottomless pit of a patron like some of my friends.  One of the signature items the place is known for is tater tots and there are a number of awesome configurations for them to enjoy.  My favorites include the buffalo tots and the disco tots.  I should advise that if you order this sort of thing that its huge and you will not want to eat anything else.  I'd love for the place to create a smaller portion of this.  They do allow you to swap one of the kinds with your burger but it comes at a nominal fee.  There are also hot dogs which I have had on occasion.  No sauerkraut though, only mustard or chili and cheese.  That's okay at the end of the day.  The fully stocked bar offers a lot of choices but I am mostly a beer or wine drinker.  Shots will do me in and if I have any spirits its in a vodka cranberry or rum and coke.  There are seldom deviations to this for me.  Good beer choices for those who crave something different from Budweiser and there are occasionally specialty craft brews on tap for a limited time.  So far none of the friends I have brought here have complained.  Music is piped in over the Internet and there is a freely accessed WiFi which is wonderful since I like to check in via Swarm or share photos to Foodspotting.   I prefer those apps to Facebook only.  The place can be crowded at times but outside of the bar area there is a backroom that often has larger gatherings taking it over.  I've even seen teams from area company's getting there drink on.  Also I should note that you never know who might drop in should a gig be happening as I've had beverages with members of Dark Tranquillity and Crobot who paid a visit, and while he didn't remain, an unmasked Papa Emeritus III was observed at one time.  Overall this is a rock solid choice and I look forward to being in the friendly atmosphere once again.  Trust me on this one.",1,,

Came here for lunch with my brother and the place was fairly empty this past Friday 1/5. Bartender to busy yappin away. Finally came over to us and took our order. Food came out, we've there awhile. Not once did she come over and ask if we were ok or we needed refills. My brother had to get up and walk over to get a refill. He walks over to an inappropriate conversation amongst the staff and customers sitting at the bar. He was then asked by the bartender if all men likes fingers in their Ass. Now I'm not upset at the point of the conversation and it is a dive bar after all. But to have the nerve to ask a customer that question and the fact that you are too busy talking about bullshit than to actually attending to paying customers is beyond me.

We ended up getting Buffalo Tots and Chili Tots. I didn't care about the mistake at that point because we were starving. Unfortunately the tots were served cold, cold, and cold.

28,Jessica L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",696,313,788,4.0,7/26/2014,"I came for the tots! I noticed a picture that another Yelper had posted and immediately put it on my to do list. It ended up being a journey for me to find American Retro due to traffic and of course me getting lost, but nothing was going to deter me from getting my hands on the tots. I found it a little funny that there were located within steps of a gas station - didn't know there were too many of those floating around in Manhattan. Anyway, American Retro Bar & Grill is exactly what they claim to be. The bar itself is outfitted with retro decor, equipped with a skee ball machine, trikes and trucks on the walls, Snoopy in a helicopter, baseball bats and caps, jerseys, retro signs and TVs. In addition to the scene, the radio blared some old but awesome tunes varying from ""Eye of the Tiger"" to ""I Do it for You"" and ""The Final Countdown.""The menu remains true to its roots featuring the usual finger foods (nachos, potato skins, sliders and wings) as well as salads, burgers and sandwiches. But like I said, I came for the tots. The menu has its only special section dedicated to these babies. There were 5 specialty options as well as plain if you wanted to be boring... For beer lovers, there are is a great variety of both local and domestics as well as seasonals. Now on to the food. YUM! We went all out and ordered 3 different tot specials, the Pizza Tots, Sarah's Disco Tots and ""Tot-chos."" Each dish came out rather quickly and they all had this in common they were blanketed (literally) in cheese. The Pizza Tots were doused with a tomato based sauce and covered in mozzarella cheese. The Disco Tots were covered with brown gravy and a mixture of cheddar. The Tot-chos were generously mixed with ground beef, salsa, beans, cheese and served with jalapeños, sour cream and salsa. Each dish was amazing. They seem to have the technique down to a tee, each tot was extra crisp but still was soft once bitten into and even with the extreme amounts of sauce atop they remain delectable and did not get soggy. American Retro is opened late until 4 am, which I suspect is probably the best time to consume these babies. While they were mouthwateringly delicious I was kicking myself as I was walking back toward the subway station - they are definitely a drunk food and would be great after a night of drinking, as an afternoon snack - yeah not so much.",1,,1

Updated review",Still amazing two year later!!  I'm most amazed at how well their food travels.  Every time I've gotten delivery the burger is still super fresh and hot and the tots are super crispy!  Burgers and tots do not normally travel well.  I've ordered burgers from restaurants located inside my office building and by the time they've been delivered upstairs they are soggy and only warm.  I have no idea how they manage it at American Retro - but they have the best delivered burgers ever!!!,2,1,1
31,Tom B.,"Round Rock, TX",75,247,11,4.0,5/8/2015,"Solid drunk/hungover food if you live in Hell's Kitchen or happen to be in the area. I've ordered from here at least a dozen times in the last 18 months, its better than all the local diners and cheaper too.What's best based on my experiences? You can't go wrong with the burgers but they also do great chicken fingers and their BBQ sauce is made for dipping them (and your french fries) in! My girlfriend is a tater tot connoisseur and she swears by them so they deserve a mention too. If you're ordering delivery then the timing is always a bit of a lottery, I've had my order delivered anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes which can be frustrating especially if you're dying of a hangover but once the food arrives you'll immediately start to feel better.",2,,

33,Mark C.,"Toms River, NJ",55,108,254,5.0,7/16/2016,"I stopped by this bar on a very hot and humid summer day with a group of people. American Retro has been on my list of bookmarked places for a long time and I'm glad that I finally got a chance to check it out.It's conveniently located on the western part of Hell's kitchen, close to the Javits center, the Daily Show, or Terminal 5 if you need a place to kill time before an event or relax and have fun after one. However, if you're taking the subway like I was, it can be a long, sweaty walk.  Happy hour is a whopping 8 hours! So we ordered some drinks and a mid-afternoon snack (that turned into a feast). This place excels in their tater tots, and admittedly that's what hooked me from the yelp reviews, but their other food is good too. We of course started with the ""tot-chos""- nachos with tater tots instead of chips, and they were absolutely delicious. Somehow, the tots were still crispy, even after sitting under all those toppings. We had to order an additional basket of tots because the totchos went so fast! We also added a plate of their bourbon wings- not the bar food style wings I was expecting. These wings were super tender (possibly pressure cooked to get them that fall off the bone tender in such a short time) and served in what tasted like a tomato based sauce. Good wings, just not what I was expecting. We got an order of their fried ravioli (basically mozzarella sticks in ravioli form) which were good. I'd totally come back here next time I'm in the area. Next time I'll try their burger or maybe the shepherd's pie.",,,

Updated review","All my favorite bartenders are now gone, and the replacements seem to still be ""figuring things out"". Food hasn't changed, but the service has gone down hill. I suggested the place to some friends going to the summer concerts at the pier the other day and they had a bad experience. Granted, it was busy and they were sitting at a table, but they were ""forgotten about"" and had some issues with their food order, and waited a while to get their tab taken care of at the end. I just never like suggesting a place and finding out that the people had a negative experience. For me, the food has still been the same good quality, but the staff changes were a little disappointing. This happens in NYC all the time, and I'm sure they'll get better. Still a good beer list, and Mike the manager is still there. I just don't find myself over there as often.",3,,

The blonde bartender (I didn't catch her name) was super nice and really funny. Her the the male bartender working with her were really talkative and friendly. We got the chili cheese tater tots and they were AMAZING. I can't stop thinking about them. I wanted to go back and get more--but I have a guilty conscience. Cool dive bar atmosphere and a giant window open to the outside. I would go back! Plus they have founders beer! Being from Michigan, we appreciated the representation of our homeland lol.",,,1

Updated review","Oof... my recent experience wasn't good.Once again, I looked to American Retro to satisfy my love of tater tots.  My friends ordered the Jalapeño Poppers, Chicken Sandwich, and beef chili.  This time, I felt they gave us less tater tots and they were over-fried.Worst of all, my friend felt horrible the next day.  She had stomach pain all day from the food.  I still recommend American Retro for the tater tots (like I do in my original review), but this confirms my strategy of not eating anything else from them.  At least don't get the poppers or chicken sandwich, judging by how miserable she was.",2,,
52,Eric L.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,21,0,5.0,1/2/2017,"totally hit the spot after attending Space down the street. Wings were killer. We had hot and BBQ.  Both were well done, the BBQ were unusually good.  Disco Tater Tots. Damn!Burger was also solid.  Fast friendly service.",,,
53,Leslie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,10,0,1.0,6/19/2016,"Did not even bother to eat here tonight. After a long day of work, I needed some food and a drink we went bike riding to this place from Battery Park and as soon as I walked in the bartender was so nasty. We were using the bike rack outside because my boyfriend and his friend used it last time only one side to make sure there was space for their delivery guys bike and she was so snippy about leaving space for the delivery guy, which I completely understand and we were making sure to not use the entire thing. She just kept giving us an attitude that we decided to leave right away. I work at a restaurant and I understand that at the end of the night you just want to go home, but that is no excuse to treat people in such a rude way.",2,1,
54,Jane M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,256,374,3.0,2/28/2014,"Cons about this place: it is literally in the middle of nowhere and the interior of the bar looks very run down/old and the bartender was a liquor snob (aka said only cheap tequila drinkers need salt and lime)Pros: the drinks are good, food is ok (this is a bar so I wasn't expecting anything amazing), they have a skeeball machine and beer pong tablesOverall, I wouldn't come back here only because it was very far from any modes of public transportation.",1,2,
55,Dang L.,"Houston, TX",127,113,306,4.0,7/14/2014,"Had a good experience here with my friends when we came for dinner. Good service. You can get a pretty cheap deal for some wings! There are lots of flavors to choose from and wings aren't horrible. Got three orders (Hot, medium and sweet Thai). The hot to me was really sour tasting than spicy, the medium was the right kind of spicy but it was still a little sour. My favorite had to be the sweet and tangy tasting sweet Thai flavor. Also got an order of their ""Tot-chos"". Instead of chips, the nacho is served over tater tots with salsa, pico, and sour cream on the side.   There was a hefty portion when it came finally came out. The Tot-chos were alright. I wouldn't order it again though. There wasn't enough chili and way too many beans in the chili. There was also so much cheese put on top that the cheese didn't melt. Either that or they waited to long to serve our tots. Strangely enough, even after reheating the Tot-chos the cheese still wouldn't melt...I'd recommend just ordering normal tater tots. They are good enough without the all the other fancy toppings to make it turn into soggy hash-browns.",,1,
56,HH W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/1/2016,"Great food. And not just a bevy of tot-based dishes. Shepard's Pie is fab with a surprising addition of tomato sauce. The soups are fun and imaginative and always homemade. The Bourbon Wings are sublime.Service is top notch, friendly with just the right amount of Hell's Kitchen attitude. The music? Depends on who's tending bar. Mostly good, but sometimes too much Journey and Cold Play.",,,
57,Chip R.,"Morrisville, NC",510,469,1035,4.0,6/1/2015,"Short Version: Great retro bar experience. Service was good considering she was solo that afternoon, so I can imagine how great they are fully staffed. It has a unique retro type atmosphere in spacious serving area/bar. No complaints with drinks or eats here. The Yelp app did us right again, we enjoyed our American Retro encounter!The Deets:When I met up with friends from back home near Pier 92 during Fleet Week/Memorial Day weekend, of course our most pressing concern was ""Where now for eats/drinks?!?"" So, the trusty Yelp app to the rescue...we went for American Retro just over on 11th Ave.Don't let this little place's façade, next to a Mobil quick mart, fool you...inside is a good sized quality bar. The name is a good description, as inside there are many retro type items and artifacts to enjoy...lava lamps, black light glow posters, velvet Elvis hanging, etc. Plenty of seating at the bar or in the tables throughout the bar, so it's not claustrophobic. Excellent retro music is always in the background, I was digging the vibe in this place. We couldn't believe it but there was only one server there that Saturday, but let me tell you that little lady busted her ass and kept it going there. Kudos to our server, she made it work well and we didn't have any service hangups regardless of her solo situation running the bar area and keeping the tables happy. After a round of tequila shots and margaritas (both excellent), we had our mid afternoon eats. I decided on the fish and chips, and the entrée was great. My companions enjoyed their selections as well, no complaints at our table. If you are looking for a great afternoon/evening hangout to pass the time, consider putting American Retro on your list.",2,,
58,Chris C.,"New York, NY",148,185,24,4.0,7/9/2014,"If you are looking for some decent bar bites this is a great place to go. They have cheap wings 20 for $12 and you can get them in a few different flavors. Also get the tots they are delicious, crispy golden goodness. They bar is old looking so definitely don't come for the aesthetics, but it's a decent place if you are looking for something reaaaaaaal casual and cheap.",,,
59,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,10/9/2013,"Just your normal American dive bar in the heart of, wait no, super far west side of New York City. My friends and I typically come here for the after game specials for Zog, but aside from that, the bartenders are pretty friendly and quick and the prices are decent.Bar food is pretty standard, while their tater tot baskets are unreal. Simple concepts such as tot-chos and chili cheese tots, but done really well. Tots are always crispy and delicious and the toppings are always piping hot. The buffalo tots can become quite a mess, but definitely worth it. The wings here are also very large and very worth it if you get 20 of them (Price goes from $8 per 10 wings to $6.25 per 10 wings)Also, they use Pat LaFrieda meat in their burgers, which has a semi-salty taste, but very flavorful. You can taste the marbling as well as the actual meat of the burger. That and some tots (50 cents extra in replacement of normal boring fries), can be considered a nearly unbeatable combination.Overall, if you ever find yourself in super far Midtown West, definitely hit this place up, the food and beer here is like taking the bus to Delaware. (Sorry, obscure reference).",2,,
60,Leanne I.,"New York, NY",43,60,11,1.0,2/8/2015,"this review is based on delivery I ordered. My sister and I woke up really craving bar food but we were not in the mood to go an sit down anywhere. We decided on this place because its really close to my apartment and had good Yelp reviews. I'll cut to the chase....... most of the onion rings honestly didn't have onions inside, honest to god. Not sure if they disintegrated or what but they were batter rings. The sliders were just disrespectful. They were not good at all and didn't come with anything. No cheese, no onions, no sauce, no lettuce no nothing. And the buns were really hard. The mozzarella sticks seemed like they were fried yesterday, put in the fridge and then put in a togo box without being reheated. The wings were whatever but not awful. Last the soup was broth with cut up pieces of tortilla in it. Nothing else. I feel bad writing this because this place has really good reviews....... I don't know. Maybe the cook just woke up today and was like ""NOPE.""  I've uploaded pictures paint this picture.",4,5,

Based on the reviews for this place, I decided to order chicken wings and tots for my teenaged daughters, and an order of the ""veggie chili"" (asked for no dairy, but it came with a gob of cheese), a couple of nights ago. H U G E mistake! Once I scooped the cheese off of the top of the veggie chili, I had a bite .... it was disgusting - canned would have been better. One daughter ate the tots, she was fine.

But I seriously still think about the Tot-chos sometimes. The chili cheese tots were also amazing, and my buffalo sauce-loving friend was very into the buffalo tots. Drinks were cheap and easy to come by. I remember the bartender being friendly and my friends and I leaving the bar fairly inebriated. In my one experience it never got particularly packed so there was always room for some dancing by the tipsier patrons. And yes, there's skeeball!

Crispy tots with marinara sauce underneath a ton of melted cheese, basically like a plain pizza but with tater tots instead of pizza dough/crust.

The burger was thick and juicy, with a layer of melted cheese on top, onion rings, lettuce, and bacon.  GRILLED CHICKEN WRAP, $8yelp.com/biz_photos/FST4…An enormous wrap cut in half, and each half was wrapped up in paper. I love that detail! Nice white meat grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, and some onions.  yelp.com/biz_photos/FST4…I ate only half my wrap (!), and had the rest the next day.

The first time, the waiter came up and gave us our menus, was attentive to filling up drinks and making nice small talk without being too invasive. The second time the waitress was too preoccupied with people at the bars and didn't give our menus and had to go up to order. She was rude and took a long time to get our drinks.Moving on from the service difference aside, the quantity and quality of food is brilliant for those on a budget when visiting New York City, with the chilli tots a high recommendation.

Then he'll pull out his Yelp app, search for the closest place that has food and a heat source of any kind even if it's just a match propped up on a table. That's how I found this place. It was too cold for me to notice that it was a bar. Service reflected that fact. The waitress was actually the bartender and she was very nice. She took our drink order right away and my friends beer basically teleported to the table along with my soda. The waitress/bartender did her job. Unfortunately, the rest of the food didn't work as well. It took about 25 minutes before she came back to take our order. I don't blame her, because there were a bunch of people sitting at the bar and she had to ""tend the bar.""Anyway, when she got a break, she came back and took our order. Another 30-40 minutes went by before we finally got our food. By this point, I'd eaten the glass that my soda came in, so I was full. Still, I managed to scarf down hot wings, pizza tater tots, and a beef slider. All of it would have been extremely delicious if I'd drank some of my friend's beer. Unfortunately I didn't, so it was just okay. Decent bar food. Not bad, but not great. The magic of alcohol would've made it better.

A friend of mine recently decided to host a birthday get-together here which worked terrifically. The bar being empty lends itself to a crowd (when you bring your own crowd, that is), and they have a rear space with tables and a dart board which was great to colonize for the birthday thing. Their food menu sounds good and everyone I am with always orders and loves their crazy varieties of tater tots, so at least there is some good pub fare here to fall back on. All in all, a great casual pub option in the western hinterlands of Hell's Kitchen, and worth a stop if you're in the 'hood.",2,,1

Without fail, each time I go to American Retro I order wings. They are really good, with lots of sauce, and come in various levels of spiciness. I made the mistake of ordering ""hot"" once and winded up regretting it, so I stick to mild now. Oh and the tater tots are really good too.

But after I threw a bit of a fit, the manager explained to me that we COULD get bottle service - just that the bartender would have to serve it to me and my bros one drink at a time. Seemed like a pretty tight idea. Wonder if more places will start doing that? Sickest of all, Retro (unlike every other premier NYC nightclub I've been to - and I've been to A LOT of premier NYC nightclubs because I'm a wealthy businessman/sex addict) offers a wide variety of tot-based dishes. My boy J-Dubb got an order of ""Pizza Tots"" - an Italian take on the grated-and-fried potato dish. I went with the ""Tot-chos"" - Mexican-style tater tots. Long story short, I don't see myself ever going to another nightclub that doesn't offer tots. OTHER REASONS RETRO IS NYC'S HOTTEST TOT CLUB - Conveniently located next to a Mobil gas station - Also down the street from Larry Flint's Hustler Club - which doesn't serve tots despite the pricey cover- Retro has this dope robot-DJ that will play whatever song you want in exchange for a dollar.- There's not a ton of room to dance, so me and J-Dubb just played skee ball and split ""Disco Tots"" instead.",1,1,1

The new high score is 43,000...we'll probably be coming back to see if anyone can beat it :)There was a group there playing beer pong, and then they asked if we wanted to join in for flip cup.

It brings out my inner dude who enjoys fried foods and a frosted glass of beer along with some rockin' music, skee ball (!!!) and a real dart board.HIGHLY recommend:- Buffalo wings: holy moly these are possibly some of the best wings I've had so far in the city! Meaty, not fatty, wings slathered in spicy deliciousness (you can get them mild or ""ass burner spicy,"" for that matter) and served with a side of celery & carrots, with plenty of bleu cheese dip that actually have chunks of cheese in them. They're never fried to smithereens and always tastes fresh. The double order is just a few more dollars, so go for the gold! - Chili cheese tater tots: their chili is made with actual chunks of beef (no mystery meat grindings) and real melted cheese (wayyy better ""cheese"" sauce, whatever that is).- Retro burger: for bar food, this is not bad at all! The burger meat is high quality albeit tad under-seasoned, but the bacon makes up for the lack of flavor. The toasted English muffin subtracts from the guilt factor, and it doesn't hurt that you can substitute the side of fries for some tots at an extra 50cents.Because it's all the way out at 11th ave (yes it exists), this place is never overly crowded so I can actually enjoy my beer & fried goodies without the college crowd.

I'd also like to mention that if you're here on a Saturday and it's crowded it might be a bit of a wait because there is only 1 bartender who is also the waiter. She told us she is the only one that always works on Saturdays. Luckily for us it wasn't crowded at all and the other patrons that were there were only drinking. Prices were typical bar prices but surprisingly cheap for NY standards (at least I thought) Retro burger $11, $1 to add egg, BLT $8 and catfish sandwich $9 don't remember the price of drinks but it was happy hour 11am-7pm.
