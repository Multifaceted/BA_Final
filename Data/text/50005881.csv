1,Pablo D.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,1.0,8/7/2018,"The burger tasted like chewing gum. The bartender/waitress was rude and laughed at my girlfriend when she tried to describe it. I tasted it and can still remember the disgusting mint flavor in my mouth. If the owner reads this, we ate on August 6, 2018 after 10pm. The waitress said what do you want me to do. Not the appropriate answer when someone tells you they think they just ate someone else's chewing gum spit. We were one of the last 2 people to order. I have heard of places where the cooks mess with the food and this is what it feels like. I'm offended and disgusted. Never again.",2,1,
2,Antonio N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",89,17,16,4.0,6/20/2018,"I've been craving Fish & Chips for sometime & decided to give Lilly's a try. To give some context on the last time I had Fish & Chips was at a British run compound in Afghanistan. Anyway, Lilly's is a stone's throw from work. The fries are cut in house & double fried (from the looks) they taste great but come from the kitchen unseasoned. The fish came out hot & golden brown. The underside become soggy quickly and gave a very soggy & doughy texture for certain bites. Coupled w/ the tarter sauce the fish tasted amazing. However, the fish & breading by themselves leaves much to be desired. The cod was firm & not overcooked. A bit of salt & pepper in the batter would have greatly elevated the flavor of the fish.",,,

We got the buffalo chicken caesar wrap with a side salad and the avocado steak salad. Both were really good but the steak avocado salad was just phenomenal. It tasted so fresh and the steak was cooked perfectly, I definitely recommend it! Overall it was a great meal and the place itself has a great atmosphere! Definitely a great place for a great meal and a drink!",1,,
4,Jenna L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/13/2018,"Pulsd: you pay tax and tip on $120 bill + $29 voucher Can't believe I have to write this but this was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The waitress, Brenda, came up to our table and told us that since we had not made a reservation 24 hours previously, we would have to be patient because it was not in her job description to serve 6 people who made a last minute reservation (we had purchased the Pulsd voucher and called 1 hr in advance). I told her we had every intention of tipping her for the full amount of whatever we had ordered.She came to our table only 1 time in 90 minutes to ask if we needed anything. So 2 drinks in 90 minutes and a $13 entree and we had to pay tax and tip on a $120 meal. It is NOT worth it.",2,,
5,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",620,332,2371,4.0,10/3/2017,"So there are a few things I do at any new brunch spot that I feel will help me understand what kind of bruncharie (deal with it), I'm in. First, and most importantly, I sit at the bar and say hey to whoever will be my enabler for the next hour and a half,  two hours, or, if I'm in a unicorn brunch spot, as long as I feel like (looking at you La Carbonara). This will not only gauge the quality, and quantity of alcohol I'm about to imbibe, it also lets me know what kind of human I'll be chatting with (and who will be judging me silently) on any given Saturday . If the bartender is cool, the folks who run the place are probably cool, and all will be right with the world. If the bartender seems nervous, pours suspiciously slowly, or isn't fun, the person who owns the place is probably a douche (I do love an observational experiment). It basically boils down to this; if the drinks come without you having to ask, and the person who brings them to you is cool, you've found a good spot. Next up is the feel of the place in conjunction with the menu. Are you in an Irish pub that serves pasta? French place making meatballs? That should be a bright red flag, and you should run. Yes, they may try to kill you with mimosas and bloody Mary's, but odds are you'll leave less than satisfied, and uncomfortably drunk. Find a place that does one thing really well, and you'll be happier when you're done. The one exception of course is quality of drinks; All brunch spots should do this well, and if they don't there's really no point (find a lunch spot). Brunch is a science you guys; put some empirical work in and you'll find spots worth going back to. OK so all that said, Lilly O'Brien's passed all tests for me this past weekend. The bartender was unbelievably chill, the Irish pub had pub food (and the obligatory waffle..because you know...brunch), and the drinks came without me having to ask. If you find yourself downtown in need of a brunch spot, you could do far worse than this place.",14,10,14
6,Rosanna M.,"New York, NY",236,8,20,1.0,11/5/2017,"I ordered a medium burger + fries and vanilla ice cream from Lilly O'Brien's on seamless. When it arrived 15 minutes later than estimated, my burger was cooked completely well done, the fries were soggy and the vanilla ice cream (which cost $7, SEVEN DOLLARS) was the tiniest pint ever. It boggles my mind how this ice cream cost me $7. I will not be ordering or visiting in the future.",1,1,
7,Mandee P.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,186,4.0,11/10/2017,"Ordered takeout from Lilly O'Brien's cuz my coworkers and ate were particular STARVING last night. The menu sounded appealing and best of all, filling. I found their variety appealing. They had everything from salmon and pot pies, to burgers, chicken, and wraps. 2 of my coworkers ordered the Mac n Cheese Lobster burger. I was super tempted as well, but wasn't sure if it'd be a hit or a miss. Well they couldn't stop raving about how amazing it was! I definitely need to try it. Another coworker ordered mashed potatoes and chicken piccata which she said was good. I ordered the buffalo chicken Caesar wrap. It was filling and tasty and I really enjoyed me side salad. We also ordered calamari fries which tasted really good, especially with the lemon and green sauce provided. I really enjoyed the flavor but I think I prefer the texture of regular calamari more. All in all I'm wanting to get through their yummy menu!",,,
8,Mickey M.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",272,683,43,5.0,11/1/2017,"I've been following the bartenders of this place from Biddy Early's, to the former home of Lilly's, to it's current spot. It's my local away from home and work. I bring friends and family here, because it's a great place.The boneless buffalo wings are outstanding. They're the same as they were at Biddy Early's. Not bready, and just the right amount of heat. Their wings might be on my deserted island menu. Plenty of TV's, and on a weeknight it's pretty easy to get a seat at the bar. I look forward to more frequent trips!",,,
9,Kate G.,"New York, NY",6,14,1,1.0,10/21/2017,"Sorely disappointed. Came in for a brunch offer. There is one staff on weekends (maybe only during ""brunch"" hours?) and she serves as both the bartender and server.She's sweet but... she's busy serving the bar and I got my Heinz 20 minutes after my burger + fries came out. My companion's steak was definitely way past it's prime - not fresh at all. First bite in was a spit out. I tried it - same conclusion. They switched it out for another order but the burger was asked medium and came out well done.This is your place if you don't care for service, even if you're paying for a timed bottomless deal. Steak was abhorrent - dogs would not eat it. I had the burger which was decent at best (mine was overcooked as well). My fault for coming to this area to eat but will not eat here again. My guess is that they added brunch to bring in more business but in order to keep that they would be to provide at least decent service and fresh food.",,,
10,Ian O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/11/2018,Great spot! Had a bad experience close by and walked in here after. Very friendly staff who immediately cheered us up and gave us a great experience. Will definitely pop back here when around.,,,

The brunch included bottomless booze for 90 minutes. We arrived at 2pm(just before brunch cut off)  or so and had mimosas.  I ordered steak and eggs . The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable we were seated at a booth and the waitresses was more than welcoming and very friendly.       Our food arrived my steak was PERFECTLY MEDIUM!  The food was very good and the mimosas are good too.

So I stood for two drinks because, inconveniently, they had a $15 credit limit and the drink I ordered was only $6. I appreciate a cheap drink but, c'mon guys. It's not fair to impose more than one drink on someone without cash with your credit limits. Anywho, I did enjoy the music.",,,
16,Jane D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,50,31,4.0,3/13/2018,I like the set up at this place. We had lost our coworker the night before so we went here to kind of reflect. The drinks were good not a big Bacardi fan but get we were mourning. Will be back soon.,,,
17,Marygrace A.,"Manhattan, NY",487,234,853,5.0,10/24/2016,I held an event for my staff at Lily O'Briens and it was a wonderful experience! Damien and his staff were a pleasure to work with and very professional. We held an event for around 30 people: we set up the event pretty last minute and they were super accommodating. They are excellent at communication: I had to change something after I'd placed the order and they helped me in a matter of seconds.My team had a wonderful time - we had 2 hour open bar with food & everything went really well. The food was tasty and very hot. The line to get drinks was always very short and the wait staff (though there are only a few) were super attentive.Consider having an event here - they were wonderful!,1,,1
18,Nikk A.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,139,34,5.0,6/25/2017,"I really don't have anything bad to say about Lilly's. I've been coming here for years and the food has always been consistently good. The bartenders and waitresses are all sweethearts and they have Schofferhofer which is my absolute favorite  I can honestly say the food comes out really quick, unless of course they are packed- which if you go after work, it usually is. There's definitely ample seating and the bar is really big. It took me a little while to get used to this new location because I felt like the original had more seating, but this new location definitely grew on me. I always order the same thing, because I'm a creature of habit lol, I get the chicken fajita panini and fries- really really good. I know others who have gotten the shepherd's pie and they love it, so that's the most input I could give on the food lol. They also have a bunch of tv's throughout playing different sports and they have lotto here too, which is always fun to kill some time and waste some money lol.",,,

22,Jessica H.,"New Haven, CT",0,9,0,1.0,3/25/2018,"If you're going here for the pulsd bottomless brunch, skip it. They had one waitress working the tables and the bar. She worked very hard but she was way outnumbered. The service was - through no fault of hers - very slow. And then when the check came we were told we owed tax and gratuity on $190 although with the pulsd coupon what we had actually paid was $90. The manager wanted to collect ""tax"" on $20 per person plus the price of the food (which meant we were paying tax on the food twice). The food was fine (nothing special). The drinks were fine (though the ""bellini"" appeared to be just peach flavored champagne) but the experience was awful. Save yourself the headache. Go elsewhere.",,,
23,Katherine A.,"New York, NY",0,24,0,4.0,4/17/2018,"A friend and I bought the $29 Pulsd deal for a brunch deal that included two entrees and bottomless drinks for 90 minutes. We both got the breakfast burger and it was exactly what you'd want from a burger. No frills, just a good juicy patty topped with bacon and an egg. I was a bit worried about the service at first, given the fact that one woman seemed to be working the entire restaurant. But I was pleasantly surprised by her attentiveness and the steady pour of drinks. Sometimes at bottomless brunches, the drinks are watered down. This was not the case, and I enjoyed my Bloody Marys. I would not pay full price at Lylly O'Brien's because in a city full of great brunches, it is pretty standard. But with the Pulsd deal, it was 100% worth it.",,,
