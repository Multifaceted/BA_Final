0,David B.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",7,19,7,4.0,11/19/2018,"Had an event in the city to go to later that night, and needed an unpretentious place to have a beer and a burger after work while I waited. I thought it wouldn't be crowded here because it was a Monday night around 5:30. Couldn't have been more wrong -- the place was packed with Monday Night Football fans. Wowsa! But so, yeah, it was a bit noisy, but doesn't really bother me so long as there is a place for me to sit and eat alone. There was.Stouts and darker beers are my favorite, but they didn't have anything on tap here that was worthwhile that night. I thought I would go with the Ommegang on tap -- but it was that new Game of Thrones ale, the ""Mother of Dragons,"" which from previous experience I already knew tastes pretty bad. And I normally worship at the alter of Ommegang! So I ended up getting a Belgian Quad in bottle form, and it cost me a pretty penny. But so what, I like a good trappist ale from time to time. I also ordered the Stout Burger, which was simply amazing! I really enjoyed that burger more than should be possible. And my waitress was really nice and attentive, too, which I greatly appreciated. She was awesome!Stout is a very nice, though humongous sports pub. The dining areas upstairs and in the back seem more private and quiet, so if I ever come here with a date I'd reserve a place there. All in all, a solid spot to grab a beer and some grub in the heart of tourist- and shopping- hell. Will go back again soon.",,,
1,Vegas K.,"Rocky Hill, CT",1,38,13,4.0,11/4/2018,Good beer selection. Above average burgers. Good pizza. All together a thumbs up.It's a bit of a roadhouse atmosphere. Loud and scruffy. So you'll have to be in this sort of a mood. Also a younger demographic.,,,

3,Stephy S.,"Holmdel, NJ",154,646,119,4.0,11/7/2018,"A very easy place by Penn Station/Madison square garden to grab a drink/beer. A very large, popular bar. The bar food is absolutely nothing to write home about, but at least there is a large selection. Just be wary it can be ridiculously loud.",1,,1
4,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",341,79,160,4.0,10/13/2018,Went here last year for my ex co-workers farewell party... great crowd and great people. Love the beers on tap and well as the food menu. Oysters are a bit pricey but you definitely get the bang for your buck here and the lamb chops are some of the best in NYC! Huge Flat screen TVs are all over the bar and a great place to watch sport events. I actually watched the L.A King win the Stanley Cup while having drinks with my former manager.,,,
5,Ayla N.,"Indianapolis, IN",27,19,39,5.0,9/13/2018,"Stopped by Stout with friends after work for apps and drinks. The atmosphere is laidback... a great place to unwind after a busy day. I ordered Loaded Fries and they were delicious! The fries where crisp and smothered w/ bacon, cheese, pickled jalapenos, scallions & avocado ranch... the portion was huge! I maybe ate a 1/3 of it (""before""picture is below).",,,
6,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,4/11/2018,"I can only comment on the beer and the space.We were in the downstairs area, which was extremely spacious and had plenty of room for the puzzle pint meet up. Not too loud here and plenty of lighting They have several stouts on draught and a large selection of bottled stouts. I went with the velvit Merlin oatmeal stout from Firestone Walker, which was smooth, on the sweeter side, and a nice creamy layer on top. Servers here were really friendly and not pushy at all.",2,1,1
7,Simon R.,"Manhattan, NY",212,93,140,3.0,7/8/2018,"Use to come here quite a bit after work with colleagues and it was a good spot to grab a beer or drink at. Their wings are a 6/10 and burger was a 4/10. Not really a fan of their food and neither were my colleagues or friends or joined us as well. They definitely had a great beer selection and a mixed bucket that had 5 craft beers in each (can and/or bottle) for $25. Quite spacious overall and a good ambiance, to say the least. Located a block away from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.",1,,
8,Christine D.,"Lynbrook, NY",35,100,158,2.0,12/28/2017,"I was pretty excited to come here with my friends last night! Stout is always one of our go-to spots when we're not sure where to go and want to stay close to penn station! Unfortunately for us, it was a rangers game night, which was my fault for not checking ahead of time, and the place was packed when we got there at 6.  However, we were told 45 min for a party of 4, put our names down and were able to grab a drink by the bar while we waited so it all worked out without a problem even with the crowd!When we finally sat down we ordered apps to spilt.  One of my personal favs from here is the spinach and artichoke dip with the fresh pita chips! It is just soooo delicious! So of course we ordered this, along with wings and a pizza!  Ughh! To my dismay, the dip came out without pita chips!!! they gave us corn tortilla chips, which was kind of odd if you asked me.  I guess it was a busy night, maybe they ran out, but someone should have apologized considering we paid for the fresh chips and got what almost seemed like bagged tostitos!! I definitely was not happy about that considering I had been waiting all day for the delicious pita chips and dip!!! Plus the worst part, we were only given a sparse amount of full chips, luckily (sarcasm) we also were given a full plate full of broken chop crumbs!! How convenient for dipping (*eyeroll*) The dip was still good but having the right chip really does make a difference!  The rest of the food was okay, the wings were pretty flavorless even though we ordered them medium! The thing crust pizza was good for the type of bar we were at, wouldn't expect much else.All in all, I do usually really enjoy being at Stout! It's a great place to come to catch up with friends and add a quick bite and some drinks!However, hopefully next time I'm there the customer service is better and they will at least acknowledge and apologize when something they bring out is different than what is on the menu!!! Poor customer service is the reason for this two star rating otherwise I'd give it a pretty average 3-Star review! Maybe next time, we'll see!",4,1,1
9,Lieselle B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",759,170,157,3.0,2/6/2018,"Decent bar if you're in the area for an event. That's precisely why I came here. It is within close proximity to Madison Square Garden - about a 3 minute walk - and I was looking for a bar that I could quickly grab a bite and a drink before heading to my event.I came in on a Monday around 4 PM. Their happy hour deal was lacking a little bit. I was looking forward to happy hour but for example, only one of their IPAs was on happy hour for $5 but that was about it - no other deals. We also ordered some sweet potato fries to have with our drinks. The sweet potato fries were good, no complaints. The fries came with a delicious sauce that balanced out the sweetness of the fries.Overall, not a bad bar if you need somewhere quick to go. If i'm ever in the area again, I wouldn't mind coming back to check it out more extensively.",1,,
10,Emily D.,"New York, NY",40,189,340,3.0,12/28/2017,"Came here Wednesday night with a few friends to enjoy some apps and a drink or two. Unfortunately the rangers were playing so it was super crowded when we got there and had to wait around an hour for a table but whatever we had 2 drinks while we waited. The prices for drinks was pretty standard. And they were made correctly. Then again I just ordered a vodka soda so pretty easy lol.  Once we sat down it started to clear out a bit which was ideal (I would definitely check for a ranger game before coming again around that time). Also if you're bringing minors to this bar keep in mind that you're kind of quarantined to the front of the hostess cause they can't be near the bar at all. We decided to order 3 apps to split and a round of beer. We got the spinach artichoke dip, pizza, and wings. This was the perfect amount of food for the 4 of us. The wings were okay. I wish they had more sauce and spiciness to them. The spinach artichoke dip was good as well but wish it came with pita chips instead of crumbles of chips. The pizza was your average bar pizza nothing special but got the job done. The bill came to around $24 each (for four people) which isn't too bad. I'm sure I'll be back soon for a quick drink and something to eat in the future but I won't be rushing back here.",3,1,1
11,Katharine S.,"Arlington, VA",352,588,461,4.0,6/28/2018,"Came here for a drink with one of my friends on a Friday night recently. It wasn't too crowded, but not empty either. Bartenders were friendly. They had Brooklyn lager draft on special for $5, so we had that. We also had their appetizer fries, which were good! They have a pretty decent menu, so good for drinks and dinner/apps too. I would recommend.",1,,
12,Will M.,"Cary, NC",17,136,192,5.0,7/5/2018,"Came in after a long train ride from Newark, wondered a bit around midtown and then remembered from a long time being in an Irish pub around where I was. I had forgotten the name and then saw three right next to each other! It was this one though. I sat down and didn't wait long until I was served. She was cool and got me exactly what I wanted and needed. Rum (she gave me options), ginger beer and lime. It is perfect. The ambience is super chill and peeps in here are hanging out having a good time. Apparently the AC was not working yesterday so must be my lucky (get it?) day because it is on blast today! Love being back in NYC and the USA!",,,
13,Jessica R.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,213,580,4.0,2/17/2018,"My friends and I came here one night to watch a basketball game, and have a couple of drinks and some food. They have TV's all over the bar area, and offer to put on any game you want to watch which was great for us. This place is huge and has different dinning areas and rooms all over, we were seated around the main bar area when you first walk in. Our server came over and was really friendly. She explained the menu and told us what drafts they had on special. We all ordered a round of drinks and got the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer to split. The spinach artichoke dip is serve with these crunchy pita chips, really good. For entrees I got the grilled chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the baked potato pizza. The chicken sandwich was okay,m. No one was really too crazy about the pizza, I thought it was too dry. Overall good service, and decent food. It's a good place to come and grabs a couple of beers and watch a game.",6,2,5
14,Joel S.,"Armonk, NY",10,144,30,2.0,8/23/2018,"Disappointed to say the least.   Ribs were very hard and over cooked.   I asked for extra sauce and they charged me $0.75.   Really???Service was ok, but they charged the wrong beers but the manager ended up comping the beers since I caught it after I signed the check and took a last second look.    I guess you have stick with burgers only.  My friend had chicken pot pie and thought it was ok.   2 1/2 stars for that dish.    The fries were good and there was a good selection of dark beers so I would have given it a 2 1/2 star if I could have.I work next door to Stout on 41st and only had burgers there.  Guess I should stick to burgers as I said above.   Live and learn.",,,
15,Sam C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",15,12,2,4.0,8/27/2018,"When I travel and do not have eating plans with others (who often pick a place), I check two sources: 1) United Mileage Plus Dining because I might as well earn some airline miles while I eat and 2) Yelp to get additional reviews.Since I had already had dinner and was not ready to head back to the hotel I swung around the corner to check out this place. I really like stout beers so I felt compelled to come in.It was Monday around 7:30pm and it was not exactly hopping, but I really like the vibe and atmosphere. The beer selection is pretty good. If you are there with a group, there should be something for everyone in your group.Lots of TVs with sports on that, since I was alone, gave me a chance to just watching a little Yankees baseball.Bartender was nice. I order the Old Rasputin stout. The keg went out halfway through my pour so he gave me what he had (about half a pint) and then poured me a full one out of the new keg. (Bonus points for that move).",,,
16,Dominique D.,"Boonton, NJ",463,291,332,4.0,1/3/2018,"I've been here off and on in the past few years for birthdays, hockey watching, hanging out. The beer prices are what you would expect for Manhattan. They have a good variety of craft beers on draft and in bottles, so there's something for everyone. I've mostly been on the main floor, but I do remember hanging out on the bottom level for holiday events. It's close to the Garden, so it can get crazy packed before and after sports and music events - but it's also nice for a casual dinner. I remember several times just not being impressed by the food. On my latest visit, I noticed that the food is so much better now. They have a good assortment of pub/bar appetizers, and my roasted chicken salad was freaking delicious. The service was also very attentive and pleasant. Keep up the good work - there are so many reasons to hang out here.",5,1,2
17,Steph A.,"Plainview, NY",35,29,2,3.0,8/8/2018,"A friend and I stopped in here for a drink one Saturday afternoon. I liked everything about this place: the ambiance, the large seating areas, the extensive menu for food and drinks...all except for the bartender we had. He was friendly enough, but it seemed that he was sick. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and I ordered a burger and cider, while my friend had several beers and a burger as well. The bartender served us and then disappeared. We had to flag down another bartender, who ended up serving us for the rest of the time we were there. It seemed my hunch was right about the previous bartender because I ended up getting sick with the flu that same night! Would love to go back here, but that experience definitely soured me.",,,
18,Rommel D.,"Aurora, Canada",3,37,61,5.0,8/11/2017,"Right around the corner from Madison Square Garden and walking distance to Times Square, Stout NYC is the place for drinks before or after the game or just a place for drinks and great food. A huge selection of beers on tap, from the bottle, and plenty of spirits. Food is delicious and big portions. Deliciously spiced from steaks to burgers to pub food and reasonably priced sets this place from your local pub.",1,,
19,Joe K.,"New York, NY",3,54,75,5.0,1/21/2018,"We held a corporate event here for 75 customers about a week ago and it went very well. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I was the presenter for the night and Stephanie was extremely helpful with setting up the microphone, projector, etc. The location in general has a very cool but professional vibe which is perfect for a customer event.If you are looking for a place to hold your next event with excellent food, drinks, and service...look no further! We look to be back soon.",1,,
20,Ben E.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,72,63,2.0,12/26/2017,"Stout is a rather large bar in a very busy area. This plus because I actually tried to go to 2 other smaller packed out bars nearby before stumbling across Stout. Unfortunately, the positives end with the size of the bar. The food wasnt very good and the service was poor. . We came her for some bar food and beer after work around 7pm. We ordered a few stouts and some wings to start. The wings were pretty good and were probably the highlight of thr night. Then for entress you ordered the NY stip steak sandwhiches which were awful. The steak was dry, rubbery and tasteless the bun was soggy. This sandwhich wad a co plete fail. After my first 2 bites i was already wishing i had gotten a burger as did my friend. As for the service. We asked for ketchup it took just over 20 minutes. I would have let it slide but she past by our table a few times with no ketcup in hand. She did not appear to be overwhelemed with other tables either. Also, we waited about 25 minutes for the check (good thing we were not in a rush). I really wanted to like this place but, I would not come back to Stout.",2,,
21,Jeremy W.,"Queens, NY",1514,243,883,5.0,5/20/2017,"Whenever i go to sporting events at Msg, i always pregame at stout. With all the bars in manhattan its real hard to find a bar to choose from, but when i came here with a buddy at the last Knicks game i came to i was impressed. Stout is freaking huge with huge up and down stair bar layout. The main floor is always packed, so i highly recommend the downstairs. Its real laid back and cozy. The staff is always great and always attentive with making sure you get your food fast. The crowd is always great as well. I never came here and there was any nonsense as far as fight or anything. The food here is why i love stout. They have a lot of things to order from, but every time i come here i always notice a lot of burgers coming out the kitchen. I always go with what i see everyone ordering to play it safe, you really cant ruin a burger and if so i will not be coming back. The burgers here and the beer selection is great. They offer a huge draft and bottle beer selection as well as special drinks. The wings here are pretty good as well and probably the only two things i get when i come. If you are in the area and looking for a cool bar to come before a game or anything i highly recommend stout. I never came here and was disappointed, especially how crowded it gets. Food and service has always been on point and thats what keeps me coming back.",11,7,9
22,Marianne K.,"Congers, NY",107,3,1,5.0,10/4/2018,"Food was amazing! If you are looking for a place to go to eat and drink close to MSG, I highly recommend their burger and fries!! Rose cider is amazing too!!",,,

24,Ashley O.,"Springfield, VA",94,126,152,3.0,11/28/2017,"My husband & I came here for a quick bite to eat before seeing the Rangers play at MSG. When we sat down we immediately put an appetizer in as well as our meal because they seemed to be busy and we didn't want to miss the game. We informed our waitress we were in a hurry as well.The waitress was very kind and the service was good, but not excellent. There were a few managers walking around as well to help out the wait staff so that definitely helped.For an appetizer we ordered a pretzel. For dinner we both ordered a burger with fries. After waiting about 45 minutes for food our burgers arrived, but the pretzel never made it. The manager was very kind and removed it from our order and offered us a round of drinks on him to compensate for the mistake. The burger was delicious and the fries are hand cut and home made..very yummy!",1,,

They have a great selection on tap and good food. I was seated immediately even though the place was packed. I started with a Troegs Chocolate Stout which was fantastic. Beautiful color and perfectly poured. Dinner was the angry burger. A burger dipped in franks red hot, topped with blue cheese and fried onions. It hit the spot.

She not only remembered us, but remembered where we were sitting, and what we drank, and left us a card before she left for her break.

28,Tariel T.,"Mount Vernon, NY",24,84,88,5.0,4/21/2018,"Decided on this spot based on a friend's decision to come here. If you're into beer, this is the place to go. However they do have an extensive whisky menu, some of the names were very interesting and they were delicious. I like the vibe of the place. The patrons seem very relaxed but open to the crowd. I met a couple who decided to give me and one of my friends some false names to add to the fun night we were having.

29,Trent T.,"Nutley, NJ",42,156,389,3.0,3/21/2017,"Whenever there is a big fight in the garden Stout is generally our preamble for it. This passed weekend was no exception and I was beyond excited to return for some cold beers and great food. Well, we didn't get off to the greatest start as 2 of our favorite beers turned out to be kicked. Quite disappointing to come to a bar that boasts such a large selection to find that most of what you want, isn't there. Nevertheless, we ordered the big pretzel and the rock shrimp to start. The big pretzel, is an absolute show stopper. It's huge, it's delicious, get it. The rock shrimp on the other hand, a little disappointing. They were about the size of a quarter, for the price I would advise against. For entrees I had the chicken salad with the prosciutto and asparagus. It was great, it was exactly what I wanted nice and light and full of flavor I cleaned the bowl! The others had bacon cheeseburgers and they were on point. Cooked correctly and the fries were nice and crisp! Overall, I love this place but I was a little disappointed about them not having my beer on tap that night. I understand these things happen, but my next time around might be to a different restaurant.",2,,1

Definitely a go to for me.Pros: Food is good and basic. You know what you're going to get and as far as bar food goes, lots of options and pretty tasty. I recommend a burger as a meal, but apps there are many good options.Cons:They DO NOT...and I repeat DO NOT do happy hour. Why? They don't have to! This place is always popping and they know they don't need to do a drink deal for happy hour.Drinks:Pinot Grigio-Ehh it was okay, wouldn't recommend it. Tasted cheap.Tito's and soda: This was good! Very impressed with a drink that is so basic. Wish I had ordered this from the start.Foods:I just did apps.Pizza..half cheese, half buff chicken. Very good surprisingly. Super thin crust.Rockin' Shrimp, this was AWESOME. Definitely recommend it.Chicken finger- Not much to say here and how can you really mess those up.Spinach and artichoke dip--WORTH IT.Again, great place before games.

I wouldn't be opposed to coming for a quick drink before a game or whatever but I will not dine here anymore. The service and food were both sub par (for the most part).I'll start with the highlights and the only 2 things I enjoyed. The giant pretzel for an appetizer was good, it was fresh and warm when it arrived to the table. I paid the extra $2 for the cheese dipping sauce and was super disappointed by it. It was served hard and cold, I asked the waitress about it and she said that's how it is supposed to be. Yuck, no thank you. I will point out that the waitress did have the extra $2 charge removed from my bill so we did not touch the cheese dip at all and I appreciate that. We also ordered a side of onion rings and these were very good and fresh.Everything else was kinda ehhhh, I've had way better. The burger was very mediocre, bland and sort of tasteless, not juicy at all. I also made the mistake of getting mashed potatoes as my side (since they ran out of sweet potato fries at 12PM on a Sunday, weird?). The mashed potatoes arrived to the table cold, another disappointment. The rest of my party had ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, which I tasted and also found to be bland and tasteless. Also, our waitress was kind of MIA a lot, we had to hunt her down to fill our water cups and what not. All said and done this meal cost me around $70 and I left totally unsatisfied. Pretty expensive lunch in general and especially expensive when all the food pretty much stunk.",6,2,2

Updated review","My husband and I have enjoyed going to Stout for almost five years. We've brought family and friends there multiple times. Last night we had family in from England. We reserved a table for 11 of us and I was happy to see we were seated at my favorite table in the restaurant. Things went downhill from there. Service was slow, especially considering it wasn't a busy night (with no games or shows across the street at The Garden.). We ordered waters all around, only received 7 glasses. We ordered two bottles of wine and 6 glasses, we only received 5 glasses. Getting refills on water or other drinks wasn't easy. The busing staff was however on top of their game frequently clearing empty appetizer plates and glasses - a little too eager as they removed my wine glass when we had a full bottle left on the table. When our food arrived, my order was wrong. They rushed a new dinner for me and it came out shockingly quick. I think my dinner was too rushed as it came back up at 3am. Our waiter left for the night halfway thru our meal.  It remained clear that no one wanted to refill our drinks or sell us more of anything we so cut our time there short, left 10%, and took our group elsewhere. This could've easily been a more beneficial night for the restaurant and its wait staff but no one except the hostess seemed to want to make our experience hospitable. Fast forward to several months later when my family and I were in NYC for a show. We returned to the place we love so much - Stout- for a hearty meal on a snowy night. The staff - attentive, personable, fun, and on their A game. The food-Buttery pretzel with cheese dip that would give the best Mac and cheese you've ever had a solid run for its money. The wings - glad to have those $5 Brooklyn lagers to wash down the spiceyness. Cooked to perfection with the right ratio of breading to sauce. Firecracker shrimp- my father says there is none like it, had two orders, and will make every attempt possible to sweet talk our waitress into finding the recipe. Strip steak sandwich - a hearty meal filling for a cold winter's day. Perfect combo of thin steak, Asiago, and the bread!Ribs - were the unexpected winners but the care the staff puts into making them was evident in their fall off the bone yumminess. Thank you to Stout for a fantastic experience!",2,,
35,Neela S.,"Irvine, CA",15,177,142,3.0,9/11/2017,"Service - not attentive. It takes a long time to get drinks, food and someone to take orders!Drinks - excellent when it arrives! Variety of stouts Prices- very reasonable for the locationAmbience - the inside of this place is huge and it has 3 floors which is why I don't get tables being that close to each other! Food - the food is awesome if it's not busy if it is well then you're screwed!Desserts - deliciousThis was my 5th visit to Stout and it gets worse with each visit. It's a decent establishment so it's rather disappointing !!",1,,

None of us were in a super drink-y mode so perhaps that interfered with our enjoyment of the place. They enjoyed the wings and fish and chips. I ordered the veggie burger and it was okay. Good service. Overall, a nice place if you like that type of standard American bar fare.",1,,
37,Lauren B.,"Sunnyside, NY",25,213,0,4.0,8/6/2018,My husband and I had dinner on a Friday nite.  We sadly were seated by the stairs on the upstairs level but luckily it wasnt too much in the way of the staircase.  Our burger dinners were good.  It wasnt too loud considering it was after work hours but its not all that cool in there since its a very big space to cool.,,,
38,Leann H.,"Philadelphia, PA",185,100,108,2.0,1/3/2018,"This review is based on one experience from somebody who lives in Philly, so take that as you may.Came here one night with my husband to watch the St. John's game only to find that when we arrived, around half time, the game was not already on. I don't remember what was on exactly, but they were happy to change the channel. The beer selection was fine but the wines were way overpriced. Granted, it was a large glass of wine but I just can't justify paying $10 for a glass of wine when I know the whole bottle is only like $13. Oh well, it's New York. We ordered the wings and they were absolutely DISGUSTINGLY SALTY! I mean spit them out and down a glass of water kind of salty. The outside of them had some kind of breading which undoubtedly soaked up way too much sauce, leading to the excessive salt intake. I am used to good old-fashioned un-breaded wings. I was only able to finish one before giving up. My husband and I opted to go somewhere else for actual dinner as a result of these wings. I don't think I'll be back.",4,2,1
39,Gatangalie S.,"Queens, New York, NY",429,286,2949,4.0,12/24/2016,"Stout have many locations in NYC, but highly recommend visiting them in Herald Square. One of the most popular sports bar in midtown to enjoy affordable drinks, food, good choices of music, and/or watch a game. Most of us usually meet here for drinks before going to the Garden for a concert or game. Stout is literally 5 minutes or so walking distance from the Garden and close to all public transportation.I'm a big fan of their chicken tenders, fries, and wings. My buddy usually orders their burgers. They have a good selection of craft beer and all types of hard core liquor.I have never tried their house wine, but would definitely order in the future.",6,3,6

I will continue to go here when I make my next stop in NYC!,1,,
41,Maulik M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",321,297,885,3.0,2/25/2017,"Since this Stout location is close to Penn Station, the place gets packed very quickly, especially around Garden events. Since I work in the area few of my coworkers end up here at least couple of times month for quick lunch or happy hours after work. They have a great selection of craft beers on tap and bottles. The food is delicious and comes out quickly. The service is very good. Stout has a large main bar on the first floor and additional bars downstairs for private events. The place has a nice authentic Irish atmosphere. Service is very friendly, pleasant, and efficient!",,,
42,Nicola M.,"Flushing, NY",1,8,6,3.0,10/9/2018,"My husband works not too far from Stouts and he has always raved about their buttermilk chicken tenders. He finally took me their about two years ago and I fell in love with them. They were absolutely the best tenders I'd ever had. Juicy on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside. Paired with their avocado ranch sauce was absolutely to die for. I loved them so much that he would occasionally bring them on Friday nights for our drive into the Poconos. Today I had an off site meeting close to his work and stouts. We decided to catch a bite there for lunch. I was dreaming about them all day...being pregnant and all I couldn't wait to have them. When they finally arrived I was totally disappointed. They were not the same delicious tenders that we usually get but some sort of generic brand you'd buy in bulk from one of those whole sale places. I was so, so disappointed. My hubby said maybe it was a different batch or may be an off day. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Coming home though I couldn't help think about what we received. To eagerly wait all day for these just to be disappointed was such a buzz kill. I didn't want to complain because I only had an hour for lunch and had to rush back to my meeting. None the less I was not impressed. Please bring back the tenders I remember...I mean if your paying 12 plus you'd expect them to at least taste Home made and not something you can pull out of the freezer.",,,
43,Alex A.,"Brooklyn, NY",398,164,49,4.0,7/11/2018,Biggest and arguably the best wings in New York City. Always friendly staff although occasional wait times for tables can be a bit annoying.

Clearly, we will not be back, but will follow Emmy, as she was referred to us to to visit by our dear friends and colleagues.  Way to make a already uncomfortable situation in a establishment worse - I don't think I have ever seen that happen while eating on vacation.",1,,

This place is a close-to-Penn Station staple.The short: this is a fun, spacious, lively sports bar. The longer: We went to the Knicks game on Sunday and decided to pop over to stout for football (aka spinach and artichoke dip), and called ahead to reserve a high top table. The hostess told us they only take walk ins for high tops, but that we shouldn't have a problem.So, we got there, and it was a bit crowded but not crazy and we put our name down for a high top table on the first floor. We ordered pumpkin beers (they had a whole list but only two kinds left), and waited. The hostess showed my friend a table that was almost finished, so we were surprised when she gave that exact table to a group of guys ""because they were annoying her and she wanted them out of her hair."" We ended up having to go downstairs after waiting for 20 mins.The service and food downstairs was great. The giant pretzel is kind of unbelievably delicious, but the hostess upstairs killed the vibe for us. The spinach and artichoke dip mildly made up for it.",1,,

Food: we ordered quite a few things.. the brat burger was okay, but the burger itself was overcooked. Fish and chips - had a weirdly thick breading that felt like it was from a corn dog. The fish was so so and the fries were okay. Mac n cheese was better than almost everything else, at least more flavor and pasta wasn't overcooked. But the cheese used wasn't all that special. 2 stars.Drinks: great selection of beer to choose from and the server knows the beer selection pretty good. 5 stars. Overall average is about 3 stars.. nothing amazing but I wouldn't say don't eat here, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.",1,,

Shepherd's pie (a few bites) were scrumptious, better than cod and chips. I liked the hospitality of the waitress on the 2nd floor and loved the amount of chips I got. Service was chill for a busy day and loved the flags of the World Cup on the walls and hanging on the rafters. Hope to be back soon, though nothing looked appetizing from the food menu.",,,
53,Alan A.,"Queens, NY",125,324,1952,3.0,11/22/2016,"In the past before a show at Madison Square Garden we would stop into Stout for a brew and some food. We decided to go again last night before Billy Joel's show at the Garden. The show by the way was 2.5 hours of great music. Wish I could say the same for the food.Their menu has changed. One of my favorites in the past, bangers and mash, is no longer offered. So I ordered the bratwurst burger with sauerkraut, red cabbage, lettuce tomato, red onion, fries and a pickle. Sauerkraut and red cabbage on the side. My wife ordered the chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese and apple slices also served with fries, my wife chose sweet potato fries. My bratwurst was served just like I'd ordered. It was juicy and properly cooked. The fries were well cooked and not soggy. My wife's chicken on the other hand was dry and overcooked. ""It lacked seasoning and flavor, and why do they think that sweet potato fries need sugar on them"". She also mentioned this would be her last time eating here.At least my Guinness stout was properly poured. If it's one thing they excel in at Stout it's beer. If you stick with that you can't go wrong.",,,

Downstairs they sometimes have karaoke and fun things like that going on.Came here on Wednesday for a quick bite before the Knicks game. Place was packed (usually is) but there were still some tables available. Chardonnay was tasty, but they primarily are a beer location- very wide selection. Appetizer we did the creamy spinach cheese and artichoke dip. They serve it with crispy pita chips. Very good and large enough to share with a group. Entrees we both did the angry burger which is a burger dipped in Franks red hot. But to be honest the burger was not that spicy. I had regular fries and the other was sweet potato fries for an up charge. They also have a few different different dipping sauces. I personally love the Lemon Pepper Aioli to dip my fries in! They have others like a special Stout sauce, Red Pepper Aioli & more! Definitely try, only 50cents for each. For 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, appetizer & 2 burgers bill came out to around $85 and then tip. We were in & out in 50minutes. Great location, great food & drinks! Definitely stop by if in the area and hungry/thirsty!",5,2,5

Updated review","I've been coming here at least 2-3 times a year for the last five years. The decor, ambiance is the same, but the quality of the food and service feels different.During my most recent experience at Stout NYC, when I asked for the normal sodas I would order (root beer, diet coke, cream soda) - literally everything was out and they recommended a diet cream soda, but that just sounded really bad so I just stuck with a coke.  The servers usually bring a plate of condiments to add on our pizza or calamari, but this time they only brought salt and pepper. The quantity and quality of the food isn't the same. We ordered our usual fried calamari with marinara and lemon aioli sauce. They really skimped on the calamari this time around. They used to give a lot more calamari, not sure what happened. The calamari was also tasteless.  We also ordered our usual Wisconsin Style Thin Crust Pizza with mushrooms and applewood smoked bacon. The pizza was crunchy, but the quality didn't taste the same as it used to.The only positive item was that the sweet potato fries came out perfect, not too sweet and crunchy as it should be.I used to love going to STOUT, but I really don't want the quality of STOUT NYC to sink below, but if it does in my next trip than there's definitely an issue of inconsistency.",4,1,1
60,Kaitlyn T.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",26,56,5,4.0,2/8/2018,Came here with coworkers before a Knicks game. The beer list is extensive and a food is typical American bar food. Service was good and attentive (helpful to get to the game on time). The waitress did have a hard time making beer suggestions to several foreign coworkers that were unfamiliar with many American beer brands but not beer in general.,1,,1
61,Percy D.,"Flushing, NY",81,156,299,4.0,7/18/2017,"Whenever someone mentions getting drinks in and around Penn Station, Stout NYC is the first place that comes to mind.It is a large space that can still get pretty packed for a sporting event and, like others have mentioned, it is not exactly cheap (but not overpriced for the area, either).  But if you're a beer connoisseur, you'll enjoy your visit to Stout.  (By the way, I use ""connoisseur"" loosely and with multiple spellchecks.  As long as you don't list Bud Light or Coors as your all-time best beer ever, I'll consider you a conno-something.)Stout fits the bill for a good vibe during a major sporting event.  During an off period (say, July when the Mets and Yankees are not playing) Stout is also a comfortable place to catch up with someone.  This is exactly what I did on a recent Thursday night; though I originally only found one open bar stool, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a cluster of seats to become available.Specifically speaking of their drinks and food, I've found on multiple visits that their staff is pretty knowledgeable and helpful when selecting beers, if you need help paring down their extensive list.  I've also had their burgers, fries, calamari, etc. and I've never once had a meal  (or appetizer to pick at) I was dissatisfied with.Great beer selection, good bar food and good vibes makes Stout a solid choice in this area of Manhattan.",2,,2
62,Sandra Lorena V.,"Manhattan, NY",140,162,214,4.0,7/14/2017,"STOUT IS A SOLID DINNER/BAR. I've been here four times. On a Saturday night I came here on a date( previously we were always in groups.) Seeing that the place wasn't so packed, I felt relaxed. Don't get me wrong, it can be packed but the place is big. They have a back, a back to their back, a small balcony AND a downstairs.Our server Robert, was attentive and gave us suggestions to try the summer/seasonal drinks. Other servers we had in the past have also been attentive and accommodating.. (Once we had a friend who could not have COLD beer and they tried to get us bottled/canned beer that wasn't out in the bar yet.) Whether I've had an IPA, a chocolate stoute, a seasonal Ommegang beer or a really foreign beer I can't pronounce, I've found they are all great choices. I joke that they should have a print-out of the beer menu for me to keep checking off what I've tried. If only- that'd be cool!As for the food: The Ahi Tuna salad was enjoyable, as were the sweet potato fries. I felt like the fries did not even need a sauce, but for the heck of it we tried the spicy mustard sauce for an extra kick. The pizza here is also delicious. As a side note: the first time I ever walked into this bar I saw nothing but middle aged people in suits. I find that the crowd varies and you can always have a nice time.",1,1,1

Food is pretty good too. Thumbs up on sweet potato fries! My last visit though was way off. I ordered an angry burger aka a patty covered in Frank's red hot sauce. It came out not so angry aka missing the sauce. I sent it back and the server brought me a ""new one"", and now the only thing angry between my burger and I, was me. This was the second patty lacking the very menu defining hot sauce. How do you send me two burgers both without the name defining ingredient? Needless to say I wasn't too happy. I had to just get a side of hot sauce and angrify it myself. Oh well. They were nice enough to comp my meal. So that is a plus. I'll definitely be back.

I came on a Friday evening and for an area full of seedy looking Irish pubs, this is one of the more decent looking joints in terms of atmosphere and crowd. They don't really have a happy hour, it's beer-centric (go for it). The service was super spotty when we ordered food. Water like 20 min after constantly asking, and the food was on the ok side (but the portions are huge). We ordered sweet potato fries, potstickers, the cheese fries (I guess their take on nachos), and another dish which obviously wasn't very memorable. I liked the potstickers the best, but I heard good things about the wings and lamb of course. I loved the price! Might not be back -",1,,

The mini cheese burgers were ok. Definitely a big shout out to all the staff. They were so nice and caring. Even though I was all the way in the back, they came and check on us every 15 minutes or so, and brought us food.I didn't stay for long cause I had a flight to catch. But this place is cool!

There was an event going on downstairs and upstairs was just as crowded passing the 6 o'clock mark. Given the amount of crowd and attention that should be given to every customer, I did not get that. The bartenders were basically rushing us to get our drinks and when I asked what were the happy hour specials, they said none and didn't offer to point out on the menu what was their $5 special that night, so at the end when my boyfriend paid, we were appalled since one of the bartenders told us that all the draught beers were $5...too good to be true but they had given us the wrong information. I could not wait to finish my drink and leave. Almost didn't want to give tip as well. I get it. You're busy and overwhelmed with all the people at the bar. Really.

Some friends were visiting from out of town/out of country and we picked here because it was close to their hotel. We were seated right away, and took our time looking over the drink menu. Quite a wonderful selection of beer. We had a lot of fun trying different ones.I believe I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. I remember the dipping sauce being amazing, i think it was a honey mustard kind of deal. The staff was good up until a certain point. Mid-way through our service our waitress changed, since the first one's shift was over. Totally understandable, but the new waiter was either new or just not very good. It took a long time for us to flag her down, and when we went to pay the bill, she charged our cards wrong - the wrong price and on the wrong cards. We had to stand with her while she fixed the mistake but she still didn't understand what was wrong. This seems like an isolated incident, and it wouldn't steer me away from coming back.

The bartender named Marcus was amazing and he  Helped ice with all of our drinks and he gave us an entire section where we sat only ate dinner. It was a little dark and intamite  but it was perfect setting. While we waited we played darts for about 30 minutes and then our food came. There was so much food that we couldn't finish it.  We ordered 2 orders of Buffalo wings which were greatly finished majority of it avacado toast was really creamy and wonder fall the kind of fish-and-chips was great it was and even fishy the steak sandwich was amazing and it was fully cut and the grilled chicken sandwich was amazing as well. I'm so surprised at this home a wall place was such a wonderful experience especially after the holidays. If your going to come here ask for Marcus. He's great and definitely made our experience so much better!!!!,,,

Nice atmosphere.,,,
83,Catherina D.,"Trenton, NJ",1,19,0,3.0,8/13/2017,"Located a half a block down from MSG/penn station, Stout offers beer and food. The prices aren't great but not bad considering you're in a tourist hub. The inside looks like a typical bar with dark wood bar, tables, and chairs. Large screens display sports lined up behind the bar. I ordered the fish and chips. I don't know if it's traditional but I received a grainy mustard dip, instead of a tarter sauce, for my battered fish and fries. The batter was soggy with oil and the fried tasted stale. My friends enjoyed their burgers and the other a salad. FYI: if you're male you cannot wear a tank top into the pub. Luckily my friend had a sweatshirt to pull over.",,,

86,Joanna N.,"New York, NY",846,415,2009,3.0,6/13/2016,"My friend and I stopped by Stout for a quick dinner before an event at MSG. The close proximity was the main reason. The place was bustling as expected for the area. We didn't have to wait for a table though so that was a plus. We zigzagged our way through the crowd and made our way upstairs where it was a tad more quiet, although not by much. I was stuck between fish and chips and the shrimp and crab burger so I had our waiter choose -- burger it was. My friend had the grilled chicken sandwich.Our food came out ridiculously fast, maybe 7 minutes tops. The burger was surprisingly quite good though. The patty was thick and there was a ton of shredded crab and shrimp in it. The fries, however, were barely warm. Service was spotty.This spot fits the bill if you're in the area for an event like I was but isn't a final destination.",7,2,3

I shared a romantic moment at their Financial District location when my girlfriend and I were first dating, so I was quite intent to take her to one of their other outlets while we were back in Manhattan this weekend.The 33rd Street establishment is easily as large as the one downtown, with (at least) two full bars, extensive dining seating, numerous high tables and a great karaoke setup downstairs. I was thrilled to see so many new brews on tap and listed on their lovely beer menu. My girlfriend and I started with a pint of Ommegang Nirvana IPA and a Brooklyn Brewery sour ale, before diving into a Hitachino Lacto (sadly quite unpleasant) and a Great Divide double IPA (smoother than anticipated).Being from the Southwest, it was nice to see Left Hand's Nitro Milk Stout on tap, and one of my companions enjoyed a bottle of Breckenridge Vanilla Porter.

After seeing many empty tables and asking to move, the waiter and hostess still said there was no where else we could sit.

The bartender, Damon, is amazing! He is engaging and friendly, and he provides excellent customer service. His food recommendations were spot on, and our drinks were never empty.

During games, they have a large selection of craft beer buckets for $25 or $20 buckets of bud light. Such a good deal. I had the crabmeat and rock shrimp burger. It was basically a giant delicious crabcake sandwich. I'd definitely recommend. My friends also had the turkey burger, chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries and liked them all.",3,1,1

Updated review","I was ecstatic to return back to Stouts because the last time I went with my dad he and I had an amazing time. Sadly, this time it wasn't as pleasant as I thought it was going to be. A few friends and I came in around 5 o'clock to eat dinner before we went to the Rangers and Dallas Stars game. We were greeted in a friendly manner and went downstairs to get to our table. The people upfront were nice and the food we received was satisfactory. The main issue with this time was that the waitress my friends and I had was extremely rude and didn't pay much attention to us. I'm guessing it was because we were a bunch of young guys and she thought we weren't going to tip her well (in which we did). Yes, I did take into consideration that the restaurant was extremely crowded and she could be overwhelmed, but that didn't mean she had to speak to us in a negative manner (we would understand).It all started when I ordered chicken wings to share with my friends; I asked her is there a sauce that comes on the side for the wings. She looked at me as if I had three heads, and in a nasty manner she said ""you know it already comes on the wings."" I already knew that there was a sauce on top of the wings (we ordered them mild) all I wanted to know was if there was a side of ranch sauce for example that comes with it. She as a waitress didn't seem to enjoy her job and took it out on us with a poor attitude. I mean I get it, everyone once in a while has a bad day, but treating customers with a smile and a happy attitude isn't that hard to do. Our waitress would disappear and not show up at our table for at least 30 minutes to see if we needed anything else. Paying for the check was also a long process as well because it took the waitress at least 20 minutes to return our change. Overall, I'm disappointed with my experience at Stouts this time. I don't think I'm going to be completely done with it though. I'll be back in the future when I'm going to Madison Square Garden for a Rangers game. I just hope that their waiters/waitresses attitudes are more positive towards their future guests because the next time that I go and if it's the same attitude I won't return.",2,,

We came here for a little pregame before the Ranger game. It's a great location down the block from MSG. Food is not bad, typical bar fare but I was a little surprised how small the actual menu is. We had the dumplings and a couple burgers and fries. Went well with a couple beers...had a great setup too to watch any of your favorite teams, tons of TV'S. In summary for Stout, if you want a few cocktails and some bar food watching the game, check it out...if you're looking for something with a large menu selection or quiet dinner only, I'd look elsewhere.",2,,

This was always the ""go to"" spot for pre-gaming Rangers/Knicks games and a place to either celebrate or drown out sorrows afterStopped in before a Rangers game last weekend, and it's absolutely the same atmosphere as I remember. As they opened, blue-shirt clad faithful poured in, and within a half hour it was packed house. I've always thought their prices were relatively reasonable for its location, especially for beers. Service is very quick and smooth to get people out before the puck drops. Tables are more plentiful than I remember, but still limited, so if you're looking to get a meal in before the game, get there early.The menu has changed throughout the years, but you can't go wrong with a burger. Went with the ""angry burger"" - dipped in franks red hot and covered with blue cheese and crispy onion peels. Went perfectly with the Ommegang beer on tap and gave me just the boost I needed before the gamePost game tends to get a bit more crowded, but with neighboring bars that serve as ""back-up"" options, you can't go wrong with at least making the attempt to check it out",3,4,2

They also have a large section in the back and downstairs that would be great for events or larger groups.We sat at the bar and really enjoyed talking with NIcholas, our bartender, who was very attentive, provided some great recommendations on food and drink orders, and took care of us. The bar had a really friendly atmosphere from the server to the crowd as everyone was focused on and celebrating their respective games on the numerous big screen tvs throughout the bar.

It was noisy, loud nondescript music playing, but it all worked fine for us as we could still carry on a conversation.I was only there for one drink, but the bartenders were quick to come over, take my order and produce the aforementioned drink - a goose and soda.  I do recommend this place for a pre-game drink or a pre-train drink.",4,,3

If you get the burger, it comes with a small amount of fries, which is why I get an extra side of fries. We also get the loaded fries which is good too. Love the environment.

Nice and big! Obviously- crowded haha It's Manhattan! I don't think any spot is ever ""not crowded"" when it comes to NYC haha. Conveniently, located a block away from MSG! Very good prices too. I bought a round of drinks consisting of two beers and one liquor drink and it came to just 24 bucks. Not bad at all. I feel most places in the city woulda charged 10 bucks a glass of whatever you're having. So that was a huge plus. Not to mention they actually filled up the glasses with the good stuff- so you are definitely getting your money's worth. I did notice the yummy food plates walking past me - I will have to go back and try some of the food here! Looked very tempting.

He arrived and he told me that we were going downstairs to the karaoke bar. Whew! The karaoke bar was quirky and fun. Lots of people my age and lots of grown ass men singing boy band songs. Weird but Haha! Also, lots of comic-con attendees in costume singing karaoke. I thought it was cool that the two levels of the bar had completely different atmospheres.

They have a bigger selection of bottled stouts than draft. It changes frequently so check their website for up to the minute selection. Stopped in for a quick bite and brew. Draft selection is alright...nothing too impressive. Menu didn't wow me as well. A few apps and a good amount of burgers to choose from. Staff: Friendly and efficient.Food: Bratwurst burger was ground up bw with sauerkraut, pickled cabbage and spicy mustard. It was crispy on the outside, bonus, and delcious on the inside. Their frites were less than appetizing. I guess they were from the bottom of the bin because they were small, crispy and oily.

But in a good way that makes you want to be there and take it all in. It's so popular that there is a downstairs. What what! My friend and I were given a table downstairs immediately, which was impressive given how filled it was, on a Wednesday night no less. He ordered the ribs and I ordered a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. Let me just say that the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. I couldn't stop eating them! Burger was solid.

I went downstairs to the bar and wanted to purchase a shot of hennessy. I asked the bar tender (white male with a Justin Bieb wannabe haircut might I add) for a ""shot of henny"", he looked at me like I was crazy. He asked ""henny? what's henny?"" Like are you serious? Then he tried to belittle me by asking me if this was my first time at the bar. Like wtf? He was actually seriously asking me as if I didn't belong there. What does that have to do with anything and what part of English doesn't he understand, wasn't he supposed to be a bartender and know what ""henny"" is? So yes, I had a bad experience after being mocked by someone who's job was to know what drink I wanted. He had ONE job.",2,3,1

Updated review","Stout NYC you have my vote! Read on yelpers!I stopped in for the Rangers game after a quick stop in at Macy's, had a business to take care of.I am a wine drinker but sometimes I order beers because some bars have bad wine. I asked my bartender how is Pinot Grigio she said it was pretty good and without me asking she poured me a taste. And it was good!I was bit hungry and I ordered mini burgers, but I was disappointed just by looking at it, I felt like it was all buns no beef Lol more disappointed once I took a bite, it was burnt and dried, especially i asked for medium.Voilà I got fresh cooked mini burgers my bartender had no problem getting me a new plate. But the more pleasing surprise when I got my bill they took the burgers off and only charged me for my two glasses of wine. Stout NYC you got my vote LolAfter my first glass was empty my bartender asked me if I want another one, while she was getting me a glass another bartender noticed my glass was empty and she asked me if I would another glass. Service on point!!! And the bartenders here are not on their phone when they were talking to me or pouring my drinks. And to think of it no bartenders are looking at their cell phone here not like the other Sports bar i was in 2 days ago.I always liked stout NYC but I don't always come here and I would go to other sports bars many times (no more wasting time debating which sports bars) but now on I will be coming here so much more often!It would've been 5 stars here for me except the mini burgers were just ok or was it the buns.... I will definitely eat something else",2,1,2
147,Mitch E.,"Brooklyn, NY",836,1027,445,2.0,2/5/2015,"Are you here because you're going to a show or game at MSG? NO?!?! Then what the hell are you doing at this place? The only reason to come here is to have some drinks and/or a bite to eat before heading to MSG. Is your friend throwing their party here? What is wrong with your friend?You want to bring a date here? They should leave you!A buddy of mine thinks we should start the night there? The night could start there, but it would be the end of my friendship with them. Is that place unbearable, no. Could I think of a thousand places I'd rather go for a drink and a bite to eat in New York City, yes. The biggest drawback here is the crowd. Too many people, and they are not a fun bunch. Bridge and tunnel city. And it is packed out like crazy. IT sucks the fun right out of you. It's hard to get a drink at times. It's not really the bartenders faults. It's really packed, they're trying, but be aware you're going to be waiting forever. And due to the crowd, you'll be moving around a bit. As a result, your bartender isn't going to remember you. You still better tip nice, pal!The food is subpar. I got some sliders once, and they were bad. As I mentioned, what Stout has going on for itself is the location. Super close to MSG. Try it during a weekday before an event. On the weekend, you might be better off finding something in K Town.",5,4,2
148,Steph M.,"West Orange, NJ",259,23,3,3.0,5/31/2017,"Awesome spot to watch the Rangers! I came here for one of the playoff games and it was so much fun because it was full of fans. They gave free shots whenever the Rangers scored a goal and then they also played the goal song. The food and drinks are a little pricey, but it's NYC so I'm not surprised at all. In the basement of the place I had absolutely no service on my phone, which never happens. Not sure if it was because of so many people being there? Not sure if that's a problem since it's 2017 but whatever! Overall, a very fun place to watch a game I can't wait to come here next season to cheer on the Rangers!",,,

But for the price you feel ripped off. I really only go here for Rangers games. Its a great atmosphere and they put the sound on. They also do this stupid ""free"" shot gig when the Rangersscore but there is little if any alcohol in the blue mystery shot.One annoyance is that there is no service in the bar, especially in the basement. Yet there is no sign as to their wifi password. Overall, a decent bar before or during Rangers games but wouldn't be there for other occasions.",1,,

151,Kevin E.,"Rochester, NY",260,10,23,5.0,2/15/2016,"Visiting NYC for the Westminster Dog Show, wanted  a casual place to grab delicious comfort food. Stalked Yelp and narrowed it down to Stout or Feile. Chose Stout and was SO GLAD we did!Great ambience for a sports bar  - gothic light fixtures, illuminated stacked stone walls, warm rich wood work.Beer - great list, with a featured $5 special of the night. Got lucky that tonights was Victory Storm Imperial Stout. Had a seasonal winter selection but it was all IPAs.Food - we had the pretzel and buffalo calamari. The calamari was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Fried calamari is very tricky and most chefs end of overcooking it. It should always be flash fried, only exposed to the hot oil for a brief amount of time... otherwise it gets tough and rubbery. When I say this calamari was soft and tender, I am not exaggerating. I never wanted it to end. For dinner I had the Jerk Pork burger - juicy and full of flavor. Service - incredibly attentive! Our waiter Victor was funny, down to earth, and made sure we were taken care of. The manager also came around to check in and take orders if needed.Also everyone who works here is beautiful.

Overpriced beers and stuck up service. It's like they judged my party or something I mean the nerve of the bartender after serving us our beer, takes our drink away and mine while I'm taking my first sip! Has to be one of the most disrespectful things to have been done to me. Talk to people and explain the situation , no need to act all idk dumb and disrespectful and take all our drinks away. Definitely  need to upgrade to way better service and should learn a couple of things with being respectful and proper. The bartender who rudely did that without saying a word. Also the bodyguard being told what to do by the bartender who just disrespectfully took our drinks. Worst service ever, save your time and go somewhere else that's less crowded and respectable staff. Definitely anywhere else but this place!! Never again! Anything and everything is better then this. My first review and I'm glad it was this one.",,,

156,Neal W.,"New York, NY",58,129,0,3.0,12/17/2015,"Owner responded in the most helpful way about my experience and I do believe now it was a series of breaks in communication and procedure. ************************Disappointing experience for a planned event. Called weeks in advance and said I wanted to host 35 to 40 people for beers and appetizers. They said they had a 'couch area' downstairs that would be perfect. Arrived at scheduled time and the couch area was covered with outerwear and packages of customers. No effort to 'reserve' the space. I had been told there would be a waitress. There was no waitress. Had to place drink order at the bar which very quickly was four people deep of general public...no fast way to order a beer for my guests. Food arrived, but not hot, and no plates, utensils or napkins were delivered. No one ever came to check and see how the food was working out. Most of the food went uneaten due to temperature and lack of utensils. A big and rude bouncer came down and told us we were taking up too much room in the couch area and blocking access to a private party. So, the 'couch area' is actually a corridor. At the end of it all, I was presented with a bill that included a 20% gratuity. I can understand a built in gratuity for table service of large parties, but everyone had to fetch their own drinks, and the bar service was a slow, pain in the neck. I don't generally object to that kind of gratuity, but in this case felt royally ripped off.The 'couch space' is not a proper space for 35 to 40 people. The restaurant could have saved me from this experience and themselves from a frustrated customer by just saying ""we don't have a room for you on that evening"". Know what you can do and what you cannot.I've been here before. I have clients in the area, so have eaten lunch here a few times. Forgettable pub food and lackluster service have always been the rule. Haven't been back for lunch in 6 months. In this general area, for an Irish pub, I prefer Tir Na Nog. For food, Statler Grill, across the street is better. I wish I'd chosen another restaurant that actually had the proper space for my event. Won't ever be back.",2,2,1

Three stories of tables, bars and televisions.We started on the main floor in one of three comfy booths. We enjoyed the extensive beer menu as well as appetizers; buttermilk fried chicken fingers; light, crispy, meaty-perfection!, soft ale pretzel with cheese and mustard-yum!, fruit and cheese plate, Stout's version of bang bang shrimp; smaller shrimp but good none the less, and spring rolls. Later we headed to the basement for a Villanova pre-game party. We arrived five minutes after it started and the place was packed. Had a beer and some snacks and moved on. Service was good. We started with one server, but half way through we started getting a new server with each order. Bizarre, but whatever works. This place gets packed.

It's a large thin-crust round pie cut into small rectangles. Many thin-crust styles are ""well-done"" so the crust becomes crispy, unlike the more traditional NY/NJ style where it's a bit soft and easy to fold... but here it is not. This leads to a few crispy pieces around the edges, and a pile of slop in the middle. But enough about a failed attempt to introduce something to NYC it'd be better without. Stout's namesake is BEER, so how does that look?They thankfully have a small selection of stouts always up on the taps regardless of the time of year, but there isn't really anything groundbreaking. This is carries on to the rest of their tap list - it's not bad, but kind of uninteresting. This sentiment carries on to the rest of the food menu, too.

You lose a Star JUST for that!I thought the food was good, but only had a steak salad...I try to keep it light when drinking...don't want to stop the flow of alcohol into the bloodstream!They have a huge eating/bar area on the main floor, with seating on a second floor balcony, which is pretty cool.

They've got a great selection of wine, beer, and liquor so you can contemplate your choice as you futilely try to shove your way through said sea of jerseys.

I did not have the chance to grab any food, but looking at the menu, plenty of choices.Great pub to rest your feet or have a drink with friends. Give them a try.",1,,
174,Jason G.,"Queens, NY",110,241,634,5.0,1/31/2016,Love this place! Wings are delicious! Drinks are good. Place is huge so wait time is pretty short. Service is on point.,,,

176,Wahed K.,"Astoria, NY",669,759,1573,4.0,7/28/2014,"As far as sports bars go, Stout has to be up there among the best in NY. I watched two world cup games here and our group had a nice corner space downstairs, sheltered from all the madness that was going on above us.The great thing about the corner space we had to ourselves was that it boasted a pretty big flat screen TV (about 65"" i think). There are two of those TVs on the wall, each in one corner and there are TVs around the small bar area as well. For me this is probably the best place to catch a game if you are watching it with a huge group. For the finals, we had a group of almost 20 and though I opted out last minute, my friends had a great time. They took reservations and honored them despite our fears. The world cup mob can get a bit crazy.I didn't get a chance to sample any of their food and the choices of beer downstairs are limited which is pretty much the only complaint I had. I can see myself coming here for more games in the future.",1,2,2

178,Kris O.,"New York, NY",238,16,2,5.0,12/29/2015,"Great tavern for beer lovers. The menu is pretty extensive and i hope to one day try everything that they offer. They change it to offer new beers so I may never try every one but I can sure try. I've never had a problem with seating at Stout. Because it's such a huge place, you get seated fairly quickly and service is fast. The staff are always really friendly and make good beer choices. They're all pretty knowledgeable on different kinds depending on your preference. My two best friends and I make it a point to have our birthdays there. Stout can support large groups so you done have to worry about whether you have 5 people or 20. On Saturdays they usually have karaoke going on which is a lot of fun. Probably better when you've had a few.In terms of the food: I've never been disappointed. Great burgers and appetizers. They also have a well priced steak i'd recommend. I've gone here on a date or two and it's a good environment for that. Not too loud where you can't hear the conversation but also not too silent where it's awkward. If you decide to go here on a night where the Rangers play, just assume it's going to be a little more crowded than usual but once the game starts it usually gets a little calmer since most people end up going to MSG to watch. Love this place and I go there whenever I can.",,1,
179,Larissa B.,"Newnan, GA",118,9,98,5.0,6/26/2014,"Five stars for an awesome looking Irish bar, getting a seat for my husband and I because I'm in a wheelchair. Apparently everyone made reservations. Cask conditioned beer which is fabulous. I ordered a seared ahi tuna salad and my husband ordered pretzel appetizer and a chicken burger. Entrees yet to come out but this place gets 5 stars for the perfect Irish Pub and a crowd of New Yorkers skipping work with their jerseys, chants, and singing. Oh! The cask condition beer too. Service is beyond great. Server put the internet password in for me.   I will add if the food is lacking.  Not getting traditional Irish food because we had it yesterday. The menu has that but also burgers and two thin crust pizzas that are supposed to be very good. One is a Reuben pizza.",2,1,2
180,Darren P.,"Lockport, NY",51,306,402,4.0,4/11/2014,"Stout was one of only a handful of restaurants that met our criteria of a pregame meal before a Rangers game. Our needs were: - Convenient to the Garden - Reasonable price - Decent reviews on Yelp - Accepts reservations  - Kid-friendlyI'm happy to say our dining experience was very enjoyable. Firstly, the decor at Stout is unique. Booths are tucked away in little nooks that create a real comfortable vibe. Perfect in a pregame rowdy atmosphere, you feel removed from the craziness. All of the accents (lighting, decorative ironworks, etc) nicely fit with the dark wood ambiance. Flat screen TVs are placed throughout but don't feel out of place. Overall, a very nice place to hangout before a game.Prior to our meal we ordered drinks. I was looking for a good imperial stout but unfortunately our waitress did not seem to have any real knowledge of beer. She claimed that ""We once had Guinness served in an imperial size""... What? I settled on a pint of Ommegang Three Philosophers. A decent ale but not what I was looking for. Later I ordered a pint of Young's Chocolate Stout. On to the food. I was pleasantly surprised. The reviews where all over the place on the food so I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered the ""Wisconsin-style Reuben Pizza"". This is a thin personal pizza comprised of pastrami, swiss cheese, french dressing and sauerkraut. Lunacy! Absolutely delicious!  My son loved his plain cheese pizza. He almost ate the entire thing.My wife and dad ordered the Shepherd's Pie. Both raved that it was the best they've had. After stealing a few bites I would have to agree. BTW, the Shepherd's Pie here is made the correct way - with lamb and not beef.Overall we loved our experience. The folks here were even so kind to hold our reservation even though our taxi was stuck in traffic (we were 15minutes late). If there is an area needing improvement it is the service. Better beer knowledge is essential in a place marketing itself as ""Stout"". The service was also a bit slow but somewhat forgivable given how packed the place was.I would highly recommend Stout as a hangout before and after a Garden event.",5,3,1
181,Jamie K.,"Bethpage, NY",160,3,0,5.0,2/23/2017,Awesome service! Sara was our waitress and suggested two really good beers that they had on tap for me and my friend.

182,Nora C. E.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,137,5,4.0,1/9/2017,"I like this bar a lot. As the name suggests, they have a great selection of heavy stout and porter beers. The food is pretty decent too. I had a veggie burger (had a weird array of veggies in it- corn and broccoli) and it was falling apart but tasted okay. Very good pub fries and of course solid beer to wash it all down. I was there during the holiday season and they were playing hockey and Bruce Springsteen x-mas tunes, all of which I really enjoyed during a solo dinner. Also a big plus that despite being a cell phone black hole, they do have wifi.",,,
183,Lou S.,"Sparta Township, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,6/20/2016,Ate here before Friday's Billy Joel concert at MSG.  It was the perfect pre-concert place to go.  They had Billy Joel playing downstairs and the service was friendly and fast to ensure we got out on time.  The Crab and Shrimp burger was awesome (3 of us ordered it) and the appetizers hit the spot.  Tons of beer choices too.  Everyone found something they liked.  We'll be back!,,,
184,Evangeline K.,"Manhattan, NY",465,105,128,4.0,3/30/2014,"Perfect spot for lunch or after work drinks. This place is huge! I did not even realize they had a downstairs!They have a great selection of beers, but the minus one star is for running out of usually the first beer I ask for. Love the chicken strips!! I always order them with wing sauce on the side plus their avocado ranch sauce. YUM ! I have also had some really good salads that were specials of the day.Great place to go for some casual food and fun with friends.",3,3,3
185,Rich V.,"Garfield, NJ",100,92,487,3.0,10/28/2015,"Enormous space with 3 floors and a great vibe. Came before the Rangers game and walked into a packed venue. Ordered a few beers at the bar and asked for a table. They had a open table downstairs and ordered the veggie burger and chicken fingers. Food was average, not spectacular but not horrible. The prices of food were responsible except the beer prices are pretty high ($6 Miller lite). Not a bad place to stop in before a game but not a place to seek after to try.",1,,
186,Kaysee T.,"Manhattan, NY",10,295,2,4.0,2/16/2016,"Above average Irish/sports bar in the midtown area, with a really respectable beer selection! As you can imagine from the name, they definitely specialize in stouts, and usually have a good selection on draft as well as in bottles. As a craft beer nerd, I have to say that they don't really carry anything THAT exotic...you see a lot of the names you usually do in the craft stout scene (Founders Oatmeal, Left Hand Milk Stout, etc.), but I still respect the selection. They also have a good selection of non-stout beers, both on draft and bottle.One thing that I thought was odd, although not worth subtracting any stars, was that for a bar called Stout, all of their winter seasonals were IPAs. Weird! I would expect at least one good, seasonal stout. But, no matter.Bar area is spacious, clean, and really inviting. The bartenders are pretty friendly, although not overly chatty, and there's a big restaurant area if you're looking to sit at a table. On a Saturday afternoon (around 2 probably), it was surprisingly un-crowded, and they had a variety of different games showing on the multiple TVs behind the bar (and even one with the news on!). Overall, I'd certainly come back here again if I was in the area!",,,

Updated review",Went again last week for dinner before the Billy Joel concert. The place was a madhouse - every seat was filled - caused delays in getting food and drinks. Staff was very good but this time I was not so impressed by the food - we both had steak sandwiches on a grinder roll - mediocre at best.,,,
188,Sara S.,"Cold Spring Harbor, NY",0,53,4,3.0,7/30/2017,"I've been here a couple of times, just for drinks each time. They have a seemingly large list/selection, but every time we go we just choose two beers we'd like because they're always out of multiple things it seems. Maybe they should edit their drinks list because it's never accurate. Also, hate to say it, the bar has repeatedly been sticky and dirty. My phone stuck to it!",,,
189,Philip B.,"MIDDLE VLG, NY",106,118,117,2.0,5/12/2014,"I have been here a few times.  Their selection of beer is the largest I have seen in most bars.   The burgers are pretty good and the sheppard's pie and chicken pot pie are awesome.This last time I went though, I was quite disappointed.  I ordered a bottle and was given the bottle and a wam pint glass.  I could understand if it were room temperature, but this seemed like it just came out of the dishwasher.  Albiet, the glass was clean, but who wants to drink a beer out of a warm pint glass.I ordered the NY Strip steak sandwich which was seasoned perfectly and peppery and cooked rare just like I like my steak.  There was only one thin (about 1/4 inch piece of meat on the bread, and it was so chewy and the bread so hard (like a ciabatta roll), that it was quite difficult to eat this SANDWICH wihout using a knife and fork.  I will say that the quality of the ingrediants was quite good and fresh.The place was crowded due to a Rangers game, but the food did come out quick.I'm not saying this place is good or bad, but honestly, I don't know if I'd leave my part of town and come up there just to eat, but if I were in the area, sure, I'd stop by.As another note to management, please put bacon (by default) back onto the chicken sandwich.  Bacon makes everything better and I'm not sure why it was removed from the menu and why I would need to pay extra to have it added back on.",2,,
190,Em W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/12/2018,"Food Poisoning - Steer Clear. Rushed to the ER for Scombroid poisoning (caused by rotten seafood) at Stout. My first time at this restaurant, I ordered a tuna burger (something I have ordered quite a bit at other places) and after about 5 minutes after taking my first bite, my face flushed to a deep purple color and I started shaking with severe chills and nausea. I didn't realize what was going on, but after it continued ended up having to go to ER where I had stay for over 24 hours, while I was treated for severe symptoms. The doctor diagnosed me with Scombroid poisoning which is linked to fish that has gone RANCID due to improper handling/refrigeration....pretty disgusting. After this whole incident, I spoke with the owners and they merely offered me a gift certificate for my trouble (not exactly something I wanted after that horrible experience), and I never was able to get confirmation that they had actually removed it from their menu that day.",,,
191,Lexi A.,"Newark, NJ",36,10,2,2.0,7/24/2015,"I just wanted a sandwich.I went into the 41st street location for lunch and asked for a steak sandwich. The waitress told me they didn't have those (or chicken potpies or pizzas). I then ordered an angry burger and a glass of water. I, actually, had to order the water twice because the waitress wasn't listening the first time.Also, she initially acted like she didn't want to take my order right away (I get it, people are usually indecisive).I'm all for prompt service, but I received my order in less than 5 minutes which I thought was suspiciously fast and/or I received someone else's order. In all likelihood, they probably just pre-cooked the food. It was warm and tasty, so I can't complain about that.The waitress/female server just seemed a little short with me. She asked me if I wanted change from a $20 bill on a $14 lunch order and seemed annoyed that I didn't want to leave her a nearly $6 tip. I may consider going back since the place is nice and large (PLUS it's close by the office) for after-work drinks. I'll just be aware to avoid the short, blonde waitress.",2,,

198,Ryan S.,"Stuart, FL",4,34,7,2.0,10/1/2015,"It really pains me to give this place a poor review, because Irish bars with Guinness on tap deserve a free pass, but it would be neglectful of me to send my fellow Yelpers here when there are so many other places to get Guinness in this city.The good: Guinness. And the service, our waitress was pretty good, except for remembering to bring water to one of us at the table, but I'm of the opinion that water shouldn't be served at a bar anyway. The bad: While the food was reasonably priced for Manhattan, the drinks were the normal too expensive. $8 for a beer? Are you kidding me? Also, the NOISE was insane. Even shouting, I could not hear my sister and her friend when they were talking. I did not feel like shouting to be heard, so I stayed quiet most of the night. I don't know if there is anything they can do about it, but the noise in this place is ridiculously loud. Also, all the TV screens were on one side of the place, so half the table did not get to see the game. The ugly: I ordered the Angry Burger... medium. It came out  burnt to oblivion. And the burger had turned into a ball on this giant bun, so I was eating a lot more bread than I wanted. This burger lived up to its name and made me angry... it was dry, it was overcooked, it was ugly. The fries were decent, but good fries won't get you a high rating with me. I asked my sister how her meal was, but I couldn't hear her repsonse. Her friend was not impressed with his flatbread pizza. I'll not be back if I can help it. NYC has way better food than this.",,1,
199,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,2.0,5/22/2015,"I've walked by Stout countless times on the way to events at MSG but never went in.  Typically I'd go across the street to Statler Grill, or just try to grab a quick bite before heading in.  The place is actually a lot nicer than I expected, especially for a sports bar.  They had a huge amount of TVs around the bar and the rest of the restaurant, the bar itself is huge with a lot of seating, and there's even a decent downstairs area.  If you're looking for space, you'll find it here.  I came with my brother and his friends for his birthday and we had a large booth in the back which was perfect to watch the Kentucky-Notre Dame game.  The beer list here is also far above and beyond what you'd expect from an Irish bar in Midtown.  The tap list is small and run of the mill except for a few extra stouts they throw in, but the bottle list is very good.  In addition to highlighting stouts here again, they have a US-heavy but varied list of different beers that does a good job of balancing between high quality and more accessible stuff.  I took advantage of the former and had 4 different stouts.  Between all these things (especially the beer) we had a very good times.Why the low rating?  The food pulls this down.  Being that they have an entire section of the menu dedicated to burgers, I got a Stout Burger with applewood smoked bacon, Maytag Bleu, and sauteed onions.  My burger was overcooked significantly: no where near the medium rare I requested.  Toppings were sparse except for the bacon; problem there was the the bacon literally wasn't cooked.  It's scary that this was allowed out of the kitchen.  Fries were okay.  My brother's burger had the nastiest looking avocado I've ever seen.  The 2 guys that got the chicken burgers were also disappointed.  All around nobody was happy with their food which is terrible given that we were 9 people.  Even worse was because of the occasion, nobody wanted to be the one to send theirs back and we ended up just letting all of this slide.I guess stick to the drinks here.  Definitely a good place to watch games over beers but I'll be sticking to Statler across the street for food, pricey as it is.",2,1,3
