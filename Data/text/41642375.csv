Updated review",63,,"Louisville, KY",Giovanni H.,55,5.0,29,"Went here thanks to a friend that took us (he literally  lives around the corner from this place).. First impressions were bleh, I did forget that I was in New York and that an outside appearance of a place doesn't necessarily result in the food/atmosphere being alike! LOL It looked like your average smallish bar. Which after a long day of exploring New York, by train and foot, looked like a sanctuary to me and the group I was with. Everyone was courteous and prompt to refill our glasses with some fine Manhattan Tap water. It was delicious and cold, don't know what the fuss about New York water is?!We went ahead and ordered food. Their turnkey burger is out of this world. I have never had a turkey burger that was good or even decent, however, theirs was just perfect. My significant other had the salmon on quinoa, you gotta remember, this is still a bar, not really a Resturant. The salmon was to die for.  And the rest of the gang had turkey burgers and some vegan dish that I don't care much about. Everyone was pretty impressed by the food and the great service. I definitely recommend This place not only because of the pleasant experience, it's also right off the train station and some weird cookie place with some bad ass cookies. But that's material for another review. Cheers and thanks for making my NYC experience a pleasant one!",

When we got here, I found the place to be quite small. Yet, we were able to fit in here adequately.There was one waiter and one bartender on duty at the time. The waiter got us menus and drinks in short order. Most of my classmates ordered random bar snacks, but I went with an entree. I ordered the grilled salmon, which came with quinoa and a blend of sauces.The food was amazing here! The drinks weren't bad, either. And although the bar was small, the environment was pretty good. We had a fun time here, which is great because the med school life is rather stressful.Thanks for the great service, people!",11
2,,7/19/2018,1,,"New York, NY",Andrea C.,0,1.0,68,"Yikes. There's absolutely NOTHING good to report about this place. 1) Waiter: a bland, yet pretentious, ""hipster"" type (you know, 70s-style moustache and arm tattoo firmly in place). Not only did he talk so low you couldn't hear him; but he forgot our beer glass (and there must've been just about 5 people in the place) and acted as if he wanted to be anywhere in the world but there.2) The Food: nothing had flavor. I didn't even finish my cheeseburger it was so bland and tasteless (oh, and I asked for rare and got something closer to well done). I knew it was going to suck by how they chopped the lettuce - into little tiny bits, probably to hide the fact that it was old.3) Price: And to boot, it's expensive for absolutely crap food! My friend and I paid almost $20 for each of our burgers. Unacceptable for this type of food. Honestly, I've had fresher, tastier food at a Wendy's.I've lived in this neighborhood for a while and always pull for new restaurants to be good. Some are; some aren't but at least they try. This place is just a hot mess running cool. Honestly, I can't believe anyone in their right mind would return to eat here. It absolutely sucks.",2

I would definitely return to this place to try the pancakes or French toast, looked delicious.The negative was the service, when I sat down I was not given a menu for at least 10 min, once they realized they were not being attentive, the waiter started coming to my table every 2 min disturbing me. When I indicated I wanted to check out, the waiter decided to ignore the fact that I wanted to leave and have a side bar conversation with his co workers . The service definitely needs improvement.",4

The sandwich was seasoned WELL. Baguette great. Fries, good amount. I'll definitely buy it again. Excellent customer service. Some regular patrons know the staff by name. A establishment doesn't get there if they're not good. I walked about a mile home and my food was still warm. Way to go Harlem Food Bar.",

7,,10/23/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Shia J.,0,5.0,4,"This is absolutely the best burger place in Harlem.  I live on 115th and I am here at least once a week.   I'm from the south so beef is my thing however their burgers blow me away. Oh... don't forget the fries. They are amazeballzzz!!!  The staff is super friendly and after dining here for 4 years, I've never had an unpleasant experience ever!   My favorite is a rare burger with just provolone cheese sautéed mushrooms and onions.   It's it's too die or and I never can finish it in on seating.   If you are in Harlem, HFB is def a place to stop by.",

9,,7/31/2017,156,1,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",Kendal F.,446,2.0,81,"This is a small restaurant that usually has more excitement during the summer when they open the outside seating. The bartenders are pretty cool and I think that's why most people go here. The drinks (specials). The food is not very memorable (to me at least) and I've tried it a couple times over the years. My most recent visit I just had the BBQ chicken wings, which were just OK. If you want a kind of cool atmosphere during the summer where you can get 2 for 2 drink specials. This is your place. I think the best thing about this place is Trump's face in the toilet.",1

12,,8/29/2018,0,,"New York, NY",Daniel C.,0,2.0,8,"I'm so disappointed after taking three friends last night.  Been coming here for years and it must be falling on hard times recently.First, I often get the meatloaf and substitute fries for the potato purée.  I love the fries...For years, I have done this.  So my friend ordered it...Last night, they refused stating they don't allow substitutions.  He ordered it anyway.  The meatloaf was okay...potatoes were bland and the ""garlic"" green beans we hardly cooked.I told my friend that it was no big deal and I would share as they always load on the fries.  I got my burger - arrived medium well after I requested medium rare.  And with 15 fries.  My other friend got a turkey burger - all dried out and with less fries than me.  He called it a hockey puck.  My other friend ordered the Asian salad with chicken.  The chicken had no flavor and looked boiled.This was more than a bad night.  This was indicative of a restaurant going downhill with no attention to detail or quality control.",1

I highly recommend the turkey burger, salmon BLT and cauliflower poppers. Their frozen margaritas are delicious. I would try to make it for happy hour to get the best margarita deal! They have outdoor seating which is nice in the summer. Or server, David, was attentive and funny. I plan on going back soon!",
15,,3/7/2018,279,,"Baltimore, MD",Desirée I.,3,5.0,13,"I walked to this restaurant from the hostel I was staying which only took 12 minutes (a major plus). I could've taken the M7 but wanted to explore. I linked up with a friend who lives in the area and suggested the place. At first sight this spot was lively and cute. The waiters were exceptionally nice, especially our waiter, Ephraim. My friend's 2 year old son was with us and Ephraim was super attentive, giving him some sheets of paper and crayons. The bartender even came over and engaged us in conversation. I ordered the passion fruit margarita and Lousiana Po'Boy both which were hitting my taste buds in all the right places. The fries were also hot, fresh and crispy just how I like them.Ephraim made my first solo experience in New York a great one. I'll definitely be back, hopefully for happy hour!",2

21,,5/13/2018,1,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Raul N.,0,3.0,4,"Decent place, but the food is too expensive for just basic entrées. You're getting basically diner food but with five star prices. Stop by for a nice drink or two, otherwise go elsewhere to get more bang for your culinary buck.",3

25,,5/25/2018,312,,"Manhattan, NY",Rodelix R.,0,1.0,5,"I have been to this place 3 times and always walk out with an issue, but i give it the benefit of the doubt every time because I like to support my neighborhood bars (especially the LGBT friendly ones). Today We walked in and greeted a server (white guy with a blue plaid shirt) he greeted back but didn't seat us so we took the open ourselves to sit in a nearby two top table by the door. We were sitting for about 20 minutes before the other server (spanish guy with glasses) told us he'd bring us menu's. By that point we were turned completely off but decided to give them a shot and order a drink. We ordered 2 mango margaritas which lasted another 20 minutes to get to the table. Overall probably the worst service I've ever received. We were literally ignored for the time we were there.  Some places you just can't give the benefit of the doubt.",1
26,,8/1/2016,138,,"Flushing, NY",Guitelle S.,346,2.0,138,"Hm, this wasn't somewhere I wanted to visit but my friends & I were out in the city and we wanted to get something to eat so we decided to check out this place. Probably wasn't the best idea to come here because this food lacked flavor and I also think they were just too overpriced for the quality of food they offered. I ordered the macaroni sticks for my appetizer and I was not a fan. For my entrée I ordered the half pound burger and I did not enjoy it at all. It came it out kind of cold and it tasted blah. I was only able to get through a half and that's because I was so hungry.The restaurant is pretty small place but it had a cool interior and the vibe was nice. It was packed in there but it was still comfortable. I don't understand why there was so much people there though because the food wasn't good but maybe the drinks were.As for service, our waiter Josh was busy throughout our time there but he was pretty cool when we did get a chance to interact with him.",2

For some reason, today, the owner of the restaurant was outside Monitoring who could and could not be seated at the restaurant. A group of black men arrived before my friends and I and they were told there was no seating available, when there clearly was, so they left. My friends and I were told the same thing and it was a blatant lie. We took pictures, because we were so in awe.",1

The food looked and smelled amazing. I'm not sure if it's my race or gender or even both combined. I wanted to treat my fiancé for a pre birthday lunch but the server was rude multiple times. Felt unwanted there. So sad.",2

Fresh, hearty, cooked just right (thanks Ernie!). The staff lead by Scott greeted us like part of a community from the first time we dined there. Brunch is especially good. The upscale pub menu has something for many appetites. Fantastic sidewalk seating when the weather allows.",
30,,7/27/2018,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Adam H.,0,1.0,4,This place used to be the hot spot in harlem for drinks (not so for food) but now it seems like they just want a certain type of clientele and not everybody is welcome there. I was just there last week again and I witnessed the owner/manager arguing and yelling at the waiter for some reasons. I heard the owner isn't  pleasant and I can confirm that he is not.  I'm definitely not going back there and wouldn't  recommend this place to anyone.,1
31,1,2/16/2017,37,1,"Atlanta, GA",Lindsey H.,237,5.0,141,Our group of four were the only people there on a Thursday morning but it was delicious. The cook customized a member of the groups burger. Two margaritas before noon was the perfect idea! I ordered the chili as well and it was full of flavor and totally worth it. Their fries are scrumptious along with the white sauce it came with!!!! The breakfast sandwich was a good size.,1

It was quiet and we stayed till close at 1130. Clientele was respectful and the music was very chill. Had a great lengthy conversation with Ken. The place has a coat rack in the back so you can settle into your seat uncramped. The place is relatively small and sitting by the window on a cold night will give you a bit of a draft.  To be fair, it was extremely cold outside. I would definitely return to try the food and enjoy the ambience and company of a cool bartender who knows how to carry an entertaining conversation.",3

Updated review",0,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Maurice A.,19,2.0,26,"So I've gone to HFB for about 4 years now. I've never really been the biggest fan of their food, however, the drinks have always been decent and the vibe was always young and cool. Every year the main attraction for me was always June 21st which is this anniversary/ music matters Part that they host. Dj stormin norman is the Dj which is amazing. I've noticed the last few years attending the event that it has become very elitists. The owners generally reserve areas for their friends (which is to be expected) and everyone else can sit where they choose (outside). They always have happy hour and just very friendly and attentive staff. This year however, the staff was very rude, not friendly and when my friends in I ( a group of 10) came to have drinks and eat we were told that this year not only were they not offering happy hour specials but they were only allowing certain people outside (aka the people the owners knew- those words came from our server) on the first day of summer they pushed most of the people inside.my friends who also attend every year were just as annoyed and over the situation as I was. To me it has become less customer driven and more cliquish which is kinda weird for a business that prides itself on being ""community based"" I will say if you eat anything the calamari, pita bread and the fried cauliflower were all awesome choices.... UPDATE: I was sent a response from the owners about the outside being reserved.. again, this could be a new thing as I have videos from each year that friends and I have attended and we were all seated outside!! This ""special guest"" rule should be made known prior to people attending the event as there is no way we would prefer to sit indoors on the 1st day of summer. Let me know if you need those videos as a reminder!",

So much so, that we decided to return two days later for my birthday dinner last night! The bartender, Julio, the Chef and the owner are beyond hospitable. The atmosphere and the crowd who frequents this spot are both very cool and a great addition to the growing ""restaurant row"" of Frederick Douglas Blvd. For my birthday meal, I had the meatloaf and my boyfriend had the short ribs and both were exceptionally good, stick-to-your-ribs type fare with little creative flairs. The meatloaf reminded me of my late Italian mother's meatballs because they even included veal! The only thing they could improve on is getting some bitters and ginger beer behind that bar! ;)",

Updated review",172,,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",James S.,0,1.0,9,Had the worst service here tonight.  I've come here multiple times and have always had a great time.  Tonight it seemed like the bartender was more focused on his friends at the bar as well as closing down.  It took myself and my friend an extended amount of time to get drinks. We watched everyone else at the bar get helped before us.  We only got a second round of drinks because we were persistent in getting the bartenders attention. He never came to our side of of the bar unless we asked for him. I like Harlem a Food Bar but I am not sure I'll be back based on the experience I had tonight.,1

I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the burger. There was nothing special about the sandwich and especially the burger. I will say though, that the sides were incredible. My sandwich came with an arugula salad that had a very brine-y dressing that complimented it perfectly. Like everyone else has said, they have some of the best fries. They apparently bread them and then fry them, which I think is genius. I dont know why every other establishment doesn't do this. Would i come back? no, but it was alright for a mid week lunch.",

49,1,6/7/2016,162,,"Manhattan, NY",Tayla L.,435,4.0,107,"Seemingly new place in Harlem! Stumbled upon it on Yelp and had a great, simple brunch here. The menu is very clear and straightforward: American brunch. They offer $15 half carafes of typical brunch drinks (mimosas, bellini's, Bloody Mary, and one other). The restaurant has a cool decor and a modern vibe. I enjoyed the half indoor/half outdoor seating. Wonder how that will work in the winter - the place is very tight without the outdoor space. Anyway, I enjoyed my French toast with bacon and the bf had a burger which he enjoyed. Service was decent and kept an eye on us in case we needed anything. On the pricier side, ($50 for two with tip) and I can't easily justify it being worth it but for not waiting and receiving good food quickly and enjoying a nice, sunny day in Harlem, I'll take it.",
50,,11/6/2017,401,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Lee'Arthur L.,0,5.0,1,I attend this bar with my friends often. For happy hour. I have been on busy days and slower days and I always have Moe as my server and he is simply amazing. He has knowledge on all the drinks and food. He has great recommendations every time I go. The wings are to die for and the burgher. I recently went after happy hour when I got off from work on a stressful day and the setting and Moe turned my day around. I will suggest this place to everyone that is looking for great food and drinks.,
51,,11/2/2017,258,,"Atlanta, GA",Janay C.,2,1.0,3,I really wanted to like this little spot butttttt...the menu is sub par......I ordered the turkey burger and was told I came already with jalapeños and mushrooms and scallions and all this other stuff I didn't want. He said I could only take off the lettuce and tomato which I asked for them to do so. However after waiting 30 minutes for a burger and chili it still came with lettuce and tomato. I also had to pay $1.75 for cheese and another 2.00 for bacon. Ridiculous.  Lastly the chilly was topped with cold $2.00 cheese. Over it. Just another pretentious restaurant trying to pass as a high end restaurant. Ruining what use to be the great culture of Harlem!,
52,,10/31/2015,1158,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Renee R.,628,5.0,123,"The person who told us to go here said, ""Let's go to THE gay restuarant in Harlem,"" and as I was there I learned what that meant: GREAT SERVICE + RELATIONSHP BUILDING + FOOD. In the third grade, I remember everyone used to say as a joke (a very stupid joke), ""I'm gay... That means happy, stupid."" If gay means happy, that's what I was when I was here at Harlem Food Bar... HAPPY. I guess that is what it means to go to a gay restaurant... it means we're going to a place that brings you happiness and Harlem Food Bar is just that. I had the vegan burger with a salad. The patty is HOMEmade with quinoa, black beans, other veggies and lots of love and goodness. Sweet potato fries they serve here are ON POINT! And the chipotle dipping sauce? Hella good!When you feel like you're at home, but you're at a restaurant and the owner sits down to just talk and chat with you... just because and offers you a free dog crate when you tell him you're adopting a pet the next morning, then it must be a happy place. This is exactly why I love this place, it has a home feel to it. It is a place that feels like the neighborhood chill spot that everyone goes to and the food is great. Also, GREAT SERVICE. Our server was very mindful of us and answered all the questions we had regarding the menu. I was so distracted by the interesting people and the vibe and that's enough for me to give this place a 5. My gay friend I went with said, ""Let's go to THE gay restuarant in Harlem,"" and I had no idea what that really meant. Now, it just means great people are there, good food and an awesome, giving owner. A Harlemite turned Brooklynite, Renee Rises",4

I was there for a late working lunch this past week. The lunch selections were great! I asked the bartender/server for suggestions! I ended up with the #salmonblt with #wasabimayo!!! The salmon was cooked perfectly, vegetables were fresh and crisp, and the wasabi mayo on the side was just enough to give the sandwich a little spice! I paired it with a nice cold #Sancerre... I will definitely be back! They have great food and beverage selections and the service is top notch!!!",1

There were two other tables who had already received their food but it still took :25 minutes for our entrees to come out the kitchen, just a burger and pancakes.Funny but not so funny, when the cook finally rang the bell our waitress (the only one working) was about to go into deep convo with another customer about politics. I had to tap her and let her know that the cooling, soon to be cold food is about 15 minutes overdue and you can solve world hunger after you deliver my meal.The guy behind the bar although there was no one drinking put in an order and got served before we did...takes his plate and has a leisurely brunch at a table. Hmmm I would think you would want to get your guests' orders preference in the kitchen so maybe they will come back. The straw that broke the camel's back; the fruit had a weird taste as if there were stored next to a food with an overpowering aroma.",

There were about 4 other parties there at the time and the crowds seemed to start coming in after noon. Restaurant: very small and cozy with bar area. Outdoor seating is better for big parties. Fun interior. Food: I felt like it was nothing special. Nice presentation but taste and texture just wasn't there.-Soup of the day: Chilli with corn bread slice. I wish the chili had some more spice or was served with some raw onion. - eggs benedict with bacon: a little bit disappointed because I was expecting crispy bacon strips but got a slice of what looks like ham. Maybe there are other forms of bacon? English muffin was not very fluffy either. - red velvet waffles: nicely topped with strawberries and whipped cream but wish the waffle was actually crispy. Overall, can't really complain too much because of the price of the food. I'm sure other dishes here might be good but I would not come back for brunch.",2

I don't know how this place doesn't sit closer to a 2.5 star average? We got seated outside and the atmosphere is fairly fun but not enough to make up for the, wait for our food, service, or taste.  First off, it took over an hour to get our meal. We ordered the pork taco appetizer, which was actually good, that came out super quick (10 minutes maybe?). Then after another 45-50 minutes our meals came out. During this time our waiter was drunk and kept messing up his sentences and kept saying he'd bring us water but never did. He was lighthearted but he just came off as kind of sloppy, which doesn't help with the whole waiting-an-hour-for-food thing.  For my meal I had got the Salmon BLT. The only redeeming factor was it had bacon. The bread was dry, the salmon was flavorless and excessively greasy. Overall just bad but I was starving. My girlfriend got a grilled chicken sandwich that was pretty bland/mediocre. If you're in NYC, there is better food nearby. Do not waste your time here.",7

Cons: I dont think this is a good place for large groups. Seating is tight and tables are a bit small. But I was comfortable enough with just me and my friend. Also drinks here are on the pricier side and also small. Bought 2 pitchers of Bellinis for $15.00 and one was just enough to just refill someone's drink twice.

67,,3/25/2015,128,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jon S.,1,2.0,647,"I used to live in this part of Harlem. Occasionally I return, and usually make the same banal observation - boy, this place has changed a lot. For me, that's fine. It's part of the evolution of a neighborhood. There's no way that a place with nice old buildings, great subway access and a short walk to the park is going to remain off the radar of gentrifers forever.Places change, and they bring with them new types of restaurants. Harlem Food Bar is trying to bridge that gap, to create a new kind of restaurant where both old-timers and new-arrivals can gather and eat. It fails spectacularly. First off - what is this space? Too fancy to be a diner yet too bright to have any sort of atmosphere. What I found on a recent Sunday night is lots and lots of noise, even though the place wasn't more than two-thirds full. Get ready for Chelsea beer prices with a selection that belongs in New Jersey. Cocktail prices are way too far north of $10, higher rents or no.And the food is thoroughly mediocre. It's comfort food minus any personal touches that come with home cooked food or the upscale technique a modern restaurant might deliver. The end result is a 'neighborhood restaurant' that causes you to question living in this area at all.",4

I had a veggie burger and my fiancé had the HFB burger (beef). My veggie burger was dry and I didn't love the flavor, and my fiance's burger was fine but not great (according to him). Reading the rave reviews on Yelp about the fries I upgraded my order for $2, and they were also just okay.I had a beer, my fiancé had a soda. Our bill came to over $65, pre-tip. For two hamburgers, one salad, one beer and one soda. I know this is NYC, but for that kind of bill--and for a fairly simple dinner--you want it to be a bit better than ""okay.""

I tried to keep it simple and got a bacon cheeseburger with fries...it didnt end up being the way to go. My burger was mediocre and had an ollllllllld tomato on top of it along with some beat lettuce and over-cooked bacon. I love a juicy burger just as much as the next burger aficionado but not if it will result in my bottom bun being soggy. My battered fries (a major dislike of mine) were hard and remained on the plate with the half of my burger I didnt eat. I chided my company for making the decision to hit this spot up and we sat around cracking jokes.Another sore spot of my HFB experience was the super loud group of teachers who were dining/drinking. The place is not that big and a group of 4/5 people made enough noise to shame any group of students. Our waiter shared that hey were regulars and when there were more of them it got even more boisterous. As a teacher myself, I took a few hits from my dining partner but was quick to say that my coworkers and I were definitely not like that when we went out for drinks. I used to work in that very area and its good to see that its changing for the better and there are lots of new businesses popping up.

Yes the food here (for sure the burgers) are beyond spectacular.

The happy hour is also a good find in the neighborhood, but I give the food overall 3 stars and service a 4 (5 stars for my waiter). That gives us a 3.5 overall.Stopped in twice and had a turkey burger both times because the sexy waiter went on and on (and on) about how delicious it was! The first time I ate it, I totally have to agree. It was succulent, and cooked to perfection; stuffed with chives and other flavorful goodies and smothered in cheese and caramelized onions! Thank you, ginger biscuit, for making that recommendation! My girlfriend and I sipped on 2-for-1 margaritas and were so far from sober by the time 6:30 rolled around. They were great, and, like supa cheap, so we had 5...or 6 EACH. #dontjudgetheresearchassistants #TGIFThe happy hour was pretty amazing...did I mention TWO-FOR-ONE?! Yeah, this was really nice as we sat outside in the summer sun. My second visit here was less special and my turkey burger was actually quite dry and I couldn't manage to stuff it down, whereas the first one was inhaled in 10 seconds flat. Fries not bad, but not excellent. I might return for a meal to see if they're generally on their game or if the first turkey burger I had was a fortuitous fluke.

It took her a long time to refill our water and not once throughout the entire meal did she ask if I wanted to refill my drink. (Mind you, I finished my juice before the meal came)3. When the food finally came it was wrong... I ordered my meal with a salad (which was on my friend's plate) and he ordered fries which didn't come. Also whatever sandwich my friend ordered was suppose to come with bacon (which was missing as well). He pointed it out and 5 mins later the waitress came with 2 pieces of bacon which looked like it was microwaved4. My 3rd friend who ordered an spinach and cheese omelette...the omelette was horrible.... There was waaaaay more spinach than egg... It was like they put 2 inches of not sautéed spinach in the omelette. The side salad he ordered did not have salad dressing on it so he had to ask for some. Also when my friend asked to order more bread he was told ""the kitchen is busy and I'm not trying to overwhelm him but I'll see how long it will take."" She later told him it would be 10 minutes for toast... He declined. After all, we don't want to ""overwhelm him"" smh5. I asked for my steak to be medium well.... The steak came medium rare... The tips pieces which were cooked where flavorless so I took the rare pieces home to re-cook and to re-seasonThe only positive thing I can say about my brunch experience was when the fries finally came they were really good. Maybe dinner here is better but I'll pass on coming back to find out",

I get the burger/fries each time I'm there and it's good. The meat is tender and juicy and the fries crispy. Portions are large and the service is very kind and attentive. The design is new and modern and they have seats outside which always is a plus during sunny days.,3

I ordered rum cake and it took over 20 mins and it wasnt freshly cooked. It tasted okay. Could have used either a homemade whip cream or a la mode to give it that extra punch.When the owner was told he defended his food saying the burgers only looked pink because the ground turkey was so fresh.

No checking on us, no apologies, slowest service and the food is not consistent. The owner seem to have opened the place so he will have somewhere to hang out bc he is THE ONLY happy customer sitting drinking outside and don't even care! No on came to even check if we were OK after canceling the brunch leaving hungry. The other dish of Lemon Pancake"" were 3 pathetic burnt pancake that looks more line something my niece would make.

Last night my boyfriend experienced the same thing, but at a more blatant and obvious degree because he left a gratuity in cash, but was charged and extra five dollars on his card.  This shady behavior is a red flag and it seems to me that this is an ongoing scam taking a couple dollars here and there from patrons preying on their vulnerability and banking on their ignorance. This is unacceptable. It's bad business and totally contradicts the neighborly atmosphere that has been built up in South Harlem over the last few years.  Don't waste your time or money at Harlem Food Bar.  There are many more restaurants on restaurant row with far superior food and honest service.",2

The menu looked good, but we were a tad let down to know they discontinued the Mac & Cheese Squares (grr...), but we ordered the burger with avocado and the chicken sandwich. The chicken was fresh but the foccacia bread was a bit stale. My friend who ordered the burger asked for bleu cheese dressing (personal preference for the fries), the kind waitress says ok. The food comes out, no bleu cheese or avocado. She comes back explains that the bleu cheese dressing would be an extra $2.00 while holding a little cup of it. ""So it's included if you order buffalo wings but $2.00 if you don't?"" We decline, meanwhile the tiny cup of it, is now wasted.We are in conversation when we realize, there's no avocado. we get her attention, sweet girl, she says ""I know I wrote it on the ticket! Let me check on that for you!""3 minutes later... ""They're working on it for you!""5 minutes later... ""They had to go downstairs to get it""5 MORE minutes later it comes out. We get the bill, I was a little annoyed that we were charged for it.

Or is there a negative-star rating at all? I gave 1-star bec well....we've been here several times in the past and my experience was ok, so with my daughter's. Food was ok, nothing spectacular but service was good enough and we like the proximity. My husband's though wasn't as good because every time he ordered a burger, it always came out wrong, as in well-done for a medium/well order. He's a patient man, though.This night, same thing happened. It was well done again and so he decided to have it returned. What happened next tested his nicety and patience, and he failed ;-) but rightfully, if I may say so!The waiter, who told us he was new, was certainly not apologetic and the cook can even be seen in the kitchen counter window, as being pissed. If she's pissed at herself I can understand and will even applaud her.  I digressed. So the burger came out again and outside was well done, when my husband cut it up to look inside? Lo and behold! the inside looked downright raw. That's gross and inexcusable! How can you serve raw hamburger beef? We showed it to the waiter who was not even aghast and just look at us nonchalantly, not even sheepishly, considering this is the SECOND time they goofed, a case of double fumble! So when the waiter took the plate back to the kitchen the second time around, we saw him talked to the owner who then went in the kitchen presumably to chastise the cook (and probably checking up to see if she might need some vision+culinary help, seeing her distorted sense of meat cooking doneness). Owner later approached us saying he is sorry and has taken that item off our bill.  Then, here comes the plate again....and this time even for me, it's the last straw. The burger looked so well done to the point that I, seated across from my husband, can smell the whiff of burnt meat!  I think this is an affront and needless to say, we asked for the bill and cannot wait to leave the place. We felt so disrespected as diners and this whole incident just soured whatever support and good thought I have for HFB. We lived nearby and want to support the neighborhood businesses & establishments and had even considered HFB as our go-to place for a quick good eatout.

Speaking of Happy Hour, the specials offered at HFB are amazing! Drinks are buy one get one free and food specials are offered. On this night, the chef prepared a homemade chicken noodle soup with grilled toast. This soup was unlike any other soup I've had; so simple but so delicious. My friends and I spoke to the chef about the soup and he told us the secret of his soup...he finished it with lemon juice. Genius!

Which was great!However they said happy hour ends at 7pm-we said fine. We ordered the mac and cheese not tasty at all how can you mess up mac and cheese?The guacamole and chips tasted like the guacamole was store bought. We enjoyed hanging out with our friends so we didn't really care too much about the food. Once we got the check everything was full priced both food and drinks. We asked our waitress to update the check with the happy hour deal. She came back and only half of it was taken off. Didn't want to argue since we will never come back if that's the service you get.

The ambience is okay and it has a local feel to it; it can be very lively. The service isn't bad.On the other hand, it's really too expensive for what you get. And they don't serve lunch. They'll inevitably be compared to Harlem Tavern and Bier International and aren't as good as either of those, but cost more.I'll go back and try again if they start serving a discounted burger at lunch, but there's nothing better about this place than the somewhat mediocre Harlem Tavern.",

They were very accommodating and without hesitation moved tables out the way so we could make room for the wheelchair. I ordered the HFB burger medium well with a Mango Bellini and it was delicious. The burger was juicy but still cooked, fresh lettuce, tomato slice and you have a choice of cheddar or Swiss cheese. The fries were crunchy and already seasoned so there is not need for salt or pepper. The Mango Bellini was very refreshing and cool.My mom ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict and the Twisted Screw. When the server brought her food out, my mouth watered a bit and I wished I had ordered the same. The pouched eggs were delicious, well cooked on fresh Canadian bacon with a lightly toasted English muffin at the bottom. They also gave a side of spring mix salad and oven roasted potatoes that were so yummy! I am a serious potato junkie, so my fork was all over her plate ignoring my half eaten burger.The Twisted Screw was a serious drink made out of orange juice, Skyy vodka and jalapeno. My mom took two sips and could not finish the rest so of course I had to step up to the plate and take a swing! As tasty as the drink is I am warning you to sip slowly because choking on the spicy drink can and will happen.  I'm not sure if this is a good choice for a brunch drink but hey if you want to go in so early then by all means GO IN!I enjoyed my time at HFB and will definitely be back.",4

If this place was downtown, it wouldn't last and I don't think we should lower our standards because we are north of Central Park.Long Version:HFB was on my radar for a while as a place to check out because of its funky interior design and bubbly atmosphere. Although I had heard a few complaints about the food from others,  I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. I went there for Sunday brunch with a friend and found the experience to be terrible. Long story short, the food was TINY and BLAND. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros for $11 and it was basically the size of an appetizer and served on a small plate. I have never left a place still hungry and looking for another restaurant to go to. My friend had the Omelet which was so bland she kept drowning it in salt, ketchup, hot sauce...anything that would give it a little flavor - but to no avail.To make matters worse, the service was just as bad. The place was crowded and it seemed like only one person was working the floor. The waiter took 20 min fixing some mix-up on the table next to us before he finally came to take our order. I work in the restaurant industry and though I know its tough for servers, there are ways to appease almost all your customers even when you are short-staffed. Most people are understanding and will wait if you at least give them attention and let them know it might take a few minutes. Meanwhile, the manager and/or owner was just standing in the corner not doing anything. That was her chance to step in and do damage control...but she didn't.I really support harlem restaurants and would love for harlem to be a destination dining /drinking area, however I feel a lot of these new spots (including HFB) are lackluster and low -quality compared to their downtown counterparts.",1

We also had the corn on the cob appetizer, which was also very mediocre.Also, I know this is really picking at them , but the patio is on a  very slight slant, so in the hour we were sitting there, three different drinks at three different tables fell over. I guess they can't do too much about this because it's just the way the sidewalk is, but maybe someday they will fix this somehow? Service was also very slow. But the waiter was friendly.

The food was hot and served very fast.  He said he had no idea of the slow service until he sat down to eat and realized how long it took for his food to arrive.  Then he said the other cook who was slow had left hence the faster service.  Also he explained how all of the food is fresh and never frozen.  He and his team of chefs make the food fresh every morning.I went there with my family and we all ordered different dishes.  First the hamburger which my brother ate. He can't even describe it,  all he said is that it was delicious and literally one of the best burgers ever.  My dad had the beef shortribs.  They were perfectly cooked, very tender and flavorful. Everybody at our table was able to take a bite and had the same response.  Lastly my mom had the veggie burger.  She said it was very flavorful and it wasn't missing anything.  All I had were the French fries because I had ate just before that,  but let me tell you these easily rivaled the best fries in New York. I LOVED THEM!  This is definitely a place I would go back to.  It's a nice small restaurant with a community feel to it. And if you have any comments or concerns ask the manager, he is always there and ready to help or just have a nice conversation.

The prices are just off.  There's no rhyme or reason to them.  2.  Service.  Food takes forever to arrive, but the place is never that busy.  And, unlike Jado where there's only a couple of overworked servers and a packed house every day, this place has double the wait staff for half the guests.  And yet... slow food, no follow-up  to see if you need anything else, and the bartender would rather chat with friends than do his job.  Lest you write me off, let me assure you that I have no problem spending money on a good meal.  I don't think Bad Horse is overpriced and I will happily and regularly spend way more than I care to admit at Jado or Lido or Cedric.  But this food just isn't worth it.  I'm thrilled when a new option opens up here just like everyone else, but it's insulting when they think they can gouge you just because the clientele up here is aching for new places.  ""Downtown"" isn't THAT far away, guys.",5

I understand sometimes that food takes a long time and that as a new restaurant the kitchen may have been understaffed, but two very small drinks took at least 30 minutes (the bar was not particularly busy, judging by other reviews the bar tender seems to be one of those bar tenders who cares more about socializing with a select few patrons than actually making drinks).

We were a party of 3 who randomly turned into a party of 7 when it poured rain and some friends who were hanging out in Central Park joined us.The staff was super friendly and helpful in accommodating us. Drinks were well made, the food was slightly above average and the vibe was fun.I'm willing for now to say I like it. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood. I hope my opinion stays positive on a second visit - although I'm worried based on the other reviews here.",
190,,11/28/2012,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Mr F.,0,1.0,7,"Went here for dinner and drinks the other night.  One of us ordered a burger (a choice others here have praised) which just was not that good.  It was dry and overcooked.  There are other places nearby that serve much better burgers.  (Although I can't agree with the criticism of the burgers being 'overpriced' - $15 is the going rate for a hamburger).  The service was okay, can't really complain about that either.  The worst aspect of HFB is the ambiance.  People here are loud, and - during our time here - were quite disrespectful.  From wearing baseball caps indoors (!) to yelling rudely at passerbys walking down the street or to the waitress in the restaurant, it's hard to sit and enjoy a meal with this type of crowd behavior.  One really gets the sense that the clientele are slowly dragging down what could be a good place to grab dinner and drinks.  We can't rate new FDB establishments too highly just because we're eager for good establishments in the neighborhood.  They must be held to the same standards as say, downtown restaurants.",2
191,,3/8/2014,1,,"Bronx, NY",Ruoxine M.,2,3.0,8,So I went here today for brunch with my boyfriend the place is nice cute decor and set up but small so if it's just two of you enjoy but large groups I don't recommend the fries a delish they had a deal for a pitcher on Bellini for $10 pretty good you get 4 glasses out of it . They only have one server for the entire place :-/ the charged me $6 for egg whites :-/ that's a bit much.. The French toast was okay nothing to talk about!,
192,,7/20/2012,32,1,"Manhattan, NY",T G.,1,1.0,48,"I would give it no stars if it was an option. I have been sitting here for over an hour for a burger. It gets here and it is nothing that I ordered. Not to mention, three other parties have come and gone, having ordered after us. The waitress did not apologize for the food taking so long and avoided eye contact the entire time. This place is HORRIBLE! Finally, my burger arrives and halfway through I realize that they only scraped the cheese off. Now, I'm not a picky eater. I didn't request no cheese because I just don't like it. I am lactose intolerant! I ask for the manager and he completely cuts me off and justifies the horrible service, doesn't consider my feedback, patronizes me, and ultimately offers to make the burger free as sorry compensation for two hours of my life WASTED. I will never go back.",2
193,,7/13/2012,7,,"Danbury, CT",Rodney J.,3,2.0,47,Went there for lunch.  The Salmon was ok but the service just adequate. Not a bad place but nothing special.,2
194,,4/30/2013,4,,"Manhattan, NY",Cee W.,0,4.0,33,"Went the other night and had the salmon BLT and I'm a fan. The portion of salmon was very reasonable and it was really tasty. I had it with fries instead of salad and their fries are delicious. The restaurant it self is pretty small so it seems like it can me a hit or miss on getting a table, but  I would be back.",

199,,2/2/2013,3,,"Manhattan, NY",Duncan K.,0,5.0,5,"Long time (comparatively) resident of thispartbof Harlem. Absolutely love it here- lots of new places have sprung up with the new buildings opening. HFB I have to say stands out for a few reasons1) the food!  It's all about good food and great prices. They change up the menu- specials are great. Salmon BLT seriously is delicious. Non meat eater here - plenty choices. It's all about the great food!!2) vibe- nice crowd , including wait/ bar staff. A few changes- some i miss some I don't. 3) the owner. Seriously nice guy- he is into you having a great experience - talk to him say hello- he is a chatty one. He and his place are a great addition to Harlem. It's just going to get better!Sure , I couple point out a few minor things, but being it this business- I don't care- they get it right 99% of the time.Bon app folks!Ps I hear a new brunch menu coming!!!",
