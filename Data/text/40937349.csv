1,Nancy K.,"Bennington, VT",196,515,263,3.0,5/19/2018,"Had an event nearby Thursday evening that I was really early for despite skipping two buses to walk so I figured I'd have a beer. I never drink beer anymore... too busy drinking wine. Anyway...There were some spots at the bar so I sidled up and was immediately greeted by the woman tending bar who was super friendly. I ordered a Two Hearted. I haven't had one in years but Michigan beer is awesome and the rest of the tap selections were pretty ""meh"". The beer wasn't fresh - pretty common for IPAs transported a ways. I know this and still ordered it so I have no one to blame but myself.There were two bridge and tunnel types next to me - surprising considering that this spot is farther west than most venture. They were fairly rude to the woman bartender after she asked them not to sit blocking an exit and to get their extra crap off the bar... not cool. But again, not the bar's fault.A woman sitting caddy corner to me appeared to be a regular and was very sweet. We chit chatted a little but the music was kind of loud. Fine with me - it was a great mix (80's hair band ballads and late 70's/early 80's rock). I only had time for one beer and because I was heading to a dinner I didn't eat. That said, I'd come in again and imagine my rating will change. Nice to be at a place that didn't have the recently graduated frat boy happy hour going on :)",1,1,1
2,Jennifer K.,"Matamoras, PA",21,15,0,1.0,10/6/2018,"Worst food I have ever been served at a restaurant. Tasteless, over cooked crap. Bartender was pleasant, but he didn't want to know why out food was uneaten. Avoid at all costs!!!!",,,
3,Katie R.,"New York, NY",61,31,9,5.0,9/21/2017,Just bumped into this place and I love it. Met the owner who is a legend. Also met the best bartender I've ever had. Irish guy named jimmy- thanks for the awesome service! Would love to come back. Highly recommend.,1,,
4,Danny S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,9,0,1.0,1/5/2018,"Did you just play Urban League Volleyball?Are you a tourist group who just happened to be hungry in Hell's Kitchen/Midtown area?If so, read this one PLEASE.It takes a lot for me to get on Yelp and write a review about a particular place I have been to because I have way better things to do but I've GOT TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW about what goes down in this damn saloon. This is happening to every party that goes in there and I won't let it happen to you!Let me quickly go through the food because this is what users will be looking for first. Bottom line, you could do better than this place. The Boston Market on the same street could make you happier. I was with my team here after a sad first round loss in the playoffs (that had nothing to do with this review, I promise). I ordered the Spiced Chicken Sandwich while my lovely girlfriend ordered a Caesar salad with Salmon. First of all, picture this about my sandwich. Both sandwich buns were 1 inch thick. The chicken itself was half an inch thick. That's not only bullcrap but chickencrap as well, pigcrap, all farm animal crap. I substituted fries for a salad and my teammates all thought it looked better than the Caesar salad, which only had cut up lettuce and a piece of salmon. Imagine if a regular caesar salad was ordered without a protein. Man that thing was $18 too. I could buy 9 lettuces from the grocery store and have $10 in change. By God, this is the devil's work for sure.Now onto the biggest crime. Bigger than Mona Lisa. It says clearly on their menu that ""there will be an 18% gratuity charge on parties of 8 or more."" It cannot be any clearer than that. We were a party of 5 and when we got received our bill from the waiter, not only did he try to charge us with gratuity, he went overboard like he was on the Titanic and put in 20%! 20%? My buddy and I went to the waiter and we stated our case that first of all we only had 5 people and that we should not have been charged with 18% gratuity. Secondly, he charged us 20% instead of 18%. The waiter said the gratuity was calculated with the tax to which my friend immediately said, ""you don't charge gratuity with the tax charge."" I also said that we shouldn't even have that charge in the first place. He was getting hot in the face and said we were occupying a table for 6 and that's why he had to add the gratuity. Man, this guy must be a professional gravedigger because he was digging a hole so deep for himself, I thought he was going to freaking China. Under immense pressure and with proof from a Iphone calculator (which he SOMEHOW DIDN'T BELIEVE) he stubbornly said, ""Fine, you pay what you want..."" He had to scream that too because he was buried so deep. Finally, we wanted to get the 10% discount that Urban League said they'd give if you played a game that night. We showed him our email with the schedule but he said we didn't have our shirts so there was no proof. Uh, hello, we logged into our email accounts and showed you our schedule. Pretty sure that's more proof than me bringing in last season's shirts and just wearing it to get a discount. Come on.. In the end he caved again and gave us the discount. He probably made off with so much money from previous parties who did not check so I was not feeling sorry.If you come here, and I don't see why you would when there are better options around, be careful when reviewing your bills. These waiters are sneakier than the bad guys in Scooby-Doo. 1 Star only.",1,2,
5,Sylvia R.,"Miami, FL",213,1,0,1.0,7/19/2017,i've been in here a few times the last couple weeks and the lady bartender Catherine is so awesome and sweet. This past weekend i went in for a burger and it was alright but when i grabbed a fry it was tangled in a hairball. like long black hairs. i told the bartender and he took it back and they brought me a new plate and the fries looked fresh but i couldnt really eat after that and didnt even get comp'd a drink and was charged for the food.sucks because they are so nice but the food is NOT OKAY :(,1,,
6,Jazmine R.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,7/31/2018,"So disappointing, I have to even give a star when I do not even want to give this place not one star. The worst driest burger on earth. I asked for a medium well burger and received it well done. I used to come here when I was pregnant and used to order the ribs with mash and also noticed it was not on the menu. The menu needs more options. I can keep going as to the waiter not even asking if we needed anything, water, napkins etc.",,,
7,Brian C.,"New York, NY",400,32,15,3.0,4/26/2017,"sign says ""voted number 1 best burger in NYC"" in the front. It wasn't bad, but it's indistinguishable from an average hells kitchen burger. Maybe it was for my friends salad but it was the first time ive had a burger come with a side of that Gray Poupon which was tight. No Evian though. No Ted Talk either. Convenient location to sit down for drinks in the immediate area but number 1 burger in nyc? Be Humble",3,4,2
8,John F.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,286,276,3.0,12/14/2016,"I am not clear on these negative reviews. This place is great. Quiet, divey, nice staff, fair drinks and beers. It was very laid back when we stopped in on a Sunday afternoon... and when I pass it on random weekend nights seems pretty quiet. This IS NOT the spot to go out and party hard, but it seems like it is a nice bar to just relax and have a few beers, or start the night off with a few shots. They do have three TVs at the bar and had a couple different games on when we were there.I don't know that I'd jump on ordering food here, but at some point may and will report back.",,,
9,Joe B.,"Blandon, PA",0,53,4,3.0,6/13/2018,Great burger cool beer ( not cold) and good service.  It is noisy but I understand that it is a bar/ saloon.  I would recommend stopping by for quick bar food. The beer prices are high. $8.50 is way too high. I would have rated it a 4 if I did not have to pay $17.00 for two beers.,,,
10,Isabell H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/28/2017,Extremely rude staff and bad service in general. And a hair in my burger.A shame on a place that I thought could be my local diner.,1,,
11,Richard Rice A.,"Manhattan, NY",12,2,0,1.0,12/6/2017,"Went in for appetize. Bartender started telling me to ""Get over Trump"" due to hat I was wearing. Been wearing the hat for a year, but an ""immigrant"" bartender ( heavy accent) will Not tell me my politics. Will NEVER step foot in again. Went Half a block and had a delightful meal.",,,
12,Ciara C.,"San Francisco, CA",804,8,0,2.0,6/24/2017,"I have been coming here for a few years. Matt is great,Brandon is great.However Michael  on friday night was an absolute nightmare i have never had an issues with any of the staff. He was very rude,violently aggressive throwing and slamming things and carrying on. I thought maybe someone upset him i understand we are all human and have our  bad days. I politely askes if he was ok he began pacing back and fourth i dont know if he was intoxicated or on drugs or what . I asked if he was ok again... and he ignored me ,i figured maybe he didnt hear me  WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I have served bartended and i have managed restaurants my whole life. I know its not an easy job. He said he hates people maybe u are at the wrong job. You shouldnt be a bartender.",1,1,
13,Kevin S.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,2.0,10/14/2017,"Too expensive, man!  $7 Guinness.  Bar directly across the street: $5 Guinness.Decent ambience, but I'm not going to pay an extra $2 per beer because I like the paint on the walls.",,,
14,Christopher R.,"Warrensburg, MO",0,11,0,5.0,10/12/2017,Stopped in for a few drinks after a show with my wife. Our hotel was around the corner so we were looking for something close. Jimmy behind the bar was warm and personable. Made sure our glasses were always full and had great conversation for the time we were there. We were just looking for a spot to have a few beers and hangout and Jimmy enhanced our experience. We will definitely be back the next time we're in town!,,,
15,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2648,3.0,1/1/2016,"I came in with a group of ten after a New Years Eve show at Terminal 5. The bar was pretty much empty, with about 3 people sitting at the bar, none of which I think were there together. The bartender greeted us warmly, we were loud but not rowdy or trashed and I'm sure that helped make us a bit less annoying. A few more people came in the bar after us and things livened up a bit. Traditional Irish pub decor, really nice on the inside. They have Patron Xo Cafe Liqueur. It's not a place I'd come out of my way for but it happened to be exactly what we needed that night.",1,,
16,Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",648,921,127,3.0,7/17/2015,"Popped in here before heading off to a concert. There was no one to greet us nor any space at the bar so we just grabbed a seat at one of the booths that didn't say reserved.I had a few Stellas, as their draft beer selection isn't that extensive. Mostly the usual suspects but that's about it. We split some appetizers including the white pizza and the quesadillas. They were all pretty good and the usual pub fare. I utilized the men's room because the women's loo was taken by someone. The bartender just smiled and waved me in. The bathroom wasn't teeny tiny like many in NYC and was actually clean so that's always a perk in my book. It took us a while to get our check but the waiter was nice.",1,,1
17,Patty G.,"Jersey City, NJ",559,303,450,2.0,6/3/2015,"Came by after a work event and must say this place was pretty blah.  The bartender was decent, we weren't asking for much just a few vodka clubs. The old school decor was cute and a nice touch but other things were just out dated like the drinking glasses and chairs. Anyway, we had to continue asking for things like water, another round and food menu.  Bartender didn't really seem like he would have asked if we needed anything if we hadnt continued to get his attention. Food was okay, we orderd some shrimp, calamri, and spring rolls. I dont think we may have finished it all I think we really were about our cocktails. Would I normally go back to this place, probably not. Would I recommend it, meh. I mean if you want to stop in for a quick beer and you live in the neighborhood okay. Other than that I dont really think this place is that great.",2,,1
18,Eunice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",178,231,104,3.0,8/31/2016,"I can't say whether there is anything special about this place except that it's conveniently located next to John Jay college. Interior is dark and TV had sports on. Had a taste of the burger, fairly juicy and not overcooked. My gin and tonic was a bit strong and $9. Overall, just a low-key place to hangout with some friends.",,,
19,Jeff H.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",50,1,0,5.0,12/18/2017,"My girlfriend and I recently stopped in starving and in need of a beverage. Having arrived minutes after the kitchen closing, Jimmy the bartender (that's actually the context and not cliche) told us we were welcome to grab a pizza slice at Justinos next door, and bring it back in while we enjoyed our drinks. In a society full of pointless rules and chaotic stupidity, it was quite refreshing to be invited to something so basically human. Thanks Jimmy; Jake's also has a nice chill bar vibe and good food.",,,

25,Ash H.,"Manhattan, NY",5,38,7,4.0,12/18/2014,"This is my new go-to pub! I've lived in the neighborhood for the last 7 years, but never came in, since I always headed directly down to the 9th avenue bars, below w57th, or went to Emerald Inn on w72nd to relax and watch the Yankees or Giants games. I'm so happy that I finally wandered in, since it's only two blocks away from me. The highlight was Catherine, the bartender, she's warm, welcoming, and very attentive, even though the bar was slammed with CBS workers coming in, after work. Go to this place, if you're looking for a local place to relax and have a pint or cocktail. This is not a scene-type place, more of a local tavern with decent pub good. Try the fish and chips, it's light and crisp, although a little on the pricey-side. This is not a tourist place, if you're looking for a 'New York- happening' place.",1,,

My friend and I, both black men (me in a suit), visited yesterday. As soon as we sat down I caught eyes with the waitress and she rolled her eyes then went to serve another group. I didn't think too much of it until she finally made her way back around and asked for our credit cards even before we ordered anything. We didn't think too much of it until we saw that no one else had to give their card until after they ordered or they were leaving.Nothing else to say.",11,,

30,Kenneth B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,2,1.0,2/24/2016,This is one of the most over priced shitholes in the city. The service is atrocious. The food is okay but not worth the outrageous prices. Stay away from this trash spot.,2,,
31,Cristian C.,"Union City, NJ",1,2,0,5.0,11/1/2016,"Every time I've gone the service has been great. I believe that, above all is important. The food could be the best in the world, but if the service leaves a bad taste in your mouth, it'll sour the whole experience. I'm also happy to say that the food here is excellent, especially the burgers. Top. Notch. It's all complimented by a bar tender who knows how to mix their drinks. It's become an almost weekly thing for me to have a burger for dinner here.",,,
32,Tiffany G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,5/22/2017,Jimmy is the best. Great fast friendly service. Bar was busy he was solo and I still didn't have to waited to get helped. Food was good for standard bar food and a good Guinness pour.,,,

35,Kishore C.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,8,0,1.0,4/14/2016,"Worst bar in New York.  We had literally the worst service I've ever seen.  When I complained about it the bartender said ""welcome to the neighborhood"".  no one is ever even in this bar which suggests many people feel the same way.  STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!!",,,1
36,Katie B.,"Bay Shore, NY",79,164,521,2.0,4/19/2013,"Resorted to eating here since we couldn't find any other appealing options near Terminal 5. Very overpriced but decent food. Fries were the best part. They have a good house beer but it wasn't really served cold enough. Seating was a bit cramped in the restaurant area with rickety chairs and benches. The service was pretty good.With all that being said, this place fulfilled our need for a meal and a beer, but it isn't anything worth going back for.",1,,
37,Ahmed E.,"New York, NY",6,14,3,1.0,9/12/2015,"Old lady Irish bartender was extremely rude and annoyed that I didn't like my drink (flat coke and whiskey she poured wasn't what I asked for). She proceeded to go around and auction off the drink I didn't like to customers going out of her way to try and embarrass me.

47,Viva S.,"Hendersonville, TN",64,30,3,1.0,12/17/2014,"This has been a standby go-to throughout years whenever I visit NYC. The food has always been reasonably consistent and they serve late (very handy when you arrive on later flight or whatever case may be - it is nice to be able to rely on decent food at hours after most restaurants serve full meals.) From what I understand this place received heavy traffic from CBS crew as studio is accross street. My most recent visit was different though. When I arrived we had a late lunch / early dinner here. The food was good, I almost always order salmon and it has never been less than tasty. I did notice however that it was relatively empty and was trying to figure why during what might normally be considered ""happy hour."" Our second visit cleared things up significantly. Another review had mentioned surly waiter who may have been same extremely unpleasant...dare I say CREEPY ""gentleman"" we were served by. During meal he was either seeming to be watching us eat but did not bother to come to table to ask if anything was needed OR wrapped up in watching game on TV. When we were preparing to leave after settling up ($95 tab for two people including two dinners, two martinis and one beer) he came over and started questioning me over where ""his glass was."" Umm... They serve water in disposable plastic beer logo cups, so clearly he had to be referring to my martini glass (which I had set apparently not on obvious enough location on bar when I had gone up to order 2nd - since he never came to table past food delivery.) THEN the bartender got behind him and crossed his arms like he was fricking bodyguard...It was the most strange, ridiculous and akward situation I've ever encountered in eatery or bar ever... I pointed to bar, where they found their $2 glass... I couldn't believe this experience but it explained a lot... Jake's (Twilight Zone) and Saloon...yikes... Yelp really ought to allow zero stars or even just ratings for food and service individually - the food here is good, the service is not.",3,1,

It really was cold and rainy.)I was literally in here for 5 mins and I will never come here again. It was raining and cold. My fiancé, our best friend, and I were looking for a bar to get dry and catch up over beers. We arrive and are trying to remove our rain-soaked coats when my friend accidentally knocks over an empty canister at the bar. He apologizes profusely and tries to soothe the awkwardness by joking about how it's been 2 mins and he's already made a bad impression on the bartender. She immediately retaliates by telling him he can insult himself but not her (whaaat?). At this point we don't even know what to say. My friend asks where the bathroom is so everyone can take 5. Then she turns to my fiancé and I, doesn't greet us or ask us what we would like to drink, but snaps, ""I need to see some ID,"" no eye contact, nothing. We say ""..nevermind"" as we are clearly not welcome. No catty remarks or under the breath retorts (but I really wanted to!). We get hit with ""so you just come into my bar and make a mess and leave."" I have never have experienced such rude and terrible service and I am a born and bred New Yorker. I will never come here again, and I hope you don't either. I'd give them zero stars if Yelp would let me.",2,,

I only stopped in today because a friend and I wanted to try their food. (Last time we only each had a beer). Today the same friend and I were to meet there, but I arrived first. I walked in, two tables were taken. I wasn't acknowledged. I said hello to the bartender. She was alone behind the bar. (older Caucasian with black hair). I said hello first. She said I can sit anywhere and the waiter would be over. He came over with menus. My friend came in and we ordered our beers. Hers came in fine. Mine was not poured out properly. There was no head to it. I didn't want to complain about it. We went ahead and ordered our food. Two orders of wings and one order of fries. Now the other two people had left and our order had taken over 30 mins to come out. It was disturbing. I didn't mention that I am dark skinned- and my friend is not. The customer service was sad.

Luckily we came in right before it got super crowded, so we were able to be seated right away. Unfortunately what was most memorable was the fact that they serve you water in these really pretty glasses that are way too small, and then fail to refill them promptly. We had to stop eating a couple times because we couldn't get any more down without some water. Even after we asked we still had to wait a bit.I feel bad about being bothered by it because it was obvious that there was just one man serving that whole entire section (and it was seriously busy), but water is one of those basic needs. It would really help if they just served it in normal sized glasses. They'd be helping us and themselves.",1,,

Boy was I WRONG.If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food is HORRIBLE and ridiculously overpriced. Let me give you a real life example of the insanity. Pregnant Sarah (thats me) desperately wanted chicken strips and fries. I sent my husband to Jakes since it was down the block, I was starving...and honestly...who could screw up chicken strips. Well! I have an answer to that question. Jakes can!!! First of all...my order of chicken strips and fries came to $19.50 (no that is not a typo). The fries were soooooo soggy and I could not even eat the chicken thats how bad they were. They tasted like plastic mixed with fish. It was gross.This was not the first time we had tried Jakes. We had gone once before and had some overpriced burnt burgers. We were basically the only people in there and the wait for food or even to have your water refilled was atrocious. So...bottomline. If you want horrible, overpriced food and bad service...go to Jakes. If you don't like those things, do yourself a favor and find another place to spend your money!",6,4,3

My friend and I asked for water and the bartender Connor REFUSED to serve us water. He told us it was a busy bar and he couldn't serve us. This is after I spent $60 there. I have been a bartender and I have never ever done something like that to anyone. Nor have I ever had anyone do it to me. I'm not sure what his problem is but he needs serious therapy. He was a complete d-bag. If he has that much of a problem serving people he should get a real job.,3,1,

They are able to totally rip you off on beer price-points since they are literally the only watering hole in blocks and blocks and you will walk out feeling rather robbed.  If you need a place to go pre-Terminal 5-show, I guess this is one of your only options but I'd highly recommend trekking east one more avenue to someplace on 9th.  Trust me and thank me later.",,,

I don't have much more to say than the food was quite good,  but I had to leave the table to ask for more water and to get the check.

75,Rob N.,"New York, NY",366,51,46,1.0,1/7/2008,"Jake's is across the street from where I live and work and I am sad.  I am sad as it once was a pretty cool eclectic bar--Armstrongs and it had a solid beer list and a wild menu that was printed like a small college telephone book on plain paper and stapled.  I liked it and my brother, when he lived with me years back, practically live there--perhaps he just had a crush on the bartender....But back to Jakes (or really never back to jakes). I say there is no happy hour and it is not good for groups (that may not be the real reality), because I would not be happy nor want to take a group there, sadly.  The food is passable, the drinks nothing special, the service, well, okay it is not terrible, but the place makes me automatically sadder than a bar should;  it is just so unexciting and lack luster. Am I just disappointed in the proximately of mediocrity? Or perhaps I am bitter in this instance as it should be my local--the place I live at and have people meet me at when I have not done the dishes or the liquor cabinet is bare.  But instead I head Greek Kitchen more often if I want close food or I head further down the avenue or to 9th or downtown to drink n eat.  I say don't impose sadness on your next rendezvous, skip Jakes walk a little further for your food and drink. and fun.

The food quality varies widely depending on what you order and who's cooking.  My standing order is the salmon, which, when not overcooked to death, is pretty good.  The last time I ordered their onion rings, they were inedible (and i'm no onion-ring snob).  Their mango-chicken rolls are a good appetizer, but considering their new price (i think at least $11) it's hard to feel like you're getting a good value.  As for their drinks...I swear the glasses have gotten smaller, and again, the quality of their mixed drinks varies widely depending on who's serving.  I've had cosmos come in a vairety of colors and flavors - so not exactly dependable.
