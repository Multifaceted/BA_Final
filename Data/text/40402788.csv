0,Lianna T.,"New York, NY",226,98,132,4.0,7/17/2018,"A neighborhood spot that's good for a wholesome, standard brunch any day of the week. Their omelettes are well done and come with a side of a corn muffin, salad and home fries. Their salads are also fresh and satisfying. In the sit down area, the crowd tends to be a little older and a lot of families. However, they also have a large take out section with pre-prepared salads, hot foods, and salads, wraps, and soups to go. The space is light and airy with big windows all around. While it may not be a place worth traveling to, it's the perfect spot to have in the neighborhood for a meal to go or to meet the family for a mid-week meal.",1,,
1,JANUARY S.,"New York, NY",1,14,0,1.0,11/11/2018,"I decided to take a chance on this place despite the mixed reviews. Based on my one star, you can guess which side of the mixed reviews my experience fell. My order came in about 50 mins: scrambled eggs with salmon; shoe string fries; and fried mozzarella balls. Upon examining the scrambled eggs I noted 1) it was ice cold. NOTHING is worse than cold eggs. 2) there was a lot to be desired with the twice baked potato. It was a scoop of instant mashed potato. 3) sourdough toast was missing. I called the restaurant. The girl who answered was nice enough. I told her I was missing sourdough toast. After being placed on hold, she came back to ask if I would like credit for the toast i.e. I'm not getting toast with my cold eggs. I told her not to worry about it because I won't be ordering from them again; everything was COLD!!!  I honestly don't know why they charge such a huge premium on their food. It's bleck.",,,
2,Taryn C.,"New York, NY",274,729,37,3.0,7/17/2018,"More like three and a half stars.I follow this place on Instagram.  When I found myself in the neighborhood (I'm a West Side gal, and going to the east side is like basically getting my passport stamped) on a Saturday, I go - hey, let's check that place I follow on IG.  And it was OK.  Seems their bread and butter is their creative waffle platters, savory and sweet.  So naturally I didn't get a waffle, haha.  But I tried their crab cake benedict and it was very good.  I forget what my husband ordered, a sandwich of some type, but he said it was very good.  Seems like they get a lot of business for take out too.  I'd like to go back, I didn't hate it.  But I also was not 100% in love with it either, and the time I find myself back on the UES for a late breakfast/early lunch is highly unlikely.",,,
3,Kiana R.,"Owings Mills, MD",37,55,41,4.0,9/30/2018,"Checked out this place while visiting NYC.  In summary the food and service was good although I had multiple issues with the check...but things happen.  Bathrooms were kind of yucky though.  Anyway...they have a large menu and the waffle selection was extensive.  The chicken and waffles was yummy! Belgium waffle with sliced fried chicken breast on top.....no complaints and I would definitely recommend.  My niece got the French toast which she liked as well.  So overall the food was tasty, atmosphere was good minus the bathroom and the service was also good minus the multiple issues with the check.  But all in all if you are in the neighborhood and want a good brunch check it out!",2,,
4,Angie C.,"New York, NY",1,2,1,1.0,10/14/2018,"One star. If you would like to pay over $20 for eggs, bacon, home fries and white toast - this is the place for you. The only thing that was different from the southern breakfast vs. food that I got was that the southern breakfast had fried tomatoes and cornbread. Yet it was over $5 cheaper. The sizes of the dishes were similar. Since I read the owner's response for another complaint, I attach the receipt for your reference.",,,
5,Susan B.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/20/2018,"I just celebrated my 70th birthday with 50 of my nearest and dearest and an incredible meal catered by the Corner Cafe and Bakery. Everything from the meeting to decide on the menu to the delivery went very smoothy and professionally with a beautiful spread of sandwiches, pinwheels, salads and fruit as the result. Everyone at the party had their favorite from the asian chicken salad on brioche, to the eggplant pinwheels, or the wonderful salad with the most divine carmelized walnuts I've ever tasted. What's more....the price was quite reasonable and I definitely got a tremendous amount for the money . I wholeheartedly recommend the Corner Cafe and Bakery for all of your catering needs.",,,
6,Amelia S.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,5.0,11/17/2018,"I've been to Corner Cafe and Bakery around four times now and have had great experiences every time. The service is always great and the food is delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the NYC brunch scene (long wait times, mediocre food, loud patrons) so this is exactly what I'm looking for for a lazy weekend breakfast. The crowd is a lot of Upper East Side families but it's also perfect for couples and people eating by themselves. Keep in mind that it's not the cheapest despite the casual feel of the place, but it's perfect if you really need a great breakfast.",,,
7,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,3.0,11/1/2017,"I walk by this place all the time and finally stopped by for brunch. The wait staff was very nice and attentive, the place was clean, and definitely has a diner feel to it. I had the BELT sandwich, which I was slightly underwhelmed by. I have had similar sandwiches before and this one was just kind of flavorless with a lot of lettuce and tomato that was still slightly green. The portion was definitely huge though, which probably accounts for the price. My friend got the steak and eggs and really enjoyed his plate, which was again a relatively large portion.I'm not sure that I would come back for the BELT again, but will probably return to try other menu items, specifically the Waffles which seem to be very popular!",1,1,1

The food was just as good!We ordered a chocolate s'mores waffle special and a BLT sandwich. The waffles were delicious, cooked perfectly and a very large portion. The BLT was excellent and served with a salad and a small side of potato. Our waiter was polite, accommodating and attentive. The restaurant was clean and the spacious. The bathroom was clean too!We will definitely be back to try other things on their menu!",3,1,2
9,Restaurantista S.,"Manhattan, NY",9,104,15,1.0,11/29/2017,"Skip.Take a look at the photos I posted.  Delivery.com. delivered the food. The ice cream sundae arrived looking like it was missing part. There were a few sprinkles and barely any chocolate sauce. The cost was $6.95. The restaurant sent me a bag of mustard, jelly, mayonnaise​, ​and butter despite ordering fruit and two desserts. But this restaurant seems to operate with a, who cares attitude. The strawberries on the fruit platter were spoiled. See the photos. I don't expect to be sent rotten fruit. This is garbage for $10.95. There are better restaurants to order from, ​and I would not recommend this place.",2,,
10,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",535,295,292,5.0,5/8/2017,"Came across this place and it was such a good find! I wouldn't say this food is mind blowing, but it's definitely solid and you will leave happy and full. When you enter this restaurant, you will be whisked away from the city into a suburban diner setting. Everything feels comfortable and you instantly feel at home. There was no wait on Sunday at around 12PM, however this restaurant was definitely packed. I ordered a customized omelette that came with these delicious mashed potatoes, corn bread, and salad. I really appreciated the salad and the sides were all great. To say their portions are big is an understatement. I didn't really like that the cheese in my omelette was literally just a slice of cheese. It was not melted either, so if you're ordering an omelette with cheese take this into consideration! My friend ordered the salmon scramble and while I did not try it, he said it was absolutely delicious. Both of us cleared our plates despite the large portions. We left feeling SO FULL but SO GOOD.Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a casual sit-down brunch cafe. They also serve lunch foods and entrees, but we stuck with brunch.",2,1,2
11,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,2.0,9/17/2017,"This place has a severe identity complex and can't figure out if it wants to be a diner, a deli, a cafe, a bakery, or a white tablecloth restaurant. By the looks of it, I don't think they do any of them particularly well. The prices are sky-high, but you can tell that this is where octogenarian Upper East Siders come when they want to ""slum it"".If you want to pay $17 for an underwhelming wrap (to-go) and twiddle your thumbs for 30 minutes while you wait for it, this is the place for you. And for what they charge for their food, you think they would fix the businesses up a bit, it clearly hasn't been renovated in decades and the decor is dated. The other time I stopped in, I was also not impressed by my flat, lifeless, but very expensive cappuccino. Two stars because the staff is *nice*, however, they do move at a glacial speed to deliver a subpar product at an exorbitant price.",3,2,1
12,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,2.0,8/6/2017,"I'm so disappointed by this place. I've walked by countless times and finally went to try it for brunch on a Sunday morning. The restaurant was pretty empty for prime weekend brunch hour. We were immediately poured tap water which tasted like chemicals. I've never had a problem with NYC tap water, and I had to return this undrinkable water! After ordering our drinks, 3 separate times, with 3 different waitstaff, 10 minutes later the drinks arrived, wrong. Iced tea instead of iced coffee. Pretty unbelievable right off the bat I was irritated. We ordered 2 egg dishes and the waiter wrote down the order. A different waiter needed to come over and confirm the order, which was odd. The dishes came out correct. My corn muffin that came out with my eggs was grilled but still had a piece of the paper wrapper on it.The waitstaff was so over attentive it was irritating, almost as if they had nothing better to do but check in individually 5 separate times. Too much!! The food was fine, but nothing special for the overpriced cost of $15 for eggs. We got our check and the drinks weren't on it. I thought great, they took them off because it took 15 minutes to get and they came out wrong. We gave our credit card and when it was returned to sign they had added back on the drinks and charged the extra without even telling us! Not how you do business. The only reason this has 2 stars is because the food wasn't bad. I won't be coming back here.",7,4,3

16,Amy F.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,10/22/2018,Horrible. Dirty. Expensive. Did you ever get a blt come where you have to assemble it yourself? And when you ask about it they tell you if you want it assembled you have to order it that way. Why are there twice baked potato's on every item? So they can charge $18 for a sandwich? The twice baked potato was a scoop of brown mashed potato left over on every single plate. I can't understand why anyone would wait on a line to have breakfast here. Get in the line for the bus that gets you out of there.,,,

Updated review","Let me start by saying that I did not eat anything here.  For all I know the food is phenomenal - I'm simply writing this review to say that a short stack of 3 small pancakes costs $15 . I ordered 2 side orders to go.  The pancakes were regular (not potato or whole wheat or anything else like that ) .. and they were slightly larger than silver dollar style . I ordered 2 sides of them and was given a bill for $30.38. I thought it was a mistake at first.  Am i wrong here ? Am I just out of touch with the current market rate of pancake mix ? Maybe I am .. I live and work in the area and can think of plenty of places that are significantly cheaper.   I'm going to buy my own pancake mix from now on at Gristedes. For $30 I can cook pancakes for a family of 6 for a week .Sincerely , Disgruntled pancake guy. .....They were small and they were expensive. Anywhere else they'd be $4.99. .. but I appreciate your response.  - sincerely Disgruntled pancake guy",1,1,

Updated review","Came here for brunch on Saturday with my sisters and friend. As soon as we have noticed they present new waffles, everyone decided to try different waffle menus to share. All waffles named very fancy and we felt already tasty from the next table.The waffles were perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with sauces. Each waffle dish portion was big enough for entree and an awesome combinations with meats, boneless chicken,  flank steak, pork and also together with homemade sauces.The highlight was our dessert waffle, ""ELVIS PRESLEY"" As a fan of Elvis Presley, I have known that he liked the peanut butter sauce and bacon. The combination of waffle with vanilla ice cream, fried plantain strips, fudge sauce, peanut butter sauce and smoked bacon was sooooo good. Service was excellent and staffs were friendly as always. We loved it and will definitely be back again to try other waffles.",1,,1
19,Kyra Z.,"Cambridge, MA",2,42,19,2.0,3/28/2018,"This place is aggressively mediocre. Used to come here a lot when it was still Yura, but since it came under new management several years ago the service has gotten worse and the prices have gotten steeper. Despite their weirdly, perpetually-expanding menu (waffles! chicken wings! quinoa!) this location is no longer worth a visit.There never seems to be anyone in here (at my most recent visit I think there were three occupied tables at 7 PM on a weekend) and yet the service is consistently poor. It's difficult to get the attention of one of the three waiters in the nearly empty dining room to be seated, and once you are it's been my experience that you tend to be ignored. The staff isn't rude or hostile per se, just seemingly very apathetic.The food here is fine, for the most part, but try to leave without spending upwards of $20 (even for more humble menu offerings like a burger or a salad) and you'll see it's none too easy. I can understand some of the entrees being pricier (although $22 for spaghetti and chicken meatballs? Give me a break), but for the most part, you're not getting what you're paying for. The last time I was here I had a turkey burger that was physically too large to hold, let alone consume comfortably. The most consistent menu item I've found is the Thai Chicken Salad, but that alone is not worth the time and effort.",,,
20,Peter C.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,3/22/2018,"Do NOT order food from this place. They will not send you your complete order. And when you call them they call you a liar. Outrageous. Last time it was a chicken salad ($15-20) with no chicken. And tonight a $15 hamburger with NOTHING. No lettuce. No tomato. No onion. No sauce. No nothing. I gave them a second chance, they will not get a third.",,,
21,Joe M.,"Queens, NY",100,133,9,4.0,5/16/2017,"You will be drawn here by the scent of baked goods that permeates the neighborhood, but I will admit, it will not disappoint!! Chocolate chip scones are killer! Everything here is really good (muffins, cakes, cookies, etc) but I will admit it's not exactly cheap. They serve frozen yogurt as well, which seems to be  popular among the kids in the neighborhood after school so keep that in mind when stopping by around late afternoon. They offer a few tables and chairs and an outdoor bench if you wish!",2,2,2
22,Juliana J.,"New York, NY",0,1,2,5.0,6/7/2017,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in upper east side. One of my favorite menu here is a Quinoa bowl. I'm pretty sure you won't regret if you order red curry salmon bowl or peruvian bowl that is always fresh, healthful and flavorful. I also really like their nacho that even much better than eating in authentic Mexican restaurant. always very fresh and tasty. I think the foods are here really healthful and flavorful, so I am willing to pay a premium.",2,,
23,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,151,4.0,5/13/2017,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for lunch on a Monday. The place was packed--as it always seems to be. We were lucky to grab a table at one of the auxiliary seating areas.For my meal, I decided to go with the tofu bibimbap. This dish was actually surprisingly tasty and was a generous portion as well.This place is definitely not the cheapest, but the servings match the price point. While the service was friendly, the food took FOREVER to come out--I think it took about 40 minutes for us to be served our food. So while this place has some tasty items, make sure you don't get caught during the lunch rush if you're in a hurry.",2,1,1

Lots of flavors of cream cheese too. I love the window seating. Get here early if you want to sit. This place us usually full of locals eating, chatting, or reading their paper over a cup of coffee.

Updated review","Just opened today, May 11, 2016. It's still owned and operated by The Corner Cafe and Bakery. And it still bakes all of the goodies for the sister restaurant bakery and restaurant on the corner of 92 and 3rd, and Madison Avenue. For one- I can speak on behalf of most of the neighborhood residents, that we were all anticipating the reopening of The Bagel Shop. It's rebranded and recreated its entire space. It's a bright, open space, suitable for both children and adults. And second, I always complained about how salty their Everything Bagels were. But they could not do anything about it, since their bagels were manufactured elsewhere. But now, their everything bagels are delicious. And they even have flagels! Everything is made on-premise.",12,7,8
28,Leah S.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",29,38,0,2.0,5/22/2018,"We went here because we were looking for a diner to have breakfast. While the menu resembles that of a diner menu, the prices do not. We ordered the French toast which was some kind of regular commercial sliced bread. It was dry and they didn't even use real maple syrup for $13 and the coffee which was not good was $3.95. My wife ordered the Irish smoked salmon and eggs was just ok, with a scoop of guacamole for $16.50. The toast was delicious! The service was lovely as was our waiter. I am not complaining about the prices but the quality of the food for the price was definitely not worth it - but again, our server was great - which is why I gave it 2 stars.",,,

Guess I wasn't considered good enough for one of those tables. The restaurant had a strange dirty smell and the bathroom floor is sticky. While I was eating, a waiter came to my table, leaned over me and my food and adjusted the temperature gauges over my head. I've attached a picture of them from my seat.  Very weird.  And awkward feeling for me. Food was ok but I got a simple dish of scrambled eggs and toast.  Basically I didn't feel welcome here and won't return.",1,,

Nothing from the display jumped at me, it all just lacked luster. They had some cookies, pies, cakes but nothing really special or that grabbed my eye and said take me home.The coffee did smell very good. The lady behind the register was nice enough but you could tell she really didn't want to be bothered every time I asked a question. The place was clean and everything had it's place. There are few tables were you can sit and eat and sip your goods.After looking at what they had over and over I refused to go home empty handed and picked a slice of coconut custard pie not at all what I initially would have wanted to eat for breakfast but nothing else was appealing. I have to say the pie was good. Was it the best coconut custard pie I've ever had, no. Would I get it again, yes. Was it worth $6 for a slice, no.",6,3,6

I am pleased to say that the recipe for their omelettes has NOT changed since.... forever...1996? Everything is exactly how it looked and tasted since I was a child and it's always tasty. Over time the potatoes on the side have gotten smaller and the price has almost doubled in the past few years (it was 8$ in like 2007 or something ) and now it's 15$? Insane but I still come every so often because it's a piece of my childhood,1,1,1
35,Bronx B.,"Bronx, NY",2,61,17,2.0,5/8/2017,"Am I late to the party?  Since when does a simple pancake dish costs $15?  With nothing else on the side except strawberries?  New York is better than this.Came here on a Sunday early afternoon with a total of 4 people and at least the wait was not bad.  After we were seated the Disappearing Server Syndrome struck again and it stuck bad at this location.  We waited and waited and waited for our server (or anyone!) to greet us and get us started with coffee at least.  Seriously, it was about a full 15 minutes and we were very ready to order already (that rhymed).  When our server finally appeared, she gave us no eye contact while taking orders.  Honestly, we talking TO HER and she was talking TO THE WINDOW.  I found it so rude and then we didn't see her again until it was bill time.  Never checked on how our food was, if we were satisfied overall, nothing.  We gave the bare minimum tip of 15% for such empty service.The food here was quite tasty except for the kids pizza my daughter had.  It reminded me of Ellio's frozen pizza.  My daughter did not touch it once.  She just munched off of the rest of our plates.  Meanwhile, I had the Custard Bread Pudding ($15!) and it was very, very good.  I think I had the best dish out of all of us.  My husband had the Blue Angel Kobe Burger and he discovered that he does not like blue cheese.  My sister had the steak and eggs and the steak was very flavorful.  Not dry but juicy and yummy.  I almost forgot about all of the negatives until my gaze falls onto the Ellios pizza and the bill.Pros:Really good tasting, flavorful food.Cons:One unisex bathroom stall for the whole restaurant.  Come on!  I really hate this.Too expensive for just breakfast.Conclusion:Still looking for that to-go-to place on Sundays after ballet class for the kiddie and I will keep on looking after my experience here.",,,

H.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,2.0,12/29/2017,"I have been a customer at Corner for years and years.  It used to be pretty wonderful.  Now it's lost it.  There is a lot of hubbub and business -- much staff on the premises -- but no one giving us menus or asking for our orders once we were seated.  The room was pretty full, but every man was for himself -- I started to wonder if each customer had gone to the kitchen and cooked her or her own breakfast.When we finally got our orders, two of them were incomplete.  A bagel and smoked salmon came without cream cheese because the Corner Cafe had run out of cream cheese, and hadn't thought to mention it.  When we finally got our server's attention, she said that someone in the kitchen was going out to their sister shop 50 yds away to get some more -- that took15 minutes at least.  The side order of toast was forgotten until we reminded our server we had asked for it, and it arrived after the eggs were finished.No one offered our table refills on our coffee, though we did see them offer it to other tables.   A long and stupid breakfast that was out of sorts and not inexpensive.  We felt forgotten and neglected.  So let me say this, Corner:We all had a good run.  (We especially liked your  now-shuttered Madison Avenue location.)  But when my daughters were little and went to ballet school next door, we'd always drop by this location for a snack or a late lunch, or take-out for dinner.  Now in this chapter of our lives, we've returned to Corner after our morning colonoscopies.  But we will not be coming back.Life is too short.",2,,

When I asked for my coffee he forgot my cream, and I had to flag down a busboy for it. Then as we placed our orders my sister was genuinely curious about the granola and yogurt and wanted to know if not getting the banana would effect the price. At first he says no it doesnt change the price. Then my sister tells him then thats fine and that she will get the yogurt and banana.When the food comes the banana isn't there so she asks the server for it and he says sorry and goes to get the banana. But then he comes back empty handed and says that on the menu it says banana OR yogurt and goes on to say would you like to speak with the manager? At this point we were already livid and just wanted to get out of there because on the menu it clearly says banana AND yogurt. What a horrible experience for portions that were ridiculously minuscule. And as for my spinach wrap it was bland. The only good thing was the side salad that had some kind of oil and vinegar dressing.",4,2,1
48,Gina K.,"New York, NY",530,172,922,4.0,2/18/2016,"You can smell this neighborhood bakery when you're in the block radius. Waft it all in. You walk in to an enormous open kitchen with bakers kneading dough and tempering chocolate. Around the perimeter of the entrance, you can easily witness neighbors catching up, and children eating butterfly shaped sugar cookies with pink sprinkles laden on top. It's a feel good establishment. Corner Bakery serves an array of humble baked goods that have helped me make it through the miserable months of studying for the mcat and the just as miserable breakups. That's a lot of weight I just put on this bakery, I know. I was feeling a lot of feels when I lived in the area. Order:- House drip coffee with some milk (I liked the soy) or just black- Orange-date muffin: Do you remember being a little kid and hopping out of Baskin-Robbins feeling damn excited for your ice cream cone, only to feel devastated as you watch the whole scoop splat onto the sidewalk in slo-mo after your first lick? That's how I felt as an ""adult"" when a strange, incredibly strong wind swept up my muffin and flung it out of my hands and onto the streets. My roommates had never seen me enter the apartment so distraught. The orange brings a light acid to the earthy and ever so homey date flavor. It's a hug.- Savory scone (usually has bacon in it): it's like a breakfast sandwich in a more compact, neat, but also delicious form. Butter and bacon, all encompassed in a baked good. Wut. - Cranberry banana muffin - Sugarless scone (mixed berry)- Breakfast sandwich on croissant: You can pick what you want but I think my favorite was the classic bacon, egg and cheese. It comes out steamy and fresh. **skip cupcakes (but I'm from the DC area and nobody beats Georgetown Cupcakes  in my book).Really try anything that catches your eye! They have their regular rotation, but sprinkle in some seasonal treats. They're not Jean-Georges, but also don't try to be.",1,,1

You order at a counter, pay in another line, and wait around for your order to be called. It's super disorganized People who walk in never know where the line is.

Why can't they just take order and charge you in one line like a normal place?!?Second, this employee named Daryl got my order wrong BOTH times. It's like he made up my order in his head instead of listening to me. First time I ordered small coffee, he put down large. I felt like it was too much hassle to go back and change it so I didn't say anything. Second time, I asked for everything bagel he gave me plain.

Updated review","This is the new incarnation of the bakery that's associated with the Corner Cafe, a block south. With a new emphasis on bagels, it's worth revisiting. They still have some of the sweets from the old operation, but many more cream cheese spreads and sandwich options.The layout is still awful, especially when it gets busy. There's a huge amount of empty space, a few tables, and a nonsensical ordering system.The bagels are terrific. Yes, the interior is a bit soft and over-proofed, but the exterior is just this side of crunchy, the flavor is excellent, and the toppings actually adhere. I know the softness may bother some bagel purists, but the perfect is the enemy of the good. And these bagels are pretty darn good.",1,,2
55,Jo S.,"West Hempstead, NY",0,8,0,4.0,12/22/2017,"Went to this place for Sunday Brunch with my sister and we were both very satisfied. I got a special waffle (had Nutella, strawberry, ice cream and choc chips) and she got the steak and eggs. The waffle was delightful. Fluffy, filling, sweet, amazing. The fruits were fresh. The steak was well seasoned and the eggs were cooked just how she ordered them. We got a mimosa and a peach bellini to drink and no complaints about those. It is on the pricey side but we split the meal and were both stuffed and content with both the sweet and savory aspects of the meal. Only giving it a 4 for the price but would give it a 5 if cost was of no consequence for me.",,,

Then I waited in line to pick up my order. It was the wrong type of bagel, and one of the two toppings was wrong, even though the printed out receipt showed the correct order.

I specified cheddar cheese and on two of the three occasions i was given Swiss cheese. Not cool.   Also was asked if I wanted my bagel toasted. A true ""New York bagel"" shop shouldn't ask you if you want it toasted because if baked on premise they should be done just right.

Occasionally, I'd get a sub par meal when I order delivery, the lasagna mainly so have stopped ordering that, but I have never complained and have never asked for refund, despite the cost. Last night, I ordered the tuna and avocado sandwich - this has been my number one fav here and have even asked them to make especially for me when they've taken off their menu. Unfortunately, I ate about half of my sandwich before I started feeling incredibly ill. It started with sharp pains that lasted for almost an hour until I got repeatedly sick (and I can't put into words how painful that was and continues to be). It's almost 24 hours later and I still have the sharp pains and can barely keep down the little bit of food I just tried. I had zero symptoms prior to this meal and was in no way ill; This food was 100% the cause. I didn't complain initially because I figured this was just a fluke, but being so sick into today, I called grubhub to ask for a refund. The manager here denied any fault, declined to refund, and made several rude remarks that grubhub sent along. And to think... I wasn't even going to complain about their food making me as sick as it has because I generally like this place and have been a long time customer. Well, screw that! How cheap can you possibly be to debate a sick customer over $20?!? Well, you'll lose a lot more than that as I plan to never eat here again, and mostly likely a few other people who might not want to risk food poisoning, bad food, or whatever the issue is here.

I find the prices fairly competitive for the neighborhood, too.There's some great people watching here. Seems like this spot attracts many different types of people.Boosting this review up to 4 stars since they are one of the few places I've seen in a while offering fried green tomatoes. In fact, the Southern Breakfast ($13.50) -- which included eggs, bacon, those tomatoes, home fries, and a corn muffin -- was very satisfying overall.I'd say that while I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, if I was in the area and looking for a great brunch, I would not hesitate to come back!",3,2,1

72,Lawrence R.,"Brooklyn, NY",215,114,35,2.0,5/2/2017,"I had a rather farcical experience here the other day for lunch. A friend and I have come here for lunch a couple times before and, though I don't recall it being terribly memorable, it was fine. This time could only be described as a comedy of errors. I ordered the tuna melt with the tomatoes on the side (I prefer them with the salad rather than on the sandwich) and the twice baked potato instead of fries. I'm not normally a customer with specific requests, but these were easy enough and the server said they were no problem. My friend ordered a salad. After waiting a half hour for our food to arrive, we asked about it. It came out about 5 minutes later. The tomatoes were on the sandwich, which was ice cold (and very small for the price). They said the potato would be there soon. I was able to remove the tomato from the sandwich easily enough, but I was almost done with the sandwich before the potato arrived. And it was not at all what I expected. A twice baked potato is a baked potato that has been split, its inside mashed, but back into the skin and browned in the oven. This was a small scoop of mashed potatoes with some cheese melted on it...no skin. Oh well. My friend touted the cherry cobbler, so I lived dangerously and ordered it with ice cream. It came out ice cold with no ice cream, but whipped cream. It was all so ridiculous at this point that I gave up and started eating it until the server came over and asked how it was. I said it was practically frozen it was so cold and then she noticed it had no ice cream. She took it back to the kitchen. It came back lukewarm with ice cream. It was very tasty, but the accumulated mess ups had certainly put a damper on the meal. What was truly annoying though, is, after all the mistakes and having to wait for things, nothing was comped. I found this truly cheap and terrible customer service. Dessert, at least, should have been comped. And there wasn't much of an apology either. It's too bad. The food is tasty, but with service like this, I'll go elsewhere.",1,,

The omelet itself is almost paper thin, and folded perfectly around the evenly distributed fillings you have chosen. Everything is so delicate, you don't get unruly chunks of meat, and I swear they must grow miniature broccoli florets for the sole purpose of having them fit so neatly in this dish. As an added bonus- the omelets come with a side of cheesey potatoes. You are welcome.There is an affiliated bagel store down the block that is wonderful. They offer an assortment of gluten free items (including bagels and coffee cake), and have some really stellar chicken and tuna salad. Pricey, yes, but for the neighborhood a relatively great value considering how high quality everything is, and how amenable and informed the staff is about food allergies.",1,,

But good did take a few extra minutes. They ran out of one beer and instead of bringing the menu to ask which substitution, the waiter kept bringing back random beers asking if we wanted it. Weird!  But the hostess, is a great. She is quick on her feet and fixes all the problems.",,,

I usually get some sort of sandwich or a burger. Their regular burgers and their turkey burgers are very good. They have a tomato-and-basil side dish that is absolutely delicious.  Tasty desserts.I agree with other Yelpers that the service often leaves something to be desired. With the last waitress that I had, it was very hard to get her attention-I don't really like to be craning my neck & looking all around the room trying to find her.  However, the hostess Juliette is lovely and warm and always provides excellent service!Definitely a decent lunch and it's usually not terribly crowded, which is nice.",2,,

Except only one was actually making food for the orders.  I then watched 3 people who ordered after me get their orders.  I made eye contact with the woman who took my order at least 5 times, each time making more pleading faces like ""how are you not checking in on this?""  Finally, 9 minutes after I ordered, I see the guy finally start on my order.  Once he finished, he put it on the counter, because apparently he cannot give it to me.  I watch the other 4 individuals proceed to ignore my order (along with a couple others that were sitting there); instead; they were playing on phones, reorganizing the scones, and fiddling with the coffee machines.  I finally said ""hi, I've been waiting 10 minutes for just a bagel..."" And someone finally notices the pile and gives me my order.  No acknowledgement of what I had said regarding the timing.  I will never be back here and recommend to others to go anywhere else.  Even if the bagels were better than average (I don't think they are), waiting for 10+ minutes for just a bagel sandwich is absolutely unacceptable in this city.",,,

Updated review","First time. Hostess/server was uninviting. Chose not to communicate to my server my COFFEE order at BRUNCH ...when practically empty?? Previous reviews are still current. Good product but service is lacking minimizing repeat business. Shame. Juliette, the manager was helpful and took care of the check. Unexpected and appreciated, but I really hope they change some of the staff...you're killing our experience! Are the owners aware?Dont know what your title is Paul, but you sound like the ignorant owner/general manager.  1. Do you dismiss every customer's review like this? 2. The account you gave was not truthful, as communicated to you by your sub par employees...but that won't matter to you I'm sure.  Based on me seeing many other negative reviews about your little place, dating months back, it's clear you are living in a bubble and wish to stay there.  Also, what's the minimum amount of menu items one has to order as to get semi-decent service?? No point in going back to experience the same lousy service, since no one is taking responsibility.  No wonder you're losing repeat business. Shame. I'll be VERY surprised to see you still open in the future. Good luck",1,1,

I always have high hopes for whatever red velvet cupcake I eat, but these tasted like they were out for hours as did all of the other baked goods I've eaten here (except the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, but that was packaged).

But before we were seated, my wife almost took a header slipping on a floor tile. There was no spill - the tile was just grimy, the way a ceramic tile gets when it's covered with dirt and grease. Do they not wash the floors?The bathroom, too - very often quite dirty. What gives? If these were isolated incidents, then fine, but there's a pattern of unnecessary dirtiness ...Anyway, it sounds like I'm complaining, so then why four stars?Because most of the time, most of their stuff is excellent!Look, I'll take Corner Cafe with all of its lumps.THE BAKERY:On the northern corner of the block is the bakery. If you go to the restaurant, you HAVE to visit the bakery, if only for the cute stuff usually hanging from the ceiling. The baked goods here are top-notch.

The table we were seated at had spilled coffee on the paper cover and the glasses had pepper in them. Underneath the table were dirty napkins, sugar packets and food. I just sat down thinking, ""maybe the food would be good."" I ordered the omelette with 3 fillings and I chose ham, cheese and onions. My boyfriend ordered the french toast with bananas. When we received our order of food, we still hadn't received our drink order. Both of our water glasses were empty. When we asked where our drinks were, she replied with, ""oh i forgot."" It took another 5 minutes for her to deliver our drinks. When we finally started to eat I realized they forgot the ham in my omelette. I noticed our waitress wasn't anywhere to be found after waiting 5 minutes and eating everything else on my plate. Finally I told the hostess about the lack of ham and I just asked her to get me a piece of ham cut up and I would put it in my omelette. I waited another 10 minutes for my ham before I decided to say something to the waitress. She said the hostess never told her about my ham order. By the time I got the ham the omelette was cold AND the ham was cold. I sat there the rest of the meal eating without any water or tea (which I had asked for a refill before the ham). This is the 3rd time I had been to this place. The first time, my boyfriend found a fly in his salad. The second time the waitress forgot my drink order and completely messed up my pancake order. And now this. If you do go to this place, do not sit down until you know who is serving you. The blonde waitress (she's been there for 2 years) is the WORST waitress I have ever had. After all this, I had to ask to have my meal for free. Who wants to eat their omelette cold?This place has terrible service, cold food and a dirty atmosphere.",4,4,1

Updated review","So now that I go to write this update, I realized my original review was for the bakery rather than the restaurant---my apologies.If you ever go, try to calculate the average age--it really feels like an old age home's cafeteria, the average age is so old.  As a matter of fact, I know Joan Hamburg on WOR AM radio talks about it---and well, chances are you, dear YELPER haven't heard of her.  Know why?  Cause you're not of the age group who listens to her show---I happen to know as my father used to listen to her.  Groups from the 92nd St Y like to come here after lectures.Anyway, my entire family has gone to The Corner Cafe and Bakery a number of times for dessert only.  The food is very American and as I said, reminds me of something they'd serve at a home for the aged.  Nonetheless, if you'd like a slice of pie or cake to celebrate an anniversary or birthday, this is a nice place in this area.  The brownie pie is pretty amazing!  $6.25 a slice.There's a unisex accessible restroom kind of makes me feel uncomfortable.  Since there's no corridor, the restroom is kind of right there in the restaurant--between the kitchen and the waiter's station.",4,3,3
191,D M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,37,4,4.0,11/16/2012,"Great neighborhood eatery that provides vast salad and sandwich options for reasonable (under $15) prices.  Also offers more traditional dinner entrees.  I really like the open faced tuna melt.  Service is always great and fast, and the place is quiet so you can have nice table conversation.  Great for lunch or dinner.",,,
192,Kyle S.,"Portland, OR",19,97,0,4.0,3/15/2010,"FOR THE BAKERYTheir black and white cookies are great. You can taste the vanilla and chocolate in each side of the frosting, which is a good tell-tale sign that the b&w is legit.Their carrot cake is good but not out of this world. I've had a couple cookies from here which were very, very good. I live right down the street so I should buy more stuff from them, but I'm trying to eat healthier. Unfortunately for me, their food is good enough to sway me back over to the dark side.",,1,
193,Diana R.,"Manhattan, NY",74,15,0,3.0,1/27/2013,Good place very cute! I like going during the summer time it feels like a nice little bakery in a small town...only it's in a big city...I love there season decor give it character. The baked goods are ok a little pricey for my taste.,,,
194,Carrie O.,"Manhattan, NY",2,30,0,4.0,11/25/2012,I think they put something in their coffee to make you crave more.  One cup is not enough! Scones and muffins are good.  Get your cupcakes and bagels elsewhere.,,,
195,Allison L.,"New York, NY",21,25,4,5.0,2/16/2010,"It's a cold and snowy winter morning. Restaurant awnings flap in the 40 mph winds. Your UES neighborhood, once a calm and peaceful retreat, transforms into the Arctic tundra before your very eyes. What to do? You dodge slush piles as you hunt for shelter. Starbucks is packed and Duane Reade is, well, boring. You feel like giving up, when, out of nowhere, a magical cloud of sugar tickles your nose and leads you inside Corner Bakery.A little voice in your head convinces you to order a homemade hot chocolate (and I personally could not agree more with that little voice).With just one sip, your winter blues are cured. You feel amazing. You feel like writing a review on YELP.",,1,
196,Ana D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,135,0,5.0,7/6/2014,"We've been here for brunch a couple of times and I have no complaints. The wait is never long. The staff is quick and attentive. The restaurant is nice and clean. It's never too noisy.  It's always easy to make food substitutions and, in general, the food is really good. The biscuit and seasoned potatoes are worth a trip all on their own.",,,
197,Jacqui R.,"Manhattan, NY",8,22,17,4.0,4/19/2012,"Had lunch here on a weekday with my mother and we really enjoyed it. Great food, great service.",,,
198,Gretchen W.,"New York, NY",40,121,7,4.0,2/9/2009,"Formerly called Yura, The Corner Cafe and Bakery is one of my favorite lunch places.  I have been coming here since I was a child and swear by the rare roast beef sandwich with frizzled onions.  Served on an onion roll with a potato and cheese side...Yum!  Another notably good lunch option is the smoked turkey pinwheels, which is a wrap of smoked turkey, tomato, and arugula, cut into small pieces. Good salads and breakfast fare.   I have also had many a good soup, of which there are two made fresh daily.Aside from the sit-down portion of this restaurant is the pick up section, where you can buy salads, soups, mini sandwiches, and very delicious bakery items.  There are a couple small tables where you can eat or just have a coffee and cupcake.I like The Corner Cafe and Bakery (always Yura in my heart) and recommend for a nice brunch/lunch when on the upper east side.",3,2,3
199,John R.,"Forest Hills, NY",2,18,0,2.0,3/6/2013,"I prefer other places in the neighborhood.  Food and service are okay.  It is a few dollars more than competing breakfast spots, but ambiance is not as nice in my view (b/c they cram customers too close to one another).",2,,1
