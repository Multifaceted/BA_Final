Updated review","7/10 I'm updating my review and adding another star - I had a chance to go back and tried the fish and chips as well as a few more items on a market plate. I enjoyed the zucchini and the sweet potato options more than I had other veggies. The fish and chips were very good - not too much batter on the fish. I only wish the fish portion was larger. The fries were even better than the fish. Normally I would be a fan of sweet potato fries over conventional but at Westville the conventional fries are a triumph. 6/10 Westville epitomizes the contemporary New York diner. There Wall St location is very similar to the others, offering a menu with many vegetarian options and a few classic sandwiches and burgers. The food is mostly American with a few touches from other cuisines thrown in. The atmosphere is relaxed and suitable for a dinner with friends or a casual date. The menu is designed around their market plate, with many vegetarian options to choose from. While most options sounded good on paper, I found the veggies to be a bit boring and lacking in flavor. I tried many of the options both dining in and through delivery and none of the veggies left me itching to go back. I've also tried their burger, loaded up with several add-ons (all at additional cost). The burger was quite good and better than any of the veggies I tried (though once you add everything it can be much more expensive than other casual eateries). No issues with the service. I'd recommend eating in vs. delivery",2,,
2,Stephanie C.,"New York, NY",1,29,8,2.0,9/29/2018,"I came here based off of all the positive reviews but I was very disappointed with my meal and service. The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because they accommodated and gave me a side of french fries after I told them I didn't like the potatoes that came with my meal that actually said fries on the menu...not ""home fries"". The potatoes were soggy and bland but the French fries were actually good and crispy. We ordered from the specials menu, breakfast burrito and the country fried chicken eggs Benedict. Both were mediocre at best. The poached eggs were over cooked and the yolk was basically fully cooked. I asked for one thing and that was for no tomatoes. Waiter acknowledged. My meal came with tomatoes...I didn't say anything. I just took them out whatever. Annoying but fine.The food also came out wayyyyyy too fast. Usually fast service is good but our food came out maybe 5 min after we ordered which means it wasn't freshly made, just simply reheated. At least for my chicken which was just warm not hot like fried chicken usually is when it's freshly fried. When we were wrapping up I had leftover chicken and fries and specifically pointed to asked that only the chicken and French fries be wrapped to go. I got home and lo and behold everything I didn't asked to be wrapped was in my to go including the tomatoes which I clearly pulled out of my meal and the potatoes I never pointed to.It's safe to say I will not be going back...",,,
3,William G.,"Torrance, CA",2571,1691,3976,4.0,9/11/2018,"Upon first moving to NYC, I called up some friends who had already moved here from southern California. We agreed to meet here for dinner, which was a short Uber ride from home.When I got here, I noticed that this restaurant is attached to a hotel. After my friends got there, we were seated immediately. I ordered grilled salmon, with a side of broccoli and sweet potato fries. I also ordered an iced latte, which came with three shots of espresso.The staff was decent in their processing time, and the taste was ok. The restaurant was clean, and decor was bright. The restrooms are located through a set of double doors that lead to the hotel, and down a flight of steps that lead to an underground lounge area for hotel guests.It was a nice experience dining here, and it was great to catch up with old friends.",17,11,17
4,Amy F.,"New York, NY",101,63,641,4.0,9/1/2018,"Came on a Saturday around 12:30 with no wait (however it's Labor Day weekend) and ordered off their brunch specials menu. Honestly difficult to decide on what to choose because they all seemed good. I opted for the Breakfast Burrito that had chorizo, cheese, egg wrapped in a flour tortilla with avocado on top. The dishes came out quickly. Westville has generous portions for what you pay, and I essentially licked the plate clean! The burrito was good, but nothing spectacular... I think Westville is the place to go if you're not trying to spend more than $20 on a meal, seeking healthy and simple options, and desiring a casual atmosphere with friends. Value and portions done right.",2,1,1
5,Su C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,66,188,4.0,11/14/2018,"Very low key diner type of restaurant in wall street filled with locals. Our server was great. We got all brunch items, like egg benedict, frittata, breakfast burrito and waffles. Also finished with their chocolate molten cakes. They were all fantastic.",,,
6,Anne R.,"New York, NY",839,445,5141,5.0,10/10/2018,"What is this?  Healthy and inexpensive food near Wall St?!  Thank you Westville, for brightening up the soul sucking financial district with some foodie love and good eats that don't require a hedge-fund to indulge in.  You've always had New Yorker's tummies in your hearts.",4,2,4
7,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,3.0,9/2/2018,"I appreciate the concept in offerings that consist of nutritional ingredients and supposed to be tasty but healthy... but the execution here needs fine tuning. The dishes were either too much or too little in flavors. Tried the market plate which allowed 4 choices of the market vegetables . 1) brussels sprouts with honey dijon - flavorful but saucy; some pieces were too tangy2) roasted cauliflower w tahini - probably my favorite of the market veggies. The tahini sauce was light and complemented the gently charred cauliflower 3) warm lentil salad with carrots, onions & celery - I like lentils and was thankful this was not a heavy dish.. flavors were subtle even with the mix of veggies4) sweet potato fries - texture was ok. Not very crisp but at least not soggy. A bit bland.. it's so hard to find decent sweet potato fries.Also tried the kale salad with raw kale, marinated onions, blue cheese, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, roasted walnuts & lemon olive oil ; for an extra charge, got the breaded chicken cutlet . The base itself was good and almost a requisite to get in key vitamins and good fats. Was hoping the indulge in the fried chicken but the chicken didn't add much to the flavor of the salad. Would've been better off eating the salad plain or perhaps try chances with a different topping for added flavor and protein. Happened to visit on a day where at least 3 different families brought their babies/kids who were rowdy and had pipes that could break glass. Must've been a full moon. Unfortunately I think a lot of patrons rushed out because the acoustics seemed to echo the screeching and clanking making the noise very intolerable",,,
8,Lana T.,"Financial District, NY",350,323,139,3.0,9/26/2018,"Westville in FiDi was something the neighborhood needed.  I have been a huge fan of their other branches in the city, and the quality and freshness of the food is great.Venue (3/5) the seating area has plenty of room.  It's a casual setting that is great for small and large groups, casual dates, familiesFood (3/5) mushroom plate (4/5) fresh and so good.  I love mushrooms and this did not disappoint Chicken strips (2/5) was cold and not prepared well.  We sent it back and it was sent back even colder.Service (0/5) upon arrival the hostess told us to take a seat on the side.  Which we did.  She then proceeded to let her friends grab a table, check herself out a few times, then let a few other people that arrived after us sit.  When I asked if we would get a table she said 'how would she know if we sat close to the delivery desk that she was supposed to seat us, she assumed we were waiting for delivery (yet that is where she told us to sit).Also on the night we went there was only 2 servers and the restaurant was full.  The waiter ensured to tell us he was overwhelmed and there is not much we can do but be patient.  I feel for him, he was put in a bad spot.",1,,
9,Sharon L.,"New York, NY",191,105,162,2.0,9/25/2018,"I have dined at Westville in the East Village, which I loved. This establishment just doesn't measure up. I was so excited when they opened this one downtown closer to my apt, because I loved the veggie platters I had at a different location. I ordered both delivery from here as well as dined in on two separate occasions. Here's my veggie experience: the beets are inconsistent - either dry/hard cubes, or juicy chunks. The artichokes & parm could not be more bland. Overly salty. Kale with pumpkin seeds are ok, and cauliflower with tahini are consistently decent. When I had veggies ordered though delivery, they came soggy and lukewarm in a plastic takeout container. I ended up having a few bites of each veggie and did not retain the leftovers bc of how unappetizing they looked. The dine in experience itself was fine. Service was pleasant. There was a cinnamon & honey tea I ordered which was actually delicious. I'd certainly recommend ordering that as the weather cools down this fall/winter.",,,
10,andrea p.,"New York, NY",347,450,859,4.0,11/5/2018,Except for the noise level and the not always friendly waiters I find this place good . The food is on the healthy side and the menu is interesting in its combinations of options .,,1,
11,Alyssa R.,"Brooklyn, NY",652,1112,2733,4.0,1/30/2018,"3.5ish with potential to be a 4 so I'm rounding up... While downtown last week - the galfriends and I stopped by Westville for some dinner.  The restaurant is on the smaller side w/ mostly tables for two soooo our group of three had to wait a bit... like 45 minutes.   If it wasn't so cold we probably would have started walking again but the hostess was sympathetic and offered us a round of drinks on the house - so that was great.  But we were so hungry after such a long wait! When we finally got to a table we didn't waste any time ordering - we ordered a ton but the items below are the only ones I got to try: chicken tenders (with hot buffalo sauce & mixed greens, fries are $1 more) - two of us ordered these tenders so we got to try both the mixed greens and the fries.  If you can handle the extra $1 than go w/ the fries.  The salad was so soggy I couldn't finish half of it.  And therefore snuck fries from my friends plate the whole meal.  The chicken tenders tho - are probably some of the best chicken tenders I've ever had and its all thanks to the super crunchy crust on the outside. SO GOOD.  Three good sized tenders come w/ the meal - but I could have easily eaten a basket.smoky mac & cheese (with bacon for an extra $1) - YUM!  We determined after the first bite that smoky must mean 'smoked gouda' b/c this mac was creamy and smoky and really good!  The dish is enough to share if you're looking for a few bites... but could also easily be eated as a meal on your own. Asparagus (with parm cheese) - the parm cheese is the powdery stuff... which is fine.  The asparagus was pretty good though and cooked up nicely.Sweet potato fries - sad sad sweet potato fries.  The portion that comes as a 'side' was smaller than the portion that came w/ our chicken tenders.  And they were very basic.  I ended up dunking them in my hot sauce to pump up their flavor a bit.Green beans (with a soy glaze) - these were good!  The beans had a great bite to them, and that glaze drizzled over the top - yum!  I found myself trying to get as much glaze as I could on each bite of bean. It should also be noted that our waitress was super sweet and personable.  And the restaurant does have a great casual cool vibe - even if it is a bit small.",9,5,6
12,Corrine B.,"Enfield, CT",4,52,64,5.0,3/3/2018,"We'd passed Westville on Wall Street a few times, my husband promising me we'd stop in for dinner on one of our many trips to the city. I was quite excited, seeing that there were so many lovely-sounding veggie options. So when we ended up back in FiDi looking for a nearby place to dine, off we went to Westville.It was a little early on a Friday night, so we got a lovely corner table easily. The lowered lighting and little lit votives on each table set off a comfortable, sweet atmosphere. The servers were attentive and friendly (my husband, adorable clod, knocked his cutlery on the floor and someone was right there in seconds to snap it up and give him a fresh set).Faced with so many veggie options in the Westville Market menu section, I could barely choose...so I got four: asparagus with parmesan, brussels sprouts with honey dijon, butternut squash, and sauteed kale. My husband ordered the breaded chicken cutlet with 2 market sides: garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.Oh, I almost forgot! We started with sharing a giant plate of sweet potato fries, perfectly cooked. YUM. Then our plates arrived, and I din't know how I'd ever eat all those vegetable (that'll teach me to order apps). However, everything was delicious! My four sides were scrumptious in different ways, with four distinct flavors and textures, yet all complimenting one another. I loved the crispness of my asparagus, but my husband thought his green beans were a bit too crisp (I blame a childhood of overcooked vegetables, as it's taken me forever to get him to appreciate a firmer steamed veggie) and the cutlets a tad dry. But he still declared everything ""very good"" and that he'd come again. We were so full, we skipped dessert and instead took a walk down by the river. Next time, we'll leave room for a little ice cream.All in all, a delightful and affordable evening!",,,1
13,Hector V.,"Washington, DC",132,57,86,5.0,1/14/2018,"TL;DR Healthy, quick, budget friendly meals!So I've been to other Westville locations across the city, but this was my first time at their Wall Street location. As always, the staff was pleasant and the food was tasty. I ordered the Greek salad with grilled chicken while my wife got the chilaquiles. Our portions were sizable but super tasty. Westville is always a great option!",,,
14,Deanne N.,"New York, NY",71,123,62,4.0,9/5/2018,"Went here for an early dinner. I liked their menu because they offer a lot of veggies sides. I ordered a marketplace with three different types of veggies and a grilled chicken sandwich. I liked both of my dishes esp the chicken sandwich. It was crispy and flavorful. I came back here the second time and got a cheeseburger as recommended by one of the servers, it was meh, didn't live up to my expectations. Lack of flavors and dry. I will definitely come back here for the chicken sandwich since it's only a couple of blocks from me, but I don't want to ever order their burger again.",,,
15,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,310,372,4.0,11/1/2017,"Met up with my friends here for a dinner. He made a reservation here but on a Wednesday night around 6:30PM, it seems like it isn't necessary - but you definitely have that option! The seating area was clean and of the usual size. It didn't feel cramped and it held a very casual feel to it. The wait staff was patient as we deliberated our order and never once rushed us. I ordered the salmon while the others ordered a special which included a salmon and the trout. My two market vegetables included the walnuts with walnuts (so happy I didn't have to include the goat cheese since I'm NOT A FAN.. but you have the option of adding both) and zucchini with tomatoes and mozzarella. We also had a side of fries which were made deliciously. It was crispy and hot when it came out. PERFECT. The main course came out in a timely fashion as well and I think the food was excellent. The whole plate was perfectly portioned for myself - with enough vegetables and protein. I loved it. And while eating, it was a good atmosphere to just catch up and chat. And when we got the bill, the wait staff was patient to give us time to calculate our individual costs so they can charge all our cards a different price. The staff was courteous and I never once felt rushed to leave. Definitely recommend.",2,2,2
16,Urszula P.,"Manhattan, NY",57,151,472,4.0,10/15/2017,"This is a great place for large groups because it's not the busiest location of the Westville's. The food is quality as always. I've visited the Chelsea location several times.I loved my brussel sprouts, sausage, and egg bowl. My friend was also pleased with her challah toast and yucca fries. The drinks are also worth a try. I tried the berry with bourbon",2,,
17,Jeff R.,"Holmdel Township, NJ",45,36,19,5.0,11/8/2018,"This is my go to place when I work late and need to wait until my ferry gets in. Been here on 3-4 occasions and always got a seat at the bar on a weekday. Bartenders are always responsive and engaging. I was worried about Westville when they first opened just because of the location at the bottom of Wall Street. Not really a NYC destination. But they know what they're doing as they have multiple locales in the city and the food is always consistently good. Had a couple martinis and the fish and chips tonight. Fish was fresh and was prepared very nicely. A nice tartar sauce for dipping the crispy fish, and a refreshing coleslaw. Was moderately busy for a Thursday night which I was happy to see. Would love to try some of the vegan dishes that it seems they specialize in (although they have plenty of meat eater dishes too).  Food comes out quickly which I appreciated since I was on a schedule. Conveniently located right adjacent to the Pier 11 ferry terminal. Pop in for a cocktail and meal- they won't disappoint.",,,
18,Mark S.,"WALL STREET, NY",4,149,502,4.0,4/30/2018,I  have omly been herer for breakfast and it is quite good. The potato hash is over the top good. I also recommend the portogese bread is excellent. Arrive early iit gets very crowded,,,
19,Aura B.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",228,540,5341,5.0,2/1/2018,"After walking around South Street Seaport looking at the open Light Art exhibition, this was an excellent place to stop at eat something. For a Wednesday night it was full of people, good sign. As me and my BFF walked in, we were seated right away no reservation needed Yeahhh !!!. The essence of this place is romantic and cool one of a kind perfectly mixed. And an excellent place to drink or eat with friends, families, or loved ones. The candles decoration I really, really loved in all the tables, give it a higher touch of spirituality to the place.The Steak Chimicurri was good, it is not served with bread though as I was used to always have a chimichurri in a sandwich style, this one is served on a dish.",3,3,3
20,Michelle L.,"Queens, New York, NY",309,131,114,5.0,3/1/2018,"Westville is a popular restaurant in the Wall Street area well known for their healthy cuisine and market vegetables. You can always find it packed during lunch time. I made reservations the same day I had dinner here. I ordered a cosmo, pit-za and the Winter Salad. Both the cosmo and pit-za are part of their happy hour menu (4pm - 8pm). The cosmo was good. It reminded me of an adult pink lemonade because of the smell and color. The pit-za was okay. It was cheese, tomato and basil on pita bread. Honestly not too exciting and wouldn't recommend it. The Winter Salad was off their dinner specials and I was surprised how big the portion was. The salad has blackened chicken, sweet potato, green beans, Brussels sprouts, blue cheese and more. It also came with corn bread. The salad was delicious! Not only was it healthy and filling, I didn't feel guilty eating it. I definitely would recommend it. Overall it was a great experience. The staff was super friendly and very helpful too. I will be coming back here.Pro Tip: Definitely make reservations ahead of time. The restaurant gets really busy. Also the restaurant isn't ideal for large parties of 4+ in my opinion. Tables are quite close to each other making it difficult to move around in the restaurant.",1,,1
21,Sierra S.,"San Diego, CA",161,9,5,5.0,10/19/2018,"Stopped by Westville the other day for lunch! I ordered the hamburger and my friend ordered the chicken cutlet plate.

Will definitely be coming back!",,,
22,Amrisa B.,"Hollis, NY",339,149,174,4.0,7/10/2018,I've never been but have ordered from here a couple of times. The food is really fresh and always delivered on time. I love their crispy fish sandwich! It's a really filling lunch and you get your money's worth of quality food.,1,,
23,Roxana F.,"New York, NY",70,202,21,3.0,7/12/2018,"This place is fine, but I'm a little disappointed. I ordered the egg scramble plate which comes with a salad. The scramble was fine and they even offer gluten free bread at no extra charge, which made me happy. However, the salad was inedible. It was a good size portion of mixed greens for a side salad but full of old pieces of lettuce that stuck to each other and as much as I tried to clear away the old pieces I would find new ones. This put me off and was pretty unappetizing so I gave up. For a place that is known for their quality veggie dishes, I found this strange. I could have paid extra for another side but I wanted some veggies so pretty disappointed.",,,1

There is a wait for tables around this time (1-2 pm ) however after 2 it settles down and is a bit quieter. I had the tenders with buffalo sauce which is good for one person or it can be shared.

Menu's similar like the other locations, I had 4 grilled veggies like I normally do, consistent w flavor and buttery, my buddy had quinoa burger which is not my thing but he likes it, sweet potato fries are addictive! Friendly service, tables are a bit tight so you'll be elbowing your neighbor tables! Bathroom is located at the building's basement which can be hard to find.

They have a small discounted lunch menu consisting of bowls, snacks and drinks. They have select beer for about 5 dollars during lunch and Pinot Grigio for $6. All their menu options are very fresh, healthy and delicious. The Greek salad is my ultimate fave, but all the salads are super tasty. Also, the price point is great.

It was also not busy at 10 am so that was nice! We ordered coffee first. I got a latte. My friends got a cappuccinos,  espresso etc.The wait for the coffee was long about 30 which was kind of nuts. They did keep us updated but still. It was 10 am on a Saturday i needed my coffee! The latte was super good, I was able to get it with almond milk. I ordered the veggie burger. I was so happy with all the vegetarian options! It made it hard to choose. It took a long time for them to bring out the food too. About 20 to 25 minutes. But it was well worth it. The veggie burger was so flavorful and moist. The sweet potato fries were amazing as well. The burger was difficult to keep together and very messy to eat! But I would get it again. My one friend got the mashed potatoes and they were amazing! The only con was the long long wait time which was annoying. But other than that it tasted great.",1,,2

Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things?I ordered the almond encrusted trout and it was sub-par especially when each bite consisted of bones. Service was good though. Just a normal restaurant with nothing special.,1,,
31,Brandon E.,"Atlantic Highlands, NJ",301,494,192,4.0,10/17/2017,"This is an awesome new addition to FiDi, especially given it's next door to my office. I have dined in a couple times but mostly I rock to-go. They are always quick, friendly and the food is excellent.They have this buttermilk chicken sandwich, that is just amazeballs. Their fries are also delicious and always cooked to perfection. I have gotten the chicken burger which is also very good. To be honest I haven't had anything bad here yet. Sometimes it gets a little too crazy, which is expected when there are few decent sit down joints around. Take out is pretty quick, especially if you order online. What I really like is the flavored iced tea and water they offer you while you wait. I just wish there was more space to wait for your food, I always feel like I am in the way.Overall, a pretty nice spot downtown. Give it a try.",1,,1
32,Winnie T.,"Westfield, NJ",57,83,45,4.0,10/7/2017,Love this food. It's really healthy and fresh. Prices are very reasonable too. One good thing is that this is one of the cheapest sit down restaurants in the area. Will definitely return often. Service very friendly,1,,1

I highly recommend ordering at least one (or four) of their seasonal market vegetables. Meat lovers will also find plenty of options on the menu (the braised beef hash is one of my favorites). This is also one of the only places I've been to that serves Portuguese muffins - basically a lighter, fluffier and more delicious version of English muffins.",1,,
34,Cinthia K.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",227,637,296,3.0,3/16/2018,"This was the first Westville location I had visited and it confirmed my suspicions of what they all would be like more or less: higher-end diner-style offerings, with this particular location mostly being solicited by basic finance/advertising bros and gals. Came here with a friend after work for dinner. Place was still packed, even on a random weekday evening. Everything about the place was perfectly fine, and my veggie burger was pretty good, though I couldn't help but feel like this place was too sterile and a tad too soulless. Would probably swing by here again as I work in the area, but I think I'm more apt to travel to other neighborhoods to get food instead.",1,2,1

It's right by the river and it is pretty secluded so it feels like a private dining area with a view of the water.Came here with a group of 8 and they accommodated us right away. Not much to say about food that hasn't been said about Westville already. I'm a huge fan of the market plate and I think even if you aren't a huge veggie lover, you'll love the plate.",2,1,1

Please either look for Chris, Oscar or the tall bald guy I think his name is Pablo or something like that. This market plate I had ( plate of 4 mixed vegetables ). I had roasted artichokes with parmesan, Brussels sprouts with honey Dijon, tofu and crispy hash browns. It was the best mix of healthy, glutenous, satisfying and fulling that I have ever tried. And don't get me started on the drinks. I had a French Martini to die for. I also tried to stump Chris asking him for a broken negroni and he knew what it was. I've been to now 4 of their locations but I have found my favorite.",2,,3
38,Justin L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,17,10,3.0,8/15/2018,"I would like to start off this review by saying that normally I would not go to Westville because I'm not really a fan of American food. However, aside from that fact, the food at Westville was meh at best. The reason I say this is because the salmon that you see here was grilled perfectly but it lacked flavor and the broccoli, being a broccoli, didn't really have that much flavor either. So I basically ordered a plate of salmon, broccoli and artichoke just for it to all taste bland and meh. And for $19, I don't think I would order this had it not been expensed by my last company. To be completely honest, I would order anything here if I were to choose a location because everything is really overpriced. But there is a silver lining to all of this though. The truffle parm fries were actually pretty damn good. But $8 for fries? IDK. If you like this kind of food, you might have different opinions of their food but I'm being completely honest from someone who doesn't eat American food normally.",,,

They were definitely accommodating and organized on taking everyone's order. I tried the veggie burger and it was great! Definitely filling and then everyone decided to surprise me with a pie, I'm not sure what it was called, but it had Oreo crust and layers of cheesecake and chocolate mousse. I couldn't put the spoon down! Great place, good vibes, awesome customer service!",,,

We came on a Sunday around peak brunch hours and were seated within a minute. The outdoor seating and view of the seaport is nice if not a bit close together to all other tables (could hear the conversation of basically everyone bordering us). I ordered a custom omelette and my boyfriend had the breakfast burrito. They were both very reasonably priced (~$15) and very filling, just what we look for in a go-to brunch spot. I'm curious to try some of the other offerings on the menu and will definitely return to this convenient location.",3,1,2
41,Diane K.,"New York, NY",217,108,702,4.0,8/14/2017,"Awesome farm-to-table styled restaurant that is good for weekend brunch. If you are feeling healthy, just pick up some of their fresh veggie selections which they called it ""the Westville Market"". I have ordered online and done take out for the market's vegetables ($15 for 4; I believe if you dine in, it is $17/4 - maybe the portion is bigger?). Anyway, they have: artichokes with parmesan, brussels sprouts with honey dijon, and cauliflower with tahini, just to list a few. The take-out portion was okay, not too big, but the flavors were ON POINT. It's a win-win when you can enjoy healthy food and its taste at the same time. Can't you tell I am not a salad type of person...?Onto the brunch review, my boyfriend and I sat inside when everyone chose to sit outside. It was full/crowded outside for a nice day in August so I wasn't surprised. But we do enjoy the air conditioning when we get a chance. Here in Westville, you can find the typical brunch menu like other restaurants that offer brunch. The price ranges from $10 (For a grilled cheese) to $19 (For a NY strip steak and egg). They had a special brunch menu with some egg benedict options and breakfast burrito. Aaaaaand, those are what we ordered; ""Caprese benedict"" and ""Breakfast burrito"". Both dishes were up to par and fulfilling ($14/each). The baked mozzarella on the english muffin for my benedict was what made me declared that it is one of my favorite benedicts I've tried. Although, the eggs on the benedict weren't ""runny"" which was a bit disappointing but I did not let that go against dish. Also, a new found favorite was the potato hash side on the breakfast burrito. It was basically smashed purple potato with orange/red bell peppers and some great spices (Which I have no idea what they are). We also ordered ""bloody mary"" ($11) but it was on the expensive side for the size...we weren't too crazy about it.Brunch was definitely a good experience and would likely to 'brunch' here again!",1,1,1

I've been here twice, once for take out (order at the counter next to the bar) and sit down. Both times had fast and friendly service. I had market and lunch plates, and a side of salmon. The market plate veggies are all very well done and flavorful and leaves an omnivore like me satisfied. My favorites are: green bean with soy sauce (slightly tough if you prefer more cooked), zucchini with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella, marinated tofu was slightly salty but ok if paired with others in each bite. The cherry tomatoes with basil is also a refreshing choice.Sip some flavored water by the counter for your wait. My friend was on a detox, and was able to get the selections without butter.",,,
45,Steve N.,"New York, NY",97,576,23,4.0,8/26/2017,"My GF recently declared I was uninterested in diners. I'd say Westville is a diner for our times, when we've moved away from club sandwiches and souvlaki platters, and we want reasonable prices, variety, and contemporary cuisine. Westville offers a wide range of choices which the diner can mix and match with perennial and seasonal additions: meats, poultry, fish, vegetables, salads, and drinks. Westville Wall Street is an attractive, pleasant space with some comfortable, uncrowded tables outside, separated nicely from the street and passers-by. I've eaten at Westville West Village and Dumbo, and this is the nicest space of the three. I loved my dinner.

50,Stephanie H.,"New York, NY",136,304,750,4.0,6/24/2017,"Very similar with all the other Westville locations. There was no wait on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, there's seating outside if you want. The sun was just a bit too strong that day, so I had to take refuge in the AC. Overall, the menu is the same. I had the market plate with 2x roasted artichokes (I LOVE ARTICHOKES and they give you a generous portion of it); seared tofu; and summer quinoa with pineapple and mango. The quinoa dish could've used more mango/pineapple or some sort of light dressing, because it was quite bland and there was one piece of mango the size of my pinky nail and two pieces of pineapple. My boyfriend ordered the crab cake sandwich with avocado and sunny side egg with fries. This was by far the best option because the avocado and runny yolk added so much creaminess to the crabcake. The fries are also amazingly crispy throughout the meal. It never got soggy and I have no idea how they got that crisp on it, but they were awesome. I'll probably sub one of my market plate selections next time for fries! The only downside to this location is the bathroom. I didn't go because my boyfriend said it's a journey to get to and was really really messy. There's a sign that says it's managed by the building so if it's messy to let them know. I'm a germaphobe, so I didn't want to be anywhere near it or see it at all.",1,,

The patty was pretty thick as well so even though it's a bit pricey for a turkey burger, it's worth it! I got mine with fries and they also came out well.

58,Tracy C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",16,15,6,5.0,6/29/2018,A very reliable restaurant for brunch in the neighbourhood. There are lots of vegetarian options and everything is well seasoned.

59,E W.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,5.0,7/21/2018,"I love Westville so much. The portions are more than enough for what you pay, and most things on the menu are amazing. Everything is always super fresh and seasoned perfectly. I lived pretty much across the street from here for the past 3 years and at this point, I've tried most vegetarian options on the menu.Here's what I'd recommend:- Mac and cheese. This is my to-die-for guilty pleasure food. It's incredible. Creamy, smoky gouda sauce with a thick layer of cheese all perfectly melted on top.- Vegan Hot Dogs - It's so rare to find any place that will serve vegetarian hot dogs - I'd recommend ordering the special with grilled onions and cheddar cheese.- Veggie Chilli - perfect during cold weather, and perfect in your room with the AC blasting ;) this is enough chili to fill me up for dinner, and I always add cheddar cheese. They add enough for it to melt into a huge glob in the middle of the chili and it's delicious.- Grilled Cheese - Again, I love smoked gouda and this grilled cheese is so yum. I don't order this option that much because the mac and cheese is cheaper and better, but if you're craving grilled cheese, this one is cheesy and comforting.- Fish and Chips - I'd only recommend eating this one in the restaurant because anything fried is going to end up soggy by the time it gets to you. Ask for malt vinegar and put it all over everything - nothing can beat British fish and chips but Westville gets pretty close. - Scramble Plate ( catch it before 11am!) - this is always a great option, Westville scrambled eggs are perfectly cooked and seasoned and you can add whichever toppings you want. It's a great breakfast. If you get it before 11 it's $6, and after 11 it's $10, even tho the portion size is def the same.- Avocado Toast - I looooove getting this one with scrambled eggs, they put sriracha all over it and it's so good. Only complaint is that when deliveries are late it sucks because cold eggs are really not ideal.- Fries - Really good but so much better in the restaurant- Any crumble, I've had peach and raspberry and both were so good I wish I had a supply of them in my house. The crumble tastes like an English flapjack and the jam at the bottom is really flavorful. Love.- Veggie Burger - I don't get this one often bc for some reason I just don't crave burgers, but I've had this a few times and it's great esp with the add ons. I like adding mozzarella and avocado, or sometimes a fried egg. The sweet potato fries are also a great side.Look out for these specials:- Mexican Rice Bowl - soooooooo goooood I wish they had this everyday! The portion is HUGE and the meal is hearty and delicious. It's rice and beans with pico de gallo, avocado, and grilled peppers. - Israeli Chopped Salad - I hate salads but this is by far my favorite salad of any place ever. I'm a massive halloumi fan and this is basically a fair amount of lettuce with TONS of halloumi cubes and pita chips on top. It's the only salad where I can actually eat the whole thing without feeling bored of it.Don't get:The polenta cakes - these were so boring I hated them. Arugula and Parmigiano Salad - again, a really boring option. Just arugula basically.Marinated Tofu - this is a market side and it's soooo unbelievably salty, I could never really eat much of it the couple of times I ordered it. Mexican Mac and Cheese - not good at all. Who wants corn in their mac and cheese? Don't ruin a good thing.",,,
60,Julia S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",38,148,145,5.0,6/25/2017,"Nice experience.

From 4 to 8 pm they have happy hour, we ordered a draft beer for 5 and a cosmo for 7. The place seems to be famous for its fresh vegetables.

Everything was super delicious. The salmon was grilled perfectly; I loved the charred skin and the flavor it added. The mac&cheese wasn't the best of the best in NYC, but it was still pretty darn good... especially when the cheese is burnt at the top. Westville is just great comfort, homecooking type of food. I will definitely be returning because I'm too lazy too cook... or at least my cooking won't be as good.Everything was Togo so I didn't get to sit-down and experience the environment.

It's nice because it's so close to my apartment but sadly I think today is our last  visit. I'm not sure why they got ride of the outdoor seating? Today when we ordered at brunch, we ordered drinks, then took a bit to look at specials/decide on food. When we did finally order food, it came out within the minute...I'm not sure if it's sitting under heating lights or what but I'd think it takes longer to poach an egg then it took to get our food. The California Benedict is good, the potato cake it comes on is a fun twist...the brunch bowl was ok, lotssss of rice and not as many vegetables, but definitely fresh tasting! We were planning on getting a couple drinks and having a leisurely brunch, but our first drink didn't come out until we were pretty much done with our food...so we decided to head down to the seaport for a drink.

Then I went in recently to get another awesome dirty martini and the dude (who I will not describe cause that would be crappy) hands me a half full martini glass, which sucks when you're paying $14 for a martini. The martini was not great (I thought that perhaps there was too much vermouth but the bartender said there was no vermouth at all so I have no idea what went wrong). Anyway, if you're a business charging $14 for a drink, FILL the glass cause I know there was $.85 cents worth of titos in that drink! And if you want a dirty martini here, ask the tall bald guy. PS.

88,Edward K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,88,6,4.0,9/18/2017,"Really so great, just the noise level inside is too much, but that just proves they are good and crowded. I have the fish and chips. Fish fingers thick and delicious tartar sauce. Fries double cooked and crispy/soft. Coleslaw great! no sweet, but creamy and plentiful. Try the cucumber lemonade, really delicious and refreshing, healthy. Unfortunately they had sold out of the heaven cake that I wanted, but good news is that I get to return and try more of the menu! All staff were very friendly too, that's a big bonus in my book.",,,
89,Daniel Z.,"Ithaca, NY",0,95,14,4.0,6/11/2017,"Came for brunch. Restaurant is very reasonable priced at 10-15 dollars for the usual brunch fare, but lower for simple items like granola or bagels. Was very satisfied with the portion size, quality of ingredients and overall flavor profile. I don't think it's killer good food, but it's damn tasty. I recommend the eggs scramble or the cheese sandwich.",1,,1
90,Marie M.,"Bronx, NY",3,4,0,5.0,8/30/2017,"A 4.5 rating would be mpre accurate, their food is great and the service is pretty good. The market vegetables are amazing especially the cauliflower with tahini and the plantains. I've had the turkey burger once, which was a little too thick for my liking but otherwise good. Try the desserts while you're there the banana nutella whoopie pies are delicious and the rhubarb pie is the BEST!",,,
91,Shiri A.,"Manhattan, NY",23,3,0,5.0,8/28/2017,"This is a great location!It's spaces and kids friendly, many options for them on the menu (they loved the hamburger) I ordered kale salad with salmon which was yummy.Too bad it's close to my husbands work, as he stops there to get a pastry almost every afternoon...",,,
92,Liron G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,10,5.0,8/28/2017,"One word: YUM!!Westville Wall Street is a treat like all other westvilles. I took my parents there for dinner and we were seated quickly with a smile even though I had my giant stroller with me :) the food was delicious, fresh market veggies, thick juicy hamburger, prefect crispy fries and the best veggie burger in town!I never skip dessert when I go to westville since they're always amazing. Super fresh and baked to perfection (we had the most decadent chocolate soufflé )Bottom line- great location, friendly efficient service and something yummy in my tummy meal",,,
93,Claudia S.,"Baltimore, MD",29,2,0,5.0,6/3/2017,"I'm so glad Westville now has a location in Wall Street. The food is delicious, satisfying and healthy. Service was swift and friendly.",1,,
94,Ella K.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",0,33,7,1.0,7/22/2017,"*sigh.. I really tried.. I was very patient.. there service has been consistently HORRIBLE. Consistently LACKING. It sucks because I really like their food. First couple of times it was the excruciating wait. More than a couple of times my delivery or pickup order was missing/incorrect. Everyone has a nice smile but it's empty and short lived. !! I just remember my first time.. I ordered herbal tea, let's say around. $5, and the waiter was so confused. The drink was on the menu... he gave me hot water, cinnamon stick and lemon.... $5.... er. and it took him almost 15 minutes (business was slow then). Train your staff, you have so many. Many of the staff wouldn't be needed if they were trained properly... with a positive attitude... positives: The bartender was dope and the one guy that knew has drinks, including the drink menu. Also, the delivery guys are sweet. Fish n chips. Blended mint lemonade. Jalapeño margaritas. Oh yeah, what finally prompt me to write this review was the last pick up during a spontaneous rain. I tipped. I left with fish and chips and No tartar sauce and No coleslaw.... what is the point of the fish and chips? Called, put on hold for 2 minutes, and got delivered Coleslaw and some spicy red sauce... called again and spoke to a rude man with a nonchalantly saying, ""what do you want."" I want what I ordered and paid for.Yes, I finally got my tartar sauce with cold fish and chips.. and a ""I'm sorry"" cookie.. thanks.",,,
95,Shannon C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",213,5,0,5.0,8/25/2017,"Went here on my day off and the food was FANTASTIC. The veggie burger they offer is so filling and not to be missed. I shared a market plate with my daughter and we loved the brussel sprouts! Unlike any I have had at other restaurants. We decided to be bad, and got dessert... AND LET ME TELL YOU, that blueberry pie has changed my life. I can't stop dreaming about it. If you are in the neighborhood definitely definitely check this place out.",,,
96,Gracie C.,"Stanford, CA",297,14,9,3.0,7/28/2017,"Came here for dinner on a weekday. We had made a reservation, but it wasn't necessary as there was lots of empty tables. The food was solid but nothing to die for. We got the mac and cheese, market plate (4 sides), and fish and chips. For dessert, we got the carrot cake. I liked that they had so many diverse sides to choose from (all vegetarian), and it would be good a place to go to for dinner for large groups or picky eaters. They have something on the menu for everyone.",,,
97,Terrease A.,"San Francisco, CA",264,5,0,5.0,8/16/2017,Amazing options on the menu to chose from and great choice for a group of friends! Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly staff.,,,
98,Peter R.,"Washington, DC",3,92,0,3.0,11/15/2017,I'm a big fan of Westville but the Wall Street location does not reflect the quality and value of the other locations. I ate breakfast here twice - on the theory that my first disappointing experience was a fluke - and the food was sub-par both times.,,,
99,Olivia B.,"New York, NY",0,91,1,5.0,1/1/2018,Takeout here is always prompt and delicious. The mac and cheese is consistently good and the market plate is the perfect mix of healthy and crave-worthy.,,,
100,Bobby F.,"Lansdale, PA",15,95,4,4.0,11/15/2017,"I was a little surprised by the menu: green beans, broccoli, Brussel sprouts... intriguing. I ordered the iron-skillet turkey burger with the Brussel sprouts on the side. It was very good. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the prices were what I'd expect for a place on Wall St. I've eaten here again, since then, where I ordered the chorizo tacos and a side salad. It, too, was very good. So, no complaints about food, service, or atmosphere, though the simplicity of the place (Dutch design aesthetic) may leave some wanting more. The only complain I had was this: I arrived a little early for lunch, (11:15-ish) and the bus/kitchen staff stood around in the dining room, watching the few of us that were there. I know they were waiting for something to do, but it would be preferable for them to find another location, other than the dining room, in which to congregate. Their lurking presence made for an uncomfortable dining experience.",,,
101,Tallie G.,"Long Island City, NY",543,3,1,5.0,7/24/2017,"I was wandering around the financial discrict area of NYC, which, unless you work making the millies on Wall Street, is pretty much the armpit of the city. Too many tourists and yes, the water is nice, but in the summer it can be packed. So I was down there and was staring to get hungry, and I could really have used a cold alcoholic beverage. Just when I had given up on seeing anything cute and unique down there, lo and behold, this beacon of light with a green W sign appeared. Alright, I thought, they have a chalk sandwich board with a clever phrase (beets don't kale my fries, hilarious), and it was reasonably crowded.I got myself a seat at the bar and was immediately struck by how freindly and attractive the bartenders were. I ordered a cucumber gin based drink and man, that ish was fresh. Really hit the spot in the heat!Then, the menu. I took one glance at all of the market vegetables and my heart exploded with excitement. Finding good vegetarian food can be tough- so many options are bland and boring- but I ordered a plate of four totally delicious market vegetables and was thrilled. They even convinced me that fried plantains are a veggie, so I'll take it! (If you go, eat the fried plantains. They are SO. Good). I had a great time talking to the bartender about Korean horror films, and with a happy stomach and a nice light buzz, carried on my way. Suddenly, the FiDi didn't seem so bad. Thank you, Westville Wall Street!",,,
102,Pablo N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,9/28/2017,"This place is a mess. I ordered to go and literally stood there for 30 minutes - when I asked an update one of the workers simply said ""I have no idea what is going on."" Guys, get a system together. It's not that hard. Anyway, I finally got my order and guess what? It was wrong. Fish instead of chicken, I'm allergic to fish. Result of my experience: stood there for my full lunch hour and did not have any lunch.",,1,
103,A L.,"New York, NY",1,5,1,5.0,6/20/2017,"If you're familiar with the Westville menu, you know you can't go wrong with any of their selections to build a market plate or their organic meat entrees; But for those that are not yet familiar, you should be! We live in the neighborhood, which makes Westville Wall Street doubly welcoming. Great, healthy food at a great price and AMAZING hospitality. The management/ownership is by far some of the best I've ever experienced in my 14 years living in the neighborhood (thank you, Shy and Matan!) We were regulars before, but you've since reinforced our choice to make Westville our no-brainer go-to for delicious eating!",,,

106,Lo H.,"New York, NY",13,20,0,4.0,9/6/2017,"Love that this is here so close to my apt!  The food here is solid, with plenty of healthy and vegetarian options.  I've had the special several times and haven't been disappointed.  The sweet potato fries are also killer.  Brunch has been great especially with outdoor seating.  Also very kid friendly, they have high chairs and don't give you any side eye when your baby throws food on the floor.  I left a big tip, thanks!  :)",,,

108,Adi Z.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",2,12,0,5.0,8/29/2017,My husband and I came here for date night last week. It was such an enjoyable experience! I had the salmon plate and I was very happy with all the side options! Each one sounded wonderful and I was happy with the two that I picked (soy green beans and pesto mash)! My husband had a hamburger and he said it was perfectly cooked and let me tell you he is hard to please! To top it all off we had a homemade Oreo cookie and it was the best dessert! We will be coming back!,,,
109,Marisa C.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,5.0,9/24/2017,Local favorite. Great vegetables and brunch food! Laid back atmosphere! Try the mint lemonade drink!,,,
110,Katie S.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",346,1,0,5.0,8/14/2017,If you're looking for something fresh and on the healthier end I'd highly recommend Westville. Great farm to table spot with friendly service and really good food. I had the salmon salad which was simple yet delicious. Next time I'm in NY I will definitely stop by!,,,
111,Lewis S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",82,1,0,4.0,7/15/2017,I like this place. Good health food with lots of veggies and I can bring the dog and sit outside. Plus not expensive.  Glad they came downtown :):),,,
112,Joy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,31,0,5.0,5/21/2017,"Every single veggie we ordered was delicious and had its own unique flavor. And when I ordered fish and chips which turned out to be less than appetizing, the waitress quickly and apologetically took it away and allowed me to replace it with the a fantastic buttermilk chicken sandwich. We'll definitely be back.",,,
113,Ned E.,"Chelmsford, MA",0,9,0,1.0,5/22/2017,"super bearish on this placethe set up is odd, very expensive and very bad foodwas excited to have another food option. my friend got tuna sandwhich, i got turkey chili. both were meh and not close the price. the wait was also unclear and long (about 12 minutes). there is limited room for standing and waiting. not sure how they will handle it when large groups of people come in. dissapointing..",,,
114,Patty M.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,6/4/2017,"Upon our arrival we are told by the waiter it's a 5 minute wait. No problem. 5 minutes turned into 30 minutes. I started questioning why two couples that had just arrived were seated before us. I decided to practice positive thinking. They must have signed up prior but you know, you never really know!!!! Finally, we are seated. 10 more minutes for water to be served. 10 more minutes passed and no one came and I called over the same waiter. Asked her how long before someone took our order. Did I mention I was with a 5 year old who was already hungry and tired of waiting for the restaurant to just get it together. Needless to say I called manager and left after telling him how much their service sucked. I have been supporting Westville since 2008 when I worked on 12th street. I was so happy to learn they were opening up close to home on Wall.  They have expanded but seems like their service has declined. I will miss my favorite Chicken Sandwich but will not be returning to this location. Terrible first time experience.",,1,
