Updated review",Went here for drinks with a friend.  They have their own specialty cocktails between the 12 to 15 price range which is standard for manhattan.   The bartender was really nice and gave us some free shots.They play a lot of 2000s rock music and the crowd caters to the 90s kids.The staff found my friends credit card and made sure we got it back the next day. We didn't get to try any of the food but when we came back in the morning we ordered a Bloody Mary and it was very good. Made with horse radish.  The Saturday morning crowd was all women for brunch,,,
2,Li L.,"North Hollywood, North Hollywood, CA",0,1,0,2.0,7/20/2018,"We arrived here as basically the only customers in the place. Figured fantastic, food will be out soon. Wrong. We waited 45 minutes. The waitress didn't bother to check in, seemed generally quite lost. Checked in with her, she didn't know what was going on, no apology. Waited another 5 minutes, still nothing, still basically no customers in the place. Finally we got up in left because we had to catch an appointment and it became clear the food wasn't coming. Giving two stars because they just opened (possible learning curve...?)  and who knows, the food might be amazing. We just never got the chance to taste it.",,,
3,Alyssa W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",31,194,159,1.0,6/17/2018,"I rarely have terrible experiences at a restaurant, but this one for sure takes the cake.  My 1 star rating is 90% due to the service and 10% due to the food.I am on a vegan and gluten free diet due to health reasons and while it can make it hard to dine out, 90% of restaurants are extremely accommodating.  Ultimately, I can almost ALWAYS find a nice salad to eat.  I mean, every restaurant has lettuce, some veggies, and a vinaigrette right? Hell, I'll even take a lemon wedge as dressing! Apparently not here at this restaurant. I joined a group of 7 for a bridal celebration here and while I did not choose the place, I did look at the menu and saw there weren't any vegan/GF friendly options for brunch.  I still went with the group thinking that I could just ask them to make me a garden salad.Our waiter, Akira, was the most unhelpful, absolutely worst server ever.  She had terrible communication skills and did not go out of her way to help me or our party.  Instead, her terrible customer service skills put an extremely sour note on everyone's experience here, so much so that we will never dine here again.At first I asked her if they served any of their normal menu items during brunch (like brussel sprouts/sauteed spinach--b/c I could have just done that) and she said no. So then I notified her of my dietary restrictions (which can feel uncomfortable for people like me since I do have many food sensitivities). I asked if I could just have the side salad that comes with ALL of the entrees and instead, just make the side salad double/triple the size into a big ass salad.  She then said, ""she would check with the chef."" I wasn't asking for anything crazy y'all. I just wanted lettuce and maybe some onions and tomatoes. She comes back and says, ""No, we cannot make you a big side salad. We can only serve what's on the menu."" First of all, if you already make the side salad for every entree, why can't you just double the size and give it to me?! I don't understand how that's any more work or an impossible task.So I told her, the only option here is the Hangover Salad which comes with: chicken, hash browns, bacon, tomato, and blue cheese dressing and I reminded her I am vegan. She said, I could just get that salad and take out whatever doesn't work for me. So I then told her, ""I am vegan/GF so that means I would literally get lettuce and tomatoes for $18.  Can you just make me a salad with whatever veggies you have instead and charge me less?"" She says ""no.""I then tell her, ""Well, then, I won't be getting anything.""She then made NO effort to help me, absolutely ZERO apologies or any desire to try and rectify the situation.  She simply moved on to the next person in my group and took their order.  Honestly, I would have been okay if she had communicated ANY desire to help me.  A simple, ""I'm so sorry, I've been told that we can't make any changes, but let me go ask the chef if he can do this for you."" NONE of that.She made one absolutely terrible attempt at one point by saying: ""I can get you another pitcher of mimosas on the house....if you want."" But again, no apology for the situation. Just a lousy, ""I'll offer you mimosas...if you want."" IF. YOU. WANT. Do you not have basic customer service skills?We all looked at her and said: ""no, thank you."" If she had any common sense, she would have comped the pitcher we already bought.  Instead, she did nothing to help us, never apologized, and was terribly absent from our table after she knew she handled the situation wrong.  She avoided our table and we had to flag people down to clear our plates and get our check. I could also see her talking to the other servers about the situation and instead of communicating directly to us about the situation or showing any basic customer service skills, she chose to talk behind our back in attempt to bolster her own justifications for how she handled the situation. Management, please train your servers on how to communicate.  I'm happy they couldn't accommodate me because the side salad was trash according to everyone at the table, and most people did not finish their food because it was dry and flavorless (potatoes, biscuits, chicken to be exact). Instead, I went down the block and bought myself a nice kale salad and avocado toast, ate it, and enjoyed every bite.  No regrets at all, but definitely disappointed by the lack of effort and empathy that the workers showed. I will never come here again. TL;DR: If you are VEGAN or GF, DO NOT come here.  They are NOT accommodating. And if you are not vegan and GF, also DO NOT come here.  Their food is bland and the service is even worse.",8,2,1

They didn't like the mimosas but said it was ok. The burgers were good, we switched our regular fries to sweet potato fries and THEY ARE THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. Perfectly crispy on the outside. SO SOFT on the inside. I'm not even a fan of sweet potato fries, I just got it because it's healthier. I normally can't finish the side fries, but I finished these and could eat more. I could eat these for days. My friend got steak and eggs and she said it was good. BUT THOSE FRIES THO. Definitely not that healthy because they deep fried the hell out of it but wow SO GOOD. Once you finish your allotted time for bottomless, the bartender welcomes you to sit at the bar for another 10 minutes to get your moneys worth. They are one of the few places that takes reservations for bottomless brunch so that's a plus. Go to the sweet potato fries.",2,,1

9,Haley F.,"Center City, Philadelphia, PA",273,24,54,4.0,9/1/2018,"Great brunch for comfort food, fun atmosphere and bottomless mimosas. My only issue is pricing and their ""no substitutions"" rule. While one would assume the rule may exist for convenience and efficient kitchen traffic, when a request for toast instead of potatoes (both available on the menu) the waiter said, ""Unfortunately that isn't possible but I don't agree with our rule. You should Yelp about it."" So here I am. Awesome spot if you like the menu as is.",,1,

11,Danielle M.,"Jersey City, NJ",55,91,237,3.0,11/15/2017,"3.5 rounded down Came for bottomless brunch for my cousin's birthday. Two hours of mimosas or bloody Marys.Brunch menu is pretty big. General American food- lots of egg options, salads, fried chicken, and also classic burger and steak and eggs. I got the burger and also tried some of my cousin's fried chicken and waffles. The food was very good! My burger had a lot of flavor and the fries were thick and crispy. I thought the chicken was tasty as well. A little dry, but the outside was crunchy. The gravy was delicious though, and the gravy helped to compensate for the slight dryness of the chicken. It came with home fries, which I wish were a little less mushy, but I think that's a personal preference. Overall, no complaints about the food, especially not my burger.What dragged down the experience was the service. Our waitress was pretty attentive and was on point with the drinks. However, multiple times maybe an hour and a half in, the busboy tried to take away my plate when there was still clearly food (like part of the burger and fries) on it. I don't mind when it happens once when it looks like everyone else is finished with their food and I'm straggling behind, but many others at the table still had food too. Makes me feel like I'm being rushed, which shouldn't be the case at a brunch where we have two hours anyway. Food was good, drinks were good, service was meh. I don't think I'll come back again, but it's a decent brunch option.",,,
12,Ennei S.,"Queens, NY",5,76,218,1.0,8/16/2018,"I went during lunch time on a Wednesday with a group of 8 people as a team outing, it did not seem busy based on the open seats. When we first sat, drink orders were taken immediately and brought back fairly quick. The rest of the service fell from there. Order 4 appetizers for the table and took over 25 minutes. My soda was FLATTT. My silverware was dirty! Every time I wanted to find our waitress she would be missing and not once asked the rest of the table if everything was okay but to the person who was paying. I asked for what goes on my chicken sandwich entree, said what goes on a burger so I assume tomato, so I said don't put that on and no suggestion of ""well pickles are on did you want that, I would have said no!"" So when my meal came I was very upset. I sent it back to be removed, pickles for me ruin my meal. My brioche bun was stale! Also, asked for sauce on side that didn't happen but take a look at the sauce picture I posted. The Salmon a co-worker got was very good, wish I ordered that instead. Appetizers were good but over priced for portions. I don't blame the waitress for the food issue but basic questions were not up to par. I definitely will not be coming back. Oh last comment, waitress dropped food on a customer when delivering to table. Thankfully not ours.",,,

He kept saying he would go get more Diet Coke from a store down the block (doesn't make sense to me either) as one person in our party didn't drink but wanted diet cokes instead but did not make an effort to figure out the Diet Coke situation until one hour into our brunch. Also, when we arrived he checked on us once but then wouldn't come back to take our orders and we waited around twenty minutes until finally one person went up to him and asked him to come take our order. Again, very odd. While I enjoyed my food, I won't be rushing back.",,,
15,Victoria J.,"Philadelphia, PA",289,118,44,3.0,2/18/2018,"The short answer: Great place to come on a Sunday morning for bottomless brunch, but don't expect Wolfe Gang Puck to be working the kitchen.I have come here on several occasions for brunch, but mostly only for bottomless drinks in a cool atmosphere.  I love the way the restaurant was decorated, kind of like a quirky library.  All the tables have different chairs, some have couches and others have wooden seats.  The music is also very fitting for the vibe. Our waiters were very helpful and as attentive as they could be to a table full of rowdy drunk patrons. There's only one downside, but its pretty big--the food sucked.  Like I get it, some people come to these bottomless joints just to drink and food is pretty much only ammunition that allows them to drink more.  I'm from Philly and we take food very seriously, and this place obviously did not.  So if you are looking for a delicious brunch to go with your bottomless food, this isn't your place.   BONUS: if you happen to overstay your welcome (read: stay past the two hour time limit and another reservation wants their table) they will happily make you a full pitcher and move you to the bar area to finish it while enjoying the music.  That was a nice touch. All in all, I will probably be back because my friends LOVE this place, but if I'm looking to enjoy brunch food, I won't be coming here.",1,,

My mom brought me here on my birthday for brunch for our 12 PM reservation and we were seated right away which was nice as sometimes you'll have to wait despite having a res. We made the reservation right on Yelp too which was convenient. It was June so it was hot out and it felt as if the air conditioning was broken inside as well because we were both fanning ourselves and breaking a sweat trying to enjoy our food. We did bottomless and yeah the drinks were good and endless (duh Christa) but the food was a little bit underwhelming which was disappointing as I usually enjoy any egg Benedict. The bill ended up being about 110 with tip which was kind of ridiculous for two people as I've definitely paid less for bottomless at other places in the city and had a better experience. I think I would try it again and order a different entree but overall not the best brunch I've had,,,

I ordered the steak, eggs, and hash for brunch and it was perfect lunch of protein with some carbs. The server kept our cups full the whole time. We never saw the bottoms! We also arrived a little late and had to clear our table at 1 so the server let us hang out at the bar for an extra hour to enjoy bottomless mimosas.

22,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,2.0,6/25/2017,"The Crooked Knife offers a great brunch deal of roughly 40 dollars for unlimited mimosas and food. They are also able to accommodate large group as long as you set a reservation a week or so beforehand. However this is pretty much where all the benefits end.My group of 9 got here at 1pm and the place was jammed pack. We had a reservation so we were seated right away. Our server came over immediately and started pouring everyone mimosas. The mimosas tasted okay, it had a little to much juice for my taste but he was very quick with the refills which I loved.They had a pretty wide range of food options from basic omelets, salads, fence toast, florentines, and benedicts. I decided to go with the eggs florentine with home fries. The food came out relatively quickly after we put in our order.The eggs florentine itself tasted okay. The meal had a very bland taste, I had to put ketchup on top of everything to make it taste decent. The home fries also were not seasoned well enough. Overall the meal was okay, however like most brunch places people come for the drinks not the food. I would have given this place a higher rating had it not been so unbearably hot in the restaurant. It was an 85 degree day outside but inside felt like an oven. I was not sure if the AC was broken or if it was just not strong but it made drinking/eating unbearable.Overall, this place has potential because it is relatively cheap versus other similar restaurants. However if they want people coming back during the summer they have to do something about the AC.",,,

26,Candace G.,"Newark, NJ",0,38,31,3.0,8/27/2018,"Went to the restaurant for Saturday brunch. Cons- 1. I was disappointed that the steak and eggs they have advertised on their menu online was no longer offered . So be-aware that the online menu may differ at the restaurant.2. The drink selection for brunch was minimum. Only had mimosas and bloody Mary to choose from.  3. No appetizer selection 4. Waiter wasn't really attentive. When we wanted a refill on our pitcher we had to search someone down to replace it.5. Music was really loud. But A music variety would have been nice. Pros 1. I ordered the chicken with biscuit. Which was tasty and the portion size was very good !2. We were only a party of 2, so once our 2 hours were up we weren't rushed to leave the table, which I liked a lot !3. Decor was nice. 4. The waiter was friendly.5. Ordered Mimosas which were on point ! If you're not looking for a huge variety, this restaurant would be good for you.Overall I would return back but no rush !",,,

Waiter didn't come until 3:50, and our drinks were given to us until 4:20. At that time, we WERE SUPPOSED to have 2 hours of bottomless mimosas, but were cut off my the waiter at 5:15 because ""they needed the table""..... There were at least 4 other tables open.

If no alterations were stated on the menu I'd understand this, but it wasn't. All in all not a bad experience but could definitely be improved.

Updated review","I don't know why I stopped coming to The Crooked Knife. My friends and I had a wonderful time last night. Megan is THE BEST and added to our fun dinner. She accommodated a friend of mine having a...lady emergency and went above and beyond. Took ""Prom"" photos of my friends and I, and was just generally an awesome hostess/waitress.I asked to be seated by the fireplace, and that request was easily accommodated. It wasn't too crowded and thinned out around 9.  The food was great. I had the CK salad, and it was so good. My friends all got burgers and I was instantly jealous. I snuck a few fries off plates and they were yummy too!Crooked Knife is a cozy favorite, and I foresee myself back for brunch and dinners a lot more in the future. Thanks for a great atmosphere for a mini-reunion!-Fire Ashley",1,,1
43,Alexandra M.,"New York, NY",369,72,61,4.0,12/22/2017,Great for bottomless brunch. The drink service is really fast. Our food did take a while but they were able to seat us right away without reservations. The food is nothing special but good. I would go for the atmosphere and mimosas.,,,
44,Kevin T.,"Cranford, NJ",367,13,5,3.0,3/15/2018,"We came here on a Saturday morning for their boozy brunch. They were able to accommodate a large party of us no problem. While the eclectic decor and bottomless mimosas were fun, the food fell a bit short (under seasoned and unoriginal). If you are looking for your run of the mill nyc brunch spot, this is the place.",,,
45,Meghan S.,"Manhattan, NY",361,152,88,4.0,4/10/2017,"Recently went here for brunch for a friends birthday. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The service was great and the food was good. The waitress kept us loaded with a fresh pitcher of mimosas the entire 2 hours and made sure the people drinking bloody marys were never empty. Very impressive considering the place was full. When our two hours was up we were asked to move but were told we could stay at the bar, where they gave us one more mimosa pitcher even though we were at our 2 hour mark. The bartenders were also very nice and attentive. The décor was a bit electic with mismatching wallpaper and random photos of celebrities scattered throughout the place. Overall, good service, good atmosphere and well worth the $39 2 hour bottomless brunch and entrée cost. I will definitely be returning!",3,,

Updated review","The Crooked Knife has continued to evolve over the past few years.  I am most happy that Filip the bartender has started a Rainbow Karaoke night every Sunday.  This is an all inclusive night for everyone.  The Drag queen host is Jacklynn Hyde and she does an amazing job at getting the crowd energized and singing.  Filup had turned Sunday nights at the Crooked Knife a party.   It's an all night happy hour at the bar and Filup makes amazing drinks. The kitchen has a new head chef who finally brought Mozzarella Sticks to the menu, they are delicious.  There is a new bar menu as well with some great small plates; potato skins, calamari and several others.  I still recommend The Crooked Knife for special holiday events as they have a Mother's Day special menu and a menu for most other holidays.",1,,
48,Daniel C.,"Tempe, AZ",141,4,0,1.0,7/8/2018,"I would give this place 4 stars, but having the head chef yell at our waitress (who was fantastic by the way, Sonya was her name, I think) really ruined my experience. Can't say I'll be back.",,,
49,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",187,359,460,2.0,11/27/2017,"Terrible bar.  This place has a rowdy, out-of-town, crowd.  I grabbed a drink around midnight with a friend on a weekday, and the people in the bar area were creating a ruckus.  Several people were drunk and shouting at each other, which made it so loud to even hear the person next to you.  Also, shady bartender who didn't give us a bill for our beers, and just told us ""your beers are about $10 each.""  How is a drink ""about""a dollar amount?!  Definitely some dirty business going on.",,,
50,Tamara I.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",4,30,20,2.0,8/27/2018,"TERRIBLE customer service!!! I reserved a table for 5 people for Sunday brunch on a Tuesday afternoon - spoke to some guy who didn't take my email for confirmation just said I was good to come in. When my party arrived we waited like 10 minutes until the tall brunette hostess noticed us and when she did she said no reservation was made, i showed her proof of the phone call and she said "" maybe i called the wrong restaurant"" acting as if i'm a twit who doesn't know how to make a reservation. she then had a redhead waitress come by and say we can either sit outside ( in scorching hot 90 degree weather ( NO SHADE, NO FANS) or at the bar. Neither one of them cared to really search their system to check if my reservation was there or even check the caller ID. its 2018!!!!! the red head even made a comment "" this makes my day"" meaning people losing their reservations and being upset is a joke to her??? clearly whoever took my reservation was new and has no clue how to work a phone (neither does anyone else at crooked knife).  SOOO  we sat at the bar because everything else for brunch was booked and we were starving. The WORST part of this whole situation is that there were THREEEEEEE(3) huge open tables for 2 hours that were opened and neither one of them came to offer the tables to us even when we asked. NYC basic rule of thumb is if within 15 minutes a reservation doesn't show up you lose your table. So 2 incompetent girls couldn't figure out basic restaurant/ customer service ethics- did not offer a meal discount or maybe some complimentary dessert for their mess up and the best part of all was there was no manager on duty! HA. The handsome bartender was slow- had to ask for silverware? 3 times for sugar and he wasnt attentive at all( also he was texing lol ... anyways my eggs were fine but who can mess up an egg order right? we each paid $54 for terrible service. DONT BOTHER COMING HERE FOR BRUNCH OR MAKE 5 RESERVATIONS ON DIFFERENT NAMES TO BE SAFE,",,,

52,Hyesil C.,"New York, NY",341,122,162,4.0,5/1/2017,"One of my favorite spots for boozy brunch where you can have a chill time without music blasting so loud that you can't hear your friends and where the food is actually very good. I've been here multiple times and can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. You'll have a great time opting for the boozy deal which is definitely on the cheaper side compared to all those popular boozy brunch spots (Paradou, Il Bastardo, PS450 etc). The servers are all great with keeping your drinks full with constant refills. You will leave here with a happy stomach and a nice happy buzz. They also got outdoor seating which is great once the weather gets nice out.",,,

At the end of the month when I get my credit card bill this place shows up a lot!  There are many reasons this is such a great spot 1. Seating. Great space. There is the Restaurant side for dining. Great long wooden bar. Bar tables and now that it is nice outside seating. 2. Food. The menu was recently updated with new items. I have not had all of them but my new favorites are the sliders and the beet salad. 3. Drinks. The bar staff know what they are doing. I'm not a beer drinker but my beer drinking friends like the selection. Right now I am enjoying the ""Felipe"". A drink created by, you guessed it, Felipe. 4. Staff. The staff is Amazing. They take the time to connect with the customers 5. And the the most important!  Free water!",,,
56,Tisha B.,"Inglewood, CA",0,1,0,2.0,9/23/2017,"This place is mediocre at best. Went there in a hungry moment the morning after a wedding for brunch. They do a bottomless brunch for under $40 which is cool if you like Bloody Mary's that taste like water with a lot of spice and a splash of alcohol, greasy eggs and soggy bacon. I would have only rated this place one star but the cool music and decor and the creme brûlée French toast earned the additional star. If you're looking for simple drinks and good music/vibe then take a shot. If you're hungry don't bother.",1,,

I had the Homemade Meatball Sliders with Spicy Marinara Sauce. These were pretty good but didn't have much of the spicy marinara that you would expect if it's in the title for this dish. The bread could have been a better bread then it would have really made this dish be amazing.,,,
58,Robert E.,"Indianapolis, IN",14,129,23,2.0,4/10/2018,Well....I was staying down the street at The Rogers Hotel and the front desk recommended this restaurant because it was close.  Bad recommendation for an adult.  The night I went had a group of very attractive but very loud girls just having a good time but yelling the entire time.  That was once I got a seat!  I first walked into the restaurant and the bartender and female server looked at me liked I didn't belong.  Quite an interesting experience that I'm not sure I would recommend.  The bartender made a good Moscow mike and was cool but paid more attention to the ladies.  The server never saw her again after I sat down.  Chicken wings were store bought and just cooked.  Not their recipe.  I guess a good spot of you aren't looking for a sophisticated sit down restaurant.  More of a college setting not for older mature adults in my opinion.  I wouldn't avoid but can't recommend either.,,,
59,Naomi Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,293,331,5.0,4/2/2016,"Wonderful brunch spot!Came on a Saturday around noon w/my boyfriend and got 2 seats at the bar. ATMOSPHERE:It was a bar setting with a bunch of tables, but it was cozy (but not too cozy). The noise level started out ok but 1.5 hours later (aka peak. Brunching time) it got pretty loud...then again I had been drinking mimosas for an hour and a half so that might have contributed to it :)FOOD:We did the bottomless brunch which was a great deal ($34 for an entree + 2 hours of unlimited mimosas or bloody Mary's). I got the smoked salmon benedict & he got the cure omelet - both were great & came quickly. The portions were large enough to fill you up but not so big that it's too much to eat.

61,Gail E.,"Manhattan, NY",22,5,2,1.0,5/11/2018,"They get one because I did like the wine the bartender recommended. Once we went over to a table for dinner we waited over 20 minutes for our food and then left. We called our waiter over, he ended up in the kitchen, then we waived the host over when the waiter did not reappear...she disappeared into the kitchen as well. The couple seated who got their food after 10 minutes were happy. While both waiter and host were in the kitchen, a plate came out, not ours....we left. Seems they could not handle the main courses.

Since it was someones birthday they brought us over a piece of cake then charged us $8 for it which was pretty annoying since we didn't ask for the cake.

Seemed like a popular spot and I would try again. Came the next day for lunch and had no trouble getting a table. The Lunch menu was short but interesting and I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich. Imagine my disappointment to discover that I have just paid $15 for something not quite as good as Chick-fil-A. Sandwich was bland and tasteless, the fries soggy even when I asked for them ""crisp"".  Too many great restaurants in NY to waste your time and calories here.  Service was nice!",,,

We both got the mimosas, they did not skimp on the prosecco/champagne, which was nice and our glasses were never empty!

I come in all the time in the afternoon on a break to grab a quick drink on happy hour and the Irish guy that work there is SUCH an ass and half the time he over charges me for drinks and ""forgets it's happy hour"". I kept going in there before because of the bartender with glasses but now he doesn't work there in the day time.

The entire restaurant was reserve, awaiting the bustling brunch crowd approaching, so we sat at the bar- which was quite spacious! Tables are sophisticated and elegantly dressed. Seating ranged from dining chairs to red leather love seats. It was very well decorated! The menus are a little worn out and hard to read, but maybe that's the look they're going for. The $34 bottomless brunch caught my eye, but all I needed was the Hair of the dog to spring me out of my impending hangover. I ordered a Bloody Mary - basic, tiny cocktail olives as a garnish, and heavy on the vodka. For only $7 per drink it was the way to go for me! But having and entree and multiple drinks for 2 hours would have been a way to kick off a Sunday Funday. (And that would have been totally possible because the environment was laid back and great tunes were playing- multiple genres, so all were appeased.)Food was good - we all got egg items, which were plentiful! Eggs (Benedict or omelette in our case) came with 2 slices of bacon, a slice of toast, about a cup of home fries, and 1/4 cup fresh fruit- I was impressed! The bartender and staff were also very friendly and helpful! I'd love to try the bottomless brunch the next time!",,,

80,Elizabeth M.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,0,1.0,10/3/2017,"This review is overdue, but I am just getting to it. I went to the crooked knife with a friend on a Sunday in July of 2015. Hopefully there has been some overturn in the waitstaff, because the service we received was atrocious. We were first seated at a tiny two person table in the very back of the restaurant. People were constantly walking by and bumping us on their way to the kitchen or bathroom. We asked to be moved and were moved up front when a table opened up. Literally no one would want to eat in that spot. The table should be removed. We sat for a while waiting to order. When we finally ordered, we got the bottomless mimosa brunch for around $40. I got some kind of florentine dish with potatoes. The waitress was horrible at refilling our mimosa glasses. If I'm paying $40 for a times bottomless brunch, I'd appreciate it if you filled it more than once. She never came over to our table without being beckoned. We had to keep asking for refills, at times even going to the bar as our waitress was nowhere to be found. When we were finally done eating we waited around for a bit thinking she would come check on us (even though she had yet to do so). Once we hit the twenty minute mark of being completely done with our food and drinks we went to find her. She came over to us and we told her we would like the check in a timely manner since the rest of the meal took way too long. We said this matter of factly, not with an attitude. Next, the ""manager"" comes over to us. I don't believe she was actually a manager because she had been pouring drinks behind the bar all morning and was incredibly unprofessional. She accused us of cussing out the waitress which absolutely did not occur. The couple seated next to us interjected and defended us. We then told the manager how disappointed we were with the service and how long everything had taken etc. She offered us a fireball shot to make up for it. At 3 pm. On a Sunday....needless to say I will not be back.",2,,
81,Rob S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,40,2,2.0,12/22/2017,"The Crooked Knife is an apt name for this place. It can't get anything straight and is pretty much useless. I went there for a group brunch (12 people) about a week ago. The service was abysmal. The waiter was completely inattentive, never asking if we needing anything. Food came out sporadically - anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes after ordering! The food itself was poor to mediocre. I shared a classic eggs Benedict and salmon eggs Benedict with my wife. Both of them had cold, greasy English muffins and over-cooked eggs, with sub-par potatoes. (Some people ordered the french toast, which looked good.)The bloody Mary was tiny and one of the worst I ever had. I think it was just tomato juice and a shot of vodka for $11 in a 10-ounce glass.It then took forever for our check to come. They comped two meals that took 90 minutes, but only at our request.The ambiance of the place is nice, so a star for that, but it's far from unique.With so many choices in New York, there's no reason to go to this place.",,,

There is a two hour time limit which is pretty long in my opinion. They do up-charge for certain menu items on the bottomless brunch + entree menu so watch out for that. Also, I would not recommend sitting in the front room on the right if it is a cold day.

I like the burger and the food is much better now than it was a couple of years ago. During the winter, they have a fire in the fireplace, which is fantastic. For five years, it's been my local bar and I'm glad that I only live two doors down. My only complaint is the bouncer. I frequently walk my dogs late at night see people sitting at outside tables. I've sat outside with my dogs and had a beer after midnight. It's never been a problem. However, when I tried to sit outside the other night, the bouncer was rude and invented a rule that people couldn't sit outside after 11pm. But here's the thing, it's 1am and I just walked by and there are multiple tables outside and people drinking. So is there a rule or not? As a paying customer, I don't appreciate being called a liar while the cocky bouncer invents a non-existent rule. Every time I walk by and see him out late at night, I'm reminded that this bar could be so much better without him.",2,,
88,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,3/23/2016,"The first time I came here was not exactly by choice. I had to fulfill my weekly trivia league requirements with Steph and somehow Monday was the only day of the week in that week in particular that worked for the both of us. We're hardcore. I had walked from my job downtown to midtown. Trivia is supposed to start at 7pm but it didn't start until 7:30 so that automatically kind of created a kill buzz. Though, it was happy hour until 8pm which is pretty nice and lenient. However, I didn't feel like drinking much (Monday) and stuck to having just a glass of wine. Everything is pretty much $5 though on tap, wine, well. Not a huge selection on tap. About five or 6 beers and the best beer is probably Founders All Day IPA or Bluepoint. They sometimes have some beer and wing combo specials as well. Anyway, my first experience here was definitely a 1 - 2 star review. Late trivia, hard to find a spot to sit, stuffy, the bartender wasn't paying attention anytime I went up to her to flag her down. Tried to sit up at the bar about three times and she told us someone was sitting there. A bit later on two guys come in and sit down in the same bar stools we asked about. Different people that were there before. She didn't hassle them for wanting seats up at the bar. I took in the decorative photos of David Bowie and the swoon worthy Jonathan Rhys Meyers (I can stare at you all freaking day no matter how bad the bar experience may be). At this point, trivia still hadn't started and we were starting to get hungry and felt crowded so asked if we could sit in the dining area instead of at a table that kept getting bumped into by the bathrooms and peoples' seats. She said only if we each ordered food and we responded that we were going to share either an appetizer or entree and what does the staff say? No, you can stay where you are seated. Really, you need to both order an entree at the very least. The entire dining area on the opposite side of the room was significantly more spacious and almost completely empty. After hearing this we were both fuming and decided to just, you know, not order any food out of protest and continue on with our trivia that we actually ended up winning. Much to the protest of the crowd that night because only two girls with the team name ""Mac and Cheese Please"" can't possibly be smart. Rolls eyes.We came back this weekend realizing we still had a coupon gift certificate. Whole different experience. Probably because it was less crowded and we just followed the brunch crowd. Which they have an unlimited boozey brunch for $34 on weekends that includes your entree and bottomless mimosas. A bit steep in price but that's how most brunches are going these days. Between the two of us we split an order of their mac and cheese (duh, its our team name). Whatever cheese sauce its in it is decadent and super creamy with a light crumbling of parmesan crumbs on top. A 4 star macaroni in my opinion and its really a large portion for one or great for two and worth its $13 price tag. We also split the grilled chicken burger with a rosemary and garlic aioli with both cheddar and gorgonzola cheese on top (which I think they charged extra for) but the burger was great. It tasted like it was freshly grilled in my dad's backyard on the que and the sauce that accompanied it - perfection, along with thickly cut wedge fried potato chunks. Food coma ensued and our bartender felt bad after hearing about our last experience after she asked what we thought of trivia and treated us well. Automatically Crooked Knife went from 1 or 2 stars to 4 stars but I rounded somewhere in the middle. Decent food. Okay drinks. Annoying crowd that may make your bar experience bad. No toilet paper in most of the stalls. Also, they had run out of a few dishes to serve when we came in Sunday evening. But overall, a decent Irish pub. I probably wouldn't come back for trivia mostly because I didn't enjoy doing it here as much as at other places.",4,2,2

It was fine at first, the food was okay, the mimosas were decent (however for some reason our waiter only gave us 1 pitcher for our table of 10 making it difficult to pass to each other, the table next to us was given several pitchers for their large group... weird). It's listed on the menu that Bottomless is 2 hours long but I defiantly felt like we were being rushed, an hour and 20 in I was one of the last people still working on my plate, while talking with my friend the busboy  took the food I was still working on from under me without even asking, I was pretty shocked at that. Then the waiter (tall guy with longish brown hair) starts snapping at us about having to leave (we still had a good 30 minutes before our two hours were up). He refused to give us another mimosa refill but I stayed seated until our last minute of principle alone. The waiters rudeness at the end really killed any positives this place had to offer. It was really uncalled for, especially considering we were celebrating a birthday. I figure since our group was large and gratuity was already included he figured he could treat us like trash. This place seemed promising the the staff totally killed it for me, I'll never return.",1,,

Food was delicious, the service was fast, friendly and attentive. Let's just say I never saw the bottom of my glass as my mimosa was consistently filled.

We went on a Saturday after a fun Friday night in the city for my birthday. My husband secured reservation on Open Table and we would recommend others do the same. We arrived about 15 minutes early from our reservation time and were seated right away, right near a cozy fireplace. Be aware that the cushions on the seats can be stained but the rest of the atmosphere more than made up for that. The outside and inside of the place was nicely decorated for the holidays and the inside ambiance was relaxed and fun. You had anyone from football fans to groups of friends to couples enjoying brunch. This place is definitely good for everyone and anyone who wants a delicious brunch with unlimited drinks!I ordered a bloody mary, extra spicy and it hit the spot. Husband drank mimosas and they brought over a carafe for him. I ordered the lobster benedict and it was incredible. Husband ordered the Mexican omelette and he loved it. The portions were huge and really, really good. I was really impressed. The home fries were perfect. The bacon, a little too crispy for my taste, but still really good. The drinks were quality, definitely no skimping on the alcohol! We left with a pretty big, happy, full buzz. This place is awesome for brunch and I can't wait to find a reason to go back! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, relaxed brunch experience for a great deal.",3,1,2

There is a good $45 deal including a three course meal and unlimited drinks in a 1.5 hour time limit. We ended up being here for over three hours because of how ridiculously s-l-o-w  the food came out. I was expecting to be out of there by 9 but kind of impossible when you just got your entree. I'm not too sure why it took so long considering there were maybe 4 other tables there and most of us ordered the exact same dishes.The food was okay - nothing special and definitely not worth the wait. For the appetizer, they were out of the soup so we were given the option of Mac n Cheese. It was tasty, not too cheesy and with a nice crunch. The steak was mediocre and I thought the side salad had more flavor. The cheesecake was disappointing.Our waiter Justin was accommodating to our large and pretty loud party of 11, which is the only reason I'd come back here and give brunch a try.

George our waiter was so friendly and accommodating. Loved how even after our two hours was up, he brought us another mimosa pitcher and let us hang out by the bar.

Okay cool. As a group of 10 we all showed up on time but were seated 30 minutes late.  Shit happens in NYC brunch scene, but okay, moving on once again...After a little while of drinking where only 1/3 had the proper glasses for mimosas (the rest said F it and just went with boozing out of the water cups), the waiter comes over with some ""bad news"".""Sorry guys.  Being that it's late in the day we are out of most ingredients.  All we can do is eggs or burgers"".  Ummm excuse me?  It's a Saturday and it's brunch.  How the balls did you run out of everything?  So, basically everyone ordered burgers but not by choice.  He began with some free nachos for our trouble.  I guess they had that on hand, but those weren't really that good and definitely didn't make up for the lack of more than half their menu. Another fact from that day is that yours tuly had just finished a 1/2 marathon before this.  So, naturally, yours truly is a hangry little beast by the time he has to wait for his brunch food.  How do you piss off a hangry beast even more you may wonder?  You forget to cook their meal.  The kitchen had two damn things on the menu and they forgot to make the food of the people who ordered egg dishes?  Like really? WTF?Fed up by this point, Justin provided us with a piece of french toast he scrapped up and some eggs from a big communal pot.  Whatever, I just needed something to the point I may have even considered McDonalds.  Okay JK I wouldn't actually eat McDs.The fact that no managers came over to apologize for the blunders of the kitchen or to even ask how everything was (I would have given an earful if they had), makes me think their manager just didn't show up that day.  Someone screwed up.  It wasn't the waiter.  It was the behind the scenes stuff and as a customer we noticed and will never be back.  Also the food and mimosa quality was just sub-optimal at best.  Okay sub-optimal is just my political correctness way of saying the entire meal sucked giant elephant balls. #neveragain #neverforget",10,9,5

They allow you 2 hours but if you get there after after 2pm, they don't give you additional time past 4pm. They are strict with that and bring out the bills at 4pm sharp. The food was great. I had the ""Crooked Omelette"" which was served with home fries, bacon, toast and fruits. I thought the side of fruits was genius. I'm just very recently attempting to drink Bloody Mary's and I must say this place facilitated that. I downed about 2-3 glasses for the first time. Place was pretty crowded and everyone seemed to be having fun. I noticed the customers were composed of mostly young adults in their 20s.

They made really good cappuccinos and had good brunch food options at reasonable prices. They had a bunch of omlettes (but didnt allow substitutions because their kitchen was busy).They had a special of $34 for unlimited bloody marys or mimosas including an entree (mimosas were $11 each, so worth it if you would do more than one).Overall a good solid place for brunch in midtown.",,,

The food itself is whatevs - I got the full Irish which has a lot of dryish sausage, couple of slices of toast and two fried eggs. Definitely not earth-shattering.",,,

Easy peasey, even though we would've been fine without it, but you know how these things go. I'm not a bruncher, usually, so it was an adjustment seeing and hearing so much drunkeness in so much daylight. The tables are tiny and the place is overall pretty dim, which is good if you're going the hair of the dog route. The service was great. Our little pitcher of mimosas was never empty, which is a great thing, but also kind of a terrible thing, especially when you're with a friend who makes it their mission to make sure your glass is never empty. Needless to say, I was stone-cold sober walking in, to the point of being slightly irked by the level of noise, but left definitely being a contributor to the noise. The food was great, but when you're there for so long, drinking so much, it's definitely not enough, but I know that's not how this bottomless brunch thing works. I got the full irish breakfast which I haven't had since I was in Ireland. Black & white pudding, rashers, potatoes, fried egg. Amazing. It's a little cramped, especially right next to the bar that awkwardly divides the place in half and it's a little too dark, but I had a great time, so it's totally worth a second visit. And a third.",1,1,1
131,Sakshi G.,"Long Island, NY",41,79,36,4.0,4/22/2017,"So I recently did my birthday brunch at crooked knife, west village. We were a group of 14 plus a baby. Some of us opted for boozy brunch while others just did an entree and ordered a drink separate. They have strict 2 hr slots for each table and we were for 1-3pm slot. Space was a little cramped for a big group. We sat indoor under the sky light coz they said they can't accommodate such a big group outdoors. Indoor area wasnt bad specially after they opened the windows( it was a pretty warm spring day) The service was really prompt in terms of refilling the drinks for people doing boozy brunch. The mimosas were strong, music was good. The bloody marys werent as good apparantly coz noone drinking bloody marys was buzzed at the end. Lol. The food however was just ok, but then that's the case with most of the boozy brunch places. Only thing that I kind of found weird was they basically charged most of us as boozy brunch on the check just coz towards the very end of the brunch, some people started sharing and tasting each others drinks. I understand it's not standard to share drinks at a boozy brunch but we were a group of 14 and we ordered tons of food. And noone started sharing until like the last 20 min of our slot time. A lot of boozy brunch places let it slide but this place just seemed little too strict on that. Other than that we all had a good time and the  staff was very attentive.",,2,

Server was not exactly attentive and the host/hostesses were  too absorbed in their own conversation to care about anything. Didn't seem very professional. I ordered the burger and to my delight, it came out relatively quick (~15 minutes?) BUT it was nothing extraordinary. The buns were drenched in oil and the fries were soggy... I could've probably gotten a more decent burger at Five Guys.To their credit though, their mimosa was amazing!",1,1,1

I think a little pricey but boy did they mean bottomless. The only thing I didn't like was our food took forever to come out. I felt like they kept feeing is mimosas to forget that we didn't have our food. The food was fine and service was food.

We opted not to do the bottomless brunch, instead having just a few mimosas (which differ in strength depending on which server makes them!) before our food came. Our server Justin had something to say about nearly every menu option and all of them were wonderful. The portions were well-sized and a good price. The french toast in particular was wonderful, not too sweet, but a perfect combination of thick-cut challah with cream and berries.

Given the high price point I was expecting a bit higher quality, but what I got tasted like a frozen microwaveable meal. The meat was such poor quality that it was difficult for me to understand how they served it to customers. It was so tough and chewy (think of chewing on a pencil eraser) that I had to physically spit it out and could not take another bite. Aside from the sorry excuse for shepherds pie, my girlfriend order the fried chicken sandwich, which was very mediocre at best. Based on these two items I'll certainly never order from here again.",1,,

We still got a solid 1.5 hours worth of unlimited drinks, and that was plenty. The one great thing I can say about this place is the side dishes... I don't know about you but breakfast sides are key to a good brunch for me, and with any egg dish you got EVERYTHING - potatoes, bacon, toast.There was a little problem with refills - it was hard to flag them down (and as I said the place was pretty empty, so that was weird), but all in all it was a good experience.

146,Jenna U.,"Mahwah, NJ",394,394,49,5.0,4/23/2015,"My sorority sisters and I try to meet monthly (more like quarterly) for brunch. But last minute last week we decided to meet on the upcoming Saturday due to the amazing forecast of a 70 degree weekend! It was hard to find reservations last minute for a party of 6, so I ran to yelp and used the amazing filter to make a reservation and WALAA there was the Crooked Knife with perfect time availability and little did I know, I'd fall in love.To start, The Crooked Knife is centrally located. As a proud Jersey girl only 20 minutes from the city, I have a love hate relationship with it. I love spending time in NYC but the commute can be so easy at times and so miserable at others (made props to you all who do this daily). So The Crooked Knife was only a few blocks from the Penn Station, Port Authority, and the Path for us Jersey girls but also convenient for my NYC gals. Secondly, the decor and atmosphere is so adorable and quaint. You felt like you were at your stylish grandmothers house when you stepped inside. No table was the same, the decorator for this restaurant truly is gifted and I love the calming and cute attire it was dressed in.Now here comes the best part... $34 for BOTTOMLESS mimosas (or Bloody Mary's) and a delicious entree. I am a huge champagne drinker so I have no complaint here but I do know some brunch people want their vodka, so if you aren't into champs and bloody's this may not be for you. Now sometimes at bottomless drink places, the service may be slow and while the drinks are bottomless there is some time gap of wait on one drink to the other. NOT at The Crooked Knife. The waitress was on her game and we never saw an empty pitcher without a full pitcher being right next to it. The wait service here was thebomb.com: friendly, accommodating, and do a damn good job!Then to add, the menu had so many amazing choices to pick. I really had a hard time, but I think I made the best one. I had the salmon cakes with a horseradish sauce and a citrus salad. It was to die for and delicious. My girlfriends had salads, eggs, burgers, etc and no one had anything to complain about their meal. Even one of my friends has a food allergy and the waitress was more than accommodating when my friend thought she was not going to be able to eat anything on the menu. The waitress was able to combine two dishes that would work for her dietary needs and did it with a smile.I really fell in love on Saturday so much that I am planning a trip with my mother.. she needs to try these salmon cakes!",2,,

Came here to have Sunday brunch with a few girlfriends (of course made a reservation prior.. Which I suggest you do as well-I hate waiting) upon entering we were immediately seated in the back by the fireplace.  Yeah! No wait! Until........Once seated we received absolutely no attention, meaning after 25 mins (if not more... Not exaggerating) we still were unsuccessful in waving someone down so we could order.. At this point we were starving, therefore by the time our food arrived it tasted amazing.  We were all very happy with our meals and have nothing bad to say except maybe the burger was a bit greasy.  However our opinion of the food might be a little clouded as we were starving lol but hey at least we liked it.

I had the egg white omelette which I really enjoyed. My friends had the eggs benedict and while they really enjoyed it, they agreed the portion size was tiny. We had to order a side of french toast to fill my girlies up. As far as the mimosas, delicious! They were not stingy with the champagne at all - and they refilled us as much as possible.

It's spacious, the food is good, and the service is awesome. They have a boozy brunch deal where you pay $43 and you can get any entree and unlimited bloody marys/mimosas for 2 hours. It seems a little pricey to do the unlimited, but it's honestly worth it since you get two full hours and their drinks are delicious (mimosas are mostly champagne with a slash of OJ, which is the correct way to make a mimosa). Personally, I love the Crooked Omelet-- I tend to get it more often than other items, but the Creme Brulee French Toast is also really good! The menu is pretty basic, and the food is good but nothing to write home about. This is such a fun place, and I feel like there's always at least one birthday party happening.

162,Shaun P.,"New York, NY",213,1,0,5.0,3/13/2016,"I never Yelp, but the service was so good that I just had to (and I told our waitress the same). This review is for an unlimited Sunday brunch on 2/7/16, my waitress's name was Liz (""Elisabeth G"" on the receipt) - and let me tell you she was one of the best brunch waitresses I've ever had.First off, the unlimited mimosas didn't come in glasses - they came in *carafes* (and it was only two of us!!). This was already a win. The price was also good ($34 for one entree and 2 hours unlimited mimosas or bloodys). But the best part was, pretty much as soon as our carafe was empty Liz would notice and come back with a full one (without us even having to ask or look for her - we went through 3 of them... or wait, was it 4? :D ). What made this so impressive was that the place was packed - this included a birthday party of 10+ ppl next to us, and another party of 5+ ppl right behind us (she made sure to keep both of their carafes full too).I really appreciated her being so attentive to us and making sure we were good (us being a party of 2, surrounded by two large parties) - as a waitress, I would have totally understood if she was more attentive to the larger parties (since that usually means a bigger tip). But she never made us feel unattended to or rushed in the slightest, and she even took the time to introduce herself and speak with us before the meal was done.The mimosas were actually quite good (equal parts OJ and champagne [as opposed to 'watered/juiced' down]) - but that service was second-to-none. Yeah you might be able to find slightly cheaper unlimited brunches around, but you *absolutely* get your money's worth here. Without a doubt I will be back.",1,,

She made recommendations and told us about the bottomless boozy brunch, which is 30-something bucks for an entree and bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's. We got so pumped about the food options and bottomless mimosas we didn't even remember to order coffee. Really creative brunch specials, including the hangover salad, which is what we both got. Chicken Ceasar salad with bacon and hash browns in it? Yes please!

Not too crammed and not too loud. The service was great, our waiter was really cool and friendly. Overall I really liked the vibes here. Brings in a pretty young crowd, plays good music, and is decorated beautifully. Only weak point about this place is the food isn't anything special.

I got up by myself and got what I need it. Then at 12:50pm this chick came and told us the table was reserved and we had to leave by 1pm. I never had a restaurant do this. Lastly, the bottomless mimosas were horrible. They were weak. By the bar I saw how these two girls had the bartender make them and that's the way to go. It's fair to say I'm not going back.

170,Lauren T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,23,0,4.0,9/5/2016,"My friend and I came here for bottomless brunch after flying into New York on a red eye. We had a few hours to kill before we could check into our hotel, so we dropped off our bags and came to the Crooked Knife for a reservation I'd made for 12:00. The scene here is pretty wild/hilarious. There were a couple of large, rowdy parties, complete with maxi dresses and sun hats. The restaurant was playing 90s and 2000s throwback hip-hop and R&B which was definitely a crowd-pleaser, and perfect for the bottomless booze environment. Our server was fantastic and super attentive--our mimosa glasses were never empty! He also brought us a lemon drop shooter at one point, which was much appreciated. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the food wasn't good. Like not good at all. Probably one of the worst eggs florentine I've ever had, and there were hardly any potatoes on my plate. Luckily our server took note of this, and brought me an extra plate of potatoes (not sure if he noticed on his own or overheard me mention it to my friend). But let's be real--you're paying for endless mimosas, not a 5-star meal.By the end of the 2-hour window they allow for bottomless mimosas, I was very drunk and very happy. The experience was really fun and I'd love to go back with a larger group. This would be a fun place to come for a birthday, bachelorette weekend, etc. Not awesome food but good service, a fun crowd and a great overall experience!",,,

Came here around 10am for brunch, but the place seemed to be completely full with people waiting around 11:30am. Nice decor with comfortable seating (although a bit dark).Food was good, but no substitutions. I got the Cure Omelette, which was tasty and very filling.May return if there's no wait :)",,,
172,Chelsea V.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",160,211,21,5.0,2/17/2016,"We came here on a very cold day for Sunday brunch. The ambiance and decor is super cool, the staff was not only extremely friendly, but helpful in making suggestions for what food and drink we may like. The food options were delicious, as were the drinks, and it was hard to choose what to get! They charge $34 for bottomless mimosas with lunch which is not bad at all. We were visiting from Boston, but we will absolutely be coming back here the first chance we get!",,,
173,Courtney M.,"Old Bridge, NJ",110,33,6,5.0,3/6/2017,"Best bottomless brunch in NYC... they let you take advantage of the 2 hours and you never feel rushed by the staff.. the food came out so fast and was delicious. Most bottomless places try to get out of the door after your food is finished, but not here... I recommend getting the first reservation at 11am to avoid having to wait!",,,
174,Lynn C.,"Martha's Vineyard, MA",21,311,364,3.0,2/15/2016,This place was ok. Very cute on inside. I went for a boozy brunch and had made a reservation for one. I was there about 20 min before waitress acknowledged me even though the party of 4 who was seated after me got drinks served first. I ended up w a ham and Brie omelet and a few mimosas. Hard to mess up an omelet. I think it would have been better for happy hour.,,,

I ate here on Dec. 23rd, and forgot my card. I came back hours later and the bartender asked for my license. She took my taken my address and zip code. On Dec. 24th there were $500+ charges on my card online. I have called multiple times asking for the manager. He/she is always too ""busy"" or not at the restaurant. I already reported the restaurant to bank and made police report. Bunch of crooked people at the crooked knife. Be warned!!It could've been a red head or blonde. With the lighting in the bar who knows. She was behind the bar midnight on Dec 24th. I went back to get my card and she asked for my ID. It sucks that you responded to me now! I have been calling your restaurant since Saturday and you were always busy or away. I talked to cops and we all don't believe in coincidences.

The Chicken Pot pie was good too, creamy but next to the brussels sprout it has no chance. Happy Hour till 8. $5 wine and mix drink, $4-$6 for beer, but you already know that from their website.

They also got one of our orders wrong and the server didnt ask me how i liked my steak cooked in my sandwich and disappeared so i gave up trying to find him (i like rare... it came out medium but I still ate it)For such an empty place the food took a legitimate 40 minutes to appear.I wont be back, there are other places to go to even if the wait is longer.",2,1,

182,Sol G.,"Woodside, NY",2,5,10,3.0,4/24/2017,"I really want to give this place 2.5 stars but yelp doesn't give me that option. I'll start off with praises: the food is delicious, our waitress consistently filled up our empty pitchers of mimosas, and the music was great. I had the Creme Brulee French Toast which was fluffy in the middle and slightly caramelized on the outside. I had a bite of the salmon cakes which were so delicious. The mimosas were the perfect balance of champagne and orange juice, made up a tad more of champagne (perfect for bottomless brunch). but unfortunately, they had a security guard who had no idea what he was doing. He made people line up outside when the place was clearly empty, he didn't allow people to enter (I had a reservation and my party had already been seated inside). My friend came outside to get me off the ""line"" (6 people) because we had reservations and our party had already been seated. Please note, that the place was not packed yet, there was not a significant line and there were only two or three parties already seated inside, so there was no reason for him to be causing such confusion. It was so bad that the manager had to step in and manage the entrance and get things under control. Also, someone literally had an explosion of their bowels in one of the stalls of the women's bathroom and it stayed that way for the two hours we were there. Overall, the food and mimosas are good which is why I gave this place three stars but there are better places that provide a much more well'rounded pleasant brunch experience.",2,,

When I asked her how the chicken burger was, she replied ""We're famous for our burgers."" A recommendation like that always has me sold, however when the ""Chicken Burger"" Came, it was not a chicken burger at all. It was a fried chicken cutlet in between a greasy bun. As far as Irish Pub food goes, I guess it was ok, but I was left wanting more.",,,

Updated review","I have frequented Crooked for the last several years and though it never disappointed I can say it is now better than ever. Chef Robert has really pumped up the menus to incorporate a great bar menu, solid lunch and dinner options, soup specials while maintaining their famous brunches.  I have hosted brunches, HHs and birthday celebrations and I would highly recommend for all.",,,
192,Moira C.,"Manhattan, NY",223,108,45,5.0,12/7/2015,"I came to The Crooked Knife this past weekend for a late brunch with a party of 11. Like I said it was a late brunch, so we had no problem being seated. For $34.99 there were many great food options and unlimited bloody marys or mimosas. I had the eggs florentine and they were cooked to perfection. The brunch crowd was fun, and lively, probably due the the 2 hours of unlimited drinks, but for the most part not too out of control. The music was a great mix of throwbacks jams and definitely a crowd pleaser. This place gives off a warm, eclectic, & homey vibe.Justin our server was wonderful! He was attentive and made sure that our experience at The Crooked Knife was the best it could be. It was my birthday and he made sure that I always had a full Bloody Mary. He even brought out a brownie with a candle and had the restaurant singing Happy Birthday. Much appreciated Justin!",,,

194,Evan S.,"Bronx, NY",66,191,13,3.0,5/14/2014,"Went here for a bottomless brunch, and had just that. I think it was 30 bucks for an entree and a choice of bellini /mimosa's (basically the same thing no?) or bloody mary's (extra spicy/extra vodka for me). Slightly bummed about bottomless, because I always equate that to shitty watered down drinks, but to my surprise they did the trick, and did it quite well. Not only that but the waitress was prompt about refilling our drinks and towards the end of the brunch was just giving us pitchers. I ordered a burger and fries in anticipation of the day ahead of me. they were both delicious and the fries came in a mini fry basket which was cool. There was a bit of a wait when we got there but that's to be expected at an all you can drink brunch. would return.",1,,1
195,Noella C.,"Dallas, TX",354,408,57,3.0,11/7/2015,Pretty good place for brunch. I had the Irish breakfast. It was cool. There was something on the plate called black and white pudding.

196,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,3.0,1/14/2014,"Somewhat on the fence about this venue, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it was my first try. The atmosphere, while charming and original, felt also a big mishmosh. The mood is super energetic. The crowd, mostly hip, young people. The food was great, however, service was nearly non-existent. There is just a need for some finer tuning. I could see it being a hit or miss for most first-timers. On a Saturday afternoon, the venue was packed. Though, there was no line for a table except for a couple standing before me. I was seated about 5 minutes after arrival while waiting for my guest to arrive. As I sit and wait, waitress magically disappears, leaving me without a menu and without a glass of water. In the interim of waiting, there was plenty to look at in terms of the surrounding decor. Tin pressed ceilings, a (non-operating) fireplace, exposed brick wall, a conglomerate of framed quirky images decorate and add charm to the entire place. There is no shortage of tables and seats. They provide many long, communal tables that are just great for groups. Not the greatest of restaurants to have intimate, quiet conversations as noise level was high and the layout of the place is somewhat all over the place. My guest arrives, and it is perhaps 15 minutes until someone has recognized we were both sitting there without menu in hands. Eventually, a different waitress comes over. Their brunch menu is a one page menu with selections that sound more or less appetizing, but you'll find mostly typical brunch items. I chose one of their omelettes -- The Cure, filled with brandied mushrooms, ham, and brie, which comes with a side of fresh fruit, bacon, and home fries. I also made an order of Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary was legitimately all vodka. Not bad for getting an afternoon buzz, otherwise, not the most tasty Bloody Mary either. In spite of our waitress doing constant disappearing acts, our food surprisingly arrived in a timely fashion. I enjoyed the omelette, and the presentation was rather nice. There was no skimping of the brie, but I didn't note too much ham in the omelette. The side of fruit was actually fresh. Home fries were nothing to write home about, yet still a good side to have. I have to say that the food wasn't all too bad. Hasty servers and non-existent service is really what killed the overall experience.Other than the spotty service, I'd consider a return. The food was generally good, alongside its presentation. Can't speak for dinner hours, but The Crooked Knife carries the energetic and vibrant mood for some great weekend brunch. The atmosphere feels a bit cluttered, so it's not a very intimate spot. I believe they also offer unlimited Mimosas and Bloody Marys for $25, if you are feeling the need to be ultra boozy. I'd say that's another good reason to return.",3,2,2

198,D L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,189,0,3.0,6/24/2017,"I go to this Crooked Knife every 8 weeks or so with my classmates. We attend a sign language school down the block and like to go at the end of each session for a drink, a bite & to chat in ASL.We tend to get the same waiter, George, who is a lovely, efficient guy who doesn't speak any sign language but always respects what we're doing & tries to learn signs when he can to be able to communicate with the Deaf members of our group & the hearing members who are simply trying to improve our skills. I don't know whether George is the only server who is willing to do it or if he volunteers, but we usually get him.In fact, most of the staff is very nice. The one exception is a manager, a woman (heavy-set, as my grandmother would say, with brown hair & a permanent scowl) who I have spoken to exactly 3x & all 3 times she was a rude witch with a capital ""B"" who has no business being in customer service. The last time I was there, I performed ""advance"" for my group, going in on a  Thursday when the restaurant side was virtually empty. I explained what we were doing & that we would like a table that is sort of round & well-lit so everyone could see each other & chat in ASL. There were exactly TWO occupied tables in the entire place & yet she snapped at me that she needed to know exactly how many people we were expecting and whether other classes besides mine were going to be there. When I said I didn't know anyone else's plans, but we had 6-8 people in my group, she snapped that, ""We have to know because we can't have people going wild in here."" 'Cuz, yeah, those ASL students & their teachers, who are in there ALL THE TIME & never cause a problem of ANY KIND are ... doing what? In an empty room, no less. I don't know. Causing a problem how? I don't know. As I said, I join in these things all the time & have never once felt embarrassed by my groups' behavior or any individual's behavior. Some of the staff even count themselves among the friends of the school staff.I was flabbergasted & all I said was, ""Well, we certainly don't want to put anyone out --"" waiting for her to realize I was telling her to shut her yap & act like a professional. She did not get it. In fact, she was rude AGAIN that night.So, if I had a choice, I would no longer go here. And, if I have any input, my classes will not go there. When my classmates get together without the teachers, we never go here. We pick somewhere we feel completely welcome.",,,
199,Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",269,745,79,3.0,7/27/2014,"The service here blows which is why I am giving Crooked Knife 3 stars - but could easily be a 4 based on the food. Came here for boozy brunch ($29 one entree and unlimited adult bevs) and it wasn't packed around noon, but I would recommend reservations closer to the 1 o clock hour. Atmosphere here is really cute, from the quirky wallpaper to loungey leather booths and couches. Music is Top 40. We got our drink and brunch orders taken quickly but unfortunately that's where the service stops. We rarely got our glasses filled which is disappointing considering you only have 2 hours to drink your unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and bellinis. Eventually we just requested a pitcher for our table to save them the trouble. Considering that most of the entrees were in the $13-15 range, the drinks package is a good deal. I got the ""healthy"" omelet which came with more bacon, toast, home fries, and fruit. It was delicious and the portion size was perfect to fill me up and absorb some of that alcohol. There was a very good proportion of Swiss cheese to the other fillings. Bf and friend got eggs Benedict which also looked really good! Came with fruit and home fries.All in all, solid boozy brunch choice in the city and more likely to have last minute reservation openings than Calle Ocho and the like. Worth the stop by!",,,1
