0,Daphne T. C.,"New York, NY",0,45,29,5.0,11/12/2018,"Not your standard conference food, the turkey Cobb salad was fresh, fresh, fresh -- and chilled! Impressive for food at a meeting space.The desert was a prefect portion; you're at a business meeting, no one wants a full size cheesecake! Here, it's served with a super tiny spoon and just 2-3 mouthfuls!",,,
1,Eric B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",186,11,0,5.0,9/16/2018,"My company recently hosted our annual conference here and Convene was the perfect event space. The venue was very clean, there was plenty of space and the location was PERFECT. One block from the Rockefeller Center stop on the E, B, D, F & M trains. The refreshments served at the nourish stations are a plus!",,,
2,Cher W.,"Merrick, NY",18,149,58,4.0,10/29/2017,My company had a 2 day conference here. It was terrific. Good tasting healthy foods. Great service and conference facilities. We could have used more women's bathrooms.,1,,1
3,Leala V.,"Brooklyn, NY",255,346,614,5.0,5/3/2017,"I went to a free Oracle event here recently.I was impressed by the organization and professionalism demonstrated by the staff. There was little confusion of where I needed to be and when.They kept the snack, coffee and soft drink area fully stocked most of the day although some of the really popular items would run out at some of the locations.The best was the breakfast and lunch that they provided. The food was some of the best free catered food I have ever had. I only wish they had more stand-up tables so I didn't have to awkwardly eat my lunch against a wall.At the very end they had a beer and wine reception and they didn't seem to care how many times they had already served you...they did close as scheduled though ;)If I was a fancy company wanting to impress a bunch of people I would certainly hire these guys for my event. Very well done!",,,

I attended a two day conference at this venue, which is extremely convenient and roomy.The staff is wonderful, from the greeter downstairs to the folks attending to the food and drink stations. All the meals and snacks were fantastic.Kudos to the operators of this venue, I would book for my organization.",,,1
