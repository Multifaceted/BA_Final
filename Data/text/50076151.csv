The ambience is great everyone is partying and having fun. In the mist of all the hustle and bustle during brunch time the service /waiters are yet so attentive. If you're coming to New York this is something you want to experience especially the brunch time , which starts at 4 ! Yes expect to spend a lot and I mean a lot of money here !!! It's almost laughable but in return you get one heck of an experience. I tried the truffle pizza and boy was it delicious !! The drinks are great too !! Now for dinner it's a little different , I personally don't think it's as crazy as brunch , so if you don't want the heavy party mode ambience come for dinner. Would I come here again !? Yes ! It's a great experience during brunch and lovely for dinner! #stephaniemoscoso #stephaniemoscosoreviews",4,1,3

2,Elda P.,"Central Islip, NY",11,69,135,5.0,7/15/2018,"Bagatelle was such an amazing NYC brunch experience ! The vibe, the food, the service and the place was all phenomenal! We had such a fun time! We ordered the 245$ jug of sangria, it was def a good time. The food was so delicious omg, the steak and eggs literally melted in your mouth and the burger was yummy along with the yummy fries. We tried the pancakes too which were HUGE! You can definitely share that entree for two. The music started at 3 and the curtains were shut and that's when the party began! Dancers came out, people in costumes with bottle service and theme music omg what a blast! Music was great and I honestly think it was the best brunch event ever! Will definitely be back again at the end of the summer :) It is def pricey but so worth it. Do it at least once for a birthday or a special event ! Thanks bagatelle for such a fun time !",1,,
3,Bianca F.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5,39,44,4.0,7/10/2018,"Best Boozy Brunch in New York City!What starts as a classy, New York Style brunch turns into an epic day party that has you walking out into daylight almost shocked that it's not passed midnight.If you're going to Bagatelle, you're coming for the party, not the food. While the brunch menu has some great items, it's not the best food I've had in NYC. However, I would highly recommend getting some carbs in for what turns into a long day of partying. All French cuisine, the food is extremely rich in flavour - which isn't for everyone.Highly recommend the Long Island Ice Tea punch (with the straws - ask!) - it's the best bang for your buck and very generous with alcohol. The Rosé Sangria is also a delicious punch to order as well.Note: When booking reservations for tables, they may tell you that there is a time limit associated. Upon arrival, if you speak to the captain of the day (and pending they're not that busy) - they are very accommodating.Also, be sure to book 30 days in advance if possible. Reservations for tables go fast.",1,,2
4,Sybil S.,"Chappaqua, NY",1,77,12,5.0,9/25/2018,"As a FAB celebration destination, this is the BEST. Crazy decadent food, endless dance music, party people visit from all over the world. You simply must experience this place for the full fun NYC experience!",,,
5,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",554,554,1772,4.0,12/26/2017,"Great brunch, great service, great location so get ready to spend money when you go here! - expect to spend at least a hundred dollars per head.This place is larger than life! I had the fortunate experience to go here for their European inspired brunch extravaganza!!! Boy or boy was it worth it?!! -Boozy Brunch on another level.I had the Beef Short Rib Croissant with scrambled eggs and potatoes. For the table, we ordered a Champagne Sangria to share, which was delicious!!! The food was as memorable as the overall experience at Bagatelle.  The banana cheesecake was just right. The combination of a lovely aesthetically appealing venue and the way the venue changes into a day party was a fun experience all around.Definitely a unique experience worth trying at least once!!",10,5,9
6,Tori L.,"Covington, KY",162,54,65,4.0,1/19/2018,"I wish I could give Bagatelle to different ratings: one before 3pm and one after 3pm. TOTAL 360. But by first impressions, they didn't seat us for our reservation for almost 30 minutes...With the lights on, this place is a swanky European bistro. The food is top-notch and all you could want from a brunch. Our table of 8 shared a massive cocktail pitcher with a bajillion crazy straws, which carried us through the transition of closing the curtains, the bar filling to the brim with club-goers, and bringing out the DJ until the lights dropped--along the bass! With the lights off, be ready to fist pump while you chew.Although honestly not totally my style, going to this brunch club is a great one-of-a-kind NYC experience! Just be warned: prepare to spend SO MUCH money and watch out for the firey champagne-wielding two-headed waitstaff ;)",3,,2
7,Kimberly P.,"New York, NY",336,64,40,4.0,9/29/2018,Was taken here during their restaurant week for dinner and the food/service was phenomenal. They staff was attentive and each dish that came out was cooked and seasoned to perfection. By the time dessert came around I was completely satisfied and stuffed with goodness. Honestly we ordered so much food I forgot everything. I just remembered their mushroom dish and tartare appetizer were to die for. Definitely come here for dinner instead of brunch.,,,2
8,Brittni D.,"New York, NY",341,65,129,3.0,1/21/2018,This place is a blast to celebrate any occasion.  I went for my birthday. I booked a month in advance for 6 people. The secret to getting a reservation is on a Saturday is to call and book or go directly to their website. You can't book on Saturday's on open but you can directly from their website. The dj is so talented. He performed saxophone solo that was just absolutely amazing.  The service was slow but the staff was polite and helpful so it made up for this shortcoming. The food was not great. Looks better than it tastes. Do not order the lobster roll- disgusting ......the strawberry margarita bowl is yummy...the crab cake is one ill re order.They perform special shows for tables the purchase bottle service . The cost for this is laughable. $1700 to $2200 - I recommend riding on the coat tails of another table that gets the service.,1,1,1
9,Nadia S.,"Jericho, NY",231,143,811,3.0,2/2/2018,"This review is for both the food and the atmosphere. If I were to rate just the food, I'd give Bagatelle a solid 4 Stars. The waiters are really nice and attentive, even with the hustle and bustle of brunch. But the crowd (try hards) and the music brought down the experience for me... though it is a truly New York experience and something I recommend you try if you're visiting. Plus, the food is GOOD. I ordered the poached eggs with smoked salmon on avocado toast. Was cooked well but could have used a little seasoning or hollandaise sauce. The matcha French toast looked a little unsettling because of all the whipped cream and the green matcha, but it was actually QUITE delicious. Super soft but not undercooked and just flavorful and sweet. I would definitely order it again. The XXL pancake was a little dry, but not bad -- not a traditional pancake --- more of a sweet bread. And the truffle pizza was great. But the music here for Sunday brunch is super redundant (and this could just be my tastes). They play a lot of  EDMish beats with and an MC (though he has a nice voice) chimes in here and there to sing some lyrics and makes shout outs.... felt kind like a bad Bar Mitzvah.",,1,1

We got compensated with a round of free drinks so that was nice.Once we finally got to our table, it definitely got lit. The food was actually pretty good. I got the crispy chicken sandwich while my friends tried the gnocci, pizza, pasta, etc. Service here is questionable, but get a few drinks in you and you'll stop caring lol4 pm is when the real party starts and they start all their little ""shows"". They close the curtains, turn off the lights, and let you start dancing on the chairs. Definitely something every New Yorker needs to experience at some point!The",1,,
14,Eric Joseph D.,"San Francisco, CA",1737,372,957,4.0,8/16/2017,"Celebrated my 25th Birthday here with a CRAZY ASS brunch with a group of friends and here was the damage:7 Bottles of Moet/Champagne Showers directly in our mouths - ~$1,500Semi-Tasty yet Bougie Food that held up our liquor - ~$300Huge Tubs of Mojito with crazy straws - ~$400Tip for our waiter (who was dancing with the girls in our party) - ~450Having the time of our lives and doing crazy a$$ shit for the rest of the night = PRICELESSFor about 3-4k, our group drank and ate like the good old college days. This brunch should not even be called a brunch, it should be a freaking day club! Everyone was wearing club attire, champagne was flowing everywhere, and food was less of the priority. Once it hit 3pm,the blinds went down and the lights were off and people were dancing all over the table, my shirt was soaked with champagne and vodka, one of the girls in my group had the top of her romper off and was freaking with our waiter, and EVERYTHING JUST GOT CRAZY. They even have special themed music and people in costumes that come out for when bottles come out. Imagine Jasmine and Aladdin coming with a huge bottle aka magic lamp on a magic carpet with a whole new world playing. Shit was insane. I highly suggest for people to try this ONCE IN THEIR LIFE. You will for sure drop a lot of $$$ when you come here, but it's worth being bad and bougie and douchey for once. And also, I suggest wearing sunglasses when you leave at around 5/6 ish because you will be blinded that it is still daytime!",41,31,37
15,Mitra M.,"New York, NY",34,63,36,4.0,8/26/2018,Excellent service! Amazing food! I tried the steak and Eggs! The steak was really really good! But unfortunately I found hair in the eggs which I was shocked to see that! We ordered the something decadence; it was a huge platter with waffles and fruits. In the description it said we would get donuts and marmalade but we didn't get any of those and I was full of waffles and pancakes! It's good for like a party of 5-7! I was expecting more on the platter for $85!! The weekend party starts after 3pm and is a lot of fun. But make sure to make reservations in advance.,,,
16,Tori W.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",500,118,91,2.0,2/25/2018,"I ate here on my first night in NY before going out with friends. I do not come to NY much, so I trusted my friends' opinions when they said this place was good. It was a Thursday night and they were blaring bad 90s music; it was so loud I had to shout to even have a conversation with my friend! I did enjoy the visual atmosphere, they were playing an old movie on a projector and the decor was nice. We ordered pizza, risotto, truffle gnocchi, and chicken. Everything was very subpar. If I had to choose the truffle gnocchi was the best dish but still ehhh I've had better.",4,3,3
17,Yahaira M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,133,261,2.0,7/23/2018,"The only thing this place has to offer is the location and good service(servers). The food needs alot of work. The brunch menu is extremely basic for an expensive restaurant . Everything we ordered was either flavorless or basic, could have stopped anywhere to eat. Also they rush you out of your take after two hours. I was extremely uncomfortable and surprised that this could be allowed. My family and friends all felt extremely unwelcomed. My family brought me a cake and since we were rushed out of our table, we had to take it with us to the next spot. However they threw my box out and so they created a cardboard box, this I was offended by but also greatful that they tried since I didn't want to have to carry my cake out without a box. Overall this place needs a whole new menu update and the time limit needs to be cut off especially when people are spending money.",2,,
18,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",177,136,573,2.0,8/20/2017,"I had quite the experience here.My friend and I came for restaurant week. We both got the crab salad, the Australian wagyu and the crème brulee. The crab salad was very refreshing but right afterwards we realized we were never offered bread. We asked the waiter for it and they brought the bread over to our table. As he set the basket down, he asked if we wanted the butter cheese. I asked, ""Does it usually come with cheese?"" He said, ""Yes."" So I asked him to bring it. The bread was amazing! But I thought it was strange that we had to ask for it and again separately for the cheese. Isn't it supposed to be complimentary? I knew from other people's photos that they received it too. Did the restaurant just assume we didn't want any? The Australian Wagyu was average. It wasn't particularly exciting. The best part of the dessert was actually the cookie. Midway through dessert, a little mouse peaked through the bushes along the edges of the restaurant. Apparently the waiter knows that they're a common sighting. So beware, if you don't want to see any small creatures, sit inside!",2,1,1

21,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",639,413,1077,3.0,5/16/2017,"I've heard most people come here for the party, so it was an interesting first experience for me to come here on a Sunday night (particularly on Mother's Day also). There were only about 5 other tables seated when we went. Lights dimly lit, no crazy DJ or loud disco music spinning around (although they did give us a tease of what the real party is like towards the end of our meal). Surprisingly the dining area is small. It's two stories, the downstairs is fairly big where the bathrooms and kitchen is. The quinoa is yummy, comes with some greens, sliced radish, and a crunchy nut inside which adds some great texture to the quinoa. It tastes fresh, I think because of the citrus that goes into it. The pesto gnocchi is alright. A little too soft for my taste, I like it to have some chew to it. But I also got spoiled from having the best gnocchi throughout Italy so I'm very biased when it comes to this stuff.The burrata tomato salad was HUGELY recommended by our server and I really didn't think much of it??? If I were to describe it, I couldn't really say much more than it tasted like diced up tomatoes with cheese. Your meal comes with these mini baguettes but the melted butter concoction that comes with it is really worth a try. I can't remember what was in it (I wanna say pesto/garlic). (An insider told me the menu needed some work. I also agree.)My favorite plate was the meat dish that came with cod, risotto, vegetables, these AMAZING garlic rosemary potatoes, and two sauces I didn't care much for (didn't think it was needed with how seasoned everything else is). But if you're going to pay $160 for this I'd obviously expect it to be good. The birthday dessert (?) idk what you call it, costs ~$50 and it's an enormous mound of whipped cream, which almost two pints of vanilla and chocolate ice cream underneath. Sprinkled with brownies and a cookie along the rim. Nothing special really, nothing stood out. Again, people probably like to order this because a sparkler comes with it and it's fun? The pistachio, strawberry sorbet dessert also didn't blow me away. The tart that came with it was very hard to chew, kind of tasted stale. Haven't been here for the party, but if they know how to throw a fun time, it would be the perfect overall experience if they could combine that with amazing food!",3,1,1

We had couple of cocktails n they were strong, hence premium liquor. We had as our fist course, the salmon croquette which was to die for. Then we proceeded to have the whole rotisserie chicken with truffle, mash potato, n eggplant which came out as tempura eggplant delicious. Our water spoke french n was n congratulated us on our 1st wedding anniversary. Overall a  good experience.. the reason y I'm giving them4 stars bc at first the host greeted us in a terse manner.",,,
23,Amisha P.,"Southington, CT",0,20,44,3.0,7/13/2018,"Overpriced but fun. We went on a Saturday brunch at 11:30... didn't leave until 4pm. It's a one time experience but honestly soooooo over priced. Be ready to spend at least $100 per person and that's actually a modest number. The food is okay. The best part was the pizza... remember this is supposed to be a French restaurant. Once 2pm hits, if gets nuts in there. Fun times as long as you can find some space to stand at the over crowded bar. Bartenders are fun and easy on the eyes! My husband complained Cus it was all male wait staff and bartenders. The two female employees were the hostesses. Lol!",,,
24,Jennifer Z.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",67,9,3,1.0,4/15/2018,"Beautiful restaurant. HORRIBLE service. Came here for brunch after New Year's and I have never experienced worse service in my life. I absolutely understand when a restaurant is busy or understaffed, a wait can't be avoided and that's fine. But sitting in a near empty restaurant FILLED with servers standing around cracking jokes and chatting at the bar while you wait ages to be given your bill, or a refill on water/coffee is unacceptable. I'm thoroughly convinced that 90% of the workers are paid to sit around and look attractive while the other 10% actually do work. Food was alright, but nowhere near justifies the service, especially at the price you pay. There are so many other amazing options in NYC- skip this one.",4,2,1
25,Priscila R.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",40,68,176,3.0,11/7/2017,"Sigh... this place is great if you're looking to have a LIT Party style brunch. First off came here for my coworkers bday reservations were for 2pm, waited an entire hour to actually be seated. Second-drinks are too overpriced. You must come here halfway lit already or you'll have to settle for overpriced drinks that are watered down with a ton of ice. Third- the food was not THAT great. I had a burger and it was really good but I also tasted my friends lobster Mac and it was ehhh I've had better. & finally the vibe was really fun! The music was great & the staff was VERY entertaining. So again if you're looking to have a lit brunch deff come here if you're looking for more of a quiet brunch --stay away. Def think this place can do better in the food & drink area considering the prices, will def comeback for a good time",2,,
26,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,10/1/2017,"I had heard about the amazing brunch at Bagatelle...and finally made it here on a recent Saturday. The place was empty when we came in, but bumping by the time we left - packed, standing room only by the bar, loud music playing, lots and lots of large groups celebrating with giant containers of cocktails with multiple straws. My group was probably the tamest in the whole restaurant and the most under-dressed. Who knew girls would wear sparkly cocktail dresses and louboutins and show up for breakfast on a Saturday am??! It is meatpacking after all - perhaps that's the dress code. Bagatelle's brunch did not disappoint. A few of us ordered the Eggs Bagatelle, which was delicious - smoked salmon, avocado, croissant and came with a side salad. Mimosa was ok. We were sat at a nice circular table and had a pleasant server who was patient with our splitting the bill. All in all, a good experience to have at least once here at Bagatelle, though my minor complaint would be the loud music made it really hard to have a conversation.",3,2,5
27,Fra M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,0,1.0,4/23/2018,Came here for a bday brunch. When they dare to ask $10 for a bottle of SPRING WATER you know it will be a rip-off and for what...? Service's slow.

29,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,390,4425,4.0,2/23/2017,"I finally had the pleasure of trying this place with a friend during this Winter Restaurant Week that just passed recently. I loved the fancy and elegant interior. The dining room was filled with pretty, dainty chandeliers and impeccably set tables with candles, glassware and Bagatelle's own olive oil jar. We were served mini baguettes with yummy herb flavored butter doused in olive oil. The bread was very good: Fluffy with crunchy outer crust. For my appetizer, I ordered the Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas (which was + $4 and worth it). The gnocchi was homemade and came with truffle sauce and parmesan. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked with melt in my mouth buttery consistency. The truffle and pesto sauce was intensely flavorful and plentiful. It was tough trying to decide on the Main Course, but finally selected tue Saumon Grille Suace Aioli a l'Encre de Seiche, which was grilled salmon filet with quinoa and cauliflower, along with squid ink aioli sauce that was artfully dotted and spread on the sides of the plate. I must admit, this entree was plated beautifully, however the portion size was quite small. The filet of salmon was little and there wasn't much quinoa underneath. Also, there was only one piece of cauliflower. The taste of the salmon was wonderful though. I enjoyed the crispiness of the skin, the fresh flavor and how well seasoned it was. The squid ink was also good and had a mayonnaise-like taste to it. Dessert was chocolate mousse with toasted pecans and salted chocolate cookies. It was absolutely delicious! There was a delightful array of chocolate balls, brownie pieces, pecans, biscuits and cookies on top of the rich, creamy, sweet, smooth and decadent dark chocolate mousse. All the ingredients mingled together beautifully. I also got to try some of my friend's sorbet which came with raspberries and blueberries. There were three flavors of sorbet: Raspberry, Mango and Lemon. My favorite was the raspberry, then mango. All very light and refreshing.Our waiter was both charming and handsome, as well as friendly with a great sense of humor. He was knowledgeable about the menu and attended to all our requests effortlessly. I had a stand out meal here and a lovely, relaxing time, soaking up the luxurious, yet comfortable ambiance and would definitely like to return to try the other amazing sounding menu items.",14,9,13

Only Negative comment I have is the SEAFOOD PASTA 1 STAR , which was bland and completed unseasoned! We had to request salt, pepper and parmesan cheese to try and salvage this flavorless dish. Otherwise,the burger , lobster Mac n cheese and large margarita was the bomb!! We will return again!! Just please Season the seafood pasta pleaseeeeee!!!",,,1
31,Jasmin J.,"Yonkers, NY",13,24,4,2.0,3/13/2018,"I went here for a brunch this past weekend with a group of friends. The food alone is at least 4.5 stars. Everyone at my table ordered something different (i.e. Burger, Gnocchi, Lobster Mac, Crabcakes, Disco Fries). Everything was delicious. The seasoning on the food is God-tier.However... My 2-star rating is strictly based on the service we received. Our 2:30 reservation was made a month prior to us being there. We had to wait an hour and a half to be seated. While we stood (uncomfortably, btw), we kept being pushed around very rudely by someone who I assume was management. As if it was our fault that we had no place to go. One thing about this place that we realized was, they absolutely do not stay true to their reservations, which is very unfair. They overbook, and then refuse to make people leave for other guests who planned to come there. I understand that people spend a large amount of money per table, but its inconsiderate to people who ALSO want to spend money, that are forced to stand for long periods of time, just to be rushed through their meal, so the restaurant can get them out in time to set up for dinner. I don't recommend this place for brunch. There are other restaurants that are way more organized, that will provide you the same exact experience. For dinner, however, I would hope this place has a different attitude, because I genuinely enjoyed the food and would love to have it again.",5,1,1
32,Jo S.,"Martlesham, United Kingdom",34,6,0,2.0,10/19/2018,"This place is so overrated. Yes the brunch is fun but only because it's good music and everyone's drinking. The food is average at best and the service (other than one waiter) is just rude. We booked a table at 2pm and were told our table would be lost if we weren't there at 2.15, fair enough. We arrived at 2pm and weren't seated until 3.15 with multiple tables who arrived after us being seated first. The table we were eventually given would have sat 5 people comfortably but we were 7 and were forced to sit in a crescent shape, the waiter couldn't even reach us with our food when the table next to us sat down we were so tightly packed in.",1,,
33,Kristen G.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,0,1.0,9/11/2018,"Hideous experience at this restaurant. I came for my birthday after making a reservation a month in advance. I informed the hostess that I'd been made to wait an excessive amount of time at my last visit, and didn't want to have the same issue. She assured me all would be well. Of course, when we arrived for our 3PM reservation, we were violently shoved around, ignored, and told to wait at the bar for an hour and a half. The food is great and the party is a lot of fun, but none of it is worth it because they don't honor their reservations. Until this changes I will never be back or recommend this place to anyone else.",,,
34,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,1/18/2017,"I can't comment on any of the ongoing allegations that Bagatelle has been dealt with lately, but what I will note is that when my (culturally diverse) group arrived here for dinner back in November, we had nothing short of a flawless experience with the staff and service. It was my first visit to the restaurant, as they're best known for their weekend brunch, and I have to admit that I left impressed with the quality and execution of their (mostly traditional) French dishes across the board.Coming with a large group meant that we were able to try a variety of dishes offered, including the light Ahi Tuna Tartare, which was served with an Asian-influenced Lime-Soy Vinaigrette, and complemented with a layer of creamy avocado. My preference lies, however, with the heartier starters; the pillow-y Truffle Gnocchi had an addictive black truffle pesto filling, a few slices of shaved black truffle, and maintained a surprisingly soft and fluffy texture and density. Even more impressively presented was the Truffle Pizza, which paired the mild Scarmoza cheese with Crème Fraiche, and finished the top with a generous amount of black truffle shavings.From the main dishes we tried, I would likely recommend that you order the Pan Roasted Chicken over the seafood dishes, if you have to make a choice. It may be entirely due to the fact that seafood is not my protein of preference (after all, I've only been eating it for the past few years...), but the Salmon and Halibut dishes we tried were fairly simply and traditionally prepared, and I found the salmon skin to be less than crisp and more on the soggy end. The Chicken, on the other hand, is impressively served in a large pan, and is whole-roasted with fingerling potatoes and, of course, black truffle shavings. The chicken was cooked to just the right tenderness, and retained both moisture and flavor, and the richness of the black truffle didn't overwhelm the taste. It's an ideal dish for a larger group as well, and was definitely one of the most memorable dishes of the night.Dessert is where Bagatelle really shines, however. The sheer meticulousness present in some of the dishes, like the Chouxchoux Caramel (caramelized miniature hazelnut chou puffs, milk chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce) is amazing, especially in contrast to their signature large format dessert - the ""Birthday"" Sundae. It's not listed on their official menu, but probably doesn't need any additional publicizing, as few haven't heard of (or tried) the mountain of vanilla ice cream, fudge brownies, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate and caramel syrup... and, of course, the finishing sparklers on top. Of course, you don't necessarily need to have a birthday celebration to order it, but I would recommend having upwards of 8 people in your group before attempting to make a stab at it; it's definitely not small nor light, but will completely satisfy any lingering sweet tooth.Don't let Bagatelle's Meatpacking location throw you off; the food here stays true to its French roots despite featuring a few modern touches and we never felt anything less than welcome within its walls.",18,5,13
35,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",356,275,181,4.0,2/5/2018,"Bagatelle is not the type of restaurant that I typically frequent.  Sure, I enjoy French/Mediterranean cuisine and copious amounts of rosé just as much as the next person, but more often than not, I'm having a 'fat girl' day and I'd prefer *not* to be surrounded by models and their entourage when I'm trying to get my grub on.  Even the employees at Bagatelle are flawless!  Or being sprayed by champagne during one of those infamous weekend 'brunch parties.'  Call me boring, but I'll take my omelette with a side of peace and quiet, thank you very much.  Hold the Hollandaise and the live D.J.  All of that being said, I recently enjoyed dinner at Bagatelle sans a live D.J. set and was seated a good two tables' distance from the next gaggle of young models.  It was quite a pleasant and delicious evening!  My point?  Bagatelle has something for everyone, even your grandparents me!  Just do your homework prior to your visit to make sure you're a) not about to walk in to a party (if that's NOT what you're looking for) or b) lack thereof (if that's NOT what you're looking for).     Tuna TartareWhile most versions of tuna tartare pale in comparison to Chef Jean Georges' famous rendition at Nougatine, Bagatelle's interpretation can stand on its own.  The trifecta of textures - ripe, buttery avocado, crispy and salty taro chips, and cubed pieces of fresh, ruby red-hued tuna - flirt so compatibly with one another that you will find yourself enthusiastically alternating between bites of tuna and taro - tuna and avocado - avocado and taro, etc. - kissed with a sweet and savory soy dressing. Gnocchi à la Parisienne There's gnocchi.  And then there's Parisian gnocchi.  Sounds way more fancy, right?  It is!  If you're familiar with a profiterole, the same dough is used to make Parisian gnocchi: pâte à choux.  Hint, there are no potatoes in the French version of this recipe.     I'm not going to go as far as to say that I prefer the French rendition to the Italian, but damn.  Nothing quite compares to these perfectly-cooked pillows of warm dough that effortlessly envelope the inside of your mouth with such a rich, savory 'carb elixir.'  Paired with a buttery cream sauce infused with a mild hint of truffle, the dish is finished with salty Parmesan cheese.  C'est magnifique!  Apple GalaThis is one of those dishes that, upon arrival, is so visually unexpected and artfully stunning that it takes your breath away.  Quite literally.  And best of all?  It tastes great, too!  I can't quite describe this masterpiece much beyond the notes on the menu: ""Mascarpone mousse, apple filling, white chocolate, sablé Breton, fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream.""  Bottom line: If you're down with apples and willing to shell out $16 for a dessert, then don't even think twice about ordering this Instagram-worthy morsel of edible art.",4,2,3
36,Richie S.,"New York, NY",127,3,0,1.0,2/6/2018,"Food was good and I ordered a bottle of wine suggested by my waiter. After paying for the initial check, my waiter had the audacity to come back and suggest I increase the amount I put down as a tip to be at least 20% including the price charged for the bottle of wine like he was the one who fermented it in the first place. Sir, you definitely do not deserve 20% of the price of a bottle for just grabbing, uncorking and pouring it in a glass.The fact that he was petty enough to do this really annoyed me but I gave him his measly tip.Also, this establishment provides the calculated tip on your check. This tip value is based on the items you ordered but they also account for tip on the tax you pay which I see as a scam.",4,2,2

The best part was, the restaurant was empty at noon on a Saturday, so all the tables were free. I had just given birth a few weeks before and went there to celebrate and alas, I was shocked and surprised they would treat any families so horribly. All 3 staff members were rude and condescending. I would not recommend this place for any families or people who have parents period!",3,,

41,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1045,25545,4.0,2/1/2017,"Came here this week with my best friend for catch up dinner. She had been before and this was my first time. This place is gorgeous in an understated way. There are some really awesome pop art type posters hung and my personal favorite was the Captain America one I was facing. You wouldn't think a pricey French restaurant would be into displaying comic book posters on their walls...further proof as to why we shouldn't judge books by their covers, lol.As an appetizer we ordered (and shared) their Tartare de Thon which was composed of ahi tuna tartare, avocado salad and lime soy taro chips. This tasted super fresh and delicious. This comes in two portion sizes (small and large) and was perfect for 2 people to split.My friend ordered the cod meunière with fingerling potatoes, leek confit and trout roe beurre blanc. I got to try it and whole it was certainly delicious I did feel that the fish was a bit bland...but I also didn't have a ""composed tasting"", I just sampled the fish on its own.I ordered the filet mignon with their aligot. My steak was an 8 oz beef tenderloin cut and it came drizzled with a bordelaise sauce...Bordelaise sauce is a classic French sauce named after the Bordeaux region of France, which is famous for its wine. The sauce is made with dry red wine, bone marrow, butter, shallots and sauce demi-glace (thanks Google!), aligot is basically cheese-filled mashed potatoes from Aubrac. This wasn't my first time having aligot, but it was my first time having it paired with a steak. It was very rich, heavy and decadent...I finished the whole thing though and had to stop myself from licking the copper pan it came in clean.Overall we had an awesome time here. The menu is fantastic, the wine list is excellent (my rose was phenomenal) but I had to take 1 star off for service. There was a lot of waiting in between ordering, requesting water, etc. My critique may seem silly, but I hold establishments like this to a higher standard. I would definitely return to treat myself again though.",1,1,3

Updated review","Bagatelle, it's not just for brunch anymore!I had dinner here a few weeks ago and it was very swanky. This is where you want to bring someone if you're trying to impress them.The Special Octopus was cooked perfectly. It was very tender.  The Australian baby rack of lamb was so savory.I've never had Truffle Chicken before. It would have never have occurred to me to even combine those two things but it's so good. Truffle should be added to everything. The Mega Sundae was bomb. It's an overwhelmingly (in a good way) large vanilla ice cream sundae with brownie and cookie pieces in it. This is for groups only. Two people would not be able to come close to finishing it. Another thing I loved about Bagatelle is they have a selfie camera installed to the wall downstairs. I kept excusing myself from dinner to sneak downstairs to take selfies.",3,,1
43,Sumedha A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",174,4,0,1.0,6/22/2018,Great place and vibe but pathetic service. Not worth the money. Having been in the food industry for so long it's very disappointing when you don't beg value for your money. Loved the one is London but very disappointed with this one.,3,1,1
44,William S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,3.0,3/25/2018,"If you like your brunch rife with flashing red lights, champagne delivery models with heads like the Daft Punk disco balls, and a man banging a drum to the beat of booming dancehall tunes, perhaps Bagatelle is for you. I am not you, if that's the case. But when I went to Bagatelle for a late brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday, most of her crew seemed down with the idea. And by the end of my sixth (?!) glass of champagne -- bankrolled by my friend's generous boss -- I felt like Bagatelle was my kind of place, too. Champagne is a beast of a liquid, squeezed from the horn of Satan itself.Pros: Food! The gnocchi tasted like small dense clouds of flavor and love. The black truffle pizza had just the right amount of rare savoriness, even if it left trickles of grease running down my wrists. (This is New York, though; what would a slice be if not spewing oil from every orifice?) And the shaved Brussels sprouts appetizer tasted like a cross between a handpicked Caesar salad and a wise Italian grandfather's cacio e pepe. Mids: The atmosphere. I'm not sure what to think about Bagatelle. Is it supposed to resemble a circus? Did they film an episode of Real Housewives of the West Village here once? Am I just supposed to experience a mindfreak every time I walk through the front door? I felt a mix between the Copacabana of the early Nineties, a Fergie music video from the late Aughties, and Martin Shkreli's room upon entering. Don't ask me how I came to those conclusions. I just did.Cons: Again, do you like the gates of Hell opening in LED light form as you're trying to eat your lobster mac and cheese? I'm not sure how great of an idea that seems. I mean, sure, by the time you're on Chapter Eight of ""Mimosa: The Reckoning"" or your thirty-fifth sip of ""Strange Red Juice: Seriously, Ronaldo, What's In This Vase?"", you don't mind DJ Doctor Kevorkian screaming into the mic about a delegation from Azerbaijan getting served a magnum of Dom Perignon while the rainbow flashes before your eyes at seizure-inducing speed. Basically, Bagatelle is a b'nai-mitzvah party for wealthy young wanderlust chasers visiting Manhattan for business and pleasure, or for the NYC elite who have decided to throw caution to the wind and spend their rent money on overpriced bottles of bubbling white wine and deafness. To quote a picture hanging above the staircase to the bathrooms: ""WTF is Bagatelle?"" Indeed! Indeed.",,1,
45,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,4.0,1/27/2017,"Absolutely incredible experience at Bagatelle last night. I have been to Bagatelle Vegas - which is everything! But the NYC location is ever so slightly more everything. Bagatelle has a reputation of snootiness but we did not experience any of that. We had an 8pm reservation via Open Table. We were warmly greeted by the hostess, who said she could seat our partial party after we checked our coats, so we could order cocktails while we waited for the last person. The music, ambiance and atmosphere were classy and mild. No craziness... Yet. That came later. My friend was a little miffed they had no Prosecco or Lambrusco. I get it but this is a French restaurant and those are Italian wines. The drinks we ordered were all awesome, as well they should be for $10,000 each.The food was great but the portions were super small. It's cool, I knew what this was coming in. Think ""Beautiful People portions."" Friend calamari and the truffle gnocchi (omg the best thing!!!)  were great apps. For entrees we had Waygu served perfectly rare, scallops (two measly scallops? For an entree?! Come on...) and lamb shank. I tried the scallops and the beef and they were incredible.At 10pm, the party REALLY started and it was much more of a lounge than a restaurant, though the almost all the patrons were eating. The manager spoke French to me (swoon!) and gave our table a round of champagne. So classy!This spot is high end, and hits every amazing note.  When you go - be sure to dress to impress and nothing less.  I love the Bagatelle brand and I will surely be back.",1,2,1

The company you plan to be in at the restaurant.2. Your finances.If you do Bagatelle's brunch right, you'll be drunk before 3 pm, in the best of company, and your wallet will be in A LOT of pain. There's not much else to say that hasn't already been said. This place is expensive and a little douchey (cue the house music and lights). However, the food was surprisingly good and the service for the most part was on point.

47,Chris P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",164,44,40,4.0,7/18/2017,"My brunch experience at Bagatelle was by far the most unique brunch experience of my life! I ordered the Braised Beef Short Rib Croissant which was incredibly delicious and a very healthy sized portion. However, the food is only the beginning. At about 3:00pm the blinds close, and the casual brunch becomes a Euro nightclub! Flashing lights, dancing, and bottles delivered to tables with sparklers and by people dressed as various artists (Prince, Brittney Spears, Michael Jackson to name a few.) My friends and I indulged in several bottles of rosè. We stayed at Bagatelle from 11:30am until brunch ended at 6:00pm!!If going to Bagatelle just for the food, it's a bit overpriced even for NYC. That's why I only gave 4 stars. However, if you're interested in a boozy, one-of-a-kind brunch, then Bagatelle is the place to be!",1,,1
48,Toni M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",220,84,20,4.0,7/11/2017,"If you are looking for a brunch time party.... Bagatelle is where it's at! My friend made reservations for us to come to Bagatelle while I was visiting. She said it's the ""boujee-est"" brunch spot in NYC- which she was right. This is a place where you have to make reservations for & have to be planning on spending a lot more than you average Sunday Brunch. As everyone else said, make sure that your whole party is with you or else they won't sit you when you arrive.We had reservations for 11:30- which are the first open reservations. The atmosphere is really cute & kind of old fashion & Parisian. I started with the ""Skinny B"" cocktail which was pretty good and refreshing! After that, we decided to get a bottle of Rose, since all 3 of us at the table were drinking. One bottle turned into 2, 2 turned into 3.... you get my drift. For my brunch, I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon on it. This was just OK- it was so very cheesy! My friend ordered the croque monsieur, this looked like the same thing as the grilled cheese but with ham. Chris ordered the braised beef short rib croissant- which was amazing! Overall, I gave Bagatelle 4 stars because of the experience! The food was just average and is probably something I could get better at another restaurant. But, at around 2:00, they closed all the curtains and it turned into a night club. This was truly a unique experience that I will always remember. If the prices were a little more wallet- friendly, I would love Bagatelle even more!",1,,
49,Cayla T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",420,420,754,3.0,1/7/2018,"I was attending the conference, BizBash, and the after-party took place here. The first floor is beautiful, very elegant and clean. Along the side wall were enormous booths. The bar is located along the back wall. There was an open bar with lots of alcohol to go around. However, the food was not as plentiful unfortunately. As soon as a plate of hors d'oeuvres would emerge from the steps, the plate was suddenly empty. So we had to start being strategic and waiting just by the steps for a server to emerge with a plate of deliciousness! No doubt, the hors d'oeuvres and desserts were very good and unique. It just wasn't enough to get full off of. I'd love to experience this place for a regular meal during the day.",1,,
50,Noelle W.,"Wallingford, Seattle, WA",167,10,0,1.0,6/2/2018,"Food is ok. If it was just food, 3 stars. One star because the hostess was EXTREMELY RUDE. One of those situations where she was clearly on a power trip. Don't come here expecting to be treated with any amount of basic respect.",2,1,1

Once you are settled in and the curtains close, it's like Euphoria! You're guaranteed a great time, the food was amazing the entertainment is everything and there was even a live drummer! My friends and I always have a blast when we attend.

55,Iris S.,"Miami, FL",99,9,2,1.0,5/2/2018,"I visited Bagatelle in New York once before and have visited the one on South Beach in Florida. This last experience is my last and final time. When visiting in February for my daughters 24th birthday I had the worst experience. The food was terrible and the service was horrible. From when we arrived at the restaurant the young lady at the front was rude. I believe it was due to our hispanic appearance, and this trendy place was not having it. I was going to leave, but my girls wanted to stay as we had made these reservations from Miami and they were looking forward to it. I asked to speak to the manager, and he came, we asked about Bottle service and he said after the two hour table limit we would be able to order bottle service, and I said perfect, I asked for the bottle service menu, it was not given to me. We began ordering the food, which was terrible, things came out wrong and basically we had to flag down the waiter because he never came around the table to check up on us. I believe when I visit a restaurant especially one of this $$$$$ I demand and expect exceptional service.  When it came time for the bottle service the waiter came up with a menu of a minimum of $3,000.00 for bottles. This had not been told to me previously. I expected to purchase 2 or 3 bottles, $600-700 each, but, of my choice. I was not told I was expected to buy that amount, specially not when I hadn't been advised of that. And, I specifically had asked for the bottle service menu before. I asked for the manager again, explained the situation, told him it was my daughters bday, explained the horrible service situation, told him we were visiting from out of town. He was also extremely rude. I could have very well stayed, I have no problem with economics. I told my daughter and friends we were leaving, I was not staying where there was no respect, terrible food and awful service, and racial tension. When I paid my bill I did not give any tip, I only gave tip to the poor bus boy, and I gave him $50 cash because he was the only one who merited anything at all. On my bill I wrote ""horrible service"" When I came back to Miami I called American Express to dispute the charge. When they sent my receipt they went so far to cover the part that said ""horrible service"", that is called ""fraud"" covering up their disaster. Luckily I had taken a picture of the receipt before I left the restaurant, and sent it back to Amex. Still dealing with this situation. Bagatelle you are well aware of your terrible service, your bad food and your horrible administration!  Shame on YOU! and I can't believe not a one  Administrative Team Member has reached out! Suggestion, when in NYC don't visit Bagatelle! If you know what good service, and good food is you will realize once you enter the door that you will not find it there. SHAME ON YOU BAGATELLE! covering up! Why didn't you send the right receipt, why did you cover my written message, because you know it was ""HORRIBLE SERVICE""!",2,,

I asked her again to repeat what she was saying and she gave me the loudest 10 second sigh on the phone. How rude. She then whispered in a low tone ""bitch"" and then loudly said ""BAGATELLE BAGATELLE I SAID BAGATELLE"". It's no wonder this restaurant have so many bad reviews.

Bagatelle Has such an Allison Wonderland kind of feel. Lights dancers costumes the whole nine. The music was fun and good to dance to when we walked in everyone was already in party mode. We got in around two and left when they closed at six it was a good party environment in the middle of the day.A couple things that kind of sucked were the fact that it was way over crowded. People constantly banging into you and knocking you are is kind of annoying in a bit of a buzz kill. Also once he will start getting drunk they start dropping glasses... You know how that goes watch your step or cut your foot. Other than that it's a fun place to be on a Saturday afternoon is your day drinking. Definitely one of those things where you keep your eyes open constantly to see what's going on.

Updated review","I have been to Bagatelle off and on many times over the years.  I was there this week for a dinner party and had a wonderful experience.  My past visits have been more of the day party variety, so a dinner party was definitely a new experience.  I really like the space.  It is all white and feels as though you are dining in an ocean side bistro in the South of France on the Riviera. And what an excellent experience it was.  From start to finish, everything was excellent.  We were seated and we asked to move as there was a large plant hanging over us.  No problem.  Moved immediately.  We ordered a bunch of things from the menu and shared around the table.  I have a seafood allergy, so I did not partake in the variety of seafood at the table, especially the shellfish tower.  That said, everyone raved about it.  I did have the truffle gnocchi and a tomato and mozzarella salad.  Both were excellent.  For our mains, we had a bunch of seafood entrees and a bone-in ribeye for two with roasted potatoes.  The steak was amazing as were the potatoes.  For dessert, we had a chocolate mousse, a few other items I can't remember, plus a massive ice cream sundae.  By massive, I mean huge.  It was enough ice cream for 10 people.To top all of it off, the service was excellent.  We were very well taken care of by the staff.  They were there when we needed them, but they were never hovering around the table or trying to rush us through the dinner.  I can't wait to go back!!",8,1,2

61,Rahul P.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,115,0,2.0,8/22/2017,"Bagatelle's vibe meets somewhere between Euro tourist trap and Jersey/LI bachelorette party crowd (complete with horrifying tans and skanky outfits - this Jersey boy would know!) and the occasional middle-aged man with an escort. It's an interesting place to people watch - this isn't old money, this isn't new money, this is more ""middle-class but desperate to portray a luxury life on social media"". the same type of people who think riding in UberBlack makes them royalty. On the one hand, the food is actually not bad at all - I went with the beef short rib croissaint and the beef was tender, well-flavored, and served with pretty decent sides. Not the best brunch ever, but if you've done a drunk brunch concept like Il Bastardo, you know the food can be akin to eating out of a trash can. The dining area is super-packed and the tables and chairs stay when they switch out the lights to pretend this is a nightclub. Then I witnessed have the most bizarre gimmick of all time - waiters dressing up in cheap costumes and being carried with sparklers to pour Dom Perignon Vintage into people's mouths and all over their clothes. The gimmicks continued - mediocre saxophonist and drummer, giant ""fishbowl"" style sangria with big colored straws. The whole vibe is super-trashy (right down to NYU kids coming to other tables to beg for a sip of champagne), yet somehow this place is so ""exclusive"".

The bar tender in an arrogant tone responded, ""just to let you know, we make our mimosas with REAL champagne""  OKAY - message received dude, you don't think we're willing to pay more than $7 for a breakfast beverage. I've read about how you put the ""uglies"" in the corner but being a fairly attractive not poor looking individual I didn't expect this treatment. Especially as I was sitting next to a woman in full blown night before make up, head to toe sequin outfit, barely holding it together at the bar.

63,Mandy E.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,62,441,5.0,10/20/2017,We have heard great stories of Bagatelle and the night did not lack in ambience. The service is top notch from start to end. I had the steak tartar on rice cakes which was a large portion enough to share. The tuna tartar was also a hit with the table. We moved on to the Rack of lamb prepared to medium rare which was absolutely perfect. My husband had the duck with the Asian flair and I like the flavor and it was a large portion that was very meaty. I prefer a fattier cut but for the healthy eater this is perfect. To end we tried three desserts but the favorite for me was a delightful passion fruit cheesecake which was served in a cup and actually had the flavor of cheesecake but much more delicious.  We know the party starts a little later as celebrities rolled in and sparkler filled champagne bottles were being served up. The fun club atmosphere is a must experience in NY.,1,,

However, I was there this past weekend for dinner and it was pretty average. The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The $49 dessert states in the menu that the pastry chef is to prepare it by your table. Someone from the kitchen appeared and stuck pieces of white chocolate into a ready dessert and drizzled it with caramel. Aside from the lack of presentation, it did not taste good.  The music which is usually great was horrible. Feels like this place lost its touch.",,,
65,Salome M.,"New York, NY",51,171,161,5.0,11/12/2017,"Bagatelle is always fun! This was my 3rd or 4th time here and everytime has been a blast. Came here for a friends bday a few years back and we were here from 1.30p to 6.30p. Just dancing and having such a good time. Yesterday was no exception. We didnt have reservations so they told us to come between 12.30 and 1 to get seated at the bar. We ordered the Avocado Tartine with poached eggs and disco fries to start. Ended the meal with the Truffle pizza which was DELISH! For drinks we ordered a bottle of rosé to start and then ended with a bottle of Bordeux. So it was a decadent evening filled with indulgences of food and beverages. They took away our stools about 3p as it becomes more of a club than a restaurant from 4p onwards so we continued standing by the bar and dancing and it was amazing. They dimmed the lights to nothing, dropped the curtains and it felt like any other club late at night. Its pricey. Approx $150 per person but what the heck! Its not everyday you party in the middle of the day. Totally recommend it to everyone atleast once.",,,
66,Melody T.,"Las Colinas, TX",651,725,3247,5.0,8/22/2017,"Jesus Lord take over the wheel! The best lunch I have every had in my life on a Saturday afternoon at 2PM. First off, don't think to bring a child here at 2PM on Saturday. This is an adult lunch, so find a sitter. Second of all, come dressed with all your style. Its some beautiful people in this placed ready to turn all the way up! Third, you sit close by to the tables next to you so that everyone can talk and get engaged! Which is at first weird but very quickly, its no. Fourth, prepare to spend a few hundred bucks real quick and the Fifth and final thing, once those curtains shut and the DJ starts blasting, its on! Oh it was bottles popping, drummers mixing, sparks flying everywhere and drink after drink after drink! So good for parties. Come open minded. When you leave, you maybe confused as to what just happened. I hear there is a long waiting list. So don't think you can get right in! Good luck with that. Also make sure to come bring your positive what to let loose energy to the spot! If you don't have that, stay your ass at home! #CHEERS",4,,5
67,Nancy L.,"New York, NY",487,38,109,4.0,4/17/2017,"In a nutshell: Bagatelle is a SUPER fun experience I would do MAX 2x a year. The champagne brunch is boozy, upscale, and definitely rowdy, but still classier than some other party brunch spots. Food is solid but I'd venture to say most of the weekend crowd isn't there for the food. Be prepared to spend $$$ if you go with a large group.",1,,
68,Peter D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",125,265,1,2.0,2/20/2018,"Got here a few minutes before my wife, and sat by the bar where I was pretty much ignored. She was a moment behind me, which worked out and prevented more awkwardness.We were seated in the rear area, which was clearly the spot for those there for restaurant week, and not fresh from the runway or between trips to Europe. Crowd was the sterotype you hear about - the euros sniffing derisively at everything, elitist families complaining about their table (especially those seated in viewing distance of us RW rabble, and - ""these tables are square, can we have it ROUND! [yes this was a discussion]), and of course the tables of models. Food was very good, the Scottish salmon was prepped to bring out the specific flavors and textures, tasted just as when I had it in Scotland last year. The Shaved Brussels sprouts were salty but not bad. The tuna tartar was very good. Wine list is extravagant, but I would go all out on a vintage at a place like Tribeca Grill, not here. Desserts were very good. Music was subpar and the artwork tried too hard. Waiters were ok. All in all $120+ for Restaurant Week 'value' and still we felt ripped off and unwelcome. There are numerous other places around the city that I have spent 2-3x as much and had a better experience. Will make the effort to never return.",3,5,2

I suggest making a reservation at least 3 weeks in advance as they tend to fill up quickly. We had the lobster mac and cheese and the truffle pizza for the group. Delicious...is an understatement. I had a reservation for 2pm and got there at 2:07pm, had to wait 20min or so for the table to be cleaned. We decided to do the small pitcher which was $185 but if you're an alcoholic lol maybe buy the big one that's around $400 b/c the small wasn't strong enough so we ended up ordering another one.

71,Maya G.,"Auburn, WA",27,75,78,4.0,8/22/2017,"Ok, so apparently Bagatelle has an awesome brunch. I however had dinner here so I can't speak to the brunch.However, I thought dinner was great! There was a group of 8 of us who came for dinner. We had a reservation so we were seated promptly when we arrived. The restaurant is a bit dark, but classy. The restaurant is definitely pricey  (25-40/entree) but lucky for my wallet we came during restaurant week. Personally, restaurant week can be hit or miss but Bagatelle did a great job. For my 3 courses I had crab salad with fennel and citrus dressing, truffle chicken with roasted root veg and creme brulee for dessert. All were delicious! And the portion sizes (especially the chicken) were good sized. Only reason this is 4 stars is because of staff. We had to wait about 10 mins longer than we would have liked to order, had to ask for bread, and waited some time for a check.And pro tip: if your wine connoisseur friend is choosing the wine for the evening be sure to give them a price point to stay below. Or at least ask how much it is before you order 2 more bottles. Your pockets will thank you, lol",3,,

They have an impressive list (both of champagne and wine) and the atmosphere of the restaurant is great. In the summer, nothing beats sitting outside with a bottle of champagne and people watching in this area. You are guaranteed to see a lot of interesting things. In the winter, the inside is very nice. Apparently Sunday brunches and weekend nights get pretty crowded so I try to avoid going at those times since I like a more leisurely experience.The staff is always friendly and helpful.

If you went there to eat I think it would be different because there were people sitting down, and I felt like everyone was staring at me because the bar was kind of i n the middle of everyone.

They couldn't find it at first but ended up seating us promptly . While the chicken was phenomenal I recommend eating before coming here as the service is extremely slow-more like chasing them to place orders and another 30 mins till you get the order. The only thing quick in this place is the music and dancing. Drink orders are hard to come by as well. They might want to staff up on the weekends but overall great ambience,,,

77,Alysha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,94,77,5.0,4/18/2018,"This 5 star rating is specifically for the brunch party because I've never been here for any other meal/occasion. If you're looking for an upscale wild club like brunch party, this is your spot! The dj comes on at 3, the black out curtains cover the windows, and the party really gets poppin at 430/5. If you're interested in eating, I suggest booking a 2pm reservation so you're finishing by 3 because after that its bottlev service and dancing on couches and you don't want to be trying to eat your French toast while everyone else is taking shots and downing champagne. Great spot for a birthday or special occasion but do be aware that you need to either make a reservation or be a regular. Big groups don't get in after the party starts. This is also the sort of place where you dress to impress. That means no jeans, sneakers, etc. A big group favorite is the punch bowl which I did with a group of friends for a birthday. Basically, come here for brunch and stay to party it up for the day. You wont find a better party!",,,

79,Nicole W.,"Arlington, VA",114,158,200,3.0,1/26/2016,"Brunch at Bagatelle was definitely a unique and entertaining experience.  I was here last Saturday for a birthday brunch celebration... We were a party of 6.  We were seated promptly with our reservation.  When we asked for a drink menu we were given a wine list.   Clearly the early expectation was to spend lots of cash and get wasted.  Our server was energetic and decently attentive.  Our meals were average but nothing noteworthy.  I had the Nutella French toast with raspberries.  Thick toast, a tad dry... Nice presentation but nothing to write home about.  The best part of this brunch was the party atmosphere.  There was a DJ playing dance music, getting everyone hype.  The price tag for all of this... Over $100 per person for a simple entree and a few rounds of drinks.  Definitely over priced (in my opinion).  And... We were asked to leave our table after a few hours, unless we purchased a few bottles.  Hmmmmm..... I can say, this place was super packed and popular... So many must not mind the price tag.  But for me it was a one time event.",6,3,1

Our bill was over 500 dollars and they refused to let us finish our drinks, lost our card on file we were paying with, and were openly nasty to us. Food was not worth the price at all and charged 225 dollars FOR A FISHBOWL. Never going back. They kicked us out of our table that we had a reservation for to give to other people and on my birthday which they knew about. Customer comes first in any restaurant but not here.

One negative.  I must comment on my Bloody Mary drink.  For the high quality and price of this restaurant, I feel they should make a better effort for the staple brunch drink.  It was very basic (I watched the bartender make it).  To me, a Bloody Mary is all about the flavor and accoutrements.  This tasted just OK and it was a pretty basic olives on a stick adornment.I would call this place trendy.  Many people were dressed to be seen.  Some looked like they were dressed for (or from) a night out, especially the women.  Tight dresses, lots of side boob. :)  It was ""brunch time"" on a Sunday.  So while some of the outfits were head turning, others were simply amusing.  :) It's an expensive place so be forewarned.  Granted, we did share a bottle of Champagne between three people (it was brunch remember).  The bill was nearly $90 per person, before tip.  I stopped at 3 stars.  If the price was more in line with the food and the Bloody Mary was better,  I'd have given 4 stars.",1,,
82,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,2.0,11/30/2015,"What a weird, weird place....The only way I can aptly describe Bagatelle is ""pretend fancy."" Like a McDonald's gourmet burger, its facade implies a higher quality product, but let's be real, McDonald's ain't foolin' nobody.The whole place is a paradoxical mix of trash and class. The decor included beautiful chandeliers alongside paintings with swear words scrawled across them. The crowd ranged in attire from t-shirt/jeans and mini-skirts, to jackets and stilettos. Most of the women had on full faces of heavy clubbing makeup, and looked incredibly out of place at Sunday brunch. The waitstaff had an air of pretention but looked like high school/college kids from across the Hudson. The food and drinks are very expensive, but thankfully, pretty tasty. We did not stay to witness the restaurant-to-nightclub transition, so I can't speak to the party.Overall, I can't justify dropping hundreds on pretend fancy. I won't be back.",28,14,5

We tried a variety of dishes each course, but I'll touch upon those that stood out the most. Now, their pizza (yes the French aren't known for pizza), but their pizza a la truffle noire was TO DIE FOR! A few slices of that paired with their salad and a bit of their tuna tartar will keep you coming back for more each time. Keep in mind that one pizza is good enough to share among a group. For entrees, I had the pleasure of trying several of their seafood dishes along with their truffle roasted chicken with potatoes and gnocchi. I wasn't in a seafood evening that evening so the latter dishes stand out since they were exquisite.I must note that the service and attentional to detail at Bagatelle is exceptional from the moment you walk in. Overall, the entire meal was paired with a nice Malbec, which I was a huge fan of and we ended the night with a huge ice cream sundae. Now, I'm not a huge of sweets, but this was certainly quite the experience. Would I go back to for more? Absolutely!",7,4,5

87,Jamel O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2614,891,191,5.0,12/18/2015,"I was invited to Bagatelle for a sit down dinner event.When I think of Bagatelle, I think of the brunch parties they have there. For that reason, I was skeptical. However, I was told that they have a great menu for dinner and that I would be surprised.So I went.  There was a DJ playing music.  However, it was not so loud that the group could not have conversations.  Our party of five sat for dinner.  The appetizers were shockingly good.In particular, the scallop was good. However the crab salad was like a ceviche.  It was really phenomenal.  The octopus was great as well.  However the crab was pretty memorable.The ahi tuna tartare was a nice size and was tasty.  The truffle pizza was really different and had a great taste to it.The Chou Frise was a Kale Salad with dried cranberries, ricotta cheese, pickeled shallots & lemon & Jean Evo.  This is a nice way of saying it was some Kale and Cheese. Nothing to go crazy about at all.The truffled roasted chicken was way juicier than I expected and had a good taste to it.The bone in ribeye steak was perfectly cooked and tasty.  The Gnocchi was very good.Where Bagatelle shines and is probably one of the most under rated restaurants in the City is for dessert. One Dessert. The Ice Cream Sundae.The Huge Sundae they serve is pretty amazing.  It comes out with sparklers and its own show.  It is a great birthday cake replacement.  It can feed lots of people.  It puts traditionally popular places like the popular ice cream/hot chocolate/sundae spot in midtown that I will not name to shame. Bagatelle is more than capable of competing for best group ice cream spot. If ever flying bottles of Dom P. in via superman and sparklers does not work out for them, they would still crush most of the birthday crowd with just this sundae.  It is massive.I also saw some groups nearby eating and drinking Dom P., each bottle being delivered with fanfare. Superman was carried by some men while flying one in.  Apollo Creed seemed to deliver another one as if he was entering the ring.  It seemed like the customers were happy.  However, it was the food on my table that had me there, and the food on my table that surprised me.  Before this week, I would never have considered Bagatelle for a ""grown folks"" dinner.  My opinion has changed.Bagatelle, the home of the amazing large sundae that your whole party probably won't finish.  That is my review.  It is one of the best kept secrets in the city.",5,3,5

It's literally garbage.Service: slow, understaffed. after receiving our menu, the dude came back two minutes later and was not seen again until 10-15 min later, no one asked us once if we were ok (it's loud but it was just the two of us, so it was possible), for each course it took them 20 min to take away our plates- unacceptable. The host of the party- a renowned business owner/celebrity I suppose, had to hand the dishes to the waiter because they were there so long. There was one bus boy that was actually kind and helped with our needs- he had a beard and a foreign accent.Regular menu: painfully overpriced. Prix fixed menu:  We didn't get served dinner until AFTER TEN!!! The party started at 8!!!Tuna tartar was good.My tasteless stripped bass was undercooked- felt like I was eating mush, I told them to cook it more. When it came back out, they put it on a new plate with very very little sauce. Sauce was watery and had no flavor; I could've made better. The sides were the absolute worst part. I'm embarrassed for them. Mine came with two big chunks of onion(?) (WTF) that was so hard to cut and eat. My friend's came with french fries. These dishes already cost an arm and a leg as it is. Don't you think we deserve better side dishes???? And two sides instead of one seems quite fair to me for $55 a plate!! It was $68 with tax and a 15% tip which only the bus boy deserves. CAN YOU FEED US. My bfs Mac and cheese wasn't terrible, but they used a  mini penne pasta. That's not a Mac and cheese noodle. We ordered the creme brulee but they then told us later there was no more. AGAIN, disappointing.Entertainment: Piercing music. It does not have to be that loud!! You couldn't talk to anyone. My throat hurts from screaming. Creepy costumes. There were different colored lights that flashed with the music from the ceiling the whole night.Better not go if you have epilepsy. P.S. The manager reached out to me but never responded after that.  They should've invited my fiance and I to come back for a better experience.

I had the Braise beef short rib croissant , with smoked mozzarella sunny side up egg & roasted potatoes good tasting meat great with the egg & croissant, potatoes not bad. Also tried the Lobster Mac pretty good very cheesy can't really taste any lobster in it, Parmesan truffle fries were very good. Good Steak au Poivre w fries. The Gnocchi Truffe pasta was delicious very nice truffle taste. As for the restaurant doesn't look like much plain white decor what clearly makes this place is the pretty people & good looking staff that entertains u while u eat club atmosphere in the middle of the afternoon great music & performances keep the vibe going.

Our reservation was for a nine person bachelorette party. Despite calling to confirm the reservation, and arriving ten minutes early, we were told by the rude hostess our table was not ready and instructed to wait at the bar. When a member of our party expressed concern as to how the hostess would find us in the large crowd of people, she was met with no response or resolution. The same member of our party continued to check in with the hostess for TWO hours and was met with complete disregard and a nasty attitude. After two hours and countless complaints, a member of our party spoke with an equally rude manager who informed us there was no guarantee that we would be seated at all. Despite RUINING a bachelorette party, not a single apology was given. Bagatelle managed to not only ruin what should have been an enjoyable day, but devastate an excited bride to be.Bagatelle is not worth a SINGLE star solely for their complete disregard of customers. Do NOT waste your time attempting to book an event at Bagatelle,. You will be sorely disappointed by their lack of organization and abysmal attitude.",25,1,1
102,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7750,14306,2.0,9/5/2016,"Hours seem off here given our 5:30pm 1000-point reservation, the saving grace of our meal (well, that and the 30% off BlackBoardEats code). Tips are unsurprisingly slammed with promoters, and there's a huge number of reviews, yet barely mention anything but brunch or drinks, yet the lady friend insisted on coming here anyway. They must not get many reservations, because they called three times AND sent a confirmation email to make sure we'd show up, presumably because 1000 OT points means a bigger cut to OpenTable. We were initially seated inside, which was ridiculously loud already at 5:30, and our booth seats were quite dirty, so we relocated outside, which was fine. The bread to start was solid, and the scallops were properly cooked, and the fries were fine (albeit with zero ketchup/aioli/etc), but the steak was pretty awful. Skipped dessert and hit Ample Hills instead.There was a Restaurant Week menu card behind our check, yet they never mentioned it to us, even though we received menus before mentioning the BBE code.",7,2,3
103,Jeffy J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",293,23,3,5.0,8/23/2017,What a fun place for brunch. I ate the eggs bagatelle and shared the French toast with friends. The food was amazing. The place turns into a day club after 3PM and I know that it is a little early to turn up but you forget about that once the music starts bumping and you have superheroes all over the place.The 3$ signs are for real so be prepared for that.,,,
104,Nene G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,28,29,4.0,2/5/2018,Service was amaze! All men working there on a Saturday night which was indeed less drama. Entertainment and ambience was lit!!,,,
105,Rachel S.,"New York, NY",8,37,54,4.0,2/5/2017,"I'll say right off the bat that the Yelp pricing for this place is right skewed, meaning that yes, there are $200 cocktails and $1,000 sundaes here, but for most regular entrees, the price is pretty much NYC standard. For brunch you can expect to spend $20-$26 on a single entree. And the portion sizes are big! Not too bad, huh?I ordered the short rib croissant ($25): it comes with some greens (to ease your guilt), a flaky croissant, a sunny side up egg, potatoes, and of course, the star of the meal, juicy, perfectly cooked short rib. We also got a dish reminiscent of poutine to share - fries with cheese, scallions, short rib, bacon, and more with a fried egg as the cherry on top.I've seen some complaints about the service here on Yelp and I can say that in my experience, it was nothing less than amazing. Everyone - from the bartenders, to the waiters, to the bathroom attendant - was very friendly! After a particularly strong irish coffee I lost/dropped my napkin no less than three times, and after each incident a new fresh one would appear in front of me quicker than I could ask my waiter.",,,
106,Katie H.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1239,688,492,5.0,8/4/2016,"I've had the pleasure of visiting Bagatelle recently and upon walking in I was greeted with such a warm welcome. I knew right there and then I'd be in good hands. I was immediately impressed by the ambiance and overall vibe from the restaurant. The décor is elegant yet has a quirky vibe with the interesting artwork adorning each wall. I especially enjoyed the open space and those gorgeous chandeliers. As for the food, every single thing that came onto my plate was nothing short of excellent. We had quite an array of options that night - each of them getting better with each course. We started off with a plethora of appetizers (which in my opinion were enough for a meal on its own!) and included their Salade Bagatelle which was a very refreshing start to our meal. The Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas as well as the Pizza à la Truffle Noire were absolute standouts. I'm personally a HUGE fan of truffle anything and the flavors in these dishes were just divine. Next was the Seafood tower prestige which included a tower-assortment of oysters, shrimp, lobster, caviar, whitefish, halibut, clams, king crab... the list could go on. I think I've only had caviar once or twice in my life so this was certainly a delicacy. All of the seafood was stellar not to mention very fresh.As for the entrees (I know, so much food!) we all split (I believe this is the one) the Cote de Boeuf Pour Deux and the Filet de Saumon which were both great. At this point I had to seriously pace myself because I was warned that there would be dessert. And indeed there was. Desserts happen to be one of my favorite things - I have a such a sweet tooth, so I was looking forward to something small to end the fantastic meal I've just had. They don't do small here. Out rolls the Mousse Chic Choc, the Caramel Chouchou, the Pavlova Fraises et Vanille (the descriptions are lengthy so I'll let you look those up yourself) and the GIANT Ice Cream Sundae/mountain adorned with sparklers and basically big enough to feed two tables, or even maybe more. When I say I've never been more full in my entire life, I mean it. Every component of my dining experience was wonderful. The quality of the food, the stellar service, the club-like ambiance (when the sun went down - so much fun) and the phenomenal company. My compliments to the staff and the chef. It's truly a meal I'll never forget.",8,2,8
107,Valerie F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,5/21/2018,"At the end of my experience I was ashamed that I decided to have a birthday brunch at your establishment.  I invited friends from Philly and new friends who never experienced your wonderful brunch experience.  I have visited your restaurant in the past for the brunch so I was very well aware of the protocol and the 30 days in advance booking.  My reservation was for 2pm.  Two of my friends arrived late and I was informed that they could technically give away my table after 15 minutes.  It was a party of 5 so two were not there exactly at that time.  They eventually came and the hostess kept saying yes we will get to you.  We didn't get seated until 3:30.  Can you imagine waiting an hour and half for a reservation then told that they do not have any more tables available and will have to make you a table in the middle of the floor.  We had no choice, but to take it at this point.  Total disappointment.  The only good thing about this place was our very friendly server.  We usually get the snobby french servers, but this time I was pleasantly surprised.  He deserves a raise for having to wear a sparkle dress to entertain guests.  Another thing I found was that in the years past this place was very classy and done well now it's just trash.",2,,

From the hostess to our sever, Giuseppe everyone was super nice and attentive. We all got a pitcher of sangria for the table which comes w straws and lights inside. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese w bacon and it was delish! I ate all of my Mac and cheese it was that good. They then brought out their huge sundae which was even better then the Mac...I'm so upset I couldn't take some home w me. LOLAt 3:30pm it turns into a day party. They have black curtains that make the place pitch black, the servers wear crazy costumes, there's a drummer that has a costume that lights up...it was just so much fun!I loved the music, vibes, service...the only thing is that it gets really really packed so you may get pushed here and there.

My friend and I started with cocktails and the truffle pizza, then shared the half chicken and caramel cream puffs for dessert. The pizza was great but forgettable. I wanted the chicken to be more flavorful; the best part were the potatoes it came with. I will say the portion sizes are decent and the dessert was more or less perfect. We had iffy service - the waiters were nice, but ignored us a lot even though the place was pretty empty (it was a weeknight). I get that brunch is the thing here but I probably won't return.",1,,

Their tuna tartare here is a must! My favorite thing on the menu beside the truffle pizza, the truffle chicken and the burger! so many good choices! I would say if you're coming here with a bunch of people and drinking get one of their fish bowls, it deff pays out in the long run. It can get expensive, especially if youre getting one of those flashy bottles of champagne. (the waiters get dressed up in different costumes and carry it out for you. How Cool!)I'm excited to come by in the summer as I've only eaten inside, but the outside patio looks wonderful. Ill be sure to check it out one sunny day!

114,Priya S.,"Chicago, IL",345,144,220,5.0,10/24/2016,"I recently visited New York and we went here on a Saturday morning with a group of friends. I had SO much fun! It reminded me of a brunch you could have in Las Vegas. We arrived around 11 am for brunch, and they said the reservation is good for about 2 hours. Luckily, they didn't have a reservation immediately after, so they let us stay til about 2pm. During brunch, it was relatively quiet and intimate. As the day went on, it got louder and rowdier, with a full on party with music, DJ, and lights turned off by 3pm. The food itself was DELICIOUS!!! The truffle pizza, French toast, and heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese was my favorite. We ordered a second of the salad and the pizza; all of us were using the sauce in the salad as a drip for our breads. The French toast itself was so moist and fluffy. It just melts in your mouth. They offer the option of adding Nutella on the side for $2 (which is a tiny little ramekin); the French toast was delicious without it, so I wouldn't recommend the nutella for taste or the price. We also ordered the grilled cheese, which was all cheese on the outside and inside. It was good, however I wasn't too impressed with it. My least favorite item was the gnocchi we ordered; I thought it lacked flavor and there wasn't anything unique to it that you couldn't find at a standard Italian restaurant for a much cheaper price. The drinks itself were good - nothing amazing or particularly unique/special. This place is definitely on the pricier end, however worth the food and great atmosphere. The crowd is a mix of young professionals and younger 40-year olds. Would be a great place if you're looking for a ""Sunday-funday"" feel on a Saturday or for a bachelorette/birthday party during the day.",1,,

Service was so-so even though the place wasn't packed, but my friend and I received a free shot for some special event they were hosting later that night. A few weeks later, my girlfriends and I had reservations for brunch here to celebrate my birthday. I was well aware that this place turns into a day club after 2pm and was a bit interested in checking it out after eating but it all went downhill after we ordered dessert. After placing our order, I was told by an employee we had to leave in 5 minutes because they needed the table. Oh really? We get our dessert but we don't even have spoons/utensils to eat them with. And he comes by again to remind us of our time limit. UM. Another annoyingly rude part of their service was not even giving their customers the option to stay at the table. What if my party decided to stay for the club and wanted to purchase a bottle or two?Or did you not offer anything to us because we don't look boujie enough for you?",7,2,1

117,Lexie E.,"San Diego, CA",123,30,58,4.0,5/17/2016,"This is an insane atmosphere to get yourself into for Sunday brunch. Thankfully I was made aware of this and came prepared with no prior hangover from the night before, and good amount of rest because you'll need it to endure this madness of a small crowded room, strobe lights, and loud dance music. As a newly 23 year old I LOVED IT.PROS: the music selection was great, the atmosphere of the place and of the servers was an all time high and really got you in a party mood. Great tasting mojitos and Nutella French toast.CONS: it was insanely packed like a nightclub dance floor would be and chaotic to get seated. We had to wait a good 15mins when we already had set reservations.  Our waitress was extremely inattentive and rude, so we tipped her accordingly and she had the audacity to come up to us as we were leaving and complain that we were suppose to tip her more and made us feel embarrassed as if we were walking out without paying. We tipped as we felt was appropriate and it was extremely disrespectful to flat out demand we raise it.***WARNING: the lights will shut off around 4pm and it's a full on nightclub at that point (way fun if you've already eaten and are buzzed!)***BEWARE the fishbowls look awesome as heck and they taste great, but they are $185 for one... We should have read that fine print before we purchased. I guarantee there's not even a full bottle of alcohol in it and with a large group you'll get maybe one wine glass size each..

118,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,4.0,5/14/2015,"If you like to party, then Bagatelle's brunch is the place to be. Their party brunch has been on my to do list ever since I moved to New York. We made a reservation for a party of 6, about a month in advance for 2pm on a Sunday. When we walked in, we saw ladies decked out in full on clubbing outfits in the early afternoon, with a mix of trendy, bar or dinner outfits. We first ordered brunch food - Eggs Benedict, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Gnocci, pizza - all very pricey ($25-$40 per plate) and shared a large Mojito Fish Bowl ($395). The mojito was hugeee and delicious - it came with 20 glow in the dark straws and everything was a lot of fun. As we ate, the restaurant lights dimmed, curtains closed and the throbbing lights went up. It turned into a full-out club.  The DJ started playing EDM/hip hop/top 40 music and people started dancing on tables and being carried on people's shoulders. Every 30 minutes or so a table would be delivered a large bottle or a big dessert that would be delivered by either Superman, Darth Vader or Marie Antoinette accompanying music and sparklers - it's a great party atmosphere. The music and dancing was great - you just start dancing with everyone around you - it's like going to a nightclub in the middle of the day.Now, the downside of coming here is that everything is overpriced. For the 6 of us, the bill came out to be over $1,200, including two champagne bottles. However, everything about Bagatelle is fabulous and I guess that is expected from a popular party brunch place in meatpacking.",6,1,4

(With a 3 course meal and cocktails, average $100/person) The cocktails and ambience are spot on and fantastic! The prawns were delicious. Only negative for the entire meal was the cheese on the saffron risotto with the prawns. It's unnecessary and honestly ruins the delicious risotto underneath. Maybe try a chili oil on top instead?? The chicken was top notch, the fish, deboned at the table, customer service, and desserts were fabulous. Highlights were: cocktails, creamed spinach, chicken, (half or whole, ordered the half) sautéed veggies that accompanied the fish special, prawns were excellent, and creme brûlée! The cookie that accompanies the creme brûlée was fantastic! Has a salt bite to it which is perfection. I would buy these separately if I could!!",1,,

Despite how empty the restaurant was, we did not get our food until an hour into our reservation. Once we had finished and were waiting for the dessert menus, the waiter brought the check (unprompted) and said we had exhausted our two hour window. We were surrounded by empty tables, so there was clearly no reason to rush us out. The waiter said that in an hour it would be ""too full to move."" I doubt it.

126,Avalyn J.,"Queens, NY",224,172,338,5.0,4/12/2016,"I wondered what I was getting myself into when a friend suggested going to Bagatelle.  As we all know, Bagatelle is known for their wild and crazy brunch day party.  Which I have nothing against, as I'd love to attend the crazy affair myself, but I'm assuming the food would be just good and nothing more.  Boy oh boy was I mistaken.  The food was exceptional and way beyond my expectations!My fav menu items:Apps:Maine diver scallopsAhi tuna tartar with avocado saladMains:Pour Deux 24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn saucePizza à la Truffle NoireDesserts:Mousse Chic Choc-72% dark chocolate mousse, toasted pecans, chocolate biscuitChouchou Caramel-Caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff, milk chocolate caramel sauceThe staff were great and very attentive which is always an important factor during a nice meal out.  At one point Chef Sebastien came over to greet us as well.  Nice touch! :)The atmosphere was a mix between relaxed and then a more lively feel. When we arrived at 7:30pm it was fairly calm with low music playing in the background.  At around 9p is when the music level elevated but not to the point where you couldn't hear one another, bottles with lit sparkles were being popped and a few people were dancing in their area.  I really enjoyed the vibe.  It's just the right amount of upbeat atmosphere for a weekday.There are several reasons why I would go back & recommend Bagatelle to a friend.First and foremost it would be for the exceptional food & service.For a special celebration or to treat myself, as the menu prices are on the higher end.For date night when I want to classy it up a bit. To partake in the craziness of the brunch party.Thanks Bagatelle for a wonderful evening! I can't wait to knock your brunch party off my list! :)",4,3,5

He made us give a credit card at the beginning and told us they do that because there's people that walk out without paying the bill, however, a card information is needed when you make a reservation so that was unnecessary. Then we order the pitcher of a drink and he said they didn't serve in the cups, that's why they gave us straws, but then again the server for the other table was serving everybody in a cup from the pitcher. Finally when we received the check, we decided to pay the total first and then add the tip, the server was so upset and told me to add the tip right there and I told him ""no, you're making this so complicated"" so he responded ""I do this shit every weekend, you ain't gonna tell me how to do it"" as he was pushing my arm. I requested to speak with the manager and as I was talking to the manager, the server went back to my table to tell my friends ""what's wrong with her?!!!"".  I should've called the police instead because it was my birthday and he put his hands on me.

130,Paul C.,"New York, NY",469,13,8,5.0,9/1/2016,"Let me preface my review with saying that Bagatelle brunch has been one of my favorite experiences in New York. Ever. When I arrived to join my party at 2 PM, I had no idea the extent of the debauchery that I was going to experience in the next 4 hours. It started out as calmly as any other brunch in the city, a few Moet mimosas and light salads lined our white linen clothed table. However, the ruse of a demure Saturday afternoon soon unraveled when the litany of champagne flutes was replaced by two barrel sized jugs of mojito. As the lights started to dim and the music rose to a club-like cadence, I just stared out in disbelief as the first round of Dom parades came strolling out.If you've never experienced a Bagatelle bottle delivery, you haven't experienced New York. The sheer opulence and fanfare incorporated with their bottle service is a testament to the resilience of the 1% and their ability to spend their maid's annual salary in one brunch. Invoking pre '07 financial crisis fervor, the waiter clad in Napoleon garb riding on the shoulders of the less fortunate waiters hand delivered our bottles with the complementary sparklers that one is oft to receive. Turned out one costumed waiter wasn't enough, so we just ordered more bottles. Our cast ended up including Napoleon, Thor, Superman, and Elvis? I don't remember much after Superman though.All in all, one of the most memorable days I have had so far in New York, unblemished by the fact that I did not have to see the bill to this extravagant afternoon. Had I not been an invited guest of some much more wealthier friends, I would have had a much more harrowing view of the most magnificent brunch of my youth.",,1,
131,william o.,"New York, NY",2,8,1,5.0,3/26/2017,"There's always a party on the weekends at this place. The crowd is generally good looking and nicely dressed. The service at Bagatelle has always been fantastic. When I go to Hillstone restaurant near my office, for example, the servers, while grinning from ear to ear, try to take your plate before you've finished, no matter how fast an eater you are. They also try clear as each person finishes instead of course by course. Bagatelle never does this to us.Weekday dinners here are good for quiet conversation. On weekends expect to be dancing around your table like everyone else.The food is very good too, from whole daurade and loup de mer to steakhouse quality steak.",1,,
132,Christmas H.,"New York, NY",196,4,0,1.0,12/18/2016,"If you are you looking for great customer service while spending at least a minimum of $125 pp don't go here. I will first say that the food here is very good. I came here for brunch for my birthday as I heard the brunch is a fun party brunch.As soon as I walked into the establishment I immediately regretted coming here for my birthday.  Upon entering the restaurant the host area had about 5 or 6 staff standing around having a lively conversation amongst themselves.  I stood there for about a minute hoping someone would recognize that I had just walked in and ask me how I can be helped. Instead I had to interrupt them.  The first woman I spoke to I indicated that I had a reservation for my birthday.  She looks and me and tells me to speak to a woman who was standing right next to her. I was put off by the manner in which she passed me off.  My level of annoyance began to increase at that point.I eventually checked in and then I left the host stand to check my coat.  When I returned  to be seated, I again had to interrupt the same group of staff from there conversation to be acknowledged. We eventually were seated by a woman who didn't have the decency to escort us to the table.  Instead she walked ahead of us with a space of at least 5 feet.  When we arrived at the table she handed us our menus and didn't say a word.  We had our meal which was great as I mentioned above.  The last straw was when we received our check, the waiter puts it on the table and immediately says he needs the table.  In other words pay us and get the f*ck out. Lastly, The brunch wasn't fun The party doesn't even start until 3PM.  If you don't have a reservation around 3 PM, don't expect a party. This place is too pricey to receive such crappy service.  This is the worst experience I have ever had in NYC.  I do not recommend this place and I will never go back.",118,5,3
133,Millicent L.,"New York, NY",74,117,202,3.0,1/26/2017,"So this place was ok..  I ate here once for lunch and I came back another time for their boozy brunch on a Saturday. The food was ok.. I actually really like their Tuna tar tar. That was pretty good. During the boozy brunch my friend and I tried the steak for 2 with French fries. The steak was nicely made and tasted really good. The fries were your typical fries..  they were good too. My complaint about this place is the service. Our waiter COMPLETELY ignored us during our brunch. He took our order and we never saw him again. My friend and I did notice him partying it up real hard with the group of girls seated next to us. He never even attempted to see if we were ok or if we needed anything else although he was just a few feet away from us. The waiter could careless about us once we ordered because his healthy tip was automatically  included on the bill. I can definitely see why people may think this establishment is a little prejudice. I didn't experience any derogatory treatment other than having extremely terrible service but there is definitely a ""type"" throughout the restaurant.  I would go back if I were invited by friends, but I will never suggest this place to anyone. The service is too sub par and better French food can be found anywhere else in the city.",3,,
134,Veronica W.,"Bay Shore, NY",8,5,0,4.0,11/14/2017,"We came last year for our friends annual Xmas brunch... we had an 11am reservation as that's all we were able to get last minute. It was great, food was good, drinks then we got kicked off our table for next reservation. ::sigh:: We still had a great time. We are trying to make a reservation now for our annual brunch and since you can only make reservations ""30 days in advance"" per Bagatelle, we decided to call a few days prior to the 30 and they are allowing us to make a reservation but only for 11am or 2pm. It doesn't make sense because if you make 11am you will get kicked out your table and if you make it for 2pm, its just about to get dark, you risk waiting a long time for the table and you don't get to enjoy eating too. Not sure why we cant get a 12:30/1pm reservation. Disappointing especially when your spending a good amount of money and willing to spend some $$ as well.....",,,
135,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,4.0,2/8/2016,"My bestie organized a big girls' brunch for her birthday here on Sunday for ""Club Brunch."" There were 12 of us and we sat down during the first seating at 1230.  It became clear to me that the second seating, which I think is 3pm is what costs $$$ as the blinds close, it gets dark, the attire gets clubbier, and the music starts getting LOUDER.I didn't think it was pretentious in here.  How could it be when honestly when most real New Yorkers don't go here regularly- you'll find older B&T folk, younger B&T folk, foreigners, visitors, bachlorette parties, etc.  And as long as you know that and soak it all in, it is a fun time.  They do play good music and have good drinks. With brunch, I had a really decent Bloody Mary and Irish coffee (funny, they don't pay much attention to you if order coffee sans the alcohol), and the ""Cheeseburger Bagatelle"" which was really meaty but messy.  Came with decent fries (though it didn't list it on the menu, I thought everything was a la carte). Among the other girls, I saw many mimosas, bellinis, eggs benedict, goat cheese frittatas, french toast (looked the best!), and other ad hoc lunch items like the filet mignon tartar and lobster mac.  I would advise sticking with classic brunch items - like anythings eggs or french toast or a burger for lunch.   If you order bottle service, they deliver it via a flying Superman (a waiter in a costume), and a sparkler. They had other cheese plates and the like to share... but we didn't share. We only shared an off the menu ice cream sundae which came with a sparkler and was $55 which could have fed like 30+ people so very reasonable. It was also the yummiest thing I had - whip cream, vanilla/chocolate ice cream, brownie/cookie, granola. Yum.Service is a bit slow/spotty and you had a 2 hour limit on the table before it needs to be turned over for the next group, of which then you can just wait at the bar.  But it's ok, you're there to chill and have fun so no rush.  This is a great place for out of towners and groups, and glad I tried it out.  Can't say I'd be a regular though.  This Club Brunch was better than il Bastardo which we also tried.  I left too early around 3ish but apparently afterward, door service starts and it gets clubbier and clubbier.(P.S. There is a coat check and bathroom lady who gives you paper towels, etc).Brunch was $80 after tax/grat. I believe they also have a pre fixe menu for $75 pre tax/grat.",6,2,4

I was very impressed by the elegant décor, especially the chandeliers they were beautiful.We were seated and our servers were super friendly and pleasant. I got to try many of the appetizers like kale salad, tuna tartar over guacamole, scallop with seafood sauce, truffle gnocchi, truffle pizza, octopus, crab salad and of course their delicious bread.Everything was delicious but if I had to pick my favorites I would go with the scallop, tuna tartar and crab salad. Now as far an entrees I tried the scallops, bone in ribeye with fries and truffle roasted chicken with potatoes. Again I cant complain about anything since it was delicious and we ate everything.You can tell the quality of the food here its great. Since everything is made to perfection.Now you cant come here and not have dessert so we ordered the dark chocolate mousse, profiteroles and this massive sundae which it was like a party on its own. Again they outdid themselves since all of the desserts were great. The table next to us ordered champagne and one of the servers came out in a Superman outfit flown by the other servers to deliver which was such a great spectacle. I really enjoyed my night here, the food, service and ambience was great. I will be coming back :)",9,3,9

It was a lighter than the usually Saturday/ Sunday crowd.  Light enough that as a party of 5 we were still seated and served in a very timely fashion yet full and lively enough for us to have a great time dancing around with other patrons and staff. Our server Phillip was terrific, attentive, pleasant, professional and approachable and great with all of his recommendations. I.e. The truffle pizza -Glorious!   The staff were all on point.

Well not really...I frequent Meat Packing often and most recently came here for my birthday this year amongst a few other places. This place is WILD and probably overrated. There are  people on tables, people on chairs, waiters dressed in costumes, magnum sized bottles and just pure madness! This is one of those anything goes places. Everyone in here is spending money so no one is telling anyone anything. Even the guys at the bar are spending a good $17 a pop on a drink. Bouncers can and will be selective at the door but that pertains to all of Meat Packing. Tons of foreigners and the rest American. This may be biased just because I like Meat Packing (no pun intended) but this place is a good time and certainly entertaining!!! Would I come back?! Hell yea!",7,2,6

But the staff has been so atrocious and non informative to me when trying to make a reservation, I had to post a review. There should be some kind of posted notice (Umm Yelpers? You there?), warning the customers, that reservations are required 30 DAYS in advance. Not some stupid auto reply email asking customers to call in (circa 1995), via the Bagatelle website!Further to that, and most importantly, there should be a note on the website or anywhere for goodness sake (Hello Yelpers...? Anybody home!?), that a minimum of $250 per person (Really??) is demanded..err ..i mean ..required on weekend reservations after 1pm.It sounds like my friends and I will be merely walk in's on Sunday afternoon, at the doorman's discretion, of course.

The experience was not ideal and got worse throughout the evening. We started by ordering cocktails and my specialy drink (Summertini) arrived tasting awful and salty (supposed to be a sweet drink). I told the waiter who returned it and came back to apologize and say they had used bad pineapple juice. I then ordered a cosmo which was great. We dined early for a Saturday evening (6:30 PM) and ordered appetizers and our entrees as soon as we were seated. After a long while, we finally got our appetizers and then after about half an hour the waiter reappeared to ask us if we wanted dessert. We told him we had not yet had our entrees yet but he proceeded to bring over dessert menus anyway. Finally after two hours of being seated, we were served our entrees which were very good but the whole experience overall was so very disappointing. We asked to speak with the manager, who never made the effort to come to the table but rather sent over a few free drinks instead. This kind of treatment from a high end upscale establishment is really unacceptable and is certainly not something that I've experienced before.",,,

We were pleasantly greeted and every 5 minutes asked if we wanted to be seated.My friend invited me to a dinner that he was treated to and i said hells yeah, i will go.When we collected 4 bodies to sit, we asked to be taken to our table and wait for the rest and they agreed (usually restaurants dont let you sit if the entire party is not there)PS: I can only review the food, service and venue as i was invited and i didn't have to pay.The Decor: chic but weird as it has curse words on paintings around the place. Large bar and huge dinning area. The Food: Since I was invited by a friend i just took in what i was given. Plates just kept coming in and empty ones leaving.We were delighted with so many good plates, the Ahi Tuna Tartare was super delicious. drizzled with what seems a light oil and paired with avocados (im allergic to but still had them). The Truffle Pizza was actually pretty dam good and as one of my friends mentioned ""the french are not know for pizza"" but this was just right on point. It seems that a lot of their dishes contain Truffle and why not who am i to judge. We had what seemed to be fish (halibut) ceviche type of dish and i was a fan of very much. Im really bad with names of things and this is when i should have written it down but i bet someone will remind me (lori can you please).The only plate i was blah about was the pan Roasted chicken, I was just bland to me. Fall off the bone but i was expecting maybe more flavor or a different taste to it. This was also served with Truffle but didn't give me the wow factor that most of the other dishes did.More plates came along but i stayed with the Fish dishes as i'm a seafood lover (see food and i eat it)Desert came along: OMG it was UGE (huge for the rest of us) It was a tower of Ice cream with more ice cream with chocolate and few other sweets that i cant.. just cant. You need to have 6-10 people dig at it, its just too big.The Service: The service was perfect, from the time we arrived to until we left. 3 ladies at the door greeting patrons and french servers always re-filling our waters and bringing us wine. The place got packed for what it seemed to be a french bastille day party and even with this, our service was amazing.I will definitely try to go again, i do see people and the recent lawsuit affecting this place but let me make sure its what people are saying. Our group was very mixed and we did not see any of the allegations. I sure hope is not for all of us sake.",,,

I Liked the tuna tartar with guac it was fresh and spicy. The gnocchi with truffle melted in your mouth. I also thought the cheese plate was good as well. The drinks were very watery and sweet with mostly ice and no liquor. Weak in my opinion. I did mention it to the bartender but he didnt fix it. Overall great night, amazing music, good food.",,,

Girls who want attention from extroverted servers (some of whom are way into themselves)? Guys who think the girls who go there would be interested in checking them out too (they're not)? HOW did this place even get known to be a spot to come to for non-New Yorkers without another trace of a New Yorker in there? Jessica R's first sentence summary is absolutely correct.It is the most uncomfortable I've ever been at a restaurant in New York...mostly because it was literally the most non-New York thing I've done here for the handful of years that I've lived here. I don't even know how my friends visiting from LA even knew how this place existed in NY.It was also the most confusingly expensive place I've ever been to for brunch.

The 2 stars are because we had fun and the dj was good. Food gets a 2 at most, service 1.5 stars.  You don't come here for the food. It's mediocre and ridiculously expensive. Both of the 2 person 100.00 steaks that were ordered had to be sent back because they were cooked to death. At this point our server said replacements would take another 40 minutes, seriously? They did offer a discount if our friends took a quicker cooking meat cut. How does that make sense?  Everyone in here (basically slutty dressed women) is celebrating something. Anytime a bottle comes out for bottle service the lights go on. Lots of sparklers, giant ice cream sundaes and even a man dressed as superman was  hoisted in the air and carried to a table singing happy birthday. You can't make this up. Don't go here. Ever.

This past Sunday we went to this place to celebrated my best friends 28th birthday . she made the reservation over a month ago to ensure we would get a table because as Halloween weekend we know everywhere gets crazy. It was 11 of us for a reservation at 2. They told us 15-20 min. After 45 min we started to get annoyed and went to speak to the Host who from the beginning was very rude . She said to the manager in front of my friend , ""I'm not dealing with this girl"". Shortly after we saw a group of 14 walk in and get seated almost immediately. We complained again and were given one free drink ticket per person . After 2.5 hours of waiting we were finally offered a table but the catch was it only sat 8 people. We were all so hungry at this point we just took the table. Then we asked for a comped bottle and they refused. We barely ate a few appetizers and then left shortly after. We are all native New Yorkers who go out and spend money frequently, we know how the business works. This is one of those places where you have to know someone to have a good time. Unfortunately we didn't have a connection and they made sure we felt uncomfortable. If you are planning to do a brunch party in manhattan save yourself the time and money and book it somewhere else.

Located in the Meatpacking District, it's a true gem of a place. It's very expensive so you must be willing to splurge. The gnocchi and French toast are the best! The dessert they bring out for birthdays is enormous and delicious. If you buy a bottle, they bring out very creatively. I've had superman fly it out to us and a Trojan man bring us a bottle once. The music is great and it has a St Tropez vibe. This place gets really wild and people end up dancing on tables and chairs to great beats. The waiters are hilarious and will dance with you.

It was not too crowded since lunch had just begun. To begin with, I just saw on their Instagram that Mariah Carey had been there two nights before I came! The decor is very unique, with a range of different blues, whites, and red. The dining room is huge! As well, there is a huge bar that we initially sat at until our table was ready. The food was delicious. We had a variety of options. I am still craving the Truffle Pizza, usually I like thin crust, but it was just so good there that I didn't care that the crust was a little thicker than usual because it worked so well with the truffle. The Ahi Tuna Tartare was delicious - highly recommend it! We also had ceviche, which was very fresh and definitely worth trying, even if you are not a ceviche lover!For my main dish, I had the ""cheeseburger Bagatelle"" which consisted of house blend potato bun, American cheese, truffle mayonnaise and french onion with a side of fries! The truffle mayonnaise was phenomenal. You must get the burger!The service was perfect. I was there with a fairly large group and the waiters would constantly come back and make sure everything was going well. All in all, definitely recommend Bagatelle. It is a fun and great time.

The waiter informed us about the ""special"" (note singular...only one special) which was whole oven baked sea bass. He  made a point to say that the cost was around their other main courses at $40 a portion. The fish tasted bland and was barely edible.  Then the bill comes and it's $120 a portion!

168,Alyssa A.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,1,0,2.0,1/27/2018,"I normally don't write reviews but my experience last night at Bagatelle made me adamant about sharing my experience. The food was okay and was the least of our problems. We were seated right away as we did have a reservation. Our table was sandwiched in between 2 large parties, none of which were seated yet. We sit down and begin to look at the menu, then our waiter comes over, doesn't introduce himself or welcome us to the restaurant, all he does is ask if we are ready to order some wine. We said we needed more time so he left, and when he returned again, he asked the same question. No personality and no hospitality at all. He was just a man that showed up with his pad and paper to take orders; I expected more from a place like this. We finally order, the appetizers come out within 10 minutes, and entrées the same. The entrées came out so quick that our second bottle of wine wasn't even at our table until after the entrées were dropped. Way too rushed. Then, the other big parties next to us begin to arrive. One of the parties was larger than anticipated so they had to add more chairs, at this point it was getting a little crowded. One of the staff then came to our round table of 5, and pushed one of the sides of the table in to give that other table more room, while we were more squished. No one asked if that was okay or apologized, they just came in and pushed our table in! Then dessert, we waited more than 20 minutes for dessert!! There must have been a problem in the kitchen but our server did not even come to us saying its going to be delayed. We felt a bit ignored once the big parties began to arrive. Customer service could definitely use some improvement and was extremely disappointing. On the flip side the bussers were great, water glasses always full, table cleared and cleaned, and new silverware put down promptly. Atmosphere was modern and had a trendy young vibe which was nice. But as I said, would not go back due to terrible customer service experiences.",,,
169,Lisa V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",277,35,35,4.0,8/11/2017,I went here for restaurant week with my friend on a Friday night. The tables are a little close together but it does not feel like you are on top of one another. I got the gnocchi which had some pesto and truffle sauce on it; it was the best part of the meal! For the main course I had chicken with some potatoes and mushrooms which was very tasty and not dried out. For dessert I had the Creme brûlée which was a nice finish to the meal. It is a nice restaurant to go to for a splurge meal!,,,
170,Gennadiy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,2,0,2.0,8/8/2017,"They get two stars for the ok food (overpriced) and good music, otherwise I would have given them 1. The waiters had a 3 second memory and were too busy dancing and hitting in women than doing their job. We had 1 server to accommodate 19 people that night! Ud think for the money we paid per person, they shouldve provided spectacular service and more staff. I ordered the same drink 5 times in order to get 1 drink, which came 2 hours into the night. I waited two hours after ordering from a menu of six items to get my food. It's good place for dancing and hanging by the bar. Not for bdays or table service. Overpriced, overrated, and I will NEVER return again.",,,

The food was AMAZING.  Ordered the truffle pizza, french toast with nutella, the salad and a few sides.  We loved the pizza and salad so much we ordered it again. The french toast was delicious without the nutella, so I wouldn't spend the extra $2 to order it, especially since it comes as a side.  The reservation was good for 2 hours, so we had to leave our table around 2 (they let us sit there an extra hour).  We were able to hang out by the bar and order more drinks.  It gets a bit crowded around 2-3 since that's when their music party begins, but it's totally worth it. The music, the service, and the atmosphere was perfect. Would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be going back.",1,,
173,Stephanie P.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",163,89,60,5.0,7/12/2016,"I have always gone to the infamous brunches at Bagatelle (if you haven't gone, book your next birthday here ASAP), but recently got to experience the weekday dining and had to write about it ....Next time you're looking for an intimate dinner for a celebration or just a night out, reserve a table at Bagatelle. They earned an A+ in my book for food, ambiance, service, and overall experience. Plus, Tuesdays they have 1/2-priced bottles of wine --uhh, this is a no-brainer to go to with your girls (and guys)!They had a DJ playing on the Tuesday night I went. He was spinning a mix of chill dance music, which was perfect to turn up the night a bit, but still allowed me to have a conversation over the music. The manager, John, was incredibly welcoming. He checked on us a few times and answered every question we had about the food/wine (the man has a lot of patience!). I was so impressed with the way they ran this place.THE FOOD: Tatare de Thom Bagatelle: Refreshing and tangy--the perfect medley of fresh ahi tuna, avocado, and crispy taro chips on the sidePizza a la Truffle Noire--Pizza and truffle. Need I say more? Large enough to share with a table and perfect if you're craving a truffled dish (who doesn't?)Charcuterie Board -- small bites of cheese with a sweet bread.

However we went for my friends gradation  and were very disappointed . Our waiter who said his name was Michael ( it said Gavin on our check ) was nice enough  it very overwhelmed since he has like 8 tables . Our drinks came out 15 minutes and 30 minutes after we ordered . A drink change took another 30 mins by the time the meal was over . The salads came out tasteless with no dressing and it took another 15 mins to get some . Bottom line for a special day we were disappointed , I could have had a better salad at paneara bread . For $160 on the check I would have expected much better service and food . Highly disappointed with the drinks and service . Someone should have comped something on our check for all of the waiting and food mixups , that's called hospitality .",,,1

We order the pitcher of margarita. Let me tell you that it cost $185. They do not tell you that the pitcher cost $185. If your with a group of people it is worth it because their drinks are expensive and if you buy 3 or 4 drinks it will add up to the amount together. The turn up after 230p is real but please be careful at the bar. We just found out that the waiter at the bar added additional tip. We order another pitcher and the total was 201.42 so I gave him a 5.00 tip and now on my statement is said 221.42. How did that happen? It happen to the 3 of us who were there and brought drinks at the bar. I called and spoke to a Shatima and she said she was going to send me a refund form but I haven't received anything nor spoke to the manager. I'm very disappointed and furious....lets be clear that the tip he receive was more than what they asked for at the end no one should take it upon themselves to add anything additional to your card.,,,

Updated review","Tried the party brunch for the second coming. The brunch portion itself is definitely not worth it - food is average and not a lot - but the party itself is nuts, especially if you go for Halloween with an unlimited budget. I think the scariest part of Halloween was the bill that somebody else (thankfully) paid. But yeah, keep the champagne magnums flowing!",,,
179,Darla T.,"Bronx, NY",134,6,5,2.0,7/9/2016,I came here for brunch and the food is very good. I was told to arrive before 3pm cause it turns into a party which is great. I had a very good time but when I ordered a drink i noticed there was pieces of glass in my drink! I'm not trying to be a prissy person but finding pieces of glass in my drink is not good! The bartenders are good but need to be careful in handling the glasses cause it can be crazy when people order their drinks. I just don't like the fact I could have swallowed glass in me !,2,,1
180,Chubi A.,"Chicago, IL",275,5,0,2.0,4/20/2016,"Was there on Saturday to celebrate a friend's birthday and the night didn't start off well at all or Go well periodThe table for 12 .. Yes 12 was set for 11 and was so cramped we said ""we'd pretty much eat in shifts""The hostess was less than understanding in her demeanor and solutioning. Completely unhelpful or cared really We just got another chair and place setting and that took 20 mins to get done. And the we started getting ""service"".When i say we ate in shifts, we initially said it as a frustrated joke but it became a self fulfilling prophecy.When the the appetizers came, 8 of us got ours first and were half way done eating, when two more got their's, and most were done when the last two received theirs. Unsure how the food were fired and spaced out in the back but our poor server who was actually the only saving personnel was doing his best to mask some clear failings and incompetence. Then came the main. Same thing happened which gobsmacked us- cos we thought it certainly couldn't continue 7 first (and the servers kept yelling across the table ""who had the duck?"", ""who ordered potatoes?"") - it was a diner with much less charmAt this point. People had to start eating while others watched againThen 4 more arrived 12 mins later (I timed it) FYI one was a chicken dish which arrives in a sauce pan by design..But took us additional 7 mins to get a dinner plate for our friend to eat his meal The last one they screwed up the gluten free order so that just didn't arrive for another 10 minsAgain we are in shifts!!! And hear meals aren't cheap!! Our saving grace waiter compensated with some champagne to our gluten free friend and profound apology but this night was sunk... Sad ...cos honestly the food is mostly goodOh barring the one person who had fish with bones in it!! And had to send it backIt was taken off the bill... Duh!!!!!!Boy this night was trying Our server - again the one saving grace brought the check and if it is was the custom of the restaurant (I doubt it) or him understanding that the outcome was less then ideal, didn't include the gratuity for the large table. Which was probably a good move We opted as a group to not punish him, the bartender or the bussers for the failings of the front of house or kitchen and additional serving staff incompetence and tipped appropriatelyThen the party began - a little jarring and gimmicky but we knew it was coming. Some got their meal taken away before they were done. But at this point ... No one spilled on us so we call that a win I guessWe didn't want to ruin our friend so we stayed and had one shot and ordered a bottle of champagne when the disco lights came on .. And then soon got the hell outta dodgyNot one time did the front come by and ask about anything. Not once We won't be back or recommendedSad when good food (why it's even a two) is tainted with exceptionally cruddy service and customer relations",9,,
181,Anthony M.,"Brooklyn, NY",154,140,1,2.0,5/13/2016,"It's incredible how average this place is, that's really the main thought upon leaving this review. Lunch for 5 people with a cost of $300+ and no boozing. Yes, I understand that Bagatelle is in a prime location within the the infamous Meatpacking District but I really question people that return to this place.Food:The food here is not terrible but it is the farthest thing from exquisite French cuisine. Additionally, there are so many amazing French restaurants in New York and this place has a hard time breaking the top 30 or 40.Service:The service is the bright spot of this restaurant but it still has many questions surrounding it. Servers are extremely polite, attentive and caring. However, when you're there for lunch with almost no other patrons in the restaurant, dessert should not take 30 minutes.Summary:This place is nice but pretentious. The food is mildly tasty yet priced laughably high based on quality. The service is hit or miss. I would not return.",5,1,

183,Annie P.,"Fairfax, VA",1812,1013,933,5.0,7/4/2013,"After thinking this whole time that a brunch party involved good food and unlimited mimosas, I was blown away after experiencing my first real brunch party for my BFF Aileen W's birthday at Saturday brunch at Bagatelle.If you're here during regular brunch time, (11AM-3PM) the restaurant is appears to be a classy, fine dining experience with lounge music playing in the background.  By 3:30/4PM, the music gradually begins to get louder, the curtains close, and the real party begins.  The DJ plays a mix of top 40s/house music, everybody's dancing (they even allow dancing on the tables!), sparklers everywhere for each bottle opened, and people being carried on couches.Our whole experience was great from start to finish.  There's a variety of different dishes that are a fusion of French and American dishes -- my personal favorite was the lobster omelet.  Their drink menu is beyond extensive, especially when it came to champagnes, which ranged from a $75 bottle of Veuve to a $30,000 (!!!) bottle of Dom Perignon!  We ended up getting a few bottles of champagne and a HUGE sangria pitcher (see my photo) which was enough for 8 of us.If you don't meet the table minimum for drinks, you'll get kicked out of your table within 2 hours -- but you can move to the bar and continue the party there!  The dress code fits the typical Meatpacking District look -- trendy, swanky, and classy!The brunch party ends at 6PM.  I would recommend making the latest reservations so you will be able to enjoy the brunch party!",15,3,6
184,Sheldon S.,"New York, NY",551,189,85,5.0,3/2/2016,"Some friends and I recently went to have a wonderful feast on a Thursday evening. At about 7:30 on a cold night right off a cobble stone street in the Meatpacking District I arrived to a warm welcome at Bagatelle. Before I even reached the bar to wait for the rest of my party to arrive I encountered five different employees, all greeting me with huge beautiful bright smiles.The restaurant that happened to be the setting for our evening was what might be considered the birth child of when classy got with hip. Or perhaps a better description, it was the result of when a bunch of undercover hip people, including the staff, showed up at a classy restaurant. This all became very evident, reaching the point of being unmistakable, as soon as I laid eyes on the cool suggestive artwork donned by the walls. Then again, the restaurant might have described itself best, ""...the chic St. Tropez meets Paris."" This place is legendary for its epic party-like brunches, but now can also be touted for its great food with the masterpieces from Chef Sébastien.Once my entire party of 7 arrived we commenced with our communal style meal with appetizers and wine at about 8 pm. We started with salad, grilled octopus, homemade gnocchi, black truffle pizza, ahi tuna tartar, king crab leg, and main diver scallops. Like myself, the entire group enjoyed everything, but I also had a few personal favorites of my own.Grilled Octopus, aka Poulpe Grillé à la Plancha(white bean hummus, crispy Yukon gold, Kalamata olives aioli)...was juicy, tender and flavorful. Suddenly I don't know if I can ever look at Ursula off the Little Mermaid the same way again. Where you may see evil, I see potential, a lot of delicious potential. Whoever thought octopus could taste this good?Homemade Gnocchi, aka Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas(black truffle pesto filling, truffle sauce)...was perfectly cooked with an excellent texture and by far the best I have ever had. Thought to originate in the Middle East, whomever first created gnocchi would be very pleased with what has come of it, at least the gnocchi I had.Black Truffle Pizza, aka Pizza à la Truffle Noire(black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamoza)...was extremely flavorful, decadent in a good way, but also well balanced. To even call something that taste so unique, but still so good 'pizza' seems blasphemous. Yeah, I was lucky enough to have two slices due to everyone else's efforts to King Crab Leg, aka Ceviche de Crabe d'Alaska(king crab leg, habanero & citrus ""leche de tigre"", smoked trout roe)...was remarkable as the sweet flavors of crab danced with acidic citrus and lightly spicy habanero. This was a threesome I am fully willing to stand behind anytime if it looks like this.After our light and not so light apps the more hearty heavy hitters came out. We had whole-truffle chicken, center cut beef tenderloin, and pan seared marinated Hudson Valley duck breast. Of the three I enjoyed the Châteaubriand - Pour Deux best (24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn sauce - for two). The truffle potato purée might have been the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. They were thick and richly flavorful. Not really sure what else I should say about them. I will just add this though. Immediately I formed a gripe towards every other establishment I've ever had truffle anything from. Every single thing Chef Sébastien put truffles in or on that we ate was simple amazing. Hell, I didn't even think I cared that much for truffles before Bagatelle. Up until this point I've been cheated of great truffle experiences and someone owes me answers!Next came the desserts. We had Italian meringue crisp, white chocolate tart, dark chocolate mousse, and caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff....drops spoon!!!! The Chouchou Caramel though! Wow! ...caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff and milk chocolate caramel sauce, was incredible! On your visit you should tell your server Sheldon sent you, then ask for it because it isn't on the menu. Okay, that will most likely increase your chances of getting the Chouchou by 0%, but it sounded good. HaHaCenturies after spices and food from around the world was made available to the rest of the world, a mad scientist figured out how to pair these ingredients together perfectly. Chef Sébastien is an evil genius with a life goal of dooming everyone who is fortunate enough to partake in his delicious creations. He wants to doom us to eternal gluttony! I'm convinced of it and can't wait to partake again.",49,29,37

We could only finish 1/2 of the entrees before we asked to have them wrapped so we could save room for desert. The desert was out of this world.

187,Laura C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",753,759,1634,5.0,10/8/2013,"My sister needed me to accompany her to the city for what I thought would be a nice, quiet Sunday brunch for a friends birthday party.Oh how wrong we were.We approached Bagatelle to see tightly drawn shades, low bass-thumping music, and two bouncers standing outside the front door. We were running a bit late, but luckily our friend had reservations to be there so it wasn't a problem for us to get in once they found her name on the list. So there's a key point, make a reservation (at least on the weekends).We arrived around 3, which is just the time when the lights get turned down, the music gets pumped up, and the party apparently really begins.Our friends had already eaten so we found them at the bar, knocking back those overpriced city drinks. My sister ordered a mojito and I had a caipirinha, the total of those drinks were $34. Come with your wallet full, or already drunk if you really want to have a good time. The music was great, and I found myself constantly questioning why this formula was working while I couldn't understand it. Here people were, eating their fancy brunches all dressed up, and then they'd hop up on their seat and start dancing. Totally bizarre, but COMPLETELY awesome! They've got great lighting, great music, and the wait staff/bar staff were all gorgeous. They rely on gimmicks to get the crowd riled up, but they're fun not cheesy. I had such a fun time and couldn't believe I partied that hard and left when it was still DAYLIGHT out. I need to return, with reservations, a big appetite, and a bigger appetite to party.So strange but it works.",4,,
188,Joanna S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,60,30,3.0,11/20/2015,"Want to feel like you are in the south of France with the harbour right outside then head here during the summer and head to one of the famous brunch all dayers, but book in advance especially if there is a big crowd (usual brunch rules)! Perfectly located in Chelsea. This is a super spot to have a boozy brunch with fantastic cocktails and great food which offers the usual raunch meals such as French toast, egg benedict however the food looks beautiful and tastes just as good. This doesn't offer a bottomless brunch type of deal so isn't a bargain but if you want an all day brunch where everyone is dressy to brunch, yes girls whip out the heels and a dress, then head here. It has the classic Chelsea crowd! If there's a large group of you then check out the photo booth downstairs near the bathroom to get some fun snaps of the day!

190,Melanie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1286,564,381,4.0,2/19/2015,"Okay...if you only read one Bagatelle review, you need to read this one. I'm going to give you the FULL rundown of Bagatelle boozy-brunch Sundays.SO! To start, you better make a reservation. Don't even think of trying to come to Bagatelle on a Sunday brunch day and expect to be seated at a table. That's laughable. You MAY be able to get in and stand at the bar but who the hell wants to do that? Reservation time? This depends on if you want to eat beforehand. If you want to eat in peace without sitting in darkness and hearing music so loud you can't talk to anyone at the table then make it for 2:30/3pm. That will allow you time to order food and eat it before the madness starts. At exactly 3:30 the music starts going full-on. Make sure you also arrive within 10/15 minutes of your reservation or you risk them not allowing you to sit at your reserved spot.Second of all, if you come with just a party of 2 for brunch, be prepared to have a shitty table. Yeah, I said it. I didn't see one party of 2 people that had an even halfway decent table. Two of the 2-top tables are literally in like the hallway/walkway of the restaurant so there will be tons of people blocking the view of the place. If you come to Bagatelle and want to do it right, get at least 4 people and make a day of it.Third of all, at tables for large parties it's bottle service only. You can get some relatively cheaper wine bottles so it's not like you'll be shelling out thousands of dollars on boos but just keep that in mind that everyone will be pretty much drinking the same thing. They have this huge (I don't even know how to really properly describe it) almost like a vase thing filled with boos and there are like 10 straws in it so you can share (if wine and champagne isn't your thing). Basically, everything alcohol-wise is shared.Food. Yes, order food here. It is after all, a brunch. I ordered the tuna tartare. I was a little skeptical because I hadn't had Bagatelle food in a long time and ordering raw fish was not the first choice for me but I didn't want something super sugary (pancakes/nutella) or super fattening (lobster mac & cheese/pizza) so I went with a much healthier option and it did not disappoint. Seriously, it was the best tuna tartare I've ever had (see photo that I uploaded with my review). It comes with chips to dip which I did not show in the picture, but seriously this is a must-order even to share as an appetizer (or main-course).Now on to the scene. Yes every girl will be wearing a Chanel bag and look like she just took 7 hours to get ready. Yes you may see some creepy dudes with sunglasses on who look like they have a Jersey Shore audition after brunch but come on people, this is Bagattelle. It is to be expected. Just set your expectations properly.If you order certain bottles of champagne and alcohol, they do their own show just for you in front of everyone. I believe it's $1,500 minimum but they deliver your bottle in really unique ways and never the same way twice. For instance, they can have 5 guys holding up one guy with your bottle and he's dressed as superman. The music cues as well so it's a big eye-catching production. If you want to see and be seen, I'd opt for that.Now, on to the bill. I left early and gave him cash towards the bill for my portion of everything. I informed my friends of this and told them how much I gave so they could make sure that the bill was properly adjusted. He did not tell them at all that I had paid anything nor did he adjust it off of the bill. So, had I not told them exactly what I gave him, he would have tried to play it off like I never paid. I didn't like this at all because it just showed how shady he was. I think that they assume people get so drunk and want to take advantage as many others have stated in the reviews as well. SOOO be very careful with what your order. Even though you're having a good time, just try to monitor exactly what you guys order so that no surprises come at the end.All & all, this is a really fun brunch spot for a special occasion. I wouldn't make this an every week thing, but it's a fun thing to do once in awhile. I have also had dinner here on regular nights and wasn't disappointed but the music was too loud for dinner. Anyways, for brunch, this is a go-to spot.",15,4,4

So we waited about an hour and 20 mins before we were seated!! CRAZY!  If it wasn't my friend's bday I probably would have left cause that's nuts.  Also the place became super crowded while we were waiting, so no matter where we stood we were in the way.  Around 3 is when they shut the curtains and the dance party starts.  One of our friends had the sense to go get some champagne and we had some mimosas while we waited.  Finally we were seated, right by the DJ, but at least we were away from the crowd by the bar.  So literally 5 mins after we were seated they were taking our order, apparently once you're seated they don't waste any time. We waited to be seater longer than it took for us to order, receive and eat our food. I had low expectations for the food, but it surprised me and what I got was really good.  I got the short rib sliders which had grilled pineapple, cheese and coleslaw on top.  I also got a side of fries which were really good too.  Expensive, but good.  One of our friends ordered a bottle of champagne to arrive at the table via a waiter dressed as (i think) George Washington, along with lots of sparklers.  This happened a lot throughout the day, all with different characters: superman, yoda, storm trooper, ghost buster, etc.. I though the music was pretty good, and it was fun to get up and dance once we finished our food.  We even ordered a LARGE sundae for my friend, which also came out with sparklers around it.  Overall I did have fun, but I didn't pay for any of the alcohol we drank, so I don't know if I would have been as happy at the end of the day if i had.  I also don't think I would have had as much fun without drinking.  This place is just not really my scene.  It was fun for my friend's birthday and I think she had a good time, but I don't know that i'll be back any time soon.  I mean waiting an hour and 20 mins when you have a reservation is really unacceptable..",3,,1
