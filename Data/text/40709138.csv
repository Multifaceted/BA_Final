0,Jailene R.,"Lowell, MA",57,32,27,4.0,11/19/2018,"I visited Thalia with a group of three others after having a bad experience at another restaurant. We called second dinner but really it was the star of the night. It was about 8:30 on a Saturday, so prime time for dinner in New York. We were seated quickly and our drinks were brought out within three minutes of ordering them. I'm not going to lie, it's a pricey place. I was a bit sticker shocked but believe me it's worth it. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It was just over $30 and the portion wasn't tiny but I definitely needed to have ordered a side with it. It was baked in a small cast iron pan with bread crumbs on top. What a winner! It was creamy and a slightly thicker cheese sauce than I'm used to. The lobster flavor almost melted into the pasta and it packed a lot of punch. The lobster itself was mostly claw but I got a few good bites of tail. The lobster still had a buttery coating on it and was extremely juicy. My friend ordered an array of oysters and I ordered three of their oysters that were the specials (about $3.50 each). I'm not a big fan of oysters but they were pretty delicious. Will definitely be making my way back to Thalia soon!",,,
1,Autumn H.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,11/11/2018,"So last night I was invited to a restaurant to enjoy a birthday attended by many others. Upon arrival there was already a few of us seated in the back and we had an amazing waitress who tended to our every need. Half way through the night our waitress shift was finished and she introduced us to another waitress that would be taking over. After our first waitress left everything went downhill very fast. The new waitress tending to us  would disappear for time after time, no where to be found not helping any of the guest that was attending this birthday dinner at all. I literally had to go on a wild goose chase/ scavenger hunt just to get water which wasn't served by her but another waiter I was able to pull aside. The table was packed with dirty empty plates that people were done with and she continued to to only move a plate and fork at a time instead of clearing out the table so we had room for the cake. On top of that we brought our own cake which we asked the hostess in the front if there would be any charge and she said no it will be fine just to find out 20 minutes late there was a charge of 2.50 per slice of cake. Plus our really terrible waitress tried to over charge us by putting on each receipt a charge of 2.50 four times. She even tried to tell us that the bill couldn't be separated and we could only use 3-4 credit or bank cards. We asked her to bring a manager so we could figure out the madness she had created. The manager wasn't even present and which we were told that he was only 5 minutes away which actually turned out to be and 1 and 30 minute wait for the person who throw the birthday dinner.As a person who's worked in customer service and retail for 2 1/2 years this was the worst service I've ever seen and I've ever received. No body deserves to go through this type of chaotic madness we received last night. I hope if this company and business expects to keep making money and receiving customers they must step up the people they hire to serve their customers. I couldn't be more upset about the service we received last night just extremely terrible.",2,,
2,Taj W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,22,88,1.0,11/11/2018,"This used to be a great spot. For whatever reason, things have changed. Two weeks ago, I called Thalia's to organize my birthday dinner for I and 15 guests. The host ensuredme that I would be sitting at the front of the restaurant with my guests and that separate, individual checks would NOT be an issue.The day of the birthday dinner, I arrive at the restaurant first and I am told by the host that I am being seated in the back. I asked what happened to them sitting me in the front, and they explain that they feel that it would be better to sit in the back. I was then informed that if the front tables open up, they will relocate my party there(but they wouldn't have to do that if they sat me there in the first place).As we begin to order food, the manager comes over to inform me that the restaurant does not do separate checks. I asked why not and he informed me that the computer system is from 1997 and that it neverdid separate checks, which is untrue, because all three past birthday dinners I had here were held here because they did separate checks and it made it easier for everyone. He said that each table could use three credit/bank cards each to pay the bill, which I found verystrange.Halfway through the meal, our waitress left and another waitress named ""Paola"" took over and things went completely downhill from there. Orders were forgotten more than once and when the food did come, therewas never an apology offered. Also, one guest brought a cake and was told by the host that there was NO CAKE FEE, and as soon as we are about to sing happy birthday, we are told that there is a cake plating fee of $2.50 per person by the waitress. Why wasn't this told to uswhen the cake was brought in?When it was time to split up the bill to pay, everyone offered to pay their share of the bill some with card and some with cash yet the waitress still manage to screw that part of it up. Honestly I felt like since she didn't know how to work a basic calculator, perhaps they should've given her an abacus. After everyone paid the waitress informed me that there was still $163 that was unaccounted for that needed to be paid. I asked her to point out which items were not paid for and three of the items that she pointed out had already been paid! I even had the person who paid them send a copy of the receipt to my phone so that the waitress could see it. The problem is she didn't look at all the receipts and immediately started accusing people in my party of not paying which was extremely unprofessional. I also asked why they charged for plating of the cake for 16 slices of the cake when there was only seven that needed to be paid for. At this point I asked to speak to the manager and I was informed that he left for the evening and they called him and that he would be back and that he was five minutes away. That five minutes turned into an hour and a half wait for him to come back to the restaurant so I could discuss this billing issue with him. Immediately upon him entering the restaurant he completely refused to make eye contact with me and started to reconcile the register and then when he was done he walked into the kitchen and close the door. Mind you while he was in the front reconciling the register the pork tender told him twice that I was waiting to speak to him and he mumbled something as if he couldn't be bothered. When he finally came back out around 1:45 in the morning to speak with me immediately had an attitude and was dismissive of my questions and concerns. He then reminded me that if I didn't like the way things were done at the restaurant I should've taken my business elsewhere. Mind you I have patronize this restaurant for years almost in a row and it's in fortunate that because of the unprofessionalism and lack of common sense with the staff I will not be back and I will tell everyone that I know not to come here. The two past managers that they had here (Tom L.) were amazing to deal with and they emailed you and followed up prior to when you had your event; this manager obviously doesn't do that. There is absolutely no correspondence regarding any changes in whatever your requests are; you just find them out when you get there. Don't come to this restaurant as they are much better restaurants with better tasting food than this one. The service has totally went down the drain and the manager Carmine is the most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. I asked him why it took an hour for him to come back to the restaurant when he told the bartender he was around the corner and he said to me that his dryer blew up and there was water all over his apartment but that's none of my business. He also explained that he single-handedly saved this restaurant (Thalia) because it was doing so bad and struggling before he came along. I am sure ""Shaul"", the owner, would love to hear that. In closing, save yourself the headache and take your business  elsewhere.",3,,
3,Robert H.,"Washington, DC",544,95,68,3.0,11/10/2018,"This place looked packed at brunch so I popped in for dinner. Sat at the bar, service was terrific! Staff were super friendly. We recommended to try the salmon. The salmon filet was great! But the rest of the plate was underwhelming. Brussels sprout needed salt and were simply boiled - lacked any remarkable flavor. Pumpkin purée was mediocre (and I looooove pumpkin). There was also this very interesting (and bland) cream sauce on the salmon. For the price point, and flare, I would have expected more dynamic flavors, and technical cooking. I'd come back if others wanted to, but probably won't come back of my own fruition.",,,
4,Dolly M.,"Roseland, NJ",9,105,302,4.0,11/8/2018,"This has been a standard for pre-theater dining!! I can recall many good meals shared here with family and friends accompanying me to a memorable night of Broadway entertainment. Tonight, we started our evening here, and we both ordered the beet salad ( awesome!) and followed by encrusted ahi tuna, served over thin thin noodles, with a mix of vegetables!! Very flavorful and fresh tasting! Dessert ( chocolate lava cake, with vanilla ice cream, were a perfect topping to our dinner! Overall a great way to start our evening,at Thalia. Highly recommend.",,,
5,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,8/9/2018,"For the longest time I avoided Thalia imagining it to be a tourist trap. Yes it's very closely located to broadway and hence the target audience being the theatre goers, but I believe it's for everyone to enjoy. I do agree with fellow yelpers about the decor being a mismatch, but it somehow still gives you a nice feel. The space is huge with plenty of tables, booths and space around the bar. I was most impressed with their service. Such a welcoming and happy server! He was very knowledgeable about the menu and gladly recommended us suggestions for food.I got the three cheese ravioli. Very very appetizing. You can't go wrong with it. It's cheese and cheese ! With right amount of tomato sauce and added seasoning. My husband got the Ciopinno. For 30 bucks this dish is totally worth it. I didn't think it was overpriced as this place is called out to be. The potion size quite generous. Comes with garlic toast this melange of Prawn mussels clam squid with white wine sauce is a heavenly delight.  Wouldn't want to miss it for the world!!Which brings me to the final course. The dessert. It was my husband's birthday and he asked me hopefully I haven't ordered dessert in advance cause he had so much sweet the entire day he didn't want anymore. But of course I had requested in advance which they brought at the end of our meal. After eating the molten choco lava cake served with dulce de leche ice cream we were so so happy! He's like I take back my words. Totally worth the calories. Don't even think about it. I loved their ice cream part and it worked beautifully with the warm melted chocolate. This is what heaven must taste like!  I have to thank the employees including the chef and the sever for the wonderful meal!",4,1,4
6,Jennifer J.,"Kingfield, ME",50,93,118,4.0,7/6/2018,"I wish there were half stars because I think this welcoming little restaurant/bar deserves more than 3 but not quite 4. It is strange because when one is in an area that is loaded with the restaurants the star giving is more challenging then when one is in an area of very few restaurants to choose. The extra .5 goes to the $1 oysters alone. If the did not have those; I likely would have given 3. I am a small town girl and expensive drinks just hinder my star benevolence. My gin and tonic with cranberry splash; while tasty was TOO small. What can I say-I'm a cheap drinker. Big and tasty is better. I'm not saying monster big, but last awhile big...I was there a bit early on a Thursday, but they did start to fill-in the bar stools as the ""happy hour"" progressed. It was a 2-person crew crowd that filtered in. Single peeps came in too. All comfortably seated at the bar. No wait and no standing.I liked their menu. A mix of items for everyone. The sushi rolls looked great, my oysters were fresh. The shucker needs more practice-shell bits! The mignonette was one of the best I have had. I usually prefer cocktail sauce, but didn't miss it! I totally would have eaten more had I not been touring about with plans for a later dinner. So I do recommend if you like oysters visit here. Not sure in NYC you'll get $1 oysters!",1,,
7,Lily D.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,11/8/2018,"Thalia's is a great place for drinks, appetizers and dinner!  I enjoy the happy hour oysters (raw bar) and drinks!  Miguel, the manager, is super friendly and inviting!  He always makes me feel like family when I visit.  The waitresses, Paula and Carolina, are attentive and thorough!  The bartenders, Stacey and Katey, are also friendly and often make great wine suggestions. Aside from the fresh raw bar, burgers and truffle fries, which are good, I highly recommend the Steamed Prince Edward Island Mussels appetizer, and the Squid Ink Capellini (clams, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari, spicy marinara, tequila-cilantro sauce) for dinner!!  Absolutely delicious!!Lily D.",,,
8,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",92,155,93,5.0,8/21/2018,"This is a lively, vibrant venue in the Theatre district that has an extensive menu featuring a wide variety of seafood as well as vegetarian options/pastas etc. If you're seated in the lounge, you can also order from the lounge menu which has other seafood and bar snacks and appetizers. My friends and I ordered the NY strip steak, Angry Ebi, Thalia rolls as well as the crab cake and thought all were delicious. The service was excellent and we all had a great evening there. This place mostly caters to tourists who are stopping by before or after a show in the area but if you love seafood and just a fun environment, I would recommend it!",1,,2
9,Huilin C.,"Manhattan, NY",29,59,82,3.0,4/20/2018,"Dinner on  Monday Pros:1. Very spacious.2. No wait time, we didn't reserve a table. But probably because we came in on a Monday night.3. Our waiter is very nice. They have pre theater dinner that only serves between 5 and 7 pm. We came around 7:40 but waiter was kind enough to make an exception.4. I recommend the lobster bisque, very delicious and perfect for a chilly evening.Cons:I had diarrhea 3 hours after dinner. I'm not sure what caused it, highly likely the salmon.",2,,1
10,Deana T.,"Baltimore, MD",142,72,40,4.0,5/30/2018,"I stopped into Thalia for a quick dinner before seeing a show on Broadway and it turned out to be a great experience. I really don't understand the negative reviews here.I was able to come in without a reservation and was seated immediately so that was already a plus. Our waiter asked if we were seeing a show later and when we said yes, he was sure to provide nice and fast service so we could make it to the show with some time to spare. I ended up going with the Ciopinno and was very pleased. There were shrimp, baby scallops, mussels, clams, and squid in a delicious white wine tomato sauce. The sauce was super flavorful (a tad salty if you're sensitive to that) and all of the seafood tasted fresh and perfectly cooked. My only complaint is the portion. For $30, I only got four mussels and one clam, a few shrimp, and the rest was mostly squid and baby scallops. I was really hoping for more clams and mussels as they are my favorite. So for the price, it felt a little skimpy. The inside was clean, but the tables were pretty close together. I'd be happy to come back again before another show!",,,
11,Jon P.,"Vancouver, Canada",157,12,4,2.0,10/5/2018,"Service is pretty horrendous here. Took 15 minutes for the waiter to even come and offer water after being seated.  I would understand if it was really busy, but it wasn't at all when we came.. also gave an unneeded attitude towards us and other customers as well while I was observing his behavior.Portions are also too small for the cost.  Location is convenient to all the Broadway theaters, but I wouldn't come back here. Food is ok but not worth a trip back.",2,1,1
12,Brian S.,"New Orleans, LA",3,54,0,2.0,11/9/2018,"This used to be a favorite restaurant of mine having gone there a number of times over a period of years and always enjoyed it. I went on Nov. 7 to discover that it seems to be under new management. I wouldn't have minded that the dining room went thru a renovation and the menu had changed, but it looks dumpy now (which isn't a big deal) and the food was ok but nothing more. Plus service was meh with a server who replied that everything we ordered was an ""excellent choice"" and there was a bit of a muck-up that could've been handled better. (The one exception, I and my companions agreed, were the efficient busboys who were constantly refilling water glasses and clearing the table (tho occasionally even before we were completely finished with something (which, of course, they left until we were done with it)).There are probably worse restaurants in this price range in the Broadway area but I'd like to think that there are now better ones as well. I guess I'll be finding out as it's, sadly, unlikely that I'll return to Thalia",1,1,
13,Mark H.,"Manhattan, NY",45,502,4,2.0,6/27/2018,"I had some decent pork/veal/beef polpette in a flavorful tomato sauce the other night here at the bar.  I say only decent because they were not so tender but sort of tough throughout... even crispy outsides and tender insides would have been preferable.  But the 2 TVs over the bar tuned to Fox News were enough to ensure that I won't be returning here.A shame, particularly because of the friendly and efficient bartender who served me.",2,2,
14,Jack U.,"New York, NY",2,10,5,1.0,9/6/2018,"The other night I came in for dinner--always have seen this spot and so curious, but never went in. This should be a positive review: truly, the food was amazing, and the tall man who helped up was a typical New Yorker (that's not a compliment). But the reason this place gets one star, even though it was so entertaining to watch? There was this one woman who clearly has no value for her job or the people who work with her. There was no host, unless this woman drinking at the bar was the host! This woman with a blazer and what looked like unwashed long black hair (and not great B.O.) came over from the bar at which she clearly had a drink. She had alcohol clearly on her breath and seemed out of it. She sat us down and she went back to where she was perched, drinking glass after glass of wine. (I feel like she drank a whole bottle by the end of my time there.) What was frightening was the way this woman was flirting up a storm with who knows how many people at the bar and getting too raunchy for work and dang was so loud. Not a great environment for eating a nice meal. It actually became a show--albeit a disgusting one--watching her interact with other employees too. She would be all touchy feely with one, and then bark at others and give them nasty looks. Another visiting couple next to us was watching too and they said: ""Can you believe that's how they act here in New York?"" I responded: ""I've lived here a long time and I've never seen an employee at a fine dining establishment act like this."" All of us agreed: as funny as it was watching her, we won't be back.  Whoever's in charge, take note. You can't have staff like that.",5,3,
15,Caroll W.,"New York, NY",278,35,43,2.0,9/15/2018,We went at 730 to get a start on some drinks before oyster happy hour. The bread tasted stale. Drinks where/are expensive and weak. We ordered 30 oysters they came out in 5 min. It should not take less than 5 min for 30 oysters to be shucked and plated. Also they were not cold. Came home and stuff was coming out both ends. Thalia used to be my go to but no more. On the Bright side of service waiter was nice. Bussers kept hovering didnt understand why since we were the only people left,1,1,

I had a great experience from the custom menus with my name and event on them to the fact that they were able to manage to get a birthday cake even though that's not something they typically do.  I really appreciate when managers go above and beyond to make the guest happy. My Mom would also like to add (she doesn't have a Yelp) that Miguel helped with all of the details of setting up the birthday celebration and being able to get the cake and Jacob was the manager on duty night of helping make the event go smoothly and everyone had a good time. The food was good as well and they had an option for everyone. Overall great birthday celebration, good food and good time.",,,

The volume was fairly loud, lots of chatter and laughter. Certainly not for a quite romantic wine and dine. However great date spot. Food came out fairly fast. Steak was delicious as well as seafood pesto spaghetti. Dessert was wonderful! Drinks could have been slightly stronger and this is coming from someone  who is NOT a heavy drinker. Price point is up there $$$ brace yourself!

Updated review","Ordered two steaks medium rare. They both came out with no pink at all. When we sent them back the manager, Tony, came by to essentially argue about whether or not the steaks were medium rare or not. He kept asking, so do you want your steak a little rarer... um... yeah that's kind of what medium rare means. Once corrected the food was good and the wait staff was great. Sadly, the manager ruined the experience. He seems a little out of his element and seems more qualified to be running a Waffle House than this restaurant. I won't go back for that reason. UPDATE: wanted to add a picture of the message I received from the manager in response to this review. As you can see, he's a few cards short of a full deck.",16,8,1
24,Yuri Y.,"Ridgewood, NJ",422,413,1447,2.0,8/3/2017,"Dinner at Thalia last night was like a Laurel and Hardy skit -- you know -- who's on first, what's on second -- Tower of Babel stuff.  We walked in on a Wednesday night without reservations 90 minutes before our curtain -- were seated in a very comfortable corner table -- bar side -- and told by our server and the Manager that dinner would be served in time for us to make our show -- ""we've been doing this a long time"" said the manager -- and ""we know how to get our customers to make curtains.""So far -- so good.45 mins later we were still waiting on our appetizers -- simple dishes like ceviche and mussels in a broth.  The ceviche was mostly lime juice and veggies -- you'd need a microscope to spot seafood (at $16) -- but the mussels were well prepared -- fresh shellfish in a spicy and perfectly seasoned broth -- with decent bread for mopping.An hour after being seated -- still no mains.  Our waitress disappeared.  The gentleman bussing tables spoke little English and looked confused when we gestured about our lack of food. The manager made all sorts of hand gestures from a distance suggesting the food was on its way -- and still no dinner.WTF??When the food arrived -- 25 mins before our curtain -- my salmon was raw inside and the brussels sprouts were hard -- like chewing on pebbles.  I sent it back.  The manager apologized and within minutes -- a new dish of salmon (properly cooked) appeared -- but with the same veggie flaws.  They took my utensils with the raw fish dish -- which sent me scouring for new ones (not easily found) taking up even more time. The manager apologized again -- said he yelled at the kitchen staff -- and did not charge us for the salmon dinner.Sweetie suggested this place because she worked across the street for years and remembers the service and food differently from our experience last night.  I can't recommend Thalia for a pre-show meal folks unless you want to risk the stress of a long wait and kitchen miscues.Thalia is a busy place -- right smack dad in tourist alley and it may be unreasonable of me to expect good food and good service -- but then again -- why not.  Should've ordered the $1 oysters like all the other Yelp reviewers suggested.  Hard to screw that up.",23,6,9

Mind you... parties who were seated after us were served and on their way out. We were sitting in an almost empty restaurant when our entrées finally came - OVER an hour later. We were severely underwhelmed. Food is below average. Mac and cheese with microscopic pieces of lobster. Pasta served cold. My friends ended up missing their bus.

28,Elijah M.,"Madison, WI",693,115,1,3.0,5/31/2018,"Retro 90's nostalgia, not in a good way. Like the idea of what a ""high end"" restaurant should be, executed poorly, with mismatching decor and concepts, and then poorly maintained for 20 years. There was too much painted drywall in the space, and in some places the trim had ripped out. The large format theater posters were pretty good!You can't beat 1$ oysters, very good for the price. If I went again, this would be all I would order. Everything else on the menu was overpriced and just ok. The serving rhythm was weird, the lobster bisque coming out very quickly, but then a very long delay for oysters, and mains shortly after. Music taste was straight from late 90's early 2000s rock top 40 charts, really jarred with the whole experience. We had a good server.

Food was over priced for what you would normally get but that's my fault for eating so near a touristy area. A big caveat, we ordered shots to go with our meals cause you know vacation drinks  anyways they thought it'd be wise to charge us for chasers which happens WHERE?! That's right chasers and I'm assuming to up the total for the empty restaurant or to increase the percentage in the tip.

There were plenty of seats available during dinner time on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 dozen oysters, and got 4 that were just straight up rotten. The other oysters are very creamy in an odd way. Their port wine is good, definitely try it if you go.I'm not sure how the rest of their food fares since we only got oysters and drinks, but I would avoid the oysters if you come here. The ambiance is nice for a casual date.",1,,1

My friends are perpetually late to everything, so I ended up having to change my reservation a couple times, but the staff was super friendly and accommodating.We ordered the burrata to start and it was fantastic- even echoed by my friends who are picky eaters, so much so that we ordered another plate after devouring the first. I ordered the scallops as my entree and it was also very delicious. I was a bit disappointed that for the price I only got 3 (albeit large) pieces. It was set on top of a tasty carrot purée that I was skeptical of at first, but turned out to be quite nice. My friends ordered the squid ink capellini, ahi tuna, and mushroom ravioli. All of the picky eaters rejoiced! Overall I really enjoyed the meal and the prices were very reasonable considering the quality.

Sorry, I'm not paying $8 for a bottle fo Blue Moon.I ordered the mussels, which were excellent.  My friends ordered a salad, fries, oysters, and the chicken.  The food was good but unremarkable.  The oyster deal is a little deceiving, since it doesn't start until 7 or 8.",1,2,

On the show's website it recommended Thalia & said that if we presented our tickets for the show we would receive a complimentary glass of wine. When we asked the server about this promotion he said he would check for us. He told us the promotion was no longer going on. It seemed odd because clearly the people at the Broadway show didn't know. It was disappointing. After that it took a long time for our server to even return to us, & it felt like he was maybe a little annoyed by us & our inquiries, although we didn't push the issue. After we finally got to order & the food came (which took quite a while), my order was wrong. Once the bill came, we realized that every item on our bill was $1-$3 more than the price listed on the menu. The food was pretty average, & the experience was below average. It gets 3 stars instead of 2 because the restaurant itself is beautiful, & if you're seeing a show in the area it is very convenient.",,,

61,Dani B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",845,208,262,1.0,4/10/2018,"What a dining disaster. If you're visiting from out of town, avoid this place. **Do not come here before a show! Even with 2 hours, you won't make it!** Party of 3, Saturday, 1230pm for a 2pm show. I live 3 blocks away after moving from Florida and was warned not to go here. But, I had 2 other people with me who were hungry and we had tickets for a show. It's close by.. that's where any of it's benefits end.Host says he can seat us in the bar area. We head in. We wait. We look at each other. We go to the front. We memorize the menu. We wait. We look at our watches. We see a server coming by for a table nearby and try to verbally make contact .. we try eye contact to get his attention... nothing. The patron he was helping says ""no use trust us.""  He has served them the wrong food.We go to the front. We tell the host we have to order .. we now have 45 minutes before the show. Its been 45 mins already. The host himself takes our order. 15 mins later, no tableware, no linens, no drinks we ordered (not complicated .. coffee and tea).. We go to the front. We ask what's going on. Two other patrons look at us.. they said ""going to the 2pm too?"" Yes indeed.. one says ""good luck getting service."" The host brings drinks and says they're complimentary.  By the way, the cola was highly watered down and was probably sitting around for that hour, tea was from a fountain tasting and coffee came with no milk.It's now 140pm. Nothing is happening. No one walking by will talk to us even as we make eye contact. No one will respond to our verbal requests for our food or service. It's beginning to look like homes in Nevada after the housing crisis. Some people around us were being served but most of them told us they were on their second hour of waitinNo food. Nothing received. The kid with us asks loudly ""what the heck is going on with this place? We are starving and it's been over an hour."" Well said kid. Still nothing received.  The other patrons look at their watch and say ""you better go. You'll miss your show."" Only problem Is ...everyone is hungry. In fact we skipped breakfast to go here. We run across the street and eat a Starbucks running down 8th to the theatre, ditch what we could not eat fast enough and barely walk in on time. We order junk food at the intermission to get us through the show.On the way out, we tell another host ""look we have to go, we literally just sat here for an hour and 20 minutes- what the heck are you doing, just letting people have a spot to rest before the show or is this a restaurant?"" He says ""oh sorry"".. we leave.. I mean - wow. Read the reviews and trust your friends. In other reviews vendors are saying they're not paying their bills. They'd have a better shot at it if they served food for money at this restaurant instead of letting people sit there table squatting for 90 minutes. That would probably be helpful.What a way to ruin an afternoon.Updated this after I saw 2 small mistakes",5,1,

Worst of all the manager was EXTREMELY rude when I gave him this feedback. He said very condescending ""sweety, we're really busy and I'm aware, do you think i don't know this I've been in the restaurant business for a long time"", and he took my plate away before I finished.

It turns out, however, that they are $1.50 oysters instead. Not a huge deal, but just something to be careful of.My friends and I ordered half a dozen oysters, some beers, and I ordered the lobster bisque. The $1.50 oysters are chefs pick, so I guess they are different each day. The day we went, they had a type of east coast oysters. They were juicy and meaty, but definitely too salty. This is personal preference though, so I guess it can't be helped.My lobster bisque was actually really good! However, at $11, I would not buy it again. I didn't try to beer, but my one friend got a dark beer and he was raving about how good it was, so I assume their beers are pretty good. The service was also very slow.

Because we arrived relatively early in the evening before the theatre crowd, we were able to make reservations easily.  Once seated, our wonderful waiter took our drink orders and brought us a house-made bread basket and olive spread.  I'm a sucker for bread and so is my family. (I think that my daughter and tried to OD on bread and olive spread.  My sister showed some restraint because she was ordering a burger served on bread.)  That bread and spread rocked!Because we were hungry, we did not play around with the menu.  Here's what we ordered:Me - Prix Fixe menu - Lobster Bisque with sweet corn, Roasted Half Free Range Chicken, house-made lemon sorbet with crispy merengue and biscottiMuff - Linguine Bolognese with braised beef cheek ragu, baby arugula, tomatoes and celena cheeseLuch - Thalia Burger - grass fed beef, gruyere cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, sesame brioche bun, herb friesThe lobster bisque didn't have a lot large chunks of lobster, but what it lacked in lobster pieces, it made up for in flavor and restaurants can and should be judged by their roasted chicken  Thalia's was superb with crispy skin and moist insides.  Yummy!  And I am not a dessert girl, but the lemon sorbet with crispy merengue and biscotti were outstanding.  I tasted my daughter's Linguine Bolognese with braised beef cheek ragu and she almost didn't get her plate back.  My sister also thoroughly enjoyed her burger and fries.From the décor, to the service, to the food, we were well pleased with our visit to Thalia!",2,,1

The hostess was very on top of finding out if we have a show and what time the show started. She passed this information along to our server.The prices threw me quite a bit when I looked at the menu. They are pretty high. My friend and I split the burrata appetizer which was $17. We couldn't believe i was so expensive but we just figured, we are in the theater district it's going to be pricey. The burrata came with roasted red peppers, reduced balsamic, roasted tomatoes, and pesto. Honestly, it was worth the price with everything else that came along with it. It was absolutely delicious. As an entree I got the mushroom risotto and my friend got the spaghetti with marinara. Both were excellent. The risotto was cheesy and full of truffle flavor. It was quite good. The pasta was also great. The marinara had great flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly. This is a good pre-theater option, albeit expensive. I would recommend making a reservation before going.

But I proceeded to choose a nice table amongst the ten or so that were free.My Eastern European waitress was pretty blunt in her welcome. Fair enough, who likes working Saturday night? I told her I couldn't eat dairy and I asked if there was anything on the menu that I could have (literally everything seemed to either be cooked in butter or made with cheese). She didn't seem too happy to engage in helping me out which was a bit annoying (and it's annoying enough anyway to not be able to eat anything with dairy in).Then she brought out some foccacia and butter, before saying ""oh wait, you can't have that, sorry"" and taking it away. I felt like one of those children in the supermarket when the parent takes the chocolate out of the basket.In the end I ordered the crab cake (which for the $16 price tag was literally three spoons of crab lumps on some chopped mango) and the squid ink pasta, which was better, but again the ratio of pasta (loads) to seafood (not enough) was disappointing.This is one of those places that looks expensive in the photo but is cheap and tacky when you touch it.

Buckle up.TLDR: cold food, long wait, rude manager, good dessert, very kind waitress.My mother and I are from HB, CA and are visiting New York for a short trip. A friend recommended this place highly for ""the best cheeseburger in NYC"", so we bith had high hopes. We made this a pit stop before seeing Jersey Boys nearby. Our hostess was extremely kind and sat us exactly at our reservation time. The restaurant had just opened its dining room, so we were among the first sat. We waited about 10 minutes for a drink order, and were being waited on well up until we ordered.We waited 30-40 minutes for a cheeseburger and the shrimp ""scampi"" while the rest of the restaurant filled up. We tried to reach our waitress, but she was busy fulfilling others' orders. We are so excited to dig in, but my mom's burger was barely room-temp, oversalted, and very dry. They also left the bacon on which she requested to be left out. My risotto was almost-cold and my shrimp also room-temp. The waitress brought me the manager who offered to reheat/refresh our food, but we were so hungry we'd eaten the majority of it. I asked him to reheat my risotto and he took it, threw it in a microwave, and slammed it back on my table. I didn't take more than a bite. The consistency was completely changed and it was now nuclear-hot. I was so upset that we didn't even get an ""I'm sorry"" for waiting for cold food.Our waitress apologized profusely and later offered us free dessert, which was greatly appreciated.Oh, did I mention the free dessert was only offered after I whipped out my phone to downlod the Yelp app and the manager walked by???So, yeah.",2,,

79,Jamie B.,"New York, NY",286,14,0,1.0,2/11/2018,Really don't recommend. Came today during brunch pre matinee with my family. The food was disgusting. Burger flavorless and chicken sandwiches so dry. $20 sandwiches should be at least descent. Even the fries were way over done. Caesar salads were salty and needed lemon. Just lettuce and cheese for $14 each. Ridiculous. Even nice restaurants have cheaper side salads.The staff was nice enough but not attentive at all. They would receive 2 stars. really disappointed. Surprised by the good reviews.,1,,

We sat in the lounge and the the tables were very small. The booth was legitimately mini sized and we barely fit on the chairs. The rest of the decor was pretty but nothing over the top.We had a few small plates to share. The margarita pizza was average. The crab cake was delicious; the mango salsa was on point. The lobster bisque was not traditional and it didn't taste good.Overall the experience was not a memorable one.,,,

It's perfectly located for theater goers like us. Unfortunately we didn't get to try any of the food, but the bubbly that the bartender recommended was delicious! I like that it's not too cramped or crowded, or at least during the time of day we were there. The bartender was in no rush, which contributed to the laid back but slightly upscale vibe. I was some signs for oysters specials (!!!) so I'd want to check that out next time.

He came back later and said he spoke to the manager and they would allow it.(everyone around us was ordering it, so he obviously made a mistake). Service was slooow. I don't mind taking my time in a restaurant, but this was annoyingly slow. Dessert that came with Prix fixe was either red velvet ice cream or banana sorbet? Um, yuck?",,,
88,Katherine G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/30/2018,"If giving negative stars was an option, this restaurant would get that. My friend and I stopped in here to grab a quick weekend brunch. We walked in around 2pm and it was fairly empty so we figured we wouldn't have to wait long. Clearly we thought wrong. We were served a muffin basket and our drinks fairly quickly and placed our order of an omelette (to add peppers was an extra $4?!) and a chicken sandwich after a few minutes.  After 30 minutes of chatting, finishing our first round of drinks and checking in to see how our food was coming along, we ordered another round and were assured that our food was almost ready. At first the waiter said that it should only be a few more minutes, after 5 more minutes he said that he could see the kitchen preparing it, after 10 minutes, he said that he would go back and check, after 20 minutes, the manager came out to tend to the other surrounding tables that were complaining and noted to us that he ""had yelled at the guys in the back to get our order ready."" Yelled at the guys? How unprofessional. No need to yell, just calmly deal with whatever issue is going on back there. Finally after a few more minutes we demanded proper timing and were again told that it would be a few more minutes. Seeing that we were not buying it this time, the waiter straight up told us that it might be best to just leave because there were issues with the kitchen and that he would not charge us for our drinks.I've never had such a lack of honesty from a wait staff and have certainly never had a waiter advise me to, essentially, get out while you can.With absolutely no strength or patience left, we crawled across the street to Pret A Manger for our glamorous Sunday brunch.

We were so happy that she chose Thalia. Because we arrived at 4:30 and dinner started at 5:00, we ordered some appetizers from the lounge menu. The waffle fries were very crisp, and the $1 oysters were heavenly At 4:50, the waitress took the dinner order, and we had the burger, the skirt steak, the Scottish salmon, and the shrimp scampi. Each dish was nicely presented and cooked exactly as requested. Even though they had a lot of people who were going to attend a show after dinner, they did not rush us at all. I noticed they have a special menu for pre-show clients, and given the proximity to the theatres, we would recommend this place highly. The price was right, just the kind of place you would bring relatives who have offered to pay! For those who wonder what that means, dinner for 4 with drinks (for 2) and tip came to $185.",,,

The buratta and ""heirloom"" tomato salad has no heirloom tomatoes at all but it has the price of a salad with heirloom tomatoes!  I asked the manager about this and he said it was a typo! It had unripened, tasteless plain tomatoes and it was not truthfully described on the menu. NOT worth the price. My hamburger arrived completely, literally as raw ground beef and was quickly taken away (when I showed the manager)  to be cooked. It returned slightly under temperature, but delicious. My husband's salmon was wonderful. All and all, we would NOT return or recommend this restaurant.

The roll was only 6 pieces of sushi and felt like it came from the supermarket across the street which charges half that amount. But the best part was the salad. It wa just a piece of chicken, 3 slices of avocado, a tablespoon of black beans and a tablespoon of tomatoes....for $19 bucks.

Updated review",So we decided to try this place again as our first time was after more than a few drinks and we partook in the ouster special. Back in town and in the mood for oysters again. So we Came back here on a Friday night for the $1 oysters.  Got 2 dozen. Amazing deal and the oysters were good!!!  Almost got 2 dozen more but alas dinner was coming. My partner ordered the squid ink pasta which was amazingly good.  And I had the seared sea bass special on arugula salad with a cold corn salad made with poblano peppers and mango. Let's just say both dishes were gone in 5 minutes. Wait staff was attentive but not intrusive.  Atmosphere is nice. Not too loud. Will definitely come back again,,,

But I got some delicious herb fries on the side ,  and I must say they were  amazing ! I couldn't stop munching on them !! It had such a zesty yummy taste. The food didn't take too long to come out,  maybe about 15 minutes . Our waiter that night was okay , she barley checked up on us , we had to flag her down every time we needed her , she also wasn't that friendly , not personable at all.

The wait staff was quite good, but the host stand was unfriendly. The layout isn't ideal, but what layout is ever ideal in this part of the city? For the price, I would have hoped for very slightly larger portions or for higher food quality, but the location explains why that's not so. I won't make a point to go out of my way to return, as there are better options within a few blocks (cheaper, better quality, better prices), but if the weather is awful and you need to be somewhere around the corner in a short time, it certainly will suffice.",,,

108,Peter K.,"Seaside Park, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,6/30/2018,"Stopped in for breakfast on  Tuesday 6.26. There were maybe 6 tables seated at the time all at vary stages of their visit. Immediately after being seated a busser awkwardly poured us water and walked away without saying a word. My wife and I then sat there for close to 20 minutes while we watched the server go to every other table never once stopping to greet us. We finally flagged down the host who said he would grab our server only to have him return to take our order. After about another 5 minutes the server finally made an appearance, not to apologize for the wait or introduce herself, but to find out how I wanted my steak and eggs cooked. While we were waiting for our food my wife's mocha arrived, but not my cup of coffee, that took asking again and still did not come until i was essentially done with my food. After our plates were cleared we sat for another 15-20 minutes waiting for our check. Despite walking past us multiple times it took legitimately waving our server down for her to come take our credit card. She returned a few moments later to tell us that their micros system was down and that they could not process credit cards at this time, instead we could either let them swipe our card now and they would email us a receipt, or we could go to the atm next-door. Despite us not having a problem with them swiping our card now the manager appeared to reexplain the issue to us and assure us that it was not just their problem but he checked with all the restaurants around and they're not working either. After running our card the server came back with a piece of paper for me to write my email on, and said they would email us that night. It is now Saturday and I still have not received my receipt though my card has been charged. In conclusion, the food is good, I can't complain about that. But if I was the owner of this place I would be embarrassed by my FOH staff. While my wife and I waited and flagged down people we watched 2 other tables walk out that morning because they were being ignored. If your server can't handle 7 breakfast tables you might want to look at finding a new server, or schedule 2 for the breakfast shift, or maybe your manager should jump on the floor and help when needed. The fact of the matter is service falls well short here, and from reading reviews after the fact it seems that this is not the first time they have missed the mark.",,,
109,Xiomara P.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,19,54,4.0,1/25/2018,"As soon as you walk in, you see the nice bar, and the big smile of the bar tender. I had a drink while waiting for my husband, for happy hour that was kind of cosmo... delicious!!! As my husband arrived we sat immediately, as we were going to a broadway show afterwards. Our server, Ryan, was delightful! He told us right away that he would make sure we were out at the right time for the show. For appetizer I had crab cake. One of the best crab cakes I've ever had! My husband had risotto au gratin. He loved it. I had seafood risotto for main course. This was ínsula of me because risotto usually feels very heavy after a few bites. This risotto was different. It was full of seafood, and although creamy, it wasn't too rich or heavy at all! I highly recommend it. My husband ordered 3 cheese ravioli and was very happy with it. Cheesecake for dessert which could do better with less of the berry topping; the cake itself was great. The atmosphere is informal and modern. The service was really good. Ryan was attentive and with great sense of humor. Overall we had a great experience and will definitely go back!... I hope we get Ryan again!",,,

Stick with pork belly, salads, the dragon roll.  Maybe crab cake if you aren't from MD or DE.  Not a lot of app options for sharing. Dinner was skirt steak but pretty bland. No salt or pepper to be found and no steak knifes.    Didn't ask but no one really commented on the food either way.   Think someone liked the lobster mac and cheese.   Limited wine list but cocktails looked pretty good.Would stick to the bar and apps and enjoy atmosphere after work but too many awesome places around town for me to make this a regular place.",1,,
114,Joe D.,"Manhattan, NY",37,19,7,2.0,2/20/2017,"The food was great. I have no complaints about the food or the drinks except that they're a little pricey for what they were. That alone gives this place a 3.5-4. The 2-star review stems from either the kitchen or the managers not knowing what it means to be a restaurant in the theater district. We had 5:30 reservations for a table of four and tickets to see a 7pm show. The restaurant was not empty, but it was by no means at full capacity. We had two waitresses (why?) who were both very nice but just didn't seem to follow how much time went between sitting, ordering, receiving our meals, etc. There was an extensive amount of time between each step of the process - and the kicker was our wait between 6pm and 6:45 to finally receive our entrees. We even got the checks once our food arrived and still weren't done signing until 7.  Again, the people were nice and the food was delicious, but this place is in the theater district and needs to know that. No restaurant should make you wait 45 minutes between your order and your entrees arriving (unless they specify on the menu that certain dishes are particularly challenging and time consuming), but the theater district is the one area of Manhattan where you can just about guarantee 90% of your customers have a time in which they need to be paying and out the door by. I hope this is just one bad experience, because everyone was friendly and the food was tasty, but definitely don't make pre-show plans without some more-than-expected time to spare.",2,,1

119,R K.,"Manhattan, NY",334,6,2,5.0,9/5/2018,"I usually go to Thalia for brunch on Saturday and Sundays because I live in the area. Their food is really good and they always have one free drink included in your brunch order which I think is very cool because the dishes are priced just as they would in any other brunch spot. They used to bring fruit salads with all brunch specials but now they switched it to salad. I love that the restaurant is huge and so spacious. You never feel suffocated like you would in any other restaurant in NYC. I also love that they have huge windows. It's really fun to sit by the window and watch what's going on outside (especially when it's cold outside :)). The service is really good but I think the person that really pulls everything together and ensures that there is outstanding service at this place is the restaurant manager Miguel. Miguel is always very friendly and extremely helpful. He has great personal relations with customers that are regulars. Once I was not happy with one of the wait staff who I think had just started working there and when I spoke to Miguel, he apologized and gave me 50% off on the check. In a lot of other restaurants they would not even bother to genuinely apologize (and I've been to plenty of those too!).. I will always go back to Thalia as long as Miguel is around.

When the food FINALLY arrived, my friend's burger, which he was told was only made with gruyere, came slathered in American cheese.  It was sent back, and 20 minutes later, the same burger and fries, now cold, had the remnants of the scraped off or age cheese covered with a slice of gruyere.  My friend just asked for it to be taken off the bill, and said jokingly, "" a round of drinks would be nice.""We asked the waiter to send the manager over as he seemed overwhelmed.The manager walked aggressively over to our table, clenching and unflinching his fists as he approached.  Instead of saying ""how can we improve the situation?""  He was threatening and aggressive, accusing us of trying to ""scam him out of drinks.""After patronizing this restaurant since it first opened and bringing people there for years, MY FRIENDS AND WIILL NEVER EAT OR DRINK HERE AGAIN.  I will also recommend others to skip it as well.",6,,

Food came out at a nice pace as well and was really quite good.One of the drinks wasn't exactly what we thought it would be and without us even asking the waitress noticed it and said, don't worry i'll get you something else or just take it off the bill. So thoughtful!Thanks to Miguel and his crew for making this a nice experience. We would definitely go back?",1,,

The pasta was a lot spicier than I thought and you can't taste the squid flavour in the pasta that much but the amount of seafood totally made up for it.I only had a bite of the mac 'n cheese so can't really comment on that.Also, I liked the crushed olives with olive oil sauce/paste that comes with the bread.

Neither did the second server they sent over. Assuming there was going to be two different oysters, we each ordered a dozen.When they placed the oysters in front of us, there was no denying that they all were the same west cost oyster. The oysters were fine, mostly medium sized and briney.When we asked for the check, we noticed that the tip was included, although the server did not tell us, and there were no markings highlighting the tip on the check.This really upset one of my guests, but we paid anyway.I don't think we will go back...",1,,

The waitress was accommodating and very helpful. In fact, she may have been the best part of our experience. If only she could have saved our marriage.Overall, the short-tempered general manger misleads- and lacks empathy with- restaurant patrons.  Even though you are constantly sweating through your shirt, we shouldn't have to over dinner.",1,,

Tonight we had the blue point oysters and they were really fresh. At first we ordered 30 to share amongst the 5 of us but then we wound up ordering another 30. I know other places have oysters for $1 but I'd be willing to pay a but more for quality oysters. One thing I did notice was that not all the oysters were the same size though.We also ordered the fried calamari which was pretty standard. Not much to rave about there but the portion size was decent. They have an extensive wine list and when asked about the different wines, the waitress seemed knowledgeable. My friend ordered the peppered cucumber cocktail and said it was good. Perhaps I'll give that a try next time.We came in at 8:30pm on a Friday night and there was no wait for a table.

We ordered the sesame crusted ahi Tuna and the skirt steak which were all mediocre dishes and the steak came out cold. The service continued to be extremely slow and it took another hour to just get dessert. It was clear we were the forgotten table.

142,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",608,466,229,4.0,10/28/2015,"Summary:  The bar is perfect for most meeting places. 3.5 is being rounded up to a 4 because Thalia will become that solid neutral choice for most people that live in the neighborhood.Atmosphere: 8th Avenue and westward is primarily packed with lower scale or trendy-dive places to fill it's old demographic's budget.  Thalia has been there for ages and is successful - I believe - because it caters to the ""Clinton"" crowd that while loving the grit of HK on 9th Avenue, needs a place that isn't too quaint or popular that you can't get a seat, too sexy that it's awkward if you're with a friend, and too loud that you can't talk. It's clean, looks more up-scale than its $1 oysters would suggest and can be the setting for a variety of meet-ups from date to catching up with a friend, mentor, or colleague.  I give it a solid 4 on atmosphere. The removal of the 1 star is because the restaurant doesn't quite have its own unique, memorable voice in atmosphere, which so many places in Manhattan do.   Service:  The Bar has 1 server and it can get rather busy. They have great bus staff that keep the place neat and tidy though and can thoughtfully aid in getting staff attention or the basic stuff (menu, water, etc).  Dining service is quite prompt and both are quite knowledgeable about their areas.  The bartender and staff know all the wines by the glass and by bottle quite well.  Both will be happy to tell you what they prefer on the menu.  It's all pretty delicious.  5 stars. Drinks:  They do have a nice selection of cocktails worthy of trying, hence adding this to the mixology list.  I, however, go when I want to share a bottle of wine outside of my home with friends in a livelier atmosphere.  This is one of the more reasonable wine by the bottle places.  The sommelier does a descent job of curating the list to have a handful of affordable (sub-$50) but tasty wine options in red and white.  They do run out, though, hence docking a star (4 stars).Food:  This menu is a hodge podge that could roughly be categorized as seafood, and I mean that in the nicest of ways.  It gets overall a 4, i.e. minus one star for having no ""story."" But this food is better than most spots that would fit the bill for your typical neighborhood meet-up. Below are some of my favorite choices.Oysters - At $1, you should get as many as you like.All of the Sushi - It's fine. Clean and non-fishy, but you wouldn't go here specifically for sushiFried Calamari - This is quite good. 5 starsTuna Tartar - Great choice for an appetizerCapellini with Seafood - I quite like this dish for its portion and it's delicious flavor.",8,2,1

We three were tired after a long flight & then rehearsals, so really enjoyed the quiet and not feeling rushed. We each had a drink before dinner. My friend loved her Chardonnay & I thought the ""Field Day"" was both delicious and a hoot, with its graham cracker rimmed glass! Also perfect for a hot summer evening. Our other friend ordered the Mistinguett, but found it a strange and unappealing combination of flavors.We all ordered appetizers instead of entrees and had plenty to eat. The lobster bisque was a rich & creamy purée redolent of lobster. I thought the Andouille sausage would overpower the PEI mussels, but not so. It added a complimentary smokiness. The roasted beets & accompaniments were delicious, with fun presentation. The fricassee of mushrooms & the arugula/watercress salad also got rave reviews. We finished the evening by splitting a warm, rich chocolate dessert and went away satisfied in every way.Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and did a great job.

The host was nice enough to escort us to the bar area where we sat and were given menus. It all went downhill when this ice queen of a waitress came over to ask us what we wanted to order. When you walk in the place gives off the vibe that it's too good for you but it's far from that! Our waitress was less than pleased to be doing her job and treated us as if we were bothering her because we wanted to spend money at the establishment that pays her... The NERVE OF US! I pretty much ignored her because I would rather deal with this Ice Queen than brave the Lincoln tunnel at 5pm. So we got some oysters, and calamari and some drinks. The food was very good and fresh!

Now for the food, I wish we could have stayed longer and tried more dishes, but the LIRR suspensions were lifted and we needed to take advantage of getting home while the rails were working. We had 3 Apps...the Fricassee Mushrooms-served over a creamy polenta with truffle oil, Crab Cake and the Beets.  All 3 were incredibly tasty that I cannot wait to go back and check out the entrees.  We sat at the bar, the staff was genuinely attentive and sweet.

Never bring cake here tho and in this case there we two cakes. $40 ""open"" food charge. That's so ridiculous - I would be okay if it was $20 but $40 is crazy. Food - I chose the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was very underwhelming - it tasted standard and not unique. I have had lobster mac and cheeses before and they were at a cheaper price point and tasted the same. The lobster portion here was also sooo small and tiny it felt like a scam paying $28 for the meal.The restaurant was playing some upbeat music which I enjoyed but it was fairly loud.

163,Veronica V.,"Houston, TX",2,48,0,2.0,7/16/2016,"This was our yearly vacation trip to NYC, now about 10+ years strong. We use this time to try new places and just enjoy the city for a few days.  We chose Thalia due to it being near our hotel, Marriott on Broadway.  Initial thoughts: lovely restaurant with somewhat unusually peppy music, like popular artists instead of a neutral background jazz or similar. It had no theme, or didn't seem to. Right away, that lessens the ambience for me.We sat at a table that was nestled near part of a booth, so we really liked that location.  When we sat and reviewed the menu, the waiter was quick to greet us and ask what we wanted to order. He was somewhat rushed, or seemed to not be really interested in any sort of warm welcome.  He recited the special items they had, and we ordered a variety of things to try. To start, we ordered a salad and the Wild Mushroom risotto, and then we also ordered tuna tartare and another salad.  When we ordered, the waiter actually said ""okay, that's enough"" and that seemed comical to me. He seemed pleased with himself in general, and not aware of the need to notice his tables.  He would actually walk around and look anywhere but at our table, and this restaurant was 90% empty.  There were about 2 other tables of people near us, and he served them also.The salad was amazing, and the tuna was good. The risotto was really poor. It was not at all properly cooked, and had not reached al dente or any similar stage. It was crunchy/hard and therefore, gross. The flavoring was good, but the texture was just not right.  Because our waiter had been missing, it took a while to get more wine, and at one point I told my spouse that we could just leave since clearly we weren't going to get wine.  We didn't leave immediately, but somewhat after.This is a bummer for us because the waiter was not only annoyingly self-aware, but not aware of his role as a server. He was in avoidance-mode and probably was tired or just not interested in doing his job. Other staffers were looking on, but did nothing to help.  It was strange, as if they were all there for a boring party of standing around, and not doing anything to actually create a restaurant vibe.  We won't be going back.",3,1,1

I looked over the dessert menu, but I did not pick anything since most of their deserts were too simple.

168,Charles C.,"Denver, CO",258,435,318,5.0,11/12/2016,"From the service to the food quality, this place is a must visit if you are checking out a show in the neighborhood. On a recent visit, we were able to get promptly seated at around 630pm with no issues about being late. The crab cake appetizer might have been the best crab cake I ever had followed by the cod special, accompanied with shrimp risotto. The cod was moist and flavorful and the risotto was cooked perfectly. For dessert, we got a tiramasu (just when I thought it couldn't get better), that was the ""icing"" on the cake. It was a generous portion and you could really taste the coffee in it. This place is worth checking out for sure! Service was also outstanding. Servers continue to come over and check on you throughout the night and clean off the table after each course.",,,

The 2 girls who meet and greet are great but the bar staff are moody.As for the ambience I think its lacking something . Anything on 8th ave is always a little strange even the shake shack there doesn't feel right.Oh no I just realised I am becoming a down town snob.Seriously though for a drink and cheap oysters this place is fine just don't order the rose .,3,2,1

174,Elizabeth F.,"Flushing, NY",10,30,6,2.0,5/13/2016,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with my experience. I came here with my co-workers after work for the $1.50 oysters happy hour which starts at 8PM. Since we came here a little early, we grabbed a table and we were excited to try the happy hour oysters. Unfortunately when the oysters arrived, we saw that it wasn't fresh and the oysters tasted grainy and hard. Needless to say, we could've gone to another oyster bar but I read an article online about this place and was very eager to give Thalia a try based on the good things the article had mentioned.Never again, I would highly recommend spending your money some place else that offers $1 oysters happy hour instead of $1.50.",3,,

177,Freda Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,16,3,4.0,11/26/2016,"Good brunch place - the atmosphere is really nice and cozy but still chic and trendy, and the food is pretty good. We had the Atlantic Eggs Benedict, and two of us had the fixed price brunch menu with organic mesclun greens salad to start and the House Omelet for our main. The omelet was good, with ham and provolone, though the egg was slightly overlooked and a bit chewy. The roasted potato side was heavily spiced but a bit dried out.We didn't get drinks but it's $20 unlimited free fills on classic brunch drinks for 90 min, which is a decent deal if you choose to take advantage of it.",,,

182,Felix S.,"Flushing, NY",223,212,1041,3.0,3/10/2015,"I think if you look down on this list of Yelp reviews, 9 out of 10 reviews mention about 1 thing- 1 DOLLAR OYSTERS. yup they are a dollar alright but unfortunately they didn't have it the night we were there. So sorry this review will not be based around dollar oysters, yes sad day but no this is not going to be a rage post ;) How do one categorize Thalia, is it Japanese? French? Italian? or is it an American restaurant? In the end, I don't think it really matter, the more options the better!Thalia restaurant is located on 8th ave between 49th street and 50th street.Parking: The restaurant is pretty close to Times Square so you know how the parking situation is- unless you want to burn $40-50 bucks parking, avoid it at all cost. Instead take the C, E Train to 50th street or 1 train to 50th street and walk a block over. Decor and Ambiance- First impression- wow this place is big, the restaurant is pretty much separated into two different sides, the bar/lounge side and the dining side. When you enter the restaurant, you'll immediately notice the big semi round bar table on your left and the romantic dimly lighted lounge on the right hand side- oh their couches are so comfortable! I only know because they originally sat us at the lounge side and then they realize we were there for dinner and moved us. The dining side was also candle light lit and filled with a lot of mirrors that illuminate the candle light further more, which gives a warm and romantic elegant feel to the place. We made a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday night, the restaurant was very nice in calling us a few hours before to let us know that there will not be any dollar oysters that night.  We still went because we didn't want to change our plans.  The place wasn't too full when we entered at around 8:00pm so we were seated right away.  They started our party off with some fresh bread and some olive spread.  I'm not a big fan of olive so I skip on that but the bread was definitely made fresh, the focaccia was nice and soft, and made perfect with a drizzle of olive oil and salt.  Our party of 10 ordered a variety of Japanese/ Italian and American food and a number of them were either hit or miss.  We enjoyed the pasta dishes best but of all the items we ordered, here are some of our favorites (starting with appetizer) :1. Spicy Salmon Tartare (forbidden rice, fried wontons, harissa vinaigrette)- I can't help but feel rebellious after eating the forbidden rice ;))) but all jokes aside, this is a great appetizer.  The salmon was fresh to start which gave the dish a creamy texture, the spicy mayo added to the salmon was just right and didn't overpower the fish.  The forbidden rice was well flavored and gave the dish a much needed texture contrast.  and of course the crunchy fried wontons and vinaigrette gave the dish more texture and tartness to balance out the salmon. YUM!!! perfect way to start your meal!2.Squid Ink Capellini (rock shrimp, cockle clams, calamari, mussels, tomato, basil-tarragon white wine sauce)- just the name of this dish should peak your interest, first of all freshly made Capellini is legit!! pasta is al dente but the squid ink is star of the show here, it wasn't fishy and added a lot of flavor and creaminess to the pasta. The rock shrimp was fresh, chewy and perfect bite size without shells, calamari was nice and tender and the mussel was juicy and well marinate by the tomato, basil-tarragon white wine sauce.  What an excellent dish, I would order this in a heartbeat! MUST TRY!!3. Angel Hair (clams, bay scallops, shrimp, calamari, mussels, spicy white wine tomato sauce)- Did someone say fresh pasta? yes the angel hair pasta was definitely fresh, I had a hard time deciding which dish was better (the Squid Ink Capellini or this).  The portion was big and they were not stingy with their seafood neither.  But my favorite part of the dish is the spicy white wine tomato sauce, OMG, this sauce gave the dish life, I mean it wasn't super spicy but it gives the seafood and pasta a little kick in your mouth which prompts you to eat another bite of this dish... SO GOOD!!! MUST TRY!!!Service: We had a great waiter and he was very accommodating even though some of our party came like 30+ minutes late. Water was refilled throughout and our waiter came to check up on us every 15 minutes or so. Price: Average- Entree ranges from $19- $31, most pasta dishes runs for around $23-$25 which I think is totally worth it but there are some dishes that I feel are overpriced. Overall: Our party had a good experience at Thalia, there are definitely some hit/ miss dishes here but when you are in doubt, go with the fresh pastas. Service was great and the price was average (again the pastas are worth it).  I think Thalia is worth a try if you are into pastas, just make sure to go on a day where they have the dollar oysters!",7,1,1

187,Bob L.,"Leonia, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,2/21/2018,"Had a pre-matinee lunch at Thalia today. Our first server was a trainee who, while very sweet, didn't have a strong command of English and wasn't able to answer our questions regarding our drink order. This was partly because of the very confusing draft beer menu; some beers are only offered as 1/2 liters or liters; while others are offered in pints. Makes no sense. Eventually, a second server took our beer order, but we waited quite awhile until a third server came to take the beer order, and finally the beers were served. Then, we waited awhile for someone to take our food order, and I finally motioned to our original waitress who took our order and several minutes later, another server came over to confirm the food order, and half of it was wrong, and we corrected it. The food was served in a timely way, but the quality was less than mediocre. The salmon burger was pasty and not memorable, but the sweet potato fries were good; the fish of the Fish and Chips was greasy, soggy, and undercooked, while the chips were three big potato wedges, not the traditional fries.  One of the servers came by to ask ""how was everything,"" we honestly told her what we felt of the food. While we were not interested in any refunds, as we ate the food because we were in a hurry to get to a matinee, we were told that the manager was ""comping"" us for the Fish and Chips. Overall, the experience was not a good one for us, and I don't plan to return to Thalia.",1,,

Our waitress ran around, completely neglecting us. We finally flagged her down long enough to order. We kept a menu for a friend, who'd be joining us later and I noticed that we were supposed to get a complimentary drink with every entree, which the waitress neglected to inform us about. I had to flag her down again to order my drink. One of my friends had already ordered a coffee and we assumed that'd be his free drink. When the bill came, we realized that wasn't the case. The waitress explained that coffee wasn't included in the comp drinks, only juices. This place is really expensive for mediocre food. I had the house omelette and it was only ok. Maybe a tad below ok. Customer service was horrible. Would not return.",,,1

Every time I end up with a bill 2x what I think I should have been charged. Once, I ordered half a dozen oysters, they brought me a dozen oysters, I informed them of their mistake before eating them, they charged me for the full dozen, I informed the server of the mistake, but they still wouldn't remove the charge even when I spoke to a manager. The next time, I ordered wine and oysters. The wine arrived rancid. I drink a lot of wine - I know when a wine is corked. I brought this to the attention of the server and asked for a fresh glass, having taken only one sip. The server brought me a new glass but refused to take the first off the bill. This place seems to only have their bottom line in mind, and I'm concerned about the safety of consuming food and beverages here. I will absolutely never return.",5,1,1
