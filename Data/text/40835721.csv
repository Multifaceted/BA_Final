0,Gina R.,"Jersey City, NJ",387,158,616,5.0,9/12/2018,"Cute coffee shop in Gramercy.Stopped in for a couple of hours to get some work done on my laptop.  They don't provide WiFi so make sure you know if your hotspot is on.  People will be chatting and meeting also, so if you need silence to work this is not your spot.  However, if you like a social environment come here!Ambiance - woodsy chic.  Cute touches like a ceramic water cooler in the back with repurposed glasses.  Method sweet water soap in the bathroom.  The little things are sustainable and I loved that about visiting here.  They also had some biodegradable straws out.Had a toasted sesame bagel with butter that really hit the spot.  Iced coffee was very smooth and licoricey.  Definitely better than normal coffee shop fare.",10,5,12
1,Naveen S.,"Manhattan, NY",357,38,14,2.0,10/28/2018,"Stumbled upon this cute little coffee shop in the heart of Gramercy. Walking down the beautiful, tree-lined block...with majestic apartment buildings towering over you....and an ominous, intriguing park that you will never be inside..... I had high expectations coming to this place, but was very disappointed. Have to agree with the other Yelp'ers with their complaints:- The space is crowded and uncomfortable, making it impossible to get any work done. No WiFi. It's loud, so not a great place for a catch-up sess' with your friend. Would suggest coming during off-peak hours.- Service is extremely slow. Lines are long and don't move.- Coffee is decent, but overpriced. More so than other shops. Forget about the food.On the plus side, it attracts a vibrant set of of patrons, many of whom are from the neighborhood. You might even overhear some juicy gossip if you try hard enough....",,,

Updated review","I'm wavering on 3 or 4 stars for this Irving Farm in particular.  The hubs and I have been coming to this location for about 2 years or so.  It seems that in these 2 years the service and cleanliness has really gone downhill!! So far downhill that they currently have a ""B"" rating.  I didn't research this rating as I fear what I'd find out.  Mind you the sign was there in the window one day then a day later it was conveniently laying face down (02/25/2018). Like someone was hiding something?? The drinks are usually pretty good, but don't ask for any substitutions!   They won't make a drink with half caffeine, something I'll never understand.  I don't like to be jittery so most places do one shot of caffeine and one shot of decaf.  They won't do that here.  WTFE.  I like the flavor of coffee so no, I don't want just one shot.  They have a decent selection of food items but the place is DIRTY.  I'd like to see some consistency on the bakery items. It can be hit and miss but that could just be me.  By the way, I like to order a large iced latte most days.  They only offer one size here.  They have larger cups for iced coffee but not the iced latte's. Stop being chThe staff looks as though they just rolled out of bed, eye boogers and all.  Just watching them make the hot food or smashed avocado made me cringe. It's just a cluster f^*% where the food prep area is.  Oh, careful if you have to use the bathroom. The mess in there is as bad as the mess on the counters where you sugar your beverage.  If anyone like an employee for example is reading this, can you please make sure the simple syrup/liquid sugar bottles are full.  The one by the door is almost always empty forcing us to battle back through the line of people to the back of the coffee shop in hopes that bottle is full.  Can you please add a bottle to the area where a latte's are passed out? I get why it's not there as you wanna move people along but it's just not user friendly at the trash area on the way out.  Just a kind suggestion as I do plan on coming back as I LOVE Irving Place. The Gramercy Park area is gorgeous and I for one would expect more from you all. You guys used to be great and I think you can be great again! Clean up the shop. Have your staff wash their hair before work and put on a smile.  Maybe uniform shirts would help out.  No more of the ""chip on your shoulder"" attitudes.  I start my day with you guys so I'd like you to set the positive vibe. Not that ""I'm so annoyed that you came in for a drink today vibe"".  I promise to update my review as soon as I see things start to turn around as this place used to be AWESOME.Like 3 weeks later and they still have a ""B"" rating!! Do the owners care? Fix it or forget it! Gross!!Back to an A! We are back....",16,9,10
3,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,483,1214,3.0,6/6/2018,"I am aware that this establishment is a roastery-- known for their coffee; however, I cannot speak/write about it.Per a friend's suggestion--because she loves Irving Place (as in the street/neighborhood)--we decided to meet here today to catch up.The neighborhood is very charming and upon entrance, Irving Farm appeared to be getting crowded. It was nearly 1 PM. Once inside, the place was spacious with lots of tables/chairs and counter seats.As I waited for my friend, I looked over the menu. They had a decent selection of items from baked goods & salads to breakfast items and sandwiches.Since it was my first visit, I decided to skip the coffee having had a cup earlier and ordered an iced hibiscus tea. Along with that, the avocado toast hit my eye. My friend ordered an iced coffee and a muffin.All orders took place at the counter as there was no table service. In addition, I don't know if there was a kitchen--it seemed food orders were being prepared behind the counter.The avocado toast was pretty good. I was expecting for the mashed avo version--my preference-but this particular version sliced the avocado on top of a toasted grain bread (couldn't tell if it was one large slice or two smaller ones) of which whole grain mustard was drizzled as the finish. The hibiscus tea was refreshing for a non coffee beverage.One tip---the space was extremely loud. It was often difficult for my friend and I to speak over the blasting hip hop music and the conversations from other tables. I found this to be a bit annoying; not sure if it's quiet at other times. And as it got later, it also became more crowded and louder.The restroom, although clean, was a bit unkempt.Overall, it was decent/average. Feeling neutral.",31,10,22
4,K E.,"New York, NY",0,281,1,2.0,11/7/2018,"This place is so dumb and everything that's wrong with current hospitality trends.Seating is SO uncomfortable. It's like they're really trying intentionally to make you miserable so that you leave, allowing them to cram more people in there.No WiFi- again, GET OUT!They won't let you put milk, cream etc in your coffee. You have to ask them to do it, which they made a note to tell me ""may change the price of your drink"" so they made me decide if I wanted cream before ringing me up. Excuse me but wtf?! Super expensive. Stupid expensive. Senselessly expensive. Staff is rude AF. That's their thing though.So not into this place. Will be holding my meetings elsewhere.",,,

Updated review","The staff here is remarkably friendly.  The wait time is inordinately long. 20 minutes for a sandwich the last 4 times i went in- the last time i went in, they skipped my order. problem is: they make every order one at a time. no one has trained them to batch orders. they'll make one pressed croissant at a time.  then make a salad. then make another pressed croissant. then toast a bagel. it's really inefficient. Not a good place to study or do work as it's very loud here at most times of the day.  It sounds like a bar most of the time. customers are loud, music is blaring. The men that go here are also notably attractive most times I've been in which is a nice plus, but sadly- i can't justify 13 dollars for a sandwich after waiting 15-20 minutes for it.",1,,
6,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1113,19753,2.0,3/19/2018,"I can't believe I have been to this location but didn't review it. I saw Ellen's recent review and remembered going there with her and Cesar the first time I met them. I even took photos of the two places I parked my butt. I used the bathroom and hated it. It was cramped and very dark in there. The long narrow establishment was full of people and the line for service very long. Once people line up there's no room to navigate through the space. Seating limited. I made my way outside while Ellen and Cesar purchased their coffee. I grabbed a table in front of the business. At least I didn't feel claustrophobic! I've been to at least two other Irving Farms locations and enjoyed both of those. I'm especially partial to the location on the Upper East Side. As for this location, I'm not a fan. I do have the pleasant memory of my first meeting with my favorite Yelp friends!  I love them like they are my children! If you live close to this location I advise going early. It may be a nice neighborhood coffee spot before the crowds arrive. As for me I'll avoid it if I can!",80,43,62
7,Pamela J.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",88,823,744,3.0,7/17/2018,"Sorry but I simply have never ever resonated with this place since it opened.  I don't even get why Whole Foods stocks their beans.  An iced latte with oat milk was like $6.50 last week, which is fine if the atmosphere rocks.  There were zero baked goods that appealed to me.  It's ok though as there is a resonating frequency for everyone and this place just happens to not be mine.",2,1,1
8,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",907,317,518,4.0,2/16/2018,"Small, cozy space great for a hangout or getting some work done that doesn't require Internet. It gets packed, so it might be kinda hard to find a spot / have a convo, but it is GREAT for people watching. Coffee is solid, even the drip. Iced latte is a perfect balance of fresh coffee toned down with a touch of milk. Prices are decent for the area.",3,2,2
9,Jennifer J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,11/10/2018,"I come here every weekend and have for years. The place is filled with regulars for a reason. The food is good and the staff is really nice, and even as it changes over, they recognize their regulars. It's just nice to have a place that feels like home in your neighborhood. It definitely gets crowded and sometimes when it is busy, you will wait quite a while for your order. So you need to have reasonable expectations of what this place is. It's a little cafe where you should go if you are not in a rush and you want something cozy and food and great coffee that is made just for you. It is definitely not a place you can go to if you want to stay for hours, because it gets too crowded. You also cannot guarantee that you will be able to duck in and out quickly, unless you are getting just a regular coffee and something from the glass case. That's what causes the low-rated reviews--people who thought it was something it is not.",1,,
10,Marjorie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",192,217,63,4.0,6/3/2018,"This is my go to place when I am in this area.  I got a dirty chai with soy which was very good with a little spice to it.  It was not piping hot, but warm/ hot which I was pleased about.  This place has a laid back vibe.  I came in around 2 pm on the weekend-so there was plenty of seating.  In the past it has been very packed, however every time I have been able to find seating.",1,1,1

14,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,4.0,10/20/2017,"That lavender latte is worth every penny. My friend made the observation that it's hard to succeed with lavender, because you could go slightly overboard and ruin the whole thing. Well, they make it perfectly here. Slightly sweet, super smooth, ideally foamy. Croissant is your standard croissant, and the cashier gave my friend a full glass of wine. I think he was either super generous or really liked her! Ambiance is super cute and cozy too, with outdoor and indoor seating and dim lighting. Great for dates, reading, or hanging with friends.",2,1,2

16,Elizabeth M.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,204,28,2.0,10/14/2017,"Most expensive iced latte in the five boroughs and they don't even carry almond milk. The barista gave me a hard time about the fact that I requested they make my latte with less milk than normal. ""That's 'an espresso with milk, not a latte,'"" he informed me, almost refusing to make it, as though I might need to go back to the cash register to order and pay for something different. Um, really? I just paid over $6 for it. Can you just not fill it up all the way? The interior is somewhat dirty and uninviting.",2,3,1
17,Akash M.,"New York, NY",108,51,79,1.0,3/13/2018,"I've been here a few times as it's one of the closest coffee shops to my office. I come here for the convenience, not necessarily for the quality of the coffee or the customer service. My most recent visit was my last, solely based on the fact that I was treated like trash. I presented the cashier (man who always has a light scruff and wears a backwards baseball cap) with two of my punch cards. He gave me a free drink (got my order wrong though) but didn't even look at the punch cards that I handed him. Had he looked at my punch cards he would have realized that the punches were split between two cards and some needed to be transferred over to a new one. Once I told him that, boy oh boy, I think I must have opened the gates of hell. He started to roll his eyes, his facial expression immediately reflected anger, and he started aggressively looking for new punch cards with fury in his eyes. He was clearly upset. I was beyond shocked that he was acting this way. He finally found an old beat up card and gave it to me. He took another customer before I could thank him, so as I was walking away he yells ""you're welcome!"" across the coffee shop. Then he turns to the other workers and whispers who knows what and then they all looked at me and started to whisper. Pretty sure he didn't have anything nice to say. If you're in customer service, the #1 rule is to be nice, which obviously the cashiers and baristas here are not. No customer should ever be treated this way. The customer service has always been subpar at best, but today it was at an all-time low. Only come here if you want your overpriced coffee served with a side of attitude and unprofessionalism.",5,,
18,E P.,"New York, NY",17,546,1836,1.0,4/5/2018,"Never going back here. The place is way too cramped. The food is overpriced. But even worse is the service. Everybody looks miserable, and nobody smiles. I felt bad for the one guy making all the food until I smiled at him and he gave me the coldest seconds-long stare I've ever gotten anywhere. (Maybe that's why he left my toasted bagel on the counter so long it lost most of its crisp and heat.) A request for a to go cup after waiting so long for my food was met with a stare. The guy at the cashier offered the young woman behind me, but not me, an older guy, a punch card. It would have been nice to be offered one, but then again I'm never coming back so it doesn't matter.",2,1,
19,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,4.0,9/21/2017,"Irving Farm is truly my favorite coffee. It is the best coffee I've ever had. It is bold without being bitter. It's so good I could drink it black, and I never drink coffee without a ton of whole milk.I am about to sound like such a snob but the coffee has such excellent notes of nuts and chocolate. It's seriously great coffee people. Trust.It is super expensive and this location is usually pretty busy.

20,Ryan B.,"Manhattan, NY",740,10,2,3.0,4/27/2018,Great coffee. However they told me they don't do iced coffee and then insisted they only do iced cold brew and the cold brew is more expensive.

22,Ben B.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,2.0,9/2/2018,"Irving Farm has become the most expensive coffee chain in Manhattan. Sadly, the increase in prices is uncorrelated to the level of quality of the product and certainly the level of service at the shop. I walked into the Irving Place shop today. The three staff behind the counter were deep in conversation and I felt I was intruding upon their social time together. My drink took about 10 minutes to make. I asked for an additional cup with some ice and was given attitude. There are other premium coffee houses popping up around the City that are more customer-focused, flexible, friendly and frankly less expensive.

Wrong number, not a big deal.....If the receptionist had the patience to let me finish my sentence rather than hanging up on me, I would have told him in person that their number has been listed incorrectly by ""Dear Irving"". So rather than mannerlessly tell me to google ""Dear Irving""'s number, remember next time that a little patience goes a long way.​When your phone is ringing up nonstop by people looking for information about another restaurant, the most efficient​ thing to do is not to turn them one by one away (how many potential customers you could've possibly made), but to contact ""Dear Irving"" and tell them that they have incorrectly listed your number as theirs!

For weeks they told me it was due to a broken carafe. Now they stopped making that excuse. They keep offering me Americanos. Americanos are silly. I don't know why anyone would ever order one. I end up getting very pricey decaf lattes. No more iced coffee either (regular or decaf). Only cold brew -- more expensive of course. It's a battle to get punch cards. They are always out of stock. Staff has turned over completely and gives a lot of attitude -- especially regarding questions about decaf. They used to have the best muffins which I would bring to my building staff. Everyone loved the Farm muffin. Now they have super-expensive but not great muffins. I'm not a fan of Sunburst but sometimes these days I just go there to avoid 71 (which I guess is not even called 71 anymore ). I heard Bedford Cheese has great coffee so I'll have to try that.

45,Judy I.,"Queens, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/4/2018,"I'm a coffee critic and was in town to review this company. I was impressed when I saw the roasted coffee beans with a recent date of less than 7 days from date of purchase. However, as other reviewers described, the service was unprofessional. When asked for the price of the beans, was informed anywhere from $15-20. Strike 1. When another customer entered to buy a bag and requested it grounded, the cashier did not know now to use it and needed to ask the barista. Strike 2.When I paid and was not even provided with a bag to go on a rainy nyc day, that makes this Strike 3.Unfortunately, my bag of beans is still lying next to my espresso machine unopened. Even if the taste is good, the poor service will empower its taste.",,,

I was told that it was against policy and that it was impossible to make me a latte with one shot!? I asked if they could pour out half of the espresso before they put the milk in and again was told that they couldn't do that and that ""Michaela would never allow it.""I have never in my life been given a hard time about asking for LESS caffeine while paying the same amount. And to be told there was no way they could pour out one shot - even give it to me on the side - is infuriating. I walked out and will NEVER EVER go back there.

You know that feeling when someone takes your order and you immediately feel a deep, meaningful connection to them? Me neither. But I do feel like Will, the guy who took my order and explicitly promised (with his eyes) to use extra love and care when constructing my sandwich, seems like a stellar employee and at the very least a mediocre human being.

52,Sarah A.,"New York, NY",523,8,0,2.0,9/30/2017,"Huge disappointment in this place. First off, the main reason I came is because the menu online said they had gluten free bread available as a substitute for the sandwiches. When I arrived, not only did they not have gluten free bread, but the cashier was extremely cold and unfriendly. He answered all my questions rudely and condescendingly. When I asked to try the oat milk, as I'd never had it before, he acted extremely put-out. I expressed that since I was paying for their product, I wanted to try it first. He made a rude comment about me not specifically paying for the sip of oat milk to taste it. Just an overall negative experience. And I am disappointed, because I wanted this place to become a new staple of mine. There's a good chance I won't be back.",2,,

They have a huge selection of pastries from top bakeries like Ovenly and Balthazar. It's probably the largest selection I've seen at a coffee shop. They do a great job trying to entice you with them while waiting in line! When I work from home, their chicken avocado sandwich is one of my favorites for a quick lunch. One major thing you should know is that this is not the best coffee shop to sit and study or get some work done (even though many still do). I'm not sure what's up with the acoustics here but it gets incredibly loud - almost to the level of a bar when the place is full.

It must have been something about today -- it was jammed packed with lots of people ordering food for lunch or just coming in to order something while avoiding the sudden downpour outside. First sign of trouble was there were a couple of dishes made and they sat unclaimed for many minutes. Then, the eggs ran out for a long period. After that, some of the following orders were made out of order or the orders were messed up. Arnold Palmer I ordered was delish so points for that. I felt that my Egg Plate was unnecessarily expensive -- a plate of eggs, greens, and avocado for $10+.

I've been going for years, and figured I was way past due on a post for these guys. They roast everything here in NY at a farm in Hudson Valley, keeping the focus on sustainability and building direct relationships with the coffee farmers. In their cafe, they also offer an array of baked goods and pastries, including a Rice Crispy Treat about the size of your face. I usually order an Americano. The coffee is robust yet smooth, and vibe in the cafe is nothing shy of quaint. There are a number of little tables in the subterranean cafe, and you'll usually find them all full.",4,1,2

Updated review","Having moved to Portland, I'm surrounded by top-tier coffee options and artisan-roasters, yet remain nostalgically attached to Irving. Its coffee and food options as well as the downright convenience and comfort offered, is sorely missed now. I love the House Blend and can order it online, thank god. It became a familiar and comfort-filled taste to me, purchased pretty much daily. What I can't order is that NYC coffeehouse ambience, folks working, debating, ruminating. The pastry options assault the senses, urging a physical response. Over two dozen types of breads, cakes, and baked specialties from the best vendors in the city. I never liked the prices at Irving, but I don't think much of that now.  Patronize Irving while you can!",,,

It has the most delicious sauce and the croissant is enhanced by their cooking on the panini press! You really can't go wrong with any of the sweet options either!Once you go, you'll be hooked!!!Tips:Great for meet-ups and quick meals.

Updated review","I came here again on my most recent visit to NY and the coffee is still just as great. This time around, I gave their cappuccino a shot. I loved it! Nice and strong. Like other reviewers though, I do have to agree that the barristas are not too welcoming. Best coffee in town? Yes, but La Colombe isn't too far behind. Best customer experience? I would have to say a Colombe wins this category.",,,
114,Ali B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,9,3.0,1/8/2017,"I used to come to this place every day for an almond latte. They were expensive but exceptional, so it was worth it. Then one day they stopped serving almond milk. I think the cost of almond milk went up or something.. anyway they replaced it with a different nutmilk (I want to say pumpkin seed but can't be sure), and I tried it once but it was vile. I stopped going there from that day forward. It seems to me that when you charge $6 for an almond latte, you should be able to swallow the extra 50cents per carton price increase. They've lost a daily customer in me and a few of my colleagues stopped going there as well for the same reason. I popped in recently to check if they had brought almond milk back, but still no. Such a shame. This place made the best almond lattes I've ever had.",,,

The flavor was a bit too lightly roasted, I guess in an effort to keep more bean flavor.  But they haven't hit the chocolate sweet point like Black Cat does.  Instead they have meandered in a more winey, high toned direction.  And it ended up failing on the caffeine joltimeter.  The place itself is dark wood and a bit lugubrious, which might have been a nice idea when it first opened. Now it seems dingy, old and a bit dirty.  Does not live up to the hype. The equation is : Hipster attitude leads to over confidence.  This leads to lack of self criticism.  This leads to lower quality.",1,,

122,Daniel F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,0,1.0,2/7/2016,"Was rather surprised that I have had such consistently bad experiences here.  I have been coming here on and off for a while as I want to like it given its proximity to my apartment. As of today I have given up.In general the coffee beans they use are ok. Yes, better than Starbucks, but not by a whole lot, so that knocks them down in my book. In terms of baristas, the cashiers are often very rude and curt. Not looking for them to care about my life, but I also don't want to feel as though I am on a death race to the finish and certainly don't want to pay good money for horrific attitudes. The drinks are often made sloppily with little attention to detail. Plus their iced coffee is really acidic/harsh and sometimes has a grainy taste to it (I would really avoid the iced coffee). On top of all of that they are really quite expensive! Happy to pay a premium for premium service and coffee, this, however, is neither in my opinion. That said, their sandwiches are good, especially the lox and farmhouse ones, but the place is often climate challenged in terms of temperature and has a very strong garlic oder all the time. SO, if all you want is a sandwich, stop by and grab it to go! All in all there are many better options just a block in either direction that consistently make excellent coffee, save yourself the time and skip this one. p.s. I will give credit to their baked good selection, very extensive, and a large portion of it is sourced from very tasty bakeries around the city. Only had a few bad ones, but if you stay away from anything that sounds healthy, you'll be good to go.",4,,

Updated review","Still a dependable standby, though it's gotten way too popular for its own good. Seating is a rare commodity. Get here early. Or something. Computer use is still not permitted during busy hours, but they didn't yell at me for using my BlackBerry.Wicked fast coffee preparation, but then again, I drink the stuff black.Their bagel lox and cream cheese ($7.25) is tasty and comes with a liberal amount of salmon, and it's always easy to make friends with cinnamon raisin bagels.",11,8,11
125,Sara S.,"New York, NY",137,127,484,3.0,3/7/2013,"Someone recommended 71 Irving as a great work/study spot so I decided to give it a try. My very first impression: it's too dark inside! I immediately  snagged the last table that had a lamp. The tables are tiny so I was lucky to grab one for four in front of the staircase (leads to a closed door). I felt less guilty about hogging up the table when a stranger later joined me to read a book. Though the table lamp was small, it emitted just enough light for me to read/write. [The dim lighting shouldn't affect those working on laptops (saw a few despite the lack of wifi)]. There are two available outlets by the staircase so the two seats adjacent to the stairs have easy access to outlets. I noticed more by the table in front of mine (along the wall). The cafe is louder than I prefer. As someone mentioned below, it gets so loud that one can't hear the music playing. There is one bathroom (better than none).I had a small soy latte and a gluten free cranberry/white chocolate cookie. I paid $4.25 + $1 tip (which I regret in hindsight bc counter girl was blah) for a SMALL soy latte. I usually pay that much for a large size at other coffee shops in the city. The cookie cost me just as much at $3.50! I'm the crazy one for paying that much for a damn cookie. I understand that it's gluten free and blah blah, but come on. If the cookie tasted really really good, I wouldn't whine so much about it but only the first two bites were good (right before I got a chunk with the white chocolate) - The dried cranberries were fine but the choc was super sweet. The latte was good but I've had better for cheaper. I don't think I'd be back for the following reasons:- I can get better soy lattes for a cheaper price elsewhere- not an ideal study spot for me (too loud and dark)- I think there was a homeless lady hanging out here for a few hours- The cashier was sour",5,1,

The atmosphere is cozy and quaint and the staff don't pressure you to leave. It's great when I just want an hour or so to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee. I used to have only positive things to say about 71 Irving but the last time I went a couple of weeks ago, the coffee was lukewarm. When I told them that I wanted my coffee hot, just hot enough to slowly enjoy and sip, he came back with yet another lukewarm cup of coffee. For that, I'm disappointed and the coffee didn't have much flavor and tasted diluted. I still might come just for the location though. But maybe I'll stick to cappuccinos and chai lattes.

Set my work laptop on a wobbly tiny table, I quickly realized this isn't the place for me. No wi-fi, and during the workday evening I spent there, the volume got unbeatably loud.

The latte has such a creamy and rich coffee flavor. I also got mushroom quiche the past two times, partly because it was the cheapest thing on the menu, but also pretty tasty. The salad and the sandwiches were pretty expensive and did not look appetizing enough to order. In addition they have a nice array of pastries, and I tried the greentea and Lemon cookie.

All over the city, there is no other coffee spot that oozes comfort and ambiance as this quaint little place near by Union Square. Instead of crowding into the likes of Starbucks and Pret a Manger for a cup of coffee/tea and croissant, I rather come here and wait for a seat here. Once you sit down, you might be there for hours (maybe to the chagrin of others waiting for a table). The sandwiches and pastries are delicious even if they are a bit on the pricey side. The coffee is flavorful, and it does an adequate job of satisfying most cravings. That being said, the allure of 71 Irving is not the food or coffee. It is about the luxury of being able to sit in the cozy confines of a place that allows one to relax after a stressful day of work without being disturbed.

As noted by some others, apparently the baked goods come from Balthazar Bakery and subsequently the cookie was out of this world tasty. I would recommend any baked goods or breads sold out of Irving; the smokey panino was particularly delicious because of how great the bread was. The hot chocolate was nothing special, I'd certainly skip it and stick with a cup of coffee, it did come lukewarm which didn't help it's cause.

161,Thomas G.,"New York, NY",22,58,1,2.0,8/7/2013,"I like this place but it had a grade ""c"" for sanitary conditions and to be honest, I didn't even think they went that low.Worse still is that they have tried to hard to hide it by putting it low down and with a plant covering it.Buck up your ideas.Giving it 2 stars because I do like the vibe here and it's not like I have gotten sick.",2,,
162,Alyssa S.,"San Francisco, CA",112,11,12,5.0,8/9/2013,"There are a few places in the city that feel like home- little havens from the chaos... 71 Irving has been one of those places for me since I started NYU. Quiet, cozy, quick-service, amazing coffee, Irving Street itself is gorgeous, steps from Gramercy park, and there is indoor and outdoor seating.Also... 1) Their iced black coffee is THE BEST- like crack. Which is what I need, lol.2) They carry Balthazar pastries and baked goods. The chocolate cream cheese Farmhouse Muffin is dangerously good.3) I'm a big fan of their California Bagel- $5 for a bagel toasted with cream cheese, tomato + onion.I love 71 Irving... a lot.",2,,
163,Megan M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,4.0,12/18/2015,I come to 71 Irving more than I should admit for the $5 blueberry flax muffins (allegedly only 80 calories and a seriously good way to kick off the morning with a schmear of almond butter). The prices are high but the coffee is great and I'm always pleased the service and food.Five starts if they reduce the price of the muffins to $3.50,,,

Updated review","Ok...I'm a big fan of this place.  Haven't been in awhile, so I brought an out-of-town buddy to this spot because I wanted him to see a really cute/neat coffee shop, since we always go to cafe's together.  This review is not on the coffee or the pastries. It's on the people that work there.I'm sorry, but honestly, the service here is horrid.  All I did was order a coffee and I was met with so much attitude.  The guy was rough with throwing around my cup, didn't look at me, looked annoyed that we were ordering anything at all.  The cafe wasn't busy at all. I almost felt like we were ruining their conversation or something.  My friend ordered a scone and the girl behind the counter just flopped it on a plate.  I was honestly thinking, ""do these people even want to work here?"" They were the only thing wrong with my experience here yesterday. After reading reviews, this seems to be a common complaint. Please, baristas, treat your customers with respect and try to smile. We're the reason you get paid, remember that. I can definitely spend my $4 down the street.",6,,

167,Amanda A.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,103,30,4.0,5/10/2013,"Great study spot during finals. I always seem to end up in a study group here. Stopped by this spot yesterday for and had a mason jar of fresh lemonade (the best) and an avocado chicken sandwich with farm sauce. That sandwich isn't your average avocado and chicken from Pret ( no shade thrown to Pret). It was fresh, hearty, moist, multigrain bread was toasted just right, and the farm sauce...not sure which farm they visited to get the sauce from, but it was good and I'd like to visit that farm. I've had another sandwich from there but don't see it on the menu to list it here. It was a chicken sandwich with roasted red peppers on ciabatta bread. It tasted great as well. Service is speedy, the price is reasonable for the sandwiches. I wish they were served with  a side salad but they're not and I'll live. The space in the cafe can get cramped at times. Overall, good experience. If you're around this area stop in.",2,2,1
168,Christi T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,57,10,2.0,11/5/2013,"Most of the people who work here must hate people in general because they are so rude and unfriendly.  It seems like they must hate living...or at least hate their job.  Every once in awhile there will be someone who is professional, but for the most part the employees are bored hipsters who act like you're asking them to do you a huge favor instead of doing their jobs.With that said, the only reason I go back and purchase the overpriced coffee is because it actually is pretty strong and pretty good.  Plus, it is right around the corner from me.  Lose the attitude and I'd change my rating to 5 stars.",1,,
169,Robin S.,"Delray Beach, FL",1,28,1,4.0,10/11/2015,"I love this coffee. It's full flavored and not bitter.

171,Jon B.,"Manhattan, NY",184,57,2,2.0,5/13/2015,"I have been to this location as well as the one on the upper west side and after multiple visits I just can't find anything that is that great about this place other than the atmosphere. The coffee is mediocre and for a higher end coffee shop, their iced coffee is not cold brew but hot coffee cooled so it has a slightly bitter taste. You might as well go to Starbucks. As for food, for what they offer the prices are a little steep ($10 for granola with yogurt? An egg salad sandwich for $10 as well?).Yes it is a nice place to fire up a laptop or meet friends but that's it. If you want good coffee along with a muffin or scone, check out Pushcart on 21st only a few blocks away. Worth the walk.",1,,
172,Paco L.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,26,1,1.0,1/24/2015,Awful awful awful.  Slowest line ever and the incredibly rude and slow man running the one register hurls insults at the guests.  Do not go here.  Terribly managed and no customer service whatsoever.,4,,

Fantastic vanilla flavor! This is my new favorite place for a vanilla latte. Apparently, their vanilla is homemade, WIN! No wonder. This place is quite dark, make sure to grab a spot by the window if you plan on reading. They also play loud music, not that elevator BS either. On top of that, the crowd is pretty noisy so if you like silence, don't bother.Small tables, some outlets, and two outdoor tables. Minimum $5 for CC.I shall be back!",1,,

And that's probably why a lot of reviewers sense a baditude from employees. I know that's no excuse, although authentic, worship level coffee and espresso usually comes with poopy attituded hipster baristas. I'm still coming here for cortados. And if you want to visit a super friendly worship level cafe, go to birch coffee at the Gershwin, not toooooo far. I believe they also serve Irving Farm",,,

182,Heidi B.,"Manhattan, NY",199,143,37,3.0,12/30/2013,"I like the idea of this place - casual, cozy, good place to hang out.  However, it is way too crowded for 2pm on a Monday afternoon.  I'll take partial blame for getting the table right by the coffee bar.  The barista was basically yelling into our ears every time he called a drink.  Quite embarrassing when you were just about to make a point in your conversation.  Not a place to discuss important topics because words other people say kept getting lost in the surrounding noise.As for pastry, I tried the chocolate croissant and it wasn't anything spectacular.  Coffee was good but again many coffee houses in the city rival.  Nothing to keep me go back unless in the off chance I find myself in Gramercy again.",,,
183,Katherine D.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,41,1,3.0,2/26/2014,"This is a cute cafe surprisingly close to Madison Sqr Park. It's quiet with a friendly, homey atmosphere. Very relaxing.They have a decent selection of food items, but you go to a cafe for the coffee, right? The coffee was good. Not knock your socks off, but good.The cafe has plenty of seeing, perhaps a bit too much. I can see it getting crowded easily - I was there pretty close to closing, though, so I had no troubles. It's a good place to grab a bite and chat with a friend while out in the city, but far enough away from the Madison Sqr Park rush that it's relaxing.",,,

194,Steve G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,33,0,1.0,7/28/2016,2nd time they took forever for a food order.  The first time it took half an hour for a salad but we had time to wait.  Plan for ALOT of time if you're ordering food.  There is no organization.  They don't do refunds either.  Crappy service for a place that charged $4-$5 for coffee drinks.  Last time I'm ever going there.  Coming back to the office after being gone for 40 minutes because I was standing at the counter waiting for stuff to come was awkward.,,,
195,Joanna H.,"New York, NY",195,225,268,3.0,9/19/2013,"This is such a cute cafe to enjoy with friends, coworkers or even by yourself. It was my first time here and the sandwiches are so fresh and clean. If I had to describe the good in one phrase, it'd be fresh food. I don't think there's anything so unique on the menu but if you're in the mood for a quick coffee/pastry/bagel sandwich/salad/panini grab that's not smothered in dressing or drenched in oil, Irving is a good spot! I studied a little when I was here too. Many others were working in the cafe. It's a good spot to get some work done. The only down side is the inside is on the darker side, so if you need bright light, don't try to study here. They have outdoor seating too which is very cute too.",,,
196,Paul W.,"Manhattan, NY",44,156,1150,3.0,2/12/2011,"It seems to me like there aren't many coffeehouses like 71 Irving Place around any more. You know, that slightly dark, dishevelled kind of place where people go to have coffee and maybe even talk with a friend.I like it. It reminds me of the good old days when man's best friend was, well, a friend (or a dog), and not an electronic device racing towards its +/- 1-year expiry date. I like that it's not all sleek in that generican-minimalist kind of way, and I like even better that it's not forced-quirky with the floppy couch and resident Phoebe lurking behind the ficus. It's just kind of comfortable and unassuming.The coffee is pretty good and makes a visit worthwhile. Shitty desserts, though. One time I had the Oreo brownie which was 2% Oreo and 98% sugar, and 100% shitty. I know, right? Save yourself the $3.95 and just stick with coffee and conversation.My only problem is that I keep forgetting to jettison all notes smaller than a $50 from my wallet before walking through the area, especially if I'm approaching from the north or east. I'm pretty sure the locals don't appreciate me polluting the area with the stank of ones and fives and the hideous jangle of loose change.",,2,2
197,Ashley B.,"Brooklyn, NY",126,200,7,4.0,5/26/2013,"This place is really cute and homey. It feels very New York--small, intimate, personal. I can't speak for the baked goods but the latte was good. I had no issue with service; the girls who helped me were friendly and quick. It's small which makes the place feel intimate and makes it a nice place to meet someone for a date. But it can get a bit cramped, so you tend to feel like people are hovering when it's busy. It's a good place to relax with a friend over coffee, but not during peak times.",,,1
