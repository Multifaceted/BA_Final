The service wasn't great but food came out quickly and was decently priced for what we got. I enjoyed the atmosphere, it felt like a real neighborhood establishment that catered to a wide audience. It was definitely not trendy (a plus as far as I'm concerned!).",

They give big portions & the price is reasonable on some items.  The food was good as always but they forgot to give me the mustard sauce that i like. I also ordered 2 sprites & in one of the cups there was a baby roach..... When i went back to return my sodas the girl said ""It must have been in the ice"". Yeah probably because they get their ice from a metal bucket on the counter. Anyways she proceeded to give me a new soda but took ice from the same bucket!  I didnt want to be like naw get me fresh ice so with the money they refunded me i got some can soda from a stand near by. Ill still be ordering from here in the future but will probably skip on drinks next time.",1

4,,5/27/2018,47,,"Queens, NY",Sal L.,556,4.0,286,"I enjoyed eating here. The service was very friendly, the food was very good and the restaurant itself is a throwback to 100 years ago. I was amazed at all the original woodwork and the additions & enhancements made throughout the years. Even the men's room still has the large, full length urinals which could double as a sarcophagus for a small person.My fish & chips was one of the best I've ever had. The cod was buttery soft and flakey while the fried batter remained crispy; delicious! The chips were thin cut fries, nothing special. My daughter had the Croque Monsieur sandwich with a side of fries. Even though the sandwich was very good, made with fresh ham and cheese, it didn't seem like an authentic Croque Monsieur since it seemed to lack a healthy dose of bechamel sauce. It seemed more like a toasted ham & cheese sandwich. Worth trying other items.",

Pesto, added cheddar, and they used what tasted like Boca burger (a soy based brand). Boca burger isn't my fave, but they made it taste delicious with the pesto add and toasted onion roll it was served on. Not only did we get surprisingly great bar food, the drinks were also so reasonably priced, especially for Soho where happy hour is non-existent. The bartenders were also very pleasant and efficient. We didn't have to wait long for anything and while the bar was pretty crowded, they were each super attentive. If in the area, I'll definitely stop back in!",4
9,,5/2/2018,3,,"Maastricht, The Netherlands",Shira N.,1,5.0,2,This is probably one of the best sit down places I've been to. There's a lot of space and the staff is super friendly they help and make sure you're needs are taken care of. You get water provided and the menu has a large amount of options in drinks food and desserts. I recommend getting the burger and fries. The spinach salad is also really good. I had enough space and personally I had a great time. Over all advise both kids and adults(Minor detail there is no WiFi),

12,,12/5/2017,250,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ken P.,189,4.0,251,"I've only ever been to Fanelli's twice with the second time only happening very recently.  Since the visit was for a pregaming of another event in a nearby space, my needs were simple - A couple of beers and something to eat.  That said, I found a space at the bar with my buddy and ordered up a Stella which would be my beer for the evening and an order of chicken tenders.  They kindly gave me hot sauce on the side since the item is not prepared with them as an offering.  My friend had a craft beer of some kind but I cannot remember it and opted for one of their personal pizzas.  This is not a small item at all so two people can share it unless you are ravenous.  I got to try a couple of slices in addition to my chicken and I was good to go for the night.  It was a very cold night but November was coming to an end at the time and it was about time the season was being reflected in the temperature.  It was nice to find the bar cozy and warm.  The people around me were a mix of tourists and nearby residents so some simple chatter was happening among us which was a good part of the night.  I like meeting new people and talking about the world and city we walk.  I didn't find the bartender chatty as some other places but there was a crowd and he isn't there to keep me occupied as much as make sure the place is kept open.  Overall the vibe was cool and it was a good spot to hit before the event and I'd come back for sure.  Actually after the opening I attended we went back for more drinks and we joined by new friends made at the event which was even cooler.  A good time.",
13,1,9/24/2017,408,1,"Safety Harbor, FL",Dave W.,3076,2.0,1225,"Open since 1927, we popped in for a refreshment after a bit of shopping. It's always fun to enjoy history with some drinks! A local regular at the bar told us Michael Fanelli originally opened the place and ran it through prohibition, selling illegal liquor, and beyond. Michael apparently lived until his 90's, and sold the business in the 1980's. The buyers promised not to change anything and I think it's clear they kept their promise!Our drinks were strong and well made with excellent service. However, our food wasn't as wonderful. They had no shepherds pie available and our second choice, burgers, were overcooked and didn't come with the correct toppings (missing bacon, wrong cheese, etc). So, while we enjoyed our drinks and the bit of history, I can't honestly recommend this spot.",2
14,,10/22/2018,0,,"Greenwich, CT",Michael M.,0,5.0,54,Fanelli's offers great food and craft beers at reasonable prices.  The service is wonderful as is the atmosphere.,
15,1,10/9/2017,101,,"Brooklyn, NY",Meri K.,338,2.0,143,"Stopped in finally after passing by a million times. I really liked the atmosphere, and the ""yester year"" feeling of this small neighborhood haunt, serving breakfast lunch & dinner 365 days a year. I desperately needed to use a ladies room, and jump on a biz call, and food establishments are few and far between amongst the high end retail boutiques in the heart of SoHo. Menu was traditionally diner-esque, with a tavern-ey feel to it. I ordered the burger, and did not like it. It was overly charred on the outside, and I despise that ""black"" flavor! The fries were good, however, and those and a Diet Coke pretty much held me over. I should've ordered he club, as it appears to have good yelp comments! All in all, I wasn't looking to be impressed, and was not. Maybe a better spot for late night grease after going out.",
16,,10/17/2018,0,,"Parsippany, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",Juan R.,0,1.0,1,"I went there to spend some time with family. The host was nice. Customer attention average. Ordered a burger which had a nice grill taste and cooked to order, but overall was below average/average for $17.50. Our family split the bill, some cash, and the rest on my card. No tip was added since it was already included as ""Service Charge"". Fast forward a couple of days and I noticed the whole bill was added to my card, when I know how much I signed for that day. Either they stole the cash, or simply made a mistake. Called them over 4 times to speak with a manager and even left a message on their web page. The managers are never there, and they haven't made an attempt to fix this problem. Go there at your own risk, they confuse cash and card payments....",
17,,3/17/2018,73,,"Plainview, NY",Elizabeth D.,119,3.0,198,"This is a nice little bar. Old and rustic the way a pub should be. It's very small so people were squeezed in but still having a great time. Friendly service, which is always pleasant. They have a small section of tables were you can order food, we did not eat here, only had drinks, which were good.",
18,,1/16/2018,422,6,"New York, NY",Tiffanie Q.,9,3.0,63,"I came here with two friends while we were in the area for dinner. The menu is your standard café menu and everything is reasonably priced. Would have been 4 stars but I knocked it down one because literally the most unexpected thing happened at the dinner:My friend bit into his burger, and I swear a pint of hamburger juice squirted out from the side of his burger all over my face, hair, clothes and his arm and phone. I was actually drenched in hamburger juice and had to sit through the entire dinner smelling like a cheeseburger :( I think it also somewhat burned my friend's arm and he had to throw away his phone case because it was ruined. To be honest, my burger was pretty good but a little dry. I guess I could have dipped it in my hair as a dipping sauce. The waitress was really nice and brought us over some napkins and seltzer water and comped a appetizer we had ordered. Still, I honestly don't know if I will come back.",
19,,7/22/2017,3,,"Evans, GA",Tim K.,102,5.0,98,"First thought: Dive. Second thought: great food and atmosphere. Bottom line up front: I would go back again. The service was good, my club sandwich was good and the fact they have Paulaner Hereweizen on tap puts the icing on the cake. I went there on a recommendation from a store worker nearby. At first I thought it was an old saloon as I saddled up to the bar. It was/is a bit of a dive but the plethora of patrons don't seem to mind. It seemed more like a ""local"" joint as well - not a lot of tourists. This was a good sign. I ordered the club and a beer and enjoyed some laughs as the blue collar construction workers who were seated next to me hit on the bar tender....at noon. They were funny guys!  I order the club sandwich which came with fries. Both were good. Overall, is go back again!",1

Affordable no frills spot with good food and good service!Fun dive bar/restaurant. Pretty chill and a lot more low key than most other spots in the neighborhood. Drinks were pretty cheap - $5 for almost any beer they had. It was late. We were buzzed and starving, so we opted for a couple of beers and a pizza.  Pizza came out pretty fast. It was fresh and hot and the toppings were great! Just the right amount of cheese and sauce. The beer was...beer. I'll def give this place another shot next time I'm in the area.",3

Located in the heart of soho, Fanelli's Cafe is THE premier place to go for breakfast all day long. Every-time I come here, it is always packed. There is a good reason for it: FOOD IS DELICIOUS! Call and make a reservation before coming because you might wait for a little. In my case I got lucky. I only waited 15 minutes for a table of three and it was during a lunch rush.I work around the corner and it is always my first choice. As we were sat down by the hostess, we were then greeted by our waitress. Which we know now has the famous SHEENA. Hopefully I spelled her name correctly. Not sure what I enjoyed most: her smile, spunkiness, friendly personna, or the food... I will just say sheena! No truly, shes that amazing.As usual when I am here, I order 3 eggs scrambled, french toast and sausage links. Good to the last drop!! Cant think of anything else to say... Food is amazing, customer service is amazing, and decor is very nice. Me and my colleagues had a small chat with Sheena as shes running back and forth to different tables, and she is just a pleasant to talk too :-)We admire her candor and rely on her knowledge to tell us what tastes great at Fanelli's.If you are ever in soho, stop by and Enjoy!

Servers are friendly, there's a good selection of beers and they are generous with the drink pours. The food is pretty standard pub/tavern type things (burgers, sandwiches, shepherds pies etc), and while it won't blow your socks off, it's pretty decent for 'pub grub'. Considering it's smack bang in the middle of SoHO, Fanelli's is very reasonably priced indeed and a great spot to stop for refreshment when you need a break from shopping.",1

Small, divey place that exudes oldness and dusty charm. It's like walking into a past world. A few things worth noting: the food is good but not great; the same can be said of the service from time time; it's usually crowded up front, but there's often seating in the back (also, during the summer there are open windows in the back room); I don't think I've ever walked in and found an open seat at the bar, but a little patience can pay off.",

We got lucky- 15 people left right as we got there so we got a table immediately. But if you're coming with more than 2 people, try to make a reservation or get there ahead of time. The service was excellent; we got lots of personal attention and a warm friendly vibe. Food was yummy. We had sandwiches and beer. Beer prices are cheap for NY! My croque monsieur was so delicious too. This place is great because there isn't a lot of stuff like this in soho. Warm friendly, mom and pop style, not pretentious, hearty food. Soho is mainly overpriced coffee shops, and luxury retail, so it's nice to have a solid low key place for lunch/beers when you're in the area. Will come back for sure!",
30,,9/1/2018,0,,"Manhattan, PRINCE, NY",Sarah S.,0,3.0,4,"Love this spot, late night food, old school ambiance, but they are bad at kicking out creeps.

31,,5/15/2017,0,,"Madison, NJ",Sanghita B.,23,4.0,133,Stopped by for a quick lunch pick up on a breezy cold may afternoon as I was craving for a hearty soup. The pick up place is an extension of the cafe looking out to the street for a quick soup or wrap pick up.They have at least 5-6 soup and wrap options available and the staff is pretty friendly and nice. For 6 plus dollars you can get a small cup of soup and a bread/cracker.Loved the hearty moroccon lamb soup; with chickpeas a kick of spices and generous chunks of lamb served with a slice of fresh bread.I will like to visit them again to try their wraps or the other soups. Also note that this is a cash only place and sometimes there is a queue during the lunch time.,
32,1,1/17/2017,124,1,"Queens, NY",Luci B.,2655,5.0,1307,"I had such an incredible time here and was NOT in the greatest of moods, but Fanelli's totally overpowered my sourness. I was meeting two people for dinner who were seated somewhere in the back, but the place was so packed that I decided to take my coat off at the bar before trying to find them. Immediately two friendly regulars bought me a Blue Moon! We started talking about the place, how it's a wonder it survived so long in this neighborhood, how great the burgers are. We chatted to so long my dining companion actually had to come up and get me to join them. They ran out of seats and so had to seat me at the end of a table on a folding chair by the swinging kitchen door. It was loud and friendly and I never got hit with that door once. I wasn't too hungry so I had a few bites of my friends burger and it had to be the juiciest burger I've ever had. It actually squirted halfway across me, hitting me in the arm and leg. I could see this being annoying, but I just cracked up and went to the itty bitty bathroom to wash it up. While waiting in the bathroom line the woman ahead of me started talking and we had a great conversation. After she went in I noticed a freaking ROTARY PHONE on the wall. And it's free to use. I called my roommate and left some sort of wacky voicemail. Once we were done the after work rush was finally dying down, I met this couple from the South who comes here whenever they're in the city. They had these two kids of theirs, and normally I really hate kids, but theirs were alright. Maybe it was just the magic of Fanelli's. As the night wore on we were definitely getting the way of the waitresses, who were beyond kind and patient about the whole thing. Really, the people who work and patronize this place was what made our night so memorable. The bartender never said a word to me (or anyone, as far as I could tell), only got me my drinks and warmly smiled as I waved goodbye. Much love.",1

I have to point out I've been coming to this establishment since I was in high school, and I'm in my 30's so I've been coming for a while now. The food as always was awesome, but our waitress, well perhaps she thinks she's funny, but her ""joke"" wasn't at all funny.Perhaps, my husband and I shouldn't have been as affectionate ( he came in to give me a kiss), and our waitress came over just as we were giving each other a kiss (no French kissing or anything like that) and she's goes ""is this your mom?"" I was stunned. Before this, as with all servers I was nice piloting, smiling, but this ""joke"" was beyond tasteless. She was our waitress and not our ""friend"", we weren't at the comedy cellar, we were having a late lunch... it would never occur to me to say any sort of mother jokes to strangers, let alone, strangers at work. It's not professional. What is our mothers were dead? After she saw the look on my face she started to justify her poor/tasteless joke... i don't want anyone losing their job, but she must not say these things to her customers. Next time I go there I will refuse to be served by her. She wasn't funny, she didn't know us, and it was tasteless.

38,,12/30/2017,217,,"Charlotte, NC",Shirice L.,2,1.0,11,Probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant anywhere around the world. The server was very dismissive. She walked past the table several times without acknowledging us. We left 20+% in cash as a tip and she didn't appreciate it. She brought the check back to the table with the tip circled at the bottom of the receipt. When we left the table she proceeded to approach us concerning the tip that was left. She then became very aggressive and sent another coworker when she didn't receive the response that she was looking for. It was very unprofessional as I was on my way to retrieve cash to tip her. I have served before so I understand cash tips vs. credit card tips. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The food was mediocre and not worth the experience.,1

The burger was so overchared on the outside and it had a strange texture on the inside even though I asked for medium rare. The bread was so bland as was the burger and honestly it probably worse than the burger at your average NYC diner. The french fries were equally as bland. After tax and tip the burger will cost you close to $20 which is quite alot.The service was fairly friendly so thats that. The space is quite old and give a decent old nyc ambience you find in places like Petes Tavern If you are seeking a Bison burger, the one at bareburger is actually pretty good",

Updated review",43,,"River Edge, NJ",Paul F.,21,5.0,59,"Reviewer ""FK"" makes an interesting point (about 3 reviews down), and it's true. The wait staff does cater to us ""old men"" who sit in the corner. It's easy to figure out why....we're ""regulars"". Never in a rush, always willing to chat up the tourists and give local advise. We know what to eat and how to tip. That's what makes this bar one of the few that still exists in NYC that has ""regulars"". And please don't take offence but if your ordering spaghetti in a dive bar....well....you'll get dive bar spaghetti..! (Order the Salmon Salad next time...for $8.00 its perfect.)",1

Other delicious things to try: tuna melt (great), fish and chips (very small portion), chicken club sandy (always solid), and the WINGS are amazing - super crispy and served dry. That's the way to go. Service is spotty, but once you make it clear you're not a tourist, you're in the girls' good graces. Ask for big, normal glasses of water, otherwise you get this little thimble thing and it's torture. Also, don't get soda here. Blech.",

Luckily we beat the dinner rush and were able to score a table AND place our order before it turned into a madhouse. I got the 2 egg sandwich with sausage and fries and nibbled some of my fiancée's pesto linguine with sausage. It was an interesting egg sandwich in that I was expecting breakfast sausage (you know, it being breakfast foods and all) but I was surprised to find a link of italian sausage in the sandwich! The fries were natural cut!As for the pasta, it was pretty standard fare, nothing crazily extraordinary, but it was exactly what it said it would be: tomatoes, pesto, pasta, sausage. This place seems like a decent option if you're in the mood for American/Italian, but I think I'd venture out and try a different food place before heading back to Fanelli's.

The dark wood and small tables are good for intimate dates or casual get-togethers.  The food is served quickly, as in a diner, and the meal is much better than what you'd expect.My only complaint is the noise level - be prepared to shout at your companion during peak dinner times, as the place is small and people's voices frequently overlap each other. Other than that, it's a cool, unpretentious place to hang out in Soho, especially for those of us who don't look like models.",1

She then sat at the back bar playing on her iphone and glaring at us with the look of death. It was empty when we arrived, really, but as more people flooded in, it got a little lively.

Not one minute later, a waitress (who I'm sure was generally sweet) approached our table and asked if we wouldn't mind leaving, as their were others waiting.

The seating process is confusing since there's no host stand up front and the bar is in the back of the room, so the girls back there yell, ""Come on in!"" and such, thereby slightly disturbing everyone in the restaurant. It was hella busy when we stopped in, so we sat at the bar. The food was fine. Pretty typical burger and steak sandwich fare that left us full and didn't upset our stomachs. The beer selection was fine, too. I will say, once I took a full good look around the place and was able to absorb the 1920s boxing theme, I loved it. And the ceiling is an amazing pattern, so I assume it's actually vintage. Overall, we had a good experience and might go back if we need relatively cheap grub.

The best meal on the menu is the pumpkin ravioli. it's life changing. The large assortment of beer is pretty awesome too. the staff is a bit impatient but the food and vibe make up for it.,

We managed to find a seat right by the bar and met Bob - the bartender. We ordered a few beers, and he simply asked us for a $20 at the end of it without really realizing how many we had drank. Overall, it's quite the experience! This is one of the oldest bars in Soho (or NYC) for that matter. To note, Bob is also famous! He is from Serbia and used to box professionally.",1
115,1,2/24/2012,543,,"Forest Hills, NY",Jason P.,3574,3.0,1119,"Fanelli's Cafe is the second oldest restaurant location in New York, however under a different moniker dating back to 1847, with The Bridge Cafe being the first in 1794. I did make the mistake of McSorley's Ale House holding that claim, but I just recently discovered they didn't open up until 1862. Since 1922, it has retained its current name of Fanelli's and is historical in that it once played a vital role as a speakeasy during the Prohibition. Since then, this aged and worn bar has served cheap drinks and food.Fanelli's is one of those establishments I remember seeing as a kid. I've never had a chance to visit there, envying from afar as I watched the crowds laugh and drinks flowing. Finally, our party of 4 decided to check this place out. After a 25 minute wait, we were seated in the back dining room. Tables covered with red and white table cloths, aged wooden furniture, walls plastered with photos. All of it surmounted to a very old-fashioned yet cozy bar.Several beers are on tap, such as Sixpoint, Stella Artois, Brooklyn Lager, Paulaner Hefeweizen and range from $5-$6 each. I opted for a Paulaner Hefe-weizen ($6.00) which is served in a very tall pilsner-like glass. Golden with a subtle cloudiness to it, great aromas, with a nutty and wheaty flavor profile. I could definitely drink a few of these.For my entree, I ordered a Beef Burger ($12) with Bacon (+$1). It took about 15 minutes to come out, served on an onion roll with lettuce, tomato and onion. Served on the side was a decent portion of slightly-thinner than shoestring fries and a semi-sweet semi-sour pickle sliced longitudinally. I had high hopes of the burger. My first bite was juicy. It was so juicy that it exploded all over my left sleeve from shoulder to cuff. I'm still trying to get the juice stains out of the shirt. But after that first bite, the burger was some overcooked with a burnt, almost charcoaley taste. I ordered my burger medium, but it came out well-done without any sign of pinkness to the meat. Besides being overcooked, it was bland. The two long slices of crispy bacon helped a little from the saltiness, but not enough to make the burger enjoyable. I found myself squeezing a huge dollop of ketchup on it, to give it some flavor. The fries were crispy, but that's where it ended. They were not seasoned at all, making for a rather boring french fry.I also tried the Cornmeal Crusted Calamari with a side Spicy Tomato Sauce ($9) and a lemon wedge. The calamari was actually pretty good, maybe because I was so let down from my burger. But the cornmeal added a nice crunchy texture to the outside, while the calamari was perfectly cooked: firm but still slightly soft. The spicy tomato sauce was very delicious and I think it would have added as an excellent topping to my burger.Table service was nonexistent. Our waitress had only come by to take our order, drop our food off and offer us the bill. She had never checked on us once. Maybe they were having a busy day and off their game. We sat near the kitchen door, and every time the one of the watiresses came out of the kitchen, he would start repeatedly ringing the call bell, to let the waitresses know yet another dish was ready. It was a bit obnoxious and annoying, as the bell was ringing throughout our entire meal.Fanelli's definitely looks like a fun spot to relax with some friends. Beer is fairly cheap, considering they don't serve you the generic domestic beers (Bud, Coors Light, etc.). But the food is something I'll have to reconsider. Maybe their food has gone down in quality, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they were having an off-day, as the place was crowded, so that's got to mean something. That and considering Fanelli's is one of the oldest establishments in New York City. But when I recollect my thoughts, I can't recall too many tables having any food on their table (maybe 5 of the ~14 tables inside). Most had a few drinks on their table. Will I return to Fanelli's? Probably, but with reservations.",1

117,,4/20/2015,0,4,"New York, NY",M. M.,0,1.0,34,"Just a little update now, in June 2015: I noticed that after I wrote my 1 star review, this store got a bunch of rave reviews. Just want to mention to those who don't know that most of those kinds of reviews are made by the business or friends, marketers and others who work for the business. You can often tell which ones they are, because they are so bright and shiny, like an ad! Or they are utterly devoid of emotion. It happens a lot anymore. Amazon is suing some businesses for this practice. The other shiny reviews: guess they don't know what a good bar/restaurant is. Or maybe the jerks I'm talking about were not there. Here's what I wrote 4/2015: I started to go here when I owned an art gallery down the street. I continued to go here fairly often because I had friends in the neighborhood and knew people who worked at Fanelli's. It used to be an art bar. Mr. Fanelli used to stand at the cake stand and welcome everyone. After he passed away, it was still nice to come here because the ambiance and conversation was good.I was back in Soho last week, in the evening. After my meeting, I decided to stop in for old times sake. I will not make that mistake again. I stopped at the restroom first and less than 1 minute after I went in, somebody was pounding on the door. I said ""somebody's in here"". Whoever it was started hitting so hard, I thought they were trying to break it down. It had to be a guy, because of how hard he was hitting it. I hit the door with my hand in reply. The guy quit bonging on the door. When I came out, I gave the guy a nasty look. I said nothing to him or anyone else. That kind of kiddie-dive-bar crap never used to happen here. But I didn't want to make a big scene. Nobody said anything to me either. But it seemed like he worked there, because he seemed to have a little audience.I got a seat at the other end of the bar. The bartender refused to serve me. I asked him why and he wouldn't tell me. I demanded to know why and he said I was drunk and belligerent. Maybe we could be friends another time. I was astonished and angry, since I had not drank any alcohol that evening at all, and only gave they guy who tried to break the bathroom door down while I was in there a ""look"". I was dressed ""correctly"". I had not bothered anybody.I left. I will never be friends with the idiot behind the bar and will never go back to Fanelli's until they sell it to somebody who hires intelligent, responsible help. Let the tourists, B/T and those who don't know what good service is have it! Has  the Health Dept been there lately? I can't imagine these people, with such a low mentality and lack of manners, could be hygiene-conscious. Not a thing looked like it was cleaned or painted since Fanelli was alive. It's just a dump with too many assholes working there now. So maybe they were doing me a favor by not letting me consume anything in there.",7

Small, a little dark, copper ceilings, small tiled floor, wise-guy bartender and 2 dining areas. Used to be a house? Probably. We sat towards the rear of the first dining area. The gathering point for the servers. I caught myself smiling to myself as I heard their remarks as people walked in and stopped near the door waiting for a hostess. Don't be afraid. Walk in and tell the waitress where you want to sit. They won't bite. After-all, it is New York. If you like seafood, get the muscles with rice. The muscles were extremely fresh. You have your choice of sauce they add to the dish (more like a broth as  the dish is served in a bowl). I recommend the ginger sauce, since that was recommended to me by the waitress. The ginger sauce compliments the muscles well. You can taste the onion, garlic, red pepper and the ginger. More important, the dish is light a fresh. The bowl is packed with muscles, so if you are a light eater, you can share this dish. Too bad they don't have ginger beer.

We should have stuck it out at Mercer.Fanelli's serves basic, no-frills bar food at Soho prices. Not a shocker. Just expected something to be better -- the prices, the food, the environment -- but everything was sort of subpar. Don't get me wrong -- I wasn't expecting Mercer refinement or Mickey D's prices -- and I wasn't expecting haute cuisine -- but I doubt we'll be regulars unless we desire a fraternity-house-odor-meets-Balthazar-bill experience. Needless to say, we won't.As for the food, my girlfriend had an omelette that was good but nothing memorable, although my burger -- rounded and crispy on the outside  like a football but super-juicy and uber-tasty (both fairly good things) was tasty, topped with cheddar and bacon and a tasty brioche onion roll. Get where I'm going with this? Her brunch was average at best, and mine was on par with Shake Shack. Plus her ginger ale and my beer, $50 including tip. Um...they don't charge for the stale of beer and the flies a-buzzin'.Definitely worth a stop if being seen and not heard is a good thing, but not during daylight and definitely not for brunch. And definitely, definitely not if you're the one paying the tab.BTW, one really awesome tidbit of trivia about Fanelli's is the back room was where they filmed a crucial scene of the Sean Penn film ""State of Grace"" -- back when the Mercer Hotel was a vacant lot (late 80's).

The surprise was that it was served on an English Muffin. I've never had this before, but I'll try anything once. I was pleasantly surprised. The bartender said they didn't receive their normal bread delivery because of the 4th, so that's why they were using the muffins. Granted, it was a bit messy, but without asking the bartender gave me extra napkins. It's the little things that matter. :)My friend wanted a Stoli Blue and lemonade, but the bartender (Johnny) said they didn't have any lemonade. Instead of leaving it at that, he MADE her some lemonade so she could have her drink. Granted, it was slow and I doubt he would have made the same offer if it were a Friday night, but she was a happy camper and appreciated the extra effort. We also got to know the bartender and how he literally walks to work an hour and twenty minutes each way.

Fortunately, Fanelli's was right around the corner so we decided to give it a try. I must say, the food was moderately priced and tasted great. I had the spinach and cheese ravioli special, my friend Lara had the sesame chicken salad and Brandon had the BLT sandwich. We all enjoyed our meals - well, sort of. I mean the ravioli was clearly done from scratch which I LOVED. However, I am not a fan of heaps of sauce on my pasta and there was just way too much on my plate. My poor ravioli was drowning in a red sea. I also wish they had used marinara sauce which IMO is much sweeter and to my liking than regular spaghetti sauce - But I still enjoyed it. Honestly, I enjoyed Lara's dish the most. Her salad had this amazing sesame dressing and the chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled. She loved it so much she scrapped the plate!Our waitress was super sweet and helpful. I enjoyed the service.

It's a place you not only could fall in love with but should. Why? Because they're real. You walk in, ask to use the restroom and you'll be called out to everyone in the bar as sure as there's liquor in those bottles behind the bar. But it's not just great because of the no-nonsense management style. The food is better than bar food and the drinks are as they should be. The beer is cold and the liquor is strong. Yeah, it's not the kind of place to get $1 draws or $4 drinks - look elsewhere for that but just know you'll get what you pay for. I've eaten here a several times now, the first was breakfast after a really long night and frankly I don't remember the food much. I do remember a feeling of empathy though, they must have known. Recently I went back and hoped to get in before the kitchen closed. At 11:15 on July 4th I asked if the kitchen was still open and the guy behind the bar answered as if it was kind of a dumb question. Cool, they'll feed me til about 1.I ordered the veggie burger, fries and a belgian beer. The beer was good, fries were nice and the veggie burger was amazing. I've had veggie burgers in every timezone in the US and this wasn't even in the same ballpark as the rest. In fact, I was really worried they had fixed me a regular burger. It did have veggies in it so I'm assuming all is well. It was just great.Recently I went back post ""Hurricane"" Irene and was glad the kitchen was open. A lot of places still weren't open but Fanelli was. Perfect. A friend came with this time and while I ordered my standard veggie burger, he ordered the steak. This is always dangerous in a cafe that may be more of a bar but he said they pulled it off. He said it was one of the better steaks he'd had. Wow, that's impressive.So Fanelli Cafe has become my favorite NYC restaurant bar. I simply love that place.",3

Eating this also helps me offset the large amounts of beer that I guzzle when I am here on a hot summer afternoon (which in turn makes the rest of my trip to NYC a little more interesting).",2
