0,Luisa R.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,0.0,5.0,3/1/2017,4/14/2015 This is a great place with good food and good people. The only problem is not realizing their are many vegans who frequent the place. Love their miso soup but hate when they touch the meat for non vegans but proceed to put vegetables in the vegans soup without changing their gloves. Maybe a spoon for each food item going into the soup would be the perfect solution.,,,1

The breakfast is with real eggs and still does not taste good. The buffet has lots of options and is really the way to go. Dont go after 2pm for lunch as the food will have been sitting out for awhile.,,,

I remind him that I do not work there and will not be pouring any coffee,especially at the inflated prices.

6,Jennifer D.,"Claremont Village, Bronx, NY",0,4,2,1.0,10/9/2017,"I work right down the block so I come here very often. I've always found the cashiers extremely rude but I've never said anything. Today, it was overwhelmingly rude. A few of my coworkers and I are familiar with the manager and he's always very nice. Converses when we come in if he's around. Today, my coworker and I went in for some fries. Cost about $4 and change. Again, I emphasize, we come here a lot and have had our debit card swiped with no issue even at that amount. Also, there's no minimum by debit card (LEGALLY, look it up). They said ""no we are not going to charge you"" but in such a condescending tone. We would've understood if they were polite. So we tried explaining to them that we've been swiped before for the same amount and both a gentleman and two women were there with nasty faces/attitudes. They said ""we don't care, we can just give it back and they'll resell it"". It was just the unpleasant attitudes. Took a lot for me to not tell them off. If you're going to run a business, minimum you can do is have polite employees. Not have individuals who hate their jobs/ lives and want to take it out on daily customers.Plus their food has become subpar and extremely overpriced. Ambrosia Deli right down the block has much better food and sweeter people!",3,,

The buffet food is surprisingly good but you have to be careful and not eat with your eyes! I seem to end up paying nearly twenty bucks every time I go lol. I'm just not a fan of the prices. The last time I went, (like another reviewer complained about) the short asian cashier took care of my order so while I was waiting for her to give me my card back, she took care of another customer. After a couple of minutes of my standing there, she said she gave me my card back. I must have looked confused because she pointed to the card that was BEHIND my bag of food. I told her I didn't know since it was BEHIND my bag and she just shrugged and took care of the next customer. Thanks for wasting my time! The other cashiers are nice though. Too bad there's not another comparable buffet place nearby.",,,

Also, one of the few that has Korean food items such as kimchi and japchae (clear noodles) at the buffet. Pretty tasty, I would say. Decent choices of vegetables and meats as well like various styles of chicken. Grilled chicken has that grill charred taste which I like. There is also a sushi, sandwich, and a toss salad bar. Many different choices for lunch depending on what you are craving for. Overall, it is alright. This is not a place I would come back often unless I'm really craving that japchae.",2,3,3
13,Megan S.,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,1.0,2/13/2018,"I was there this Monday and it looked like a great place to come everyday and grab coffee or lunch. Food was decent, I really enjoyed the hot food bar. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the one specific staff member. She is short, asian cashier. Incredibly rude, as if she hates her life and her working environment and takes out her anger from customers. Raises her voice, throws my food in the bag as if she has the right to act like that toward a customer. I lost my all interest in supporting this business and FOR SURE will not set a foot in that place again. This is CALLED BAD MANAGEMENT.

The chicken cutlet tasted like wood and the pasta was so mushy it was probably sitting there since breakfast. The staff were all rude, I asked why such a small amount for the price and the server responded a simple ""I don't know."" At checkout, I was scolded in a language that seemed like a combination of English and Chinese because I tried to pay with a credit card in the ""cash only lane."" Cash only lane??? What is this, a toll booth on the Jersey Turnpike?? Next time I'll drive my car through the front window, it would be a better experience than eating here.",,3,1

I gave it a shot when I first arrived in Sept 2015 but at 3:30PM nothing was available except for half of the salad bar. it was ""MEH"". mediocre-ish. Gave it another chance today at 2:00PM. The ramen bar, sandwich and hot plate bar and pizza bar was open. I went to the sandwich bar and asked for gyro combo which was suppose to come with waffle fries. The guy acknowledges me with his eyes and just walked away. He plated my food and I said I thought it comes with waffle fries? he said ""we ran out. You don't have to take it if you don't want to"". I mean seriously WHAT THE FLYING FUCK was that?!?! I don't know why I took it and paid $15 for it! Granted everything in this area is SUPER tourist expensive, it was my stupid move for even taking it. I for sure will NEVER EVER go back there and tell my whole office of 800 employees to NEVER EVER go there. Go to the other spot across the street and further east a little called Ambrosia.

My colleagues got food from Café Manhattan, while I brought in outside food. I was told that I couldn't stay even if I didn't eat my food. I was told by the owners that I had no manners.

The pre made meals are prepared right before the lunch rush so it's all super fresh, you can see the steam form on the to-go ware. The buffet style lunch... Where do I start? They have the best most freshest myriad of unexpected choices. My company has ordered catering from Cafe Manhattan and it has hands down the best presentation. The catering workers take a long time making sure they make a statement. The continental breakfast with the fruit bowl.. I've never seen fresher fruit. The fresh squeezed orange juice. The fresh baked danishes. Did I mention this was all fresh? Try and out and thank me later.",8,,
21,Stephanie T.,"Manhattan, NY",5,37,12,1.0,12/9/2016,"Wow. I have never experienced racism in my life until now. Rude cashier was rushing me to pay, took the Asian customers ahead of me even tho they were behind me on line. She gives me my change and then says thank you to the Asian woman and nothing to me. I said you're welcome. She nodded at the Asian woman. I said fine, give me my money back $8 for a tuna sandwich with hardly any tuna on it was absurd anyway. Some other Asian woman steps in and gives me the money. I asked for the $10 bill I gave her instead of the singles she gave me back. I gave her a $5 and 5 singles and she put it on the register and then didn't give me the $10.  Is this woman nuts?  I asked for the $10. She insisted she gave me the refund. She did not and then yells at me ""listen, I gave you the money.""  I said pay attention, you owe me a $10. I gave you the 5 and 5 ones. She must've realized the error of her ways as she meekly handed me the $10 with no apology. Poor counter guys they are stuck here with these hens for bosses. I also think I saw a few roaches on the buffet.  NYC should check this out. Avoid at all costs, the bad reviews are right. Wish I had listened and kept walking",,,

I went to the buffet, which had your standard-fare choices. I went for a tray by the pound, and sampled a little bit of what appealed to me. My favorite were the Swedish meatballs, of which I took two. I also had a couple slices of flank steak, and a couple bites of the sesame chicken and chicken with broccoli, with a side of lo mein.  The tray weighed in at a pound, which they priced at $10.36. For a sample tray that was by no means full to capacity, the price was a bit steep, considering that the lunch specials I saw ranged from $6.95-10.95. I didn't have the bad experience that some here have described, since it was a quick stop, and to-go, but for what it was, the food was ok.",,,1
25,Mary B.,"Manhattan, NY",17,37,13,3.0,7/22/2015,Yes! They do carry a lot of items that most cafés don't have a very big variety of fruits and vegetarian items on their buffet but unfortunately the price does not match up to the quality although it is Midtown Manhattan the prices are little bit higher than the other buffet style serving cafes in the area.They should add a special rate between the off-hours like 2 to 6 PM. Also the food should be labeled not everyone knows what's what.,1,,
26,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",95,448,0,3.0,12/6/2013,"I was super thrilled when I discovered Cafe Manhattan a mere 5 minute walk from my office - as it's a much better alternative to the adjacent ""C"" related Italian place that seems to be popular among the lunch crowd.Here's what I like about Cafe Manhattan:* Seems to be very clean* Buffet is presented very nicely* Lots of selection and some really good things like the salmon, the avocado, the brussels sprouts and cauliflower.Here is what I HATE about Cafe Manhattan:* Cashier's are SO UTTERLY RUDE. I mean it's NYC, I get it. But seriously? Can you not wait one second without huffing and puffing so I can count out what I owe you?* Which brings me to the second thing I dislike about this place: if your minimum isn't $10 you can't use a credit card. This is a problem for me on like 10 different levels, most of which is that I can't eat $10 worth of a buffet (it's by weight FYI). I just can't. So if you won't let me use my credit card then you probably need to exercise some patience as I count out my money. Yes?* Certain buffet items scare me a little, for example, the ""shrimp."" Not sure what this is but I am 99% sure it's not shrimp. My co-worker and I are intrigued. But not in a good way.Overall I try to avoid this place because I don't like to give people my hard earned CASH when they are so rude and unfriendly. But my options are limited so until I grow a brain in my own kitchen I guess I have to deal with Cafe Manhattan at least once a week.",1,,

30,Natasha D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1000,196,161,2.0,9/8/2014,"My mother (and NYC dining companion) inexplicably was fascinated by New York's business buffet lunch scene and frequently mentioned we should pop into one of the cafés sporting this culinary dynamic. I wasn't nearly as enthused (Pret A Manger will always be my grab and go lunch of choice in NYC) but I finally broke down and stopped making excuses to procrastinate the inevitable. Cafe Manhattan looked harmless enough, I thought. Wrong. I was so completely wrong.As other reviews pointed out, the place is nicely organized and clean. The employees were super friendly (the only reason I'm giving it an extra star). One even gave my mom a sample despite the yellow labels declaring samples weren't allowed, which was really sweet of her. The issue, of course, was the food. I can't remember the last time I actually spat out food - I must've been in single digits. But I did with their ""shrimp"", right into my napkin. It wasn't even real shrimp - it was some kind of sickeningly sweet ""grilled"" tofu shaped like shrimp. Why? Why would anyone bastardize shrimp like that? It actually made me sad (and a bit nauseated). The asparagus had that old fridge taste and everything else was old. The Brussels sprouts and penne pasta were decent, though. I only took a sliver of each.My mother actually apologized for making us go there after the meal, and since we ate so little (despite having nearly full plates), we just finished the rest of our lunch at Pret. I always feel bad writing negative reviews like this, but I just feel restaurant food should be fresh...and real. I will not return and truly hope this cafe will improve their freshness factor.",6,3,4

They have everything you could be looking for and tons of healthy options. I'm not a sandwich kind of person so when it comes to lunch I'm always struggling to find something I like, and this place always comes through.They also are the only place I've seen with black rice sushi. It's absolutely delicious! They do cut corners on their sushi sometimes, I once had a roll with spicy sauce and they conveniently omitted the salmon from one of the pieces, so keep an eye out.Good quality food and something for everyone.",,,

Also, I'm small and I can get chicken and rice in one of the small containers for 6 dllrs. pretty AWESOME price for a hot freshly prepared meal. I probably come here once or twice a week.

I will never eat here again. This however, is not the only reason I won't be eating there again.* They are in violation of their Visa Merchant Agreement by placing a minimum charge on debit cards. On July 21st, 2010 the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Consumer Protection Act stated that minimum purchases on debit cards is not allowed and can only be applied to credit cards. They think they're skirting the law by claiming that their system only processes credit cards and can't accept debit cards. Any card with a Visa logo can be accepted anywhere the Visa logo is displayed or accepted, credit cards and debit cards. They are still in violation of their merchant agreement and I have filed additional complaints with my issuing bank and Visa. * They claim that the buffet is $4.25/lb, but this week I took my food back to the office and weighed it on the scale. It came to 1 pound, 8.4 ounces which is 1.525lbs. My total cost (I only bought food, no drink or additional items) was $15.55. Going by their posted weight, I should have been charged $6.48+tax.* The cashiers are RUDE! I know it's fast paced and it's NYC but come on, they will yell or scream at you if you're not fast enough.

I recently returned after a two-year break to find their food is almost DOUBLED in the price as a place right across the street (Cafe 45). A turkey and swiss cheese sandwich with lettuce and tomato on whole wheat toast was $8.75! At Cafe 45, the same EXACT sandwich is $5.25 AND they offer you a pickle.

The fruit was wonderful, especially the raspberries and pineapple. For lunch or dinner, the sesame chicken and the cold green bean/sesame dish were my favorites.  DH liked their egg, bacon and cheese on croissant for breakfast and the beef stew for lunch or dinner.

It was disgusting!I had a few things from the steam table (chicken, ribs) that were truly awful and didn't get past two bites. The salad was soggy. The upstairs eating area was populated by loud louts drinking Coor's Lite and shouting on their telephones. The food is overpriced only because it's so disgusting - if it was edible the prices would be very reasonable.The whole scene was depressing and matched the food. I might have been better off with one of the ready-made sandwiches that didn't look too bad, but will never come back so will never know.An overall dreadfully negative experience.",1,,1

The salad and hot bar are incredibly fresh and appetizing. It's very neat and presented well. The sandwich bar is incredible with a vast selection ranging from half sandwiches that are anything but boring and can also be paired with a small soup or salad to beautiful pre-made salads. I spotted a grilled salmon with hummus and greek salad and pita bread which I am dying to try. The fruits and veggies are wonderful too. There is also a roasted meat and mexican food area and you can make your own salad or sandwich. I opted for the Udon which was delicious and $2 cheaper than the place across the street.
