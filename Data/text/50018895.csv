0,Shayna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,97,24,5.0,5/24/2018,Definitely had a great time here!Me and the boyfriend got some sandwiches. I opted for the Jerk Chicken and he got a Po Boy. Let me tell you:Come here on an empty stomach because the portions are so big! Which is a great thing but I just couldn't finish my sandwich!! The service was great and it wasn't busy save for the few older women having dinner but it was a lovely atmosphere and I will definitely be back for some of the seafood options they have!,1,,
1,Zehra M.,"New York, NY",138,98,157,4.0,10/30/2018,"The cozy atmosphere, coupled with comforting and fresh sandwiches was exactly what I needed on a cold evening. I was impressed by the portion sizes, and the shrimp po-boy sandwich and blackened chicken salad had a burst of southern spices and flavor. I will most certainly be coming back here, and with a bottle of wine since it's BYOB!",,,
2,Nate F.,"Philadelphia, PA",40,189,15,4.0,10/26/2018,"The jerk chicken sandwich wasn't what I was expecting but still good nonetheless. Nice sloppy eating, haaa.. The spicy fries were very flavorful. Service was really friendly and accommodating on a gloomy Sunday evening. Wasn't really packed in there. My friend is a regular and loves it. Seems like a nice welcoming neighborhood spot.Now what I need next time is definitely that Po Boy sandwich. I slept on that but the pictures are looking magnificent. I'm sure we'll be back again.",,,

Updated review","Shrimp po'boy on fleek! Do the kids still say that? Awesome southern inspired menu, small establishment but not too cramped. I came here with a friend and we ordered the shrimp po'boy and bacon mac and cheese. The food honestly took so long I was thinking that maybe someone forgot to put my order in but once I tasted the food I went back in time and retracted every concerned and annoyed feeling that I had before. The toasted bread was absolutely perfect. The shrimp was large and they didn't skimp on quantity. The chipotle mayo brought all of the flavours together for the most incredible party in your mouth. I had a taste of the bacon mac and cheese and it tasted like I could have eaten the entire bowl in 2 minutes if it wasn't scorching hot and it also wasn't my food lol. I ordered the po'boy and catfish bites via Postmates (so glad they finally got on there) once and was worried about the bread possibly getting soggy and it was somehow still flawless after transportation. The bites got a bit cold and were okay but they seemed like they'd be really good straight out of the oven/fryer/whatever.Totally itching to go back and maybe try the cajun pasta but let's be real, I'm hooked on that po'boy.",,,
4,Erin C.,"New York, NY",187,148,146,3.0,7/23/2018,"The truffle burger was a bit on the dry side but the sweet potato fries with chipotle aioli hit the spot! Not very busy on a Thursday evening so I was able to snag a window seat by myself to people watch. However, for some reason, it took forever for my burger to arrive. Luckily I wasn't in a hurry but I saw a guy picking up for Seamless or one of those services wait for 45 minutes, it seemed. Waiter was very attentive and nice. There's also a backyard patio with seating but it looked uncomfortable to my standards. Overall, a place I would go for a quick bite/takeout or meet someone for a drink or snack.",,,
5,John T.,"Queens, NY",312,392,466,4.0,6/28/2018,"Finally came here on a Saturday night after seeing all the delicious burger and Cajun seafood dishes. The truffle burger was delicious and I recommend adding the smoked Gouda cheese. I wish there was a bit more of the mayo or sauce. The sweet potato fries fried perfect. My wife had the seafood pasta which had great Cajun flavor. Also it was packed with seafood, definitely enough to share between two.I recommend coming a little earlier before 7:30 to avoid the dinner rush.",1,,1
6,Gloria K.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",485,520,605,4.0,6/23/2018,"A pretty good place for delicious burgers, perfect fries and one amazing seafood pasta.I came here for dinner and ordered the seafood pasta. Like everyone mentioned, it was delicious!!! It's a huge serving good enough for at least 2 people and they don't skimp out on the seafood or the noodles. It is a little bit spicy (just a kick of spice) but the spice blends so well with the seafood and the noodles. My fiancé had the truffle burger which I was lucky to even have a bite of. It was cooked a good medium well and the burger was juicy and overall well rounded. It also came with fries which were fried very well. It wasn't oily, saggy, or a sad fry. It was crunchy and each bite had a good sweet potato flavor. It would've made the other fries proud. I've also tried a friend's jambalaya which was just as good as the other entrees. Like the seafood pasta, the Jambalaya was served in a hugeeeeee bowl and she ended up eating half and taking the other half home.",1,,2
7,Diana M.,"Queens, NY",78,172,399,3.0,4/12/2018,"Stumbled upon this place while in search of a quick bite. I love the interior of this place. I opted for chicken wings, which I thought would be time-efficient, but not really. Instead, it came out way too hot in temperature, but delicious nonetheless! Great music playlist of Sango, Xavier Omar, Kaytranada, and similar-sounding artists.The establishment is BYOB-friendly since they do not serve alcohol.",2,1,1

9,Vanness B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",17,88,146,5.0,3/4/2018,My boyfriend has been coming to Junipers for about 10 years. He is a loyal customer and loves it. We go whenever we have the chance but it's been a while so we can tonight with three other people. Four people ordered bacon cheeseburgers with Gouda cheese and fries (varied between regular and spicy fries which is basically Cajun fries). I ordered a shrimp po boy sandwich. When I tell you that po boy was amazing. It was the BEST sandwich ever. I'm literally ordering that every.single.time. We had wings as an appetizer and the bill came to $100.,,,
10,Kirkland G.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,264,170,2.0,6/25/2018,Yelp what gives...? I didn't feel the love that others felt. I expected a bit more but ended up having an average experience. I feel as though the workers heads were in the clouds based on the service. It took 25 minutes for my partner and I to receive our catfish poppers appetizer. Those were tasty though. Our entrees arrived soon after (making it about a 35 wait for food) but the food was 'piping' hot. We had to wait for the food to cool.I ate their BBQ rib sandwich with French fries. The rib was flavorless. There was a scant amount of bbq on the meat; if there was a sauce I couldn't tell by taste. I asked for extra bbq sauce just to get some actual bbq flavor. At least it was juicy and a big portion.Decor-wise it's a bit homely. I wouldn't give a damn about that if the food was impressive. Overall I'm just underwhelmed.,,,1

Updated review","Honestly the most interesting American menu in Williamsburg, loveliest cook (he personally came to our table to ask how the food tasted), and nice server.  The restaurant is casual, has a few barstools, tables, and a funky/cool looking cash register.  Food will take a long time to come out but so worth it because it is delicious and prepared fresh.  The quality of your meal will be high.  They do not skimp on the good stuff.  We were happily surprised there was so much shrimp in my partner's dish-- you really get your money's worth.  My truffle burger was out of this world amazing.  Flavorful delicious food makes me a happy patron.  We were graced by the chef's presence towards the end of our mean.  He seems like a great guy.  If you go during summertime and are not afraid of mosquitos, there is extra seating in the backyard.  Juniper is not fancy, but it's fit for foodies.",4,2,2
15,Purvi N.,"Manhattan, NY",4,109,2,4.0,9/16/2018,"Hole in the wall BYOB Cajun restaurant with a great vibe. If you're in the mood for something chill this is your place. It is tiny, but attracts the kind of crowd that appreciates a cozy and homely ambience. The host was very friendly and the food was delicious. We ordered the sliders, shrimp pasta, cat fish and pulled pork sandwich, all of which were delicious. Make sure you are carrying cash as this place does not accept cards.",,,
16,Danessa R.,"New York, NY",21,109,115,5.0,1/2/2018,"Juniper is like going to a bar that doesn't serve liquor... But instead serves really great bar food...Ya know, like most bars should. I'm talking about chicken fingers, fries and pull pork sliders you can enjoy with or without booze but the winner here are their burgers... Juniper serves some bangin', spankin', juicy burgers. No frills. All classic. Nothing like Shake Shack or Shake Shack burger wannabes (you know who you are). The beef patties have a nice ratio of fat vs lean cause you get this nice greasy goatee, or what I like to call the ""hangover nectar"" after a big bite... You've been forewarned. Nothing about this place screams healthy or organic. It's quite the opposite. Afterwards your stomach will be laced in grease but my friends, it's soooooo worth it.",,,
17,Catie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,44,33,5.0,5/10/2018,"I am the biggest critic of burgers, so trust me when I tell you this is one of the most amazing burgers I have ever had. Delicious fries too. I'd recommend it to anyone living in or visiting Williamsburg. The service was also good. We didn't have to wait to be seated on a Saturday evening. The food didn't take too long to come out. Zero complaints.",1,,1
18,Salva B.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,21,2,2.0,4/9/2018,"Not sure what to think about the positive reviews of the truffle burger. Maybe I just was lucky enough to have better burgers in my life. Anyway, I was not impressed at all by the truffle burger everyone is raving about. And also it is bit overpriced at 16$ for just a regular burger, and cheese is extra 1$. I didn't taste the truffle to be honest. And the salad did not even have dressing, seemed like it was taken from a supermarket bag and put directly on the plate.Atmosphere is a bit dull and somber but the service is polite.Cash only.",1,1,1
19,Julia S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",38,148,145,4.0,9/9/2017,"Great place for lunch/brunch in Williamsburg. It is small but cozy. All dishes were really good, big and good price. I had the cobb salad, which was really good, and the sandwiches looked really tasty too. The only downside is that it took them a long time to bring the food, and they only accept cash.",1,,
20,Angelika B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",87,1,0,1.0,8/27/2018,After walking in I felt uncomfortable. The waitress began having a side conversation with my waiter while pointing at me. I almost felt like walking out but I stayed since I had already ordered. A few minutes after I ordered I overheard the lady tell my waiter to give me a small portion so that I order more. Once my fish came out it came with ranch sauce rather than tartar sauce which I thought was strange. At the end she gave me a 5$ charge for bringing in my own wine which is typically free. The lady told me they've had it for years but I have not been charged there previously as I have brought wine in twice before. It seems as though they set their rules as they go. Food is standard but staff was plain rude and unprofessional. I have never felt this uncomfortable in a resturant before. Customers should never have to feel this way.,,,
21,Ella K.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",0,33,7,5.0,5/20/2018,"Amazing food, amazing service! Need I say more? Ordered Cajun seafood pasta, delicious! Huge! A bit spicy, but delicious.

22,Christina L.,"East Bronx, NY",299,7,10,4.0,8/1/2018,"This place is a hidden gem! Came here starving and maybe that distorts this review but i had the jerk chicken salad and it was phenomenal. We also ordered the shrimp po boy, codfish poppers and jerk chicken sandwich we enjoyed all of it. Everything cooked to perfection i can't say anything more. The staff was so pleasant. If i ever find myself out here again i would definitely pass by.",,,
23,Noore A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,2,5.0,2/25/2018,"My friend and I got the catfish poppers to share and they were delicious. The breading was unique and crisp and the flavors were balanced. I would definitely go back for those alone. We ordered two entrees and shared those too. Entree one was the linguine with shrimp and entree two was one of the specials, chicken fried steak. The chicken fried steak came with white gravy, broccoli and mashed potatoes. It was pretty good but the steak was a little chewy. The linguine with shrimp was served in a broth which was SO good. I'm in love with the flavor of that broth. I thought it had deep flavors and tasted like it was made with care. I would definitely go back for those catfish poppers and the linguine. Also I think he was the manager, but he was really nice and came by to make sure everything was good.",1,,
24,Robert B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",5,96,8,5.0,2/18/2018,"Juniper is really, really good at what it does, which is like a southern comfort / creole style of cooking.  Prices are reasonable and taste of the food is about as good as your going to find for this type of stuff.  It's also conveniently located and rarely crowded - a shame given how enjoyable this is.  Also good for folks who aren't particularly adventurous eaters.  Four stars for the food, plus one for convenience/prices.",,,
25,Nini N.,"Lombard, IL",2,43,14,4.0,1/28/2018,This place was extremely good! I had the steak n cheese burger which was super delicious. They use cheddar cheese for it which I wasn't sure sbout but it turned out good! And pleaaase order their spicy fries!! They're so good!!!,1,,

The waitress was really friendly, cracked a few jokes which made my party laugh and proceeded to take our order. I have the truffle burger with Swiss cheese and spicy fries. Oh man was it good. This is the first burger that I didn't have to add any condiments. The truffle added just the right taste to this masterpiece. The burger was so juicy and each bite had such amazing flavors. The spicy fries had enough spice for flavor but didn't make you feel like you needed to order milk. Overall I was super surprised at this place since it literally was an off the cuff decision. Stop by and get some you won't regret it.",,,
28,Victoria R.,"North Arlington, NJ",21,46,5,5.0,4/23/2018,"After being turned away from a snobby restaurant, we came here in hopes of a better experience. The truffle burger with Gouda and a side of spicy fries really met that expectation! Recommended.",,,

Of course it was a burger with truffle oil, but the meat was juicy and full of flavor!  I also got it with spicy fries which were great! They were crispy and not overly seasoned.  The menu here is pretty interesting and for a small place they have some good items to try, which in my eyes, makes it worth coming back here!",4,1,1
30,Casey M.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,27,0,5.0,3/11/2018,A friend and I came across this place a couple weeks ago. We were looking to try a new place to eat in Williamsburg.

But everyone this restaurant is highly recommended!,1,,
31,Rm P.,"Floral Park, NY",0,4,0,5.0,8/23/2018,"The food here is delicious and fresh!  If you keep reading about the long wait on the food or food comes out real hot it's because the food is cooked to order so you will always be getting freshly cooked food. Their stuff does not just sit around like in an average restaurant. The wait is definitely worth every bite of it. The sliders are hand made patty's with a lot of flavor. They are not the cheap commercial crap you get elsewhere. The mixed green salad portion is very filling and The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, not greasy and crisp.

There is a liquor shop across the street. This time around when we came here it was not as busy, so we got our food in a timely manner.BURGER WAS SO JUICY! Sweet potato fries were made with fresh sweet potatoes and nicely fried. Cajun fries were nicely tossed to have seasoning to evenly coat each fry! One slice of gouda cheese, honestly that's all I need, I don't want the cheese to overpower the bun nor burger.",1,1,1
36,Carla M.,"Lombard, IL",0,13,14,5.0,9/20/2017,Hidden gem in Brooklyn. We found juniper on yelp and wanted to return the favor with an additional great review. I had a burger and my 12 year old had the chicken fingers. Both were super tasty. But can we talk about how amazing the fries were? I know fries are super simple but these were way above any expectation. So be advised- you're going to want a refill on the fries. The food is definitely the highlight. Other than that it was a quaint little place with a chill ambience and a convenient location- perfect for lunchtime or an afternoon date. We will definitely be back and I recommend that you check it out too!,,,

No wait to get a table and the food was delicious. We both had the fish and chips, which was delicious and made with catfish. However, portions are HUGE and I would highly recommend sharing this entrée and getting another appetizer to share instead. I tried the spicy chips (fries)- also great.

Yeah well that was me this Sunday. Oh, and it was raining.  I stumbled into Juniper in almost-max Sunday sadness mode, but the service and food were both so wonderful that I ended up having the nicest night. Our server was beyond kind and attentive, and the owner/chef took time to come say hi, inquire about our meal, and tell us about his processes. Juniper is a terrific neighborhood joint with GREAT french fries!",,,
48,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1851,4.0,4/30/2015,"Juniper ended up being much smaller than I had inticipated. They are a very small bare bones place with a few tables and a spacious backyard patio with a number of other tables. Some work needs to happen as far as decor and design goes so don't expect romance here. As far as the menu goes they have a very simple 1 page menu dominated mostly with sandwiches/burgers ($11-16) but they also have a number of apps ($5-14) and main dishes ($15-21) as well.  They're BYOB and charge a corking fee ($1 per beer or $5 per bottle of wine), if you forget beer there's a grocery store about a block away. I ordered the rib sandwich with sweet potato fries. I'm still baffled how you get a sold piece of rib meat this size without bones. The meat was cooked very well but I wasn't a fan of the abundance of the vinegary BBQ sauce they drowned the meat in, it really dominated the flavor. The pillowy brioche bun also took up much more real estate of the sandwich than the meat. The sandwich came with a small side of great coleslaw and a couple pickles and lettuce. Surprisingly the highlight of my meal was the sweet potato fries. They were some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had and would definitely get those again.

Somehow I had never realized Jambalaya was the American version of Paella, but there is was with my palette singing and thinking 'holy shit this taste as good as fresh made Paella!'.One winning dish is all the reason I need to really love a place, and from the looks of the menu Juniper had plenty more to offer.",3,,2

We ordered the truffle burger, Cajun seafood pasta, Cajun fries, regular fries and were potato fries. You may think that these are simple dishes but they each have their own different kick and the best of its kind that I've ever had. We did not do the BYOB option but their corking prices are reasonable. Food was amazingly delicious and the staff was like hanging with your friends. Definitely will come back here and would definitely recommend! We walked in around 10 on a Friday night and did not wait for a table at all. There is a back outdoor area and indoor area. Check it out if you are ever in this area!",,,

The Burger was above average.  The bun was excellent (reminded me of a Fudruckers bun.) I sat at the bar by myself and was helped right away.

But, the yelp reviews were outstanding for this little spot so my boyfriend and I decided to come here for a quick lunch and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.The menu is very simple and not too extensive with a blend of Southern & new American influences. We started with a special that was on the board: the SHRIMP & CORN CHOWDER SOUP ($8) and it was delicious. It was heartier than I expected with generous amounts of seafood and was very rich in flavor. I see myself craving this on a cold, rainy day and I hope they move it onto the permanent menu! Such a great price for amazing flavor. The entrees we ordered were the CATFISH SANDWICH and the TRUFFLE BURGER with GOUDA ($17). Both meals were absolutely worth it and delicious. The Catfish was thickly breaded, very crispy and it came with a tartar sauce and crunchy lettuce which were both great accents to the sandwich. Next, the Truffle burger came with mushrooms and was very simple...but probably hands down one of the best burgers I've had in NY so far. Thick juicy patty that was well seasoned and I also loved how they made the buns very crispy and buttery. Our meals both came with a side of Cajun seasoned SPICY FRIES (you have the REGULAR or SWEET POTATO option too) that were crispy and delicious as well.For the price and the quality of this spot, I will definitely be coming back. Our server, who also might be the owner (?), was very sweet and attentive to our table - really great service. I was eyeing a couple more things on the menu so I look forward to the next time I visit!",3,2,2

I typically don't like to spend more than $15 on a meal, but when it comes to seafood and this dish it's worth it. It's a huge portion and super tasty [also heavy on the garlic]. I've also had a chance to try their chicken tenders, coated with Rice Krispies for an extra crunch, as well as their sweet potato fries which are great. I'd like to eventually try everything on the menu. The service was a bit lackluster when I went. The waitress was heavily invested in watching TV and I would have liked her to check in a bit more frequently as my friend and I were the only people in the restaurant for our whole meal.

Dark, depressing and overall unkempt inside the restaurant.  Depressing wait service with little redeeming factors besides bringing the correct meal. Starting from just telling us to sit, short responses to questions on menu and just a generally unfriendly demeanor.  On the plus side, this place is BYO with no corkage fees. Negative, its cash only.  My meal was decent. I had the steak and cheese sandwich with the sweet potato fries.  I liked the fries but found it odd that they served this sandwich on a round bun and half the meat fell out as soon as you picked it up.

The waiter was less than friendly, and the place itself is very cold and uninviting. That was truly the downfalls of this place. Also, its Cash Only! boo Foodwise- it was great. I had the truffle burger with gouda cheese and spicey fries. I really really did enjoy the food.

They were vaguely crispy on the outside, soft on the inside but not browned or caramelized anywhere to give them that extra depth of flavor- they were also dry! Not hard or uncooked, but dry on the outside. My burger was juicy and flavorful! and they have great cheddar cheese. spring mix was served with a basic balsamic which was lovely. Our waitress was a delight, but one of the guys working (yes working!) behind the bar seemed a little buzzed and was kinda disruptive.

Was expecting a very lively scene, what with the BYOB and all. This was not the case. Wasn't even mad about it.There was only one other party that showed up in the ~3 hours my friend and I spent at Juniper, and we ended up chatting with them briefly in our drunken stupor. (We asked about the the mac and cheese,  which looked oh-so-good, mind you.) Instead I had ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Wasn't even mad about it.The man and woman behind the counter, who I assume run the place, were super nice. We had initially sat down across from the bar, not knowing there was a backyard. The man chatted us up a bit, and we'd discovered there was an outside. We switched to the back after placing our dinner order, and cue the good times.The food came out in less than ten minutes, at which point we had gotten through our first glass of wine. Shortly after, the lovely owner came out to see how things were doing and we continued to chat with him for a bit. (If I had to guess it was until halfway through glass number three.) We spent about another hour in the yard just chatting, enjoying the good, calming vibes in the yard.All in all, a dinner to remember. Will definitely be back !",3,2,3

The burger comes with pickles and lettuce and a side of fries. I really liked the spicy fries. We enjoyed our meal inside but they have a nice outdoor patio area with cute picnic tables.

We both immediately acknowledged the local art on the walls, which gave the small dining area a unique vibe.Our servers were extremely nice, making recommendations across the menu and we settled on splitting the mussels, with a truffle burger for me and the BBQ rib sandwich for him.As soon as the mussels came out, we knew we had made the right decision. Piled eight inches high, the mussels were soaked in just the right amount of butter, white wine, and minced garlic. Even when the mussels and garlic bread were gone, we needed spoons to drink the remaining broth.My truffle burger was also a delightful surprise. Cooked just way I like it (medium rare), the burger exploded with juice upon biting. I got a slice of Gouda cheese with it, which provided a great smoky, creamy contrast to the beef. The accompanying spicy fries had the perfect amount of crisp without being too oily. All-in-all, a solid dish. Even though it wasn't what we were looking for, Juniper was a pleasant surprise that wouldn't have happened if we had stuck with our original plan.Dishes to try: truffle burger, musselsPros: BYO, helpful service, price, freshness of ingredientsCons: limited menu (predominantly burgers and sandwiches), cash only",4,2,3
76,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,7/3/2014,"Came here expecting the place to be super crowded, but it was fairly empty on a Saturday evening. A few of us had been day-drinking in Williamsburg, and we were looking for a good burger place, and Yelp came up with Juniper. We didn't realize it was BYOB and when the waiter told us, I quickly jumped up and ran to the nearest wine shop/bodega. Great decision. There is a liquor store right across the street and the bodega is a little further up the street, at the corner of the block. We were seated in the outdoor back patio. It wasn't very ornately decorated or anything, but I did really enjoy the backyard lounge feel. Started off with the chicken wings. Didn't like that there were only 7 wings per order, but the sauce was definitely better than most buffalo wing sauces I've tried in the city. It had a bit of thickness and texture to it, which again, is rare in the city. I ordered the chorizo burger, which had a bit of spice to it, which I loved. It was a little overdone, but the cheese helped mask the dryness. I did like that the burgers themselves were larger and came with all the fixings, which surprisingly doesn't always happen at burger joints. Came with a healthy portion of fries and you could pick regular, spicy, or sweet potato fries, which was pretty killer. Fries were cooked just right, and just the right thickness. Heh. I also tried my friend's slow cooked rib sandwich, and that was damn good. I'm a bit surprised that it wasn't busier, but I'm also cool with always being able to get a table. I'll definitely be back, mostly because of the laid-back atmosphere, BYOB, and delicious burgers.",1,,

Friends placed my order while I ran down to the nearby deli for a quick 6-pack. Order took way longer than expected (some people who sat later got their food first, so that was a bit annoying); luckily we had beer to keep us occupied. Settled on the truffle burger with gouda cheese and spicy fries ($15). Burger was thick and cooked well, though I wish I had added bacon to make it perfect. The fries indeed had a good kick, so I didn't have to add any ketchup/sauce.Food here is amazing but service is lacking (had to run down the waiter for the check).

The menu has a wide variety for pretty much anyone. I saw the pictures of the pulled pork on here and decided that's what I wanted. They ran out of regular and spicy fries so we had to get sweet potato. Eh. The pulled pork was delicious but didn't like the slight hint of spicy it had. The bun was super delicious. The sweet potato fries were crunchy but I just don't like sweet potato fries but if I did these would be good. My friend ordered the baked Mac and cheese and chicken fingers. Didn't try the Mac and cheese but he said it was pretty basic. It took about 40 min for them to make it, which is fine because it's fresh but needed maybe a bit more seasoning or some other ingredient. The chicken tenders were delicious. Nice and crunchy and the chicken is soft and moist. They just need to update their menu on their website so it's accurate. Wanted a grilled cheese but they changed their menu.",,,

I love the broth it came with cause I love dunking the bread into the flavorful broth. I also enjoyed their mac and cheese. Although not salty enough the mac n cheese held up based on its texture. I believe they put very fine breadcrumbs on top of their mac and cheese for an added crunch? Overall, a nice cozy place. The waiter was super duper nice.

Updated review","We've been coming back ever since we first found this gem 3 yrs ago. The food has never wavered in quality, presentation, or taste! From the burgers to the Cajun pasta, it's all delicious. I've tried everything on the menu -- so I know. But, what really makes Juniper so special, is the people who are here. The Owner (when he has time to break from creating the most tasty meals in the kitchen) comes out to chat with his patrons, really giving that at-home feeling that I've missed from home in the South. I've celebrated many occasions here and Juniper even closed the restaurant for me and my huge family to celebrate my graduation from medical school. Needless to say, we bring everyone who visits NYC here and many of them find their way back on their own.Housekeeping:- Cash only - But there is an ATM inside- BYOB - visit the wine shop on Berry street if you forget to bring your own.- And (as I said 3 yrs ago), Take a risk and try any of the southern dishes.. You can get a burger from anywhere (although they are delish here).",,,

Updated review","So I wondered back into Williamsburg and back into Juniper. This time around I tried the catfish sandwich with spicy fries. Was delighted to learn that the catfish was battered with rice panko which gives it an extra crunch.  The brioche bun seems to have been toasted with a hint of butter. Great freakin' idea!  That added more dimension to the sandwich. Mind you, you get two filets in the sandwich not just one. This may very well be my new favorite food. The spicy fries were tossed with Cajun seasoning, something I've never tried before. Both the spice and seasoning complemented each other with neither one overpowering the other. I'm really liking this place.",,,
100,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",350,204,9,5.0,10/13/2014,"Easily one of my favorite places in Williamsburg. This place wins for several reasons:1) BYOB ANDDD no corking fee2) Chorizo Burger. Trust. It's amazing, well cooked and seasoned, juicy. Pairs nicely with the sweet potato fries.It is *cash only* so keep that in mind. Cute little patio in the back. And everyone working there is above and beyond. They have a TV so you can come and watch football games. The mac & cheese looks really really good...but I can't speak on that....yet.",5,4,4
101,Michael L.,"New York, NY",349,4,0,5.0,6/2/2016,Ex paparazzi owner? Awesome and friendly. Best burger I've ever had. Food takes awhile to make but the quality is amazing! Super attentive staff and willing to adjust your food if not to your liking! Cute neighborhood as well. Bring cash!,,,
102,paulin h.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,32,0,5.0,7/2/2016,"Excellent food. The Cajun seafood pasta is awesome. The portion so huge that i saved half the bowl for lunch the next day. The other dishes were great too. The pulled pork sandwich was good and so was the fish and chips and bacon Mac n cheese.The owner is extremely friendly and nice. Upon seeing that our 2 kids were hungry and tired, they brought out fries for them first - on the house!The place is not very big, sitting wise. A few small tables inside, but they have a backyard with more sitting space. We sat in the backyard because it was spacious and airy.Will definitely return again. Highly recommended.",,,

The owner explained us how he searches for the meat and how he prepares the seasoning for it.Very good quality. A bit heavy for the garlic perhaps, but overall a very good experience!",,,
104,Ted C.,"Chicago, IL",389,1691,1757,4.0,11/16/2012,"We came here after coming from another restaurant nearby because of a pretty bad experience. The storefront looked pretty bare but we walked in where there was 1 table and our server behind the bar. Their menu was pretty simple but we ended up with the Jambalaya and Catfish sandwich with the spicy fries. The Jambalaya was had a ton of mussels and sausage, a couple of shakes of hot sauce and it was almost perfect. My girlfriend got the Catfish sandwich and she enjoyed it all, which was pretty gi-normous and came with a decent heap of fries. Fortunately, she couldn't finish but I was able to finish my Jambalaya and still make room for the leftover she had so I can honestly say that the catfish sammie and fries were definitely a good choice.Service wise there were no bumps. Our server went out of her way to find a bottle of ginger beer for me. She came by fairly regularly to check on us and the other table. The food takes a little while but I think it's because they have to work with  small kitchen.",1,1,1
105,Deano R.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,2,1,4.0,8/23/2015,Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Stopped at the store picked up a 6 pack because I read on yelp it was BYOB. No problem. Small menu but the food is amazing.  They have 3 burgers on the menu and I tried them all. Excellent. Mac n cheese on point. Fried shrimp great. Decor was plain but I was starving so I just wanted goodFood and that's what I got. Great place to go for lunch. I recommend for a stop and grab. Would return.,,,
106,Tammy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,30,1,5.0,3/16/2015,"Went to Juniper last night with a large group of friends (8 adults, plus my 2-year-old toddler) and had a phenomenal experience. It is now my new favorite spot in Williamsburg! First off, the food was unbelievably good. Gourmet comfort food in a cozy and unpretentious space. The burger was delicious and the sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp. Husband ordered a spicy Cajun pasta that was out of this world (my son tried some and even though it was too hot for him, he was still clamoring for more!) Another friend ordered what had to be the prettiest chicken pot pie I'd ever seen.Service was very warm and welcoming. The owner (at least I think it was him?) was  friendly and accommodating with our large party. He even went out of his way to make sure my son had everything he needed so we could enjoy our dinner. It's not always easy taking a toddler out to eat b/c they get restless, so I always appreciate when owners/waiters recognize this enough to make that extra effort. Not to mention, my kid enjoyed the food so much, he barely made a peep the entire night. Too busy shoveling food in his mouth.We will definitely be back (with or without the kid in tow!)",,,

Felt really rude and provinicial-y. Food was good though - service gave me good reason to seamless this place next time.",,,

110,Leila L.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,422,720,5.0,10/22/2014,"We're not sure why this place has not generated much more hype in Williamsburg than it currently does.  What an amazing restaurant!  The category of ""American"" and ""Burgers"" just do not give this restaurant enough credit.  Food is amazing!  We love flavor in our foods, spiciness, saltiness, fattiness, just a lot of flavor and Juniper does not disappoint.We ordered the special Jerk Wings and the Cajun Seafood Pasta with Andouille sausage.  Just a warning: these items are not for the light of heart, you better enjoy spiciness or you will be miserable.  With that said, the wings were amazingly moist on the insides and the flavor was wonderful.  Then 2 bites later, the wings' spiciness kicks in and you really wish you had some milk.  We followed the wings with the cajun seafood pasta.  The pasta was loaded with seafood in a red cajun sauce; there were mussels, shrimp, fish, calamari, and sausage all over a bed of linguine.  This, too, had a spicy kick but nothing like the jerk wings.  The dish itself is big enough to share between two light eaters.  Restaurant is BYOB and CASH ONLY, keep that in mind.  And I think because of these facts, they were able to keep the prices so low for the amount of food you get.  Definitely a recommended spot for dinner!",1,1,1
111,Damien P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,2,4.0,12/28/2014,"Burger and waiter was good. I enjoyed the fact that chorizo was already mixed with the steak. The bad point is we cant pay by credit card or apple-pay. Coins and bills are so annoying to carry...Also everytime the open the kitchen door, we could see the mess in the kitchen not totaly perfect clean. Please pay attention to details.

112,Jonathan S.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",26,18,12,4.0,3/12/2015,"I've been here about 3 times already and can not get enough of this place & every time I go I make sure I have something different. The food is unbelievably delicious, made fresh to order and never disappoints. The first time I tried the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was perfection. The second time I had the Mac & cheese with bacon and it is HEAVENLY. My third time around I encountered the truffle burger which was as delicious of a burger as I have ever had. The only draw backs are that the menu seems to be missing a few items, because I have seen people order things that I did not see on the menu & it's cash only. Oh and I forgotto mention that this great place is b.y.o.b. Other then that very small draw backs this place is amazing for a great meal. As long as juniper is around they will have a life long customer. My suggestion go as many times as you can and try something new because they will not disappoint.",,,
113,John G.,"Greenpoint, NY",18,19,0,3.0,10/22/2016,"I am giving this place three stars because it is just average. I ahd heard many good things about this place, so I decided to try. It is a small place that is cash only. It is also BYOB. I had the chorizo burger and the wings. The wings were good. The burger was good but not great.

115,Jason C.,"Queens, NY",225,131,39,4.0,1/30/2016,"Highly recommended. I went there last night with friends after my coworker recommended it. It's a small but cute restaurant and the place is crowded so you know it must be good. On a Friday night, we had to wait 40+ minutes for 4 but we left our number with one of the servers so that they can call us when the table was ready.We ended up going there prepared (the restaurant is BYOB with a corking fee of $5 per wine bottle) with two bottles of wine and as soon as we sat, they saw our cue and offered to open the bottles for us. The service was nice and efficient and our orders were -2 Truffle burgers - Recommended by the waitressBoth our burgers were ordered with smoked gouda and it was pretty damn delicious. It's basically a beef burger with portabello mushrooms on top and dressed with truffle oil. The seasoning was great and I thought the burger was juicy. It came with your choice of reg. fries, sweet potato fries or spicy fries. We got the spicy and they were nicely seasoned without it being too salty.Pulled pork sandwich My buddy had the pulled pork sandwich and he said it was great. As soon as it came, he was hands deep into the sandwich, with sauce all over his fingers but he clearly was enjoying it.Jambalaya The jambalaya was spicier than I anticipated but that's a good thing. It wasn't too dry and I'd have to say as good as the truffle burger was, this was better. It came with decent sized shrimp and mussels and I'd say the portion was pretty good. We didn't end up ordering any apps or desserts and the bill came out to somewhere around $85 for four people which is great. I know their prices were maybe a dollar or two more than other places because of the BYOB but considering we saved money on the drinks, I'm not complaining. And we were so satisfied I left overtipping. Definitely will try to go back when I can.",,,

Was drawn here due to the pictures of everyone's macaroni and did not leave disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and said it was very tangy and tasty.",,,
117,Adam P.,"Bayside, NY",1,27,0,4.0,1/8/2017,"Juniper is a tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant that sits on Berry Street in the middle of Williamsburg. Just a block from the L train, this cash-only eatery serves comfort food at its finest.It really is tiny, by the way. One waiter takes care of both front-of-house duties and orders, which does make your wait a little longer. The owner of the restaurant walks in and out, greeting each patron and asking how they like their food--a nice touch to an already intimate eating experience.Now onto the food! That's what really shines here. Wings, ribs, burgers, salads, and even mussels are all done expertly. As I said, there is always a wait, but it's completely worth it. The portions are absolutely humongous, even for the appetizers.The wings, which come in barbecue or hot, are some of the freshest, crispiest, most amazing wings I have ever had. I wish they gave a couple more pieces of celery, but the wings are so damn good that I didn't even mind.Their mini pork sliders are works of art. A soft bun cradles delicious pulled pork smothered in a complex barbecue sauce. The pork isn't just lumps of stewed meat--little crispy bits that give it an authentic pulled pork taste that I just haven't found anywhere else in New York. They're served with some acidic pickles, which cut through the richness of the sliders, creating a perfect balance of flavor.The truffle burger, which I had on my first visit, was also awesome and perfectly cooked. It was juicy, and the truffle flavor wasn't overpowering. The bun stood up to the tenderness of the burger and made for perfect bites. It was also huge and totally worth every penny.The rib sandwich was delicious, but I would not recommend getting it or the pulled pork sandwich after getting the pork sliders or barbecue wings. Although they taste amazing, these dishes do have a similar taste because of the barbecue sauce.The mussels are fresh and delicious, with no gritty sand or muddled flavors. Any seafood and shellfish lovers will also be satisfied by their shrimp and fish options.The only sour note that we hit in our two trips to Juniper was their Caesar Salad. It was messy with unappetizing chunks of cheese and little flavor. Stick to the other great options at Juniper.Juniper is a budget-friendly option for swanky Williamsburg that will stretch your waistline without stretching your budget. The food is delicious, and the portions are more than adequate. Unfortunately, they don't serve dessert, but thankfully, there are a myriad of great options in walking distance, such as Oddfellow's, which I've previously reviewed. Overall, Juniper is fantastic, and if you're a fan of barbecue, you should go there ASAP.",,,

Pros:1.  The fries.  Hot and cripsy, just the way I like my fries.  The spicy ones are great because they really have a kick to them.2.  Mac and Cheese - pretty delicious and the rice krispie like things on top gave the dish a nice texture.  The cheese was just the right amount of gooey.3.  The place was relatively empty on a Sunday afternoon so it was easy to have a relaxed group lunch.4.  BYOB.This place is decent, but Williamsburg is filled with cute lunch/dinner spots, so I probably wouldn't return here.",1,,1

Test 1: How to sit in their outdoor garden without burning, as only 1 table out of 5 had an umbrella. We kept shifting toward the restaurant and took turns in the sun. We got to be human sundials!Test 2: How to eat a pot of mussels without utensils. I learned something new. You use one half of the mussel to loosen up the meat on the other half, and then enjoy. (Truth be told, they were quite yummy). Test 3: How long can you go without laughing at the granny panties hanging on the drying line of the apartment next door? Test 4: How long do we have to wait? Answer: forever o'clock. Our truffle burgers were okay; juicy but lacking in flavor. Fries were crispy and savory.

A small space with a few tables and bar counter. Some strange art on the walls and a few of the pictures look like your colleagues painted them in one of those paint and wine workshops. That's not why you came here though...you came for whatever is coming out of that small kitchen door in the back. For whatever juniper lacks in appearance they make up for it in the kitchen. Everything is delicious but for me the burger is the winner. Nothing fancy, just good quality ingredients to make some awesome burgers.

My boyfrind ordered the best fish and chips I've ever had. The fish melts in your mouth, and the spicy fries are great. Both dishes washed down with Boylan's soda were excellent. Service here is an enthusiastic four thumbs up. We were greeted at the door, quickly seated and served water. The server juggled the entire room efficiently and we were asked by three different people if everything was to our liking. Anyway, I'm really impressed.",1,1,1
140,Anthony S.,"New York, NY",60,25,14,3.0,8/4/2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was during my first time here that I had to return. The menu is limited and has a subtle New Orleans feel, but everything I've tried has been extremely good. Although the fish sandwich is a must if you like fish sandwiches, I went with the pull pork sandwich because the sliders were amazing.     Oh yeah the BBQ wings are terrific!",,,
141,Chun M.,"Queens, New York, NY",726,557,6156,5.0,8/3/2013,"Walking into Juniper, I was taken aback by how small it is with limited seating in the front.  We must have hit it just right, being seated immediately, because people started rolling in in droves, each carrying a bottle of wine or six pack of beer.  Did I mention it's BYOB?  There must be a black hole through the kitchen because a whole slew of people went through there.  Apparently there's some nice garden seating out the back.DO NOT call this diner food.  This is comfort food at it's best.  Tom, the chef & owner serves up some of the most amazing dishes from an albeit limited menu, but makes each dish his own and with a lotta love & care.  To say that the menu is eclectic is an understatement.  It is a true American melting pot from all over the country with the chef adding his signature, accents & spins on classics.  He even made it a point to come out during a lull in the kitchen to greet his guests and make sure everybody liked their food.We started with the (mmmmm) catfish poppers & mussels w/wine, garlic & shallots.  The mussels were on the small side, but went really well with the shallots on top of crustini.  The broth of the mussels was so good, we were using the half shells as spoons and drinking it as soup!  I really couldn't decide on an entree because I wanted to try everything from the Truffle burger to the Jambalaya.  I decided to lay off the meat and go with the Linguini & Shrimp, which at $15 was the most expensive dish on the menu (along with the Jambalaya), super bargains.  It came with 7 colossal shrimp in a similar broth as the mussels but with parmesan cheese for added depth.  The rest of the family had Pulled Pork & Catfish sandwiches & the Jambalaya.  We even shared a huge green salad to add some roughage in there.  We saw the mac & cheese at the next table and it was HUGE!  We'll have to try that next time.When Peter D gives it 5 stars, you better well show up there with your cash in hand.  Oh and it is cash only.",6,5,7
142,Sean D.,"Malverne, NY",87,48,4,2.0,3/28/2015,"I'm mixed about this place because the food was very good, but a series of unfortunate events occurred which scarred me from liking this place.At first, the decor of the place seemed kind of ""industrial"", but maybe it was actually just junky and cheap since the chairs do not seem to be of high quality (more about that later on).I got the jambalaya and mac and cheese (both which were phenomenal), but halfway through my meal, the chair I was sitting in caved in from underneath me. It felt like everything happened in slow motion, and the next thing I know, I'm laying on my back on the floor. Not only was my fall slightly painful, but it was also obviously embarrassing. Now I would understand if I were morbidly obese, but I'm only 150 pounds. 150 pound people shouldn't be breaking chairs! Due to this unfortunate experience, I am slightly hesitant of sitting in rickety wooden chairs now.Later in my meal, I found a piece of plastic in my Mac & Cheese, but I didn't want to make a scene because I honestly just wanted to get out of the place. The Mac & Cheese was excellent, but I am not a big fan of hard plastic in my food.The most disappointing thing about this entire experience was that the owner charged me full price for the meal. I should have moaned and groaned in pain on the floor a little bit instead of hopping back up right away. I think after everything that occurred, they could have at least put the meal on them. It seems like they cared more about their profits than the customer.Ah well, I guess.",5,1,

There is a great little wine store across the street and slightly north up the block where you have an amazing selection of good and reasonably priced wine ($8 and up) from all over the world. I wish I could BYOB everywhere because NYC drink prices are a joooke. (a glass of wine costs more than a bottle of the same caliber when bought at a restaurant or bar vs a liqour store)When you combine excellent burgers and BYOB with a wine store half a block away, you get perfection. :))))When you combine",1,,

148,Nicolette T.,"Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY",7,56,113,3.0,6/7/2014,"Don't really understand the hype about this place. The outdoor seating is a plus, but the decor is just kind of blah. I didn't find the staff to be friendly, they seemed bothered and rushed and more interested in constantly smoking cigarettes out in front than tending to their customers. Food took a bit long to come out and it would be nice if they took credit card and if they also had a drink menu as well - that would probably bump up the experience a bit for me. The fries were a disappointment. Definitely not handcut and the sweet potato fries got cold in a second. The pulled pork sandwich and the rib sandwich were very good, though, as well as the mac and cheese but nothing outstanding - I've definitely had better, but it's a decent place to come to if you're looking for a ""quick"" bite to eat. I wouldn't come back here, but I wouldn't NOT recommend it anybody. It's more of just an ""eh.""",,,
149,Scott M.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",39,25,24,5.0,1/26/2014,Been to Juniper more than 10 times. Excellent burger. Excellent spicy fries. Cash only but it's also BYOB which is a total win. Had the catfish sandwich last night. Batter is very light. 2 large pieces of catfish. My wife had the truffle burger (I had half of that as well) and that was slamming too. The chef came by and recommended the rib sandwich which I didnt see on the menu. Actually considering heading over for lunch today. With tip our bill was around $40. Love this spot!,,1,
150,Caroline D.,"Brooklyn, NY",654,430,26,4.0,2/14/2016,"This is a cozy, no-nonsense home cookin joint. We came in on one of the coldest days thus winter to get some comfort food. Had the Mac and cheese - probably one of the best I've had. Firm rotini spirals with creamy yellow cheese in a single casserole pot/skillet and crispy rice crisps on top, bubbling as it arrived to our table. We brought some nice cold beers to compliment and cut through the richness ($1 corking fee for each). Also shared the catfish sandwich with spicy fries on the side. Nice moist fish, tarter sauce, and some little-less-than-fresh shredded lettuce on a buttered/toasted bun. Spicy fries were perfect, super crispy and just the right amount of spice to pair with the savory sandwich. It was a lot of food to just split between two people, very filling and a little unhealthy. If that's what you're going for, definitely come here, but don't come without getting the Mac and cheese. Service is a little slow but only because they make your food fresh to order. Very friendly staff, love this place - no frills and no B.S. Highly recommended!",3,,1

We had the burgers at the friendly server's suggestion, and we shared a bowl of delicious baked mac'n'cheese, made with the spiral noodles!

154,Greenpointguy P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,23,0,2.0,2/27/2016,"Not impressed- brought some friends here because Juniper was rumored to have a great burger- but this item was definitely a let down; somehow it was simultaneously too greasy and too dry (truly an amazing feat). Not only that, but the food took forever  (in a totally empty restaurant on a Friday night), it was cash only (annoying) and a there was some absurd corking fee (really annoying). On the bright side- the wings were decent and the servers were really nice.

We come on a whim to the restaurant so we didn't come prepared  but good thing there is a liquor store across the street (not much variety). We had amazing service from Rafael who works there.  While he wasn't our waiter but he always went out of his way to make sure we always had water . That really establishes superb service.  We only saw our waitress once when she took the order. I hope Rafael got the full tip. Would definitely come again! Thanks Rafael for making the experience even better.,,,
157,Miyuki I.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",2,5,3,5.0,4/4/2016,"My boyfriend and I decided to try Juniper after reading such positive reviews, and now I get to add my own positive review! We were able to choose our table since it wasn't crowded at the time of our arrival. The menu was short and sweet, but everything sounded so appealing. We decided to get the Pulled Pork Sliders as an appetizer. I would say that appetizer is meant for 2 people since they serve 2 sliders, which is something to consider. However, they were delicious: very flavorful with the perfect pork-to-sauce ratio (personally, I do not like overly-saucy pulled pork). The sliders were accompanied by tiny potato fries. For lack of a better description, they resembled little matchsticks with a potato chip feel. For entrees, my boyfriend and I ordered the Chorizo Burger paired with Spicy Fries and the Cajon Seafood Pasta, respectfully. Being a fan or chorizo, the boyfriend appreciated his burger (""it was cooked to medium-well perfection""). The fries were awesome - I highly highly recommend those. The pasta was exceptional; I loved the sheer amount of seafood in the pasta sauce. They are really generous in that department, and equally generous in the department of flavor. (Side tip: Dip the fries in the pasta sauce.) We were very full after our dinner.Service was what I expected for 1 person to be working alone that night. The place got really crowded when we received our main dishes, so it made sense that it would be harder to flag down the single waitress in the restaurant. The poor girl was running in and out of the kitchen constantly with barely any time for a breather. Other than that, service was very fair.",1,,

163,Suzie S.,"Franklin Square, NY",14,29,45,4.0,4/27/2015,"This place was a great find, my friend and i were looking for something to eat at quickly before heading out to Viva Toro. I yelped and out popped Juniper.It's very old fashioned inside, its kind of like going into someones old home. Lol. It seemed cozy enough though, the chairs were uncomfortable as hell, but i wasnt going there to relax, i came to eat. Its BYOB, wish i knew before i came there.  The staff are friendly, they take CASH only, and they use a GINORMOUS old fashioned cash register. They do have an ATM machine inside in case you forget to bring cash.FOOD:As an appetizer, we had the fried shrimp. It was breaded nicely.  The shrimp was pretty jumbo and they give you a pretty good amount. It came with like a sweet/spicy sauce which went well with the shrimp. Shrimp was nice and crispy. I cant wait to try their catfish balls!I'm a hamburger fiend, so i got the Chorizo Burger with cheddar cheese and the spicy fries.  I kid you not when i say, BEST burger i have ever had. Oh so perfectly juicy, perfect size, the brioche bun went oh so well with it. I have been looking for a new burger spot for awhile now, and i'm glad i found Juniper! Spicy fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned very well.  Just the right amount of spice.  They were basically cajun fries.  And it came with this spicy mayo concoction that went fantastic with my brioche bun. My friend got the truffle burger with american cheese and sweet potato fries, i didnt get to taste her burger but it looked delish and she thought it was pretty delicious too. I did however, have some of her fries. Normally, when i order sweet potato fries, they are not usually crispy, but these were perfect! They were basically shoestring sweet potato fries. Awesome!Overall, i would definitely come back here for the food, and BMOB (bring my own beer) Lol. Also, i knocked off 1 star because the place could use an upgrade, but i guess that's how they want it to look. Who cares though cause the food was bomb!",,,

First off the place is really quint and homey just how I like it; anyway we started with the apps We ordered the pulled pork sliders and bbq wings which was amazing I mean everything was so fresh and well seasoned. Now for our mains we all ordered the grilled beef burger which were the bomb like seriously the burger itself was like the size of my face and they served it on a toasted brioche bun my favorite!!!!! Overall juniper will be seeing me a lot this summer,,,

As are the burgers and chicken sandwiches- they also have the best season fries in the 'hood- everything we've tried here is delicious though.  You can tell the kitchen really cares.  A no frills joint with great service and it's byob as a bonus!  Don't be fooled by all the other lame copy cat eating options in the surrounding neighborhood serving the same thing with robot wait staffs- just come here and enjoy a great friendly all around dinning experience- you won't regret it!,,,

Will def be back~~Not sure if the guy working there was the owner or manager but regardless, he was awesome. Honestly!! In an area where everyone feels so entitled (for who knows what reason), this place makes you feel like you are at home.

Whenever a restaurant adds spices to a burger, they are trying to cover up that they use cheap beef.To make matters worse, we waited for almost 20 minutes just to get a check. The staff was friendly but too focused on talking with their friends outside then dealing with their customers. The decor inside is not very nice either, very messy behind the counter, makes you think what state the kitchen is in. I wouldn't recommend Juniper to anyone, stay away.",2,1,

It can get a little tight, but it's still comfortable. The old fashioned big metal cash register is an interesting touch as well.The staff is great and super friendly from the owner, who comes out of the back to have a friendly conversation with you, to the young kid who waits on the tables. I always try to give the kid a decent tip because he seems like a great kid.They have a place to sit out in the back during the spring and summer and it's a great place for some fresh air and conversation with your friends while you eat and drink.They have a BYOB (bring your own beer) policy and will chill it for you and serve it to you.The last time my friends and I went there was maybe a month ago and we ordered appetizers and brought a couple of six packs of beer with us. We had to leave after the appetizers to catch a UFC fight on PPV and they actually held our beer for us until we came back like an hour or two later. They have great American style food that isn't too expensive either. My friends usually get the Jambalaya and Mac & Cheese and swear by them. I'm more of a burger type guy. The first time I went there I had the Truffle Burger with fries and it was pretty delicious. One time I also had the Shrimp Salad and it was pretty good.

In a neighborhood where even the street vendors have hype, juniper is modest and unpretentious, as if it is unaware of the madness going on all around it. This is a place where locals, scruffy hipsters and inebriated old timers alike, can camp out with their byo tallboy and not be bothered on a Saturday. I got a pulled pork sandwich with spicy fries. The servings are huuuuuge, so my sandwich came overstuffed with juicy barbecue-saucy meat and a pile of hot, crispy, just-made french fries coated in Cajun seasoning. The flavor of the pork was right on, not too spicy, a hint of sweetness and vinegar. A little coleslaw would have been welcome though, just to break up the grease-party a bit. I also got a sneak peek of some other dishes and everything looked great. As a rule I had been wary of this 'hood on the weekends, but I could see juniper becoming a go-to spot.",1,,
180,Ritesh G.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,40,4,5.0,9/1/2014,"If there were more than 5 stars available, this place would have that. Went last night. Had the burger. This has to go on the Best Burger List for NYC. Not for Brooklyn. For the entire friggin city.Ordered the Truffle Burger and added Gouda and Bacon (cause let's face it, you have to have bacon on a burger). This was such a juicy burger, it soaked the bottom of the bun. It was out of this world good. No ketchup was needed. This place is immediately on my list of best burgers in the city. Little Owl, Minetta, JG Melon, Royale, Juniper. No order in particular, but Juniper is that good. My girlfriend wanted to try the mac and cheese, had a bite. Wow. They warned us it was going to take 25 minutes from the time we ordered for all the food because they make the mac and cheese from scratch. It tasted like home mad mac and cheese. It was fantastic. This place is BYOB, which is an added bonus. There's a wine shop across the street where we got wine from. We still haven't tried the Jambalaya or the seafood, that's next up though. To top it off, the owner came by and say hi at the end (he was in the kitchen before). We told him how good the food was and he was so nice and gracious. He talked about the BYOB and that he does this vs having a liquor license so he can keep the prices down. What more can you ask for than someone who cares about his business and his customers. A must-stop in Williamsburg",2,,
181,Marc H.,"Brooklyn, NY",192,20,9,5.0,8/20/2014,"Been here a few times now and I will still keep coming back. The food is good if you're looking for filling and savoury. The portions are generous for what you pay. It's BYOB, which means your tab will not exponentially grow. The service is not really something to make a big fuss about. This is a very laid back place run a by people who may not have strong background in hospitality, but want to offer fun comfort food with affordable prices in a not so affordable neighbourhood. I really liked either their Truffle burger or Chorizo burger. Their wings are really good too. Don't come here with expectations of a full-service restaurant with well tailored customer service. Just lay back, relax, have fun, and enjoy the food!",2,,

The fries are so good. I got Cajun spice fries and they were super amazing. The baked Mac and cheese is the best one I ever had. It was delicious. The food is made to order so you have to wait a little but its worth the wait!! It is freshly prepared and tastes amazing. It is my go to place for fish and chips. Restaurant is rustic and had a small town feel to it. Owner and the staff are super friendly. It is one of my favorite places!,,,
183,Ilker D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,1,1.0,11/13/2016,"Even tough the place was not packed, they kept us waiting for 40 mins after we ordered and started to serve customers who were seated after us. No apologies were made. We haded to leave without eating, or we were going to wait even more and watch people eat and finish their food. Will never be back again...",1,,
184,Kirsy P.,"West Bronx, NY",6,4,11,1.0,12/8/2015,"I was really excited to try this place out. My friend gave me a few suggestions in the neighborhood that we could go to dinner for and this was one that really stood out. The reviews seem great, the food menu was mouth watering, and the decor was perfectly intimate and cozy, needless to say I was very excited about coming here for dinner. As I walked up to the location a few minutes earlier than we planned I noticed the front sign said ""cash only"" so I walked over to the Duane Reade in the area and got some cash, I didn't want anything to get in the way of what I was already anticipating to be a great night of good food and company. When I walked in the waitress/bartender was busy talking to someone so I just motion to her and asked if I could sit anywhere, she nodded her head yes so I proceeded to sit on the right corner table. Even though it was just two of us the restaurant was fairly empty except for another group of diners in the other corner. When my friend finally arrived we started to combover the menu to finalize what we were going to eat. A group of 5 walked in as we were about to order and asked the waitress if they had room for them and she came over and asked us if we mind if she moved us and I said YES and she proceeded to just say well they're a bigger group and you have to move. Mind you the group said it was fine if they sat at another pair of tables that all they had to do was put together, but the waitress was still insisting we move. At that point I didn't want to cause a scene and was too annoyed to even bother eating here. What a disappointment..",,1,
185,Amanda A.,"Woodhaven, Queens, NY",49,2,3,5.0,5/17/2016,This place is awesome! It's BYOB with only a $5 corkage fee. Small and chill spot for anyone who's looking to relax and eat with their own beer/wine. Not much on the menu but the food was great! I had a pulled pork sandwich (a little spicy btw) and my boyfriend had a mac n cheese bowl. The sandwich w/ fries was $13 and the Mac n cheese bowl was $10. So it wasn't pricy at all. I will definitely be returning.,,,
186,Danielle R.,"San Diego, CA",918,802,775,5.0,8/20/2012,"I loved it here!  This is a nice close knit group of people running this business and they show how much they care.  The cook came out and talked to make customers and made sure they all loved their food... Which I did. I got the steak and cheese sandwich.  It was huge!!! and delicious.  I also got the spicy fries which were also good but, they are spicy as their name says, not just spiced.  My husband got a burger and said it was very good as well and he devoured it.  We also got chicken tenders as an appetizer to split.  They were very crunchy and moist.  The servings here are large and you will not leave hungry.  They recently started selling alcoholic beverages but they still do not take credit, cash only.",1,1,
187,D F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,5,5.0,4/26/2016,"I love this place. Juniper is casual and laid back. Brought all my friends visiting from abroad here, who wanted to try comfort food. I would recommend the pulled pork, jambalaya , seafood pasta , and Mac and Cheese. Also it's BYOB!",,,
188,Will N.,"Augusta, ME",0,3,0,5.0,6/1/2016,The food was incredible. The seating in the garden give it a great setting. The people who work there were very nice. I'd go back in a heartbeat.,,,
189,Kelly C.,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",0,6,14,4.0,4/20/2016,"Good service, good food, well priced. My partner and I walked in here around 8:30 pm on a saturday and were sat right away. The Jumbalaya, catfish poppers and portabella sandwich were all top notch. Will def go back.",,,
190,Malik C.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",3,4,1,2.0,4/2/2012,"Ok....first off, this restaurant is HALF a step away from a fast food burger chain. I just so happen to be in the area looking for a good burger joint for me and my gf to eat at. I checked yelp and saw all these great reviews and decided to check it out. Upon arrival I knew that I was duped by my fellow yelp citizens. As I sat down and gazed at the menu I was distracted by the overwhelming cold draft of air that was circulating around the room. THE ABSCENSE of heat really made it hard for me and my company to enjoy ourselves. The shorten this review I have decided to take a bullet style approach :Cons--No Heat-High School Cafe Menu-I tried to order hot wings as an appetizer and was told they ""RAN OUT""..(really    though!!)-I Asked for a Sierra Mist and they gave me 75 cent can of Sierra Mist!!! lol -Fries were tooo salty -Cash Only Pros-Mussels were excellent and tasty-Burger was decent although they overpowered the burger I ordered by putting too much gorgonzola cheese. ( must be careful with that type of cheese!)- Fries were too- The chef actually delivered the food and asked how everything was at the end of the meal! REAL CLASSY IMO.Only recommend this spot for people looking for a quick quick meal. Without the service of selling mussels this place is looked at in my eyes as a half a step above in quality than five guys",2,1,2
191,Jonathan K.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",81,27,5,5.0,4/18/2014,"My friend brought me here on recommendation from her friend. It was supposed to be a delicious burger.So, I tried the classic bacon cheeseburger. I must say, it was one of the best burgers, if not the best, I ever had. The meat was perfectly flavored, and my medium rare burger was juicy, but not so juicy as to sog up and make the bun collapse. I took the sweet potato fries along with that, and the chef here makes sure they taste like sweet potato. No worry that you'll order sweet potato fries and get a bland, soggy, orange french fry.I was here on a Tuesday night, and it was empty.",2,,1
192,Mea H.,"San Francisco, CA",86,198,28,5.0,1/23/2014,"Oh hell yes. Not only did I have one of the best burgers I've ever eaten IN MY LIFE, the chef and server were so nice that we were basically friends at the end of the meal.When my friend suggested this spot, I almost protested because it is three things that I don't love: it's in Williamsburg (so hard to get to from Crown Heights), it's cash-only, and it's BYOB. I am so glad I did not protest. What a gem! What a treat! I had the truffle burger, which was just the most perfectly medium-cooked patty, topped with sauteed portobello slices and drizzled in truffle oil. I almost have truffle fatigue at this point, but the craftsmanship of this burger made this flavor combination seem as fresh as the first time I tried it. Tom the cook and Raphael the server are great people. Raphael was super friendly and was joking around with us within a few minutes, and Tom came out from the kitchen to chat about the restaurant business and the changing neighborhood. We had the best time. Krystal, I'll never doubt you again. You pick all the places we go from now on.",10,6,7
193,Jenny M.,"Miami, FL",24,7,10,4.0,1/27/2015,"Nice spot in Williamsburg. Pretty small just a couple tables & a bar area. We got the pulled pork sandwich & the chicken tenders. The pulled pork was great! Soo tender & just the right amount of sauce. The spicy fries are basically Cajun fries, not overly seasoned they were just perfect. Staff was very nice. Cash only!",,,
194,Telemak K.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3,6,0,1.0,7/3/2015,This is my first food review. I felt compelled to write because of how awful our experience was. The food was average for the price. My ribs special was overpriced for the value and taste. I asked for barbecue sauce because it was lacking taste and it  was never delivered. Same for the truffle burger and the seafood pasta was way too spicy. The worst part of our experience was the service. We waited over an hour to get our food and we weren't alone. Another customer also complained in front of us. The waitress never even checked to see how we were doing. Very poor service.I wouldn't recommend this place.,2,1,1
195,Krystal S.,"Bushwick, NY",3,2,1,5.0,1/9/2015,"This place was a first for my boyfriend, and I, and to be honest we were both blown away by how amazingly well seasoned the food was. This place was actually discovered here on Yelp, and we decided to give it a try, on a whim, based on all of the amazing reviews. I've gotta tell ya, we made the right decision!! On top of that, the staff was so very sweet, and accommodating, which is a rarity in NYC... Especially in Brooklyn, NY! Btw, we ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, (Which came with incredibly yummy sweet potato fries), and a dish of their Mac & Cheese, with bacon, (Huge Portion!+ Oh so creamy!!). We look forward to having the leftovers for brunch tomorrow! Highly recommended!",,,
196,Max P.,"Manhattan, NY",29,1,0,1.0,5/20/2016,"Their BBQ wings and Mac n Cheese was one of the worst meals I've had in NYC. Mac n Cheese was overcooked for which all they had to say was ""sorry"". The wings were covered in so much BBQ sauce that I could barely tell there's chicken under there - I could've just had the sauce straight from the bottle instead. Can't understand why they have four stars, I certainly won't be coming back.",,,
197,Alice M.,"New York, NY",114,154,129,4.0,11/1/2014,Get that spicy fries coated with canjun spicky goodness! The pulled pork sandwich was OK but the roasted bun was superb!  I tasted the Mac and cheese and that is a def must order from the menu. This place is cash only though so that's just an fyu,,,
198,Irina K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,29,14,5.0,4/27/2016,"Had the truffle burger which was amazing! And we got to sit in the backyard which was so nice on a warm day. My friend got the Caesar salad, must admit the dressing had a little too much Anchovy paste- but I love that, others might not so beware.",,,
199,Marco C.,"Naples, Italy",181,51,12,4.0,4/26/2014,"If I could choose the way to die, I would probably opt for a heart attack after the pulled pork sandwich and the sweet potato fries at this place. I have been blessed by living across the street of this cozy, unpretentious restaurant that features very good food, kind management and fine art hanging on the walls. One star less because it's only cash.",1,1,
