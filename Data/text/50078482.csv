0,Richard C.,"New York, NY",0,3,0.0,5.0,10/7/2018,"The food here is phenomenal. I get takeout from from here multiple times a week. Pretty much everything I have tried on the menu has been very good - I would especially recommend the porchetta, corned beef, cobb salad, and the chicken pot pie soup.Only drawback I've experienced is that delivery can sometimes take a very long time, especially during prime lunch and dinner hours. It would be wise to pickup from the restaurant instead when possible.",,,
1,Richard P.,"San Antonio, TX",30,1,0.0,5.0,11/7/2018,"Awesome food, will come again when I'm in area. Had the chicken pot pie soup... loved it. Also had the lamb sandwich.... I could eat here every time I'm in the area.Reasonable prices, nice staff, clean and tidy kitchen.",,,
2,Anthony D.,"Roselle, NJ",17,17,14,2.0,10/1/2018,"The food here is way over priced for what they give you.  It's delicious, but was expecting way more.  I got a lunch special and had to pay more to get au jus.  I'm sorry, but you can't call yourselves ""Au Jus"" and then charge extra to get it!!! The sandwiches are super small, you can finish it in a few bites.  They are very delicious but the side I got, potatoes, were soggy and unflavorful.  11 bucks for a tiny sandwich and mediocre potatoes can be better spent elsewhere.",2,,
3,Victoria W.,"New York, NY",0,7,1,5.0,11/2/2018,"Au Jus has very healthy, flavorful, and affordable food. My first time having their delicious food that arrived extremely quickly, and I will return weekly. I'm vegetarian, and it is difficult to find vegan soups, the lentil soup is amazing!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED A+++++",,,
4,Denay W.,"New York, NY",308,226,736,5.0,11/8/2017,"Such a high quality sandwich delivered right to my door! I can't say much about the storefront, but I definitely want to stop by having tried their food. From what I do know, the restaurant is rather small with a few tables, so depending on how busy they are, delivery or takeout may be the way to go anyway.Being called Au Jus, I just had to try their Roasted Beef Au Jus sandwich! It was everything I hoped for and more. The sandwich itself was a great size and was packed with a good amount of incredibly juicy beef. The baguette in which the sandwich was served on was just soft enough to really absorb the juices, but not be a pile of mush. I truly enjoyed getting to dip this great sandwich into the delicious Au Jus sauce and get the full flavor experience.Will be eating there again very soon!",3,1,1
5,Christian H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,3,5.0,10/20/2018,Came in here for some soup they have many options small store great staff amazing lentil soup and white bean soup. Sandwiches look amazing as well,,,
6,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,4.0,7/14/2017,"Definitely come here for the meat! I treated myself to the roast beef platter because I just can't resist meat. The platter comes with 2 sides and some bread. I got a side of white bean and sage raisin stuffing. I found the white beans to be quite bland, not worth trying. As for the sage raison stuffing, it was filling and had a sweetness to it from the raisin. It was nicely seasoned and paired well with the roast beef. As for the roast beef, I annihilated all of it. It was super moist, perfectly tender, full of juicy beef flavor. Really delicious. Next time I would just opt for the sandwich because just the meat and bread is all that is needed. Really well made.",10,5,7
7,Manny C.,"Stroudsburg, PA",37,5,0,4.0,10/16/2018,"Good selection and variety of delicious dinners and sandwiches. The porchetta was especially yummy. Green bean side was good.

I got the lunch special sandwich and soup combo with the chicken pot pie soup and the portobello sandwich. Soup was filled with veggies, chicken and potatoes - so hearty and delicious. The sandwich was really flavorful with the pesto, onions and cheese. Will definitely be ordering from here again. Such great food for an affordable price. New fav neighborhood spot!",,,

11,Ian G.,"Lakewood, CO",327,100,43,5.0,6/20/2017,"You will not find any place like this. It's takeout (or dine in with only a few seats available) but it's absolutely phenomenal takeout. Simply an irreplaceable spot on the UES.While although the menu might be a couple bucks more than a cheap meal it's totally worth it. Especially considering the amount of food you get for the price.The roast leg of lamb is my favorite and no matter what you get, you have to go with the platter because you get 2 sides for only another 3 bucks. Another favorite is the chicken pot pie soup. It's to die for. The owners are such great people too and extremely warm and welcoming. From France too!Overall just an awesome little spot that is that ""hole in the wall"" place that surprisingly not that many people I've talked to have heard about. Will continue to return and absolutely recommend to anyone.",2,,1
12,Candi H.,"Athens, GA",41,14,0,5.0,7/25/2018,Yummy yummy yummy.   I wish I had received more au jus for my sandwich.  LOL.  It was so good and they arrived about 15 minutes earlier than expected.  It was super hot and fresh and the chocolate cake wasn't bad either.,,,
13,Dario K.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,5.0,9/23/2018,This is one of my favorite places in the UES for take-out/delivery. Everything that I tried tasted really good and fresh. The roasted chicken and the lamb platter are delicious!,,,
14,LaToya D.,"New York, NY",18,20,7,4.0,6/19/2018,Bland but good textures and base flavors. I had lentil soup and porchetta sandwich at lunch special. Good value. Bring your own salt n pepper if you like a little bit more flavor.,,,
15,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1144,813,4.0,9/11/2016,"Au Jus/awwwwwww yiisssssss/Adjective - (of meat) with its own natural juices from cookingSynonyms -lit, bomb, crackI've had his spot bookmarked on Yelp for the longest time, and Friday was a rare day where I did not pack a lunch, so I decided to wander out (yes, even in the crazy humidity) to get myself a sandwich from Au Jus.I chose the porchetta sandwich, although there was also the option to get it on a platter, and did not regret it one bit! It was messy to eat on a park bench (the seating inside was limited), especially with the little container of *HOT* meat juice and the balancing that was required to keep it from spilling, but it was well worth it. By the way, don't waste a drop of that juice! It is delicious and perfect for dipping the sandwich in..or just dousing on your sandwich...which is what I ended up doing.. Anyway, it definitely hit the spot, and half a sandwich was enough to tide me over until dinner! I do wish that there was something more to the sandwich than just meat and bread though. I would have felt a little less guilty for indulging in a 13+ dollar meal for lunch. :P Service is fast and friendly, definitely a great place to stop by for lunch if you are in the area!",4,1,2
16,Imani H.,"New York, NY",358,125,172,5.0,6/18/2017,"Love love love this place! I got the ritz Cobb salad with ginger sesame dressing and it was so yummy, one of the best salads I've ever had! My bf got the leg of lamb salad and enjoyed it too! They also have tons of cake and cookies that looked really good also. It's a small place so I think most people take the food to go, but there are a few high chairs to sit at if you want to stay tho! Will definitely go back!",,,
17,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",961,975,2708,4.0,6/27/2016,"It's a nice little neighborhood joint. There is not much seating inside, basically just a counter with a few seats, I think most people do delivery. I think this place has some really good artisanal sandwiches, a bit on the pricey side but still good non the less. The shop is small but the staff is super friendly and welcoming. I really left thinking wow, the service here was great and it wasn't even waiter service. I only finished half my sandwich and I was perfectly content with just putting the other half in a to go bag and leaving it in the wax paper. No, the guy behind the counter rewraps my half sandwich in aluminum foil! For me, I really appreciate going the extra step. It seems so small but I really appreciated the gesture.The food:Porchetta- 5 hour Italian-style herbed roast pork served with au jus on a Rosemary Ciabatta. I really liked the porchetta a lot. There was a nice herb mix to the pork and the pork was so nice, juicy and tender. The Ciabatta was a really good bread since it had a nice texture and I liked how it didn't fall apart especially with the dip of the au jus. The au jus gave a little extra flavor without being greasy and it added a nice layer of moistness. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Sacramento Rancher- Certified choice roast beef, smoked bacon, ripe avocado, cucumber slices, lettuce and house-made horseradish cream sauce on a roll. On paper, it sounds like a homerun but the roast beef didn't have a lot of flavor, I couldn't taste the horseradish cream at all and the bread was really difficult to eat. The bread was large, hard and kept squeezing all the ingredients out from the other end. I also didn't care for the cucumbers, I don't think it added anything at all. On the bright side, the bacon was great, it was super bacon-y and crunchy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Roasted Red Bliss Potatoes- The potatoes were good, they kinda felt like baked potatoes with a crust but $5 is pricey.",12,11,12

28,Anne S.,"San Francisco, CA",143,237,26,3.0,6/4/2017,"We got take out from here so disclaimer I have no idea about ambiance and the service. The food sounded good. I got Portobello sandwich. It was not that good. There was just too much going on. It was big and fell apart quickly. The sauce was over powering. The portobello was under cooked. I'm a big Portobello fan and was disappointed. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich and that was moist and juicy and super flavorful. I have never had such good roast beef actually inmy life. It was like steak in delicious thin slices. If you get food from here, don't go for the vegetarian option. Go for what they do best.",,,
29,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3285,12680,4.0,6/4/2015,"This tiny little spot off of 1st Avenue and 91st street serves up some surprisingly delicious roast beef!Small menu of items to choose from but everything I have had here is really good.The roast beef sandwich au jus is just a dippers delight! Tasty slow roasted beef, soft bread with a crispy outer surface, and flavorful juice to dip it into. One of the best sandwiches around these parts.This place is solid. The owner is usually there and talking to him he seems to really care about the product. In fact, he talked me into trying out his sauteed kale and I liked it so much I added it to my roast beef platter meal that day. I normally hate kale!If you can swing lunch here from 11-4 get the sandwich special - you can choose from porchetta, lamb, beef or mushroom. Served on a medium-sized brioche roll. Comes with your choice of roasted red bliss potatoes or homemade coleslaw, and a drink. It's a deal for $7.95. Great to grab and go as it's not really a place to sit down and dine at. For some it might be a bit pricey but the quality is there. Just do it!Love that the UES/Yorkville has some of these newer specialty food places taking a chance up here. Not many spots like this anywhere in Manhattan with this kind of menu.",13,11,11
30,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,11/19/2016,"Went here for lunch on a Friday after reading so many great things about it on Yelp. I was feeling pretty hungry so I decided to go with the porchetta sandwich.The sandwich was a pretty good size--super tender and juicy with a side of au jus to dip in. Though it had some flavor, I have to say that I was hoping that it would have a bit more of a kick to it.Also, the sandwich is large and I could have been fine with just half and getting a cup of soup as well--which would have been about $10, versus the $15 they charge for a full sandwich.Overall, this place has a pretty small menu and they serve up some good food, just be prepared to pay a premium for it and consider ordering the lunch special 1/2 and 1/2 versus the full sandwich.",,,
31,Christopher C.,"Denver, CO",425,1544,295,4.0,2/16/2017,"I have been here a bunch of times, the sandwiches are really good, favs are the sacramento rancher and the roast leg of lamb.

34,Marina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,354,892,5.0,12/3/2015,"If you go to a place called Au Jus, you should probably go with something that comes with jus. Like their really good traditional roast beef sandwich, which is the size of a small child and absolutely delicious.I, however, am a rebel and decided to go with the half roasted chicken. Blasphemy? Maybe, but it was great and I have no regrets. Absolutely huge portion (they aren't kidding with literally half a chicken), with sweet raisin stuffing and your choice of 2 sides. I went classic with green beans and potatoes, although I wouldn't mind returning to try more. The chicken was really moist, not dried out at all like most rotisserie places, and augmented even further by the incredible pan jus on the side.Service was really quick and friendly as well! We were in and out in ten minutes tops (with no wait on a Sunday night).Sorry mom and dad, but I think my meal at Au Jus was better than my thanksgiving. Maybe we can spend it on the upper east side next year.",4,3,3

Updated review","Au Jus.. you turned this curmudgeon of a critic of past bad service into a fan. The food was never an issue, it's quite yummy..  Finally properly staffed with a cashier and full kitchen staff you rock! Lunch combo specials are awesome and cheap $7.95! Flavorful roast beef and the savory porchetta... mmm mmm good. I love the portabello sammie too for those who don't eat meat.. if vegan get it sans the cheese. The soups are hearty and delish, even the vegan options, I love the lentil and pea soup (got some curry in there)! So good. I ignore the pic of Mayor De Blah blah on the wall with the owner.. guess he lives down the block now..  Oh sorry I digress,.. we don't comment on politics on yelp.. :P",4,4,3
37,Marlon E.,"New York, NY",53,20,8,2.0,7/22/2017,"Had the roast beef, sadly I was very disappointed. I've driven past this spot several time and always wanted to stop in.  Wish I hadn't. The roast beef sandwich was flavorless and so sad looking.  I've read great reviews about the roast chicken sandwich. I may stop in and give that a try, hopefully it'll tempt me into giving the spot a few more stars. =\",,,
38,Alex P.,"Flatbush - Ditmas Park, NY",1,8,0,4.0,7/22/2017,Really good sandwiches. Maybe a little expensive for what you get but so far every sandwich I've gotten was delicious and filling so maybe I'm just cheap. Still recommend this place for sure though.,,,

The people were very nice.  I WILL come back and try other things.  If all goes well, I will update to 5 stars.",,,
40,Michelle G.,"Manhattan, NY",7,65,4,5.0,8/10/2015,"A week ago, I ordered salads for my boyfriend and I so we could quickly eat dinner before we had to leave for vacation. The salads were a little late. Not super late, but we were in a rush so were sort of counting on the estimated delivery time. I called Au Jus and they said they would refund my order since we had to leave, but then as I was driving away I saw the delivery guy! I ran to him, got our salads and called to make sure they didn't refund me. The salads were great!Flash forward to today- I returned home from my trip to find the cutest package from Au Jus! They sent me a few cookies wrapped up (which was great since it had been a week that I wasn't home) and a really nice note apologizing for the delay (which wasn't even that bad). This is a great example of excellent customer service. I will 100% be ordering from Au Jus again!",3,,1
41,Stephen J.,"Manhattan, NY",78,232,3864,5.0,8/24/2014,"If I were a smoker I would have lit up right there inside the place as this was easily one of the most satisfying meals we've shared in some time.We had the roast chicken platter - just half the bird, but it comes with stuffing and your choice of two sides - we went for the roasted red bliss potatoes and the seasonal vegetables.  The meat just slid off the bone with minimal carving effort, the potatoes as well as the zucchini/eggplants were all flavorful and disintegrated readily on the first bite as they were so well roasted.  And we drank not ate all this like a couple of prisoners scarfing down our last meal on earth.We were talking to the proprietor ('tis he in the picture with the curly hair) and it looks like he opened up shop about 15 months ago.He gave us free samples of the chicken pot pie as well as the porchetta - and that gesture served its intended function - to lure us back on premises as we are already making plans to go back for more.  Now the porchetta here is not like the drier Italian preparation (like the one in the East Village) - he said the hog is slaughtered and slow roasted for seven hours.The price was reasonable and it is certainly a no frills place as there are a grand total of four stools to eat in and Au Jus is mostly for delivery or take out.",1,,
42,Ashley K.,"New York, NY",312,126,296,4.0,6/2/2015,"I have to say I was very happy with the delivery from the men on the phone to the speed of delivery.  I am giving 4 stars only because I only ordered delivery and I save the prized 5 stars for only the most special places.Food: I orderd a chicken platter. It comes with two sides and although they do not have steamed veggies, the side salad did the job.  The chicken was delicious and was served atop a flavorful blend of veggies and raisins.  I also ordered the small lentil soup which tasted great.  Everything was well porioned for the price and it also came with a fresh roll soft on the outside with a crisp exterior.Hopefully I will have a chance to revise the review to five stars the next time I am in this area as it was a great option for dinner and I would reccomend it for delivery or pick up!",4,1,1
43,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1846,4.0,10/18/2013,"Au Jus just opened a few months ago so they're still working out menu options, hours, and so on. The menu is very simple at this point and only offers 4 sandwiches, 5 sides, and a couple options of soup, salad, and desserts. The sandwiches are roast pork, roast beef, roast lamb, and portabello mushroom for those non meat eaters. Sandwiches are about $13 or $16 with a couple sides. The business itself is simple and clean and is more of a take-out/delivery place but does have a counter with a few stools. I ordered the roast beef au jus sandwich and it couldnt have been better. The ultra tender beef cooked to a perfect pink medium was piled high and ladled with au jus and served on a soft roll with just the right about of crispiness to the top. I was eating it less than 10 minutes after it was prepared and it was getting a little soggy so make sure if you get this you don't have it sitting around for awhile. I would have liked a slightly cheaper, something other than meat in the sandwich, and au jus on the side would have been nice for a to-go order but otherwise I was happy with everything about my Au Jus experience and will be back to try their other options.",4,,6
44,Yoni Z.,"New York, NY",1,83,0,4.0,10/17/2017,"Good casual neighborhood spot for affordable food with good portion sizes. Great for take out and delivery. I hope they stay open to have in the area. The menu has a good amount of options to choose from. My only minor complaint is that the Roast Chicken can be a bit dry but if you add some acid / hot sauce and some extra spices it's good for re-purposing and using to make sandwiches or other dishes the next day. I usually don't care for sweeter stuffing / dressing but their sage stuffing is pretty good blending savory with a touch of sweet.  Sauteed Kale and Green Beans with Tomatoes are both solid side options. I appreciate that they actually season their vegetables, you would think that this is a  given but many other establishments serve bland veggies.",,,

It is a long roll that you would get at a bodega/deli.

My hesitance to try Au Jus when I first moved up here has equated to some pretty intense regret...Since giving them a go I've ordered sandwiches from here twice in the past month and find myself ALWAYS craving it. My partner and I are attempting to make it through their menu but we're addicted to the slow roasted beef sandwich with dip. It's perfect with provolone and a side of their horseradish cream dipping sauce. Add a lovely side of roasted green beans with caramelized onions and tomatoes and you have a real deal meal. When it comes to price point, it may seem somewhat overpriced for just sandwiches or just sliced roast, but the product is fantastic and it's still cheaper than a lot of the restaurants in the area serving lesser quality food. The service at their kitchen is absolutely fantastic. You can tell everyone is working so hard and the cashier behind the counter was incredibly friendly.

The food is fresh and delicious, delivery is fast, and the price is about 30% lower than any other comparable place!The half chicken dinner with green beans and raisin stuffing is more than enough food for a hearty, healthy meal and so so tasty. Also the white bean soup is YUM!!! I order here all the time and it's one of my absolute favorites. Can't wait to try other things!!",,,
53,Jessica W.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",33,53,46,4.0,10/25/2016,Nice little neighborhood spot. The meat is delicious and taste fresh. The prices are very reasonable. The white bean soup was also very good! The place itself is small with limited seating but I don't mind!,1,1,1

55,Matt L.,"Stamford, CT",120,6,3,5.0,12/1/2016,Awesome sandwiches. Reliably good and enough options to try to mix up your lunch options. Definitely the best place to grab a bite in a 3-4 block radius.,,,1
56,Heather P.,"Armonk, NY",38,37,6,4.0,12/30/2015,"Au yumm.I have eaten here several times and ordered delivery once. Every time I'm in the city, it seems we make a stop for this simple, juicy sandwich but there are plenty of other options for you to choose (including vegetarian items!) There are a few seats to eat inside but it is mostly a take-away/delivery type place. The delivery is the fastest I've experienced in NYC.We always get the roast leg of lamb sandwich which comes on delicious rosemary ciabatta and au jus on the side. Don't miss the lunch specials available!",,,
57,Kevin L.,"Manhattan, NY",69,46,72,5.0,7/17/2014,"It was first time visiting this place and I'll definitely come back. There are only 4 or 5 counter seating so if you're planning to bring a group here, you'll need to order out.I missed the great lunch special but I thought I go all out for my first time. I ordered the porchetta and a side of potatoes . The pork was moist and juicy and came on a rosemary bun with the perfect amount of chewyness. I just wish I had more au jus to dip my sandwich in! I'll have to come back again for the lamb and other dishes but I quite satisfied with my order. The potatoes were a bit dry and would have gone great with more au jus. Listen this place is simple and straight to the point which is a great meal with great ingredients. Id like to imagine its a modern version of what an ol' slow roasting sandwich shop used to be. That's a charm to this place that is a little hidden in Yorkville.",1,,1
58,Peter N.,"New York, NY",10,88,0,4.0,8/10/2016,"I have been meaning to try this place ever since I saw an article that the staff at Gracie Mansion are big fans. May be a touch pricey at $12 for a sandwich, but probably big enough to feed two if you get a side. Roast beef sandwich was excellent. Served up in only a minute or two. There are only 4-5 counter seats, so go off hours if you plan to eat in. I will definitely be back to try other items.",2,,

Updated review","Finally came to the restaurant.  It's pretty small - room for 4 seats along the narrow counter.Decent selection of food, but they keep it small - I like that.  Do what you do best.As such, I ordered the roast beef sandwich au jus.  It was very good.  The bread was nice and soft, with a bit of crunch.  The meat was really good - not as rare as I'd like, but parts were pretty pink (and tasty).  The jus was terrific and flavorful, really making the sandwich excellent.I finished it very quickly and wanted another (but maybe next time).  My sandwich was $12 (I didn't get the lunch special).  It was a little pricey, but overall a great sandwich.  Their lunch specials look like a steal.",1,,1
61,Christine S.,"Reno, NV",174,267,41,4.0,10/12/2015,Ordered to go here because we were staying at a hotel right around the corner.Delicious! Their bread is heavenly! Very fresh meats with a lot of flavor. We will come back and order here again.,,,

64,Ann H.,"Fairfield, CA",9,34,41,4.0,6/19/2015,I had a great leg of lamb salad (without feta cheese) and it hit the spot. My husbands roast beef sandwich was good but we were both wishing we had gotten platters after seeing all the delicious sides. The cheesesteak sandwich could have used more cheese but the beverage selection was good and reasonably prices. Plan on takeout as seating is minimal.,1,,
65,Rob S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,264,92,4.0,8/17/2015,"This place is a local gem.  Every sandwich I have ordered from them has been outstanding.  I especially love the cheese steak, make sure to get it with cream horseradish, they put it on the side so you can slather it on yourself.   The White Bean Soup is outstanding, I get it whenever I order and they have a nice section of craft sodas as well.  Never been disappointed, delivery is always within the time Seamless specifies, prices are reasonable.  Big fan, going to eat at the location one of these days.N.B. - The have excellent iced coffee here.",,,
66,Andrew B.,"Manhattan, NY",81,76,3,3.0,12/21/2013,"Darn! I have to give Au Jus 3 stars because I was expecting so much more.The roast beef was very moist, but nothing that screamed fantastic. The side of potatoes were just OK. In short, this was a good lunch, but I expected so much more based on the reviews. I'm thinking it may because I came in early when he was just setting up  and got the lunch special - perhaps dinners are best.Anyways, I'll update the review after I try Au Jus a couple more time because I really, really want to give this place a good review and thoroughly enjoy it. Also, as other reviewers have said, the owner seems like a great guy who genuinely cares about his business. He offered to personally deliver food which is awesome!",1,,
67,Rachel D.,"Bayonne, NJ",14,9,0,5.0,9/15/2016,Staff is super friendly and the roast beef is absolutely amazing! They also have a soup and sandwich combo and they sell roasts by the pound. Def gonna come back.,,,

69,Maurice K.,"Flushing, NY",55,6,1,4.0,5/23/2016,Greetings.   Had the roasted chicken breast sandwich.  It was pretty dang tasty.  The chicken was fairly moist and the bacon wasn't too crispy (just the way I like it uh huh).  The chipotle sweet pepper mayo was surprisingly good.  It had a little bit of a kick but not overpowering.  Thats about it.,,1,
70,Alyssa C.,"Manhattan, NY",85,65,80,5.0,3/24/2015,I love this place. A real gem.The roastbeef sandwich (add cheese!) is one of the best I've ever had. Not chewy at all. Really tasty.

72,David B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,5.0,7/10/2016,"I odered from this place for the first time last week.  Since I rely on delivery and tend to be very picky I was thrilled with the result. The perfect sandwhich of my imagination is a French dip roast beef.   Wll this was about as close to that ideal as i""ve had in ages/ To get closer to ideal I would: use rare beef, use a crisp baguette, serve some really good pickles. I would NOT replace the horseradish sauce. I have ordered their sandwiches twce since. Do your self a favor. Order their food before they get too popular",,,
73,Leonard F.,"Queens, NY",15,194,0,2.0,8/4/2014,"Yes the meats are very tender but the sandwiches are so plain: bread, meat, jus. This would be fine if the meat was super flavorful and well-seasoned but that was not the case here. So the sandwiches (we had roast beef and pork) are boring and bland. The potatoes were also bland. The chicken pot pie soup was the tastiest thing we tried. On the positive side, delivery was fast and the lunch special prices are reasonable.",4,,3
74,Channing M.,"Manhattan, NY",32,13,0,1.0,11/5/2014,Maybe they just got too busy but these sandwiches were far from okay.  The bread on our roast beef sandwiches were drenched in sauce and the beef was raw and not even close to cooked.  It was basically like trying to eat a rubber glove between two rolls of soaked paper towels.,1,5,
75,Carl W.,"San Francisco, CA",128,153,8,4.0,2/3/2015,"The food here is simply phenomenal. I have ordered from them many times and I have tried their beef, pork and lamb sandwiches, their chicken pot pie soup and their roast chicken. Everything tastes perfect. And their lunch specials are all great deals. One thing which keeps me from giving them 5 stars is that they often mess up on the minor things for delivery--forgetting to include utensils or when you ask for a cup of jus or sugar or others and they're not included. These things don't ruin the dining experience but they are nuisances, especially if you have paid extra to have those things included.",,,
76,Tracy M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,50,0,5.0,3/2/2016,"I've never had anything from here that wasn't absolutely fresh and delicious. The meats are always perfectly cooked - so tender and juicy! Great sides, too!",,,

I went w/ this place cuz the wings place charges a buck a wing.Asked the counterman what he preferred, the porchetta or the leg of lamb and he said he preferred the lamb so I ordered that. The sandwich came soaked on the bottom and a side of jus for extra moistness. The lamb was tender and juicy and flavorful and was an excellent choice.  I'll have to come back for the porchetta, but I'll definitely be back.",,,
78,ChefLee H.,"New York, NY",20,13,3,5.0,4/8/2016,Being a working chef I can hands down say that this place is so slamming good. I had the leg of lamb sandwich that was set on a rosemary chabatta roll and a cup of Au jus. The meat was juicy tender and full of flavor. I can't wait to return to try another item on their menu. Small menu that diversifies their product line of roasted meats being chicken beef and lamb. Defiantly cooked daily and never frozen meats. Not a sit down establishment with only five counter seats. Great food excited to try their plater meals which is served with two side items. Did I say great food already?,,,
79,Eddie A.,"Manhattan, NY",41,13,8,2.0,3/12/2014,"Being new to the city, I have heavily been relying on the expert reviews of fellow Yelpers to inspire my culinary excursions. My decision to try Au Jus was no exception. The restaurant is certainly more conducive and geared towards take out only. I decided to try the Roasted Beef Au Jus platter. This comes with two sides. I went with the White Beans and Green beans. Here is where my excitement to try a potential neighborhood gem came to a slow halt. Properly cooked Roast Beef, paired with a good jus, might simply be one the tastiest foods. Unfortunately, instead of the standard medium rare that Roast Beef should be served at, mine was clearly the end of a roast, or just plain killed. It had no pink remaining and was frankly well done for my pallet. While the Au Jus was tasty, it was not enough to salvage the over cooked meat. What a bummer!The green beans were cooked with roasted shallots and tomatoes, and had great flavor! The white beans, well, they were so so and lacked some flavor. Probably just a poor choice and should of went potatoes. Perhaps the slight saving grace, and a last minute, ""I really shouldn't"" decision, were the chocolate chip cookies! Soft, chewy, melt in your mouth deliciousness. Probably not made in house though. Overall, this has been my first real disappointment since moving here. I will certainly give them another shot. I will make certain my meat isn't over cooked next time, and then I'm sure it will be amazing!",4,2,2

81,Gwynn T.,"Washington, DC",15,20,0,4.0,4/11/2014,"Sandwich of the GodsPlease note: This review is based on a delivery order, not an eat-in experience.I ordered the lunch special with the lamb sandwich and side of coleslaw.  First off, the delivery was prompt and correct.  The coleslaw was spot on--fresh, crunchy, tangy and not drowning in a lot of goopy mayonnaise.  The leg of lamb sandwich was to die for!!  The slow-roasted lamb was flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  Dipping the meat in the au jus kept it moist and tender.  I'd rate this experience a solid 3.5 with a couple of minor quibbles: 1. In the description on Seamless Web, the bread was described as foccacia but it was actually a brioche-like bun (which I prefer)  2. I wish the side offerings were a bit more diverse. Even with a few minor glitches, I'll definitely be ordering again.",4,1,

83,Joyce L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,1,3.0,4/4/2014,"I really wanted to like the roasted beef au jus sandwich I ordered for lunch, but ultimately it was disappointing.  The lunch special sandwich comes on a brioche bun, which I think is its undoing.  When I had some of the roast beef by itself, it was very tender and fairly flavorful.  However, the brioche had a sort of ""blandifying"" effect.  Salt and pepper fixed things somewhat.  I think the baguette that the sandwich comes with a la carte (non lunch special) would have provided more contrast in flavor and texture.  Also, the sandwich didn't come with any jus on the side for dipping, which could have maybe salvaged things.The coleslaw was very mayonnaise-y and didn't have any vinegary tang.I would be willing to try the food again, but probably not the lunch special even though it is a good deal.",4,,1
84,M L.,"Woodbury, CT",3,5,12,5.0,4/13/2015,"Every time I order it's delivered promptly and professionally. They might have the happiest delivery guy on the upper east side. All of the food is great, I see some people critiquing price and I guess uniqueness which confuses me. They are gourmet sandwiches of excellent quality And seamless tells you it's comfort food and sandwiches so one wouldn't really expect wd50.  For me it's the best restaurant in the area on seamless. Is it a bit expensive perhaps but the execution and consistency warrants the price. Can't wait to order again",,,
85,jessie c.,"Manhattan, NY",35,34,4,4.0,1/6/2014,"Tonight I ordered the beef au jus platter with the roasted potatoes and the seasonal vegetable. The food arrived within 20 minutes despite the 45-60 minute wait time posted on seamless. Awesome! The meat itself was divine. Perfectly seasoned and cooked just right. The jus itself was delicious as well. The sides were the problem. The potatoes lacked seasoning and were unevenly cooked. They weren't terrible but if you can make beef so well the roasted potatoes should have been a shoe in. The seasonal vegetable that they sent me was sautéed kale. Actually it was more like cumin with a side of kale. I like cumin, but it's a very strong spice. This kale was just inedible. I really wanted to like it because I love kale but I just couldn't. It's a pity because it was a pretty big serving of it as well. Oh well...now I know to find out how it's prepared before ordering next time. I'll definitely order again and hope that this was just an isolated incident.",6,,
86,Peter Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",644,636,415,5.0,11/13/2013,"Definitely a hidden gem, judging by the zero wait time my friends and I faced during peak lunch hours during a weekday. The inside is small, and there's no real seating area aside from a few stools, so be prepared to get your food to go.You order up front at the counter, and from a simple menu containing a few sandwich items. While they don't have a large selection, you can't go wrong with anything.Their sandwiches are absolutely delicious. The porchetta and roasted leg of lamb are my favorites, both filled with freshly made, juicy and tender melt-in-your-mouth chunks of meat. The service is also fantastic. The owner of the store is super friendly, willing to accommodate any of your needs. Hungry? Come to Au Jus for a simple yet amazing meal.",8,2,8

Lamb, roll, that's it. No sides. Cost $13 with tax. And it was one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever eaten. The meat was moist and tender and delicately flavored. Even the bread was the perfect collision of soft and chewy, with a bit of crunch to the crust. The clean-lined storefront is practically hidden mid-block, and there are only 4 stools at a counter. The guy who made my sandwich said almost nothing to me until he handed me a perfectly wrapped package with a smile: ""Nice and hot."" It was both.",7,,7

The owner takes time to prepare each one perfectly.  Speaking of the owner, he kept shoving samples of the food at me, he gave me a cup of porchetta to snack on while he pressed my sandwich, he also gave me two small cups of the soup after my meal was over (the white bean  was lights out).  He was super nice, and can tell he believes in his product, and obviously he made a believer out of me.I hope this place thrives, its amazing that such a small place can make such a huge difference in the neighborhood, and gives me hope that more awesome, original places will take the risk and set up shop uptown.Go here!!!",6,,3

I love their sides.  Delivery is normally quicker than the estimated time, even though we're 10 blocks south.  I have discovered a noticeable difference in quality in weekday vs. weekend orders, and for that reason, we've decided only to order from here on weekdays. The first few times we ordered, the sandwiches came with au jus, now they only seem to include it if you specifically ask for it. Overall, this place is a great addition to the neighborhood!",5,,

The restaurant is very clean and you can tell the owners and employees take pride in the place.  The dine-in space is rather small, with only 4-5 counter seats.  If you're stopping by for a quick bite, it's perfect but if you have a large group, you should order  take out.

The rosemary focaccia (or ciabatta?) was soft and fresh, but the rosemary pieces were large and long enough to be poking my mouth. I know that sounds stupid, but it was no fun. The lamb was also prepared with garlic, and garlic and I are -not- friends. The roll was very fresh, and the price was fair. I should have gotten the roast beef, but the guy at the shop said the lamb was very fresh. Shoulda gone with my gut..",5,2,7

101,Aya I.,"Manhattan, NY",255,5,1,4.0,8/12/2013,"This is my new favorite place to order really well-prepared slow-cooked meats and vegetables. My favorite is their porchetta. Yet I must admit, I think I continue to return because of their seasonal sides of vegetables and soups. Their mainstay side is their green beans with shallots and tomatoes which is always beautiful. I had some kale and carrots today with my dinner platter and they were excellent. The other reviewers are correct in saying that the platter feeds for two when you add a salad or soup. I've tried three of their soups now and I'm torn between their lentil and split pea. Overall, everything is above expectations for a take-out place that delivers slow-cooked fresh foods in portions for a single eater like me who can't fathom roasting an entire leg of lamb or filling their crock pot for just one person.

But, the slightly sweet notes in the roast beef au jus won me over. I purchased a roast beef sandwich on a baguette with asiago cheese.  The sandwich was a whopping $12...but it was definitely worth it. I will be back! Also, the desserts looked amazing.

The place is super tiny, so I wouldn't expect to take a bunch of people, or stay at all for that matter, but it is very good. They have a very limited menu, an aspect that I personally love about small places like this. There are four sandwiches to choose from, and we have now had all four of them. Surprisingly, my favorite sandwich has been the Vegetarian one- the mushrooms an pesto are in very healthy proportions on a fabulous brioche bun. The next best sandwich is the classic rosy beef with au jus. My sole complaint is that the sandwiches get a little too messy. Depending on who crafts them, there can be a tendency to over-sauce and the bread falls apart. But that is not enough to turn me off of these delicious sandwiches. P.S. There are select baked goods that are also pretty tasty!",2,,

So happy it was because Au Jus is delicious. All of the workers were very friendly. My fiance and I ordered the beef platter and they gave us almost every side with it even though we ordered only 1 or 2. We also had the sweet potato soup which was amazing. I wish I could eat that soup every day. The beef was perfectly cooked and thin sliced -- very moist. The salad was small and nothing to write home about, but the other sides like the beans and kale were fantastic.The second time we ordered on Seamless and had the lamb. It was also very good, but I still think the beef is the best option. Portions are quite large and easy to share. Sadly, they ran out of my favorite soup that night but sent two other options, split pea and broccoli which were also pretty good.We always get really great service from this restaurant and they go out of their way to make sure you are happy.",1,,

108,Preston H.,"New York, NY",7,1,0,4.0,10/11/2014,"This is a cozy little sandwich shop, that is tucked away on the Upper Upper East Side. I came here on a cold and rainy fall day. Their sandwiches were the perfect comfort food. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. The food is simple but done perfectly. My cheese steak was to die for! The beef was perfectly cooked and the hero roll soaked up all the moister from the beef and the sandwich was not messy. The roasted potatoes were perfectly cooked. My fiancé got a Cuban sandwich and could not stop raving about it. He said it was one of the best Cuban sandwiches he has ever had. He also enjoyed his side of the avocado salad.The draw back to this restaurant is that there is very limited seating. There are only four bar stools against a 12 inch deep counter. The wait for the food was a little long as well. It took us about 15 minutes to get our food.I highly recommend this restaurant for take out or delivery. I will definitely be coming back in the future.",,,

Then when I called just before closing time- 2 hours later- he said he never got the order.......I am trying to give you money, and you are not accepting it.  Very upset with this and will never order again.  Such a shame as their sandwiches are really great, but when you can't get your act together for delivery, you lose business.",2,1,

Got there when seamless said my order would be ready, yet had to wait about 10 minutes to get food. Plus they were out of the sides I ordered, which is really disappointing since they have 8 items on the menu. The roast beef was fine, nothing special. The potatoes were mediocre. It's not hard to make bad potatoes, but it's not much harder to make some that are good. Place has potential, but it's these little things (that are easy to fix) that'll keep them from being successful.",1,,

I can't even put into words how great the sandwich is - the bread is never too chewy and the side of jus is essential.

So we decided to try Au Jus and are glad we did. Recommend take out or delivery because they have only 4 bar stools in a corner. The soup and sandwiches are excellent. I had the Chicken Pot Pie Soup and Roast Leg of Lamb Sandwich. Wife had the White Bean Soup with the Porchetta Sandwich. Both were great. We were given samples of the vegan Black Bean Soup (daily special) which was incredibly flavorful. Wanted to try a couple of the other sandwiches, but my wife wouldn't allow me. I was given permission to have a hot dog with sauerkraut and a sample of the roast beef sandwich. Yummy. Try it. You will not be disappointed.

I was skeptical about asking a place called Au Jus to create vegan and vegetarian sandwich options for us, but he and his staff came through in the clutch. Lunch was delicious, lots of creative variety, delivered right on time, within the budget I had given, and with plenty to go around. I watched people from every floor hustle down the hallway and help themselves to 2 or 3 at a time, and the cookies were outstanding. Phil was easy to work with and contact, and I'm glad to have him in the area for future deliveries. Thanks to him and his great staff for coming through so seamlessly.",,,

My daughter has the roast beef sandwich special---with au jus of course---that included cole slaw and a drink for $7.95...worth every penny.  It's a simple place that offers up some great grub. Not much real estate in which to eat; but if I lived in the neighborhood, I would be a regular. Terrific!",,,
123,Abby R.,"Raleigh, NC",0,9,4,5.0,4/27/2015,"We have been regulars here since moving into the building above last year. It has yet to disappoint us and I can't imagine it ever will. Nothing nearby can come close to matching the quality and preparation of their food. It may not be cheap but neither is the quality. You truly get what you pay for here. To top it off, we have had nothing but the BEST service here whether in person or delivery. The owner is so genuinely kind and appreciative of your business it almost seems out of place in the city. So far we have tried (and loved) the roast beef sandwich, cheesesteak, Vermonter sandwich, Cuban sandwich, Cobb salad, chicken pot pie soup, sweet potato soup, every single dessert (not exaggerating), red potatoes, coleslaw, and the stuffing. I would recommend one of everything. My personal favorites, though, would be the Vermonter and Cuban sandwiches, chicken pot pie and sweet potato soups, and the s'mores cookie. We are so thankful this place is steps away from our home. It truly never disappoints and it's so nice to frequent a local spot that actually appreciates your business.",,,

131,Kaitlin W.,"Manhattan, NY",179,27,6,5.0,3/12/2014,"I am a big fan of this place.  My fiance was the one who found it and wanted to try it initially, but I was hesitant at first because of the smaller menu and I'm just not a big fan of heavy sandwiches like the roast beef or roast pork type sandwiches Au Jus makes.  I eventually decided to sack up, which was the best decision ever, because the food here is SO GOOD!  And the service is equally as great.I ordered the Roasted Beef Au Jus, which comes with a very generous portion of tender, flavorful roast beef on a baguette.  It also comes with dipping juice on the side, which adds even more delicious flavor.  My fiance got the Porchetta (roast pork) sandwich, which also came with a big helping of meat on delicious rosemary focaccia bread.  The juice for this one was excellent as well.  Au Jus may have few options and the sandwiches may seem simple, but just trust - these sandwiches are amazing.  They really don't need any of the additional accoutrements.We've ordered from here several times, but what inspired me to write today was an incident that left me feeling pretty bummed at first - I ordered my standard roast beef au jus, and it turned up sans jus!  It was a terrible feeling at first, and I didn't want to call back and make the delivery guy come all the way back to my apartment with a tiny little thing of dipping juice, but it really does make the sandwich so I went for it anyway.  The guy on the phone was SUPER nice about it (oftentimes when you call a place when they forget something they're pretty indignant about it).  But this guy totally understood:  ""You didn't get your juice?  I'm so so sorry, we'll deliver it right away, not a problem.""  Not only that, but my jus arrived stat - like 5-10 minutes stat...accompanied by a delicious house-baked chocolate brownie.  Good move, Au Jus, good move - because I don't think I can survive without that brownie anymore, and will therefore be adding it to my standard order.",4,1,1

There is a menu on the wall to your left and on the outside windowAtmosphere: - Small place with some stools and ledge along the left wall and window to eat at (probably ~5 or so stools)- You can see all the action happening in the kitchen and the carving of the meat for the sandwiches.  Very clean spaceService:- Nice lady served us.  She was friendly and gave us a sample of the soup of the day (lentil soup)Food:- We split the Porchetta sandwich and the roasted Lamb sandwich which come with some jus (roasting drippings) in a separate container for you to dip your sandwich in- Roasted lamb is ridiculous.  Great flavor, moist all around delicious meat.  Served on a ciabatta roll that soaks up the juices. So good, I'm still thinking about it- Porchetta is amazing as well, really enjoyed it.  Moist, flavor is there served on same ciabatta roll- Meat is stacked up high - this is really a meat sandwich- Lentil soup was amazing, will be getting that again for sure.  Nicely cooked (not mushy) in a brown broth with other veg in there.  Very niceOther:- Left here completely satiated and looking forward to my next trip- $12/sandwich.

138,Frank D.,"New York, NY",2,5,1,5.0,6/29/2013,"I knew the chef here was serious about his roasted meats when I mentioned Porchetta down in the East Village, and he made a sour face. Clearly, he takes a lot of pride in what he serves, and that pride pays off.  I've now had the roast lamb and the porchetta, and they were both excellent: tender, juicy, bathed, appropriately, in their juices. But it's not just the meats that are worth making the trip. Au Jus serves the best sauteed kale I've ever tasted. I can't quite nail down the spices the chef is using (and he seemed reluctant to give away his recipe), but he says it's a Mediterranean preparation. Whatever it is, it's damn delicious. His lentil soup is also really good. I usually avoid lentils when I eat out because the preparation is typically pretty bland, but not the lentils here. Chef gave me a taste of the soup, and I liked it so much that I took it as one of my side dishes.  I know a previous reviewer mentioned the ""premium"" price, and, yes, Au Jus isn't cheap. BUT you're getting quality and value. The $15.00 porchetta platter I bought was almost too much food--but so good I finished it all. The restaurant has just expanded its hours (usually to 10 p.m.) and it delivers now, so check it out.",16,,23

We tried again today and ordered the RB, lamb and the portabello. Ordered for pick up and after returning home found that they left out one of the sides and ALL the au jus.  What a difference a dipping sauce makes!

I don't go to restaurants to get my food flash warmed up by a microwave. I expect food made to order and yes I understand the meat is prepared in advance but my sides were all microwaved--way too hot to eat then cold within minutes.

I also told the staff at the Courtyard to check them out and recommend them to other patrons. This was a beautifully homemade style meal, and for this road warrior, weary of fast food, a haven. Smells like thanksgiving when you walk in, despite that they don't have turkey on the menu, lol!I look forward to trying everything on the menu, probably the cheapest meal I've had in NYC.",,,
164,Hannah L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,5.0,3/9/2014,"WOW! I have never written a Yelp review, but my experience at Au Jus inspired me to run home (or I should say meander home, as I'm full to the point of bursting) and write a review. I found both the food AND the service to be absolutely incredible.The menu is not huge, but there is a vegetarian option and sandwiches can be made into platters, creating gluten-free options. I had the roast beef and my boyfriend had the leg of lamb; each bite was magnificent. Additionally, the sweetest man kept bringing us over various samples. We tried two of the soups and the rosemary potatoes-delicious. I highly recommend this hidden gem!",,,
165,Suzy I.,"New York, NY",29,5,0,5.0,1/14/2014,"Everything is amazing! Ask about daily soup options, the recent butternut squash was out of this world! I walk in the rain here all the time, just because it is soooo good! Fav sandwich is the roast beef.",,,
166,Taylor G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,58,0,4.0,3/15/2015,"Ordered takeout from here last night and can't wait to do it again. Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! I had the ""Upper East Side cheesesteak"" which was delicious. So much flavor. I'm from Philly so I appreciate a good cheesesteak, but this is something else entirely. My boyfriend had the panchetta platter and while he said it was a good portion size (a high compliment for him), he found the meat a bit bland. I tasted it and thought it was delicious, so what does he know?",1,,1
167,Eric B.,"Ithaca, NY",0,5,0,5.0,8/31/2015,"Went with wife and kids. The beef sandwiches are large and incredibly juicy. Seating is very limited, however we did eat in. As we did so the owner continued to bring us food on the house. First soup, then pork, then cookies. Wonderful people, better food.",,,
168,Denali L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,41,1,5.0,2/15/2014,"Just ordered here via Seamless... AMAZING.Had the lentil soup and porchetta platter. The soup was delicious, hearty, perfect for this cold snowy day. The fresh rosemary bread was a nice touch for dipping. The porchetta was juicy, perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. Oh and adding to the deliciousness- the delivery came in 20minutes despite the snowy disaster outside!Zero complaints over here. Perfect comfort food. Kudos.",,,
169,Stephanie L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,5.0,1/10/2014,"This area of the upper east side is sorely lacking in good restaurants, let alone take out/delivery restaurants.  Well, I feel like I won the lottery when I accidently came upon this place in Seamless.  My delight started as soon as I called to order.  The gentleman  with an adorable Italian (?) accent asked me my name and proceeded to call me by name throughout my order.  At the end he thanked me by name (so charming) and when I asked him ""how long for the delivery""  he responded brightly -  ""As asoona as I-a make-a it!   It gets better:We ordered the leg of lamb sandwich and platter.  Even before I laid eyes on the food, I smelled the amazing fragrance.  The sandwich was totally overstuffed with the most tender, and expertly seasoned lamb.   Utterly fresh ciabatta roll.  The platter was equally amazing in quantity of meat with delicious home made roasted potatoes and savory white beans.  Plenty of wonderful  au jus made it  moist and juicy.  I also had a side of cole slaw -  home made and delish.I may never cook again!",,,
170,Jennifer M.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",0,25,15,5.0,1/5/2014,My mom and I went here to check this place out. I just want to say that this is one of the best restaurants my mom and i have ever been to. The leg of lamb sandwich is amazing and the meat is great. I would recommend this place to others. Little restaurants like these need a chance to gain popularity. I say give it a try.,,,
171,Jessie F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,35,1,5.0,4/25/2016,"So delighted to find this little gem in the neighborhood. We ate in, and so glad we did because the owner gave us samples of a number of things. We ordered the lunch special, which you get any day of the week. It's a great deal--for $7.95 you get a small sandwich of one of their roasted meats and soup. We ordered the porchetta sandwich with white bean soup, the roasted lamb sandwich with the chicken pot pie soup, and a niman ranch hot dog. The meats in the sandwiches were tender and tasty, and the bread used was tasty as well. The chicken pot pie soup was very rich and tasty. The white bean soup was so flavorful--you would have never guessed it was vegan. The owner gave us samples of both soups as well, and the black bean soup (also vegan and delicous). He also gave us a sample of the roast beef, which was one of the best roast beef I've ever had. When we mentioned that we will try the cheese steak on our next visit, the owner gave us a sample of that as well. It had a bit of spice-another hit! We will definitely be back.",,,
172,Stuart T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/8/2016,"i recently discovered this wonderful take out establishment. my wife and i have had two deliveries in 5 days and can tell you these people know what they are doing. the roast herbed chicken is out of sight delicious as is the raisin sage stuffing. the avocado salad is spot on and you must try the sautéed kale. try these people, you wont be disappointed !!!!!!",,,
173,Peter M.,"New York, NY",0,7,1,1.0,1/16/2015,"Lunch time , Roast beef sandwich $12 small no pickle or fries, Grilled Chicken with only tomato & Lettuce $12 no pickle or fries. 2 small bottles of water, 2 small lentil soups & bad of potato chips $44 LUNCH TIME!!!! No seating to sit down to watch a TV etc. Over all it was very small and we were still hungry after the meal. Then again in that area nothing is cheap",,2,
174,Ritvik P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0,4.0,5/4/2015,"Au Jus is a great addition to the neighborhood.  I have had the porchetta, lamb, and numerous sandwiches.  I do recommend the UES cheesesteak.  It is really good although I did like it more the first time I had it where the beef was a little thicker than the thin slices they had recently.  You can't go wrong with the sides.  The service is friendly.",,,
175,Philip W.,"New York, NY",12,16,0,5.0,9/20/2014,"After moving to the upper eastside from midtown east, we were worried there wouldn't be any good food options around this area.  We stumbled in to this place after a hard day of moving and unpacking and were pleasantly surprised on how good the soup and sandwiches were!  This was 6 months ago and ever since that day we've made it a point to come here at least once a week!  Definitely one of our favorite spots to eat out here in the upper east side.  They're also expanding their menu with a delectable and legit Cuban sandwich and a fancy twist on a cheese steak sandwich!  The owner is awesome to boot!!!",1,,
176,Rajiv M.,"Cambridge, MA",0,22,0,5.0,10/24/2013,Vegetarian so I had the roasted portabella which was delicious (although slightly greasy). Sides are also excellent- especially the lentils which were fantastic and very flavorful. Staff is very kind and gave me some soup to sample while I waited. Will definitely go back.,3,,5
177,Michael R.,"Fairfield, CT",0,6,0,5.0,7/22/2013,Probably one of the best roast beef sandwiches I have ever had came from this place. Went there twice already and both times the food was amazing. A little on the pricey side for lunch but well worth it for the quality that you can't find at most places. Very friendly and clean storefront. I will be going back many times.,6,,8
178,G A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,4.0,8/2/2013,Great sandwiches! The food was fresh and carefully prepared. We had the lamb sandwich and portabella mushroom sandwich and both were delicious. The quality of the ingredients really sets this place apart. It's great to have Au Jus in the neighborhood.,5,,8
179,Val O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/22/2013,Delicious. Had the roast beef au jus with red onion confit and it was terrific. The brioche type bun complimented it perfectly. Will definitely be going back.,7,,11
180,Wera C.,"Manhattan, NY",96,2,0,5.0,7/8/2013,Amazing place! Sandwiches are awesome. Me and my boyfriend tried lamb and beef and they were just incredible! Definitely recommend!,5,,8
181,Michael M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,2,0,5.0,9/13/2013,Great lamb and porchetta. I'm definitely going back.  The owner is obviously very passionate about his service and food and does a great job with both.  I honestly look forward to going to the place and would probably eat here everyday if I could afford eating out so much.,2,,4
182,Molly S.,"Manhattan, NY",127,8,0,5.0,11/25/2014,Had delivery a few times and it was great.  Had my first dine-in experience last week only a few spaces to sit but a nice atmosphere and the people who work there are so nice!,,,
183,Reed R.,"Hartsdale, NY",0,12,0,5.0,10/17/2014,"AU JUS proves that big things come in small packages.  Petite location with fabulous, homemade flavor and a very nice, personable owner/manager.   AU JUS is known for it's slow-roasted meats but this time I enjoyed a bowl of the best vegan lentil soup I've ever had.   It was served with a hunk of fresh bread and while I was enjoying it I was offered samples of other soup varieties which were also terrific.  I was so full I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day.  This is truly gourmet food at very reasonable prices.",,,
184,Craig R.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",9,8,2,4.0,8/19/2013,"The second we walked in and saw the clean cut management, hard at work staff in the back, and smell of succulent italian seasoned meats we were ready. The first thing that welcomed us was the front counter staff offered us a good sized sample of the delicious lentil soup, which is highly recommended now that i've had it. Next, I had the porchetta sandwich with au jus and roasted potatoes with a orange san pellegrino and my friend had the Roasted Lamb sandwich. Absolutely incredible. I am a stickler for good food since I cook at home most of the time and can safely say I truly enjoyed the food at this newish upper east side establishment. I can't wait to go again.",,,5
185,Foodie L.,"London, United Kingdom",0,25,4,5.0,1/26/2014,"Absolutely awesome food! This is for delivery, and between my boyfriend and I, we've tried pretty much every item on the menu and we just keep coming back. Meat is tender and plentiful, the jus takes it to the next level and the rosemary focaccia that often comes with the platters complements the flavours beautifully. Roast potatoes have been a bit hit and miss, but the seasonal veg and white beans are tasty and filling. Love this place",,,
186,Rachael M.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,0,5.0,1/13/2014,I don't write many reviews but I have to say I am so impressed. Delivery time given was 45-60 min but it came in less than 20. Ordered the lamb sandwich and it was still piping hot and delicious. They may not have a large menu but they do it right. I'll take that any day!,,,
187,Mai W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,10/19/2013,"I think they must pay people for these reviews.  I have ordered three times and there has been something wrong every time.  Burnt sides, missing items from order, lots of fat with no lean meat.. The manager on his computer at the counter with no idea about how to serve food.  I don't get it because it is expensive.  In this neighborhood, it should be impeccable. I like the place so I tried to speak to them about it.  Sadly nothing changed in three tries.  Now I see they have chicken. I don't think they will be longer at this location than their lease.",,,
