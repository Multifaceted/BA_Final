0,Alain T.,"San Francisco, CA",5,17,3,5.0,10/11/2018,"I've stayed here many times when visiting New York city and have never been disappointed.  The rooms are super nice, clean, and spacious.   The price is surprisingly reasonable for the quality of the accommodation plus the proximity to everything.   I just love this hotel so much.   It's my NYC home away from home.  It's a real gem.  If I could give it a six-star rating, I would.",1,1,
1,Janet I.,"San Jose, CA",15,150,781,4.0,10/27/2018,"This is a great hotel. We have been very pleased with the staff including the front desk. The rooms are clean very spacious. I was pleasantly surprised with the kitchen includes a nice size refrigerator 2 burner range top with everything you need to cook if you so desired rather than dining out. The free breakfast includes hot items potatoes, various egg dishes (eggs with cheese, fried eggs, scrambled eggs) yogurt, cereal, hot oatmeal, tea, coffee, juices. Of course, bagels, different breads for toasts, hot cakes etc...I enjoyed staying hear to listen to all the different languages spoken from all the tourists who stayed here. Everyone was so friendly.I'm giving this a 4 star rating because of the elevators which are small and for the size of the hotel with 32 floors 3 small elevators is insufficient. They need a separate one for the cleaning crew. I heard people say they have been waiting for 20 minutes to get in a elevator especially during peak hours breakfast and check out. If we ever come back to NY we will stay here again.The location is convenient to walk to Times Square.",4,4,4
2,Norm W.,"Langley, Canada",4,53,142,4.0,9/21/2018,"We have stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions. Once in 2011 and again in September of 2018. We struggled with three or four stars because of the elevators and their issues on both visits. We chose four because the staff were, and are awesome, the location ideal and the kitchenette perfect if you don't want to eat out all the time or have a young family. So let's talk about the elevators. There are three of them which should be enough for 32 stories and 310 rooms, but they aren't. We stayed on the 6th floor this time and walked both down, and up on a number of occasions after waiting for entirely too long. One of the elevators was not working for two of our five nights. It's especially bad during the morning hours when people are checking out and taking advantage of the included breakfast. The included breakfast is both plentiful and pretty tasty for trough food although the staff seem to take a while to clean up after those that seem incapable of doing so themselves. There are no trays to put your used plates, bowls and such after you finish eating which causes most to just get up and wander away. Not sure why that is, but it really needs to change. They have opened up the lower lobby level since we were there in 2011 and have breakfast service down there as well. There are washers and dryers for pay which is a nice touch and helpful when it's hot any humid in NYC. The hotel is well situated and close to restaurants, transit and Times Square. Most of the things you want to see are within walking distance, so if walking a City is your thing, like it is ours, Staybridge is a solid choice.",1,,1
3,Jennifer E.,"Orange Beach, AL",2,33,4,1.0,9/4/2018,"We spent the Labor Day weekend (Thursday through Monday) at this hotel and it was admittedly jam-packed for the long weekend, but there were issues that still need to be improved in a big way.  1.  Elevators: There are 3 elevators and one was broken the whole weekend and the staff didn't seem to think too much about the fact that a major cause of the traffic jam in the lobby was people who had to wait by the staff's estimates ""5-30 minutes"" for a lift.  People were sitting in the hallways on the higher floors with their luggage waiting on an elevator for upwards of 40 minutes on Monday because the elevators were so packed that no one could fit on. I got ON the elevator from the 3rd floor with my two suitcases and rode UP to the 30th floor just to get ON the elevator and then eventually ride back down. And the staff just didn't worry about this. A guy from South Africa said he was NOT impressed. I told him I had not stayed in an IHG property that was like this one.2.  Towels and Tissue Paper:  On Sunday I came back to a clean room, but there were NO bath towels. I called the front desk twice and got no answer. Finally I got an answer and asked for them to be delivered. Two hours later they were still not there and they were not worried about it.  My husband went downstairs (via  the stairwell since there were not enough elevators) and called corporate in front of the staff and they ""suddenly"" ""cared."" I had towels in about 10 minutes. There was no spare tissue paper roll in the cabinet on the same day. Ridiculous.3.  General ""I don't care attitude"" on the part of the staff:  Basically the front desk staff didn't really care whether the guests were 'happy' or even content this weekend. The general snobbish attitude was not something I have experienced at IHG properties before (and I have stayed at a LOT of them!)  For future trips to NYC you can bet I will be staying somewhere else. (For other trips, I will be back at IHG properties! And by the way, I typically ONLY post positive reviews, but this experience was terrible and I just had to explain lest others stay here.)",4,,
4,Christopher L.,"Seattle, WA",0,98,0,3.0,10/29/2018,"I don't know; hotels are hard to compare.The Radisson Martinique is very averageThe Tuscany is very nice, but not in a great location and gets in your face with its annoying business practices.The Belnord is very cheap (sometimes), but not at all nice.The Staybridge is very well-located and featureful, but pricey and not maintained as well as it should be.I loved the location by times square.  Being able to look right out at the tall buildings and see the glow from the billboards below late at night was a fun experience.  Looking down and seeing all of the cars below only to realize that I was actually staring at the top of another building was neat too.The room was cleanly enough, but the shower door did not close quite right, the TV's audio went out now and then, the basic TV functions worked unreliably at times (sometimes the TV even turned itself off), and the bathroom lights flickered (which I'll just pretend was to make the place a little spooky for Halloween).The garbage disposal in the kitchenette was almost impossible to operate (even the employee who came up to help me with it had trouble figuring out how).  For anyone wondering, you take the black thing in the drain and push down to activate the disposal.  If it doesn't work, pick it up, rotate it slightly, and try again.  Repeat until it works.They did charge a $5 housekeeping fee per night.  I hope that went directly to the housekeeper because otherwise it seems like a bogus fee (I mean, have you ever heard of a hotel that did not include housekeeping?).  They charged the fee even on days that they did not clean my room.Beyond that, my only complaints about the hotel itself relate to the slow elevator and my judgement that the room was fine rather than luxurious. If it costed 1/3 less than it did, I would give it a fourth star.",,,
5,John W.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,285,151,4.0,5/21/2018,"Very nice hotel. Clean room. Nicely furnished. Great staff. Elevators are a bit slow to get, especially during the check out and check in hours, which is very typical for these slim tower hotels in Manhattan. Breakfast was really good for a hotel and well stocked with fresh fruit, eggs, meats, cheese, breads, sweets and cereals. Very close to everything, with most theatres within a 10min walk. Surprisingly quiet for Times Square, which may be due to 40th St running West on this block. Also, there is not a lot of foot traffic out front, due to the bus depot occupying the other side of the block, so there are very few businesses on this part of 40th St. We had a very good experience here for 2 night stay and would definitely come back again.",1,,

7,Joseph K.,"Fraser, MI",28,220,47,4.0,8/28/2017,"Very good choice for staying in New York City.There were a number of good things about our stay. To begin with, when we checked in we were told that the room we booked (two beds) was unavailable.  The hotel accommodated us by giving us two rooms.  I couldn't believe it, and was so grateful for their thoughtfulness.The breakfast in the morning was wonderful, including real New York bagels.  Everyone in my family found something good to eat every morning we were there, and the breakfast staff was really on top of things.The hotel rooms were well appointed, and the beds were quite comfortable.  Good water pressure in the shower, and slightly better than average shampoo and soap were a nice touch also.The hotel was strategically convenient to the number of train stations, and the number of good dining options also.About the only bummer of the whole trip was the insane amount of money that we had to pay to park at the designated garage. This was due in part to the fact that we had a minivan to park.I don't know if I'll ever be back in New York City, but I would most definitely consider staying here if I do return.",1,1,
8,Joshua S.,"San Jose, CA",72,63,11,4.0,1/16/2018,"I stayed here for 4 nights. I found this to be the best compromise between price, quality and location. The location is really hard to beat, down a quiet street just a block from Port Authority and about 4 blocks from Times Square. There is a subway station steps from the entrance meaning quick and easy transit was within reach. There are tons of good food options in the area with no shortage of bars, restauraunts, and fast service places to chose from. The hotel was fully loaded with features we appriciated, such as a full bar, a fantastic free breakfast lounge, and an evening social hour with good food and free wine and beer. The guest laundry facility was really useful. I didn't get to try the onsite bar, but it seemed hip and fun. A store was also on site with the basics such as soda, snacks and medicine. Service was very good. Front desk was helpful and really nice, and always friendly when I returned late at night. Some of the other employees seemed tired/cranky but no one really bothered me. We found the service to be up to IHG standards. Rooms were comfortable and large for NYC standards, but tiny for Staybridge Suites Standards. Calling this a suite is a bit of a stretch, its more like a normal hotel room with a kitchen. Someone who has stayed at other staybridge properties would probably be disspointed. That being said, the room was still large for NYC standards and had everything I needed. It however was not a 5 star stay as some minor issues did plague the hotel. The rooms were a bit noisy and you could easily hear those moving around outside in the hallway. It wasn't too bad since there was only 10 rooms per floor, but those times people were in the hall it sounded like they were in the room itself. Street noise is to be expected, but it wasn't too bad on the 29th floor. Elevators were very slow during peak times, with waits up to 5 minutes from the 29th floor. The heater was a little noisy, but we rarely needed it. Lastly, the fridge was a little loud and the ice maker could easily wake you up in the middle of the night. For the price, it was fantastic. However, it was far from the nicest hotel I've stayed in.",3,,
9,Peter W.,"Bryan, TX",0,7,0,2.0,8/6/2018,"An older hotel...a real dump...bad elevators (too few)...carried luggage down 8 flights of stairs to get to airport on time...breakfast bar is dirty, unclean...rooms smelled, so had to get air freshner.  Carpet was dirty, and air conditioner made a lot of annoying noises...other than that....ugh",2,,
10,Hyun Gyu K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,0,3.0,5/12/2018,"I am not sure why this hotel has been rated four stars. I spent two nights at this Hotel with my wife and  four-month-old son. The condition of the hotel was bit older than what we saw in the picture. The major problem of this hotel was an extremely laud heater. The heater in our room was too laud to sleep.  It was turned on every 5 to10 mins to keep our room warm, and whenever it was turned on, my son was up together because of its noise. At the end, my wife and I were not able to sleep until late night and almost missed our flight next day. The only reason that I give this hotel three stars is due to its location near by time square. Other than that this hotel is not worth enough to get three stars.",1,,

Room was very clean, not serviced every day though, even when we left for the day and didn't leave a ""do not disturb"" sign. Gym was clean with necessary equipment for a gym that size.

14,Israel G.,"Denver, CO",202,324,1561,5.0,1/7/2016,"Got an amazing deal on 2 rooms for 2 nights! Make sure you ask for parking with the rate, or you'll get stuck paying $35 a night for cars, or $45 a night for an SUV. The hotel is super narrow, but it goes up 32 floors. I was on the 30th and had a great view of the Empire State Building. It's also located across the street from the subway, and 5 min walk to Times Square. Free breakfast (a real breakfast too) is included with the room, but make sure to get there earlier because it gets crowded fast. Not sure what another review was talking about when they mentioned the elevators and the staff using them? There are 3 elevators in the hotel, of course during rush hours it can be a wait; so leave earlier! One morning I did have to wait almost 10 min for the elevator, but I got a late start leaving the room (10am). There was someone who helped load and unload all my luggage from the car. That was a big help. The bar was overpriced, go somewhere else. The room was perfect. Full size fridge, pots and pans, utensils, stove, microwave, clean bathroom, and the closet space held 12 jackets (and it had like 7-10 hangars in). It was super easy to get to. After you come out of the Lincoln tunnel, stay straight for 1-2 lights and its on the right hand side. I'd come back to this place or recommend it in a heartbeat.",6,,

We arrived on July 17 four hours early before check-in and Amanda check us in to our hotel room which was amazing after a long flight. The room was great with the kitchenette and other kitchen supplies was awesome. The breakfast provides is also a plus with a variety of breakfast items to choose from. Lastly, the location is the best with the port authority accoss the street and 15 minute walk to time square and other great tourist site seeing. Will not regret staying here.",,,
17,Joy L.,"San Diego, CA",422,82,59,4.0,7/5/2017,"Stayed May 22nd-May 25th 2017. I was a little worried initially booking this hotel due to the location (a few reviews about the bus hub nearby) and the cleanliness, but I was impressed once we checked in. The room was excellent and quite large by New York standards. We used the microwave and the fridge our entire stay. My husband loves cold drinks, so it was quite nice not having to fill up a tiny ice bucket with drinks every day. The breakfast was better than expected (though one traveler stole my toasted bagel one morning, you can't blame the hotel for that). I was very impressed with the happy hour selection since we stayed on the weekdays. They one of my favorite beers on draft (Peroni). I know that it's not fancy, but I got to enjoy one or two pints a night with a small selection of food (brats were the best) and that completely made my night. I didn't buy a single drink in NY! The biggest flaw this hotel has is the elevator situation. It was a madhouse waiting for lifts at the busiest times of the day. I wish they would do what other tall hotels do and designate elevators for each section of the hotel. If you do stay here at peak time I recommend staying on a lower floor just so that you can walk if necessary. Special shout out to the gentleman who checks ids at happy hour. He was the nicest guy I met on our trip and he went out of his way to deliver friendly service. Wish I remembered his name.If we are ever staying in the area this will be our go-to hotel, particularly since it's so close to the theatres.",2,,
18,Jen L.,"Irvine, CA",659,240,244,4.0,10/16/2016,"-Moderately priced hotel.-Great amenities: kitchen, stove top, silverware, plates and cups-Descent gym with filtered hot and cold water if you want to refill your water bottles and not pay for water hehe-House cleaning functions to around 9pm which is awesome!-Great breakfast selection: gluten free foods, sausage and scrambled eggs, egg whites, pancakes and syrup, fruits, cereal and milk, oatmeal, bagels and cream cheese yum.. these foods tend to rotate too so you don't have the same thing everyday.4 stars because the free breakfast starts closing before the actual time it's supposed to end  so if you're like me and love sleeping in.. you might wake up with no food to eat downstairs. Also the elevators are kind of slow when you're in a hurry bc there are so many floors! One more thing is that the bathroom is right next to the bed.. so when someone uses it, you can smell everything!",4,1,1

When we got to the hotel, the check-in was pretty fast and we were given a room on the 9th floor. A higher floor would have been nicer but this is all they could accommodate and being so last minute, we couldn't complain. The room was decent sized considering it's NYC; was pretty surprised to see a full-size fridge, microwave, closet safe, oven, stove top, and full set of silverware/dishes/plates/cups/wine glasses. They had complimentary breakfast in the morning which was decent, can't complain about free, right? Your regular run of the mill continental hotel/motel breakfast. Overall, we would stay here again for the price we paid about $140. I heard there was a fitness center and rooftop bar (?) but we weren't able to check these out.",3,1,
25,Cat C.,"San Francisco, CA",1802,1627,2957,4.0,10/11/2015,"Everyone told me that under $200 a night in NYC is a steal!  Well...I didn't get a room at Staybridge for under $200 a night, but I searched high and low in different neighborhoods and by searching any bed bug reports and decided on Staybridge.  It's in super touristy but centrally located Times Square.  Only a couple blocks from the Port Authority in which we took the NYC Airporter bus to and from La Guardia.  Plenty of Duane Reade pharmacies around.  The rooms were bigger than most rooms in the city, at 300 square feet.  We booked prior to Staybridge, a room at The Row a couple blocks away, and while it was a lot cheaper; it was also over half the size smaller.  And mind you, we both had big luggages as this was the first leg of a 2.5 week trip.  So glad we cancelled that reservation!People at the front were pleasant and accommodated all my wishes (minus being further away from the elevator) and had a box of chocolates and Merlot for our honeymoon upon check in.  They also have a happy hour thing on certain nights with some comp food and drinks, and complimentary standard breakfast buffet every morning.  At times there was a little bit of a odd smell in the bathroom but nothing too disturbing.  The shower was teeny tiny and made me feel claustrophobic.  The elevators were pretty slow too as others mentioned.  But the room was clean and pretty quiet.  I never had trouble sleeping and we had a decent view as well.  And, gotta love the kitchen: fridge, stove, plates and utensils.  Save some money too buy searching for a IHG Friends & Family Code.  If you're looking for a clean (read not on the bed bug registry) centrally located place near theaters in Midtown, public transit (and airport transit) accessible, and steps away from Times Square yet still quiet and not too pricey, then I'd recommend Staybridge Suites Times Square.",12,3,5

Fruits, bagels, sausages, oatmeal, juice, muffins, tea, coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon... If you could think of it they would probably have it.

We were on the top floor with a beautiful view (there is a parking garage that allows you to see the river and buildings).The next day we got breakfast again and ran around the city hitting up some of the TJmaxxes.

No electrical outlet near the bed that proved to be very inconvenient. The lighting in the room wasn't very good. During our stay crowded elevators weren't a problem until we went to check out. Waited 20 minutes for an elevator to arrive with room on it. Finally asked for assistance and Pablo one of the bell hops was kind enough to come up to the 5th floor and carry my suitcase down for me.

29,Alexandra D.,"High Springs, FL",1,13,7,1.0,9/11/2017,"People usually leave review when they either happy or mad. Today I have to say, unfortunately, this is the worst hotel in Manhattan area, I ever stayed in 20 years. The rooms are nasty, cleaning is barely done, everything is covered with the dust, plus not working light lamps. Their lobby area is so uncomfortable, for such a huge hotel they have little tiny breakfast area, if you are in a rush to eat and get ready for work, make sure you have at least one hour ahead, cause the waiting time to get on elevator will be at least 15 minutes. In general, I wouldn't recommend this place neither for tourists neither for business, never for families. If there would be no stars reviews available , I will take this one star off as well.",,,
30,Rachel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",376,980,2614,4.0,10/10/2015,"Stayed here at the end of April 2015 and stayed on the 9th floor. We had a room on a higher floor, but it wasn't ready when we came for early check in. After flying from Vegas, we didn't want to wait around so we took the first available room on a lower floor.The room was great looking and the bed was really comfortable. We didn't use the in suite kitchen, save for the refrigerator & dishwasher. It's fully stocked with kitchen tools which was nice.Breakfast AND dinner are provided so we saved a lot of money on meals here. Dinner is different every night and included things like pizza or chef salads. Breakfast was your basic eggs, bacon, french toast etc. The dining room gets PACKED with French tourists (everyone was French.) so either go early or be prepared to eat standing up and to wait for the hot dishes to be replenished. We ended going early and taking our food up to our room.Unfortunately, the elevators are SLOW. Going any time around meal times means you'll wait 15+ minutes for one of the two elevators. We ended up just taking the stairs to avoid the wait. In the morning, you can hear a lot of people slamming their room doors, but other than that, it's quiet.In general, this hotel is in a fantastic location. Close to Time Square, restaurants, the subway & multiple Duane Reades.",2,2,
31,Melony R.,"Tampa, FL",541,512,2681,3.0,7/1/2015,"Our 4 day stay started out horrific, but the staff corrected our issues the next day. We came in late, so we were given the worst room you can get in this hotel...lowest floor in between all 3 elevators with a horrible view of a building with garbage. When we went to take a shower the full size tub was cool for NYC, but there was no shower curtain. To make matters worse the phone rang once around 1:30 am, so between that and the elevators as a light sleeper I started the next day extremely tired. The next day I called the front desk and they said they would move me to a much better room and all we had to do was ensure our bags were packed. We came back that night to a room on the 26th floor with a view of the Empire State Building to the left and a slight view of the Hudson River to the right. There was also Belgian chocolates and a small bottle of Merlot with an apology for the inconvenience! So with this hotel you are really paying for location. It's located in Hell's Kitchen on 40th ave between 8th and 9th st. Plenty of places to grab a bite and shopping is all over the place. Only a few blocks from the Javits Convention Center, which was the reason for my stay....and a few blocks from Times Square, Broadway and penn station. As for the comfort: the room has a full size refrigerator, microwave, kitchen sink and a cooktop that you must ask to have turned in if you plan on using it. The closet is tiny, which is expected in Manhattan. The shower in the rooms are extremely small so I recommend staying in the room in between the elevators if you require more space in the shower because it has a full tub...just be sure there's a shower curtain in place. The bed is extremely comfortable. All staybridge hotels have a complimentary breakfast. I've had a much better breakfast at a staybridge in Miami, but this wasn't bad.Not a bad stay for NYC especially if you need the kitchen.",9,6,9
32,Karla B.,"Chesterfield, VA",33,169,93,4.0,10/23/2016,"Impressed by a good stay at a reasonable price for a location so close to Times Square! Amenities could not be beat - free breakfast, so handy when you need to get going in the morning; free happy hour on Tues-Thurs with wine, beer and heavy hor d'oeuvres, enough to skip dinner until after a show. Tips: Breakfast on the 1st floor gets really busy, you can also have breakfast one floor down, much quieter. Happy Hour also gets busy, but you can take your drink/food to the bar area to find more (and better) seating.  Location - Broadway Theaters, Penn Station, Times Square, Rockefeller Center are all walking distance, 0.5-1 mile. Central Park is 1.5 mile away if you really want to walk. Room - we were on the 8th floor, there are only 7-8 rooms per floor, and came with a full mini-kitchen, wow. The room was not huge but comfortable for 2, with 2 double beds, a lounging chair and footstool, desk. As mentioned by others the shower was pretty small, to turn it on to warm up you end up splattering the floor. Our window didn't have much of a view but actually opened and worked.Lobby and service - great service at the front desk, very helpful. There are 3 elevators be sure to watch for all 3 if you are waiting, one is a little out of the line of sight, elevators can be slow at high-traffic times. There are 4 bathrooms off the lobby so you can come down, do breakfast, and have a final pit stop without having to ride all the way back up to your room. The wifi is free but makes you sign in and accept terms EVERY time you use it and drops out too often so I just used my own data.",1,1,1

Large flat screen TV, plus a full compact kitchenette. Quiet room, even across from the elevator.Staff at check-in, check-out were wonderful. Kept their cool in spite of a crowd.

37,Julie K.,"Evanston, IL",2,8,51,1.0,10/21/2015,"1. No update call I understood early-checkin was not possible on that time(11am). But one of the staff promised that she would call me when my room is available. But no one call me until 3:30pm. I went back to the hotel to see my room is available and the staff gave me a key right away. Why did not anyone call me? Why did she asked me to note my number?2. I kept my several items before check-in and received my luggage tag.  When I check-in, they could not find my items even though I showed them my tag.  One of strange lady asked me who I deliver my items to and where the guy placed my items. Should I had monitored their work? In addition, one of guy asked me to look for my items in their storage room. Obviously they did not keep my items properly. Wasted my time for check-in because of them. 3. The mattress sheet was very dirty I could tell the sheet was not changed.  It was only 1night so slept over the duvet cover instead of asking them to change my sheet because I already tired of their service at that time.",1,,
38,Alex L.,"Chicago, IL",572,32,0,5.0,5/24/2017,"Currently staying at this hotel and I was scared at first because of the 2 most recent reviews, but it's been nothing but great service. I mean it's NY, so there are a number of sketchy streets but be aware of your surroundings and you'll be fine. The FREE food isn't the highest quality but it's free so can't complain.

40,Katie S.,"Saint Paul, MN",26,58,3,4.0,1/10/2016,"This was a decent hotel for NY. One thing I was not expecting but ended up utilizing was the FREE HAPPY HOUR Tues-Thurs 5-7pm. Considering the cost of a beverage anywhere else nearby, this was much appreciated.In regards to the hotel room- it was nice although the walls are v thin! A person down the hall had a cough of some sort which would occasionally wake me up in the night. Other than that, there were no complaints :)",3,,
41,Katherine F.,"Austin, TX",744,212,40,5.0,11/29/2014,"I was very pleasantly impressed with this place! I was in the area for a tradeshow at the Javits, and have stayed in several hotels in this neighborhood. The Staybridge definitely isn't fancy/swanky, and has more of a budget/extended-stay vibe, but that just means more spare cash for food and fun. Lobby: Definitely the biggest con is that this place is crazy crowded. The check-in front desk is right at the entrance, meaning that during peak times, it's almost impossible to get in and out. There are dining areas and a bar within the first floor area, but those are always very crowded as well. Don't bother trying to get seats for more than 2 people during mealtimes and happy hour. On that note, though, the Staybridge offers free happy hour every day from 5-7. House white, house red, and [legit] beer on tap, plus water, juices, etc. along with a generous variety of different hors d'oeuvres every day. The food isn't that great, but it's passable and is very nice if you need a snack between lunch and fancy dinner later in the evening. Remember: Lobby/dining room. Crowded. Grab your drinks/snacks and skedaddle upstairs if you want quiet. Or stay if you want: There's free wifi, albeit fairly spotty service. I'll rate this as ""passable"" as well, although I definitely complaint free spotty wifi far less than I complain about paid spotty wifi. If you really like the dining area, come down in the morning for the free continental breakfast buffet. Again, nothing spectacular but everything is farm, you can help yourself to as much as you want, and the drinks are all there - milk, tea, coffee, water, and a variety of fruit juices. Just remember you're saving your pennies for the things you *really* want to eat, many of which aren't going to be available until 11 a.m. anyway. The rooms: Each room has a full-sized fridge (!!) as well as a kitchen sink. I want to say that there's even a hotplate or small burner in the rooms as well, but maybe I'm making that up (definitely call and ask if this matters to you). There were two queen-sized beds in my room, each with at least 4 pillows, and a small note on the beds that said more were stored in my closet if I wanted them. Very adequate and thoughtful storage; large desk; well-lit; great bathroom with very hot, strong water stream in the shower, and a magnifying makeup mirror. The view was nothing to write home about, but this area just isn't that visually exciting in the first place. Honestly, I really enjoyed my room and slept really well at night - particularly impressive given the fact that I didn't get much sleep due to working hard and late. Sound disturbance from my neighbors was absolutely nil. I happen to know our conference discount rate for the room was $169/night. If I had to stay in this area on a personal visit, I'd definitely plunk for the Staybridge over any other Times Square-region hotel. Best bang for my buck, by far! (In contrast, I stayed at two ""trendier"" hotels the last two times I visited, both much closer to the $300/night mark. Both times, portions of the hotel were being renovated so elevators were out of commission or scaffolding distracted from the exterior, etc. and people shambled about EVERYWHERE.)",6,,

45,Jay S.,"Singapore, Singapore",27,85,100,2.0,10/1/2015,"This was a visit that started out on the wrong foot and seemed to just keep stumbling throughout. Upon check in there was no recognition of my Spire elite status, the new higher than platinum status. More frustrating was the fact that there was no recognition of my multiple advance requests and notes for a room with two beds. Later when my platinum friend checked in she was upgraded to the top floor double bedded room, with no prior requests, just for being such a premier guest. When I go down and ask why I wasn't given such a room based on my requests, I find out that IHG corporate and the hotel don't communicate so they had no idea about my multiple requests. I get switched to the two bedded room and proceed to move rooms myself. When I first arrived there was no bell staff assistance, or even available carts to unload the car. Throughout the visit the bell-staff was present, singing and entertaining, they were entertaining, and I am sure have made many people's visit enjoyable, but don't call the harmonizing men with drumsticks and guitars your bell-staff call them your entertainers.The rooms were small, it is NYC, but nicely equipped, with full kitchen services, and the internet was fairly quick. The shower was frustrating, by design the shower head resets to a fine mist setting when the shower is turned off, requiring repeated wet adjustments. Additionally I initially thought that getting the correct temperature was a balancing act with the slightest twitch wildly changing the temperature, I later realized that it was actually just a constantly changing temperature without any touching required.Housekeeping service was disappointing. On the first day they replaced a bath bar of soap and a hand bar of soap with new unopened soaps. We just opened those the day before, really quite wasteful to replace after less than one day. On day two they removed the bath soap, left the hand soap and offered no replacements. No logical procedure I could follow. Additionally on the second day of housekeeping our kitchen sink was clogged, it wasn't when we left it was when we returned, and there was no note from maintenance. I initially noticed because the sink was caked with dirt and debris as you would see in a slowly draining sink. Debris of things we had not put in the sink. Not good. There have been many complaints about the lifts. It is a small NYC hotel, there is only so much they can do, and I would guess 10-20% of their floor space is dedicated to the elevators already. While I wouldn't advise converting one lift to staff only, it is very frustrating when you are waiting to get a lift and one shows up full of on the job staff. I would plan at least 15 minutes for getting out in the morning to start your sightseeing. Oh and one left broke down while I was there, on the lift, dropping half a floor multiple times. That'll wake you up.The breakfast was nice enough, but really chaotic, the staff was doing all they could to replace food and keep it clean, it is just a lot of people. They open up the attached bar and sidewalk seating for breakfast in the morning, unfortunately they have no signage or staff in the breakfast area directing you out there.As an elite member I was given a late checkout 'til 2pm, very nice. I have traveled and worked in the industry long enough I should have known to stop by the desk and ask for my key to be updated after noon on checkout day, but I foolishly didn't and paid the price having to make a lengthy round trip to the room waiting for lifts both ways. One of the staff members walking the halls was kind enough to let my wife into the room while she waited. There wasn't any ID verification performed, so while very kind and helpful with a screaming baby, not very secure and sadly often makes for the beginning of a cautionary news story.When checkout time came around we self-loaded a cart and headed downstairs and enjoyed the entertainment while waiting to be checked out. One of the desk clerks was nice enough to take my folio while I waited for her to finish with the person in front of me. Unfortunately she checked me out, without letting me update the credit card on file requiring a reversal and reposting. With all of the neighborhood building and street construction we were pleased when we found a nice large taxi to help us get to the airport. In order to not block all of the traffic behind him he did pull up on the curb to help us load the baggage. This is apparently not good in NYC and all of the staff came out to voice their disapproval, entertainers, front desk staff, even management. They were so busy talking with each other about the ridiculousness of the situation they didn't have the time to try and guide the driver into a better position or help us load the taxi to leave quicker, just talk and snap photos.",5,1,
46,Dave S.,"Guelph, Canada",0,10,6,4.0,12/22/2014,"Stayed here Dec 2014 for 5 nights.Room was a decent size for two people.  The biggest problem was the lack of closet space for jackets, suits & shirts.  Far too small for 2 people staying 5 nights.  Wall hooks along the entry way would help alleviate this shortcoming. The bathroom was smallish, but laid out well.  Limited counter space.  Our biggest concern was the elevators, after having read so many negative things about them.  They were nowhere near as bad as has been portrayed.  Our longest wait was about 5 minutes.  The majority of times, 1-3 minutes.  Now more often than not they were very full, but they were quick.The kitchen was great.  Full size fridge, adequate facilities for reheating leftovers (if you want).The location was outstanding.  With an subway pass we could get to Broadway and 42nd underground, with only the first 45 seconds being above (while we travelled into the PABT).No problems with the ""seedy"" porn joints and parole office mentioned in other reviews.Jamie gave some outstanding help moving our luggage down the last day.  Parking cost me about $32 a day up on 43rd (a 5 minute walk).Good food around here.  Would definetly stay again.  Be aware that a garbage can is left on each floor.  It was in front of our door 3 of 5 nights.",2,,
47,Ward K.,"Honolulu, HI",300,338,1594,4.0,9/6/2015,"One of our friends had stayed here last year and told us how much he liked it so we decided to stay here during our time in the city.  I'm a little tired from all the walking we did so I will just cut to the chase and list my Pros and Cons.Cons:- Sometimes the elevators take forever.  My suggestion for those who stay on lower floors who are able to walk, that they take the stairs as it will be a lot faster than waiting for the elevator.  If you do take the stairs, take the B stairs as it will take you to the lobby while the A stairs takes you to the lower lobby.  - The maids would come into our room even though we had the do not disturb sign hanging outside.- Closet space is kind of small.  Not enough room to hang my wife's and my clothes.- Rooms on the lower floors might be a little noisy at times.  ( we had a room on a lower floor but paid to upgrade to a higher floor.  Yes it was worth it)Pro:- Happy Hour.  Yes I said it, they have a cool happy hour.  It is from Tuesday - Thursday from 5-7pm.  The food changes from day to day.  It varied from nachos, hotdogs, pita and humas with a salad bar.  They even had an open bar of Stella and Bud Light on tap with red and white wine.  They also had coffee, tea, hot chocolate, soda and water.  - Complimentary breakfast from 6:30-10am daily.  Things from scrambled eggs, egg whites, (meat changed daily from sausage links, sausage patty, turkey bacon, etc.) to your traditional cereal, toast, bagels, oatmeal etc.  Yes there is coffee to help you start your day.- 24 hour workout room for those that need to get their fitness on.- Free Wifi.  - Laundry room that is open 24 hours.  Only downside is that you are sharing it with the rest of the guests in the hotel.  Personally I would keep an eye on my clothes.  Sorry I'm just a little paranoid someone might borrow some of my stuff.  - This hotel is close to Times Square.  Walking distance to Times Square, Theater District.  - -- Subway entrances is close by as well.- It is right next to the Port Authority.  This is a major plus if you are seeing a game like we did.  We caught the bus that took us right to the Metlife Stadium in New Jersey to see the football game.  It was so fast and easy.  - Most of the staff was nice and friendly.  Yes there was some that was curt with me but for the most part they were very informative and helpful.- Kitchenette was nice to have.  - They have a pantry for all your needs from snacks to aspirin.  It is located on the side of the check in desk.- Nice and comfy beds, room size is on the bigger side compared to other NYC hotels.",5,2,3

Updated review","The hotel offers quite a bit but it's no huge bargain either so I figured for the price its an average experience. The pros -Decent sized room for NYCKitchenetteCleanBreakfast offers a great selectionPantry for convenience items and snacks Free wifi w no passwordThe cons - (make your own judgments as I know most of these are aesthetic and I can be picky)The elevators are awful. Always waiting and always crowded. There are technically 3 lifts but since the one to the left is on the other side of the path I think most people don't even see it.Overall design in rooms and hallways is not modern. They're clean but not cool. The hallways look like they converted an old apartment. It's damn LOUD in the hallways! Everything can be heard including the constant SLAMMING of the doors as they close when housekeeping is making their rounds The closets are a joke. Basically a foot long closet rack sticking toward you. For a hotel that offers a kitchenette and laundry that would seemingly encourage longer stay guests you should have a proper closet for hanging wardrobe. UPDATE: apparently some other closets have a proper left to right wardrobe bar since I saw one in another room, but since this was denied by the front desk clerk when I inquired I am now even more annoyed.They have a great AV plug in by the desk and TV but not an outlet near the bed or nightstand.Not a fan of the iPad ""business center"" - there's just some things you need to do on a proper laptopBasic amenities and no bathtub",,,

50,Gigi G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",56,4,0,2.0,4/7/2017,"I was on vacation with my son for spring break we got to the hotel really early (8:45am) I asked if I could do an early checked in and the ladies in the front desk said to wait until 11am my son was tired from flying 5 hours so we just decided to wait... I checked again around 11:30 as they said and the room was not ready and they would called me when it was ready, I waited there for more than 6 hours until finally I went back again (3rd time) and Diana gave me my key without hesitation. Breakfast is free, is just ok: Cerial, fruit, toast, you know a regular continental breakfast. Melinda who was a kiss ass, selecting certain type of guests was a fake lady who would pretend to be funny and nice to those who she think would get something in return, begging them to please do a review so the hotel would get a 5 stars. I was there for 4 night and not even once she great me or my son. In our room the housekeeper just clean the room the first day, the next three days she just fix the beds and put ""new towels"" and they smell really bad. other than that the room was ok, comfortable and quiet. Location is great couple blocks from times square, and the subway is across the street. the area is nice and safe, not to loud. but I don't think I would try it again for the bad experiences I had with the staff.",3,,
51,Jill F.,"Manorville, NY",209,255,194,5.0,4/10/2014,"I found this hotel on expedia.com for a crazy good deal. It was the first time I had ever booked a hotel on my own, haha. Was definitely nervous but it ended up being such a good choice! At the time I got a standard suite with a king size bed and it was only $165 for two people!! Insanely good because not only was the hotel one of the cheapest choices in the area on expedia, but it was so nice and clean and it even had a mini kitchen in the hotel room (none of the other hotel choices had that).HOTEL: Great location, very close to Times Square. Very nice inside, nicely decorated. Small lobby with a bar right next to it. Cool waterfall windows blocking the bar from the lobby area. Bar was cute, pricey though ($11 for small cocktail drink). Free breakfast buffet offered in the morning until 11am. Not much food though, there were a lot of choices but literally not much food (a lot of empty trays, needed refilling). But hey, its free. There is also a gym available, although I didn't check that out.ROOM: Our room was on the 42 floor and was so nice! King size bed, 40 in flat screen TV right across from the bed. Average/clean bathroom. Free wireless connectivity. Very clean room and comfy bed. You could see the empire state building from our window which was a cool surprise. The little mini kitchen was so cute, had a fridge, microwave, stove, sink, and even pots and pans and plates etc for you to use. Actually came in handy because later at night we took our dinner leftovers and reheated them and ate them haha. The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the window didn't have room darkening curtains. Just sheer white, sort of see through ones. So in the morning it was very bright.I would definitely return here, and actually was hoping to in a month or so. However, it seems the $165 deal on expedia is gone and now the rooms are around $300. So perhaps I won't be returning too soon.",5,,
52,Stella M.,"Los Angeles, CA",323,583,1013,5.0,1/27/2014,"Loved this hotel in NY!It's situated right near Times Square on 40th st btw 8th & 9th Ave. Perfect location if you're in NY for the first time or if you're visiting again. The rooms are spacious for New York. I was pleasantly surprised. There's a kitchen with each room so you can cook or heat up left overs if you need to. The bathroom was clean and was up kept well by their cleaning staff. Their complimentary breakfast is awesome! The best I've ever seen for free breakfast! They are open from 7am to 11am. One downside is their elevators. They have 3 small elevators. They are usually not a problem except for the mornings when people are checking out. It can take a while for the elevator to reach your floor and sometimes when they do it's filled with guests that are checking out... which means they have their whole luggage on board as well. If you have impatience for these kind of things than you may not like this hotel. I say either stay really high up or stay on the lower floors so you can take the stairs. Overall, I loved this hotel and will definitely stay here again for their decent price.",3,,1

Updated review","Continued Excellence for a Jewel among IHG Properties""A few years ago I discovered this IHG property in the middle of Times Square and have raved about its service, location and value for the money. After 2 recent stays in March, I have to report that it still ranks as a jewel and a place definitely worth staying not only if you are a long term stay visitor, but even short stays as I normally am. For Priority Club members check this property out!Service is outstanding and under the oversight of GM SKC Chiew who continues to run an excellent operation. I was a bit worried to find out a past FOM had left but was happy to find out that Assistant GM Donna Robinson is still there and as usual ensured my requested room was available, took care of my welcome and check-out and checked-in to make sure my stay was comfortable..which it was. SKC please give me early warning if Donna is leaving anytime soon as I will be worried.The breakfasts and evening snacks offered several times during the week is a stand-out and the food served at the right temperature and the refreshments available. The staff is amazing at clearing and finding tables for everyone (PS folks, tip when you get this service). My favorite friendly excellent hostess is Shonna and she is downstairs at breakfast time. If you are down there, say hi to her. A reminder to management, please keep her on and expand her area of responsibility.Location is excellent close to everything. if you are driving and take the Lincoln Tunnel, you drive right onto the Street for the hotel and while you unload, get directions a few blocks away for a discounted rate. If you have to take any buses from the Port Authority it is next door. Subway stops close by and anything you want to eat on 8-10th Avenues. A few blocks to Times Square.Another excellent stay and I thanks Ms. Robinson, Shonna and all the staff for an awesome stay.",,,
54,Lynn H.,"Calgary, Canada",41,330,148,5.0,4/15/2012,"Clean and spacious (for a NYC hotel anyway.) I love the staff and how friendly they are. The kitchenette with fridge, stove, microwave and food disposal unit came in handy for our leftovers!!  There's a desk area and a HD flat screen TV.  The breakfast buffet was nothing special but it was nice to have anyway for a quick snack in the morning before our outings. The hotel was new (or renovated) so it smelled clean. I don't care if a hotel is old as long as it is clean!!Cons:- Our shower didn't really work. We had to pull really hard on the lever and jiggle it for a bit before the shower head stayed on.- The 3rd night we were there we forgot to tip in the morning before we left. We came back to no extra towels and a missing bathroom mat. Sheesh!!- Breakfast buffet had yucky eggs!These cons are minor details in comparison to the rest of the experience we had.  It's a bit off the beaten path and looks a bit shady. It's right across the street from Port Authority bus terminal making it super convenient to catch the bus to Woodbury Commons Premium Outlet.  And we took the Newark Express which dropped us off approximately a block away.  Walking to Times Square was quick and took only 10-15 minutes.  The concierge helped us hail a cab.  I'd definitely stay here again if I cared to be around Times Square (which I don't.)All in all, a very nice hotel for a fair price considering it is NYC and it is close to Times Square.",2,,

Because it rocks!Fantastic location within walking distance to Broadway shows, Times Square, and a few subway stops. The area itself is perfectly fine and not sketchy at all like some other reviewers mentioned. The three elevators were fast and we never waited for more than a few minutes.The rooms were good sized for NY and the kitchenette was excellent. We stored some drinks and snacks which was really handy. The bed was comfortable and there was almost no street noise.Though we didn't have a good view, that didn't bother us at all. You're in NY, go outside! :)I never at the breakfast but it looked pretty legit when i walked by.Though the advertise happy hour socials, they're only during the week since they're catering towards business travelers then.The price, location, amenities, and service can't be beat!  Highly recommended.",2,1,
61,Jessica G.,"Reston, VA",70,98,28,3.0,2/9/2015,"I think this place has potential to be a phenomenal hotel. It seems that a good amount of reviewers had a stellar experience but my stay was a series of unfortunate events. The first night I was exhausted from traveling and working. I was also really looking forward to taking a shower. I stepped inside and was enjoying washing up until... I saw that there were long hairs on the shower's tile wall and what appeared to be a massive booger!!! Keep in mind that I can't see well without my glasses and had no way of seeing this until it was too late. Needless to say my shower was ruined. I do have photographic evidence as disgusting as that may be. Next issue... At 2:44 am on a Sunday, 2 men were talking obnoxiously loud in the hall. They were so loud that they woke me up and most likely every body else on the floor. Talk about being incredibly inconsiderate to those of us sleeping and have to go to work in the morning! When the guys still weren't using ""inside voices"" I finally opened my door and asked them to be please be quiet. As soon as I closed my door, one of them called me a bitch. I couldn't even stickup for myself because as soon as I went to open my door again the elevator opened and they left.So... After the loud a-hole experience, it took me quite sometime to fall back asleep. When I'm finally back to a nice slumber, the refrigerator in my room started making a loud ticking noise... Like a clock! Think about Captain Hook being tormented by clocks... That's how I felt. It was too loud and repetitive to sleep, so I called the front desk for some help. The lady sent the engineer to check on it. All the engineer said he could do was unplug my refrigerator... I had food that would spoil without refrigeration, so I had to go out and buy earplugs. Seriously!Last issue... I always keep the do not disturb sign on the door. I want the hotel room to feel as homey as possible during my stay and I enjoy my privacy. Wouldn't you know it? I come back after a long day of hard work to see that my sign is gone. No sign means people entered my room, took away the homey feel, and invaded my privacy. I definitely had issues with my stay here but there are positives to this place. Most of the staff are friendly and do a good job. The hotel room itself and quite nice and reasonably priced for New York. The breakfast is also way above average compared to other places. I would definitely stay here again, but I would hope for a better experience.",6,2,1
62,Geo B.,"Clementon, NJ",0,30,3,1.0,5/18/2017,First of all I want to start this off by saying I am at spire elite member of the IHG rewards club. I prefer to stay at Holiday Inn's because I enjoy the reward system but the Staybridge hotel in Manhattan time square is horrible. I experienced for two days water pressure that would jump from nothing to 100% and go from steaming hot to freezing cold. They give you a free breakfast but I wouldn't give the food to a homeless person in the quality of service in this hotel for tonight $900 day was deplorable. Stay away from Staybridge,,,
63,Al N.,"Medford, MA",0,9,0,2.0,6/20/2016,"If you stay on the 2 to the 10 floor expect to walk to first floor waited  20 min 4 times and every time the the one elevator came it was to full to get into,going up was not as bad. when you walk in to the entrance you have to pass the smoking section, not bad if you smoke, our room was ok but my daughters room complained the shower was very hard to use corner unit so water shot out when you first turned it on,it is across from the bus station and a few doors down from the probation office.",1,,
64,Miles N.,"San Francisco, CA",2,27,2,5.0,4/16/2016,"This is a great place to stay FOR A REASONABLE PRICE in the heart of Times Square and experience the true NYC.  You can, of course, get a nicer hotel for much more $$$, but this one has some things going for it that make it special.  I stayed here 4 nights in April 2016 with my spouse and a teen child while visiting colleges.  The hotel is over 30-stories tall. The location, with the main door facing north at the south side wall of the bus terminal is actually quiet, since it is away from the east-side terminal doors around the corner.  It is near subway and bus stops that can take one all over the city.  The $18 bus to the Newark airport departs and arrives at the adjacent bus terminal (from an alley on 41st St.) a half block away, so getting here, and checking out and getting to the Newark airport is super easy.  You just roll your luggage around the corner and you are set. Free breakfast every day, and free beer and wine (Monday thru Thursday) (plus light food like salad and hot dogs) in the evenings, make it an easy place to start or end the day. Very nice staff and the ability to print boarding passes in the lobby. Downsides: rooms are very small and the shower is smallish. However, the bathrooms have great, strong ventilation and everything is clean. The beds are super comfortable and each room has a larger-than-expected refrigerator.  There is a dishwasher and cooktop, although you are relegated to a surprisingly short countertop of kitchen space as you enter the room (you will be surprised by how small the kitchenette area is). You really can't cook on the burners (seriously, it is so small and odd it is like cooking in your bedroom). But, the microwave is useful for reheating take-home food or doggie bags.  Bottom line: Good bargain if you just need a safe, clean space to sleep and reheat food once in a while. Not really a true ""suite"" hotel, but highly functional and provides all the essentials for civilized stays in Times Square.",1,,1

66,Joe H.,"Vacaville, CA",3,45,0,4.0,7/21/2016,Stayed here on vacation from Nothern California for 3 nights. My wifes birthday which I told them at front desk. They gave us a nice view of the Greyhound station on 9th floor. They did give us a bottle of wine but would of been nice if we had a decent view. Aside from the drug addicts living in the streets it was a great location. Close to everything accept Central Park. Subways are very close within one block. All the Theaters are within walking distance. And Time Square is right there. Rooms were clean and decent enough sized. Shower is small so if your a big person watch out for that. Free Breakfast was also great.,,,
67,C B.,"Haslet, TX",1,18,0,4.0,3/14/2015,"This was a good hotel.  Location was very close to Times Square and Broadway. It was easy to walk to most of our destinations or to the subway from here. We were able to walk to: Kinky Boots musical, Times Square, the Wendy Williams Show, the Nightly Show, Central Park, & the Empire State Bldg from here.  We had to take the subway to: SoHo, Wall Street, China Town, Ground Zero, & Statue of Liberty. The complementary breakfast was very nice. It was, however, extremely crowded when you got up later.  So, we had to get up early in order to eat in peace. One morning, we ate outside in the loud manhattan street just to have somewhere to sit. But, it was still nice to have complementary breakfast.The happy hour was also nice.  We were only there in time to attend it one night though. I even took some wine back to my room to enjoy. The rooms also had a refrigerator, kitchenette, & cookware.  However, I never knew where to look to buy groceries to cook my own meal, so we ate out lunch and dinner. There was sometimes a long wait for the elevators, as other reviewers mentioned. The hotel staff was also very friendly and customer service oriented. I'd definitely return here.",1,,1
68,Katy P.,"Severn, MD",86,110,60,4.0,1/6/2015,"We were here the weekend after New Year's so it was pretty hectic. The lobby is small so it is claustrophobic inside. They are in the middle of doing some renovations, so breakfast was a bit of a mess, and the elevators were impossible to use during checkout time (constantly full and stopping on every floor). My complaints end here. These are minor inconveniences for an awesome room in an awesome location for an awesome price. Yes, that much awesome. The bed was so comfortable. The décor was really nice and calming. Everything was CLEAN and FRESH looking. I love hotel rooms that are suites so you can prepare some of your own meals/keep leftovers to save money. AND FREE BREAKFAST?!?!?! Yes. Yes. Yes. The only complaint about the room is that the shower was really tiny, but it's NYC, and you have a kitchen in there, what can you do? It was fine. The location cannot be beaten for the price. The street itself is a little dingy, but it's busy so you don't feel unsafe even at midnight, and the subway is close and Times Square is right down the street. If you are coming in on a bus, this is the spot. The Port Authority bus terminal is LITERALLY right outside the hotel. Seriously, just jaywalk yourself across one lane of slow-moving traffic and you're there. Excellent. Easy walk (or one subway stop) from Penn Station as well. We will definitely stay here again.",2,,
69,Daniel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,87,41,5.0,5/7/2013,"On our first visit to Times Square, my brother and I stayed at this amazingly great hotel.  It's super clean and offers more amenities than needed for an extended stay. It includes a kitchen with refrigerator, stove, and even dishes. It's like having your own apartment while you stay in New York.  Where else are you going to get a kitchen in your New York room?  The room was clean enough for me to feel comfortable bear foot.   Rooms are super quiet. At a time when you hear about dirty hotel rooms, this is a diamond in the rough. Breakfasts are included. This hotel is probably the best you can find for the money. Here is my video tour of the room.  The hotel is within walking distance of the main part of Times Square.  However, if you don't like walking it may be further than you would prefer to venture out.  youtube.com/watch?v=CDZU…",1,,

My boyfriend and I went downstairs...they were very apologetic and put us in a different room. Great...the second room was much better. Everything was clean except the towels...they were a little worn and had orange residue on them...but whatever...we asked for more towels.OK, this is why they are good...we just wanted to stay in on Sunday...so we never left the room to receive room service...not only did they stop by once...they stopped by like 3 times. The maid said...it's ok...I just want to change the garbage...do you need any towels...? She gave us an additional set as well. It was a bit annoying...but I like that. The shower water wouldn't drain so I probably have a foot fungus but the shower was ok. My boyfriend liked the free breakfast...I was too hungover to get anything. If you are looking for an affordable, inexpensive home away from home..then this is the place. Dishwasher...a real refrigerator..(not a mini fridge bs that can't fit leftovers), a dishwasher...a nice little counter top to eat or apply makeup...a little stove/hot range...kitchen sink with stocked dishes, silverware and tupperware...then this is the place!

73,Lance F.,"Omaha, NE",186,349,247,5.0,7/14/2012,"We just got back from a 4-night stay in NYC at the Staybridge Suites and we were literally sad to leave the city and this hotel.  Our trip was a success and a large part of that success was a great stay at this property.  The location itself was great as it was an easy trip to Times Square, the subway station, and plenty of dining options.  I have seen a couple of other reviews that mention that they felt unsafe walking to and from the hotel and I can say we never experienced that.  I was with my wife and two sons (ages 9 and 7) and though you do walk by a couple of adult themed locations on 40th, I never once had a doubt about the safety of my family. We stayed in room 2403 and had a great view of the city.  We also never heard any of the street noise you might encounter with a lower room.  Then again, you are in NYC and the street noise is part of the experience.  But, if that is a concern you may want to ask for a room on a higher floor to get away from street noise and enjoy the view.  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room.  I have stayed in NYC hotels that barely held a queen bed so this one was huge by comparison.  There is a full size fridge, a stovetop, and microwave.  So, if you wanted to save money on food, you can certainly do it by bringing your own.  We had two full beds, a desk and a nice flat screen TV.  In the bathroom, the shower was a little small but we made it work and had plenty of warm water.  The maid service was timely and efficient, as well. As for amenities, the free wifi is nice!  They have a free laundry in the basement if you need to get some clothes washed.  One warning, the washers and dryers fill up quickly.  So, you may want to do your laundry very early or very late.  The free breakfast was serviceable but not great.  They had eggs, sausage/ham, toast, bagels, juice and milk.  We actually ate other places most mornings as the breakfast didn't do much for us but it's an option.  On Tuesday through Thursday from 5-7, they have an evening reception with food, beer, and wine.  They had quesadillas, tacos, and burgers/brats while we were there.  Definitely check those out!  Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the middle of it all in the heart of the city for a great rate.  It will be our only option if we decide to take another trip to NYC.  Check it out!",11,,3
74,Danielle C.,"Floral Park, NY",33,17,1,1.0,1/11/2017,"If I could give this hotel zero stars I would . I had booked a hotel a month in advance through the IHG website. Now I had booked this hotel because I had stayed there before and me and my boyfriend loved it so we figured it was perfect for our anniversary. Now when I got the email confirmation for my reservation it said for a grand total 134$. So fast forward to check in day I get there and for some reason they are trying to charge me 180. I was like wait what? Then she decides to tell me that they never got a charge for the hotel, just my reservation. And I was like how is that possible and of course they had no answer. But they were so quick to try and charge me without explaining anything first. Now I know part of it's my fault for not making sure the charge was on my credit card but it's also their fault. They should have tried to accommodate us since I did have a email reservation for 134$. So me and my bf drove back home. So thanks for making us a trip waste on our anniversary and for trying to over charge. Definitely not going back.",,1,
75,Casey C.,"San Francisco, CA",78,78,7,3.0,10/12/2014,"This incredibly skinny hotel obviously serves the tourists, and it's a good option if you have a family and want to cook your own food to save some cash. Full kitchenette style. Not as great for business travelers (i.e., me on this weekend), but it's a decent place. I stayed for three nights. First night was a serious disaster on the second floor. It appears to be the ghetto of this hotel so avoid the second floor at all costs. Dumpy decor. Everything seemed to be half-broken. Every 20 minutes the air conditioner would work itself up with an increasingly louder knocking noise until it crashed -- and started all over again. Not possible to sleep through this. No blackout curtains in my room. They just didn't exist. I had to rig up something with the hangers (that have clips) from the closet, Macgyver-style. The room smelled like gasoline from all-night construction outside of the hotel. Possibly the worst night in a hotel I've ever experienced, although that's a high bar. I was going to leave and find a new hotel, but they moved me for the other two nights, and it was like a completely different hotel. 17th floor was nice and comfy. Everything was 100% nicer up there. Air conditioner worked like it's supposed to. Design of these rooms are funky all around, so expect that your shower will just spray pools of water on the floor of the bathroom, but a lot of hotels with boutique pretensions have goofy design details. The elevators are interminable. I timed it. I waited 18 minutes to get an elevator one day. Didn't eat the buffet because I was too busy, but apparently it's a big selling point. It's got to be a free-for-all that's probably not fun to maneuver. But, I get it. Free food. All in all, this is a hit-or-miss hotel depending on which floor you stay on, but it's probably a good choice if you want to stay near Times Square for a tourist visit.",3,,

Staff were polite.Have to knock a star off for the shower and ""business center"" though. The shower head was old and filled with calcium. It was also cheap to begin with so it basically felt like a light drizzle seeping from the head rather than any sort of shower.The business center is a series of ipads (WHY IPADS OF ALL THINGS?!) and only two even worked. Neither connected to or worked with the printer (the reason I was using them). Luckily the front desk staff were nice and printed the item for me.Not really good or bad, but don't expect any sort of view. It's convenient to Times Square, though.",,,

I am 19 years old, and shouldn't be having back pains and I can confidently say it is because of the beds. The showers are very poorly made. Ours was leaking from the original pipe the shower head was connected too and it was not removable to easily clean your whole body. Shower itself is very small confined space, and the range that the water can hit you is very small. Okay place overall, and towels smelled.",1,,

81,Shane S.,"Salem, OR",45,353,200,4.0,6/22/2012,"Review for Room #301, stayed June 13th to June 17thPros: Good Location next door to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Professional & Friendly Staff, Contemporary Rooms with Full Kitchen, Complimentary Hot BreakfastCons: Lobby Tile Construction throughout the stay.My wife & I thoroughly enjoyed our 5 nights here. The location on 40th, between 8th and 9th Ave, were easy walking distance (10 min) to the heart of Times Square. With the back-door entrance (closed 9 PM to 6 AM) of the Port Authority Bus Terminal right across the street from the hotel, you can walk in cool a/c comfort for two blocks to 42nd Street, while bypassing the cars & foot traffic.From check-in to check-out, all Staybridge Suites staff were friendly, helpful and professional. When I needed an extra sheet or luggage brought downstairs, they were there knocking on our door in minutes.My only reason, for not giving this property a 5-star rating is because of Lobby Tile construction during our entire stay. Because of limited elevator access, we normally walked up and down the stairs for quicker access. We felt kind of sorry for the elderly or guests staying on the higher floors, because they had no choice but to wait. I may sound petty, but when you travel 5000 miles and fly non-stop for 9 1/2 hours, from the 50th state, the little things do get to you.To end on a more positive note, I don't want the Lobby Tile construction project to be a deterrent in you, not considering  to stay at this property. By all means, my wife and I definitely recommend this property and will let our family & friends know. All you need to know is Full size refrigerator, Full size coffee maker, Counter Top Stove and Large Flat Screen TV...",3,,

Also they have FREE breakfast it's actually a buffet style setting, waffles, eggs, fresh fruit, coffee, toast, bacon, etc......The service is TRULY Unbelievable! the Staff really caters to your needs, they won't let you carry anything....they practically carry you to your room.  The rooms are super nice, beds are cozy, bathroom so sleek w/high end products.  The lobby has a nice waiting room which is HUGE they always have the fireplace going w/Plasma TVs on the wall and Big comfy Sofas.  All in walking distance of Times Square.  Check out this Place you won't be disappointed!  It's absolutely the best in New York.I was really sad to leave this place.",7,,3
83,Jen D.,"Haverhill, MA",36,181,7,3.0,2/27/2015,"Very clean room room, good design, nice office furniture. Appreciated the quality office chair for working. Having a kitchenette is a real luxury when you're on the road all the time. My biggest issue was the combo of the mattress and the pillows. The mattress was very firm, as were the pillows. All pillows were of equal firmness (VERY firm) and quite thick. Some hotels provide pillows of varying firmness/softness levels, which I think is very smart. I ended up not using the pillows here at all because even just one under my head ended up hurting my neck and back--enough that I kept waking up and having to adjust. I'm not young, but neither am I old and I was hobbling to the office the next day.The room was relatively cheap, else this would be a much lower rating because the bedding is the most important part of a hotel room. If those things were fixed, this place would be 4.5 stars. (Lots of noise from the Port Authority, but hey, also very convenient! Ear plugs are your friend in NYC.) Their breakfast buffet is quite decent, but the elevators are slow enough that you'll want to take the stairs regardless if you're not staying on a top floor.",,,
84,Jackie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,0,2.0,6/1/2016,"I've stayed at Staybridge Suites before and yelped this location prior to booking. I booked a double for this past Memorial Day weekend. This experience was definitely not one of their better moments. The first room (yep first room) was very dated. Carpet threads were coming out of floor; the bathroom lighting was dim (which made me notice the crooked light fixture); the wall paint was chipped; the shower shelf was loos and leaning down; and the light fixture near bed would dim without anyone touching. I took that one to be nearest AC, which was in the corner against the wall. The bed however had a major lean/dip, as though it was in dire need of rotation or replacement.  We asked for another room.The second room was only a little better...both beds were away from the wall, my new bed only sagged in the middle. The fridge was noisy in this room. Showers in both rooms were very narrow, limiting movement.  Any room selected is near an elevator. Breakfast was served and it was ok.Now to address some comments in other reviews...there were ONLY 3 elevators that could hold apprx 10 people w/o luggage and maybe 4 with luggage. Getting from the 32nd to lobby and back up would take some time.  There wasn't a designated service elevator so we had the experience of 1) having clean staff push every floor looking for her cleaning supplies, 2) having one elevator filled with laundry during a busy time (check in and out) and lastly 3) to have one elevator completely taken out of service.However, the hotel staff was very nice and as accommodating as possible. I would give them 4 stars. The location was great, close to everything.  But for the price paid (elevated due to holiday weekend) but I expected better.",,,

As soon as we entered the hotel we were warmly greeted by 3 different staff members. Our check-in was seamless.  Request for late check out was honored without hesitation. We had requested a lower floor quiet room on the website and we're given such. Room was a king bed with kitchenette. It was spotless, kitchen cabinets were stocked with dishes, cups, toaster, utensils, dishwasher detg. (Yes, there is a dishwasher).., pans and pots. Fridge was approximately 5 feet tall with full freezer on top. 10 minutes after check in we received a call from Mgr checking to see if everything met our expectations. What was nice was they offered a free happy hour which included free wine, beer, canned soda, freshly cooked full hot dogs with buns, salad fixins, fruit and desert, again all free. They offer a changing menu I believe 3 times a week. Back in the room we noticed well functioning blackout curtains and 4 pillows on the bed with 2 more down filled ones in a drawer plus extra blanket. There is a safe in the closet if needed. Iron, board, microwave,flat screen tv, comfy chair with ottoman. We were on 8th floor in corner and did not notice any elevator noise or loud door closing. Free bkfst starts weekdays @ 630AM. We had eggs,toast,English muffins,bagels,sausage,egg whites omelets, pancakes, syrup, fresh fruit, boiled eggs, salad fixins, juices, coffee,soda, hot oatmeal. We got there at 630AM and there was about 25 people already there. Everything was buffet style. Lobby was very clean. They also have a small 10 x 8 room on the first floor stocked with individual frozen food products and snacks avail. for purchase 24/7. There is a concierge in the lobby.

The location is great, which is right by port authority so you have about 10 subways to take you anywhere you need to go. The heart of Times Square is 2 blocks away. This is just a great hotel. We will be returning for sure.",,,1
89,Katania Y.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",6,2,0,4.0,11/7/2015,"Have stayed here in numerous business trips to NYC, but most recently stayed here for 2.5 weeks while I relocated to NY from overseas and spent time looking for a permanent home.For anyone looking to stay in Midtown for longer than 2 or 3 nights, I would highly recommend staying here for any long term visits to NY. Full breakfast is included, as is use of their free laundry facilities. Rooms have small kitchen facilities perfect for longer term stays.Rooms are always clean and well serviced, and all housekeeping staff are extremely friendly and helpful.If only the lifts ran more often - leave yourself an extra 5 minutes in the morning to go downstairs from your room due to the lifts being so busy!!!",1,,
90,Justin B.,"Temple, GA",0,2,0,3.0,4/11/2016,"Not a bad place to stay. Your in New York, you don't spend much time in your room. Room was clean, elevators sucked, staff was nice. Really close to everything with out the expense of a Times Square hotel",,,
91,Tiffany S.,"Liberty Hill, TX",225,44,39,5.0,7/16/2013,"Place was awesome! 2 blocks from Times Square. Free breakfast - eggs fruit cereal yogurt - on a beautiful glass enclosed patio. Free wifi that worked on our 8th floor. And inexpensive- we booked through the triple a website and got a king suite for $150 tax included. The kitchen comes in handy. We'd go to Walgreens and buy snacks and water for the week, also keep our leftovers in the fridge and heat them up in microwave. I sleep in a tempurpedic bed at my house- the beds here were amazingly comfortable. Loved the location because it was easy to get to subway - penn is 7 blocks away, the bus station is the next block over and it was centrally located between the moma and broadway and meatpacking district where we would go out at night. Go to the Greek restaurant Dafni amazing food.",6,,3
92,May A.,"Miami, FL",117,117,144,5.0,5/21/2015,"The hotel is very clean and elegant. Very nicely decorated. We enjoyed the free breakfast every morning, a huge plus. It would get very crowded because the breakfast area is not big. So they opened the dining room to make more space during breakfast. The room wasn't huge but big enough for two people. The A/C worked very well. I asked the front desk for some extra shampoo and conditioner, and they delivered them to the room within 10 minutes. The room that we had also had a nice view of the empire state building. This hotel is in a nice location, very near to times square. We were also close to a subway station. BTW I love the subway system in NY. This hotel is close enough to all the action, but far enough to not hear the noise of the city. I do recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,,
93,Dennis A.,"Maspeth, NY",1,2,0,5.0,5/29/2015,I stayed at the hotel last weekend for one night and it was amazing. The room and the bathroom were very clean. The bed was huge and incredibly comfortable. I honestly did not want to check out in the morning. I'm not a morning person but for the first time I found myself willing to wake up early in order to take advantage of the free breakfast. I was expecting a little selection of food or something similar to what I've encountered at other hotels but when I got downstairs I found myself overwhelmed. It was a mini-buffet. Food was delicious and I did end up going for seconds!Staybridge Suites is now my favorite hotel in NYC. I normally don't even write reviews on yelp but I felt like I had to give something back after my great experience. I've never felt more comfortable in a hotel before. My standards for a great hotel have definitely been raised.,2,,
94,Topher R.,"Manhasset, NY",43,9,0,5.0,9/1/2013,"It doesn't get much better! The location is great, the staff members are incredibly friendly, and the studio-styled rooms are spacious and comfortable. The kitchenette comes in handy when you want to cook a whole meal on the stove, heat up your dinner leftovers in the microwave or just chill a bottle of wine in the refrigerator. They even provide dishes, cups, utensils and a cookbook!Breakfast is free and they provide food for happy hour as well :)I don't know what all the fuss was about regarding the elevators being slow. I never had to wait very long. I will definitely stay here again!!",3,,

It cost me around 140 dollars for one night (total duration of stay was one night). If you use Hotel Tonight app enter promo code PSARYA to get 25 dollars in credit. If you use Uber, an app for taxis enter iyt90 to get 10 dollars off in your first ride. Having said that, I would highly recommend this hotel even it is only for one night",2,,

Also, it was a very convenient location (near Port Authority).  The elevator was extremely slow though.",1,,
97,Eric B.,"Ottawa, Canada",49,362,34,5.0,7/3/2011,"We stayed at this hotel on a 3-night excursion to New York City.  It was our first concentrated time in NYC, and therefore wanted to see the sights, go to Broadway, walk Times Square, etc.  The location of this hotel was perfect - two blocks from Broadway, the shows were all within 10-15 minutes walk, as was Times Square.  It's also located across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, so transport to/from the airport is easy and quick.  The hotel itself has a nice lobby, with three computers for free Internet usage and free wifi (strong in the lobby).  The rooms are spacious (by downtown NYC standards) with a small kitchen including stove, microwave and fridge.  The bathrooms are a bit on the small side, but have a full bath.  The rooms were clean, with nice modern furniture and a beautiful HDTV.  Although the wifi was weak in our room, wired internet was available as well (around 5 mbps down and up). The rooms were clean and comfortable.The only negatives I can find about the hotel are: 1) The elevators can take forever (see other reviews) - only 3 elevators for 32 floors, 2) The air condition was a radiator unit, and the fan could be quite loud at night.  These were more than made-up-for by the free breakfasts! Overall, this is a great hotel with outstanding location if you want to see NYC. I would certainly stay at this hotel again!",2,,
98,Carina P.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,6,4.0,5/20/2016,"I had a great experience staying here. The only thing I think they lost points on was the check in process. We arrived at about 6PM (check in is 4PM) and our room was not ready and after traveling for 7 hours from San Diego, all we wanted was to go up to the room and relax so that was a disappointment. The room was ready about an hour later. The front desk had offered some options for us to kill the time like enjoy the buffet, go to the bar (complimentary drinks from 5-7 by the way), or just hang out in the lounge area so they were still at least trying to be as accommodating as possible. On the other hand, the room looked just like the photos. The bed was super comfortable (and my girlfriend was being super picky about that while choosing the hotel). The bathroom was small, however that's to be expected for New York. In regards to the elevator, it was not as slow as some of these reviews were making it out to be. I am a yelping nerd and I thoroughly read every review for every hotel that we looked at and I could not have been more satisfied with my choice. The location was 2 blocks away from the heart of Times Square. There were various subway stations within a one block radius. One of our biggest concerns was our safety, as first timers in New York, and this area was perfect. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for the New York tourist experience !",1,,
99,Angelie D.,"Arcadia, CA",858,625,356,4.0,3/18/2011,This is the hotel we stayed at when I visited New York City. - Nice view of the tall NY buildings - Walking distance from Time Square - Small kitchen attached to the room - Housekeeping is nice and cleans up pretty well - Staff is very friendly and accomodating - Car service is available - Breakfast is served in the morning - Bed is ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE.

100,R V.,"San Jose, CA",25,146,65,5.0,4/2/2013,"Loved this new hotel we booked, it comes with free breakfast which is always a plus, the staff were very generous to upgrade our room to another higher level due to noise. The location is perfect; near the time square. you can never be hungry, their is literally a food cart at every corner! To my surprise they provided everything we needed to cook inside our hotel. But it wasn't needed. I have traveled alot and had never seen utensils, pots, and pans in a cabinet before. I will def. be back for New Years ;) Can't wait!!",2,,1
101,Paul L.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,161,88,4.0,1/16/2013,"I have been to New York City many a times, but I have never ever heard about Staybridge. Since I've got points with the Holiday Inn/Crowne Plaza group and everything else is booked up, I thought I'd give them a try and to my surprise, it was pretty awesome. Staybridge doesn't often just a standard hotel room, they are suites with a fully functional kitchenette and a full size fridge. And it's not a fake kitchen either, they have anything from cutting knifes to a dish washer, plates, bowls, pots and pans. I was surprised and I love it. If I had known maybe I would have planned and make myself breakfast or something but it's good to know that this is available at this hotel. The exact location of the hotel is not ideal. The block itself is a bit seedy but you can walk anywhere from here and the subway station is on the same block. You'll also get a discount for parking at a garage nearby. Other than a night time luggage person, everyone is quite friendly and efficient. The elevators can be improved upon but I think I would definitely come back in the future.",2,,2
102,George W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,49,8,5.0,4/4/2015,Very nice property-- modern and clean.  The kitchenette is great but there's so much good food nearby we used it just for morning coffee. The staff was very friendly and gladly held our bags (for a 4pm check in) so we could wander around Times Square until the room was ready. We walked a lot and were always happy to return to our pleasant oasis in the middle of the bedlam that is midtown Manhattan.We stayed five nights and hated to leave.,,1,
103,Letie W.,"Sacramento, CA",173,547,317,4.0,9/26/2012,"Nice place to stay close to Times Square. Subway entrance is just at the end of the street (corner of 8th and 40th). It may seem a bit shady walking in this area, but I can assure you there is plenty of foot traffic so you're not alone in an alley or anything like that. I still found it to be safe. They have a pretty good breakfast each morning and everyone is very professional and helpful. The only thing that I would complain about it their darn elevators!! They move so SLOW!!! I'm just glad I was on the 6th floor because instead of waiting 15-20 min, I just marched up the stairs to my room. So much quicker!Oh yeah...did I mention...I think the parole office is down the street as well (20 steps away)....at least that's what I think it is. I see a line forming every morning and people getting pat down. Just saying...=D",4,,

105,Dan K.,"North Little Rock, AR",2,62,20,4.0,11/27/2012,"We stayed here for three nights in November 2012 and were very pleased with the hotel; we had two children and three adults in our group, and rented two rooms.The rooms were nice, contemporary, and clean, and the kitchenette was a plus. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a mini-safe in the room to store your valuables, and it's large enough to accommodate a laptop and other portable electronics. Technically the hotel isn't in Times Square, but rather in Hell's Kitchen, but you're only a few blocks walk from the madness of Times Square and the theater district. The hotel is located across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and it's less than a block's walk to the nearest subway station. Some reviewers noted that the neighborhood was a little seedy; that's true, but we never felt unsafe walking up and down the street, and there's always a lot of people walking around. They have a free breakfast in the morning that was adequate, but not too extensive. The hotel elevators are a problem; there are only 3 of them, and they aren't enough to adequately service all of the floors during busy hours; if you're coming or going at a busy hour, expect to wait 5 minutes or more.Overall, I was pleased with my stay and when I return to New York again, I'll be back at the Staybridge.",2,,1

With a handy kitchenette and clean comfortable rooms its a home away from home. Every member of the hotel is so kind and friendly. Breakfast is constantly refilled and hot. Getting a suite at the heart of NYC with access to subway and bus terminals is a dream come true. Definitely recommend this hotel. We were also lucky to get a room on the 28th floor giving us a brilliant Nighttime view of NYC in pajamas :)Next time you are in NYC, come stay here!!",,,

Updated review","I can always count on a comfortable stay and great service @ Staybridge in NYC.  Unfortunately, this time, the housekeeping was terrible.  On the 3rd day into our stay, we realized that our linens were not changed, and when we spoke to someone at the front desk, we were told that the standard housekeeping was ""limited"" unless the guests request ""full service"".  Of course, this was news to us because during our previous stays, linens were changed every day ... lesson learned.  However, limited housekeeping still doesn't explain the fact that there were no towels, toiletries (which we had to call to have someone bring up almost every night), and even toilet paper in the room.  Nevertheless, the staff at front desk were more than apologetic, courteous and prompt about bringing up the items that we needed, basically doing the job of housekeeping.  Still, Staybridge is a great hotel, and we will stay there again.",,,

111,Steven C.,"Wichita, KS",0,19,3,3.0,10/24/2014,"A pretty decent, up-to-date place.  To say the Internet access is poor would be a compliment (writing this review from cell phone in hotel room because wifi is so awful). If you need wifi for work or otherwise, stay somewhere else.  They could also use another elevator, but then again a lot of these limited-service hotels in NYC (built by Chang) are under elevatored.  If you need to get in and out, recommend you request a lower floor.",1,,
112,Devina G.,"Seattle, WA",559,180,340,3.0,11/19/2013,"Having to wait 15-20 mins for the elevator is absurd! Now with that said, I had an adequate  stay at the Staybridge Suites. The front desk and concierge were very accommodating, and our room were always neatly kept by housekeeping. They served breakfast daily and happy hour on Tues-Thurs evening.  Breakfast time got too chaotic for me due to the high volume of guests rushing and bumping into me and then to find no room to sit. Luckily, they provide to go containers and plastic bags so you can enjoy breakfast in the room =). Good luck waiting for the elevators though, especially if you have a tray full of food. I learned the hard way.The room was very standard and a bit small, however I did like the kitchenette. It was complete with a microwave, stove, refrigerator, dishwasher and a cabinet filled with plates, cups  and utensils. We also had a view of the ESB, which was nice. Oh and there's no room service. Yes, I'm very much aware that some NY hotels are no longer offering room service, and perhaps this is why they have a kitchenette in the room, however, the twin and I had no choice but to walk to TIme Square in search of chicken wings at 1 am. 0_0Although this place is conveniently located minutes away from Times Square, I wasn't  too fond of the location,considering that it's a block away from the bus station and it's about 100 feet away from an adult store and a correctional facility. There were always men hanging out by the adult store and the train station. I felt very uncomfortable  walking back late night.",9,5,6
113,Rick S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",73,176,45,5.0,1/10/2012,"With some trepidation, my wife and I organized a week's visit to NYC for eight of our family, including four grandchildren ages 8 to 14. The visit included New Year's, so we wanted to stay near the Times Square area. I chose this Staybridge Suites largely on the strength of TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews, and we were extremely pleased with our choice.The hotel is smaller than some of the other suites hotels, but what it lacks in square feet is more than made up for by efficient room and common area layout and space utilization, attentive hotel management, and unbelieveably efficient and courteous staff. The in-room kitchen includes a full refrigerator with icemaker, microwave, stovetop, dishwasher, sink and full dishes, silverware and cooking utinsils. Additionally, the hotel's location (40th Street, between 8th and 9th Ave) is convenient to the subway (1/2 block walk, to corner of 40th and 8th Ave), and to walking anywhere in Midtown. The proximity to the Port Authority bus terminal (a vastly improved facility, when compared to our time living in the City in the mid-70's) is actually a plus --- a 20-minute busride will get you to Carlos' Bakery in Hoboken very comfortably. Traveling with grandkids, the (included) full breakfast offered every morning was a great way to start each day. Eggs, breakfast meats, fruit, yogurts, cereals, muffins, bagels, hot oatmeal, juices, etc. --- a great variety every day. And the order and cleanliness maintained by the hotel staff within the breakfast area each morning was a wonder to behold --- efficient, courteous, friendly service from every member of the staff, without exception. On an extended touring trip like ours, we were not really at our hotel for much of the day. But being able to start each day with a pleasant (free) breakfast experience, being greeted by friendly hotel staff upon returning in the evening, and being able to get a great night's sleep in very comfortable beds every night, made the Staybridge one of the best experiences and memories of our trip.",4,1,1

We used and loved the kitchen.* Location is close to many resources. It's in the Garment District, close to so many restaurants. Blocks away from heart of Times Square & Theater District.* Gym is decent.* Laundry facility was useful.CONS:* I had a room change so tried out 2 rooms and both rooms had weak flushes and at first you'd think they were broken, but they worked; they were just weak.* Although location is close to many things, it's also maybe 100 feet away from a parole/correctional facility and an adult store. Even when I was wearing a t-shirt, jeans and simple make-up, I got comments from men as I was walking in broad daylight and made me feel uncomfortable.* Elevator was essentially unavailable; we took the stairs.* Staff of other hotel chains in NYC were friendlier and more efficient. For example, we asked for toilet paper and it took a total of 3 times of requesting over 2 days for them to finally bring it up. Although not horrifying service, the service could improve. I didn't hate it here or love it here; it was okay.",,1,

Just a short walk from Times Square, any Broadway theatre, and most major transit stops, it was good and central for five straight days of hoofing it all over town.Every bit of the hotel that I saw was lovely from the lobby up to our room. Pretty small, but hey - there's only so much space in Manhattan, right? Everything was super clean, the bed was crazy comfortable, and the addition of a kitchenette was amazing. What up, reheated leftovers at 1am?!If I were to pick any gripes, which trust me -is hard to do with it comes to the Staybridge, is a tricky and loud heating system, the loooooong waits for elevators, and the unfortunate turn the neighbourhood takes after dark. Not dangerous by any means...but certainly not a great crowd.Pro-tip: there's a free breakfast and happy hour (no seriously, free beer, wine and tapas!!) Monday through Thursday that was pretty amazing even though we only had time to take part once.",2,,
117,L G.,"Hollister, CA",2,24,5,4.0,3/29/2014,"There are pros and cons to everything.   I know from staying in the city often that rooms are small (your on an island with a million people, space is limited). Not saying the rooms are too small they are a good size for New York (without staying in a master suite 5 star hotel). They do have a kitchen with stove top, full fridge and microwave. These rooms are about the size of some of the apartments here.With the rooms I suggests you don't stay in the ones by the staircase. All hours of the night the staff go in and out and the doors slam.   The really cool thing about this hotel is the breakfast. Yes there are lots of people and yes people don't know how to act when there is free food around you can't blame the hotel for that. The hotel staff I think stays on top of refilling the food and keeping it clean. They do have free food durn other times but I have not been around for that. I suggests getting to to-go bag and eating in your room.   As far as the elevators go there are 3. This more then I can say for some hotels. There are 32 floors and who knows how many rooms. So yes, know matter where you are in New York your going to have to wait of something. I have noticed that people let their kids push all the buttons and that slows things down.  Over all great place to stay.",1,1,
118,Norma I.,"American Canyon, CA",319,145,327,5.0,9/14/2011,"I just got back from New York. I stayed here the last 4 days and 3 nights of my visit to the Big Apple during one of the busiest weeks of the year here...fashion week. I felt it was a great location. The rooms were nicely furnished with modern decor, HDTV, free internet service, nearly full sized refrigerator w/automatic ice maker, microwave, stove top (no oven), and a dishwasher. Although, the room was quite a bit smaller than I anticipated, especially for what I would consider a suite! Unlike Eric B.'s experience, I felt my bathroom was huge! It could be that I was placed in a handicapped room, but it was so large I could have slept in it. They also offer complimentary washer/dryer for their guests downstairs to wash their clothes. This was awesome, since I had planned on taking them to the cleaners before I packed to go home. Much cheaper doing it this way!LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION is key and this place is in a fantastic location! The Port Authority is right across the street, so it is quite easy to get around anywhere in the City within minutes. Very convenient to catch a cab, a bus, or the subway. And walking to the Broadway Shows, shops and Major Department Stores are just a few blocks away.Unfortunately, I was unable to check out the breakfast every morning because I was always in a hurry to run out the door, but I hear it is fantastic! Fellow guests informed me that the breakfast had a large selection and a variety of foods to choose from. I kept meaning to partake in the free food, but just didn't seem to find the time.Elevators were slow, but hotel was packed! Only 3 elevators to accommodate all the guests staying there. The staff was very helpful, nice and accommodating. One bell hop in particular seemed to be there day and night and was always smiling! It made my day! I believe his name is Barry! He was extremely kind, happy, and helpful in every way! Please tip him well! He is awesome! Too bad that all hospitality employees couldn't be as pleasant as he is!

My friend and I waited over 15 minutes several times in three days nd finally had to call the front desk.

121,Darla T.,"Northfield, OH",37,12,0,3.0,10/11/2015,"Stayed here while I was in NYC for a week with a friend of mine who had come from overseas to visit me.  The excellent staff is what makes this hotel!  (staff alone would garner a full 5 stars).  Jamie the manager was super friendly, helpful, and an all-round cool guy.  He plays guitar and strolls around the lobby- fun!  The gals and guys at the check-in counter were also really friendly, as were the bartenders in their small little lounge.  Great live music several nights a week!  Although the concierge people are not actually Staybridge employees (they are contractors working through a company called ""City Experts""), they were fabulous!!  Really super sweet and helpful.  Everyone we encountered was really nice and friendly.   The hotel itself is so-so.  The elevators are extrememly sloooooooow.   Be preprared to wait- a lot.   As we were only on the 7th floor, we would take the stairs mostly.  Nice breakfast in the morning, but the room set up did not make for an easy flow of traffic.  We took our breakfast back up to our room to avoid the crowds and morning craziness.  There was a slight kerfluffle with my friend trying to use the hotels luggage scale- they had only one and another guest had taken it to his room and it took some time before they could locate it for my friend.  He evenutally was able to use it, but not without much confusion as to where it was and if/when it would return.  The area was fine.  Good location and close to a subway entrance.  Nearby to the Port Authority if you plan to take a bus into the city.   Beds were comfy, but the pillows were HUGE!  Too big to use for us, so we rolled up towels and made smaller ""pillows"".   Nice evening wine reception with food a few nights of the week, which was great. Our room unfortunatley was right across from the elevator, so there was some noise from that, but no neighbor noise, and not too much street noise (used the fan to drown out any).   Other than a few small hiccups, our stay was quite enjoyable.  As I said, it's truly the wonderful staff that makes this hotel!  They were great!",,,
122,Sarah A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,36,3,3.0,10/7/2015,"Stayed here three nights this week.  The good - room (king suite - though not really a suite)) big by NY standards.  Maybe 12 x 14 plus hallway plus bathroom- staff very nice, friendly, helpful- b'fast included though i never went so can't comment on qualityThe bad- The neighborhood.  Next door to a parole office, across the street from the Port Authority.  Wouldn't stay west of 8th again, would rather not stay west of 7th.- As so many other Yelpers have commented, the elevators are incredibly slow.  3 elevators to service 30+ floors.  They take forever.  I took the stairs a ocuple of times just out of frustration.- The bathroom looks like they ran out of money.  Very plain, sterile, simple, serviceable.  White.  Boring.  No shelves to store your belongings- The noise of the A/C and the refrigerator motor buzzing off and on all night got really annoying. .But surprisingly no street noise or neighbor noise - and I was on the 4th floor.- for the price (I paid $180, $293, and $338/night my three nights), there are equally nice hotels in far better/safer locations.- TV remote didn't work when i first arrived.  no big deal - an engineer came up and replaced.  But then discovered that there's no signal for NBC or ABC.  Both channels eventually come on after 15 minutes or so but that seemed very odd to me?A lot of foreign tourists here so imagine the hotel does a lot of tour bookings.  I wouldn't stay here again.  For me, the neighborhood would by far be the #1 reason, but also the incredibly slow elevators and low price/value ratio are also major factors.",,,
123,Travis W.,"Yankton, SD",34,42,0,2.0,7/9/2011,"Location:  Disappointed!  Claims to be Time Square but I was expecting to be closer to the ""lights"" of Time Square.  Watched a drug transaction 30ft from the front door at 930PM while walking in.  Didn't feel safe going out after dark tried to arrive by taxi at the door to avoid things after dark.  Breakfast:  PACKED!  Get there early or plan to take it with you.  It had eggs, bacon or ham (depending on the day), muffins, toast, fresh fruit, bagels, and lots of other quick things.  Enjoyed and took extra back to room to have as a snack later in the day.Front Desk:  Wasn't impressed with the service.  They were rude and felt like I was a bother anytime I needed to ask a question.Elevators:  Fast if not during peek check out time.  Mornings were terrible but otherwise wasn't bad.  Took the stairs once to avoid it but 308 stairs didn't try that again.  We were on the 22nd floor.View: We had a room that over looked a parking garage.  We did watch pieces of the fireworks off the Hudson River for the 4th of July.  Didn't see it perfect but did get a little view.Concierge:  Very helpful and nice.  Didn't have too long of a wait no more than 1-2 people in line at a time.Room:  Small but clean.  No tub just a SMALL shower not designed for a large framed person.  Having the kitchen area on one wall as we walked into the room was nice.  The safe was broken so we had no way to lock the laptop or important items up.  Housekeeping:  Quick and did a great job!  Loved they started the dishwasher each morning for us since we were busy and spaced it off.",2,1,
124,Del P.,"San Diego, CA",244,71,3215,3.0,10/11/2011,"For a moderate hotel in NYC, this place was pretty nice. Here are my pros and cons: PROS: Location is good if you want to be in the middle of touristy Times Square. The rooms are nice, clean and updated. The mini kitchen is a great feature in the room. The free laundry was a great option since I didn't not pack correctly for this trip. The free breakfast was very nice, although very busy. Love the iHome alarm clocks. Cab and subway access is very easy. Walk to most of the shows. CONS: My room overlooked the bus terminal which was noisy all night. They have three small elevators, but it was literally a 5-10 min wait anytime i needed one. Staff was fairly pleasant, in a NYC kinda way. All-in-all, my stay was enjoyable. I will probably stay outside of the Times Square area next time though.",1,,

Updated review","After I had completed the review, I noticed after I had checked out, 2 adult shops near the Parole office on the same street as the hotel. They seemed to be very busy! There are a bunch of other chain hotels on this street too, for example, Four Points by Sheraton and Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott. The close proximity to Times Square but the undesirable street keeps the room rates down and the high end hotels out but the lower end brands are all there. I would definitely not bring my kids to this hotel. The Residence Inn where I stayed at Christmas time with my family is a little more expensive but on the other side of Times Sq and in a much nicer area.",3,,
126,Jen C.,"Horseshoe Bay, TX",7,82,10,4.0,5/10/2014,"My mom, sister and I stayed in the Staybridge Time Square back in January. It just so happened to be the same weekend that Winter Storm Hercules blew into town as well so it was blowing cold weather upon our arrival.The lobby is terribly small, so try to arrive at an off time if possible. There is a bar in the hotel, which is very nice and modern. Drink prices start at $10 for a glass of wine. There is complimentary snacks in the dining area during the work week, which is a Staybridge standard and always very good. Same with the free breakfast.I booked through Hotels.com....and beware of that....if there's an issue with your room they are less likely to accommodate you for a room change or special request. Three grown women in a standard room (one full size bed)...we had to pay for the upgrade even though we requested two beds.I like the location of this hotel...it's right by the subway lines and two blocks off Time Square. There are three tiny elevators, so be prepared for a bit of a wait or just take the stairs. Overall, a good stay.",,,
127,Sergiu B.,"New York, NY",8,6,2,4.0,8/4/2014,"The hotel is in a great location near Times Square. The room was clean and spacious with it's own mini kitchen. We expected it would be smaller. The elevators are not great and can cause big waiting times in the morning if you stay on one of the top floors, but it wasn't that big of an inconvenient. The staff was very friendly and helpful when needed. We would come back for sure.",,,
128,Sandy N.,"Stamford, CT",0,2,0,3.0,6/16/2014,"Price, location, quality, cleanliness, breakfast and front desk staff were all deserving of 5 stars. Where this hotel lost stars came after check-out. We had our luggage stored in a back room of the hotel office while we toured the city and attended a show post check-out. When we picked up our bags around 11pm, we noticed an outer pocket was completely unzipped. It had been closed when we first stored the luggage and even after we came back to get an item out of a bag. (Staff accommodated us kindly despite the inconvenience of getting something out of a bag in mid afternoon.) Upon arriving home and unpacking, both my daughter and I realized our make-up bags and other small, zippered bags had been opened. Clearly, someone had gone through both of our bags in search of valuables while they were being stored at the hotel. Thankfully, my husband locked his suitcase which held our most valuable items. Then, it occurred to me I had forgotten to pack two pieces of clothing that had been hung in the closet.  Interestingly, when I called the hotel to see if they had been turned in, I was told my items were not turned in, but two pieces of my husband's clothing were there. He too forgot to pack his items hanging in the closet but hadn't yet realized it. While I was very grateful for those items being turned in, I was upset that someone on the cleaning staff had taken my two items. My husband was back in the city this morning and picked up his clothes, but mine were still nowhere to be found.  So, while our stay was wonderful, the fact that staff are going through stored luggage and stealing personal belongings is a huge disappointment. I was not given any indication that this matter would be looked into any further after being told my clothes were not turned in by the cleaning staff.",5,,
129,Andrea C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1038,321,1497,5.0,4/30/2010,"This hotel is AMAZING!My parents stayed here (while I crashed on my cousin's couch) and it is very near the theatre district (which made my mother VERY happy).The staff was very friendly and were extremely helpful (and did not mind me being drunk in the middle of the day rolling though). What was really a big stand out, amazing aspect of the hotel is the happy hour.  And by happy hour, they mean continental appetizers and drinks.  And by that, I mean free food and booze.There's a room behind the check out with trays upon trays of free buffet style food which had quesodillas, chicken, fried zuccini, and other fun stuff (it changes daily) as well as two beers on tap and bottles and bottles of wine.  Um, anywhere with free-flowing booze and food? Yeah, I'm there.The staff actually came up to us and asked how everything was, were genuine, and really looking for feedback.  Well, here it is: You are the business. I love you. Please open up in the west coast so I can come visit (I promise I'll actually get a room, and not just down all your free booze and munch on your amazing food).  The quality of the food was actually really good, and it really didn't have to be. Usually the whole complimentary buffet is half-assed, but you can tell they really have hard-working chefs in the back that truly want to put out good food. So basically, I miss this. It was amazing (and no one judged me when I went back to sucker down more wine, even though I was already wobbly-drunk. Yeah baby).LOVE.",7,8,7

134,Felisa F.,"Richmond, Canada",0,4,0,4.0,9/19/2012,"Just stayed for 6 nights. As most have written, the evening sundowner is awesome and the staff are very courteous all-around.The elevator issue has been beaten to death, but it's something the hotel definitely wants to look at. Maybe separate elevators for different floors? The waits were never bad for us (only once over 5 minutes).We stayed on the 31st floor and had no issues with noise. The street is actually pretty quiet at night. The room itself was large by NYC standards.Also, maybe this was just my floor, but the doors slammed pretty loudly unless they were manually closed. This sound carried to other rooms which could be annoying if someone was returning late or leaving very early.Also the towels weren't the softest, but the bed was very comfy and my husband and I didn't have to fight over pillows - there were 6!The bathroom was cozy and while the shower was a bit small, the water pressure was great!We did not make use of the stove, but loved having the option. We actually did eat our leftovers, so the microwave and dishes came in handy!The hotel is so conveniently located, right next to the subway and walking distance from a lot of the main tourist attractions. Yes there are some less desirable establishments on the street, but we never worried about our safety.I would stay here again, but get softer towels!",2,,1
135,Cara N.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,181,28,4.0,5/31/2010,"This place is great!  We stayed here overnight, while visiting some cousins who'd flown into NY from NM.  We were a large group, so we wanted a place in the city that wasn't overly expensive.  Staybridge Suites was just the place.  The staff was extremely friendly, and they really made us feel welcome.  Oh, and you simply can't beat the price.This place is brand new, I'm talking just opened in April new, and it shows. The elevator is super fast!  Then again, I guess you it has to be when you have 32 floors. Our room was small, but nice.  And my nephews and cousins had no problem making themselves at home in the form of a huge pillow fight.  The beds were comfy.  Initially the cable wasn't working in one of our rooms, but I flagged down a hotel employee and she called the hotel's engineering department.  The engineer who came up to fix the TV (I believe his name was Paul Thomas) was very friendly, and he fixed the cable issue promptly. The kitchenette was also very useful.My one and only issue with the Staybridge Suites was the temperature control in the room.  Now, please keep in mind that it was like 90 degrees in NY this weekend, so a good AC was absolutely necessary.  However, (and I understand that I'm running the risk of sounding almost blasphemous) it was simply too cold!  I ended up in the bed next to the AC, which normally wouldn't have been a problem, simply because I loathe being hot.  The air in the room was so cold, though, that I had to turn it down, and I thought that having it on ""auto"" would help, but I woke up at like 2 AM and I was burning up.   There was just no happy medium with the AC.  The air kept blowing up my comforter, so I ended up putting two pillows on the side of me, just to prevent that.So despite my issue with the AC, I would absolutely stay there again.  I'd just bring flannel pajamas.",2,1,1

139,Shalin P.,"Johns Creek, GA",43,301,207,4.0,7/7/2010,"We stayed here for 3 nights over July 4th weekend.  We were upgraded for free at check-in to a king bed suite.  The room was fantastic, and definitely the nicest room I've stayed in while in Manhattan.  I'm normally used to matchbox sized rooms, but this one felt huge.  It had a kitchenette with a full-size refrigerator, microwave, and stove.  The king bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was nice as well.  There wasn't much room for toiletries on the side of the sink, but there are glass shelves in the bathroom where you could put your stuff.  Large and clean is a tough combination to find in Manhattan, but this room was both.The TV was an HD flat-panel and one of the biggest I've seen in a hotel room.  There was also a long desk where you could do work if necessary (wi-fi was free and easy to connect to).There is a free daily breakfast, and the breakfast room is modern and well-designed.  The breakfast quality is nothing special, but there is a good amount of variety and at least you can save some money on dining.The location of the hotel is the only reason I won't give it 5 stars.  On the bright side, it's a convenient location.  Times Square is about a 3 minute walk away, and you have easy access to get all over the city via the Port Authority station and the Times Square station.  However, the specific street this hotel is on is definitely sketchy.  I wouldn't call it unsafe, but it's shady.  One night on our walk home, we walked right by a guy urinating on the sidewalk, with his junk hanging out right in front of us.  Not exactly the sight you want to see.  It's actually only the eastern half of the street which is shady, as there is an adult DVD store and a Parole Board building, and very little lighting.  The western part of the street is bright and fine, where the Staybridge, Marriott, and Sheraton are side by side.",1,1,

We had some extra hotel points and out of the 10 hotel options, we chose this one based on price, room, amenities, and past TripAdvisor reviews.LOCATIONI was a little skeptical of the hotel at first due to its location. I was not crazy about staying in the hustle and bustle of Times Square but the fact that this hotel is a ""bit off the beaten path"" made it a bit better. If you're not from the area and you're looking to be SMACK in Times Square, this will probably not do it for you. The location was nice in the fact that the subway was just down the block. If you're driving in and out of the city this is a good location as it is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from the Lincoln Tunnel.SERVICEThe desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. When we arrived the place was a bit crowded because everyone was checking out, but the staff made sure everyone was assisted.AMENITIES/HOTELThe hotel serves a complimentary breakfast in the morning and a complimentary reception, from 5-7pm, with cocktails and Hors d'oeuvres during the week. We actually came back from the Yankees game and went into the bar/lounge area. We had a couple of drinks and wondered why it was so ""dead"". As we headed back to our room we realized the reception was in the area behind the elevators and that's where everyone was. Either way the service at the bar/lounge was good - though the drinks on the expensive side. That's NYC hotel drinks for you.We stayed in a Queen Size room (we wanted to check in early and no Kings were available yet). The room was quaint with a fridge, cook top, and microwave. There was a flat screen tv and plenty of outlets if you wanted to hook up a DVD player or video game. The bathroom was neat, clean, and updated. While the room was on the smaller side (again NYC for you) it was clean and comfortable.There were only two operating elevators during the first half of the day. Quite a hiccup when there are 15+ floors and it is check out and check in time. By the time we got back from the game all elevators were working. The lobby area can get a bit crowded as well.Other than those two minor things this hotel is a great! There is definite value here if you have points that you can put towards a stay!",,,
152,Aaron Q.,"Tacoma, WA",5,3,0,4.0,8/10/2011,"Just recently stayed here and we really enjoyed the hotel overall.  The staff was really friendly.  The continental breakfast was solid.  It was relatively close to Times Square.  You do have to walk by some suspect places, but that's what NY is all about.  They also have HDTV's with a lot channels. I would give them a 5 star rating, but the elevators were REAL slow and I mean real slow.  I had to walk down from the 17th floor to the lobby a few times.  But for me I think this is somewhat a minor flaw. I would definitely stay here again.",,,
153,Kim S.,"Boone, NC",66,201,713,5.0,4/9/2011,"What a great hotel!  The location couldn't have been better, the price was very reasonable and the staff was excellent!  A hot breakfast and cocktail hour with nice snacks supplemented our NYC eating perfectly!  The rooms were a little tight for the four of us women and our giant suitcases and the wait for elevator could drag on but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on our next visit to NYC!  What a great value, thanks Staybridge, you helped make this an excellent vacation!!",,,
154,Edgar l.,"Alexandria, VA",8,17,28,4.0,11/14/2010,"Best hotel I've stayed at in NY hands down. It's just a block away from times square, has lots of good eats nearby (literally around the corner) and you also get free bfast buffet! Def check this place out!",1,,
155,Ben M.,"Ville Platte, LA",0,9,0,5.0,10/9/2011,"I will surely stay here again.  Awesome staff,awesome FREE BREAKFAST, free cocktails afternoons.  Super clean, with fast elevators. Stayed on 31st floor.  Could see EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, FROM ROOM WINDOW!  Right next to port authority.",,,
156,Jesse W.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,0,4.0,10/1/2011,"I just got back from staying at the Staybridge for a week. Times Square was not where I wanted to stay but the price was right and the hotel being fairly new was a bonus. The immediate area is a little sketchy looking being behind the bus authority and all but that didn't stop us from walking around at night. It's really quiet inside the room when the window is closed so I was pleased about that. The room looked exactly like the pics and the bed and pillows were super comfy. The refrigerator does make a lot of noise and we had to leave the air condoner on all night to drown out the noise it made. The heater made a weird burning smell when we tried it.  The TV remote was slow and not all the buttons worked. I loved  the stocked kitchenette even though we didn't cook all that much. The stainless pans looked good but one non stick pan would have been nice too.The concierge was really helpful in giving us directions and answering all of our questions. The free breakfast buffet and free happy hour with free beer and wine was awesome. Not the greatest food but pretty good considering its Free. Loved it! it does get crowded but you have to expect that going in. There's a good pizza place at the end of the block that's open late and cheap. $1 for a regular slice. Can't beat that when you 're tired and hungry.It's a couple blocks from a big subway station and it was wonderful to be able to walk to and from the theater. Much prettier at night with the bright lights around you. Romantic. Overall, we had a great stay there. I'll most likely pick a different area next time in NYC, but if staying in Times Square, I'd stay here again.",,,
157,Kelley H.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,5,0,4.0,7/16/2011,"I really loved this place, especially for the price.  The staff was wonderful.  The beds and room amazing.  The rooms have a great kitchenette which was very helpful.  This location was close to the Theater district, Garment district and close to great places to eat. The morning breakfast was pretty good with bacon, scrambled eggs, great coffee, juices, toast, bagels and many other items. I will stay here next time I come to NYC.",,,
158,Carolyn G.,"Clinton, IN",5,2,0,5.0,7/15/2011,"I booked this hotel through Orbitz based on reviews I read.  Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised by how much nicer it was than I had expected.  The pictures, while very nice, didn't do it justice!  Space is found at a premium in NYC but this room was just right.   The staff was very helpful - especially Joy at the front desk and Jamie that booked our car service to the airport.  I will definately stay here again on our next trip to NYC.  Free breakfast buffet every morning and a laundry room where they even provide the laundry soap.  If you're missing something, all you need to do is ask at the desk.  Thumbs up and stars to the hotel and staff!!!",,,
159,Bill S.,"TN, TN",2,85,2,5.0,1/17/2013,"Great new build hotel right near times square. Unlike many other older buildings that are renovated this is a complete new build. Cute small kitchen, nice free breakfast. Granite / marble in the rooms. Rooms are small but its Manhattan.  The street is a bit dark and quiet but its safe and you are right near 2 bros pizza!",,,
160,Jane P.,"San Francisco, CA",270,229,18,3.0,10/12/2010,"I really wanna give this place 4 stars but there's a couple big reasons that I can't.#1) The Bed:  To me, the bed is probably the most important part of a hotel.  Despite the fact that it was a King sized bed, it was not very comfortable.  It wasn't firm, it sort of sunk in.  The pillows sucked balls.  I would wake up with a neck cramp, so I just didn't use one.  Sleeping without a pillow actually made things A LOT better.  But anyway, yea.  Bed was not so great. #2) The sink:  the sink in the bathroom would change temperatures on its own from scalding hot to lukewarm, making it very inconvenient when washing up.  Thankfully the shower didn't do this, but this proved to be a major annoyance.  Everything else about this hotel is great.  Location - awesome.  Right by Times Square.  Staff - really great.  I think someone made a conversation w/ me every single time I was in the elevator.  Cleaning staff - very polite and nice people.  Free breakfast - AWESOME.  Huge TV.  Nice kitchenette.  But despite these great things, if you can't deliver a great bed, then it's just A-OK.  Sorry!!  :T",,,
161,Ryan M.,"San Diego, CA",1,11,1,5.0,1/7/2011,"The hotel is clean, trendy, and friendly staff. I get free breakfast every morning and have a nice in room kitchen. This place is amazing. I am here for 3 weeks and its my home...I truly love the accomedations and I have high standards for hotels.",,,
162,D D.,"Chicago, IL",8,26,9,3.0,7/26/2010,"Nice, clean, and friendly hotel. Great location. Steps away from the middle of Times Square. The rooms are smaller than I expected. The kitchenette is nice to have. Our room with a view was from the 30th floor. It was somewhat a view of a couple buildings. Had I known, I wouldn't have paid the extra upcharge. Elevators are always jam packed, and still people wanna try and squeeze in. But whadaya gonna do? But the dinner receptions they have during the week, i must say did impress me with their generous spread. Can i say ""Hello wine! Whah?"" Overall I'm happy with our stay and room. Yes I'll be back. Somebody grab me another glass, yes I'll have another. Makes the room appear bigger.",,,
163,TChelle M.,"Pflugerville, TX",25,51,0,4.0,7/11/2012,"We really enjoyed our stay here, everyone was helpful and friendly!! Everyone else is pretty much right on w/ their reviews, great place, small rooms, elevator traffic, and location is great if you don't want to be bothered w/ the crowds of people. The only reason I left off a star, was because of the continental breakfast (which was listed as a breakfast buffet). We did try it our first morning there and its really just a continental breakfast (what most hotels offer) w/ sausage and eggs. The pineapples, were not fresh and actually made me sick, hey this is New York I was expecting the best, even if it is just fruit. So needless to say breakfast is not worth getting up for to fight the crowds of people and mediocre food. We will definitely stay here again. Oh and they also held our bags after we checked out.",,,
164,Cindy L.,"Monroe, CT",172,171,150,4.0,7/29/2010,"Excellent experience! The staff was amazingly helpful and attentive. Rooms were clean, stylish, and quiet. Beds very plush and comfortable. Great location and felt safe. Breakfast was also very good. Jamie was especially helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.",,,
165,Bill T.,"Chicago, IL",8,127,0,5.0,4/27/2014,"OK - this is my first review of a hotel, so I might be too generous, but hear me out.  Just here for 1 night and we're on the 32nd floor.  I'm looking at the ESB from our room.  Pretty cool.  We have a kitchen, bath, great king bed and a full hot FREE breakfast.  Yeah - full - egg whites, reg omelets, breads, bagels, muffins, fruit, hot & cold cereals, cheeses, fresh tomatoes, 4 different juices, coffees, and more.  Folk were taking all they wanted (they wanted a lot) - plentiful take-out containers too.  Ok I like food and I have never seen a more plentiful free breakfast.  The hotel also has a nice Bar - made a great martini! The room is very nice.  Bed was great.  Hotel was quiet, but also packed.  It is part of IHG family of hotels - a group I'm liking more and more.  OK back to Staybridge - it is a great location (Hell's Kitchen, Times Sq, theater district, etc.), provides discounted parking, early check-in & late check-out.  The staff are great, the rooms superior, the clientele - so International - it is a perfect place to stay, see a show, and enjoy this great city.  So I say check it out.",,,
166,Joe H.,"Richmond, CA",10,68,2,4.0,3/2/2012,"We stayed in the Staybridge Suite for a week during the President's Day Week.  The hotel location is very convenient - right next to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and can walk to Time Square either above ground or via subway tunnel.  Very close to all the theaters so it's easy to see the show, and close to a ton of inexpensive but good restaurant in the Theater district and Hells Kitchen area.  The free breakfast is OK - it's free although there is no room to eat downstairs.  No matter - we just bring it to our room.  The room size is smaller than most suites - size is comparable to a regular hotel room in NYC.  Mini-kitchen is very helpful, though.  We stayed on the 31st floor - can see Empire State Building.  Service is good.  Overall, except for the room size and the crowded elevator (yes you sometimes to have to wait for a while), everything else is good.  It's a worthwhile place to return.",,,
167,Kristen L.,"Boston, MA",3,12,0,5.0,4/23/2012,"Best hotel experience. Period. Stayed here with my Mom for IBS Beauty Expo. Superior staff that seemlessly handles a large volume of people and demands. Superior rooms. Excellent value. Exceeded expectations. Accomodating down to the very last detail. Special thanks to Jamie, Sasha and company. Will definitely be staying here again!",,,

169,May B.,"Wailuku, HI",15,48,81,5.0,3/31/2011,Stayed here from 3/12/2011-3/20/2011 and it was great. Loved everything about the place and location is great as well even though there are some run down areas around it like the parole center and liquor store. Other than that just pass by those areas really fast and you're considered safe. Marcin (the bellboy) was awesome and made us feel really comfortable. He has such a positive and friendly vibe that you will think you knew him forever! the housekeeper was awesome also. There were three of us in a room and we can get pretty messy but the housekeeper did such a great job! she organized everything from my toothbrush to the snacks on the counter. Great great place to stay and when I visit NYC again I will surely stay here again. the only thing that we encountered was that the TV would have glitches once in a while. But we barely watched TV bc the City had soooo much to offer. I miss it already!,,,
