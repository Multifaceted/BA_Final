Updated review","I've been here a few times and I like this place. It's a dive bar, narrow and long with a shuffleboard table, a juke box and an upstairs alcove with a few tables. It has a small curb patio and that's great for hanging out on a summer night in New York City. I like the looks, huge American flag above the bar and on the opposite wall a sign reads ""F... Communism"". Except for last the last couple of times when the bartender was this blonde woman clearly inebriated. Typically, a brunette bartender (Nancy?) mans the bar. The drinks are affordable for New York - $9 for a whiskey in NY??? Unheard of. It has an interesting food menu, but I always come after dinner for a nightcap before turning in so I haven't tried the noshings yet, but I see they are well spoken of in other reviews.",3,2,3
4,Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1825,1613,269,2.0,2/5/2018,"Gosh this place is strange. It's indeed a dive bar. Downstairs there is a bar that seats a few peeps and a shuffleboard table. Upstairs is another story. We went upstairs and I had to watch my noggin. Seriously though being 6'2, I couldn't stand up without hitting my head on the ceiling...yes you read that correctly, the ceiling. I had to slouch down.  Let that sink in. The service stunk. We ordered drinks (no food...actually not even sure if they serve grub as it's really the definition of a dive bar). They kept messing up our order. The server would disappear for long stretches...we ended up ordered one round and leaving as it was taking so long. If you are tall, avoid the upstairs. I wouldn't go back but that shouldn't stop you if you like the dive bar thing...oh and brews were $8...so much for a dive bar!",4,1,3

6,Stephanie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",210,226,143,4.0,2/4/2017,"There are those who feel at home in dive bars, and those who need to see a French cuff on their waiter before they feel comfortable ordering a perfect Manhattan. I am of the bar butterfly variety, fluttering indiscriminately from one venue to another. Nancy Bar falls firmly in the former category of a dive, but is one of the best I've seen in my career as a drunk. For one thing, they have a fantastic food menu. My friend and I split orders of their French Fries and Onion Rings. Both were fresh, crispy, and very delicious. I highly recommend getting the large.The crowd here is eclectic, ranging from college-aged kids to businessmen from nearby TriBeCa in for a post-work nightcap.The space is, to put it nicely, compact. It's a bit of squeeze to get in between the bar and the shuffleboard table near the entrance, especially on a crowded night. The upstairs alcove however crams in 3 or 4 tables of extra seating for groups.For a low key (and reasonably priced) drink and a little something to munch on, Nancy is the perfect little spot. And if you have a little too much, the entrance to the A-C-E trains is just steps from the front door!",6,5,3
7,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,3.0,4/17/2017,"Nancy Whiskey is your typical dive bar. It has a variety of decorations which includes signs, lights, flags, money, some graffiti, a digital jukebox, and of course your locals. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are good, and the food is good too. I had a burger and it was cooked well, the fries were ok. The crowd is on the older side, everyone is friendly and chill. A good place to stop in for a drink or two and for a cheap quick meal.",,,1

Updated review","I've been back a few more times since and I always have fun. Their burgers are also really good, and cheap! Perfectly cooked, tasty. And they even let me do a split order of onion rings and fries (both delicious). It's one of the few affordable lunch options in the area that will also leave you satisfied. Definitely a better burger than Walkers (yes, I said it). Melissa is also super sweet and awesome :) They still play great music. When I came in for lunch they had the radio on, 104.3. Frank is still drunk. Go in and say hi!Edited to add 2/2016: This is still one of my favorite bars in the city but I would absolutely skip the food, its not what it used to be.",2,1,2

I think during happy hour Bud Light drafts are $2.50 for a 16 oz pint. The decor is divey, with lots of American art on the walls, including a ""Fuck Communism"" sign. There is an upstairs area with tables. I wandered up to take a look and it looked pretty dark and divey as well. I've been served by two bartenders there, both ladies, and both were very nice. One time I walked in and the bartender instantly moved people so I could have a barstool, which she didn't have to do. They serve food, and I had a burger and fries and it was delicious. Next time I'll try something different. They take both cash and credit, which is a plus for me. Pretty self-explanatory!",1,1,

27,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1045,25564,3.0,6/10/2013,"I've come here about 3 times. Two out of the three times were because I had client meetings with media companies/publishing houses in the neighborhood. Last time I was here resulted in drunken pizza with my girlfriends after a generous, open bar event next door - but my most memorable experience here was with my old boss after a successful sales meeting with a very well known music company.Decent beer selection for a bar who's method of operation isn't really beer. The food here is also surprisingly not bad. My former boss and I went for wings, fries, mozzarella sticks...you know, all the healthy stuff. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced.The environment here is interesting, no frills and just New York City bar-like without any pretentious, hipster or the wannabe faux artsy vibe that you can get sucked into by some bars in Tribeca.Bartenders here are super chill  and laid back. The guys that work in the kitchen could definitely stand to learn some manners and not be such oogling freaks that act like they've never seen a woman crush mozzarella sticks in a bar. Literally talking about me in Spanish and acting like you're not sure whether or not I understand as I glare at you is not cute. Instead it's why I docked a star from a bar that in my book is a solid 3.5.I would totally come back if in the neighborhood and had to kill time, but I wouldn't make a night of it here.",4,3,3

36,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,4.0,6/24/2014,"My girlfriend loves this place because it's right next to the A train and the drinks are fairly inexpensive. The first time she dragged me in there I didn't really care for it; It was crowded and I had the worst Guinness pint of my life. The second time I enjoyed it immensely more. We were looking for a place to watch the US vs Portugal game and everything was slammed. We ended up walking 20 minutes just to come here and it was a good decision, they have at least 6 TVs and plenty of open seats at the bar. The bartender Kat was friendly enough and we had no trouble getting drinks and shots. I stuck to bottled beer this time and it was a much better decision. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger w/ fries which at $7 was a steal. It was a large burger with 2 strips of bacon and a ton of fries. The burger was very good for a dive like this and amazing for only being $7. We stuck around for a little while after the game and had a few more beers and listened to the assortment of music coming from the jukebox. There's a small bumper shuffleboard game there as well which is a lot of fun. I think I see why my girlfriend likes this place so much and I'm starting to come around.",1,1,
37,Bryan R.,"New York, NY",161,349,100,1.0,6/14/2015,"Came here after searching the nearby area for bars with shuffleboard. This was the only one within a mile or two, and plus it was a dive bar - perfect, right?Show up, place seems alright. but the shuffleboard is tiny, falling apart, and what dirty sand is left is jammed under corners of plastic that has long since peeled away from its adhesive confines. We order a round, and start warming up to test the table. It's pretty all over the place, but we're trying to get some sense of how this thing will work when a gentleman from the establishment walks over and starts giving my friend across the table a hard time. He warns him that he won't tolerate us whipping pucks around and slamming them into the backboard. God forbid someone damages this table that is falling apart. Oh, did I mention there are bumpers? Because there are bumpers on this shuffleboard table.We play a few games, and are having a reasonably decent time. The music, after a spat of 4 Taylor Swift songs in a row, rounds out into some more classic dive affair. It's the end of a round, and I make a nice play to knock off the far puck of my opponent and pick up the round. Out of nowhere, the same gentlemen appears with a pie tin and grabs the pucks from us. One short, he accuses us of withholding a puck until he finds it in the dark recesses of the table. ""Ok you're done"" he barks. Despite following his rules of not slamming pucks into the wall, we apparently broke an unspoken rule of not colliding pucks. The treatment and lack of any kind of decent table beg the question - why do they even have shuffleboard here? Why waste 1/3 of the space of an already tiny bar for a game that you won't let people play with any kind of normalcy? I'd give the bar some tip-of-the-hat points for being a dive in an area of ever-rising rents were it not for the aforementioned foursome of Taylor Swift tracks.",3,4,
38,Brendan K.,"New York, NY",73,10,1,5.0,3/25/2015,"Nancy Whiskey is not just my favorite dive bar in NYC, it's my favorite bar in NYC, period. But let me put it plainly: this is a bar for people who like to drink, not for people who like to sit on a fancy cocktail for an hour. If you're the sort of person who sends a martini back two or three times before it perfectly matches your taste, I suggest skipping Nancy Whiskey.That said, if your attitude is in the right place, you're going to do nothing but enjoy yourself at Nancy Whiskey. The service is awesome, especially Kat, the blonde bartender who remembers your drink order, even if you only visit every now and then. This is the sort of stuff that keeps people coming back and creates regulars. Overall, if you know how to carry yourself in a dive bar, you're going to feel welcomed and like you're right at home.",5,1,

42,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,1.0,2/7/2015,"Normally I stay away from dive bars, because they usually have very nasty uni-sex bathroom. Unfortunately under peer pressure, we walked into this place. It's packed on a Friday night, but luckily we found two stools by the bar after a couple left. The middle-aged bartender with bleached blond hair, either didn't know what smile means, or didn't care about anyone at the bar other than the two guys that she probably knows, who she kept talking to and giving free shots to. Anyways, our night was still good, because there's a jukebox and everyone loves a jukebox! We put some dollars in, picked some songs, and went back to drinking our cheap beer. When the first one came on (it's Citizen Cope, if you insist on asking), people were feeling it, we were feeling it, I started to like the place. But when my second to last song came on (it's Destiny's Child, yes, I know), the non-smiley bartender just out of nowhere decided to turn down the volume. Then, for my last song (another Destiny's Child, don't ask), she just skipped it! I mean REALLY?! I was at the point to ask her for a refund for the $2 that I paid for those two songs at the Jukebox when my husband stopped me. But here's my rant, it's one thing if it's your home and you can do whatever the hell you want to. But this is a bar, people PAY to get drinks and I PAID to have those songs played by jukebox. This bartender seems to not understand that concept, and thought she had all the discretion in the world to skip songs SHE doesn't like, even though the customer paid for it. Anyways, another item to add onto my list of reasons for NOT going to a dive bar - b**chy bartenders that skip my songs on Jukebox. Done.",9,7,3

I definitely had a couple of asses put in my face.Once I got my burger, I was able to ignore the boccists. The burger was good. Juicy, cooked to the right temp, perfect. Fries were decent. I ate most of em because I was starving. Server checked in on us pretty often.

This place is really small but has everything from tambourine playing middle aged bartender to pool table on the side. We went upstairs to sit and the ceiling was very very low. I ordered a shot of tequila and my friends ordered mixed drinks. What i like about this place is that they gave me a cup of tequila, not a shot. It was well worth 2 shots in a cup. My friends told me their mixed drinks were really strong too. The bill came out to be around $85 and we ordered about 6-8 mixed drinks with 2 shots of tequila which is like SUPER cheap!! I was so happy and drunk after two shots and i shall definitely pay another visit to pregame. If you're looking for fun hip vibe, this is not for you.

Not the righteous path but the trains to NJ. This was about a 10-15 min brisk walk to the WTC definitely doable. Highlight of this place? The shuffleboard for a $1. So much fun. They have a juke box which is great and as well all know, not so great, and some pretty cheap drinks/$5 beers.The downstairs is super limited space as there is a shuffleboard table and so definitely close encounters with the clientele which ranges from some old ass men gettin' their drink on, to college kiddos to some suits. They had an upstairs as well which I didn't get a chance to peep but, looked pretty spacious for a bar in Tribeca.Everyone was pretty nice, I must admit. The bar just lacked a certain warmth/dive/atmosphere for me. It was just kinda dirty. They did serve food, I didn't try any but, the wings spelled spicy from the few bar stools away.Anyways, definitely a great spot in the area if you aren't lookin' for fancy pants and just want to booze.

52,Rafael Y.,"Manhattan, NY",148,116,36,5.0,8/10/2014,"My friend's loves this place and since i never been to a dive bar before they dragged me to go in and experience it. This place is close to chinatown and near the N,Q, A,C, E, 1, 2,3 train stations which is a huge plus. The drinks are pretty inexpensive and they have great happy hour specials. They have around 5-6 tvs with lots of open seats so shouldn't be a problem get a seat with your friend's. Sometimes it can get really crowded on some night and other night their slow. the prices are decent at night time but during happy hour is where you can find a 16 oz pint of draft beers for $2.50. Overall this place is great, i would definitely be coming back here soon and i recommend anyone that never went to a dive bar before or have been to one to check this place out.",1,1,

Cheap drinks, jukebox, shuffleboard, but most importantly: the vibe. Kat the blonde bartender is one of the fiercest women I've encountered. She's not changing her opinions for anything but if you're sweet and respectful, she'll warm up to you. And then you're in for a treat because she's one of the few remaining artists in TriBeCa and has stories to tell. We ended up bonding over my John Waters/Divine shirt and our shared love for sideshows and had shots with her and a guy who has been frequenting the bar for 25 years. Loved it.",1,1,1

Well, I've been bringing my friends and even my family there for those delicious burgers since. The bartender is a funny old fella that always has something interesting to hear, and the young lady that works the kitchen is a real sweetheart. If you're looking for a great burger and an affordable pour, this is the place. I live in Brooklyn and try to go into the city at least once a month to enjoy the NWP. The old fashioned theme of the place adds to its charm. Give them a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",,,

The bartender was either on drugs, hammered or possibly both. We walked up to the bar and stood there dumbfounded for at least 10 minutes. Not only did the single bartender not even acknowledge us, she left her bar post to go stand at the juke box and pick a few songs  to play for herself. Only then did she come back and ask our order.

It wasn't much better up there. The prices were great, the atmosphere was otherwise great, the waitstaff was great, but the rudeness of telling us to just deal with it was not great.

Nancy Whiskey Pub is a dive bar with shuffleboard and ridiculously cheap drinks, so this was an easy choice. $5.50 Stoli drinks (normally $8) is a great value, but nothing in life is free. The clientele here consists of weird old men, weird young men, and weird young men in flip flops. Actual conversations include weird old men (and I mean weird! like Riders on the Storm, Killer-Bob, denim vest, long gray hair weird) lying about their age (""I'm only 35 I swear""), and another weird young man telling me that my female friend was intimidated by his rugged good looks and muscles (he was not jacked, not good looking, and wearing a polo shirt reminiscent of the TGI Fridays staff shirts).

Even after trying to correct her, all subsequent rounds would all be incorrect. Did she care? Not really. Then there was the older gentleman, either a manager or owner, who was dancing around yelling in Portuguese while conspicuously counting the till behind the bar. I'm surprised that he didn't get mugged flashing all that green around.  I'm not sure if he was high or drunk, maybe both? Nonetheless, he was quite a character. Meanwhile as this little cougar is wont to do, I picked up and then kidnapped the young 6'6"" Englishman sitting next to me. Poor thing, first time in the states for business, he had no idea what was happening. My apologies for accidentally making you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, we could all use the exercise. In 40 degree weather.  Oops, sorry, at least we had fun! We sat downstairs in the bar because my entourage of tall men couldn't fit upstairs.

97,James T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/31/2015,"I actually like the bar, but I'm rating it 1-star so the owner knows that the blonde bartender with the mullet is just brutal. Here are all of the reasons she is brutal..- She was absolutely hammered and couldn't process any transactions without the help of customers.- I had a card up there with an open tab. When I ordered a drink, she gave it to me along with $6. Just literally handed me $6 along with my drink. I explained to her that I had a tab open already, so she should probably give the money to whoever it belonged to. I mean, free money is awesome, but I'm not a scumbag.- She changes any song on the jukebox she doesn't like. She doesn't understand the concept of a jukebox and that the customers pay to pick the songs they like.- I heard her call out at least three people for what she considered to be a less-than-sufficient tip. You're probably not being tipped well because you're an awful bartender.- She got into an argument with a customer about whether or not Miles Davis was still alive. She was positive he's alive and made sure to yell that at the customer. Miles Davis died in 1991. - She is incapable of handing a drink and a credit card receipt to a customer at the same time. Two minimal tasks at once is impossible for her.Overall, Nancy Whiskey is a pretty solid dive bar with cheap prices (especially when a drunk bartender is handing you $6 with every drink) and a legit shuffleboard table, but on nights where I don't feel like dealing with her bullshit, I'll probably go to another bar.",3,6,1

111,Clifford R.,"Manhattan, NY",50,169,8,4.0,8/13/2012,"Nancy Whiskey Pub was the second stop for Meghan P's birthday drinks evening. We started with some fancy cocktails elsewhere (you know, to keep it classy), and then moved onto volume drinking here.  Nancy Whiskey is your epitome of a dive bar.  Not particularly my type of scene, but the drinks were cheap and strong, so no complaints there.We rolled in around 11 on a Saturday as a group of nine or so.  We took a look upstairs, realized that wasn't happening, but were able to grab about 5 seats at the bar, so that worked.  The shuffleboard table seems to take up valuable real estate in the bar, but it also seems to be a big draw for them, so I won't debate that business decision.  Within 30 minutes or so, the bar got pretty packed, so we were glad we had our few seats at the bar.  By 1 AM, the place started to empty out.  The scene was pretty friendly, just people out having drinks with their buddies.  My friends playing shuffleboard for the first time got some tips from some random dudes that didn't seem like they were just trolling for someone to hook up with.  The bartender wasn't particularly friendly, but I don't think that's what they're going for - she was more serious than anything else.  And she was working her ass off, so I give her props for that.  They have a pretty good selection of brown spirits, less on the clear, and only a few beers on tap.  My Makers Mark was only $6, so that kept me happy.  As dive bars go, I'm ok with this one.",,,1

The wood interior is crammed-tight, worn and feels as if no one has bothered to renovate or update since, who knows when(?).

Then it brought back memories of the long gone Minneapolis neighborhood bars and 3.2 beer dives of my college days.  Nancy offers cheap drinks in an old comfortable room.

The bartender herself came to our table a few times so we were eventually able to get drinks, but she was the rudest, bitchiest bartender I've ever encountered.  We had 6 people so you'd think she'd want our business, but instead she seemed to want us to leave. This is the first time in my life that I've tipped 0% at a bar.As for the drinks themselves -- again I find myself saying, wtf? My friend knows beer & we can tell you for sure that her pitcher of Stella was NOT Stella. It was more like 1/3 water, 1/3 Stella, 1/3 unidentified liquid. Rum & coke was just coke, no rum. Vodka soda was just club soda. When my friend asked the bartender if she could have her drink a little stronger next time, she said not unless you order a double. So she ordered a double, which was STILL weak.I could go on and on about the reasons why this bar sucks, but in the interest of time & not getting carpel tunnel, I'll stop there.(Oh, one more thing -- if you're over 6 feet, understand that you will be smashing your head on the ceiling repeatedly.)",1,,

153,Lindsay M.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,42,11,1.0,3/3/2009,"You know, I hate starting out my Yelp career on a bad note, but some things just need made public. First, off, let me start by saying I am not picky. No. We had friends in town, they like beer, we like beer, we stumbled upon this pub- Bingo! We love dives! This is great.Not so much. We ordered 2 pitchers- 1 of Blue Moon and 1 of Yuengling. I will say one thing for sure- if there is a beer that I know well, it's Blue Moon. What they gave us for $18 was certainly not Blue Moon. It was some sort of dark-caramel colored Blue Moon and possibly Miller Lite hybrid flatness. We decided to give the Yuengling a go. It was skunky. It kicked in the back of all of our throats. The tap basically tasted old. ""That's okay! We're flexible! We'll just tell them something tastes off and order bottles instead."" That's where things got weird.First, the waiter stood at our table and tasted the beer from each pitcher. After telling us that we were wrong and nothing was out of the ordinary from the Blue Moon, he POURED THE REST OF THE BEER THAT HE DIDN'T DRINK FROM HIS CUP BACK INTO THE PITCHER. Then he told us to pour what we had in our cups back into the pitcher. Remember this.So, he goes down the little ladder and comes back with our (mediocre at best) bar food. He then scoots the Yuengling back onto our table, even though we told him something was weird about both pitchers. ""Nothing is wrong with this. Tastes good to me."" Then he proceeds to pour the rest of the beer, again, back into the pitcher. He was looking down and obviously more than annoyed- he looked mad. Really, we weren't jerks about it, but it just wasn't right. I mean, if we were trying to get out of paying for drinks, why would we order more expensive bottles? Come on, people.So then a tall (needless to say, decently intoxicated) man comes up while we are trying to eat and says he is friends with the owner and he owned a bar for 9 years and he knows what beer tastes like. ""So do we. Something is wrong with this."" He is compelled to continue, while we blatantly try to ignore him: ""Blah blah something is wrong with your tastebuds blah blah."" Then he tells us that 4 or 5 people downstairs at the bar tasted both beers and said they were fine- fine, you win, it's totally us, we are very wrong! (yes, they tasted the beer full of the waiter's and our backwash. lovely, right?)Fine, just go away and let us eat in peace!Then another table sits down near us and orders a pitcher of Yuengling. The waiter is talking to them very loudly about how we said the beer was bad. Mind you, we're trying to get over this and just eat and go. They get their pitcher and say it's fine and the waiter feels the need to come over AGAIN and tell us that everyone says it's fine and something is wrong with us. Check, please, for the love of everything holy. We were giving them good business with a 6 person table and would have sat and drank more had they shut up and dealt with it. Plus, the beer was not good. Trust this. I sincerely believe that everyone who tried the backwash-beer-pitchers had to have already been drunk. Not only were they rude and annoying, they violated health code. I know this is long, but I hope it gives you some kind of idea of this place. I think people like the old divey charm a hop away from soho because I can't figure out what else is the appeal. There are plenty more around the city. Maybe go here smashed, get some fake/rank beer and you'll enjoy it? I don't get all of the positive reviews, maybe it was an off day, maybe our backwashed beer made the pitchers taste better or maybe my taste buds are actually ""wrong"".

155,Michelle I.,"San Francisco, CA",875,626,56,5.0,4/28/2008,"this was one of my favorite days in NYC! We just rolled out that day with no agenda and no idea where we would end up..... I do this sometimes. I'll just walk out of my house and walk in a direction without having a destination to see where I end up. Like tempting fate or something. Well, that was my idea that day... and sabra seemed excited to follow it. we just walked out of the hotel and went in a direction. I looked over at one point and saw the subway stairs. ""Let's get on it and randomly get off somewhere"". This could've turned out badly since neither of us had a map or knew our way around manhattan at all. I was aware of the risk, but also turned on by the not knowing.We didn't end up anywhere crazy.... we ended up in Tribeca. Fate was kind to us that day. Keeping with the whole spontaneous theme, we weren't sure what we wanted to do there, so we just walked.... And then we both saw it, the Nancy Whiskey Pub. We both looked at each other and said at the same time, ""Yes!""We liked! A very dark, tiny, dirty irish pub with a strong blue collar feel to it. you can tell a lot of the patrons were regulars as they were all on a first name basis..... I did see a few quizzical glances in our direction since we didn't exactly fit the crowd that night. We were dressed to go out. I remember thinking ""fuck it, I'm going for a double right out of the gate tonight""Perhaps our heavy-duty drink choices made us seem less out of place, because the minute our lips hit the glass to take a sip, one of the patrons standing next to me (and old crusty guy with a thick long island accent) struck up a conversation.... then so did the bartender and a few other surrounding people. Next thing we knew, we were faaaaaamily. After a few hours we moved on though, time for the next phase of the night.This is just my kind of place though. You walk in feeling like a silly tourist from California--but then walk out feeling like a local with a slew of new friends. Perfect.",14,17,15

I love these kinds of places- this is where stories are made! The bartender was more drunk then the people in the bar- which was totally fun! Just watch your money on the bar as I noticed a few times he had trouble counting the money out. Just lay your money down for each drink- bring singles and you will be fine. Your at a dive bar so need to use your credit card:) Tip the bartender as he truly makes the place what it is!

They have Guinness of course. Healthy pours.Food: The bar food is awesome, and the other reviewers are dead on when they say that the pork chops and burgers are phenomenal. I've yet to be disappointed with anything I've eaten there, although I can't say that my taste buds have ever really been exactly sober there.Staff: The staff is friendly and true, exactly what you would expect from an Irish dive. Same people have run the bar for decades. Total family-owned vibe.Crowd: It has it's fair share of interesting regulars, your typical drunks and your daily after-work drinkers. Occasionally groups of college kids will come in and bring some youth. Definitely more attractive women (and men) than you would expect from a place like this.Music: The jukebox is awesome, one of those with download capabilities so you can get any song you desire. Be careful though, as the staff will get peeved if you're in there requesting Usher's Yeah! or any Britney Spears. I've seen them find a reason to kick people out for poor music taste, which I don't mind at all. Other: SHUFFLEBOARD! They have the only bumper shuffleboard table in Manhattan, and it is a ton of fun. The fact that it's a bumper shuffleboard table makes the game much more challenging and fun. Some people take the game very seriously, and there's definitely etiquette and rules that must be observed at all times or else. Great game though that adds some competitive spice to the night. Perfect for groups looking to do something other than just sit around and shoot the shit.Conclusion: Definitely one of my favorite spots in Manhattan to just go chill, drink, play and have a good time.",2,1,2

172,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,3.0,5/4/2007,"Been here many times......and I can't believe I haven't yelped it yet. So last night, me and my friend went for a nightcap, since we hadn't been there in probably 2 years. Its the same old Nancy that we remembered, kind of cramped, shuffleboard slung in there for effect (I'd rather go to Plug Uglies, their board is better).The great thing about this place is the live music (can't remember what nights), its always rowdy, Irish bent, and the jigs and reels and slides come furiously. The bartender is basically part of the bar. The burgers as Chinku already pointed out are gynormous and cheap, and there is a cramped upstairs to lounge around with a smaller group. They have a 3 Jager bottle tap here, so if you're in the mood to not remember the past 2 months, drink up.Last night was funny, because you had the old regulars here, and they were sharing shuffleboard duties with these two suits and their women. Somehow, the one skinny white dude regular and built black dude suit got into an argument about space, the regular needed space. He kept yelling at the suit until an umbrella was brought in for defense, and the regular took the umbrella and hit the suit in the face. wow. Racially it doesn't look good, and it didn't look good in general. Because the suit did nothing. Yes he was being a righteous asshole, but only verbally, and the regular decided to apologize with his friends. But, at the same time, he wasn't backing down. It was weird. It wasn't raining, why was there an umbrella, I thought. ]My other problem with the bar was the ""fuck communism"" sign. Now while I don't agree with communism, if this place really is an Irish whiskey pub, putting up that sign just kind of ruffles feathers and the stance of what the Irish republic was founded on (not communism but socialism). Its cliched Irish-American. I don't care, it was just a thought.An interesting nightcap nevertheless. Also years ago when i was on my way home from this raucous venue for vomiting, a pimp and a prostitute came up to solicit as some dude was getting dressed in their car. Just make your way over to Fulton, maybe they are still there after all these years.",1,,1

Although these men are not attractive in any way, they are masters at the game Bumper Shuffleboard. Do not play this game. It is not for you.

I wonder what your coworkers think of you, imagine if you could yelp your friend. What would you get 1 star.  Shuffleboard is a blast and taken seriously, as well as for fun. The owner checks in daily and I have been there for many different shifts and have never had a problem. This is a drinking bar, you want special service go pay $16 bucks for a glass of wine at one of the nearby hotel bars.

To make matters worse, they were dumb enough to put a shuffle board in a bar that's already too small as it is.  Nancy's makes me feel claustrophobic and can really empty out your wallet quickly.  On top of that, the food prices are NOT cheap.  According to the menu they have posted, their burgers and cheese-fries are close to $7 per order and this is NOT a combo.  These are just average food prices, nothing cheap about it.  Perhaps this place is great at Happy Hour with $2.50 drinks Mon. thru Thurs. ONLY, and that's only if you can find a seat at the bar.  The ONLY positive thing I can say about this place is the digital jukebox seemed to be playing some really good 80's rock tunes for the short time we were there.  Now, if you want to go to a REAL dive bar with $2 PBRs at ALL TIMES, walk another 7 blocks south and hit up The Patriot on Church St. and Chambers.  Now that's a REAL dive bar!!  BTW, Nancy's doesn't even serve PBR's, now how can you call yourself a dive bar and not have PBR??",2,1,

I went to Nancy's to watch the election results come in, and despite the obvious energy and excitement that evening, I felt the pitchers were on the small side, drink prices were higher than those advertised on their website (still reasonable, though), and the television screens were old. On the upside, the chicken fingers and fries combo basket was the perfect greasy accompaniment for the beer. Sorry. Can't jump on the Nancy bandwagon.",,,
198,Ryan H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,11,0,3.0,2/5/2009,"This is a nice little spot that my old co-workers and I go to as a reunion spot.  Small space with a shuffle board and upstairs seating.  The pitcher prices are alright and the food is decently priced.  There's nothing really amazing about this place, but its a nice spot to gather with some friends and find a seat to share a few stories and drink a few beers.",,,

The pork chops, when they have them on the menu (there are great daily specials) are the best I ever tasted - juicey and freshly grilled.",,,
