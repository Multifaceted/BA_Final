0,Aya N.,"Miami, FL",1,28,64,4.0,6/5/2018,"It was our first night in NYC and we had no idea where to go to watch the NBA playoffs so thanks to Yelp, we found the Gramercy Alehouse.  We liked the vibe of the place, cozy and low key.  It wasn't too packed since it was later in the evening on a Thursday night.  Both the bartender and waitress were very nice and attentive.  We ordered some wings, tacos, and truffle fries and a couple beers. No complains with any of it.  Everything was delicious.  I'm glad we stumbled upon this place, we were not disappointed.  If you're looking for a chill spot to go in NYC for some good food and drinks,  I recommend Gramercy Alehouse. :)",,,
1,Brian R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,2.0,10/26/2018,"Amateur bar, amateur bartenders who don't smile, don't offer you a glass of water after you sit at the bar for an hour. Don't offer you a buyback after 10 drinks and tipping them. Don't say thanks to you at any point. I would not recommend unless you're a 20-something who doesn't care about service.",,,
2,Johnny G.,"New York, NY",192,228,220,3.0,3/16/2018,"I went with a crew, this spot a good spot for crews if you grab a table. Waiteress was kinda not responsive. Am I see through? She did get to us eventually. It was 6:59 and lady told me I missed HH which is fine, I guess.We had the Hell Fries. Amazing idea. Potatoe Wedges covered in hot wings sauce. Great creativity and execution. Very Delicious!",,,1
3,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,118,0,4.0,1/15/2018,"There is something about this bar that I just like. It's low-key, unassuming, and well kept. There are enough people in here to feel cozy but it's never crowded. A lot of tv's so ideal for anyone looking to watch a game and also there is a small food menu. I can also compliment the customer service. I sat at a table and was waiting for a friend to arrive before ordering anything. Bartender came around the bar and to the corner I was sitting in and kindly let me know that there was no server or table service for that night. I had already figured that out... but most places would have let me sit there forever or yelled across the room.",,,
4,Diane T.,"Houston, PA",0,2,0,3.0,8/26/2018,"2nd time stopping here, the fries are different and very good. The stars are for the fries and feel of the place. We had the same waitress and waited for her to finish texting, but eventually had to go to the bar ourselves for drinks and to get a menu. And go to the bar to get our check and pay. What a turn off, I guess we will stop again someday, but sit at the bar, as the bartenders have been nice.",,,
5,Joanne P.,"North Babylon, NY",85,151,387,3.0,1/2/2018,"We had a lot of fun here! This place is a decent gastropub type in the city. My main complaint tho, I was all set to order my usual rum and Diet Coke when a spokesperson from salute vodka gave us his sales pitch and offered to buy us a bottle if we try it...even made an announcement to the whole bar that the vodka drinks were on him...LIES...we paid A LOT for our drinks, which doesn't make me wanna run to the store and by more of this vodka. I would have stuck to my usual drinks instead. Anyway, not totally the restaurants fault so on to the food which was great! We split the garlic aioli boneless wings-amazing, French onion burger and fries with gravy and cheese. Also we're delicious but I especially loved the boneless wings! The prices were reasonable-aside from those drinks that were supposed to be free, kinda turned off by that so I wouldn't go out of my way to come again but the trivia was fun and the waitress was very nice!",1,1,1

Updated review","Came back here as it is preferred bar of my friend's and wanted to further comment on the food now that I have tried the burger and waffle fries. First off, I would like to complement the service. Wait staff was quite attentive with our drink orders and water refills which I greatly appreciated during football Sunday. They also have a sun roof towards the back so it made the barfeel less dark and stuffy. As for the food, the burger was nice and juicy, accompanied by red onion, lettuce, a slice of tomato and a pickle. The burger comes with fries but I asked for waffle fries which they easily substituted. Glad I was able to get it because the waffle fries were plentiful and crisp. Hot on the inside with that great seasoning that usually comes with waffle fries. Overall a great place to watch some football (in which they have multiple games on with their many tvs all over the place), drink some bucket of beers and eat some good decent bar food.",8,4,7
7,Sharika T.,"New York, NY",529,8,1,5.0,3/24/2018,"Always a great spot to pop by, whether it's after work or on a sunny Saturday. Great service, especially when Jon is working (Monday's usually). Consider me a regular!",1,,1
8,Alexander Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",898,88,125,3.0,2/23/2017,"Gramercy Ale House is in a good location, with plenty of East Village inhabitants including NYU and Baruch students. The bar also serves a wide variety of beer but that about sums up this place. It's your average American sports bar, with a bunch of TV screens spanning around the bar. If you're big into sports, they're pretty much showing everything that's playing or played (ESPN History channel or something like that, don't quote me).I had a few beers and burger and fries, and all in all, my experience was lackluster. The burger was something I could whip up in my backyard BBQ grill, I wish the cheese was more melted - you know, like in the McDonald commercials. The fries took the cake, but probably because I do not know how to make fries. The ambiance is lively, but only with the chattering of the bar overhead. Nothing else can really describe this place, the bar lacks of character and just disinterests me from beginning to end. Maybe I'm getting too old for collegiate sports bars. Damn, hello graduation. There are also a ton of smokers who stand outside between commercial breaks. And depending on how close to the bar you sit, your nostrils will be gently wafted with second hand smoke until you decide to move your butt. Will probably not be back unless friends drag me here out of convenience",1,1,2
9,Gauri L.,"Manhattan, NY",56,80,116,5.0,9/3/2016,"Amazing food, amazing service and one of the best sports bars I've been too! It has a very neighborhood feel and I love the ambience (brick walls, wooden decor)...It get lots of natural light, so great to sit by the window but the bar is extremely comfortable as well and the bartenders are fun and friendly!We tried the chicken quesadilla and the chicken wings. Probably one of the best quesadilla's I have had - the chicken is evenly sliced and distributed as opposed to most places which have chunky pieces of chicken. The wings were delicious as well, a tad on the spicier side thought if you're into that. The music was great as well - a mix between southern rock and all time classics. Very chill place and definitely a new favorite!",,,
10,Jon B.,"New York, NY",6,15,1,5.0,3/24/2018,Great rotation of beer on tap & nice selection of comfort food. My favorite neighborhood spot - always go there to watch the big games.,,,
11,Sean B.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",21,68,14,4.0,6/14/2017,"Although it may sell itself as an Irish pub, they are way too many TVs (all playing American sports or the news). And despite being also very well lit, I guess that works in favour of Gramercy. Not many choices for beer, but that could be a blessing when you don't have to spend twenty minutes deciding what you want. Straight to the point; I like that!The food also is quite nice. I've only had the burgers and they were well prepared to my order. It wasn't absolutely wonderful, but it was a nice meal to go with a cold beer on a scorching day. I would still recommend this place if you're out and about. You can tell that orders are made on the spot, as even with an empty house you'll have to expect to wait a while for your food. The staff is also quite nice, always stopping by. If you're in the area, I'd recommend stopping in for a pint and some grub!",1,,
12,Lou T.,"Livingston, NJ",79,20,4,2.0,5/23/2017,"Nice bartender, but the place is pretty lame.Went here before a concert at the Gramercy theater, don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.",1,,
13,Shadya N.,"New York, NY",25,129,208,2.0,12/22/2016,"Typical pub. Nothing really too much to complain or excite anyone about. Came in on a busy'ish night with all tables reserved, but our waiter was cool enough to let us sit at one. Ordered a few starters and some beers. Average. Careful for the quesadillas, they are spicy!",,,
14,WM T.,"Flushing, NY",1,32,9,1.0,5/4/2018,"Happy Hour $4 drafts but bartender automatically tacked in her tip, saying ""$5"" right away. Bartender was having too much fun socializing with patrons to provide any welcome.",1,,
15,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",274,325,141,2.0,11/10/2016,"The selection of beers on tap here is wide, but not exciting. The food is just sad. In all fairness to this place, I was here on election night, so pretty much anything would have tasted bad by the end, but the food was pretty dismal.Here's what our group ordered:1. Burger and fries -- the burger looked ok, but was unexciting. The fries were good: thick-cut, skin on.2. Grilled cheese with bacon -- the cheese was barely melted on this. What gives? The bacon was nice and crunchy, which was nice. Honestly, the bacon would've been better off on its own. This was served with the same fries as the burger.3. Chicken tenders -- these looked like cafeteria food. I honestly don't think they were worth paying for.Prices for food were reasonable, but prices for beer were, in my opinion, pretty steep for the beer that we ordered. My Belgian beer was $10/glass, served in a glass about half the size of what other beers were served in. UFO White -- which my friends both ordered -- ran $8/glass, which isn't pricey for beer as a general rule, but seems pricey for a beer that's generally a ""college kid"" beer.The upshot: not coming back again, and not just because it reminds me of watching Hillary lose to Donald.",,1,
16,John F.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,286,276,3.0,11/27/2016,"This is a rather typical sports bar, with an okay beer list. The specials are not that special, but fair. It seems to be a Villanova bar, which is interesting. I guess if you're nearby and want to catch a game and a PBR or something, you can't go wrong...  Especially if you're a Villanova fan.",,,
17,Riddhi S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,8,0,1.0,10/9/2017,"Worst. Service. Ever. Ordered mozzarella sticks and two of the sticks had no cheese. Showed it to the waiter and he just laughed and goes ""ha. Never seen that happen"".  No offer of bringing us new ones or comping our current order. Fast forward to the end of our meal. We ask for the check. 30mins later.... we're still here waiting. We're heading  up  to the bar to pay the bill. Absolutely ridiculous service. And it's not even crowded. Empty tables galore. Ridiculous. I would've been better off going to the halal cart!!",1,,
18,Andrew L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,7,0,3.0,11/26/2017,Good for drinks and watching football. Prices are standard for Irish pubs. Food isn't particularly good (had burger and wings) and you could do better for the same price in the neighborhood.,,,
19,Hannah H.,"Brooklyn, NY",772,274,1136,4.0,7/27/2015,Modern bar spot with good seating and great drink choices.I loved the bartenders and waitresses. Attentive and friendly without being overbearing.The seating was modern.The music was a bit too loud for most normal conversation if you aren't sitting really close together.

20,Philip N.,"New York, NY",8,149,26,4.0,6/29/2017,Did trivia night here. I was quite impressed. They get a pretty large showing and all patrons stay engaged throughout. It makes it a fun experience for a weeknight. The staff is great. They are always checking up on you to see if you need another drink or more food. The prices are fair as well. Check it out.,,,
21,Keilon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,312,1877,4.0,7/18/2015,"This a great bar to stop in for happy hour to have a few good Ales from the tap.  Martin is a great bartender and it makes him happy to see people talking and interacting without their cellphones...lol.  Luckily for me and him I only pulled mine out to invite others to come and meet and he was cool with that.  This place is great for people watching and enjoying the weather. In the evening a lot of natural light comes in and if you can get a seat by the window, you're in for a treat.  However the bar is very comfortable and Martin is a good guy to chat up. Finally there is also a condensed food menu. I recommend the potato nachos. It's basically the goodness that you'd get on loaded nachos but on top of waffle fries. Love!",2,,1
22,Darrin W.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,10,1,2.0,4/29/2017,My 'starters' took over an hour. The cook is super slow and the the starter are really disappointing. Service is friendly. But won't come back because why wait an hour for food that isn't even warm. Fried food!!!! Whatever,1,,
23,Henry H.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,0,3.0,7/14/2017,I have been here a couple of times with friends as I live in the neighborhood. They have a pretty standard selection of beers with a few local options as well. All beer prices are reasonable but the happy hour deals make it much better. There is no cocktail menu of any kind but the bartenders will make you whatever you request. My low star review stems from the quality of food and service. I have ordered the burger multiple times and been disappointed each time as it comes over cooked and on the dry side. The specialty fries are also underwhelming despite their highly tempting menu descriptions. Perhaps it is because I go during off peak hours but the bartenders have been apathetic about their jobs in general. It is a great space however with an abundance of TV's for watching sports and large front windows that open all the way letting in lots of natural light and fresh air.,,,
24,Clayton M.,"Greenwood, IN",161,40,25,5.0,5/12/2017,Great place to stop in and have a light snack and Beer. Chrissy was super friendly and inviting. The best thing was it's a locally owned as well. Highly recommended,,,
25,Brendon N.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,24,3,2.0,9/18/2016,"Today was supposed to be a special Sunday. The boys bantered back and forth in preparation for the big game. This Sunday was for the boys. You could smell the sizzle of chicken wings at the front door. We shuffled the tables together and crowded around a bucket of ""cold"" beers. And then came the wings, if you want to call them that. I've seen a sickly pigeon with more meat on its bones. A ten dollar bill will get you only five wings on this cloudy afternoon. We thought a BLT would cure the pangs of hunger. But it turned out to be a tomato party, leaving much ""B & L"" to be desired. I can say things here will get better. I can always hope for more. Only time will tell.",,,
26,Michael Z.,"Union City, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,2/19/2018,"okay so I was charged on my card without my knowledge, and I have no way of contacting the ale house because I'm from out of state, their phone line is always busy, and I got scammed out of 45$ what an amazing place *Sarcasm*",1,,

29,Michael S.,"Morganville, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,6/6/2017,"Do not come here for the food.  We waited over 30 minutes for the wings and there was no one else ordering food.  The wings tasted like they were reheated from the night before. The burger was dry and unimpressive.  The fries also tasted like they were reheated and they were soggy.  The wraps were terrible.  There was almost no chicken in one wrap.  The Greek wrap was sent back because it was made with cheddar cheese for some unknown reason. When it came back the second time it had no chicken in it.  This place is a bar, definitely not a restaurant.",1,,

31,Enrique V.,"San Diego, CA",207,318,29,5.0,10/14/2015,Best place to come watch football or any game especially on a Sunday. I had originally just came here for a drink because I saw it had great reviews on Yelp but I had no idea the burger is amazing! One of the best burgers I've ever had. I'll definitely come back here next time in town and hopefully the burger tastes the same! My only recommendation for this place is that they carry ginger beer so they can make some whiskey or bourbon mules!,,,
32,Alicia H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,7/6/2017,"Such a great experience! The food was good! We got the beef tacos and the pesto burger, we asked for medium rare on the burger but it was pretty rare, only down side to the experience, but the flavors were really great. Burger was also served with thick wedge fries that were good. The service was great. And the absolute highlight of the night was this great musician: Ricky Roche! He blew me away! He's there on some Thursdays, next one is July 20th, 2017! I'll be there!",,,

The food here is great and fairly priced.  Music and atmosphere is awesome.  Definitely consider coming here for happy hour!",,,
35,Jennifer C.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",0,58,2,3.0,8/25/2016,"This is a no frills neighborhood bar. The drinks are basic, the menu is even more basic (although I was happy that they had food at all). The French fries are good. Lots of TV's, clean bathrooms, and friendly bartender... but this is not someplace I would personally seek to visit while I'm in NYC or a place I would suggest to friends/family visiting... it's just really boring and doesn't stand out amongst all the other choices in the neighborhood, sorry Gramercy Ale House!",,,

37,Amira K.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,26,0,1.0,1/18/2015,"This place is awful. The bartender's behavior was appalling and quite possibly against health codes.I wasn't expecting much as this is just a sports bar in my neighborhood but let me tell you I wasn't expecting the bartender treat his patrons with little to no respect.My friend who was taking it easy that night went to the bar to order a coke. The bartender looked at her, grabbed the soda gun, then put it back down as he noticed an opened can of Coke sitting on top of the bar. He grabbed the can poured it in to a cup which it only filled half way then added ice so it looked to be three quarters full. He said, ""well, I usually charge $3.50 but since it's not full I'll charge you $2."" Um, thanks?The pop was flat, could have been roofied, and also could have been drank and left by another customer.So unprofessional.The cherry on top was the couple in the corner who were making out/groping and fighting in this *oh so intimate setting* of a tv-filled sports bar.Not a fun time.

What he may have thought was him acting friendly, was clearly the opposite. He somehow felt it was ok for him to approach me, and my 3 friends that were with me and violate our personal space.

I also waited over an hour for our food!The only decent person who worked there was the waiter who just had come into work.At first you think they would welcome locals. I brought my son and was really looking forward to watching English Football and having a great meal. The size of the food is miniscule, along with the choices for Brunch. My son got a bacon and chicken wrap. There was a tiny piece of chicken and lettuce. All Tortilla. The portions are tiny and the service (from the Irish Bartender) CRAP.

44,Daniel F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,0,1.0,10/11/2015,"I have been here twice, both for Sunday football games. The first time was ok, but very misleading. A sign outside said happy hour was on for $5 beers. Well that should be changed to $5 bud lights because every other beer was $8-10 per beer. They didn't specify or have a beer menu listing prices. The next time I went was much worse. It took them 15 minutes to ask what I wanted to drink even though there were three people (including myself) at the bar. Then I was basically ignored for the rest of the game and the bartender was quite rude anytime I asked for something. He seemed relatively new, but that is no excuse. The food is mediocre at best. The first time I got the buffalo tenders which were soggy and small. The second time I got a buffalo chicken wrap with fries. The fries were soggy and the buffalo wrap was cold. Overall I had high hopes for this place as it is easy to get to but it continues to disappoint. There are many other bars in the neighborhood that have better beer specials, better food, and better service than the Gramercy Ale House.",4,,1

56,Michael C.,"Wilton, CT",0,3,0,5.0,11/29/2014,"Always have a great time at this place. Great selection of beers, the bartenders know their business and are excellent hosts. Great crowd both after work or on weekends and a great place to watch sporting events.",,,1
57,Jim T.,"Madison, WI",0,1,0,5.0,5/15/2015,"I've been here three times and I really enjoy this bar.  First two visits were for standard drinking, the third visit was for a Sunday night hockey game---this place is as a perfect of a bar setup for sports viewing as I've ever seen....the TV sets are large and very close, and the sound/volume is loud enough but not overwhelming.  Cheerful bunch of local New Yorkers were in here during my visits, ranging from groups of friends in their 20's to middle-aged couples.  Very friendly staff---the bartender is great as is the Irish gal who waitresses.  After the NY Ranger hockey game they had a duo of young guys in their 20's playing guitars/singing who were fantastic---they played some Irish songs like The Pogues, some country songs, also more contemporary stuff.  I don't live in NYC, but I'll go out of my way to pay the Gramercy Ale House a visit on my next New York trip!",,,

60,Helena H.,"Yonkers, NY",0,40,0,5.0,10/26/2015,"I love this bar since it first opened. Great spot especially during the summer with the front open watching every one walking by. I find the staff always really friendly and great at recommending drinks. Trad session is a brilliant idea. I haven't made it to the trivia night yet but I will! If you're a sports fan it's a great bar to watch games, atmosphere is fun.",,,
61,Rain D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,1,4.0,10/1/2015,"Great local spot!  Im not a big fan of Irish music so i just stay away when thats on cuz it can get pretty loud, but I guess some people like it.  We're locals in the area so we've seen this place from Copper Door to several different managements.  They really classed up the place (thank god!) and it doesn't smell like a dive anymore the way Copper Door did. The menu has definitely improved. We've tried the mozzarella sticks, burger (from previous menu change) and spinack artichoke dip (new menu change). Advise to owners-- change your spinach artichoke- we all know this stuff is premade- but buy the better ones. The one they have is actually terrible hahah, i could barely eat it, and i love food!",,,
62,Clay S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,1,5.0,12/3/2014,Gramercy ale house is the spot to be. They recently adopted the Villanova Wildcats as their NCAA Basketball team and they have been nothing but hospitable and generous to their many patrons. The atmosphere is friendly and lively. Extensive beer selection on tap and the Irish nachos are dangerously good. This has become a regular bar for me and the homies and we are always treated like royalty here. Go cats. Shoot em up or sleep in the streets.,,,
63,Anon A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,1,5.0,9/24/2015,"Wonderful neighborhood pub.  Service was super friendly.  I wasn't familiar with all the beers, and Martin gave me a couple of tastes to see which I'd like.  The food is typical pub food, though the burger was very good, as were the rest we tried -- the potato nachos and the zucchini fries.  The music was eclectic and not too loud, which is a real treat when so many places are so ear-shattering loud your ears buzz for days.  The crowd was very friendly too.",,,
64,Stuart A.,"Manhattan, NY",25,3,0,5.0,10/29/2014,"An excellent establishment. Great old world feel with a modern American sports bar twist. A large selection of beers, great food, excellent prices (4 dollar pints or less are the norm! ) and fantastic bartender -owners who you can get to know and build great relationships with.",,,
65,Leigh W.,"Manhattan, NY",6,2,0,5.0,12/3/2014,"This place is amazing! Such a hidden gem. The bartender (Shane) was really attentive, knew exactly when you ready for your next drink (or kiss). LOVE Gramercy Ale House and Shane! Definitely coming back. :)",1,,1
