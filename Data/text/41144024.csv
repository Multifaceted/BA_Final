1,Carolyn H.,"Forney, TX",33,279,83,4.0,6/26/2018,"Ridgeway is one of those great old NYC diners that doesn't change much, though the city around it does.  Sometimes that's a good thing.  If you are looking for something tried and true, tucked away out of the hustle and bustle, here's where to find it.  Maybe some Greek souvlaki.  Or just a good old BLT or egg salad sandwich. This is where NY comfort food lives.  When it's slow, the staff play cards back near the kitchen pass-through.  The owner sits and counts receipts by the register.  When it's busy, they know how to hustle and get you what you want, fast.  Classic NYC, unchanged.",1,,
2,Rachel V.,"Indio, CA",30,25,3,5.0,7/11/2018,I gave this place a 5 star. It deserves much more than an over all 3.5 starts so I'm hoping my acore will help bring up the ratings kn this joint. I am so glad we came across this place. Typically I yelp everything before going & won't eat anywhere that has a 3.5 or lower. Boy am I glad I didn't have a chance to do that here because I would've missed out on great food. There were four of us and we each had something different and we all loved our breakfast plates. Plenty of food and amazing service. We were visiting NYC for a week and were over all the fru fru food. We just wanted a nice American Breakfast with no frills and we got that and more not to mention the cheapest meal we had all week.,1,,
3,Forough A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,8/22/2018,"It's probably one of the best diners to have a decent and budget friendly breakfast or brunch in this neighborhood. It is very clean and and cozy and the staffs are attentive. In terms of food, you get what you pay for. I ordered an egg white avocado omelette with a side of turkey sausage, and it was tasty,  with good portion and generous amount of mozzarella cheese. The only thing that bugged me was that the omelette was a bit watery for some reason. The coffee was not that bad, but you can't expect more than that from a diner. Overall it was a good dining experience, and I might come back to try their pancakes.",,,

I notice in NYC they're starting to cook  reuben a bit different. cooking it in 2 separate parts and serving it open face for you to close. They did this here as well as a few other diners in the city. The service was especially great here. Very friendly!,1,,

This is a diner, people, plain and simple. I love diners, for the most part, and I do really love Ridgeway. How could I not? They have a $2 fee on their ATM. I haven't seen a fee that cheap even in Long Island! In all seriousness, the food is delicious everytime I've eaten here, it comes out fast, hot, fresh. The service is EXCELLENT. Whether I'm coming in to grab a coffee to go (which is actually really good coffee) or I'm staying for breakfast, they treat me amazingly with attention and a smile. I feel like that's pretty rare, especially in NYC. I like it! If you're eager to escape the lines at Eisenberg's or just looking for some place new, check out this place .",1,1,1

Which was ok it had a little bit of chicken than expected. We also had buffalo wings which was frozen. My spicy fries was brunt. Not to please with that. And my order was chicken  souvlaki.

Never ate here before, I usually go to another diner a few blocks down. Definitely not worth $7.25 (yes $7.25 for a bacon egg and cheese on a roll). Barely any egg and the roll tastes a bit stale. Definitely not worth it and probably won't be coming back.",,,
20,Mary P.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,45,0,3.0,5/1/2016,"Our first choice was closed and our second choice had a line out the door, so we wandered down here in the rain. Quiet, nondescript place -- almost totally dead at 10:15 on a Sunday. I had a cheddar bacon omelet, which was fantastic. The menu offered French fries as an option for a side, but even though I ordered these (because I am basically a philistine), I got home fries. On the one hand, I was too freaking hangry to send them back, and they apparently knew what was good for me, because these were the best home fries I ate all week (and the only ones that were distinct pieces of potato and not just a pile of potato). On the other hand, you guys got my order wrong! Also, I ordered wheat toast and got white, not that I ended up having room for my toast.My husband got the Lumberjack Pancakes. Cakes were good, bacon was a bit burnt. Service was fast and courteous.I mean, this was about right for a third-choice breakfast place on a rainy day. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could, but I'm rounding up because, well, we actually got a table.",,,
21,Sarah R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",103,136,1,4.0,7/29/2014,"Ridgeway Diner is by all means nothing special. But that's what I really like about it. It's a regular diner menu with Greek specialties. The place is quiet, really quiet... I like that. It brings out the hipster in me and makes me want to order coffee (I hate coffee) and write novels (I suck at writing, see following evidence). The food comes out quickly and piping hot-- my gyro was pretty good, albeit a bit heavy handed with the tzatziki (I'll ask them to go light the next time), and my curly fries were were spiraled manna from heaven (hot. crispy. seasoned. curly). Prices were more than reasonable, inexpensive even.I expected the wait staff to be surly and churlish, but they were lovely and insanely on top of their refill game. Perhaps too on top of their refill game. My sis-in-law got asked about 6 times if she wanted more coffee (the answer was 6 no's). They smiled wide and said ""thank you"" when we left. I like that.I like this diner. Its peaceful, friendly vibe makes me forget I'm in Manhattan. Sometimes you need that.",4,1,

Updated review",This review is based entirely on takeout for lunch of one beef Gyro at $7.45 + sales tax.  Upon entering I scanned the dinning area which is not entirely packed with patrons.  The Gyro was plentiful of beef and yogurt cream.  Service was average as I waited for five minutes of arrival to the register.  Ridgeway staff appear stolid to service patrons.,2,,2
29,ryan e.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,14,0,1.0,8/5/2016,"Really the worst. I dont understand how a diner in new york can be this bad. Its pretty basic stuff. I ordered a greek omelette, which, everywhere else in the WORLD includes spinach, so I had to order a side of spinach to get what I wanted. I skipped the potatoes and toast, but still ended up paying TWENTY BUCKS! Not to mention the service was terrible and the atmosphere was tense and creepy. Ruined my morning. Its a DINER. basic stuff. sorry guys.",,1,
30,Ann S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,0,4.0,6/6/2017,"Excellent diner, one of the few left in NYC with tasty fresh food, polite service, and reasonable prices. I regularly have lunch here since moving back to NY and have never had a bad meal.  The BLT has real room temperature tomatoes, unlike the semi-frozen squishy stuff at other diners.  The tuna salad is solid, rather than the runny mess I've been served at other places. Salads and fries are crisp. Portions are normal sized, not huge, another plus in my book. Wait staff is politely friendly, not fawning. And the place is blessedly quiet -- no piped music- such a rarity now in NY.  Only thing I'd change:  atmosphere could use a boost -  decor is a bit tired.",,,

The food is typical comforting diner food, and that's how I like my diner food. I ordered a corned beef hash and my friend ordered an omelette with a side of sausage. The corned beef hash and the accompanying home fries were tasty and filling. The beef sausage looked a bit like chorizo but tasted quite good as well. The experience really reminded me of my college days.",4,,
33,Richard S.,"New York, NY",23,97,75,4.0,9/20/2012,"I have found the BLAND center of the universe and it's the Ridgeway Diner. While that sounds like a bad thing, it's not, especially if bland is what you want at any given time. Clean, well lit, no terrible music or monster screen TV playing CNN, no psychodrama, no super hot waitress, no experimental, groundbreaking fusion cuisine, it's just what you expect from these kinds of diners which are really Greek family restaurants that are called diners in New York City, where all the DINERS have been removed. I ordered a Greek salad, which was fine, but nothing special, and included no onions. I'm sure I could have then asked for onions... but I was already, by that time, into the bland trip. A couple next to me were having the most boring conversation I've ever heard... I usually don't listen in, but I do believe now it was a performance by members of a guerrilla theater troop of the confrontationally dull. Someone else was at the counter ordering ""fries, extra crispy."" I almost wept, hearing that. I saw someone who looked just like me way in the back, but I realized a mirror on the back wall made the whole place look twice as long, and that boring dude WAS me. Located at 666 (well, almost) Avenue of the Average (is there a more boring street in Manhattan than 6th Ave?), I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, a quick snack before the theater of the absurd, or maybe the perfect location to break up with someone or ask to borrow money. I love these places, these ""diners,"" and don't believe they are not endangered because they are. It's not the Starbucks that will eventually take over these sacred spaces, it's the NEXT Starbucks we haven't even seen yet... the horror.",3,9,2

The whole special was going to cost 9.95, I was charged 3.95 for eating the included soup which I should not have been.

A waiter that continuously refilling my water without me having to make eye contact or asking, will always have a 5-star rating from me. That just shows how attention they are giving. -- In addition, when my classmates and I came the last time, we were there for a while even though we finished our food already, and the waiter still made us feel welcome by refilling our water.

Unfortunately, I ordered the pancake breakfast and they were the worst pancakes I've ever eaten. If a diner cant make a decent pancake, then thats a problem. I wouldnt come back. My colleagues were ok with their food but they all said they had better elsewhere. I wouldn't come here unless I was really hungry and this was the only place open in NYC.",1,,1
60,Meli R.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,40,10,1.0,11/20/2008,"THERE WAS A CATERPILLAR in my food.  It was fuzzy and in my greek salad amoungst the oregano.  I had eatan all of it with the exception of that last bite, the bite that does you in.  And I just ate a whole shish ke bob on a pita. I started playing with that last bite and there she was.  They asked if I wanted something else, no I dont.  They said they would comp my meal but my boyfriend had to pay for his.  I refused and left $5 for the waiter.  I tried keeping quiet about the whole situation until the manager was rude and sarcastic to me.  I'm the one who almost ate a bug!  So I made a scene and left.  Too bad, I use to go here all the time.  Food is not bad and decently priced.  But I can't respect a manager being rude to me and trying to make me pay as though I walk around with caterpillars in my pocket and plop them into my last salad bite to save a mere $7.",3,2,1
