It's really clean... and I usually get icked out with anything public, especially movie theaters, etc.If you NEED to drink while you're there (and I did).. I highly recommend a double shot in the Long Island Iced Tea.. it was really tasty and stronger than I'd expected. It comes in this cute cup that you can take home... will definitely be used as a pre-gamer in the future.Cute decor...I'd definitely return to see another show!",5,2,3

Updated review","New World Stages.The performances I have seen at the New World Stages have been superior, Five Star, I loved them all.But whom ever designed the seating in the auditoriums ought to be ashamed for having completely ignored the comfort of the patrons. Steep stairs, black in color, without handrails.Narrow seats, especially for typical American butts.Rows too close together, making it impossible to pass in front of seated patrons. Tall patrons find their knees hit the back of the seat in front of them. I'm guessing maximizing seats was more important to the designers than the comfort of the patrons.Inadequate rest room facilities. Men and women need to line up. Today, at a performance, the 20-minute intermission was not enough time for the patrons to comfortably relieve themselves, and get back into their New World Stages, as a venue, Two and One/Half Stars.",1,,
3,Julio G.,"Newark, NJ",223,362,1211,5.0,1/21/2018,"Very clean. Very new. Very nice. Very small stages..... but always great shows performing. I've seen a few shows here, it's pretty great. The bar is insanely overpriced..... but it's NYC. Don't bring a lot of bags, it'll slow you down but if you do it's fine, they don't throw out your food. They search for weapons (I thought I was sneaking my coke, as in cola, but the guard just looked right passed it) not candies and bottles of water. The staff is super friendly and super helpful, cheerful, too cheerful but that's not necessarily a bad thing. From my experience most of the staff are in the theater world and full of interesting stories and things to say! Did I mention they're cheerful? Overall this is a great theater to visit and watch a show, they do so many shows ! Check them out online or show up and buy a ticket!Enjoy the performance!!!* ***********Heres a good IDEA *********************Did you enjoy reading the review ?******************PLEASE Share some  ************************* vote for this review!**************",1,,

While it could be easy to get lost, they have a lot of employees stationed throughout the complex to assist and direct you. It is less formal than Broadway theaters, so you don't feel the need to dress up. We watched Avenue Q which was very good and funny. Also, the drinks were reasonably priced for a theater.",,,
5,Cory B.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,109,672,5.0,9/23/2017,"New World Stages is a unique space. They host a lot of off-broadway shows including the famous Avenue Q which I have seen before. Recently I have seen Clockwork Orange here because I am big Stanley Kubrick fan.The place is very big, spacey, contemporary and sanitized. Because of its size and unconditional arrangement it might be hard first time coming here to find where your theater is.The staff here are nice and helpful. As for the shows they are usually really good and you don't need to be dressy at all.Overall a nice place to go see a show.",,,

7,Florence C.,"Springfield, NJ",1353,294,1845,4.0,4/6/2017,"Impressive modern interior with 5 theaters. I ordered Gazillion Bubble Show tickets via Groupon for pick-up. Doors opened 30 minutes before the show. With zero lines, I was able to get the tickets from the ticket booth right away. They just asked for my last name and handed me an envelope.Staff was super helpful with guiding us to the right theater and our seats. During the show, they remained vigilant in managing/handling the audience (mostly families with children). Currently, this venue houses 4 shows: Gazillion Bubble Show, Avenue Q, Church & State, and Not that Jewish. Theaters are fully accessible and restrooms which seem clean are wheelchair-accessible on the orchestra and mezzanine levels. Wednesdays to Mondays, you can grab a drink downstairs in The Green Room and enjoy it there or take it with you to the theater.There's an Icon parking deck right across the street and several other decks down the street which cost around $50 for an ""oversized"" vehicle (which includes crossovers) for 3 or 4 hours on a Sunday afternoon. From central Jersey, the trip just took a half hour. With these features and tons of eateries nearby, it's a great place to see a show.",78,62,84

All of the staff outside helping groups get their tickets and whatnot situation were friendly, and will call was just as professional and courteous. It's a lot bigger than it looks like on the outside and I didn't realize until I got downstairs that there were multiple plays/performances there at a given time. The show I saw here was Avenue Q and it was just a great as I had hoped! Aside from giving an in-depth review of that show I will say that all the bartenders downstairs and servers walking around taking orders were great and made sure we were taken care of throughout the show. I hope to see another show here in the future!",2,,
9,Katrina O.,"Staten Island, NY",124,75,0,5.0,5/17/2018,"Came here to see Jersey Boys and this place is great! Very clean and very nice staff. We were shocked when someone was walking around the theater bringing drinks to people's seats! As far as the concessions go, everything is fairly priced. The theaters are somewhat small, but it just makes for a more intimate performance, which to us was a great thing. The bathroom situation is a little tight, but they seem to do a good job of staggering the shows going in and out. Looking forward to coming back!",,,
10,David John A.,"Weehawken, NJ",103,101,169,5.0,3/16/2017,"The place is pretty huge, came here recently to see Avenue Q with the lady and we were pleasantly surprised. The theater is located sub level in a huge, multi-floored facility which they keep very clean by the way, everything was sparkling! NWS is very modern looking in appearance and has some industrial flare to it, such has large pipes suspended above the ceiling. Staff was friendly and helpful, the drink prices were reasonable between $8-$9 bucks each and the seats were comfy. Certainly looking forward to our next trip here!",,,
11,Michelle Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",349,104,20,5.0,6/19/2017,"Came here to watch Avenue Q this past Saturday. It's my second time watching the off Broadway show so you already know how I feel about it. I bought tickets through Groupon and finding our seats was a breeze with the help of the staff. There is a bar right outside the theater and you're allowed to bring the drinks to your seat. Despite being allowed to eat (one of the staff sells candy) and drink in the theater, it is very well kept and clean. We sat in the Orchestra and the show started promptly and we did not have to wait too long for the show to start. I don't want to give away any spoilers but the show is hilarious, the cast is very talented and you will definitely walk away with a new perspective and a bunch of laughs. The songs were all very catchy and they have been added to my Spotify playlist so I can relive the experience whenever I want.",2,,

Never realized how big the place in multiple levels and large enough restrooms for everyone. I came very dressed up but i should have known better, everyone was dressed down. thats just me trying to be fancy.Any ways i came to watch Avenue Q, which did not disappoint me.

15,Brandon B.,"Chicago, IL",545,1312,629,4.0,11/18/2017,"I saw Clockwork Orange here, I didn't realize the place was going to be such a huge complex of interconnected spaces, apparently an old movie theater that was converted.   The space for Clockwork orange was long, narrow, and inclined, which isn't totally natural for a theater space but it worked for this smaller show.   The staff were friendly and the space got you up close to the actors (spit, sweat, fluids).   They have drinks at concession stands with cocktail options.   Nice for a smaller show!",1,,1

17,Tova B.,"Jersey City, NJ",97,352,440,5.0,9/9/2016,"I had wanted to see Avenue Q for about ten years, I heard it was hilarious. You can imagine how excited I was when I found tickets on sale for the show. Of course I was going to get them! We showed up to the venue. The entrance is a little confusing. My fiance had been waiting for me and thought the entrance was on one side, so we walked over, only to find out it was actually on the other side where we have been standing. I was kind of wondering how big the stage was, because I didn't really see an area for a playhouse. We went inside the venue, picked up our tickets and took the escalator down... the space downstairs is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. We arrived pretty early for the show. We hung out for a bit, checked out the art work before they let us into the theatre. It's a smaller theatre, which I like because no one is really that far, you have a good view from most of the seats, I think. Our seats were second row. I do think the seats need a little care, I think mine was broken. I like that they had a concession girl going through the crowd before the show. The show was hilarious, my fiance, who hadn't heard of the show before loved it. So glad I peed before the show, because pretty sure I would have peed myself otherwise. Actors were great. So glad we went to see it. Love the show, loved the space.",1,1,1

Love the nod to it's history spread out here and there.Of course this is NY history but also part of my life. However, this theater has evolved--haven't we all? It is a renovated space with the same structure and inspiration to roam about. I went twice in 2015 and both times I walked away feeling exactly as I did years earlier: what's next? Lol.Not much to complain about here. Bathrooms are clean and easily accessible.  Show designations could be clearer but there is always staff on-hand to assist. My last visit was for an early performance during the weekday and yelp lists this place as closed. Don't go by the yelp hours, obviously. For the love of all that is holy, research any show you are about to watch here for discounts.  We purchased tickets online at a discount and I was happy to see that we got a great deal even with added fees.Nice way to kill time and be cozy on a slow afternoon.",8,7,8

Updated review","I went with a group of four see A Clockwork Orange. I was seated in a hard seat on the stage and asked the usher to please let me have a soft seat (around 50 seats were empty). I had been in a car accident 3 days ago. She embarrassed me and cruelly wouldn't allow me. Hard to enjoy the show after that. Most unkind of House management to humiliate an injured person whose request washave been so easy to fill.Beware if you are disabled or injured. New World Stages treated me imperiously and forced me to sit in a hard chair when 50 soft seats were open. The African American female usher frog-marched me and humiliated me. Management has turned a blind eye, as is the often the case when women report a problem, but I now need therapeutic help.",,,
22,Mandy L.,"Manhattan, NY",416,406,71,4.0,6/10/2016,"Came here bc I got tickets from Yelp for One Funny Mother and had a great time Pros:- After grabbing the tickets a nice young man told us where to go (down the stairs and to the right) - Outside drinks are not allowed and I had just purchased a grande tea but the bar area was very nice in letting me sit there and attempt finishing the drink (didn't happen) - The Green Room includes the bar and a small stage for open mic? - directly across from the entrance to the stages - Other yelpers are accurate in that the stage is pretty small so you can see from the back rows pretty well (sat in row L)- All the attendants were great - very nice and helpful - Dena for One Funny Mother was great - at first we thought the story line was fabricated but then found out it was Dena's real life, which made it funnier; if you need a good laugh def check this production out! - Fairly clean bathrooms Def will come back to check out other productions Cons: - The person at the ticketing booth got annoyed after I asked him a couple of questions (never been here before so I got questions to ask) so that was that",,,
23,Lourdes M.,"Bellerose, NY",199,704,1729,4.0,11/27/2015,"The building has 5 small theaters (we watched the Shear Madness play at Stage 4) and all are located in the lower level. It is not far from the center of Theater District, hall is artistically and modernly decorated, it is clean on its entirety, has good seating arrangement for a good view of the stage , has 2 full bar servicing the theater goers, alcohol is allowed inside the theater and has nice ticket booth staff. You'll  feel at home right away when you get on your seat, lighting is conducive, has easy to follow seat numbers aside from the staff leading your way.Other shows currently showing are mostly small and interactive plays e.g. Madlibs, Avenue Q, Mars are from Men Women are from Venus etc. I am definitely coming back.",4,4,4
24,Samantha L.,"Halethorpe, MD",83,23,0,5.0,4/16/2018,Went to see a Sunday matinee of Avenue Q and we had a blast. Theater was clean and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Checking items was only $1. There were several shows going on at once but everything was very well organized. The bathrooms were clean and stocked. The cast were talented and the tickets reasonably price. Acoustics were good and seats were average level of comfortable. We didn't have drinks but they were available and there was a server at the start and during intermission taking orders. She seemed very friendly and speedy. I'll be back.,,,
25,Sally W.,"New York, NY",680,990,6006,5.0,11/10/2015,"I remember when New World Stages used to be a movie theatre, a Loews Cineplex back in the 1990's where they played second run movies. I used to hang out here when it was a movie theatre, all the time. IMHO, it was the best theater in Manhattan back in the day. I still remember when they closed down in the early 2000's. My friends and I were quite sad. In the mid 2000's it reopened as a theatrical stage, so it was still awesome. I just couldn't afford it back then. I think it went through a couple of name changes until it was changed to New World Stages. There is 5 stages in the New World Stage which is pretty awesome for an Off-Broadway theatre. So New World Stages is a Off-Broadway multiplex complex. How can you not like that. I've seen Toxic Avenger, Gazillion Bubble Show, Avenue Q, Bullet for Adolf, iLuminate, Clinton the Musical, and many more shows at the New World Stages. For an Off-Broadway theatre, it is one of my favorites because it's clean, well lit, all the sight lines are great, and on the modern side. I would come back here in a heartbeat.",2,1,2
26,Rich C.,"Bound Brook, NJ",75,181,212,4.0,10/30/2016,"New World Stages located at 340 West 50th Street is a great venue to enjoy an Off Broadway play.  It is in easy walking distance from TKTS in Time Square.  The theater is below ground and quite comfortable.  The structure is modern and has no supports that may interfere with your view.  Acoustics are incredible.There are plenty of restrooms.  Drinks and snacks are available onsite at a premium price.  We saw ""Avenue Q, The Musical,"" at New World Stages and would certainly return to see another show.",1,,
27,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",417,497,8935,5.0,11/3/2015,"Love the venue.  Love their staff.  Love their programming. They always do an amazing job with conferences and events held here (NAMT, and TEDx Broadway, for example) and have lots of cool little spaces for special ""add-on"" events and happenings. Always look forward to a visit to New World Stages.  Plus they're super close to Hell's Kitchen's two Totto Ramen locations- yummmm. The lack of cell service when you're downstairs in their theaters can be a bit of a bummer - but you don't need it anyway when you're seeing a show!  And when there for a conference kind of event, they're always good about providing it for those who need it.",,,
28,Christine R.,"Houston, TX",44,526,1973,5.0,9/4/2016,A place to come to watch an intimate show in New York. I came to watch a live bubble show that had good ratings. Though it wasn't cheap at $75 a show it was nice to see something different. I thought the show was more geared for smaller kids which I didn't know but it was good for adults as well.,,,
29,Sara K.,"Staten Island, NY",77,185,235,4.0,5/5/2016,"This is a pretty nice theater center, all the processes are streamlined from the security check to the ticket scanning. I have been here several times, and enjoy it! I wish they had a little cafe for coffee if you come especially early.",1,,1
30,Dave W.,"Safety Harbor, FL",408,1225,3074,3.0,2/14/2015,"We've seen multiple plays here. While the cost is affordable and the seats a bit roomier than the normal cramped quarters in the traditional theater district, I can't get the words ""generic"" and ""basic"" out of my mind. This facility does what it needs to do... Provide a lower end play experience for plays not quite ready for Broadway. But, it's like going to a discount two dollar movie theater. There is no live music and the sound is not stellar. The sets are extremely basic. Plus, they shill watered down drinks during intermission. On the positive side, you can be quite close to the stage for much less than on Broadway. Finally, it's way down in the depths of the earth and the escalator is typically out of service. Look in the back and there is an elevator big enough for four people. So, bottom line, if a play is here, I will come see it. New World Stages just doesnt bring any class or a unique feel to the experience.",1,,

32,David H.,"Bluffton, SC",147,1069,754,4.0,1/16/2016,"As far as a theater venue, this is the movie complex version for live plays. My wife and I came to see Avenue Q which was a fun, lighthearted, 'don't take your kids to' play. Our intermission was met by a fire alarm so the play ended up going about 40 minutes longer than planned. A nice way to see the cast up close is when we're all standing in the street waiting for the fire marshall to give us clearance. As far the the Green Room Bar, a bit of a rip off to pay $22 for a double gin & tonic. They give only 2 half shots and you're paying for 10 oz of tonic with a ton of ice. They encourage drinking by coming through the theater offering drinks for sale. Many theaters in a complex that goes far below street level. My wife and I had a great time nevertheless---- even paying $50 for 2 drinks. Stay away from the drinks or bring your own mini bottles.",,,

Don't miss the bar adjacent to the entrance, you can even bring the drinks into the show! How amazing is that, right? We showed up terribly late and missed dinner, so imagine or relief when there was a guy with a tray of snacks walking around. Ruthlessly overpriced of course ($5 for snacks, are you kidding?) but compared to the dinner we were supposed to have had, I guess it was ok. The staff was friendly (even laughed at my jokes about Swedish Fish - hooray right!) and efficient enough. Saw ""Not That Jewish"" with Monica Piper (Yelp tickets!) and it was hilarious! My friend and I laughed so hard we cried. Though I'm pretty sure the lady behind us might have laughed to high it hurt our ears, so maybe that's a part of the reason we cried as well.

34,Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",183,2014,3152,4.0,3/9/2015,"I really like this theater. The stages are smaller than say The Barrymore or the Eugene O'Neill Theaters, so it feels more intimate, more community theater, & there isn't a bad seat in the house. New World Stages is located off Broadway, so you get to see performances for much less than the usual $100-$150 the big theaters charge. It's a quick one-block walk from the ACE Subway line, & the surrounding area isn't the clusterfuck that is the Theater District. I'm definitely a fan. We attended a matinee showing of ""Nevermore: The Imaginary Life & Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe."" You only have to hear about the ways death touched the tortured poet's life to know why his writing leans towards the macabre. The music & costumes were odd, no doubt, which had its charms, but I could not get over nuances in the acting; many of the actresses had a fragile demeanor & would add a high-pitched sound or last word to their sentences. It was very awkward & unnecessary, IMO. I didn't see how that mannerism helped or enhanced these characters. 3.5 stars for this particular show, but would not hesitate to return to one of their many stages for another entertaining performance.",5,4,4

There's not much space on the floor with the rooms because it overlooks the ground floor (which actually has ample gathering space) and is mainly just used for moving between rooms, so keep that in mind while planning things out.

The bar even allowed you to preorder intermission drinks. I would highly recommend that if you want another drink during the play because the bar gets backed up and intermission was not very long.The bar offered $4 sangrias but honestly I didn't care for them even if there were cheap for NYC prices.

Washing and lathering hands is a bit difficult because the soap dispenser is RIGHT above the faucet handle.I came to watch/see/listen to Nevermore, a story about Edgar Allen Poe's life.  I did get bored of the props, but hey - it's off-Broadway and produced on a smaller budget. The stage piece was there the entire night. Props and minor costume changes made the scene dramatic and dark. The sound quality was magical and surrounded me.",,,

But in the theater other shows are being played such as a Bubble Show and Avenue Q. I've seen many shows in this place. It's well organized and the staff is extremely nice.  What I like is how the staff take your drink order and bring it to your seat.  I haven't taken advantage of this yet, but I just might. Also, there's a small karaoke bar in their lounge.  If you want to hangout after the show, that's a great place to mix and mingle. The bathrooms need to be worked on, though!",,1,

Found awesome prices for tickets ($40 for front row seats!).While my wife loved being in the front row, I personally thought the front row of the next section back, or the balcony seating might be better to be able to see everything without turning your head. You could literally reach out and touch the actors from the front row and the seats are at a height level where you're looking at their shins/knees if you look straight ahead.They also serve booze you can bring in or order in to your seat which is a nice little touch. I wonder if they've ever had an issue with noisy drinkers?Will definitely be back.",,1,1

Nice gallery feel to it , walking around u can check out the paintings or hang out at one of the bars or standing areas. Before the show we had drinks at the upstairs bar. Nice little lounge area. I had a Vodka & Cranberry & My cousin had a Corona. Beer was better than my drink , sadly it just tasted like juice which kinda sucked since the two drinks with the vodka in a large cup was $16 dollars , not worth it unless u stick with beer. We got settled at our seats & the show began. The show tells a love story between two of the characters this may sound kind of sappy but it wasn't there is so much going on that u tend to not pay too much attention to the story. The show itself was awesome , lots of energy different types of music & lots & lots of cool dancing. The darkness of course makes the performance  the lights are really fun to watch. Show time was at 8pm it started about 5-7 minutes late if I recall & was done at about 850pm.., so figure it's about 45 minutes or so for the show. Short performance but it was packed with a lot of energy , fun show to check out for sure.",10,,3

There are plenty of clipboard carrying people to check & recheck things are properly located to  milimeter accuracy and be sure you're in the right place, and if not, to ""guide you"" to your destination.I suppose they have public performance, I'm  not sure, but worth a search as it is a very cool location",,,

Then you get your ticket scanned and there is another level down for the various theaters in the building. The bar was offering $4 sangria, which was very tasty and cheap for NYC. You can take it into the theater which is different from other Broadway shows. There was also a waitress and snack guy walking around before the beginning of the show.I attended illuminate, which was an act that won America's Got Talent. The show lasted an hour, which was long enough for the light show this was all about. For an off-Broadway show I would definitely consider New World Stages again.

I remember watching them on America's Got Talent a few years ago and they were awesome. In sync, great choreography, nothing I had seen before. This show as a weak and miserable take on trying to tell a story with some dance thrown in. If I wanted to see a ballet I would have gone to the actual ballet where I'm sure the dancing would have been significantly better. They didn't have any of the cool dance moves and choreography I remember from the show (creating large creatures mostly out of multiple people, etc.) and the plot line was thin at best. Even the times when the groups were dancing it felt a bit sloppy. I was sorely disappointed and wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even children.",,,

The show lasted about an hour which was definitely enough time to be wowed. The choreography was amazinggg. The beats and music definitely had me wanting to join in to dance. The dancers covered many different forms of dance from hip hop, ballet, breakdancing, even salsa. And I loved that you got to interact and take photos with them afterwards. I didn't try any of the drinks so I can't comment on that. But the staff was good with getting everyone seated in a timely manner. Also the artwork displayed throughout the building were great as well.If I could do it all over again the only thing I would change are my seats.

On broadway, I saw Phantom of the Opera and The Book of Mormon.With this venue, I could feel the off-broadway-ness. It's not a bad thing, but I was just used to a classy, nice, old theater, dedicated theater. At New World Stages, there are a few stages (as implied by the title) for multiple broadway shows.

This is few of the only venue where multiple shows adjust their playing times and share the same theater, set, and that is why the theatre rooms are bit smaller than the conventional broadway venues.",4,2,2
62,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1268,914,4.0,1/16/2013,"Back in the 90's, my friends and I would often come to this theater when it was a Cineplex Odeon theater that showed cheap movies.  When movies were on their way out of other theaters, this theater would take them in for a few weeks at (brace yourself), $3 a ticket.  That's right, $3 movies existed in the 90's in midtown Manhattan.  Amazing  yeah?So it was with sadness that I said goodbye to the theater after it shut down.  In its current incarnation, it has been modernized, renovated and turned into a venue for live shows.  The facility has mostly been hollowed out.  You can now see the pipes running along the ceiling and sections are divided by metal and the lighting has a very 'showroom' aspect to it.  Overall it feels very different than the movie theater that used to be here, but it's pleasant and welcoming in its own way.Downstairs, a coat check greets you along with a bar.  This is a full service bar that serves drinks there or allows you to take them to your seats.  In the main hall I was at, there were two sets of rest rooms and two bars.  A small stand next to my show (Avenue Q) had souvenirs from the show ranging from T-shirts to cups.  The staff sends waiters in before the show to take drink orders delivered to your seat before the show or during intermission.The theater itself was set up nicely.  It's relatively small so almost any seat is a good seat, but I was fortunate enough to sit three rows back in the center.  It gave me a great look at the set on stage and the actors performing.  Screens hang on the sides to allow for multimedia content to be part of the show.  I noticed in the back connected to the balcony were television screens allowing the actors to see in the control room.The staff at this theater was pleasant and helpful.  They were way efficient and the bar served drinks pretty quickly.  I was actually impressed how the waitresses were able to navigate a theater to pass out drinks while another guy managed an old fashioned snack tray connected to him via a strap (selling candies and other snacks).  The Sangria I had was okay, nothing special but it was refreshing after not drinking anything for two hours.I'm happy that this old theater has found new life as a live action venue, however I do miss my $3 movie days.",1,,3

I read somewhere it used to be a multiplex and so you go down several stories and there's all these small theaters. We picked up tickets at box office, very easy to manage and every employee we met was nice and professional. They guided you right to your theater through the winding layout. In the theater itself there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house although I'd recommend getting as close as possible. We were in the second row. The performance was excellent, the actors were fantastic, and the sound quality was 10/10. There was a bar outside the theater where you could buy drinks to bring in which was a nice touch.

68,Laura P.,"New York, NY",893,408,246,5.0,7/2/2012,"I've wanted to see ""Avenue Q"" for years. A Broadway staple (now off-), ""Avenue Q"" was said to be Broadway's funniest until ""Book of Mormon"" came stomping in (I will be seeing that later this summer and will review it also). But I would like to argue that ""Avenue Q"" is still Broadway's funniest, even without ignoring ""Book of Mormon,"" just because of what the play does and how it does it. Without spoiling anything, the play is a parody of Sesame Street. Actors and actresses, a total of seven of them, held puppets or acted as humans. Watch the preview video on the show's website for a hilarious taste of what it's all about. My friends and I were in stiches the whole time, laughing at almost everything. Some songs include ""Everyone's A Little Bit Racist,"" ""What Do You Do With A B.A. In English?"" ""I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today"" and ""I Wish I Could Go Back To College."" The play nails its role as a parody and is an absolute masterpiece. The acting is super stellar and the dialogue, lyrics and musicality are on par with the quality of everything else (AKA super stellar). All the hype is 167% accurate. This review is supposed to be about the venue, not a review of the play itself, although I see myself as a qualified member of the intangible Playbill society from my extensive relationship with on- and off-Broadway shows. The venue of New World Stages is super mod. The people who work there are hilarious, especially the guy selling merchandise. ""Now folks,"" he said as we began funneling into the theater, ""the play is set to last around an hour and forty-five minutes, letting you out around 10:15. But this 'Avenue Q' mug,"" he said, holding up the mug and pausing for dramatic effect, ""this mug will last forever."" While you wait for the show to start, a waitress walks around the theater offering audience members the change to pre-order drinks to skip the line at intermission. ""We have beer, wine, full bar service and twelve-dollar bad ideas,"" she shouted to the audience. The venue is clean and spacious. The theater itself is also clean and the seats are not cramped whatsoever. You have plenty of space to fall out of your seat laughing (they definitely took this into account). Now, I imagine all of the shows at New World Stages are run in a similar manner with the friendly staff and swift handling of the crowd. Many different shows are put on here, their top three including ""Avenue Q,"" ""Rent,"" and ""Voca People,"" all of which are a good time. Our third row, center seats were priced at $92.50. This is a commendable price in my opinion. Tickets for $92.50 at ""Phantom of the Opera,"" for example, are in the last row in the second upper mezzanine, so I see no reason at all to complain about the price when I was literally feet from the cast. New World Stages offered a fantastic experience surrounding an absolutely fantastic play. With their experimental quality and fun, modern twist on the normal Broadway show experience, you absolutely cannot go wrong. Thank you, monsters of ""Avenue Q.""",2,1,2

The stage is small so I recommend getting the cheapest ticket because you can still see pretty well from the back. The staff was very helpful and they brought us directly to our seats. Avenue Q - I like it! It was pretty much explaining the life in the city. Something that can happen everyday and everyone can definitely relate. It was about 2 hours long. You'll be surprise how well they put an act together with the puppets. Iluminate- I loved it! If you like dancing and cool effects I think this might just be right for you. Lasted for about an hour (I wished it was longer). They told me to turn off my phone because it would interfere with the performance. I did just that because I didn't want to be the jerk who ruins it for everybody.,4,,3

The theatre has many stages, so you'll likely be on line with small children who are there to see the bubble show! There are plenty of bars in this place, which is great, since you'll encounter less lines. Even sweeter, waiters and waitresses go around before the show and take intermission drink orders! Not too shabby! My only gripe is that the bathrooms are much too small for the females and there tends to be a loooong line, especially at intermission.

It was very cool to add to the wall and I look forward to checking if it's there the next time I'm in town!  There are also a bunch of bars and restaraunts right within walking distance (like Alfie's!) which was great to stop in before the show.",,,

The bathrooms are clearly marked and clean.

I stumbled upon the New World on a cold, February afternoon with a group of friends inquiring about Avenue Q tickets. The gentlemen at the front door was quick to give information on how to score rush tickets. He also instructed us to tag team the rush ticket line with other members of our group and switch out between the rush line and the bar. Brilliant! (Should you attempt this, make sure you know how many rush tickets are permitted to be sold to each individual.) Speaking of the bar, the folks were friendly and knowledgeable about the booze and the theatre. The bar wasn't as modern as the rest of the theatre, but it had a lot of charm and the staff was great. The bar staff can also be seen delivering concessions in the theatre before the show- kudos for these urban multi-taskers.

101,Zoe M.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,4/19/2015,"This is by far my favourite theatre in the city. It manages to hit the sweet spot for three critical factors: amazing performances, great prices, and a comfortable setting.When I first moved to New York, ""theatre"" for me was basically synonymous with one word: Broadway. So I did the TKTS thing, and enjoyed some great shows at some not-so-great prices: paying $80 or $90 (""discount"" prices!) for a few hours' entertainment is just not something that I can justify on a regular basis.But then I got savvier, and discovered TDF. If you're a student or senior or other qualified person, this is where the real discount tickets are. And for a little while, I was thrilled that I could get Broadway tickets for only $45. I was similarly happy to get occasional discount tickets through school. And yet when I actually went to these shows, I often came away disappointed... because on Broadway, you get what you pay for. At the $50 price point, the seats were terrible! When we went to see Phantom, one of my all-time favourite musicals, we were sitting so far under the mezzanine that we couldn't even see the chandelier--and the chandelier scene is one of the defining moments of the show.So for the most part, my love of theatre was going unmet. I was spending too much money on mediocre seats, and coming away disappointed. Except for those few times when I dared to venture off-Broadway, and saw a performance at New World Stages.... Cue heavenly music. Every time I went to this theatre, I came away happy with the combination of comfort, value, and a stellar theatrical performance.New World Stages puts on the same great shows that you'd see on Broadway, sometimes direct transfers of Tony award winners like Avenue Q or Peter and the Starcatchers. But you can get these tickets for a fraction of the price, and the seats will still be fantastic. Most of their shows seem to be available on TDF at some point, and I've always ended up paying maybe $32 for relatively central seats in something like the fifth row. When I compare it to the ""good"" $90 Broadway tickets, or the ""cheap"" $45 Broadway tickets where all the actors look tiny because you're so far away.... Well, there really is no comparison. New World Stages offers better seats and better prices for the same great shows.The theatre experience is much better, too. At a typical Broadway theatre, you'll wait outside in the rain or snow because there's no lobby to speak of, and when you do get in at last you'll spend most of your time in line for the tiny bathroom. At New World Stages, you can go inside right away and start enjoying drinks in the spacious lobby, and you probably won't have to wait in a pre-show bathroom line at all because there are two large restrooms designed to accommodate audiences for multiple stages. It's a completely different kind of theatre-going experience, and a much more pleasant one. My only complaint is that the lobby could do with a bit more seating, but I'm not above sitting on the floor if I have to.To make a long story short, I've enjoyed every single show I've seen at this theatre, and it's become my first choice whenever we're looking for something to see. Broadway-quality shows at off-Broadway prices, and in a more comfortable theatre to boot? Yes please! I just wish this theatre had even more stages, because I really can't get enough.",1,,

It was one of those hectic, hectic work weeks where I had no time to plan for a Saturday with my mentee.The theater itself rubs off of some of the design you'd find in Astoria's Museum of the Moving Image: kind of like an industrial space station, which was really cool.The staff are refreshingly jubilant and patient with children running around (sometimes in circles), and the bathrooms were ample and clean. While waiting for the show to open up its doors, we were witnesses to a kid's birthday party in one of the lower stage areas, the theme of which appeared to involve making and eating bagels & schmear on color-coordinated table settings.The theater space itself was very accommodating for adults & children.

At first I couldn't found this place and got lost but evenually found the threater. It look very small from the outside but to my surprise everything was under ground. There were 2 small bar downstaire which was a plus and the drinks wasn't outrages. A beer cost $6 which wasn't bad. The stages was close enough to see everything. Rent the show itself was ok, I saw the movie which was good but the 1st part of the show was slow so I took a small nap lol. After the intermission, the show got more excited because we were more involve w.the charter and everyone want to know what happen next. I am glad i finally got a chance to watch RENT in NYC so I am a happy person.",1,1,1

That's a five-star rating in my book.Hip and modern theater complex, home to many provocative and entertaining Off Broadway shows. I saw Avenue Q here. You really can't get a bad seat as the theater is intimate enough for everyone to enjoy the shows. They also handle simultaneous performances very smoothly. Plenty of bathroom options so there is never a long wait. Great drink specials ($5 sangria) and plenty of ways to purchase them. They have local musicians performing upstairs in the Time Out New York Lounge. I also performed here awhile ago for a karaoke competition sponsored by TONY. It was loads of fun. Got to hear some great talent and meet some great people. It's nice that this theater respects many levels and forms of art. Bravo!",,,1

Very modern and more minimalistic than other theaters, New World Stages is lit by soft fluorescents and encourages boozing it up (they even send waiters to your aisle to take your drink orders).I sat in the upper mezzanine and was initially thinking it would be very far back, but since the stages are small and imtimate, I could see everything clearly.

One thing I really like is the laidback atmosphere of the theater. After I found out that you can purchase snacks and drinks to eat at your seat, I decided to be a total cheapo and bring my own snacks and bottled water. Call me a penny pincher, but I thought it was a great idea. :) My only quibble is the ticket price. Sure, we got a pretty good deal on TKTS, but you might expect the full ticket price to be cheaper for an off-Broadway venue that houses five different theaters.But whatever - we had a great time!",3,1,3
133,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1846,4.0,3/11/2012,"New World Stages is a completely unique Broadway (technically just off Broadway) venue which incorporates 5 theaters of varying sizes (2 are 500 seats, 2 are 350, and 1 is 200), all in an elaborate dual level underground facility. In addition to the theaters there is a small bar/lounge open to the public which occasional has events like open mic night which I hear is very impressive. The theaters are very clean, they have refreshments for sale outside the theater and from usher's in the theater, and everything seems to be run very smoothly. I find the ticket prices to be high but that's to be expected. I've seen two shows there and had a good experience both times. Right now the shows going on at NWS are: Rent, Avenue Q, Freud's Last Session, Million Dollar Quartet, Voca People, and the Gazillion Bubble Show.",,,

I'm taking one, do you want the other?""Hell yeah!I have ridden/walked pass this place forever but never actually went inside. I was getting more excited about seeing the building than anything (don't judge!). Once we went in and down a level (and another level) I was struck by how LARGE the place is underground!  I mean, they were tunneling that baby like crazy during construction because they had numerous plays going on at the same time, bars flowing and SPACE. The layout is great, each theater has its own little area and attendant. Once inside the theater, you are close enough to see everything with out feeling suffocated or (conversely) feel like you are watching ants. We had rockstar seats (thank you redacted!) WITH adult libations brought prior and during the performance (!!)--which by the by, was simply outstanding. the quality of acting on that stage was enough to make a believer out of me. Off-Broadway, nothin. The caliber of performances were at the level (and repeatedly surpassed) a lot of the stuff I've seen on the Great White Way these past few years.  I will be back very soon--time to catch up on my plays. :)",1,,

Having to walk through a blizzard and over 4 inches of snow and 20 mph winds it was nice to relax with watching Avenue Q. This theatre seems to have other shows located in it. Its a small theatre for Avenue Q and we were in th 5th row center thanks to the half price booth in times square. We could see all the actors and actresses facial expressions. Bathrooms had about 10 stalls which isn't too bad and they were clean. They have a great bar downstairs which has almost a club atmosphere with hip hop music playing. Prices are very reasonable for around 10.00 you can get a long island ice tea. Great playhouse!,3,2,3

138,Carol S.,"Los Angeles, CA",311,296,94,1.0,11/15/2010,"I simply had a bad experience with New World Stages as a venue. My best friend had to cancel her NYC trip due to her grandmother dying with terminal cancer. I was told by a man at the New World Stages that I could just hold onto the tickets and use them again in the future. The only catch is that I have to call the day I want to watch and make sure there are enough seats.  Sounds simple enough, I thought!NOT that simple!! Turns out that every time I called, I would get a different answer about how the ""Past Dated"" ticket thing worked. After I thought I found a date to watch it, it all started to fall apart.The box office doesn't open until 1pm, so if you want to watch a matinee show you would only find out in 1 hour! Also, the guy who worked the box office was such a jerk about it! I went to the actual box office again and he was so mean and rude! He said that HE was the one that gets to decide whether or not he FEELS like giving out tickets for that evening because they don't normally do it on that day. First of all, the VERY first guy that told me about Past Date tickets said I could use them ANY day. But now they're telling me only certain days when the shows aren't that popular. Then someone tells me Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only.The  mean jerk guy tells me its just whenever HE feels like giving them out. He says to come back or call at 4pm, right before the show. So I try to act really nice and sweetly ask if he could remember me and know that my friend is only in town from California (same friend who's grandma was sick) for the weekend. He is so stern and cold and shrugs me off. I call back and he says no.  Great. I had to walk around all day in anxiety wondering if he would let us watch the show that day. He could have just said No from the beginning! It's worse than the lottery because at least you find that out within half an hour and it's totally fair!I'm so annoyed by all the confusion. It's been 6 months since I've been able to watch the show because of all the miscommunication and going back & forth. The rude man didn't help either. I will never want to watch a show from here again because their customer service sucks! I'll go to a REAL Broadway box office.",9,,

143,Rebecca S.,"Philadelphia, PA",662,381,100,5.0,12/17/2012,"Holy crap is this place deceiving! After trying earlier in the morning to get tickets to Once and rushing (but failing) Book of Mormon, a friend and I headed to TKTS to get tickets to whatever else piqued our interest for the day and Bare was it. Upon arriving at New World a few hours later, I first said ""holy college flashback"" as massive hangovers suffered as the result of too many nights at Blockheads just next door flooded my mind, I then said ""I never even knew this was here!"". We already had our tickets so we were able to bypass the lines in the foyer off to the right and were shown the way downstairs to our left. When you first walk in, you have no clue just how much performance space is here as much of it is actually in the lower level of the theater. After walking downstairs we were shown the way to the fully stocked bar to our left, but went straight for the theater instead. Here's where it gets interesting....down here there are FOUR theaters! Each ranging in size from the 200-400 something capacity range. The space leading to each theater is modern, concrete, yet open with local artists work on the walls....I bet this place is awesome for hosting special events. We were in one of their larger theaters and even at that 400 person capacity, there was not one bad seat in the room. A server took drink orders and would deliver directly to your seat and you could pre-order a cocktail for intermission that again would be delivered to you without having to battle the obnoxious lines. How cool is that? I'm not sure that they offer this service at other performances, and though I didn't take advantage of it, think it's a super awesome extra bonus to seeing a show here.I would love to go back again to see Avenue Q now that it's off-broadway and easier to get tickets to, shit, I'd go back to see pretty much any performance here if it means being in a less stuffy environment with better viewing and comfier seats than some of the stuffy broadway theater houses.

The theater complex is very modern looking, which is much different than the older, more ornate theaters you see on Broadway. Each of the theaters are small and intimate, and there aren't really any bad seats. What sets New World apart is its food and beverage policy. Not only are you allowed to bring them inside to watch the show, they make it easy for you to do so. There is someone selling snacks inside the theater before the show and during intermission. And your drinks are brought to you at your seat. You can even pre-order a drink before the show to be delivered at intermission, how cool is that?",1,,2

Anyway, they had $4 sangria at the bar, and though it may not be the best sangria, it was cheap and delicious enough. The feel of the place was mellow and friendly, I loved it. The musicians were talented, and I especially enjoyed listening to a couple of the singers. Each song showcased a different person, each with his or her own style (instrument or voice).

Weird how he didn't see me right in front of his face? He kept on taking other customer's orders and even got out of his way to do so. I even said 'hi' at one point and it's as if I wasn't there. Is it because I'm Asian? Not a very New Yorker thing to be racist. Plus, people want to be in the best of moods to enjoy the show. I really didn't get where the attitude was coming from. It's like he didn't want to give me the satisfaction of taking my order because I was in front of him and waiting eagerly to just get a bottle of water. He even told me, ""there's a bar downstairs that you can order from too you know"", after seeing that I was standing there for the longest time.

Well, firstly, it is a woman bubble artist named Ana Yang who is originally from Viet Nam.  She emigrated to Yugoslavia and married her husband who taught her ""bubbles"" as an art form and produces her show.  Sort of ""kid oriented"", the show, using her warmth, talent and genuine smiles, made me and many other ""adults"" feel and act like children (I am 66).Her talents for making soap bubbles ""art"" cannot be questioned and her ""act"" certainly makes it float.   The finaly, a laser and bubble (millions of them) falling on the audience like a snow storm was awesome and very well choreographed with excellent musical accompaniment.  She has appeared in Vegas and all over the world and has been a hit everywhere.

A short walk from the heart of Broadway brings you to this modern well lit space. New World Stages is a clean and welcoming space. Before you enter the theater grab an affordable drink at the bar.

You wouldn't know that all of the theaters are basically underground unless you walked in. The theater where we saw Avenue Q was small and intimate, which was perfect for this show. I would definitely come see other shows at this venue.",,,
175,Chita D.,"New Erection, VA",2,229,6,5.0,11/11/2008,"Thanks to Jane C. & Yelp, the b/f I were able to check out Rock of Ages last night at this venue. The establishment made me feel like we were going into an adult version of Space Mountain (all in good taste). I liked the concept of the minimalist industrial look they had going on. The b/f recalls catching $3 movies at this place & stated that the makeover was done quite well. The staff was pleasant, the show was cool. The fact that each theater is roughly the size of a small movie theater, in my opinion, permits you to enjoy a show in it's full glory...as if you have 5th row (from pretty much any angle) or something. I'd definitely go back to check out other things.",5,3,5
176,Angela C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",124,260,8,4.0,2/5/2009,"I miss the $3 movie theater too! I had some really awesome high school times at that theater, where (now that it's long gone I can admit) I actually even movie-hopped. Talk about being a cheap-ass bastard. The freakin movie was already only $3 for goodness sakes. Sorry, $3 movie theater. If you were still here, I'd go to your box office and give you $12 + interest for the money I cheated you. You were good to me, and I took advantage of you. Now you're long gone and I can't even express to you all my remorse. Even tho I can't make it up to you, I can try to right my wrongs by supporting your future generations. And what a future generation it is... when you walk into New World Stages/Dodger Stages (whatever), it looks like a 80's attempt to create a futuristic multiplex theater spaceship. If you've ever been to Disney World, think the Space Mountain ride. It's kind of tacky, IMHO, but it's still a nicely done set up for the number of stages it has. It's a nice off-Bway place to watch a show - good seats all around, and nice accoustics. The show selection has been pretty good too, so no excuses! Go check it out and support theater!",1,2,2
177,Heath R.,"Los Angeles, CA",237,851,30,5.0,6/4/2007,"C. and I went here tonight for the inaugural Webby Awards Online Film & Video awards -- mediadiet.net/2007/06/si… .This is a stellar event space. Not only did it use(d) to be a $1 movie theater -- per Rob Corddry -- it has a stellar staff. Tons of good hors d'oeuvres  -- the little sandwiches were great and the beef was hella tender -- but the space is lively, as well. There are several places to move through. Upstairs, downstairs, theater, and perhaps even outside and behind.We left after the awards ceremony, and I would like to return for another event in order to see how the space changes. Organizers, take note!",4,,5

179,Lina D.,"Bayonne, NJ",29,462,0,2.0,4/23/2012,"The usher told me this used to be a movie theater, and it still has that tacky feel to it.  My biggest gripe?  THERE IS NO DOOR SEPARATING THE LOBBY FROM THE RESTROOMS, meaning every movement inside the ladies' room can be heard in the lobby.  How disgusting!  If you want a bathroom with a door, you have to go to the 2nd floor.  Also, the water fountains don't work.",,,
180,Orlando E.,"New York, NY",29,190,55,3.0,12/7/2006,"The mission was to see EVIL DEAD: The musical.Came here in person to get my tickets. The space itself is not much to look at. Nothing bad either, its just plain and useful in layout and flow. The box office agent was very corteous and helpful, as they should be. Nothing out of the ordinary here. So first experience was nice. The show i will not review. It was hilarious though, but that doesnt define the theater itself. Accomodations were simple and once more the look of the place is just simple and serviceable. Nothing out of the ordinary, neither does it try to be what it is not. The hallways are spacios to accomodate the mass of people during intermissions. The staff members were corteous and friendly. The seats were not the most comfortable ones ive sat on, so on that they could improve somewhat. Other than that, it wasnt a bad experience at al, just nothing special. I would catch a show here any time though. I have no problems with the theater itself. It just didnt wow like some other venues do.",2,,2
181,Hana Y.,"Long Island City, NY",95,79,0,5.0,2/4/2009,"This place is a trip.  Apparently, it was originally built to be a multi-plex, but the neighborhood at the time wasn't a popular movie-watching one (I don't know what that means, but that's what an old-time New Yorker told me), so it became a theater house.  They have a waiting bar which is very cozy and laid back.  The drinks are about average-priced.  And, you can actually take the drinks into the theaters if you ask, and they'll put it in a plastic cup for you.The place is like a small-scale, futuristic multi plex.  It's got some cool decor and a general feeling of a stylized set in a semi-sci-fi movie.  Just please go yourself, I really don't know how to describe it.I went to see ""The Castle"" here, and New World Stages should also be commended for hosting such a great cause.Bann is literally right next door too.  Make a night of it!",1,1,1
182,Gene K.,"Queens, NY",85,185,23,4.0,2/5/2012,"Came here over the weekend to celebrate my son's 3 year old birthday at the ""Gazillion Bubble Show"".   What an amazing show for kids!!!  New World looks like a tiny theater from the outside, but how wrong was I when we got inside and ventured downstairs.   It's a different world down there, spacious hallways leading to different theaters.   Nice coat check once you go downstairs, clean bathrooms and also an option to use the elevator if you wish to go one floor down or up.  The theater we were in was perfect for the venue.  Very modern, clean and safe and the seats were ultra comfy.",,,

184,Kristin M.,"New York, NY",152,207,3,5.0,11/11/2008,"Thanks to Yelp and the lovely Jane K for tickets to see Rock of Ages last night. I am a HUGE broadway nut (don't deny it we all have a secret love for musical theater!) so this was right up my alley!Floor seats for a great show blasting Whitesnake, Journey and Pat Benetar was the best way to spend a Monday night.Re the venue: WOW. Apparently this is an old movie theater but this place was so amazing. Traditional theaters have that great character and feel of old Broadway, but there's always room for a new type of venue with a bit of freshness. The bar at the bottom of the stairs plus the waiter service during the show made everything that much more enjoyable and made it easy to sit back, relax and scream ""Don't Stop Believin!""I picked up a flyer about other upcoming shows and am looking forward to checking more out as well.",1,1,1
185,Jo W.,"Chicago, IL",88,549,14,5.0,7/25/2008,"When I was in NYC visiting my friend, I wanted to catch a show and I happened to be in town during the Off-Broadway promotion ""20 at 20,"" which meant that you went to the box office 20 minutes before the show and got tickets for $20.  When we didn't win the Wicked lottery, we walked over to the New World Stages and got tickets to see ""My First Time,"" a great play based on the website, which is filled with stories of people's first times doing the deed.  Considering tickets for that show can go up to $60, I was quite pleased we were getting them for $20.We walked in and got in line, and the box office was quick, friendly, and efficient.  Given the number of people in line, they couldn't have handled it any better.We went downstairs to the theatre, and I was amazed at how cool this venue is.  It's very sleek and modern.  I don't think anything like it exists in Chicago, so it was a whole new experience for me.  There are several theatres in the same building, and the theatres themselves are small, but perfect for their intended purpose.We found our theatre and we had great seats just a few rows back, but there were probably only 20 rows in the place so I don't think there was a bad seat in the house.  They had a projection screen up before the show with funny sex facts, and they played music relating to sex and it just set the tone for a fun evening.  They also had us fill out cards with our own ""first time"" stories (anonymously, of course) that they collected and later read on stage.The show itself was fantastic - the actors did an outstanding job acting out the various stories, whether they made you laugh your ass off or made you shed a tear.  They worked well on stage together, the show flowed beautifully, and overall I was very pleased with my own first time - at an off broadway show.",1,,1
186,Beth W.,"WHITESTONE, NY",1,18,0,5.0,2/15/2014,Murder for two rush tickets for students were 27.  The musical was a little slow in the beginning but then became so interesting and fabulous.  The actors are talented especially the one who plays 8 different characters.  I think thay both really play the piano which is amazing.,,,
187,Megan H.,"New York, NY",152,19,0,4.0,6/24/2009,"I love the design of New World Stages and am always excited to see a show there.  Just off broadway, this space does not fit it with typical stereotypes of off broadway shows.  Seats are very comfortable and the theatres are small enough that it would be very hard to have a bad seat.  Over the past six months I've seen several things here including Love, NY (a concert of a new musical), Rooms (both a short preview for investors as well as the whole show) and the Castle.  Most of the theatres allow you to bring in drinks from the bar and the Time Out New York Lounge is definitely hipper than your average theatre bar.  This theatre does lean towards the campy or more mainstream off broadway productions.  Probably not the place to go to see experimental theatre.Unlike so many other New York theatres they don't seem to do a student rush but good discount coupons can be found on the web.",,,
188,Girish K.,"BAYSIDE, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/8/2013,MURDER FOR TWO was one of the best live shows I've even seen. The two actors do a phenomenal job and make you laugh every minute. Go to broadwaybox and pick up the discount tickets. If I could erase my memory of this show and see it again I would even pay full price to see them. You will not be disappointed.,,,

The show was great - very funny!  His eloquent yet unPC lyrics to his songs and jokes were extremely witty. He is also a guru with the piano. Be sure to check out other Broadway shows that play here as well. I believe tickets are $20-$50 for seats to this show but I got comped Orchestra seats suckers!Decor: Industrial feel as you walk in but cozy in the theater.",1,,

They have people dressed in black with neon lights in a pitch black theater so it looks like drawings are dancing and fighting! It don't know how they do manage to move about in the dark. My son especially liked the characters that looked like ""Transformers-like"" Robots and a giant dragon head. I liked the dancing and music. It was really unique show!",,,

192,Olivia D.,"Annapolis, MD",282,339,36,5.0,1/8/2010,"Brilliant concept of a space -- a spacious, clean multiplex-style underground building housing many small stages and a lounge. I feel like usually the smaller productions are relegated to middle-of-nowhere random locations where all you have is a stage and some seats. But New World Stages really builds a sense of buzz and community by bringing multiple shows together all under one roof. With a lounge. Serious, that lounge is value added right there. Plus they let you take drinks to your seats.",2,,4

194,Matt H.,"New York, NY",114,139,0,5.0,4/14/2009,"The theater itself was amazing. I thought it was going to be a small black box, and boom in was a multi-theater complex, complete with its own karaoke bar. The hallways, theaters and entrance were all modernly designed. But each stage seemed to have its own flair. The Toxic Crusader set was magnificent, barrels of toxic waste littered the surroundings, it was comfortable and the sound was perfect.Awesome place to catch a new play or musical. Definitely check out the new performances on all five stages.",,,

196,Marc A. S.,"NY, NY",24,179,1,3.0,6/7/2007,"When I think of the New World or the Dodgers, I think of baseball so color me a little disappointed when I went to the New World stages and saw no baseball.  In fact, the venue was filled with plays and musicals and shows involving a guy standing on stage and blowing bubbles for an hour an a half.  I'm also sure I'm not the only one to make the lame joke I just did. New World Stages is a fun event space that is filled with random and very bizarre shows that tend to last for a few months before vanishing into the davy jones' theater nether world.  They have a bunch of guys singing naked.  They had Evil Dead in musical form.  I saw a play where a dorky guy tried to stop the UN from being destroyed.  Broadway Idol took place here.  And, again, there is a guy blowing bubbles for an hour and a half. If you're four years old, you'll love it.NWS is a fun space, easy to get to, and with a good (and not too overpriced) concession area.  I still have no idea who books the shows there though.  They might be taking the New World idea a little too far - just because a play or event is random and ""new"" doesn't necessarily mean it'll last or is any good.",,,
