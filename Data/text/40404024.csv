0,Liz P.,"Edinboro, PA",0,79,1,5.0,9/5/2018,"My stay here was fantastic. My suite was huge. At night I could hear a pin drop. Every employee I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, maintenance - and especially the doormen) was efficient and friendly. It's less than a block away from the #1 subway, a block away from Lincoln Center, and right next to a grocery store. It's in a solid area with a ""neighborhood"" rather than a ""tourist"" vibe. I'm somewhat split two ways in writing this review... I want to give the Phillips Club credit for the outstanding experience they provide for their guests. But not many people know about this place, so I'd also like to keep it ""our little secret"". :)",,,

2,Stephen R.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,2,0,4.0,6/29/2016,"We were owners of a 2BR unit and the Phillips Club for over 10 years. The apartments are very nice, the location is perfect and the staff is incredibly friendly and diligent, always with a warm, ""Welcome back"" as you're getting out the cab on arrival.But if you become an owner and decide to sell, my only advice is DON'T DO IT THROUGH THE CLUB'S IN-HOUSE SALES AGENT. The reason is, they are useless and will collect a 6% fee for doing essentially nothing. The Club obviously keeps a list of interested purchasers, so when a unit becomes available as ours did, they just go down the list and ""connect"" buyer and seller. But after that, ALL the work is done by the lawyers for both sides. Do the math, you can buy a ton of big adds the the NYT real estate section for 6% of the sale price.When we closed our sale, all outstanding fees and maintenance charges were paid to the PC as part of the closing (along with their $18,000 grab), but we are STILL getting invoices for April charges. You would think they could at least inform their own accounting people that a unit had been sold. But, alas, no.If you sell, hire a lawyer and do it yourself.",6,,2

4,Clara H.,"Manhattan, NY",35,138,159,5.0,5/2/2011,"The Phillips club really is a great place to stay and for my husband and I, it was perfect. We had a relatively long stay here (~6 months for work) and it was an enjoyable stay because of the prime location, modern yet classic apartment style rooms, and during our visit, high quality staff. While I believe most hotels in the city can be rather un-personal and hospitality seemingly not very genuine--we felt the Phillips Club did manage to overcome some of these stereotypes. However, I recognize we were there for a long stay and while very pleasant, it was still quite a costly place. Anyway, we enjoyed the convenience of the place as we often walked up to the Upper West Side or checked out mid-town/down-town whenever we pleased. And when we didn't want to go outside, the amenities were well set up so that we could watch tv with friends in the living room, cook in a full kitchen and eat comfortably in a table for 4, and also retire into the bedroom (which I loved their sheets!). Then, there were times when we were particularly restrained to the room due to work, cold weather, illness, etc, which allowed us to make use of the staff there. A couple times we asked them for help to purchase us amenities, dinner, or things outside of the hotel--and they speedily and helpfully attended to our needs. From our experience, we had a great stay and look forward to our next visit to the city. In the meantime, hope that the place continues to keep their high attention to detail and sincere hospitality.",4,,
5,Heather R.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,1.0,3/20/2011,"I had a very bad experience at this hotel. I stayed there on one occasion that was just fine. The rooms are smartly decorated and have kitchens, which is a big plus. However on the second stay I encountered extremely rude staff. On one occasion I asked the doorman to get me a taxi ( it was during a snowstorm no less) and he pointed outside and told me I could get one myself. When I told the night manager what had happened the doorman lied that he had not said that to me and the manager questioned my honesty. I replied that as a guest of a nice hotel I had absolutely no reason to make such a complaint unless it was true. He seemed to understand that and was then apologetic. I asked to talk to the daytime manager and she made one attempt to call me and when I returned her call she was not available and never returned my return call. I decided to give the hotel another try and on that occasion the same doorman once again refused to help me and told me he did not work for me and did not have to answer to me. This time I called the executive manager and while he was polite on the phone he never followed up with me in any way. I wanted to report this doorman to the union but of course it turns out this is a non-union building, which is no surprise given the poor attitude of the employees. I also had trouble with a porter who refused to pick up my suitcase unless it was zipped to his satisfaction and when we reached my room he admonished me for not having my room key. ANd on yet another occasion  - the pull out sofa had not been made up for the evening. There were no sheets or pillows available for me to make it up myself and when I called down to ask to have it done I was admonished for not having called during normal business hours. After 30 minutes of waiting for sheets to arrive I went to the front desk and waited another 10 minutes for someone to go get sheets and hand them to me. Of course I had to make it up myself. I highly recommend this hotel if you like paying a lot of money for hostile service. In all the luxury hotels I've stayed in my life, I have never had one instance of poor attitude and at this hotel I encountered it 3 different times in the course of one stay.",25,13,1
6,Tyler A.,"Newton, MA",0,8,0,5.0,6/20/2010,"Fine Hotels are very personal, like choosing a car or clothing.  For me, TPC scores on all fronts.  Principally a home-away-from-home for 'club members, they operate as a hotel in a limited way. Awesome location in one of NYC's best neighborhoods. Subway just feet from the door, with the 1/9 that take you further uptown on the west side or to broadway or Penn Station. Service always excellent. Apartments beat hotel rooms big time, with every apartment offering up more space and a full kitchen.  Used to be a club owner when I travelled often to NYC. Very highly recommended.",4,,
