We were paying by cash so we paid straight up whenever we got drinks. The bartender was clearly not pleased when we were doing that. This tall person with slicked black hair, rectangular glasses, and with stub facial hair, was very rude. When I went to grab some budlight, he straight up said, ""I won't serve you if you don't tip me."" He was nice with the other white guests but I guess me and my Asian friends weren't very welcome and thought of as cheap. Don't ever expect me to come by and expect me to tell others about this rudeness I experienced. Other people expressed the racism of this bar so I wouldn't be surprised if they hire racist staff.This place is for the gays but just not the colored gays.",5,,

I couldn't believe my ears and my friend was crying. I lived in this city my whole life and I never encountered this type of behavior. Dennis is by far the worst, rude asshole bartender and he is gay so I don't understand why he is discriminating against his own. I'll never come back to this place. I am telling.

6,Stephanie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/3/2018,"So I have never experienced discrimination for being straight until I visited this bar. My friends and I were coming from a birthday dinner and we decided to stop and have a drink at Phoenix. It was about Five of us girls and when we got to the front door the guy looked at us and said ""are y'all serious"" I thought he was joking at first but he said this is a gay bar and you are all girls (duh) it was very rude. After we questioned his reasoning being that we were paying customers  he was like whatever go in if you want but by that time we all felt insulted and just walked away. I was in total shock and never experienced that before in my life. I wonder what would happen if a straight bar stopped a group of gay men from coming inside.....",3,1,1

Last Saturday there was an amazing drag show song about Alternative Facts. Very topical, Phoenix.3. Some good-hearted gay man told my wife I was a catch. Even if he was just saying that to be nice, the power dynamic in my marriage has drastically shifted from my wife having 100% of the power to my wife having 98.7% of the power.As an aside, I asked my new best friend if he wanted to come eat hot dogs with us (not a euphemism, we were drunk and wanted Crif Dogs), and he told me thanks, but he doesn't eat.

I have had a very long history at this bar, because it is one of the first gay bars that I visited when I moved to NYC back in 2002 (man time flies). I have so many memories (both good and bad) of Phoenix. Hell, I actually lost a tooth in this place. I wonder if anyone returned that tooth to the lost and found? I love this bar because it is so simple and laid back. This bar is a perfect place to get a few cheap beers & cocktails, catch up with an old friend, or make some new ones. I typically visit Phoenix before the party scene arrives (weeknights and weekends before 7/8pm), so the bar usually has around 10-12 people inside. For the most part, the bartenders have been pretty nice to me and the service has been nice. Phoenix is one of those places where the motto, ""Don't start none; won't be none,"" holds true. Hopefully, Phoenix Bar will stay true to its laid back roots, especially with the influx of new people that are changing the E. Village/Alphabet city vibe.",2,2,

Updated review","The Phoenix = the most welcoming bar in the city, with the most generous pours and the best staff.  It's that home-away-from home everyone needs in NYC.  For years we've been bringing our friends; ALL of them -- gay, straight, men, women, and from every ethnic group -- have felt at ease. We're grateful that the owner and the bartenders go out of their way to make this a relaxing retreat and to give back to the community. It's a dream spot to have a quiet drink or a big celebration, during Pride or any evening of the year.",,,

13,Christopher C.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",2,4,0,1.0,6/2/2018,"Never again! AVOID THIS PLACE DURING PRIDE MONTH!! Was heading to Phoenix with my boyfriend to meet up with some friends. They got there before me and I found out that the security guard and some random TROLL wouldn't let them in because they were seemingly only ""straight"" and that bar only caters to ""white gay men"". My friends were all of age, 27+ BUT were people of color. We've been coming to this place for years, since 2011. It was part of our stomping grounds in college so there's a nostalgia here for us, a safe space to just chill and hang. But after this deplorable treatment, I'll never come back here. Nor do I recommend anyone else to come here. This is NOT a place to celebrate pride month at all. Did the management change? If so, not for the better!!

The bar had a couple of other patrons besides us, but other than that, it was empty. The bartender was very much keeping to herself. I will say this: I entered sober and left very tipsy. And I am not a lightweight. I can't remember how much the drinks were, but they were ridiculously cheap--only a couple of dollars for well drinks. Honestly, the entire time we were in NYC, we did not find them this cheap again. Not only were they cheap, but they were generously poured. We ended up randomly finding this place after a late brunch, but if we're around for happy hour, I foresee a future visit for sure.",2,1,1

We got there around 11:30, my friend (white guy) bought us a round (2 tequila+sodas) and was charged $12 total. Second round was on me (person of color), same drinks and I was charged $18. My friend and I talked about this and thought it was odd so for the 3rd round we agreed that he would go to the same, and only, bartender to see if the rate would be different for any reason... it wasn't. He was once again charged $12. So... as a person of color I am accustomed to not only being discriminated against, but also having to question each situation with paranoia, desperately grasping for reasons as to why the perpetrator might have not been biased towards me, like constantly needing to believe that the prejudiced person wasn't actually prejudiced towards me, especially in 2017. I never play the race card first, in fact I often take on the burden of delving for alternative reasons to excuse questionable behavior, but what choice do I have here?

One of them had a 'women don't belong here' attitude, and was very open about his opinion. The other bartender made me cry by swearing at me. The 'f' word, ladies and gents. I'm usually pretty insensitive, but the fact that he felt it was okay made me feel so disrespected. Anyway, aside from the asshole bouncers, I had a great time. The service was quick and the bartenders were so friendly. I really hope Pheonix becomes a little more female-friendly, bouncer-wise. But if you can get past that, you're golden!",1,1,

Updated review","I was here yesterday and until I just read my previous review totally forgot I have ever been in here.I had just gotten off the train yesterday around 4:00PM and had about 2 hours to kill before my birthday dinner later yesterday evening. I was just planning to stroll through my old neighborhood but after the long bus and train ride from Jamaica to Manhattan, I really could use a restroom. I was headed someplace else and saw this place I walked in.  There was only one other customer and a bartender.  Only when I looked around, saw the gay Pride flag and the Absolut Vodka bottle with the colors of the pride flag did I realize I was in a gay bar.  I checked my most recent cop of Next Magazine and sure enough it's listed.I order a ginger ale when I get the bartender 's attention. I then proceed to the restroom.  Afterward, I was chatting with the bartender a bit. I asked him for the location of the latest next magazine and he let me know it was near the front but the newest ones would be delivered late. After I finished my ginger ale I asked him about the happy hour times and he let me know it ended at 7.8. I figured just in case my friends wanted to go out after dinner..",,,
31,Kevin S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,0,1.0,5/26/2016,"Came in on a Thursday night just to hang out with some friends. Paid the buck to play a game of pool and paid an obscene amount for drinks. Before I was even able to play the bartender (female, brown hair) kicked me off and was extremely unapologetic, and grossly aggressive, about it. Fine, I get it. If you have something going on then I understand. But there's no reason to treat a patron like a piece of shit, and have him leave your establishment feeling like an idiot, just because you had some nightly event. What could have been handled with simple words and basic explanation turned into making me feel unwelcome - when all I wanted was to have some drinks with friends and play a game of pool. First time I came here place was busy and I got shitty service, but having worked in the service industry I chalked it up to just overwhelming demand and not enough people to serve supply. But the pretentious attitude of the bartender secured the fact that I never need to spend money here again.",3,,
32,Tashana B.,"Brooklyn, NY",499,143,120,3.0,12/19/2014,"This place is decent. Not as good as the other gay bars I've been to though.My friends and I came here after doing a little bar hopping. We saw on Yelp it was a gay bar so we thought we'd come in and see what the vibe was and if it was fun with music bumping and good drinks like other gay bars I've been to. With the $ Yelp gave for cost, I was surprised when the bartender told us $12 for a basic margarita. My friend and I turned to each other, shrugged, and opted for a $6 Stella beer instead.When we got in, it looked like a typical bar. No bells and whistles, just a chill crowd with a hipster vibe. The music was not bad as they had a live DJ. It was a chill atmosphere that my friends and I did enjoy. We sat a few feet away from the bar near the pool table and threw back our beers, talked and laughed, listened to some good tunes the DJ was spinning, and looked around at the unassuming patrons. This place actually reminded me of your standard bar in Williamsburg or Park Slope Brooklyn. Very chill laid back place. Come here if you're looking for just that. It could have been just an unassuming night in general coincidentally but either way, this place is A-OK.",18,16,18

Bartender was nice, and was in a conversation with us throughout the night, and explained that Mondays weren't that busy since, well, it's a Monday. Drinks were well made, and quite cheap. It was very spacious, considering that it was empty, and they had some pinball and Pacman games in the back. I would definitely come back, but when it's more crowded. It's a little bit far from the other gay bars and clubs, especially on the LES, and the West Village.

Magic Hat is $6 on tap. The owner had put pans of hot food out  -- chicken and mushrooms, shepherd's pie, couscous. At first I was reluctant to eat from the pans in the dark, just as I hesitated to eat the Cheetos and popcorn in the baskets on each of the tables. But several Magic Hats later, those mushrooms tasted really good. There's a pool table and a jukebox, and a really cool little room off to the side with comfy love seats and dark walls adorned with murals of flames and phoenixes (phoenices?). The ladies' room wall is decorated with covers from issues of GO magazine. The bartender that night was handsome, although he probably doesn't go to my church.I've seen the place packed on the weekends, but so is everywhere else in the area. My memorable experience here was due at least in part to the occasion and the company: it was the best gay Superbowl ever! What a great game!

I wanna say those 'fun' nights were on a Friday, but I can't remember.

43,Tonya C.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,269,45,4.0,1/1/2013,"Every time I've gone to the Phoenix it has been a blast. First, I appreciate the space. It is not New York like to go anywhere where they is actually room to have your own personal space and here you can...woohoo! When you walk in the door you immediately walk smack dab into the bar. To the left side is an addition room with some booths and a couple of bar top tables- this is our favorite spot. The music is wildly good. One night we went it was old school hip hop, another night it was pop...but the good stuff. To not dance here is to be immune to having any kind of fun. The drinks are fairly priced and the bartenders (and owner) are really cool and, maybe because I was a female in a gay bar, they have a good memory for their patrons. Despite frequent visits, the only thing I haven't quite figured out about this place is the bathroom situation. There are two locations, that I know of, to use the restroom- downstairs and across from the bar. The one across from the bar is an individual bathroom with one door and one toilet. The one downstairs is a multi-use bathroom with one door and three stalls. The multi-use one though doesn't seem to have much security in the way of locking the door. Normally I would be discourage by this but I've been to gay bars where there weren't even doors so just having that is a bit of a step up. So with all that said, you never know what you're going to walk into when going to the downstairs toilet. I more than recommend this place, it's just so much fun!!",4,,

My friends and I used to love this neighborhood gay bar until we went out with a large group for my friend's birthday. Several of my friends had already gone inside, and my female friend and I (both straight women) tried to enter, we were refused entry because ""there are too many women inside."" We were told to wait until more women left before we could enter. Meanwhile, men were entering freely while we waited. Then when several women left, we asked if we could now enter. The bouncer then berated us for being annoying, pushy, and unreasonable. We explained that his practice of not allowing women to enter was discriminatory, and on top of that, we had waited as he requested until women left the bar. The bouncer began to yell aggressively at my friend and I about things completely unrelated to our entrance to the bar, such as my friend's status as an only child. He told us to leave and never come back, which after that treatment, we happily did, along with all of our friends inside. NEVER go to this discriminatory bar!!!",2,1,

Seriously, the bar broke out in unison when a Miley Cyrus song came on the speakers. She'd be really proud of her gay fans. Some of the customers should learn how to lock the bathroom door, though.

I got the money and tipped him appropriately but still! What an jerk! I work in service as well so I totally understand getting stiffed, but it was so rude and off-putting that I definitely won't be going back there.

53,Alex L.,"Astoria, NY",1,30,1,2.0,1/23/2016,"Not my cup of tea. I went here on a Friday night. This is definitely more of a place to socialize than a place to dance. The music was on the quiet side - not really loud enough to enjoy or dance to. Nor was the music particularly good. Very crowded (though most of the gay bars in New York are). The host of the Friday night party approached me a few times since I was alone, trying to introduce other guys to me, which I appreciated initially. Later on, once I had been there for a couple hours and was growing tired of the music, he asked me what was wrong - I mentioned that I wasn't really enjoying the music. He seemed very offput by the comment, rather than accepting the candid feedback. I don't think he liked me anymore after that (and I was just crushed emotionally as a result ;-) ). One positive about this bar is that it was a younger crowd. Aside from that, if you're looking for some good music to dance to, try out Hell's Kitchen. But if you do enjoy listening to awkward conversations with the chance of catching the attention of a handsome guy or two, this is the spot to be :-D",,,

We walked from quite far away, so I got to HEAR about it the WHOLE way there. He bitches more than me - which is a skill.Sadly, this was not the gay bar I thought it was. I confused it with 'The Boiler Room' accidentally (the geographic proximity means others may make this mistake, too), but since we were there I figured, what the hell? Let's go with it. It's dark, it has cheap beer, and a pool table. You know I love me a pool table. For an early Friday night, there was enough people that 1) it was hard to get to the bar and 2) no way were getting to play pool.The bathrooms are ESPECIALLY gross, which I suppose is worth pointing out.We ended up going in the off-the-beaten-path corner ""hallway"" I guess you would call it, where we could talk and drink without music blasting in our ears. That was quite a nice feature, but several horrible people would wander in and either flirt or makeout or, when we REALLY lucky, do both in the span of 3 minutes. Very classy atmosphere if you couldn't tell. Still, nice place to pop in for a drink. But I like the layout and dirty feel of The Boiler Room much, much more.",5,1,3

Dirty mop water, bleach or cheap cleaner, vomit, alcohol and sex all mixed together smell.. They kept the space nice and open and there is a side room with benches along the wall. Of course, this place is a no frills type of bar, but they did do a good job with the paint and color coordination... They have a jukebox too... but really really weird and OLD song selections.. or maybe I'm just too young to know about those songs...

Came in with a group of friends tonight, Saturday April 5th.  My friend said hello to the bartender then stepped away from the bar for a second.  The bartender called him back and told him he ordered a hoegarden, and told him he had to pay for it... My friend doesn't even like hoegarden and certainly didn't order one.  But since the bartender was aggressive my friend chose to keep the peace - he paid for a drink he didn't order and tipped the bartender.  Next time my friend goes to the bar, the bartender keeps at him about how wrong it was to order a drink and then not own up... Keep in mind the drink has been paid for and the bartender has been tipped at this point... This is just an example of the bar this has become.  It used to be a friendly place for gay men to have a drink.  Seems like new ownership has ruined it.",3,,

I would visit this place if you are not into gay scenes, you don't care how expensive your sweater vest is or whether or not your date waxes his chest.  Definitely go here if you like alternatives to the mainstream gag-me-with-a-spoon gay culture.      I went on a wednesday and it was just crowded enough to get some eye candy and have some good conversations.",1,1,3

83,Brett W.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,194,17,4.0,1/20/2009,"Phoenix has won me over in four very important areas (ranked purposefully):1. Erotic Photohunt2. Popcorn3. Music4. A great happy hourLet's break this down even further.1. Erotic Photohunt is quite possibly the best game in existence. In fact, if I could somehow afford my own home arcade version of it, I would probably never leave the house. So it's probably best that I have to go out and play. There is nothing more fun than trying to beat the highest score--and it only gets better the more drinks you have.2. I love going to Phoenix for happy hour (more on that later) because it's not too crowded and sometimes, if you're lucky, a bartender will throw in a bag of popcorn. This is perfect because if it is happy hour, chances are I haven't eaten since lunch. One time the bartender even let my friend and I take a bowl of popcorn to our Photohunt game. Delicious!3. Their jukebox is one of my favorites. It has all the classics, but remains surprisingly current and updated. I think it's always worth it to put on at least 3 of your favorite songs, and yes, sometimes it might take a long time to hear it, but I have that experience at any bar I frequent.4. And finally, the whole point of going to a bar is for the drinks (and Photohunt). Super, super cheap during happy hour. And it'll give you a great buzz for the evening.I agree with fellow reviewers that it's a great place to start the evening. It can get a little, uh, cozy to say the least. (But, to be fair, at least it's bigger than some of the other holes in Manhattan.) And yes, the bathrooms are terrifying. But really, when you've got Erotic Photohunt, how can anything be bad?",1,4,2

It's all one large mixing bowl and it all works out great.One great thing about this place aside from the diverse people are the completely unpretentious peeps. You will definitely find someone you are interested in and more than likely you will feel comfortable to approach him, even if you are the typical shy bean. Most people come with one or more friends but there are also those lone stragglers, ripe for the picking.It gets quite crowded so be prepared to do the back touch 'excuse me' and occasional beer spill on your reeboks.

The ""bouncer"" then warned me that I, a black man, should ""take a walk around the 'hood"". I'm not quite sure why (he claimed I was being an asshole even though he cursed at me when I joined the line.

If you are a supporter of any of these communities--A POC or LGBT--then you will join me in boycotting the patronage of this once open and accepting communal place.",7,,

I feel like I'm in college again. Oh, I guess I still am in college. Whatever!I've always had super-nice bartenders there. The jukebox was, like, stolen from my iPod, so I'm definitely a fan there and I can do my usual trio of Depeche Mode, Metric, and The Knife thrown in just to weird up the ambience a little. The crowd is friendly and is all over the place age- and style-wise, though the East Village influence is pleasantly inexorable. I think it tends to be younger on Wednesdays because of the beer special. The space is wide open and conducive to meeting others.

My male friend didn't really respond to him, and I explained to this stranger that my friend is straight. The bar worker then said that he wasn't letting any straight guys into the bar. After that, he looked at my female friend, and said he isn't letting any women into the bar. Then, he looked at all of us, turned to the bouncer, and said that he isn't allowing any Jews into the bar (we all are Jewish and have Jewish features).

It draws a diverse, laid back crowd, from NYU kids to locals to people who come from around the city. The jukebox is great and the bartenders are very friendly; go there a few times and within a couple days, you'll be on a first name basis with them.Like every other bar in the city, it gets pretty packed on weekends, but it never turns in the 'Gay 6 Train at rush hour' experience I find at other places. As such, it's more of a unique experience when you go on weeknights and take advantage of their amazing happy hour. Still, even when it's packed the staff keep things moving and it's not long before you have your drink.You can pretty much do anything here; meet new people, have a drink by yourself, come with a gaggle of friends, play pool, whatever. You kind of get whatever you what you want from this place, which makes it so great.",1,,

Updated review","I have tried, on more than one occassion, to make this place work - but seriously it is a nasty spot. No reflection on the clientele, its just that nothing works here - the juke box spends more time quiet than playing music, it's either freezing cold or sticking hot, the bar reeks of stale beer and the bathrooms are so foul that it's not funny.I know lots of people like it here - but for what it is worth, it is not a destination.",,1,

There's a pool table, drunken histrionics ensue time and time again. There's a good/eclectic jukebox, but this place isn't really ideal for dancing. The bartenders are friendly and attentive, the drinks are generously and gratefully potent, and there are quite a few happy hours ($2 rolling rock, $2 budweiser). For me this is either a place to start the evening or to end the evening, there's a lot of standing around (not necessarily cruisey, but definitely not posing) so I can't take too much of it for too long -- there's an adjacent room with seating but those coveted positions are rarely available unless you're willing to wait all night or be pushy.

I understand that this is a gay bar, but my bf, his uncle (who lives in the city and is gay) and I came here after having a few drinks at other bars nearby. At first, everything was fine. We were keeping to ourselves, having a few beers before heading back home, and talking to a very nice local (who seems to frequent the bar a lot), and then everything went downhill from there. I have never felt so disrespected and discriminated upon for being a woman. I stood by the bar enjoying my time, until an emo looking guy who claimed to be a bartender at this place (he seemed to be off work since he was drinking like everyone else) started insulting me. He started screaming female derogatory terms at me . I'm not going to say the exact words he used, b/c they were highly offensive and don't believe in those kinds of attacks. He wouldn't leave me alone. He told me to get out of his bar. That heterosexuals do not belong here. He said said that girls like me that come from the other parts of the city (I was visiting NY for the first time from California by the way) go to this place as a joke and to prove something. At this point, my bf stepped in, and this 'bartender' (If he is one, deserves to be fired) started insulting my bf. Suddenly, the emo 'bartender' got very upset and threw his drink at us. And guess what: the bartenders that were working that night did NOTHING. And what did the on duty bartenders do when this loser 'bartender'  threatened to smash a bottle on my bf's head? NOTHING!! Nobody did anything. We were being harassed for going to a bar and enjoying my bfs uncle's company. I cannot believe that I was attacked and hated the way I was for being a woman. I was being kicked out of this bar by this 'bartender' because of my sexuality and gender. This should never happen to anyone.  I was outnumbered by a crowd that did not seem to care about my well being. There are some big egos at this place, and to be honest, its a dump. Believe me, if I lived in NY, I would've never stepped foot in this bar.

It is the most diverse gay crowd (stylistically, racially, and in reference to age) that I've encountered in NYC4. The jukebox plays  actual songs. You will encounter no Cece Peniston industrial house remixes here. But you will find Sugababes!5. There is a different crowd each night. (Since I live in the neighborhood, I've had weeks where I've dropped by a bit more often than I'd like to admit, and each night, I've encountered entirely different groups of people)6. If you order a ginger ale and bitters, the bartender who's there on the weekend, who's really healthy looking and energetic will give it to you for free. It won't get you drunk, but people will approach you, look at your big glass of pinkish liquid, and say, ""What the fuck are you drinking?"" and this way, you meet people.7. No matter how many times you go there, the doorman will act like he's never met you before and will ask for your ID. After a while this becomes entertaining.8. You can go to either Muzzarella's or Papa D's afterward for Pizza. Or before and after. Or before, during, and after. Or you can buy pizza, return to the Phoenix, and smush your slice into a beer glass, and stand there like everyone else, as if you're drinking beer. People will also walk up and say, ""Why the fuck are you drinking a glass of pizza?"" and then you meet new people.9. After you meet someone new here, instead of saying ""Let's go back to my place,"" you can say, ""Let's take a stroll in the park"" since the park is so close by. This makes you feel a bit more comfortable, and seem a bit classy. The other person thinks, ""This guy is nice. He just wants to get to know me and take a stroll."" Once in the park, you can look at the guy under a street light and see if he's actually good-looking, and move on from there.",1,9,2

The crowd was good and totally unassuming, low key, real people, none of the west side Chelsea type suspects. The jukebox is definitely a huge draw, and even though it took about 2 hours for my selections to finally play, everyone before me had made good choices too so I enjoyed listening.

I'm hitting 45, and look in my latter 30's but if there's a bar I might want to retire beside, this is the one. It's lively, friendly, seriously well run (I saw them pitch out an annoying drunk, and generally look after the place), and there's a great selection of interesting men of all ages - mainly 30's.
