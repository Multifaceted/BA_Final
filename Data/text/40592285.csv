1,Devon L.,"Philadelphia, PA",224,49,12,4.0,10/31/2018,"A fun fun time for all!! It was crazy in here the day we went because it was a rainy nyc day.We didn't have a reservation (which I recommend everyone does) and we waited an hour and twenty minutes for a lane, which wasn't terrible considering!The nachos were unreal. I highly recommend those for the crowd. And if you want beer do the pitcher because otherwise they get you in price quick!",,,
2,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,5.0,7/5/2018,"5 star work event at Bowlmor.I'm pretty sure that corporate events are hard to perfect, but Bowlmor has gotten this down to a science.Shoe rental was seamless and our team names were preset to the screens so we were able to find our lanes quickly. This was much appreciated since we basically had the whole venue to ourselves on this day. Impressive!The food was pretty high-quality fast food. The pizza was zesty AF and kept on coming. It was pretty good - better than your expected bowling alley pizza, that's for sure. The chicken tenders were abundant as well and diner quality for sure which was pretty surpsiing. We were really impressed with the eats here. So much better than we though they would be. We definitely ate a bit too much and left stuffed.Each team was given a complimentary pitcher of beer to start and we were able to redeem our tickets later on for a pitcher of beer (1 ticket, I believe, 2 pitchers of any kind of soda (1 ticket) or a bottle of wine (2 tickets). Stay away from the wine, which is a hangover waiting to happen. The beer was pretty watered down but it wasn't terrible, so we stuck with that option for the afternoon.This isn't your typical bowling alley. The cool lights and extensive arcade games are a really nice touch. I always enjoy company events here.",3,2,3
3,Kevin G.,"New York, NY",19,97,90,5.0,11/18/2018,This was fun!  I had an extra margarita that I felt this morning. The actual lanes were kind of weird. I think the take off zone is too small or something. The balls are also a kind of generic made for all type of thing. I'm not a real bowler or a skilled bowler so none of that matter. I lost a bet gambling on basketball. The snacks were great. Again just to clarify. This place is fun.,,,
4,Cassie V.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",829,270,247,5.0,11/5/2018,"I had so much fun here yesterday. Our waitress, Daphne, was too cute and funny. She recommended drinks and food. She went above and beyond to answer our questions. I bowled my best game ever!  Can't wait to return.",2,1,1
5,Steffi J.,"Brooklyn, NY",289,172,371,4.0,4/16/2018,"Had a great time bowling here during a work outing. There are many lanes to accommodate the large parties that come out to eat and have a great time here. There's plenty of games and activities to keep kids and adults alike occupied if you have to wait for a lane and regular types of fast food is served (pizza, chips and dip, etc.). My only quip which is probably not this establishment's fault is the location. I love and hate it at the same time. It is right near the pier so the landscape is gorgeous, especially on a sunny day, but by public transportation, it is a trek to get here. All in all, would return here!",3,,
6,Osooct L.,"Central Business District, New Orleans, LA",115,24,13,5.0,8/26/2018,Love this place .... The Ambiance and the vibe. Great Drink and Menu for quick bites to eat. Passed by for a game of laser tag and bowling. Pass by whenever you're in the area.,,,
7,sebastian T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",194,51,707,5.0,6/29/2018,Took the family here for an afternoon of bowling and games. We all had a good time playing 3-4 rounds of bowling and some air hockey. The snacks were good (chicken wings and pretzels bites). Personally I think the shoe rental was a bit much but not the biggest deal...unless you go with a big party. Oh and parking garage fees are bit ridiculous but what can ya do.,,,
8,Jessica C.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",13,75,39,2.0,6/5/2018,"Came here with some classmates after school. The chairs were a little to close to the bowling lanes then normal bowling alleys. It was really hard to bowl with proper form because of this. It was also pretty pricy, one game and shoe rental cost around 19 bucks. It was probably our mistake coming in on a day without a deal. We were on lane 8 and our ball machine was having issues. When we tried to contact management to help asses the situation they ignored us twice before the technician came over to help us. I was going to put only one star, but our tech that helped us at the end was really amazing and a great guy. Gotta give an extra star, just for him.",1,,
9,Manuel C.,"New York, NY",8,5,8,4.0,9/26/2018,"Came here on my company employee Gathering and I must say most fun that I had in years. Great food for a good price, serve some amazing drinks, never bowled in the dark with neon lights before but it was amazing, laser tag was insane 15 on 15 battle 3 Rounds. I don't know how much it cost it was on company expense but definitely coming back here",,,
10,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",53,190,958,5.0,9/5/2017,"Wow! I had an AMAZING and fun time at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers! The vibe and the food will definitely have you wanting to come back! The drinks are strong: the food was good! The only thing I would do differently the next time is that I would order my burger without the onion jam; I was not a fan of it. The taste of the onion jam overpowered everything else, so I had to scrape it off with a french fry... HAHA! The basket of chicken tenders, on the other hand, was soooooooo filling and good! You cannot go wrong with it; it also brings french fries. The bowling lanes and the music had me hype! My boyfriend and I loved it! It's the perfect spot to go in large groups, small groups and even on a date... rent a lane and have some fun!",2,,

12,Sam S.,"South Plainfield, NJ",205,104,54,2.0,6/30/2018,The bowling part of the experience was great. Got our shoes and bowled. Space was a. It minimum but for nyc standards not bad. Two of us in our party 12 went to the bar for a drink each. Just as any bar we were in line and realized the other end of the bar was empty. We moved there to only be given a cold shoulder by both of the Bartenders. We waited for 25 minutes to order and no one even looked at us. The male bartender we were waiting for literally was fee and l left the bar.. shocked but calm I asked the other bartender if we could order since we had been waiting for quite a while.. she then tells me that there is multiple people in front  of me. Absolutely flabbergasted we leave the bar back to our bowling lane and on the way we found a manager and told my issue and as he was apologizing the male bartender walks over and says he didn't serve us because we were switching bartenders trying to cheat a line.. we didn't want to fight and didn't say anything but it was not acceptable.. we only to the empty section of the bar just as we have done in bars all over the world.Super upsetting experience. June 30th ... main bar around 530 pm,2,,
13,Lilian N.,"Queens, NY",392,208,390,3.0,5/30/2017,"Whatever happened to the days when bowling was a popular thing to do? Sadly, it's not the most common activity to do so I wanted to try it again with friends. We decided to check out Chelsea Piers for it. The place looks pretty cool - definitely ideal for kids because of the laser tag, the arcade and the rope climbing on top of the entrance area. However, the feel wasn't great. Service wasn't the best, the place was hot and muggy, and the balls were dirty and sticky. Worse of all, the lanes weren't waxed so you can tell the ball wouldn't roll smoothly the way you wanted them to. You'll have to adjust majorly if you're a bowler who curves the ball when you throw. I did however liked the fact that we happened to be there past 6 on a Sunday so prices were slashed. It was only $6 per person plus $6 for shoe rentals. If you're with kids, this is a great place with tons of activities but if you're just looking to bowl, you might want to try somewhere else.",5,,5
14,Wanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",310,284,810,4.0,5/31/2017,"This was one of the first stops on my #3rdAnnual25th and it was a great start! My brother, sister, and I had a drunk dance bowl party!One of my favorite things was the arcade, there is a Mario Cart driving game that brought me back to Nintendo 64. There is also a basketball hoop and I had fun playing with that as well.I am not a great bowler so the competition was really between my siblings. I put bumpers on my lane and proceeded to drink. One good thing is also discounted admission, I think it was like $6. Note that this doesn't include food or drinks!  There are lots of sticky, loud, unattended little children and pre-teens around so beware.",2,1,

One person at the front desk on a busy,snowy Saturday afternoon.... so we had to wait until she serviced everyone on the line before we got our shoes for bowling ... annoying ! The rest of the evening went well . Laser tag was super fun and bowling was awesome . The staff was exceptional who assisted with the party, very attentive and supportive with helping with the cake, setting up the players and clean up.",1,,

17,Yujin O.,"New York, NY",138,202,110,5.0,3/31/2017,"We had an amazing time here for our friend's 30th birthday. We were not expecting much just for 2.5 hours of bowling with food! The party planner- Alejandro was so amazing and accommodating!  Truly everyone had such a fun time. The music was booming and the dj was great. We were all dancing while bowling too! We had 15 people and despite the large amount of people it was very organized and nothing was delayed.They have alot of variety of food, arcade and laser tagging as well. Will definitely come back for a group party- was worth every $ !!",3,,2

Great view of the water and many bowling lanes available to avoid congestion. The drinks were strong and the food was good, especially the boneless popcorn chicken. I'll come back to this location over the Times Square one any day.",,,
19,Maggy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,1.0,1/29/2018,"I went to Bowlmor for a friends birthday. The night was fun, and we played two games of bowling and scheduled a Laser Tag game. When we entered the laser tag room to put on our vests, the staff member said ""you can leave your stuff here, its safe - I am the only one who can come in."" I put my coat on the rack, with my iPhone X in my coat pocket. After the game, I put my coat back on, and my phone was gone. I asked staff about it, even spoke to the manager, and they said nothing had happened​. While we were looking, several of my friends walked into the room where the laser tag coordinator​ ""was the only one who could get in"" and there was nobody there. I kept trying to talk to staff and they said they went in and checked, but I was not able to go in with them. The whole thing felt really sketchy.The phone was stolen, and was later turned on in the Bronx - two days later. I followed up with Bowlmor, they said nothing had turned up. They would not let me go in to check the laser tag area, but someone obviously went in while we were playing the game and took my phone. There were cameras in the room, and the management​ could have easily figured out who took the phone, but did not. All in all, I am very unhappy because I loved going to Bowlmor. My stuff was NOT SAFE, even after being told it was,  nobody did anything to help me try and find the device. I had my brand new, $1,000 phone stolen, after paying close to $800 for the whole night. What a bloody rip off.",20,1,1
20,Nadeg N.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1,3.0,9/2/2018,Me and my boyfriend had an awesome time here. It wasn't as expensive as other bowling alleys in the city either. Only issue was there was something in my food. Like plastic or a wrapper it was just a foreign object. But the manager was really understanding and comped the nachos off our bill. Over all we really enjoyed ourselves.,,,
21,Liana D.,"Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY",0,8,7,5.0,8/28/2018,Bowlmor lanes in Chelsea piers did an amazing job hosting my 10 year olds birthday party.

22,Bing R.,"New York, NY",146,515,2996,4.0,5/13/2017,"Very big, very loud, but entertaining for young at heart - kids!There is bowling, game machines, food like pizza, nachos and sliders - and of course Caesar type salad.  There is also a tight rope walking experience where you climb stairs and then walk around a rope supported by blocks of wood - but you can hold on to something.  They also have a large booth for camera shots for groups - I think.  You eat the food on stools and high tables.  The air hockey is fun!",,,

24,Df F.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,25,13,5.0,7/2/2018,"Words will not do justice to the high level of professionalism shown by the staff at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers during our son's 10th Birthday party. First off, Alex Lamina in the booking office was attentive and patient when helping me plan this thing. She had answers to all questions and constantly offered guidance navigating through all the packages.We went with The LaserTag (no bowling) package which gave you a private loft space that had tables and some arcade games. The loft space had the food and drinks, but the kids were able to run all over the downstairs arcade with the unlimited arcade option! They got cards that were active for 2 hours after the first swipe. You just could not use them on the games that won prizes (like the claw etc). They were cards to play games for the sake of playing games, not winning prizes!! How novel!The kids LOVED having access to all of that. I think it made them feel quite independent and grown up. It was hard to get them upstairs to eat, so i was going down there a lot to get them to eat before cake came. There was a LOT of food. i probably would not get so much food if i knew how little the kids would SEE the food. (Out of sight, out of mind!) i had never been there before so i did not know they would be running all over, not really seeing the food! We got 3 main items (chicken fingers, hot dogs and mac and cheese) french fries and a fruit plate. IT was unlimited and they refilled the platters if they ran out. We also ordered food for grown ups: crudités (half platter is enormous!) and the deli platter (highly recommended-GREAT SANDWICHES!). There was TOO MUCH FOOD, but we got to bring it all home! The party went on at a pretty fast pace!! Oh i wish it could've lasted longer! The cake they provide is DELICIOUS. We got chocolate frosting vanilla sponge and custard filling. (You get to pick) They can also do some custom things if you want. No ice cream cakes though. The staff did a great job presenting the cake doing the candles and everything. OH! I loved those people!! The Manager was Shari Samuel, our party coordinator was Tiffany and our server was Kayla. If you these women are working your party you are fortunate indeed!!!I didn't do the laser tag but I got to go in and watch for a bit. Its a dark and intense arena, although i have not been in many. The kids got good and sweaty. The entire party gets to go altogether, but there could be other people in the arena with you. We happened to be alone with no other people.I highly recommend this party. It is pricey but if you do less food it will be less expensive. That is my recommendation.",2,,
25,Bronson J.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/8/2018,"I had such an amazing time after the brunch on a Sunday at this location. Walking in the staff was amazing. I got the pleasure of meeting Jazmine, Jose, Erica, and Maria. They welcome me and my friends with open arms. We made our reservation and in about 30 min we were ready to go. We were placed in lane 32 and had both Maria and Devin as our servers. These two ladies made sure our cups were filled and that we were taken care of. Upon our exit we had the chance to meet with Aaron the the manager and he took great care of us as well. From beginning to end the service was no sub par it was above and beyond. I will definitely, take my business here anytime I just want to have a good time. The team here understands what customer service is about and they will give you just that. I want to thank all of you for everything and we will be back. Sincerely, A pleased guest.Bronson Johnson (Brother of Marcus)",,1,

27,Teresa A.,"Sunnyside, NY",58,31,1,1.0,1/26/2018,"The worst system to book. Went there for my birthday with friends this year before the main event and I called several times to see booking options. It transfers you to times sq location when they don't pick up and that's frustrating. So when I finally got a person on the line after trying several days she went into a long script trying to sell me on a package I told her from the beginning I did not want. More wasted time.Decided to bring my classy crew of 15 and just drink at the bar until we got a lane. Seemed okay. We were told 2 hours in the beginning. After 2 hours of pouring $$$ into drinks and arcade games we were told it would be ANOTHER TWO HOURS before we had lanes. Ridiculous. The bouncer at the door was rude and didn't even know how to proprerly put on bracelets (to drink). The bartenders were also rude and dismissive even though we were spending $$$. Carried my own beer tower over to the table and all the glasses. Never bowled. Never going there again. Told all my friends who didn't experience it as an anticdote story, and also my company party planning team because sometimes we go there for group events. Bad job guys. You lost a lot of customers that night",2,,

29,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,441,116,2.0,7/26/2017,"Be warned if you come here on a weekend!  They seem to reserve nearly all the lanes for parties, so the wait might be several hours.We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and were told that the wait was 2+ hours.  We couldn't believe it, but assumed that bowling is just *that* popular.  So we tried to do one or two other things at Chelsea Piers, and that didn't work out either.  We decided to come back here just to eat something before heading to the Highline and Chelsea Market.  As we walked through the bowling arena to get to the bar/restaurant, which is in the back of the arena, we realized that nearly every-single-lane was reserved for parties, except for about 3 lanes, out of more than 20.  So that explains the 2+ hours wait.Also, the service at the bar/restaurant was pretty much non-existent.  I couldn't tell if we order at the bar or if we are served.  Different workers said different things.  So....don't expect much in the service department.Not sure if you can reserve lanes if it's not for a party, but I recommend that you contact them in advance to find out the likelihood of getting a lane at a desired date and time.",1,,

The only issue I had is the prices of each bowling game was around $10. That is highway robbery! Laser tag was fun but there were issues with 1. Guns not properly programmed2. Shots sometime don't register 3. Team balance (uneven # of vests) 4. They allow people to join the games last minute.

At the end of the night we closed out and noticed our bill was more than anticipated, and I called it to his attention. He mentioned that he couldn't do anything about it so we decided not to tip and wrote a note as to why.

39,Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",118,247,717,3.0,1/1/2016,"This place is just alright. We've had our company Christmas party here for the past few years, I suppose because there's something to do other than drinking. Obviously they have bowling, however it doesn't seem to be the most modern equipment as the lanes frequently clog up with pins and balls. Unfortunately the call for service button on the lanes does not work, so you have to go up to the front desk to flag someone down. The scoring system does have some themes that you can use, but many of them look like they're old (crude early 2000's animation, slow to updates the score. Hopefully they will put some maintenance into their bowling system before my company's next party there. As far as food and drink, it's s bit limited. Their wine comes out of a box. The beer selection is mainly the mass produced stuff that you can get anywhere with several taps running out. And I was hard pressed to find any food that was healthy. Their catering menu seems to consist of sliders, fried chicken tenders, and spring rolls. Something healthier or fresh would have been a welcome addition. They have laser tag and a small ropes course, but I've never done either of those when I've been there. Location is also another drawback. It's a good 10-15 minute walk from the nearest subway station- and you have to cross the busy west side highway to get there. It's a neat little bowling alley, but I can't say it's the best I've ever been to. And I'm not sure i would come here outside my company's gatherings here.",3,3,1
40,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,453,363,3.0,11/14/2015,"All the stars go to the laser tag (which we played twice in one night). It was pricey as hell ($11 each for 15 minutes). We showed up around 7:30 on a friday night and didn't get to play until like 9:45 because no one else was playing and a group had reserved a block of time. I had called in advance to find out what the policy was and was told to just show up and we would be able to play. Of course, it only makes sense to play with other people, so it's all about timing. One of the workers told me that friday nights most people are out at the bar and are not thinking about laser tag, so keep that in mind for your future visit.So we basically passed the time by playing the small selection of games in the back (basketball shootout, air hockey, mario kart racing game, and a few rounds of pool *they have 2 pool tables*)Later on in the evening some groups that had been bowling decided to do laser tag and we got to play with them (18 ppl total). Then we had so much fun we did another game right after (10 people total). They take you in a room and you watch a short video, then you get your gun / choose your color and team, and then you are released to play. It really is quite fun and the time passes really quickly. You also get super duper hot, but I would highly recommend playing.I deduced starts for terrible customer service (the girl who worked at the laser table was so uncouth and unprofessional, and the girl behind the bar that took our credit card to reserve the pool sticks was also far from a ray of sunshine). Of course the waiting around part sucked so deducted starts for that as well. There should be some way to sign up online to avoid this problem.",8,4,2

That's if you're lucky enough to even get contacted back. Also, if you were enticed by the seemingly good deal that the summer games presents, don't be. You cannot reserve lanes and will be treated like a second-class citizen. They will literally kick you out if a party walks in and there are no open lanes. The front desk staff is also composed of a bunch of rude, moronic college-aged girls that have no idea what they're doing. If you have a high tolerance for idiocy and unprofessionalism, then maybe this place is for you. If not, stay far away.",2,,

I never got to play on the arcades since it was close to closing time so I can't review how that experience was. But at the time I went here (10 PM on a Saturday night) it wasn't crowded at all.

The nachos were good though once we got them. After bowling two games, we played laser tag which was an interesting experience, I just wished they would have told us where our ""bases"" were so that we could really play.

I should be able to review a business that provided me personally with a good or a service as a part of an event that it runs, even if I happened to not be involved in the planning of that event.

The tables took up most of the room. There were just two of us which might've been fine had there not been a party of 15 in the lane next to us.

I figured while the kids played some arcade games, run around a few then we could bowl a game while eating and afterwards do laser tag. So after about 2 hrs and being finished bored with the arcade games I go back to the counter to ask her how much longer for bowling. She says there are a lot of reserved parties and that there is still 11 ppl ahead of us. I was ready to go but of course the birthday girl was disappointed and wanted to wait. So we decided to eat and then do laser tag. Figured that would give us some time. So after 2 more hrs while the kids were in laser tag and after heavy convincing of us leaving after laser tag I get a text after 4 1/2 hrs that says ""get ready to bowl"" *roll eyes* . I decided to let the kids bowl because that is what she really wanted to do. Once the kiddos were finished laser tag we went to the counter at this long line and the lady behind the counter had the nerve to say we texted you almost 20 mins ago. EXCUSE ME??!!! I've been here since daylight and you got the audacity to tell me about 20 mins ago text? She must could have tell from the tone of my voice that I was PISSED. She gave us a lane number and we bowled. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because after we finished bowling being that it was now after 6pm we were given the discounted rate.

Updated review","Best bowling alley in Midtown!! Having a ball with the men! Hubby and our sonz came here to enjoy Friday night Fam time while in NYK. Great decor food and drinks very upscale bowling alley. Will definitely visit here again. Love that there are several floors arcades and pool tables. They also had a number of bowling balls in different sizes which is unlike our local Cali bowling alley. I really enjoyed the vibe here. One draw back SO PLEASE BE AWARE: This bowling alley has a DRESS CODE! STUNNED? We were! AND I still am!!! Especially coming from Cali! Are you kidding me??? Bowling is a SOCIAL SPORT!  By DRESS CODE they stated you cannot wear hats (fellas)...don't know if it applies to women...I did not have on one! You have to check your hat in at the front desk to them! Hubby had to do this. We were leaving the bowling alley and a group of customers were coming in...They told the ladies in the group they could not get in because of the shorts they wearing! Unbelievable!! Unheard of!! There was another lady who came in with a dress/skirt  that was ""shorter"" than the shorts those ladies were wearing!  I guess that did not matter! So that cannot be the reason you can't wear shorts! FOR STARTERS: PUT YOUR DRESS CODE ON YOUR WEBSITE! I did not see any mention of not wearing hats or that there was a particular dress code for this business. Yes, I still give them 5 stars for the actually bowling alley and the experience we had here while on vacay!",1,2,

Went above and beyond. I really do appreciate it when waitstaff get personable, makes all the difference in the world.

Please go on their website and read the dress code policy before going there or you will not be let in. Other then that this place is chill. Atmosphere is comfortable & their long Island Iced Tea's are strong which is always a plus because you want to pay for what you enjoy. The view is also good.

Waited 30 min in total for anyone to come to my table to give a menu or ask me what I want it, ended up leaving hungry and thirsty because nobody came. All of the waiters were standing by the soda station chilling like there was nothing to do.

67,Jonathan O.,"New York, NY",39,11,0,5.0,4/1/2017,"Bowling in Manhattan sucks nowadays. This is just my opinion, but holy crap it's gotten expensive and awful. When did bowling turn into a club night? Bouncers, tiny dresses, dumb striped shirts, and overly tanned people fighting in alleys? What?However, there are still some great places trying to make it as fun and simple as possible. Bowlmor at Chelsea Piers is one of those joints. I came here with a group of friends for my birthday last week. My buddies planned the whole thing out with the Bowlmor party planner. The prices were reasonable, and included drinks and food. When we got there, we waited at the bar for our alleys to be ready. While we waited, Alejandro told us it may be a little bit longer than planned, but that we would be able to move to the VIP alleys for no charge. Awesome!When we got to VIP (which was cool and away from the regular alleys, it was black-lit and had good music), Alejandro grabbed us and got us into a game of laser tag (which was actually completely booked up when we made our bowling reservation). SUPER FUN. I highly recommend the laser tag if you can get in. It might be the only place in Manhattan that still does it.Overall, the experience was awesome, every staff member involved was friendly, accommodating, and awesome.

So we oder food and drinks. The food was good but the drinks were lacking and the sangria was horrible.  We asked to switch out for and different drink a friend had. They switched the sangria and told me I could buy a shot or they'll add more soda, seeing how I asked for more liquor in mine soda would defeat the purpose. Continuing on we played a great game and headed over to the arcade, we left a small tip be the service was small. We had a blast in the arcade and they let us play while they cleaned up early, but they had attitude as if they were doing us a favor and wanted us to leave but there were still other people bowling. Honestly the nicest people were the front desk and the janitor.  The other staff just couldn't be bothered to extend themselves for us and we still spent a good amount, however waitress was nice enough to take a picture with us.

70,Nicole M.,"Westbury, NY",142,253,901,3.0,8/4/2015,"With a ton of fun options of activities in the Chelsea Piers area, bowling fits right in. We stopped in to put a name down a few hours early on a Saturday late afternoon, but they said they need reservations a week in advance and that we should just show up. When we came back around 4pm, we were told it'd be about a half-hour wait but it was more like an hour. They must have been waiting for a birthday party, because there appeared to be a lot of lanes open while we waited.  Luckily hanging out at the bar and at the pool table made the time go by quickly (they also have an arcade area and a climbing course if you want to keep busy that way). They text you when your bowling lane is ready, which was pretty convenient so we didn't have to keep checking in at the front desk. I liked that the lights were off and the disco lights were on, but I was a disappointed no music was playing, even it was late afternoon, I find it part of the experience. They were just showing ads on the TV screens- would have preferred music videos. I'm assuming they do this at night only. Technology worked fine for us, I found it easy to use. We ordered the sampler to snack on which was a variety of wings, cheeseburger sliders, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings- can't go wrong snacking on fried food with friends!- great for the group to share. Prices are expensive, about $10 per game and $7 for shoe rental, but I expected it since it's in a good location. I recommend looking into their special events nights, where prices are more reasonable. Overall good experience, just would have liked music playing and a shorter wait time.",6,,2

Super impressed by their Sunday evening after 6pm special shoe rentals and bowling for about $13. Any additional games are $6 each. We had a great time. HOWEVER the bowling balls are not well maintained. With the amount of revenue this place makes you would think they would have better balls. All of them had huge cracks and knicks. My husband who bowls often had a horrible time because of this. I asked for a staff member to help me find a heavier ball and he stated he would but he recently hurt his back and couldn't, so I searched and searched and found one myself and carried it back.

Still have not actually bowled here yet, but I'm working on it.The first time I came, it was on Valentines Day, so that was like a quiet Monday. This time, because it was Friday, there were bouncers at the door checking IDs, which was fine because they were friendly. Seems like they have a DJ or something on these prime weekend nights because club music was blasting, and it was a much more crowded, party-like atmosphere. We came for the Laser Tag once more; the hidden workout nobody tells you about. I think it's a great price at around $10 for 15 minutes. I don't consider myself out of shape, I go to the gym a couple times a week, but maybe I need to work on my stamina, because before the 15 minutes of zipping around in there is up, I'm gasping, wheezing and needing to rest. It's a pretty spacious arena with a bridge, little windows, lots of variety and things to hide behind. But also, I must suck at Laser Tag because I keep getting last place and my boyfriend is a master who gets first each time. Damn these roles.As for the rest of Bowlmor, it's cavernous with a lot of room. I arrived earlier than the rest of the crew and settled at the bar alone to wait for everyone else. I usually hate trying to get a bartender's attention, but one woman at the bar (and it sucks I didn't catch her name) was phenomenal. She was very attentive; got me to even start a tab, and I RARELY leave my card with the bar; I prefer paying cash because people I know have gotten their cards compromised at bars. :/ She was down-to-earth, friendly, accommodating, even made me a drink I found on Google called a ""Barbie shot."" Yes, I'm ashamed of the name but shots are hard, man and I could do this one. Also ordered some fried shrimp off the menu tossed in some delicious honey sriracha sauce. Girl took care of me.

There's a nice little arcade and suspension bridge course. If that's not enough for you, there are plenty of other options close by, like ice skating, golf range, fitness gym, etc.",,,
81,Cheuk Yin H.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",206,182,804,3.0,10/24/2015,"I usually hate bowling for several reason, my nails always break, the ball holes are dirty and makes me feel like bacteria is crawling into my fingers and it's typically dingy. However, bowlmor has got a nice upbeat feel to it. There are bowling lanes on either sides of the room, with lounge seating in the middle. For $50 you can do 3 hour bowling, shoe rentals, 3 drink tickets and some food-not a bad deal if you ask me. The staff was a bit unorganized as they could not find my reservations nor did they know where the rest of the party was-ended up walking all over the floor to track them down. They have a small arcade area by the restroom, Mario Kart, knock hockey, basketball  and a beer pong game are some of the options. For a friday night, it was not busy at all but it was a plus for me, smaller crowds is better. I'd return for a large group gathering, but not for a date night.",,,
82,Amoi H.,"Paterson, NJ",237,204,446,2.0,4/11/2015,"Bolwmor is cool but coming here is really pricey. We went here to bowl for a friend's birthday. We were first met with the thievery in the parking garage.  The Parking Rates are as follows:Up to 1 Hours - $17.00Up to 2 Hours - $22.00Up to 3 Hours - $26.00Up to 4 Hours - $39.00And it continues. After we parked, we went inside and the guy in our party was turned away because he was wearing construction boots (like Tims)... It didn't make a whole lot of sense because people inside were wearing jeans and we were in the dead of winter and you change your shoes to bowl anyway. Luckily he had an extra pair of Vans in the car because it's not like we were coming from up the street. Be aware that there is an enforced DRESS CODE.We finally made it inside and were ready to get our bowl on but had to wait for a lane to become available so we played laser tag in the meantime (which was super fun). We then we went to the bar area to get something to eat. The food prices are reasonable considering the venue. However, by the time our lane was ready, we had been there 3 hours. We could have gone for a round of bowling and I was ready to order more food but we were on the edge of being bumped into the next pricing tier for parking and paying an additional $20 per person (after splitting the extra cost for parking) to bowl was looking less attractive so we left and called it a night. It was fun but I feel like the whole experience was just overpriced.Tip to you Bowlmor: A flat rate for parking will encourage patrons to stay longer and they will, therefore, spend more money INSIDE your venue. Think about it. OAN: This is a great place for a corporate event. You can have a lot of fun when you don't have to think about the cost.",4,,
83,Tiffany S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,2,4.0,10/8/2017,I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate my bday. I came at about 5pm. I put my name on the waiting list for a lane. At 7pm they stated that it was 1 person in front of me. At 7:45 I went to the front and again they stated there was 1 other person in front of us. I explained that I've been waiting since 5pm. The person in the front said that all the lanes are booked until 10pm. I asked to speak to a manager. I spoke with Aaron the manager about the situation. After I explained the long wait to Aaron and informed him about the miscommunication with the staff at the front desk. Aaron took care of everything!!! He made sure we were able to get a lane within 30 minutes! He was absolutely awesome! Thanks to him I had a good bday!,1,,
84,Shan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,11,1,5.0,9/24/2017,"I booked a birthday party for 5 children this Saturday 9/23. I chose the 2.5 hour package and it was everything and then some. The staff was very attentive when needed and the set up was beautiful for my little boy. I wasn't expecting as much food as we received for the package, so much that they allowed us to take the remaining food home. The chocolate chip cookie cake was delicious and filled us right up. We also did laser tag and the tightrope course which was super fun. I would book a party again any day. Shout out to Justin Molina and his very professional staff!",1,,
85,David G.,"Queens, NY",23,10,0,2.0,4/16/2016,"I'd only come here for a corporate event or something similar ever again. This is NYC, everything costs more in the city obviously but this was pretty ridiculous to me still as someone who's splashed the cash many of times before. 2 games of bowling for 3 adults and 2 kids was $100. Shoe rental? An additional $50. 3 appetizers and a burger was $80.  5 margaritas (we didn't specify, so naturally they went for patron) were also $80. Then tip on it all.5 people for a game of laser tag was $50 plus about $20 in gaming credits that lasted 15 minutes while waiting. Next time I recommend a trip to Brooklyn or Queens to a real bowling alley for a fraction of the price and way more fun.",3,,
86,Tom P.,"New York, NY",4,10,2,1.0,4/16/2016,"Don't go to this place. It's run by a bunch of high school people who don't understand how to run a business. We walked in at 5:30 and were told lanes would open up at 6:00. We waited an hour until 6:30 and then when we went to check on our reservation, they said ""Oops, we have parties booked until 8:30"". So annoying. Don't go here.",2,1,
87,Robbie B.,"London, United Kingdom",75,521,225,3.0,4/25/2016,"As far as bowling goes, this venue is pretty cool. Decent set up with lights, video etc. That said, the food and drink is a rip off, only serving greasy food. Perhaps that is what is to be expected.",1,,1

Bowling is decent but the lanes and seats are really lacking in cleanliness. It's very tough to track down any staff to help you out. Food was really tasteless fried foods, and way too heavy to have with a long bowling event. The Pool tables in the back have literally no lighting making it nearly impossible to play. There are much better places in Manhattan to do bowling if you're interested.",7,,
89,Eduardo G.,"New York, NY",20,117,3,5.0,8/23/2016,Super great place to come and enjoy a game of bowling. I got the summer pass which lets you play up to three games at certain times of the day. Usually come here after work on Friday. The staff is really nice and accommodating. Alejandro works at the front desk and he's always a pleasure to talk to. This place is great for group outings if you're tired of the typical bar or pub.,,,
90,Angela N.,"Lake Forest, CA",132,19,50,1.0,1/25/2015,"My husband and I were visiting from California and love New York City. Since we've been a few times, we wanted to do something different. We saw Bowlmor at Chelsea Piers and wanted to visit and possibly bowl a few games and have some drinks after a long day. After we entered, we were immediately stimulated by all there is to offer. However, after going in we noticed the bar area and bathrooms were disgusting. For the women's bathroom to be in such shape there was no excuse. I had to hold my breath while in there to wash my hands. There were various children's parties going on which left us with a 2 hour wait to bowl (despite the fact that there were about 7 lanes open) so we decided to have a drink or two instead. We went up to the large bar and found there were only about 8 (taken) stools at the bar which could hold about 15 stools. People were allowed to just take stools from the bar and set their jackets, shopping bags, etc on them or just take them away to their booths or lanes and remain there unused while other people had to stand. There was a major lack of management or structure in every area. We just stood there at the empty bar the whole time to have a beer. If it wasn't such a bad experience we would've stayed longer but I couldn't wait to drink my beer and leave. The beer selection was decent and the prices were ok. The bartender seemed embarrassed at the lack of bar stools and she apologized, saying it's pretty normal for their stools to be taken away. We won't visit here again. All in all, it was an unpleasant experience.",4,,
91,Allison B.,"NJ, NJ",353,83,38,3.0,1/30/2016,"This place is typical of what you would expect, nothing spectacular. However, the laser Tag is a huge plus. I had a blast playing laser tag. They let you play in 15 minute intervals. You can book as many games as you want, but two games are more than enough. The laser tag is what makes this place worth going to.  The place is huge but I didn't feel like there was many options. The food here was surprisingly good. I ordered the crab artichoke dip. The dip was delicious. It came with pita chips and tortilla chips. The tortilla chips were mediocre, but the pita chips with the dip were very tasty.",3,,
92,Reem C.,"Philadelphia, PA",306,355,7,3.0,12/29/2014,"I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this place. The last time I was here was probably 7-8 years ago. One thing that did not change is the price, the ambience and the games in the ""arcade"" section, which is fairly small. It's still pretty expensive to bowl here at night. If you're very spend-conscious or frugal, I recommend coming here in the afternoon when it's a little cheaper. My wife and I went around 9:30pm and ONE game with shoe rentals for both of us was close to $40.Bowling itself is nothing out of the ordinary. There's various screen above the lanes playing music videos and other viewing options, such as ESPN. We ordered two drinks, which were close to $13 each. A bowling date night at Chelsea Piers can easily reach $100 if you plan to play more than one game and eat and/or drink.",3,1,4
93,Annabell D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,0,1.0,10/6/2017,Will never understand why a place like this has a dress code. Especially since it's one of the few places of its kind it'd be nice to dress comfy and just have fun instead of having to dress myself and the kids up to fucking bowl and shoot laser tag. And if you're going to have a strict dress code at least have a neat place. It's sticky and hot and looked less clean than some bowling alleys with no dress code. Can't wait until someone opens a place similar to this but with no dress code so I can finally have somewhere to take the kids on a Saturday night. Sigh.... the search continues.,,,

(must be some new horrible rule ‍) anyway he tells us however i am going to let you in consider it a courtesy.. so as he lets the teenagers stand to the side while he checks everyone over 21's id he is telling every teenager in our party ""dont give my security no problems"" after about the fifth time saying it i was very very annoyed because i watched him allow people come in before them and he never said one word to them about problems.( im guessing because he saw young black teenagers he automatically would assume it was a problem) anyway as we all turn to walk in the rude security guard at the door ... says to the teenagers "" and i better not catch any of you drinking or i will throw you out you hear me ?? again very aggressive just like the manager..  moving on we come inside and in order to diffuse the situation i ask for another manager many of the staff inform me the manager i spoke to was the only manager on duty.. however as my aunt comes inside (which this is her party for her son) she asks to speak to a manager and miraculously another manager pops up.... (so im not sure what game the staff was playing...) anyhow i informed my aunt of what was going on and she calmly asked to speak to the security guard... as shes speaking to him and asking his name to report him he walks up on her and becomes very aggressive with a female so much that he was in her face now the manager had to intervene. he then says no im going to throw her out again very aggressive!!! ( at this point i am not understanding and throw her out for what!!! you became aggressive with her!!!) in the end a new light skin manager told us to just go bowl (which was not the answer ) as the same security guard hovered over us all night walking back and forth looking for us to do something wrong... as a young african american woman bringing young african american teenagers here to bowl i would say that they were profiled just from walking in and they were profiled by african american men!!! because both the security guard  and manager were african americans... in the end noone would give us corporate number ( they claim they didnt know it. as well as claiming they didnt know the security guards name..) so im hoping that this article will help someone who would like to give them business i say dont !!!",1,,

I was completely ignored and when I tried to get the young ladies attention she look at me and continued ignoring me... So I finally said to her I've been standing here for five minutes trying to get your attention, I know you saw me standing there yet you still ignored me. Finally an event host came over who saw me standing there and pointed me to the right direction. Once I found my friends lane's they  had us next to some of the most unruly children that clearly had no behavior and the adult watching them was no better (not the bowling alleys fault),The kids was trying to steal our food that we ordered... So we had to tell our host. Who spoke to the mom of the kids.Once we finally got settled the manager aaron came over and apologize for the party next to us,Even gave the birthday girl a shot on the house.We had unlimited drinks for the time that we were there and the drinks was pretty decent. Our server Maria although was sweet she was extremely slow with bringing us our drinks, Everyone pretty much kept ordering the same thing so I don't know why/how she couldn't just keep the drinks flowing. It was about twenty minutes between each round.Overall we had fun bowling but the experience was soured because of the behavior and attitude of the employees....

The party of 5-6 people just ahead of me on the line was told the same. I can accept that the place was extremely busy - although it didn't appear to be and quite a number of lanes appeared to be open - my complaint is the disorganization at the front desk. Employees walking back and forth and eating in front of guests and talking and looking but not helping. Both I and the party ahead of me all scratched our heads and left disappointed. Also there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the general area of the front desk.",,2,1
99,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",477,172,201,2.0,6/1/2016,"Came here for a company event on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was empty except for my party. It's a pretty standard bowling alley, probably pretty expensive but I wouldn't know - my company expensed it.They have about 20 lanes, a bar, and a mini arcade in the back. There's also some weird ropes course suspended in the middle of the space. Not really sure what that's about but I might've tried it if it was open.Bowling is usually overpriced in Manhattan so I wouldn't come here again, unless it was for a specific event. There are many other bowling alleys in Brooklyn or Queens that offer a more affordable price. Also why trek all the way west to Chelsea Piers when there's another Bowlmor more central in Times Square?",,,

Took an unusually long time to set us up with a lane and shoes.We got through the first 6 frames, and all of a sudden, the lane goes dark. The same person who took a long time to get us going comes over to us and says ""don't worry - we're not kicking you out. There's a party starting so we need to move you to another lane."" Mind you, there were plenty of lanes open that we could have bowled on from the start without interruption, but for whatever reason, this is what they did. So the 7 of us, as well as the 4 people on the lane next to us, moved elsewhere for no good reason.This all would have been a big nothing had they simply apologized immediately or offered us something for our inconvenience, but the knucklehead from the front desk kept telling us about the party coming in...which I couldn't have cared less about. I asked for a manager, who to his credit righted the ship, but had I not asked to see him, they had basically chalked it up to an ""F You"" to us.When we were settling up, the same ditz at the desk began to overcharge us for shoes etc until we had to correct that.Isn't bowling supposed to be fun and EASY???

Our waiter was very attentive, and easy to find if we needed something.  He offered to bring us pitchers of beer right off the bat, which was a good idea.  The food was fine, nothing amazing, but not bad.  We had picked 3 things, and they had asked when we wanted it served, and they even refilled it at least once when something ran out.  Bowling was fun too!  I am awful at bowling, so I was mostly socializing in between my turns.  But it seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves.  I've never been there just for a random night of bowling, but it was definitely a fun time for our bday and I would go back!  Again they were super helpful, and made planning and everything a breeze.",2,,

117,Matthew M.,"New York, NY",1,2,0,2.0,6/28/2015,"I went during a Monday, which holds an ""all you can bowl"" from 8pm to midnight. They must not have their A team on these nights because the service was horrible. 1. Ordered a plate of fries from a waitress who waits on the bowling floor.  She brings the bill out immediately since I didn't want to keep my tab open.  This would be fine, but if I'm suppose to tip you allow some time for me to monitor your performance. This will allow me to assess a proper tip. However,  she was more concerned with me paying right at that moment so I paid and gave her a 25% tip. This was not a big deal at the time, but it did appear odd. It's not like I placed an order at a fast food restaurant,  I was waited on. 2. Once the bill was paid, she totally forgot about me. I had a feeling I was somehow going to get bad service if I paid as early as I did.  It took an hour for the plate of fries. I've asked the waitress twice, once after 30 minutes and again 45 minutes after my order was received.  The waitress appeared annoyed at me, so once I've waited 60 minutes,  I went straight to the bar to ask. Without going too in-depth with the minor details,  overall service was horrible.  The cherry on top was the manager coming out to give me a free ticket to their laser tag...gee,  thanks (and into the garbage that went).Additionally,  finding a suitable bowling ball is regulated like no other place I've seen. Once you receive your lane, there are bowling balls waiting for you. Although they're available for use, if they're not to your comfort you must go to other lanes for a proper bowling ball. Not a huge issue, but it's odd to go to a lane in use.  Typically,  bowling alleys have designated locations where you can find a bowling ball that is fitting for you, in which you don't have to bother other bowlers. If there are vacant lanes, it does become less of an issue.I bring this up because,  I went to this bowling alley as a kid and they had a great system at the time. You used to be able to provide an employee behind a desk your requested size and weight. Once the employee had that information,  he/she would grab one for you...why change such a great system?Also, this place was not busy.  Customer service is an art form for those who care about what they do.  The waitress and manager who served me came off as either uncaring or incompetent.  Either way, I will stay clear of this location.",4,,
118,Ashley B.,"Stony Brook, NY",9,79,145,2.0,7/21/2015,"After bowling there for a few times, it has come to my realization that many of the LANES ARE UNEVEN. My friends and I take the advantage of the summer package to enhance our average, but we find out that the lanes are messing us up. There are so many times we threw a straight ball, without putting spin, that we can see the ball going straight and then all of a sudden baring left/right. It has been really frustrating! We wonder if that is why they don't have leagues!! Anyone who can bowl will notice the uneven lane right away! I'm very disappointed with the lanes! If you are going there to play real games, I advise you not to waste your money. If you just wanna drink and have fun with your friends, not a bad place to go to. Just be aware of the pricey drinks.",2,,1

121,Elan B.,"New York, NY",32,2,0,1.0,3/22/2015,"Dear Bowlmor management,I went to Bowlmor last night (3.21.15) for my sister's birthday and was not permitted to enter because I had ""sweat pants"" on. Let me preface this review by explaining that they were not quite ""sweat pants"" rather well-fitting training pants with a tiny Nike swoosh on them; thats all. As a 32 year old attorney, I normally do not go out in training pants; I had dressed up to play laser tag at Bowlmor for my younger sister's 25th birthday and wanted to run around in something that allows movement. Furthermore, I was not dressed sloppily.The doorman was rather nice; he could not permit me in because his manager set the rules. He told me he would go bring the manager, but the manager refused to actually come out to speak with me.Yes, you may have guessed it from prior negative reviews of Bowlmor. This manager's name is Tim.Tim, a condescending, disrespectful guy, with a chip on his shoulder, who clearly understands very little about working in the hospitality industry, must have a lot to compensate for. With a blatant disregard for potential customers and prospective business, Tim made it clear that he did not care that it was my sister's birthday and that I was there to spend money; rather he kept repeating the dull line ""the dress code is the dress code"".As an attorney, I am quite keen to following rules. However, something was awry with their unequal application of ""dress code"". First off, there were slovenly people stumbling out of the venue wearing oversized sweatshirts and baggy torn jeans and women in leggings wearing UGG boots (which Tim apparently claimed was against the dress policy in other negative reviews about him). Next, Tim must not know the definition of sweat pants, as I was in trainers, clearly not ""sweats"". Finally, even the most conservative of judges understand the necessity of legislative interpretation. If a law is deemed ambiguous (i.e. training pants do not fall into the category of sweats), the ambiguity is held against the drafter of the law (i.e. Bowlmor).Thank you for alienating a potential customer who would have spend a lot of money at your venue. I look forward to informing all of my friends and colleagues about the disrespectful vibe at Bowlmor and dissuading everyone I know from every visiting.Best regards,Elan",19,1,
122,Caroline C.,"Malibu, CA",2,10,5,1.0,12/21/2016,Super rude and unprofessional staff. I would give zero stars if I could. I will never be back here.

Me and a few friends showed up at 11:12 and were surprised to find the door locked. When we tried to get the employees to unlock the door they wouldn't even come over to explain why they were locked and kept signaling us to leave. We finally were let in by a customer and talked to a manager. Although friendly, the manager was less than helpful. He explained they were closed at 11:15 but failed to explain why their website states 12am. Very disappointed could have easily got a round of bowling in with 1 hour left.",,,
125,Caitriona M.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",31,2,0,1.0,8/20/2016,I am absolutely disgusted at the service in this bowling arena.My husband and I decided to have a nice quiet evening out and have a fun time bowling. We went on Saturday evening the 20th August around 7pm.When we went in the place wasn't that busy which was nice and the lady Yvette behind the counter told us it was $6.99 a game which was perfect no problem I asked her twice actually just to be sure. She asked what size we were we told her and off we went to lane 3 to play. We played a total of 3 games in the space of 45-50 mins we really enjoyed it but I was getting tired so we decided to go. As we went to hand back the shoes and pay my husband handed his card over and we seen she was charging us $80!!!!!!!!!We were in shock how can it go from $6.99 to $80???The girl a different one this time said it was $6.99 EACH per game so even though WE played EACH other we were charged separately and then to top it all off we were charged $13.18 for shoe rentals!I am disgusted!!! So much for a quiet night out!I'd advise everybody to take your money and spend it elsewhere I will never be back here again and will tell anyone I know not to go here!,1,,
126,Julia Z.,"Raleigh, NC",43,250,803,4.0,10/22/2015,"I had a lot of fun at the company event here in the private room. The food catered was pizza and fajita, I had the pepper beef in soft taco wraps diy style, I'm a sucker for vinegar based sauce, so it tasted pretty good to me. I'm not sure if work brought out own alcohol or the bar provided, but the drink selection offered was premium. I throughly enjoyed the night, even though the bowing games were wiped twice due to mechanical issues. It's a good company event choice--taken I'm not paying for it and the coworkers are pretty fun to hang with.",,,
127,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,352,290,4.0,6/19/2014,"I actually liked this place because I did really well bowling here.  I've bowled at regular bowling allies, bowling places that were more nightclub than bowling alley and this place is somewhere in-between (like a lounge bowling alley).  LOLBut again, regarding how well I did, I'm not sure if it was the flashing lights in between the alleys, the ideal shaped ball for me, or the less slippery floor material, but the bowling ball was actually going where I was willing it to go which has not always been the case for me elsewhere.  Who knew I could bowl?  I think I even like bowling more after today.We had rented out the entire facility so I have no idea how much it costs to bowl here but the food was edible and drinks okay though the service was hit or miss.  Like half the employees were nice and helpful but the other half acted like they didn't want to be there.  That's unfortunate.  They also have a separate private lounge on the second floor that was nice with games playing.  It is World Cup time, after all.I actually wish this place was even a little more razzle dazzle.  It is for Chelsea Piers which I rather associate with being a way too serious athletes kindof place.  They have screens, flashing lights, music playing and a lounge-like interior, but I kinda wanted to bowl to EDM.Did I mention I bowled really well here?",,1,
128,Allison B.,"Murray Hill, Queens, NY",1,37,51,2.0,3/1/2015,"Where to start.Pros: there's a pretty nice sized bar so you can drink while you wait. Theres a lot of seating for groups to sit while waiting/drinking. The wait was only 30 minutes for 2 lanes on a packed Saturday night.The waitresses who served us our drinks were very nice and friendly. Open til 3 am. Cons: So many mechanical problems that we ended up switching to the 2 lanes next to us. The lanes were not oiled so it was hard to bowl. The place was dirty - I had to keep stepping over of puddles from spilled drinks. Not only dirty but dangerous. Super cons:The front desk. So horrible I had to make a separate category. When we arrived and they told us what our lanes were, we got our shoes already and had to wait 15 minutes for the people who previously bowled there to leave. We told the front desk at least three times that there were still people in those lanes thinking maybe they had told us the wrong lanes. Not the case. We told them and they did nothing. We had to go there ourselves to explain to the people sitting there that the lady told us these were our lanes and that we had been waiting. They were nice and left but it shouldn't be the customers job to do that. On top of that, the lady with the glasses at the front desk was so rude. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. She gave us the wrong change when we paid. I am 100% sure of this because we paid for $30.95 with a $100 dollar bill and got $69 and change back. When we paid for another bowler, $30.95 again using the $40 from that change she gave us, we were only left with $29 meaning that she didn't give us the $9 back from the $40. I'm no mathematician, but it's simple addition and subtraction. She insisted that she gave the correct change which I know for a fact she did not. I even told the manager he can check the camera and he will see shes wrong. He spoke to us quickly and gave us the $9 back fast because I think he understood what we were saying and how it didn't add up and believed she did give us the wrong change. It's not about who's right and who's wrong. It really aggravated me that she was being so rude. She could have said something like ""I might have made a mistake let me double check"" or "" I think I gave you the right change but let me check the register again"" or really anything along those lines. 1 star for the short wait time and 1 star for the friendly waitresses -3 stars for the mechanical issues, the lack of cleanliness, and the front deskP.s. Saturday night price for 2 games and shoe rental was $30.95 in case you were wondering about pricing. It's $6 and change for shoe rental and about $12 per game.",6,1,1
129,Jana W.,"San Diego, CA",35,29,37,2.0,7/13/2015,"Can you get more overpriced?? Seriously. I've been here a couple of times. Once for bowling (paid for by my job), and most recently to play laser tag for my birthday. The facilities are nice. Really nice. But not THAT nice! Laser tag was over $10 per person per game. A game is only 15 minutes long. It was a lot of fun, but not worth almost 70 cents a minute.The guy running laser tag could not have seemed more miserable to be there. We waited at an empty desk for almost 5 minutes just for him to show up and act completely inconvenienced at our presence.The game itself was fun. There were 8 in our group, and no other walk-ins so we played 4 on 4. The goal is to ""destroy"" the other team's base as many times as possible. I'm not entirely sure the sensors that you shoot at the bases were working all that great, but the vests and the guns were in good condition. The obstacles weren't fancy, but they were fun and adequate. There was definitely room for a slightly bigger group of people to play comfortably. I don't know how may people they allow at a time, but the space isn't huge, so I could see it getting crowded pretty easily. Overall, it was a good time playing though.The bar area is nice, and the bartenders have been friendly in my experience. The food is...decent. But again, ridiculously overpriced! And the drinks are WEAK. In fact, after laser tag we were going to get a drink at the bar (we'd gotten one before our game), then go play one more game (we were there anyway, and it was fun in spite of the price), but we decided it wasn't worth it to pay out the nose for another weak drink there, so we were going to go to another bar in the area and come back for laser tag. Needless to say, we left and didn't bother coming back.Bowlmor would be a really cool place to chill with friends, but it costs way too much to be worth it. Unfortunately, there's almost no laser tag in the city, so if that's what you've got your heart set on, you have to choose between here and Queens. Bowling is expensive all over the city. I'd recommend trying one of the places in Brooklyn over the ones in Manhattan though, given the pricing on everything.If you end up at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers, expect to spend a lot of money in proportion to what you actually get, but you'll probably have fun at least.",1,,
130,Jessica H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",205,384,1,3.0,1/12/2015,"My friends and I headed to Bowlmor for some drinks and bowling while barhopping in the city.  The place was packed on a Saturday evening with children's birthday parties as well as groups of adults.We were able to situate ourselves at a small table by the bar.  We wanted to bowl, but the wait was almost 2 hours.  We decided to just play pool and order some food since we'd already trekked all the way over there.  I ordered the loaded fries and chicken tenders.  The fries were okay but the chicken tenders, for $9, were a skimpy portion and tasted weird.  My friend's nachos were very tasty- I should've ordered those.Overall, a fun concept, but I think you definitely need reservations if you want to be able to actually bowl.",10,1,

134,Jiayu Z.,"New York, NY",248,30,59,2.0,3/1/2015,"Came here for the first time and it was definitely something different. Initially they told us that the wait would be 2-3 hours but later updated us that it would be 30-40 mins which was great. This place does get super packed so I would definitely suggest to make reservations ahead of time.What I liked about this place is that it had a comfortable amount of space, couches and a table for each lane. The waitresses were on point. Super nice and made sure we had everything we need.However, the quality of this place is poor. We ran into multiple technical issues during our games and sometimes even had to start all over cause the screen froze or the machine didn't take out the pins. The lanes were not smooth and seemed cheap. I guess they don't really have much time to clean and oil up the lanes due to high incoming traffic and long waits.Later that night when we were paying for our games and rentals, the female front desk cashier was rude and doesn't know how to count. She was supposed to give me back $9.05 but instead she only gave me back $0.05 cents...I told her she did not give me back $9 and she did not believe she was wrong. She was acting arrogant and arguing with us.I told her to check the cameras and she was just nasty and did not believe she was wrong. If you are wrong, and if a customer is complaining about an issue, you try to understand the situation and try to fix it. You don't give attitude and throw the situation to your manager.

My man & I celebrated our daughters 6th birthday here & I must say I was pleasantly surprised. There's so much for kids to do. Laser tag, arcade, bowling & more. The buffet setup was perfect. We ordered unlimited cheese burger sliders, pizza, chicken tenders & french fries. We also had unlimited juice & soda. Our guest listed consisted of 20 ppl & there was entirely too much food so I would beware on the unlimited food if you're a person that doesn't like to see food wasted. The music was great & most importantly the staff went above & beyond to make sure everything was the way I wanted it. I just have one complaint Bowlmor! I don't think it's a good idea to allow drunk belligerent ppl in to play laser tag with a bunch of kids. There were about 3ppl that obviously had way too much to drink & were being very loud & obnoxious which resulted in words being exchanged amongst other laser tag players but when you have a bunch of workers talking about sew-ins (weaves) & what their going to do tomorrow it's no wonder why they didn't notice the drunks being allowed in.....",2,,

Overall the facilities are nice with bar and super clean areas. The music is good and its fun. The atmosphere def are great if u want a fun bday idea or meet up with coworkers. The pizza ran about $18 each for standard pizza that atleast came out super hot, and then we got some sampler plates. The food random would be verryyy spicy without any warning...like onions were good, but chicken next to it would be crazyyy spicy, then ribs were normal.For booking ahead of hand they gave us 2 free hrs of bowling for 10 people.

Anyway, the girl behind the desk said that the wait would be an hour and a half to two hours.  She said that when I was called, I would have to go to the back of the line and wait.  That makes no sense! Wait on a twenty minute line after I'm called so that they think I didn't show up when they called? Huh? You would think that Chelsea Piers would have a system in place; it's 2015!So the front desk called my phone three hours later at almost 12am--when I was home sleeping!I actually waited there almost up until hour two.  There was nothing to do while you were waiting if you didin't want to drink alcohol.  Only one PacMan game in the arcade? Really? That PacMan game was fun though.When there was nothing else to do and I decided just to wait around the front desk, there was a grotesque smell emanating from the heating system.  The smell was also around outside the building. Someone suggested that a dead animal might have been trapped in their heating system.It's faster and cheaper to travel from Manhattan to a  bowling alley in Queens or Brooklyn and back than it is to wait at Chelsea Piers.",2,1,
139,Gina D.,"Lambertville, NJ",150,116,96,3.0,1/15/2015,This was one stop of many for my group of friends on a Saturday night. Unfortunately we were unable to bowl due to a very long wait (we waited two hours to get on a lane to no avail). Instead we just ordered some food and beer and the men played a couple of games of pool.  We shared a couple of $25 pitchers between us and some of us ordered food. The nachos were the favorite of the group. They came with an avocado cream on top that everyone seemed to enjoy. My friend had the grilled cheese which wasn't exactly a home run. It came with a Dijon mustard on it which have the sandwich a strange taste. The bar was busy but my friend did notice the bartender try to charge her a couple of dollars more for a pitcher of blue moon when she ordered a pitcher of coors light. Hopefully this was just an isolated mistake and not something they try to pull on everyone. Overall it was a good atmosphere and a fun place to kill a few hours. I would just recommend making a reservation to bowl and coming with a full stomach as the food was nothing to rave about.,2,,

We opted for the latter, and had a great time! The equipment was new, the area had a large number of obstacles to hide behind, and the timing at 15 minutes was just right.After laser tag we headed to the private lanes where we had plenty of room for our group to spread out on nice furniture.

144,Iz P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,4/2/2017,"Today was my third visit to the Lasertag game at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers. And the last one, to be sure! To be fair, the first two visits went as planned, no complaint. But today was just lousy and met with such carelessness! During the first of the two games we bought, many of us had to complain about our jacket not working properly, up to a point a friend had to change it mid-game. There were many of us, mostly on one team, so the guy asked some of us to change team, we did, coming to a 50/50 proportion, but as soon as the game started, it appeared that we were all on the same team except for two. We complained about it before we started the following game, and the guy said 'OK, I'll come with you and make sure everything works'. Didn't see any of him. This time, my jacket wasn't working so I had to change it mid-game too. A friend had his jacket and gun of different color, so we were never sure which team he was on. At the end, I went to talk to the guy who had dealt with us, only to find out that he had already checked out. How convenient! So I talked to the lady who replaced him, and she couldn't care less. She kept repeating 'I don't know, I don't know' and that during the first game we were not supposed to be on different teams, which is a plain lie. She didn't bother to hide her irritation. It took another guy to deal with us, he reluctantly gave us a free game, which was full, and of course the jackets weren't all working, so we asked him to deal with it before starting the game and he was like 'You're wasting everyone's time, I'll deal with it after the game has started'. Of course he didn't do much, and my friend's jacket wasn't working, and two of my friends had the same name on the screen so no idea what their score was. Terrible experience! I really encourage people who want to play a Lasertag game to find another place to do so. On top of the game not working - it happens, that's ok -, we were faced with very unpleasant, careless, rude people, which is something that I cannot tolerate.",,,

148,Megan V.,"New York, NY",97,3,2,4.0,2/25/2017,"Everything could have been perfect but my only DISAPPOINTMENT was the Laser Tag addition to their arcade area. It's COMPLETELY UNORGANIZED, the staff seems to have no clue on what is going on or how to guide their sessions. There was no introduction, How-to set up your vest, or worst know if your gun is even charged. There is no given tickets or wristbands for individuals just one receipt that just shows the total amount and what location your receipt came from. There is no head count to see if the session is over pack heck, there's no telling who's who and if anyone even paid for the session. There is first one large room where you wait before going into the next where you get your vest which is attached to your gun. Both rooms are extremely hot, there is no type of ventilation and the only way to get some sort of cool air was to keep opening the door. While in these two rooms there is NO EMPLOYEE to guide what is happening. When finally reaching the second room there were not enough vest for about 60% of the guest. This had caused a huge frustration and i guess once the employees realized the session hadn't begun; they finally came to check in on our group. There was only one employee and she kept insisting to go into the laser tag room and put on our vest. Didn't matter who wasn't playing at all. My niece who is 7 was the only one with a vest out of 5 of us and the employee had tried to insist on her going in alone! Finally after 5-7 complaining to the only employee, who wasn't even doing a good job, a manager of some sort comes to ""help"". I've literally never met such a ""Yes Man"" manager in my life, whoever gave him his job *slow motion clap*, horrible. He had no opinions, no solutions, all he can do was agree with all my complaints, and his only solution was to either A) receive a refund or B) wait till the next session. Not only did he request to wait for the next session but to wait outside on line. A line that has more than 20+ guest who are also waiting to do the exact same thing we came for. My group was not buying it, NO ONE wanted a refund and WE DID NOT LEAVE THE ROOM! Everyone waited, we ended up finding out last minute it was a 15 minute session. The session was cool, it wasn't bad, everyone literally bonded from the horrible waiting game and hospitality experience and made the best of our session. The food, drinks, bowling, arcade is wonderful! The laser tag honestly was not good at all, will probably NEVER do that there but will honestly come back for everything else. This place is extremely clean, the waiters come as quick as they can because they serve such a large area. I suggest planning a bowling party/event because waiting could take some hours depending the day and time. Kid friendly and awesome for an adult night out as well! 4/5 will have to do, the laser tag literally could have took 2 stars away if the session wasn't good. But luckily my group had a awesome time shooting each other in the dark, lol.",,,

We got the lemon grilled wings, the mango habanero wings, fries and drinks while we waited for a lane to bowl and the food was amazing. The bartender seemed new and didn't make my drink correctly but as soon as I started bowling I forgot about that, plus whatever she made was good either way. This place is pricey for a bowling alley but it's fun so I recommend it. Good date option!",,,

At the door I was told that I had to leave my hat on a table with the bouncer. He gave me a hat check. I gave him a bs line that I wear my fedora all the time for religious reasons. He called me on it and like a pussy I surrendered my hat. My hat is ME! Okay, I can get by without it and thankfully the place was sweltering so my bald head didn't get a chill. When I left a guy was just being id 'd at the door. He had his dreds up on top of his head under a stocking hat. The bouncer said, ""sorry you have to check your hat here."" He said he's rasta and he's wearing his hat for religious purposes. I've seen plenty of pics and vids of Bob Marley without a hat! I know you're wondering, if he wore it into Bowlmor. Of course he did. I just love the double standard. I don't know who the bigger pussy is, me or the bouncers. I know a bowling alley is such a classy establishment that hats of all kinds should be verboten. HAY BOWLMOR! IT'S 2015 - LOSE THE NO HAT POLICY. I will never go back to Bowlmor.

Which he clearly did not understand because he brought me spicy nachos. On the other hand my partner ordered a salad. The salad made up for everything because the avocado was too yummy. They cut it in such a shape that it seemed as if it was cheese and instead of curtons  they made a homemade bread which was ten times better. Loved the salad! Hated the nachos!",,,

155,Erin H.,"Astoria, NY",1,12,0,2.0,1/19/2016,"***I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO BOWLING***Went on a Sunday night for the 6$ deals to spend a couple's date night. (NOTE: 6$ is PER PERSON PER GAME!)It was a night before a holiday so it was much more crowded than expected. We hadn't made a reservation or anything since the site didn't tell to how crowded it could be.We waited about an hour 15 minutes (had a drink at the bar) trying to avoid the arcade and pool and laser-tag to save money. When we arrived there were lanes open which leads me to believe the in-between lane time isn't a quick turn-around- leaving people and families to kill time doing other things in the area. The bowling experience was good once it was started, the music and videos was a great touch. However the group before us had more than one lane and stayed seated in our lane because they didn't have enough room, making it awkward for us to play and enjoy ourselves climbing over strangers. The waitress never came to our lane, instead going to the larger group that took over multiple seating. When a couple left beside us, and another group arrived she immediately asked their drinks while we had to keep going to the bar (get a pitcher and save yourself the time)Bar service was pretty good but the waitresses seemed more concerned with the private party and who they knew at the bar than all the guests waiting. Overall I expected a lot more cleanliness, attention and over-all service. I would have really enjoyed having the space for just myself and my boyfriend and having service to our lane-instead of us spending most the night separate (either couldn't sit together or one was at the bar while the other bowled)",1,,

The course is super cool and 15 min. felt like a long time in a good way. Even though you are not allowed to run, I was sweating by the end. I would have loved to had one more round, but it was booked up. After we ordered food and drinks and even though I don't typically eat bar food, it was really delicious and well prepared.

160,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4999,1699,3185,3.0,1/12/2012,"So be prepared to spend some cash to get your bowl on.  It is $11/pp per game to play one game plus your shoe rental which is about $6.  Drinks are expensive.  I didn't try the food as I came fully fed (see Westville review).  With that, this place is cool.  It's huge and has a lounge like atmosphere playing some great 90's and more recent R&B (loved me some Brandy's 'Sittin' Up in My Room').  Service was ok.  The girl meant well but, clearly the corporate rules were definitely not the most efficient in practice.  We signed up for one game.  We wanted to play another.  We wanted to give them more money.  What did we have to do? Wait in line again.... for about 15 minutes since the line got super long.  Which is just silly.  So, we got there at like 830 PM and at 9 PM on Tuesday's there is a promotion- $28/all you can bowl.  No one told me that, and therefore I paid full price.  I left 300 at about 10 PM.  If I knew about this promotion I clearly would have bowled until I could bowl no more and continued my shot of Jack and a beer drink order that was way more than a $11.  Homegirl in the front should have given me the low down. * I also should have freakin' looked this place up on Yelp and would have seen the promotion myself but, I was so focused on dinner that I didn't bother looking up the bowling alley.One more thing and my last gripe with 300.  If I""m paying $11/game the least the staff could do is make sure every lane has balls.  I was searching the place, and having to bother people asking for their balls since our lane had a choice of a 6 lb and a 12 lb ball.   300, if you are going for upscale, you gotta nail some of the smaller details.  Overall, 300 is bowling a spare not quite a strike.   (Get it??

If you want a snack get the guacamole hummus really smooth but ask if you can get the bread grilled instead of fried but great anyway. They have an obstacle course right above you upon entering.

People are eating food, bowling balls, eating food, etc. I went through half a bottle of hand sanitizer! Also, the service isn't very attentive. Had to flag servers down to refill pitchers, food trays, drinks a few times. I'd say come here to bowl with friends but skip the group party/event.

Just know if you come here to bowl, you will be spending a good amount of money. Key word: SPENDING. Not wasting. If you can find some sort of a discount, then go for it! Summer time it can be a bit crowded, so reservations may come in handy. All in all, coming here is great.

174,Avid E.,"Long Beach, CA",209,233,393,1.0,2/19/2015,"For when you want to wait 2.5 hours to still be 6th in line to get a lane. The system here for getting a lane is the worst I've ever seen. Instead of being realistic and telling you that you're probably not going to bowl that night, they make you wait in that purgatory they call their bar.The whole time we waited, there were 7 open lanes. The staff claimed they were reserved. Really? What kind of reservation policy is this? Keep the lanes open the whole night until the party shows? Ridiculous! After some prodding it seemed that the reservations weren't until 9 and 9:30 and we got there before 6:30! Why would they block the lanes off so early? They should come up with a lane reservation system for normal size parties and a policy that you need to be there within 15 minutes of the start of the reservation to keep it. Parties need to reserve specific time blocks and they should charge by the hour. The large party reservations should be by deposits and maybe have a 30 minute window to show up by. That would have prevented the horrible customer experience we had. We had to bother associates a number of times and finally went to a manager after nothing happened and she got us a lane right away. The manager allowed us to play one game but told us we had to be off by 9:30. See why a reservation system and charge by hour thing would make sense here? While I absolutely appreciate the manager accommodating us, it is a complete failure of her management that they have set up the process of getting a lane the way that they did. And for $19.05 for one game, I would expect much more in the way of customer experience and service. I will never ever come back here until they institute a realistic reservation policy that does not leave people waiting forever for a lane they'll probably never get to bowl on. Additionally the lanes and machines need some maintenance and TLC. My personal ball got chipped on its first throw down the lane. The balls took a good while to come up after being thrown down the lane. Also why so many balls on the return? It causes the balls to get stuck. They should invest in ball racks running along the lanes like a normal bowling alley! I feel like the focus at this place is so far from bowling. It's an entertainment destination with a lot of bowling lanes instead of a bowling alley with other entertainment options.",10,1,1

I don't but I do roll with Groupon.The Groupon deal made it worth bowling at 300 but not enough to bring me back. I just find it ridiculously expensive and so out of the way in regards to public transportation. Parking costs an arm and a leg. If only 300 validated.I met up with an old friend to bowl. We checked in at the front and the lady told us we could go ahead and get our shoes. There was no one at the counter and the lockers behind looked like public lockers so we took it upon ourselves to get our shoes. After all, the lady did say we could. We were later interrupted by an employee who told us we were not allowed to be back there. Confused, we went back up front and waited awhile for our bowling balls. They are slow at 300. There wasn't even a line.300 placed us in a lane next to a family. We kind of wished we got our own lane since there were 4 empty lanes next to us, but whatever. The balls were in good shape, the lanes were very slippery, and I bowled a decent game (over a hundred). I found my shoes to be very tight even though they were my size. Much like the bowling alley, they also had that brand new look. 300 New York has a really nice ambiance. The video screens are state of the art and the music they play is very current. There are strobe lights and parties all around. I suppose it is a good place to host an event. It is impeccably clean.We decided to stay for dinner and ordered a plate of nachos and the trio of fries. The food was really good - total Super Bowl type - in other words, a jazzed up fat fest.Thank you Groupon for allowing me to bowl at Chelsea Piers. It was my first time visiting the complex.

When confronted on the issue on why my lane were given away another girl tells the associate I was dealing with ""oh well she just has to wait"" excuse me? Was I not standing there. Kept my cool and walked away because for someone to talk to me like that it looked for an equal response. When we finally got our lanes as requested, we were ready to order our drinks or food and we  approach the bar (let me advise you the bartenders are amazing... Friendly) but they suggested that we stay in our Area and a waiter will come and take our order... No one ever came..... Attttt allllllll. We ended up going from the lanes to the bar for everything we needed... Pretty annoying when its your turn and youre at the bar ordering, we Even removed our dishes. Let me mind you this is a Sunday night not a Saturday night not Friday it was not that many people there to receive such horrible customer service. And with my party of course I brought a cake for my lovely boyfriend's birthday when asked for a knife to cut the cake--- they looked at me like i had 3 heads. When they finally got a waitress over to me she's advise me that there's a $25 cutting charge for a cake. The cake didn't even cost me $25 why would I pay $25 for you to cut it into little pieces?  She just walked away. All I know is that anyone that was working April 26, 2015 at this bowlmar needs to be retrained every single staff member! I will give this location two stars only because thank God the location makes up for the staff! Pricing is not bad but service.... I would be making some business decisions. Ill think about if im coming back. Everyone had a puss face, not welcoming and not a comforting experience.",1,1,
184,Y N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,1,1.0,1/30/2016,"TERRIBLE!!!! I was trying to book a laser tag birthday party for my son. You can not book online for their laser tag packages so I had to call. After being transferred a thousand times, and being hung up on ""by accident"" and emails with large gaps of time in between, you can get the picture about their customer service right there, I was finally connected to a young lady who informed me that laser tag would be $50.00 per child for 2 hours. I thought the price was good for a place located in Manhattan. Then she went on saying it was an hour and a half in the birthday area where they sing happy birthday and the kids play in the arcade, I imagine with a B.S. $5 game card that comes with the birthday package and only 30 minutes in the actual laser tag arena! For $50 per child at least give me an hour! So basically they're charging me $500 not including taxes and an ""event fee"" for my kids to just hang out in their space. NOPE! I will be going to Indoor extreme sports instead for my laser tag party.",4,,
185,John G.,"Bedford Hills, NY",9,3,8,1.0,2/1/2015,"I Went to celebrate my friend's bday thinking it was going to be fun, but it wasnt. Everything is OLD! I love to play pool and their pool tables are horrible, broken cue sticks, dirty balls. And if you are thinking abt ordering a drink, order a beer to be safe, the bartenders have no knowledge on mixed drinks. Bowling was the better part of the night!",3,,
186,Madalena G.,"Bronx, NY",122,166,25,4.0,2/4/2014,This bowling alley is pretty cool although the entrance is a bit awkward..definitely a car entrance lol so watch your back when your entering and exiting. When you first arrive they check your ID and give you a bracelet so that they know your legal to drink since kids do come to bowl as well. The cool thing is if no lanes are open they take your number down and you can go sit at the bar and have a drink or play at the little arcade that's in the back by the bathrooms. The only thing about the bar is that it's kind of awkward because you have to fight to get the bartenders attention especially if there is a crowd of people. When you do go to your lane you get waited on which is great. I tried Pinny's Punch and the Dunk Tank. They are both kinda sweet but not too bad. I didn't try any food so no comments about that. The price can get up there so keep track of how many games your playing.,,,
187,Canny F.,"Knoxville, TN",666,1589,7123,3.0,8/17/2011,"The service is not that great and the lanes are okay. This is more for hanging out then it is for bowling. They even have an arcade gaming area in the back. The scenery is pretty and their food is kind of pricey but their sweet potato chips and onion rings are pretty good. I only come here when they have good deals, otherwise I wouldn't come.",1,,
188,Lucy S.,"Charlotte, NC",11,83,145,1.0,12/27/2014,"1. The cleanliness of the center--aside from the bowling lanes, the cleanliness was pretty dismal. The tables that we were assigned to were sticky and clearly not cleaned before my group arrived, the floor was overtly sticky and my group was given too little utensils and napkins.2. Friendly and efficient staff--we were assigned to a waitress who barely came to our table. The water pitcher we were given was only filled once during my two hour event and she barely came back to check in on us. 3. Food and beverage quality--the food was greasy, tasteless and overpriced. 4. Planning process--I spoke with several people to book my lane. Firstly, I was given the wrong pricing for the package deals by Michelle Diez and this salesperson named Sabrina. They told me that the teen package plan was $38.95 per person at BOTH locations (Times Square and Chelsea). When I decided to book with them, my invoice said that the package was $40.95 per person and that there was a $50.00 ""event fee"" that was tacked onto my bill that I was never notified of. In reaction to this, I then called the two associates that had given me information and inquired about the extra costs. The sales associate, after I told them about the increased package costs told me that the package costs $40.95 per person at the Times Square location, and didn't even apologize after admitting that she had given the incorrect price. Then, when I asked about the event fee, they prompted me that it ""isn't gratuity"" but because of it, I wouldn't have to pay tip or gratuity and that the event fee would go to the employees to ensure that they are getting a 'more equitable and higher salary.' However, when I looked over my invoice for the second time, it said in fine print that the ""event fee is not gratuity and would not be distributed to the employees."" Since these facts were relayed to me so last minute, I didn't have a choice and booked a lane reservation instead, because it didn't come with the phony/mysterious ""event fee."" Overall, I was utterly disappointed and aggravated by my planning experience with Bowlmor. For this reason and for many other reasons, I doubt I will ever hold another event at Bowlmor ever again.",3,,
189,Michael G.,"Park City, UT",0,2,0,1.0,7/31/2016,"Awful customer service; I tried to reserve a lame on their website and go a confirmation email that said that they'll contact me soon. Well after 3 hours I decided to call in to find out that all the phones lead straight to voicemail. After 2 hours of trying I finally got to speak to a guy at the front desk who said that my reservation wasn't in the system. He then forwarded me to their ""sales department"" which instantly put me on voicemail. After that no one picked up the phone again. I have no idea wether we'll get in to the bowling or not, but it would be nice if the company spent less money on a fancy website and more on call center",,,
190,Jeanne S.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,20,0,3.0,3/5/2016,"I an only speak to the food on a Sunday around noon when the place was just getting going, and the general vibe and the ropes course.  The ropes course is cool, perfect for someone like my 10 year old son, a bit pricey but hey it's Chelsea Piers.  The food was really good but overpriced - also not a surprise.  What I disliked about the place was the disorganization, it's a bit of a free for-all and just finding out if we could sit at a booth and getting the attention of any wait-staff was almost impossible (probably because it's understaffed at that point in the day, but still), and we haven't been back there for food.  And the NOISE level - at noon, on a Sunday - was almost deafening, so I can only imagine what it would be like at full capacity, like a nightclub with bowling.  I couldn't hear my child sitting right across from me, it was a non-starter to have a conversation in the small eating area.  The noise level alone made me not want to come there for bowling in any relaxed way.  But the food is good, and it's good they have this facility complementing the other offerings at Chelsea Piers.",1,,
191,Barry N.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,17,0,3.0,4/25/2015,"My league bowls at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers. Very busy here. The wait staff is nice. The place is often packed with kids on Sunday, but that just means they're good at catering families. The lanes feel a little tight, but they're workable. It's also very dark. A little light might be nice.",,,1
192,Nicholas H.,"New York, NY",18,9,0,3.0,1/13/2013,"I remember going here as a kid for countless number of birthday parties.  Two years ago, I returned with some of my buddies on a Tuesday night.  They have this special for $28, all you can bowl from 9 PM - 2 AM, shoes included.  For a Manhattan bowling alley, that's not too shabby, especially for someone who loves to bowl more than just a couple of games.  In addition, they have these free passes to Tuesday night bowling that they give out whenever you hit a strike with the colored pin as the center pin or whenever they feel like giving them out (messed up your order, ordered a lot of food and drinks, etc.), but those will be expiring sometime in February (probably due to the problems that occurred with Hurricane Sandy).  The last few times I've gone here, I've bowled for free.Sometime between my childhood and two years ago, they renovated the place.  They added a full bar, and turned the place into more of a night, club style bowling alley.  The place is very aesthetically pleasing to say the least.  There's always music playing and huge televisions airing any important sports games.The food and drink service isn't the greatest.  Sometimes they take forever to come or simply forget your order.  However, I come for the bowling, so that doesn't bother me too much.As far the lanes, they sometimes have mechanical problems just like any other bowling alley, but they are usually good in fixing it.In conclusion, I would only go here on special nights.  Manhattan bowling alleys are simply too pricey for my wallet otherwise.  When I do go on Tuesday nights though, I always have a great time bowling close to 10 games with my friends.",2,,1
193,Kristina A.,"New York, NY",0,16,1,5.0,6/17/2013,"Fantastic place for corporate events! My boss wanted our office to go bowling for a team building event. I called about four different places but chose 300 New York due to the location, price, and appearance of the facility.When we arrived an event manager introduced himself and told us how everything works. We had our pre-ordered food set up behind our lanes, and our own drinks server. Everything went very well and they even managed to arrange a third lane upon request. I'm a pretty experienced event planner but would highly recommend booking an event at 300 New York even if you have no event booking experience. They really take great care of your group and ensure everything runs smoothly.",1,,
194,Joseph R.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,46,17,3.0,2/21/2013,"there's a few ""fancy"" bowling alleys in NYC. This one was one of the first i knew about. i'll break up the review in sections:Bowling: Rental Shoes are ok, nothing special is expected here except clean and not old. not a lot of variety in the finger holes on the house balls (pause) Food: for a bowling alley, not bad, you can tell there's some effort put there in presentation and tasteAtmosphere: you typical dark with glowing lights at night with music and videos and regular during the day.video game area in the back. Full bar as well. drinks are pretty good there. if you want privacy there's a room in the back with some private lanes and you get your own server and bathrooms and bar, which is nice but of course it come with a price. Get you Bowl on!!!",1,1,1
195,Annie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",651,595,710,3.0,3/3/2011,"Very fun atmosphere.Lots of light and music. Bowling is bowling. Had fun. This review is more towards food and service. I was actually surprised that the food was not too bad. Fries were on the hypertensive side but the sliders and shrimp were pretty good. The waiters however were hard to track down and frankly standoffish.On top of things, price to bowl eat and drink is ridiculous. Wont catch me here that often.",1,1,
196,Troy L.,"New York, NY",64,195,13863,2.0,7/20/2012,"I went to bowl at 300 on a Friday night. The place was really nice. Beside a bowling alley they have a full bar and in the back' near the bathroom had a game area. The cost to bowl was 11.25 a game, not including 6 shoe rental. Drink were 11. I order the wedge salad but it was mediocre but I did not have that high expectation for a bowling alley salad. I would got again for a special event or if there was some sort of promotion going on.",3,6,
197,Jack B.,"Franklin Square, NY",7,23,23,3.0,4/30/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night thinking it was ridiculous to drive all the way to manhattan just to bowl but it was something different so why not. About 31 bucks per person for two games and shoe rental. The kitchen closes at 1230am and we arrived around that time so sadly we didnt get to try any food but the menu seemed interesting. Ordered one drink from the bar which was dissapointing. A 24oz lemonade concoction that was pretty weak for what I expected. The place has an arcade, bowling and seemed like thay had some activities that seemed to require a harness around you, interesting. Limited selection of bowling balls but if you just bowl once in a while for fun then it wouldnt really matter I think. We all enjoyed ourselves and thats what really mattered so 3 stars. Parking in the area was pretty easy too, always a plus.",,,

199,Chris H.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",33,31,12,2.0,7/26/2014,"I only gave two stars because my girlfriend begged me. If I could I would have given 0 stars or a negative.  The redeeming quality of this place was 1) the bowling, which was fine, I mean you are a bowling alley, can't suck at that and stay in business. And the other redeeming quality which earned this place any stars at all was the bartender who obviously lost a bet, or killed a bunch of people in a prior life to be stuck working at this place with a bunch of half wit morons who were literally incompetent at anything. I'm surprised they didn't need to be reminded to breathe.  It began when we walked in the door, we were ignored for a solid 10 minutes by two separate employees (Saturday afternoon in the summer it was NOT busy). Finally when we were assigned a lane, the waitress, who I politely asked for a menu, and told her that I'd like to put in an order, proceeded to completely ignore us for the remainder of our time there.  Which was for another hour. This is despite closing out the tab of the people next to us. Now, I would usually never write a a review like this, everyone is entitled to a bad day, I worked in food service for seven years and I completely understand. However, to have such incompetence and apathy pervading literally all areas of this business (bartender aside) seems shocking. So, buyer beware. Hope your experience is better than ours. But don't say I didn't warn you.",3,3,1
