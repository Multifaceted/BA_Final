0,,9/25/2015,72,1,"New York, NY",Alyssa Y.,39,5.0,256,"S&C was an absolute godsend. After extensive research and numerous tastings, I originally hired Daniel Boulud's Feast & Fetes for my wedding but due to their lack of professionalism, I switched a few months into the planning process. We were debating between Sonnier & Castle, Union Square Events, and Creative Edge, and we're so happy with our final choice!Keith Berg at S&C was a breath of fresh air and made me feel at complete ease-- he immediately understood our vision for an elegant event with inventive and beautifully presented food. My husband and I are HUGE foodies so at the end of the day, the food mattered most. And boy did Keith and S&C deliver! Not only that, but they were communicative, professional, and most importantly, they stayed right on budget. They also set up the venue exactly as I had envisioned and helped keep things on track. If you're still on the fence, just go for it and hire S&C!",3
