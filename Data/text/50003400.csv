0,MARK S.,"Los Angeles, CA",325,5,1,3.0,6/25/2018,"Chester Management:Your establishment is beautiful and I love the outdoor space. Please give your staff training. Here are some basic issues for you to resolve:The hostess was only seating every other group. Very unclear as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or whether we were supposed to be seated.The server ignored us. We had to order our drinks at the bar.The bartender ignored me. Even though the bar was dead the bartender was counting money and told me she would take my order when she was done. Took way longer than it should have. Same issue when I was trying to pay, the bartender was busy doing some sort of admin work and not willing to accept my money.We wanted to order food. When we told a server, she told us that she is not our server, but she would tell our server. She didn't.Based on the people around us who actually had their orders taken, the food took forever to arrive. As did the check.This bar has SO much potential. There's no reason why it shouldn't be packed every day of the summer. If you give your staff a bit of basic training and clear lines of accountability, you will have me as a regular customer. If not I'll just go to the Standard.",1,,
1,Kia A.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",1,203,1042,2.0,8/9/2018,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon with my friend as we cruised about the area. The place was basically empty and it had a cute Biergarten with shade, so we opted to try it out. (It was 90+ degrees that day) We entered through the hotel because the entrance wasn't clearly marked. We were seated immediately and the waiter came by in a timely fashion to get our drink orders. After bringing water and beverages he answered food questions and took our order. My friend and I had plenty to catch up on so at first I didn't notice the wait time. We were waiting for about 40 mins for food. We got there approximately at 1:30pm and the food didn't come out until 2:10pm!!I mentioned it was empty there right? Now if we had gotten super complex meals I could totally understand the wait. If it was like restaurants that have melting lava cake and they tell you it's a 40minute wait then I'd be like well that's what we wanted. We ordered a salad and a burger. It really shouldn't take that long. Food: the burger was tasty, but nothing to rave about. Is it worth the $20 price tag? Absolutely not! The salad my friend got was  Frisée Aux Lardones(coated poached egg salad). Her salad was good not too big- if it weren't for the fries I didn't want she would've been hungry. Speaking of fries- the option for the burger were fries or saffron rice. I asked about a salad substitution and there was an up-charge. I just didn't understand that when they're giving you saffron rice. Don't they know how expensive and precious saffron is? But they want to charge extra for some lettuce and perhaps tomato?! Give me a break! Thus overall the food was lackluster especially considering how long we had to wait for it. Note there was a guy not too far away from us that had been waiting around as long as we had and he too ordered a salad.  Interior: this is what attracted us to the place and it was nice to eat outside without dogs sniffing your legs and people bumping into your table as the absentmindedly look at their phones. Service: this really wasn't that great. The waiter seemed nice enough, but he really didn't check on us or offer us any solace as we waited for our food. He did ask us how the food was a few minutes after getting it but he missed the mark where it counted! Overall, I don't ever plan on coming back to this place again! I can spend the same amount elsewhere for better service and timely food arrival.",,1,
2,AJ M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",148,2,0,1.0,7/21/2018,"Do not recommend. Burgers were overcooked, took forever and for what we got, they were overpriced. Service is super slow and disorganized. We went on a night where it wasn't even crowded. Also, the urinals are too high for small men. I myself am 5' 11"" so I did not have a problem.

It also paired nicely with the shitake mushrooms and mesclun salad mix. We had unlimited brunch drinks, so that added to the fun.

5,Karen K.,"New York, NY",2,70,127,3.0,6/3/2018,"Came out here for my friend's Birthday/Surprise Engagement dinner. The place is pretty cool. It is small from where the party was seated, did not make my business to walk around & check out the place. The music was popping for a Saturday evening. The drinks are strong & good! I had the 'West Side' the food was also delicious. I had the 'Salmon with the Butter Squash' with a side order of Mashed Potatoes. Service was okay, only thing was the kitchen had forgotten two dishes but our server had taken it off the bill. Thank you. I give this place a 3/5 due to my friend making reservations in advance for the 'part room' I would call it. The person on the other end of the phone stated that everything would be fine & she would have the 'party room'. As for the day of the event, the 'party room' was not reserved for her due to not being on the list for that night. Which was a disappointment! We were seated in a comfortable area just for us & bar right behind us but still a disappointment.",,,1
6,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,3.0,12/22/2016,"My friend and I walked over to the Gansevoort Hotel to eat at The Chester after locking out and catching a bit of Gwen Stefani's pop-up concert in Hell's Kitchen. We decided to eat at the bar inside because the outside was packed and we just wanted to be able to order quickly and eat. The bartenders were nice. They acknowledged us when we sat and took our order quickly. My friend and I eat like we're on death row, so in good fashion, we had a nice little spread:Bavette Squid- OK. Nothing specialFoie Apple Burger - OK. The foie was sexy, silky and sultry but we found something in the burger so it was compedBlistered Shishitos - Good, nicely Salted and a good charSalmon Tartare - OK but underseasonedWe ended up eating next to one of the coordinators with the show who got a chance to eat in between all of the work she was doing. We were watching her food, bags and cellphones while she went to the bathroom. She was really nice and ordered Chicken & Waffle Fries and actually offered us some because she knew she didn't gave enough time to eat everything. All of us we turned off by the chicken and although the waffle fries were a nice touch, the star is the chicken and the fact that the pieces were not at all that good was disappointing. It's funny because she said she's southern and that the meal was meh.I doubt I'll ever be back for an actual meal. I would definitely come back for happy hour drinks and maybe apps but nothing fancy.",9,4,9

I went for dinner last night with my husband, and despite the restaurant being almost empty, the hostess was nowhere to be found, and it took us forever to check in and get seated. The wine we ordered tasted like vinegar, we didn't get plates for our shared appetizer and dessert came with plastic spoons. I will say that the steak was nice, but not nice enough to make up for the rest of the evening. Service was so agonizingly slow that we ended up going up to the hostess station to ask for, and then pay the bill, because we couldn't get out of there quickly enough.",,,

13,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",262,1056,2509,2.0,5/18/2016,"Before I get too deep into this review, let me clarify my rating. If this review was just about our first waitress, it'd be four starts. If it was just about the drinks, two stars. If it was just about the food we ordered and consumed, one star. If it was just about the waitress who took over after our first one left, zero stars. (Ooh, foreshadowing...)The only things on our minds when we walked past this place were, ""Outdoor seating and booze"". We weren't hungry, we didn't care about anything else beyond people watching on a patio and chatting over good drinks. We got settled in at the outdoor bar seating and waited for our first waitress, Alicia, to stop by. She was sweet and friendly and recommended a few of the cocktails on the menu. We placed our orders (I got some kind of ginger concoction that was decent, but mostly ice) then kicked back to enjoy the company and the people watching. Let me just say, the cocktail was not worth the price. Had I noticed the $18 price tag before ordering, it never would've happened. $18, man! For the second round, I desperately wanted a beer, and mentally cheered when I saw they had Left Hand nitro in bottles. I ordered one, while one girl ordered a glass of red and the other decided to try a hefeweizen for the first time. My Left Hand came out in the bottle, which she opened in front of me. I immediately asked for a glass (you can't drink a nitro out of a bottle!), which she said she'd bring right out. The red was the tiniest pour I'd ever seen in my life. But the thing that drew my eye was the ""hefeweizen"" that was put in front of my friend. As soon as it was set down, I said, ""That's the wrong beer. There's no way that's a hef!"" This beer was pale, clear and fizzy. It was a pilsner. Being new to beer, she didn't know, but she started to drink it, and realized she liked it. I really wanted to bring it to Alicia's attention, but decided to fight my own battles, instead. Approximately five minutes had passed since beer delivery, and I was still waiting on a glass for my nitro. She eventually came back and realized that I was still waiting, but it was a few more minutes before I got the glass. Meanwhile, she must've heard us talking about the hef that wasn't, because she came back out with the correct beer. By that time I was ready for another nitro (I was on vacation, don't judge me), so I ordered another. She came back out with a bottle of beer that wasn't Left Hand and a new glass (heh).Apparently, I'd ordered the last Left Hand they had, so she wanted to know if I would be interested in trying the German brown they had in bottles. She told me it'd be about the same. I highly doubted that, but told her I'd make her a deal. I knew that they had that brown on tap, so I said if I could get that beer on draft, I'd take it. She came back with a freshly pulled Krombacher Dark, which she set in front of me. One sip and I knew I'd been had, but I wasn't going to let it go to waste. It had to have been the most bland brown I've ever had. Very uninteresting and not tasty. It was around this time that we decided we wanted to order a little something to help soak up the booze. We deferred to the one with the food allergy, and ended up asking for an order of the fries to share. THIRTY FIVE MINUTES LATER, we were still fry-less. Our waitress came by to say that her shift was ending, and that she's just checked on the fries, which she promised were coming. She said we'd be taken care of by the new waitress, but she lied. New waitress was terrible. I mean, just awful. She ignored us. The one time she did come by, she was rude and indifferent. We had to catch the eye of the manager to get a update on our order of fries, because new waitress didn't give a hot damn about us. A full fifteen minutes after talking with the manager (so, almost an hour wait for fries), they were finally delivered. And they. Were. WRONG. We asked for regular fries. We got waffle cut, instead. But you know, after all that, we didn't want to argue. Who knows how long it would've taken to get the correct order? I will say that the manager, at least, did his best to do right by us. Plus, he apologized several times, and seemed to mean it. That counted for a lot to us, slightly tipsy and vaguely annoyed as we were. Three hours after parking our tushies in the chairs, we paid our bills and hit the road. Unbelievable to think that an hour of that time was spent yearning for fries...",4,1,
14,Harsh S.,"Waterbury, CT",47,7,0,1.0,8/11/2017,"This place shouldn't be called The Chester, it should be called The Cheater. I went there last weekend, ordered a vodka soda and gave bartender my card. The bartender (white male name starts with A) said minimum is $30. I only wanted one drink so I said I'll pay cash. He starts to look upset because I won't open up a tab. He returns my card, brings me my vodka soda, and charges me $14. I was a little bit surprised, so I asked for the receipt. He went back to the register and got me one. On the receipt it said ""kettle one"" with price of $14. I said to him ""I got a vodka soda"" and his response was ""yeah I used kettle one vodka for it"". Now I'm not sure if thats the price of the vodka soda or he just decided to over charge me as punishment for not opening a tab. Honestly I just wanted one drink and didn't want anymore. If $14 is the price then I must say it's outrageous for the type of place it is. You can go to a lot better bars, hell even rooftops in the city for those price drinks. Completely unjustified. If he over charged me, then hopefully The Chester teaches its employees the meaning of honesty and integrity. Also, as I was drinking, the bartender goes to the bouncer and whispers something in his ear. The bouncer looks at me and points while he is whispering back to him. I immediately knew he told the bouncer to get me out (the place was 80% empty so it was a little funny). So I quickly finished my drink and saw myself out. The positive: I actually had a wonderful conversation with the bouncer (at the door). As I was leaving, I told him ""I'm leaving because I know the bartender asked you to get me out. That man charged me $14 for a vodka soda so I asked him for a receipt to justify it. He didn't like it so he wants me out"". He was very pleasant and we ended up talking for like 15-20mins. He even recommend me a book I honestly wouldn't go back to this place ever again. because of this experience. The bartender was a complete and utter ass. There are plenty of other bars in that area. Don't waste your time at The Cheater...I mean Chester.P.S. There was another lady bartender who was pregnant. You'd think this place would give its staff maternity leave after charging insane prices",8,2,

18,Devin B.,"New York, NY",427,114,8,2.0,4/11/2018,"I've been to The Chester twice at night and both times I was a little underwhelmed. The first time was during the summer and the place was pretty busy. We got some drinks at the bar and then went into the back room where they had music and dancing. Overall it was fine, nothing really stood out to me other than the price of the drinks which were very pricey. The second time I went was more recently and the bar was empty. It probably didn't help that the construction going on in the front made it look like the place was closed, but still I was expecting a much bigger crowd on a Saturday night. My friends and I went to the back room again and I was pretty happy with the music, but there weren't really many people in there either. One round of drinks for three people was $56 with tip. If you're going to charge that much for drinks at least pack the place so you aren't drinking by yourself. Probably wouldn't go back here.",,,
19,Jessica H.,"Conshohocken, PA",551,84,117,4.0,8/3/2017,"Recently came here for my friends birthday. My friends reserved a table and it was free! Where in NY is it free for a birthday?! Thats the Bomb dot com! They also gave 2 free bottles of champagne to them during the night! It was awesome! The staff was super friendly and made sure everyone that was part of the birthday was very well accomodated. The location is also very convenient. The Chester has an outdoors with tables and chairs where people can sit and relax and an indoor with two full bars.There's also a roof top bar next door since the Chester makes the bottom floor of a hotel. There's also a separate club that you can get to through the Chester. Its through the red doors by the end of the Chester near one of the bars.The only suggestion I would make is that they should definitely clear out the tables after 11pm. They have music playing but theres nowhere to dance since theres still dinner tables and chairs laid out. If people want to sit, they can go to the other bar to sit. Nonetheless, after that pleasant first time experience, the whole crew and i will be coming back more often! Its the new spot!",1,1,1

26,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,6/16/2017,"I've been here a few times now, most recently this past weekend. In general I'd give it 4 stars, and I'd hate to hurt their rating, but for this most recent trip I can't say they're deserving.There's a nice outdoor space, though the view is currently that of construction cones and caution tape, and decent TV coverage (sometimes they show Bob's Burgers on silent with no captions).I definitely wouldn't make this a destination if you don't plan on being outside. It's fairly overpriced and you'd be better off at The Standard or The Tippler (highly recommended) if you're in the area.The outdoor space is composed of long, communal picnic tables that are not the most comfortable benches I've ever sat on, but hey, it's a bench, what do you want? We had a long table to ourselves and went to the window that allows you to order drinks without coming inside (great feature). They no longer had the beer we were looking for on tap but they did have bottles.I have to say, I think this was the bartender's first time ever pouring a beer. Ever. We got two of their wheat beers. She took the first bottle and aggressively dumped it into a tall glass which was instantly filled with at least 2/3 foam. Then she took the second bottle and did the same to the other glass. At this point, she went back and forth, sometimes switching bottles, pouring little drops as the foam settled down (though much of it flowed over). At the end of the day, it only took about 2 minutes to get the beers poured but still...2 minutes? To pour two beers? Come on, what is this amateur hour?",1,2,

The boys bringing out food- basically severed it to other tables first. Finally at our table, it was thrown at us. Allie has tried and done her finest in rectifying all she could. As for the ringmaster who facilitates and manages this 'circus'- perhaps go back to a hot dog stand and learn something. As I  type this We are waiting for our correct entrees...and they did. That took 25 minutes. During 'the wait' a manager? Assistant manager? Whomever he was, he was a kid with no explanation why all dishes initially ordered were served abruptly and incorrectly. Did this young man ever come back and ask if it was corrected? How was it? Anything else he can do? Absolutely not. Not even an offer of let me take the incorrect entree off, or may I get you a drink or dessert. He never followed up and was aware all entrees were sent back. Bill paid in full, even for the extremely wrong entree. Two in my party ordered steak frites. Those were sent back into the kitchen. If you would like eating rubber meat, this dish is for you.

She made excellent recommendations and knew everything about ever dish on the menu even though they had just launched their new Fall/Winter menu. I was really impressed with her professionalism.The pork belly she recommended was superb! The skin was crispy, sticky with sweet glaze but it did not over power the tenderness of the pig.  Comes with roasted veggies over a yogurt sauce. The combination of flavors tasted like a beautiful symphony.We also had the mussels $14 for about one lb. They are prepared steamed but not served in a broth. There is a garlic sauce which you dip the mussel into. I loved this way of eating mussels as you could determine if and how much sauce you wanted with each bite.The roasted cauliflower and shishio peppers were great veggie options for sharing.

The place with the tables when we were seated on the second floor was freezing  and the waiter said its like that there and ""Sorry about that"". The experience was awful!  Starting from the fact that we were alone on the floor, without any service people for about 20 min. Afterwards, the waiter had no idea what our voucher means, he had a very bad mood and ""service"" its not something he need to be doing. I believe there is a reason why this restaurant sells vouchers to boost the place, but with a level of service like that, it wont work. Continuing that there  were no Bellini and the Bloody Mary was tomato juice with pure paper and impossible to even taste it, how much it burned the throat. So we were stuck with ONLY mimosas which non of us like very much due to sensitivity to orange juice. The food arrived after more than 40 min. Any additional thing we asked (mayo, ketchup) either wasn't exist (BBQ sauce) either arrived after we almost finished the Burger.  Eventually, there was such a mess with the rest of the bill (taxes and tip) that it took 30 more min. and 4 times manager who needed to reach the table.We will never go back to this place and NOT recommending to anyone as well.",,,

60,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1635,64753,4.0,10/18/2013,"I'm never sure what to expect with hotel restaurants - they can either be incredible, and up there with the best dining experiences you could imagine, or they could be flashy, overpriced, and forgettable. I'm glad to say that The Chester, located in the Gansevoort Hotel, is much closer to the former.After this place was only open for about a week, I had already read multiple times how good the fried chicken here was, so I knew I had to come try it. It wasn't quite worth all of that hype, but the rest of the food here ended up being really good actually, especially for these types of places in Meatpacking (i.e. borderline feeling like you are in a club, dark, sceney, and $11 for a meatball).Yes, we started with The Meatpacking Meatball ($11, but luckily showed up on my bill as $9 for some reason), which is a (largish) meatball with a piece of toast. It happened to be a really excellent meatball, and was indeed big enough to share, but it will always be embarrassing to admit that I spent so much on one meatball.Since we apparently were only eating beige tonight, we also started with the Spicy Lamb Chili ($11), which comes with a ""Drop Cheddar Biscuit"". This was pretty tasty, and the biscuit was good, if a bit too small, but again a little outrageously priced.Things got much better with the entrees. We of course got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($20), which came with Black Pepper Biscuits and Ham Hock Gravy. Not quite what I expected, it consisted of 6 small pieces of chicken, 3 of which were boneless, white meat tenders. I'm not really complaining since bones just slow me down, and these 3 pieces were super juicy, nice and crispy, and very delicious. The other 3 pieces with bones were decent enough too, but I wouldn't have minded having just the white meat pieces. The biscuits were pretty good, but were amazing once dipped in that gravy. It tasted really meaty and salty, and was a perfect vehicle for the typical crumbly, somewhat dry texture of biscuits.The real winner though was The Chester Burger ($19). This consisted of two thin patties with American Cheese and Bread & Butter Pickles, along with some semi-thick Fries. It was pretty much a fancy, overpriced Big Mac, even down to the tasty version of the sesame seed bun. The meat was excellent, and served at a great temperature - still a bit pink, but not sloppy and falling apart.For a side, instead of the smarter choice of actually going for a vegetable, we went with the excellent ""Chester Mac & Cheese"" ($10) (it's a good thing they name their dishes like this, I almost forgot where I was eating). This is always a great combo with fried chicken, and this version did not disappoint. Nice and cheesy without being overly oily and gooey, it turned out to be a great choice.Unfortunately, they didn't have a dessert menu, and the waitress just didn't do a good enough job selling the few options. It just feels like an afterthought when they verbally tell you the choices like this, so I passed (if you are interested, they sounded pretty generic anyway: a chocolate brownie with vanilla ice ream, carrot cake with ginger ice cream, apple pie a la mode, and a trio of cupcakes infused with some alcohol).The atmosphere in here is very nice, and pretty typical of a Meatpacking Hotel Restaurant. They were playing good music, and the lights were getting low ready for what I'm sure will be a large late night crowd. The place is pretty huge, with several rooms and a ton of seating, both indoors and outdoors. The service was excellent - very friendly waitstaff and diligently attentive busboys refilling the water regularly.Hopefully they expand the menu in the coming months and eventually develop a dessert menu with some more inventive choices. I would definitely come back to sample some new dishes.",8,4,6

Updated review","So I decided to give The Chester another chance, because after all, everyone deserves one, especially after the establishment's Director of Hospitality reached out about my last visit. She assured me that my experience was the exception, and was anxious to confirm the details around my prior interaction to ensure it was not repeated.I am happy to say mission accomplished. We were greeted warmly at the front, and seated in the half filled dining room early on a Friday night. The music was a bit loud, but this is the MP, and the scene was pro forma. Our server was incredibly sweet and attentive and brought our two glasses of wine to enjoy while we took a bit longer with the menu - a pinot grigio for me and a merlot for my hubby, both of which were good pours. We then shared the salmon tartare which had a healthy serving of avocado mixed in - yum. For mains, I opted for the pan seared market fish - branzino that day - with ratatouille, which was a wonderfully crispy filet with a less than inspired side of veg that lacked in the more robust flavors of the traditional French stew. My husband got the Atlantic Salmon which came with asparagus and a whole grain mustard vinaigrette - the fish was perfectly medium, but the mustard was a confusing accompaniment - as though it were serving as the grain on the plate, there was a copious amount propping up the protein. In any case, the meal concluded with a fun and tasty homemade ice cream cookie combo - it hit the spot without feeling overly indulgent. I do get the sense that my previous stop in might have been on an off day, which is not an excuse, but as I looked around on this go-around, the tables were full by the time we finished, and the bar outside was filled with ostensibly happy patrons. At minimum, I value their efforts to put a personal touch on those who come through The Chester.",1,,1

69,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,351,290,3.0,4/24/2016,"I was a little confused to even be having brunch here.  It is in meatpacking, but it isn't a trendy, sceny or party brunch.  And why else have run brunch in meatpacking, quite frankly?  Likely because Chesters is in the Gansevoort Hotel, it has too much a touristy vibe.  My friend selected this place, but otherwise I don't think I would have come here on my own accord.  I prefer the larger space of the other Gansevoort Hotel in the city.  This one feels cramped, I don't like the interior layout of this one, and it seems more run down than the other one (lots of wear and tear on the couches in the lobby, for instance).The outdoor brunch seating here makes you feel like you are sitting right in the heart of meatpacking, which has such a different vibe during the day (more shopping than partying).  The steak and eggs I had for brunch were rather good as well.  The steak came on this pesto garlic sauce which made it good.  The eggs were eggs, but the potatoes on the side were better than I expected.What I wasn't so thrilled about was the service here.  Everyone is nice, but they try to rush you out when it isn't even that crowded.  Like the first hour was fine, but the second hour was like not so subtle questioning of whether we need anything else, were we done yet and could they take our dishes away, and then they finally had the gall to seat this family next to us as the tables are like long picnic style bench tables outside.  That did it and we quickly left thereafter, but we were only there for two hours total which is not unreasonable for brunch.  I actually felt more bad for the family that was just getting seated and were being brought to our picnic bench to share seating with us.  I think we all were collectively thinking this is so ghetto . . .",1,1,1

We saw The Chester down the street a bit and it looked like a modern, new spot.It took a minute for us to figure out where the hostess stand was, after seeing a printed sign at the entrance to the outdoor patio (which flanked the main entrance) asking us to see the hostess inside before sitting. After walking in and wandering around for a bit we ran into someone at the cash register. She was polite and took us to a table. The restaurant is new with a modern feel - clean also. It's attached to the Gansevoort Hotel so we were sitting with what appeared to be a mix of hotel guests and patrons off the street such as ourselves.For the first 5-10 minutes, it appeared it was just a single woman running the entire place - seating guests, waiting tables and running drinks to/from the bar and kitchen. After 10-15 minutes, more staff appeared out of nowhere and we had placed our order and been served our water, coffee (for me) and cocktail (for the wife) - I have a caffeine problem of which I have no shame.I ordered the Eggs Benedict exactly as it came. Eggs tasted fresh, cooked well, and they sat atop a nice freshly sliced avocado. Bringing things up from the bottom was a slightly-less-than-toasted English muffin (or something of that variety). On the side was steaming hot and perfectly toasted/roasted home fries with sautéed onions and tomatoes. Overall a very good meal that I would definitely order again.My wife ordered the grilled cheese. Their grilled cheese comes in a pita, which as a relatively healthy person I appreciated. Inside the pits was an very tasty cheese (I don't know remember what kind) and well done bacon (amazing bacon). Overall a fantastic grilled cheese. To wash it down with, she got The Royale cocktail and remarked as how refreshing it was - I didn't chase it.By now you're probably wondering why I only rated it three stars - it's because of the service, or lack thereof.From the time we ordered to the time we asked for the check, about a 30-40 minute timespan, not a single person checked on us - even with an empty coffee cup and plate in front of me for about 15-20 minutes. It took me staring a waitress or two down several times for them to come over. They didn't ask if I wanted more coffee, if we wanted anything else, etc. We just asked for the check.Another annoying thing, especially for a coffee addict like myself, is the cup of coffee they gave me was tiny - a few serious sips and it was empty. Well, with the exception for a pile of coffee grounds on the bottom.Overall, if you care mostly about the food, this place won't disappoint - at least for lunch and based on what we had. If you're picky about service, though, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",,,

The bartender was rude as soon as we got there. My friend wanted to order a beer and was very non-chalantly informed that they had run out. I ordered a gin gimlet straight up, got it on the rocks, asked her to fix it. What I received after was a glass half filled with warm gin and warm lime juice that was just poured into the glass. Not shaken and strained, not in the proper proportions. As you can imagine, it was vile and completely undrinkable. We paid around $50 for three drinks (two glasses of wine and one ""cocktail""). Whoever this ""bartender"" was needs to be seriously retrained, or better yet, switch professions.

Came here for a private party on the upstairs private room. It has plenty of space for about 50 people. A private bar to serve drinks and ample room to hang out.The bar foods were your standard. Nothing to stand out about. But highlights were the cuban sandwiches and the arancini. Cuban sandwiches were pressed well and had a nice amount of pork and pickle. The arancini was fried up well and had a nice cheese to rice ratio. They also mixed together a hell of a bloody mary.Typical meat packing district bar / restaurant. Nothing of note to stand out or for a destination type of place to go to. For a party group setting though it's one of the few in the city that offers a nice space to mingle. Also they did provide great service. Food plates were kept full and cleaning up of dishes happened regularly.,1,,

The mozzarella burger and pork belly burger are close seconds. The hummus flatbread, chicken milanese, salmon tartare all unbelievable.... But when it comes down to service and management, it's absolutely horrid. A lot of the employees here seem lost and confused 93% of the time, so if you're looking for great service, this isn't the best place to go, but if you're looking for great food and are patient enough to deal with the employees here, then I say go for it.",,,

We sat outdoors and enjoyed the fresh air of the autumn night. As the night wore on, businessmen filled the outdoor tables with their loudness and debauchery. We continued to munch on delicious beer, sangria, and fried foods. The quality of the food, especially the chicken, were really good. The fried chicken was seasoned very well and overly breaded like chain chicken restaurants (ahem KFC). They ran out of potato skins so we weren't able to try that. This is a great spot to grab a drink and unwind. The service was pretty acceptable but we did have to track down some waiters/waitresses for more water and napkins.",,,

No drinks so the bill was $25 per person (my girlfriend also ordered a salad!).  We stayed until about 10pm and people were just arriving for dinner.  I could see how this place could be a nice hot spot for young professionals but I did not get a sports bar feeling at all.

They play fun music (i.e. old school Justin Timberlake, Daft Punk, etc.), but you can actually hear people across from your table, too. Even for dinner, their sandwiches, burgers, and salads are all under 20 dollars, so it's perfect for a birthday party because they a) have big tables and b) we all have those friends on a budget that never want to pay more than $20 for a meal.

We had about 4/5 drinks that totaled around $80.00, and that was right before going to dine at STK. Burned a hole in my wallet that night. And also...they served my martini in a cocktail glass, not a martini glass...you would think if you are charging close to $20 for a martini, you can serve it in a proper glass.

101,susan n.,"East Rutherford, NJ",5,301,226,2.0,6/13/2015,"The burrata heirloom tomato special was outstanding! And the West Side blackberry bourbon drink is amazing. I would suggest if you want to try these, as they really are remarkable, go to the bar.When I walked in, I was surprised to see that the restaurant looks nothing like the picture on its website. I was a little surprised to see it was about 6 tables- not the vibrant dining scene I was expecting from a Meatpacking joint. Very claustrophobic, and small, and filled up eventually with families wearing shorts.  I had a reservation, and we were asked to wait as they prepared a table. I glanced over and saw 5 empty tables, so was confused by the very lengthy wait. So we went outside and grabbed a table in the garden. On a nice day, this would be a great place for a beer. Unfortunately, it was so humid, it was unbearable. Apparently, they have a garden menu of pretzels and bratwurst, but refuse to serve the main dining room food in the garden. This makes no sense to me. If I want to eat dinner, and don't feel like bar food, why can't they bring the food outside from the same kitchen?  So back indoors we headed and this time were seated more promptly. As I said, the West Side cocktail is amazing, and the burrata special was amazing. The rest of the food was average at best. I did not enjoy the ravioli with mushroom bolognese at all. The carrots were not cooked enough, and cut way too large. The dish was exceedingly salty. The raviolis were overcooked, and mushy. The pesto bolognese was ok, but overcooked and oily. Not cheap. Dinner for 4 was over $200. I know this is typical of the area, and I don't mind spending that kind of dough on great food in a beautiful setting, but feel disappointed and a little foolish forking over that kind of dough on average food in an average setting. There are so many AMAZING restaurants within a few blocks of this place. The bathrooms are up a long staircase. Ok. So put a few cocktails in you, and march those 4"" heels up that thing. OK!Oh, and there is a bathroom attendant, so make sure to remember to bring tips. Thousands of restaurants in NYC have nice clean bathrooms without having some lady to sit there all night handing paper towels out, waiting for tips. This is a 1980s dance club concept and completely unnecessary, and uncomfortable. We started regretting going indoors. It was so hot in the restaurant- it was so uncomfortable. The air was not up high enough. And the front door kept opening as beers were brought outside (couldn't they use the door from the bar to the garden for that?), and customers coming and going...and the hot air from outside was inside the whole night. It was so uncomfortable. When we left after dinner, we were surprised to find it was pleasant outside, and all that time we were sweating inside. And then the roof came down. No, literally. An enormous (must have been 10 pounds) tile broke off the ceiling and crashed down. Luckily, none of the customer or  waitresses bustling around were hurt.  WOW!To top the whole thing off, I left a bag with a few personal items under the table that they didn't bother to save for their customer. They probably tossed it out at the end of the night. Lost and found? Why bother?  I can only see myself returning to have a beer in the garden or a drink at the bar. Skip dinner.  Don't leave anything behind. Watch out for falling tiles.",1,2,

It was Saturday afternoon - about 3pm, so still the restaurant was in lunch/brunch mode. We sat outside, which always lends itself to people watching - especially in this area. I started with half a dozen oysters - 3 west coast, 3 east coast. The east coast (ambrose? or some name I have not heard of before nor was it listed on the menu) were rather briny as you might expect but they were shucked terribly! One I couldn't even pry out of its shell because the foot was so strongly attached still. The west coast (I was told holy grail was the name but I thought those were from Maryland so who knows) were sweeter but again, shucked extremely poorly. I wasn't even thinking of having oysters, but they were on their brunch menu as specials so I figured that meant the kitchen would be used to serving them. Apparently not. Very frustrating.I followed the oysters with their tomato and cucumber salad without the feta. The salad was a nice portion and well dressed.To me, if you are going to offer something on your menu, you have to be prepared to serve it. The fact that most of the oysters weren't even freed from their oyster-foot grip to me says amateur. And at the same price as most other places ($3 each), you should really know what you are doing. As I said, because that was so negative, I was going to say just - meh - in my review but our server was bubbly and nice as was the bus boy.

124,Rachel B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,1.0,9/20/2016,"I absolutely regret choosing to go to The Chester to after-work drinks this summer. While the location is awesome and the outdoor seating area is definitely a plus, the service we experienced and the cost of the food we ate was a joke.We ordered two rounds of drinks (glasses of wine, to be exact), avocado toast, and the hummus flatbread. The drinks were reasonable (especially since it was 1/2 price wine for happy hour), but we spent a majority of the time passing around wines because we didn't know which one was which (we ordered Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc). When the server came over to give us the wine, he even was questioning which glass was which. This happened for BOTH rounds that we ordered.The avocado toast was a whopping $16 and was about 1 bite per person. The Hummus Flatbread (at $17) was completely underwhelming. The worst part about the meal was the service we experienced when we were handed the check. The waiter charged us full price for all 6 glasses of wine and we had to remind him of the happy hour special (1/2 price wines by the glass). He then returned with the corrected bill, no apology, no acknowledgement of the mistake. I am sad that this place turned out to be such a bust, especially because I am new to the neighborhood and would have loved to go back.",,,

We stumbled upon the cheater and they seated us right away! The outside patio had a great atmosphere and the food was delicious! The porkbelly burger was definitely a winner. Wasn't really a fan of the Bloody Mary because it tastes more like cocktail sauce. Overall it was a good find!,,,

Middle of the summer, hot, and muggy. all i wanted was a cool place to hang and catch up with my friends.And the chester delivered in Spades.The food was great! All my friends and I ate were apps and some cocktails, maybe seated for 45 minutes. Desirée greeted us at the door, but I think she was a server outside. She had tons of tables, a typical Saturday night in NYC I'm sure, but she was still able to take the time to step away and make sure that we were promptly seated and out of the humid climate!Megan was our server, and she was just as great! She had great knowledge of the menu, was able to get the food and cocktails out promptly. (none of our party had allergies or intolerances, but I'm sure if we did that she would go above and beyond to make sure the food was prepared appropriately)She kept us topped off with drinks, and hydrated with water. couldn't have asked for more.Then John the manager for the evening came up to our table and introduced himself.I heard that there was a rooftop from my friends, I causally mentioned if we could go up.He told me its part of the hotel,( the ganesvoort) not the restaurant; but he would see what he could do.Minutes later we are headed to the top floor. music is bumping, drinks start flowing, beautiful men and women all over the place; i cheers my friends for the night and couldn't have asked for a better time in NYC. Upon my return to the city I will definitely come out there again and bring friends who haven't been.(August 14TH was the day I was there i believe)",,,

Seriously, who cares about organic alcohol and mixers...just get me a cocktail...stat :)Our waitress came over and over the course of 6 or 7 visits to our table, messed up our drinks orders, couldn't tell us where the bathroom was, tried to explain that the menu she gave us isn't the actual menu and that we needed to order from the happy hour menu...which she also gave us. She told us that they were serving food and then told us 30 minutes later that they weren't. I suspect it was this waitresses first day...but still, she was really bad. It was a frustrating and expensive (average cocktail price = $18) experience that certainly won't be repeated. Why is it so hard to get the basics right?

Not sure how their Executive Chef got their position - my guess is nepotism, because it surely is not because of  technique or quality. Nothing was cooked right - burger overdone and flavorless. Fries undercooked and under seasoned. Chicken overcooked, veggies overcooked - both under seasoned. Also - out of Rose - you know, only one of the most popular summer wines....

Next round of martinis came proper size, without a word.Apart from the lousy service (and this is because they were understaffed on surely once of the busiest nights of the year - not the fault of the waitresses), the food was ok.

A second waiter appeared but only to take our salt, pepper and place settings right off our table because he needed them for another group. After 15 minutes we got up and left the restaurant, opting for the rooftop lounge afforded by the adjoining hotel. Very strange and unexpected.

137,Ben L.,"Manhattan, NY",203,128,16,2.0,8/8/2014,"This is restaurant is incredibly basic. The menu is virtually the same as any other New American quasi-upscale place (think kale, truffle this and that, and ""elevated classics""). While I was there my group and I had every appetizer on the menu, I had the steak frites for my main, and we all split the strawberry shortcake, apple crumble, and banana split.I found none of the appetizers particularly memorable. Though I do have to say they have some good oysters. And I didn't necessarily HATE anything, I just wasn't impressed. My steak was decent, though I requested medium-rare and it was creeping into medium, but it was still decently tender and juicy. desert was also OKAY. The apple crumble and banana split were exactly what you would expect. I was not a fan of the strawberry short cake. It comes in a mason jar (another BS trend), which I don't mind when it actually makes eating the item easier; in this instance it creates a hassle as you can't actually have all the layers together. Generally speaking, everything was pretty one note.So yeah underwhelming, but why it gets 2 stars as opposed to 3 or so, is how expensive this basicness is. So, if you're a basic, in meat packing looking for a SUPER CUTE restaurant, this place will certainly service your food needs. Otherwise your dollar could be used better... like on an $18 gin and tonic in any of the nearby clubs.",1,,
138,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",270,122,1,4.0,1/27/2014,"At $17/cocktail, the drinks are overpriced. That being said, they are excellently made and strong. I am a converted fan of the Westside -- who knew that bourbon & blackberries went so well together? GENIUS. So genius that I had three and couldn't be bothered to try something else. My friend, on the other hand, chose to diversify with the Sawdust, the Mineshaft, and the Hudson. His favourite of the three was the Hudson (Chester's take on the classic Manhattan).Other than the delicious concoction that is the Westside, The Chester isn't all that memorable (and not because of the alcohol!). It's your typical Meatpacking bar/lounge experience with friendly/chatty bartenders that tend to disappear every so often, bar areas that swarm with people and empty out just as quickly. But because the Westside was so good, I can't help but rate this place 4-stars. Bourbon & Blackberries, FTW!",3,3,

After it was sent back and came out again, the chicken was undercooked. To top it all off, the waitress poured hot coffee over ice to refill an iced coffee...seriously? The food was mediocre at best. The chicken sandwich was boring and the burger was decent, but there are better hamburgers to spend your money on.  After profusely apologizing, the manager decided to comp our entire meal.

Honey, you're a hostess not the pope, check yourself. Food: I went with a large group for a birthday party and we did the pre-fixe so I had the opportunity to sample lots of things. DO NOT do the pre-fixe under any circumstances. Total rip-off. $65 for food, doesn't include tip or tax. You wouldn't spend $65 on food period there let alone do you get $65 worth of food in the pre-fixe. None of the food was above average. Not one single dish. The Wedge salad was a joke, go to any bodega and get a better one. The Burratta flatbread: mediocre cheese with a couple of little tomatoes thrown on some greasy bread. The main dishes, chicken, steak and tuna were yet again average: actually, the chicken wasn't even that. Dessert can suck it, such an afterthought at this place. Drinks: $10 for an Amstel Light in a bottle? Are you kidding me? I know this is NYC and the meatpacking but that is an insult to my intelligence, do you idiots over at The Chester really think that I will accept this? Cocktails are nothing special either. All in all.......Not a good sign when the last two restaurants, Tanuki Tavern and Toy went out of business after a year or so of being open despite it being in a prime location. This place will be the same. Just because you're in the meatpacking in a ""trendy"" location doesn't mean you can throw lackluster, overpriced, unimaginative food and drinks on the table and expect it to work.",3,3,

This place has a weird medeival feel, ehh, but was just awkward.  You have wood ceilings and white tiles with foggy mirrors, I'm confused.  The tables were comfy though, but the decor just didn't make sense to me (maybe I missed something).Food:Appetizers:   Proscuitto Flatbread with arugula.  Ok, let me keep it as honest as I can here.  The flatbread itself was delicious; right amount of cheese, flavoralful proscuitto, BUT, someone went arugula happy.  It was literally as though we had a salad on top of our flatbread....moderation people!     Kale caesar: Brilliant, simply brilliant.  What I loved about the concept of using kale was that kale is one of those leafy greens that stays crisp despite having dressing on it.  Croutons were delicious.  One complaint; if you say a salad has tomatoes....there needs to be more than 2 sliced cherry tomatoes.  It made the salad appear cheap.  Flavor was good overall.Entrees:     Marinated Skirt Steak: Finally, a good choice and winning dish.  The marinate was sweet but not overwhelmingly so.  It was cooked a perfect medium rare and served over roasted potatoes.  Chester, this one you owned. Too bad the rest didn't meet that expectation.     Grilled cod: Blah, overdone and in a non-flattering sauce.  Here's my thing about cod, it's THICK aka you need to have a sauce that is either thick and stays wtih the fish OR put it in a broth.  Either of those techniques will save you when you slightly overcook the fish.  The cod was served on roasted peppers --- highlight of the dish.Now, for my overall complaint: Restaurant temperature...Dear Mr. Mananger, if you're restaurant is TOO cold A) people won't eat as much and B) the food gets cold quickly.  There were people sitting at dinner with winter coats on NEON SIGN that it's too cold.Also, be prepared to pay an arm and leg for a drink: $10 for a beer, $17 for a mixed drink.  Considering the other restuarants we've been to in the area, this was a miss.",2,1,

Then when you finally did get your drink it was often not what you asked for at all. It was ridiculous. Though the place was not filled, there was only one bar on the main floor open so it took forever to get a drink and you had to fight your way to the front. We were supposed to have appetizers, party favors, and a champagne toast at midnight included with our ticket and got none of these things. They also ran out of rum and gin in the first few hours of the open bar. If it is an open bar I would expect them to be well stocked with common liquors.

He turned down all of my drink requests three times in a row. He talked as if I was inconveniencing him for ordering drinks at the bar.

We got a pizza with asparagus and bacon... DELISH and an order of fried calamari. It got even hotter. We asked the waitress what was going on, she apologized and looked hot and frazzled as it was, and said it was on but she wasnt sure why it was so hot, maybe the high ceilings she said. Unsure of that as an excuse but since she was running ragged we felt bad. We ordered dinner, burgers, fried chicken, quinoa and the special of the night pulled pork. Nothing was bad, no one complained about anything other than the fact that it was uncomfortably hot. No one was able to even eat half of their dish because it was so hot. it really put a damper on our evening.

165,Vanessa M.,"Manhattan, NY",246,10,1,1.0,7/25/2015,I was craving a burger and came here with two other friends on a Saturday- brunch time. My medium was well done but ate it because I was starving. My friend doesn't like condiments- her burger came with sauce on it. Two burgers stayed. Two burgers eaten. Two meals finished. My friend still doesn't have her food. We were starving when we sat down. Server was M.I.A. Manager didn't come to speak to us until after two of us finished our meals. Everything was cleared and we still waited for her food another 15-20min. Oh yeah and when the food originally got here we had no silverware & no ketchup. The water service sucked too. It's summertime keep a water bottle at the table. Not coming back here. So many missed opportunities to make it up to us quickly. If you like good customer service don't come here. I'm usually full of compliments but the only pro here is that the outdoor seating is nice.,,,
166,Jessica M.,"Norwalk, CT",0,58,3,2.0,5/18/2015,"Very strange dining experience. Came for lunch, the place was beautiful, and completely empty. Ordered oysters which took about 20 minutes to come out. I know shucking is hard, but there were only 6 of them. No spoon for the mignonette  and cocktail sauce that came with it. We didn't bother asking, as it would likely have taken another 20 minutes to procure this. We then waiting another 20 minutes for our very difficult to assemble chicken caesar salads, which promised a classic anchovy dressing. and tasted more like sesame. I'm also pretty sure our waitress was the most unhappy human being walking (or in this case trudging) through planet earth. There are so many better places to eat in this area. I recommend you take your appetite and wallet there.",,1,

During dinner we walked up to the manager and asked him to bring a surprise birthday cake, and instead a server came over with the cake asking who ordered it. The bill took 30 min to come, despite asking our server Marie multiple times, explaining we we're in a rush. It seems she was too busy gaggeling over the neighboring table of guys. Completely unprofessional, and put a huge damper on a previously enjoyable night.",,,

174,Isabella W.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,152,9,3.0,5/25/2015,Fun place though I'm bummed because we were waiting to order brunch this afternoon and before our server came back some dude came and took out menus and replaced with dinner menus. I really wanted brunch and wish our server had told us we had to order within a time frame when we sat down and were given those particular brunch menus. Seems like it should be something you should tell your guests when you're on the verge of changing the menu. Or check in to see if they want to order before the menu changes. Ugh.,,,
175,Amanda W.,"La Verne, CA",4,23,15,3.0,6/8/2015,We came here after a long weekend of touring the city. We had great drinks and loved our food. The down side was the service. We asked for bread and she told us she didn't like it...because of that she wouldn't bring us any. We had to ask so many times! She finally brought it and it was a hit. It took so much time for everything we asked for. I'm ok with casual service but making us feel like an inconvenience was unacceptable.,,,

177,Emily B.,"Long Island, NY",0,15,5,2.0,1/23/2015,"I went to the Chester because I was staying in the gansevoort hotel. It was pouring rain out so we decided to eat at the Chester. The service was slow and the waitress was rude to be and my two girlfriends. There are very few options on the dinner menu. For the price you pay, the portions are small. The food was average and not anything special. I would not return to this restaurant unless necessary.",1,,
178,Maria T.,"Manhattan, NY",92,71,24,4.0,5/3/2015,I am a fan of the Arthur room in the back of this restaurant. It's pretty small but I love the vibe. It's more of a lounge and they have had a DJ on the weekends that's I went. The cocktails are great and the staff is pretty friendly which is always a plus. A lot of NYC establishments have uptight bouncers and bartenders so the fact that this place doesn't is a breathe of fresh air. I would definitely return and I have recommended to friends.,,,
179,Ashley F.,"New York, NY",4,10,2,1.0,6/18/2016,I'm not sure what is worse the clientele or the management. Came for a birthday and hotel room guests smashed their bottles/ice tray down thru the non closed awning of the Chester. When brought to managements attention he could not care less and his flippant attitude is the reason our entire party of 25 will never return. A girl of the party dove to the ground and rolled under the table because she believed it was gun shots and management wouldn't even blink an eye. I am disgusted that people react to hospital-table circumstances in such a carefree manner when terror is the upmost concern. I will never return here and do not have enough negativity to encourage others to do the same.,,,
180,Ricky G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,6/10/2015,Amazing. Had a surprise brunch for my boyfriend and it was amazing. They were able to fit my entire group and the event coordinator helped me in every way imaginable!,,,
181,Elizabeth C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,9,0,1.0,1/19/2015,"I had made a reservation for Sunday brunch. We were meeting friends and after arriving, I received a call from one letting me know that the waitress had told her that the kitchen had flooded and they would not be able to accommodate us. Having had just spoke to the hostess, and her telling me we would be seated when the rest of my party arrived, I was somewhat confused and figured I had arrived at the wrong location (which has happened to good ol' me before). When I asked her about it she confirmed that there had been an earlier issue in the kitchen, but it had since been cleared up. Great, lets do this.She brought us to our table and the place is really cute. If was pouring outside and they have a great little enclosed patio that was just calling my name to sit for hours and drink endless Bloody Mary's to let my hair down on this lovely little 3 day weekend. It wasn't until 20 minutes later that the waitress first approached our table, only to ask if we wanted still or tap water. We figured there was some commotion, with the earlier flood/non flood issue so we gave her the benefit of the doubt that she had a lot on her plate. She dropped off the water as if she was pouring out of a moving car and ran away before we could get a chance to give her our order. It was then another 10 minutes before we decided this wasn't going to happen for us, and it was time to make another reservation. Having worked as a waitress myself, I understand that there are certain unavoidable events that make this a nightmare situation for yourself. They should have just been more straightforward and let us know that there was something going on with the kitchen and they would not be able to honor our reservation. Instead, I had wasted 30 minutes, burger-less, having to only search for another place in the pouring rain. Shame. Place looked really great and the food looked delicious. Maybe ill give it another go, but highly doubtful.",,,1

The $130 per person tickets we bought said the party and open bar starts at 7pm but when we arrived they said it's not open till 9pm and would not let us in. When we got there, a drunk hostess couldn't find our table and was stumbling all over the place. She almost fell and then she finally did fall on her ass and was sent home, and this was all before the party started. The music was whack. Then an hour later, they ran out of Coca Cola! What kind of bar runs out of Coca Cola???????? I have never in my life! Omg. So no more Jameson's and Coke. Whatever. Lame party. Waste of money.",,1,

185,Lauren C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,17,1,2.0,4/25/2014,"Went here for dinner on a Thursday (try using Savored and getting 20% off)Two stars for two things:1. The fried chicken was really tender, juicy and delicious (although there isn't much of it)2. The ambiance/decor is really nice. And here's why it didn't get more stars:1. The draft beer ""wasn't working"" 2. So I played it safe and got a bud light bottle 3. Only to be told they were actually out of bud light. 4. I got the grilled cheese but it seriously had one slice of cheese on it. It was so dry I had to send it back to the kitchen and I NEVER do that. But it was a $13 grilled cheese, come on. 5. Got the bill and the bud light was still on the bill. 6. Including tip it was over $80 for two drinks 4 pieces of fried chicken and a made-better-but-still-meh grilled cheese.

I loved all of the salads on the menu. The burrata flatbread and oysters were so fresh and lived up to the farm to table expectation I had. I don't even typically like fried chicken but it was well flavored and perfectly crispy not to mention the biscuit on the side was amazing.The sweet potato fries were also delicious as was the Pasta Primavera. The veggies in the pasta had substance and added flavor unlike other plain pasta's I've had. Finally getting to dessert, the chocolate brownie with brittle on top was divine. I am a chocolate lover and this hit the spot! The bread pudding was one of the best I've had and i loved the cinnamon ice cream on top. I only have positive things to say about the service. They were so attentive to our demanding large group and really made this a special dinner for us. The ambiance of the restaurant was great. If it isn't clear by now, I will be coming back!

196,Eunice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,50,44,4.0,9/21/2015,"Came here on a friends recommendation. It was a great happy hour spot. We arrived around 6pm and sat by the bar where it was quieter once it got less crowded at the beer garden we headed outside to enjoy a nice cool evening. They have two different menus one indoor and one outdoor. Indoor is a bit pricier and more sit down meals outside is more snacks and appetizers and are a bit less pricier. The beers come in huge sizes so even the smallest at $8 is very fullying. We shared the fried chicken with waffle fries ($16) which were good. I loved all the sauces that we were given to dip the fries. The cheese dip was the best. The chicken is very crispy, but a bit bland so I was happy to have some sauces to dip it in. I would recommend adding a little salt to the seasoning for the chicken and fries. I had the regular sangria and the soco sangria and preferred the taste of the regular sangria it is also $5 cheaper. I also tried the white sangria, but it was a bit too sweet for my tasting. Overall a great experience. Nice place to unwind after work and chat. They also have tv and music in the beer garden area so it's a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a pool table inside for those that prefer to do that. Overall a good experience. Our waiter Myles, was amazing. He was very attentive and knew the menu well, as well as, he was able to good give recommendations on both food and drinks.",,,
