0,Ces L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",27,108,366,4.0,10/5/2018,I don't have any complaints about this place maybe it's because I always order or grab something simple. If you're looking for a good spot to grab breakfast in the area Cook Eatery is there for you. Sure it gets crowded and it may slower the service but what other place isn't the same way? I either grab some eggs and sausage from the buffet or I order a breakfast sandwich from the cooking station. Never had a problem quality wise. I go there pretty early in the morning so I always beat the crowds.,,,
1,Chrissy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,167,414,4.0,6/21/2018,"Great spot for a quick bite to eat if you are near midtown. Lots of different foods to choose from. I always find myself in the cold/salad section. Their salads are fresh and crips and their hot buffet bar has great food selection.Its gets a big congestive during the lunch crowd, lines are usually long. Try coming early to avoid the rush",2,,1
2,Nicole B.,"Brooklyn, NY",226,300,37,2.0,6/19/2018,"Porchetta it what is says on the menu butthat is not what I got...lol  I just got a deli ham sandwich...LMAOSo nah this place is BS and no different or special then any of the other deli in the area.  Now if they actually had a real Porchetta sammy then I would weigh about 385lbs, so thanks for having a miss leading ass menu!!!!",2,1,2
3,Angel H.,"Queens, NY",87,552,540,1.0,11/5/2018,"This place is a rip-off. They have a sign regarding the buffet. It says $8.00, small after 5:30pm with the purchase of a drink, $10.00 for a large. So it gives the impression it's $8.00 with a drink. The place charged me $10.50. As the guy was charging me $10.50, he was sweet talking me, saying I should've gotten the $12.00 special. He's complimenting me, trying to make me laugh to his insincere banter, put a smile on my face. I did not respond. Looked at the receipt. No breakdown on how it came up to the $10.50 amount. I asked calmly why it was $10.50 instead of the $8.00 as advertised. He said they charged me for the drink. Which was fine, but it's deceitful and misleading because it leads to the impression it's $8.00 altogether. He tried to project by saying I ""didn't read the sign."" Oh yes I did read the sign. Once I said I was giving this place a bad review on Yelp, he turned very nasty. Do not recommend.",,,
4,Cory B.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,109,672,3.0,2/3/2018,"I think this is a fine deli and I enjoy coming here but I feel it can improve in a few areas. Compared to other eateries (which exist all across the garment district) Cook has some pros and cons.Whats nice about Cook is they have a good variety of things to choose from. You have bagels, toasts, bowls, sandwiches and more here. They use to have hot dogs as well but I think they recently removed that. Food-wise its good though nothing to rave about and I didn't particular like the hot-dogs (which probably explains why they removed it.) One of my favorite things here though is they have a wide variety of drinks on tap including Kombucha. It is nice because I can quickly come in here during lunch grab some before going back to work.Seating here leaves much to be desired. The space they have for the seating is quite small though thankfully never too crowded. In comparison Olive Branch next door has a huge seating area that is 3 times bigger then Cooks. Cooks is a little cleaner in comparison but I think the small size makes worse overall. They also have a few seats in the front window but during the winter I would not recommend eating there.A big complaint I have for this place is the front of this eatery is cold and unpleasant during cold weather. Just waiting in line for the cash registers, you get this draft of cold air hit you when someone opens the front door. Other eateries around the area have vestibules to keep the cold air out and I think Cook can't because of the construction awnings in front are blocking them. I hope some day they do install one though.Besides that I find it a bit disappointing that the one cashier station that offers the drinks on tap is never open at later times in the evening. That station is also the one with the pastries and macrons so you can't get those either. Again other eateries don't have this type of problem so I don't see why Cook has it setup like this.Again its a fine place and I do enjoy coming in but there is a lot of things they can do to improve peoples experiences here.",,,
5,Catherine T.,"New York, NY",1391,204,624,5.0,4/30/2018,I am ADDICTED to the bowls here! I seriously can't get enough. I'm always looking for healthy lunch options around work. It's always hard to find healthy and tasty lunch options until my friend told me about cook's bowls. I've never loved quinoa this much until I got introduced to this place. I've been getting the quinoa w roasted peppers onions mushrooms brócoli mango and shrimp with teriyaki sauce. Omg to die for. The bowls are huge so I eat half for lunch and half for dinner. All for $12! It's been 2 weeks and I've been eating the same thing almost everyday. I haven't been in the actual store since my friend always picks it up for me. But this guys know what they're doing.,3,1,1
6,Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",221,404,327,4.0,5/29/2018,"Stopped in for a quick sandwich before heading back to work around 10 AM and the place was spotless and workers were pushing out tons of trays of food that looked delicious and fresh. Tons of options from breakfast, salads and fruit to seafood, pasta and meats. I opted for a grilled cheese (they have a few unique creations listed but I opted to make my own) and it was great. There is seating upstairs and tons of chairs and tables right in front of the place. Buffet pricing is 10.95/LB",1,,
7,Katie C.,"New Orleans, LA",374,123,173,4.0,5/2/2018,"Great, quick takeout for lunch if you work in the Times Square/Bryant Park area. Depending on the line, you can get in and out under 10 minutes. Prices are in line with other takeout options, and they can vary based on what you order and what quantity you get. Food is largely Asian Fusion. There are many stations with offerings like rice bowls, ramen, and self-serve food options. The rice bowl with harissa sauce, chicken, and all the vegetables is my favorite. Serving sizes are very generous, and the vegetables and meat are cooked in front of you. The chefs who prepare the food tend to be very friendly. Beverages, condiments, utensils, and the like are conveniently at the front by the cash registers.I don't believe that there are seating options inside the store, but nearby Bryant Park is a good spot to eat your food if you don't want to return to the office right away.",,,
8,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",202,1241,267,3.0,12/4/2017,"New deli with ""fancy food options."" Super crowded and there isn't a proper distinction between lines. Very good albeit overpriced drink options.The Tonkotsu Ramen was a-OK in terms of broth. The meat was actually pretty good. The noodles were terrible though. A ton of gunky yellow for some reason and they didn't taste right. Made it quite unappetizing.2.6",1,1,2
9,Desislava C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,9/14/2018,"This place is the best deli in the area. Service is no different than any other deli, so i am not sure why people complain. Food is great and that's all it matters.",,,
10,Layla D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,11,12,2.0,5/14/2018,"SO Freakin Sad!!! This place is relatively new...it's all sparkly and shiny but it has the crappiest service ever. This really makes me sad. I went today to get a smoothie from their dedicated smoothie bar. I ordered, paid, waited, and was then informed that they didn't have soy milk or almond milk. I don't do cow milk so I asked for a refund. Question, How does a dedicated smoothie bar not have the base ingredients in a majority of smoothies? smhGet better management please. Cook's facility footprint is quite large with i'm sure expensive rent. Good luck surviving in Times Square!",2,1,

Updated review","Foolishly, I decided to give them another try. Mostly because I was hungry and because they were nearly empty when I walked in. The annoying expediter (bagel guy from my previous review) asked me for my order and then immediately interrupted me to tell the line cook what the previous guy ordered. RUDE.So I gave him my order: 3 egg omelet with spinach, mushrooms, onions and bacon. The price for this is listed as $6.95. By the time I say the word ""bacon"", he has already stopped looking at me and I know already he's going to forget the bacon.A minute later he asks if I want egg whites or regular eggs. People please... if I want egg whites I will ask for them. I will tell you exactly what I want when I order. Pay attention to what I order. Don't complicate things by asking if I want things that I didn't order. I say ""regular eggs"". Another minute later he asks if I want potatoes. I shrug no.When my order is assembled my omelet is placed on top a heaping pile of mushy potatoes (if you like crispy edges anywhere don't bother), and he closes up the box, writes $7.95 on it. No bacon. I immediately ask him where my bacon is and he looks surprised (I'm not). He opens the box, heaps a ridiculous pile of half cooked bacon on top, closes the box and re-writes the price as $8.95. He then explains that the price increase is for the bacon and the potatoes. I am livid since I didn't want the potatoes in the first place, didn't ask for them and he didn't tell me when he offered them to me that they would cost extra. I am also livid that he increased the price of the omelet even though ""choice of 3 vegetables and 1 meat"" was included in the price of the omelet. I've tried twice and that's it. I am done with this grill.",2,,
14,Amanda C.,"New York, NY",156,115,278,2.0,3/21/2018,"Food overall is very OK. Solid place for lunch-pretty average service/wait time. it's very close to my office so it's very convenient, prices are average depending what you get. the bibimbap is probably the best value/best tasting for lunch-a lot of my coworkers are fans. The deli area/self serve cold and hot foods are okay, overpriced. There's a lot of variety in this deli/lunch counter restaurant.",,,
15,I R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/6/2018,"Would leave zero stars if I could.  I used to go to this place everyday but the quality and service has degraded beyond the point of returning.This morning, they messed up my breakfast so after I got to work I had to go back and get my correct sandwich. When I returned to my office, I realized they had messed up AGAIN (left off the tomatoes). Not the best way to start a day. Won't be going back.",,1,
16,Nick D.,"Corona, NY",0,6,0,1.0,8/9/2018,"BACON & EGG ISSUES: When I saw this new place was opening, I decided to conduct my own experiment when I saw the management from the deli next door involved in its construction and to my surprise I was correct. This place now has the same products and even now some of the same workers as Olive Tree but that is not the sad part.Upon its grand opening, and into a few weeks of business, I notice they used, fresh hearty bacon, large eggs and thicker American cheese so every breakfast sandwich was well worth the price.Now the business has drastically reduced the size of its eggs, drastically reduced the size of its slices of cheese and most importantly it's bacon is now extremely generic and is the same poor quality as its brother Olive Tree.They store their bacon from the day before, that has already been cooked and the next day refry the bacon over and over that when it gets to your sandwich it looks like Bacos chips. I'm disappointed they have perpetrated such fraud and deception upon the public but beware that this place is now basically a clone of Olive tree except for some small items and inflated prices.Best fresh, and made daily bacon, is at the breakfast truck on the corner of 39th and Broadway next to the Chase Bank.",,,
17,Jack K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/13/2018,"I've been eating at Cook Eatery at least once a week, usually twice, since they opened a few months ago. I will soon stop altogether if there's no change in management. The menu has a fair variety and the ingredients are, for the most part, decent quality for the price. That being said, the service has been on a steady decline from the beginning and will soon hit rock bottom.I can't speak for the other line cooks, but the ones who serve at the burger and sandwich stations provide horrible service. They take more orders than they can handle and some don't speak English too well, which results in their frequently getting the order wrong. Because they're busy starting orders before completing the ones they've taken, your food may be left on the grill for too long and end up drier than you'd like, if not a little burnt. Fries and onion rings are often over fried, having been left in the deep fryer for too long. After lunch rush hours, line cooks get lazy and work incredibly slowly.In addition to getting orders wrong, there's also no consistency in the quantity of food you get. I generally order the same 2 or 3 items from the menu. Sometimes you get twice the ingredients in your order, sometimes you get half as much.Food at the stations is reasonably priced, assuming you order off the menu and they don't get the order wrong. I've been charged 3 different prices ($5.95, $6.95, and $7.95) for the same custom order I've made. I ask for 2 ingredients, considerably fewer than the items off their menu, and they charge me full menu price. This was all within a 10 day time frame, so it's not a price update, just inconsistency depending on whichever line cook wraps your food and prices it.Cleanliness is just on the cusp of becoming unacceptable. Their doors are left open during warmer weather, so flies come in and swarm the trash in the small eating area upstairs.If Cook Eatery doesn't make radical changes, I'd be glad to see them close.",,,
18,John H.,"New York, NY",39,201,222,2.0,10/20/2017,"This is a new deli that recently opened up downstairs and is now a direct competitor to Olive Tree next door. My office is upstairs so I was very excited to discover another option to Olive Tree, which I'm not huge fan of for numerous reasons that I won't get into here. The nice thing about this place is that it's clean (because it's new). The food is decent, not good, not bad -- just average. But, the prices are on the higher side. For example, the omelettes cost $1 more than next door. And if you want butter and jelly on your toast, then that's an additional $2.50 (what???). To compare, it comes with the platter next door. So you will pay $3.50 more for the same thing! These types of business practices (i.e., charging for things that others do not charge for) are a huge turnoff and the reason why I won't go here often. Also, one time I ordered a breakfast burrito at the grill and he handed me a pre-made one that they put out for people on-the-go instead of making me a fresh one. If I wanted a pre-made burrito, I would have picked it up myself instead of wasting my time waiting in line at the made-to-order grill. The only other plus about this place is that it's quick, but that's because it's not really busy, more than anything else.Frame (one block over) has significantly more options and is a very easy choice on a non-rainy day if I can spare the extra 10-15 mins during lunch.",5,,1

No complaints from this place at all. It's clean, quick, stocked to the 10th degree with awesome treats, fresh sushi (saw the guy literally making it and placing it in the trays for the shelf), etc. Loved the service, coffee is great (which is mandatory in NYC), and that's kind of it. I want to try the Ramen bar because the guy this AM was hand-mixing rice with kimchi. ::drooling::",,,
20,Cat C.,"Manhattan, NY",62,116,46,1.0,11/7/2017,Terribly disorganized. No one can figure out where one line starts and one line ends.Service is slow and food is nothing great. I've been to this place twice and the first time I waited forever to order a bowl which turned out to be mediocre. The second time here I gave up trying to order since no one was even paying attention to the customers waiting even though the place was pretty empty. There are way too many other restaurants in this area for me to waste my time here. Never again.,2,,
21,Ben C.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,17,3,1.0,3/21/2018,"I work in the building upstairs and was very excited to see this place open. I was shocked when I went to eat there a few weeks ago and found Cook was  closed for health code violations.

25,Kelly M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/19/2018,"Was excited when I saw the concept of all the stations (teriyaki, ramen, burgers, etc.) in this very designed, clean deli.

Completely bizarre and bullshit all at once. Obviously I'm never going there again.",,,
26,Igor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,142,0,2.0,3/16/2018,This place is just bad. It is overpriced and def not worth it. There isnt anything great on that huge menu and the buffet is just not good. I would avoid this place.,,,
27,Mo M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/8/2017,"If i could give this place 0 stars, I would. Every day the cooks say their grill is closed until ___ and every day it's a new time. One day, they'll say they don't make hot food until 3 pm. The next day it's 4, then later that same day it's 5 pm. The next day at 5 pm, they'll say it's open at 6 pm. The deli always get the orders wrong or forget something, and the place is just overpriced for basically nothing. Save yourself the frustration of a completely unpredictable and seemingly never open grill, and walk two blocks to the corner of 38th on 6th ave to Bryant Market for much better food and service at a better price. This place will just confuse you.",3,1,1
28,Megan S.,"New York, NY",128,11,3,1.0,6/21/2018,"So I've been in more than a few times and today was the last straw. Every time I've ordered a menu item (eg: this morning when I ordered a 6.95 omelet and kept it below the max ingredients to be sure not have an extra charge) they over charge me... I saw written on the box in sharpie a price 7.45 before tax for a menu item omelette where the price was clearly written to be 6.95 before tax. I told the cashier who flippantly told me to tell the deli chef. Mind you, this is during the morning rush when no one has the kind of time to wait in line again to speak to the chef. After a couple of inquiries at my office I had found that my co workers had also been overcharged several times with similar responses. While it may seem minor, this is a constant occurrence and pennies add up to dollars. If you choose to eat here (I wouldn't recommend the food either since there are a ton of other better choices on the same block and street) just be aware of what you're being charged.",,,
