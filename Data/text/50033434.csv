2,Martina D.,"Manhattan, NY",519,223,422,3.0,12/30/2017,"Ok. So my friend found a deal for this place, which was different than other deals found in the passed... This place is across the street from a bed bath and beyond, and I guess as a promotional idea, Wing Bistro decided if you show a receipt from a bed bath and beyond, you get a free glass of wine. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be one glass, or one glass each. She got there before I did and just told the guy at the front I had the receipt and I never even ended up having to show him. Anyway, the place itself is a hole in the wall and I had a little difficulty finding it and passed by it a couple times until I started really looking at the building numbers. It's a very skinny design on the inside, with the cash register at the very front, then the bar, and then a small section with some high top seats in the back. The menu was limited but pretty standard. We both got a ""taco salad"", which basically is like the inside of a taco without the shell. Perfect. Lots of grilled chicken, shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, some random tortilla chips, a couple tomatoes.... and although I ordered a dressing on the side, I ended up using the sour cream they provided (also on the side). For a salad in a hole in the wall kind of place I was super pleased and ate the whole thing, even though salads are not my favorite meal. Aside from the place itself, where the 3 stars really comes in is from the two sides we ordered. We got waffle fries and mozzarella sticks. I have no problem giving a place that's kind of grungy 4 or even 5 stars... but when the waffle fries are just ""good"" and mozzarella sticks are ""meh"", there's a problem. They should be as good if not better than diner food, also taking into consideration how small the menu is. The service was good... food got there quickly and the empty plates were taken away promptly. We paid at the front so there was almost no interaction with the waitress. Given that this place is nowhere near where I live, and the food and atmosphere weren't above average, I don't think I'll come back. Taco salad was pretty good though. If I lived a block away I'd definitely order it from seamless.",7,2,7

Waited about 15 to 20 minutes for the meal, even though the place was near empty with only one other person there. When they came out I was really disappointed to see that the fish and shrimp tacos were just pieces of fried fish and fried shrimp. The quality was really bad and the fish and shrimp had a kind of harder texture than they should have, they kind of seemed like they were pre-packaged from Costco and we're just heated in the back in the deep fryer. I could have paid less money for better quality tacos in my own neighborhood.",,,1

The delivery came earlier than expected, which is always a plus.  The boneless wings were a bit too dry for me, but the cheese fries and onion rings were so crispy and crunchy, which was exactly what my friend and I wanted.  However, this place is a bit stingy with napkins since they only gave us like two pieces.  Good thing we had extra napkins at that time.",,1,

This was lunch for 3 people and it cost $56.70 with tax and 15% tip. I was disappointed by the food and the cost/value. The wings were suppose to have ""hot sauce"" on them but it was a dry rub and it was mild not spicy. The order of waffle fries was over-priced relative to the amount of fries.

The boneless wings were SO hard and dry, I had to throw away the rest. My order came with a bunch of others, so not sure if that was the problem.

Updated review","My friends and I decided on this restaurant almost primarily because the delivery window was less than 40 minutes (seamless later informed us at the restaurant itself gets to determine what the delivery window time is). Upon completing our order our delivery window jumped from 40 minutes or less to an hour and a half. A little annoyed but still eager to receive the order we decided to wait it out. When the food hadn't showed up 10 minutes past the hour-and-a-half updated delivery window I called and spoke to the manager Michael. He was incredibly rude and difficult to deal with. He promised me my food would arrive in 20 minutes. Bringing our delivery time to 2 hours. When the food hadn't showed up another 30 minutes later I called and he promised that it would be there in the next 5 minutes. Finally the food showed up TWO AND HALF HOURS after my order. Starving, we accept the food and ask for a discount. The best he could do was $5 off a $50 tab (including a 20% tip to the very nice delivery guy). The food was warm but not worth it. Mediocre at best. Order Anywhere But Here",1,,

Updated review","Love this place.  They have so many different options.  The wings are amazing.  So many different sauces to choose from.  Honey BBQ is my favorite.  Also really enjoyed the bacon cheeseburger which came with crispy fries.  There is also a full bar coming in September which should be awesome. Beer, wings and football. Can't wait.",,,
26,Cat C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,21,0,4.0,3/5/2018,"Tasty wings for takeout and a nice selection to choose from. They were all quite tasty, especially the spicy ones. However, if you have any care for the length of your life, best keep the take out down to once a year!",,,
27,Franccesca M.,"Bronx, NY",16,25,40,4.0,7/17/2015,"I found this place by mistake. I was getting coffee in the AM in the area. I rarely go that way. I look across the street and see Wing Bistro. I had been looking for a GOOD wing spot for a little while. The ""other"" place kept coming up.I looked them up online. The system Beyond Menu didn't really call my attention. I almost didn't order because of it. But I went ahead because I REALLY wanted to try their wings. I ordered traditional 6 piece wings with sweet chili sauce and a side of fries.The Fries: Were AWESOME. An inviting surprise when I bit into the fries, they were sprinkled with oregano. They weren't skimpy nor stale. They were nice size good ole fashion French Fries. Going to try the sweet potato fries next time. Yeess!The wings: Were FANTABULISTIC (not a word I promise.) They had just the right amount of chili sauce on them, not drowned in goo. The spice of the chili was just right (a pinch more wouldn't hurt.) They were juicy and plump, not dry like other places. The celery and carrots sticks weren't soggy either. Crisp and fresh.I will definitely go back. Ordering online is very easy and the pick up (if you chose to walk that way) is quick and painless. That's what I did. I ordered and picked it up to eat at my desk. Yay work life. There are tables to sit and eat. The décor is nice. Looks like it would be a good hangout............ with some drinks :)Thank you Wing Bistro! See you soon :)",2,2,1
28,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",161,340,2193,3.0,6/8/2015,"Good wings, not the best I've had in this area (pubs that don't deliver) but better than Atomic wings around the corner.. Ordered delivery 12 hot buffalo style, in my opinion was more like a medium heat (which they do not offer). Nice and meaty but my order had mostly the ""drumsticks"" and I actually prefer the wing portion with the double bones. I think they flour coat them prior to frying, they were not very crispy probably cause they steamed up in container on the way and there was a ton of sauce on the bottom - if you like really wet wings you'll be ok with this, I prefer a crisper drier but still spicy wing). They did pay attention to my request for celery only ;) Have also had veggie burger, chicken taco salad, and jalapeño poppers.. all good, nothing exceptional.",4,,2
29,Julie F.,"Manhattan, NY",17,106,105,5.0,6/15/2015,"I sometimes buy light meals for my mom's dialysis staff to thank them for how wonderful they are - and of all my pizza/bagel/donut/wings treats, this was the one that I will be repeating again and again. The variety made it easy to please everyone, and the garlic parmesan was the clear favorite. I was beyond delighted to see their reaction - everyone seemed very happy. I had to try them after the rave reviews. I'm glad I did. Yes, the garlic parmesan was GREAT. But for me, the mango habanero was a clear favorite. The spicy buffalo was great, too. If you're a hothead, as I am, it is likely you will feel their ""very spicy"" is more like ""medium spicy"", and the habanero was clearly secondary to the mango (I tend to think anything with habanero should BURN), but - this is important, if you know me - the quality and overall taste warrant a compromise on the spice. I believe their default side sauce is ranch, so next time (and there are going to be many), I will specifically ask for blue cheese. Speaking of asking, these guys actually read the comment section and adjust accordingly. Which is far more rare than one may think. If you need lots of celery/carrots, order extra. Was sufficient for me, but they use a light hand. The vegetables are, however, perfectly fresh and crisp (as opposed to the sad ones at Atomic) - they won't send you brown celery. They're a bit of a distance from me, so I pray they'll not narrow the delivery range. These wings ARE good enough to pick up, but my current situation would make it very difficult - if at all possible. Also not lost on me - their eco-friendly packaging. I'm not necessarily a tree-hugger and a very clear carnivoir (I try not to dwell on cute piggies when I overdose on bacon), but whenever someone finds ways to cut waste - extra kudos. So there are a few plusses you should add to the five stars given. Delivery was reasonably fast, and very neat and smart. I'm one of those people who delight in neat deliveries. This may very likely be the start of a beautiful relationship. I love wings. I'll test their cod and update - if their fish and chips are anywhere near their wings, and with their other options, I may very well order from here twice out of three times. Keep it up, guys. You ROCK!!!!",1,1,2
30,Hye In L.,"New York, NY",59,8,6,5.0,10/16/2016,"Breaking my yelp review virginity with this place. I've ordered via eat24 about five times. Wing bistro always delivered hot crispy wings and waffle fries in time, within 30 minutes, and today it was 15! (I do live within ten blocks of the place btw)Mango habanero is the best. Seriously. Garlic parm is great. 'Hot' is a vinegary spicy thing that made my eyes and nose run the moment I opened the box. Probably going to order each dressing in the next year.

43,S W.,"Manhattan, NY",21,77,18,4.0,4/13/2015,"Showed up for what I think was the grand opening, or maybe the grand opening week. I was walking by to pick something up and I saw a wing special, so I went in.  I'm not a huge fan of wet wings, and that's what they had along with many other things to try.  So tried the popcorn shrimp and fries. The shrimp was well prepared and crispy, the fries were adequately fried but nothing special.  The tartar sauce was decent.  If you have an urge for wings or fried food this is a decent place to try.  The store front is long and narrow and almost seems like wasted revenue generated space.  But they just opened up, so I assume in time things may fill up, or I hope they do.  The interior decoration is nothing special.  Brick wall,  wood paneling, painted walls, some distressed tables and some oddly picked flowers and plants that are not cohesive at all.  This is defly not a place to bring a date, or fine dining in anyway, but it's a great place to buy some food if you want to watch a game of hang out with friends.  They didn't seem to have any liquor, but I also didn't ask.  TWhen I walked in they were playing house and the baseball game.  Felt like I was in some place in Long Island or Staten Island.  And there is nothing wrong with that, added diversity to the area. They also have a sink to wash your hands which is a nice touch, but it grab extra revenue from the floor, but maybe they're trying to cater to their niche. I'd try to the place once and give it a shot.  Hope they are open late night, cause this is the type of food I eat after a good night of drinking.  Enjoy",,,

The chicken was cooked to perfection and the avocado was fresh. I ate it all in less than 5 minutes. Although I was already full, I did order waffle fries. The couple next to me was apparently enjoying an order of the waffle fries and I couldn't resist ordering for myself too. Even though, the calories were already piling up and should have stopped eating half way, I ate everything- this is how tasty these were. While eating, I noticed that the place offers tons of food options- wraps, sandwiches, chicken tenders, wings, etc.Next time I am in the area (61st and 1st avenue) I will come to try their wings. After all, they are called ""Wing Bistro"", and if the food I ate was amazing, logically their Wings should be out-of-this world.",1,,

50,Aaron S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/31/2017,"Excellent food. A bit pricey but if your feeling wings during a sports game.. or just in life, I would come here. I would highly recommend the chicken taco salad as well.",,,
51,Eliza A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/29/2016,"Giving this place one star because of lack of good customer service and the really tiny boneless wings which look more like popcorn chicken. Called to place the order and received a very brushed off phone manner from the person answering calls and they stated that I had to hurry up since their phones were busy (which I understand but it could have been addressed in a different tone), yet I was barely starting to place the order. The order took over an hour to arrive which I understand that restaurants may become extremely busy but when calling to check in don't argue with the customer, especially when the customer was only checking in about the order.",1,,1
52,Brat T.,"New York, NY",0,241,1,4.0,10/26/2015,"Great char grilled burgers! Juicy and well cooked with a nice char on the outside. The bacon burger could have had a little more bacon and the fries were soggy and oily but the burger was one of the best I've had in a long time.  On the outside it looks like a take out place but when I walked in I was shocked to hear light instrumental music, casual but clean seating and almost thought it offered table service.  The friendly guy behind the counter took our order and brought us our food right to the table so I guess in some ways it does offer table service!  The chicken quesadilla was overly salted and garlicky but decent but it's the burger that was impressive.",,,
53,Diana S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/6/2015,"AWFUL SERVICE!!!!! I ordered some food for delivery at work and waited 2 HOURS!!!The delivery man called about 3 times and then had the nerve to then tell me that i gave him the wrong address after i specifically told them where i was located !!! Unfortunately, i do not have an unlimited lunch hour and when i called to explain this, the man on the phone told me my food would be in shortly. 15 minutes later, i called back and it turns out he had CANCELLED the order!!! Without even notifying me. HORRIBLE! I do not know what the place is like when you are physically go to eat there, but the delivery sucks! A 2 HOUR wait, and the unprofessionalism of the staff overshadow however delicious the food might have been if i had been able to taste it.Unfortunately, that's one menu that is now in the trash.",,,
54,Rachael S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,1,1.0,9/11/2016,"Seriously?! I placed an order on seamless at 1:30 and it said my food would come between 2:25 and 2:35... It's is now 2:53 and I was just told my order will be another 15-20 minutes. No apologizes or anything.. Just excuses. I get that it's football Sunday, but that doesn't give them the right to lie about delivery times by an hour and then not even apologize for the delay.",,,
55,Trevin S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",594,1,0,1.0,9/30/2016,"Don't ever order from this place on seamless...2 hours will go by, you will call, they will pretend to help you and then hang up, and then they will never answer the phone again. This just happened to me...and I'm livid, because I sat here for 2 hours believing I was getting food. Stupid fucking restaurant!",,,
56,Sara H.,"Burleson, TX",1,13,6,3.0,9/26/2015,"Ordered boneless wings & salad. Sauce was good. I prefer breaded wings, they weren't. The salad was yummy. They didn't have beer ""yet"":(",,,
57,Nadia D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,9/11/2016,"This place is completely incompetent in the delivery department. Placed an order at 1:15 and was told it would take a half hour. Then the wait time was increased to one hour. Then after waiting an hour and 15 minutes, we called to check on the order and it was going to be an additional ""15 minutes."" The person who answered the phone was so nasty and said this is what we should expect on a Sunday during football season and if we don't want to wait, they'd be happy to cancel our order. Business lost forever.",,,
58,Anthony C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,0,5.0,4/20/2015,Great food!! Great quality!! Great prices!!Wings destroys atomic wings. Burgers are allot better most places in the area especially chirping chicken and ritz diner. I tried Salads nachos fries and its all very good..Just go!!,,,
59,Anthony D.,"Bronx, NY",1,59,19,4.0,4/23/2015,"Good wings -- plump, tasty, spicy -- maybe too plump ... started thinking about GMO factory chickens at some point. But they tasted good. Generous portion of fries. Clean and comfortable seating area. Nothing fancy, but works pretty well for a quick bite. Menu includes Mexican and burgers, which I haven't tried. A friend I ate with liked their chicken wrap sandwich and onion rings.Unlike another reviewer, however, I didn't like the music -- thumping techno-trance house music or whatever. Not conducive to digesting my weekday lunch. Still, if they keep up the quality of the food, I'll be back at some point.",,,
60,Chris H.,"New York, NY",0,25,0,3.0,1/2/2016,"I love the mozzarella sticks and the wings are good. However, it loses two stars based on the delivery. I have tried this place several times and almost every time with the exception of once the food arrives cold. It may be worth it though if you can stop in and get the food while it is hot.",,,
61,Chris G.,"East Meadow, NY",0,1,0,2.0,11/15/2015,"Ordered the boneless wings with the ""spicy bbq"" sauce. The portion size is nice and the chicken isn't all that bad either, but the reason for the 2 stars is because the sauce had no flavor. It took an hour to order and maybe the wings got watered down by all the condensation in the box but they were flavorless. Haven't tried any other flavors but wouldn't be my go to for wings.",,,
62,Chris K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,27,0,5.0,4/13/2015,"Meaty wings, multiple well-executed flavors, waffle fries and fresh salads...what else do you need?",,,
