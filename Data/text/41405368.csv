0,Zach A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",118,16,0.0,5.0,10/14/2018,"As a native buffalonian, I am very picky about the wings that I eat. I can confidently state that Dylan murphys has a good chicken wing. Go on Wednesday and they are only 50 centsOn sundays, they tend to have beer specials and it's only 15 for a pitcher.Great place",,,
1,Kristie T.,"New York, NY",0,33,6,4.0,8/4/2018,"I was waiting to review until I ate here more than once. I give Dylan Murphy's 4 stars based on the context of it being a neighborhood bar. It achieves the 4 stars that you'd expect for that. Deals: they have awesome deals. Monday: beer and burger for I believe $12. Tuesday I think is $5 appetizers with purchase of a drink. Wednesday 50 cent wings. Thursday $2 tacos. Happy hour 12-7 with $3 miller high life bottles, $4 bud light draft, and specials on other beers and well liquors. Service: bartenders are always friendly. They're the type that want to get to know the people in their neighborhood. Food/drink: tater tots are great! Cheeseburger ($13) was also pretty good. Bun ended up getting soggy, but flavor was there. Burgers/sandwiches come with a side of onion rings, tots, or fries. Buffalo wings are great - great flavor and great crisp. Buffalo tenders were subpar, they tasted like they were frozen and thrown in the deep fryer. Probably wouldn't order those again. $2 tacos were exactly what you'd expect for $2 tacos - small, lacking good flavor, but then again they're $2. Why are you ordering $2 tacos if that's not what you expect? My friends have also enjoyed the chicken sandwich and turkey clubs. Tap beers have good taste, unlike other bars in the area. My friends were happy with their well drinks as well. Atmosphere: typical neighborhood Irish pub. A lot of great beer and sports memorabilia on the walls that are cool to look at. Free WiFi. Good music. Tvs. Overall, what you're looking for in a spot like this.",,,

The atmosphere is great for watching games, I've been here for football games as well as soccer games, and the drinks and food are great. If you come in later in the night and it's packed, check out the downstairs area which also has a bar and is usually a bit less crowded. I've had their crispy chicken sandwich,  which is fantastic!! It's quite large and the chicken on it is perfect! Their fries are perfectly crispy and delicious. I also recommend their wings! Being from buffalo, I am very picky about my wings and these are by far the best you can get in the city that come close to the real deal! Definitely check this place out next time you're looking for a place to watch a sports game!",1,,

8,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2144,1291,3209,4.0,11/12/2017,"I was here last night as part of a private party in their downstairs area.  Not being a huge fan of pubs/sports bars, I was a bit skeptical before coming here, but left pleasantly surprised.The drinks here are cheap and the service is top notch.  Food was also surprisngly also very good, for the most part.  Atmosphere-wise, it's just like any other pub.  Obviously my experience was a little different given it was a giant private party where everyone knew each other, but noise-level vs music/tv was manageable and I didn't have to scream at the top of my lungs.Our bartender, Stephanie, was amazing.  She was super cool, very friendly, chatty, and we got to know her a little bit throughout the night.  It's not often I make conversation with bartenders, but she was so approachable, it was natural.  She was always available for whatever we needed and more than accommodating to a room full of increasingly drunken people.  Every bar needs a Stephanie!As for food, I have to say, I haven't had traditional buffalo wings in a while and these ones are the best in recent memory.  Just enough sauce, crispy, and just the right amount of heat.  I really enjoyed these... maybe a bit too much.  The mozzarella sticks were also so good that we probably ordered 4 of them.  The nachos were a bit too greasy and basic for my liking, but still edible.  Didn't get to try the quesadillas since they always disappeared before I got to them.Basic pub in the UES with an amazing bartender and really, really good hot wings.  I'm a fan.",2,2,3
9,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,615,558,5.0,1/11/2018,"I came for a quick bite on a Saturday after a nearby workout class and ended up staying for like three hours!!! As a neighborhood bar, this place is as good as it gets - decent pub and brunch food and a nice array of beers&liquors. The bartender, Steph, was really nice, funny, and outgoing. She actually started conversations with the patrons of the bar, rather than pouring drinks and randomly checking on folks. Even the owner was cool. I checked into Dylan Murphy's on Yelp and noticed that you and three friends get a free shot with the check in. I did not inquire about the deal since I was eating/drinking solo (in my defense I planned to have one beer with my breakfast) ; and the owner asked Steph to give me shot. So what if it was only 11 am, it's 5 pm somewhere. Although I do not really go to the UES too much these days, I probably will visit again after that cardio class. I worked on the UES for over six years, and it is a shame that I just discovered this Dylan Murphy's.",,,
10,James F.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",6,37,108,4.0,5/17/2018,"Good place for what it is - an Irish/American bar with a small pub feel. Very tiny inside, but there are a few booths and a bar. Good bar food that is ready pretty quickly. We went all apps with sliders, wings and nachos. The nachos and wings were good, the sliders left a bit to be desired but it is pretty reasonable for the cost, location and time. I would recommend stopping in for a pint and a quick bite to eat.",,,
11,Denay W.,"New York, NY",308,226,736,4.0,10/22/2017,"Had plans with friends to bar hop on the UES starting with Dylan Murphy's - we ended up having so much fun here that we spent our entire evening at the bar because we didn't want to leave! The bar has an Irish pub type of look and feel to it but not in a cheap looking way. They have a good amount of seating, so it's not too hard to snag yourself somewhere to sit. If you're wanting to catch a game, they have a ton of TVs so it's a convenient spot for that.The bartenders working when we came in on a Saturday night were incredibly friendly and super quick. Every time I approached the bar, they served me within a minute or two despite being pretty busy. They offered a good selection of beers at great prices, which makes it an affordable bar to go to for a casual night out. Definitely plan on coming back soon and maybe trying out some of the food on the menu.",,,
12,Brandon E.,"Manhattan, NY",75,3,2,5.0,5/9/2018,"Fantastic food, specifically the delicious wings (small and crispy[NOT breaded]), they also have glorious classic steak fries as well as Pigs in a Blanket!!!!which are scrumptious :)Further more the service is more than great.  I had the pleasure of sitting with the booze  while Sarah was tending bar.  My experience was so relaxing and pleasant I felt it necessary to specifically mention her fun light attitude while maintaining the highest level of professionalism, prompt but polite service and personable and warm demeanor.I would give both Sarah and this establishment 6 stars if I could!",,,
13,Mark F.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",1,99,0,4.0,10/24/2018,"So I had a long schlep around the Met and there was this sign that said 'Mad River Bar - 5 minutes' or something. Well that was a lie and when I got to the corner they said it was going to be at and was going to go in there and moan about their sign and I couldn't see it but then, oh, this place.So I duck into here, Saturday afternoon, busy enough, cool bar staff (the bar woman from Oranmore was fun), nice beers. I had the chicken tenders and they were yummy if maybe above the price I would usually be happy to pay. Cheery place. It would have made it for the five stars but the prices are steep-ish, I thought anyway, Heck, go to their website and judge for yourself. Tell you what though, they advertise 50 cent wings on Wednesday nights. Now that would get me in there!",,,
14,Trevor M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,176,260,4.0,8/9/2017,"Dylan Murphey's is exactly what you want if you're looking for the familiarity and ambiance of a dive bar with the integrity of a real establishment. This bar has become my go-to place for a casual drink, and I've lost count of how many times I've been there or how many friends I've brought in for a drink. The waitresses are always friendly, there's never a wait for table, the music is good, and the bartenders are extremely social, even for NYC. I've had half the menu at this point and recommend the buffalo chicken salad, pot pies, burgers, and all their finger food. However, I strongly recommend their chicken wings, and they are definitely the closet wings that I've had to back home in Western NY (get blue cheese, not ranch!). I will probably be back within the week. Cheers!",,,
15,Chris S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",154,245,9,3.0,1/4/2018,"Typical Manhattan Irish pub - good bears on tap, happy hour specials, and okay/bad mixed liquor drinks.   The prices for HH are pretty great if you are a beer fan.   I do not live in the hood, but it seems like a local haunt for upper east siders.    Didn't try any of the good, but would try it next time for sure!Friendly bartenders.",,,

17,Shaa M.,"Brooklyn, NY",272,13,24,2.0,4/24/2018,"Came in on a Tuesday caught by a $5 appetizer sign .. the bar was full. I was greeted by the bartender with a menu,which I had to reach between bar patrons for . Sat down at the bar table, decided on ""baked Mac & cheese""; which I had to go back to the bar to order. My meal arrived in under 15 minutes. What striked me hardest was that it wasn't baked ; and the ratio of cheese to noodles was 2:1 . The bartender Stephanie was excellent doubling as a server cleaning up after bar tables and controlling the whole bar . I'd come back with my friends as long as they put the Mac in the oven or the broiler",1,,

21,Mini K.,"New York, NY",190,128,307,5.0,7/14/2017,"There's no mistaking why this place routinely has high reviews - you'd struggle to find a more friendly bunch of staff anywhere in the city! This place has something going on nearly everyday, with Monday Night Trivia being my favourite - part of the GeeksWhoDrinks events. You also have Taco Tuesdays and may other offers on a daily basis. The jovial atmosphere and great playlist are accompanied by a decent beer selection and some surprisingly delicious bar food. Have the Bangers & Mash or the Shepherd's Pie, both are truly awesome and suit the ambience perfectly. If you're looking for a friendly neighborhood bar on the UES, you might want to check this one out first.",1,,

The bartenders are super personable, and always leave me with a great experience. The food is great (You'd never expect it!) and the drinks are well poured. Definitely bring your crew here, you'll have a great time without a doubt. Also sidenote on some of the negative jukebox reviews I'm seeing here: Bartenders reserve the right to skip songs based on the mood of the bar. It keeps people going, and keeps everyone in the mood. The bartenders here also give your money back if they happen to skip a song that isn't appropriate.",6,,1

40,The H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,49,4,1.0,6/15/2018,"I love this bar, and the workers here.  I have spent quite a bit of time and money here over the years.  About a year ago, the place was refurbished, including the bar stools.  The stools were not fixed properly, probably the fault of a bad carpenter, and at least half of them had wood screws sticking up from the bottom of the seat.  A number of times, I caught my pants on the screws, causing damage to my pants.  My skin even got scratched a couple of times.  To address the situation in the short term, the owner took cardboard coasters and taped them over the screws on the defective chairs.  This triage approach didn't solve the issue, it just masked it and kicked the can down the road...  it took many weeks if not months for the owner to address the chairs with a permanent fix (or so I thought).  In the meantime, I would always run my hand over the stools to make sure I wasn't sitting in a damaged seat.This brings us to yesterday, probably a year after the renovation.  Sad to report, there are still chairs with nails sticking up.  I was enjoying drinks after work, and wearing a very expensive, custom suit.  And guess what?  When I got up, my suit pants caught on the stool and they tore.  The rip wasn't huge, but enough to ruin the integrity of my garment.  My wife actually laughed at me and vaguely hinted it was my fault for wearing a fancy suit to a pub.  That may be true, but I was on my way home after work, and I guess I let me guard down.  I thought they had fixed all the chairs by now.I give this pub 1 star for not caring enough about the health, safety and well being of their customers.  This might sound harsh, but how else can one interpret the owner continuing to allow his patrons to sit on chairs with screws sticking up at their bums and thighs?  I can't say I know what it's like to own a bar, and I am sure it's not easy to conduct business in Manhattan.  But it's been over a year, and this bar does well between its loyal patrons and folks who stop in from time to time.  I think this is a rather unfortunate case of cutting corners.I left my phone number with the bartender if the owner wants to speak with me.  But I will boycott the establishment until the bar stools are fixed and I get an apology.  I don't think this is a lot to ask.(To the owner: It's true the bartender did buy me one Bud Light which costs $6 after I complained.  But I probably tipped her 20 dollars leading up to that moment.  My suit cost a heck of a lot more, and there are still many damaged chairs there with cardboard over the nails...it's not just one chair.  You can call me to discuss.  D has my number.)",,1,

Great Irish pub to grab a few drinks with friends whether it is late at night like what me and my friends do, to hang out after work, or to watch a game. The waitstaff is hilarious and very friendly.Dylan Murphy's also has a small bar downstairs that you can rent out for a party. My friends have rented it out one time and I highly recommend it. You get your own bartender and just have to reach a certain price minimum between the people in your party.

61,Rob S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,264,92,4.0,5/8/2016,"I have been here a number of times in the last few years.  Only a complete block-head would write that this place is 100% bridge and tunnel people.The crowd is mostly New Yorkers and locals for the most part.  It has a real, ""Neighborhood Bar Feel.""They have a decent beer selection for an Irish Pub.  Note the words, ""Irish Pub.""  Hipsters go back to Brooklyn where you belong if you want, ""Craft Beers,"" or warm piss in a can.Food is very good for Pub Grub, standard Burgers, Fish n' Chips, Bangers and Mash etc.  I would give the wings a B+ as they are pretty juicy for the most part.  Not from skinny chickens as is the case at many places.Nice homey feel.  Open at 12 for a Guinness, lunch and a read of the newspaper.  People leave you alone, nobody hassles you.  Good for a late night soak as well.  The bartenders are very helpful if you end up in your cups.N.B. - Check in on Yelp for complementary shots.",2,,
62,Russell M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/22/2017,This place racially profiled my friend who is African American. We went to this bar after the packer vs falcons game.  After getting into the bar and getting a drink my friend was told by a cocktail waitress that she couldn't stay there even though she was waiting for me to buy a drink.   More to the story but blatant racism. Never patronize this place.,3,,
63,Chelsea V.,"Saint Paul, MN",73,5,0,5.0,12/11/2017,The food is good but everyone should come and hang out with Sarah. She's the best bartender I've ever met. So kind and personable.,,,
64,Joe Z.,"New York, NY",28,10,1,2.0,8/11/2017,"I paid money to play a song on the jukebox, and the bartender skipped it because he didn't like it. I think his name was Ethan or something. The waitress was amazing though. Five stars for her. (Her name was Diadra and is the only reason I didn't rate this place one star)",1,,
65,Alex N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",24,1,0,5.0,11/26/2017,Love this place. A proper local spot. The bar staff (Chris and Steph) are great craic and the Irish breakfast is some stunning grub.,,,
66,William T.,"Beasley, TX",2,11,2,5.0,8/9/2016,"This is why Irish bars are the most fun places to go anywhere in the world! The bartenders engage you immediately, learn your name, and remember it the next day. If you want your own local bar in NYC when you are visiting, two visits here and it feels like you are a local. Came here day one met Pixie, Dierdre, Chris and Rich. Seem like best friends now.",,,
67,Jules S.,"New York, NY",40,8,2,5.0,1/27/2017,"This was an amazing find. Food was awesome, like surprisingly tasty. Our group had the bangers and mash, burger and shepherds pie.  Banging! Bartenders really cool. Definitely coming back here.",1,,
68,Sarah D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,1,5.0,8/11/2017,I have not been at a bar that has been so friendly before. When they meet you for the first time they ask you your name then actually remember it!

69,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,3.0,4/16/2016,"The service was very good, attentive, casual, fun. The beer selection was okay, Brooklyn Seasonal, a couple fake craft beers (like Shock Top)... but nothing super special. Likewise, the food was typical bar food. Nachos, sliders, etc. passable, but not special. The manager held us a table (it's a small space), and the entire staff was great to us. Come for the atmosphere and the people. The food and beer you can get a lot of places. --Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers, a different bar every week.",,,
70,Daniel S.,"Somerville, MA",12,1,0,5.0,2/5/2017,"A great bar with friendly patrons and friendlier staff. Always a warm crowd here with good drinks, decent food, and an awesome playlist. Monday trivia and taco Tuesdays are a must.",,,

74,Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",272,331,315,2.0,12/18/2014,5 stars if you're a Steeler's fan. For the rest of us- meh. Average menu. Average beers on tap. Average prices. Average everything. But Steeler's fans should live here. I WISH my team had a bar like this! Good for them finding a thing and sticking with it. Another high note -- their bottle list looked impressive! Lots of craft beers!,,,

82,Paul G.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",4,19,6,1.0,8/8/2016,"Pretty cramped, and I would review the food or drink but I was unable to get any. I waited around for 45 minutes and got the runaround before I had to leave. Didn't look like anything special.",1,,
83,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,3.0,10/4/2011,"Following a Museum Mile Poetry Crawl, our intimate party of three ventured to commemorate the festivities with drinks and dinner at Dylan Murphy's.  Burgers for all (two Dylan Murphy's, and one Turkey burger) at $6.95 were plentiful for the hungry and weary to dispel darkness.  Dylan Murphy's to my D-Lite's disappointment do not carry Hoegaarden Spéciale, a full-bodied rich Belgian style wheat beer.  Yet with two guys and one girl, I was nearly reaching enlightenment as I finally do not have to share for my wish became a reality!!Service was without life as the waiter has no facial expression of dysthemia, which as the better person I kill her with sprightly lively joy of smiles.  The waitress glared at me as if there were something wrong with me for her response!!  Does it kill one to smile sincerely to patrons after placing their order, who is employed in the hospitality and customer service environment??  I've been in the customer service industry far too long of six years to know of good customer service!!!  Upper East Side's Irish pub to check-in the ongoings of one's sport team(s) and induce the spirit of merriment in group settings.  On a Saturday night it was rather quite dead or was the ailing economy discouraging patrons from a night of good clean fun??  Don't knock it as their burgers are slightly a step above McDonald's and their French Fries are also okay laa3, but not entirely delicious to die for as there is no sold definitive underwriting.  Dylan Murphy's is okay laa3.",1,,1
84,Betty J.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,1/23/2017,"Racist Owner.  This was the second bar we walked into on 1/22/2017 (big Sunday football) While waiting off to the side, while my friends got their drinks at the bar, I was approached by a waitress.  She asked me if she could help me with anything, I replied ""I'm ok, thank you"" (I'm black btw).  She than asked, nothing to drink? nothing to eat?, I replied no to both (was drinking all afternoon, so I was pacing myself).  She than asked, if I was waiting for the bathroom, I replied no to that as well.  She than told me that I could not stay.  These words came out of her mouth.  Shocked of course, I than asked her ""I can't stay even though my friends (who are all white) are all drinking?"" She than quickly replied, oh I thought you were alone, I thought you were alone and quickly walked off. (I guess they don't think black and white people hang out?)  The owner, who initiated this whole thing, stood by in the corner and watched the entire exchange.  I should add, one of the girls that was with us (who was white), was standing next to me without a drink in her hand (yet) and she was never approached or bothered.  I'm writing this review to share my experience at this establishment.  I'm the absolute last person to ever scream racism, but put yourself in my shoes for a sec, and see if you can call it anything else.  I'm a lifelong New Yorker, who loves going out and having drinks with friends, this experience will not change that.  I refuse it to.",3,,

I was in the bathroom for about 6 minutes and this girl was aggressively pounding on the door and yelling.  When I came out I told her to relax I wasn't in the restroom that long...And she said ""I work here don't you dare talk to me like that."" It was the bartender, I later found out. I'm sorry, I didn't realize staff could treat their customers like shit but we in turn had to bow down to their needs. I wouldn't ever come here again.

Seriously, the chicken fingers are the best I've ever had, and most people agree when I take them there and make them try it. And I take EVERYONE to Dylan Murphy's! It's the perfect place to go for football Sunday, late-night Friday or a random Wednesday after work. The Nook bar downstairs is great for hosting parties too. I'll always love you DM!",,,

Nice decor, clean, flat screens, good bartenders. Standard crafty beer list on tap but nothing to rave about.Some nice specials going on - .50 cent wings and $10 beer-burger-fries deal during 4-8 happy hour. Seems like they have specials going on all week.Definitely a locals type of bar. About ten people in here around 10PM when I dropped in. Not a total frat party, but when some of the regs started singing along to a Tom Petty and then a Bon Jovi song I gagged a bit on my beer.",2,2,1

Walking around with some friends, we didn't know if we would be able to find anywhere to grab dinner. Lucky for us, Dylan Murphy's kitchen was open.The food was okay. I ordered the chicken pot pie which would have been great if the chicken hadn't been on the dry side. My friends seemed equally enthused, although this is a bar so we weren't expecting gourmet food. The atmosphere, on the other hand, was decent. Great music, everyone enjoyed their beers, and everyone was relaxed despite the hurricane going on around us.",,,
107,Holly N.,"Troy, NY",382,574,672,1.0,10/30/2011,"Thanks, Dylan Murphy's. Thanks for ruining my Halloween with your false advertising.We were boppin' around the UES and wanted to find a chill bar WITH some sort of costume contest since I'd worked so hard on my getup. We settled on Dylan Murphy's because their website advertised a contest at midnight with $200/$100 prizes. We walked in the front door and one of our first questions to the bartender was, ""Your website advertised a contest at midnight, are you guys still doing that?"" The question was asked because there were very few people in costume (making my chances better, right??) and she affirmed they'd be having it. Well.... midnight came and went, no contest. We thought they were just waiting for more people to come in with costumes, ok. I can dig that. 'round about 1am I asked again and the bartender was like, ""ooooh.... we're not doing that anymore."" Really??! Then why did I stay here because this place was a dirty hole and was not the scene our group was looking for on Halloween. What a waste of my time and my friends' time! I could have gone somewhere else and at least had a shot or we could have gone elsewhere and had a better Halloween crowd, but nope. I was bamboozled into staying at a sub par bar. I wanted to talk to the manager and she REFUSED to bring him over. What a crock! First of all, I'm very mild mannered in real life and wouldn't have yelled at the guy but would have told him he should honor the information on the bar's website and, second of all, the least the bartender could have done is given us a round on the house or something to try to appease us instead of acting snotty. She clearly hates her job, the bar, and her patrons. If she hates the place and is that annoyed, she should find another bar or - better yet - another profession.It's too bad that this place is so awful because it's really convenient to my friend's place and we could have become regulars if we'd had a decent experience and, really, all they would have had to do is run the contest they advertised. I didn't need to win, but I at least wanted a chance to enter. If they didn't honor the information about the costume contest, how can you ever be sure that any of the other information on their website is true??",5,3,1

The choices are limited to the typical options; pancakes, eggs benedict, breakfast burrito, french toast..but the price (around $10-12) comes with a mimosa or blood mary. The bloody was your run of the mill drink but pretty large in size which was nice. We came here the morning after the hurricane of the century, and we had great service by the only waitress/ bartendar working. They also had the bar options available this particular morning, but not sure if that is always true of brunch time. The wings are slightly above average because I can't seem to find a bloody wing place in this city worth going back to...In summary, your intentions, fellow yelper, of categorizing this as a ""standard UES frat bar"" doesn't fit the bill here; walk by every day (as I do), and you'll find a mixed bag of people, so for you sorority folk, don't come here expecting a meat market..you want that, try Mad River..",,,

116,Paul F.,"Redmond, WA",2,12,0,1.0,11/24/2012,To begin the food is terrible at best. The fries were over-cooked and cold while the grilled cheese was dry toasted bread with cheese slices tossed betweeen.That said I still thought the service was acceptable until I spoke to a manager about the food. He was fine with it but a bartender decided to argue about it. At that point it went downhill quickly. Obviously I won't be going back when there are so many better options on the UES.,2,1,

Someone needs to make sure that jukebox doesn't have xmas music as an option. Perhaps my wide, n00b eyes have narrowed a bit. It's still a cool bar. I still like the food and the daily meal/beer deals. It's still my default choice of bar by my place. But it's nothing amazing. It does the basics well.",,,

124,Mike O.,"Brooklyn, NY",210,1721,570,3.0,5/5/2012,"This place is up Yelp's butt so check in with all those deals, yo! An Irish pub (what else on the UES, or really, anywhere in the city?) with more patrons connected to smartphones, iPads and whatever the hell Dr. Dre is soliciting as headphones than patrons connected to a shot of Powers whiskey and a Smiddick's. Pumping the Top 40's dance hits lightly in the happy hour din against the open facade on a spring evening as the 3rd Ave. taxis whisk up the avenue. Seems like a bar in search of an identity. And a cash flow.",,1,
125,LISA N.,"New York, NY",850,383,283,4.0,10/7/2011,"The waitresses are always super nice, and the place doesn't get too crowded or crazy during the weekday.  The food comes out fast and there's a pretty clean bathroom as well.  I always have a good time here, especially because they play so many tv's so you'll get to watch your favorite baseball/hockey/football team whatever it is.",2,,1
126,Unknown Consumer S.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",53,115,137,4.0,3/15/2012,Great little place in the UES. First time customer. Went on a Tuesday which was wing night. 50 cent wings. Minimum of 8 per order. 10 dollar pitchers of beer. I love to save money!!,,,
127,Susie B.,"Manhattan, NY",33,22,12,5.0,9/23/2011,"Great UES neighborhood bar with the infamous Back Page wings (yes, it's true), great beer selection, good music, plenty of TVs for football ... and it's owned by the world's greatest bartenders, Blake and Jack (formerly of the Trinity)!!!  There's not much more to ask for in a good bar.",1,,
128,Chris J.,"Manhattan, NY",215,231,0,4.0,3/16/2009,"Do you know that obnoxious frat party that doubles as an annoying bar on the UES? Yeah. Mad River. Do yourself a favor walk to the door, turn around and walk diagonally across the street, toward the Seven-Eleven. Look directly to the left and there you will find Dylan Murphy's. I like it because it's convenient. They pull Blue Moon, Stella, and Sierra Nevada, and it usually isn't overcrowded. When I'm drinking I'm usually focused on racing myself to drunk or full from countless beers, and not so concerned about people watching or picking up girls. Sometimes I even like talking to people and having a conversation over a few pints. Dylan Murphy's is a viable candidate. They also have a downstairs bar area, directly across from the little boys room [restroom, not Neverland Ranch], but I've never had a drink down there (read: I saw what happened to Webster, MacCauley Culkin, and Bubbles the Chimp). All in all, it's a decent bar and a more ""local"" option compared to Mad River. *Note: the first time I came to this bar, I almost wet myself when I saw two girls cheering for James Madison University football. If you don't know why that is more funny than my Michael Jackson reference, please don't FUC me.",5,4,4
129,Meg M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,12,4,5.0,7/27/2014,"Fun atmosphere, typical greasy yet delicious bar foods, drinks made well - overall a fun time! The bartenders make the place - such great people.",,,
130,Amber L.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",47,114,8,5.0,7/29/2013,"One of my absolute favorite bars in the city! Spent some time living on the Upper East Side this summer and started going for their trivia nights on Mondays. Trivia is always a blast-- I now trek up from Bushwick and it's totally worth it. Everyone who plays trivia has a great time and it's a great way to spend a Monday night. Overall great atmosphere and the bartenders are all fantastic. Definitely has a neighborhood casual vibe, everyone who plays trivia is chatty and you get to know the regulars at the bar. Really welcoming place with pretty good deals-- $12 for a beer, burger and fries on Monday nights, cheap pitchers, etc. Doesn't get very crowded although I'm usually their during off hours so I'm not sure how it is at peak times on Friday and Saturday nights. Probably not what you're looking for if you want something trendy but it's very solid as a pub and goes above and beyond what you'd expect for service. I'll definitely keep going back to catch up with my favorite bartenders and (maybe) one day actually win trivia night!",1,,
131,nate r.,"New York, NY",30,98,4,3.0,11/21/2008,"Amidst the sea of wack-ass post collegiate bars, Dylan Thomas distinguishes itself as an oasis of grown-up drinking.  Draught list is nothing to write home about, but definitely steps up from the standard American macros -- Chimay is generally on, as well as Boddington's.  A good place to escape the frantic meat market atmosphere that pervades so many bars in the vicinity. As a side note, bartenders are friendly and unobtrusive.",2,,

Updated review",I posted a review before and seems to have disapeard. Well here I go again... Great bar. Came across this place because it's right down the block from my job and it was a good find. The employees are super nice and the regular patrons are really welcoming. Not to mention they have a great selection of beer. It's officially a regular spot for me.,,,
133,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",128,529,0,4.0,5/4/2011,"This place is your standard UES frat bar, but the food I had was damn good, greasy, and cheap, which is exactly what I want from a bar. I thought the service was fine--it was definitely a slow night--and again, it was so cheap for the amount of food that we had.",,,
134,Jenn K.,"San Diego, CA",80,504,8,4.0,7/11/2010,"After a disappointing first drink at a local bar not-to-be-mentioned, we stopped in here for round 2, and YAY!  Love the friendly bartenders, the setting, and the normal glassware (story for another time).  Will definitely be back!",3,,1
135,Margi M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,4.0,8/20/2013,"Great time at trivia night at Dylan Murphy's.  Good drink/food specials going on and the service was great, very friendly server.  Will be back for more trivia and football season!",,,
136,Rea L.,"West Columbia, SC",27,16,2,5.0,6/7/2011,"I could live at this bar. Great staff, very attentive and friendly. Love the games on the machine. Good music. Tons of tvs, and willing to switch to your request. Open the doors on a great Spring/Summer day and you are in heaven!!!",,,
137,Jay G.,"New York, NY",18,321,359,4.0,5/22/2008,"A nice little spot that is supposed to offer food soon, so sez the bartender. Its on my way home from the subway, so its good in that regard. The whole bar is covered with wood and plasma TVs showing various channels. Expect to watch European soccer..etc",,,
138,Derek R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/19/2013,"Great bar on the upper east side. Good atmosphere. Irish pub with great drinks and good food. The staff is fabulous, make sure to talk to Jenn the bartender when you get here! Burger, fries & a beer for 10-12 bucks! Doesn't get better than that!",,,
139,Michael G.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,57,0,3.0,12/3/2012,Good music and really friendly staff. Otherwise just a run of the mill Irish bar. The pub grub is decent.,,,
140,Dan H.,"Manhattan, NY",5,18,0,2.0,4/2/2011,"Probably a pretty good place to have a few drinks, but the food was very disappointing.  Stopped in because of the sign outside that says ""Best Wings in UES"".  More like worst wings in the universe!  Also got the grilled cheese, which was also pretty bad and not grilled.  $5 for something that probably cost $0.30 to make and could be made much better yourself at home.  Fries were good, service was good.  PASS",2,1,
141,Julianne P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,4.0,11/27/2012,"Yum! So glad they serve food, bc Sunday funday is only appropriate with good barfood( including pigs in blanket( fresh!) and a good burger, surprisingly for sports bar! Will definitely come again another football Sunday!   Seems like lots of regulars, only second time I had been but bartender gave me freebie after 3rd drink! Was nice to feel welcome after only 2 visits! Would def come back for another round",,,

143,David R.,"West Bronx, NY",0,1,0,5.0,5/17/2012,"This review is strictly for a particular item on the menu, their Chicken Pot Pie.  It's bangin!  Like the perfect coke and the perfect hookup (which you didn't have to pay for) you had not so long ago.  Freakin sweet!  Make sure you order it when Rebecca or Teresa are in, cause I guarantee you will nut in your mouth, as well as other places.  Love the pie!",,,
144,jaimie s.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/3/2010,I've stopped into this bar from time to time on my way home from work and  have always enjoyed the great bartenders and music. However it's been a while since I've been there and now their full kitchen is open. Not only is it open but I'm quite certain they have the best wings on the UES...not to mention a fantastic french dip sandwich too!,,,1
145,Andy G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/23/2010,"Two big thumbs up for Dylan Murphys!!  I come here a lot for the atmosphere and fun crowd, but they've just picked it up a notch with their new kitchen.  Just had the burger and wings!!  Well done!  Highly recommend it!!",,,
146,Doug R.,"Valhalla, NY",16,17,1,4.0,7/9/2008,"We stopped in for a drink or two on July 4th, walking home from dallas BBQ.  The bartender, named Jack, was so entertaining, and the bar so thoroughly comfy, that we ended up staying and drinking all night.  No food yet, but we were told it was coming soon, as the place was new.  They're also building a downstairs, which should be interesting.  No pool or darts, which is a bit of a minus, but good beers on tap, good music selection, and bar crack all made up for it though.  Good times.",1,,
