0,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,5.0,11/14/2018,"A friend introduced me to this restaurant, and I'm so surprised I haven't heard of it before. A group of 7 of us came here around 5:30 for a light dinner. Upon entering, I noticed how dim the restaurant is and how big it is. It looked pretty small from the outside, but it's pretty spacious inside and there's a downstairs level (where the restrooms are). There were very few people there, but the hostess still made us wait until our entire party arrived to be seated. They did upgrade us to a larger table though after we asked if we could add one more person to our party. Since we wanted a light meal, we ordered baked ricotta, grilled acorn squash, kale salad, and 2 pizzas (about 10""): grandma style and portobello mushroom from the Fall menu. The baked ricotta went so well with the bread--an amazing combo. We were warned that the grilled acorn squash was a bit spicy, but I didn't think it was at all.... I loved this dish as well. The kale salad was fine--nothing special but the dressing tasted good! I wasn't a big fan of the portobello mushroom pizza, especially because it was burnt. The grandma style pizza, however, was delicious. I'd definitely order that again. All in all, the decor and the food were lovely, and the price point of the dishes was reasonable (minus the dessert!). I'd come back again for lunch or dinner.",,,
1,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1048,1343,4446,5.0,11/4/2018,"tl;dr: This was possibly the single best dining experience I've had in the past six months. From start to finish, everything about our evening at Loring Place was flawless.The deets:I've walked past Loring Place countless times. Many of which I've paused by the entrance and thought, ""This looks cute -- I should try it out at some point."" It may have taken about two years (and a mouthwatering photo posted by chubbychinesegirleats on the 'gram) to actually step foot inside, but I finally did it... and I wish I'd made that decision a lot sooner!First off, the ambiance is straight up classy. I'm all about that minimalistic style; the decor here totally does it for me. Also, kudos to J for scoring us the sole two-top right next to the windows overlooking 8th Street. I enjoyed being slightly tucked away from the rest of the dining room while having access to the entertainment of Village street traffic on the weekend before Halloween.Second, our server was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable. His descriptions of each dish were thorough and thoughtful. Now, having first-hand experience, I can attest to each item we ordered delivering a phenomenal blend of all five taste sensations, as well as a cornucopia of colors and textures. The flawless execution on the leeks and pears salad, duck cavatelli, and bacon cheeseburger resulted in a mouthwatering blend of complex flavors without clashing raucously.Special shout-out goes to the cheeseburger. While I'm down for the occasional sloppy Five Guys, my bar on burgers is set by Minetta Tavern's Black Label. Loring Place's take on the humble patty-on-a-bun comes in as a very close second to its vaunted Village neighbor's. Also, I was initially skeptical about J's request for the burger to be cooked medium, rather than medium rare, but the meat turned out pink and perfect after all.While we wrestled with whether to splurge on a dessert, we ultimately decided that after one small plate and two larges, neither of us had left appetite to properly appreciate any of the offerings on the menu. As we were presented with the check, a server surprised us with some gratis chocolate truffle-y morsels that were precisely the culminating nibble we secretly desired. I guess you can add prescience to the list of reasons why Loring Place deserves every single one of my five stars.As much as I'm spoiled for choice on exceptional eateries in my neighborhood, I fervently hope that this restaurant sticks around for a long time to come. I'm sure I'll patronize this establishment again -- hopefully long before another two years transpires!",,,
2,Justin Z.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,5.0,10/13/2018,"Drop everything and make this your next dinner out!Loring Place is honestly a game changer for the restaurant scene. The food is incredible and I still don't understand how a place can have such an incredible sashimi dish, elevate the pizza game and blow your mind with a short rib - all at the same time. But that's just the food. What makes Loring Place so special are the entire establishment and staff - from Kennedy greeting you at the door, to Davide and team slinging the freshest cocktails in the city (make sure to try the Brandy & Asian Pear), to Miles finding the perfect bottle of wine to go with our meal. If the restaurant industry gave out service staff awards, our server Chris would get the MVP trophy, no contest. Natalie, the Beverage Director, also went above and beyond to dig up a special vintage for us that was the last bottle. Lastly, the General Manager, George, is one of the most accommodating and gracious hosts I have ever met and the entire location runs like a well-oiled machine.The layout, atmosphere and vibe are all incredible and just flow. Loring Place's modern, intimate and elegant setting is perfect for a romantic date, a gathering with friends, or that talk you need to have with your parents about how you're dropping out of grad school to become an Instagram influencer.10/10 will go there again (probably this week).The house made bread with Hudson Valley butter, roasted eggplant and char sashimi are all must haves. Every. Single. Time.",1,,
3,Esther S.,"Manhattan, NY",290,147,387,4.0,9/5/2018,"The place here is very trendy, I felt like I was eating at a hotel restaurant. There is a bar to the right of entrance where you can wait for your party or just have drinks and the dining area is on an elevated platform with high ceilings above. This is the perfect place to have a date or a nice night out with friends.The food was delicious- we devoured everything we ordered.The zucchini fries with lemon parmesan dip is a must, it is fried perfectly and the tart dip brings the whole dish together. We also ordered the grains salad which was good but could be substituted with something else. The sausage calzone and ricotta cavatelli with duck are the other must orders. Overall, very solid food and a very enjoyable dining experience!",4,1,2
4,Matt H.,"New York, NY",263,236,648,5.0,8/20/2018,"This was an awesome meal! Overall, very modern feel, intimate setting (dim lighting plus candle lit tables), and menu featuring fresh flavors.They're currently featuring a summer menu, and I would definitely start with the cauliflower. It is fried in a tempura batter, spiced, and paired with a delicious lemon jam. This was a huge hit with the table and it disappeared fast.The fluke crudo is another good option. The fish was very fresh, although I would have liked more citrus.Cavatelli was likewise otherworldly. Pasta cooked to perfection, with tender and plentiful pieces of duck, cooked in an interesting sweet and sour tomato sauce.For the large plates, I would get the cheeseburger. Yes, it is $23, but it was one of the best burgers I've had in my life. That was some quality juicy meat, and the pepper aioli was outstanding.Also ordered the Skate - personally a fan of skate, but if you've never had it before, it has a texture and flavor similar to whitefish, and its great for people who aren't hardcore about seafood (definitely carries less of a fishy taste).It also happened to be my fiancee's birthday, and the staff was kind enough to bring out dessert with a candle and 'happy birthday' message!",3,,
5,Angela M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",205,215,3803,5.0,7/2/2018,"This place is the quintessential NY meets West Village restaurant. Upon walking in through a double set of doors, you will first notice the ambiance. The decor is clean, warm, and very inviting- with a lot of white and white brick. When we arrived, which was during Pride Parade, we found a quiet oasis among the craziness and excitement happening outside. We were actually on our way elsewhere, but due to many road closures (closed for cars AND pedestrians this year! Yikes! So much headache in regards to not being able to cross over most streets and avenues!) we ended up stumbling upon this amazing place! The hostesses were quite sweet, and we were sat immediately.Our server was AMAZING. 10 stars for him! His name was An, which he quickly joked, ""like Hathaway"", and I died laughing! I ordered a lovely glass of Rose, and my husband had a Manhattan. Both were perfect! To begin, we had Crispy Indian Cauliflower. This was definitely on the heavier side, and was dense and decadent. The spice was yummy! We also shared a Fluke Crudo topped with crispy rice puffs. The fish was fresh and delicate, and my husband LOVED this! Next we shared a Duck Pasta dish with a sweet and sour infused tomato sauce, and blistered cabbage. This was super yummy and such a nice change up from the usual pasta dish. They had a daily special of Pea Pesto Pizza topped with some delicious ricotta cheese, crispy bacon lardons, and pea shoots. I could eat this weekly... my pants wouldn't fit, but who cares? Just kidding! HahaFor our grand finale, we went with grand ending! We shared some rice pudding. Rice pudding is not my thing- but when the menu indicated it was topped with roasted Rhubarb, and when my husband insisted , I had to try it. Probably among the best Rhubarb dishes I've ever had. It had crunchy sugar on top and the roasted rhubarb was so yummy. For take out (we were catching a flight back home), we decided we order their cookies and confections plate. They even packaged the items with out nuts/seeds separately since my husband has some restrictions. These were great and made us so happy through our flight delay! So happy we took them. With two rounds of our drinks, and all the food mentioned, dinner was about $200 but was well worth it! Thanks for a great farewell vacation dinner, and especially thanks to An for being such an awesome guy and waiter!",7,2,5
6,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",413,305,538,3.0,6/25/2018,"Made a day of reservation for brunch via Resy. I had high hopes for Loring Place given all the buzz that's been around it, but was slightly let down by the brunch menu.We ordered the cheeseburger, tater tots, baked ricotta, and ice cream sundae to share. Baked ricotta was the largest disappointment (especially after reading rave after rave about it) - I guess they use seasonal vegetables for the topping, and the variation we had included some sort of pesto and pickled vegetables, which clashed terribly with the ricotta (in my opinion). Have the feeling I would've enjoyed the previous squash version a lot more. Tater tots and cheeseburger were solid, but it's hard to mess up either of those. I do wish restaurants would stop using shredded iceberg for their burgers, though.Dessert was actually delicious, and I don't usually like sundaes. Really loved the textural contrast of all the different components and zing from the meyer lemon zest.Next time, I'll come back for dinner to try the pizzas and pastas. This place is a solid 'pass' on brunch for me, though.",3,2,3
7,Leah R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,8,0,5.0,11/18/2018,"I went to Loring Place on a Sunday morning with my family, and overall we had a very good experience. The restaurant is very modern and spacious. We had a reservation and were seated immediately, and the service was great the entire time. I ordered a ""toad in a hole"" which was toast with an egg baked into it with avocado, and it was very delicious! They had a lot of creative options that looked great, and it was hard for me to choose between them. We stayed for about 2 hours and didn't feel rushed at all. It was great to be able to make a reservation for brunch on a Sunday and not have to wait forever in a line. I would love to try out this place for dinner as well!",,,
8,Priti K.,"Jersey City, NJ",582,536,706,4.0,3/25/2018,"Recently came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. We arrived at 6p, didn't have reservations and the host said that that we had to be done with our meal by 730. It was kind of annoying because they didn't even kick us out. We didn't leave until after 8. Anyway, the food was quite good. We ordered the delicious bread and butter to start. This is what they do with the wood fire oven. The bread was hearty and super satisfying since I was kind of hungover from mixing gin and wine the night before. don't do that.I had the Detroit pizza and my friends ordered the whole wheat spaghetti. Spaghetti was amazing. I had a taste and wished I'd ordered that actually. The pizza was decent, but unfortunately I've recently had Emily's and so my scale is way off for Detroit pizza. Portions are perfect size where you won't have leftovers. Overall, I liked Loring Place. Would love to try a few other items on the menu. The space is trendy and beautiful!",6,2,6
9,Matt M.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",37,115,85,4.0,8/16/2018,"This restaurant is pricey, but by Nee York standards not awful.  It was loud, and crowded even when I went in at 6pm.  The atmosphere was energetic and young. I had the skate and my father had the Peking duck.  Both were excellent.  They had Manhattans that were made with their own call whiskey which were also excellent. The service was excellent as well.  The only reason this restaurant didn't get 5 stars was because of the noise level, but that is my own personal tast",,,
10,Emily Y.,"New York, NY",284,217,815,4.0,2/19/2018,"Loring Place is a very cute little restaurant near Washington Square Park where we made reservations for my boyfriend Mother's birthdayThe decor and ambitious is great. It's very simple and clean. Love it feels being in the restaurant! We were one of the few people in the restaurant when we arrived at 5:30 but tables started filling up fairly quickly as the night got later. I definitely recommend a reservation or to come early!They have a variety of interesting appetizers and pizzas along with 4 types pasta and some entrees. We decided to skip the drinks and to go all out with food! For appetizers, we ordered the Tuna tartar, Leek Salad, and a few more appetizers. For main dishes, we shared a Sea Bass, yam and goat cheese pizza, grandma style pizza, and duck pasta.The Sea Bass and duck pasta were the most popular around the table followed by the Tuna tartar and Leek Salad. The pizzas were delicious as well but little too heavy if you are dining with old Asian parent ( cheese makes their tummy hurt).One thing to note is that there is no dessert offered for Birthday Reservations. To get anything with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it, you must order a dessert. This was a bit upsetting for few people because we specifically told them it was a celebration, but they never even offered to write happy birthday on the dessert. It felt like they forgot about the Birthday.Overall we had a great time. The appetizers are interesting and main dishes are on point. Solid place for nice intimate dinner with friends. I am interested in coming back with just friends to try the cocktails :)!",4,1,2
11,Bing R.,"New York, NY",146,515,2996,5.0,2/1/2018,The staff and the food is excellent!  Prompt service!  Dishes are healthily prepared with combinations to make new flavors of the ordinary.The sun hikes we had were thinly shaved and made into chips all over our salad with a wonderful dressing at the bottom. We ordered the fish nicely fried crisp with a wonderful green herb sauce.We chose the apple pudding with date ice cream and julienned apples with spices.I never heard of non-alcoholic pairing until now.  It was wonderful!  Not sweet - but refreshing and well orchestrated.We certainly want to go back.  It's good for you type food place.,1,,1
12,Haley S.,"San Diego, CA",331,162,79,5.0,3/4/2018,Wow. Amazing. I didn't have a reservation but I stopped in and had a drink and an appetizer at the bar. Gracie made me the bourbon maple cocktail. It was probably the best cocktail I have ever had in my life. I also had the grilled acorn squash which was absolutely delicious. I willAbsolutely be going back there and will recommend this place to anyone .Apparently it's hard to get a table so you have to make reservations well in advance. There were plenty of seats at the bar so that is an option.,,,
13,Jingqiao H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",157,172,2583,3.0,12/26/2017,"Just felt unhappy after dining here. We didn't expect this place to be this crowded at 12 pm on Sunday. It was a 3-hour wait for a table and 30-min wait for counter/bar seating. We decided to sit at the bar first and wait to be seated at the bar area (there are a couple tables in the bar area).One of the bartenders gave us drink menus after we sat down at the bar, and then just left us there without coming back to take our order. We chatted and waited for at least 5 mins. Since he didn't even bother to provide us with water, I called him over and asked for a coffee. The coffee came and he left us alone again without making sure if we'd like to see the food menu or need anything else. A few mins later, we didn't want to wait anymore and asked for brunch menus and then food as well. Almost 20 mins after we were seated, one of the hostesses came, asking if we are fine siting at the counter or want to move to the table behind us. We decided to stay. Short before our food arrived, another bartender came and got some water for us.I had the Grains Salad, my fried had the Waffles & Eggs, and we shared the Baked Ricotta and Kabocha that came with 4 pieces of baguettes. -- Baked Ricotta and Kabocha: the baguettes were burnt and tasted bitter. Some people like this style, but I don't. The ricotta and kabocha were sweet and flavorful with sautéed onions, but very greasy.-- Grains salad: simple and light, but full of oil and fattening aioli. The so-called fall vegetables were just a few pieces of chopped leaves, a few orange pepper chunks, some corns, and 8 pieces of thinly sliced radish. The taste wasn't bad, I liked it, but it was far less green than I expected.-- Waffles & eggs: tried a little bit of friend's food. It was a little spicy, tasted delicious, but nothing special at all; just like normal Benedict.When we were about to leave, a mid-aged couple sat down next to us. They were immediately provided with drink and brunch menus even before they completely sat down, and once they did, they had 2 cups of water in front of them. We were so upset because we didn't enjoy the same quality of service nor were treated the same way as other customers. My theory is that, we are Asian and look really young, so that bartender didn't take us seriously because he thought we were just some kids.  The interior was somewhat romantic and modern, and we received a smile when we walked out from one of the hostesses, which made us feel better. But for sure I will save my brunch for other restaurants.",4,1,2
14,Heidi C.,"New York, NY",214,391,180,5.0,12/22/2017,"This place is just perfection. The interior design is minimalist, but thoughtful extra touches. Very natural theme with woods, neutrals, and green. Comfortable seating lolService was spectacular. Everyone was super nice! Food was SO GOOD! There were def some super star dishes, and some more alright. In my photo GREEN means must order! YELLOW means it was not bad. Must order include:* fried butternut fries* baked ricotta* beet salad* yogurt cheesecake Giving it 5 stars bc I had a good time, and I would come back to try rest of the menu.",1,,

The restaurant itself is cute and the ambiance is spot on for celebratory occasions. I ordered the cider as my cocktail and was quite pleased. For my entree I had the ricotta cavatelli with duck.

18,Eric R.,"Boca Raton, FL",237,182,341,5.0,8/11/2018,"One of the better meals I have had.  Maybe ever.  First the place is really nice but not overly done.  It's a cool vibe but not ""you're not cool enough to be here"".  It's welcoming.  Every single person we encountered was warm from the moment we walked in to the bar to table staff.  And it seemed like they had an army of people.  Place was crowded for our early bird 630 res and stayed packed entire night.  We wound up doing all apps/small plates/pizzas.  Hummus was incredible.  Served with radishes and their version of a wheat thin which was awesome.  Hummus excellent and even the radishes were good. The strawberry salad was fantastic and comes with a little spice to it.  Yellow tomatoes. And everything tastes like they just picked it.  We wound up with two of those.  The broccoli salad was amazing.  I was distracted by the grandma pizza (we had to get 2) so I didn't eat as much as I would have liked.  Broc salad was terrific.  The grandma pizza.  Get one.  Just trust me.  Sauce is so good as is the entire thing.  But I could have drank a cup of the sauce plain.  Then waiter suggested the squash pizza which is seasonal.  The flavor was remarkable.  Just excellent.  Squash, cheese, some spice.  Terrific flavor.  Waiter was awesome.  I'm pretty sure they changed out our plates and utensils 11x.  Their dishwasher must be the size of Costco.  The crisp cauliflower was awesome.  A little sauce which again I could have had a cup of.  The zucchini fries weren't overly fried.  Dipping sauce was amazing and different.  Definitely something about this place where every dish is flavorful and different.  They don't rely on same flavors.  Beet salad was great.  All tastes like it was just picked. Then dessert. We got the chocolate cupcake thing, ice cream sundae and the blueberry cobbler.  The Ice cream sundae seems basic.  It's incredible.  Hidden flavor and not too sophisticated but they took some steps like the toffee walnut chunks which make it amazing. The caramel sauce is definitely their creation and it just all works.  There are chocolate chunks built int.  Just awesome.  The blueberry cobbler is a giant pile of actual blueberries with chunks of homemade biscuit.  I could have used the ice cream sundae ON the blueberry cobbler.  Both incredible desserts.  The chocolate cupcake was good.  Very food.  But next to the others it was light.  Alone it would have been great.  One of the best meals I have had. Ever.  The staff was incredible.  Just a great dining experience.",4,1,1
19,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1550,3.0,11/30/2017,"I was searching for a nice place to take my parents on Thanksgiving evening that wasn't doing a prix-fixe turkey dinner extravaganza (as we were already doing that at lunch). Loring Place, with its contemporary, vegetable-menu and non-prix-fixing, fit the bill. I made a 7:30 reservation 2 or 3 weeks beforehand.Once we arrived, the hostess stand was a mess. Maybe a dozen people either lingering or trying to get their attention. Once we finally got a hold, we were told our table wasn't ready yet... maybe a ten minute wait. Okay, we go to the very crowded bar. No place to sit. We wait. We try to get a bartender's attention. It ends up being twenty minutes, and we have to get the drinks we ordered transferred to the table. It was a holiday, so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the situation was hectic and unpleasant.The dining room itself is gorgeous. The bamboo lit up behind the red windows is beautiful, and the space oozes sophistication. The furniture is Scandi-chic, and seemed a little Ikea-ish for the rest of the vibe, which felt higher-end.As for the drinks: my brandy-and-pear concoction was okay. I liked the aesthetics of the pear garnish but it wasn't ripe enough so it was unpleasant to eat. My mom's mezcal negroni was on point, though. Drinks were all $16 or so.Most dishes on the menu are $14 to $18. This isn't much of a bargain though, as you'll need at least a couple per person. There are also some larger plates in the $30s. They have vegetables, pastas, and pizzas, largely. Unfortunately, the mushrooms we tried to order, which was one of the things I was excited about on the menu, weren't available.After we ordered, our appetizers came in about 20-25 minutes. The leeks and pears ($17) weren't very impressive to me; again, pears were underripe. Nothing was really tying the dish together and it wasn't remarkable. The wood grilled broccoli ($16) fared better, with the grilling bringing out some great flavor. Didn't get much from the accompaniments, though. We also had some bread for the table ($6), which I found to be average, accompanied by some good butter.Our mains came another 25 minutes later. My parmesan bowties ($18) were as light as I was promised, with perfect handling of the fennel and shrimp, and a subtle touch of chili. However, the dish had a curiously sweet taste, which registered as off to me. My mom liked her roasted beets ($16) which I found to be normal. My dad was happy with his burger ($21).Service, beyond the initial handling of the wait, was good; we really liked our server. I think pacing was slightly slow but was much better than I expected given the bustle when we walked in. The space is stylish. But overall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food. This may be a case of overly high expectations, but each dish I tried either needed a flavor adjustment or didn't stand out to me.",1,,
20,Jeff D.,"Cleveland, OH",28,261,21,4.0,5/21/2018,"This restaurant might be the poster child for New York downtown chic. The exterior maintains its rustic look, but stepping inside is a transformation. Clean, contemporary and comfortable. Even if you don't need the restroom, walk downstairs to enjoy the staircase and the central chandelier. None of this would mean anything if the food were not good. Not a problem here. The Crispy Cauliflower was tempura battered served with a lemon curd jam, parsley leaves and slim ringlets of red chilies. Bow tie pasta was served with shrimp and a buttery sauce that had plenty of heat, but the heat was widely tempered by the butter. Grapefruit Bread Pudding? Bread pudding that was light? Yes, yes and yes!I enjoyed everything here. The food, the surroundings and the staff all worked together to orchestrate an eventful dining experience.",1,1,1

The cocktails were delicious, I had the vodka and strawberry. We shared the savory scone and tater tots for apps. The scone was perfectly flaky and season. The tots were great but slightly oily for my taste. I ordered the squash blossom pizza and loved it!! The crust was thin and crunchy yet soft in the middle. The honey really brought it to the next level. Service was super attentive but not in a hovering way. Would definitely return.",3,,
24,Nick D.,"New York, NY",80,508,704,4.0,11/16/2017,"Arrived on a Thursday night for dinner with three others. Walked by a few times and wanted to dine here because it was packed and has a great ambiance. We started with the wood grilled broccoli salad and fluke crudo. The broccoli had a great smokey taste to it which I've never experienced before. Great tasting. The crudo was paired well with citrus and radishes. It was a great refreshing way to end the starters. For my entree I ordered the special which was bass. Cooked perfectly, and was honestly a gorgeous piece of fish (first time I've said that). For dessert, we were served a birthday cake and box of a variety of cookies. Cake was super moist and tasty, and who doesn't like a variety of cookies? Perfect ending to the meal. The service was very good and informative on our questions about the menu. This place didn't wow me, but it was a solid spot.",,,
25,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",237,79,37,4.0,11/11/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on a Saturday and were seated pretty quickly. We got a table in the back which was much quieter than the main dining area but also had less sunlight. The tator tots we ordered were absolutely amazing and we enjoyed our mimosas as well, though it would have been nice if there was a carafe option available (the mimosas were on the smaller side and were fairly expensive for the size). For brunch, I ordered the toad-in-the-hole, which was basically a fried egg in the center of the toast with avocado. It was good but nothing extremely impressive - it was also spicy which I didn't know and didn't particularly enjoy. I also asked for a side of bacon and really appreciated that they tried to make it extra crispy for me. My boyfriend got the cheddar waffles and eggs, which he absolutely loved and would definitely recommend. Overall, Loring Place is great for groups and a worthy brunch spot.",,,

27,Anjali P.,"San Francisco, CA",51,94,115,4.0,11/5/2017,"Came here for brunch - the key is to order non-brunch dishes here. I had the oyster omelette, the oysters were very oily (more than youd typically expect for fried foods) and I wasn't very happy with my dish. My friends had the baked eggs - pretty standard nothing outstanding. We also had the beet salad, which had too many strong flavors that didn't go well together for me (dill and some other overwhelming flavor, think it was ginger)I'm sure this restaurant is phenomenal for dinner and I will definitely come back to give it a second chance. To be fair - going to any restaurant for brunch isn't really giving it a fair chance.",,,
28,Adam D.,"New York, NY",97,12,19,5.0,7/31/2018,Came here for the second time and was more memorable than the first. We had the cavietelli pasta which was made to perfection and fresh. We also had the skate which to me if done right a very underrated fish. Theirs  is very light with a nice golden brown breaded flaked.Chef was awesome and very attentive to his kitchen as well as the floor. Very well run establishment.,,,1

30,Yae Sul J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",164,52,372,5.0,10/1/2017,Love it! Me and the girls came for brunch a few mins before opening there was already a line and I can see why!The pancakes were so soft and fresh and the strawberry jam seems like it was made from scratch! Sooo good - not too sweet and so fresh!!Waffles and eggs were good too the salty treat I needed for the day - poached eggs on top with cheddar waffle and ham in between the layers with hollandaise sauce!!My friend had the toad on the hole bread which is good :)I really liked our waiter he was so sweet and attentive :),,,
31,Victoria S.,"Brooklyn, NY",151,27,4,5.0,10/11/2018,"First of all, walking in, this place is absolutely gorgeous! It's modern with some natural touches, and just comfortable and lively. It can get crowded and on the louder side, so do be prepared. The plates are meant to be shared so it's a fun place to come with a group of friends. Of the various plates I tried, I particularly liked the fluke crudo and arctic char (I'm a big fan of seafood!). The waiter was really generous with his knowledge of the menu and recommendations as well. Solid, quality food, and great atmosphere. Definitely the kind of place that comes to mind when I think of fine (but unpretentious) dining in nyc.",,,
32,Melody K.,"Phoenix, AZ",66,337,1864,5.0,8/30/2017,"I tip my hat to Chef Dan Kluger for Loring Place, though I had never been to ABC Kitchen, I had Loring Place on my NY Restaurant bucket list. We (party of 4) had 7:30 Tuesday night reservations. The place was completely full. The atmosphere was bustling with conversation. The interior design was clean and simple. Our server Eulises was wonderful.The Cocktail menu was extensive. I sipped on my Paloma while perusing the menu. Our table shared the complementary chef grilled Strawberry Salad, Zucchini Fries w/lemon-parmesan dressing, Crab Croquetas w/Chili Aiola and the Fluke Crudo w/citrus, chilies and radishes. Entrees ordered were the BBQ Chicken w/with corn, tomatoes and jalapenos, Short Ribs w/horseradish gremolata and potato purée, Meatball Pizza w/fennel, mozzarella and shepherd's basket cheese and The Pekin Duck w/turnips, cherries and pistachios. We ended dinner with Vanilla Ice Cream sundae w/pretzels, walnut toffee, chocolate cookie-fudge and meyer lemon and of course 4 spoons.All the food was prepared perfectly and tasted fantastic.

34,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",773,173,56,5.0,1/23/2018,"Had a really spectacular brunch experience here. Made the reservation ~1.5 weeks in advance and snagged a 1230pm spot on Saturday. We arrived a tad bit early so waited at the bar, but not for long before getting seated.All of the food was absolutely amazing. My friend and I ordered the butternut ""fries"", got the ""tater tots"" compliments of the chef (woo!), the cheddar waffles and eggs, and crunchy french toast. This was honestly one of the more impressive brunches I've had in a while. The butternut ""fries"" and ""tater tots"" were deliciously crunchy, and I particularly enjoyed the citrusy aioli sauce that came with the butternut ""fries"". They're ""fries"" in quotations because they more so resemble butternut squash tempura. The ""tater tots"" are a less traditional take on tater tots -- they're comprised of thinly sliced potato strips that are packaged together and fried into ""tots"".The waffles and eggs and french toast were the stars of the meal though. The former was sort of a play on Eggs Benedict, but I loved the subtle difference in the softer waffle vs. a traditional English muffin. I also thought the cherry pepper hollandaise added a nice kick to the dish. T he french toast was TO DIE for. I don't typically love french toasts as I find that they're on the dryer side; however, this french toast was so moist, served with a generous helping of syrup, and had a fantastic crunch of cinnamon crumbs to complement the softer moist toast texture. I loved it! Would definitely come back for brunch! I need to check out dinner next.",1,,

We were 15 minutes behind schedule when we exited the subway on the wrong side of the parade route. We called to restaurant to tell them that we were late and facing an uphill battle to get around the street closings. The staff that answered the phone said it was fine and gave us a suggestion for getting around the barricades. It didn't work. It took us 20 minutes to walk around the blockades, police officers & trick or treaters, while wearing heels, arriving at 6:35, just to be told ""your reservation was moved to 8:00"", in a very cool manner. I get that we were late, but to tell us it was fine when we called then wait for us to struggle to get to the restaurant only to tell us that we have wait over an hour was inconsiderate. They had the opportunity to tell us that had lost our reservation, and that we'd have to wait over an hour when we called. I really fell an accommodation should have been made. Or at least an honest attempt to accommodate us.",,,

38,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,5.0,12/7/2017,"Went here with a group of friends that were visiting from out of town. I had heard so many great things about this place so I made a reservation for our party of 8.We were all pretty hungry, so we decided to split a bunch of dishes:Broccoli salad (4.5 stars): All the ingredients sounded good, but I didn't know what to expect from this dish. Thankfully, everything came together very well and made for quite a tasty start to the meal.Grandma style pan pizza (3 stars): This was the pizza that I was most excited about trying and it was definitely the least memorable dish we had all night. It was very bland and did not really fit the ""pan pizza"" description.Date pizza (4.5 stars): This pizza was the exact opposite of the grandma pizza as it was packed with flavor. The dates, bacon, and chilis all came together for a tasty bite.Spicy meatball pizza (4.5 stars): This pizza was also a real crowd pleaser. Another super tasty pizza, but with a lot simpler flavors--as the meatballs themselves were delicious.Whole wheat spaghetti (4 stars): Another simple dish with complex flavors. Not the biggest portion size, but still very good.Duck cavatappi (4.5 stars): We had no idea what sweet and sour tomato sauce would be like, but we were pleasantly surprised by this dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the duck provided a nice pop of flavor.Arctic char (4.5 stars): This dish was not the biggest, but the fish was cooked perfectly and the accompanying ingredients paired with it well. Definitely a great choice if you're looking for something on the lighter side.""Hostess Cupcake"" (3 stars): This was a twist on the classic dish, but I didn't feel like it tasted any different than the classic dish. Probably would skip it next time.Ice cream sundae (5 stars): I didn't have high expectations for either of the desserts, but this was probably the most tasty thing we had all night. The ice cream was decadent and went well with the pretzel, toffee and fudge--which made for a nice texture as well. Definitely a must order.Cookie box (3.5 stars): A good variety of cookies, but nothing to really write home about.Overall, this place has such an amazing energy and really embodies what I expect from the upper echelon of dining options in NYC. I particularly loved that they were able to place us at a circular dining table as it allowed us to all be engaged at once, rather than broken off into separate sections as is common with a rectangular table. In addition, the service could not have been more superb--the food came out quickly, our drinks were never empty, and they even snapped quite a few group photos for us. The pricing is a bit on the higher side, but the quality of flavors are more than worth it.",3,,

I make a point to bring out of town guests here especially, since they always have fresh, organic, and inspired takes on great American dishes.

Great wine list with various price points.Favorites:Roasted Short Rib: without a doubt the BEST short rib I've ever had. Maybe even the best bite of food in the last year. It's extremely tender and juicy, and the flavor from the wood grill really comes through. Perfectly balanced with the acidity of the horseradish and creamy potato purée. Months later, and my friends and I still talk about this regularly. Baked Ricotta & Roasted Kabocha: this is comfort food at its best. Warm and creamy with a mix of savory/sweet. The portion is quite large but also not too heavy.Date with mozzarella, bacon, chilies, and radicchio pizza: Perfect combo of sweet, smoky, savory, spicy and a little bitter all at the same time. Pekin Duck: perfectly cooked with crispy skin. Definitely will be coming back to try the desserts and brunch!",,,

Updated review","Another great experience! Loring Place hits the spot for us. It's just the right blend of upscale and casual. Though the space is polished and nicely finished, the vibe is totally relaxed and comfortable. It's a place you can drop in any time and feel at ease. Service is professional without being mechanical.To start, the cocktails here are great, we keep returning to the Paloma (123 Reposado Tequila, Grapefruit, Soda, Salt - $16) which is especially refreshing on those warm summer days - highly recommend.  Wine list is excellent, with enticing by the glass options - the 2016 Equis 'Equinoxe' Crozes-Hermitage ($17) was very well selected. Despite being young, it is well rounded and an easy quaff. By the bottle list is a good collection of reasonably priced (many sub $100) bottles that deliver good quality to value.On this visit, we had:- Baked Ricotta (ramps, fava beans and pistachio pesto with grilled sourdough - $16): Always love the baked ricotta here, topped with seasonal ingredients. Very reminiscent of the spring/summer. Must give it a try!- Wood Grilled Broccoli Salad (orange, pistachios and mint - $17): The depth from wood grill offset by freshness of orange and mint is impeccably balanced. Another classic for us.- Wood Grilled Asparagus (yogurt and chili oil - $18): Least favorite, seemed a bit jumbled and chili oil very overpowering. Needs some editing and finesse. Won't order it again.- Whole Wheat Spaghetti (spinach, parmesan, basil and crushed chilies - $18): Good bite on the pasta, and like a little lingering heat. Not too heavy.- Roasted Short Rib (horseradish gremolata and potato purée - $35): Excellent, it may be rather basic, but hard to deny its warmth and comfort. Enjoy with a nice red.- Grapefruit Bread Pudding (yogurt ice cream - $14): So good! The grapefruit really lightens up what is so often a heavy dish. Great way to conclude.The food overall is just like the atmosphere - easy going and comfortable, nothing particularly out there, crazy unique or overcomplicated. It's just well executed and hits all the right notes flavorwise. Nothing was too heavy or overwhelming. If you are looking for an option that is upscale, but relaxed and without pretension, it's hard to think of a better option. Give it a try!",1,,1
44,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,5/7/2017,"Yes! Loring place! If you are fortunate enough to have tried ABC kitchen before, I totally see your point making a visit here. Loving place carried that similar farm-to-table concept, and raised the bar to an even high level.We share a bunch. Loved the jelly donut (especially the raspberry sauce inside), the chia seed pudding (the shaved almond made it a savory, but I loved the combo). Salmon pizza was fantastic too! Well-marinated salmon sat quietly on the crispy thin crust, made me mouth watery! The fried oyster omelette was a bit of a let-down, somehow felt s bit too greasy for me.Next time, dinner please! I wanted to have a full picture of this place!",13,9,17
45,Holly A.,"Philadelphia, PA",19,47,36,4.0,6/14/2017,"Loring place is simply fabulous. A+ for atmosphere, A+ for decor, A+ for service, A+ for small plates and A+ for dessert. The reason I can't give Loring Place 5 stars is because of the pizza and pasta earned a solid B. Outside of Italy, NYC makes the best pizza and pasta in the world. If Loring Place is going to keep pizza and pasta on their menu, they need to up their game. That being said, the Grandma Style Pan Pizza and Gemelli Pasta were both good, just not excellent, like everything else we tasted.",1,,
46,Olivia R.,"New York, NY",314,137,170,4.0,11/27/2017,"A classic American restaurant. The menu has a very similar vibe to ABC kitchen. I've been twice and enjoyed the food both times! The service is so-so. It gets very crowded and it seems like the staff doesn't yet have a handle on how to manage it. For one of my reservations, I waited 20+ minutes even with a reservation. I love that they offer wine on tap. Such an affordable option, call me cheap IDC. Food rundown:Housemade bread: DIVINE. It is served warm with butter and is truly amazing. Ask for a side of salt. The bread is a good size for 2 people, so if you are a larger party, get more! Beets: A nice surprise! Served cold but delish. On the larger side for appetizers. Bass: Good but not great. I was trying to be healthy so getting it served that, but the way it is prepared over sauces makes it a bit ~soggy~Shortrib: YUM! The meat melts in your mouth. Highly recommended. The portion is small so this is definitely not a dish to share.",1,,1

More on that later..  Anyways food wise, everything was ok.  I wasn't particularly blown away by anything...  The famed Brussels sprout pizza was just ok.  Not very filling, but it was light and crisp.  The gemelli crab pasta was mediocre... Not very tasty and pasta was not al dente.  We also got some tuna tartare here which was fresh and very good.  Would recommend that one.  The drink I got (a Moscow mule with spicy pear) was good but not $15 good.Overall I'm glad I got to try here but I would not come back again.  I know its not really the fault of the place itself, but the customers were really pretentious and rude here ..and it does detract from the dining experience here as a whole.   One told me to leave my seat so someone else could sit there, another was basically breathing down my friend and I's back while we were eating, reaching over our food to get drinks and pay bills (there was space between us and another group of ppl to do that), talking very loudly (literally centimeters from our ears) about wanting a seat and about the long wait etc... Basically sitting in our seats a split second after standing up (with our stuff still on the seats and bags still on the hooks) to go to the bathroom... Ugh.",6,,
54,Meiki W.,"New York, NY",260,122,212,5.0,4/5/2017,"Came here for dinner to catch up with a friend. Interior is beautiful, we were greeted by super friendly staff as our waitress guide us to our table. They have a seasonal menu and it was super hard to decide on what to get since everything sounds so good. We ended up getting the butternut fries as appetizer and shared the gemelli pasta and portobello mushroom pizza. The ""fries"" was very interesting in a way I was not expecting. It came with a lemon parmesan dressing which really brings out the flavor in the butternut. As for the gemelli pasta, they were very generous with the amount of fresh crab meat they put in the pasta. Overall dish was amazing, full of flavor with hints of parm, lemon, jalapeños, and mint. All ingredients work so well together and a pasta dish that taste good and not heavy is always a plus. Lastly the portobello mushroom pizza, another amazing dish. It has ricotta, mozzarella, cherry peppers, and oregano... small individual pie with 4 slices but great for sharing between 2 people. I love the combination of those two cheese together, wasn't crazy about the red peppers. It gave it a hint of spiciness that didn't seem to go well with the other toppings on the pizza. Best part of the pizza though was the fact that it's whole wheat! For someone who is more health conscious, you'll love their whole wheat pizza, so good that I'm still craving it. Look forward to coming back next time to try other dishes on the menu that I didn't get to try tonight!",2,1,2
55,Swati S.,"College Hill, Providence, RI",18,16,2,5.0,7/9/2018,Excellent seasonal food and superb cocktails. The fried cauliflower with Meyer lemon chili jam was stunning. Squash blossom pizza had a perfect thin crust with just the right proportions of cheese to blossoms. I had skate for a main and it was soft inside and crisp on the outside with a tangy sauce to go with it.And the special cocktail was gin and prosecco based with cucumber juice and lemon... perfect for a hot summer day.,,,
56,Isabel L.,"Queens, NY",112,132,647,5.0,3/25/2017,"This restaurant was absolutely delightful. The service was amazing as well as the ambience. I started with the the house made whole wheat bread with the hudson valley butter . The bread is very thick with a great taste of course butter makes everything better !The baked ricotta and roasted kabocha was delicious it has a slight kick and that sealed the deal for me I found this dish to be quite amazing. I moved on to the roasted short ribs that melted in my mouth at first bite. My final dish was pizza of course, so my choice was the portobello mushroom ricotta , mozzarella, and  cherry peppers with oregano. The best pizza I have had in a long time.

57,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,3/10/2017,"Quite excellent. After wanting to try for a while, I finally got a chance with a group of friends for a late Sunday night dinner. ABC Kitchen is one of my go-to restaurants in the city, and I've liked what I've seen from Chef Dan Kluger, so I figured I had to give Loring Place a shot. The menu is pretty similar, and seems to be very reflective of seasonal availability. The space itself is pretty modern-looking (also like the space at ABC Kitchen), and low-lit at night.Our favorites:- Spicy meatball pizza: Pretty standard, but the spicy meatballs were really tender and flavorful. Heh.- Dates pizza: The dates and the bacon made for a really good mix with the wood-fired pizza crust.- Baked ricotta with kabocha squash: This was really good, and we kept asking for more bread to dip into it.- Ricotta agnolotti with shaved black truffle: This dish is around $60, mostly because they shave a ton of black truffle on top. And it's totally worth it.- Seared scallops with sunchokes, apples, and lime: the fruit and sweet flavors actually went very well with the richness of the oil and the seared scallops. One of the best seared scallop dishes I've had in a while.Service was very attentive throughout the night, although it was hard to pinpoint who our actual server was, because it kept changing throughout the night. Nonetheless, we had a great time, and kept the drinks flowing. Prices are about on par with that of ABC Kitchen, so while it is a higher price point, you can at least know that everything is well-executed, with ingredients sourced from a lot of local farms.Overall, the concept is very similar to that of ABC Kitchen, but has a good number menu items give Loring Place its own flavor. Definitely a good place for a small group dinner or a date in Greenwich Village.",77,53,73

59,Silvia P.,"New York, NY",2,11,16,5.0,4/15/2018,"Amazing would sum up the experience dining at Loring Place. The food is so unique -- it blends flavors that normally I wouldn't pair together and exceeds all expectations. For every dish the whole table said, ""Wow what is that?!""My favorite had to be the date pizza. It had a thin, soft crust and was topped with cheese, meat, red cabbage, and DATES! I've never tried a pizza that's savory, salty, spicy, and sweet all at once. The asparagus ""fries"" are a close second. It was lightly breaded and fried just enough to make it crunchy but still could taste the asparagus.Hummus dip was also great. Everyone loved it so much we started using it on the rest of our food. Pizza crust too plain? Add some hummus. Asparagus needs a kick? Add some hummus. One dish I wasn't a huge fan of was the oyster omelette. The oysters tasted too briny and the breading too thick. The omelette had avocado and sauce on top. It was still good but paled in comparison to the rest of the food we ordered.Even though I was so full from the food the desserts sounded too good to pass on. We ordered a hostess cupcake and vanilla ice cream sundae. The chocolate cupcake was rich and not overly sweet. It came with a scoop of orange sorbet. The sundae is made of vanilla ice cream with bits of caramel, chocolate, and toffee. That sundae was the best one I've ever had. If happiness were a food it'd be that sundae. In addition to the food the service was also excellent. The servers are knowledgeable and attentive and made the time there extra special. The menu updates often and I look forward to going back again to try the new dishes (on top of the pizza and sundae)!",1,1,

One of the food comes out when the host asks if we reserved the table or if we just sat down. We tell him we sat down because you told us to. He then moves us to a two person table at the high top.

Oyster with omelette - it was okay, an interesting combination. Asparagus salad - unique combination with many flavors. Raddish Hummus - amazing! Grain salad - pretty good!

62,Han S.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,39,0,5.0,5/19/2018,"Loring Place will reset your expectations for what constitutes a sophisticated, delicious culinary experience.We got the butternut squash, broccoli (on the house!), the bacon date pizza and a lamb pasta. The veggies were the best part of the meal - cooked and textured perfectly, bursting with artfully selected flavors. The bacon date pizza was incredible; the flavors complemented each other so well. Unfortunately, the lamb pasta was a bit too salty, but decent otherwise.Perhaps one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at, and I'm one picky bastard.Excellent service in a tasteful, modern ambiance.Keep it up, Loring Place!",,,

The restaurant was comfortable -- not too crowded, not noisy, lovely staff.But sadly the food didn't measure up. I really liked the first course -- Baked Ricotta and Roasted Kabocha. Then, it was downhill. My main course -- Spiced Chicken Salad -- had little taste, and what's worse, many of the chicken cubes were grisly. The dessert menu is boring. I had  the Chocolate ""Hostess Cupcake."" The accompanying orange creme fraiche and tangerine sorbet were ok; the cake part of the dessert was dry.",1,,

We started at the bar and had a Tequila & Clementine cocktail which was very good (not too strong or overly sweet). Once we were seated, we ordered the wood grilled broccoli salad and the smoked salmon pizza. The broccoli was unexpectedly so delicious - be sure to ask for their olive oil brushed bread to scoop up the amazing flavors on the plate! The pizza was also very good, perfect for brunch.

The restaurant itself is extremely nice and spacious and the service was excellent. I found the service at ABC to be very sub par but between the hostess and waiter here, I have zero complaints. Additionally, there is a very nice bar off to the side of the restaurant to have a drink while you wait - plenty of great cocktail options.As for the food, 5 stars! I started with the baked ricotta and roasted kabocha / spiced cauliflower and both were amazing. Following these dishes, I got the whole wheat spaghetti and brussel sprout pizza. Again, two musts. All of these are good to share and it appeared as though a great majority of tables ordered each of these dishes. I definitely recommend this restaurant and can confidently say it is one of my new favorite restaurants in the city!",1,,
66,Monica S.,"Saratoga, CA",126,479,1952,5.0,2/18/2017,"For the last several years, I've been feeling bored with the NY dining scene until Loring Place. To get reservations, you can book a month in advance or if you book one week in advance, you can get an 11pm (yes, that's right, an hour before midnight) dinner rezy on a Friday night. To be fair, the original time was 10pm, but since we wanted to see the ballet which ends around 10:30pm - 10:40pm, we had to delay dinner to 11pm. At 11pm, you'd think a restaurant would be winding down, but the situation was quite the opposite. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed, the bar was packed, and we had to wait 10 minutes for our table. In the mean time, my dining companion ordered a drink from the bar, The Stable: Bimini gin, matcha, fuji apple, lemon, which everyone in the bar seemed to be drinking. (Note: my friend said it tasted like a juice cleanse). After sitting at our table for about 15 minutes, my friend commented that he was not happy about the wait for his drink. At that moment a server came up to him and said something to the effect of, ""We're excited to bring you this drink and apologize for the wait. We're ""comping"" this drink. Thanks for your patience. "" Suddenly, my friend is happy once again....and thinking about the next drink he wants to order, a Beatnik: vodka, amara, blood orange, honey, sparkling sodaWhen it was time to order, we new we wanted the duck, but had the usual dilemmas: bass or short ribs....In the end, we sided heavily with our friendly server's suggestions:baked ricotta and roasted kabocha with grilled sourdough $11 - reminded me of lasagna on sourdough, good, but not wowwood grilled broccoli salad, orange, pistachios and mint $14 - surprisingly tasty, would order againbrussels sprouts pizza, garlic, jalapeños and cheddar $16 - another surprising dishroasted black bass with cauliflower and herb vinaigrette $30 - very goodpekin duck with kale, almonds and dried fruit compote $31 - BLOWS YOUR SOCKS OFFchocolate ""hostess cupcake, "" orange créme fraîche and tangerine sherbert $12 - good, but not wowService was attentive and friendly.

67,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,1/22/2017,"One of the few restaurants in NYC that I made multiple visits to over the years is ABC Kitchen, and despite the unwavering popularity and the passage of time, it still remains one of my favorites. The focus on bringing ""farm to table"" dishes without sacrificing flavor or taste is a balance that few restaurants have successfully achieved, and Chef Dan Kluger accomplished the feat with apparent ease. He left ABC Kitchen in 2014 to pursue starting his own restaurant, however, and several years later, Loring Place finally opened at the end of 2016. The restaurant is named after the street in the Bronx that Kluger's father grew up on, and is both an homage to his father as well as New York City.The restaurant is situated on one of the most traversed streets in Greenwich Village, and despite the fact that there was no evident signage, the venue is surprisingly spacious, with a front and back dining room, and a separate bar area. We were led to a two-top in the back dining room, which has a number of banquettes and free-standing tables that can accommodate a number of party sizes, and promptly given water and menus. The food options here mirror what's offered at ABC Kitchen, spanning a number of appetizers and small plates, pastas, wood-fired pizza, and heartier entrees. My friend and I opted to share all of our dishes so we could try as many as possible, and it's a format our server recommended as well.To begin, we had the Crispy Spiced Cauliflower, which featured a bowl of Indian-spiced cauliflower served with a Meyer Lemon Jam. I loved the cauliflower - the texture was perfectly crisp and the seasoning was spot on - but the pairing with the lemon jam was too sweet, and threw off the flavor of the cauliflower. My favorite of the starters, however, is the well-lauded Ricotta and Roasted Kabocha dish, which plated roasted sliced of kabocha squash over a bed of baked ricotta cheese. Served hot in a small skillet with a side of grilled sourdough bread drizzled with olive oil, it was a delicious combination of flavors and textures; the creaminess of the ricotta, the sweet-smokiness of the kabocha, and the crispness of the bread made for a perfect bite. It's an ideal dish to share, and one that I wish we'd ordered two servings of.Another one of the better decisions we made that night was to order the Dates Pizza; it's a perfect portion to split between two people, and featured mozzarella, bacon, radicchio, and chilies baked on top of a thin, chewy crust. While I don't typically enjoy sweet and savory ingredients on pizza, the combination was expertly done here as the bacon and dates complemented each other well, and the addition of the radicchio proved some much-needed lightness and crispness. I was less impressed with the Whole Wheat Spaghetti; both the flavor and texture of the spaghetti, which reminded me more of soba noodles than anything else, and the lack of cohesiveness in the tomato sauce seemed to clash. There was also an abundance of spinach in the pasta as well, which didn't seem to belong either.I imagine the menu at Loring Place will change seasonally, given the focus on using local ingredients, so I'd love to return once the restaurant has had a few more months to tweak some of the dishes. As a whole, however, the dishes at Loring Place succeed at utilizing and highlighting vegetables without compromising on flavor, which few places are able to do. And that alone is worth a visit, if not many more.",13,6,12
68,Karen N.,"Mahwah, NJ",1,72,0,3.0,11/11/2018,"Sorry to be an outlier here, but we definitely did not have the stellar dining experience that others have professed.  As a matter of fact, as we were walking to Loring Place, we passed so many cozy, inviting-looking restaurants along the way (Christopher St.), we turned to one another and said, ""Sure hope Loring is as charming!""  (Sadly, it wasn't.)  Unlike many of the other restaurants in the neighborhood, Loring Place is actually large-ish, with a much more trendy (and sterile) ambiance than its more neighborhoody counterparts.  I can deal with a restaurant being expensive, but I have little tolerance for *overpriced,"" and for walking away at the end of a meal feeling like I'd been ""had.""  First off, overpriced mediocre wines by the glass (and you get a 3 oz. pour).  Second, $6 for bread and butter.  We were psyched while reading the menu -- everything *sounded* so delicious.  But when we got our dishes, they just weren't (delicious).   The baked ricotta had a nice spiciness to it, but other than that, no interesting textures or complementary flavors.  The Grandma's Pizza was like Elios.  All of our other dishes were more gimmicky than good (like the duck).  In fact, despite the number of ingredients, everything was actually kind of bland.  Next time, we're going to try one of the more casual places down the street.",,,
69,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,267,1183,4.0,8/10/2017,"Food: 4/5Ambience: 4/5Service: 4.5/5Need to switch up your usual brunch game? This is a great option with menu that is definitely more lunch themed with a few classic brunch items mixed in. We ordered the baked ricotta (4/5) which had a great balance of creamy cheese and juicy bursting tomatoes, definitely a great starter. The zucchini fries (4/5) were also great to munch on, I especially liked the lemony tangy dip! A salad of strawberries and tomatoes (3/5) was just okay - I'm not a fan of fruit in my salads but I would've liked something to pull it all together (perhaps an herby bright sauce or a creamy dollop of yogurt). Next was a zucchini blossom pizza (4.5/5) which could've been more aesthetically pleasing (I was expecting beautifully visible zucchini blossoms) but was a pretty perfect summery pizza, great crust and I highly recommend! Oysters are not typical brunch fare, and I'm not quite convinced by the crispy oyster omelette (3.5/5); the oysters were fried well, the eggs were fine, but together it's a strange combination - perhaps it's a take on the asian oyster omelette? Duck hash (4.5/5) was one of my favorites, the salty duck was mellowed out by the maple vinaigrette and a refreshing blend of veggies helped lighten up the dish.Overall I found the food to be good but not great - everything felt a little too ""safe"". I love the focus on variety and seasonality (lots of vegetable-forward options), and I think some tweaks could've really elevated the food.  The service was excellent, super friendly and helpful with the menu, and they offered to replace my cocktail when I found mine to be too sweet. Ambience is a little sophisticated rather than a casual/cozy brunch spot, so it was perfect for our girls brunch date! I'm definitely curious to come back for dinner, where hopefully I can find some dishes that really wow me.",2,,2
70,Nayla B.,"Manhattan, NY",193,137,264,4.0,2/28/2018,"Absolutely LOVED my brunch experience at Loring Place. I came in with high expectations and the food at the restaurant matched it. The vibe is very clean and simple, as is the food. You can really tell that Loring Place is using prime ingredients and creating beautiful, unique dishes with them. I highly recommend the hash browns, butternut squash fries (which came along with the most DELICIOUS Parmesan sauce), broccoli appetizer, salmon tartare, and for the grand finale, the french toast (one of the best brunch items I've ever had...so do yourself a favor and order this dish)! My only suggestion is that they enlarge some of the size of their meals, which felt a bit small for the price tag. But I still definitely recommend this place for brunch!",1,,

Dinner was healthy and hearty with very seasonable prices (drinks as well). Chef totally crushed the art of cooking veggies plus impressive use of lemon/citrus in the savory dishes--I would totally become a vegetarian if I can cook like him : )Crispy roasted cauliflower with Meyer lemon jam and chillies 4.5/5: this dish ignited my love towards cauliflower again! quote my friend Lori ""cauliflower is one of the most underappreicated veggie."" It's crispy and meaty. Very nicely caramelized edges. I also enjoyed his usage of refreshing lemon jam-- the flavor expands slowly.Baked ricotta and roasted kobacha with grilled sourdough 4.5/5: highly recommend!! Savory and satisfying. Kobacha is very sweet and nicely balanced by the citrusy sauce, creating a more sophisticated taste for the dish. The sourdough is excellent nicely browned edges with yummy olive oil. (Our serve was very nice to offer us extra breads without us asking : )).DATES pizza 4/5: excellent. Again, it's lovely to enjoy the sweet kobacha.Whole wheat spaghetti with spinach and chillies 4/5: nothing close to a classic pasta dish--totally wasn't what my friend and I were expecting, but I enjoyed it. The marinated chillies are very refreshing with a nice kick from the sourness. Whole wheat plus spinach--can't get healthier than that!!Would love to see his tasting menu!Great service!

Don't get me wrong! The food was good but not ""OMG I NEED TO COME BACK HERE"" type of food.The only hit dish of the night we thoroughly enjoyed was the zucchini fries! We also ordered the cauliflower, eggplant, squash blossom pizza, and duck pasta. The corn in the duck pasta was so fresh and crisp on a side note!  Everything was good but not great. With recently dining at Olmsted, I feel that their farm to table concept was more outstanding and delicious than Loring Place if we were to compare.

We were seated quickly and service was great throughout. We were told to order 3-4 dishes per person, but we ended up doing 4 total and it was more than enough! We started with the butternut squash fries, which are a must-try, and came with the best sauce. We also did the kabocha / ricotta toast, other reviews said this was really sweet but we didn't think so. They serve extra bread for it if you ask, but that seemed a bit heavy so we held off - really interesting dish! Next was the pear and leek salad, good but not in line with everything else we ordered. The pears were great but the leeks were a bit odd. Our fourth plate was with the much-hyped grandma pizza, which may be the best we've ever had. It was a bit smaller than expected, so don't expect enormous portions - it was perfect for sharing between the two of us. Finally, we ended with the sundae on our waitress' recommendation. It was amazing - the perfect mix of salty, sweet...it sounded simple but was one of the best desserts we've had. All in all, loved this place and hope to come back for brunch!",,,

While there were some hits and Chef crushes veggie forward dishes like nobody else in town, there were too many disappointing dishes to fulfill my excitement. I was blown away by the baked ricotta with roasted kabocha (which had a perfect amount of heat) and the fluke crudo served with crisped rice. Unfortunately, the broccoli salad was a huge disappointment as it was swimming in a mayonnaise-like sauce. And while the vanilla blizzard tasted great, $12 for a scoop of vanilla ice cream with some toppings was bothersome...especially with Big Gay Ice Cream being only a few blocks away.

Started with the butternut squash fries and the baked ricotta with kabocha. The fries were interesting- it was tasty (maybe a tad salty) and definitely required a dip, which was creamy but also salty. I was intrigued and kept eating it but glad it was only a few pieces to the order.The baked ricotta was the winner of the two starters (and the whole dinner!). Delicate and balanced with the kabocha and caramelized onions. Paired perfectly with the perfectly grilled bread.Then moved onto the spicy cauliflower and the grains salad. The grains was a nice medley of grains and veggies and provided a refreshing break from the rich starters. The spicy cauliflower could've been spicier as was quite subtle in flavor.Now on to middle courses- the duck pasta dish and dates pizza. The pasta dish was cooked well (texture of pasta and duck and amount of sauce) however I didn't particularly like the combination of flavors. I liked the pizza. I normally enjoy bacon wrapped dates and definitely enjoyed this pizza. The pizza was covered with radicchio which barely made a difference in taste as the dates and mozzarella were overpowering- only suggestion could probably be to add a little more bacon.As for the entrees, tried the lamb chops and bass. The chops were horrible - extremely fatty. The table next to us had ordered lamb chops as well and we noticed their pieces were meaty and edible compared to our pieces. The broccoli leaves were replaced with collard greens for the evening which didn't make a difference to the overall impression that this dish was a waste of time, money and calories. The bass was simple and pleasant although nothing to write home about.Disappointed that the meal was going downhill, decided to skip desserts. Staff takes awhile to replenish drinks - whether it be fulfilling a glass of wine order or our glasses of water. Very hit or miss on the food.

The Cheeseburger was excellent ($19), but the too thick Fries it came with were too potato-y.Definitely go with the pizzas and pastas. The veggies are great too, but definitely on the pricier side.

Updated review","Dropped down from 4.5 stars to 3.5/4 stars when I recently went for brunch. The service was incredibly slow - it took them 20 minutes to bring us our order of tea, and the server forgot to come take our food order for a very long time.  In terms of the dishes we ordered, my friend seemed to enjoy her scrambled cheesy eggs,  but my duck hash was disappointing - I could barely find any pieces of duck - maybe 2 or 4 pieces if I'm being generous.  Overall, it was not worth the $23 price and I should've gotten one of the egg dishes or the salmon pizza.  But, the server didn't end up charging us for the tea (I don't know if this was intentional or he just forgot) and he didn't charge my friend for her side of toast she ordered with the eggs, so that bumped it up from 3.5 stars to this place keeping their 4 star rating from me.  That being said, I don't think I'll be back for brunch any time soon.",1,1,1

86,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,6/14/2017,"Loring Place was on my list long before its opening. Though I've never been to ABC Kitchen, I've been following Dan Kluger's exploits for a while now and have been dying to try his craft. It's my kind of food. Locally-sourced, organic, pretty healthy, letting the ingredients speak for themselves--I'll happily spend a bit of extra cash to eat like this. The only issue? It's virtually impossible to book a table at one of Kluger's restaurants. Walk-ins are welcome, but expect to wait. I had been checking Resy weekly to see if I could find an open table before 10pm, with no luck. So when I was walking down 8th street a few weeks ago, I decided to pop in. I promised myself I wouldn't leave before finding a time, and I stayed true to my word. We dined here on Sunday night, and other than a few hiccups (the AC system was overly excited) our experience here was fabulous. And the expectations were HIGH. Loring place is sophisticated but far from pretentious. Everyone we interacted with during our dinner here was lovely, helpful and accommodating. Our table wasn't quite ready upon arrival, so we got to spend a bit of time at the bar before getting started with our food. In addition to being well-color-coordinated, there was some solid cocktails coming out from behind the bar. My first drink was the Stable (Bimini Gin, Matcha, Fuji-Apple), which was perfect for a hot day. Also nice if you want a little pick-me-up before diving headfirst into your food. My bf got the Thoroughfare (Quackenbush Amber Rum, Blackwell Rum, Ginger, Kaffir Lime, Sparkling Soda), which was even more refreshing. Like an elevated dark and stormy. Drink-wise, I stuck with rosé for the rest of the evening, which is a fabulous choice when you're working with relatively lighter cuisine. In terms of food, both of us ate very little prior to our reservation to prepare our stomachs. But my bf being the guy that he is, we *needed* to put in an order of bread, STAT. So we got the House-made whole wheat bread w/ bread with hudson valley butter, which was thankfully as good as advertised. Fresh, local, seriously yummy. I usually don't eat carbs or dairy, so it was hard to keep me away from this while we waited for the rest of our food. It's a pretty decent amount of bread, so don't fill up on too much it before getting to the main event. As advertised, the food here is healthy, locally-sourced and delicious. And homage to the earth. Our eats, below:Sugar snap peas w/ radishes and pecorino vinaigrette: ADelightful. My bf was none too pleased about paying $16 for snap peas (I mean yeah, a little bit excessive) but this was certainly the best snap pea preparation I've ever had. Incredibly fresh, crispy, clean flavors, and paired quite well with the dusting of cheese on top. Very much a ""fresh from the garden"" feel.Crispy, spiced cauliflower w/ meyer lemon jam and chilies: A-/ANot that I mind, but this dish was the first of many we received featuring chiles. Thankfully I don't mind, but I would've appreciated some more variety. The cauliflower was lightly fried-- rich but still elegant. The meyer lemon jam is not to be underestimated--very sweet, very tart. Overwhelming if you don't dole it out mindfully. Fluke crudo with citrus, chilies and radishes: A-Had a combo of flavors from our first two dishes. If it wasn't so good, I'd say it felt redundant. More citrus, more chilies, more radish. Different citrus flavors here, though, and it worked perfectly with the fluke. Anything too strong would overpower the fish. The puffed ingredient sprinkled on top added some nice texture, though no idea what it was.Special squash blossom pizza: A++Unbelievable. Easily the best savory dish of the night. We almost opted for the mushroom pizza but I'm so glad we took a risk. There was some sort of honey-chile sauce that made this next-level good. Between the sauce, ricotta and squash blossom, this pizza was sweet, savory and rich.  And the flatbread itself was baked perfectly. Serious win.Pekin Duck w/ carolina rice, almonds and rhubarb: A+This got better with every bite. Oddly started out at an A-, ended up an A+. Clean, hearty flavors. The duck was cooked as I've good as I've seen, the skin perfectly crispy. I tend to not love rice, but this stuff was great. Loved the addition of the almonds and rhubarb--adding some earthy sweetness to duck is always a good idea. Well-executedI was actually between four and five stars before dessert. And I never eat sugar. But we went for it, and now I can happily say that this was a five star experience because of the desserts we demolished on Sunday:Vanilla ice cream ""blizzard"" with pretzels, walnut toffee, chocolate cookie-fudge and meyer lemon: A+ Best ice cream I've had in years. Mind blown. Loaded ice cream is my absolute favorite so this had me floating.Strawberry shortcake w/ almonds and cream cheese: A+Best shortcake I've ever had, well, period. Classic but elevated to the highest level.",8,1,3

88,Lais S.,"Astoria, NY",7,43,132,4.0,7/28/2018,"Came in at 1:35 for restaurant week and was seated right away. We ordered from the restaurant week lunch menu. For appetizers my mother ordered the crab salad with raspberry and tomato gazpacho and I ordered the char sashimi with roasted strawberries, cherry tomatoes and olives. The crab salad tasted simple yet very fresh and the gazpacho was the perfect appetizer for a hot summer afternoon. The char sashimi melted in my mouth. I am not used to eating roasted strawberries with a savory item like fish, but I could get used to the unique combination of flavors. For entrees we both ordered the slowly cooked halibut,summer squash, and sesame chili oil. The chef brought out a complimentary dish of summer beans with peaches, herbs and goat cheese. The halibut was perfectly cooked; it was flaky yet smooth. I could of eaten it with a spoon!  The summer squash absorbed the sesame chili oil and balanced out the smooth halibut. The goat cheese added a delicious creaminess to the summer beans. Our waiter wasn't very attentive, we had to ask a different waiter for more water. I highly recommend coming here for the food during restaurant week. You won't be disappointed! Definitely make a reservation as this restaurant fills up fast.",,,
89,Tash R.,"Manhattan, NY",19,214,160,5.0,1/27/2017,"Definitely a 6/5. This restaurant is exceptional!Everything about Loring Place is amazing. The food, ambiance and the service!!Food: We loved every dish that we ordered!  Liz made excellent recommendations:- Crispy cauliflower- Fluke- Baked ricotta with kaboscha squash- Black Bass- Suckling pig- Kaboscha turnoverIt was so hard to narrow down what to get that we just accepted the fact we will have to come back next week to try the other dishes and try very hard not to reorder the same dishes.Service: Impeccable service. Both Liz and Bruno were super friendly and enhanced our dining experience. Krissa (?) the manager was also super sweet making sure everything was fine. The simple things make you really love a restaurant.Ambiance: It really had such a great vibe to it. Restaurant had great acoustics and loved that we weren't sitting on top of other diners. The bar area looked pretty fab too!We find it hard sometimes to choose a place that's kid-friendly with our 16mo daughter Parker but even she loved it.  Now we love it so much we know we're coming back next Friday, same time for date night :)",,,1
90,Luciana C.,"Essex County, NJ",74,177,424,4.0,7/7/2017,"Exciting to try such a hot spot! The atmosphere was trendy and clean. Staff was super nice. I really loved our waitress (blonde) and wish I remembered her name! From the drinks to the food, she knew it all!!I'm not a cocktail girl, but decided to start the ""different night"" differently! I went with The Shandy - IPA, gin, strawberry & lemon. It was not as large as I wished, but SUPER tasty. All the juice is distilled in house. Not too sweet either. Perfect for IPA lovers.We got the Spinach Pizza and Zucchini Fries to start. Service was SUPER quick - not sure if good or bad haha. The pizza was amazing. The crust was doughy, but rest of pie thinner. The spinach was cooked perfectly and crisped. Not a cheese person, but the goat cheese balanced perfectly with the tomatoes and jalapeños. The crust also was salty (really think/hope it was sea salt and lovvvved). The Zucchini Fries were battered with vodka seltzer and sooo light as described. Dipping sauce amazing as - Parmesan (cheat!!) as well!!For the main, I got the Arctic Char. It was so tasty and the fava beans and snap peas were amazingly seasoned. The topping was fruity, but spicy. Super filling despite the deceiving small plate. My boyfriend got the Organic Chicken as per the waitress' decision and loved it as well!Overall a solid 4. Be prepared to spend, but food will be worth it. Drink before if you have to save - don't skimp on the food experience ;)",1,,1
91,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4580,1590,1642,5.0,5/30/2017,"Fans of ABC Kitchen will be thrilled to hear that the genius behind ABC has opened his own restaurant in Greenwich Village. The space is intimate feeling and almost cozy, but still modern with light wood tables and chairs. Kluger has always been all about seasonality when it comes to ingredients and that is true at Loring Place also. We started with the creamiest hummus and radishes so fresh, it tasted as though they were picked that day. We shared several other small plates including the market beets, flake crudo, tuna tartare and crispy chicken. The highlight for me was the crispy chicken, coated in a maple-chili glaze and they had a great crunch. Plus they are gluten free! I ordered the arctic char with sugar snap peas, and sea beans for my main and it was delightful. I also was able to snag a bite of the duck with carolina rice and rhubarb, and it was superb. For dessert, ask for the gluten-free, diary-free blizzard that is not on menu. We were fighting over this dessert it was so incredible!",21,13,17
92,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",357,144,37,4.0,7/4/2017,"The comparisons to ABC Kitchen are endless. However, Loring Place doesn't need to rely on its ties to the popular restaurant, because it's impressive in its own right. ""Market-driven"" dishes are the focus here, and as a result, the unique, seasonal ingredients shine, particularly those featured in the small plates.Our dinner began with a selection of small plates, but deciding among them was not an easy feat. We started with the Crispy, Spiced Cauliflower, which is paired with Meyer lemon jam. The cauliflower is well-seasoned and the lemon provides a striking, tangy quality to the fried vegetable. Be careful not to use too much of the jam, because it can overwhelm and mask the spices on the cauliflower.The Grilled Strawberry Salad sticks out on the menu, due to its originality and summery traits. Consisting of two types of strawberries, sungold tomatoes, and cucumbers tossed in a red wine vinaigrette, the salad is light and refreshing. It's likely that it'll be available for a limited time, until the fruit is no longer in season.The Wood Grilled Asparagus is very tender, and served on a mixture of yogurt and chili oil. Onion flakes partially cover the asparagus, adding a crunchiness that complements the less substantial ingredients. Unlike the Meyer lemon jam's effects on the cauliflower, the more yogurt and chili oil on the asparagus, the more flavorful it becomes.We couldn't resist Loring Place's house-milled whole wheat pizzas, especially the mouthwatering Squash Blossom. Hands down, the best dish of the evening! The squash is placed on a ricotta and mozzarella base, and then drizzled with honey. Chilies contribute a hint of spiciness, but somehow the finished product is both sweet and incredibly savory.I wouldn't think twice about returning to Loring Place. I'm looking forward to seeing what changes they'll make to the menu throughout the next few seasons!",1,,1

Our server was super dooper friendly and really lovely and accommodating. She showed us a VERY extensive cocktail, wine, and drink list. I was actually kind of shocked at how many drinks there were! She described a special cocktail for the day that sounded incredible but my friend and I decided to refrain from booze for the night. It was very clear to me, however, that this restaurant crafted very unique and interesting cocktails.My friend and I decided to split the zucchini ""fries"" and the crispy cauliflower to start. Both were excellent. Had great flavor, were made with fresh vegetables, and were both paired with excellent sauces.We also split the squash blossom pizza. It was just amazing. The cheese complimented the squash perfectly and the drizzled honey was perfect on top: not done with a heavy hand so it was the perfect amount of sweetness to pair with the squash. Just amazing. Every bite was better than the previous one. I can't wait to come back here and try the other menu items and some crafted cocktails!!",,,
95,Yeji P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,6,5.0,7/12/2017,"Great for: #1 vegetable-focused dishes, bright in flavors while still indulgent #2 ambience/atmosphere/decor #3 service/well-knowledged staffLoring place is easily one of the best dinner spots in Manhattan that can appeal to almost everyone. Come here for the vegetable small plates, and you won't leave unsatisfied in flavors, fullness, and a special food experience. It's tapas style, so can get a little on the pricier side, but I went with a group of 4 girls, and we ordered a total of 8 dishes, which came out to about $40 per person (tax and tip included). Plus, we were absolutely stuffed at the end! The fluke crudo (has a nice zingy flavor with citrus notes and mint + savory with a nice shiso leaf aroma), zucchini fries (lemony bright flavor that goes well with a cheesy but not heavy dip), roasted beets (one of the best beet dishes I've had--grilled fennel does not make it licorice-y), and the baked ricotta with roasted tomatoes and basil (SO MUCH UMAMI + house made sourdough; almost everyone at the table's top dish) can't be missed! Also great, if you're in the mood for some indulgent pasta, was the black pepper cavatappi (the duck in this dish was everything). As many things possible are made in house (breads, pastas, etc.)This was the second time I've dined at Loring Place, and both times have been so consistently spot on! The restaurant itself has two parts, a bar and a dining room. The bar is definitely more of a casual vibe than the dining room, but both have an intimate feel, making it great for dates, any one-on-ones, small groups, or even a dinner date with yourself at the bar. Also, the service is consistently excellent here, which just betters your dining experience. On another note, Chef Dan Kluger was actually part of a Zero Food Waste conference this year in New York, and his interest and commitment to sustainability definitely shows on his drink menus and his dishes.Bottom line: Loring place will surprise you with great flavor and texture combinations that make every small dish satisfying.",,,1

97,Akhila R.,"New York, NY",788,141,240,5.0,5/29/2017,"Wow, this place is amazing! I came here for dinner on a Friday night with three coworkers. We were able to get a spot on the community table immediately. The community table is honestly probably the best seat in the restaurant - it's very spacious and in its own secluded room, making it great for conversation in a quieter spot.I ordered the spare rib and tried the roasted duck, fried asparagus, and all three pastas (we all ate bites of each other's food, and they brought my coworker an extra pasta dish with everyone else's food, since his actual dish was still cooking and so he wouldn't have to wait without food). I also ordered the sweet gin cocktail and the honey cake dessert - I was very bloated by the end of the meal! Lol.We ordered the fried asparagus as an appetizer. I've never had fried asparagus before, but it was pretty good. It came with a lemon on the side and a Parmesan dip. The first bite was unusual since the lemon and the Parmesan dip together made a very strong flavor, but the bites after that were really good (just too much lemon in the first bite).The spare rib was amazing! The meat was so, so tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes went well with it. The roasted duck was the best duck I have ever eaten - very tender, smokey, and cooked perfectly. My 32-year old coworker said it's the best meat she's ever eaten. I would say it's up there! The pasta was also delicious but the meat was really exceptional - if you're deciding between the two, definitely go for the meat dish.The gin cocktail was delicious - there were three perfectly placed slices of sweet apple on my drink. I wish I remembered the flavors more, but I do remember I was satisfied with the drink.The honey cake - wow! It was amazing! I never eat sorbet or shortbread cookies - I don't like them - but the sorbet in this cake was perfect with the shortbread cookie, with just the right amount and right texture. The honey ice cream was exceptional. I paired it with a cappuccino and it went so well together - at this point I was too bloated to finish the last bite, so my coworker finished it for me! Haha.I was blown away by the quality of the food for the price! The meal ended up coming out to $70 - for spare rib, a cocktail, part of an appetizer, a dessert and a cappuccino, it was an amazing deal!",2,,2

The picture of the bar was at the end of the night but all the seats were taken for the majority of the time we were there. I liked the atmosphere which was elegant and encouraged conversation. The hostess was very pleasant. I've had friendlier bartenders. For drinks, we ordered soft (AKA ""virgin"") cocktails - the Maple (tall glass) and the Georgia (short glass with lavender sprig). Both were very good but I preferred the Maple. To eat, we shared a whole wheat pasta and, later, an apple and quince crostata. The pasta was ok, a little on the salty side and was a small portion. I enjoyed the crostata much better with special attention to the cinnamon whipped cream. I would have preferred even more whipped cream - yum! Overall nice time and good atmosphere.

We finally had to flag down a waiter to help us and the food ended up coming before we even had our drinks.

113,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,2/27/2017,"KenScale: 8.0/10ABC Kitchen has been one of the trailblazers in the New York dining scene when it comes to ""locavore"" food that focuses on vegetable-focused seasonal ingredients. The restaurant from acclaimed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten was led by his lieutenant Dan Kluger before the latter decided to make a name for himself with a restaurant of this own. I've had mixed experiences at ABC Kitchen (all the focus on seasonality didn't seem to always translate into flawless execution, although if I chose dishes carefully, I could have quite a satisfying meal), and wanted to see what chef Kluger is putting together as a coming out party for himself. Has he made a loud statement that he is now officially out of the mini ABC empire of Jean-Georges? Loring Place seemed to bring more or less the same types of dishes on my recent visit to the restaurant with my girlfriend and another couple. Still, the kitchen overall had a good number of solid to excellent dishes. Given that we were a party of four, we were able to order a lot of dishes for sharing. The best dishes from the dinner at Loring Place came from the spreads section. I swear I could eat everyday the exceptionally delicious hummus and radishes that you can dip with red wheat and sunflower seed crackers. Baked ricotta and roasted kabocha was another standout dish that I happily spread on top of the grilled sourdough breads. The vegetable starters were a bit of a mixed bag. Among the dishes that we sampled, my favorite was the refreshing leeks and pears salad with walnuts, yogurt and sherry vinaigrette that served as an ideal appetizer before getting over to heavier dishes. Wood grilled broccoli salad with orange, pistachios and mint was also very solid. On the other hand, I was definitely disappointed by the crispy, spiced cauliflower with Meyer lemon jam and chilies (there didn't seem to be enough emphasis on the crunchy texture of cauliflower and the overall flavor seemed somewhat off), and roasted winter squash with brussels sprouts and hazelnut vinaigrette could've toned down the seasoning a little bit. The larger dishes had some hits and misses too. I very much enjoyed the nicely cooked Pekin duck, although the kale, almonds and dried fruit compote that accompanied the meat had a bit too aggressive seasoning. Portfolio mushroom pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, cherry peppers and oregano was delicious, especially with the peppers that added a bit of spicy kick to the thin crust pie. On the other hand, one of our dining companions was supremely underwhelmed by the gemelli pasta with Maine crabmeat, parmesan, lemon and jalapenos and mint, and I did think that the dish had just too much going on in flavor without coming together as a coherent dish. For dessert, vanilla ice cream ""blizzard"" with pretzels, walnut toffee, chocolate cookie-fudge and Meyer lemon was definitely a standout dish that offered tons of pure decadence, while baked money bread with cranberries, syrup and housemade yogurt seemed to fall short of everyone's expectations. Loring Place, not surprisingly, is one of the hottest tickets in town (who wouldn't want to eat at the restaurant from a chef who used to work at fan favorite ABC Kitchen?), so just book way in advance or try your luck at the bar area. There is full bar with healthy-looking cocktail selections employing fruit and vegetable elements. I liked the chic, trendy vibe of the venue and suspect that the team behind Loring Place must've been pretty determined to one up the intimate vibe from ABC Kitchen. Loring Place isn't perfect but it still offers dishes that are delicious while also making you feel less guilty in terms of ingredients. I would love to see how the kitchen evolves over time to bring more novel ways of eating in a sustainable manner.",2,1,

122,Go B.,"Westwood, CA",62,258,9696,4.0,12/14/2016,"First time dining at a Dan Kluger restaurant and left impressed.(Was told from someone at NY Magazine at an event that this was one of the most anticipated restaurant openings this year.)Enjoyed dinner from start to finish.Reasonably priced dinner menu; Nothing stood out as being expensive.As with any 1st visit, usually go w/ the staff's recommendations, and Daniel was spot on w/ all his food and wine recommendations.Only regret - not ordering one of their pasta dishes, which looked great from watching the neighboring tables.Highlight dishes: Tuna tartare, fluke crudo, crispy chicken, dates pizza, and roasted short rib.No room for desserts, but ordered and took home their 'cookie box' for later that night (not sure if the cookies were made by them, but they were excellent).Excellent service.Would love to see a Chef's tasting menu here.Recommend.: 8 calendars",5,1,3
123,Gustavo S.,"New York, NY",81,15,36,4.0,12/17/2016,"FOOD: A good variety of items on the menu and everything extremely well executed. Pretty much everything you order (and my group ordered a lot) is very tasty, cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. Portions are not big so make sure you order a bunch. You are certainly in for a treat to your palate. HUGE (I mean HUGE) highlights are the Date Pizza and the Baked Ricotta. PRICE: The prices for the apps and snacks and even deserts are ok and most of them are a sharing size and you should order a bunch. You'll be happy with them if you do a ""tapas"" style of dinner and the price will allow that. That is what I think you should do.I can't say the same about the entres. If you order the main dishes you will end up with a little plate where a small piece of protein sits next to an almost inexistent ""side"", a big bill, a lot of hunger and regret (PS: I don't go into restaurants looking for ""deals"" nor or ""restaurant week menus"" because I truly believe in supporting the restaurant and paying a fair price for the food. The size of the main dishes here disappointed me so much that it's the only reason I can not give it a 5 star review)AMBIENCE: The place has a very modern clean look, very casual and happy. Feels very spacious for a NYC restaurant. Maybe a little bit more of treatment on the acoustics to absorb the loud talking.SERVICE: staff is extremely attentive and helpful, plates are always cleared and glasses are refilled in a timely manner, for a place that has been opened for one week only you feel that they were very well trained.I had a reservation for a later time (close to end of service) but I felt extremely welcome. I was never rushed at any point nor did I get the usual looks from the wait staff.BOTTOM LINE: If you are hungry and want a real substantial dinner that's not the place you would be looking for. If you want to enjoy small bites of different amazing pieces of food with friends that's the place for you.",3,,1
124,Virna M.,"New York, NY",55,18,0,3.0,8/22/2017,"Just ok. Large plate ran very small portion and small appetizers were just like snacks. Foods tasted not bad, but totally overpriced. Service was ok, but when my husband finished his cider and wanna order one more beer for main dish, but our server didn't come til we finished our main dishes. Very disappointed.",,,

126,Dan P.,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",146,287,439,5.0,6/24/2017,"Squeaked into the bar late evening, as the dining room had stopped serving, but they said they could still serve at the bar. An unusual wine list too (I'm so happy to see so many really interesting and creative wine lists on this trip, particularly the by the glass selections). Chose a glass of Ildewild ""The Flower"" Rose 2016, a blend of 51% Dolcetto, 25% Nebbiolo, and 24% Barbera. Now that, was a delicious wine.I decided to just order a couple of the small plates. Here, amazing, seriously amazing, crispy spiced cauliflower with meyer lemon jam and chilies. I love cauliflower. I need to play around with some more ideas. Something like this I could eat all the time.And a quite delicious tuna tartare, zingy with citrus, creamy with avocado - loved it. But that cauliflower.I was going to order a third plate, but by that point the ""hot kitchen"" had closed. I wouldn't normally order a dessert but, a) still slightly hungry, b) the first two dishes had been fabulous, and c) I love rhubarb, it's something I grew up on, and so a rhubarb crostata with buttermilk ice cream and mint just begged to be ordered. Yum. Wow. Anytime.This is my kind of food for bar snacking. If it's still there next time I'm in town, a return for dinner!",2,1,
127,Stacey C.,"Summit, NJ",244,256,107,5.0,2/20/2017,"We were fans of Dan Kluger from ABC Kitchen years ago.......he worked magic with vegetables.I loved that he used everything from the Green Market and only what was in season.Same goes for Loring Place.  No tomatoes or asparagus served in February.    We tried a delicious pizza and a lot of small plates..tuna tartare, roasted squash, pizza.....also a cookie tin for dessert.Cocktails were lovely as well, using domestic spirits (no Grey Goose....only Tito's and Barr Hill Gin).   Great space, great bar scene, very comfy and lots of seats.    Pleasant service.This place gets PACKED, even on a Sunday night. A great new addition to weird W. 8th Street.   So happy Chef Dan is back in town with his own place.   The food is amazing.LOVED Loring Place.",,,
128,Danny B.,"New York, NY",1,5,1,5.0,5/7/2018,"Loring Place is always on point with the food but tonight the service was impeccable. If you are looking for a cool place to take friends or family...this is your spot. The baked ricotta and whatever veggie ""fries"" are on the menu are a must (we loved the asparagus fries as much the squash fries, seasonal!). The pizzas, pastas and the short rib were all phenomenal. Highly recommend coming with a group and splitting as much as you can eat!",,,
129,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",125,291,1096,3.0,12/10/2016,"Yes, first to review! So excited to check out chef Dan Kluger's three-year in the making, solo project - Loring Place, on its opening night. As a huge fan of chef's previous stint at Union Square Cafe and ABC kitchen, I came with high hope (and hungry!). Yet, my experience tonight leaves something to desire. I will give more detail on that later. The good: locally-source, seasonal ingredients, simple and elegant interior design, attentive services. The not-so-good: wait staff seemed a bit inexperienced, for example, not very helpful when it comes to food/wine recommendations. Practically, there was none. There are wood-fired oven and grill in-house. Yet the food came out somehow lukewarm. By no means I am trying to be a hard-to-pleased A hole here. I believe the restaurant has great potential. And hence I am giving my honest feedback here. Now straight to the food. Menu has many veggie options which I dig. Favorite tonight was the wood grilled broccoli I accidentally got. It was accidental because what I ordered was the brussel sprouts and they gave me the wrong order :/  And I was idiot enough to not notice till second bite. Nonetheless, I really like it. It was grilled perfectly, had slightly smoky, nutty flavor to it; it was slightly soft and still moist, unlike most grilled veggies that were usually dried out. And the accompanied orange, kohlrabi and pistachio-mint dressing orchestrated quite well together. Highly recommend. For main, I opted for the Pekin Duck with tuscan kale, almonds and poached quince. This too, the veggie was the star. I love the mild nutty, sweet taste of the kale along with the crunchy almond. The duck though, while I do light the flavor and texture, I was expecting a crispier skin (may be because the name). Also the temperature was lukewarm. Not very appetizing in this cold weather. Also the wine by the glass is a bit disappointing compared to ABC Kitchen, for lack of better words. It was a 3.5 star on my book at this moment. I shall be back and give it a second try in the near future.",2,1,2
130,Bob B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0,5.0,10/13/2018,"I went here with some old high school friends at the last minute on a Friday night at prime time, and it was a really lovely experience all around. When we walked in we initially had doubts about finding a table with no reservations on what was clearly a very busy night. After we put our names in, we meandered outside and started game planning for an alternative. A gentleman who may have been the manager or host, actually came out and found us. He was warm, not pushy, and said ""I hope you're still joining us for dinner. We'll have a table for you in two minutes."" The decor is modern and bright, with an open flow and romantic low lighting. Even before we ordered, I spied a couple in the corner smiling wide-eyed with each spoonful of a dessert in front of them. They were having a food moment- a good sign. Another good sign came in the form of the dirty martini I ordered. This is usually my litmus test for how a restaurant experience will go.  You'd think this isn't such a big deal, but the chemistry of vodka to olive juice salinity to chilled glass is actually nuanced. Not everyone gets it right. They did. I'll preface the food description by saying this: how excited can I get about dishes I've had a thousand times? The answer? Very. Do you know how many crudos or ceviches I've had in my lifetime? That's rhetorical; I've had a whole lot. The fluke crudo was fresh with wonderful pops of citrus and heat, and the texture was outstanding. Supple and creamy, with a satisfying crunch from the radish as well as what I can sadly only describe as ""crunchy things"". It might have been puffed rice. Or not. Ask them. For my entree I had a ricotta cavatelli with duck, which was tangy and peppery with perfectly dense and chewy pieces of cavatelli and paired perfectly with a velvety red Nebbiolo. Both dishes were original and memorable, and the service was attentive and genuine. Speaking of service, let me rewind a moment. Before we were even served the gentlemen of the warm not pushy invite, returned to the table with a box of cookies which he presented to me. I'd joked with him earlier that he shouldn't be insulted if I make an abrupt dash out of the restaurant, as my wife is nine months pregnant and due at any moment. The cookies were a gift for her (she was home taking it easy). That's just good, thoughtful, generous service, folks. I saved the cookies for my wife and she was touched. For us, we had a luscious panna cotta with roasted plums and their tongue-in-cheek version of a Hostess Cupcake, which was not only chocolatey deliciousness but just good fun. Everyone at the table was in great spirits and the compliments about Loring Place were effusive. It's only now, after the fact, that I learned about their executive chef Dan Kluger, who as it turns out is no slouch in the culinary world. He's a James Beard award winner. So, yeah, that explains a lot. Afterwards, on the way down the street we were still talking about the meal when one of the hostesses came out after us. My forgetful friend had left his credit card on the table and she wanted to get it back to him. That's good service, folks.",,,
131,Noor S.,"New York, NY",20,220,107,5.0,7/24/2017,I've eaten here twice for brunch and there isn't anything I didnt like. I suggest to order a couple of plates and share with others so that you sample everything. Make a reservation to guarantee a table. Great service and food!,,,
132,Andrea P.,"San Diego, CA",39,66,6,5.0,1/29/2018,This is my favorite spot in NYC! Excellent food & perfect service. The menu is well priced - wine list is spendy but great selection. I plan to visit again soon!,,,
133,Eric L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,175,0,3.0,4/24/2018,"Sat at a table next to the bar, was very narrow and didn't really seem like enough room.  But managed to have a couple of appetizers and drinks.  Service was prompt but lacked a smile, didn't personally care but it does make a difference to some folks.  A little bright for a date, more like a place to have dinner.  Seemed like a touristy hotel crowd",,,
134,Jay K.,"Manhattan, NY",5,88,0,2.0,2/16/2018,"Where the food should have been the star of the show, it simply wasn't very memorable. After leaving ABC Kitchen, Chef Dan Kluger opened his first restaurant, with a menu that was very similar in feel. Elements of American fare, elements of Italian, and plenty of veggies at the center. Only these components didn't fuse together as they do more organically at ABC. We left having been lost in a fog of underwhelming veggie preparations, pastas with flavors that just didn't seem to work, and a pizza that ticked all the wrong boxes. Many diners may come and go, paying less attention to the food, and fulfilled (or fooled) by the upscale ambiance and trendy vibe of this Greenwich village hangout. But if you're out to dine with food as your focus, you'll be easily disappointed by the disconnectedness of this menu and dining experience.",,,
135,Maya M.,"Manhattan, NY",27,54,1,3.0,8/6/2017,"Pros: tasty, trendy, nice decor (in line with ABC kitchen).  I recommend the spinach pizza, bursting with flavor and freshness.Cons: snobby service, long wait times (to be seated and to be served), over priced.  $12 for 5 pieces of cauliflower?  Give me a break! The duck cavatappi was over-cooked and bland, mostly just pasta.",,,

137,Nikita S.,"New York, NY",129,16,122,5.0,12/4/2017,"I simply love this place.  I've been twice, and both times have been awesome.  Their seasonal menu is full of vegetarian options.  As a vegetarian who has tried most of the upscale vegetarian restaurants in the city, I would rank this as one of my favorites (probably alongside ABCV).  It's hard to say what I loved the most as the menu changes, but every category has absolutely delicious options.  This was one place that the meal just got progressively better as it went on!",2,,
138,B B.,"New York, NY",489,950,703,4.0,6/17/2018,"The place was a bit empty for dinner, but the food was quite lovely. The pastas are delicious. The kale salad was pretty good. Beets are delicious.",,,
139,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",50,140,439,4.0,1/12/2017,"So we went here because the chef from ABC kitchen abandoned ship and open up this place. About a month into Its opening, the place was packed. We were able to wait 15-20 min for bar stools to open up and ate there for the night. Nice vibe but acoustics drown out your conversation as the place gets busier.For the food, the ricotta bread is solid and hearty, packing some nice, intense heat.  Worth the money on this dish. The wifey ordered her fave, tuna tartare which I'm so sick of, but wound up being my favorite dish. The spices, lemon juice, and herbs allowed me to taste all the local freshness and really was refreshing. Also had the fluke which was aiiight. Got the mushroom pizza which was good but had an awkward tobasco scent coming from it which kind of ghettofied it.  The entree was the burger which was filling but no wow factor. The winner which was very similar to the ice cream popcorn dessert as ABC Kitchen was the blizzard dessert. Also tried the chocolate bar which was solid with its caramel hazelnut ganache.The manager stopped by as we mentioned how busy it was and how we felt it was tough to talk and she kindly treated us to dessert and white port wine. All in all, good place for sharing plates and dessert.",,,

The grandma style pizza left a little to be desired, as it lacked all that much flavor, but this was more than made up for by how good our other dishes were. The cheddar waffles & eggs was amazing. The cherry pepper hollandaise was unique and flavorful. The crunchy French toast was soft and custardy in the middle with a delicious cinnamon sugar crumble on the outside.",,,
143,William R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,3/27/2018,"Took my girlfriend on a date here on a Monday night. We arrived at 8:15pm for a 8:30pm reservation but didn't get seated until closer to 8:50pm. Once we were seated, the experience was amazing. We split the crispy cauliflower and the grain salad for appetizers which were both amazing. We came here for the Burger after seeing it on Infatuation's list of the new best burgers in the city. The burger was good just a little underwhelming. We also split the Brussels Sprout Pizza, which was 10/10. Hands down the favorite thing we ate that night. Good spot for a date, good atmosphere, tables aren't too close together.",,,
144,Danielle R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,9/21/2017,"I had dinner at Loring Place with my dad on 9/21. This was my second time dining. Scene / Atmosphere: The place is always completely full - very hard to get a reservation and rightfully so, because it's that good. The decor is elegantly simple. The dim lighting creates a beautiful ambiance. The place is always bustling with conversation, but the noise level is not off-putting. Drinks: My dad had the Chardonnay, which he really enjoyed. Apparently, Loring Place is the only restaurant in the U.S. to carry it. I had the Cabernet Sauvignon which was surprisingly fruity for a Cab, but paired nicely with everything we ordered. Food: - Wood Grilled Broccoli Salad: This was my favorite item that we ordered. The broccoli is perfectly cooked and tossed with a bunch of interesting and flavorful ingredients. Very tasty. - Grilled Strawberries & Heirloom Tomatoes: Both the strawberries and heirloom tomatoes were super fresh. - Market Lettuces: The sesame citrus vinaigrette was out of this world. I want to learn how to make it! Service: Our waiter was super attentive and knowledgable. Price: Expensive, but expected, because...Dan Kluger. Overall: I'd definitely recommend Loring Place for dinner. Great upscale, farm to table option in Greenwich Village / West Village.",,,

148,Callie G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,10,0,2.0,7/21/2018,"I do not understand the great reviews for this place at all. Granted, in the two times that I've been there, my food has never looked like the photos other diners have posted. Two off nights? One on a Saturday and one on a Wednesday? The waitress was clueless to the point that the manager (who was lovely!) came over and intercepted what he knew was going wrong. (First visit, the second the service was...serviceable.) It's a very nice room(s)--we sat in back the second time, in front the first. Back is much quieter, front is much nicer. Everything on the menu sounded exciting the first time; second time we were wary. I won't even address the food the first night it was that bad. Baked ricotta was okay but the sugar snap pease were heinously overcooked and over dressed. Who wants a cheese like pecorino on sugar snaps? I love ricotta pasta and cavatelli, but the ricotta cavatelli with duck was almost inedible. The duck was tough, the pasta was raw (and I love el dente pasta, I mean RAW) and the sauce was so salty it was impossible to eat. Thought the burger would be safe. Were wrong. And one of us made the horrible mistake of having the halibut. Honestly, I don't get the buzz and hype.",,,
149,Cabalistic A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,77,0,3.0,2/7/2018,"The food is decent but not particularly creative. A lot of it is versions of common things like pizza and cheeseburgers, but they remain essentially just as greasy as the originals. Service is kind of blase; a little pushy on the drinks, but not unpleasant at all. Atmosphere is a bit like a scene - feels like outdated fancy; somewhat on the loud side, but not the worst I've seen in the City. Some items are expensive, some are not too bad, none of them really worth the price. Overall I don't see what the hype is about this place, except if maybe the type of atmosphere was your thing, or if it used to be a lot better when it opened.",,,

BEATNIK Industry Standard Vodka, Amara, Blood Orange, Honey, Sparkling Soda - beautiful and delicious. BUTTERNUT ""FRIES"" with lemon-parmesan dressing - super delicious, light crispy batter, loved the dipping sauce. CRISPY, SPICED CAULIFLOWER with meyer lemon jam and chilies - another incredibly light, textured cauliflower with a depth of flavor.

WOOD GRILLED BROCCOLI SALAD orange, pistachios and mint  - star of the show! Wood-grilled flavor with a yummy yogurt/mayo type sauce. The crunch of the pistachios and refreshing mint really made this outstanding. WHOLE WHEAT SPAGHETTI spinach, parmesan, basil and chilies  - a bit spicy for my taste, but excellent also with tons of spinach so you feel healthy eating it.

160,Maria G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,80,32,3.0,8/29/2018,"Arrived early, before my companion & was told to ""wait by the bar"" so I did. Two bartenders ignored me despite many empty seats. I finally got the attention of a third and was given a wine & cocktail menu. The cocktails were interesting & inventive. I ordered a Paloma which was watery and seemed to lack alcohol. My companion found the strawberry cocktail much too sweet & also lacking in the alcohol department. The restaurant is large & the decor, hip. The kitchen is visible which is always fun to me. We were seated in the back of the space behind the server station. I really felt like we, along with other tables of single women, were relegated to restaurant Siberia. We shared the fried cauliflower appetizer which was crispy & delicious. Unfortunately, the sweet lemon curd it sat upon just didn't work. The portion is very small for $16.00. We then shared the pacceri pasta & zucchini flower pizza. The pasta was excellent - sweet cherry tomatoes & fresh basil bursting with flavor. The pizza wasn't as good. The dough was light but soggy in the center & the star, the zucchini flowers, were cooked down to mush & completely overpowered by the chili infused honey. We also shared a vanilla sunday which was vanilla soft serve with a burnt carmelly flavor & crunchy bits. By the third bite, it was enough. Coffee was lukewarm - should have just gone across to Stumptown. One of the best parts of the evening was our waiter. He was friendly, efficient,patient & really knew the menu, ingredients & preparation details which was important because my companion has some food sensitivities.

163,King K.,"New York, NY",1,198,0,4.0,10/22/2017,"Very good experience. Beautiful dining room with a casual feel to it. It's definitely a restaurant that belongs in a different neighborhood, but it's great that it's in a neighborhood where there's not as many upper scale dining restaurants. The burger was very good, but thought it was a little overhyped. Everything was great, but I ordered the broccoli, and it was literally just a huge piece of broccoli with cheese on it. Got 5 dishes, everything was great, but DO NOT SPEND 15 BUCKS ON A PIECE OF BROCCOLI!",,,
164,Isabel G.,"New York, NY",362,51,32,5.0,7/19/2017,"Been here twice and all I can say is amazing food!!! The service and and restaurant itself also wonderful (although a bit on the dark side for my preference). Skip the dessert though, its underwhelming.My top food recommendations: fluke crudo, grilled zucchini (so inventive and delicious), grandma pie, eggplant appetizer (one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had), gemelli (very cool clam pasta).Food recommendations to skip: tuna tartare was pretty underwhelming and the asparagus fries I had on the first visit were also not excellent. Finally, I've tried 3 of their desserts. The famous blizzard I did not enjoy at all I think the lemon has no place in the dessert. The ice box cake isn't like any ice box cake I've ever had so while it was interesting, I didn't love it. The strawberry short cake was good but again not a home run. You should really try and go here for some delicious food and service!!",,,

We debated if we have room for desert and luckily decided to go for the Vanilla Sundae with toffee walnuts, which turned out to be decadently good. Service was professional but not too smiley. Will definitely be back!",,,
167,Romy M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,13,0,5.0,12/27/2017,"Really honestly one of the best places I've been in a while. With the chef of abc kitchen and amazing pastry chefs Loring Place creates a fun and delicious dining experience. The food has at least 10 levels of flavor in every bite. Its amazing decor and location give you a perfect place to dine from 12 pm on. It is impossible to get in after 1pm and after 6:30pm so go for brunch right when it opens at 12 or make a reservation in advance. There burgers, broccoli with orange curd, and Cesar salad are just simple and classic dishes with a abc kitchen twist.",,,
168,Rachel G.,"Valhalla, NY",9,26,0,4.0,4/5/2018,"This place has been high on my list to try in NYC for a while and we were happy to get a reservation during restaurant week. The space was inviting and clean without being too sterile. Between us we had the salmon crudo & roasted beets for starters and both had the wood grilled chicken with romesco for a main. They were all excellent and flavor filled. They know what they're doing when it comes to bringing out the freshness & flavors of veggies, we were impressed. For dessert, the cream sundae and apple bread pudding. Good but nothing particularly exciting. The only issue was with our service. Our server was nice and initially attentive however after our starters she became scarce. We weren't checked on or asked how things were, only occasionally having someone from the bar at the table to serve the wine pairings. After entrees were served we didn't see someone again for close to 25 mins. After plates were cleared we again waited quite a while for someone to ask about dessert, coffee etc. Finally a gentlemen (not our original server, she was long gone) dropped off our desserts that had been chosen at the beginning of the meal. I felt pretty neglected for the level of the restaurant and price tag. It was mid afternoon and not very busy. The meal itself was enjoyable and I would definitely go back and hope for a bit more on the service side.",,,
169,Chris N.,"New York, NY",0,13,3,3.0,12/15/2017,"Not terribly impressed. Went for a friend's birthday earlier this week.  This highlight was the cocktails, many of which were made with fresh juices (though not terribly strong.)  I had the whole grain pasta, and the ice cream sundae for dessert.  Pasta was ok, and sundae not the best.  We did share some appetizers, including a beet dish and ricotta dish which were very good, and my friends all enjoyed their food.  It could have been that I just didn't order the best items on the menu.  I would probably go back if some friends wanted to go but wouldn't seek it out.",,,
170,B K.,"New York, NY",58,328,12,5.0,8/12/2017,"Every now and then a place truly wows me with its innovation and service, and Loring place did just that! For starters, my dining companions were an hour late due to the lovely nyc subways, and I fully expected the restaurant not to accommodate us. Instead, they were gracious and lovely and kind and found us a place to eat! Then the food truly impressed me- we got the bread with home made butter (it was so fresh there were bits of milk in there), the zucchini fries (crispy without being greasy) and broccoli ( a deep wooded flavor). We then got the spicy meatball pizza and a pasta and both were wonderful. Unfortunately we were too full for dessert, but I imagine it would have been great! I highly recommend this restaurant.",1,,1

173,Yerania S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,2.0,8/25/2018,"More like ""Boring Place""... food was beyond under whelming, put me in a bad mood actually. Decore was gorgeous, it made me anticipate that the food would be just as alluring, but again i was dissapointed. The waiter acted as though we were about to have a 5 star meal experience but, it was just alot of prepping and extra talk. We ordered the roasted beet salad, which instead of fresh salad tasting felt like we were eating bran flake cerial with beats on the side. Needed more citrus and more beets, less crappy crunch flakes, what ever the hell that was? It was annoying. Then we had the broccoli salad which was ok... tasted like i spent a little too long next to the fire pit a pow wow! Due to the over whlming liquid smome taste on the broccoli.The fluke was another ""fluke"" needed more citrus and no thank you, i dont enjoy raw fish with morning cereal!  There was what seemed to be rice crispy cereal sprinkled all over the damn thang! What the fuck is up with the half a pound of crunchy crap ontop of all my ""fresh veggies????? The best thing was the pizza! And thats all folks! Why the hell is everyone raving? Its like they took farm to table Italian dishes and took the ""italian"" out ??? Yea! Exactly im confused as well.",,,
174,Chris C.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,20,0,5.0,4/24/2018,"Excellent food especially their black bass and short rib.  We also had a private event there, and the bigger menu was filling and satisfying with excellent service.",,,
175,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",37,104,30,4.0,1/17/2017,"Everyone at our table of 7 had a wonderful evening at Loring Place this past Saturday. Overall it deserves praise for its friendly and welcoming decor and very nice clean and healthy food. It is a little over a month old and there are a few ticks that Chef/Owner Dan Kluger who is near the top of the NYC constellation -he has serious chops and props from his extensive experience at the Union Square Cafe,Tabla and most recently as head honcho at ABC Kitchen and Cocina- should take heed of.Everything that was served at our table was pleasing to eye and palate. Our group decided to do family style sharing of the plates. We shared a few orders of following starters:Baked Ricotta and Kabocha (squash) which was rich and dippable.Fluke Crudo with Citrus Chiles and Rye was superb and one of the best raw fish dishes ever!Brussel Sprouts Apple Avocado Honey Vinaigrette. The sprouts were cooked a few times to tone them down and fit nicely in the melange.A very fresh and healthy Chopped Salad and some crispy cauliflower. Veggies are one of the specialties of house and they were quite nice.We followed with a Pizza and Pasta Course. There was a round of whole wheat spaghetti in a spicy basil chile sauce that stayed true to Italy and not Thailand. A superb Ricotta Agnolotti in a Meyer lemon butter sauce that felt like a bon bon of pasta going down. It was delicious and we did not miss the shaved truffle option which you need a good year on Wall Street to afford.The Pizzas were small but very nicely done. Between the Date and Bacon Pizza and the Portobello, Mozz , and Cherry Tomato, I thought the later was the better of the two. It captured the wood flavor of the oven which also permeated the room with a wonderful aromaIf all of this wasn't enough, and it wasn't, we went on to what the menu calls  some large plates of lamb chops, roasted scallops, sea trout, and suckling pig. Some of these are cooked in the wood oven or grilled over wood imparting them with wonderful wood flavor. The scallops were nicely pan roasted as advertised.Now if you think we were on road to the vomitorium after all this deliciousness you'd be mistaken. And this brings me to the principal gripe about Loring Place; the portions for the most part are too small, skimpy if you will. The large plates are in fact small plates and the small plates are in fact Tapas plates and not of the sit down restaurant type, but, more like the Spanish Bar type; very, very small.  Our group, by the way, were by no means power eaters, but,we could have ordered many more dishes. And we did. We ended the repast with desserts. The most pleasing of which was the Blizzard  a high end ice cream sundae concoction. There was a deconstruction of the Hostess Cupcake that was alright and the $14 cookie box was nothing special. It was kind of like the freebies that some restaurants  give you at the end of your meal before the days of sky high rents and food prices. The service was very nice and the we were very pleased with all the attention heaped on our table during the first dining hour but the restaurant filled up by 8 pm and the service became chaotic and the plates and people where out of step.  At this point the ""Danny Meyer style"" friendliness wore out.All in all Loring Place is a ultra nice New York City Playground for foodies. It is friendly sophisticated and unpretentious. But in order to pack the house every night to succeed, they need to figure out whether the small plate/tapas concept,which is a little worn, can work here.",2,,1
176,Jennifer P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0,5.0,2/10/2017,"I have been a huge fan of Chef Dan Kluger for years and have been waiting patiently for Loring Place to open. Having dined there several times now, I am happy to say it was worth the wait. The dishes are largely vegetable driven, though it's by no means vegetarian. The menu is designed for sharing, which I highly recommend. The bar provides ample seating and clever cocktails, so it's a great spot for a marathon dinner, or a few cocktails with friends. Every member of the staff is friendly and super knowledgeable. I have celiac (gluten free) so I often dread the long explanations I have to provide about cross contamination, etc. Every time I've dined at Loring Place, the server or bartender has expertly guided me through the menu and I've found myself in capable hands.",1,,
177,Meghan B.,"Hoboken, NJ",54,5,0,5.0,2/9/2017,"Amazing experience!! Met here with a friend for drinks on a Wednesday night at 8pm and it was bustling and had great energy! We started with cocktails in the bar, while we waited for bar seats to be available. There is a great amount standing room and a small ledge for drinks to rest on while you stand and wait. Loved my cocktail, the Last Word, the bar tenders were delightful and eager to help serve drinks. Then we were seated at the bar counter. The service continued to be impeccable and amazing atmosphere! We asked the server for their recommendations, and they did not disappoint! We made a meal out of small plates, including: cauliflower, ricotta, and grains salad. All the flavors, temperatures, special presentation were on point. We capped it off with the Blizzard dessert! All was amazing and I can't wait to come back!",1,,

A bit noisier than I'd like, and a tad expensive, but my black sea bass was absolutely outstanding, as was the adventurous dessert (we tried semifreddo, which was like frozen mousse or extra creamy ice cream), plus the service was great (we were a little underdressed, but the staff never rushed or neglected us at all). Will definitely go back.",,,

180,Peggy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,43,0,3.0,1/10/2017,"My overall impression of Loring Place is that they know how to do food, but have little understanding of the mechanics of front-of-house and seating on time. My party of four had a 10:30pm dinner reservation on a Friday. Yes, I'm aware it was a Friday at a popular restaurant in NYC. Yes, I'm aware that can mean waiting and crowded areas. But this was above and beyond that. We arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation time, and were told that a few tables would be finishing up dessert, so we'd be seated shortly. Another group of four walked in minutes after us, also with a 10:30 reservation time. After the whole lot of us waited for about 15 minutes, that second group was taken to a table. We were ignored by the no fewer than five people behind the host stand. After another 10 or so minutes and the slowest and most awkward walk with a host ever, we were seated... at a comically large table that easily could have accommodated 8 people. There are no soft surfaces in the dining room whatsoever, so we could barely hear each other speak over the din of the room. Looking around, I also noticed a booth table that could have easily fit five with only two people at it. It was very odd. We ordered dishes to share, which was great until I couldn't reach things that had been set in the middle of our oversized table. We had the butternut squash fries, which are fried, but aren't really properly described by the moniker 'fries,' the cauliflower, the broccoli, the brussels sprouts, and the bread and butter. All tasty enough, but not really sized for sharing. Nothing that I would feel it necessary to come back for. The appetizers also all came out before our cocktails, which was odd, and the poor guy who was pouring our water was having trouble because the mouth of the pitcher and the opening of the glasses weren't shapes that cooperated with one another or something. We ended up with significant spills on our table three times, which seemed like an unreasonable number of times to just blame on him. Otherwise, our waiter was attentive, and the cocktails were interesting.My boyfriend and I also shared the brussels sprouts pizza, which was amazing, and the duck pasta, which did have a lot of duck, but didn't amaze me.I was stoked to try the desserts, but it was already about 12:30 by the time we even got those menus, and I was going to fall asleep on the table, so we passed. I think I will also pass on putting any work into returning to Loring Place.",2,1,
181,Julio I.,"New York, NY",2,25,0,3.0,3/24/2017,"Party of 3, Friday night, communal table, no reservation.Food 65%Ricotta and Kabocha - comfort food, creamy, subtle, sweet. surprisingly good.Leaks and Pears - bright plate with a tart and creamy finish, the yogurt pulls the flavors together, pears offer textureWhole Wheat Spaghetti - it's a genius move to use whole wheat, the texture adds a subtle dimension to the very straightforward dish, moderate spice, excellently executedGemelli Pasta - very basic similar to mac n' cheese (no offense meant), but solid sharp flavor Scallops - 4 creamy on-point scallops with apple garnish and puree, excellent dish; however this is clearly not a ""large"" plate.Cheeseburger - there was something tangy in the sauce that didn't play well with the rest of the ingredients...unfortunately, this does not rank in the top NYC burgers for me...Similar to ABC kitchen, for some reason most of the dishes were spicy on some level. But unlike ABC, Loring place executes spice with more control and restraint. I do wonder though why the heavy reliance on spice when the other flavors stand well on their own...Overall a decent restaurant with great service. But as above, it's just a-ok.",,,

183,Julius P.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,2.0,7/1/2017,"More like Boring Place. After a friend of mine did some food photography here, I finally decided to check it out. Since moving to New York from Chicago, my taste buds have been exposed to just about everything edible, and with that comes the burden of knowledge and experience. Loring Place isn't a bad restaurant, it's just not that great. Comparatively speaking, it's probably not worth trying. Short story, the savory dishes are underwhelming. The flavors fall flat, and are sometimes dissonant.  If you order the cheeseburger you will know what I mean firsthand. Please don't order the cheeseburger.  Despite the letdowns, I will say the dessert is absolutely spectacular.  If you must go, go for dessert. If you're in the village, there are a dozen restaurants that easily eclipse this place. Do your homework and you'll be fine.",2,1,1
184,K. D.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,719,0,3.0,9/14/2017,"I liked Loring Place enough, but I think I need to come back. Almost every dish we tried was overpowered with lemon and/or mint. And I like both! It was just a little too much (every dish was so bright), and I think if I had ordered differently I might have liked the meal more.These are the dishes I can remember ordering:Baked ricotta with cherry tomatoes, chilies, and grilled sourdough - our favoriteZucchini ""fries"" with lemon-parmesan dressingHeirloom tomatoes with parmesan croutons, lemon, herbsCheeseburgerWhole wheat toad-in-a-hole - liked this dish as well Ice cream sundae w/ pretzels, walnut toffee, lemon and chocolate-cookie fudge - loved this.Chocolate hostess cupcake -not our favorite",,,
185,Julie S.,"New York, NY",3,64,66,4.0,10/2/2017,"Really love the food, ambiance and service here. Certain aspects definitely remind me of chef Dan Kluger's previous gig at ABC Kitchen i.e. small plates with plenty of flavorful veggie options. The cocktails are great but if that's not your thing, the wine list is well curated as well. One of the rare places where I found that the outstanding appetizers stood up to the entrees as well. The fish dishes in particular are perfectly cooked and quite tasty. If you manage to snag a table, I highly recommend Loring Place.Oct 17: Knocking a star off to 4. Food and cocktails are fantastic (and don't forget about that sundae). However, the last 2 times I came on a Friday/Saturday night, I waited 30-45m for my table with a reservation. Keep in mind I waited 45m for a 9:30 reservation on a Friday so I sat down to dinner at 10:15.

The short ribs were incredible as well. There actually was not a bad thing we tried. All of the food was incredible from a taste, texture, temperature perspective as well. These dishes had depth.

Zucchini blossoms are only in season for a short while so we ordered them and they were excellent!  I love short ribs but hesitate to order them at restaurants because they are always fatty, even when your waiter tells you they're not.
