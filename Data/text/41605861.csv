It's huge place that even has swimming pool.They do have skating  school in many different hours almost everyday. Very flexible hours for Group classes. All group lesson are seven or eight sessions with reasonable price. I think all group has 12 studentThey also have private lessons which a little bit expensive but it's definitely with it. Privet lessons are for 2 only it's limited to to two person either you can be 2 or can share it some body if you know anybody that they want to learn skating.They have skate shop  and they do measure your foot /or your kids and tell you the right size for you. Also they do sharpen the blades.  Price range is fom $89 to $200. Also they do have a little restaurant that serve pizza  and some snacks for the kids which is cool",3,,2
1,Lyss C.,"Elmhurst, NY",92,104,66,1.0,11/10/2018,"This is a review for the new Parent & Me 3-6yo class. I will revise my review everntually, this is just for information. The information on the flier is misleading. It's not bad but Parents do *not* receive ice skating instruction. Also they don't give refunds if you chose the wrong class.I wanted to learn ice skating with my 5yo. This is NOT the class for that. So any parents who have never skated before, this isn't the place to learn, they only concentrate on the kids. Not you, lol. Make sure you already know how to skate before taking this class. Lol. The Parent and Me costs $262 as opposed to the $175 for better instruction in the Snowplow Sam classesAlso, we took two classes and my 5yo has learned nothing. This age should be lowered to age 2.5-3yo. I feel like I wasted my money in doing this.",,,

Updated review",The rink is ok.  Stinky and filthy bathrooms (they have the ice rink safe guards cleaning the bathrooms!). The safe guards do not keep the center ice free of beginners and newbie skaters who are falling all over the place). It's very frustrating.,,,

4,Berra M.,"Flushing, NY",26,18,28,5.0,1/15/2018,Remember if its holidays there is a long wait online for ice scating. But the stuff is very professional and fast.  They would help you to go faster.Most stuff are helpful and friendly. I prefer to go before noon because afternoon is very crowded .No parking lot near by but its about 4 minutes away if u are lucky you can fined a soot under the one wyk expressway. There is a nyc parks enforcements guys around they really are rude soo becareful for them they bother you if you wait in by the door with tour car . Avoid this problem park your car before droppig of the kiddsIts good for the kids they have fun also they have a little cafe even even pizza. There is enough restroom for man and women. Public session is from 10:30 am to 5:15 pm. Dou to holidays it may change the times,4,,4

I recommend a rink in the city for couples, friends, etc. because it is kind of washed up, in much need of upgrading. However, it is clean, for the most part. The bathroom is decent too. The food stand is just okay and to be expected of a family recreational facility.",5,1,2
7,Hui L.,"Woodside, NY",51,420,1209,4.0,1/11/2016,Great value for your money! The website had exact instructions on how to get here from the Mets-Willets Point stop of the 7 train. When my friends arrived here around 10:30am there were only a few people on the ice. Which was great for us since we were like fawns learning how to walk properly.$6 admission on weekdays and $5 for skate rental isn't a bad price at all. The lockers are one-time use only so make sure you have everything you need before you close it! The skates really smell. But you can't really expect a brand new pair of skates given how cheap it is to rent a pair for the entire time you're skating. Make sure to lace them up tight! Dress warmly and wear gloves and a hat! It's really cold there. It feels like winter year round here!It's only a 15 minute walk to Downtown Flushing where you can warm up by eating a nice warm bowl of noodles in soup.,3,,

When you come during morning hours before kids are let out from classes, there will be less people skating here but those who are skating here are good at what they do. I, on the other hand, will be struggling along the sidelines. Also, the times when I come, it seems like the ice was cleaned (I don't actually know the real term for this but IT'S SUCH SMOOTH ICE) - and it's great. It's also not too expensive which is a plus!",2,,

Gift shop located on premises *Make Sure You Dress Warm* it's FREEZING in here! Socks is a must!!! ... Attended a Birthday party here Decorations were wonderful, too bad everything is done yourself, the skating rink does not provide any decorations.

11,Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",850,486,9147,4.0,3/9/2015,"Great indoor ice skating arena!  In 2008 they permanently closed the original Worlds fair ice skating rink in Flushing Meadows park where I skated as a young lad. I can still remember lacing up my Bauer hockey skates. This newer rink is Great!This rink is inexpensive - $9 admission on weekends and $6 on weekdays, $5 to rent skates, word of caution, the skates are heavy! The rink has alot to offer, skating lessons are available and If your child is into getting body checked on the ice up against the boards, you're in luck. Hockey teams are available for you to join for a fee.The rink has locker rentals, a skate shop and a small food court. You can book a private room for birthday parties as well. I came here for a friends daughter's birthday party, all the kids had a fun time and the price included a 30 minute private coaching/skating session on the ice with our party group.If you're tired of skating or not in the skating mood. The 2nd floor has ample seating if you just want to sit and watch the skaters in the rink.Like I said earlier for the price you can't beat it, but don't think you'll be speed skating around the rink. There are many little kids skating in each and every direction.  So yes, yield to the children and don't show off your skating prowess because in the big scheme of things nobody really cares except you! Slow down or the skating guards will throw you out!If you know how to skate this is also a great place to take that special someone in the hopes of forming a love connection.  You could show them how to skate while holding their hand while circling around the rink, that's how I met Mrs TC at the old rink, technique! :) Open all year around with plenty of parking around the area.

It is a decent sized rink, also you have a lot of parking. Upstairs is also a swimming pool. There is also a ice hockey team you can join if you would like. They have lockers for your stuff, you should bring some quarters for that. Although since it is in Flushing, it is crowded. Lots of kids, adults and people who don't really know how to skate. So don't expect to go too fast.",,,

15,Elina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,28,30,4.0,6/8/2016,"The World Ice Arena is surely a reasonable place in terms of pricing, especially when compared to ice rinks in Manhattan! It's only a 15 minute walk from the Mets-Willets Point station and is located in the beautiful Flushing Meadows Park.We came here on a Monday afternoon and payed $22 for two people, including skate rentals. The skates and the laces were visibly worn out, however, and we had to tighten them many times since the laces kept coming loose. I advice to bring your own skates for comfort. You can also spend 75 cents on a locker to store your things while skating. The rink itself is fairly large but the center was occupied with little kids practicing. There were few people since it was a weekday but I imagine it can get crowded on the weekends. The staff is attentive and always helped my boyfriend get up when he lost his balance. Using cell phones is not allowed while ice skating. Definitely recommend this place for its affordability and location convenience.",1,,1
16,Cindy L.,"Murray Hill, Queens, NY",171,23,111,3.0,2/1/2016,"The price on weekends  ($9 for admission and $5 rentals) is cheap compared to the other rinks in the city and the rink is located right next to the 7-train with plenty of parking. This makes this rink very accessible and also, very popular so it can get very crowded on weekends during the winter. The rink itself is a bit small. One thing that really bugged me though was the quality and cleanliness of the skates. I wish the laces didn't smell like wet rags all the time. When I returned the skates, the employees barely put any disinfectant inside! Gross! Nevertheless, you can't beat the price. So if you're planning to come here, I would suggest bringing hand-sanitizer since there aren't a lot of bathrooms, Trust me, after touching the skates, you're going to want to wash your hands. Also, try to eat before coming because the food is slightly overpriced but you have to eat, a hotdog or a slice of pizza is $2.50.",3,1,
17,Beth S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,11,0,5.0,2/25/2017,"Nice place to skate. I come here pretty regularly.

The guy, Bob, who runs the pro shop was super helpful, and helped me pick a pair of skates that worked for me. He also sharpened them and helped punch out some areas I was experiencing rub in the skates against my ankles free of charge. The arena was nice, but definitely crowded with a lot of kids especially, which was to be expected on a Sunday afternoon. Definitely had to dodge a lot of kids who were beefing it on the ice, but all in all a good time.",,,1

23,Dee F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,1/16/2017,"It is the worst ice skating rink I've ever been on. It is very disorganized. The rental service has a ridiculous procedure that results in a hoard of people in socks crowding the counter and either taking shoes or skates off or putting shoes or skates on, while on a narrow strip of rug provided supposedly to avoid wet and icy puddles on the floor elsewhere. The rental skates themselves are very uncomfortable and old. There are very few crowded benches to actually change the shoes. The snack bar is also located in a nook - a location perfect to ensure conglomeration of greater crowds; and the food smell coming from it is nauseating. The rink itself is the worst part - chipped and uneven throughout, even immediately after cleaning.",,,

43,Raymond C.,"Bayside, NY",232,32,0,4.0,6/23/2011,I love this rink.  I come here to play open hockey on Friday nights.  The ice condition is usually very good.  The facility itself is only a few years old and is in great shape.  I have been there for public skates as well and it can handle all the people skating on the ice.  Pretty good food at the snack shop.  The only thing that sucks is there isn't much space to sit and eat while you're waiting for the zamboni to finish.  Would have still given them 5 stars but they don't really focus a whole lot on their hockey program.  It seems like such a waste of a facility to not have bigger hockey program.,1,,
44,Tim R.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",0,4,0,4.0,1/13/2012,"I come here to practice my skating skills since it's the closest rink to where I live. I've only been here during the weekdays, when it's $5 for admission (and not $8), and probably less congested. World Ice Arena is a fairly popular spot, though; so even during the morning and afternoon when kids typically aren't around, there can still be a decent amount of traffic on the ice.The rink is cold enough, but the ice seems to deteriorate fairly fast here. The staff does bring out the zamboni once in a while, but the ice doesn't seem to be watered enough perhaps. The rink ""guards"" are around, but they're not always on the ice; especially with only a few people around.One reviewer mentioned that the hockey program here is lacking; and after looking at what City Ice Pavilion in Sunnyside offers, I'd have to agree. I can't really speak from personal experience since I never practice hockey stuff here, though.",,,
45,Will Y.,"Flushing, NY",7,25,0,4.0,3/31/2012,"Haven't gone to too many other ice skating rinks in my life, so it's hard to compare, but I think this place certainly seemed like one of the better ice skating spots. Doesn't have any of the negatives that seem to plague other ice skating rink reviews (e.g. bumpy ice, overcrowding, overpriced, poor quality of rental skates). This place is cheap (about $14 with rentals and unlimited time), huge parking lot, and the skates seemed like they were pretty new and in great shape. One annoying thing: they don't let you take pictures while you're on the rink (not even with camera phones). I guess safety is the concern- perhaps they didn't want people forming dangerous crowds around me taking pictures of my quadruple lutzes, who knows. But that was a little annoying, but not that serious. You can have your friend take pictures of your masterful moves from behind the glass walls of the rink (off the ice).",3,,
46,Dez A.,"New York, NY",21,136,34,5.0,5/27/2009,"Good bye Sky Rink! Helloooooooo World Ice Arena! My daughter and I had been goin' to The Sky Rink @ Chelsea Piers durin' the winter months. Sky Rink's great n' all, but it would take us an hour and a half to get there. We'd hafta get the bus to the subway, get the E or F to 23rd street, then get the 23 bus to the Piers. Not only is World Ice Arena MUCH more convenient for us to get to as it's only a 20 minute bus ride, but World Ice is CHEAPER! Sky Rink's admission is $13.50 (adult), $10.50 (child), and another $7.50 to rent skates. World Ice's admission is $8 (weekends), $5 (weekdays), and only $5 to rent skates! AND you get more skatin' time! BONUS!! Public Skating at Sky Rink is from 1:30pm-5:20pm M-F; 1pm-3:50pm Sat/Sun. World Ice's public skating hours are from 9am-5:15pm M-F; 12:pm-4:45pm Sat/Sun. On Friday and Saturday nights, they even give you a couple of extra hours after hours! Unlike Sky Rink, they don't have helmets available to rent. To have your skates sharpened at World Ice, it's $15. The skate sharpener person is only there on certain days/hours so I didn't get to try out my brand new skates. Their Jackson rental skates appeared to be brand spankin' new and were very comfy, but left little bruises on the sides of our legs; nothing serious. I guess the skates just need to be broken in. My daugher and I were there this past Memorial Day and regardless of the beautiful 80 degree weather outside, the rink was pretty full w/out bein' annoyingly crowded a' la Wollman Rink. (In Wollman's defense, they only operate during peak skating season and that's where all the tourists go, so...) There were a few kids there, but only one pre-teenish troll in particular who annoyed the schitt outta me as he played too much and seemed to be falling and acting like a stupid, lil dumb@$$ intentionally. Aside from that lil basterd, it was a great crowd. It woulda been a smidgen nicer had the zamboni gone around a more frequently. We got to the rink a little after 1pm and the zamboni went around at about 3:15ish. The ice had gotten a lil too bumpy for me, so I was a lil too pleased to see the zamboni do its thing.All in all, World Ice Arena's a great place and the kid n' I can't wait to return. :)",6,6,2
47,Mika Z.,"Queens, NY",14,371,503,3.0,2/9/2008,This was my first ice skating experience ever! I had fun at this rink. It was busy with ice skaters of all ages and levels. I thought that the $8 admission would include the skate rental but I was wrong. It was an additional $4.50 for my skates that were beat up and in old condition. The skates are probably from the 80's! The skates matched the old school music they were playing on the sound system. It's a good place to get my practice on!,3,1,3
48,James M.,"New York, NY",0,257,0,4.0,11/21/2013,Would of given This place a five star perfect rating except This place is full of Useless cases of empoyees. I get here and want to rent skates and have to wait for the guy to finish his Lunch before he would help me. WHen he finally helped me he did nothing but complain on how he got hit in the face with a puck the other day. When I finally got the skates The laces where torn up and I bought them back and said you are really giving me These? He looked at them like it was a surprise that I had the nerve to bring them back. after a close look he finally replaced them for me. The Zamboni is used more for decoration in THis palce as the ice only gets done upon request. and sometimes they wait till its really bad. The food service is another bunch of useless people as I had to argue that my soda was flat. the guy gives me a snooty remark saying it could not be see see as he pushed to button. I finally took the soda and said FINE it not. On a high not the Food was great and the price was right considering its all you can skate. THe place is also clean and spotless. I would come back regardless of the run in with the workers.,,,
49,Karen Y.,"College Point, Queens, NY",77,249,65,4.0,4/5/2009,"I came here on Saturday a little before 1pm. Admission is $8 on Friday nights or weekends plus $5 for skate rentals. They do not have 1/2 shoe sizes for skates so you'll probably have to round off your shoe size if you're in between. The rental shoes look new as well and in good condition. There are lockers to put your things for .75 cents each. The music at the rink was alright and appropriate. The ice gets rough after a few rounds around the rink because there were a lot of kids. I would have enjoyed it fully more if there weren't so many kids falling down in front of me and there was smooth ice. Adults and teens do come here too and most of the time the rink was populated. They smooth the ice probably around once and hour, but after about four rounds around the rink, it starts getting rough already. Plus, birthday parties are held during public hours and they close off 1/3 of the rink for the birthday party kids for about an hour. Eventually after an hour of skating, I start feeling cold and sniffly in the face. They have skating lessons and other classes too for $20 at nonpublic times. Parking is available at parking lot F underneath the Van Wyck expressway. I recommend going through Avery Avenue and park underneath the Van Wyck Expressway if you're going by car. Lots of spots left on a Sunday. I only wished they had more public hours during the weekdays that are more convenient for me.",6,,1
