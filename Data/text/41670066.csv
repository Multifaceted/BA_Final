Biting into their fresh mozzarella sticks feels like you're ascending upwards into the gates of salvation. I have reached true spiritual peace in this little underground dining hall with respectful gummy bears and energetic m&ms. My only complaint is that their guac sometimes resembles wasabi.",1,5,1
