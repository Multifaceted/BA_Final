Do you just walk in there wearing shorts, and if so, why is there a bouncer outside? Confused.Loud thump thump awful music with Wall to wall frat boys, greasy fried everything... Just no. It's a formula, I get it and it works in college towns that have literally nothing better to do... but this is New York City.  Act like it. Step up your game Times Square.",
2,2,9/25/2018,219,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Rob W.,521,4.0,347,"Found this place to be a pleasant surprise--was expecting a crowded tourist trap with mediocre offerings, as befitting a place right next to and named in line with a massive transit hub, but this is a solid spot, with good beer options and impressive bar food. Kitchen is open very late, to boot. Truly impressed with our meals--I had a Founders Burger, featuring with meat cooked in one of my favorite beers, Founders Porter. Can't say my palate was refined enough to distinguish the beer, but it made for a rich, tasty burger nonetheless. Fries were just like I like 'em--crisp and plentiful.  My friends enjoyed their Caesar salad and Brisket Sliders, respectively, and the Jalapeno Popper Empanadas made for a pretty cool and unique appetizer to share. Beer list is solid, with points for diversity. Certainly a quorum of IPA's, but they also worked in a number of local brews and seasonal Oktoberfests.  In addition, they had a couple of quality saisons from Allagash and the always welcome Founders KBS.  Even the failures (a Rose Saison) were interesting offerings that you don't see everywhere, and I was glad to get to sample.  Staff is cool--relatively unsolicitous, but if you engage and ask about the beer offerings, seem knowledgeable enough.The downstairs where you walk in seems small, but upstairs is nice and spacious. (Word of warning: the outside area/roof deck feels like the mob scene that it looks like from downstairs on a nice day, and is the reason I avoided this place for so long.)  But if you're willing to sit inside, this is a great place to come for a game, or simply to kill a couple of hours before or after your ride to/from PA.",4
3,,11/13/2018,495,,"Indianapolis, IN",Christopher F.,96,3.0,138,Not the friendliest place I've ever been. It was late and we wanted some food. The bar staff didn't say a word. Questions were answered with pointing nods or the drink we ordered. Literally no speaking. Finally toward the end of the experience the bartender had to ask if we wanted our check as we stopped using words as well. The fish and chips was pretty good. I ordered the loaded tots which came out as just tots. Would have let someone know had they asked if we needed anything. Very strange. We stayed close by for 5 days and didn't return.,

We weren't sure where to stop for brunch, and with so many options, Yelp was hard to navigate. We stumbled upon Beer Authority and gave it a try. This was by far the best food for the price we found during our entire trip. They offered two cocktails (Bloody Mary's, mimosas, and screwdrivers), and an entree, for just $14.95! I'd say the burger was the best value on the menu. The tater tots were a little overdone, but still tasty. All in all, we had a good experience. It was also nice to see a brewery (Founders) from our home state (Michigan) well represented in NYC!",2
5,1,9/9/2018,4,,"Langley, Canada",Norm W.,142,4.0,53,"After a five hour walkabout in NYC we happened upon this restaurant only a few hundred steps from our hotel. According to the lovely K, we ate here during our first foray to NYC in 2011, of which I have zero recollection. It's interesting what each of us remember of our travels over the past 7 years. What I can tell you is this space allows you to view old New York architecture right beside new architecture while enjoying good food, and a wide variety of craft beers. Half price wine on Sunday and Monday caused us to order a bottle of NZ Sauv Blanc instead of beer, so we can't help you on that front. What we can say is the brisket sliders are excellent and the fries piping hot, cut from real potatoes, fresh and nicely seasoned. The views at the window seats are more than worth the price of admission and the food and service should keep you coming back. We have, and will be back again.",1

We didn't even go upstairs to the roof top because we had such a good time meeting and talking with the bartender and the locals/regular patrons that come here. It's very small and maybe 10 seats AT the bar itself, but plenty of seating along the backside...but who would want to miss all the action sitting in the back. No way! For the first 2 nights, we had Tim, the next, Aidan and the last night Tony...which no joke, is a walking encyclopedia. I wouldn't want to play Trivial Pursuit with the guy. The bartenders that work there are incredibly friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back to our now called ""stomping grounds"" in NYC.",1

I Found my friends & we got to some drinking I tried the banana bread beer wow... delicious!! great tasting beer. They happen to be having a promotion for a few beers I tried the Schlafly Northeast IPA very good light tasting which surprised me since IPA's are usually harsh in taste but this was very good. I gave another a try the darker one, I don't recall the name but it tasted like beer & coffee .. eeuu not fan. as for the place nice size, good amount of seating with plenty of tv's to catch all the sports game.

Six wings for$12 was pricey but this is New York, it costs to breathe.  I was on the fence about ordering more, then the beer kicked in.  Mussels are so questionable but I felt adventurous.    I had to questions before I ordered; one is there a nice amount of into sausage and two, how are the jalapenos?  Once I was reassured that this was a popular appetizer, I gave the green light.   The mussels came out surprisingly fast and were hot.  Only downside was 8 mussels didn't open add find I sat them to the side.   No one said anything.  That is a high number for me and Th he non-acknowledgement was ""interesting"".All and all, this was a great experience and I will be back.",

We all decided to take advantage of the brunch special.  My mother ordered the Authority omelette, my father ordered the Egg & Cheese Sandwich, and I ordered the cinnamon bun pancakes.The cinnamon bun pancakes.  BOOM.  So amazing.  My parents were satisfied with their orders but not blown away.So I guess the answer to having a great Beer Authority brunch experience is: don't be early, order the pancakes, and don't come if you have somewhere to be afterwards.",5

As soon as I couldn't get served, I mentioned it to the manager and he explained it was because I was ""cut off"". Mean while, I had one drink and couldn't remember who served us which is what they explained was what made us ""drunk"" - the bartender just seemed busy and used this as an excuse, no other bartender had an issue serving us. I asked for a name and they refused to give it to us, it was the manager who refused fyi - we eventually got it after calling 911.",

You can stop in quick for a drink at the bar or grab a table and indulge in some apps. I've had the calamari, nachos & pretzel sticks- all the bar snacks have been pretty good. It's definitely a sports bar atmosphere with game day specials and the biggest games on TV. We perched up here for a while post-Broadway show waiting for a bus. The service was good and the staff was friendly. The prices aren't too crazy for NYC, especially in such a commuter/tourist area. There  is a large selection of draught beers if you're into trying new drinks.",1

Updated review",102,,"Union City, NJ",Gustavo F.,423,4.0,91,Great vibes here. Really cool place if you wanna grab a drink after work or before you hit the road on a bus. Nice food selections but a little over priced but that's the name of the game in that area. Over all have had good experiences here.,
14,,6/14/2018,17,,"Warwick, RI",Laura R.,200,3.0,85,"First of all, I can't speak to the food as we only grabbed a drink. The bartender was friendly and attentive but not overly so. The restaurant is clean and well kept and staffed. However I took 2 stars away because their beer selection seemed less than impressive that I expected. It should be noted we are big craft beer people. For the average beer goer this may be prefect a great place to sample many beers on tap. Good pricing though. Cheers",1
15,,6/22/2018,111,,"Sunnyside, NY",JiHae L.,572,4.0,168,I was surprised at how many floors this place had. The first floor is just a bar with some seating and a tv. The second floor has tons of seating. The third floor is a rooftop deck with a bar and seating plus some standing room. They have tv screens  on all the floors. Great sports bar if you want to chill or wait for your bus. I ordered the cider angry orchard rose. Which doesnt taste like cider nor a rose. It looks bright red like fruit punch. They have a lot of different food options. This would be great as a group option since it has that vibe. I'm shocked that the rooftop isn't booked solid. However I'm not sure if I'll come back or not as this is just a typical sports bar. We shall see.,

YesWhat I Ordered: Cheese Pizza(+)- Great Location- Good Pizza(-)- Can Get Pizza- Sometimes Service Is SlowI am a big fan of Beer Authority. Given the location, it is hard to to find a reasonably priced place to grab a drink and quick bite to eat. We came here a few days in a row and never had an issue. Beer Authority has a great selection of beer, decent selection of food, and can hold a lot of people. The biggest issue we had was with slower than usual service. The food came out hot and quick, but refills on drinks were slow. Overall, the slower service wasn't enough to stop us from going. I would highly suggest this place for people looking for a variety of drinks and food for groups.",2

Bartender wasn't that friendly but she got our order correct and kept the drinks coming. Drinks were cold and happy hour! Shared mozz sticks. Burger for lunch $10. Fries were addicting! Burger cooked right too. No buy backs on beer though sadly. Went to rooftop after. Plastic cups ugh. Bartender was nice and kept the drinking coming too!,2

We were three friends and everybody had different taste.It is at Convenient location (right next to port authority terminal, very close to times square too)Big space Many kinds of beers & draft too. We ordered 2-3 types of beers beside draft my favorite beer. Beer selection was fantastic - we were able to enjoy some drinks and appetizers after seeing a show. We were shocked how amazing the Greek Sliders were! This is a very classy old-fashioned-looking sports bar, I must say. There is a sports game on screen everywhere! The decor was easy on the eyes and the customers are very lively especially during peak hours.",2

Updated review",88,,"Queens, NY",Eilish C.,0,5.0,3,Always love coming to beer authority. The bartenders are friendly and chatty every time I visit! I have brought colleagues here on numerous occasions and every single one of them has left extremely impressed and wanting to return... the ladies want to return just to see Conner Love the food here too it's an extremely impressive menu and would highly recommend  any of the tuna dishes. I still say bring back that short rib grilled cheese though!!Upon reading previous reviews I decided to leave one myself as I saw somebody passed comment on a bartender eating over in a corner behind the bar. These people work extremely long and strenuous hours - they are non stop in here every time I come in! In my opinion I say eat when you need to!! You look at customers eating all night!! Keep up the good work beer authority,1
21,,8/17/2018,53,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Lauryn S.,18,4.0,25,"This week I grabbed drinks with coworkers on the Beer Authority rooftop, it was surprisingly satisfying.Even in this humid, heat wave the roof was comfortable and didn't get too loud. Happy hour goes 'til 7 p.m., which is pretty standard for the area.Service at the bar was good even though it could have been considered light staffed for the crowd. It didn't get as crowded upstairs as most bars can during rush hour drink time in midtown.As far as ambiance goes, you won't get anything special there, but it's pretty chill and there are great views of Port Authority.I've only been here one other time for a team lunch -- it was fine, if not memorable.",1
22,,4/28/2018,284,,"New York, NY",Christina B.,764,3.0,257,"Located right near Port Authority, Beer Authority is a muli level restaurant and bar. The first floor has an extremely small bar area while the second is large and full of tables for dining. I didn't get to go to the roof area while I was there but I think that's one of the highlights. They have a decent selection of beer and some cocktails. We had eaten before we came so we just got some dessert (apple cider donuts), which tasted store bought and a bit stale. Overall Beer Authority is a conveniently located large bar but there's nothing special about it other than the roof.",1
23,,5/10/2018,338,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jordana R.,33,3.0,43,"Came here twice during March Madness to drink with friends and catch the Syracuse games. They have a huge beer selection with I believe over 80 beers on tap. When I was there it felt like any other sports bar.  It was very crowded waiting at the bar, but service to our table was quick and friendly. It's really affordable for the area. When I was there they had specials on all their drinks basically, but even on a regular night it's cheaper than almost anything else around times square. The place is huge, it has three levels. On the second floor there are tons of tables and TVs. Upstairs is probably lovely when it's nice out. They had a few TVs upstairs as well to view the games on. While I suspect Beer Authority knew it was going to be a busy night when I was there, just 5 minutes after arriving we were told they were out of pitchers. I also ordered their ""beer mac & cheese"" ($6) that was somehow named one of the best mac & cheeses in NYC. Which is insane to me because it was literally boxed velveeta. I dunno, it's a bar. There are literally thousands of other ones to go to. I'd say I wouldn't go back, but I'm sure I'll return for March Madness next year.",
24,,4/19/2018,105,,"New York, NY",Stefan T.,186,4.0,93,"Lots of beer choices and food is pretty decent. I had the authority patty melt, it's recommended if you like Brie and burgers.

They didn't have as much beer as I was expecting for a place called ""Beer Authority,"" but no complaints, they had a great selection.

Perhaps it was the fact that it was Christmas Eve and the cook was off ? However I think that putting out such sub par nachos is likely indicative of their capabilities. Heck, even I can do better with some melted cheese wiz from a jar. And I am suspicious that the chicken may have been a domestic animal. meow.90 taps would seem inviting, but pretty outrageous in cost. I must admit that I had high hopes.... with a bouncer down at the door and a matron sitting in the long bay of single stall toilets. You can do better, and I'm both ashamed and annoyed to have even ordered food here. Try the other pubs around the corner.",3

The bar there has very limited but I found a great hoppy beer -- lots of hop aroma without much bitterness, my favorite. The second floor is lively and loud with happy conversation. The beer menu is extensive. We ordered Bronx Summer Ale which is refreshing, slightly bitter. My husband ordered a Braves Moon Froot (beer) which has a mild bitterness and a medium hop aroma. Our friend got a Belgium beer: Delirium Tremens, which has a sweet crisp flavor. We ordered sweet potato fries and sliders to eat. Both were delicious.",

If you're looking to get your Sunday funday on, they have a $14.95 special that includes an entree and two drinks that's hard to beat. Went for the mimosas and they were by all means good. For an entree, I chose the avocado toast. I liked the idea of it having eggs on it so that it's a bit more on the filling side. Definitely was a lot of food, I could hardly finish it it all. They piled on the avocado and the bread was thick and buttery (in a good way). It also came with tater tots, which were perfectly crisp and not one bit soggy. I've got to say that their music that was playing when we came in was on point. Lots of great throwbacks.",1

So when we dined here I started with the broiled oysters and tator tots.Oysters were very small, dry and bland. I was kicking myself for not getting the raw bluepoints instead....bad decision.Bad decision #2, the tater tots. They had an odd taste like they were taken out of a bag with freezer burn.

Last night I came here w my co worker and friend for the harpoon promo they were having. He told us the beers had to be ordered from a server. Cool no problem but we wanted to order food his response was  ""they can sit at a table n wait if they like"" then slammed menus at the bar n walked away. Luckily there was another female bartender that came n took our order. Everytime I've been here he's been rude.

We visited on a Saturday night, our waitress was nice but she was slow to take our orders. Not all the tables had customers either. We saw another couple seated close by het up and leave after about 20 minutes of no service, food was good but seemed overpriced even for NYC standards. Ex: $12 for 6 wings? $17 for nachos?

Also, the name? Seriously good bar food. I've come here twice already with my friend Greyci and this place has not let us down. Great for a super chill night. The stout wings and Mac and cheese are pretty freakn' delicious. We also had the BBQ wings with sweet potato fries which were pretty good. I am a big fan of breweries in general because you have such a profuse amount of options for beer. Our first time, Greyci and I went with the Delirium Tremens which is my absolute favorite. However, this time we tried a new beer called the Allagash Curieux which is SO good! Just becareful because the alcohol content is fairly high in this one (11%). It's very smooth and easy to drink but sneaks up on you. Greyci and I actually came on a Tuesday night the first time and it was rather slow on the second floor because everyone was up on the rooftop. It was trivia night so naturally we killed it (actually lost everything but 1 easy trivia on abbreviated airport names - we used our phones) and won a $20 voucher for our next visit. So, Voilà! That is what inspired our second visit, unfortunately, not on trivia night as it was a Wednesday night. Although, it was much more crowded this time. The only complaint I do have is that the staff are not as friendly as you would hope. Not mean, just looks like they don't particularly enjoy their job all that much. We sort of had to pull conversation while sitting at the bar which is strange because we talk A LOT. Besides that, I can definitely see myself coming back to this place. Cool spot :)",2

The beer selection was outstanding and the food was pretty good too. Even the bathrooms were decent - lots of single stalls so no worries about having to wait like many other places.Upon arriving, though, it was a bit of a weird event. There is a bouncer at the main door downstairs who carded my daughter but then let us pass after I said we were here for food. The interaction was a bit strange. Then once we went up the steps to the main food and bar level she got carded again, and yet again was able to come in and then we got a table. Not sure what the carding was for if they were going to let her in anyway?We were unfortunately seated right next to what appeared to be a bachelor party or some such thing. A long table of about 15 dudes who were apparently in a competition trying to see who could scream out f-bombs the loudest. I figured, hey, it's New York, it's going to be loud, no big deal. But then I realized there were some tables over by the windows available....not sure why we didn't get seated there. Our server was ambivalent at best but managed to take our order and it all went Ok considering the obnoxious dudes next to us.The cheeseburger was very good. The fish and chips were Ok.

We were seated upstairs, and the view from our table was awesome. I ordered a quesadilla and sweet potato fries and she ordered the buffalo chicken sliders. The sliders were really plainly assembled, just chicken and blue cheese and the chicken was SPICY and dry at the same time. Being from buffalo, we are used to being asked hot, medium or mild on fingers, wings, etc. when you leave buffalo it's simply ""buffalo chicken"" which can range between super mild to super hot. These were super hot. My quesadilla was small but good, the sweet potato fries and aioli were the star of the show though. Waffle fries in sweet potato form are amazing. The trivia was also great. Our waitress was really friendly and sweet. It wasn't a bad experience but it paled in comparison to all of the other amazing places we ate at in the city.",1

I met a friend for drinks and he was already at the bar. I came in and after about 10 minutes finally got someone's attention and ordered a drink. I then got their attention again for food and another drink. Only half is the food came out and I had to, yet again, get someone's attention to ask about the rest of my food. It came, but very delayed. Yes, I was charged full price, no explanation and no I'm sorry. It's a very busy Thursday night, but that shouldn't matter. It takes ZERO money to be attentive to your paying customers. I stayed after my friend left and for the next 2 drinks, yep, had to her someone's attention both times. One bartender has the personality of a wet mop. Honestly, if you don't like people, sweet lawd just don't work with people! Very disappointed with my experience tonight. Won't be my last time here and I'm hoping this is just a bad night, but for real?! Just pay stand be kind!",
44,,8/8/2018,2,1,"San Diego, CA",Hambone M.,7,1.0,19,"This place is convenient in that it's near the transportation I need to take me home. So if there's a long line to catch my bus, I come here because they have a great beer selection. But every time I walk in and I see the bartender Conor, who frankly shouldn't even be in hospitality, I get so mad at myself for coming. He is so consistently bad. I feel like I'm playing a joke on myself by coming here. For example. Tonight. Before even asking me what I would like to order, he went straight to eat food that was sitting on a ledge near the wine bottles. He then approached me with a mouth full of food to ask what I wanted. Disgusting!Then all of the other bartenders and bar backs came to this same spot to eat this same food, which is literally out in the open for everyone at the bar to see (pics attached). So my questions are 1. Is this not some sort of health code violation and 2. Does Beer Authority not designate an area for employees to take breaks? Conor - apart from him being possibly the worst bartender I've ever seen in my lifetime - continues to get worse and worse every time I come here. The first time he ""served"" me, I was like, what is wrong with this guy, someone must have ruined his day, then I just realized that's who he is. Miserable, mean, slow, impersonal, horrible excuse for a bartender. Maybe they should put him back of house? There's a thought. He makes me hate this place. I pray he gets out of the restaurant industry soon. Or any role in hospitality for that matter.",

I stopped in on my way out of the city on business to have a bite rather than fight rush hour traffic. Immediately found a place at the bar upstairs. Interesting crowd. Not so much tourists but what seemed like locals and commuters. Beer selection was pretty good. They were a little generic on the IPA's. Founders Mosaic Promise was fresh and quite good. So it seems like this place turns over beer a decent amount. The keg was kicked on a very high rated DIPA I wanted so I just went with the Founders Mosaic Again. They had KBS on tap which is VERY impressive for those who know. I was very hungry so I had wings as an app. Wings were actually quite good. Not too spicy, not over fried, no breading. For my main course I went with the BA Burger. They nailed it. Cooked right and the blend of what I believe was a Founders Porter sauce with the smoky bacon and cheese was on point. The Old Bay fries were a nice touch and perfectly cooked. I would have honestly given this place 5 stars but knocked them down one for lack of a good IPA selection. That really was my ONLY flaw I found. You need to have something a little better than Brooklyn Defender, Shipyard, and Ithaca as your IPA's.",

The birthday party was at night, and not as spacious thanks to a good amount of people. Still, we got comfy seating at the high bar chairs and tables.

Ha!Last weekend, K and I went in the afternoon. Very few people were there. Some patrons were watching Copa America (soccer game) on TV, so occasionally you would hear someone yell ""GOAL!!""

Katie, our waitress was so sweet and caring. When she checked in on us, you could tell she cared. And we ate our first dozen so fast, and it was cleared so quickly, she was worried we didn't get our oysters, so she immediately checked with the kitchen. She gave us the best service!

Our downstairs experience was one for the ages. Being my first time in New York this was the only time that I was able to get a feel for what the people were like. The bartender was friendly and acknowledged us by our names during our interaction. He engaged us in conversation and introduced others at the bar. The bar area is long and thin with enough space for bar stool seats at the bar and tall chairs just behind that which line the wall. This area was cash only.My second visit was an upstairs dining experience. We were seated at the northeast corner of the bar/restaurant that accommodated a table of 5-6 people. We wanted to watch a game, but this area was not the best for that. If you want an unobstructed view of the game I would recommend sitting somewhere near the bar. Other spots are less accommodating for this.I had a BBQ shrimp wrap which was tasty. I have been thinking about it for a while now and can't wait to go back and have it again. The service upstairs was a little janky. I'm not sure if they were new or understaffed, but we could never get the things we needed at quite the right time.

My friend gets in without getting carded, while I was stopped and asked to show ID. I get my ID out and nicely ask the bouncer what was the rationale behind his decision to not card my friend but still to card me. The bouncer chuckled and answered condescendingly: ""take a guess. Yes, why don't you try and take a guess?!"" I shrugged off my shoulders, confused, and got in only to wonder why that was. After all, both my friend and I were respectful and presentable, in business casual type of clothing. Sadly, this was about race - my friend is Caucasian and I am a minority. I was discriminated against by a bouncer because of my race. Going forward, I will be avoiding this fine establishment for being discriminatory and will spend my money elsewhere.",

Still a little more than a bar in jersey that i would attend but they have a decent selection of beers here. Overall, i was happy and ejoyed the two i snagged. Service was good to. id come back here on a Weds to try their oysters, 1.50$ each or $8 for half a dozen.",4

Overall, I had a good time. We only got drinks so I can't speak to the food, but service was quick, friendly and attentive. A rep from the Founders brewery came by and gave us a few free beers which was a nice touch.The bathrooms are pretty gross, and there's even a bathroom attendant with a tip basket. There was no soap and the hand dryer didn't work, leaving me with dirty, wet hands. Gross!I'll probably come back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",1

Not bitter, but not too sweet just the way I like it.  I also had the beer flight which is perfect because I got to sample 4 different beers and not feel like I'm about to explode.  The captain lawrence liquid gold reminds me of a hot summer day holding my liquid gold while rocking on the porch...don't ask me why, but that's what I thought.  Also tried the banana bread and without any long meticulous explanation it seriously taste like banana bread, beer and dessert in one shot, great! I had two other samples, but just can't remember after trying everybody else's drink.  In a nutshell if you love beer, this is the spot to go.  Just don't have any high expectation of the food and you'll be a happy camper.",5
96,,3/13/2016,101,2,"New York, NY",Mike R.,2,1.0,402,"I've been to bars and lounges literally all around the world, but never have I seen anything like this place and a case of bad personnel.My girlfriend and I had been with a few friends earlier, out at a few bars in another part of town. Neither of us drink that much when we go out, so we each had just two light beers in four hours. She and I got hungry, so we split up and got some pizza after that (the kind you sit down for and wait awhile for because it's actually being handmade right then and not prepared 2 hours ago). They told us they would be at a place they go to sometimes....which is Beer Authority.They had talked about it before as they are big beer guys, so I was excited to finally see it. After eating, we caught a cab to the place. We walked across the street to BA. Looks normal and not crappy. Good sign.Walk up to the bouncer, who just kind of socially-awkwardly looks at us. He then breaks the news that he can't let us in. I'm thinking ""oh...private event."" Wait no. Our friends are in there having a drink. He then tells me that my girlfriend is too drunk to go in. Okay that's weird. She's had two drinks in the last four hours...two light beers. The last one was at least 90 minutes before because we were busy eating a whole pizza and in a cab after that.He then proceeds to tell me that she is wobbly and he can tell. I walked with her and she wasn't wobbly at all, but maybe the bouncer saw something else. She was in heeled boots and just stepped up on a curb after walking across an uneven street that needs repaving. What the hell? We both got annoyed by it, in which he gets defensive as if he's manning an exclusive celebrity hang out in Vegas. He lets us in, possibly after realizing we are both completely coherent with no slurred speech and not about to tip over. Again, what the hell?After walking in, it was obvious this place suffers from not only a misplaced high ego, but obviously poor management. Saturday night, near where a bunch of people are hanging out, regular non hidden bar and you are 75% EMPTY. Really? You could put a Halal food cart outside of this place and it would get more business than Beer Authority. Guaranteed.If you want people to enjoy your place, learn something about business and actually get someone competent manning your door. It starts with him, and if he fucks up, then the customer is already turned off to your place. In the case of Beer Authority, you aren't a high profile club/lounge that everyone wants to go to, so you can't get away with hiring douchebags for the door which is what they did with this guy. Being that empty on a Saturday night with that big of a dbag screams incompetent business and managers probably who think their place is better than it is. Which by the way, this place looks like a crappy ""upscale"" sports bar straight out of Des Moines, Iowa.Anyway, we immediately told our friends about it who were already there in a few rounds, who were planning to have a few more rounds after we got there. They immediately closed out their tab (which was easy since nobody was actually at this place) as they were angry on how we were treated, and took our business elsewhere (not too far away, which was full, by the way). They agreed to stop coming to the place too and won't be spending money here like they usually do.In the end, it looks like Beer Authority is an authority on nothing except for hiring shitty low IQ bouncers and not getting more than a few customers on a Saturday night in Manhattan. With so many good bars in NYC, and good beer bars, there is literally no reason to waste a single penny here.",6

On the contrary, this establishment carries itself like a nonexistent mafia choosing to hate some of the locals.

I always say and will continue to say my biggest food pet peeve is when they give me a burger well-done when I say med-rare. Why do you even ask me then? The bun was awful, but the rest of the burger was fine. I liked the fries and their honey mustard sauce is great.Service: Nice, however on more than one occasion they charged us for more drinks than we ordered and I can't help but think this was on purpose, taking advantage of the drunks lol, but seriously...not cool.Atmosphere: If you're a jersey person and have been to the Shannon Rose, yep exactly like that. Typical, nice irish pub with 2 floors and a rooftop. It's one of those places you can't help but go it. Always seems to be a default place to grab a beer before catching the bus.",4

The upstairs is extremely spacious with many big tables for groups. Apparently there's a rooftop for those warmer months. The bar was fully stocked (with not just every of beer) and the classic bar food was very good. The phillycheese steak egg rolls were fantastic, as was the spinach and artichoke dip. I felt the jumbo pretzels were mediocre but the boys seemed to enjoy them. Overall a nice happy hour spot.

104,,8/1/2017,0,1,"Woodside, Queens, NY",T S.,0,1.0,10,"If you are going to call yourself the""Beer Authority"" then you should educate your staff about the beers you sell. I asked a server the derivation of one of the ""100"" beers on tap and she could not tell me anything about it. To top it all off this place obviously does not know how to keep their taps because the beer was stale. I ordered a chicken Caesar (the Caesar was $12 and for $4 more I got some dried out chicken breast thrown on top). If you are into beer, go somewhere that really knows about beer: Gingerman or perhaps Peculiar Pub.

I'm not a beer drinker but the selection of beer is crazy and my dad was very happy!

I had my hotel room broken into tonight. To seek therapy, I was hoping to have nice beer and decent pub food. I arrived at Beer Authority confused because I was ignored for the first 5 minutes standing next to the sign indicating that I should wait for a host to be seated... I picked the sign up and went to the nearest upstairs server asking if it was a joke. To which I received a response the likes of it'll just be better if you seat yourself at the bar, at which I was again ignored for a period. Finally a bartender out of the three notices me. Upon inquiry he said that there were several local IPAs on tap and failed to give any further insight... Even after I asked for more info, in addition, I was informed that there was no 'well' as a former bartender of similar pubs, that sounded proposterous, but I realised instead that it was pretentiousness because he started his whiskey naming list with Jack Daniels. I made an attempt to go downstairs where I was hoping for better service, only to be further disappointed. Was not said one word to. Save yourself a trip.

Enjoyed a glass of Chardonnay and caught up with some friends. The place was spacious and not packed. So if you're into bars where you can actually hear the conversations you're having while not bathing in your own sweat, then this might be the place for you. The first floor is a small bar area. There are some seats, but it's quite bleak and uninviting. The second floor has a decent view of port authority and several tables. It is much more spacious. Definitely opt to sit upstairs. There was another staircase leading to a third floor, but I didn't get to check it out. It's interesting because the first floor is cash only, whereas the second floor has a $15 minimum for card.",1

They play every Sunday on the roof from 5-8 during the summer/warm weather - no cover- and with plenty of great food  and drink available as well as well placed TV screens so that you enjoy your food,friends,the game and the grooves.And the staff- are warm,professional and gracious (shoutout to Anna who was all those things and more).

We were seated quickly but our waitress didn't pay us any attention for at least 10 minutes and this was after the bus boy had brought us water (he was good). By the time she came by, we were ready to order. The food came out in a timely manner, but when my husband tried to get her attention to order another beer, she ignored him twice and I needed water. The third time he ordered a beer and I asked for more water. After we ate, the bus boy filled up my water and cleared our plates. I ended up scrolling through my phone for 15 minutes before she finally came by and we asked for the check.

131,2,7/25/2013,950,2,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Stephanie P.,25545,3.0,1045,"Kay, gonna start my review for Beer Authority with what I left as my tip because I think all the info in it is pertinent to this establishment:Soooooooo many beers! 81 on tap, 102 bottles and 10 cans right now - ALL DIFFERENT!!! Awesome roof top area too. Get here early if you can for happy hour cuz it gets packed!_______________________________________________________________Now for my actual review:Beer Authority is pretty much New York's very own (non-retail) beer mecca. Manhattan doesn't boast many beer gardens with superfluous beer options so this would be it. Located in a rather crappy part of midtown that at least lends itself super close to transportation that can get you to a better part of town, Beer Authority is a super spacious 3-level beer lover's paradise.The first floor (ground level) is quite intimate, dim and a little European pub-like. The second floor is much more spacious with a large bar area and lots of seating for folks who just want to drink (think round wooden tables and tall bar stools) or people in larger groups (or small groups) that want to eat in an actual dining area.The upstairs portion is a rooftop area that's surprisingly quite nice. Glasses and beer bottles are not permitted so they have a menu of beer cans to slurp on while you're there.I sat in on a bar stool in the main bar area on the 2nd level for a bit as I tried an interesting wheat ale I'd never tried and another deliciously light and tart lemon cider which apparently had 5-6% alcohol, not terrible for a cider.Then my friends arrived and we were moved by the friendly hostess to a larger table that seated my party of 4. I had a tab already started at the bar, but the waitress promised to connect the two and I asked her to not run my card until I knew what the total was in case I preferred to pay with cash...mmmkay.Beers were had and we then decided to move somewhere else to eat and continue drinking since two of my friends were back from living in Costa Rica, one of them had been in NY, and in America in general, for his first time EVER so we wanted to provide an all encompassing NYC drinking experience and bar hop a bit...I asked our waitress to bring me back my card and that I was going to pay cash. She brought me back my blue Visa, I paid with cash - *boom* transaction completed, everyone had fun - easily a 4.5 star experience and I was planning on coming back to try the braised brisket & bacon sandwich and some other type of food offering since their menu looks delectable...cheers all around...OR SO I THOUGHT.After getting $1 pizza, going to a kinda crappy midtown west Irish Pub and then picking up a new pal off her travel bus from Maryland - we went to Brother Jimmy's (since it was close to the bus stop) to continue drinking...I went to get my credit card so I could start a tab and realized that THE BLUE CHASE VISA IN MY HAND WASN'T MINE AND THAT IT BELONGED TO A MAN NAMED ODIN WHO ALSO HAD MY SAME LAST NAME...so not only was I given the a stranger's credit card, but I'm apparently now a man AND I'm scared that my credit card was also given to someone else.Sure, you're probably thinking that I should have checked my credit card before leaving Beer Authority, but after a few beers and seeing a credit card that's the same color, bank and type (VIsa) as my own I just popped it in my wallet and called it a day.After calling them twice because I lost connection the first time (that or I was hung up on, I mean who knows right?) they were finally able to track down my credit card to still chilin' on the bar of the 2nd floor - right where that awesome bartender (I mean that, she was really cool AND a ginger to boot!) had first placed it.Really sucked having had to bring a group of friends with me to head back uptown to Beer Authority when we were heading to Brooklyn next...Addie, the hostess was super friendly and apologetic. I'm more mad at their waitress more than anything, I mean my being a woman probably means I don't have a man's name - with things like fraud and identity theft rampant - people in service-related industries should be much more careful with these things, of course I did nothing dishonest with this stranger's credit card, but not everyone is me. I was just happy that my credit card was safe and back in my possession. I'll be back some day because the hostess promised to comp me some food/drinks on my next visit and because I did enjoy their beer and want to try their food. All this drama though took my Beer Authority Experience from 4.5 stars down to 3. I'll be sure to report back if my feelings change after a second round with them...",4

Food is awful, and beer is flat.  Now I'm never the one to leave a bad review but I think this is warranted. We had read online that this bar was great for UFC fights. Awesome we showed up to watch the fight. The annoying part is the manager kept pressuring us to leave for NO reason whatsoever...we keep ordering some food and drinks. I think he wanted to flip the table, mind you the bar was pretty freaking empty (plenty of tables were open). He came multiple times, and was very disrespectful. Just an awful experience overall. If you're going to advertise that you are showing a UFC fight, expect that people are going to hang around for a while...otherwise don't host fight nights!This place has ZERO sense on how to treat a customer right.

I ended up with just getting a BluePoint Blueberry Ale and a Victory Prima Pilsner. I'm pretty sure I've had both before so I'm non impressed and it was either one of those or I was getting a Hoegaarden. Long exhale. But some of their more unusual and unique beers sound great if you want to pay full price! It's a suck you in trap.I will admit their food does sound tasty and I didn't get any here because my friend was coming in from Penn Station and we were with other people that just moved back to New York so staying put sounded lame. But if I were to come back, they have wild boar sausage, braised brisket sandwiches, a mac and cheese that sounds pretty amazing with truffles, and oddly enough Shepherds and chicken pot pie.There are 3 floors to the place that get crowded fast. So hurry on over after work. I believe the top floor is only for canned beer because its a roof top in midtown. The middle floor is the busiest. Unfortunately, my friend had issues here because the waitress came back with the wrong credit card with the same last name and owing to that it was the exact same type of card she wandered off with another dude's card. WHO DOES THAT?! I mean, who gives away the wrong card to someone and gives a girl a dude's card?! They fortunately still had my friend's card up at the bar when we came back a few hours later. But that blew to realize this later in the night. And graciously, I will admit, the bartender/hostess did offer to comp her next visit there. I'll probably up my rating of the bar next time I go if the beer selection for happy hour is better and after trying the food.",3

Again, in this neighborhood with this community if youre going to advertise an event accompanying something as large as comic-con youre inability to plan ahead is inexcusable for the lack of services rendered.

176,1,9/10/2015,155,1,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Brian G.,30,3.0,390,"I actually came here twice last week, once with a friend, once with my girlfriend, as I wanted to go somewhere where we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful end-of-summer weather. The location is both desirable and not at the same time. It's only a block from Times Square, which is nice for them to pick up tourists, but it's also right across the street from Port Authority, so the view is mainly of the side of a dirty parking garage...Food was pretty good. I got the smothered tater tots the first time, the sliders the second time. No complaints. Drinks are a little on the pricey side. All drinks, almost regardless of usual price, are either $8 or $9.A bit of confusion the first time I went: I finished my beer and the waitress came up and, grabbing the class and the empty tater tots plate, motioned to me and asked ""another?"" I said yes to another beer, and she came back a few minutes later with... another plate of tots?? I really don't know why she would assume that's what I meant since I was sharing the appetizer and she motioned to me. We laughed it off and decided to keep the second plate anyway since they were pretty good. I'd like to explore more outdoor bars in the area since I work near Times Square and thus meet up after work in the area a lot (I'm used to the crowds so everywhere else is pleasantly quiet instead of T.S. being unpleasantly loud), but I'll remember Beer Authority",1
177,,12/10/2015,1,,"Columbus, OH",Gwendolyn R.,3,4.0,15,Would have given 5 stars if service was better!Beer selection was fantastic - we were able to enjoy some drinks and appetizers after seeing a show. We were shocked how amazing the Greek Sliders were!  Had we known they were that good we would have ordered a larger size!  The service left much to be desired.  Our server never offered to get us more drinks and we had to flag him down after being done with our food for 20 minutes.  Moral of the story - get the Greek Sliders and hope you get a different waiter than we had!,1
178,,5/9/2014,66,,"Sunnyvale, CA",Jack T.,121,2.0,271,"Do you want your craft beer experience to be like you are in a night club or place you can talk with other people?If you are into a place where it's about loud, 'times-square', and frat-like... then this place is up your alley and you should go here.If you were like me and expected a ""tourist-ey"" but cool place to have beers in the big city -- then you are in for a surprise. It's so loud, you can't talk to any of your friends in the main area. Why? I don't know. It's not a 'dance' type place. I cannot say I would go back but I cannot say it was awful either, it's just that I want to warn people about their concept.+ Craft beer is good. They have a nice selection and I drank barrel aged chocolate Yeti, GD 20th, and some Bells Two Hearted Ale.+ Food was pretty good. Had a salad that was pretty impressive+ Pretty good TV installs- Service was ok, I wasn't expecting small shop friendliness but water was not offered to me at all... ever- Loud, can't talk to people, no reason for loudnessI would not go back under normal circumstances. If they had a rare beer I could not get anywhere else, I would come with ear plugs.",2
179,1,9/9/2015,0,1,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",Allison L.,0,3.0,7,"I don't suggest going to the roof top. Every time I've been up there, the service is pretty horrendous. The same waitress is always there (I think her name is Rosie) and she seems uninterested in making money and more preoccupied with the pizza she is eating behind the bar in front of guests. And she wasn't the only one, every employee was digging in on a full course meal(I even saw an employee licking his fingers). The reason I am not giving this place one star is I've had a good experience at the lower bars. I wish that the good service would spread to the roof.",1
180,,4/22/2014,310,,"Jersey City, NJ",Alex V.,502,2.0,275,"This place has a decent beer selection, but overall I wasn't blown away. I mean, it's NYC. They serve all the beers in a cheap-O plastic cup, which really ruins the whole experience. Come on!The bartender was stone-faced and didn't seem like he wanted to interact at all. Which would've been OK had he been super busy, but it was kinda quiet when I came here. Also, the bouncer seemed really aggressive.Ordered some random food, like fish & chips and other typical bar items. Although it tasted decent, it was exceptionally greasy. Also, the table was a bit grimy.Maybe it was just a bad night? In any case, considering the number of other choices available in the city, I would have to say it's highly unlikely that I'll be back.",2

182,,12/25/2014,434,,"Boca Raton, FL",Tim S.,3771,4.0,482,"Let's start with the beer list which is great, and the food is even better. We called ahead yesterday as it seemed like a good place based on reviews. After ordering we waited a few minutes and left from our hotel nearby to pickup the food to go. The entrance was great and the ambiance immediately was obvious it was better than the joints right on Times Square. There was spirited groups throughout having a great time and it felt like mostly locals. The beer list was massive, and it came into play even though we were taking things to go as the food wasn't ready.  I wasn't bothered, as it hadn't been that long and they were busy. I snuck in time for a couple drinks sampled off the list of libations they had. Sadly when the food came out it wasn't complete though. We order the house sliders, Hell's Kitchen sliders(lamb) and tots slathered in cheese bacon and more. We only had the house sliders.   NO worries though.   By the time I finished the second drink we had the full order and we were out the door. And the bartender who was an Irish chap who was great with everyone had thrown in the drinks for our trouble.  EVERYTHING was good. I would recommend these exact menu items if you are looking for fun quick bites        Can't beat em",

184,1,2/22/2014,347,2,"Somerset, NJ",Jim B.,175,3.0,1506,Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon.  Sat at the upstairs bar.  Irish rugby was playing on several screens - sound up.  Bartender had a heavy Irish accent - which was cool - but this is not an Irish bar - those are over on W 33rd Street.  No Irish or British beers on tap.  Big selection of American craft beers plus some Belgium imports.  I don't think too highly of Belgium beers.The bartender did something which amazed me - he used a 13 ounce tulip glass for a 14 ounce pour of Dogfish Head IPA and left a two inches of foam. I felt like I had a half serving.  But I let it pass since I didn't need the larger pour. But why use a tulip glass ever for an IPA - there are no floral accents.Place was quiet - looked like the B&T crowd. Nobody was paying attention to the game.,1
185,1,4/4/2014,171,1,"Buffalo, NY",Kristen B.,414,5.0,74,I had the most amazing experience here!! The wait staff was so nice and the food was to die for. I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Chicken. It had an amazing sauce and it was served as medallions over mashed potatoes. I also ordered the Timmermans Strawberry beer....delicious!! The location and the atmosphere is incredible. So close to Times Square. The second level bar is open with many tables and a huge bar. I would most definitely come here again when I'm in NYC.,1

Updated review",18,,"New York, NY",Anna C.,1,2.0,33,"TERRIBLY SICK!! I went here last night and had the spinach artichoke dip.  Tasted alright but had to spit out a few pieces of artichoke because they were undercooked and too fibrous to chew.  And boy did it knock me out.  My stomach hurt so badly I could barely walk home last night because I had to stop every few steps and keel over.  It was like cramps and getting punched in the stomach all at once.  I went straight to bed and woke up still in terrible pain.  And then I remembered after having worked in a restaurant that if you undercook artichokes, they can wreck havoc on your digestive system.  My friend also had the same issues last night.  The beer is good and the service good but getting sick makes me take down the stars.  I realize you are a bar but learn how to cook food properly.",1

Very extensive menu with flight options and the selection is anywhere from novice to the snobbiest beer enthusiasts. The place was clean, good sized and had a nice feel to it. The server was knowledgable of the menu as well as any tap changes, and was attentive even as the crowd grew. The food was excellent. I had the BA founders burger which was excellent, cooked perfectly and a good sized burger. My lady had the Authority patty melt which she insisted on having me try and It was seriously the best patty melt I've ever had, and trust me, I've have quite a few. It was overall a great experience and I encourage everyone to stop in for a beer and a melt. Maybe two beers...or three...",1

I am not a beer connoisseur but I fell in love with the Ommegang Witte and the Belgian style beers that they have to offer! The drink was citrusy with tastes of lemon and orange, just perfect for my taste buds! I really appreciate the fact that they allowed us to have a sip of few beers before ordering the one we like best. It really helps! This is a very classy old-fashioned-looking sports bar, I must say. There is a sports game on screen everywhere! The decor was easy on the eyes and the customers are very lively especially during peak hours. Such a friendly customer service environment is also very inviting for me to come back during brunch and lunch hours! I see some staff members had on very cute costumes during Oktoberfest which adds a very fun element to my experience. Love it!",

And our waiter was really nice!But the hostess and bartender need an attitude adjustment...We didn't make ressies for Thurs HH, but was told it would be a 30 min wait so we grabbed a buzzer and got a drink by the bar.2 tables emptied up, but I thought they might be reserved. I went up when we've been waiting at least 40 mins without the buzzer and she scolded me.... when she could've easily looked up the name, and apparently the table that was open for 15 mins was for us..... and had the nerve to give us attitude when we said we could all fit into one table.

The prices are really good for the Times Square area. Also boasts 3 large floors so there's plenty of room Lots of beers on tap and a nice menu. I came in for a drink with coworkers yesterday afternoon. There were beer specials along with a $10 lunch special. I paid $8 for a Leffe Blonde and it was delish! I'll def be back to sample some food soon,2
