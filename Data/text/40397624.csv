0,Melinda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,88,49,3.0,9/22/2015,Your typical midtown we-have-it-all-here type of place. They were insanely busy but still quick at the register. I opted for the salad/buffet bar mainly because I didn't have a lot of time to wait around for food but for that and a large coffee it came to almost $10. Pretty on par with anything you're getting in midtown.The grilled chicken was juicy much to my surprise but the quinoa and couscous were sweet which I wasn't too crazy about. All in all I'm sure I'll be back since it's conveniently around the corner but I wont be rushing to get here.,2,1,2
1,Amelia Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,66,486,5.0,7/17/2017,Prompt delivery. Fresh salad. Yummy dressing. Decent size. Very good price! The most affordable lunch salad I've ever had in this area. Avocado grilled chicken salad is my fave from here.,,,
2,B H.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",28,18,0,1.0,9/28/2017,I witnessed the manager verbally abuse his female employee in front of all the customers. I told the manager that he shouldn't treat his employees like that and to respect everyone. He started yelling at me and saying that he could talk to her in any way that he wanted. I would never go there again and I advise you not to go there either.,1,,
3,Barbara G.,"Pocono Pines, PA",0,9,0,3.0,4/25/2018,"The pizza here is delicious, but if you order anything with fries, be careful.  I've gotten fries that tasted like onions because they fry everything in the same oil.  Their buffet is excellent, fresh, tasty & a great variety.  The pizza guy & the cashier are very nicer and always welcoming.",,,
4,Ebony B.,"Jersey City, NJ",110,4,0,5.0,10/10/2017,"Disappointed that they never have the buffalo chicken strips on the buffet anymore but I love their food and the people are super nice there.  The buffet is a little pricey though, by comparison.... but then again the food is so much better by comparison.... so I guess it's a trade-off.  The other food there is reasonably priced.",,,
5,Jay H.,"New York, NY",186,71,0,4.0,6/8/2016,"This place is around the corner from my office and I find myself here a couple of times a week, always for lunch. It's huge - soups, sandwiches, juices, pizza and two large buffet tables with salads and hot foods. That's what I tend to focus on. A container of salad and some protein will normally run around $12-14, which isn't cheap, but it's great quality. Quick service and good fresh food. What more can one ask for during lunch in midtown?",1,,
6,Long K.,"Bellevue, WA",110,427,1035,2.0,4/5/2014,"Typical Midtown quick eats place except they have a few features worth noting. Check off the usual standard cafe: grill, deli sandwich and pizza counterBut there's a per pound buffet which is different from any other lunch place around. BEWARE though, couple pieces of protein,some salad or carbs here and there might easily cost you over $8 after the weight is calculated. It wont even feel like you fileld up your container with that much food for the cost. About half the selection rotates rotates daily. Some items are bland, others like the salmon(depending on seasoning) may be worth it.The grill at the back makes decent but slightly pricey burgers for a cafe. The seasoned/cajun fries are a steal at only $3 for an order! Not starchy and bland like your typical cafe order.Make your own Pasta Station - Everything is bland. Watching the guy move at molasses speed when that's his only job doesn't help either. I've seen him forget to even put pasta in my friend's order...nothing like eating a few pieces of protein and soupy sauce w/o pasta.",3,1,1
7,Juggernaut N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,10,40,3.0,5/5/2015,"A bit expensive but has lot of varieties! Fast register! They have it all, hot buffet, pizza, salad bar and juice bar!!! It will be much better if they cut it down on the salt in their hot food!!",2,,
8,Andy K.,"Manhattan, NY",28,6,0,4.0,11/14/2016,"Almost like a food court, they have it all. Salads, Sandwiches, Pizza, Salad bar. Food is good for the most part, especially grilled chicken, rosted and grilled vegies, eggplant dished and humus. Most of the salad bar relates to Turkish-Lebanese flavors. Salad bar is quite expensive option for lunch expect to spend $11+ for Medium quantity without drink. Ambience ... well if that's important to you, you may want to skip. Its great optuon if you just take it out and planning to eat at the plaza or at your desk.",,,
9,Fari M.,"Bergenfield, NJ",2,28,7,5.0,6/1/2016,"I have been going to college next to this place for one year and I never came to this place for lunch. One day my friend decided to study here until class and I joined her. In the midst of studying they were setting up the lunch buffet and OMG SO MUCH VARIETY!!!! To my surprise the food was top notch and there were plenty of delicious healthy options. My only regret is not coming in here sooner. Usually my only healthy options were DD (not healthy) and a salad (boring). This place has diff types of fish, and a wide array of pinterest style mixed salads and vegetables. YUM!!! Now I come here every day for breakfast and lunch. Bye bye nursing school pounds!",,,
10,Sarah G.,"Manhattan, NY",25,3,0,1.0,8/15/2014,"This used to be my go to egg white wrap place.  Unfortunately, ever since my favorite breakfast cook left, it has not been the same.  He always remember my order and almost always got it right, but happily fixed it if something was left off.  Most of the new guys are okay, much slower, but still okay.  However, one guy always forgets to add things I asked for, and always sloppily puts things together.  I get it, this isn't Sarabeths, but can you at least not look like your slopping together some disgusting pile of crap?  Further, I ask for hot sauce as he assembles it EVERY time, and EVERY time he ignores blatantly ignores me.  Like, adds the salt and pepper, but no hot sauce.  So then I have to ask for a side of it, and he gives me a death glare and says ""anythiiing else?"" in a condescending way.  Further, he charges me like a dollar more than I used to be charged.Needless to say, I won't be coming back.  Hoping I can find an alternative in the area :(",1,,

I'm not a huge fan of their pizza slices but the squares are yummy!they've got a large salad/hot foods buffet bar which you pay for BY THE POUND (although kinda pricey) ...my fav is the avocado saladmost people take their food TO-GO, but they have a counter and a couple tables inside if necessaryNOTE: they CATER & our school is always ordering pizza from Le Mirage for lunch meetings",5,4,4
12,Juan T.,"Manhattan, NY",323,469,536,2.0,12/27/2011,"mediterranean theme buffet, food is good, not great but just good, like all other buffets around. Veggies seem to be soaked in oil, which is OK for me, but since its by the pound, the food is heavy but you don't actually get enough to eat for a decent price.  Prices are $8 per pound and a pizza slice is $3.50 Their food seems always fresh.  i have been here 2 times and no problems so far with anything just with the prices. I can get little Italy pizza for less and its better pizza. large vegetarian selection, for those days that you had enough meat to eat for the entire month. I have choices so i will not be going there for a while, i know that 1 buck is a buck, but economy is tight.",,,

17,Jeff M.,"Manhattan, NY",107,314,36,3.0,4/16/2012,"I hit this place up on my way to work about 2-3 times per week.  Typical deli, bagels are good, breakfast sandwiches are fine.Drinks (sodas) in the cooler are rarely ""cold"" and usually are room temperature.  And then they charge you for a cup of ice at the register.  Weak.  I understand that they may be stocked in the morning, but then don't charge for ice . . .",1,,
18,C E.,"Chicago, IL",114,34,0,4.0,12/7/2014,"I'm here frequently for lunch.  It is really convenient and the people at the register are always really fast.  LOVE the hot bar and salad bar.  In particular, the coconut chicken, mac & cheese and dolmades are delicious.  I do wish some of the cold salads didn't all have red onions in them though!  I've had pizza a few times as well and that was solid.  They also have a deli counter, kale/salad bar and grill area.  They are a little on the pricier side, but can't really go wrong otherwise/",,,
19,Stan D.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,111,3,5.0,1/22/2014,"I am here almost every day - am a big fan of their buffet. Sure it's a bit more expensive than other places in the area, but the food is consistently fresh, non greasy, and tastes great. Definitely a case of getting what you're paying for.",1,,
20,Yesenia P.,"Orlando, FL",187,195,25,2.0,7/14/2012,I don't know why I went here more than once. Yes the location is great but the food and prices are definitely not. I ordered a roll with turkey and swiss and it just wasn't very tasty. It was so expensive I should have just crossed the street and gone to Subway instead! At least I would've gotten a bag of chips and a soda too. I can't understand why miss a. would give them 3 stars when they changed her entire order. Yea sure the delivery guy is nice but that's about it for this place.,,,
21,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",51,183,5,2.0,7/2/2012,"Convenient location ....check. Fast service....check. Pricing....equal to all other midtown places, so check. All the ingredients to potentially have a great lunch.....check. Got a sandwich which looked like it was going to be delicious. Got it back to the office, took a bite and realized that bread was incredibly stale. Like, crumble in your hands stale. Like, I can make bread crumbs out of you, stale. Cant have a good sandwich without good bread - it doesnt matter what is inbetween the slices. Has alot of potential, but won't be going back. Sigh, get me out of midtown please....",,,
22,Susan L.,"Manhattan, NY",313,449,815,2.0,2/15/2012,"There is a mediterranean theme buffet and most of the food there are cold. I thought some of the noodles would be at least warm, but they were just plain cold. The food is mediocre and you can definitely find better food else where. There was nothing special about the chocolate chip cookie and it costed a dollar for one small cookie. The salmon and the turkey meat ball tasted alright, but the beef wasn't that good.",,,

Updated review","I'm 100% positive I got FOOD POISONING from this place, as I had not eaten anything else in over 14 hours. (The last meal I ate prior, I had cooked on my own and shared with someone else. They didn't get sick). So I can deduce that I got sick from breakfast at Mirage.  Not to mention I got sick at work.  Terrible doesn't even describe it.Up until this point I had been ordering from Mirage on and off for over a year. The delivery boys have always been friendly and everything about the food had been pretty much alright. I just can't ignore this.",2,,
24,Debora L.,"Albany, CA",199,835,168,3.0,6/9/2009,"Why do I go here?- convenience (located right outside my office)- quickNotice that the quality of food and the prices do not lure me here.If this wasn't the closest cafe/ deli to my office, I probably wouldn't go here. I've had the salad, a few types of soups, and some Saran-wrapped pastries here and thought they were all mediocre and forgettable. The pizza is probably the best of the warm food, but it's nothing to write home about. Therefore, I mainly buy packaged foods (drinks, granola bars, etc.) since the quality is dependable. The prices are Midtown-appropriate (i.e. grossly overpriced). The staff is fairly efficient and service is fair.If you have time, spend the same amount of money at Zeytinz across the park-- the quality of the food is much better.",1,,1
25,Tee G.,"Queens, NY",1,35,2,3.0,8/24/2015,"I ordered a slice of whole wheat and sicilian pizza. It was good not too much cheese and sauce since I'm supposed to be on a diet. I'm right around the corner but by the time i got it, the pizza was cold. I don't know if it had ever been heated up but that would have been nice. I also got a large crystal light lemonade because I thought it would be healthier but it was very sweet, in fact too sweet for my taste. However if I was craving a slice of pizza again & didn't want to travel far, I would order again & indicate that I like my pizza hot.",,,
26,Kraig D.,"New York, NY",2,6,0,3.0,7/30/2013,Quick and convenient place for lunch with a variety of items and seating.  Le Mirage has a bevy of assorted lunch items ranging from sandwiches and salads to their buffet style trays.  I decided to get two slices of pizza which weren't all that bad.  The pepperoni was fine but very greasy but the Sicilian was the standout.  Lots of different beverage and chip options as well and we found a place to sit inside.All in all not a bad spot for lunch if you need something convenient or need to choose from a variety.Quick and convenient just like this review,1,,
27,Miss A.,"Harlem, New York, NY",0,427,174,3.0,10/11/2011,"I always order thru seamless.  The service is always fast (10-25 mins) and the delivery guys are always courteous.  Problem is that whats listed on their menu isnt always available.  If youre going to order from Le Mirage just keep an open mind because this is what I got with today's order.  I ordered a nantucket Cranberry juice---got Ocean Spray (smaller size bottle than the Nantucket)I ordered Quaker Instant Oatmeal---got Kashi GoLean Crunch Cereal (tastes like cardboard but thats healthy, right?)I ordered Total Raisin Bran---got Kellogs Raisin Bran Crunch (gahh, Raisin Branch Crunch scrapes the roof of my mouth thats why i didnt order it!!)I ordered Dannon Cherry Yogurt---got Dannon Light n Fit Strawberry Banana Yogurt (diet food tastes like poison and makes me sad)I ordered a quart of Silk Plain Soy Milk---got a juice box size of Silk Very Vanilla Soy Milk (quart is way bigger than a juice box hence the huge price difference)So as long as you like surprises and aren't big on details then, yeah sure, Le Mirage is A-ok.",,,
28,Carolanne G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,1.0,7/15/2015,"inconsistent pricing. I've ordered the same sandwich 6 times and paid 6 different prices. my last and final visit I agreed to pay an extra $1 because I was told ""fresh baked turkey"" costs more (than the day before?). However, when I got back to my office what was between the bread was some cheap gelatin pressed turkey. Don't bother.",,,
29,Cassie J.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,14,2,4.0,5/2/2013,"Le Mirage is my go to spot for everything when I'm feeling lazy or have literally five minutes to run from work to get lunch (which is usually EVERYDAY) since they're located on the ground floor of my building. They're priced the same as every other Midtown deli/cafe. The most I paid for lunch there was $13, which is typical. The staff is friendly and their daily selection of soups is wonderful.",,,
30,Justin H.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,52,0,3.0,10/3/2012,I'm here all the time....Close to work and the selection allows me to make healthy choices...,,,
31,Marc E.,"New York, NY",6,12,2,3.0,3/5/2009,"I have been to Mirage hundreds of times and I am still not sure how I feel about it.  The hot food is slightly overpriced but very good, and they change up the selection daily.  The soups are great, and the soup guy is the man.   The pre-made wraps are good, and you can't beat the soup and half a wrap for $5.50.  Sandwiches are just ok -- the meat is already presliced (too thick for my liking) and there just isn't enough of it.  And I still can't get over that NYC delis charge extra for lettuce and tomato.The thing is: they must recognize me by now, and it really bothers me that I get the same service as if i walked there for the first time and they don't care whether or not I come back.  For example, when they cut my bagel very unevenly (not being ridiculous here), put not enough cream cheese on only one half, and then charge more than most bagel places.  And come on, you can't throw a single tomato slice on there without charging me $0.50? (an additional 20%) Overall, go for the soups/wraps and the hot food.  It will be a quick stop, as I applaud their efficiency at the cash register.  So do I like Mirage?? I'm not sure.  But its so close that i'll be back a few times a week until they know me and how I like my bagels cut.",2,1,
32,Mike M.,"Danbury, CT",25,40,17,4.0,2/2/2010,"I work in the area and eat at Le Mirage at least 3 times per week.  They just recently expanded their shop and they now have - in addition to pizza, salads, sandwiches, and hot food - a MEDITERRANEAN BUFFET.   Now, I'm not Mediterranean or anything close to it (and actually never had Med. cuisine before) and I absolutely LOVE this stuff.MEDITERRANEAN BUFFET:They have two main buffet stations (each with about 10-14 platters); one HOT food buffet and one COLD food buffet.Everyday they make a bunch of new dishes and, unlike some buffets where the food sits out all morning under plastic wrap, they bring each platter straight out of their kitchen.They have great vegetarian dishes and tons for the carnivores.PRICE:Currently $3.99 per half lb (which is slightly cheaper than most other buffets around)",,,
33,Stephen M.,"Town of Redding, CT",1,6,0,4.0,12/25/2011,"This is a tricky place to review. I work nearby and come here for lunch most days. They do have a lot of very good food here. The salad bar, which features a mediterranean theme, can be very good. The hot food can be excellent also.They have had turn-over among the chefs. They have had surprisingly talented chefs over the years. it's odd and I guess somewhat telling that these talented chefs leave. My biggest complaint is that on a few occasions I have found some grit in things like the lentils and the spinach. They should run a more thorough conscientious operation.That said, I am grateful at the over-all quality of the offerings here: grilled vegetables, hummus, fava bean salad, beet salad, gnocchi, roasted peppers. Frequently, they have a first-rate brisket. A lot of good things here, most days. They aim high and get it right most of the time.",,,
34,Marisol F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,2.0,6/24/2011,"I just came back from a very negative experience at ""Le Mirage Cafe"". I went with two friends for lunch to this ""cafe"" which is really just a buffet/deli. I had a restaurant.com certificate so we all went to weigh in together. We get to the register and the clerk tells us that we have to spend an additional $3 because we are not yet at the minimum, we point out that we are and she tells us that drinks are not included. I then point out the special instructions on the certificate. No where does it state that beverages are not included. The owner then comes out and, after making us stand there while he reads the whole sheet, he asks us if we are eating there. We tell him we are and he tells us not to worry, that he will figure it out and come to where we are sitting to collect payment. He comes over and tells us the balance, which was $23 and change. He then shows us some scribble writing and we logically ask for him to explain the calculations. He points out that he is charging the 18% gratuity etc. Which we knew was part of it because it is in the certificate, but ridiculous once you get there and realize that it's not a cafe with wait service.The problem is that after we ask him to place explain, he then told me I was not leaving without paying the total balance. I had never insinuated that I was- I just wanted him to clarify his math, which after he did, he realized he was 50 cents over, no big deal, but he then got aggrivated and asked me how much I paid for this certificate. My friend responded $10. So he tells us, well I don't get any of that, and I have to make some money don't I? We told him it was his choice to sign up for the service not ours. I was really disappointed and shocked by this exchange. We were made to feel bad about having the certificate. He was loud, impatient, and clearly wanted everyone in the deli to know. It was also unbelievable that there was a gratuity charged at a location where you serve yourself food from a buffet grab a drink from a cooler and then walk up to the counter and pay. The food wasn't bad. but the service made it so that we won't be going back there again.",2,,
35,Adam A.,"Bellmore, NY",77,5,0,5.0,10/18/2010,"AMAZING. I found this place about 3 months ago. Their Salad is the best. They give a ton of toppings. Only place that offers Salmon for salad. Their hot bar for fish is great. Nice offerings of Talipia, Shirm, Tuna and Salmon. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  only wish is they offered more creamy soups. Usually only have brothy soups.",,,
36,JK L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,84,4,1.0,9/21/2010,"I am giving them 1 star for their service.  For food I used to give them 4 stars.  I work nearby, and used to have breakfast their EVERY morning.  Their beef sausage and eggs on toast was pretty decent.  They have always been a bit slow in preparation.  15 to 20 minutes without a line.  Recently they ran out of their beef sausage, so we stopped going for several months.  I was annoyed because the management kept saying that they would have it the next day.  I was duped into going their for 2 weeks because they kept saying they would definitely have it the next day!  Why would you do that to a regular customer?  Anyway, after more than 3 month hiatus, we figured they would really have it.  So we order our usual this morning, and after about 15 minutes, they choose to tell us (again there was no line) they are out of beef sausage!!!!!!  No apologies, they just want us to order something else.  I did that for 2 weeks because they kept telling me they would have it the next day, but not today.  We left, never to return.  We went across the street to try City Cafe for the first time, and it more than made up for everything!  Read my review on them.",,,
