0,Emily E.,"Nashville, TN",1,22,1,3.0,6/3/2018,I like this place. I've eaten here twice. Staff are friendly and fast. Lots of places to sit. I ordered chicken milanese and yuca the first time and the cranberry tuna salad with brussels sprouts (gotta get my vegetables in somehow). Food is good and fast. Typical deli with hot food.,1,,
1,Ariella T.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,7,167,2.0,9/13/2018,The food that they serve here is abismal. Egg & cheese costs upward of $4.50 ... please look at the photos and tell me what merits that price? Save yourself the time and trouble and go to the deli next door.,2,,
2,Samantha R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,11,1,1.0,11/3/2018,"I use to go to high school nearby and they had terrible service then too. The staff is INCREDIBLY rude. The food is mediocre and the prices are too high, even for New York standards. I went here a couple days ago because I really wanted a salad and the chicken was so utterly dry. I grabbed a pizza for my friend and it was burned pn the bottom. I was asking for a refund but the cashier argued with me that because we ate from it (literally two bites when we were trying the food) that we couldn't get a refund. I couldn't believe this place had gotten worse.",,,
3,Johanna L.,"New York, NY",0,20,1,1.0,1/12/2018,"Don't order from here. I ordered a salad from them last month and it appeared to be half eaten and days old by the time it arrived two hours later. It was also missing half of the ingredients I paid extra money to order. I asked them for a refund, they said the best they can do is send chicken separately. Not acceptable!Eventually they said they'd send a deliveryman to pick up the salad (and warned me several times not to eat it) and he'd bring me cash as long as I don't report it. Deliveryman shows up another hour later (my office is quite literally upstairs from the deli), doesn't have cash for me, has no idea he was supposed to bring me a refund. I call the manager, he said Delivery.com would issue the refund. I said fine.Weeks later (after I chased up - not that anyone's reached out to me) and I'm just now finding out they're deciding to give me a partial refund and not a full refund. Are you kidding? This place is horrible.",,,

I emptied my tray and upon departure requested if my coffee can be refilled. Now  it was half a cup and it was cold. I was told its 2.45 and a minimum of 5.45 is mandatory  if im using a card. Now! I have just and paid for my meal, i  had to buy an apple and Orange  which the cashier pointed out that i was 45cent short and encouraged me to biy a bananna at 65 cents.

7,Eugene L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,1.0,10/11/2018,"This place is awful. You will not come out of here feeling any good about your experience. You will be angry, disappointed, frustrated and upset. It almost feels like these people are doing you a favor by serving you. Every single interaction with any employee of this deli feels like a condescending conversation. They act as if you are working for them and not the other way around. The chubby lady in front is extremely rude and always has a sour face. The rat looking skinny lady in the back with glasses is the absolute worst. Something is telling me they are related, perhaps it's a family owned business. They both act like they despise being there. Went here 3 times, prices were always different and obviously overpriced every single time. You can only imagine how the food tastes with these kinds of people in charge. If I could this place 0 stars I would. If you are in a good mood today, don't come here. Very hostile environment with a really negative vibe all around. They should be closed down.",,,

Updated review","Can I give them 6 ?! Amazing customer service!!!! I order from here pretty much every day, either for breakfast or lunch at work and the food is always delicious and my orders are always correct. Today I ordered lunch for myself and a co-worker and our order was correct, however they sent the wrong size drink. (I know it's not earth shattering but there is a price difference). I called the restaurant and spoke with Kiki who was super friendly and helpful, she gave me the credit and even called me back to say that it had been done. If I wasn't already obsessed with ordering from here, today would have made it official. Thank you to Strokos and Kiki for the great food and service!",,,

I'm an Italian who made the mistake of getting the eggplant parm from a non-italian place. Don't do it. While it was good, it was really salty. I'm a salt person but it was just a little to much. Came with a choice of side Greek salad, rice, pasta, etc. I got the Salad and it came with a stuffed grape leaf. I didn't like it at all and I usually like them.My mom got a piece of roasted chicken with steamed vegetables. She didn't complain.Fast but homemade food. Great amount of seating.

However the works were absurdly rude. After not giving then 10% Mount Sinai employee discount for multiple people in a row (employee kept saying ""oh I forgot I'll do it for the next person"".... Yeah...) my friend got rang up with my (significantly more expensive) bill. She pointed this out and the woman was rude and said ""I know what I'm doing just wait for your receipt."" The receipt came out and she still had the high bill. Rather than apologize she just looked at my friend and said ""well what do you want me to do?"" As if it was our fault. She then took her time fixing the problem with a scowl on her face. And all of this did not make it an assumed in-and-out encounter you expect from bodega lunch.

19,Kayla R.,"New York, NY",140,71,63,1.0,4/24/2017,Possibly the worst experience I've had in the midtown area in terms of eating .. for a simple salad the cashier rang me up about two times for one order (which means double the tax). When trying to correct the order she seemed to be confused in the change she owed me. I had to correct her mistake  and after a few minutes of going back and forth she finally apologized. I wish I would have just walked out without the food. I'm super unsatisfied and will not return.,,,
20,Alana J.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,10,3,1.0,11/30/2017,"Ugh... do I REALLY have to give this place a star?! The owner is extremely rude with a nasty attitude.. that is unless you are Hispanic or white. I am a recent graduate of John Jay and had to get some paperwork and pick up my degree. I decided that since I didn't eat the entire day let me grab something quick to eat. Whoever the guy is has a nasty attitude ;& has been this way towards my friends and I even when I was a student at JJ . He is average height, slender/average build w black eyeglasses , probably Mexican . I've spoken to him directly about his demeanor but clearly he feel it's not an issue worth rectifying. He treats the whites like royalty but yet they're the first to hire people from your background as their cleaners and treat them like mierda. However you seem to not keep this reality in mind. If other people on here are complaining about this don't you think it is more conducive for sake of keeping your business to at least treat your customers of color with basic decency?! A large amount of your customers are students who are people of color so wake up! Also, they are exorbitantly overpriced when theymost likely are heating up left overs for what I'd say half of the food they sell.",,,
21,Jeremy S.,"Naples, FL",0,20,0,5.0,2/11/2017,"This place was a short stroll from the hotel so we decided to go here for lunch. I got the cheesesteak with fries and it was actually delicious! Wasn't expecting this because of the other reviews but for what I paid which was just under $10, it got me leaving the place with such satisfaction. Only complaint was the excess of grease but that was soaked up by the cooking paper and that was easily thrown away. Great little find here!",1,,1
22,Arielle R.,"Bronx, NY",21,67,127,2.0,1/9/2013,"Strokos, what to say about this place?Honestly the only thing good about this place is the food. I haven't had everything on the menu but it gets pretty busy so I assume people come back because they were satisfied with their food. Any other good qualities ? No way! The customer service here sucks! By far the worst! Okay maybe not the worst but it sucks nonetheless. The women (yes it's more than one) have awful attitudes and faces to match!  They are not approachable and if you asked a question, be sure to get glared at before you receive an answer! I say nothing to them if I don't have to. My school is just across the street and it's convenient, had that not been the case I would never go there, EVER! But on the bright side the pizza is good!

The other selections don't look appetizing to me and I didn't have a good experience with the pizza. The burrito is by far better than what I've had from chipotle or burrito box. I get mines in a spinach wrap with everything in it which includes (chicken, shredded mexican blend cheese, rice + beans, jalapeño, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole and more cheese :p) all of this comes out to $8 and change because of my student card. May I say, this leaves me stuffed all the time and it's great in quality and quantity. So I'd recommend the burrito or burger at this place.",,,

They refused a refund and after placing me on hold 4 times claimed that the salad had the right amount of dressing and that they made thousands of salads. They said that I would have to call seamless in order to lodge my complaint. I called seamless, who called the restaurant, and the restaurant still refused to issue a refund. They also claimed that they were positive they sent out rice with my chicken kebob (which is a huge lie) and were generally disrespectful to both me and the seamless representative on the phone.

Updated review","I came back here a few days ago with my friend and I was disappointed with them. I do not know what happen. They failed to live up to the experience I had the first time I came. Almost everything that was good last time, went bad this time:1)It was oily this time.2)Too cheesy.3)It was thinner than the first time.I still ate the pizza though. I'm just mad that it was not as good as the first time. My friend ordered a pepperoni slice, and by the time she was done letting the oil drip off the pizza [she held it up over the plate], it made a puddle on the plate. She called it ""art on the plate"".... -_- .....it looked nasty. I didn't know which rating to give them this time....well based on their ""stellar performance"" [HA!].... I'm going to have to give them a 3.3 rating. To make it easier, lets bump it down to a 3 rating, because I'm not a fan anymore...nor is this pizza as good as it gets.Yes!...I've finally joined the ""Three Stars and Below Ratings"" group for this place.

45,Daphne M.,"ASTORIA, NY",66,247,97,2.0,8/28/2011,"Strokos succeeds because it's one of the few places in the area that has a wide variety of food for the midday lunch-eaters working in the area.They have a salad bar, a pizzeria portion, a bakery portion, sandwich/panini area, and a hot food option. With such a wide variety of food, flavor and quality is sacrificed. There are a few good items, but overall this place is nothing special and the Manhattan prices definitely aren't worth it. The employees are generally nice enough, though. When I've ordered a salad here it was generally substantial enough to be a filling meal. The pizza slices meet expectations but are overpriced. I can say the buffalo chicken slice is definitely hot.One of my favorites is the sandwich with turkey, avocado, and bleu cheese on the multigrain bread. It's definitely packed with flavor, and the 1/2 size is filling enough for me, though still nearly $7.Overall, this is a go to place if you just need to fill your stomach with little care for the palette.

49,Michelle F.,"New Hyde Park, NY",57,6,1,1.0,2/19/2014,"I wish I could leave less than one star. I got my food to go, I ordered a cheese calzone and a cesilian slice. The slice was burnt terribly but somehow was still drenched in grease. And I took one bite of the calzone and almost vomited. It was burnt and packed with idk what type of cheese but there was definitely no mozzarella or regotta in it. This isn't thr first time I've had less than satisfactory food here but thIs is definitely the last time i will ever settle for such a disgusting meal.",,,
50,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",877,406,479,3.0,7/8/2014,"The food here for a hungry college student is edible. I like how the cafe has different sections setup so its organized. Theres a small pizza section with huuuge slices , large  chicken peperroni and veggie rolls, beef patties, garlic sticks/ knots. The workers there are quick and friendly and always smile they put it in the oven asap. Then theres a hot food section to the right with pastas chicken rice and beans along with a salad bar to create your own or you can create your own roll , hero or panini sandwhich. I was a fan of the pizza and garlic sticks yes its expensive but portions are huge. I really recommend the fat sicilian slices. I did try their rice and beans too and i wasnt too much of a fan i felt it was quite bland and needed salt. However if your on the run they have huge yummy cookies like black and white to rainbow and chocolate chip and creamy cupcakes like red velvet. Also they do have breakfast teas and average lattes , you can make your own breakfast sandwhich but in the morning its packed. If you choose to stay they have tons of tables in the back which are kept someone clean depending on the time of the day. Despite the john jay discount i still end up spending at least 10-12 on my food which isnt worth the quality since some items are just average or not seasoned enough. I probably would come back here just to grab and go but i wouldnt be there frequently when they got tons of better options near by like boston market and chipotle too.",4,3,4

Definitely a steal.  Love all the lunch choices, and soups are great too.  VERY annoying when the high school kids pack the place and stand around the ordering area making it extremely hard to move around, and the girls at the register could have a better attitude but eh...could be worse!",,,

56,S M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,56,4,1.0,6/13/2010,"I work nearby and eat here often enough.  The soups are good, salad bar, and sandwiches all decent.  Sometimes I'm content just getting a container of their chicken and broccoli salad (around 5.50 for a large), good for low carb diets.  If you get the soup, you'll get a piece of their focaccia bread which is pretty good.  That's about it here. I don't get their hot meals because I find they are a little overpriced for lunch everyday.  I used to get the quiche with a side salad but they stopped making the quiche.I'm updating this review because stroko's portions really suck for what you pay.  This photo (i.imgur.com/riLQJ.jpg) of an entree with 1 side came to almost $8!  That's 1 thin piece of chicken breast, some roasted peppers, and a meager Caesar salad.  I'm going to start going someplace else.",,,
57,Audrey H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/4/2012,"Stroko's is a terrible place to eat. My friends go there to get lunch during school hours. They treat us poorly, rushing us to order and get out of the shop. The workers are very rude. Once I ordered a salad, not realizing how much it was, and I was about a dollar short. Three workers all yelled at me at the same time for ""wasting their time"". They were so rude, I cried.Also, my friend got a salad there one time and she found a GRASSHOPPER IN IT. I am not lying. It was absolutely disgusting. They gave her her money back, but they were laughing the whole time. She could have gotten food poisoning. The food is overpriced and tastes bad. My friend bought a piece of cake and it was so expired, it tasted sour!I would not recommend visiting this place. It's a waste of time and a hazard to your health.",,,
58,Emily A.,"South Portland, ME",46,232,7,2.0,3/9/2009,"I end up here far too often as it is super close to where I go to school and is better than the other options available (Boston Market, Blimpies, etc.) The food is okay, love their lemonade, sometimes I stop in just to get one, the pizza is good if you order a whole pie. The slices have been sitting around for quite some time. I got a piece of Chicken BBQ and it tasted strangely like pine needles... I haven't ordered that again. The people who work there are nice enough, after you order you can go sit down and they'll bring your food to you so you don't have to stand around waiting for it.",3,1,1

I work less than half a block away from this deli and have not been a patron in about a year.  If it were a choice between being hungry and eating at Strokos, I would knaw on my thumb.Yes, I like this place thaaat much.It's not that their food stinks.  It's actually decent.  They have $4 pizza slices, semi decent pastas and overpriced drinks.Being the stickler for service that I am, it's their weakest link.Every time I was a patron here in the past, it was not the greatest experience even when it's not busy.The final straw was when I was paying for lunch and realized I was $1 short and just had enough for my pizza but not my rice pudding.I let the cashier know that I couldn't take the rice pudding and he threw it back at me stating I shouldn't have taken it to begin with if I had no money and commanded me to put it back.Good going Strokos.  That's the way to get loyal customers.",3,2,2

And even after I was done with college, they still remembered my face and how I liked my sandwich!! Yaay. The downside is its pricey, perhaps the  neighborhood is to be blamed.

The prices are *slightly* high, but not prohibitavely so.I haven't actually sat down in there yet, as I need to grab lunch and get back to work. But in that respect, Strokos does fine. Wait times are reasonable. Occasionally it takes slightly too long when the place is swamped by the school crowd, but they handle that well.If you're in the area, definately a good place to grab lunch.",,,
63,H K.,"Bronx, NY",0,10,1,1.0,10/17/2012,"The only reason to eat here is because it's convenient. The food is so-so, the cold drinks are warm, the coffee is deplorable, the prices are high, and they can't fulfill a simple sandwich order correctly.  A fresh turkey on white bread with salt, pepper and extra mayo (I repeated the order twice) was delivered with the barest amount of mayo possible and so much pepper it looked like soot on the bread.  And the service is just as mentioned by others - you're treated like cattle and the manager is rude.  The John Jay discount is fairly new and in my experience, I've had to ask for it, despite the very obvious John Jay ID I wear on a lanyard.  (the discount used to be for Fordham Law School only even though that's a few blocks away and John Jay is across the street, but I guess others complained like I did).",1,,
