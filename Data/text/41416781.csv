This place is a real gem where the bartenders are REAL mixologist. I am a vodka soda girl myself but watching the way they make cocktails is so amazing. I have yet to try anything more than the fries but its not because o haven't tried. I'm sure on one of my next visits I will be trying a few dishes and I'm super excited about it.Overall this place has great bartenders (if you get Derek you are in great hands) who will and can make you any drink that you are craving.",,,
1,Sam V.,"New York, NY",81,189,468,5.0,9/19/2018,Came late Saturday night for a drink with the ladies. we sat by the bar booths. The back area where the bathroom is looked pretty chill and spacious which would be perfect for a bigger group. The beer selection wasn't extensive but I was happy with the IPAs they offered. We were overcharged for one cocktail but the waitress corrected it as soon as we told her. Not too sure how the food is tho. Waitress was also super attentive which is rare on a Saturday night.,,,

Updated review","I stopped into Rye House for some cocktails with friends on a Saturday afternoon.  The beer hall-ish long tables in the back room were all empty, but there were a few patrons in the front bar area.  We were able to grab a high-top booth and debated which of the creative signature cocktails we were each going to select.  I went with the Her Red Lipstick, a drink as fiery as it sounded.  Its simple base of Brooklyn Vodka had been infused with sultry ingredients like Lime, Ginger, Hibiscus, House Made Habañero, and Mint.  Its bright red color was similarly seductive.  I absolutely loved the heavy kick of ginger as well.  Rye House was a great place for casual drinks and conversation.",5,3,7
4,C N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,2,1.0,10/27/2018,"Looking for late night dining and drinks, we decided to try Rye House. Unfortunately what we found was subpar food at premium prices. Should have heeded the servers lukewarm enthusiasm when we inquired on several menu items. All three food items ordered were below average and terribly overpriced. Too many choices in the city with excellent food. I'll take my hunger elsewhere.",,,
5,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4308,3309,4.0,11/24/2017,"I came here with some friends for a drink before dinner. While the bar was packed (happy hour was ending), the room in back was actually pretty empty and less loud. Most of the seating in back is communal, long tables with long benches.We just got drinks. I don't even like gin, but the Baroness cocktail was delicious. My bourbon drink was good too - can't remember its name, though, because the Baroness was so good, ha! Bloody Mary had too much salt and not enough of that spicy flavor.It goes without saying, but their bourbon, whiskey, and scotch list is solid and nicely organized, so it's easy to find something that works for you.",4,1,5

The atmosphere was warm and light; good for a late dinner with friends. The bar area was tight and crowded, but the dinner room did not have that feeling.The drink menu was just as big as the food menu which made picking hard. A few of us ended up trying the blackberry lemonade and were not disappointed. It was made with bourbon, which is not necessarily a favorite of mine, but the drink was SO GOOD.We got three of each of the bites and appetizers. Everything was really good. Some favorites were the fried pickles, the jerky, cheese curds, voodoo shrimp, duck quesadilla, and truffle grilled cheese. My one thing I would say is that the cheese curds weren't really cheese curds. They were more like mozzarella, but still really tasty!",2,,1

Updated review","Last couple times I've been here have been pretty disappointing.  The drinks just aren't up to par anymore.  I used to always try really interesting, new (to me) drinks here and now when I go everything just tastes the same-a little too sweet and a little too strong, not well balanced at all.  When you combine that with the price it just doesn't work.  They continue to have a good whiskey selection and the drafts tend to be special editions and stuff, which is cool.",4,2,3

Dim lighting and a social aspect, the front had a good bar to watch games where the back was more restaurant style.We got the fries Mac and cheese and the wings for an appetizer, the wings were mediocre with a smokey flavoring but the mac and cheese balls were phenomenal, very rich almost tasted like they had a smoked Gouda taste.I got the truffle grilled cheese, which was great it hit the spot but nothing that stood out  extremely.  However, I got fries instead of the salad.I will be back for sure.",,,1
12,MK M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",270,335,93,1.0,4/26/2018,"I wanted to like this place, the food is good (Cuban sandwich) and the whiskey selection is amazing. What kills this place is the lack of professionalism from the staff. I had a brunette server who hung out at the bar the entire time and was so Loud and so immature. She was talking about how anyone over her height was her type (talking about pedestrians on the street) asking the bartender to take pics of her drinking whiskey at the bar (then saying it was ""instagram"" worthy) drinking beer at the bar and saying how it was hitting her hard. Overall it was like leaving you ADHD kids at home and viewing security cameras of what they did. The bartender started to whip out his phone and texted for awhile while I was finished with my food and was gonna asked about the beer. I sat there with my card in my hand while I watched him text and watching the soccer game on tv. Instead was like nope I'mNot staying. I gave him cash of 10 dollars and asked for changed; he said ""thank you very much cheers "" and took all my cash. Overall I have asked for money back but I don't know if they were drunk or just extremely stupid. I just wanted to leave and go somewhere else, which I did.",2,,

For the price you pay for mediocre service in this area you get food a step above leftover diner food. Had I known they do not even provide air conditioning I would have promptly left. The filet mignon sandwich tasted more like chuck steak. The fish tacos were trash, don't bother. The crab cakes were decent... but would have tasted better had there been AC.

So, we stumble into Rye House and are instantly greeted by two VERY EXCITED bartenders. Our VERY EXCITED bartenders are certainly getting into the holiday spirit, and insist we take shots to ""catch up"". We do not decline. We order a few cocktails, which were just average. Maybe it was my poor selection, maybe it's all their capable of. Who knows. At this point, I just had a strong whiskey shot so I'm not up to complaining. I needed a snack so I ordered the crab cakes. These were the meatiest crab cakes I've ever had. Frankly, I don't know how they even held together because all I could see was crab.

It is larger space, which is always a better option than standing in packed bar. Very nicely lit, classy and bustling with people. Once sat at the bar, the bartender immediately gave us cocktails menus and recommendations. Per his request, I ordered the ""Wake Up Call"", which certainly lived up to its name! This drink packed a punch with jalapeno-infused bourbon and flavors of cinnamon, honey and mint. Delicious! Be mindful of the standards Manhattan cocktails prices though - drinks can range between $12-$14. A little off the beaten path compared to our usual going out spots, but we will return to try out more of their unique drinks and food!",1,,

For our food I ordered us the fried pickles which were pretty good and my main meal was fish tacos which were also pretty good. My sister got shrimp and grits, I tasted the grits but I do not like cheese in my grits and they definitely had cheese so not something I would order but my sister liked it.

26,John L.,"Orlando, FL",49,287,117,4.0,5/9/2016,"A group of 4 of us were on our way somewhere else and needed to kill a little time.  We only wanted drinks and they have plenty of drinks.  We didn't try their food, but it looked like the people eating were enjoying themselves.As I've come to find is typical in Manhattan, the seating isn't comfortable and the bathrooms are always an adventure.  Not a good adventure.  The drink menu is 100% hipster, but they sort of just sell that idea from the second you walk in the front door.  This isn't a place to stop and have a beer with your buddies.  This is froo-froo drinks and everything has *something you've never heard of-bitters* in it.  They had an excellent whisky selection and some beers.  Of course, the beers were extremely over-priced.  You know you're paying bar prices, this is a business they are running, but I always feel violated when 1 beer costs what a 12-pack costs at the store.  I'll give you some leeway, but not that much.Our server was aces.  She reminded me of Rachel Ray, so much so that I kept expecting her to add ""delish"" or ""EVOO"" to each sentence.  She was helpful and very sweet.The drinks were mostly good, maybe only one true stinker in the group, but they were so convoluted.  Each drink seemed to have a laundry list of ingredients.  If that's your thing, you'll be in heaven.I'm still giving it 4 stars because it was a good place, just too complicated for our group's taste.",2,2,
27,Alyssa G.,"Palisades Park, NJ",1196,431,558,4.0,3/2/2016,"While waiting for a book signing to start, my friends and I were in the area and wanted to find a place to grab a drink and eat. So using my trusty Yelp app, I looked up some local restaurants and this one happened to pop up. The inside is bigger than what it appears on the outside. Very cozy, has quite a few tables, and a very nice bar that has a great selection of spirits and craft beer available both by tap & bottle. The cocktail list they had looked wonderful. Today I wasn't in the mood for one and stuck to beer but would love to come back and try one. For city prices, this place wasn't bad at all. The lunch menu was very welcoming and unique. One thing that happened to catch my eye was the truffle grilled cheese. The cheese in the sandwich was a combination of both fontina and goat Gouda cheese, served with a salad that had mushrooms, arugula and taro root in it. My friends decided split that and a chicken pita salad. The salad was average, nothing overly special to make it really stand out but it was extremely fresh. However, the grilled cheese was out of this world. Yes my friends, I didn't think it was possible to use the world grilled cheese and out of this world in the same sentence until now. WOW. Many places I have been to before tend to misunderstand the whole truffle concept but this place right here has nailed it. The sandwich itself had a delicious hint of truffle oil in it and the salad it came with also had the same gentle touch of truffle oil as well. The flavor literally lingered in your mouth in the best of ways. I would easily come back to this place again just to get this meal again. Service was also great. The waitress regularly checked up on us to see how our meal was going, to see if we needed more drinks and to be give us more water. Overall, this was a great find and would highly recommend it! I can not wait to return and I will absolutely be back!",13,5,8

Within 45 mins, the place was crowded and people were leaning over me to get to the bartender. Upon looking at the menu, I decided that I wanted to come back for lunch because a particular sandwich sparked my interest. I sat at the extremely quiet bar during mid-week lunch hour, ordered a checkered cab blonde ale and a Cuban sandwich. YUM. The sandwich was just what I wanted it to be, a little pulled pork, a little ham, gruyere cheese and just a touch of mustard and mayo. It was toasted perfectly and served with melt in your mouth homemade chips. After eating every last bite, I sat there and finished my beer. Very odd little lunch crowd, with several customers sitting and doing work on their laptops, but there was no music and not many distractions. A bit overpriced for lunch (sandwich was $14) but it was worth it.",,,

I like that they don't ""try too hard"" with their mixology, focusing on basic ingredients that go well together. I had a deliciously refreshing gin cocktail when I was there.I also think their selection of bites is really well done. We started with some of the truffle popcorn. My only complaint is that I wanted more! We had a decent cheese plate (maybe not their strength but definitely decent) and some popcorn shrimp. The popcorn shrimp was awesome and again, my only complaint was that I could have eaten more of them. I have not had a full meal here and I've only been in the front bar a few times, but I would definitely go back to explore more.

36,Danny E.,"Bay Shore, NY",303,67,27,4.0,2/28/2016,"4 stars for the Rye House overall: Turn-ons:- Great food and desserts. Wings and tacos are a home run. - Could be a fun date spot, perhaps a bit too loud for a first date though. - Decently quick service for how busy it was. Turn-offs:- Gets very, very crowded and tight unless you snag a table by ordering food. - Not really a turn off but be prepared to spend some money if you want to have a good time and experiment with some whiskey. *** WING REVIEW: 3.25 / 5 ***As always, I had to try the wings here. They offer BBQ and HOT and I went with the latter. Don't worry, they're not very hot at all, but tasty, yes. What I liked about these wings aside from the nice cook on the meat was the subtlety of the buffalo sauce. Many times I will stay away from a classic buffalo wing because of the heavy acidity associated with the glaze; you get tired of the flavor very quickly. And God forbid you have some sort of cut on your hands... But here, that wasn't the case. I feel that the meat to sauce and flavor balance was spot on. Not a mind-blowing wing but definitely a contender. The biggest problem was that they don't give you enough; you're going to want more.",,,

They have a great rum selection consisting of everything from Diplomatico Venezuelan rum to Zacapa Centario. This is obviously my main reason for coming here...

62,Lawrence H.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",960,187,413,5.0,3/7/2015,"Tucked away on quiet 17th street, Rye House is many types of bars in one. It's a gastropub, beer bar, upscale cocktail bar, and whiskey aficionado bar. Depending on what you're in the mood for that evening, you can choose to try one or all of its incarnations. One night I came and ordered a Clara Bow, one of their signature cocktails. The cocktail has been featured in SeriousEats and is a great balance of bourbon, lemon, grenadine, St. Germaine, and mint. My friend with an aversion to whiskey tasted it and actually liked it: tart, sweet, refreshing, and balanced.Another evening, I experienced Rye House as gastropub and whiskey tasting room. Seated at the bar, I tasted different types of whiskey, from Bulleit Rye to different single malt scotches from Islay. I noshed on Mac 'n' Cheese and fried pickles, and washed it all down with a pint of their beer of the month.The service is no-nonsense and unerringly kind, though on some nights it can get very busy and you may find yourself standing awkwardly in the middle of the entryway trying to find a barstool or side table. Fear not, for there is ample communal table style seating in the back, though it does lack a view. I don't mind being patient up front, standing, and waiting for a seat.

We wanted to try some whisky we didn't have at home, and she had the bartender pour us a few samples of different whiskers to help us choose. Right away, I'm loving this place because you never know what you are going to get when you hit some of the smaller distilleries out there.I ended up with a decent whisky from India (I had to, so odd but good!) and my husband sipped on a local whisky.I got the duck quesadillas because of all the reviews about them and my husband got a burger, which he enjoyed. However, the duck quesadillas were outstanding. The duck was well balanced with the cheese and it was a savory delight. The little salad with cherries that accompanied it was just as good and helped to balance the heft of,all that cheese with its tangy vinaigrette.

The food here is casual with a mix of creative sandwiches and salads with interesting appetizers like the pickled quail eggs and the beef jerky interestingly goes very well with the beer selection and cocktails. The front bar is usually full of patrons having a good time while the dining area in the back in contrast is bit more rusticated and darker.While this casual establishment was neglected by me far too long.  It has become the favorite place for us to grab a drink or food in the neighborhood.,1,1,1

The bar space in front is almost always crowded (and I thought I got out of work early!) but the servers are pretty open about letting you sit at the tables in the more spacious area in the back. (It feels a bit like a less glamorous ""Great Hall"" from HP/Cambridge.) Sometimes, they do give you a time limit at the tables if you don't order food (e.g. 1.5 hours), but it's not unreasonable.While prices aren't the cheapest, their menu is more diverse than most with cocktails (I like their ""Wake Up Call"" with jalapeno infused bourbon with honey, cinnamon, lime), wine, beer (stout nitro!), vintage bottles of whiskey, whiskey flights, other spirits, and some food too. Haven't tried the duck quesadillas myself, but I've only heard good things!It's definitely not a speakeasy, but more of a ""nice"" beer hall with a cozy bar, especially in the winter.

80,Chad R.,"Denver, CO",52,157,0,3.0,10/20/2014,"Stopped in for lunch while shopping for vintage jewelry-- the name caught my eye and I'm always, always down for an old fashioned.Wasn't asked for a preference of bourbon or whiskey, which I thought was strange. Didn't think it an unreasonable expectation, but thought I'd see what came out. No biggie. It was a decent bourbon, though, and maybe I should've made my rye preference known.Enjoyed a reasonably priced lunch special-- the frisee salad was fresh, and the fish tacos were on point. Def seasoned correctly.A previous yelper mentioned the brand here, but I didn't get the feeling it'd established one at all.  The bartender was takin' care of the 6 or so patrons in the place while the (I'm guessing) manager rapped to a young lady who also worked there.  Just didn't seem too concerned with much, and while it didn't affect me, it also didn't provide much of an experience, which is primarily what I look for in a joint.Additionally, there's a way to shake the cocktails, and there's a way to sling 'em around like a four year old who just discovered the sound maracas make. A nice quiet joint like this don't need no AH-ROCK-AH-ROCK-AH-ROCK three hundred times a minute for two minutes straight at a hundred twenty decibels (the equivalent of a ship's engine room, Google tells me, which I thought the perfect comparison).There's nothing wrong with this place.

I didn't expect anyone to help me out or take my order since I was one in a million, tucked away in a corner, pressed against the wall, unable to take off my coat. Sadly, I found my Manhattan quite harsh and unpleasant. I'm not sure if it was the type of rye they used or if that particular drink was mixed improperly, but it just tasted nothing like a Manhattan. To make it worse, it was one of the most expensive Manhattans I've ever had. :/I'm sad that my experience was such a downer, and I'd love to try it again when it's less crowded.

Other than Flatiron Lounge, you'd be hard-pressed to beat Rye House for an after-work drink in the area.",11,7,7
93,Raphael D.,"Brooklyn, NY",358,421,56,3.0,12/1/2013,Oh Rye House. When the wait times at Raines exceed that of a day at the DMV you fit the bill quite nicely. In addition to the spacious layout they have a very impressive selection of whiskey and a cocktail list to match it. It gets pretty packed after 10pm (when a certain other bar's wait is at its highest) so if you wanna get a table you wanna err on the earlier side of the evening.Also mac n cheese balls. Yea. You're gonna order those.,3,4,3

95,Katrina L.,"Manhattan, NY",175,378,98,3.0,11/18/2014,"They have an extensive selection of whiskey and some pretty good cocktails. I liked The Gardener cocktail as well as the beer and hard cider they carry.This place gets jam packed by the bar area. There is table seating in the back, but is only available for those dining. However, many of the tables are left vacant while those here for drinks only are crammed in the front. When I went to the restroom in the back of the dining area, I noticed that no one was eating, only drinking, with many tables available. It would've made sense to open up seating to drinkers when dinner service is slow to ease the crowd in the front and to not lose both current and potential customers wandering in because of the uncomfortable arrangement.+ variety of whiskey and other liquors+ good cocktails+ beer and hard cider options- gets too crowded and loud- uncomfortable and nonsensical use of space",,,
96,Stephen M.,"New York, NY",6,25,0,1.0,11/15/2013,"This review is less a commentary on food or drinks that Rye House has to offer - which I've generally found to be good - and more on a really disappointing experience I had there last night.Some friends and I popped in last night after one friend's work event to get a cocktail and some food.  After being told the kitchen was closed and only snack food was available, we proceeded to order a round (5 drinks) and a bunch of chips and popcorn for our little group.  At this point, my friend offered up the Crumbs cupcakes she'd gotten from the work event.  When I asked the waitress for a few little plates and a knife, she told me that she couldn't and if we wanted to know why, we'd have to speak to the manager.  I, of course, said, ""Sure, let's talk to the manager.""We were told that we couldn't have plates because the cupcakes were outside food and allowing us to eat them would be against Rye House's policy.  There was some back and forth between us and the manager, but needless to say, we weren't very happy with this response.  Manager leaves, us still shaking our heads in disbelief - it is, after all, around midnight and late enough that they aren't even serving food anymore - and about 10 minutes later my friend, still hungry, starts eating one of the cupcakes.  Not one minute later, the manager runs back over - this time with a bouncer! - and tells my friend to stop eating the cupcake.My friend says, ""you've got to be f**king kidding me,"" at which point the bouncer points at my friend and says, ""hey, watch your language in here.""  After pointing out to the manager the complete absurdity of the situation - asking a bouncer to accompany him, all to reprimand us for, yup, eating a cupcake - we gathered up our belongings and walked out the door.  You would have thought we'd brought our own booze into the place, or we'd started a fight with other customers.So, cupcake lovers beware.  Though your cocktails may be handcrafted and the location convenient, last night's handling of the most innocent possible situation ensures that I will never spend another dollar there.",4,1,1
97,Hilary H.,"Washington, DC",2861,1167,1672,4.0,10/23/2013,"A nice little lunch option, especially if you're on somewhat of a budget and in a tad of a rush. We were seated, fed, and on our way on under 45 minutes which may not sound all that impressive, but considering the amount of food, the level of service and the time of day it really is. They have a lunch special that includes a salad and a sandwich for $16 -- generously portioned salads and an entire sandwich. The service was friendly and quick, and I was shocked by how empty the place was on a Monday at lunchtime seeing as the food and service are both quite good. My frisee salad was fresh and tasty, and the felafel pocket I had was wonderful - bright, freshly-fried falafel with crisp veggies and a very, very, very garlicky babaganoush. I was glad this was served on the side, actually -- it's pretty strong and perhaps not the best thing to eat if you're planning to be sharing space with other people all day. On the whole, great spot. I'd definitely go back for lunch again.",4,1,2

The service is awful - seriously awful. They always seem confused about table availability and are abrupt or un-attentive to the patrons. The food and specialty cocktails, however, are actually all quite good. My favorite is the spicy bourbon cocktail and the mussels are very tasty. I recommend the mac-and-cheese balls too, a decadent treat. If you can find a good spot at the bar, which is really hard to do Thurs-Sun, where you don't have to rely on any waitstaff service, then more power to ya. Good luck with that.",,,
99,Neal K.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,0,2.0,2/28/2015,"Went for brunch a few Sunday's ago. It was 1pm, a few diners were there. Overall, pretty dead for Sunday brunch. Coffee was lukewarm and tasted horrible. Waitress replaced with an Americano (although she said they don't have an espresso machine???). Me and my friend had the burger, ordered medium rare. Another had the skillet breakfast. Burger: cooked medium, not medium rare. The meat inside has a slimy texture and was not any color of beef I have ever seen. It was grey brown. It was edible (I had blue cheese which helped) but the texture was simply unpalatable. The fries were average and bit too greasy. Skillet: tried the sausage... Again, funky off tasting meat. Tasted stale and reheated. The accompanying rye toast was good.Service was average. Had to find our waitress a few times but she was nice.I would never eat here again nor do I recommend it. There are way to many places nearby to get decent food that is at a good value. A breakfast skillet and burger are staples and standards and should be perfect, no matter how not busy a place is. A place like this can thrive in NYC only bc the sheer number of people in the area and the fact that it's a bar. It's sad that they get away with serving food at all.",,,

The bartender was extremely nice and noticed everytime a guest had joined me and made sure to promptly ask for their order. I made reservations for 5, so when everyone arrived, we were seated within 15 minutes. Cute area in the back away from the crowded front but still lively. 3 of us got the grilled cheese. After all the rave reviews, I may have expected it to be a little better but it was still delicious. Not the best I ever had, but i would definitely come back and order it again.

I hesitated but eventually decided to try the Rye House (side note: I love whisky!). Upon entering I hear some beautiful old school jazz at a decent volume, setting a nice, relaxing yet not sleepy atmosphere. I look to see what whiskey I will try today & am handed a menu which includes an extensive Spirit menu with all the whiskeys broken down in to types (Rye, Bourbon, Scotch, World, etc) & their prices. I was happy to see it broken down in such a way so there is no further questioning. The bartender was nice. I order the sandwhich & a Corsair Triple Smoke Whiskey with Coke. I LOVED this drink! The sandwich came with fries. The fries were cooked well- crunchy outside, soft inside. The sandwich kinda reminded me of an old Wendy's commercial, Nice size bun but, ""Where's the beef?"" Though it could have used a few more slices of meat, the taste was pretty good, so I wasn't too disappointed. Although the dessert menu sounded really good I decided to have a second drink instead (I told you I loved this drink!). I'll try the dessert next time around. Especially since they played Billie Holiday. Quick note: the price for the spirits does not include an extra dollar if you decide to get it with Coke (or any other flavor), as I found out when I got the receipt.

I'm OK with places being crowded but this was a little overkill. To top it off, I couldn't hear myself think, it was so loud. The service was pretty poor and it took quite a while to get menus and drinks. My drink was mediocre at best. The bill was huge and I felt compelled to go elsewhere. I wouldn't return.",,,

As for the service, unfriendly would be an understatement.  There's one bartender who seems to have a great distaste for people in general and she openly expresses it.  Even if you prefer to sit at the bar as we do, sit at a table to avoid the angry glares of said bartender - you'll have a better experience.",,,

There were far more people up front in the bar getting sloshed than sitting down in the back dining room having a bite to eat in order to best soak up the impending alcohol binge--it was Friday night, after all.Additionally, there are only two restrooms, so any puking will have to be reserved for a well thought out time and place. After all, there is a place and time for everything. So, as you can tell, the vibe was very... lively. In fact, some drunk girl came and sat next to us and rattled on forever about how the restroom situation sucks.Onto the actual drinks. How often can you order a drink called Hog Wild and actually find classic components that actually play off this theme? Not too often. This one possesses a heavy dosing of Buffalo Trace--infused with some smoky bacon, sweet vermouth, some bitters, and cherry. My tongue was numb... was this the effect? I hope so, because I liked it.The layout of this joint as a whole felt very warehouse like, almost like there shouldn't be a need to sit down for a full meal. Perhaps they need to get their identity down. Fortunately, I liked the drinks, though they were way overpriced. Give it a shot if you are at all into scotch, scotch, scotch, scotch.

156,Samantha M.,"Westchester County, NY",55,39,9,4.0,6/21/2013,"If you are a whiskey aficionado, this is someplace that you cannot miss. As someone who's been sipping scotch since I was a toddler, the drink list had me salivating before I even walked in the door. Their cocktails look pretty enticing, but the 100+ offerings on their spirits' list was what I was there for. With headings separating the Bourbons from the Scotch from the Rye, it was pretty easy to simply close my eyes and point to something - whatever I landed on hit the spot. While they had the generic Jameson and Jack Daniels selections, I loved that I was able to sample smoky and spicy international whiskey from Japan, India, and Sweden as well. For anyone who isn't a huge rye fan, there's also an ample amount vodka, tequila, gin and rum on the menu.While the alcohol choices are staggering, another draw to Rye House is the food. Since we came here predominantly to drink, we just split an order of the duck quesadillas. After eating them, I would have willingly ordered anything else on the menu. They were out of this world, the sole gran queso complimenting the juicy-not-greasy duck and cherry garnish perfectly. It was probably one of the best things I've eaten this year. Everything else on the menu looks delicious, too, and when I go back I'm definitely getting some truffle beer cheese and fried pickles to go with my drink.I really liked the atmosphere of this place, too. It looks like a dive from the outside, and I was still a little skeptical once I was in there because of how crowded the narrow bar area was. It really opens up in the back though, with long oak tables providing ample seating and intimate booths along the walls for more cozy conversations. The antique light fixtures and decorations gave it a cool old-timey vibe. Our waiter was great and very patient with me during my whiskey selection process - he was more than helpful in describing the tastes of everything so that I could pick a good one. I left Rye House with a full stomach, a light head, and a few more liquors on my list to order in the future.",,,

158,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",306,626,196,1.0,2/21/2010,"I've been wanting to come here since it opened and I finally had my chance last night.  Service is abominable.  I really can't even describe our experience here, but I'll try.  We walked in last Saturday night around 1AM.  The door guy was friendly and we walked straight to the end of the bar.  We stood there for about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged.  By acknowledged, I mean the bartend made brief eye contact.  Two minutes later a bar-back walked by and I asked if I could see a cocktail menu.  We looked over the list and my 2 friends decided what they wanted, however I had some questions, as I did not see any fun vodka drinks on the menu, and my other friend was still deciding.The bartender from the other end of the bar came over and stood next to us with another cocktail waitress.  I asked her if she could recommend something made with vodka.  She looked at me like an idiot and said, ""Well obviously the Fleur de Lis can be made with vodka.""  Well obviously I was supposed to know that.  Wait, how in the hell was I supposed to know that?!?  She then said that I should just get it with gin because it's really good and you can't taste the gin.  I told her that I don't like gin.  She again said I should just get it with gin because it's good.  You know what?  I effin' hate gin whether I can taste it or not.  So screw you and your pretentious attitude.  If I'm paying for the drink, please don't try and make me order something made with an ingredient that I hate.  She also told me I could get the Mansfield made with vodka.  I told her to just make the Fleur de Lis with vodka.While the girl bartender was making our drinks at the other end of the bar.  The male bartender finally came over to us, greeted us and handed us menus.  I told him we already ordered, but I needed a drink added to the order.  He said he would pass the information along to the other bartender.  Surprisingly, he did not.Our drinks were delivered and I told the girl bartender that we still needed another drink.  While she was making the drink the male bartender came over and profusely apologized for not telling the girl bartender about the other drink.  I told him it was fine and asked him to break a $20.  He said no problem and arrived back with $8 change.  So apparently when you say break a bill here it means to pay for a drink.The bar-back walked by us and I asked if he could get the female bartender at the end of the bar.  He said, ""Yeah, but why do you have a problem?""  I explained to him that the male bartender cashed out one of our drinks instead of breaking the $20 and I don't want to be accused of short changing the bartender, so I need to talk to her.  She was at the other end of the bar and showed no signs of coming back over.  The bar-back went over and got her.The female bartender came over confused as ever and couldn't follow what happened.  I explained it to her twice.  She walked over to the male bartender and it explained it to him and he was confused.  Finally she came back over and said, ""Oh so yeah, you only owe me for two drinks now.""  Needless to say, the exchange was annoying.  Actually, the whole process of getting a drink was annoying.  Had the bartender at our end of the bar stopped chatting it up with clients for two seconds and helped waiting customers the female bartender wouldn't have been running from one end of the bar down to us and back.  It should also be noted that when our drinks were finally delivered, in a rude manner we were told to leave the bar area because we were crowding the service area.  Okay, I get that we were standing by the service area, but the way the bartender asked us to move was down right rude.  It could have been said in a much nicer way, instead we just felt completely unwelcomed.When we were sitting in a booth in the back, our candle was removed and blown out in front of us after they announced last call.  How rude.  It's not like we're going to camp out in the booth for the whole evening.  We heard last call, we know they were closing up, but was it really necessary for you to blow the candle out in our faces?  All in all, a more than crappy experience.  Definitely will never be returning for the service was horrible and the drinks were overpriced, small and somewhat shitty.",3,2,

The cocktail menu has a few adventuresome options to choose from or if you're a beer person they've got some off the beaten path choices as well. Their food is quite decadent, which is another way of saying that  pretty much everything is fried or comes with something fried.

They corrected it though. Service wasn't BAD, but there were about 4 people that waited on us. That's a little confusing as you don't know who's really your server, and frankly makes tipping a little confusing. I guess if you're splitting tips it doesn't matter, but it's nice to have one steady presence throughout your meal. And then you don't get asked the same thing three times, or reverse, things don't get forgotten because someone assumed someone else did it.

I end up just sticking with jack/cokes so I'm not able to give you a really great idea of how good they are, but others in my party really appreciated their specialty drinks for which the place is known. You'll spend 12+ on each drink but that can vary. the food is tough to explain but is anything but ""normal"". so if you get there on the early side, have a hankering for really tasty drinks with brown liquor and like tasting foods that are filling but a bit weird, go here.",,,

For our ""snack"" we ordered the beer cheese and an entree of moules frites cooked in Omegang broth.  For drinks, being in a place called Rye, you've gotta order the whiskey.  So I did the American Whisky Flight for $25.The beer cheese came smothered over two slices of thick cut bread and the moules frites came in a small bowl with a small cup of fries.  I don't think the beer cheese was worth $8.00 (IIRC) but the moules frites were awesome.  The mussels were cooked to perfection and the broth they were sitting in was a pretty incredible, not to mention the mussels were freakin huge!  Probably twice as large as what I usually see.  Top everything off with a flight of whiskey and I was one happy camper.",,,

183,George D.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,409,656,3.0,6/8/2012,"I 'm a martini or scotch nut at the point that I'm writing this. So I'm a little biased by the fact that they didn't have Stolichnaya for my dirty martini. They offered a variety of others though. The heart wants what it wants, as do the taste buds. I do plan to come back for the $30 scotch sampler. Very nice atmosphere. Warm lighting that blends nicely with the wood and brick interior. Our waitress was attentive. The burger was tasty. Not astounding, but tasty. The fires actually stole the show on my plate if that is any indication. My friend gave her meal a trio of stars. I'd say the highlight of this place so far is the service.",,,

185,Michelle E.,"Astoria, NY",18,29,17,3.0,11/28/2011,"Rye House was OK, definitely not great. I tried this place out this past Saturday at around 730p with my husband, my cousin & his partner. Service was standard, nothing special and the drink list was pretty extensive which was nice. I ordered the Rye Burger with Gruyere cheese medium. It came out a bit more like medium well so that was a bit disappointing. Prices were fair. For the four of us (we each order 3 drinks and had a mid-priced entree) came to $190 (including tip). If I'm in the area I would go again but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",1,,
186,Jean Marie N.,"Arlington, VA",7,18,5,5.0,12/7/2015,"We were in NYC this weekend visiting from the DC area. We decided to head to The Rye House since we both enjoy handcrafted cocktails. While we did not get the chance to have lunch or dinner here, the cocktails were so tasty that we came here twice during our stay in the city. The ""Trust Fall"" was my favorite since it was seasonal and had cinnamon and apple flavors, and we also enjoyed the ""Cafe Mexicana"", ""Wake Up Call"" and ""Red Hot Lipstick"". Do yourself a favor and check this place out! I also heard the guy next to me at the bar say how great the cuban sandwich was - he was a local that went often. The bartender Rafael was fantastic as well and was very personable!",,,
187,Henry S.,"Cary, NC",102,115,190,5.0,8/3/2011,"When you want bartenders who know their spirits & bitters, this is the place to go.  It has become my go to place when I'm in the mood to try new whiskeys & rums.  On a Saturday afternoon there's plenty of room to hang out with a nice scotch glass.  After work it gets crowded, but never to the point where you're bumping elbows or yelling over each other.A very sophisticated place without the snootiness.",2,,

The patrons are a stuffy as are the bartenders, but the decor is lovely.  A lone TV constantly on mute is a waste, but at least you can get score checks.  I loved their butternut squash soup, but the fried mac n' cheese was a waste of gluten.",,,
190,Jaci H.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,301,33,2.0,3/2/2012,"Came here for brunch with a few of my lady friends with a deal from Savored, which offers 30% off the total bill (including booze).  We were seated right away, even though our whole party wasn't there yet.  The decor is really cute with a bit of a country, horse theme.  There weren't too many tables when were there, but the place slowly filled up as time went on.The first HUGE issue with this restaurant is that there was ONE server for the entire place.  Brunch on a Sunday, really?  One server??  I would have felt bad for her except she wasn't that nice and didn't really care at all about servicing us.  She was very much like a robot, going from table to table and doing the bare minimum to get us the hell out of there.  We tried to be extremely nice and as easy as possible but it didn't seem to make much difference.I ordered a bloody mary while we waited for one last friend to arrive.  It took about 15 minutes for my freaking drink to come to the table.  We all ordered as soon as we could for fear of the wait and the fact that so many more tables arrived.  It took another 5 minutes to get her attention to even put in the order.  She didn't even bring us water right away.  It was really starting to piss me off cause I was a little hung over and needed some liquids in me, stat. I was hoping to try the fried chicken and waffles, but it was no longer offered.  They need to update their online menus :( I ordered the steak and eggs, which sounded like a good idea.  One friend ordered the Rye Fry, which had a bit of everything.  She can't eat gluten so she asked for grits or something else instead.  They didn't care to substitute it and so she ordered a side of grits anyway.  They ended up bringing out a bunch of toast to the table for who knows what reason and it went uneaten.  Total waste.My other friends ordered the biscuits and gravy, which I was initially jealous about since the biscuits have cheddar and I can't eat cheese.  I have to say their food looked gross.  The sausage gravy was so thick it looks like meat sauce for pasta.  It wasn't really gravy to tell you the truth, it was just meaty mush all over the poached eggs and the biscuit.  They said it was just okay, but the consistency was weird.  They pushed most of the gravy to the side and just ate the eggs and biscuits, which really isn't worth $12 if you ask me. As for my food, I was extremely underwhelmed.   I was supposed to get a NY Strip Steak but it was just a bunch of slices of beef.  Don't give me a freaking steak cut up for me like I'm 5 years old.  When I order a steak, I was a STEAK!  It was cooked medium, as I requested, but it was really flavorless.  The eggs were too well done, so that was a total waste and the home fries were really bland and bad.  I ate my food because I was starving.  It took over an hour from the moment we were seated to order food and get the food.  It was a total nightmare!Even the bloody mary was gross, it was so thick it was like syrup.  Yuck!In the end I had to remind the server to apply the 30% discount but she ended up getting an automatic 18% gratuity, which she most definitely didn't deserve.  Whatever, maybe she can buy herself a smile or something.  The only up side of the place is the bartender who was helping her out.  He was super nice and tried is best to help out.  Thanks dude - you were really working hard that day, making up for your coworkers lack of enthusiasm. I would avoid this place for food if I were you.  A total let down since the menu is really appealing. Another thing to remember is they serve everything on tiny plates, so you really don't get a lot of food.   Considering this a warning to most men and plenty of ladies out there with a real appetite - you will leave hungry.",,,
191,Paige C.,"Hickory, NC",7,1,0,3.0,1/21/2013,"Cool little restaurant and atmosphere. However, the service was not the best. It was completely too much for the waitress to take our drink orders and check our coats and  after placing our drink orders we didn't see her for at least 35 min. After bringing our drinks, she promptly left without asking us if we were ready to order--which we were. Finally, she returned and who knows how long after, our food arrived. The food was okay. Nothing to right home to Mom about. We each had different things and passed them around--taquitos, perogies, grilled cheese, salads, fried pickles (these were absolutely delicious!), and boiled peanuts. Besides the fried pickles, we all left saying, ""well, that was...fine.""",,,

194,Holly O.,"Philadelphia, PA",63,71,0,4.0,4/30/2012,"Went here with a girlfriend this weekend around 5 on saturday for a couple of drinks and a snack. We sat in the bar area, sharing a four top with another pair. Twas a little awkaward at first because we both thought the couple may have been on a first date. The food and service were good. Our server switched halfway through but we never had any issues with being ignored or not attended to. We only had beers so I cannot attest to their cocktails. Though I will say this...they were all on the pricey side: $12-15. Beers on tap were a more reasonable $7. Nice selection of local and craft brews. Seems like they also specialize in whiskeys as they had a few whiskey specials and a page of tastings to choose from if that's your flavor.  We ordered the mussels and fries and asparagus salad. Both were excellent. Good portion size for the mussels. They were fresh, plump and tasty and the fries accompanying them were great. We both loved the salad too. It had fresh, light flavors that paired well with our ""snacky"" vibe. The atmosphere was relaxed and chill. Great place to talk and catch up which is exactly what we wanted. Oh, and loved that the one tv they have was on mute the whole time.",,,
195,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",30,105,75,4.0,5/3/2011,"I started drinking American rye in the eighties, and haven't really stopped.  So when I walked past this place's sign on my way to check out the High Line one afternoon this past weekend, I did an actual take.Rye House?   RYE? HOUSE??Praying that it'd be real, and seeing that it was time for a drink in any case, I crept in.  Spotted a bottle of Old Overholt straight away, sat myself at the bar in front of it.  Peered at the other bottles.Oh, mercy. These muffuggers had a rye *SECTION*.   Asked for their whisky list.  Not the largest I've seen in scope, but definitely the best-curated one. More ryes than I knew existed, a well-selected Bourbon offering, and many of my old school favorite Scotch malts and Irishes.  The other liquors along the bar seemed to be chosen with some care, as well.  And at my elbow, I noticed at least three different brands of bitters....I had stumbled into a bona fide otaku-level whiskitorium.  Four stars, strictly for the impressiveness of their inventory.Had a quick Templeton and water and scooted, because I had plans to find some people and crush their hands.  But I intend to come back to this place next time I'm in town, and sip a few more ryes, and have them make me a few different Manhattans.  I may even have to bring someone to help me drink them all.",2,2,4
