1,Malcolm M.,"Arlington, VA",24,15,8,2.0,9/14/2018,"Not sure what's going on with this place but I ate here as recently as 6 months ago and the food was hot and delicious. Today, room temp and average. I had the boneless fried chicken. Should've known something was up when my order was ready in less than 2 minutes. I mean sh*t, how difficult is it to fry chicken to order. I guess my expectations were too high ‍",1,1,
2,Melissa N.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",7,11,15,5.0,8/30/2018,"I have been waiting to eat here since before they opened, since Chef Daniel Humm posted the news on Instagram. First off, I really wanted to try the Chicken Frites but unfortunately it's only a weekend special and I was only in the City from Tuesday - Thursday. The first visit was on Wednesday (my birthday) and decided to have a small ""snack"", and I decided on a glass of Rosè and Charred Veggies...it was the perfect light meal to keep me exploring the city until dinner. The Veggies were perfectly charred, they were juicy and had a light what seemed like vinegar taste. Yummm. Not to mention I had the Milk and Honey soft serve, it was too sweet for my boyfriend but I have a sweet tooth when it comes to caramel and good quality soft serve. The interior design is simple so you're not so confused when looking at the menu, and the cashier is very well informed on all the items they have. I fell in love with this place so I decided to eat here for dinner my last night on Thursday. We went in about 9:40pm right before they closed but were treated with open arms and were told to take our time to enjoy our meal. I got the Chicken Rice...AMAAAAZING! And my boyfriend got the Braised Short Rib sandwich with a side of fried boneless chicken because he couldn't decide on either sandwich, the braised sandwich was so juicy and well seasoned, the fried chicken was so much better than your average chicken strips. It was a good choice on his part. We weren't able to finish our meals but while asking for to-go boxes they offered us their cute little pie bites free of charge! We mentioned that we were so excited to try this place and came from California knowing this was one of our top spots to visit so they hooked it up EVEN MORE with a free soft serve the next time we visit...which I hope is very soon! I seriously didn't think my first trip to NYC could get any better but they managed to do so. So thank you to the Chefs and Staff, you guys a f**king awesome. :)",,,
3,Tina W.,"New York, NY",36,78,189,5.0,11/18/2018,Stopped in for dinner a couple weeks back because I had seen that they had made some updates to the menu. I had the chicken sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.  I could the sandwich very moist and flavorful. The food was ready pretty quickly and the service was pleasant. I hope to find myself in the neighborhood again around meal time so I can try out some more of the new menu. I saw some other people eating dishes that looked tasty as well.,1,,
4,Alyssa F.,"Long Beach, CA",1575,1092,2721,4.0,6/26/2018,"Healthy, inexpensive food, conveniently located in Midtown. Made Nice focuses on utilizing fresh, local ingredients, and creating meals that are as nourishing as they are delicious. The interior is sleek and modern, with a good amount of seating. You place your order with the cashier, who stands at the front holding an iPad. Their ever-changing seasonal menu offers a concise selection of salads, sandwiches, and whole food plates. Most menu items can be easily modified to be vegetarian or vegan.I got the Peas & Asparagus Salad, which was a large portion for $10. The romaine and chopped snow peas tasted incredibly fresh, with sweetness that was perfectly countered by the tangy lemon vinaigrette. Slivered roasted almonds provided a touch of savory crunch. The salad could have used some type of protein-I was hungry again less than 2 hours after eating it. My boyfriend was interested in the Thai salads featured in many pictures on their Yelp, and was disappointed to find that their new spring menu does not include these, or anything similar. While I am fortunate to have a healthy option in this area, I would not go out of my way to return.",5,3,8
5,Anurag P.,"New York, NY",57,225,322,5.0,7/17/2018,"~ 4.5 stars (rounded up) ~Important: I only came here for the soft serve, and that's all this review is about.The Milk & honey soft serve creation is incredible. The combination of flavors and textures is perfect: the smooth milky ice cream is complemented perfectly by an addicting sweet & salty honey brittle, crumbly shortbread, and crunchy meringue pieces. And of course the whole thing is drizzled in pure honey. Seriously, that honey brittle is crack.It was still amazing despite the fact that they *definitely* skimped on my toppings compared to what I've seen most people get in pictures... I pray that I'm loaded up with toppings next time.As a honey-loving fiend, I will come here regularly as long as this dessert remains on the menu.",1,,
6,Donna S.,"Toronto, Canada",20,112,101,4.0,11/4/2018,"Came here for the first time and beat the rush at noon for lunch before the lineup started.

Look forward to coming back to try something else from their menu.",,,1
7,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,5/3/2018,"For some reason, I was fixated on going to the Nomad Bar on a weekday last week. However, after being told by a small army of indifferent hostesses that the wait would probably be an hour, we found ourselves spat out onto 28th Street and in need of food. Made Nice is one of the few ascendant fast-casual spots I haven't crossed off in Flatiron, so we gave it a try.The space feels a bit corporate, though with nice touches like a dramatic open kitchen and cookbooks on the wall. To continue to counter the fast-casual blues, they have a nice young man taking your order on a tablet in the corner rather than from behind a counter, which is a nice idea but a bit inefficient.They've just switched over to a poultry-centric menu for the season (with appropriate signage about Spring Chickens), though vegetarian options seem easy to come by. They appear to favor thigh over breast, which I'm in full support of. I opted for the Chicken Rice ($14), with thigh and cracklins over rice and tomatoes. My boyfriend ordered an asparagus and cheddar soup ($6).It came out somewhere after 5 minutes. You have to be vigilant as they're calling out your name in a noisy restaurant rather than using a buzzer system. If you have two people, have one saving a seat and the other waiting for food. It's served on a nice black tray that almost looks like slate.The chicken rice is huge and satisfying. Thigh is juicy and cracklins are salty and crunchy. The rice has a nice depth of flavor to it, and the stewed cherry tomatoes added a textural element but not much flavor. I was happy with the dish but not blown away-- I wish there was a sauce or some spice to tie it together. Boyfriend's soup was similarly solid.If I worked in the area, I would be happy to try out a few other dishes, but given the high price point and relatively normal offerings (though well executed), I don't know if this is as much of a destination as its founders have intended it to be.",2,,2
8,Gavie V.,"New York, NY",130,56,94,5.0,8/29/2018,"The first time in May I came was with a colleague who raved about how delicious this place was. Wanted to try a chicken plate, but then opted for the fried chicken sandwich. Pleasantly surprised that the sandwich was not dry and tasted even better when I had the second half later on that day. I did eat my dessert on the walk back to the office, tried the strawberry shortcake as it's a huge hit. The strawberries were fresh which  was great as I found the desert as a whole to be too sweet for me. 4 stars.After seeing the fried chicken addition on Instagram my colleague and I eagerly brought another coworker to try today. We split a box of 12 and had enough chicken to feed the whole office. The fried chicken is huge and packing with flavor! Wow, definitely was NOT disappointed! This added that last star Made Nice. Also, these little Apple Pie bites are heavenly. It is basically a bite of apple crumple pie with the filling of an apple pie. And luckily not too sweet. Can go for a few more!",,,
9,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,347,521,4.0,1/24/2018,"Made Nice makes some tasty, high-quality dishes. City prices, but the portions are good and the food fresh, inventive and tasty.  I've ordered from here multiple times on Caviar and been quite happy, so I was excited to stop in for a quick meal when in the area recently. While I am morally opposed to no cash establishments, they at least have an efficient system where you order from a server standing outside the counter, who rings you up on an iPad before you pick your food up at the counter. Personal highlights from the menu for me include the curry cauliflower (a stew with coconut/lemongrass flavors) and the cod provençal, served over a lovely chickpea purée with crunchy, flash-fried chickpeas on top--although the cod dish is a bit stingy with the advertised olives.  Dining in gives you the added advantage of being able to try their stellar Milk & Honey ice cream. It's so good, I'm even tempted add it next time I order delivery, but...that probably wouldn't work out so well, would it?Pretty much everything else I've tried is also good, though I would note that I didn't love their soggy, over cooked Brussels sprouts (typically one of my faves), either as a side or in their pork dish.  But you mostly can't go wrong flavor-wise here.",3,1,3
10,Cindy X.,"Manhattan, NY",131,244,448,4.0,4/12/2018,"Very nice. I've tried their chicken rice and beef khao salad before. The salad wasn't worth the value, it left me feeling hungry pretty quickly. The chicken rice was very filling and I absolutely love the crispy chicken skin.The rice was fragrant, and there are lots of juicy chicken chunks, a perfect bite with some crisps. Their garlic roll is also very good. Buttery, garlicky and flaky, yet it tasted very light. The topping on the garlic roll gave it some texture. I think the price is well worth considering they are the same chef as from eleven Madison Park.I wish they served their chicken and frites through the day. Always wanted to try and it's only $22 for 2 people which is a very good value. I guess I'll come at dinner to try.",,,
11,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,4.0,1/18/2018,"I wish I didn't have to spend this much on a salad BUT it is a delicious salad with fresh seeming ingredients. In this day of questionable food sources and tainted food industry practices I'd like to think I'm paying to eat quality and ""sourced"" food here.The good so far are the tofu and cauliflower dish and the kale avocado salad. I'm not a chicken person but that seems popular here as well. It's definitely calmed down since opening act last year and now it's fairly easy to get a meal. There are too many options that have opened up on this block itself. But if you're thinking fast casual and you're tired of digg inn and etc...here you go!",2,1,1
12,Ann M.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,34,0,4.0,10/1/2018,"Did takeout from here on Friday night, after having this on my to-try list for a while. Went with Frisee and Rosti, Pomegranate Tabbouleh (a little sweet for my taste), Curry Cauliflower (my fav), Fried Chicken (yum), Bread, and Broccoli & Kale Slaw. Servers were really friendly and the space was nice, but most importantly the food was good. Not great, but good, and satisfying.  I often feel disappointed by takeout, but this hit the spot perfectly.  I wish more Michelin-starred chefs would create fast-casual concepts for this takeout crazed city.

Updated review","Update:Made Nice tastes good, but the price and portion size compared to the options in the surrounding area make this my last choice of lunch spots. Not to mention the distance from my office and how they consistently make errors when I do order from there.After walking all the way there (only b/c my coworker really wanted to) I ordered the Thai Steak Salad. We walked all the way there & back to the office only to find that they forgot the steak. $16+ was already STEEP for a lunch joint. Now $16 for a small plate of veggies and the additional hassle of calling them?! Won't be going back. Especially on an already stressful work day, where I only had 20 minutes to run and grab something and run to another meeting. Gurl, bye",,,
14,Sung K.,"New York, NY",242,520,0,4.0,6/24/2018,"3.5Had many dishes from here over the past 2 years, but today decided to try the Chicken Frites (weekend special) and the Cold Beef noodles.Chicken frites was absolutely delicious with the same fries that you'd get served at the nomad bar. Dip the chicken into the green hot sauce they provide at the counter, and you'll be set. The stuffing in the chicken was great, even though I would have preferred to taste less of the butter. Cold Beef noodles were not my favorite, as the kelp noodles had similar texture as jellyfish, but with less chew. Seasoning was great, but all in all, not sure if this was worth it for $14.It's a great, relatively healthy option if you're in the area for a quick meal. Will be back",1,,1

Updated review","Oh I'm so sad. This place is not nearly as good as it was when it first opened. Now it's like pick a base, then add a protein so we can charge you more. Not a lot of variety. The steak salad, cod provencal, the pork were so good. I don't know why they took them off the menu. Also, we had 2 entrees and 2 waters and it was $45. WTF?!?",,,
16,Sarah R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,9,1,5.0,10/26/2018,Best fast casual food in the city. Everything I've tried has been delicious. Not only is the food fantastic but the place itself is clean and pleasant and the staff is beyond nice and welcoming. A serious step up from dig inn across the street. I look forward to the days when I work in the area so I can pick up dinner here.,1,,1
17,Kathleen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,233,415,5.0,11/9/2017,"The hype of this flavor is deserved! I loved the items I ordered this past week and definitely planning on trying other dishes. Curry cauliflower ($11): This vegetarian option with cauliflower, tofu, couscous, coconut, almonds, and grapes is fabulous. It is flavorful, richly spiced, and very filling. A hearty portion. Cod provencal ($15): The seared cod was wonderful (a bit cold from delivery, but still tender). I loved the crispy chickpeas for extra texture, juxtaposed against the smoothness of the chickpea puree. I wish there was more fennel for more sweetness to balance the saltiness of the cod and puree. Salmon rosti ($15): Yum! Generous portion of smoked salmon with scrumptious, crispy potato croutons, deviled eggs and capers. Lighter than the cod with such a splendid mixture of ingredients. Pumpkin bite ($2): This truly is bite-sized, and very, very sweet. It's got a smooth puree-like filling in the middle. A few nibbles were enough for me.",6,2,4
18,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",12,229,363,5.0,6/24/2018,"This is my favorite fast casual place I've been to in the city!  The salads and sandwiches seemed a bit more inventive than most of the salad/ lunch places around here & the people here are actually extremely nice-- something I haven't found really anywhere else haha.  I ordered the Pomegranate & Tabbouleh salad with grilled chicken added.  This salad was not like a traditional tabbouleh salad like I expected, but I was very satisfied with what I got.  It really is more of a salad, heavier on the greens than tabbouleh (usually it's the other way around) & I really liked this.  The tabbouleh itself also seemed like maybe they sprinkled it in the salad uncooked so it provided a bit of a crunch.  It mixed really well with the pomegranate & pistachios-- an overall awesome combination.   I highly recommend getting a little container of the green hot sauce they have by the water counter.  I dipped my chicken in it & it was so delicious-- kinda tastes a little like pineapple, mint, and basil all mixed up.  I would eat this sauce on anything.The people working the cash register were super friendly & helpful in explaining the menu.  They were even nice enough to give me a complimentary little dessert treat they have sitting by the checkout.  Make sure you purchase one of these!  I got the strawberry rhubarb bite, and I'm not sure exactly what it's supposed to be, but it was kind of like a snickerdoodle texture with a pie-like jam filling.  This was such a tasty little treat to end the meal, I'd honestly go back to this place just to get these desserts if I'm only int he mood for something sweet.And lastly, even the people in the back of the kitchen looked like they were enjoying their job-- everyone was laughing together, happy, friendly, and overall just looked like they didn't mind being there.  I know this seems like an unimportant detail, but most places around here are filled with angry curmudgeons who look like they'd rather be anywhere else in the world than the restaurant, so it was nice to be in an establishment that differs from the norm in that sense.Overall awesome place & I can't wait to come back again soon!",,,
19,Mari M.,"New York, NY",182,58,375,5.0,11/12/2017,"I came here after hearing about the soft serve. A place called Made Nice lived up to its name with a very nice experience. The customer service was fantastic, very friendly. They offered to make my salad first and have me request the soft serve after so it wouldn't melt.

20,Adriana K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",118,109,166,4.0,10/24/2017,"A fancier version of dig inn. Seems like they always have a solid 2 vegan options on the menu. The curry cauliflower and then another rotating dish (this time it was kale and quinoa). I got the cauliflower and it was good, the flavors bold, but I was almost tired of the intense lemon dressing by the end. The dish itself almost seemed more Mediterranean inspired as it came with cous cous, raisins and pine nuts. Definitely a big enough portion for a filling lunch or dinner. Pretty much everyone there was eating the chicken meal set which came with fries, so I caved and got a side order of fries ($6). The box was HUGE. Well seasoned and thinly cut, super crispy and worth the calories.",5,2,2
21,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,8900,4.0,10/11/2017,"Since selling a kidney is probably the only way I'd be able to afford lunch at Eleven Madison Park, I'm stuck with Made Nice. But I'm not mad about it.Over the past few months, I've been lucky enough to try the Pork & Corn, the Khao Salad, and the Chicken Rice. Each dish is served quickly, thoughtfully composed, texturally interesting, and pretty tasty. (I find that just about everything benefits from the green hot sauce available by request, but you can make that call on your own.)When it comes to extras, my colleagues are into the sparkling sodas (tap water is fine by me), curry cauliflower is a winner on the side, the tiny muffins are adorable but not much to e-mail home about, and the Milk & Honey Soft Serve is the best thing in the entire shop. There have been slight hiccups over a few visits like under-seasoned chicken and over-seasoned steak, but generally speaking, it's a good choice for lunch, if a tiny bit pricier than the comparable fast-casual spots in the area. My motto used to be ""Make It Hot"" because that's what Biggie told me to do, but ""Make It Nice"" works just as well.",13,11,13
22,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1481,4351,3.0,12/9/2017,"Torn here because I loved the hot apple cider, fries and ice cream. Didn't love the chicken and seasonal squash side. The chicken had way too many spices and it felt like overkill. The squash was served cold which is not what I want this time of year. I'd return for the first three items mentioned, because they were all fantastic. 3.5 stars.Edit 8/2018: Had a better experience the second time around. The curry cauliflower was quite good and chicken sandwich was decent. The ice cream is still the best thing about this place - try both flavors!",1,,

Yet somehow Made Nice still stands out above the rest as a superior fast-casual option.  Hailing from the Make it Nice restaurant group, it offers (much) better-than-average salads and hot food which keep me coming back regularly for more. Recommended favorites are the salmon rosti salad and chicken rice.   The milk & honey soft serve is also not to be missed and a wonderful take on their classic milk & honey dessert from The NoMad.",3,1,2

After a full weekend of drinking I wanted to ""detox"" with a salad and with limited options (I won't name all the chains here) my friend and I stumbled upon Made Nice! Apparently we were made aware that this is the ""affordable"" version of a fancier NYC restaurant (11 madison park). I got the carrot ginger salad which came with Baby Gem, Carrots, Cashews, Red Onion, Crispy Wontons & Sesame Vinaigrette! For an extra $3-4 you can get a protein as well.

I have ordered delivery from here maybe 10X so I hate to leave a review like this - but I really don't want you guys to get Salmonella. My Chicken and Frites came totally raw. I'm so disgusted.I'm bummed because this is certainly not of the standard of 11 Madison Park food. It's not even of the standard of a bodega down the street, or a KFC.

27,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,4.0,8/31/2017,"Definitely enjoyed this place for both a salad and their chicken + friites dish.WAIT: Came on a Friday night and it was semi-crowded but we were still able to find a table.  I also came on a Wednesday night around 7pm and there was still a lot of people but I didn't have trouble finding a table. ATMOSPHERE: You enter on the left hand side and order first, then sit down or wait for your food on the right hand side.  They call your name so if you're sitting in the further back you might not hear your name being called.  It's pretty nice inside for a fast casual, with typical wooden tables and chairs.  It has a high ceiling, open kitchen where you can see them preparing the food and the sound is lively.FOOD:  They have lots to choose from! The prices do seem a little on the higher end (up to $15 for one dish) but I think it's because of the ""healthy"" aspect to it.  They also have other healthy snacks and soft serve available.CHICKEN FRITES - for $22, this could feed 2 people so at $11 per person it's a pretty good deal.  Sure you don't feel super stuffed afterwards, but you are satisfied.  It comes with a Roasted Half Chicken with Lemon-Parmesan Stuffing, Herb Frites & Pickled Vegetable Salad.  The chicken is very tasty, the lemon parmesan isn't overwhelming or too salty and it even makes the white meat taste good.  The herb frites are basically rosemary thin fries, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The pickled veggie salad is a good tart and refreshing side.  I liked that they served it on a slate with no plates etc. so it's good for photos.SUMMER CHICKEN - Romaine Salad, Roasted Chicken, Zucchini, Squash, Corn, Tomato, Parmesan, Chickpeas & Red Pepper Vinaigrette.  I asked for no tomato and she said they couldn't do it without - which makes me think it's pre-made, but I guess that helps them to be quick.  The salad is very tasty, the chicken is almost like the breast meat from a roast chicken that is shredded.  It was tasty.  The vinaigrette is tangy but not too vinegar-y and not drenching the salad.  I liked all the ingredients (not much corn) and they had both regular chickpeas and fried/roasted ones? That gave a nice crunch! The parmesan was pretty much non-existant.  For a person avoiding carbs, this was a good choice.Overall, I liked this place and would come back to try their other dishes.  The serving sizes are fairly generous so you feel satisfied afterwards.",4,1,3

I ordered the Avocado salad and Milk & Honey soft serve to go and brought it back to my hotel room. The soft serve was covered in yummy brittle, oats, and honey drizzle, but the soft serve itself was nothing to write home about. I expected a more creamy consistency but it was a little on the icy side. The soft serve was sweet and with the added extra sweet toppings, I had to stop about a third in.The salad, too, was nothing special -- I liked the pickled veggies on top and the grilled avocado, but the kale made it really dry and the salad was missing oomph. Perhaps it's because I ordered it to-go with the dressing on the side, but even after I tossed the dressing into the salad, I was craving something more. Regardless, ordering a salad to-go should not compromise flavor.",1,,

31,Dia Q.,"New York, NY",123,99,201,4.0,8/8/2018,"I was very reluctant to try this place since I had a really bad experience at Eleven Madison Park a few years ago. Unlike the disingenuous service at EMP and NoMad, all the people here are so welcoming and friendly. Everyone here is nice. During the lunch rush, they put directional signs and ropes to make sure things go efficiently. After, they take these down and the place feels more open. They did a great job with the decor: it's obviously a casual spot but it has the touches of a fine dining establishment. That becomes obvious by the kitchen, which is my favorite part of the place. The food is really well curated and sense the value. I had the Short rib kelp salad and it was ok. Short rib was more like uncured pastrami, not bad, just not what I was expecting. They cut it in cubes so it looks perfect. I prefer short ribs cooked down properly but that doesn't look as pretty so I understand why they do this. The salad was overall too acidic. (Like that fairytale eggplant with bland ""Dahl"" I had at EMP) I saw someone with the couscous plate and it looked delicious so I came back to get it. It was tasty. Second time, I saw someone with the chicken and rice; I want to try that too. It's the kind of place you will want to go back to.",,,

We may or may not have cut other parties that had been waiting more respectfully for a table. Sorrynotsorry. The Chicken & Frites is only available for dinner. It comes with a mountain of delicious fries that can easily be shared amongst 4 people. My friend and I barely made a dent. The chicken was so ridiculously moist and comes with a layer of lemon parmesan stuffing. I am on a mission to try every thing on the menu. I would come here just to get that amazing soft serve.  [CARD ONLY]",2,1,2

From my visits so far, I tried the chicken frites (highly recommend for the sauce that comes with it), the Salmon Rosti salad (fresh & delicious), the Pork & Brussels (amazing, especially if you are a fan of brussels), and of course, the remarkable milk and honey soft serve (a must-try!) that comes with a cute, creative 'I'm ready for soft serve' card when you order it with food. After you are done eating, you just need to bring the card up to the counter and you'll get your soft serve almost immediately. The place (including the kitchen) is very clean but is always full, so it might be difficult to find seats at busy times. The food, however, comes out unusually fast so the tables open up pretty quickly. Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!",,,
35,Genevieve C.,"New York, NY",603,48,249,4.0,10/17/2017,Solid fast casual. Not really what I would consider super healthy though (maybe it was just the dishes I ordered? But there was fried chicken skin on both the soup and the dish which was amazing but definitely not the healthiest)2. Chicken veloute soup with fried chicken skin - Really really flavorful. Only reason I might not get it again is that it was pretty salty 2. Chicken rice - good especially with the chicken skin. Just don't know if it was mind blowing especially for the price of something fast casual but would get again / really solid Overall liked this place and would be open to trying other dishes,,,

While their staff is great, my salad came out and most of the lettuce was pink on the edges and clearly not fresh. Also my extra protein of a hard boiled egg had a piece of shell on it. One without the other would have been fine but the lettuce really was a letdown. The gigantic house made tater tots were best part of the meal but I will think twice about seeking out this place for lunch in the future.",2,,
37,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,7/7/2017,"My coworkers and I aren't quite at the level of an Eleven Madison Park work lunch yet, so we were excited to hear about Made Nice, a fast casual concept by the same restauranteurs. While I enjoyed the food for the most part (details below), I did walk away thinking it was still a bit pricey for an everyday quick lunch. The good: first of all, the service. Everyone was so nice, from the greeter to the cash register operator, and everyone was happy to give their recommendations to a bunch of newcomers. As for the food, I really liked the Khao salad, with steak, crispy rice, broccoli, and crispy shallot among other ingredients (hence not quite a salad but hey I'll take it). The standout for me was the milk and honey soft serve. My lunch companions shied away from getting dessert after lunch (understandable), but once they had a bite of mine they regretted it immensely. The not-so-good: I was less than impressed with the chicken and rice. The whole thing was a bit dry to me, from the chicken to the rice. I guess when it comes to this kind of dish I'd rather go to the nearest halal cart and pay less than the $15 I paid here for this dish. The entrees mostly being $12-$15, I guess for me it's a better option for an affordable dinner vs. an expensive lunch, but in any case, I was impressed that the EMP peeps managed to bring their gourmet sensibilities to the masses successfully and relatively affordably!",12,6,10

That extra bit of scallions really made a big difference. Will definitely order again!Tuna nicoise is very delicious too. Love that boiled egg with a bit of creamy yolk. Will also order again!Cod Provençal - The fish is self is great. It's a bit dry on the outside, but inside is very moist. However the rest of the dish has some weird taste, at least for me. I guess everybody's tastebud is different. I tasted salt and something sour from it. I'm not really a fan of. Won't order this again. Was going to order it online but they are not on seamless. However, you can still order online if you create an account Trycaviar website. I just don't want to deal with additional account, so I went to the store to order and pick it up from there. The people work there are very friendly. Not too much of a wait.They have about 15 items on their menu only. And each dish made looks small in portion, but once you finish you actually feel pretty full from that. And I really think their menu is healthy. I mean The ingredient on each dish is healthy.",,,

Updated review","I really don't like the winter menu, because there's only one thing I can order from here: Curry Cauliflower, and it's not good. Like Allie K. said, it desperately needs greens. Also I never liked nuts or fruits with savory food, so when I ordered last time, I asked to remove almonds and grapes. However my food came with raisins, yes, they are not called ""grapes"", but...",,1,1
40,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,582,505,5.0,7/13/2017,"I was so impressed by Made Nice. The fast casual concept by the Eleven Madison Park team has a diverse menu of gourmet grown-up plates, perfect for a weeknight dinner. I stopped by around 6pm on a Wednesday, and there was no line and seating available. Side note - I loved the fabric on the chairs. Everybody is doing stripped down, bare wood, no cushions, so it felt really refreshing and current to see Made Nice have a different (and comfortable, and attractive) point of view in terms of decor.I ordered the ""pork and corn"", which was a slab of slow cooked pork belly atop a bed of charred corn, wheat berries, greens, and mushrooms. The flavors were so fantastic, and the pork tasted like it had come from a high end kitchen. It was very nutritionally balanced, though I don't think this was super low cal; it was too tasty to be healthy. At $14 for most plates, it's a nice change from similarly priced Sweetgreen.I will definitely come back for the roasted chicken frites for two, which looked incredible.",3,,1
41,Hui C.,"Manhattan, NY",326,267,121,4.0,8/20/2017,"TL;DR: restaurant quality dishes that cost about 40-50% more than your typical fast casual spot (think Sweetgreen, Roast). It's so good, but unclear where its niche is (too pricy for everyday lunch, but too casual to feel like a sit down).I order here for my team and also have dropped by to try out dishes to see if they lived up to the hype. They do. My team has raved that this is the ""best lunch they've had"", and favorites include the spring chicken, salmon rösti, curry cauliflower (my fave), pork and of course, the soft serve. The cod was voted too soupy and a little tart. The fact that each of these cost around ~$15 was surprising in multiple ways to my team; first, that such high quality food could be produced and sold for only $15 (as my manager noted, ""They can't be making money on that"") but also it would be very hard to scale both the quality and price point to the average lunch crowd. Made Nice is a great treat when you can afford it. The outstanding question here isn't that it isn't great food, but rather, how accessible will this great food be.",1,,

It is a fast line but not fast enough to keep up with the lack of seating to accommodate the rush.Gripes:- not enough seating - not the restaurants fault - there is plenty of space and the line moves fast - its the rush of people wanting to eat.- definitely a little pricey for a lunch meal but you're paying for the name, quality, and meal - and its worth it.",1,1,1
44,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,5.0,7/26/2017,"This place should be called Made Super Nice. After having this in my radar since it opened (lots of press given the connection with high end Michelin star EMP), finally made it for weekday dinner. The options in the menu they all look healthy, yet delicious.Obviously we went for the least healthy: the half chicken with fries and salad ($22). The chicken is moisty, with a layer of stuffing between the meat and the skin that is OMG amazing! I could eat that stuffing by itself. This was healthyish, but the mountain of fries (which are addicting, I think it was the parsley) was the guilty pleasure. Tiny bowl of salad didn't make healthier. Wished there was a bigger side of salad vs so many fries. Also got the broccoli with fried rice side ($6), which was delish (more broccoli than fried rice). We ate this between 2 people, but saw some people eating the chicken with fires by themselves too.Service was super quick. Probably waited ~5 min for the chicken or so.Will be back to try other stuff, and maybe even their wine!",1,,
45,Angela G.,"Elmhurst, NY",2,57,4,3.0,9/28/2018,"I'm currently sitting in Made Nice trying to finish my Milk & Honey soft serve. This is my second visit here and I'm not sure what the hype is. Many people are writing how they wish they had more of the crunchy bits on their soft serve but here I am wishing I had less. This is way too sugary (and salty at the same time) and in my opinion, needs to be shared.On my first visit I had the kelp noodle salad and while it was okay, it wasn't spectacular. The citrus dressing suited my tastes and kelp noodles were suitably crunchy.Those little bite-size cakes (I've had the chocolate peanut butter and pumpkin pecan) were good but not great. I must've expected too much from this place...Service, on the other hand, was spectacular!",,,

However, I think that may have a bit more work to do on the dining experience. While my friend had her meal delivered to her, the server weirdly refused to bring me my meal. It would be great to establish a consistent level of service for all patrons! It was difficult to decide what to get, but I settled on the smoked salmon salad, which came with a great creamy dressing, cold potato tater-tot-like croutons, and perfectly soft boiled egg. I would highly recommend it as a lighter option with great flavor combinations. My friend got the chicken and rice, which was phenomenal. You can't think of the Halal guys when you eat this upscale version. The chicken was perfectly marinated and topped with scallions and tomatoes on seasoned rice. Overall, was a great experience and I'm looking forward to trying more plates next time! Everything comes out beautifully and instagram-friendly for all those who care about that sort of thing.",,,
47,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,4.0,5/26/2017,"Made Nice is nice.  Before trying it, I was expecting it to be a pretty decent healthy option, but now that I've had it, I think it's too good to actually be healthy.We tried the Salmon Rosti, Khao Salad, and Pork n' Carrots.  I tried really hard to think about which I liked the best, but they're all sufficiently different and all good; I'd happily order any of those again.  Note I didn't  even have these fresh; I ordered these to go in the afternoon and had them later for dinner.Salmon rosti -- the rosti was really well done with a light crisp.  Soft boiled eggs are also always a plus.  The salad and dressing tasted light, which was a good balance to the saltiness of the smoked salmon.Khao salad -- the beef was decently tender, and I really liked the slightly charred broccoli and the crunchiness of the broccoli and rice.  The parmesan added a nice creaminess to bring it all together.Pork n' carrots -- the pork confit was also pretty tender and flavorful, but I was surprised on the upside by how sweet the roasted carrots were.  When I took my first bite, I could've sworn I was eating a plantain, but that's not an ingredient according to the menu.  I bet it's a trick.I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu.",2,1,2

49,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",774,173,56,4.0,6/6/2017,"For a fast casual place, Made Nice really some really interesting flavors! Came here at ~630pm on a Tuesday, and actually was ahead of the dinner rush (which was ~7pm). The line moved quickly, and two friendly people with iPads took our orders. I opted for the Salmon Rosti while my friend got the Spring Chicken, and we shared the Milk & Honey soft serve afterward.Certainly quite pricey for a normal fast casual place, and I would say that the flavors aren't something I would necessarily crave, as they're a bit more unique, but it was a delicious and clearly very fresh meal! My Salmon Rosti was a light frise with a pretty strong dill flavor that complemented the smoked salmon well. I would say that if you don't like dill though, this is likely not the dish for you.I had a bite of my friend's Spring Chicken, and it was much milder. Chicken was tender, and I particularly liked the snap peas, as they added a nice sweet crunch. The milk & honey soft serve is a MUST have. Although $6, the container is quite large and had enough for the two of us to comfortably share. Soft serve itself is suuuper creamy, but the best part was the chunks of honeycomb (?) that were sprinkled throughout the ice cream! They added an awesome sweet crunch / chew that I loved. I'd certainly come back to try more of the menu, but it's a bit too expensive to be a daily go-to in my opinion.",2,,

I got there at 12:30 PM and according to the number on the bag I received once I got inside at 1 PM, I was the 16th person on line. I was out in three minutes, and it probably would've only taken one minute if the excited customers in front of me weren't all taking selfies with Daniel Humm.I chose the Quinoa Falafel Bowl, which was delicious, and predictably much higher quality than any other fast casual place.

The discussion is pointless at least for now since EMP is closing, but newer projects such as Made Nice and whatever it is in the Hamptons that they're going to do continue to excite us. To me, Daniel Humm is a literal god who makes the best duck at EMP, the best strawberry dessert at the Nomad Restaurant, and the best burger at the Nomad Bar. Are the dishes at Made Nice in line with those establishments? Absolutely not, at least in my opinion. But I must applaud Chef Humm for bringing fine food to a casual concept. Made Nice is just fucking genius in that regard.The line moves fast and the space is extremely organized. It is open kitchen, but you don't awkwardly watch your food being made and secretly hope that the salad maker could be less skimpy on the portion size. Plates come out beautiful, even out of the takeout bag after a 8-block walk. This is not some local or #healthho quick casual spot, although the food might as well be local and healthy. But based on my personal experience, 6 hours after a sugar-laden Dr. Greens soda and a decadent Khao Salad, I am still not hungry but have been extremely thirsty due to high sodium. No regret though.

52,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",163,161,1238,4.0,5/24/2017,"We decided to order the chicken frites (only available after 5PM) to share as we weren't that hungry. The order was pretty large as it came with a load of skinny fries and a side salad. The chicken was tender and juicy. There was a layer of breading between the meat and the skin, which I thought was a bit overwhelming and unnecessary. The stuffing was too greasy (too much parmesan for my liking), but I did appreciate the lemony and rosemary touch. I really enjoyed the fries as they were seasoned with a lot of herb! I think the portion of this plate is a bit too much for 1 person, but probably good to share amongst 2 people and a dessert afterwards to share.Service: They had a glitch in their system and didn't receive our order. We waited for over 20 minutes wondering why our chicken frites was taking so long. After asking about our order, the staff were all really apologetic and offered us drinks to make up for the wait. Although we weren't thirsty, we were appreciative of their sincere apologies.

Elements I liked: the chicken (cooked well, seasoned well), almond slivers and sunflower seeds (add that great crunchy texture I always look for in a salad), and snap peas (gives the salad a super fresh spring flavor). What I didn't like: lettuce (boring, tasteless), asparagus (not nearly enough to make a noticeable contribution to the overall flavor of the dish), and the lemon vinaigrette dressing was a tad too acidic. The milk & honey soft serve came highly recommended but I found it too sweet. The fast-casual concept here means that this place is perfect for lunch if you happen to work in the area, but alas, most of us are not so lucky.

Instead, I was chugging glasses of water. If you order the Chicken Rice, I'd recommend telling them to go easy on salt.",1,,

I order the chicken rice & cranberry fizzy drink tonight on caviar (ayyy free delivery!) - and I was instantly addicted. The ingredients are super fresh and it's a good value for what you get. The chicken rice is well composed and I appreciated the addition of crispy skin - everything was super juicy. I also added their make it hot sauce which added a perfect intensity. Overall 10/10 - I'm excited to go in and try their soft serve!",2,1,2
65,Justina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,91,21,4.0,8/29/2018,"Delicious food but a little bit on the pricey side. I've had them twice -- once was at work, as a catered employee lunch, so got to try pretty much the whole menu. It was all fresh, savory, delicious food that was a hit for the office. Today, I was running out to grab food and asked our Office Manager where she had ordered the food from for that lunch. It was Made Nice, so decided to head over there to grab and go.The inside is very open and spacious -- a big open kitchen where you can see everything going on back there. Very modern and great decor. There is no traditional cashier; instead, you wait on line and order with an employee on an iPad, where she also takes your card. Then you wait for your name to be called and you're good to go. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and, no surprise, it was delicious. A little too pricey for me to make this a regular lunch spot, though, as I can't really justify paying $13 and change for a sandwich. It will definitely be a place to treat myself to every now and then, though!",,,
66,Allie K.,"Los Altos, CA",1,86,24,3.0,3/8/2018,"Maddeningly disappointing. Disclaimer : I frequent Nomad the restaurant, so I'm well accustomed to overpaying for food. That being said, have you ever thought ""I fancy eating a whole avocado for lunch"" or ""I'm so glad this curry bowl's only vegetable is cauliflower"" then this is for you!  14 bucks for a salad container ZERO legumes or plant based protein. Thanks for the whole avocado but that's so much fat and so little actual nutrition. I'm dumbfounded. Just put some lentils which would go perfectly. Come on. And for the one note curry bowl. Putting grapes on does not do enough to balance it. It desperately needs kale or any leafy green to round out the nutritional / taste profile. I get that dishes at nomad aren't well rounded, that I paid 40 bucks for 3 over butter seared scallops and braised look a like daikon, but this is lunchtime people.

68,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,4.0,7/25/2017,"Made Nice is great for those who want fast casual food, but in reality, it's high end, totally instagramable, good food served in a casual setting. For its caliber, it's actually affordable too - I'm sure they could have charged more for every item on their menu. All their salads aren't plain Jane. As a non salad eater, I actually was intrigued by a couple of them (the khao especially), but given it was dinner, the unhealthy in me opted for chicken frites. I had read reviews and saw pictures on how the chicken frites feeds two, but for some reason when my dish arrived, I was still flabbergasted at the monstrosity of its size. Not only do you get half a chicken, you get a MOUNTAIN of fries, and a side salad. I actually didn't have a favorite component for this dish as I loved everything. The chicken was super super juicy - each bite wasn't dry and had juice dripping (definitely eat this with someone you're comfortable with). What was best though was the stuffing - I could eat a bowl of this stuffing. The fries were perfectly salted. Most surprising was the salad - it was so refreshing and enjoyable. Every ingredient was fresh, especially the grilled corn. I love summer corn. I told myself I couldn't / won't finish the entire plate of food, but everything was so good / I didn't want to look like a freak asking them to wrap up a piece of chicken, so what did I do? I devoured it. Unfortunately, this left me overly stuffed that I wasn't able to try their acclaimed dessert... But hey, that means I'll be back!We went on a Tuesday night at 7 pm and this place was completely full. It wasn't outrageously packed where people were hawking and fighting for seats, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was that way later on in the week. Do stop by dinner and order / share the chicken!",5,3,5
69,Henry M.,"New York, NY",128,419,951,2.0,9/29/2017,"This is a very difficult review to write because I cannot believe how disappointing the meal was here.  I love Eleven Madison Park and am a big fan of Chef Daniel Humm and his partner, Will Guidara.  Since they are the creative minds behind this new upscale casual concept, I was expecting to love it.  Unfortunately, I was let down.I got the ""Chicken Rice"" as my entree.  It was beautiful to look at, but completely lacking in flavor.  This is Made Nice's interpretation of a chicken and rice plate from a Halal cart.  The chicken was sort of a strange texture with some pieces being tender and other pieces more dry.  By itself, the chicken was flavorless.  The rice was nicely cooked, but also lacking in any flavor.  There were a few pieces of fried chicken skin, which gave the dish some richness and provided a nice texture contrast as well as providing some flavor to the dish.  There were some cherry tomatoes and some scallions on the plate for color and some brightness in flavor.  Overall, it was a miss.  They failed to capture what makes the chicken and rice plates from the carts so satisfying.  At $14, this cost double what the Halal carts charge and provided around half the amount of food as the carts.  I could not help comparing this to the Halal carts with each bite and the carts win every time.I ordered the milk and honey soft serve dessert.  They originally forgot to give me my ""I'm ready for soft serve"" card, so I had to go back to ask for it.  The dessert was good, but the portion was too large and it quickly became too sweet to continue.  It was the size of a self-serve froyo container heaping full of soft serve.  It needed some savory elements to balance it out.  They should cut the price from $6 to $4 and give less than half the portion.For a drink, I got the house-made ""Cran Fizz"" soda.  It was a cranberry ginger soda recommended by the cashier and was very good.  It was probably the best part of the meal.  It was nice and tart with just the right amount of carbonation.In all, I ended up spending around $26 and left completely disappointed.  Perhaps I would have had a better experience had I ordered the chicken frites.After this, I'll stick to EMP and Nomad.",,1,
70,Tom C.,"New York, NY",133,247,361,4.0,10/6/2017,"Fast casual from the guys behind EMP. There are influences but don't expect the same caliber here. It's a quick quality meal with little to no wait and relatively affordable. Order at the counter, grab a seat and come back to pick up your meal when your name is called. The chicken frites, available on weeknights and all day Saturday is tender and juicy, is large enough for sharing. The curry cauliflower is a must try, as is their house made sodas (melon thyme!) and their honey milk soft serve.",,,
71,Joshua B.,"Old Westbury, NY",197,174,208,5.0,8/13/2017,Made Nice was catering the food for an event that I went to a couple of days ago and I must say that I was beyond impressed with the quality of their food. I had the pleasure of having 4 different things off the menu and I will speak about them all briefly.I was stuffed by the time the summer chicken came around so I only had a tiny piece of chicken which was good. That wouldn't be a dish that I typically order so I wasn't disappointed to only have a little tiny bit of it.They were passing around the salmon rosti  but I didn't try that. My wife had some and she said she really enjoyed it. This wouldn't be a dish that I typically order so I opted not to try it. Looking back maybe I should've given it to go because everything that I tried from them was so good.I only had a bite of the curried cauliflower. It was really good.I had a bunch of the chicken rice dish. This was also really good. There is nothing that made it phenomenal or anything but it was another solid dish. The pork and corn dish was literally out of this world. I have had the privilege of eating and trying many different dishes from many different places and this was in the top handful of dishes I've ever had. Of course this has lot to do with my personal opinion and taste but damn this was good.It was truly a pleasure to have an opportunity to sample so many different dishes from this place. I was impressed and would 100% go out of my way to have that pork and corn dish again.,1,1,1
72,Melissa L.,"San Francisco, CA",158,598,88,5.0,7/29/2017,"I am a fan of the other restaurants in this restaurant family but sometimes, I just want something more casual, but still with the level of quality and attention to detail displayed at Eleven Madison and The NoMad.  Mad Nice has a variety of meal-sized salads and dishes with soups, soft serve, granola and a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  When I walked in a staff member approached me immediately to assist me with my order.  Since this was my first visit I asked for a recommendation.  I had been leaning towards the chicken rice dish or even in the tuna Nicoise salad and he told me that the curry cauliflower and Khao salad were popular.  I reassessed my choices and decided to go with the Khao salad.  The food was ready rather quickly and looked great.  What really surprised me was the size of the dish!  Perhaps I'm jaded because I've had one too made pricey meals that left me hungry (but....it looked so pretty!  the ingredients were foraged within a 2 mile radius!) but what was presented to me gave me hope that this would be a great meal.  The dish consists of seared steak, roasted broccoli, cilantro, crispy rice, lime, chili and crispy shallots.  The beef was so tender and the vegetables were so fresh.  I love a well composed salad and this one had such a variety of textures and flavors (sour, spicy, salty, bitter), all perfectly balanced.  I loved this dish!The restaurant is fast casual where patrons place their order at the counter.  Seating is plentiful and spacious.  The menu is limited but the options are healthy and varied.  This is NOT your typical salad place with a dish composed of 2/3 lettuce, 1/3 protein and 1/3 fatty/starchy fillers.  These dishes contain high quality ingredients where a lot of thought was put into their composition.  I cannot wait to try other dishes on the menu, if I don't order the Khao salad every time.",2,,2
73,Louisa Y.,"Manhattan, NY",61,36,34,4.0,11/2/2017,"Loved the salads and fast casual concept here!!!Went for dinner during a weekday around 7pm. It was pretty full, so my friend snagged a table while I placed our orders. Food was prepared quickly.We tried the Tuna Niçoise and the Salmon Rösti. Both were very filling, tasty, had great dressings and a good portion of fish. Only wish the potato crouton in the Salmon Rösti salad was served hot instead of cold.I have also tried the Milk & Honey soft serve during a prior visit. The milk ice cream was a little too salty for me (but maybe the perfect balance for someone who enjoys less sweet desserts). But I really liked the honey brittle topping and that satisfied my sweet tooth !",,,
74,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,4.0,1/21/2018,"I'd heard about Made Nice opening, but even though it's close by, I did not make it until yesterday for lunch. It's easy to miss, given it's right next to the NoMad Bar entrance, but once inside, it feels quite spacious - high ceilings and an open-air kitchen with copper pots hanging that make you feel like you are in for more than your average fast-casual dining experience. The wall on the right above the seating area is adorned with various NYC-inspired backdrops and slogans...makes it feel a little hip (or makes me feel a little old, perhaps). On the left, it's simple - all the menu items listed out and explained, as well as a brief list of soups, drinks, and other small bites. We were greeted by someone who took our order on a tablet, making it feel a much nicer experience than lining up and waiting. The food is served on what feels like a slab of slate as a tray (although lighter), and the salads are served in what seem like deceptively small bowls - they aren't deep, but the circumference of the plate more than makes up for it. A salad at $15 or so does feel pricey, but given how filling it was, I felt I got my money's worth from a quantity standpoint. I also enjoyed the quality, too; I went with the smoked salmon salad, and while it isn't world-beating, I enjoyed the flavor of the fish, and I did enjoy the soft-boiled eggs that were served with it, giving it a bit more depth. I also enjoyed the buttermilk vinaigrette, which seemed a bit like ranch dressing but was less dense. My wife's tuna salad was pretty good as well; I enjoyed the white beans that gave it a bit of an earthier flavor, and the seared slices of tuna were pretty good as well. We shared a chicken veloute with crispy skin, and I enjoyed the flavor - it is a very rich chicken-based broth, and I liked the skin giving it a bit of texture. That said, it was definitely a bit saltier than I would have preferred.In all, Made Nice is a solid addition to the fast-casual scene that is burgeoning in the NoMad neighborhood, and I do plan on swinging by and checking out some of the other items in the future.",2,1,1

We went for a quick dinner last night and got the Curry Cauliflower, Chicken Rice, Bahn Mi, french friends, and apple and pecan salad with chicken. Made nice has a sweetgreen vibe without the craziness (but we came for dinner so maybe it is really busy for lunch). A very simple menu, big open space, open kitchen, and no cashier (just a guy taking orders near the counter) - it all felt very clean and was a welcome change from the busyness of the buffet line style ordering that we have grown accustom to post Chipotle. The prices were on the same par as Dig Inn / Cava / Latin Beets (for comparable fast casual) however i think you get a little less food for your money at Made Nice. The dishes are complex though with nice touches like big raisins in the curry cauliflower and crunchy toppers on the chicken rice. Overall I think all of the flavors were tasty however we would have liked a bit more spice and a lot warmer dishes. While not cold it did almost feel like delivery temperature in the store. The best dish was the chicken rice, especially with the hot sauce. The bahn mi was disappointing as it didn't taste at all like bahn mi and wasn't spicy or flavorful or full of vegetables like a more traditional vietnamese sandwich.next time we go we will try the desserts as I hear the soft serve is incredible!",,,

78,Dina M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,97,20,3.0,7/27/2018,"I really wanted to love this spot, especially having tried it a few months back when they first opened. It seems they have lowered prices, paired down the menu, and maintained their hip brand. I got the Kale and Avocado salad $10, and a Milk and Honey soft serve $6. Both LOOKED amazing, but sadly, I threw them both out after a few bites. The ice cream was sickeningly sweet with extra sweet toppings. Not for me. The salad, which had been better last time I tried, was flavourless and had these disgusting pickled apples in them. Maybe if I had gotten the fried chicken or some heartier options they would have been better, which is why I am giving them a chance at 3 stars. Also appreciated that salad without protein was $10. Tender Greens on 20th street is far and away better than this place. Prob wont give it a 3rd chance.",,,

The service is fast and friendly!My favorite things on the menu are the Chicken Rice and the Chicken Frites. I don't know how they make their chicken but it is some of the best! I've taken many friends there and have tasted a few different items on the menu (all good). I don't think you can go wrong when ordering there. They have some healthy items and some more filling options so everyone can get what they want. They keep some staples on the menu all year around but change a few to keep it season.

Maybe I'm just not cut out to eat salad, but I wouldn't come back. The salads are spread out on a plate to make them look but, but in the end it's really not that much food.

I haven't had that yet but I have come twice in one week to try: - Cod Provençal - so so yummy, perfect cooked flavorful cod with some kind of pesto (?), Chickpea puree and fennel. It's amazing to have such a meal with care for $15.  The crispy chickpeas are the best part of this dish - great texture play. Very filling :)-Chicken rice -  again yummy pieces of crispy chicken skin, olives, tomato and juicy and tender dark chicken breast make for an a+ chicken type biriyani type thing. Great flavor. This I had an hour After pick up and it was still tasty - I brought the pork and carrots for my husband - he had it an hour later and considering it's braised pork shoulder (I think) this held just fine. Really good frisée and artisanal carrots. -also tried the delicious garlic rolls which are like parmesan-crusted garlic knots.and only $2!- and finally had the Milk and Honey which was airy and unique -a bit too sweet for me but recognize why so many would love it Staff is polite, and prompt. They're very attentive and.  You order quickly and wait time for food is no longer than 5-7 minutes.

Updated review","The almost all chicken menu needs a lot of improvement. Made Nice has been a go to restaurant,  but now the chicken pot pie is ok, but nothing more. The fried chicken is over cooked and way too dark. When questioning the kitchen on this,  ""we know,  but that is how the chef wants it."" The soft serve ice cream is watery,  too sweet and overpriced. The portion is large, but large does not substitute for bad. The salads used to be perfect are also now overdressed.  We hope there is a revision to how this place used to be, as of now it is off course.",,,

I had Chicken Rice here, and while it sounded kinda boring, it was delicious. There were crispy bits in the rice that gave it a wonderful crunch. Everything tasted as good as I had expected! The prices aren't going to be the cheapest lunch you've had, but I think that it's solid value.

Cod Provencal: Amazing light and tender pan-seared cod with a crispy, flavorful exterior, served with chickpea puree, fennel, tomatoes, olives, and fried chickpeas.  It's flavorful, filling, and light.  Loved this!2. Curry Cauliflower Stew: Masterful and flavorful blend of cauliflower, tofu, couscous, coconut milk, lemongrass, watercress, almonds, and GRAPES.  This is my version of comfort food and save for the tomatoes, might even be Tom Brady diet-approved!  I'm not a vegetarian but i could eat this for days.3. Chicken soup: Velvety and rich.  Great as a side and hearty enough on its own.4. Milk and Honey ice cream: LOVED this soft serve which comes with brittle, shortbread, and honey drizzle.  5. garlic roll: $2 for a bite of absolute deliciousness in carb-laden form.Presentation:Superb,  The food is served in recyclable containers and looked amazing out of the box.  Someone clearly put a lot of thought into this.Caveat:I have only ordered takeout and have not actually eaten in.Prices:VERY reasonable at $11 for a vegetarian entree and $12-15 for protein-based dishes.Definitely worth a visit (or 2 or 3...)!",5,3,3

87,Michelle L.,"Portland, OR",231,206,79,4.0,5/1/2017,"TLDR: It's good, but kind of pricey for a light lunch.Pros:- The food IS good. The salads are creative and distinctive from the usual salad places. Having dined at both Eleven Madison Park and The Nomad Hotel, I actually thought the food here was superior to my meal at The Nomad! Not Eleven Madison Park though ;-PCons:- You're basically going to shell out for a $16 salad. That doesn't include drinks, or any extras. It's unnecessarily expensive for what it is; I know that there's star power behind this place, but it's a bit laughable. The $2 bites are also a comical cash grab, given that a whole tray of those desserts probably cost them $5 in total to make.- The meal is light. I ordered the salmon rosti salad and was starving approximately an hour later. Some of the salads are more substantial with a higher content of grains and proteins, but it's still going to be a light meal no matter what. That you paid $16 for.- While they've attempted to crowd control, if the line is really long, you likely won't see the menu until you're ready to order. The area where you wait for your food is like a little ""pen"" and tends to get crowded fast. I got there on the early side (11:45am) and it was already crowded/chaotic. It's not going to scale well. They also don't make the salads fast enough in order to clear out the crowd -- the salads are supposed to take 5 minutes or less to come together, but mine definitely took longer than that.",2,2,4

The presentation of the food was also such a delight. I'm amazed at the flavor combinations especially of my pork shoulder and carrots. The warm grains and fresh veggies really married the pork well. It was only a smidgen too salty, but perhaps I should have mixed the bowl better. If you choose to stay, they give your bowl a heightened effect served on a slate-looking tray that truly pulls the experience together. I loved that there were also staff there to fix your trays to straighten them and even pull your seat out right before you sit down. I paid $11 for this?! Amazing. They don't accept cash here - only credit and debit, probably to keep the long lines moving! Amazing! Will come again and again.",2,2,2
89,Ryan B.,"Livingston, NJ",0,10,13,5.0,4/26/2017,"As soon as I saw this I had to try it. I stopped in for lunch around 145 today and it seems like I picked the right time, I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. They're only open until 3 pm for this week so they can work out some bugs, and it seems like theyve done a great job with that so far.Service: I was greeted with a menu and a smiling welcome the moment I walked in the door. After waiting in a short line, I met another woman who asked if I had any questions and was happy to provide some opoinions and descroptions, once a server was free I was directed to a small counter that displayed their dessert options (more on that later) and had 2 servers with tablets taking orders and payments. The gentleman again asked if I had any questions gave me some thoughts and I settled on the pork and carrots, and strawberry rubarb desert. After that I waited to the side near the counter for my name to be called and food to be delivered.Atmosphere:The restaurant is beautiful, with some seating for people whod like to eat there, but this place was definitely built with the in and out lunch pace of NYC in mind. The kitchen is immaculate, and wide open for everyone to see the food being prepped.Presentation: (I never thought I'd want to do a part on presentation for my takeout lunch)The food was delivered (I ordered to go) in a paper bag with a recipe for tomato confit on it (they seem to have assorted different ones). The pork and carrots came in a cardboard bowl/plate with a plastic cover. All of it was very much recyclable. Despite being in a to go container the food had been placed purposefully on the plate and looked quite nice, they've clearly thought about presentation.Food:The pork and carrots was absolutely delicious. Seperately the carrots/greens had an odd flavor (still good) but everything really blended nicely and tasted great. Id order this again, but I want to go back and try all of the other dishes.My dessert was a small strawberry rhubarb sort of mini cake bite/muffin. It was a delicious little bite that served well as a small snack to end the lunch. They have several other flavors available and some other different desert options as well. Overall: I'd describe this as a sort of high end Dig Inn. I'm excited to see what other sort of food they come up with but this is certainly off to a great start and I'll be back REAL soon to try some of the other dishes.",4,2,

The place itself is cute, modern, and spacious enough for the lunch rush in the area. Orders are taken via ipad, which is cool. I went with the khao salad which was made with steak, broccoli, cilantro and a few other ingredients. If you peep the pic, it looked nice... but it all went downhill from there. Someone got a bit heavy-handed with the salt in the back, making the 90% of the steak bites crunchy and dry. It really took the flavor right out of the meat. Beyond that it was a plate of brocc, so the dish was effectively ruined. Considering it rings in around $4-5 above the competition in the area, it's tough to consider a return visit. Other people at my table had slightly better experiences, but all commented on an abundance of salt in their dishes as well. Tough bc it seems like we caught them on a rough day considering all the other positive reviews here. I wouldn't avoid the place, but cross your fingers that they hold back on the salt chunks (which are normally awesome) in your food.",13,4,12

This week, I suggested my coworkers and I get take-out from here and it was ATROCIOUS. I got the fried chicken sandwich, which was burned to a crisp. I might not have even finished it, but I was hungry. My coworkers also felt their food was mediocre. They don't want to give it another chance, and I can't blame them. My wife ALSO ate here this week and said it was just as bad for her. What happened?",,,

95,Hazel N.,"New York, NY",0,25,0,4.0,3/9/2018,"Super speedy, very fresh, and pretty creative. We were a party of three and were all pleased with our salads, each of which had super fresh greens, a nice mixture of crunchy/chewy textures, and some interesting ingredient combinations. At the end of a busy lunch hour, our salads were ready incredibly quickly. I'd stop in here again and try a couple of other items on the menu.There are kinks to work out, for sure. The space doesn't have a good flow to it. The size of the kitchen looks to be bigger than the size of the dining area, which feels crammed. There is a constant shuffling of people through the dining area because orders need to be picked up. I think it would be much more convenient for everyone involved if servers delivered the food to numbered tables. Too much space is taken up by the entrance corridor, roped off for ""order/pickup"". Not sure what's accomplished by having the person taking orders sort of roam about with a tablet instead of being behind a checkout station. The same person switched between cleaning tables to working the checkout -- why? The slate-look plastic trays are sort of neat, except that they tend to slide around on the tables. In other words, while the food was pretty good, the setup felt kind of clumsy. Having been to Eleven Madison in the past, I'm not sure I see any influence or echoes in the menu at this casual/fast spin-off. Yes, some of the ingredient mashups are on the creative side, but there's nothing particularly innovative. The awkward flow/layout is also surprising, given how well choreographed the service is at EM. It's a decent spot. Not particularly earth-shattering. But worth checking out.",,,

The salmon was way over salted though, so I couldn't eat any of it past the first bite, sadly.

In fact, I fully plan on replicating this at home, but not before I try it several more times so I can get the flavors down right.That dish was cheap at $11, and I'm excited about trying other things to see if it's as stunningly simple yet effective as the curried cauliflower.",,,

The chicken skin was delicious - best part of the dish!Sumac sesame rice crackers - Great concept.  Mine was just a tad under-dry, and hence just short of being crispy/crunchy.  Milk and honey soft serve - absolutely perfect.  The crunchy elements were all on point.  the ice cream had great rich flavor.  Will come back for this all the time.  It has all the elements of the dessert in the nomad library, but not accessible all the time!

Simple menu, credit/debit cards only, and mobile cashiers that take your order while you're in line.For my meal, I decided to go with the steak dish and also the garlic bread that so many people have raved about.The steak dish rang up at $15, which is a bit on the pricy side, but was very well done. The steak was cooked perfectly and was pretty tender--probably could have been a tad more done, but tasty nonetheless. The rest of the dish was very good and paired well with the meat.The garlic bread was good (and cheap at $2), but nothing spectacular.I got to try my friend's chicken and rice and chicken soup--both were very good, though the soup was a bit too salty for me.I also went back and tried one of the milk and honey desserts and that was easily my favorite part of the meal. It was so delicious and the texture was really perfect. My only gripe would be that I wish there was a little more crumble and caramel in it, but I was very satisfied with the end product.Overall, this place serves up some excellent food and is worth checking out to get a taste of the EMP kitchen. The prices are a bit more than the average lunch place, but the quality and flavor of the food more than makes up for it. So good ahead, treat yourself, and enjoy a great NYC lunch--and be sure to try out that dessert!",,,

Updated review",Made Nice is certainly nice. It's a breath of fresh air. They make you feel welcome from the moment you step in. The choices are unique and tasty. You feel less guilty after eating any of them. But don't forget about the little treats by the register. The blueberry corn bread is heavenly and basically destroys all attempts at healthy. It's still worth every calorie. They are mini so it's all good.,1,1,1

Really surprised this place gets so much loving. It's not expensive and quick so maybe okay for grabbing a healthier choice for lunch but like someone mentioned in the review, over-hyped, over-priced for just a salad, y-e-s, I totally agree! Would spend $5 more and have a better food elsewhere. For the same price range, tender greens and mixt are better choices for me. Added an extra star for the nice name.",,,

Though I received my food quickly, it was clear it had been sitting around for a while before making its way to my plate. Unfortunately, while the food was good, it was very buttery similarly to Dig Inn. There was no clear notation of this, and I have an alerts.

Delicious, semi nutrious and includes ingredients I actually know what they are, rather than artificial ingredients.

Since then, I've been several more times because it's close to my office. The salads are expensive but special and tasty. The ingredients always taste fresh and of high quality.My major complaint is that the dressing is really heavy-handed. Some of the salads don't have the option for dressing on the side (the tuna) and it is just too overpowering for my taste. I hate soggy-lettuce and I don't really care for dressing to begin with. These salads would be a lot better if they weren't drenched in dressing.The portion is a decent size. But, for the price - I wish I weren't eating a sopping-wet salad. Honestly, I'm surprised they don't have more options for this as that's the trend lately. What's the point of eating healthy and nutritious salads - if it's drenched in dressing??",1,1,

Yes it's not the NoMad or Eleven Madison Park (disclaimer: I have not been to either) but compared to the rest of the casual options in this price range it's delicious. The menu changes with the season. My favorite is the Chicken Rice, the flavor combination of the chicken with tomatoes and basmati rice and spices and hot sauce is phenomenal. It's $14 which is very reasonable for a good quality meal. The chicken frites at $22 is also good. A large portion of chicken with decent fries although I've had better elsewhere.

I got the cod plate but don't recommend it (the puréed chickpeas is pretty much warm hummus...no bueno) and the cod was 'meh' at best. Beau had the chicken rice plate and said it was tasty. Def skip the bread because it's basic white loaf bread that pretends/wants to be artesian parmesan deliciousness (sad I blew calories on it but it SOUNDED delish and the person who took our order insisted it was amazing.

We ended up getting the Khoa salad and roasted half chicken. It didn't take too long to get our food. We did see that for some, they brought the food to the table. The food presentation gave hint to the caliber in the kitchen as well the all the flavors. The khoa salad was simply a perfect marriage of texture, visual appeal, broccoli and rice crunch with juicy steak slices. This dish will make a non-salad believer into a devout salad eater. We really enjoyed this filling dish.The roasted chicken was very reminiscent of Daniel Humm's chicken at the Nomad (minue the price tag) with the sleek and crisp chicken skin and stuffed deliciousness just above below it. The chicken is fabulousness. The fries are a bit salty and salad a bit lemony... but is best tampered by a beer.The milk and honey dessert is also a must get as its elevated dessert without the elevated price.I highly recommend this casual dining spot to get a real taste of what NYC's best chefs churn out without going for broke.",5,1,4

Additionally, you're able to watch them prepare your food! There is a giant menu mounted on the wall explaining every dish and its ingredients. I ordered the warm chicken and a garlic roll. Honest to god the warm chicken dish was plentiful and so filling I WAS STUFFED. The garlic roll was $2, and while I could of paid $1 for 5 at a pizzaria; this garlic roll was loaded with garlic filling and tasted so fluffy and amazing. Every worker was incredibly nice and made sure the tables were clean. Additionally, there is plenty of seating because most people take their orders to go.

We ordered the hot spiked apple cider, the famous chicken frites, and a vegetable side (was not memorable and would pass on this next time). The chicken and stuffing were delicious and flavorful, although there was not enough stuffing. The fries were tasty as well, and that's coming from someone who is not a huge fan of potatoes. My one complaint is that the chicken frites is served on top of this brown paper, which clearly gets torn up and deteriorated with the knife use and cutting that goes into consuming roast chicken. The hot spiked apple ciders didn't seemed spiked and were too sweet. But they were good. The drinks came with sweet little caramel waffles that I enjoyed. I will be back to try the milk and honey soft serve!Side note - I wanted to come on a day that happened to be Veterans' Day and so wanted to check ahead of time if they were open.

150,Katie N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,1.0,4/18/2018,"Let me start by saying I've been a huge fan of EMP and Daniel Humm, even before EMP got its first star. I was so excited about Made Nice's concept and went for lunch at least 3 times a week when it was first opened. Just tried to go back today for the new spring menu. Ordered Chicken sausage Banh Mi sandwich and the not-so-new Chicken Rice. The sandwich is laughable both in size and flavor. It's the smallest sandwich i've seen for $12 and I'm not sure how it's called ""banh mi."" None of the flavors are remotely Vietnamese : the sausage, the pate, the picked veggies all carry a monotonous sour note. I get that Daniel is a big fan of acid but this sandwich is a fail in every way. Worse the chicken rice has a rancid and metal taste, the rice is too salty and dry. The only thing good on the plate is the roasted cherry tomatoes. Daniel and Will: please come back from all your new LA ventures and fix your menu and your recipes. I don't think it's just a matter of execution, i think the recipes are off!",1,,
151,Brittany M.,"Boston, MA",78,26,2,1.0,10/19/2017,"Extremely disappointed. Went when it first opened - salad was very petit (for how expensive it was) and was drenched in oil. Went back today, months after opening to give it a second shot and ordered the tuna nicoise salad and ""coffee soda."" The tuna was grey, the entire dish was very monotonously colored, and again still drenched in oil, but the size was bigger (from the amount of mixed greens they put as a bed). The coffee soda was undrinkable and I'm a black cold brew, no sugar, no milk, kind of gal. There's a reason ""coffee soda"" hasn't caught on yet.",,1,

I did add the garlic roll, it was an end piece, kind of small, not as tasty as I thought it would be, and not really worth $2 in my opinion, but my main course was satisfying and seemed healthy too. I did only drink the self service tap water, but it would have been a nice touch if ice was available, as the water (on this very hot day outside) was not really cold enough.  During the meal, the music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation without raising your voice to my friend sitting right across from me.  I'd definitely go back, but probably not too often.",,,

163,Seth B.,"New York, NY",8,39,0,2.0,6/23/2017,"Ok, so here is my review of Made Nice after having gone on 3 separate occasions (all picking up lunch and taking back to the office nearby) and ordering the same thing every time (Salmon Rosti).After the first experience, I'm really surprised to be leaving a 2 star review, but here is how we got here. The first time I got this salad I thought it was the best salad I've ever eaten. It looked amazing, it tasted amazing and despite the price tag and wait it was all worth it.When I went back a second time with coworkers, I considered trying another item, but thought why bother when they served me the best salad I've ever eaten. This time I returned to find the salad was far from the high expectations I had the first time. It probably didnt help that the wait somehow got longer and the woman bagging them and calling names seemed to be quite upset to be there. When I got back and opened my salad, I moved things around a little bit and found the big root end of a romaine lettuce stem. I expect this from my $9 salad place with unlimited toppings around the corner, but not from Daniel Humm and not when spending over $15 for a salad. It was also just kind of bland. Maybe it wasnt dressed well, but it just didnt have whatever it had the first time. Also, the eggs (maybe the best part of the salad) were all over cooked.I thought, maybe the second time was just a fluke and today went for the third time. This time, no wait. Actually it was really empty. Maybe too empty. Or maybe it is just a Friday in the Summer and no one is in the city. Either way, I got back to my office hoping to find that the first time I went was the real deal and the last time was a mistake. No such luck. The salad was once again under-dressed and bland. And while the eggs were cooked perfectly, much of the lettuce was brown, as in it oxidized for sitting out too long. Again, maybe something I would expect from my local every day salad place, but not from Humm and not for a $15+ salad.",2,,
164,Yvonne W.,"New York, NY",301,37,1,5.0,7/16/2017,"The best fast casual spot in the neighborhood for sure. I've been here twice and both times were amazing - I absolutely loved the Khao salad with steak and the spring chicken salad. Both dishes were so flavorful and so different from what you'd expect from a regular fast casual spot. Yes it's a bit more expensive than other fast casual places, but the portions are big (I could eat the spring chicken salad for two meals) and the quality is definitely top notch. I'd recommend for both lunch and dinner!",1,,
165,Annie B.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",79,3,8,5.0,9/5/2017,"Woah holy delicious! I didn't mess around with a salad but went straight for the Chicken Frites.

167,Joe M.,"New York, NY",3,18,0,1.0,5/1/2017,"After reading O.Y.'s review where he or she says, ""I love this place so much I could actually cry,"" I knew I had to post a review.  This place does not merit more than one star. The food is way over priced and stale. I paid $16.33 for what Made Nice calls ""Salmon Rosti  Salad."" A better and more accurate name is ""Old lettuce + a dollar's worth of sliced salmon and fried teeter tots."" You want to know why this place is so expensive, it's because it's filled with employees. You are paying for all these unnecessary workers, it's a lunch spot, not Le Bernardin. I wouldn't be surprised if these same people you see working at Made Nice are the ones writing these YELP Reviews that are giving this place 5 stars. Ever notice how quick this place got 12 reviewers crying and giving it 5 stars? Count for yourself, there are 14 reviews to date and the  first 12  gave this place 5 stars, including the famous O.Y. who wrote he/she was crying. You talk about fake news; I call these 5 stars ""fake reviews"".  I'm going to list the amount of people that work at Made Nice. On the day I visited I walked in and a woman (woman #1) greeted me, behind her another woman (woman #2) handed me the menu. I then walked into the restaurant and another woman (woman #3) asked for my order and took my menu. Woman #3 then walked over to two women (woman #4 and woman #5) and told them my order. Both woman#4 and #5 were holding iPads with credit card swipe adapters. Woman #3 then walked back to me and told me that woman #4 was ready to take my order. I walked over and said, ""salmon rosti"" and handed her a $20 bill, she tells me they didn't take cash so I gave her my debit card with my name on it, Joe M. Women #4 then told me to stand by the two podiums in front of the kitchen to collect my food.  While I waited for my name to be called I noticed that this was the only area of the restaurant where black people worked. The only place for blacks at Made Nice was behind these two empty podiums. The black's job was to to call your name and put your food inside of a huge paper shopping bag. These ladies didn't look happy at all!.  Btw, while I was waiting for my food I looked into the kitchen and I didn't see one black person and TRUST ME, I am very observant!!!! So why does this place get one star? Basically you have lots of employees, cheap food (old lettuce/little salmon fried teeter tots) and an expensive paper shopping bag for $16.33.  I will never go to Made Nice again. As for these 5 star reviews, next time the owners should wait until the customers write them instead of having their employees or friends create these fake reviews, peace.",8,7,2
168,Kaitlyn C.,"Ocala, FL",0,11,0,3.0,7/9/2017,"This modern food certainly was different. The menu is quite small and mostly the same ideas with different ingredients in each bowl. I got the cauliflower dish, it was good but toooo much curry (if you don't love curry) I figured that just the cauliflower would be tossed in it but almost everything on the dish was drenched in it. The grapes had a amazing taste on the dish though. My boyfriend got the hanger steak and loved it! It was a cute little restaurant with different drinks also.",1,,

172,Georgie R.,"New York, NY",223,3,0,2.0,5/13/2017,"I was very disappointed in the service and overall experience at Made Nice. Briefly, rude customer service and not enough seating. Rushing people to finish their meals to let new customers sit down, with people stuck standing up eating next to the trash can. Let's start from the beginning I suppose. We received our food right away but there was no place to sit. Food looked great, but we are standing there with no empty tables, holding heavy stone trays, watching about 12 other people wandering around looking for seating as well; the dining area was far too small. Though gourmet food and price point the too full dining area was lacking in space and atmosphere, it looked like Shake Shack. When I went back to the counter the manager told me ""she could not control how fast people ate"" and could give us to-go boxes since it was ""a good day for eating in the park"" (it wasn't). Fine, but also you shouldn't be rushing your kitchen when the dining area is full and you have people wandering around with $50 dinners eating over the trash cans. Lastly, my friend went to get our dessert at the end, which is a little card you present when you would like your ice cream, and subsequently watched to manager scold the employee for not knowing who the order belonged to despite there being no name or tracking system on the card. I was really put off that the manager was unhelpful and rather condescending. They need to make adjustments to their system and in the meantime try harder to be hospitable and helpful.",2,2,

176,Vivien N.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1,5.0,9/3/2017,"Delicious!!!We came here lured in by photos of the chicken frites. It was even better than we hoped. The lemony, savory stuffing is actually layered under the crispy skin of the chicken, which takes it to the next level. The moist and tender white meat was even better than the dark meat, which is how you know a chicken has been cooked perfectly. The fries were perfectly crispy and rosemary scented. Even the pickled veggies on the side were delightful. But the main event is the chicken--our eyes were rolling to the back of our heads it was so good. We also had the Khao Salad (a dish with roasted broccoli, grilled hanger steak, and crisped rice and shallots) that was also stellar. It was largely broccoli but we savagely shoveled it into our mouths as if it were something not so good for you. Yum. Overall, it was clear that the food was thoughtful, wholesome, and well executed. Can't wait to try more!",,,

Updated review","Got to try more of their menu for takeout. I think my favorite is still the curried cauliflower but that's not to say the other dishes weren't impressive!Khao Salad - I think of the dishes I tried this time, this was my favorite, mostly because of the super tender hanger steak. The crispy parts of the dish were actually a bit jarring to me - but others in my group liked it a lot. Pork and carrots - So many different colors of carrots! The pork was tender and flavorful and this was the favorite of many in my group. Chicken Frites - The chicken was very juicy and actually quite sizeable, and while I'm not a fan of cheese, those who were seemed to like the lemon Parmesan stuffing. The fries were a solid addition as well.Chicken rice - Another popular dish, with some nice spicing. Again everything was beautiful and came with a nice mix of flavors and textures which elevate it to another level compared to other fast casual spots.",,,

The presentation was really pretty but when I got to my office and went in on this meal I almost immediately spit it out. First of all, it was cold. I was expecting a warm meal not a cold salad. But this wasn't the worst part- the worst was the mushy overcooked butternut squash and the slimy wet chicken. It made the whole thing inedible. I ended up eating the greens which were drowsed in vinegar btw and throwing the rest out. For the price I really expected something better but I'll be sticking to Dig Inn down the block instead!",,,

Why would you ever pay $15 for a takeaway meal from some generic company again now that Made Nice is here?Service isn't what I expected but the food was packed with surprises, flavours and very substantial portions. I applaud Chef Humm from bringing his inspirational approach to ingredients to be accessible for almost everyone. This place is 5 star and best value meal in NYC.

196,N K.,"Spring Valley, NY",0,9,1,5.0,9/30/2017,"The menu has a variety of healthy choices. We tried the cauliflower salad and the chicken and rice dish. They were both delicious. The only downside is the portions were a bit on the smaller side, but still satisfying.",,,
197,John F.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,22,3,5.0,9/16/2017,"Salad lovers, come one, come all. The Curry Cauliflower salad is chef worthy. Wonderful small grapes, dates, and charred cauliflower--just the right crunchiness, sweetness, but not over the top. 11 out of 10 if 10 is godly. Yummy!",,,
198,Eugenia N.,"New York, NY",62,15,1,4.0,6/26/2017,"I had high expectations which were not met, but if judging without that, it was very yummy. Not incredible.  Snap pea salad was fresh and very good.  Scallops were the favorite. Veggie burgers are delish.",1,,
199,Lara C.,"New York, NY",0,55,0,1.0,5/3/2017,"This place is owned by the same owners as Eleven Madison Park and The Nomad, which I suspect is the reason for such great reviews.  The chef and the team are very talented and accomplished. I tried 3 vegetarian meals from their menu and did not like any of them. In my opinion, great ideas poorly executed. I had grains and greens, curry cauliflower and quinoa falafel. The grains and greens meal, the grains were over covered with sauce/dressing, it was goopy and lacked salt. On the positive note, the greens were not mixed with the grains so I was at least able to enjoy that. The almond butter was salty, which helped the grains, however overall this meal was unappetizing.  I couldn't taste all the different elements and flavors of the meal, all I tasted was goop. The curry cauliflower, it tasted a lot like something I make at home. It was the most flavorful out of the 3 meals I tried but again it had way too much sauce, however; cauliflower with char, tofu, curry, coconut, lemongrass, grapes and almonds worked really well together, the meal was balanced and had varying flavors and textures.  I enjoyed the couscous that was served with the meal as well.  It's pretty much chicken curry salad, made with cauliflower instead of chicken and grapes instead of raisins.  The quinoa falafel, the falafel was dry and did not have very much quinoa.  The beets, baby greens and quinoa were over covered with thick cranberry sauce type dressing, this flavor took over the entire meal.  It was a beets and cranberry sauce salad rather than quinoa and falafel. There wasn't very much quinoa in the salad and the greens wilted from too much sauce on them. The best part about this meal was the yogurt sauce.    On a side note, it costs over $600 to have a meal at Eleven Madison Park for two people, which excludes most Americans since it isn't affordable for most. An American that makes a decent living would reconsider dining there.  If I was Questlove, I wouldn't think twice about a $600 meal but I am not so it's nice to see this affordable place from owners of Eleven Madison.Also, I interviewed at Nomad and was offered a position but only if I could work 50 hours a week as the rest of the team, I hardly consider that a ""nice"" environment. It is an unfriendly environment for part-time working mothers/parents, people that value family over work, and people with other goals. I can empathize with the folks that work 50 hours a week, I've been there before in a different industry, just don't care for it anymore as I value my life, family and dreams more than working for someone else's dream. It may be a different story if I was an employee and a part owner. The restaurant industry can learn a thing or two from companies like Amazon, where employees are also owners. My interview was a 10hour working interview without pay, the food industry is notorious for such bad human capital practices. The nomad however at least offered a tasting of their menu during the interview. The meal indeed was incredible unlike my experience at Made Nice. The meal probably cost what I would have earned that day at a rate of $10/hour, something else that should be shameful for the restaurant industry.  If a restaurant can't afford to pay its employees more, than the likelihood is that food isn't good so you don't have customers/revenue/profits and you shouldn't be in business to begin with. I hope this team can take constructive criticism and doesn't end up on a mission to ruin my career.  I am simply interested in improving the industry, especially for the people that work in it.  Be pioneers for your employees not just food.",3,,1
