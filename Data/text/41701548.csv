Bring cash because they have a $25 card minimum.",1,,3

Would love to go back and place some of those street fighter with some nice cold bear from the bottle:) not that I go such a places always but you know when you get together with your high school friends this is the place you need to be silly and playful.The wettest fighter is one of favorite since the street fighter is on long time ago :) still can't beat it but still trying. The night that we had there was amazing. 10 Friends and we all made the nights till 2 am (it's the closing time Just remember you will have such a great fun , you will think you are a teenager again and do some silly stuff with no doubt. They close 2 am and open 5 week days and open 1pm Thursday to Sunday.  Have fun",4,,3
5,David D.,"New York, NY",2,13,2,1.0,9/16/2018,"Maybe this place used to be good, hence the good ratings. Most of the arcade machines were not working, either ate my quarters, the buttons would jam, or other stuff wouldn't work. Maybe because the machines are so old, they can't be repaired? If so, they should decrease the price to pay then and let you know first. Also, decided to relive my youth and ordered a Saki bomb. Got about a shot of beer in a whiskey glass and a shot of Saki. When I asked for more beer, I got attitude and a bewildered look from the bartender. So I just ordered a Sapporo after. It was warm despite being on tap. The bartender was also managing the place it seemed so when I had trouble with the machines, I didn't feel like bringing it up to him. Bottom line: there are better arcades in the city where everything works where the employees know that the customer comes first.",1,,
6,Kate S.,"New York, NY",76,679,3081,4.0,11/20/2017,"I really like this place, it's nice not to just sit around and drink, but to also play games!I hope it's not closed permanently, I just read that it got shut down: boweryboogie.com/2017/11…",1,,
7,Josh G.,"New Hyde Park, NY",319,582,6053,4.0,3/5/2017,"Do you like Barcade? Those spots can be pretty darn fun. But if you want something a little off the beaten path with similar mindset then you're in luck. It's Two-Bits time! Two-Bits rocks the same realm as the Barcade scene with arcade games and some good brews. One big difference? Pinball! There's a nice selection of classic pinball games (well, circa 1990's or so) when you first enter and straight to the back. Despite the higher coin price, they were mostly only 50 cents per game. Though, when you combine drinking with video games, you'll often find a few free balls here and there.Beyond the pinball, the arcade game selection was way more eclectic than many Barcades I've been to. I don't know the last time I played Police Trainer and Spy Hunter before that night so it was nostalgically awesome to say the least. Only downers I can throw out there were the smaller selection of brews and the size of the place. It got a little sardine-esque which didn't bode too well for my girlfriend, but we made it work. Overall, Two-Bits Arcade is a classically refreshing take on the retro-arcade bar scene. It's well worth a stop in if you find yourself a little south in NYC. Bring some quarters and rock on!",8,3,6
8,Katie V.,"Buffalo, NY",101,110,173,4.0,8/31/2017,"I always have a fun time when I visit Two-Bit's. They have a variety of pinball and arcade games to keep you entertained and buttered popcorn on hand for snacking. This is not a bar to visit if your plan is to simply drink or socialize. There's limited seating here, including at the bar. Additionally, the alcohol selection is somewhat limited. I'm a wine drinker and I found their Sauvignon Blanc to be satisfying. It's higher-quality than what many places with a limited wine selection offer, in my opinion. Heed my caution, however: the wine selection is indeed limited. This is a dive bar: as long as your expectations match the atmosphere, you'll be fine.For Manhattan, I consider their drink prices to be on the more affordable end of things. I usually come here to satisfy an urge to play pinball. I've never seen a pinball machine out-of-order here (though I don't come often), and the games seem to be well-maintained (though I'm not an expert). What I like about the pinball machines here is that they aren't so hard to play that it's frustrating to the amateur (such as myself), yet they're sufficiently challenging. The prices of the games are pretty fair -  most are 3 games for $2, while a few are 75 cents per game.Anytime I've visited Two-Bit's, I've received friendly service. The last time I stopped in, it was a pretty dead night, and the bartender was happy to chit-chat during his downtime, which I appreciated. (I tend to give preferential treatment to bars with friendly bartenders, even if they can't always stand around and shoot the breeze - feeling welcome is paramount to me.)A bigger variety of wines and liquors would be good, but I consider this place to be primarily an arcade and secondarily, a bar, so it's not a big deal!",6,1,2

The arcade is such a great spot to bring friends for casual, mindless fun. They have a nice selection of classic arcade favorites, including pinball and fighting games. Drinks are also reasonably priced. My only complaint is that the machines are a bit run-down and a few won't start even after putting money in. It would be nice if they properly labeled or repaired the ones that are out-of-order. Otherwise, can't wait to be back!!",,,

14,Stephanie C.,"Queens, NY",346,90,97,5.0,6/19/2017,"Roamed around Essex and came upon this arcade filled bar. I'm a huge fan of sake so the fact that they have unfiltered and filtered sake is a plus. In addition they have amazing deals for 40s which takes me back to college and also drinking deals for when football games are on. Not too much seating around, my friend and I sat near the window front but weren't amused to hear the recurrent aggressive noise of a man trying to demonstrate his machismo nature by hitting the boxing/punching bag as hard as he could. They had more pin ball games than I'd like since I'm more of a shooting fan. Bathroom reeked of piss but had awesome graffiti and stickers across all of the walls. Would come back to play the games.",2,,
15,Evan H.,"New York, NY",314,781,44,2.0,10/17/2017,"This place appeared promising, but the selection of games, coupled with pretty pricey ""cheap"" beer, and the fact that it's dirty all over, makes this a one time visit. Not sure, you'll say, ""it's the lower east side, and it's a place for old arcade games, what did you expect."" Well, I expect better games and better beer options. The whiskey here was also awful, and sweet (though we were warned of the latter). Overall, if you want to play arcade games, there are better places..wink wink.",4,,
16,Marina W.,"Boston, MA",7,93,0,2.0,1/8/2018,"This place makes me cranky.There is a $25 credit card minimum. Not only is this not legal (a merchant is able to have up to a $10 minimum, should they so elect) but it's absurd. $25? If you want to be cash-only, then just effing say you're cash-only. I thought the drinks were expensive. It's probably on par for Manhattan and also many of barcades (the concept, not the brand) I went to had cheaper drink options. To their credit, the games are mostly well maintained (the NBA Jam display was wonky and we were unable to play 3 player because it seems that some of the button didn't seem to work). There is a small but reasonable selection of classic games but the highlight is probably The Sopranos pinball.",,,
17,Phill K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,12,70,5.0,2/27/2018,"At some points this place may seem  little shady, however that's the point of a dive bar. The atmosphere and arcades not only bring back nostalgic memories from the 80's and early 90's but the drink prices are pretty damn good as well. Me and my wife had a BLAST and can't wait to hang out there again. She dominated the Simpsons pinball machine. I would rather chill in there than Dave & Busters.",,,

We had an awesome time there's tons of games so we were occupied and it was definitely different then your typical bar night. Drinks were a little high for what I expected because it's really not a high end place. Also the bathroom smelled like cat pee and was pretty disgusting but again not high end what do you expect. This is a really fun and great place if you're looking for a different experience than just drinking at a bar. They have a machine to turn dollars into quarters so you can play the games.,1,,

But this place appears to be dingy and poorly kept.I also second the review below about sketchy characters. Not a happy sight when you're trying to relax and let loose.Didn't try the beer even though they had my favorite (Sapporo).

27,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",292,1301,45,3.0,9/13/2016,"I came here for a small company event. As a bar it's okay, typical ironically apathetic LES bar. As an arcade it's rather dreadful. Sure they have a lot more games than your average bar, but a lot of them are in very poor working order. As a fan of video and arcade games it makes me pretty sad. Even their newish beer pong machine is broken, many of the cups don't register when you land a ball in them.The most intriguing specimen they have is a working cabinet of the popular 1983 Star Wars game from Atari. Luckily, it is in good working order -- for now.Barcade beats this place handily, primarily because their machines are held to a higher standard of functionality.",2,,

They have shooting games, a beer pong game, pinball, racing, etc. I've been to arcade bars before and this one is average in comparison.

And she was like ""yeah, we should get a drink in there"" and I was like ""yeah, definitely"".  Best decision we made all weekend.  Now, it wasn't my first time in an arcade/bar - I've been to Barcade & Midway in Williamsburg, Pioneers in Chelsea and Barcadia in Austin & Dallas, but sometimes those places are almost too big and with too many hipsters who are just there to look cool and don't actually play any of the games.  Two Bit's is different - it's on the small, almost tiny size, and the people there are true arcade geeks who like to drink, so it's a lot of fun!  I'm not a video game player now, like most guys, but I was when I was a kid, so this was fun for me to relive some of those memories...but with alcohol this time lol.The other thing that I thought was cool about Two Bit's was that although they have a full bar, the drink of choice by the locals is a '40'...specifically Colt 45, haha.  Hadn't had one of those since college, I think, or was it last year, hmm.Anyway, we got our drinks...her a Prosecco and me a 40, haha, and then proceeded to just play games.  The price of each was remarkably only 25 cents...as it was in the 80's, and they had all the classic ones...Donkey Kong, Pacman, Spy Hunter, Big Buck Hunter, Joust, etc.Needless to say, what we thought would be a 10-minute grab a drink and check the place out, turned into several hours and me getting the Top Score on Spy Hunter, lol.  We had so much juvenile fun, more than I'd had in a long time.So it's a great place to come with a group of people, on a date, or even by yourself, and I highly recommend it.  It's perfect for one of those cold or dreary days where you have to be inside.  I mean, if you're gonna have to be inside, it might as well be here, because: Arcades + Alcohol + Good Company = Fun!",12,6,13

One of the spots that kinda makes you want to wash your hands after touching any surface, and on top of that, pretty shady bartenders. Whenever we bought drinks, they'd tell you the total, but after they charge your card, it's a different amount. This is likely tax--or maybe an extra gratuity--we'll never know because they only give you the signature receipt after it's been charged, with no itemized receipt. Either way, I don't like it and I don't trust it. The arcade is dingy and poorly set up. To top off my awful time here, I was playing a game next to the punching bag machine, when some guy completely missed the bag and punched me in the arm. My full beer spilled on the floor, the guy ran, and the bartender watched. Not that I was expecting them to chase him, but at least throw me a free beer! She did not. I was charged in full for a new beer (which by the way, was again misled about the price, and paid more than the quoted amount). Me and my bruised arm will stick to Barcade a few blocks down.",12,2,1

Hang at the bar, play some games. Eat some popcorn.Most games are 25 cents. Some can be higher.

""gaming issues that i had""you thought the barcade buttons and issues were bad, retro's machines are the worst ive seen. they clearly dont update their buttons for these cabinets, its to the point where i was playing one of the shooting games and the calibrations were wayyyyyyyyy off when aiming, if i were drunk i probabaly would appreciated that or thought it was a secret move or something. but i was clearly sober and wanting to play. The street fighter they had wasnt even the right version you could really play with your friends either. i was instantly sad when the computer did a sonic boom and changed into blanka....MID MATCH! ""my thoughts""i would come back to this location, it is well kept and clean (even the bathrooms). it is a great place to meet with friends just for a neighborhood hangout, but from a competitive gamer perspective i would be touching the gaming part of this bar, i will come here for a drink or two.",23,12,15
48,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3176,11030,4.0,7/10/2013,"Yay.Imagine Barcade. But smaller. And in a more convenient location. And more LIGHT GUN GAMES!!!Almost everything is a quarter, except for the super fancy games like Big Buck Hunter HD (which actually takes credit cards).Wasn't too crowded on a Friday night (never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a specific machine).They don't take cards for drinks, but they do have a change machine and they'll sell you rolls of quarters.Come here for the games. Stay to watch guys' girlfriends awkwardly stand around!",6,4,2
49,Leo L.,"New York, NY",99,377,1225,3.0,3/2/2013,"This place brings back memories of fireballs and power pellets. Two Bit's is your retro arcade/bar theme joint. Located in LES, it's a place to check out if you're in the area and want to kill some time. Most games cost a quarter and they do have some great classics! - Street Fighter II: Championship Edition ( Rainbow Ver. aka hacked edition)- Neo-Geo machine with Bubble Bobble, Samurai Showdown, Aero Fighters 2, etc.- Paperboy with the handlebars??? sick- Tetris, Punch-out, Final Fight and alot more ( full list of what they have, visit the FB Page)They have Beer/Wine/Sake with a pricetag of 6-8 each glass. The place isn't huge so when it becomes crowded like last night, the experience could kill your buzz. Cool spot to check out if you've never been but avoid if you can start to smell what deodorant the guy next to you is wearing.",7,2,3
50,Andrew C.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,65,13,4.0,3/9/2015,"This place is awesome! Totally a time portal into the past. Most games play for a quarter, and range up to about a dollar a play- pinball machines are 75 cents. They have a decently good selection of games, although I wish they'd have a couple others (regular pac-man, house of the dead) but overall a decent selection to come chill and play. I prefer to come here during the middle of the week when it isn't crazy busy so I can actually PLAY. It is a barcade- the bartender that's always here is super friendly and chill. A decent selection of beers(that's what I always drink), but sometimes you play russian roulette with their beer selection. Good drinks specials during the week as well. Definitely want to check out this place.",3,,
51,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64753,4.0,2/6/2013,"This place gets 4 stars just on the strength of the fact that they have the extremely rare bootleg version of Street Fighter II (the one where you can throw multiple fireballs simultaneously and all kinds of other insane stuff happens). And also the fact that this is the only place anywhere near here where you can get a chance to play these games.When I heard they had this as one of their games (good lookin' with the tip Jordan W.), I knew I had to come check this place out. They have a bar too, but I'm not really interested in drinking - but not to worry, they have plenty of good stuff here to satisfy people just looking to play some old school video games.They have a number of quality classic games, like the aforementioned awesome version of Street Fighter, Captain America & The Avengers, Final Fight, Paperboy, Tetris, and Marvel vs. Capcom. They also have a little foosball table in the front, and several pinball machines in the back.Don't get me wrong, I love the old school feel of it, and the fact that most of the games cost just 25 cents, but they could really benefit from some newer titles (Mortal Kombat II would be awesome, and NBA Jam Tournament Edition would just be too good to be true).This place was pretty empty (which I guess could make sense since it was a Wednesday), so it was nice to get your pick of the games, but at the same time it was missing that fun feel of a packed arcade and the challenge of other people to beat on in Street Fighter and other games.I would definitely come back if I'm in the area, even though I just beat Street Fighter II in about 20 minutes on only 2 or 3 quarters (M. Bison is so cheap), but I'm hoping they get some new games some time in the near future for some better replay value.",10,3,5

They have Street Fighter II, Paperboy, Fight Champ, Frogger, Ms. Pac Man, the original Marvel vs. Capcom and pinball machines (with BEER HOLDERS!!!)To think my boyfriend and I actually found this place my complete mistake. I was surprising him with tickets to a touring film festival but we were looking for a place to enjoy drinks and I was going to take him to Max Fish because he likes arcade games and such. I ended up taking a wrong turn onto Essex street and we both stopped in our tracks immediately upon seeing the arcade machines and bar set-up and hopped in.He was excited with the games they have, the ""nostalgic bad"" arcade pizza (their pie sits under a heat lamp in a big, old-school box thing) and ""nostalgic"" hot dogs on one of these spinning griller things (think 7-11, only they had no hot dogs on it this night, lol) and he enjoyed some red wine.I was excited for the games and for the cool selection of (seemingly curated and probably constantly rotating) domestic craft beers (Coney Island Lager much! YAY!) and seasonal foreign brews as well.Had a nice chat with the manager too about wines and their friendly bartender told us that they had just opened about 5-6 weeks ago. This place is a breath of fresh air for adults who like things like fine 80s gaming, pinball machines, fine wine/beer and bad pizza (lol). I look forward to hangs here again very soon :).",21,11,14

After checking out another bar arcade that was way too loud and crowded, we found Two Bit's. -- chill vibes (not too young, frat bro-ish, or intense about gaming)-- good cheap drinks and 25 cent games-- not too loud or crowded, even on a Saturday night-- huge variety of games so everyone can find something to playWe had an awesome time, and I'd definitely come back!",2,,
54,Dani P.,"Arlington, VA",85,792,643,4.0,1/5/2015,"I met some friends here before a show. This place has all of the pin ball machines and arcade machines that I loved as a kid. My friend's husband enjoyed his beer while the three of us girls grabbed some quarters and played The Simpsons. Unfortunately, Lisa's spot was broken, but we played Marge Homer and Bart :)The only downside is that they don't have any real food, so if you want snacks, you'll need to go somewhere else. Otherwise, it's like a better Dave and Busters because it has games from our youth.",3,1,1
55,Sean H.,"Richmond, CA",484,798,35,3.0,1/8/2015,"Two Bit's sounds like a great idea on paper. Retro arcade games and alcohol? What's not to love about it right? Well, sometimes paper ideas tend to get crumpled and thrashed pretty easily.First off, half the machines I played here didn't work. The Simpsons game is probably their best game, and Lisa is broken and the sticks for Homer weren't too responsive. Any game with a gun has it's sights drastically off, and it's definitely not just drunk Sean shooting randomly. Their Street Fighter game is so glitched that it had Vega shooting hadoukens and Chun Li magically transforming into Guile midfight. All this is probably due to drunken escapades and spilled drinks.Price is pretty cheap for the most part. .25 cent for most games, but pinball is strangely .75 cents or a dollar for some machines. Location is pretty alright too, as they're only a block from Delancey.Their selection of games is okay at best. They did have some classics running well that I was pretty surprised to find, like NBA Jam and Crazy Taxi, but not enough to get these guys past 3 stars. Probably gonna check out some of the other barcades they've got in the city!",3,1,

I've just been here for the games. I can't really imagine having fun here drunk because it's cramped and full of bros taking turns hitting the punching bag, at least it was tonight. Also, there was a SUPER sketch dude walking around behind everyone, and checking for coins in the coin release slot of every game. I'm not sure if the bartender noticed him, but he was in there for a while, and it just wasn't that fun to have to look back at my belongings on the chair every two seconds to make sure the sketchy dude wasn't fondling with it. Anyway, I would come back in the day because it'd probably be less crowded and it looks like they have a good happy hour. They also have board games behind the bar. The bartender seemed nice. They had some pretty cool games. I like the bowling one even though I suck at it.",2,,
57,Peter V.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",1,22,0,3.0,6/14/2016,"Not a bad place, but the games tend to be on the expensive side. There was a bowling game that required something like $2 in order to play. It's a BOWLING game. C'mon. They had a film playing and the atmosphere was kind of relaxed. The music didn't seem to be extremely loud so it was easy to talk. I also got punched in the face by that Strength Tester Punching Bag when I was trying to figure out how to start it. That was my fault though. Warning: Do not stand on the platform when the Punching Bag comes down. ;)",,1,

So it was refreshing compared to barcade which is a madhouse on weekends. Bar is limited to wine, sangria, bottled beer and saki.

Games like Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, The Simpsons, Mortal Kombat... you know, a ton of awesome games from back in the day when arcades were in.

Decent beer selection for a small bar.  Most of the arcade consoles work as designed but some suffer wear and tear since not all patrons will treat these games like their own.  Mix alcohol into it and you get some broken guns and joysticks.  Most weeknights it's not too crowded but its a bit tight on Friday and Saturday nights as expected for a bar in LES.  Still you don't have a hard time playing most of the games you wanna play.  We didn't have to wait long to get our turn at Final Fight or Marvel Vs Capcom just to name a few.  Very chill and relaxing place.  Now I just wish they would fix the machine gun on the time crisis game.,1,,
85,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,6/17/2013,"It's a fact, arcades are a dying institution. We live in a world now where arcades are rare, far and very few in between, a distant memory of our past, and maybe just now a memory for most. I really miss the arcades of the olden days. Two Bit's Retro Arcade is certainly an LES treasure, and I am so happy to know that arcades like this one still do exist in the city. Let's do our best to keep them standing. You'll recognize many if not all the titles available at Two Bit's. They have some great titles which include Street Fighter II (modded!), Marvel Vs. Capcom, Captain America and the Avengers, Final Fight, Donkey Kong, Punch Out, Crisis Zone, Paperboy, and T2. They also have some pinball machines and foosball. Two Bit's is not a very large arcade though, and it might leave some with a burning desire for more. A lot of great titles such as Tekken, Time Crisis, House of Dead, Mortal Kombat, and such are amiss, but one can't say how feasible it is to cross such grand machines nowadays. Actually, there might be only enough games to keep one occupied and entertained for an hour or two tops unless you are one of those people who challenges everyone on the SF II machine, which I'm pretty sure was modded (pretty sick). While Two Bit's is an arcade, it's also a bar, but it's actually one of its weaker points. The bar is limited to only beer, wine and sake. The beer selection is pretty sparse in terms of draft, and mostly limited to domestic and commercialized brands. Pricing is actually a bit expensive, but I guess average for Manhattan. Unfortunately, no craft beers or special drinks. Wine selection is surprisingly better than the beer, as they have shelves of many different wines available. In terms of the space of Two Bit's itself, it's smaller than it looks on the outside. The area in between the machines is quite narrow; you're going to have to stand to the sides or risk having your drink bumped and spilling all over you as people walk by. There are seats at the bar though and a little area at the front that allows for more space. Good thing is though that it doesn't get ever too packed to death even for a Saturday night. With a limited bar and a limited number of games to play, it's not possible for anyone to stay here for too long -- the perfect answer to crowd control. I can't say though that Two Bit's is a match to the arcade of our yesterday, and as a bar, it's pretty weak. Nonetheless, this is a very fun hangout spot for the weekend. Especially if arcades and old-school gaming were your thing growing up, Two Bit's will be a nostalgic reminder of that. Just make sure to bring plenty of quarters and cash as it's cash only here. *Just a warning, the Final Fight machine ate 50 cents after I tried to continue, so just be wary of that machine.",3,1,2

One of the pinball machines also ate $3.00 worth my boyfriend's quarters without giving us credits to play, and the bartender just kept telling us to ""push the button"" without trying to further assist us with the issue when we complained about it.

The game selection is more diverse and more decades (80s, 90s, modern) are represented. If you're just looking to relive your childhood memories, it's a great place. The only thing that annoys me a bit is that it's pretty weak as a bar. I get that the selection is purposely tacky and limited. Fine. But there's just really no room to do your drinking. You'll spend as much time trying to squeeze by the douchebags who like to stand in the narrow space between the bar and the games as you will drinking your beer.",2,1,2
88,George K.,"San Francisco, CA",607,260,1,4.0,4/11/2016,"This place is cool for what it is . There's a better version in the west 20s or 30s. Dive bar with really old arcade games here - horrible graphics but it's part of the charm. Personally I prefer doing D&B for arcades but this place is fine, too. The good aspects at 2 bits are that it's very easy to get change for the arcades, the staff is super friendly, and there are plenty of games to play with no waiting . Also, one can be amused here for seemingly long periods of time while spending virtually no money. I think I played for 30 min on $2.75 lol",2,,

Street Fighter 2.  Check.  Afterburner.  Check.  Super Sprinter... um.. no idea what that is but... check.  Many of these also cost the retro price of a quarter each to play. Want to play any of the fancy new shiny games that came out in the last decade and costs about the price of a meal for one go?  Well, then you're out of luck.They also carry two pin ball machines, a Foosball table, and have a projection screen lighting a wall in the back with shows and movies with no sounds that no one will watch.  Why?  Because why the hell would you do that when there are so many cool old games to occupy your time with?Drink wise, they carry a selection of beers, wines, and sakes behind the bar.  Food wise, you are stuck with drunk food favorites hot dogs and pizzas for now. Not that it really matters since you'll need those hands to play the games here instead of eating anyway.",4,2,6
92,Sarah B.,"Austin, TX",19,7,4,4.0,5/30/2016,"The bar has a large selection of pin ball machines as well as newer ones like Buck Hunter.

However, when I got here I felt like I was stuck in a dirty, smelly teenagers bedroom. The area is really crammed so your elbowing each other when you're trying to play a game. The arcades are stacked on top of each other so there's literally no space in between. The games and prices weren't bad but the space was tight, dirty, gross. And some of the characters in there looked homeless, and shady. It was just overall a bad vibe. The icing on the cake was when someone farted, crammed no less, we barely finished the second half of our beers and game and just ditched the joint overall and vowed not to ever go back!",1,,

I will keep my own disinterest towards video games out of this review. I came here for my very geeky friend's birthday party. It was actually my idea to come. Yes, I know, I know, I'm a very thoughtful friend. It's cool that they have games like Tetris, Pinball, Frogger, Simpsons, and that boxing glove game. The atmosphere is where it lost stars for me. First, it's a very small space. VERY small. It's a narrow strip of games on the walls. Don't come with an entourage of 10+ people. Second, they need to play up the bar scene to make it more hip. The music, which wasn't even playing when we first got there, was awful. The lack of a fun scene made me miss Barcade. Third, they really mean it when they say ""retro."" You feel like you stepped in a time machine and went back 3 decades. Fourth, the crowd is questionable and super weird. Period.

Imagine a seriously retro arcade you'd see in the late 80s or early 90s full of games like Donkey Kong (I don't remember this being so hard) and Street Fighter II (the left stick is broken here). Games are mostly 25 cents a pop, with pinball being 75 cents a play.It was an interesting experience, and definitely one you should try. But the overall crowdedness and the fact that some of the games were broken kind of turned me off to this place. I might have to try some other barcades sometime!",3,1,1
108,Mannix R.,"Union City, NJ",132,51,173,4.0,7/22/2014,"So I finally managed to make my way to this arcade bar and I was pleasantly surprised that it was exactly what it advertised. It wasn't a bar with some arcade games. It was an arcade with a bar in the back. (You had me at hello!) I quickly busted out the roll of quarters I had been saving for this particular occasion and went to town! First I hit the fighting games. You can't say you were in an arcade and not play Street Fighter 2 or Marvel vs. Capcom in my case. The joystick was a bit off and I couldn't get off most of my moves but I was still kicking ass.I moved over to a couple of shooter games and then the Simpsons game. Not surprisingly, the Bart joystick and buttons weren't working. (I guess back in the day, Bart and not Homer was the star of the show!) All that game play made me thirsty and luckily, the bar did not disappoint when it dispensed some delicious Brooklyn Lager. Unfortunately, what they did lack was some decent whiskey. Apparently, they still have yet to secure their liquor license. So, unless you just love beer or your a fan of sake (the owner actually gave me a free shot of sake in lieu of not having whiskey), this might make you think twice.I wanted to play a Star Wars game they had there but it ate my quarter. (That same owner gave me a free game so I could get back my quarter.) Since that didn't work, I hit my favorite part of the arcade. The pinball machines! Even a lot of places that call themselves arcades seldom have these gems in them anymore. They more than made up for the other disappointments in this establishment.All in all, the fact that the owner/operator was an honest man and that most of the games worked, I gave this place 4 stars and am willing to return with friends. Granted, until they pour me some Irish whiskey whilst I am holding court at one the fighting games (...or if they ever get a Mortal Kombat game in there), they will not receive that 5th star from me.",3,,1

112,Alex K.,"Fremont, CA",161,339,218,3.0,1/27/2013,"I wanted this place to be amazing, but it was just alright for me.First, I'll start with some really great points about this bar. The games are great! They have a good selection of old and older games in the traditional stand up style cabinets and also a few pinball machines in the back. This is definitely a plus over Barcade's exclusively old ass games that mostly you don't want to play. I love to see tetris and street fighter as options here, and pinball is very dear to my heart in an arcade. In fact, all arcades should have a couple pinball machines. Good on you Two Bit. The other great thing about this bar is the organization of drinks on the chalk boards. There's a few chalk boards with a drinks menu. They pretty much have a full bar and a small selection of beers, wines, and other drinks. Genius! Also genius in a business sense, that the beers costs $6.50 encouraging you to play your two quarters in the machines.OK, why does this place get 3 stars. First, one of the bar tenders there was pretty much a grouch to everyone. Maybe she was having a bad day? It's OK, tomorrow will be better. I was there at around 9PM, and they were moving cabinets through this tiny hall of a place. Moving 300 pound machines through a crowd is not smart business sense and is really annoying when you're trying to play video games with your friends. The place is tiny! Do that shit later when you're closed. The people there were definitely a LES crowd, and if you're cool with that great. But I ran into a bunch of Aholes there. CASH ONLY? Half of your business is already cash only, get yourself a iPad and a card reader and BOOM, instant credit card reader.I don't think I'll be making it down here again for drinks, but I did appreciate their little arcade. Maybe come back to drop a buck or two for Frogger and pinball.",,2,

I've been here twice so far, and that's saying a lot for me because it's definitely out of my way & in a neighborhood that I don't typically hang out in. But the prices are fairly cheap for Manhattan and I always have a great time. Their drink selection is a bit limited in the beer & wine department, but they have my favorite Woodchuck cider so I'm good! And their bartenders always have suggestions if they don't have what you're looking for. One negative I will say is they could do a better job cleaning the games; the controls on the games are kinda sticky when you touch them sometimes, which is pretty gross.Most games are 1-3 quarters with the exception of fooseball which is $1. Unlike Barcade, Two bits has vintage games and more modern games, which I love. Best of all, they have my all-time favorite arcade game Hydro Thunder! This game is way more fun now than in high school, especially after 2 or 3 ciders.

We entered the bar which had a decent amount of people and went straight to the bar. The bartender was really cute and friendly, informing us that it was flip-night (or something to that extent) and recommended me a good wine. So even though I had offered to pay for my BF's drink, he ended up calling tails on a flip and ended up getting a free PBR...and the best part is that you can continually go up and flip for a drink. After getting our drinks, we went on to play old-school arcade games ranging from Tetris to pinball, to this weird shooting game. They were all in the range of 24-75 cents. It was awesome!I really enjoyed the fact that it wasn't super crowded and that there weren't lines for the games.

I came here last Sunday around 3 PM and found it to be super empty- which was awesome because that meant no wait for games- Barcade has always been packed and pretty noisy. Two Bit's was more of a dive bar rather than a hipster joint (i.e. barcade), and only admitted patrons over 21 (unlike modern pinball which is all ages). The games were newer than in barcade, but some cost more than a quarter. The pinball machines were 75 cents each, but that wasn't a big of a deal to me because I was just happy to see so many!  None of the barcades have pinball machines, and Two Bit's had about 9! Talk about me being a happy camper!! There was also a full bar with tv screens, which made this convenient to watch the world cup while we played some games. As if that wasn't enough, there was a projector that projected the game on the wall as well! For the pièce de résistance, two bit's played oldies Motown music. All in all, very awesome spot.",,,

131,Joe O.,"Staten Island, NY",0,16,2,3.0,10/19/2015,"Cool place, had a lot of the games i used to play at the arcade all the time as a kid. Ninja turtles, mortal kombat, nba jam, the simpsons. I was only here for a little while, one time, but I'd definitely go back. They only have beer and i think wine, but im good with beer anyway",,,
132,Matt P.,"New York, NY",223,30,0,3.0,6/26/2014,"Came here recently with friends for my birthday. The place perfectly evokes the grungy (though it's clean!), dark atmosphere of 80's arcades. Unfortunately, it's too small - wayyyyy too small. On even moderately busy days, most of the machines will be taken and the place will be swamped. I fully appreciate that this is Manhattan, but after having been to Barcade in Brooklyn, this place pales in comparison.All that being said, if you're looking for a relatively cheap, fun spot to drink and get together with some buddies for nostalgia, you can do much worse than Retro's. Oh, and the bartender was cute and courteous, guess that warrants a mention!",,,
133,Christine S.,"Manhattan, NY",46,165,2,4.0,11/25/2013,"This place is cool! The bf and I rolled in here once while we had time to kill before our reservation at a nearby restaurant and we had so much fun! The drinks were cheap, and most of the games only cost 25 cents, some are more than that, but its worth it. We tried out a few of the games..lets just say, we're not gamers, so we didn't do that well, but it was fun regardless. Definitely brought me back to my childhood. Paperboy!!The space itself is pretty narrow up front, so it can be hard to get by the initial few games if its crowded to get to the back area. The back has a bar, more games (obvi) and some pin ball machines. There are also coin machines there, so you don't have to worry about bringing quarters with you. Fun place! I'll definitely stop by again if I'm in the area.",1,,

Good job two bit's, AVENGERS  pinball game here for $1.00.  Looked and played great, folks. Yeah SF2 though, loved the game for years.  Balrog, Vega and Sagat are some of my favorite characters to choose, of course sometimes Ken and RYU too, throwing all those fireballs in the air, lol.  I mean look at the staying power of a classic game like this-. Ms. Pacman/Galaga is here too, even Afterburner, Karate Champ, MARVEL VS CAPCOM (fucking awesome, loved saying PROTON CANNON, again),  Kung Fu, Maximum Force (Atari Full motion Video from way back).  .I was excited to play Paperboy too, the control handle was very responsive, almost felt new.  Great old school flavor but more 90's good stuff than 1980's. yeah it is LES, but crowd was cool last week especially, not too annoying well at least they didn't get in my way.  I always though Barcade just needed a street fighter or Mortal Kombat for more arcade credibility.  -Last week was here for the evening, got to see some of the Patriots/Ravens game on the back tv wall.  Now there is more of a reason to come to Essex Street.  They have pizza here to eat (plain or Pepperoni) for $2.50 a slice. I was surprised they had 40 oz drinks sold here too, I was like really, why is that 40 just on the counter like that.  There are hot dogs as well, but I didn't see any, maybe they ran out that night.  I saw they had some decent wine options here as well, of course beer too like PBR in the can AND some great other beers.  They have sake also as a drinking option.  They have a graffitti filled bathroom to keep that nostalgia feeling as well.-Great place to visit to spend an hour to so playing mostly 25 cent video games.  Captain America and the Avengers, I need some other people to come here and play with me next time. AMERICA STILL NEEDS YOUR HELP!!!!!!!",3,6,5

136,Keith O.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",46,141,7,4.0,4/1/2013,"Frankly, I don't know how this place is going to survive.  My hope is that it is run by a trust fund baby that wants to run this place as a civic service to the community.  Much of the space is devoted to arcade cabinets that take up a big chunk of the space, and most of them are only two bits to play, except for the pinball machines which are 75 cents which is still a deal.  There is also a foosball table which saw alot of use when I was there.  Since I work in a startup office, I've had my fill of foosball.The bar counter itself is tiny and didn't have too many people sitting on it.  The vast majority of the people were 30 somethings like me who were engrossed in playing games like Paperboy, Donkey Kong, Street Fighter, and Double Dragon.  These are the games that ate up the majority of my allowance back in high school and it was pure joy seeing them again.What I didn't see too much of which scared the shit out of me was that not enough people in my opinion were buying drinks.  As a pure arcade, this place won't survive, it just doesn't have the space nor does it charge enough for its games.  So please, come sober and leave tipsy, with plenty of button mashing in between.  You'll be doing society a favor.",3,2,

140,Tom O.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,544,67,4.0,12/28/2012,"Enter a Paperboy.  Leave a Paperman.A lot of fun to be had here if you're looking for retro games.  The bar has a more than formidable selection of craft beer and wine and is priced right.The overwhelming majority of games only cost .25 cents; so you can play for a long time for not a lot of money, and the games are fun, probably more so if they were mainstays of your youth.I would like to see a more varied selection of games.  How many versions of the Street Fighter series are necessary?  Also, more two player games to make this a better date or hanging with friends spot.  As great as Paperboy and Pac-Man are, they can only be played by one person at a time.  Also, it would be better if more of the games were team multi-player.  When you beat a friend in Street Fighter 2 because they picked Guile instead of M. Bison, their time is up and you're left playing a game by youself; when you wanted to hang out with your friends.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade would be a great addition because it is team multi-player or a few more shooters.Lastly, the music is great.  Pop, punk and rock from the 80s and 90s.  You can't go wrong.  I really enjoyed my time here- it was not crowded on a Wednesday night.",4,4,2

I would love for them to find a way to expand because as it stands right now I think they need a little more seating.  I love playing games, but its also nice to take a break and drink.  Barcade has that down, perhaps this is for more serious gamers who plan on being in front of a machine all night. On a saturday night I found this place not too busy, but active with Edward Scissorhands playing in HD in the background. Bartender was extremely friendly, and didn't pass judgement when I ordered the second slice of pizza.I do hope they plan on adding liqour to their menu, as I feel that is the final touch they need!  I will be back many times over!Try the Blanche beer. You won't be sorry.",2,,
149,Eric W.,"New York, NY",17,89,0,4.0,9/27/2013,"Two Bit offers a low-key, relaxed setting that combines two good things in life - arcade games and alcohol (beer and wine, no liquor license). The selection extends further than the typical paltry Big Game Hunter found in any dumpy bar. Here you have Marvel vs Capcom, Street Fight 2 Rainbow Edition, Captain America, among others. Lots of pinball machines in the back as well. Too bad there's no X-Men, Lethal Enforcers, and/or Bare Knuckle, otherwise this would have gotten 6 stars. The joysticks are in mediocre shape, but most games are a wondrous $0.25 a pop. It's nice to stop by on a random weeknight, grab a beer, and shoot some hadoukens. Snacks and pizza are available as well, although I have not tried the pizza. The crowd levels are not Hell-Square packed, in part because the arcade machines take up space. Fine by me.",,1,

However, the good games seemed to be pretty much spoken for the whole night, such as air hockey and the deer shooter game, but I got down with some tetris, driving, and police academy games. They have a decent selection of beer and wine, but no hard liquors, so don't go here if you want to get cray. The only downfall, which is a big deal for me, is that they're cash only.

Yes there's an odd feeling to having a buzz to playing Arcades that takes you back to the old times, but it's a very cool, nostalgic feeling. Like the other reviewers said, there are little tables inbetween the arcades to put your drinks on which is VERY cool and VERY clutch! I've been to a retro-arcade/bar type place in DC but this one is way better. The Arcades are cool (much better variety), they have some good pinball machines, and the atmosphere is nice, it's not too arcadey, it has a nice bar feel with arcades.

The walls were full of graffiti and stickers, but other than that, it was usable. Like Barcade, you have to be 21 or over and they card.

You could find a fun game to play or wait two minutes for someone to finish their game. I almost had my party at Barcade, but the manager gave me serious attitude when I asked if they could hold a birthday cake while we went to dinner. So I did some searching and found this place. All of my friends say this place beats Barcade by far. We had small cupcakes at the bar: no issues at all. Thank you, Retro Bit's Retro Arcade for making my birthday amazing!",,,

180,Ryan W.,"Houston, TX",39,6,2,3.0,7/19/2014,"OK so it's your typical dive bar and yes they have cheap beer but if you're going for the arcade aspect you might be sorely disappointed. The games are not in great condition. Some don't work at all and other haves issue. Guns that don't even hit on screen, steering wheels that don't work properly. Ladies beware: there is a single shared, unclean restroom.",,,
181,Chris G.,"Vancouver, WA",35,13,1,2.0,2/21/2014,$6.50 for a warm skunky Brooklyn Lager? No thanks. Better off spending the money on pinball. Good classic games! But expect to spend a dollar per play.,,,1
182,Chloe' S.,"KEW GARDEN HL, NY",134,145,0,5.0,12/26/2013,"The thought I kept having while here was, what is NOT to love? A nice bartender? Good movies playing the background? Playing video games tipsy? It's the thrill of being a kid doing something illicit, except legal. You get to giggle because you're a drunk adult in an arcade. I will definitely be back.",,1,
183,Kay G.,"Jamaica, NY",39,12,4,4.0,10/23/2013,"Fun times here. A little pinball action in the back, some fun arcade games and a beer selection. I'll be back",1,,

185,Zach L.,"Jersey City, NJ",493,130,529,4.0,1/3/2014,"Being a kid who grew up in the 90s I appreciated this retro-arcade more than the Barcade in Jersey City. While the Barcade has real retro-arcade games that date back to the 80s, as someone who's in their late 20s, I prefered Street Fighter II, NBA Jam, the Terminator Gun game, etc. in comparison to most of the games I entertained myself with at Barcade.",,,
186,Abby P.,"New York, NY",78,7,0,4.0,7/10/2014,Great place to have a beer and enjoy yourself! Came with a friend and had a blast with the arcade games. Staff was friendly gave us some yummy popcorn to munch on while we played. I'll be going back very soon.,,,
187,Jonathan A.,"Montclair, NJ",109,322,1,3.0,5/1/2013,"Pretty cool place for some drinking and retro gaming... They had all the classic games from my youth.  A little Pacman, Street Fighter, Police Trainer, and Twilight Zone pinball.  The games are priced accordingly as well.  Still 25 or 50 cents to play.  The only downside was that the place was really packed on a Saturday night, so there was very little space move.  Other than that, this place was pretty decent.  I would return if I was in the area.",1,,2
188,David G.,"Manhattan, NY",23,6,1,5.0,3/17/2014,"It's a dive bar. Don't expect anything fancy. It puts all the money into the awesome retro games and drinks. And it shows, in a good way!",,,
189,Alice E.,"Brooklyn, NY",484,787,1,4.0,10/1/2013,A great selection of pinball machines.  On a Monday night pretty quiet.  I can't imagine what a Saturday would be like?  I liked the diversity of machines and games and the crowd was diverse also.,,,
190,Heather S.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,186,8,4.0,1/6/2013,"I hadn't played an arcade game in absolutely forever. This place was clean, cute, served good beer, and most of the games were still just a quarter. The only bad part was I'm still just as bad at Frogger and Donkey Kong as I was the last time I played! :)",1,2,1
191,Lisa L.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",4,83,11,5.0,3/6/2014,"Love this place on a Tuesday! There's a really cool bartender who brings in pizza at night and the music played by the live DJ is always great! Convent location and good vibes. I'll be back. Cheers to you LES, you're starting to get the right idea and it's been refreshing to find a bar that's not douchy in this hood.",,,
192,Vincent K.,"Alpharetta, GA",7,68,3,4.0,1/11/2013,"so after a bite at meatball shop down the street and a sweet tooth fixing at Il Laboratorio del Gelato, the night was still young and i had plenty of change left. Seeing how close we were to two bits and since my friend and i have never been we decided to stop by and see what the fuss was about. walking in first impressions was definitely nostalgia like other posters have said they have a decent selection of games (maximum force, police trainer, after burner, cruisin world, a foosball table. some jetski game, pac man, paperboy, a neo geo machine with 4 games in 1, a popeye game, an older avengers side scroller, marvel vs capcom, street fighter 2, final fight, frogger, spy hunter, arkanoid, karate champ, kung fu hero, and three pinball machines in the back Junk Yard, Avengers, and Theatre of Magic ). as far as game prices, most machines were.25 with the occasional machine at .50 and the avengers pinball machine was $1 i believe. my buddy and i spent about $5 bucks each and it entertained for over 2 hours so i definitely can't complain. I do wish they had a few more machines... it was pretty obvious the games that people didn't play and which were popular... would be nice if they switched the games out after a while, but their selection does cover a pretty wide variety. Outside of the games the staff is pretty friendly and the place itself plays 80's music as well as a projector playing anything from pulp fiction to dune. the atmosphere was pretty easy going, altho it can get a bit crowded. My only con about the place was the beer. After about 30 min being in the arcade got thirsty so i bought a round for my buddy and i... i ended up getting the 2 bits home brew... i was told it was a christmas ale with hints of nutmeg... sounded interesting altho i should've known it was almost 3 weeks after xmas and they still had their christmas ale? well i was right... i did taste the nutmeg and it was pretty good going down but there was a kinda sour after taste. i didn't know if it was just me so questioning my buddy he said the same. We ended up getting a canned guinness later on, it might be better to go with their canned selection (which is pretty vast based on the selection they have on a blackboard). (beers are about $6.50 which isn't bad) overall I'd give this place a 3.5... growing up in the 90's i'd love to have seen a MK machine or house of the dead or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles side scroller or gauntlet legends, but even so their selection and game prices are definitely on point... if it wasn't for the beer issue with their home brew i'd definitely have rated it higher... most likely i'd be back.. happy gaming!",2,,
193,Katherine M.,"Queens Village, NY",104,178,4,5.0,2/25/2013,"Ok....retro arcade games circa 1985, pinball machines, and various other gaming options..plus WINE?!?!?! Where have you been all my life, Two Bit's? This place is fantastic! You can basically come, play a bunch of video games, and sip a very decently priced glass of wine; of which there are many varieties. Down side? There are NONE. We came when it was fairly new so it wasn't crowded and there were plenty of machines to play and lots of room at the bar to drink. I kind of selfishly hope it stays a hidden gem, but a place this awesome will have its reputation spread like wildfire. Ah, well....Sharing is caring!",1,1,
194,Dov W.,"ASTORIA, NY",106,7,0,5.0,11/19/2013,"Cheap beer, retro arcade games, simpsons pinball and punk rock blasting over the speakers is worth 5 stars in my book, any day of the week.",,,
195,kody j.,"Bayside, NY",16,34,0,5.0,11/18/2013,Can anyone confirm (that knows games) if Capcom vs Snk 2 is available there?  It'll be nice to see an arcade game list. =T,,,
196,Adolph L.,"San Antonio, TX",52,9,0,4.0,10/30/2013,Good place to have a drink and play a few rounds of marvel vs capcom. I love this place.,,,
197,Ray S.,"Bronx, NY",3,5,2,4.0,10/21/2013,Beer and video games what more can you ask for all of the games are old school with plenty of pin ball machines it was a blast back in time with street fighter and final fight and the best thing is it is only a quarter,,,
198,Olga P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,143,0,2.0,9/14/2013,"Ugh. This place. Small, crowded, loud. Wanna-be hipsters and yuppies (hard to get away from that in New York but still) pretending they really love arcade games and PBR. They have the pac man on super-fast mode (why?) and the pinball is too expensive. If I wasn't sandwiched on all sides by drunk, sweating bodies maybe I would have enjoyed it more.",,,
199,Patricia S.,"New York, NY",56,527,281,3.0,6/15/2013,"An interesting little bar with loads of arcade games. My friend has his birthday party here, purely for the nostalgia of it. Besides the fact that he now works at a video game production company, him and his coworkers looove it here. For me, it was sort of an ""Eh"" situation. The prices of beer and wine are average. They sell pizza at the bar - they basically order it from the place across the street. It's a good scheme, you pay for the games, pay for drinks, and when you get the munchies, there's pizza. A good place to stop by, but don't try to make a whole night of it.",,,
