1,Jonathan N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",343,86,171,5.0,7/11/2017,"Went in here for the first time tonight 10 minutes before closing. Young gentleman at the front was very polite and nice! For the roasted turkey sandwich with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomatoes-- was very good and a good price! They use Boar Heads meat which is the best!Other items are overpriced, but that's what you get for a local convenient store in West Village.Very pleased with the sandwiches and employees!",,,
2,M B.,"San Francisco, CA",1,37,4,1.0,6/17/2017,"Came in. But. Can't actually order anything. No breakfast items offered, because ""out"".Okay, cool. I'll get a sandwich. Nope. ""Out"". What kind of deli is out of ingredients for a sandwich???? Inexcusable in NYC. He offers a bagel. I'm like screw it, he has no other food to offer.Then. Gives me shit because I have no cash and have a card. The one deli in NYC that can't serve anything on the menu, including sandwiches, gives me shit for trying to buy bagels. Don't waste your time on this place",,,
3,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",786,63,56,5.0,2/20/2017,Best deli in the area. Grab a sub and walk over to Washington square park and enjoy a fresh lunch. Good price for a good large meal. Highly recommend,,,
4,Matt K.,"New York, NY",263,93,22,4.0,6/29/2016,"Sam's is one of the few deli/convenience stores in the heart of proper West Village.  The workers here are exceptionally nice to pretty much anyone who stops by, which contributes to the shop's small town feel. They sell pretty much any small item you could need (from toothpaste, to beer, to sandwiches, to washing detergent), and their breakfast sandwiches are a neighborhood favorite.  Items are slightly overpriced, but that's the price you pay to have a grocery store aside of your West Village apartment/townhouse.All in all, a local staple of a quiet neighborhood.",,,
5,Juliette L.,"Manhattan, NY",137,117,253,4.0,6/16/2015,"It's not a sit down place, it's a mini deli. You get your sandwich and leave. The workers are nice and will make small talk. For groceries such as milk, they are more expensive than the grocery store, but their sandwiches are delicious! Although I can no longer eat them, I wish I could. The roast beef with munster cheese, tomato, and lettuce was the best! The bread is delicious and the meat, cheese and add ons are fresh. They are also speedy with your order. As for tea (I have not had their coffee), it's just Lipton so it's common.I recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick lunch to eat in a park, at home, or at work.",,,
6,Mac H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0,5.0,1/18/2017,"I love this place. The people who work there and the owner are SO nice. I walked in at 330 am after a long night at the hospital with my sick boyfriend and was starving - was so happy to see that he had just opened at 3AM. Told him where I was coming from and he suggested the most perfect snack in the world that just hit the spot, as I was trying to pick something out but just too exhausted to do it. Go in there often and always welcoming and recognize me. Really nice to have that charm right around the corner!",,,
7,Kari S.,"Portland, OR",24,52,33,4.0,4/24/2013,"We were staying in the neighborhood and this was the closest place to us for food and other items. Great and simple salami sandwiches for $7.50 make for an easy meal. We chatted with the guys behind the counter for a bit and they were super nice. Also a nice stock of all sorts of snacks, milk, OTC meds, etc.",,,
8,Leila M.,"North Palm Beach, FL",0,2,0,5.0,6/10/2016,This is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. Not only do they have amazing breakfast sandwiches but they deliver to nearby residents. They are so kind and brought me medicine and water very early in the morning once! I am truly so thankful for Sam and his wonderful deli.,,,
9,barbara b.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,7/8/2015,I love this deli - totally neighborhood in service and size and attention to detail in their delicious sandwiches.  And priced fairly.  And fast delivery.And great blueberry muffins in the morning.,,,
10,Spoonfeeder S.,"New York, NY",5,17,1,5.0,2/15/2015,"Best neighborhood deli and bodega in new york city.  The guys here remember your name, your favorite orders, how you like your coffee, etc.  They are extremely helpful and can pull things out of that store you would never find on your own.  When it comes to breakfast sandwiches and classic deli sandwiches- this place nails it.  The sandwiches are huge!  Its pretty much impossible for a single person to finish one of their famous italian subs.  Its places like this that make new york city one of a kind.",,,
11,Doctor B.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",1,40,3,3.0,1/12/2012,"There are three things you need to know about Sam's:1. homemade soups DAILY.2. homemade SOUPS DAILY.3. HOMEMADE SOUPS DAILY!Got it?!?Sam's is a great little neighbourhood place.  Like all stores of this type you will pay extra for convenience.  If you want cheap beer, this isn't the place.  But their coffee is good and the soups are fantastic.  And in a pinch they have just about anything else you might need on short notice.  They even stock ping pong balls!The guys that run the place are nice and watch out for those of us in the neighbourhood, as well as the neighbourhood itself.Keep up the great work fellas.",2,,1
12,Jen G.,"New York, NY",21,80,1,1.0,6/20/2015,"Wrong order, overcharged us, and then hung up on us. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. We ordered bacon egg and cheeses on a roll. They delivered breakfast platters, not sandwiches. And then they charged us for not a sandwich, not the platter they delivered, but a totally different, more expensive platter. I called to resolve the issue and the owner hung up on me and then wouldn't answer my call. My boyfriend called back from a different number and the owner answered. He said we didn't get what we ordered and we were overcharged. The owner claimed the prices on the menu (which he included in our delivery) were wrong. This is absurd, and he finally agreed to refund us, but in cash. The delivery guy came back and gave us the amount by which they overcharged (still charging us for platters and not sandwiches, though), and said, ""My boss said to tell you to never order from here again."" Don't worry, we won't, and you shouldn't either. There are hundreds of deli in a 1 mile radius that are delicious and have good customer service. And I haven't even gotten to how disgusting the food was.",,,
13,Melissa M.,"Manhattan, NY",120,21,0,5.0,1/19/2014,"My neighborhood deli that's super accommodating! Everyone there is amazing, the selection is great and if they don't have something they go above and beyond to find it like my almond butter, rice milk, gluten free bread, etc. Yummy breakfast sandwiches, home made soups, and they deliver.",,,
14,Adina R.,"Washington, DC",138,144,7,4.0,12/1/2012,"Sam's has everything you need. Toilet paper, check. Bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, check. Batteries, check. Friendly service, check. Overpriced it is, but it's the quintessential local business. Not just open during hurricane sandy, but getting its milk delivery at that time. And you pay for that premium, so I keep going back for my iced coffee and breakfast sandwich. Thanks Sam!",1,,
15,Eddie B.,"New York, NY",84,85,0,4.0,3/9/2013,"Great traditional bodega, probably the best classic Bacon, Egg and Cheese in the West Village.  Great for when you're hungover but don't have time/energy to go out for proper brunch. Also has all the regular bodega necessities.",,,
16,Matt D.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,42,1,3.0,6/26/2013,It's an ok salami sandwich but this is basically a bodega that has a deli inside. No choices of bread (hero or bagel) and just lettuce and tomato on the sandwich. It's good for what it is but don't expect anything special.,,,
17,Milah P.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/12/2014,every thing I need is in this deli. the products are great and cheap. also the people there are soo sweet. they have snacks and bagels and coffee. it's cute and perfect! go support them,,,
18,Gabriel S.,"Santa Monica, CA",214,77,5,4.0,11/5/2009,"In a quartier where even the cupcakes sport designer labels, it's nice to encounter a throwback to the times of honest neighborhood establishments.  Sammy & Co run a solid deli, with delicious sandwiches, delectable cup-a-joe coffee, and every ancillary odd and/or end you may have need of: toothpaste, kitty litter, beer, ammo, Tylenol, and staples.      Nestled snugly between Marc Jacobs and Marc Jacobs, this is a breath of sanity, where the indigent bum loosies side by side with celebrities and famous artists.  The breakfast sandwich is highly recommended.  edit: Unfortunately, the previous corpulent cat named ""Don't touch me when I'm napping"" has gone to the great feline residence in the sky, replaced by a younger more lithe counterpart named ""I only like girls.""",4,6,5
19,Brian S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,11/23/2011,"Excellent deli, super friendly and easygoing employees. They also deliver and are all-around great to have in the neighborhood.",5,,5
