I ordered a sausage, bacon, egg, cheese, home fries, spk on a roll and it costs $9.04 with tax. The cashier insists I had extra bacon. Theyre implying that I had double the standard amount of bacon and extra egg. I didnt. If I wasnt late for work I wouldve given them hell. Communication is bad between the cooks and the cashiers. Its better in the other bodegas where the cook actually price the sandwich before it gets rung up. At most I shoulvde paid $7.50 plus tax for that sandwich. Never coming back here ever.",2,,

I just couldn'tThe service was fast...but the food...that fake meat...they should't serve that!  Just NO!  Anyway, I do want to give this place a chance because this was only one bad experience.

It's an easy walk from the office and they have a variety of options to choose from hot and cold foods with different stations. I personally love the salad bar where you can get a bunch of toppings and they make it and chop it up for you right there. The hot food is also a good choice! I've had the salmon with mashed potatoes and green beans and it was purely delicious. They also have hot and cold sandwiches, pre-made salads for on the go and some bakery treats as well. Oh and the hot soups are also good! I've had the Chicken Noodle and enjoyed it a lot. It's also a lot more reasonably priced then some other places in the city. A large cup of soup is $6.50 and the Salmon combo is $12 or $10-11 for the Chicken. They also offer bread with all the items which is a nice place. The staff here is always welcoming and friendly.

I usually come here to get ceaser salad (4.70 without chicken) which I think is a pretty good deal. (3 dollars more for chicken) Occasionally I would get their entree (usually chicken or salmon) which comes with 2 sides. Their sweet potatoes and cranberries side is good and one of my favorites. I haven't gotten or tried anything else here as it is kinda expensive and you can get better food around the neighborhood for the same price. Not all the staff there are friendly.

They're food is good, but the service I just encountered was incredibly frustrating. I call in advance and I make sure what I order is right, because the people I order for are particular. This time one of the orders, an egg white, turkey, and Swiss on a toasted whole wheat bagel, was very wrong. It came without turkey and on an everything bagel. I called up to let them know that the bagel was not what I ordered. The lady told me she wrote exactly what I said, and that I screwed up. I know I didn't, I remember saying word for word what I wanted. I also remember when I ordered the next bagel, which was also whole wheat, she repeated that one back to me, and said everything bagel. I said, no the last two bagels were both whole wheat. And she said ok. I wouldn't mind the screw up, but to tell me that I screwed up, and that if I want the bagel, I know I ordered, that I would have to order it again and pay for it is incredibly frustrating. I'm extremely disappointed with the service, and I am no longer giving them my business.",,,

It was 8 dollars for a sizeable salad, and you could have anything you wanted on it for no extra charge unless it was extra meat. With some water, the bill ended up being about 12 dollars.

One of them noticed I saw this and told in spanish to the cook to re-do my order and at the same time he lied to my face saying the order was ""almost ready"". When they gave me the sandwich, it had cheese so I just left without any food after waiting for 20m. Today was my third and last time at Teleon, I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, lettuce and tomato and the guy put ONE small piece of tomato in the sandwich, which I think is ridiculous, so I asked him for three and he gave me an attitude.

I've always enjoyed the food, and they have enough of a variety that I never got sick of it. The guys who work the sandwich/hot food/pasta and salad stations are uniformly great.So why the one star? I started noticing a few months ago that the cashier  usually situated nearest the front window had started treating me rather cooly -- suddenly, she could no longer remember that I got the same thing every morning (I'm a creature of habit) but I thought that perhaps I was being a little paranoid -- then, yesterday morning, I counted my change and found it a dollar short. I told her she owed me a dollar and she responded, ""I was keeping that because you never leave me a tip."" It's true -- I don't believe ringing up an order and taking my money constitutes a service that warrants a tip, but I was still a bit taken aback. Reluctantly. she gave me the dollar I was owed and I left.At lunchtime, I came back, as usual. People who work where I do get a 10% discount on the total, but she rang it up and didn't deduct the discount. I said, ""Hey! Where's my discount?""

63,Mia M.,"New York, NY",200,5,0,5.0,6/10/2014,This place is great to order from during lunch! They come on time and their food is always extremely fresh. They also have great salad dressings!,,,
64,Critic L.,"New York, NY",0,73,1,2.0,3/24/2014,"I work across the street and come here pretty often for lunch. I always get the fresh stir fry where you pick the ingredients and they cook it fresh for you. I ask the Cook at the grill for extra garlic and do you know what he tells me? ""I dont got time for you"".. Wow, just wow. I was quite speechless. Perhaps I shouldve told the Runner who puts my chicken and raw vegs in the plate BUT that guy is just the runner and doesnt have garlic in his table of goodies. The Cook is the one who throws in the garlic and oils and seasoning. Really, you're going to tell me ""I dont got time for you"" when you market the station as a customized offering? I dont think I've ever heard a food server say that! Well, thats the last of my money you're going to see...and mind you, we order a lot of catering from them for business meetings. Go down the street to Hestia.",,,
65,Luca S.,"New York, NY",2,11,25,5.0,3/18/2014,"Ok.   Lets just say that we are not early birds when it comes to eating breakfast.  So anytime we are in the area and crave a simple but good & fresh breakfast this has become our go to place.  Breakfast served ALL day.  And unlike alot of other places they dont charge extra after 11.  Another plus is that they can cook the freaking eggs properly.  I am amezed at how many places can't cook an egg correctly. Our favorite guy here is Raul , great personality!",,,
66,Janice L.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,536,697,4.0,4/1/2011,"Teleon chops your salad, yay! It's like a cheaper version of chopt made closer to my school! They're cheaper than guy and gallard, which is only few doors down. Ingredients look fresh and slightly prob $.25 - $.50 cheaper. While the guy tosses your salad, he also asked if I wanted the salad chopped! Yays! (can't deny it though but chop't does a better job than this place since I just had it at midtown yesterday), it's a few bucks cheaper here of course! The place also has create a your own stir fry section, so tempting! Overall, nice cafe, okay price, will probably visit again.",1,1,1
67,Daniel R.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",53,7,0,1.0,12/5/2013,"Had a strawberry banana smoothie, which is hard to mess up. However, this smoothie tasted like water and was awful. While drinking it, something got lodged in my throat that feels like a staple...and it's kind of painful. So...yeah... I don't recommend going here.",,,
68,Emily C.,"New York, NY",63,151,3,3.0,9/17/2010,"The chopped salads here are one of my favorite healthy meals! One of the reasons I don't eat salads more often is that I find it annoying to chew on big pieces of greens (and embarassing to have pieces of greens stuck in between my teeth).  The salads here are custom created from a wide assortment of ingredients and can be chopped so finely that very little chewing is required.  This is particularly helpful when working late and not having the time to eat properly.Unfortunately, in several of my office deliveries, I noticed that they left out several of the ingredients that I had selected and paid for in my Seamlessweb order.  It's unclear whether this is because there were too many ingredients for them to keep track of, or because they figured that I wouldn't notice when everything was chopped up.  It is always very depressing when this happens - I'm alone in my office, buried in documents and feeling neglected by the world, holding on to the hope of a little sustenance to make it through the night, and then realizing that even the salad guy has screwed me over.",1,4,
69,Shawn A.,"New York, NY",6,59,25,4.0,1/18/2014,"They get 4 stars because their service is excellent, from the casher to the guys that takes your order.the food is good. They have variety of stuff on their menu from to choose from including  stir fry to pasta, Sandwich's salads, soup and pastries .If you work in the New York Times building you also get a discount. I'll be back!",,,
70,Susan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0,5.0,12/10/2012,"I eat here for breakfast almost everyday.  Everyone knows my same order, and has it ready for me super fast. They even bring my food to me on a tray, so I can check my emails before work.Number one reason I go there is split between convenience to my subway, and price. But it could be split three ways, since the food is always fresh, and there is rarely ever a wait. The owner is also kind enough to plug in my cell phone for me when I need it.Definitely five stars deserved.",1,,
71,Matthew R.,"New York, NY",43,19,0,4.0,7/11/2013,"Good overall. Salads are wonderful. Pasta was good, but the meatballs leave a lot to be desired. Muffins and coffee and good, too. As are the cookies :-) I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the subpar meatballs!",,,
72,The Krissy I.,"New York, NY",88,79,7,5.0,2/16/2010,"I've lived near this place for 3 years.  I never order anything but breakfast and they are very sweet and kind to me every time I go in.  By now they know me by my order and always make it after verifying I do indeed want that, but they did even a few weeks in from my very first visit.This is a european owned joint, this place was here before dean and deluca across the street - I would recommend this place 100% over D&D. Again, I go for breakfast and even bring my out of towners here. They are always satisfied. They will custom make anything for ya on the grill.My breakfast fav is spinach, swiss cheese on a whole wheat wrap - 3.55....cheaper than hot and crusty round the corner, cheaper than starbucks wrap, cheaper than the place right on my block.They have seating upstairs and downstairs and actually have a flatscreen upstairs for viewing the news in the AM, usually on CNN. before heading to work.  They have hazelnut coffee (i lauve) and when you order for delivery everything is neatly wrapped, and all you need is in a bag. They have never gotten an order wrong, also when sitting down to eat. the music is pleasant. Sometimes I study here!",2,,1
73,DJ C.,"Glen Oaks, NY",25,161,625,4.0,7/21/2010,"Quick made to order breakfast. I usually get a whole wheat toast with turkey sausage, egg white and spinach with mustard. The grill guy remembers your orders after one visit and makes sure you are happy.",,,

75,Alisha B.,"New York, NY",2,11,4,1.0,11/7/2010,"Just ordered pick up at this place. worse service ever. i made an order way in advance so that the food would definitely be ready. i showed up (the place was empty) and the guys just stood behind the counter taking their sweet ass time making convo whatever when my food was on the counter at the cashier. I get home and realized that they didn't give me the sugar that i ordered (it's an option on the app) for my coffee, no straw, didn't give me salt and pepper for the scrambled eggs i ordered. employees who do a half ass job, bad customer service - not going back",,,
76,Dafna L.,"New York, NY",0,37,1,4.0,6/20/2014,"Great spot for breakfast or lunch - egg wrap or quesadilla is large, tasty and pretty affordable ($3.95 or $4.95). Large oatmeal with unlimited toppings is cheap and great. Unlimited topping chopped salad is always good - yes, maybe the 'proteins' are a bit bland, but this is salad, people. And no credit card minimum!",,,
77,Reid G.,"Falls Church, VA",0,13,0,4.0,7/10/2012,"Have only had breakfast here, but it has always been good. You can get a full breakfast pretty quickly for cheap (especially considering the area). I wouldn't go out of my way for the food, but will happily stop by if I'm in the neighborhood.",,,
78,Sherri J.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,105,30,4.0,3/4/2009,"For the first year that I worked in the the New York Times Building, this was my standard go-to lunch place, since it's right across the street and it's pretty slim pickin's in this neck of the woods when it comes to decent places to grab lunch.  You can only eat at one place so many times before you grow tired of it, so I've started to venture out more, but that doesn't mean it's not a good lunch spot.  Teleon also does the majority of the catering for our office, so I'm also very familiar with their catering selections.  It's your standard deli with sandwiches, soup, chopped salad station, pre-made salads, stir-fry station, hot entrees, pizzas, desserts, snacks and beverages. The food is good, but nothing terribly special (but who goes to a deli for something ""special,"" right?).  My two favorites are the black bean cilantro soup (AWESOME) and the stir-fry (pick your own meat, veggies and sauce) which is served with brown rice. I think Teleon really shines when it comes to breakfast, though. They are always packed, but the guys at the grill work with amazing efficiency. I don't even have to order anymore, because the guys know what my ""usual"" is (sausage, egg & cheese on a toasted sesame bagel), and they just confirm that I want my usual and start making it. The bagels are delicious and the perfect combination of crispy and chewy. The sausage is really good as well (a lot of delis REALLY fail when it comes to a simple sausage patty).  I'd get breakfast here every day if my waistline could afford it. I occasionally get the egg, spinach & feta wrap, which is also very good.It's a pretty solid place to grab lunch and an even better place to grab breakfast.",6,3,5
79,Klaus K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,25,0,3.0,8/4/2009,"A decent place. I once had a dead bee in my salad, but they let me exchange it for anything I wanted (i of course took double the value of the original salad) and were very apologetic about it which i didn't expect.The gazpacho is very good here and a small is very filling. quite spicy though, so not for everyone.",1,,
80,Jina K.,"New York, NY",5,21,0,4.0,4/6/2011,"I found Teleon thanks to a lazy New York Times food critic who proclaimed it the ""best"" place for a breakfast egg & cheese on bagel sandwich. SInce the NYTimes building is directly across the street, I figured the critic was judging based on location, location, location. But since I'm nearby too (and I love egg & cheese sandwiches), I gave Teleon a try. The sandwich is really good! The cheese was very melty and the bagel totally crisp. And the best part: They're one of the few places that will make you an egg sandwich after 11am. You'll pay an extra dollar for it, but when you're craving an egg & cheese around noon or later, it's completely worth it!",1,1,1
81,Becky O.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,110,16,4.0,12/26/2010,"Worked close to this place and was pleasantly surprised. Good quality food at a great price (esp. if you are eating a higher protein diet--their grill is fab...pick salmon, beef, chicken or whatever protein + 2 sides (many veggies to choose from) and you're set!). I am now moving to NYC and literally had to hit ""next, next"" 42 times to find this place bc I couldn't remember the name. That's how much I liked it! Great find.",1,1,1

83,Dexter M.,"Hackensack, NJ",13,78,14,4.0,12/16/2009,"I was a construction worker in the New York Times building, across the street. Teleon was in the right place at the right time! It's also next to Port Authority, so if you get off the bus, head on over for a quick bite. I highly suggest getting a toasted corn muffin with butter and jelly. It's the tops! Their service is fast and the workers are polite. Complete with two floors and three private bathrooms, you can enjoy your meal while forgetting you're in the city.",2,,2
84,Andrew R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,4.0,1/21/2011,I order lunch here since it's near my work. The soups are always very good and very fresh. I've only gotten fish because I don't eat other meats but they have always cooked the fish well and it's never not overcooked or dried out.,,,
85,Jackie N.,"Chicago, IL",98,282,4,3.0,3/14/2010,"This place is okay with its standard deli fare. The salads are usually fresh but the price is pretty steep. $8 for a for a cold falafel salad is way too much when you can go one block down to Maoz for a *warm* falafel salad which is yummier and cheaper. However, our office orders from here often and their veggie wraps are pretty good. The sweets, however, are to die for. Someone gave me a cupcake from here,  and I almost passed out from sugar shock!",,,
86,Jimmy R.,"Conway, AR",54,42,5,4.0,5/23/2010,Great spot. Good food. Fast service. Not much else to say. I only had breakfast here but looking at the menu I would guess lunch would be just as good.,,,

My top choices....chicken tortilla soup (only Mondays), Arizona chicken sandwich, Los Cabos sandwich, and the oh so delicious turkey, bacon, guacamole panini. The bagels aren't so bad either. My early Bird co-workers al recommend the oatmeal. Only 4 stars because you're guaranteed to spend at least 8 bucks for lunch.",,,
88,Frankie D.,"New York, NY",118,293,0,3.0,4/21/2009,"Very wide selection for lunch, but I stopped in for an overpriced, mediocre breakfast sandwich that left me longing for my cow orker's Egg McMuffin.",,,

I tend to get the entree special--usually a delicious play on salmon--with two sides. You can pick what you like and the portions are generous. And it only runs you about $8! The sandwich and salad bars are standard, but always good. And the staff is very pleasant. Highly recommend this spot as a reliable lunch pick in Midtown west.",,,
