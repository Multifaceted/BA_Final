0,Pamela J.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",88,823,744,4.0,7/10/2018,"3-4 stars for vegan dessert selection.Craved vegan desert and typed that into Yelp and Atlas was the closest to me.  How many times have I walked by this unassuming place and would have never ventured in otherwise.  Isn't it funny how that happens?Well, the entire case of desserts are vegan - something for every taste - the guy (probably owner?) told me they've offered these desserts for something like 12 years already, so not newbies on the vegan fad train.Loved my Death by Chocolate cake - it totally hit the spot - and enjoyed it while sitting out on the patio watching the music videos playing inside.Will be back to try more items.  No frills and a very comfortable place.",1,,1
1,Mike P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",362,137,13,1.0,11/8/2018,"Probably one of my least favorite places in all of downtown. 3x have I ordered food, all different items, all extremely inedible. Eggs are more like eggs au poive - the pasta is always over cooked and over salted - they don't know how to make a bagel. Just overall a terrible execute. So many other options that make better quality food and know how to season properly.",,,

If you're a vegan, you will only love this place more.The owner is a true gem in NYC. He always goes out of his way to accommodate. You can tell he does what he does because he loves it- it's never about the money with him.Even after not going here for a while, I was welcomed back with a big smile.

The coffee's pretty good as well, they have a full coffee bar, the WiFi is fast and they don't scold you for sitting and working for a while as long as it's not super busy, which it usually isn't early in the morning. I especially appreciate the non pushy workers/atmosphere and early 2000s pop music they play. The seating area is fairly small but it's got a nice vibe and lots of sun. Definitely would recommend.",,,

Rows of delicious cakes like peanut butter bomb, oreo cake, walnut cheesecake....and even more vegan goodies such as cannoli, assorted cupcakes, and brownies! Even though their menu is mostly vegan / vegetarian, all of their baked goods are vegan which is a huge plus. Lunch or dinner here is inexpensive, but the prices for desserts are off the charts, literally! A slice of heaven aka ""oreo cake"" will you set back a mere $8.00, yikes!",10,5,5
10,Christina M.,"North Bergen, NJ",142,15,7,1.0,10/14/2017,"First order was great, vegan gluten free pizza. Second order was the personal mozzarella pizza with vegan/gluten free crust, listed under Vegan and Gluten Free pizzas. Order came and had real cheese on it (I'm allergic to gluten and eggs, and am a vegan). I called and they said that's what I ordered and as I tried to explain that I ordered the one under the Vegan section, the guy just said check your email it's the same as what they have, then as I continued to try and explain it he just hung up  :/ Not ordering from this place again. The pizza went to waste. And if you do order, don't assume that what's listed under Vegan is actually vegan. Even if it's listed under vegan and said in the description it has a vegan crust",,,

They offer everything from breakfast, to pizza, to sandwiches, to pasta, to dessert: you name it. The best part is: EVERYTHING is good. I cannot rave enough about the food. The place itself is cozy and inviting. It is small which makes it feel homey. The workers are foreign and so fun to talk to. Take my advice and go have one of the best meals your have ever had.",,,

16,Em S.,"Brooklyn, NY",268,37,28,2.0,7/18/2016,"As a native New Yorker and vegetarian, I've been going to this cafe since they opened. I appreciate their menu, which includes many vegan and gluten free choices. I'm overall glad that they are still around, but they recently changed owners and unfortunately the food and service are hit or miss. It used to be one of those places where the owner always recognized you and chatted it up. Food was always fresh--you can pretty much expect a fresh tasty salad from most veggie-focused cafes, right?Recently I went on a hot summer day. They weren't air conditioned and the guy seemed rightfully stressed out, but insisted I sit to eat. I ordered the Tunisian Vegan Chicken salad since it was too hot to eat anything warmer than salad. Out came my ""salad"", a strange fluorescent concoction-- from what my taste buds told me, a bed of wilted, hot mesclun greens with bright orange tomato based sauce and a few vegan chicken strips (the kind you can buy at Mahwah in Chinatown). I swallowed it down but it wasn't pleasant. Since I'd ordered ""salad"" I'd been hoping for something with a few more fresh veggies and, well, not piping hot. I still can't figure out where the fluorescent orange color came from, but I'll leave that up to you to decide!A party of 8 came in while I was eating and even though the cafe is too small for a big group, he rushed to accommodate them. The temperature inside rose with all of our body heat. I waited until the party of 8 was served and went up to the counter to pay. Even though I was first in line, it took actively waving him down for 15 minutes to get one of the three guys in the back to take my money. It was hot in there and I had somewhere to be. Suffice to say, once I forget this weird food experience I'll probably go back again for old time sake. I just hope they read this and put a little more thought into their food quality and service. We vegetarians like fresh veggies in our salad, it's true!",2,,
17,Stuart B.,"New York, NY",1179,586,39,3.0,12/6/2016,Small cafe in the east village.  It has about 8 tables.  Wide array of cafe like things.  Good service.  Good prices.  Nothing else that came to mind as we were there that made this place stand out.  There are a few off Broadway theaters in the area so this place serves well to kill time before the curtain goes up.,3,2,3

I ordered something called beef bacon and eggs, and received something I had to dump in the trash. Mushy soggy eggs, a gross concoction of bad tasting cheese and wilted vegetables, and sad little 'salad' that consisted of soggy greens and way too many old carrot shavings.

Updated review","Admittedly, I only go here for Vegan Treats pastries anymore, and those are delivered from Bethlehem, PA on Tuesdays. Atlas still has an impressive assortment of Vegan Treats at all times of the week.I went--on an impulse--to get a slice of the Death By Chocolate cake to go. I had been having a bad day; it was cold and rainy and I had been walking outdoors for most of the afternoon, so I reasoned that I deserved it!So I went in and asked for the Death By Chocolate--an impressive multi-layer chocolate cake with gold leaf. As soon as the man handed me the clamshell and I was going to go, I suspected it was smaller than usual; Atlas Café had always given a huge slice of cake--so big that if I was taking it home, I wouldn't eat it all at once; I'd cut it and eat it in halves. I got it home and found this was true: they gave me a piece that was probably a half to two-thirds the size of their former slice. But that's not the worst part! The cake was stale and made me want to cry. I mean, the frosting was predictably good, but it was as if it had been slapped on chocolate Styrofoam. This means the restaurant is doing something funky with their cakes--and possibly all their food handling, but I haven't tried their other food since their new management took over. The previous owners got their Vegan Treats delivery on Tuesdays and froze a large part of it, thawing the cakes and pastries over the course of a week so that they'd be fresh when they were served; the new owners are apparently not doing that the same way if sawdusty cakes like this are the result.I'm sorry to say they blew their last chance with me; I understand they must have a huge rent to pay for the tiny space they're in, and the restaurant business is tough in general--moreso in NYC--but get your act together, kids. I'm certain I'm not the only customer who's given up on you.",6,2,

Updated review","Atlas is my go-to with special feelings.  Perfect for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores.  Some dishes have Mediterranean vibes (shakshouka, Moroccan salads & sandwiches) and some dishes have an ultra-healthy slant (salads, shakes, tofu scrambles), but the menu is so expansive there's something for everyone.My go-to dishes are any of their above-mentioned tofu scrambles, soups, quinoa salad, surprisingly delicious ravioli, and OMG their desserts - all vegan and ridiculously delicious.  Espresso is solid.Seating is very limited, but stop by in the late afternoon/early evening and you'll get a table.  Stay a while and fall in love with the og east village...",1,,
22,TJ R.,"New York, NY",221,162,791,3.0,10/14/2014,"After taking a hip hop class nearby at Exile Professional Gym, my friend and I were hungry. We wanted something light and healthy. Walking by we saw they offered gluten-free and vegan options. I try to maintain a gluten-free diet, it helps with my digestive system, and vegan for me cause it's meatless Monday. It's a small restaurant, the menu is on the wall. The menu has crepes, sandwiches, soups, salads, and smoothies, no I don't have a thisp now. They offer Moroccan food with a healthy earthy crunchy twist. I ordered a vegan chicken (soy based) Moroccan sandwich with a Harira soup (chickpea) combo total was about $9.My friend had the Cubano chicken sandwich with the same soup combo. He looked like he was inspecting his sandwich frequently. That's on him to tell us why :PNot a bad deal, taste was okay. The sandwich was a bit small, with a soy patty in the middle and a bunch of tomato sauce (supposed to be harissa, which is super spicy, I didn't mind though) surrounding it. My thought afterward was that it wasn't bad but I wouldn't run back.The harira soup look like their own creation (all of their soups are vegetarian), it had little pasta lentils chick peas, it was alright. My friend commented that it felt unfresh or that it was from a can or something, it had that Campbells vibe to it.  The health rating on the outside was pending, which was explained when I went to the dark little bathroom and was greeted by small flies. ""Hey welcome to the bathroom"", ""oh thank you!"". Yeah they shouldn't be there. I dig what they are offering but I think they need an overhaul.Real score is a 2.5",1,1,
23,Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3921,6684,28873,4.0,6/16/2015,"The Atlast Cafe has the slowest service in Manhattan. Luckily this is not that place.The very first time I came to Manhattan for a food tour (which was a couple of years ago now), this was one of the very first places I stopped. I came because it is supposed to have an excellent Lox & Cream Cheese Bagel, and it was very good indeed.Unfortunately I wasn't yet schooled in how NYC does Bagels, so I didn't realize that for the true miracles of the Bagel world I'd have to go to Manhattan places like Murray's, Ess-A-Bagel and Brooklyn Bagel, as well as Baker's Dozen in Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bagel in Queens. But for a ""first attempt"" at a bagel this was good. The bagel itself was excellent. The cream cheese was standard, and the lox were fresh and smoky and salty and delicious.It didn't rock my world enough to finish the whole thing (I had plenty of other things to eat), and my travelling companion wasn't impressed (she loves bagels but doesn't like cream cheese), so I'll give it a healthy 4 but with the option to raise it to 5 once I give it another try.And if it was the At-full-mast Cafe then I'd have gone here a little... excited, down below. But I didn't. It was hot, humid, and heavy traffic in Manhattan, so I just gulped down my lox and got the hell out of there. I mean I was such a virgin in those days. I hadn't even tried Sammy's Halal of Queens yet. (gasps) (groans)Speaking of gasps and groans, are you free tonight? I'm like an Atlas Cafe. I specialize in around the world and will give you something hot to drink.",13,11,13

I walked in and did not get acknowledged right away by the wait staff. The cook in the back assisted me... Which was nice, very proactive. I was only coming by for a light snack so I thought a smoothie would do. I ordered the mango madness and boy did it drive me crazy. I'm not sure who made it but I essentially received a banana skim milk slushy. The taste of strawberries and mangoes were barely present. I wouldn't have known it was in there if the description didn't say so otherwise. Suggestion to add more strawberries and mangoes!!!",1,,

What really drew me here was the selection of desserts from Vegan Treats.  That does not disappoint!  Best selection anywhere in NYC. Sticky buns (pecans!), cookies, whoopie pies, brownies, donuts, cake, cupcakes- they have a selection your mouth will appreciate.As for other food, crepes and their vegan Moroccan chicken are my favorite choices. Vegans can also order soft serve and cream cheese on bagels, pancakes and lattes with nondairy milk (rice, almond and soy), smoothies, salads, wraps, soups and other entrees.  The prices are great for what you get.The stars are for the Vegan Treat and vegan menu choices, but it's not anything avant garde or unique beyond measure.

I have olive skin, am from a mixed race, and I told him I was born here. He continued to speak Spanish to me. I told him I am probably more like where he was from. Then came the rudest anti-Semite response I ever reviewed.

I sat down at one of the tables and then realized I was sitting between two women on their cell phones. I was bombarded with ridiculous pieces of their conversations while trying to read. To top it off, the chick on my left was chowing down will speaking so I assume her phone was an amalgamation of food bits and saliva.

Lets start with the food: It was terrible. I blame the server and the kitchen. I ordered the mozzarella eggs. I asked for them soft they were overcooked. My coffee was burnt and I didn't finish my meal or my coffee they were both nasty. It got worse.Heres where shit went craze. My friend ordered a chicken parm sandwich. The cutlet was raw. We complained. The server apologized and offered to cook it more. My friend declined the raw cutlet had ruined his appetite he left the sandwich alone one bite into it. The server then wrapped the other half of the uncooked sandwich and gave it to us to go. My friend had literally had one bite of his sandwich. We got charged for it. Not cool at all.It gets wore if its possible: I ordered Granola. I asked for honey. Instead of putting a bottle of honey the server came out with a mega industrial  bottle of honey. He then proceeded to douse my granola with honey making it uneatable for me. I complained about the sandwich and when we got the check I suggested it should be taken off from the check. The server told me no he had eaten the sandwich which was a lie. The server also was outside smoking for most of the meal not caring about his customers. We paid the check and I told him he was losing a customer and that I would never eat here again. He scoffed at this notion. I will say this:The food is terribleThe service stinksI hoped this place had recovered from its closing for being dirty a few years ago. It hasn't.Do yourself a favor go to Moonstruck across the street this place is the worst. Good luck staying open.,1,,

It was some vegan cream cheese with some meat alternative between two sad slices of bread that weren't even toasted. It was very small too, and I really did not enjoy it or feel satisfied after eating it. It was also like $8-9 for that little thing, which was totally not worth it. The place is also very small, which is fine, but the owner (?) is sitting there watching tv, which is also fine, but it feels very awkward when you're the only person there and it seems like he's watching you.

Basic vegan items that a lot of vegan places offer. They could be good could be bad. I walk in and immediately was greeted by a friendly server who seated me and was very attentive. He seemed very eager to help me make the right decision. Although I originally wanted the philly steak, I settled for the vegan chicken crepes. (Something I would never have imagined would have been able to be prepared vegan). The food was spectacular. 5 stars. Tasted so fresh, and the chicken had so much flavor. The mozzarella cheese was so creamy. The crepe was the best I've had. Vegan or non vegan. For the price I was blown away. Good service and good eating. Nothing stopping me from stopping by again.Overall, what I look for is unique food that is prepared in a way that bursts with flavor. This is exactly what I found in this boutique vegan cafe. I've been to a lot and I can say safely that this is one you want to taste and reminisce on. Environment didn't feel overly snooty or pretentious. Just a fun place to stop in and have a good time and a great meal.",1,,

I suppose if I were vegan I would feel differently about the place, because they really did have a lot of options.Mostly I was disappointed with the wait. It took forever and there was NO ONE else there. Which is fortunate because had another person been there, it would have been crowded :)But also I asked for bacon on my sandwich-- I don't even know for sure that they have it,  but I really think that type of thing should be clarified before giving someone turkey bacon. I still would have happily ordered it, but you can't just switch up bacon on a girl like that. I respect your vegan-ness, why the pork hate?? Ok I'm taking this too far. But anyway, the reason I didn't just ask is because the man working there wasn't particularly friendly. Not rude, but not inviting questions either.Anyway the sandwich was actually pretty tasty but I'd rather go somewhere quicker... with bacon.",,,

The stumpy, short,  bald guy working the register tells me the sandwich is ready and I tell him, ""Give me a minute,"" as I pack up.The stumpy guy chucks the bag on my table and tells me, ""You say you want to go and it's to go and now you tell me a minute. And your headphones on!""I needed at least a minute to pack up the grading I had laid out outside on a New York City sidewalk, so that's the reason why I asked for a minute. I can see that headphones may have been annoying if he didn't see I was listening to something, but I have bright green, ear muff sized head phones, so he saw that my ears were occupied.I calmly came up to pay at the register and told him, ""You didn't have to speak to me in that tone. I needed a minute to get my things together.""The bald man continued to yell and sarcastically apologized, as the entire restaurant stared at his rant towards me. I felt like a child being scolded by an angry parent who had a long day at work and needed to take some anger off his chest.I have never been spoken to so rudely before, nor have I had such a negative customer service interaction. Maybe he was having a bad day, but from now on, I'll make sure that I'm never spoken to like that again.What's unfortunate is that I actually really enjoy the food. So, if you don't care about customer service at all, go to Atlas Cafe, where you can get tasty food and the customer service is extremely rude.I was so baffled by the workers demeanor that I couldn't eat my food happily.

The bagels are better than most of the other cafes within a 6 block radius and you can get a variety of toppings.The reasons I lowered the overall rating is due to customer service and ambiance. The wait for an iced coffee and toasted bagel is usually 10+ minutes even when there seems to be only one person ahead. On a few occasions the cashiers that are working haven't been trained well on how to make espresso drinks so it takes longer. If you're looking for a rustic, no-frills place to set up your laptop and study this place is probably a good fit. I find it to be a bit lacking in personality so I usually take my food to go.

I've tried their vegan chicken, ravioli, pancakes and sandwiches...I've yet to be disappointed. The service is usually good, but there were a few times where service was rushed.

It is not as rich, but very smooth with the same kind of satisfaction. I was going to give this place 4 stars, but then Cheb Khaled's ""Aicha"" came on while I was enjoying my slice and well the rest is history. That is probably one of the most famous songs throughout the Middle East and North Africa.

She is so defensive and stingy with every condiment that it is laughable.  I ordered a bagel and cream cheese and the bagel was fine, and the amount of cream cheese she gave me was MAYBE a teaspoon full on the side of the plate.  When I asked for more, she said ""You use too much!"" and with 3 people in the restaurant acts as if she is serving 150 people.The older man is a crotchety old asshole.  He served me an avocado (on my salad) that was literally the consistency of an uncooked carrot. The avocado snapped in half when bent, like a carrot. When I gently brought this to his attention, instead of just saying, oops I'm sorry, let me get you another avocado, or another vegetable...he fought/yelled at me loudly and that I didn't know what an avocado was supposed to be like.  Last I checked avocados aren't known for their crunch appeal.  He then charged me over the price on the menu for what I ordered and extra for the avocado that was inedible.  I want to like this place so badly, I love supporting small businesses, and it would be my go-to joint if the staff weren't right out of a sad cliche of un-accomidating servers.",1,1,

Because the baristas ARE European, and not the typical Brooklyn hipsters. I'm sorry, I kind of like it when my baristas are talking in a thick Hungarian accent about things like how excited they are to see their husbands instead of listening to some hipster complain about how she's paying $3,000 a month to live in a bathtub in Bushwick, as she jerks off the steam wand of the espresso machine after making my cappuccino. I like this place. Coffee is phenomenal; the huge, wall-wide map gives you something to look at other than Gchat; and there are genuine spelling errors on all the signs.

As more and more people come by to grab their coffee, it becomes less so. But judging by the crowd, the coffee must be very good (I don't drink it). I do however, eat lots of things.

It might not be as transcendent as the Russ & Daughters version a few blocks away, but it's only $6.75, and it comes with cream cheese, tomatoes, capers, (onions are pickled if you ask for them), and a seat in a cafe with pleasant classical music playing. As you eat you can zone out and dream about traveling the world as you stare at the huge map on the wall. That's a good morning to me.",7,6,6

For the past three years, I've attempted to go to Atlas for breakfast -- and each of those years they weren't open on time. I just walk in the door to discover someone sweeping, lights out, and a ""not open come back in 45 minutes"" nihilistic response. You know what? Fuck you. I've wasted my time, three times, trekking to that pile of crap in hopes that they might be the least bit punctual. Third time was a charm -- no more. Raise your opening hour to 9 or let go of your unpunctual staff, Atlas. Your hours are posted as 8AM-?? all over the web.I have consumed their offerings in the past, for lunch. There's much better in New York.Oh, people rave about their desserts. Well, they're made by Vegan Treats. You can get them at many other locations in the city (goo.gl/maps/XaX8R).Sorry Atlas: I don't like leaving 1 star reviews, but the last time I spent 30 minutes walking and subwaying (on a bum knee) to your location for breakfast only to be treated like an inconvenience was enough.

It reminds me of a cafe I used to habituate on rue Keller in Paris. Coffee's good, people are nice, one can write, or better yet read a book from their small and extraordinarily well curated library.The only problem is the beauty of the clientele. It can be shocking.

I sat down and ordered the food, and half way through I felt something poking against my shirt, I felt the back of the chair and there was a nail slightly sticking out of it. I mention it to the manager ( don;t know his name ), he comes over and looks at the nail then takes it to the back and gives me another chair. I continue eating the food, 20 minutes later I noticed there is a small thread sticking out of my shirt, I feel it and realize it was from the nail sticking out. So I tell the manager( same guy who just took away the defective chair) that my shirt is slightly damaged from that chair. and he just dismissed me with hands and saying "" no there is no problem"", so I show him the shirt and he starts saying things like ""oh this a 2 dollar shirt"" and saying he had people sitting on chairs and never had any problems. I remind that him that less than 20 minutes ago I showed him the chair with a nail sticking from it, and he just straight up denies this!! Basically lying to me in my face. He didn't even bother to apologize about the incident or anything. So I ask him toBring out that defective chair ( which he is blatantly just lying about ) and after 5 minutes of back and forth he decides to get it out, and I show him the nail, and I recorded that on video ( will upload to YouTube and paste link here). The manager / owner just starts haggling and saying my shirt is not worth a lot of money, at the end I told him I am not interested in his money but at least he should apologize and say sorry about the whole incident.Anyway the end result is me walking out.

I was excited about the Vegetarian Philly Cheesesteak- the native Philadelphian in me requires I order this any time it is on a menu. I knew it wasn't going to be a seitan cheesesteak from a Philadelphia establishment but I thought it would at least be edible. Each ingredient seemed to be of the poorest quality and came cold. The shredded cheese, extremely soft (not grilled or even warmed) seitan and the thin ""baguette"" were very unappetizing.

The menu is very vegan and vegetarian friendly to the extent that Atlas Cafe could be classified as a vegan restaurant but they have non-vegan choices too. A great option for omnivores and herbivores to eat together.

As a vegetarian, it's hard to find a place that even my meat-lovin' friends will like. Atlas has a crazy extensive menu with options for the meat-eaters and veg-heads alike. My favorite sandwich is the ""Vegan Ginger Chicken Cubano."" Unlike most vegetarian or vegan restaurants, their fake meat is actually delicious. The texture of their fake chicken is perfect. I'm also a huge fan of their homemade vegan soups. So hearty and spicy! A huge bowl with a side of wholegrain bread is $4.25. That is about the same, if not a little less, than what I would pay for a small can of watery, sodium-filled soup from the grocery store. The best deal though has got to be the breakfast. Their are amazing egg dishes for $5.75 (they come with a small side salad and bagel) and the vegan scrambles are to die for. Finally, tofu done right! Other not to skip items include the pick-your-own salad, huge dessert case, and specialty coffee drinks. Nothing here is over $10. The atmosphere is super cozy.

Anyways, I ordered a Spicy Tuna sandwich. It was about $8, but it was huge! The Sandwich itself was pretty good, but I made a mistake by asking for it to be spicy; the ""spicy"" sauce that they put on it tastes--how do I put this nicely?-- Gross. I don't know how to explain it, but it has a very strong (not spicy) raw/dirt-ish taste. So, all in all, the place was great (we sat outside), the food was pretty good (except the sauce of course), and the price was decent.

Unfortunately we were heading there a couple of days after the weekly delivery so hot items (like donuts and cinnamon buns) were already gone gone gone.Sadness.It was a little awkward trying to browse the dessert & cake display, seeing as there's cafe tables right up next to it, so the ordering process was somewhat confused because of that (and somewhat distracted and aloof cashier/servers) - plus add in the overwhelming selection even despite some things selling out, and it was tough! The vegan soft serve caught my eye, so I grabbed a serving of that with oreos added in - it was delicious and sweet, but could've been creamier. I then tried a red velvet cupcake which was delicious but just a little dry. I tried my friend's peanut butter bomb brownie & was immediately jealous!I wish i'd had time (and space in my stomach) to stay and try some of Atlas' own menu, rather than just feasting on pre-made stuff they order in.

Service is poor, with staff chatting behind the counter for several minutes before serving.  Coffee (mine's a regular cappuccino) is pretty bog-standard and the atmosphere is drab, with a kind of ""don't care"" attitude.Lighting is dull, decoration is basic and tired and the place is covered in 'warning' signs about groups of 4 or more, no dogs allowed etc. Off-putting when you just want a relaxing coffee. As a result there's plenty of seating available and the Wi-Fi is free, which always helps. Perhaps this is more of a 'duck-in' place for locals to grab a coffee on the go. Sit-down clientele seems to be predominately young students from local schools and people who don't know better. God love them.

Something about the crowdedness of the space, and the sheer number of words chalked onto the menu doesnt come across as messy or cluttered, just endearing.

Instead I opted for the soup and salad combo, which is more expensive than before, with smaller portions. The butternut squash soup, a previous favorite of mine, while still good, was barely lukewarm. The Tunisian chicken salad was a sad, sorry mess of a few mesclun leaves, and a sloppy pile of tough, gamey chicken drenched with some sort of red pepper puree which leaked in the to-go bag they gave me. All in all a waste of $9.75 and a sad loss of a once solid little East Village lunch spot.",,,
137,Hailey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,1.0,2/5/2012,"Eh. Nothing too stand-out about this place, besides the fact that they gave my friend CHICKEN on his vegan sandwich. Server reassured my friend it was faux meat when my friend questioned it, but when the rest of the group's vegan sandwiches came out with vegan chicken on them, it was clear my friend's sandwich was the real deal. Awkward semi-apology followed, with an offer for free vegan cake. Still, my friend had to pay for his chicken sandwich and ended up accidentally eating meat after not eating it for a very long time.Sandwich I had was okay, nothing special.I hate to be obnoxious, but I just wish a place that caters to vegans would be a lot more careful not to put meat on a vegan sandwich. I know people make mistakes, but that's a pretty significant mistake, and was just magnified by the fact that my friend questioned it and got wrong information. :(",5,1,

Maybe?You have to love the line and the tight space inside the café. I will give this place mad props for having super sweet outdoor seating. About 10 people can sit outside.I ordered the vegan chicken artichoke sandwich. It was decent fake chicken - some bites were more seasoned than others. Also, it had only three artichoke hearts inside.

I was able to make it an egg white omelet at no extra charge (a major plus in my book). This place probably won't blow you away with their food, but you'll fill up and it won't cost you much. The atmosphere is nice, and the server was helpful when we asked for suggestions.If you're looking for a filling meal that won't break the bank, this place is is definitely one to consider.

Honestly it's a little confusing finding this place via yelp due to the myriad of other cafes with the same name. But after you get passed that, this place is a true find. This has to have the best/most options for a vegetarian breakfast. Scrambled eggs/tofu with tons of veggies, shakes/smothies and plenty of other baked goods and coffee. I can't speak to the coffee, but the baked goods come from the famous Vegan Bakery in Pennsylvania. The same one that serves several other local spots that cater to vegans. I came here for lunch the first time and got the morracan chicken panning. Along with a simple salad and soup, this was an amazing value at under 10 bucks. Healthy and filling. The perfect fuel for a hard afternoon of work. My 2nd experience here rounded out a sugar binge in the East Side. After a truly disappointing Momofuku Milk Bar desert, this place totally saved the day with the tofu soft serve. I have never had soft serve like this. Not because it was tofu based, but because your toppings are actually folded into the soft serve inside the machine! The banana topping I ordered actually turned the vanilla soft serve into an amazing milky banana ice cream mix. The taste was clean and light.There are a few things to complain about with Atlas as others have outlined, but when it comes down to it, this is a must visit for vegan/vegetarians in NYC if only for some sugary treats.",1,,

Menu has a huge variety of vegetarian, vegan and meat options - so there really is something for everyone! And all at very reasonable prices. Service is speedy and pleasant, and they're open to modifying to meet your preferences. I went for brunch recently with two others. My friend has the egg white omelette, which she added her choice of three veggies too. She said it was flavorful and not oily, a nice surprise. Most entrees also come with the option of a bagel, and it's a full sized one - not a mini! She had the everything, and while it didn't taste like it was from a local bagel shop in freshness, it had good crunch and taste. My boyfriend had the shashuska tofu scramble (with fake meat on top). Fantastic tangy flavor in the sauce and the tofu was not rubbery, but rather more like a fluffy egg. The chicken strips added extra protein, which was also a nice addition, as well as an everything bagel for him as well. I had the strawberry & blueberry gluten-free pancakes. I've had almond-flour based gluten-free pancakes before, which had a nice nutty flavor and were quick filling. These, however, were a bit more cake-like and almost gummy in how they came apart as you ate them. Still a very nice pancake, loved the addition of the sweet fruit, and a great substitute if you want a gluten-free option. Overall, we paid about $35 altogether, and we got an iced coffee, Moroccan iced tea (great herbal flavor) and a juice (beets, ginger and apple - nice burst of fresh flavor). Great deal for brunch!",,,

183,s. c.,"Denver, CO",13,40,0,2.0,3/5/2012,"Okay.  Came here looking for a vegan breakfast.  Found1. a quaint, small space with an extensive chalked menu covering three walls.  Very ...dense seating.  Does that pass fire code?2. vegan pancakes and tofu scramble!  Want.3. 2 pancakes and a ...tofu scramble ...is there tofu on the plate?  The pancakes were delicious, but 2 simply weren't enough to be satisfying.  The tofu scramble.. well... it was tasty, but didn't taste like tofu scramble.  It tasted like it belonged in a mock chicken sandwich (apparently they make many variations of that at this shop).  The tofu wasn't cooked with tumeric to even resemble eggs.  Instead it was still white and mixed with celery.  Celery?  In a mexican tofu scramble?  On top there were a few beans and some sort of onion and tomato salad.  It seemed like they put a scant scoop each of pre-made mock chicken salad, beans, and tomato salad together in a pan and then on my plate.  The separate oils from each component lingered on the plate.  It was strange.  Since we were still hungry, we ordered a bagel.  It tasted store bought.4.  orange juice.  This was good.  The soy chai was not.Cheap eats, but not worth the money.",,,
184,Dot S.,"Hoboken, NJ",705,176,30,4.0,5/22/2012,"Let me start with the Pro's:AMAZING menu (all over the walls). You would have to eat here once a day for the next year to experience everything on the menu. All seems very healthy and inventive. Con's: it is TOO FUCKING SMALL!! There is a constant HUGE line going in and out fo the place and you can barely turn around to pay and get out of the line it is THAT crowded. The ONE person running the place forgets most of the orders, either over charges or under charges and is so overwhelmed he looks and acts MISERABLE. Not sure WHY they don't expand and/or hire more staff. There is NO WAY to run this popular place with one person. The ""ice cream"" I ordered was suspiciously translucent. Didn't seem to have ANY dairy in it at all the chocolate sauce was pathetic so avoid eating the ice cream desserts here. My Hubby had a slice of cake and we all tried it, it was good but NOT fresh. This place has HUGE potential; such a pity it is micro-managed. ps. NO bathroom.",,,
185,Jean-Michel D.,"Staten Island, NY",1,58,0,5.0,8/27/2014,"I always stock up on vegan slices of cake when I come here, from chocolate strawberry to carrot to mocha, they're all so delicious. They have crepes too which are pretty good. The place is very small, almost as big as a closet so you might have a hard time finding a seat. The woman who took our order the last time we went was so nice, she really made our day. FYI This place is called Anthony's now, same everything but different name.",,,
186,Christina M.,"San Francisco, CA",188,956,1297,3.0,9/11/2011,"Admittedly, I went here for the Vegan Treats (from Bethlehem, PA), they had a lot of them. The cafe is quite small and not very fancy - luckily the weather was perfect, so the outside seating was quite wonderful. We ordered the peanut butter bomb and the mint bomb. While I'm a huge fan of the PB bomb, I felt that the mint bomb wasn't great and would never order it again. We also saw some of the sandwiches coming out of Atlas while we were eating our cakes and I was wishing I was more hungry to eat one, they looked really good. Having said all of that, I think Atlas is a great place for lunch or dessert, so give it a try.",,1,
187,Joey C.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",56,56,86,4.0,1/7/2014,"very comfortable.  feels like home.  appropriately priced, friendly staff (and customers oddly enough).  highly recommend if you're in the area or waiting to be seated at clinton st bakery.",,,
188,Jenina S.,"Manhattan, NY",545,61,15,3.0,3/15/2013,"I finally went into Atlas after walking by it every day on my commute to work. I never have cash on me so I when I finally did, I knew it was a designated Atlas day. I ordered a large coffee and an everything bagel (H&H bagels, nom) with cream cheese. Was the coffee good? Yes. Did it blow my mind? Not entirely. They do have some of the best bagels in the area, so this is just a good place to pick up some brekky.",2,,
189,Christine G.,"Port Jefferson, NY",310,168,124,5.0,4/22/2011,"Love this as a place to study or just a place to sit with friends. It's one of my fave places to study for sooo many reasons:-- Yummy coffee and cappuccino made perfectly-- Great panini sandwiches.... The speck panini is delicious plus comes with a chic pea salad on the side--FREE wifi!--Laptop seats with plugs around the room--Super friendly staff chatting in Italian--Cheap, good H&H bagels--You can stay awhile and no one cares!",1,,1
190,Christine K.,"Washington, DC",12,43,3,5.0,12/27/2010,"VEGAN peanut butter cheesecake VEGAN triple chocolate cake VEGAN lemon cupcakesVEGAN raspberry cheesecake VEGAN everything a child trapped in a vegan/lactose intolerant's body could ever want.

I found my heaven.",2,,1
191,Gabriela L.,"New York, NY",8,49,89,5.0,10/16/2013,"Love this little cafe. It's a great neighborhood spot to stop by in the mornings for a quick coffee and bagel or to sit and relax. The baristas are always pleasant, and their coffee is great. The patrons are also really nice - I've met many people here while waiting in line or having my coffee. It's cozy (small) but feels ""authentic"", has that great neighborhood feel...  :)",,,
192,Karry L.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,475,273,3.0,8/2/2013,"I've been there quiet a few times on weekend mornings that I just wanted to have a small bites before my real meal or I needed a pick-me-up tea! I love their limited selection of tea w tea leaves in a cheese cloth bag, there's black and green tea but w only couple of selections each and sometimes on a unlucky day, the kind i want is not on stock.  J likes his chai tea but it's not my cup of tea.  we've tried their almond crossaint, small, fluffy and crispy at the same time, lack of fillings, I still prefer my au bon pain's for its texture/fillings, portion and price! Nova lox bagel was good, but not as good as Russ & Daughter's, we were kinda disappointed the other day that we paid almost $9 for it and got only two thin slices of salmon out of it! As much as I like to support small independent cafe, I felt riped off. As far as decors,  I like the rustic feel of the cafe, tiny but its got enough tables to get morning people going! Not that I do bring a laptop w me for few times i visited, but there's no wifi and they don't allow laptops on weekends which i think it's abit harsh for others!",,,
193,Gabrielle F.,"Manhattan, NY",71,66,0,5.0,8/6/2014,This is the kind of place where you feel at home! The menu is unbelievable more than 100 sandwiches!! Vegan cakes and many other treats!,,,
194,David P.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,35,0,4.0,5/15/2013,"Great little place with a huge selection of things, a lot of healthy options, and an amazingly friendly staff.  While I was there the counter guy greeted at least half the customers by name.  At one point a very old and somewhat sketchy seeming lady came in and the guy just gave her a coffee without even asking and then she shambled out.  He later explained to a customer that she was the mother of another business owner on the block, but she has all kinds of health issues, so he just gives her a coffee when she comes in.  Amazing.",1,,
195,Allison D.,"New York, NY",300,71,0,5.0,10/7/2010,"I have been here a lot of times because it is AFFORDABLE and DELICIOUS and VEGAN. The service is quick, and the food does not disappoint. This place has it all, soft serve veg ice cream to a full meal. I just adore it. It is very small, and staff is impersonal but it is a cozy place to spend a freezing day inside sipping coffee with your love over a cookie.",2,1,2
196,Erica L.,"New York, NY",60,310,0,4.0,12/1/2010,"A couple of the reviews here seem to be confusing this Atlas with the one on 2nd Avenue - this is absolutely NOT a brunch place with a big menu! Just so ya know.What it is is a cute little coffee shop in the LES with a definite stay-and-study vibe. I sat there for a good 8 hours on a Tuesday and there was never fewer than 4 other people on laptops in the cafe, which only has about 8 tables. Nobody bothers you to leave and wifi is free and unlimited.There are tons of outlets, cheap enough, but not great, coffee, and decent snacks. I had the Moana panini which had pesto and mozzarella. It was fine but a bit greasy. There weren't a whole lot of other options - it's either a panini, a bagel or a pastry.There were a lot of foreigners in here all day, which was great for me as I was studying for my diploma to become an English teacher. That combined with the map on the wall made for great inspiration. Keeping my eye on the prize... One caveat: Atlas closes pretty early I believe - maybe around 8 or 9? Definitely check before you settle in if you're coming later in the afternoon.",2,,
197,Sue P.,"New York, NY",5,24,0,5.0,4/13/2011,"Places like this are what make New York one of the best places in the world .Fast food that's healthy, flavorful, and eclectic.  Yes, I know, it's small and has very few tables.  Blame that on the landlords and the politicians who favor them.  You want a cheap place, you gotta put up with the tight space.  But look at the great egg dishes that they serve every day and compare them to the overprices brunches everywhere else.The quiche and soups are amazing.",1,,
198,Eleana M.,"Middletown, CT",25,45,1,4.0,12/28/2014,"Coffee is decent but not great. On the other hand, the place is one of the coziest cafes I have seen in the city. Small and cute, great décor and music. Lovely place go hang out for a coffee with a friend, or just with a book or laptop.",1,,1
199,Laura G.,"New York, NY",46,51,0,4.0,7/19/2010,"I stopped here a moment ago for an H&H bagel and coffee, to go. (The former was intended as a delivery system to my mouth of the weekend's leftover Russ & Daughters lox and cream cheese.)There were seven women perched along two walls of the square space, equidistantly positioned, each blank-faced and pecking away at her laptop. Two sat in the window, in more paper-based pursuits. It seemed peculiar, and I caught myself cocking my head at my imagined NYC-female-freelance-writer competition. Like those birds, I'm one for alighting with my technology at local cafés. I might eschew this one for fear of homogeneity. However, the place is truly lovely, the coffee rich, and the man behind the counter was very sweet. The menu is appealing, and I'm sure Atlas Cafe will join my repertoire of places for daily bread and brew.",5,3,6
