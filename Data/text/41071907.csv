0,Daniel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,19,0.0,5.0,11/9/2018,"I love this place. It's literally a hole in the wall... But you know what they say... Those places usually have the best eats. This is definitely a greasy spoon, quick bite place but the breakfast is legit. I love the bacon, egg, cheese sandwich on white toast. I had the fried fish and eggs plate... So good! Bring ca$h only and say hi to owner, Sunny. He's a good dude.",,,

7,Thalia M.,"New York, NY",229,92,84,4.0,10/3/2008,"What do you get when you combine two Japanese, an African American cook, and a Dominican dishwasher?  Damn good home fries and grits with a smile, that's what. From the corner of 143rd and Lenox (6th Ave for you midtown folks) the entrance into ""Lenox Fast Food"" doesn't look particularly inviting, but their brazen claim to having the ""Best Breakfast Uptown"" was a challenge I couldn't resist putting to the test.I settled myself up on a stool at the end of a crowded counter top, and took in the menu. Omelettes with toast and home fries plus coffee or tea for $5.95. Pancakes and waffles, grits and sausage. Since it was too early in the day for a big meal I decided on bacon and eggs on toast, $2.85.As I internally debated what to order, a regular wandered in sending a greeting to the big, black grill man while expertly ordering and discussing last night's Cubs game with the man behind the cash register. Every now and then the cashier man would turn to the man flipping toast out of the toaster and verify someone's order in a stream of semi-intelligible Japanese (semi-intelligible because the Japanese words for grilled cheese sandwiches and the like are not so different from the original). The cashier man was big for an Asian, like he could hold his own in a contact sport, and every word out of his mouth carried the pure inflections of someone born and bred in the Bronx, with just barely a hint of a foreign accent. If you couldn't see him you could just as easily mistake him for one of those Ai-talian mobsters in the movies. The anomalous voice when paired with the face was rather entertaining and I couldn't help wonder if he really was born and raised in New York or if he just happens to have a penchant for gangster flicks.I hungrily eyed the piping hot home fries being served up next to me. Perfectly golden brown and crispy around the edges, they looked sun kissed and delicious. I will definitely have to order a complete breakfast next time. A moment later the cheerful toast flipping man was delivering my bacon and eggs on toast carefully and wrapped in waxy paper. Mid-meal he came back by and deftly switched my cup of water with a cup of pink lemonade from their secret stash somewhere in the back. The sweet, tart liquid was just what I needed to muster up enough of an appetite to finish the second half of my surprisingly filling sandwich.They've got my vote for best breakfast uptown!
