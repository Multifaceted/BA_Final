0,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",322,351,303,5.0,5/22/2018,Literally the best dive bar in all of manhattan. You can get a half bottle of shitty wine in one pour for like $5...enough said.,2,2,2
1,Benjamin D.,"Larchmont, NY",0,14,3,2.0,6/12/2018,Don't let the name fool you. Happy hour till 830 is surely this bars best attraction ($5 wells) But the bartenders are laughably slow and when it's not happy hour the drinks are stupid expensive ($14 for a makers on the rocks). Don't make the mistake of ordering food or you'll be stuck waiting for it and trying to order another drink for 45 minutes. So many great bars in this neighborhood. This ain't one of them.,,,
2,Michael R.,"Manhattan, NY",40,4,6,5.0,6/27/2017,"Very gay friendly staff and a fun place to enjoy yourself for a few hours. Looking forward to going back soon.  Perry the DJ was awesome and Eden the bar tender was great, too.",1,,2
3,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,2.0,6/17/2017,It's a bar I guess? That's all I can really say about this place. It's pretty bland and generic with nothing to set it apart.,1,,
4,Lorena S.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",55,76,122,5.0,7/6/2017,"I've been here for happy hour and also after hours as a grand finale to a bar hopping night.  During happy hour this place gets somewhat packed, but service is still above average.  Drinks are great, but beers are limited. As an after hour spot, it's exactly what you'd expect of a bunch of drunken kids still trying to get their last hurrah in and maybe score.  This isn't my scene so I can't say much having only stayed for one drink, but the music was amazing...old school hip hop so they got me there.  I ordered a vodka seltzer which I was thankful for being a bit on the weak side at 3am.  My friends had a good ol' American beer which is not on my list.  Overall I really like this place for happy hour and their DJ on Saturday nights drops my kinda hits!  I highly recommend!",1,,1
5,Claudia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",305,25,9,3.0,7/30/2017,"White white white! Stark white walls matched only by the stark white clientele! Not a huge problem for me, just very noticeable. I came around midnight on a Friday night because some of my (white) friends lived nearby and said Phillip Seymour Hoffman used to go there, and it was packed - beer was $7 so I didn't bother with the crazy crowd to get a drink but they had some Bieber and Selena playing...would have been nice to dance but there was absolutely no room. I imagine this place would be chill for an early evening weekend drink or a late night weekday though.",,1,1
6,Chelsea P.,"Manhattan, NY",68,68,15,5.0,11/29/2016,"I guess this is one of those love it or hate it type of bars based on the other reviews and I am firmly on team love it. I live in the neighborhood and I sorta made this place my local dive. I usually come between the hours of 1-3 with my friends and the crowd is always great. It's definitely a spot where people talk to strangers. I can't think of a time where I didn't meet someone interesting.I have obviously never eaten here based on the hours I frequent the place and honestly can't imagine them serving food, but the bar staff is definitely interesting and the ""DJ"" behind the bar is always willing to take a request.I recommend you give this bar a try with an open mind because it's honestly hard not to have a good time at this place.",,,
7,Annette V.,"New York, NY",779,234,34,4.0,5/7/2015,"Slims is a small, local neighborhood joint. Arrive early, get your drink on off their amazing happy hour deals than get out of there. After 10pm, the mood swings to a meat market, crowded scene that I promise the local NYer want only a part of it if you are going to ""hit it & quit it""...know what I mean. Other than that, great first round place and I would say a great spot to return late at night for a nightcap.",1,1,
8,David L.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",15,44,0,1.0,8/25/2017,"Used to love this place when Kent was the bartender.  Came in all the time and have tried to recently.  I've never seen a place go downhill as much.  The bartenders seem completely clueless.  The most recent time I came in for happy hour drinks.  Ordered 2 well drinks during happy hour and 2 about 10 minutes after happy hour was over.  The well drinks are $5 each.  Somehow they charged $42.  I was on a date so couldn't even argue, but I called shortly after and they gave me a very unclear explanation.  I also didn't leave a tip and yet they charged a $5 tip on my card. Will be disputing the charge and advising my fellow West Village residents to stay clear of this place now. Shame too because my friends and I are all locals and go out a lot and used to really like this place.",,,1
9,Karen W.,"New York, NY",0,55,0,4.0,9/30/2017,"Great divey bar with good music. The place is best when there is not a large crowd. A shame the locals have to share this place with the uptown and B&T crowd, but better than nit having it.",,,
10,Kevin S.,"Avon, CT",0,1,0,1.0,3/16/2017,"Got rejected with a friend at the door bc of a private party that was going while the other half of our group got in just before and other seemingly randoms got in very easily. Our friend had to come out and get us after. Bartender then told me there was no private party to begin with.... we didn't think anything of it until a couple of our other friends mentioned that they felt the bouncer was a bit racist towards me and my friend when they saw us get turned away from the inside. (I really hope that's not the case) 1st drink took me about 15 min to get ( I recommend getting two drinks at a time as the drink prices are very reasonably) but overall, not the best bar experience for me.However, if don't mind being elbow to elbow with friends and strangers while listening to some fun pop music, do give it a go. It's a very lively crowd. Tip to the bouncer n staff... if ur gunna reject someone at least get ur reasoning straight.",,,
11,Claudio M.,"Edgewater, NJ",7,63,0,1.0,5/15/2016,"Went there for a drink while waiting for a table at nearby restaurant. We came in and place was not packed. I wanted to order a few drinks, after 20 minutes and trying to catch the bartender' s attention, we finally were able to order. Stella and Pinot Grigio, simple right!?! Not for him, he could not understand and was looking at me like he saw an alien, also I think it's the only place in the world where the bartender looks down at the floor instead of the crowd.Never again!",,,

13,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,2.0,2/7/2014,This place is trying to remind you of the good old days. Old music on the jukebox playing with pictures of classic musicians on the wall..reminds me of a cafeteria trying to be a diner and miserably failing. They do have a decent selection of liquor and some beer on tap (blue moon).  There is a small TV to the left of the bar that shows sports.We tried to get zucchini fries but I failed because they didn't have them...on a Friday night...I guess I'd wait til the wee hours of the morning.,3,,1

Updated review","Dayuuuum...how many times can I be wrong about a bar?!  From 2 stars to 4 stars wrong.So yea, after 10pm on weekends, its a sh*t show. Hot mess that should be avoided.BUT....on weekdays, like for happy hour...its F'n terrific.$5 vodka sodas / mixed drinks from 4 to 8:30pm?  Um yea, you can find me and my homies all up in this bizzatch.",3,5,4

21,Sam G.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",3,6,0,1.0,11/14/2015,Horrible service. As soon as we arrive they tell us that there is a private party in two hours so they can't serve anyone. What's the point of being open if you can't serve anyone?,,1,
22,Megan C.,"New York, NY",3986,825,977,4.0,10/18/2010,"Divy, Great Happy Hour (LOVE THIS PLACE)Some places you have to appreciate for what they are. This by no means is a bad review, actually it's a GREAT review.  I just don't want to elevate your expectations and have you be upset.1. GREAT Chorizo tacos (I often stop by on my rollerblades to have an order) The portion size is pretty small but hey it's $5 for three of them and they're MORE than flavorful.  Take note yelp.com/biz/dos-caminos… charges a fortune for three tacos. Granted the location is better - these tacos I actually like more.2. SUPER cheap happy hour.  3. The place echos (so if there are a bunch of people talking - it gets noisy fast) It's a really small spot, and honestly it doesn't take much for it to get loud.4. Bartenders are friendly and nice. The service is pretty laid back (you could wait a while) but not pretentious.  5. Bare walls/floor etc - the decor isn't something to write home about.  Simple, casual, but decent music (depending on which bartender is D.J.ing). I have my favorites.So why all the compliments and only three stars?? To be honest it's a 3 star place. You just have to know what to expect and make the most of it.  Come for Happy Hour before you go to dinner nearby.  Note: I've never been here on a weekend.Date Rating: 4Pick up Scale: 1Strong Suggestion: Don't come here to meet people just come here to be down to earth, chill and low key.",2,1,1
23,Jack P.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,46,0,5.0,6/4/2015,Great food. The pork tacos and beef fajitas were very fresh. The prices are the best in the west village and the bartender friendly. Highly recommended,,,

32,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,3.0,2/27/2010,"Our second stop on a Saturday evening romp through the West Village included the hidden Automatic Slims.  I had never heard of the random bar, but was intrigued to be introduced to it.  The cool spot was located on a quiet corner amongst the cobblestone streets and silent residences just south of the hectic Meatpacking District.  It would have been very easy to walk right on by, except for the massive crowd packed into the tight space.  The long, narrow bar served up moderately priced drinks to the youngish crowd that braved the masses for sole purpose of downing some cocktails.  Though it might have looked like a refined version of a neighborhood watering hole, we could not be fooled.  This was still a filthy, dingy spot, which essentially brought a dive bar feel into the glamorous, expensive area.  We were able to avoid the cramped standing room by pushing our way over to the lone booth that was tucked away in the back corner.  Though we happily took the seats, the grimy restrooms located down the slippery staircase were not worth the similar excursion.Automatic Slims' success lies in its exclusive destination, but placed anywhere else, it would simply be another dive bar.",,,

35,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",184,618,2,3.0,1/7/2010,"Wow I wish I had read these reviews proper to stopping by on a Saturday night.Music was pretty good but the setup was a little weird.  Tables to sit at where big groups were drinking and talking.  Leaving a small amount of floor space for bar bystanders.  Most people standing at the bar were way too squished to move.  Some of the people who were taking up space looked like they were miserable just being there.  Bouncers and bartenders were really friendly and had the right attitude about the squeeze.  I'd go back but def as a late night, hop to and fro place.  Wouldn't hang my night on it.   Trust me isn't nearly as big as it looks in the pictures.",3,3,2
36,Ksenia N.,"ASTORIA, NY",129,4,0,5.0,1/10/2013,Woot! Was there with my friends last night! HAD A BLAST! Wish i could recollect the bartender's name! He's awesome! He has totally made our night!

37,Valerie R.,"Ridgewood, NY",9,23,4,1.0,3/31/2012,The ridiculously rude and unattentive  bartender let us sit at the table for OVER 10 minutes until I finally walked over to her asking her f there was any waiters to take our orders or even give us menus .. She blandly told us we had to order at the bar.  Our table was directly in front of where she was performing the very important task of cuting limes the entire time.  We decided to leave immediately after that.  NEVER AGAIN will I step foot in there.  For the neighborhood in there are HUNDREDS of other bars/restaurants you can go to and be given stellar service.  And also they Have a B rating that I hadn't notice until we decided to leave.,2,,
38,Chris D.,"New York, NY",16,5,2,1.0,9/9/2014,"The first time I came to this bar I very much enjoyed my time. The second time however was a much different experience. I and my classmates had been there for an hour already and I had decided to order tacos. Twenty minutes pass and no tacos. I had to go to a meeting and decided to cancel my order, and by then the bar was hopping. I approached the manager/bartender and asked if I could cancel the order and was surprised when he said,""well you better pay for the order."" When I told him that I had to go to a meeting and that I had been waiting for over 20 minutes for the order he said that it was my fault for not ordering sooner and that i had only been there for 30 minutes.he then proceeded to show me the door. Now I understand being in a pinch when a restaurant is busy (I worked in food service for over 5 years) but I never responded to a customer in such a rude and unprofessional manner. They lost a customer who was nothing but patient and polite. Try elsewhere if you don't like to argue with immature/unprofessional bar owners.",1,,

It was actually pretty good. I was sad there was no more left for me to poach. Drinks were pretty standard, the food looked pretty good.

44,Alan G.,"New York, NY",223,165,10,2.0,4/23/2009,"*The following takes place between 3am and 4am.**I meet my lovely friend outside. I hear Jon Bon Jovi. I walk in, peering into the dim, red lit interior. Then I open the second set of doors.What in the hellllllll (AKA Automatic Slims) is going on here!?!?Camera flashes are going off every 5 seconds amongst a large group of people who are OMG SOOOO WASTED AND SOOO HAPPY TO SEE YOU! People ""dancing"" (a bastardized version). People ""singing"" (also a bastardized version). People ""playing drinking games"" (take a wild guess). It reeks of hedonism and debauchery - of body odor, beer, and the potty.In the hour I was here this past Saturday night/early Sunday morning, the following occurred:- I was knocked into, not once, not twice, not thrice, but 5 times by a particularly motor skill deficient group of people attempting to dance. I haven't seen anybody as sloppy as these 2 guys and 2 girls since freshman year of college. They were like lemmings who've had too much cough syrup. On more than one of the occasions I was knocked, it was rather hard, akin to a flagrant foul in professional basketball; luckily I am a pillar of strength and as agile as a cheetah, thus deflecting the blows which would've felled many a lesser man. They then gave my friend the stink eye when she told them to calm the eff down, holding the gaze for a sloppy millisecond, thus losing any intimidation factor.- A girl and guy were attempting to do the Dirty Dancing thing where the girl jumps up into the guy's arms and is lifted up so it looks like she's flying or whatever. They did a decent job after a few failed attempts; I'm just glad I didn't have to call an ambulance.- A guy busy fist pumping raised his beer bottle and then lowered his beer bottle... Right into the top of my head. Thanks for knocking a couple of brain cells out mate, but I'm not sore considering I'm still beating you by roughly a gazillion.- Noticing the floor is ridiculously sticky everywhere, I pick the large shards of a broken beer bottle off the floor that's been neglected, as my friend is wearing open shoes and I don't want her pretty little feet getting cut.- Guy slips and falls on the floor, hitting the back of my knees on the way down. I stumble before regaining my balance thanks to the bar/friends. No harm done; Wipeout Guy actually seems a little embarrassed, so I decide not to give him a hard time. I can't tell if he's drunk or just pea-brained - possibly both.- My friend and I are waiting for bathrooms. She tries a door and opens it to see a guy pissing. He slurs out something about closing the door (as if we were just casually enjoying the view?) while my friend shrieks and lets go of the door. It is shut quick and he comes out a few moments later, giving us the nastiest look ever before trudging up the death stairs back to the bar.Use the friggin' lock, buddy.- There is a man on his knees on the floor, playing air guitar rather vehemently. He nails the solo, but loses at life because his pants are now damaged beyond repair by the filth on the floor.- A bro's bro plops down on a bar stool near me while I stand. He is staring at me. It is making me nervous. WHY IS HE STARING AT ME? He then greets me by saying, ""You're too good looking, man..."" and proceeds to give me the bro's bro handshake and hug, topped off with a kiss on the cheek. Minutes later he asks me if I've got cocaine that I'd be willing to share. Sorry bud, go fish.- This was very late in the evening, so I am not surprised by the crowd, just glad I do not get as stupid, inconsiderate, and flat out rude when drinking...Or do I? I ponder this on the subway ride home. My verdict? Nope. Am totally not an imbecile.So, Automatic Slims, I'm not your regular late night client, and I don't know if I ever will be. You've got some entertainment value though, so I'm not hating. It's not your fault you're mobbed by ridiculous individuals who think they're actin' all badass and cool in the Meatpacking District/West Village when really they just look silly. I mean, they're having fun, and I'm not anti-fun, but I'm not into having fun to the point that I'm basically assaulting innocent bystanders. Oh well.*I realize this made you think this was going to be a 24 themed review, so as not to disappoint, let's just say that Jack Bauer would come into Automatic Slims to investigate a terrorist threat then simply say, ""Screw it... Let 'em blow this up - it ain't worth savin'!"" (Except he'd save the employees, who are exceptionally cool and seem to recognize the ridiculousness of their predicament.)",30,57,26

Out of place much?- Sleazy dude chatting up some clueless girls while also attempting to hit on Melissa A. and I.- TONS of drunk ex-frat boys forming some kind of dance circle.I guess after coming here I've come to the conclusion that finance people just want to get wasted and dance around in their suits after work.

50,Pej A.,"New York, NY",6,8,0,5.0,5/29/2008,"Ok, so it's really about what you are in the mood for here kids.  If you want a quiet place for a neighborhood drink, or a place to catch the game, or someplace to sip on some chilled chardonnay and talk about your fiances (for finances), Slims is not that spots.  I'm a three year 'regular', and I can tell you that I only come here with one intention, have down and dirty good time - by that I mean do a few shots, get a little rowdy, and sing along to some timeless classics. So check out the pics of jazz stars of yesteryear, look past the occasional stale beer stench, and put on yo' dancing shoes.  They're not afraid to go Jay-Z to Bon Jovi to George Michael to Kanye, in that order, while bringing down the house.  And if you so happen to jump on the bar to shake your money maker, they probably won't pull you down.... that fast. Crowd is generally mixed up, with plenty of 'singleness' to be had.  Place is small, but relatively speaking the actual bar is not and the service never takes that long.  Thursday are probably the best night as the legend has spread across the rivers and lands so Fridays and Saturdays can get a bit too crowded, but never before 1am.  Oh did i mention that, no need to show up before 1am, that's amateur house.",4,1,2

The place is intimate, which adds a lot to its charm. I was impressed by the small but diverse beer selection...even more impressive was the $3 Stellas! Being a Thursday during happy hour, the crowd was also very diverse. You had everything from your after work suits to your local hipsters...all drinking in harmony. The music was from a play list on a laptop behind the bar and was the perfect mix for happy hour. The bartender was very friendly and responsive.I will definitely seek this place out again the next time I am in the West Village.",3,2,3

Updated review","I guess I'm still a fan of this place, however, the times that I've been back during the evenings just didn't cut it, I loved the afternoon vibe better. It seems a lot of young actors come here to be dramatic, and I really dislike that, couple that with the extremely loud music and you have yourself a place that just feels disjointed; they have all these great photos of great musicians on the wall and all they could come up with is top 40 crap?

63,Tanya P.,"Watertown, CT",13,6,0,1.0,1/14/2012,"I bought a restauraunt.com deal early in the summer and keep popping over hoping to try this place out. Usually it's packed with people, or it's closed. I called ahead tonight and made sure they were open. They said kitchen is open until 11:30 on the phone. I live a bout a10 min walk away and was there around 8:00.  We find a seat. I spend ten minutes at the bar trying to get the bartender's attention and show him the printout and go to order and he walks away. Okay, he's busy. Deep breath. He takes the entire bar left to right (me)'s order and then grabs a group that just walked in's food order, then is finally ready for me.I rattle off what we want and ask if that's enough because I did the math but wasn't sure. He looks at the deal and says, yeah, it's okay. We get two orders of chorizo soft tacos.  ($6+$6), citrus beef fajita ($6), and lime cilantro chicken entree ($12) - total $30 + 2 jack & gingers. Restaurant.com deal is for $25 off if you spend $35, but alcohol is included. Food comes 20 mins later.... Other reviews explain the place is skeleton bones staff and shotty service. I get it, it's seriously one guy in the place and someone downstairs cooking that he keeps running and getting food from. I don't love the taco, but I'm starving. My date is loving his chorizo taco. I thought the fajita was good, but cold, and the lime and cilantro are strong but good on the chicken. The mashed potatoes are like a mountain and the asparagus is the best I've ever had.So I finish and go back up to the bar, try to get the guys attention for a while, finally do, ask if I can pay. He gets the check and tells me I have to spend $15 more for my coupon. Uhhh okay. Would have been ideal if he mentioned that when I originally asked him, but okay, we're still hungry, it kind of sucks, but it's okay. Honest mistake.  He says I can order two more mixed drinks and it'll be fine. I decide on settling for crappy beer and getting a side of the asparagus. No prob he says. He puts it all on my card. I know there's 18% included already, but I feel bad for the guy and I tip him an extra $10... on $41, after it's originally $66, for some appetizers and an entree. Geez, so much for saving money with the restaurant deal.I'm not a huge complainer. I have a rather big tolerance for crappy service. I'm extremely patient when it comes to restaurants and social situations. I'm not a diva. I live in the village but I'm not a barbie bitch. I've worked in the service industry and I like to think I have a bigger tolerance than most when it comes to poor service.BUT. Tonight's different. They would have gotten a three or four star from me had I gotten my asparagus. I really really tried to give them a chance. I went up about a half hour after I ordered the side of asparagus to check on it, nothing yet. After 45 minutes, a bouncer came in, a second bartender came in, a bachelorette party came in, lights turned down, music turned up. I went up to the bar and tried to get one of the bartender's attentions. The girl poured herself a glass of water and leaned back watching people before she finally noticed me. I didn't want to seem like a bitch so I asked, ""Is the kitchen really backed up?"" She said, ""No, it's closed."" And I gave her a surprised look. I said, ""I ordered asparagus almost an hour ago, I just wanted to know if they were almost ready."" She walked over to the original bartender (a guy) and said something. He went to the kitchen, came back out, GRABBED A PLATE OF FRIES that had been sitting on the bar SINCE I originally ordered at 8:30 and said, ""Here's your order!"" with a smile on. I was like... that's not asparagus and it's cold.  He said, ""Oh, oops. Kitchen closed at 10?"" It's 10:05.  He already charged my card (around 9 when I ordered it) and the $10 I tipped is gone. He offers me a free drink, on the house, hands me bottom shelf vodka on the rocks. I'm still hungry. I'm super pissed. It's the absolute worst place i've gone in Manhattan in the five years I've lived here. It's door to door brahs watching football and dumb barbie girls. There's not enough room to breathe. It's loud. The food's okay but not worth dealing with the imbeciles. I felt bad for the staff, until the guy tried to pass off three hour old fries as asparagus. I am not only NEVER going here again, I am going to make sure no ONE I know ever does either. This place sucks.",2,,

The place was empty (it was 7 on a Saturday night) but the music was great. the lone bartender let us dance on the bar (she def had to be thinking we were nutty) and we each ordered a beer (quite expensive I remember thinking but I can't swear on a price). The steps to the bathrooms are so steep I am surprised no one has killed themselves yet. seriously!We were trying to make convo with the female bartender who told us she grew up across the street. It bothers me incessantly when people lie. She was not a native nyc'er. Not sure why this bothers me so much. But it does. We were 3 harmless girls. Stop lying. Next.,,,
66,Rosie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,4,0,5.0,8/9/2009,"I stumbled upon Automatic Slims after a stroll through the new Highline Park, and discovering this bar was as enjoyable as seeing the amazing garden that's been built up on the old Highline tracks. My husband and I were looking for a spot to enjoy a late afternoon cocktail and an early evening nosh, and Slims satisfied on both accounts. The room is unpretentious but comfortable, and reminds one of a NYC neighborhood bar, pre-gentrification; no designer flourishes, no overwrought, look-at-me Meatpacking district fashionistas, and a mix of customers of all ages, ethnicities and gender preferences. The music playing on a Friday around 6:30PM was perfect for my 40 year-old ears: hip 60's, 70's, and 80's tunes playing at a level just loud enough to be enjoyed - when you want to sing a bar along with Lou Reed or David Bowie - but by no means too loud to ruin conversation or the lazy afternoon sunshine vibe.Service was excellent. All tables were full, and there were a few patrons sitting at the bar, but the bartender handled everyone like a champ: she was efficient, pleasant, and had a close eye on everyone's needs. We ordered food, and got the nachos, chicken tacos, and a side of cilantro rice and black beans - the portions were generous, the food hot, and the flavors interestingly executed. Slims clearly puts some thought and quality ingredients into the food. And if all this wasn't a great enough surprise, our check, for 3 drinks and the above-mentioned food, only came to $38. We probably left at around 8PM, and there was still no sign of the antics described in some of these other reviews. So, it seems there are indeed a few perks to getting older, and doing your drinking before the sloshy twenty-somethings even leave the house at night.",2,,
67,Elizabeth M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,5/13/2013,"I live in the neighborhood and have been going to Automatic Slims for cheap drinks, great music & a good time for years. With that said, over the past year I have noticed some beyond shady activity happening at this wv bar. The 1st incident happened when a group of us came in for a birthday party. Our friend reached into her bag half way through the evening & noticed her iPhone was missing. She used it a couple times earlier in the bar so she knew when she reached back into her bag & it was no longer there she immediately started to speculate if it was stolen. This incident should have been enough for me to  write the place off but I was willing to give A.S. the benefit of the doubt & returned around midnight on a random Saturday. The place was packed like sardines, as always, and for some reason the bouncer (& his shady crew) hanging outside made my boyfriend pay to get in. The rest of our group was already inside so he had no choice but to give this guy $20!! I would like to remind everyone this is a tiny bar with about 8 tables, not a tacky Chelsea club! The final straw was when my BF & I were meeting friends there a couple weeks ago(not our choice on venue) so we decided to go late thinking we wouldn't have to spend too much time there. The bouncer & his 2 buddies were sitting outside & made a joke to us about paying a cover charge. This time we laughed it off & just walked in. It was around 1am and the crowd of drunk kids started to disperse. Thinking it was late & the place was clearing out I hung my jacket on the coat rack. Definitely a stupid decision based on the past I've had at this place. I checked on the jacket a couple times throughout my hour or so stay & it was still on the rack. As we were leaving the bar my leather jacket was gone! It just vanished into thin air. To make matters worse my BFs Paul Smith jacket was also ""missing"". He folded his up on a chair across the room from where my jacket was hanging. When I called that following Tuesday to see if either one of our jackets were found the women on the phone acted like this happens all the time. She had said people leave the bar wasted all the time with other peoples coats, sometimes returning them back to the bar. I find it hard to believe the token drunk kid of the evening did a couple laps around the bar before stumbling home to pick up a designer jackets, mens & women's XS & Large. I'm not sure if it's new management or a couple dishonest employees but I will never go back to this place!!! My main reason for writing this is so these awful things don't continue happening to unsuspecting patrons. I guess those cheap drinks do come with a price after all. It really is a shame because I did have some great times at this place which is now a distant memory.",2,,

No, let me rephrase that; alive and KICKING!!What a proper way to be a counterpart; just like in Miami, Automatic Slims is near the ""hip"" bars and clubs in the Meat Market district, but keeping his distance.... it is as if both franchises would be saying to their stiff neighbors: ""I want to be on prime location too, but I am NOT one of you""... and thus, just a short walking distance from Little West 12, this corner bar has everything that my fav Miami bar has; the raunchy attitude, the laid back feel, and the MUSIC...Let me attest to something that will probably make the day of a has-been rocker; I came here last Friday, finding the same mix of 80's expected from Automatic Slims; they were playing ""Pour some sugar on me"" at full blast, everyone was totally drunk and/or high, I went for the bathroom... I came back up, I make my way to the bar where my friends are, my friend Margarita (who was visiting) was surprised at the rowdiness (and to be honest I was too, a bit) and I was trying to reassure her when the intro of Eddie Money's ""Take me home tonight"" fills the environment....suddenly the whole place starts screaming, and as soon as the song starts, every voice on the tiny bar starts singing the lyrics along... it was electrifying and I got goosebumps all over (that's one of my favorite songs), I just couldn't believe that a semi-obscure hit of the 80's would garner that much enthusiasm, and from 20 somethings to boot!!

GNR, Toto, Foreigner, etc... and the scene/crowd seemed to change as the evening progressed, but didn't pick up on the douche vibe too much unless I was the one bringing down the street cred of the whole bar...  but then again, I have only been once.  Either way, I thought it was a nice little hole in the wall in the West Village that I should have not neglected for so long...  live and learn, I guess?",,,
