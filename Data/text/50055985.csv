0,Claire L.,"New York, NY",389,81,960,3.0,5/1/2018,"Prices here are HIGH. I work in the city and the Kombucha I typically buy back at my local grocery story is HALF what it costs here. Hot food menu is good, but very expensive. Almost $11 per lb for their hot food buffet. Conveniently though, in the evening the prices drop down to about $6 per lb... seems to only make sense to take advantage of the food here around dinner.Most concerning though is the terrible customer service. Workers at the cash wrap are very rude and short.",,,
1,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,95,179,4.0,5/10/2018,"Love the salads here. It's a fixed price for them, I think like $7 and change. If you do get a salad make sure get the ginger sesame dressing!! OMG! It's so good.",1,1,1
2,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,3.0,4/2/2017,"This spot has great potential but I wish it was a little more refined, for lack of a better word. Frequently, I'll come in for a coffee but sometimes they're just out of coffee. How is a deli out of coffee? I love that they have indoor and outdoor seating. I love having a coffee sitting outdoors on a beautiful day. This place is very expensive, even for the area, but I like supporting local businesses and with the outdoor seating, you're kind of paying for the ambiance.Pros: they sell beer and prepared foodsCons: bakery items sometimes stale, expensive",,,
3,Ashley D.,"New York, NY",5,61,3,1.0,7/5/2018,"WAY OVERPRICED groceries, food that is mediocre at best. They don't put prices on most things, so you find out how overpriced it is once you get to the register. Really slimy tactics to employ. I'm certain they only stay in business due to the desperation in an area with few options.",,,
4,Sahar S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,1,1.0,4/27/2017,"Don't go there.. very rude employees.. they don't know how to deal with customers!!! I have been a regular customer there as it is next to my house. Yesterday I decided not to ever go again there.. I had my lunch and my coat was on the chair and when I was leaving, I realized that wet paint was allOver my coat !! And when I went to complain as there was no sign of wet paint on the wall.. the lady at the cashier said: so what do you want? Do you want me to pay you back for your coat!!!! She didn't even bother to apologize. I had to run to pick up my daughter from  school and on my way back , I went in and asked for the manager .. I told him the whole story in front of the girl who was rude enough to start taking to her boss in Spanish in front of me and it was obvious to her that I don't speak the language! Very rude ..",1,,
5,Andrea G.,"New York, NY",13,41,8,2.0,2/19/2017,"Same as a lot of people said I live 20 feet away and will not order here again or go in. They state they are open until a certain time and we go in almost an hour before closing and they refuse to sell us sandwiches or muffins which are already made. I say to the cashier ""umm your open another hour why can't we have a pre made sandwich?"" his response "" I'm not making the deli guy work over time"" Me: ""ummm they are already made and on yelp you state you are open another hour. So if I were to order on yelp a sandwhich you would not bring it? He said "" nope I'd call you and cancel the order"" What is the point of being open then? And stating on yelp you are open and list the menu. Very disappointing. Like others said we order from 2nd ave or walk up and eat somewhere else.",2,1,
6,Ashley K.,"Queens, NY",143,15,6,2.0,8/12/2017,Great prices. Great food. Horrible service at times. I come in here all the time every morning they said they serve breakfast 6-11. I just went in there at 6:55am she said they not serving breakfast yet. I asked what time she said 7:30 but when I come at 11:05 or 11:07 they tell me they are done serving breakfast. I don't like that. Later serving breakfast but want to stop serving at the exact time. I'm going to stop coming here because this is a everyday thing and I only work mornings. Won't waste my time anymore.,,,
7,F E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,9,0,1.0,2/28/2018,"This place is my least favorite. Sadly, majority of the times i call to pick up or have my food delivery the girls who answer calls always find a way to screw it up. To add on, very rude on the phone and acts like they dont know anything in the store!!!!! Various times i had to yell at them!!!",,,
8,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,7,0,3.0,2/28/2018,This is a place has potential to grow more they need a bit more of variety in food. Overall its a good place to go an grab a quick bite.,,,
9,Bill T.,"Holmdel, NJ",66,2,0,1.0,6/3/2017,"This place was good for maybe a month after they first opened.  Unfortunately their service both behind the grill and register really dropped off to beyond terrible.  Their prices are also wildly inconsistent despite a 10% NYU discount.  One thing I will say thats consistent is their downward trend.  I thought it was only a one or two time isolated affair, but the last several visits here have left a lot to be desired.  There are far too many options within several blocks to deal with this worsening establishment.",1,,
10,Dolores S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,37,0,3.0,1/30/2017,"The selection of food and snacks is good and the staff is very nice whenever I am there, though it is a bit disorganized.  There is not much that is a stone's throw from my office so it was a welcome addition when they opened last year.  One suggestion: I ordered the hot chocolate and it is not up to NY standards, especially for a place with gourmet foods.  They used a packet of Swiss Miss!  It was overly sweet and not very tasty.  I suggest that they get a tin of some decent chocolate, like Jacques Torres, and post that they have it, and I bet they will sell a lot of it.",,,
11,Sharon G.,"New York, NY",83,20,6,2.0,11/27/2016,"I visited this place because a friend suggested it due to the wide selection of food available. Overall I like the food which is why my review is so generous in terms of stars. However, I do not think I will suggest this place because of the management. After inquiring for a catering order I was utterly surprised at the lack of knowledge the manager on site had, she was unable to clarifying what options I had for my order. She was also very condescending and in a rush to dismiss me, hence why I rather not do business here. Great food but lousy manager set the tone for me.",,,
12,Yelper N.,"New York, NY",1,174,108,4.0,9/13/2016,"make your own salad, pre-packed meals and good options for salads and sweet baked goods. a much-needed addition in this barren land of 1st av eats",,,
13,Matt M.,"Hoboken, NJ",237,1,0,1.0,1/7/2017,"When this little shop first opened I thought it was to be considered a respectful establishment.... oh how I was wrong!!! There's so many things wrong with this place, I just don't know where to begin. Let's start with the manipulation, they're really good at that. The manager once tried to convince me to buy a 30 pack of water for $45. I asked him why anyone would pay such a price, and he said convenience. Which brings me to the next problem: management. There is none. These people either don't know how to read, or don't care to. Unless I'm blind, it says on their front entrance ""Beer & Wine"" yet when I ask where the wine is, they say back, ""wine""? Unless they drop their prices, and drop them bigly, stay away!!",1,,
14,Beeren G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,3,2.0,1/21/2017,"Extremely poor service!  The guy making breakfast won't even acknowledge you standing in front if him and looking right at him.  Then he takes someone else's order and tells me I didn't say anything to him.  No apology or anything.   This is the second bad experience  here.  I live a block away and was so hoping this place would be better.  I'd much rather walk up to 2nd Ave for more selection, better food and service.",,,
