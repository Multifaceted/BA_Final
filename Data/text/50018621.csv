0,Adam E.,"New York, NY",0,3,0.0,5.0,11/20/2018,I love the atmosphere and old school New York waiters.Just wish they never remodeled and changed the interior.This is good diner food and they are open 24 hours.All the Yuppies and Transplants need to take their attitude and sense of entitlement to the trendy diners.,,,
1,Caroline K.,"New York, NY",99,30,3,3.0,9/23/2018,"This diner checks all the classic diner boxes. Those brown tufted booths, the soda shop glasses, the expansive, plastic, breakfast-at-any-hour menu; it hits every mark satisfactorily.  I have only two qualms to speak of. Though relatively inexpensive given the exorbitant prices in the neighborhood, the total for two breakfast entrées and one fountain soda was almost $40 with tip, which anywhere but NYC would be criminal. Secondly, I struggle to justify settling for simple diner food when I'm in downtown NYC surrounded by some of the best restaurants in the world and myriad international cuisines, or at least gentrified takes on them.The best things about this place are the *relative* (in)expense for a sit-down place, the late hours, and the romantic notion one gets about going at 3:45AM to an old-school diner that's been there for decades in the Village. This last point is the only reason that might sway me to recommend this restaurant to someone, because who doesn't need a little charm and nostalgia these days...",,,1
2,Vanessa D.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,42,14,1.0,8/13/2018,"This place is not very good. Or at least, our only experience here was not very good. And we won't be coming back. Firstly, their credit card machine was broken the day we came in. That was fine since there is a Wells Fargo across the street. After grabbing some cash, we went back to the pretty empty diner. After sitting us down, the waitress (an older woman with blondish hair) gave us menus and asked us if we wanted any drinks. We ordered black coffee, and began to peruse the menu. After two minutes of this, she brought out the coffee and asked if we were ready to order. Like, what? We just sat down. How can we possibly decide after two minutes? We just said we needed more time. She walked off. Shortly after, about five minutes this time, she came back and asked if we were ready. I told her again we needed more time, and she looked annoyed. Sorry the restaurant you work in doesn't have many customers that you have to pester the ones you do get. And I'm sorry the food at this place looks so unappetizing and so expensive that I don't want to rashly choose a dish I probably won't like. I'm pretty sure that's why she was rushing us to choose, because she knows the food isn't great so 1. It doesn't matter what we choose since it'll be bad, or 2. She wants us to choose before we come to our senses and decide we don't want any food. After looking through the menu, the food all looked horrible. We decided to just have coffee and talk and go someplace else to eat. After the waitress came back and asked if we were ready and we told her we would only have coffee, she looked really annoyed and walked away with our menus abruptly. The reason why this gets a two star is because the woman who rang us up (the young cashier working behind the glass casing of donuts and treats) was really nice, and their baked goods looked okay.",1,,

It was not too crowded but more people came in as we ate. Lots of carry out orders as well. Our waitress was so nice and checked on us often. Staff kept our drinks filled and were also friendly. Coffee was good. I loved the flavoring of their hash browns which were crispy outside and fluffy inside.t husband likes his pancakes and bacon a little more well done, which they achieved perfectly. We loved the vintage setting and neighborhood feel. We would definitely come back again. As we left, everyone said goodbye and thanked us for coming.",,,
5,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",399,484,1234,2.0,1/20/2018,"Background info: Saturday afternoon, 2:30 PMWaiter: How many?Me: We will be 2. My friend should be here in 5 minutesWaiter: Are you sure she'll be here in 5 minutes?Me: How can I know for sure? (If I could predict the outcome of such questions with 100% accuracy, I would run out to select the winning Lotto numbers).Waiter: Wait by the counter until she arrives since all parties must be here for seating.Me: Obliged but mentioned I would get started with a hot teaAfter brief conversation in Spanish between staff, I was shown to a table. My friend arrived less than 5 minutes later!!Hey, Waverly Diner--what's with the attitude? If I had mentioned I was dining alone, I would have been sat at a table (which, btw includes 2 chairs!!!) immediately. Furthermore, this diner has been around FOREVER--the wood paneled walls can attest to that. Usually, upscale restaurants require all parties to be present upon seating. I get it. However, I was going to start my order upon seating. Not cool.After that unpleasant and unnecessary dialogue, my  friend arrived and we got seated;  perusing the menu. She, being on the Whole 30 plan and looking to follow the restrictions. Speaking for myself, I ate earlier and was looking for a small bite. Problem solved.My friend ordered an avocado omelet which looked pretty good. As diners have a gazillion menu pages, I settled on a side of avocado since my friend was going to give her toast to me (not part of the Whole 30). What can I say, I was in the mood for avocado toast and it was not on the menu despite their menu devoting an entire page titled ""everything avocado"". Hmmmm.This diner must have missed the entire avocado toast invasion which has been around for several years.The diner has absolutely no atmosphere but it was jam packed. Go figure. As mentioned, the décor was '70's wood paneled walls--nothing more than table, chairs and a few framed photos hung on the walls. It has a following though.Regardless, it was my friend's recommendation and we were looking to catch up (she also mentioned she'll occasionally grab a bite here when in the area). Speaking for myself, I don't believe I ever visited.My friend enjoyed her omelet and I made my ""avocado toast"" work. We were both satisfied.I am very inclined to give 1 star, but my friend and I occupied the table for a couple hours, our water glasses were frequently refilled, and I'm feeling generous. Besides, some of the food being brought to other tables looked good (example: Belgian waffles with strawberries and steak fries). This means, I might return. Maybe. Not deliberately, more like accidentally.Word of advice, Waverly Diner--please come down to earth. No need for the initial snootiness!",10,6,8

You see, it was during my hay day of hanging heavy on Christopher Street and the memories of Waverly still come in flashes. Came here with a friend after some drag bingo on a Sunday evening. Got sat right away. This diner is filled with booths if you're in to nostalgia. But not much more in the decor department. The menu is filled with many choices. You know, diner stuff. We were some what greeted by a grim waiter. Took our order. It got to us pretty quickly. The philly cheesesteak was a bit small. Not much of an homage to Philly. My latkes too were shaped and made unconventionaly. Not much crunch but enough to satisfy me and my friend who is vegan. And for where this eatery is located, the prices here are right. I'd give Waverly another go round.",1,,

This diner opens 24/7, which is awesome. We came here at 4 am and there were still many employees working. Their menu has a very good selection of food. Just their omelets took a half page of the menu. The omelets price ranged between $10 - $15. I got an omelet, it was served with hash browns and white toast on a pan.

12,Brantley H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",90,56,87,2.0,3/22/2018,"Context: 3am tasting menu with a bottle of champagne. We stumbled in here in not the best of states after a hazy night, but I will not soon forget the shoddy quality of food and drink we were served. First off, we had to WAIT for a table... at 3AM! What?!? Why are there so many people in this city such that a place like waverly diner is PACKED at such a godless hour?? After about 15 minutes of waiting, we were shown to our table that surprisingly wasn't covered in filth. We took stock of the menu and ordered half of it. Pancakes? Check. French fries? Check. Mac and cheese? Check. Pizza Burger? Check. Grilled cheese? Check. BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE? WHAT? But yes, check.Our server promptly twisted open the diner's finest ""champagne"" and we dove in, but hit the bottom of the pool IMMEDIATELY. It was SO DAMN SWEET my god - reminded me of my high school friend's basement. Next, the food. Let's start with the positives: it was all hot, didn't taste stale and no one got sick. These are three important milestones while eating really much of anything at 3 in the morning. But it has to be said, each item of food we had was comically bad. The pancakes tasted like styrofoam and the syrup they had on the table had a hint of flavor, but i'm convinced was encased in plastic. The mac and cheese was such a bright yellow, it must have either been radioactive or sharpie's play on getting into the food business. The pizza burger was from purina. And the grilled cheese AND the fries?? Well, these two things were just below average.Despite all that, this place has a certain undeniable charm. I'll definitely look to find my way in here come the next late night hunger fix, but I hope to find that the waverly diner is closed by then.",,1,
13,Jaylynn H.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,10,0,2.0,6/8/2018,"Okay! So. This was our second time here. The first time we went here was at about 6 am and we ordered breakfast. It was great. Service was nice! But, this time. No. We showed up at about 3 am on June 8th, 2018. We sat down. No complaints. We got handed the menus and everything was fine. Not even 10 min go by and the guy still hasn't brung us water and comes back asking ""are you ready""? I said ""not at the moment but may I get water please?"" He completely bypasses my question and leaves. This is an older gentlemen with white hair and a pretty thick accent. He comes back not even 2 min later and ask are we ""done yet""? I was really confused on why we were being rushed? I said no and my boyfriend then says ""sir, can we please get water""? Our waiter didn't even bring it, the other gentleman working there did and as he was giving us our water he even asked ""are you guys ready yet""? I'm not sure about you, but I need about a good 15 min. Plus, didn't even ask us about what drinks we wanted at least first. He comes over and we tell him our order. The whole time he had a real blah attitude. After we order, he takes our menus. We don't wait very long. Here's the issue now. My boyfriend ordered a cheese burger with fries. It says ""2 dollars extra with cheese on the fries"" so he gets that. I also ordered a ""soda float"" which said $4.95. But, the ""ice cream soda"" was $5.00. It's literally the same thing. Please real through the menu. There's lots of things that they try to catch you with. The food was good. I ordered spaghetti and meat sauce. The cheese fries were alright but they just melted American slice cheese on top of it. It wasn't even melted. That was disappointing. We also ordered mozzarella sticks and they never came. Which we were grateful at that point they forgot only cause we were full. Towards the end, the guy tried charging an extra $14.00. Mistaking it. He says ""oh I meant $4.00"". He was taking forever to rewrite the check and he was just staring at it like he didn't know what to write. My boyfriend let him know that the fries come with the burger. And the guy said. ""You didn't order a deluxe"" my boyfriend then goes on to say ""you menu says cheese burger and it comes with fries. That's what I got. And $2 extra for cheese"" he proceeded to tell us ""you don't know how to read the menu. You didn't say it right. You took too long to even read the menu"" You don't talk that way to customers. You should be willing to understand that your menu was not very clear. In which it wasn't. That guys service was not okay. This was the first time we ever went out and didn't leave a tip. Due to the fact that his attitude didn't help anything and it was bad vibes.",5,,

Updated review","My dear friend needed someone to talk to.It was 1am, and this place was the closet thing around NYU we stumbled upon.She ordered hot chocolate, I ordered coffee.  They moved us from a big booth to a two seater when they realized we weren't going to order food.   They gave us those cute old school short water glasses that you can gulp down in a few sips.The old wood interior looks super 1940s, is brightly lit, with coat hooks on the tall booth tops.   Our old white haired waiter was no nonsense and efficient with few words like the background of a film noir diner.""You might be wondering why I asked you here."" ""They make a great omelette ?""""This isn't about eggs Joe.""""I didn't think so.  I thought it was about marbles."" ""and you've lost yours.""""Like you lost us... along time ago.""""I lost my appetite.""She gets up and puts on her coat. He stays seated as she walks down the aisle. She puts on her sunglasses.She turns to the cashier, ""Dinner's on him tonight.""  As she opens the door and walks out onto 6th avenue.This classic diner screams old New York.Go for the retro ambiance, a friend, and an omelette.  Don't expect too much in the food department.  Fries are good but the burger is one step right below mediocre.",6,4,4
15,Mary e.,"Miami, FL",129,231,110,5.0,2/26/2018,"Stopped by for just coffee (to warm up) but once inside and presented with the warm and cozy ambience and the mega menu I just had to try the grilled cheese.  I love bacon and tomatoes, so that had to go in there. And it was deli she.  The double espresso was just right and the service was super fast, super good, super cheap, and just everything was right.  If you are in this hood (Greenwich Village), you have to definitely give this place a visit.",,,
16,Addison C.,"Bohemia, NY",1,20,32,3.0,8/7/2018,"Waverly diner along with the Greenwich diner has been around forever, probably changed ownership more then a few times over the years, it's good if your looking for something simple and inexpensive. It's a late night destination for club goers and party people, being open 24hrs. A day and in the close proximity to so many bars!I like the fact that I can just plop down at the counter and get in and out in an under an hour, which is convenient, since I work in the area. For me, there's never a bad time for eggs, and I consistently have a good experience with the eggs at the Waverly diner, they are served in a mini frying pan, which I like, sausage,ham or bacon, all good! I always do French fries instead of hash browns, extra white toast(for mop up) some coffee (meh), cold OJ and you got yourself a very satisfying and comfortable meal! I haven't tried much else over the years to be honest, besides the cheeseburger platter, but if you like your eggs old fashioned NYC style, breakfast or anytime this is the place for you!",,,
17,Christina G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",110,92,233,3.0,3/9/2018,"Tons of options and a good feel to the place, but still a classically overpriced diner.Food: 3.5Atmosphere/Aesthetic: 4Service: 2.5Price/Value: 3Ordered the diet veggie burger. ($13, note- does not come with fries but that's okay because fries are unhealthy anyway) Good veggie burger, but nothing special. Came with two onion rings on the side. Honestly overpriced. My friend ordered one egg with sausage and hash browns though ($10) and said the sausage was one of the best she's ever had! It was also neat how it came in a skillet on a wood platter. The atmosphere is a very classy diner feel; I like it a lot. The server wasn't the friendliest and took a while to cash us out, but it was around 2am when my friend and I went there, so I imagine they were just tired. Overall, it's overpriced, but it has a good aesthetic for a diner and is open 24/7. Better than Cozy's Soup and Burger diner in my opinion.",,,
18,Gauravi P.,"Boston, MA",259,351,671,3.0,11/6/2017,"What respectable diner charges 13 for an omelette?! I don't care if you are located on top of the Taj Mahal. If you are calling yourself a diner, lower your prices please. We ordered:-Tomato cheddar cheese omelette (very food) -Western omelette -Bacon and cheese sandwich on a English muffin-Plain pancake with blueberry compote The omelette were very good. They came with hash browns and your choice of two slices of toast. The hash browns were cut beautifully (shaved) but had no salt or pepper which ruined it. The toast was not buttered like proper diners do. The sandwich was very good. But the pancake experience was not. For some reason, this diner refuses to serve blueberry pancakes and instead serves plain pancakes with blueberry compote...this essentially is a pancake folded in half and stuffed with this canned blueberry jelly. The jelly itself is disgusting and repulsive but the pancake is very good. I wish we knew this ahead of time and ordered plain or chocolate chip pancakes with no compote.   Our total bill not including tip but including one apple juice was $48- an outrageous bill to pay for breakfast for 3 people at a diner. The atmosphere at this diner is a little fancier. Your omelettes come out in a metal pan on a block of wood. And the seating are old style Victorian looking booths. But I just find this very misleading and would prefer to sit in plastic booths and get served with plastic plates. Or at least make food that match your high prices.",3,2,1

Updated review",This place is an institution and I have been going there for 20 years. Most of the time the food is good and the staff is friendly. But there is one waiter who is completely miserable. He grumbles to himself about whatever your order. He slams the plates down on the table and if you ask for anything - like extra mayo - he acts like you asked for a pound of flesh. Some of the customers seem to think it's funny and he spars with them regarding his bad attitude. But I have had a few not so funny encounters with him. He's been there forever so hopefully he will retire soon.,,,
32,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",417,497,8940,5.0,8/19/2016,"I adore everything about this place.  Their friendly neon glowing all night, their homey booths and friendly staff who'll greet you with a smile whether it's 3pm or 3am.  And especially their breakfast.  Yep, everything on the massive menu is good - but if you want the BEST (and the best bang for your buck) then breakfast is the way to go.  And be prepared to wait for a table on weekends. Breakfast specialities are served up in large cast iron skillets, an especially nice touch.  If you're wanting to eat on the lighter side, toast or a bagel will do the trick, and still becomes a breakfast of champions when paired with their fresh squeezed orange juice that's entirely worth the price tag.Heck - even Space Invader felt compelling to bestow one of his iconic murals on the  Waverly during his last NY outing.  Don't you think it's time you checked them out too??",1,1,1

She was indecisive on her food and decided to do takeout instead since we overheard she slept 3 hours in 2 days from business travels. The waiter for some reason was really rude about it and just ordered for her. Then, the young woman asked if she could get the other choice instead (all within seconds) and the waiter rudely said no - that the chef is already working. Again, it was seconds, so in any normal restaurant, this would have been no big deal.Then, the cashier starts yelling at the waiter, and the waiter starts trash talking about how indecisive the woman was, and starts mouthing off at her. This made the cashier start yelling. And the woman felt awkward and said ""hey don't worry about it, I don't need anything, thanks."" So that prompted the cashier to flick her off and shoo at her with his hand. This was so bizarre to witness. The woman was really smiley and courteous the whole time. I get it, it's late and she took a minute to decide, and she was dressed in business attire / probably came directly from work... But there were only two tables in the whole restaurant, and there is no reason to treat anyone that way, especially for just taking literally two minutes deciding between entrees. She seemed kind of timid and frightened by the whole rudeness, and we witnessed the whole thing as she exited. Then, the waiter and cashier mumbles things and calls her a sexist name and a racial slur. We weren't served yet, but we got up too. I've never felt compelled to leave because of treatment towards another customer, but wherever this woman is, I hope these assholes get their karma and learn to respect women of all colors and women in general.",1,,

38,Chris V.,"New York, NY",10,22,6,1.0,12/4/2017,"Waiters pad bills hoping you won't notice. Then get crazy defensive when you call them out on it. Time of visit: 4-5am Sunday morning 12/3Ordered jalapeno poppers and a burger deluxe with disco fries. Food came, ate... bill came for almost $40. Even with their already high prices, this was asinine. I rightfully question the bill. I say that he charged me separately for disco fries and the cheese burger, and did some creative inflating of the price all around. The waiter says, ""oh you didn't order deluxe so everything is separate"". I responded that I specifically ordered deluxe with disco fries, and that his explanation of it being separate still doesn't account for how high the bill was. He tells me repeatedly that he is right, raising his voice in a very unprofessional way. He then begins to stare me down as if this is some game, and has the audacity to say, ""oh you wanna eat but you don't want to pay.""No. I want to eat and I do want to pay - the price of what I ordered. The fair price, not the price of you trying to rip people off. Just charge me for what I actually ordered. I wasn't some wasted co-ed that you are used to scamming. He honestly seemed shocked that someone would call him out on his scam. He lowered my bill, slightly, to his warning that next time I need to ensure I specify deluxe (something I did). This wouldn't account for his price inflation all around, though. In conclusion, the waiter tried to scam me, and then got upset that I actually called him out on it. Then he tried to shame me for it. Real nice Waverly diner.",4,1,2

Otherwise I have had nothing but negative, bad energy from the staff of this place. Out of convenience in relation to my home, I have been here a number of times and none of these experiences resulted in any feeling of respect or warmth from the people working. On this particular night of September 19, 2017 (technically the 20th due to it being after midnight), my two close friends and I sought out the comfort of sweet potato fries while laboring over school work. As a prize to ourselves, we headed to the diner when we reached a point of near completion on our essay writing. Unrelated to this, All of our days had been rather negative in energy just by coincidence of rude strangers throughout. The strange drunk man who walked in and picked a fight with us, screaming racist, sexist, homophobic and ageist profanities at us only made it worse. There are many things that would have made this an ignorable battle. But the additional laughs of the waiters in concordance with the belligerent man must have been the least likely pathway for that. There was no empathy in this scene.  You never know what kind of day someone is having. It's so much easier to be kind than to be cruel.

However, this time was not in the ok realm. The deciding factor on this visit was the service again. Our server was abrupt, not courteous, talked over people while they were trying to talk to him, and gruffly barked out words which made him difficult to understand as well. I do take into account that it was Halloween night and maybe he had a rough one up to this point but that is not an excuse to treat everyone in such a manner. He made the diner experience here dismal. When the food came, it was mediocre at best. My French toast looked very appealing actually but had no flavor once I started in. Starving as I was, I made the best of it of course. Bottom line: Unsatisfactory diner experience here at Waverly. The server was not courteous or positive, and was very gruff as well as demanding.

Apparently ""Chicken Strips"" to them translates to rotting meat encased in crumbs from the kitchen floor, served alongside a vat of sauce made from the chef's rotting armpit juice. Four of these repulsive demon shafts were served along side three paper thin piss tasting strips of celery; probably a joke from the sadistic chef at my expense. I just wrapped crewing on a film shoot down the block and didn't have enough time to get outta dodge and find another place to chow. Suspended in a state of aural numbness (the ""restaurant"" had no music, just the sound of drones flapping their meat at each other), I shoveled this food down my throat, trying not to breath and accidentally taste this disaster. As I left, a member of the staff began chasing me, demanding I sign off on the bill, saying that ""tip is not included."" Yeah, I thought, they owed me at least $5 for having to do ALL of the work. When we entered, we had to seat ourselves, we had to force them to take our order, and we had to demand several times we get a check, which took over twenty minutes to receive. Twenty minutes, every second a painful fiery hell as the food ate its way through my stomach lining, poisoning my body and soul. At this point, I actually had my friend take a photograph of me beside the food to genuinely make sure if I died in 48 hours from time of eating, I would have some form of proof to prosecute them.

Really, they should head over to the Dirty JerZ  or Long Island diner to check out what a real plate of disco fries should be, which is piled high with plenty of cheese gooped over it and a hearty portion of sauce to dip into.   Overall prices were ok if on the pricey side for what we got.

77,Hannah H.,"Kokomo, IN",0,5,1,1.0,7/12/2017,"This place was highly reviewed for reasons unknown to me. First they claimed that my apt was too far away for delivery (I'm a less than 10 minute walk from the place) and when I got there they were taking delivery orders for addresses further than mine. Second, the Caesar salad was one of the nastiest things I've eaten. The lettuce was rotting and the dressing was absolutely disgusting, unlike any Caesar dressing anywhere else. The only good part was the grilled chicken. The marinara sauce is NOT marinara sauce, but tomato paste and basil that ends up tasting sickly sweet. The cost of the food was bogus and way over-priced for the crap they are serving. The service was also slow, as two patrons received their food when they ordered after I had arrived there from walking. Do not recommend. 24/7 businesses usually hold the key to my heart, but I would not recommend this joint to anyone.",,,
78,Sarah Z.,"Baltimore, MD",0,2,0,4.0,1/3/2017,"Went here at 4 in the morning after a long night out on Christopher St.My girl was having a bad case of the ""Oh no I just realized how drunk I am""'s.We ordered an OJ, as well as the breakfast deluxe with chocolate chip pancakes, two over medium eggs, 4 pieces of bacon and two bangers(sausages).Pancakes - incredible. Fluffy, huge, definitely buttermilk.Bacon - bacon is bacon. Huge, crispy, always delicious.Eggs - cooked totally right, but they don't add any seasoning whatsoever. No salt, pepper, etc. Which I was glad of, but just a heads up.Bangers - what a delightful surprise! I was expecting those weird little sausage links that come in the frozen jimmy dean packages. Pretty good stuff.OJ - real orange juice. No added sugar, but has a lot of pulp. I thought it was delicious, and my girlfriend who avoids pulp like the plague managed to finish half of it. ;-PSort of expensive, ended up being 25 bucks before the tip for just that. Not abnormal for the area, and it was definitely enough food for two people. Service is meh, but the place is almost always packed and we didn't really want to be bothered much.(The lost star is due to price and lack of service - we were thirsty mfs and had to ask every time for them to refill our tiny little cups, even though a server passed by us every 30 seconds or so.)I've heard from friends that their cheese fries and milkshakes also hit all the spots to cure/ease your hangover.Overall pretty great place for late night, above average diner food.",,,

We drink, we have many laughs, we make new friends. Then the hunger hits us like a ton of bricks. What better place than a 24/7 diner?! That's when we stumbled (no pun intended) into Waverly. It was pretty packed at 12am. But we managed to snag a spot for our group of 5. Like any diner menu, its unnecessarily LONG. It's some complex arrangement of the same items at different prices and different locations. And prices like $7.09. Random but classic diner ways. Waverly was no exception.I must admit, I'm a creature of habit when I eat post-drinking/debauchery. I crave several things:-Pizza (regular)-Fries (Damn you Papaya Dog)-Breakfast FoodsSo naturally I ordered breakfast at Waverly. LET ME TELL YOU. This wasn't easy. There must have been (I kid you not) 30 ways to make an omelet. Like why can't it be a BYOO -- Build Your Own Omelet!? Blasphemy. But nonetheless, I ordered egg whites with peppers, onions and cheddar cheese. It could be the beer talking, but it was delicious. Cooked just right and a good ratio of veggies to egg. It came with toast and hash browns which were great too. Our waiter was hilarious and really patient while I figured out my order. He was the star of the night. And all my friends were happily satisfied with their meals. If I'm in the area, I'll def be back! P.S. For all my LIRR friends, the A-train is right there. Win-win!",5,5,3

Updated review","In July it was said to be closed for a month. A month later in August, the new launch date was supposedly October. It's now nearing the middle of November and it seems the famous Waverly diner isn't set to open any time soon.The longtime diner has been one of the West Village's most well known businesses, known for it's endless supply of diner worthy food, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Waverly is supposedly in the midst of a major renovation, with major changes in store for it's interior with a modern makeover that it has so desperately needed. The iconic sign from the outside will remain on the other hand, so not all is lost.What brought me here to the Waverly is still the very thing that keeps bringing me back: hash browns. Sure, the IHOP chain has invaded NYC and reintroduced these shredded wonders back into the New York mainstream spotlight, but Waverly was one of the local pioneers that went against the homefries grain. It was the one place where I knew hope still existed for breakfast lovers like yours truly.And I still have hope for the Waverly to honor it's commitment to the community again. Please don't be closed forever Waverly, it will be an end to an era and a real blow to my quest of hash browns in NYC. Here's hoping for a roaring and inspirational comeback!",6,1,7

109,Faina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",271,3,3,3.0,3/1/2016,"Diners have a special place in my heart. There's something about antiquated ""leather"" booths, expansive and culturally diverse menus, and annoying fluorescent lights that puts a smile to my face. This is especially true when I'm hungry, and a diner just stands there majestically in all its establishment. So I was disappointed, nay, disheartened by the chocolate milkshake and the onion rings. Regardless of how you feel about my combination, these two options can't stand on their own anyways.    The chocolate milkshake was watery. I have high expectations towards milkshake taste and presence. On a scale of 1 to Michelle Kwan, it was 3.5.    The onion rings also lacked in many aspects. On the inside, they're very basic, stringy and white. On the outside, they're lightly fried and try to pass off as good fried onion rings but just fall short. People stand divided on this. On a scale of 1 to Rachel Dolezal, these onion rings might be her favorite.    The chocolate chip pancakes deserve honorable mention but my friend and I were being bothered by an elderly woman in the adjacent booth, claiming that Adam and Eve were violet aliens.",,,

Chicken fingers can be under cooked - don't expect an apology from anyone but congrats on that new salmonella infection.

Honestly, one must have to work at being that indifferent and disinterested, particularly in a place that draws such a diverse set of characters as patrons. Food was mediocre.  The gyro was awful--pre-pressed meat, the kind you'd get from the frozen food section in the grocery store.  The takizi sauce was bland.  My wife ordered the tuna melt and got decent tuna on white bread with pre-sliced cheese barely melted on top. The best things about dinner were the fries and the cole slaw.  And the price--the Waverly is priced right for what it is.

But, now, lets talk about the lack of customer service, the lengthy time that was involved in the visit and the not amazing diner food I consumed at 1 AM on a Saturday night.So first, the dudes don't smile in here. I guess I wouldn't either if I was serving food all the time at all hours to drunkards but, really, no hellos at all?! Second, it took forever for someone to come over and take our order. I'm talking about 10 minutes after we all had our menus down just waiting and looking around. C'mon now. It's 1 AM we want to eat and get the eff home. Lastly, the food. I wasn't impressed. Everything was subpar and could have easily been made at home. I ordered the turkey sausage, egg and cheese on whole wheat toast. The turkey sausage were links, and not tasty and overall the sandwich lacked a certain grease factor. I made it a deluxe for a few dollars more which involved fries. All 14 of them.My man ordered a $6 shake that was delicious albeit skimpy. Usually it's an overflowing glass with the silver blender vessel left overs for another 1/2 glass at least. This just was one glass. No silver container. It's ok, he doesn't need it but, just the fact. He ordered the monte cristo which was basically a ham and swiss melted over french toast. Legendary? One would think. It was decent. Could have been 10000 times better though if someone who cared made it.Again, not a horrible option to check out if you are starving and craving a lengthier sit down sustenance in this area. I wouldn't make this a destination.",6,5,3

We were inside Waverly diner and were seated immediately. The service is prompt and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. I ordered their veggie burger deluxe, which they burned real good upon my request. My husband ordered his favorite egg whites with ham and well done home fries with whole wheat toast.

What I got was an over cooked egg --who poaches an egg and over cooks the yolk?-- on top of a lack luster English muffin, covered in a watered down hollendaise sauce and a side of burnt yet under cooked at the same time home-fries. The worse part was the 'pepperoni' was just a pan fired slice of Bologna. I can't see myself ever coming back here. People were coming in regularly so this place must serve something good.

( one ill get weird looks, two i'll cost too much, and three....would i even finish everything?)So altogether; we ordered a stella beer, pasta with meatball (that comes a soup and salad), a buger with fries, calamari, and a basket of bread. 5 mins later we were told there was no more stella beer and no more calamari :( damn it!!! Oh, the soup was pretty okay. There were lots of rice in it and bits of chicken- not too salty as well so that's a plus. The salad came out as well- it was okay. Nothing special .I asked for the dressing to be put on the side, it wasn't on the side *sighs*So when the pasta with meatball came out it looked pretty nice. It was a nice display but the taste!! was a whole different story....a sad , sad story . The pasta with the sauce was tasteless and I only had a few bites before I told myself it's not worth finishing it at all. The meatballs were small- usually you get like one or two HUGE meatballs at the diner when you order the pasta of sorts ( I would know, I love me some pasta!! ) So there was four balls and they looked weird. Yeah,  I said it! It LOOKED weird and I only had a few bites since I was scared I would end up in the bathroom if I ate them. Beside, not looking decent to eat they weren't great or good at this point either. So at the end of the meal it looked like I barely touched my food......The service was okay- not much great.

Updated review","Have seen some horrible comments on here from people who make it sound like they are paying for a Michelin star restaurant. Get over yourselves.The Waverly is a diner and doesn't try to be anything else. The service is consistent and reliable, and if you are regular the staff never forget your face or what you order, even years later. Just because the staff don't kiss your a$$ does not equate to poor service. The Waverly is an old school NY diner that has survived the times with consistent, well cooked food and fast decent service.And I still say that the two best things on the menu that you should order every single time is the freshly squeezed orange juice and the breakfast sausages.The rest of you losers who are oh so not happy, should go find a McDonalds down the road, cause I am sure that is what represents value to the bleeding-hearts out there. Seriously.",6,5,2

The breakfast is always hot, fresh and delicious no matter what time of the day it is. The service staff is always very friendly and if you're a regular... They will always remember what you order. Not to mention they bring out your food with a smile and always follow up to see if you need anything else. Needless to say they aim to please. Burgers here are also must. They are huge and made to perfection. :) Last but not least, be sure to get the orange juice! It's freshly squeezed as you order it.Great to place to come with friends or just to sit and read alone. Love the new renovations! Will be back ASAP... As usual lol :)",3,,2
164,Alex L.,"Houston, TX",0,4,0,2.0,7/14/2017,"This place is NOT worth it at all. We went here because we were tired of walking and it was only a few steps away. First of all, all the waiters were standing around and not taking our order. It took about 20 minutes for someone to ask what we wanted to drink. The menu is so big and there are so many random items it's really hard to decide what to pick. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS. So one in my party got the roasted chicken and I got the ""meatloaf"". Both came with salads and my order came with soup and the other order came with a choice of potatoes and vegetables. The salads were lettuce with 2 tomatoes on them with a heap of dressing. Both the ranch and blue cheese tasted terrible and like they came from bottles you can purchase at the grocery store. The vegetable soup was okay, but there was barely any broth. When the entrées came out, they looked decent, not the best but alright. Definitely not worth the price. The ""meatloaf"" was more like Salisbury steak and it wasn't very good. It was dry and charred on the bottom with luke-warm gravy on top. Now the chicken was absolutely awful. It was like eating a spoonful of sand in the Arizona desert. The skin was tougher than leather and the stuffing underneath was terrible. Both mashed potatoes were cold and mine had huge chunks of unpeeled potatoes in it. Overall, this was a very disappointing dinner and we will never go back.",,,

The Waverly is open twenty-four hours, and the midnight crowd was a great mix of people, young and middle-aged, dumpy and hip, working-class and better off. There aren't too many places in NYC with such a diverse crowd. It is a classic diner, a dying institution in the gentrifying city. The decor probably hasn't changed in a half century and the servers are, like most at late night diners, brusque but efficient. The food was classic diner fare, with a typically huge menu. One of us ordered the steak and fries (and approved), one ordered a salad (a little disappointing), and I ordered the French toast which was satisfying.

Rude waiters who basically ignore you until you're almost done with the food, whereafter they hurry up with the bill - all without any smiles - they ruin the experience. The food is decent diner-food but no more than that. I've been here quite a few times for breakfast due to its location (and visitors who want to try American pancakes), but every single time the service is below acceptable.

Fun bonus: meals come in pans to give the restaurant that industrial vibe.",,,
178,Dan D.,"Farmington, CT",336,25,1,1.0,6/8/2015,I got a yelp account LITERALLY just to slam this place. The food was mehh-- that's not the real issue. The service was a trainwreck. This guy got my order wrong after I corrected him three times while he wrote it down. Then proceeded to wait another 15 minutes to bring me the right order. This place still does hand written checks and I think I know why... At the end of the meal he charged me $2.00 more than the menu price for the meal I ordered. I brought that up to the woman at the register and she didn't even offer to change the check to the ACTUAL price of the dish. I would have stayed to argue but I was kind of in a hurry. This place blows.,1,,
179,Paul C.,"Novato, CA",0,3,0,4.0,12/13/2013,"In New York just for the weekend and was looking for a local diner to have breakfast. Waverly had, for the most part, decent reviews and was close to my hotel, so I thought I would give them a try. The experience was great! Food was basic and hearty and a good value for the price. Food came out quickly and service was decent. Not a gourmet, boutiquey type place but definitely worth a visit.Enjoy!",1,,

They made that for ME. Lol! The customer service is exceptional. Very quick seating! I promise you the most you will wait is like 3 seconds. In addiction they bring your food super quick as well. Out waiter was very charming and funny. I can see myself frequently visiting Waverly whenever I'm in the area.",2,1,1

I'm not a super pick person, but I ordered grilled cheese and there was one single slice of processed cheese between two thick pieces of bread. It was disgusting, and they are very not sanitary with their handling of food.",,,
182,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",86,495,1595,3.0,2/16/2013,"3.5 stars.Look, Waverly will never give you an orgasmic culinary experience.  There is no salmon roe, no ramps, no grass fed beef, nor local artisan bread toasts.  The turkey, bacon, and cheddar cheese omelet that mom received was overcooked (no fluffy, jiggly, eggy protein), the bacon looked leathery and tasted like beef jerky, and the two slices of typical whole wheat toasts came with the usual individual packet of grape jam and imitation butter (not freshly churn, so sorry).  The hash, as others have lauded over was presented quite loose and not held together like a proper potato hash should be; also, french fries are charged extra? Should not they be mandatory with your burger or sandwiches? Nevertheless, there are still lots of warming properties that Waverly hands to us.  First of all, the mango smoothie we drank was fresh and thick, using REAL fruit and not the concentration junk.  It is a bit kitschy, but also cute to serve egg dishes in a skillet, rested on a wooden plate.  Nothing is oversalted, which is my pet peeve.  If you want me to drink more alcohol, just say so, do not do this inconspicuously by dumping sodium into my food.  Also, the best deal of a diner? Unlimited caffeinated refills.  I drank so many cups of decaf coffee that they might've created deficit from my consistent usage of toilet paper.  And I also have to give a holler to the cool waiters.  They are often hurried and omnipresent, but never show a sign of unfriendliness.  On top of that, they even service with a smile on their faces, which is rare in this industry.  Often waitstaff is so overworked that they might just want to dump the plates onto the patrons, but these guys looked happy (well, at least when I was there) to be at work.  Actually, it's a blessing to have a job now, so surely the waiters felt fortunate to make a decent living.  The space was renovated, but the booths and chairs are still very close knitted, but that just adds to the charm of this place.  The menu reads like a diarrhea dialog. You got your waffles, pancakes, omelets, burgers, triple decks, sundaes, Greek specialties, pasta...Look, Waverly is unique in its own special way.  It is conventional in an unconventional way, which is rearing on extinction with all the fad restaurants opening up every year.  Let's keep the old guys running in this city.  They define us as New Yorkers.  The authentic New Yorkers.",3,3,2
183,Lewis M.,"Manhattan, NY",36,35,20,5.0,7/26/2015,Amazing great breakfast! Eggs are served in a fry pan with delicious hash browns ( not home fries!). The hash browns are shredded potatoes and crispy perfect.  The diner for breakfast! A neighborhood gem! Tip: must eat at restaurant.... Getting the eggs in the fry makes the experience..... Better than take out!,,,

But while the people and place may be nice, the food is what ultimately matters. I went with my girlfriend once and were starving (note that when you starve, anything tastes good).I had the Yankee roast pot, which sounded epic. But upon arrival of my plate, I was somewhat disappointed by its size. The taste was OK, but it came with many other side dishes, which might score in a a few in its favor. Nonetheless, I have only been here once and might me judging too soon, but my review is based on my first experience and in the end, that is what matters to yelpers and their first experience too.",1,,

It's no BS, but the staff is friendly, the breakfast is unbeatable, the burgers are as good as anywhere, and the dinner entrees are generous.The ambiance has changed a bit. It used to look like the cover of a Tom Waits album in there, complete with pictures on the wall of long-forgotten actors. They are gone, but it still has some of that classic diner feel to it. I'll take what I can get.",2,,
188,Dan W.,"Long Beach, CA",21,3,0,1.0,8/2/2015,"Terrible. I have a nut allergy and the staff refused to check what oil they used to fry French fries in, instead saying ""I don't know what we use, and we can't take responsibility for anything that may happen"". I've heard the food is good, but if you have an allergy I would not recommend going here.",,,
189,Alexis C.,"New York, NY",50,26,0,5.0,2/20/2013,"I've been coming here for years with my parents, and now my friends. The staff are so friendly and remember you by name if you come by often enough. Their Romanian steak is top notch and makes me miss meat. My dad has been ordering the spinach pie for over 20 years and says it is the best he has ever had.They're open 24/7 which is an amazing plus. I have spent a few drunken nights sobering up with some thick cut french fries and a veggie burger. Also, all the egg come on big frying pans which is a nice touch. The owner Nick is usually there on the weekends and will make sure you have a good meal.",2,,

191,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,4.0,12/31/2010,"One other thing that goes into rating a place is not just the food, service and the atmosphere, but my expectation of it. I expected Waverly to be a diner with standard diner fare, and that's what I got. There was a short 5 minute-ish wait on New Year's Eve for brunch, and we were seated at the bar.The menu looked intimidating. An extremely long list of options, but really it's just the same few brunch ingredients mixed and matched around. I got a mushroom and ham omelet that came with a side of home fries and two slices of toast. My boyfriend got two breakfast sausages, two eggs, two slices of bacon, a Belgian waffle, and a side of home fries. The food itself was average. Nothing to shout about. Our waiter was skilled and attentive, and watching him effortlessly make drinks and prepare food to-go was quite a marvel.Our meal came up to $28 including a $4 tip. If you want a true diner experience, this place is the place to go. But don't get your hopes up on awesome cuisine.",2,,

193,Chris D.,"Leonia, NJ",376,513,883,3.0,10/21/2012,Mediocre.  generic diner food.  Slow service.  Water was never refilled even though it was vanquished within the first 2 min of sitting down.   Lots of older patrons eating here.Open 24/7 and located directly next to the subway stop. Was happy that the bacon cheeseburger deluxe came with a couple bonus onion rings.  clutch.,3,,
194,Barry G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,49,0,3.0,6/7/2016,"The egg omelette and especially the hash browns are very good. I did not care for the burgers here, very grisly with too much fat. The bread they use is very thick which is a disaster when you order a grilled cheese. Don't understand why the cooks use this thick bread. The soups are decent here. I'm afraid to order anything too fancy here judging by reviews from other diners that eat here. I never found the service slow here, which is opposite what many have said in their reviews. The bathroom is a smelly disaster which I complain to this place but nothing ever changes when I return to this bathroom on future visits. I think because so many people use the bathroom without eating here is the problem. They don't want to clean up the bathroom all day long. Prices are on the expensive side for the quality of the food served here.",,,
195,Marina R.,"Boston, MA",152,236,19,4.0,3/3/2013,"Whenever I walk into a diner - I never know what kind of experience I'll have, so I basically go in with no expectations at all. Luckily for me, I bought a groupon and decided to give Waverly a try one day. I'm happy to report that I had a great experience and the food impressed me (with only diner standards of course).  After looking over the ridiculously long menu (definitely an overwhelming task) My guy and I settled on some burgers, because we thought ""how could we go wrong?"" We ordered the waverly melt and a turkeyburger, both were so juicy and delicious. The huge cut steak fries were bomb too, seasoned and crispy - yum!Our service was fast, but we did have like 3 different waiters attending us- kinda strange but I guess thats how it is there. Long story short - solid diner, lots of options, kinda pricey with a great west village location. I'd return.",1,,

199,Erin D.,"New York, NY",894,342,58,3.0,8/1/2012,"Solid, consistent diner grub. Omelets served in silver skillets are generous in portion and have a highly respectable egg to cheese ratio (lots of egg with just enough cheese to flavor each bite). I like the slightly orange hash browns - they're not clumped together  nor dripping in grease, and they have a little flava to 'em (and a lot of carbs - dammit). Love the spacious, old diner-style ambiance and comfy booths. Sadly, Waverly ain't nothing special, y'all. The service is blehhh. It's like pulling teeth to get a coffee refill - makes it not worth ordering. Omelets aren't super cheap, and there are barely any options for more than 1-2 fillings. I want a veggie omelet with lots of stuff, y'know? Instead, I usually go for a mushroom and swiss egg white ommie for $11.50, although sometimes I want to go a little crazy and add spinach or some green peppers, perhaps? Or both? That'll be $2 extra for each one. Dayamn.Waverly: It's there, it's dependable, it satisfies - it just doesn't give me that lovin' feeling.",2,1,1
