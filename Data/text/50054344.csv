1,John S.,"San Diego, CA",2644,199,1121,5.0,10/23/2018,"Walking from Battery Park towards Wall Street, we found this little gem. We would have walked right past it if we didn't hear the live music coming from a guitarist/singer performing in the dining room/bar. We sat to the right of the bar, so we could hear the music and watch some football. The hostess and waiter were both nice and attentive. I wasn't expecting that since New Yorkers are stereotypically known as rude. I ordered a pork belly eggs benedict and it was pretty amazing! The pork belly wasn't too fatty and the bread they used in place of the English muffin was so soft and delicious. The mimosas were the perfect ratio of champagne to orange juice. The only thing I didn't like was that my breakfast came with French fries. A good complimentary side would have been breakfast potatoes or hash browns. Maybe it's a New York thing to eat fries with breakfast? I don't know. Overall, the ambience felt very New York and the live music made it even more enjoyable. I loved the brick walls inside and out... it gave it that old downtown vibe. The food did not lack taste, but the fries threw me off. Overall, awesome place to eat and have a drink! 5 stars all around.",25,14,24
2,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",58,132,516,4.0,10/18/2018,"Broadstone is solid. The food is great and the portions are solid.  It can get somewhat pricy but then again given the neighborhood it's standard. I'm all about the lobster bites, short rib tacos and the short ribs fries. Their nachos are also a delicious hit with me. My favorite bartender also happens to work here and he and his Irish accent serve up the best drinks downtown.  He alone gets five stars.  The hostesses are also fabulous and friendly.  They truly go the extra mile to make sure everyone is happy and having a lovely time.  There is a weekend bottomless brunch for an additional $22.00 you can drink your hearts desire so pick wisely.  Solid drinks and delicious food is a total win win.  Plus they are always packed for business.  Their menu is also a winner and surly one meant for exploring!!!I've been a patron of Broadstone for the past three years and have always left a happy customer.  They are consistent and I appreciate how the entire staff works as a team. Must add to bars & restaurants to try in FiDi!!!!!",2,,2
3,Michelle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",481,1246,6454,4.0,10/15/2018,"On a Saturday night around midnight, there were a ton of restaurants with kitchens open in FIDI. Thankfully the Broadstone Bar and Kitchen was. I don't just say that because I was hungry. I probably wasn't looking for American food, but ended up really liking my meal.If you've read any of my previous reviews, you can catch a theme. I love goat cheese and I love lamb. A lamb burger with goat cheese was a no brainer. They let me sub the fries for a side salad. I also had a nice pour of a merlot to go with my meal. There was a ton on the menu and I think I'd have fun exploring more. This is a good place to keep an eye on if you are feeling American food in FIDI.",4,1,2
4,Jose C.,"Woodside, NY",113,50,236,5.0,9/17/2018,"Love coming here when I'm in the wall street area of the city, great atmosphere and never had a bad meal. I was here a week ago but never got a chance to write a quick review. A majority of the time I come here I always get the grill chicken sandwich,  I've had other dishes before but this was the last thing I had so I'm only commenting on this. The food is always good here, I've never had a bad meal, the waitress is very nice and can reccomend something if you are not sure what to get. If you sit at the bar the bartender is very cool and funny and makes the drinks just right   Well if you are in the area, make sure you stop in for a quick bite, you won't regret it.",,,

Perfect location right across from the hotel, sitting on a corner busy enough to people watch but calm enough not to distract you from conversation at your table. We were quickly greeted and seated. We ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich, French toast burger and the Avocado toast. Everything was delicious! My son said his burger was the best burger he had ever had!

9,N. B.,"New York, NY",0,26,0,4.0,11/15/2018,"We stopped by for a quick lunch. Love the decor. We were seated by a window so we had a great view. I ordered the steak sandwich and garlic fries. The sandwich was pretty good. The fries were delicious. My husband had the Broadstone burger. He said the flavor was good but it was kind of one of those burgers that falls apart when you are eating it. Again, tastes good you just end up eating it with a fork.",,,
10,Alison B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",80,160,23,3.0,7/19/2018,"This place is conveniently located at the corner of Broad and Stone Streets...  ironic , I know.  :)Easy to find and visible from far away.  It's a tri-level restaurant with stairs...  so avoid this place if you dont like stairs.Food was so-so.  Nothing special.  We had a feta salad, burger and flatbread.  Best thing on the table was honestly the French fries.  Everything else was just average.  Service was fine... but not as attentive as I would have liked.It's perfectly fine if you're nearby and hungry, but don't expect to be dazzled.",,,

13,Jeannine M.,"Bayside, NY",17,358,35,3.0,9/6/2018,"I have been here for drinks and separately for lunch. The lunch options are a nice portion. There are healthy options to choose from. I'm not so sure on flavors, nothing really stands out.",,,
14,Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",155,183,45,5.0,12/30/2017,"I randomly noticed this place while walking around and decided to give it a try for dinner. Being that it was almost 11 o'clock, it wasn't as busy as it was earlier. They were able to sit us right away, on the 2nd floor. Having 3 levels definitely helped to make sure we were able to find a spot and quickly. Since it was late, we only got a few different appetizers, along with a few drinks. Although there were quite a few tables full, the waiter was very attentive, checking in on us quite often, without a single time having to flag anyone down, or a completely empty glass. The food was great as well. We went with just the appetizers, which were all exceptional: Mac n cheese bites, shrimp tacos, meatball lollipops & buffalo chicken spring rolls. The food was very fresh, hot, right out of the kitchen, featuring great combination of different flavors, which once blended with the specialty sauces for each dish were pretty amazing. It's a unique, creative spin off on modern american food. The plating and presentation was pretty great as well. The prices for the food and drinks was pretty reasonable. Given, we didn't get any entrees or main course meals, it was all very filling, definitely exceeding my expectations. Everything combined, with the exceptional service we received, this place is deserving of solid 5 stars. I will be back again to visit this place and hopefully check out some of the other items on their menu.",,,
15,Johana D.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,85,62,5.0,4/12/2018,Visited Broadstone back in March 2017 after a very long day trip around Manhattan. We ordered a few dishes but app the tuna was the popular dish among my group. (I don't eat seafood). My choice was the charcuterie and cheese board. As you can see from the picture it was just as good as it looks. The next popular dish were the meatballs with blue cheese. We also ordered a flatbread pizza and some sweet potato fries....side note when I asked for maple syrup for the fries our Irish waitress had no clue why I was asking for it!!! Very cool spot to hangout and have a few drinks.,1,,1
16,Candice L.,"Cincinnati, OH",364,40,102,4.0,11/2/2017,"We were in the financial district and in need of a quick bite to eat. The bar has 3 levels, and was very busy during the lunch hour.  There would have been a longer wait for a table for 4, so we opted to eat at the bar. We were served our drinks quickly. I opted for a cocktail called the Zombie, complete with a gummy brain as a garnish.  It was absolutely delicious.  I ordered the grilled chicken wrap for lunch, but was mistakenly brought a chicken sandwich instead.  They fixed my order right away so that I was still able to dine with the rest of my party.  The food is your typical bar fare, but we all left satisfied.",,,
17,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,204,100,4.0,3/28/2018,"This is a cool bar in the financial district right off of stone street. The space is huge--there are three stories, so this is a great choice for group happy hours. Our table only got appetizers, but I would recommend the French fries, margarita flat bread, nachos, and buffalo wings. Everything we had was great quality bar food and not overly oily or fatty. This place is a lot of fun in the summer time, when they open up the windows on all of the floors. I would recommend coming here if you want to host a group, because seating is plentiful and the space is not too crowded.",,,
18,Elizabeth K.,"New York, NY",297,141,53,4.0,9/11/2017,"My friend and I were heading over to stone street pubs and noticed this place, so we decided to go somewhere we've never tried before. We learned that they've been open for a year! They had the windows open because it was a beautiful night and a lovely musician.We sat at the downstairs bar, ordered a couple beers and a sandwich and eggplant chips. My friend loved the chips...I didn't really care for them but the pork sandwich was yummy.Prices were definitely nyc average, not a bargain by any means. Bartenders were pretty nice.Would come back for the music and nice atmosphere.",,,
19,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10947,4.0,7/6/2017,"I've been watching this place slowly being built and eventually open for months with working nearby and always making a conscious effort to go walking on my lunch break. It's one of the more noticeable new spots downtown with open windows to the streets, beer flowing from taps as you gaze in longingly thinking 'Gooooood a beer for lunch would be soooo goood"". So finally I went with a few friends for brunch on the weekend. Broadstone has an unlimited boozey deal for $19 with the purchase of a meal. The strawberry bellinis I'm just going to leave here are bomb. I didn't try the mimosa but seeing it poured out it was transparent and super alcoholic the way I like them. Their regular cocktail menu - amazing. Some of the best drinks I've had in awhile from any place. My personal favorites were the Kale Me Crazy (who knew kale juice was freaking delicious as hell), and the Rosebud that had fresh rosemary in a gin concoction. Service was fantastic and extremely prompt. Everyone here is insanely friendly. For my meal I ordered the Hangover sandwich - comprised of fried eggs, Applewood smoked bacon, and jack cheese on a ciabatta roll. I went with a side salad instead to be 'healthy' and they still brought out extra fries because they care. lol. My friend went with the salmon benedict that actually came out on huge slabs of texas style toast (something different I've not seen with benedicts before) and her fiancee went with the traditional Irish breakfast - eggs complete with black and white puddings and baked beans. Food was all decent. I didn't taste a home run, slam dunk. But nothing was bad either. Definitely think it's a solid place for cocktails and beers though after work or for taking advantage of those delicious strawberry billinis on the weekend.",6,2,4

22,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,1059,8595,4.0,5/31/2017,"Great bar with a lively atmosphere, good food and an indoor/outdoor environment.Hurricane Sandy was definitely the worst natural disaster that hit NYC and even though many businesses had to close due to the damage it caused, many new or refurbished businesses also sprung up as a result ... and here's where Broadstone fits in.For those in the area, it is well known that a pizzeria once occupied this space. After a few years of renovations, up sprang this spacious and cool-looking bar/restaurant.The 1st thing that really stood out about this bar was it's unique-looking shape. Broadstone is rectangular in shape with 3 floors to it --- with all the floors closed in by windows that could be open during the spring, summer. The views aren't the greatest from the inside as all you really see is Broad Street and what's happening in the surrounding blocks, but it's still a view and gives those inside a breath of fresh air. It's basically the best of both worlds - indoors and outdoors.For anyone not interested in the views of the FiDi, there are multiple flat screen TVs for those looking to catch a game or just sit by the bar and watch some TV.As for the food and drinks -- on par with any good bar/restaurant. The drinks were typical of the area and they had a good selection of beers and liquor to choose from. The bar food was pretty good too. I've had a chance to try the Everything Pretzels, Beef Sliders and Eggplant Chips and all were excellent.Even though Hurricane Sandy was a terrible event, I'm glad that some ""good"" (for what it's worth) came out of it in a new bar/restaurant like Broadstone. And hopefully businesses like Broadstone thrive for years to come and continue to bring life to the area.",10,3,4
23,Julie W.,"New York, NY",16,39,17,4.0,7/20/2018,"Came for a quick lunch with reservations and were seated very quickly with a smile from the hostess. The restaurant/bar is on 3 levels so seating is pretty abundant, at least for lunch. We were seated on the 2nd level balcony that overlooked the streets below - Great views!  The sun and gentle (sometimes stronger) breeze were just want we needed for some proper de-stressing and relaxation during the middle of our workday.  The ambiance and the environment was very nice. The great weather also played a role too! Since it was lunch, we didn't order any alcohol so I can't comment on the drink selection. The food came really fast, but it was really pricey for the area. We had 2 orders of the Chicken Cobb Salad and 1 order of the Salmon sandwich, all were priced at $17 each. Funny enough, the menu mistakenly listed the Burger as only $1. Considering the prices of the other menu items, we knew there was another number missing. I didn't think the salad was anything special but my other friends really enjoyed their food.",,,

I ordered an eggs benedict but I received a moisty sandwich served with moisty french fries. I would probably make this better at home even though I'm a terrible chef.

After a bit we ordered the eggplant chips and it was drizzled with honey that we weren't expecting but the waitress was extremely nice and took it back and didn't charge us for it.The place is slightly pricey but is good for groups and their drinks are quite good. I'd comeback here again in the future.",4,1,
27,Laurie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,44,49,5.0,8/25/2018,"This place is great. Especially when the weather is nice because they keep the windows open and if you sit on the top you get a nice breeze and view. My last visit was by myself.. the service was great, very attentive even though they were super busy. I ordered a salad that came with pecan crusted baby goat cheese and I ordered salmon with it for an extra $7. The dish was amazing! When my food came I thought I had falafel on my plate but long and behold it was the pecan crusted baby goat cheese. Such a great idea and very complimenting taste. My salad also had artichoke, roasted peppers, and arugula leaf. I ordered a glass a of froze. It was a little watery than I remember it the  previous time I came but it was still refreshing.",1,,1

The meatballs tasted like they were made with good ingredients and the execution of them seemed ok (though they lacked velvet-y-ness) but they still weren't actually good tasting (and again were too sweet).Service from our waiter was ok (but he failed to convey to the kitchen our request to have garlic fries not plain) but not from the busser.",,,

Sauce on the wings was GREAT and pizza was very good.The location is in a nice area and was a corner bar, so plenty of windows. The whole side wall of the bar was sliding glass and we got to enjoy the perfect weather from inside while they had all of the walls open to the outside.The GM was walking around conversing with the patrons and stopped to talk to us for some time. His name was Jarek and he was even kind enough to give us the names of a few other bars he likes to frequent in Brooklyn because that was our next stop.The bartender, Kim, was a very personable host and we had fun with her.

The buffalo chicken spring rolls are tasty and nicely done. The chicken sammich is white meat and a good amount of food. The staff is helpful and obliging, like agreeing to put everything in a sandwich on the side. They forgot about the tea we ordered, but got it quickly when we mentioned it to the server, so it was probably the fault of the person taking the orders. It's a big space, taking up 3 floors, so it has good event spaces for different size events.

The last brunch seating is at 3:25 so be aware of that.  90 minute all you can drink option was 19 bucks but you're limited to the typical brunch cocktails.My wife's breakfast flatbread was awesome but my steak and eggs were missing salt and pepper. I added some on after the fact but it was still a careless oversight. The service was excellent for the most part.  I ordered one beer and my wife got the all you can drink option.  Half way through my meal I was given a beer refill which I didn't ask for.  I thought that was awesome! Then I got the check and saw that I was charged for it.  It was the first time in a long time that I tipped under 20%.

Something for everyone. They also have a bottomless drinks. What really drew me to this place was the price. Most of Brunch places in NYC are super expensive but at Broadstone most of the dishes were under 20 dollars. They also have live music starting at noon.

My friends got the flatbread, avocado smash and pancakes.Cons: the bottomless mimosas were pure champagne and the service was not great. We were one of two tables there with4 servers. After we finished our first drink, they didn't give us refills until we waved them down. They were sitting at the bar talking and eating snacks....and when we told our waitress to split the checks, she brought over one check. The staff working just didn't listen or seem to care even though it wasn't busy at all.Even the table next to us had their order messed up. They left after about 30 minutes of being there because of the service.I'm not sure if it's always like this, but just a heads up.",1,1,1

The bartender was great and the place is clean and offers a good space. We ordered heinekens and stella's, both at $7 which isn't too bad. To start we had the buffalo egg roll, I would not recommend, they look a lot more appetizing on the menu, in reality not good.I had the beef burger with jack cheese and bacon, very good and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the wings and garlic fries which he devoured they were so good. The garlic fries are absolutely AMAZINGGGGG totally recommend.What makes this place even better is that they offer 7% cash back via yelp. We spent $90 in total and got $7 cash back jast because my card was linked to yelp, hell yeah i'll take $7 cash back.Cool Irish bar with good food!!!",,,

I would describe this as upscale Irish pub meets New Orleans.  Fans of hgtv show fixer upper will like all the wood.  There bathroom was five star as except for small toilet would copy in my place.Beer choices are the now standard craft and local brews. For there beers from boroughs list I would like them to state which are draft or not. I liked Yonkers Vienna but try to get drafts at bars as can drink Bottles at home.My Guinness was okay but wish let sit for two minutes before topping off. I had one cocktail. Instead of calling it a Moscow mule they have my mule with choice of liquor.  Mine was fine but bartender was obviously new and making it off of recipe.Food menu is standard fare.  Draw of this place will be window seats in 2nd and3rd floor especially those with views of water.,3,1,

60,Lauren P.,"Manhattan, NY",21,119,149,5.0,4/11/2017,"Sunday brunch review!This place is a fantastic find down in the Financial District. It is a great spot especially if you want to listen to some live music while you're eating and also if you would like to walk around the financial district before or after you eat.I had the breakfast waffle sandwich and my boyfriend had the brunch burger. We both did the bottomless deal. Bottomless - the mimosas and strawberry Bellinis are delicious and we highly recommend this option. The servers are great at noticing when you need a refill and don't hesitate to get the next drink in your hand - LOVE THIS because some places are difficult to get the next drink when you're doing bottomless. Breakfast waffle sandwich - wow! This was the star of the show. My boyfriend was so jealous, even though his was delicious too. The cheese, waffle, egg, avocado and bacon combo is fantastic and the maple syrup really ties it all together. The perfect combo of salty and sweet for brunch. I have dreams about this sandwich.Bench burger - this is a great burger. I was so consumed with eating my whole waffle that when I tried my boyfriend's burger I was a little bit sad we didn't split both right down the middle. But then I remembered how good and unique my sandwich was. The burger is fantastic and we also recommend it if that's what you're looking for!",2,,1
61,Shani F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,46,0,3.0,10/8/2017,"Had dinner after going to a show. The bar area seemed to be the only part that was open so we ate there with the loud music and televisions on in the background. Not great for having an easy conversation. The service was attentive so we may have been able to get the staff to turn the music down if we'd asked. My friend ordered one of their special October drinks: enjoyable but very little booze. She had the steak sandwich which she said was great. I ordered the lamb burger, which is one of the best I've had. It was cooked well and the goat cheese was a well chosen flavour enhancer.A word to the wise: if you don't like eggplant, don't order the fried eggplant chips. It's just a fried version of something you're really not into in the first place. I would go back when they're not showing both football and baseball games.",2,,1

We had to tell the waitress to hurry our orders because we had waited so long and no sign of our food coming. All other tables were served before us even though they came after us.

As I watched the bartender, hostess and another guy stare and stank eye us. After about 5 minutes or more the bartender told my husband the tables were table service only and we had told the hostess we were going to sit in the bar. we said okay and asked for menus. Which were delivered by a young lady (hostess) who really shouldn't have a job where she interacts with the public. The most rude, unfriendly person EVER!! After she rudely left our menus I looked at my husband and said let's go! We left. I am never going to recommend a restaurant or bar that serves tourists or anyone else in that manner!!

I was not disappointed in the least. I was immediately seated at the bar and offered a drink. I ordered their ""Broadstone"" ale which was local and great. I then moved on to wine, and the female bar tender was awesome in letting me try 2 different red wines before deciding what I wanted to order. I then ordered the fried fish sandwich (Tuesday special) which came with fries and coleslaw. The fries ordered were not just basic, you could order normal fries (which I got and were excellent) or garlic fries or sweet potato fries. The fried fish sandwich was perfectly crispy fried fish, my only wish was that it came on a softer roll than ciabatta (personal preference) as the fish slid out of the bread. The flavor was excellent though and I would order it again. Overall, being alone in NYC on a business trip, eating alone felt less lonely here as the atmosphere was lively and vibrant. I just wish I had my friends here to enjoy the happy hour with me. I will certainly return for dinner on my next business trip to the city. Try it out!!",,,

(On both occasions, we went there after catching a movie at the Oculus Plaza, which is kind of cool. But their food selection isn't terrific - Eataly selling popcorn? - But that's another story.) The first time we went, the hostess went upstairs with us to see if we liked that bar's ""vibe"" better - now that's what I call service. But we ended up at the first floor bar. The second visit, we knew the routine, so we went straight to our ""usual"" seats at the bar. It was kind of busy, but the ""Thursday-night-booze-up"" crowd thins out around 10. And while they were loud at times, they weren't obnoxious. The bartenders are pretty laid back. We requested a couple of substitutions for the menu items and they were cool with it. The burgers are good -- decent size and they don't skimp on the goodies. It's the summertime, so the windows were open on both nights, which make it feel much larger than it is. They also have live music on Thursdays (they may have it other days, but I'm not sure) on the first floor, which is why we chose it originally, and the guy is really good. If you're in the area, it's well worth checking out any night of the week. But Thursday, so far, is my favorite.",,,

I ordered the lamb burger with goat cheese and garlic fries and my brother had the salmon wrap with garlic fries. Both dishes were good. My lamb burger was cooked medium well and it was perfect...filled with juice and a huge portion. The fries were good as well, although I wish they would've been paired with some aioli sauce.

The restaurant had lots of space and plenty of windows to take in the INCREDIBLE views of Lower Manhattan. The drinks were superb--I even got a little buzz after one drink--that hardly ever happens. Try the Autumn Old Fashioned--superb! The food was great and the burger was really tasty! Service was great--our waitress was from Ireland. My friends said they are putting this on the list of favorite restaurants in New York City. Highly recommend!!,,,

The place was nice & they had a pretty good selection of adult beverages.  Our server was attentive and was very good at answering our questions on the menu.  Unfortunately the food was average at best.  We really had high hopes - but ultimately were disappointed.  I think if you want to come for some drinks - possibly for happy hour this would be a good spot.  I just wouldn't recommend for a meal.,,,

The delicious Mac and Cheese Balls melt in your mouth!

121,P N.,"Boston, MA",1,40,0,5.0,2/19/2018,Cute little spot. So glad I took yelps advice and gave this place a try for lunch. The cocktail menu is really nice and had a little bit of everything for everyone. The mega-mule was really tempting but I might have to save that for next time. I got the Peach Palmer and man was that delicious! The buffalo chicken spring rolls were SOOO GOOD. There was a lot of filling and it was actually addicting. I still think about them... Any ways I also got the Pecan crusted goat cheese salad and that was the bomb dot com. It was a never ending salad. Everything was fresh and our server was great. I would definitely come back here!,,,

Waitresses and bus boys were wonderful and polite. However I have to give this place a 3 because we saw managers talk to 3 tables around us but never come to our table. The only thing we could think of was that we were in ""travel clothes"" (shirts, jeans and pony tails). The place seemed great until we noticed that we were not up to par to be talked to.",3,1,
124,Vikas B.,"WALL STREET, NY",1,8,0,2.0,8/27/2016,"We decided to wander into this place on the way to the pier. Very inviting from the outside - looks very clean. We decided to order some cocktails at the bar (~$13 a piece) -  cucumber gimlet, Mojito, and American Sazerac. The bartenders seemed very new and took some time to prepare the cocktails. Which is ok - however both the cucumber gimlet and mojito were not made correctly. The Cucumber gimlet- Imbalanced, no sweetness and quite on sour due to the overpour of lime juice. Additionally, either the manager (or owner?) took a straw - reached over the bar and tasted the gimlet after it was served to us... not the greatest etiquette. Usually you straw taste prior to delivering the cocktail to the guest. You're suppose to muddle the lime, sugar, and mint when making a mojito. However none of this was done. What was done instead was mint, a ton of lime and very little sugar was mixed with club soda.. making it very sour and no mint flavor came out. The american sazerac was actually pretty good.. balanced well, but it definately wasn't a sazerac... it was some variation with rum & rye?We will come back again to try it out. But our initial visit wasn't worth the $40 dollars we paid in cocktails.",4,2,

It was expected considering that they had an open bar of all top shelf drinks and beer on tap as well as mixed drinks for three hours on top of providing a variety of appetizers which were of course hoarded by the hungry mobs of FIDI peeps who were chugging down drinks like water.  The venue is nice, has a few levels and the music was on point too.  Will definitely go back on a regular night for some grub and happy hour drinks.",1,,

I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you bring your own timer to your table  because you will get passive aggressively grilled. Also, the waitress did not do a last call in regards to our unlimited drinks and only engaged in conversation when we were speaking about other guests in the establishment.

The first time we visited, I ordered the bottomless and had a new drink hit my table before or just as I was finishing my current drink, which was great! The second time we visited, they seemed understaffed and we waited at the hostess stand for a full 5 minutes before anyone came up to seat us and there were two other parties in line behind us at that point. The service was pretty slow that day as well, but we did not order cocktails so can't say if they would have been paying us closer attention if we had. All told, it was definitely forgivable and was likely just an understaffed Saturday afternoon. The waffle sandwich on the brunch menu is awesome.

Our server greeted us and proceeded to take 10 minutes to bring over two glasses of water. We ordered and he then realized he accidentally brought us lunch menus instead of dinner menus. It took 10 minutes for him to bring over dinner menus (wouldn't think that would be so hard at dinner time). He returned 5 minutes later and took our order. Five minutes after that (10:50 at this point) our served apologized that he didn't realize the kitchen actually closed at 10:40 and that there was nothing he could do. I am confident that the cook hadn't gone home between 10:40 and 10:50 and this situation could have been rectified with a little customer service especially since the slow water delivery, menu mixup and misinformation weren't our fault.
