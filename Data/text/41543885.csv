0,Anthony F.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,72,19,4.0,9/30/2018,"Just went to the Dutch for dinner and quite honestly, the drinks and food that I ordered were a bit underwhelming. First off we had one of the specialty cocktails and it just didn't have the kick that you would expect from a $16 cocktail. We had the ceviche as an appetizer and it was a bit bland. We actually added salt to it to give it a little bit of flavor. My wife had the lamb and she thought it was good. I had the gnocchi and was really disappointed. It was also really bland and had very little flavor. For the price, I would not recommend the Dutch.",1,,
1,Nicole W.,"San Francisco, CA",247,275,99,3.0,10/21/2018,"I visited the Dutch for weekend brunch and the place was a hot mess. Even with a reservation, I waited at least 15 minutes behind a crowd of people to get checked in. The hostesses seemed understaffed and stressed. Overall the food was good, not great. The menu had limited options to choose from. I opted for the shrimp salad. Perhaps I would have better luck with a different dish.The service was very hit or miss. While our waiter was attentive throughout the meal, trying to find my lost sunglasses was a whole different ordeal. When I reported my lost item one woman was completely unhelpful. She said no one had turned anything in and didn't take my number down. I went back to the counter again and another woman was much more understanding. She logged the lost item along with my name and phone number. She even went back to the table to check and see if they were on the seat. I really appreciated her making an effort to find the lost item. There are so many brunch options in New York, I would recommend going elsewhere. The service here felt like a gamble.",,,
2,Shayan S.,"Oakland, CA",24,187,79,4.0,8/5/2018,"Glad I went there.Went there with a large group for a mid week birthday celebration. It's in a fun area. The staff was really friendly, and so helpful and accommodating. They took lots of photos for us. We were loud, and closed down the restaurant and they were very patient with us. The food was really good for ordering a bunch and sharing it. I enjoyed everything and can't complain about anything.",1,,
3,Ann J.,"Farmington, MN",163,460,476,5.0,11/14/2018,"Had an excellent business lunch with a colleague... the only thing that would have been better would have been if we could have ordered a bottle of wine to go with our meal (but we couldn't... we were working).  We split a bowl of the white bean soup (they were kind enough to serve it in 2 smaller bowls), and then I enjoyed the lobster roll sandwich... yummy!  The only thing I didn't love was the brussels sprouts... just not as flavorful as what I have had at other places. All in all though... a great meal and a very classy environment.  I highly recommend.",,,
4,Abbey B.,"Elmont, NY",39,91,567,4.0,9/24/2018,"This restaurant has a nice ambiance. The prices are on the high side. My friends and I came here for a drink, since I'm not a huge drinker I ordered dessert. It was $14 for a shaved ice dessert with fruit. So pretty much $14 for water. It was good but definitely not $14 good. The entree menu started in the $30's. This place is definitely for those who don't mind spending that much on food. None of the food had an impeccable presentation so I personally wouldn't dine here. I did enjoy hanging with my friends here and they also had good music.",,,1
5,Elizabeth M.,"Austin, TX",255,79,121,5.0,10/21/2018,"One of my favorite NYC restaurants in the fall. Dark wood and leather seats arranged in open booths that are perfect for cozying up to your lover and friends in the colder months. My brunch go-to is the everything bagel with lox, eggs and fish roe. The roe adds the perfect salt kick to each bite. Paired with a mimosa. My friends love the fried chicken, biscuits, burger, and flapjacks, though we've never gone wrong with the fresh cheese omelette either. One of the classic old SoHo restaurants. I highly suggest making a reservation.",,,
6,Mahesh P.,"Austin, TX",14,335,1295,4.0,4/16/2018,"Great cocktails, really good comfort food, trendy, and *pricey*.The cocktails are great - really. They change with the times, and the quality is usually very very high. So yeah, worth it for the cocktails.The food is ""new american comfort food"", but hipster-y, basically with a twist in one form or the other. So, you'll get stellar steak, with kimchee-fried rice, or grilled halibut with rice noodles served bun-cha style, or fried-chicken korean-style - you get the point.The place is very much a ""see and be seen"" kinda joint, where all the beautiful people go. That said, there is no snobbishness, they're always friendly, and happy to see you there.The only downside - the prices are up there. If it was around 20% less expensive, I'd be there all the time...",,,
7,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,5.0,1/25/2018,"Note: This review is for a private event.I came to The Dutch during the holidays for a private event. They have a cozy, well-decorated event space downstairs, with a dining table set up and its own little bar. It was the perfect size for our ~20 person party. Mingling at the beginning was a little difficult as the table took up most of the space, but most of the event was seated. The bathroom is also downstairs, which is convenient.The food was a mix of decadent and healthy-ish, your standard contemporary American. Looking at the menu, I don't know if I would be willing to pay their elevated prices for it myself, but all dishes were good and some excellent. I particularly enjoyed the desserts.It was open bar and the house wines were all solid, as well as the house cider. They also were making simple cocktails for people and we had some high end whiskey before we left (had to hit that budget).Staff was great. They were attentive at the beginning for serving drinks, hanging coats, etcetera, but also knew when to leave us alone.I would imagine private events get pricey here, but if it's in your budget I would recommend The Dutch.",3,1,2
8,Sarah C.,"Sydney, Australia",98,457,3529,5.0,7/25/2018,"A cool Bistro with a great drinks list, the sevice at this establishment was on point, allowing a sample of the whisky before purchasing a dram. We ordered a summer crusher cocktail and were sipping away, only to be informed the wrong cocktail was delivered. This turned out to be a blessing as this mystery cocktail we enjoyed more than the actual summer crusher, that was also provided to make up for the error. Having eaten prior to visiting, we ordered a beef tartare to share, a very good version of this dish and we were also impressed with the house made bread, the jalepeno corn bread was the bomb!",,,
9,Wendrich J. M.,"New York, NY",77,162,518,4.0,12/12/2017,"The Dutch is probably overrated, but I would still give it a good review. I have been there many times before I was a Yelper, but I recently came back and checked-in. I would say that even though we had a reservation we had to wait like 20 mins for our table. So many maitre ds, and yet very disorganized.I am not sure if they change the menu for the season, but I found that the brunch menu was QUITE limited, the things that I was expecting to be in the menu, that I have tried there before were gone. Anyway, the few dishes still keep their quality, flavours and authenticity. We enjoyed our meals and had a good time.Our waiter was somehow in a bad mood, we never asked for the bill and he rushed it. However, I asked him to bring us the donut tree after he place the bill on the table (why would he assume we finished without asking first) so annoying.Besides that we kind of explored the different plates and good music.",9,2,2
10,Mica S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",78,5,0,1.0,11/3/2018,"Such an unfortunate experience. Terrible service, moody hostess, miserable place. To be honest, do not go here we all deserve better.",,,
11,Jade B.,"Brooklyn, NY",251,147,460,3.0,11/12/2017,Was able to walk in and get a seat by the bar on a Saturday afternoon.  I watched as they chucked oysters in front of me while waiting for my food. Ordered:Cocktail: Hot Tin Roof ($16)Main: Calamari Salad ($23)The spices they used in the fried calamari was delicious and the cocktail was strong. A bit pricey for a salad and drink though.,2,1,1
12,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",103,79,341,1.0,4/14/2018,"I came to this restaurant because of the doughnut tree reputation, but the whole brunch turned out to be disappointing and frustrating from my point of view. Will not recommend this place or come again. First of all, the food is just so-so. The doughnut tree we ordered seemed too sweet, I cannot finish even one piece.Moreover, the more important thing, the service here is weird. I have never experienced this thing before at a restaurant, when customers have not yet finished their brunch, the waiters came for at least four times and asked: Are you guys done? Can we take away the plates? I understand that there are people waiting outside, but it should never be the reason that the waiters came too often to interrupt customers. It's rude and impolite to push your customers and ask them to leave. Also, very annoying. Third thing, maybe it was just an accident, but the restaurant went thru two transactions on my credit card....Very disappointed lol.",5,2,1
13,Lissan C.,"New York, NY",24,118,361,5.0,10/19/2017,"Great spot for brunch, lunch or happy hour time. Great energy and vibe!I had a plan to try their famous fried chicken and finally I did & was not disappointed at all. Crispy, crunchy, juicy inside and well seasoned! I also love love love the sweet sugar snap salad with peaches and macadamia nuts, it was special and unforgettable. I can't get this dish out of my mind. It was fresh, crunchy, healthy, nutty, flavourful and with natural sweetness. Such an amazing dish. Service was good, attentive, casual yet professional.Will be back for sure!",2,1,3
14,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,3.0,4/14/2018,"Stopped by for lunch.  Not sure if $22 for a burger is a good deal.  I had the home-made ravioli which was good but not special. Came with a side of corn bread which was just OK. Some decent Italian bread would have been an improvement.Sat at the bar.  Bartender was friendly, professional.   Five craft beers on tap - I had a Bronx pale ale which was fine.Place seems nice, better than the average bar/grill.  Lots of staff.  Popular for a Thursday lunch but out of my normal price range.",1,2,1
15,Fareeda A.,"Long Island City, NY",259,128,65,4.0,11/2/2017,"Came here for a work lunch with a group of seven on a Thursday at around 12:30. First impression is that this restaurant is HUGE! I love that it has a nice ambiance about it, but they're still able to serve a large amount of guests. We sat in their back area that was open and had a mixture of booths and regular tables.THE FOODEGGPLANT DIP WITH SAVORY CRACKERS: The savory crackers were DIVINE and such a perfect pairing for the eggplant. This is a great app, especially for the $13 price point. I would say to request extra crackers ;) WAGYU STEAK TARTARE, CAPERS, BÉARNAISE AIOLI: This was just ok to me. The aioli tasted like mayo was thrown on top of the order. While pretty, not sure this is worth the price tag.AMERICAN BURRATA, ROASTED SQUASH, RADICCHIO, PERSIMMON: Loved the fresh flavors here between the squash and radicchio. The burrata itself was just ok, I felt it wasn't as creamy as other burratas I've had. HOT FRIED CHICKEN, HONEY BUTTER BISCUITS, SLAW: This is a LARGE order! You get four pieces of chicken, two biscuits, and a nice side of slaw. I know a few friends who could take on this challenge, but I definitely say if you load up on apps, you can split this entree. The chicken has a nice crunch to it but I will say I came across two pieces of mine that seemed a bit underdone. LOBSTER ROLL, TOBIKO, YUZU PICKLE, FRIES: Perfect. No complaints, wish it was bigger maybe? But all lobster rolls are too small AMIRITE?!CHOCOLATE MINT ICEBOX CAKE, COOKIE CRUNCH: If you like thin mints or york peppermint patties, this is your go to! I love both, so this was easy to love on my end ;)VIETNAMESE COFFEE PIE, HOUSE MADE CONDENSED MILK: If you've had a Vietnamese coffee before, you know how strong it is. Well just like it's namesake, this pie is STRONG in the coffee flavoring, but so delicious. Definitely a good imitation of the drink!WARM APPLE PIE, BOURBON ICE CREAM, WALNUTS: I love apple pie. I love this apple pie. No complaints, this was definitely very very good.OVERALLThis place was perfect for our work lunch. I can see other business lunches taken here, or maybe a more intimate date. This is on the pricey side though, so bust out those AMEX cards. I wouldn't choose this over a Boulud or other fine dining restaurant, more of, if you're in the area, and this is the vibe you want, come here.",1,,
16,Bryant R.,"Manhattan, NY",101,518,0,4.0,4/10/2018,"After having been disappointed by many of my forays downtown recently, I actually liked this place, but for the $17 vodka soda (with the vodka portion having been measured carefully).  Maybe I am getting old but I like to expect good food and service at a restaurant at certain prices and it seems as though some of the downtown spots put more of a premium on atmosphere.The Dutch had a fun, youthful buzz but they did not ignore the food and service.  The oysters were as good as I have had recently, and my bacon-wrapped trout was definitely well prepared.  The service was strong.",2,,
17,Denise O.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",214,69,775,5.0,9/24/2017,"I had plans with friends and had zero expectations. The plan was to brunch and catch-up. I checked out the menu ahead of time since I only eat seafood and there's something for everyone...vegetarians to Pescatarian and meat eaters alike. This place is so cute. I've been out of NY for more than 20 years so when I come home, I want to experience HOME! Sleeping in on a Sunday and a great brunch with friends at a great brunch spot--which is exactly what The Dutch is. It's cozy and sexy and casual and whatever you need it to be all at the same time. I love that the entrance looks like you're going into an apartment building (if you missed the awning above the door, that is). You then enter into a dark vestibule and then open the next door and greeted by contrasting warm tones of tan and cream decor. The staff is really nice and accommodating...definitely what I like to experience when I go out. Now usually, if the spot is nice and the service is great, clearly the food is lacking, right? I mean....could all 3 areas be that good?! Yes. They. Can! So I'm told that everything at The Dutch is good...and I intend to find out on my next visit home. Well done!",1,,

19,Trinh T.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,12,21,4.0,6/3/2018,"Came here for some NYC brunch. Great service, laid back but without feeling forgotten. Perfect for a Saturday morning.  Atmosphere: don't fall down the stairs to the restroom. Kind of dark, but works to the ambience of the restaurant. Get window seating it's a nice look out into the street. Food: The oysters were AMAZING. Tasted so fresh and with the classics accoutrements, perfect bites. The fried chicken was cooked really well and seasoned great. We weren't a big fan of the dry seasoning dusted on top, but still great chicken. The honey biscuits were SO GOOD. Sleeper favorite of the table. Seriously with the sticky honey and melted butter. Yeah. The ham with the poached eggs made for a light, but satisfying brunch option. Those Carmelita's tomatoes really hit it well. Definitely a great experience! Our service was so great.",,,
20,Dimitrios D.,"Queens, NY",71,372,407,4.0,8/29/2017,"I went to the The Dutch for brunch and enjoyed it.  My friends and I didn't want to wait at the various no reservation establishments nearby, and so I was able to make a last minute Open Table reservation at The Dutch with ease at around 12:30 on a Sunday. The fact that this restaurant accepts reservations in itself makes it worth it.  Service was polite and efficient and the food was also good all around.  I had a cheese omelette with a side of bacon.  I wish the bacon was ""normal"" bacon (it's not here), but I still enjoyed it.  The surprise star of the show though was their doughnut tree, which has six doughnuts of three different types hanging from small hooks off a little wooden post, with a cup of chocolate sauce at the base.",1,,

The food is all fresh. Our party of five indulged in items that included a delectable omelet, salmon and a fruit bowl. The eggs are organic.

22,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,165,5.0,1/30/2018,"I will start this review by saying that the chocolate mint icebox cake is enough reason for five stars. Came here for late lunch, it was pretty dead since it was a weekday and we ordered off the restaurant week menu. We tried the wagyu steak tartare and the beet and citrus salad. My tartare was really good and presented beautifully. The beet salad was very fresh and had a pleasant flavor.For our main dishes, we tried the shrimp bowtie pasta and the trout. Personally, I thought my shrimp pasta was a bit too rich and heavy, but my friend really enjoyed it. If you're into a dish with lots of flavors and enjoy shrimp scampi, I would try it. The trout was heavenly. My favorite part of the meal came at dessert where I tried the chocolate mint icebox cake. I am usually not a huge fan of mint and chocolate together, but this was marvelous. It was so light, yet the had the best pairings of flavors. It was divine.",1,1,
23,M Y.,"New York, NY",0,25,55,4.0,5/6/2018,"Came here on a Sunday for Brunch. Place had good vibes on a Sunday afternoon with wonderful service. Did not feel rushed at all. Best is to make a reservation ahead of time because it can get pretty packed. The food was good. MUST get the Honey Butter Biscuits. Biscuit tasted nice and buttery with a nice honey glaze on top. Add some if the jam and whipped butter and it adds on a mouthfull of flavor.Had the Breakfast sandwich with Maple Sausage, Steamed Egg with Cheese. Sausage was good with the maple which added the sweetness. My friends had the Waffle and Steak and eggs with kimchi friend rice.",,,
24,Joe N.,"New Brunswick, NJ",561,15,46,4.0,12/19/2017,"Real great spot here -Ordered 3 oysters to start (Kusshi, BC; Row 34, MA; and Widow's Hole,NY) and they were all very fresh. Oysters were served with cocktail sauce, horseradish, hot sauce, and another sauce. Sauces and horseradish were all great compliments. For my main, I had the lobster roll and it was one of the better lobster rolls I've ever had. The meat was very fresh but lacked a bit of sweetness. The roll itself was perfectly toasted.The restaurant itself has a nice vibe and is bigger than expected. Seating isn't tight at all which is always nice to see in NY. Service was great.

27,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,4.0,5/15/2017,"Great Sunday dinner next to the window. We walked in and put our name on the waitlist to be seated at the window. Shortly after we received a call.The menu has plenty of seafood and meat options. Everything looked delicious. We were brought corn bread and butter to start.Food: We had one entrée each, which was enough.- Braised Lamb Neck Mole, Chayote, Cilantro & Lime ($33): OMG, best mole I have ever tried!! You need to have this in your life at least one! It comes with tortillas (seemed home-made) to make your own tacos!! - Skillet-Roasted Half Chicken, Artichoke, Smoky Tomato ($32): Loved the smoky flavor and how abundant the chicken was. Wine:They have a great cocktail selection, but decided to go with one of the wines from their ""Some interesting reds"" section. Gothic Pinot Noir Maelstrom 2012, Willamette Valley, Oregon. If within your budget ($90), I highly recommend it. Complex flavor, not too strong, not too light. Perfect to pair with their meats.Service:Very attentive. They even asked us if it was ok to close the window glass (we were seated in the bar next to the window). Many places wouldn't have asked and assumed it was ok, so I appreciated it.Overall, great experience. Will need to come back to try their brunch (which seems very popular from the reviews/pics here).",1,3,
28,Odo A.,"San Francisco, CA",14,11,15,1.0,8/4/2018,"The waiter had a very bad attitude, very condescending and clearly prejudiced against us, a black couple. First my date had not been attended to at all until I showed up. In all 15mn after being sat, the waiter came over.  I asked for recommendations, he rudely said ""read the menu"" then kept being rude  from there and argumentative when I told him I did not appreciate him being rude to me. I asked if we could have a  different waiter, he said no. I preferred to leave.  I reported him to the manager on the way out who didn't seem very empathetic (I also noticed that the waiter had already rushed to him to tell whatever story.. he was standing by with a smirk on his face while I was talking to the manager) ...once we walked out then the manager came out offering complementary drinks. No thanks. I live 3 blocks away from this place and always bring people here. I will NEVER return.",2,,1
29,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,100,19,2.0,5/10/2018,"TLDR: High prices for an overly loud restaurant that's all over the place and needs to find their niche. Very hit or miss dishes here. Only half the items ordered were actually good. I expect a higher standard of quality and deliciousness for their steep price tags. I wouldn't bother to return honestly. Doesn't live up to the hype. Overall rating: B-Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated for a party of 4 on a Saturday at 8:45pm. It is VERY dark, extremely loud, and overly crowded inside. As a result, I found the space itself to be very uncomfortable right off the bat. Honestly, I think this restaurant is just trying too hard. The dishes are full of odd pairings that are hit or miss. Heads up: Restrooms are located downstairs for those with mobility issues!Here is the full break down of the dishes:APPETIZERS:-CHINATOWN CALAMARI, CHILI CRISP, SMASHED CUCUMBER ($18): Spicier than expected, but I like spicy. Well executed. A--STICKY PORK RIBS, PEANUTS & LYCHEE ($21): Wow! I was really blown away by the crispy exterior and the moist, fall off the bone interior of these ribs! Lychee is fresh and wasn't overly sweet! Highly recommended! A+-The other 2 appetizers were specials of the day I don't really remember well. One was an odd borscht soup with too many extra ingredients that don't belong in it and didn't add to the dish (C grade). The second was a forgettable fusion cuisine tacos (C grade).ENTREES:-WILD HALIBUT CHA CÁ, TURMERIC, DILL, RICE NOODLE, PEANUTS ($42): I didn't try this personally but the person who ordered this said it was very good. A-RACK OF LAMB, SCOTCH BONNET JERK SAUCE, ROTI PANCAKE, PIKLIZ ($42): I sampled this and wish I got this instead. Excellent! I was worried the scotch bonnet sauce would be too spicy, but it was a comfortable heat. The Pikliz (condiment in Haitian cuisine of pickled cabbage, carrots, bell peppers and Scotch bonnet peppers) didn't add to the dish's flavor. The roti was barely crispy and very oily. The lackluster sides brought the dish's grade down. B+-HOT FRIED CHICKEN, HONEY BUTTER BISCUITS, SLAW ($32): This is the dish The Dutch is KNOWN for. Diners at adjacent tables all opted for 3 pieces of chicken (unfortunately you cannot request just dark or just light pieces since they're already pre-portioned per person) and 2 honey coated biscuits with coleslaw served in a large circular metal dish cafeteria style like I did. The chicken was perfectly fine as regular fried chicken, but no way can anyone ever call it ""hot"". They give you a house made hot sauce but even that's not all that spicy. The biscuits were cold by the time I got them so I didn't really enjoy them. The cole slaw was standard. It was a big portion at least. For $32 this should've been the best darn SPICY fried chicken in NYC! This would normally get a B rating elsewhere, but since it's over $30 I'm bumping it down to B- rating!-The last entree was a special of the day. It was a bacon wrapped fish (possibly cod). I don't recall the side dish. I sampled it. It was decent (not a seafood lover though). BDESSERT:-CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CAKEMALT, COFFEE ICE CREAM ($14): This was a decent cake. I didn't really pick up the hazelnut flavor other than the hazelnut pieces themselves. The ice cream was delicious. B+BONUS: At the end of the meal, they give each person a complementary homemade muffin to take home. That day we received carrot muffins. B+",1,,1

The eggs were poached to perfection, the ham was thinly shaved  and the hollandaise packed tons of flavor.  What put this over the top was the huge cheddar cheese biscuit.  Perfect to sop up all the yolky goodness.They also make a solid Bloody Mary.",1,,1

And the food is without fail amazing regardless of what you get. Everyone left talking about how great their meal was. The ribs are so good.  I love any type of fusion.The fish was great. 2.

We had a great table in the back and we ordered the shrimp and barrata for appetizers and rosé which were all good. The entrees however, were REALLY good. You have to get the hanger steak with kimchi fried rice and fried chicken and biscuits. They're both amazing.While the service was fine and food was great, it really doesn't warrant the prices. They are also definitely trying to turn tables here. As soon as we paid they took everything off the table... AKA leave please. I'd go back though, especially if someone else is buying!",1,,1

We recently took friends visiting from Denver to The Dutch.  We ran 20 minutes late (darn Holland Tunnel traffic) and they still held our reservation. Whew!My boyfriend and I shared the Baby Lettuce salad with Asian Pear and Quinoa and the Hot Fried Chicken with Honey Biscuits and Slaw (the entree that all the reviews are raving about).  The salad was great and I've never had quinoa prepared in this manner before (toasted and crunchy).  I thought it was small for the $17. The Chicken entree was good, but it was not much different than fried chicken at other restaurants.  At a price tag of $32, I was expecting some outstanding chicken.  The accompanying honey biscuits were delicious and more like a dessert than something to accompany a Fried chicken entree.  The bread served prior to dinner, which included a corn bread was tasty.

36,Cary L.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",46,5,13,3.0,6/3/2018,Super noisy restaurant as there is no separation between the bar and the dining table. I barely hear anything the waiter or my date said during the entire dinner. The kimchi fried rice is delicious!  The sticky ribs were very good too.

We truly appreciated the extra effort The Dutch made to recognize our anniversary and make it special.  There was a sparkler presented with desert to make the evening even more memorable.  And if you're particular about the experience, let me tell you without any hyperbole... the restaurant staff was constantly (but quietly) attentive.  Our water glass was never empty and our table was never soiled while the food and drinks kept flowing.We highly recommend The Dutch.  Stop by if you're local and get there if you're not.",1,,

It comes with a side of pickled slaw with tiny bits of jalapeño- i don't even care for coleslaw and ate all of it! The honey cornbread was really good too. Most of our party ordered the fried chicken but some of my colleagues ordered the roasted chicken salad and they said it was the best chicken they've ever had.

Chicken was crunchy on the outside and VERY juicy and tender inside. One of the better fried chickens I've had. Additionally, honey butter biscuit was to die for! It's so buttery and soft and fluffy, and honey glazed on the outside made it unique. On the flip side, the hubby tried their bloody mary but wasn't impressed.

When I told the hostess she was snippy and just continued to sing and dance which was totally weird and rude.

53,Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2269,1707,2216,4.0,11/3/2016,"So this space was volunteered as a meeting point to catch up with a friend of mine during this Manhattan visit.  I haven't hung out that much in Greenwich Village so walking the area for a bit was a nice and leisurely surprise.First off, almost all of the eateries in NY are very trendy, filled to the brim with youngsters around the age of late 20's to late 30's.  The vibe in NY is different overall but it is definitely palpable.  The dark interior with accents reminded me of an old remodeled barn that is comfortable yet modern.  We were seated in the other dining area away from the corner windows and the entire place was packed at 6:00.Menu here is somewhat limited so since I didn't really have any interest in seafood or pasta, I opted for the Hanger steak with kimchi fried rice and a fried egg.  While I am a huge fan of Korean food, I don't usually eat my steaks with a side of fried rice so we were able to finagle a substitution of french fries with the steak.  We requested the rosemary potatoes but the chef turned that notion down, saying it would detract from the flavor of the steak.  Once out, we understood why.  The Hanger steak was lightly marinated in a soy sauce, which would explain the fried rice.  My personal take on steaks is that other than flank steak or tri tip, steaks of this nature (extremely soft and tender) should be recognized for their delicate nature and while the marinade was good (mild enough so that it didn't saturate the steak), I would have preferred a simple grill with salt and pepper.  Our other dinner guest ordered the lasagna and what a surprise!  It was not the type of lasagna we were expecting and especially since this establishment was not Italian focus at all. The sauce was a veal bolognese, on spinach pasta and enough pecorino cheese to blanket the amazing square cut of deliciousness.Overall, I have to give a ""10"" to our waiter since she did her best to accommodate and make us feel welcome.  Staff here are attentive and if you have time to burn before your supperm, walk up the street toward Houston and Sullivan, Francois Payard has a little cafe ;-)",1,1,1

Updated review","On August 22, 2018 around 5 pm a coworker invited me for cocktails to The Dutch where he's been to before to talk about some personal things. The first bartender who served us at the bar was a bald, Latino man with tattoos and was very friendly and personable. After serving us drinks his shift had ended, unfortunately. After having one drink, around 6pm I asked for a glass of water from the second bartender who was African American & took over the shift of the previous bartender. After one sip of water I felt something enter my mouth from the water and then spit it back into the glass. It was black and about 1/2 an inch long and then sank to the bottom of the glass. I showed my friend the glass and then proceeded to notify the bartender. Being a Bar Manager myself I understand the proper procedures for handling these issues. The bartender looked at the floating object and said ""Oh, it's probably a piece of mint."" He never apologized for the inconvenience I had experienced or offered anything from the bar to compensate for the unhygienic & health code violation. I told the bartender I felt disrespected and insulted for him belittling my experience and telling me what it was rather than asking me. I told him I know for a fact it WAS NOT MINT that rolled over my tongue and touched my tastebuds. I would know...it was in my mouth. How dare he make an assumption so cavalier. I then asked to speak with a manager. The tall, lean Caucasian manager came over and I explained my situation and the problem I had with the bartender. The manager just said ""I'm sorry""  and kept walking with total disregard! Being a bar manager the protocol for such a situation was NEVER met and the restaurant staff at all levels had absolutely no concern or care for their customer or how there behavior may affect future patrons from supporting the establishment. I hope the OWNER of The DUTCH, gets to read this and address his staff on the following: 1. proper procedures for dealing with health code violations which can close a restaurant down; 2. customer satisfaction and etiquette, and how to properly handle future situations with them; 3 communicating properly and showing RESPECT to paying customers. This restaurant is POORLY ran and has HORRIBLE  customer service! I would not recommend this establishment to my worst enemy or anyone who desires a positive experience from the service industry!!!'",1,,

56,Jay K.,"New York, NY",31,174,139,5.0,12/11/2016,"Just had dinner here. It was a full-house. Here was my experience:Food- very eclectic. Diver scallop appetizer- It was very light and fresh. Definitely has some fishy-mess to it from the roe, so if you're not a fan of that, do not order. I loved it though. It was very refreshing and the sauce that came with it almost tasted like a tasty green juice. Oyster sandwich- My friend had it and said it was amazingly delicious. It is suuuuper teeny weeny. Bass entreé- this was yummy. The sauce/purse veg much complimented the bass. Right before this though, they got my order wrong and brought out the catfish entreé. To be honest, this one looked a lot more appetizing than the bass. Might try it next time around. Hangersteak with Kimchi fried rice- my friend had this. I had some and this was BOMB!! We were both wary to try anything Korean in a American cuisine restaurant,but kudos to them to almost perfecting the kimchi taste. It was nicely done. Service- very friendly and attentive. Our waitress made sure we were taken care of and the bussers and runners were always making sure our table was cleaned and our waters were being filled. Dessert-didn't have any, but peeking at the menu- looks divine. Decor-felt like I was in Paris or just somewhere old school. Very cozy, casual, and a bit trendy. Overall, we had a great experience and would def. return soon.",,,

My friend and I came here around 2:30 and got a taste of the brunch menu (which, by the way, is terrific if you're all about the eggs). We ordered the citrus shrimp salad, which didn't turn out to be that great. I think the flavor overall was pretty good and the avocado made up for anything that was lacking. but it was not worth $25. Of course we got the doughnut tree, which was so sweet and cuuuute! Not really sure what to make of this place, but definitely want to try the other things on the brunch menu next time.",2,,

I have never seen any colored people inside eating, so either the menu is too pricey for them to afford to eat there, or they just aren't welcomed at all.

64,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,5.0,2/10/2017,"Went here with my parents on their visit to NYC. Made sure to make a reservation as this place is packed for dinner. Despite being 30 minutes early for our reservation, we were able to be seated right away.To start off, we decided to go with the burrata. I feel like it is hard to mess up burrata, but the addition of black truffle and the sunflower toast, really helped to elevate the flavors of this dish. We also got an order of the beets and enjoyed those as well.For the main course, we decided to split the famous fried chicken and the NY Strip. The NY strip was very good--cooked perfectly and had nice flavor. However, the winner of the night was the fried chicken. Wow, what a memorable dish--the chicken was so moist and packed with flavor and was a generous portion size as well. In addition, the biscuit was to die for--so buttery and rich, yet flaky and delicious. The slaw was good as well, but was more of an afterthought after the chicken and biscuit.To finish the meal, we decided to get an order of the Pecan pie with chocolate bourbon sauce--holy hell was that good, and the perfect ending to our meal. The pie was so rich and satisfying, I could barely stop myself from eating the whole thing. The nutmeg ice cream was interesting, but sort of seemed unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the flavors of the pie. Nevertheless, we enjoyed it immensely.Overall, this place serves up some tasty food. The prices are a bit steep, but the portion sizes are generous and the service is friendly. Definitely a lively atmosphere and worth checking out if you are in the area.",3,1,1

67,Estina R.,"Manhattan, NY",142,293,16,1.0,1/8/2017,"Wow, what an awful and sad experience we had here.I've been here a few times, with my husband, with co-workers, on business lunches...each time was really great, the restaurant decor is lovely, the food was really delicious and service was attentive. We booked a table for a friends birthday dinner because we noticed they did a fun sparkly candle with the desserts and we had good experiences here.For this particular birthday dinner, we had a culturally diverse group and almost immediately, I felt the service was vastly different from the other times I've been there. Our table location was terrible, they squeezed us into a smaller table meant for a smaller party, we were basically 6 people at a 4 person table, basically sitting on top of each other. We crammed ourselves and our gifts around this cramped table in the middle of the aisle, super uncomfortable. We would've gladly had a drink at the bar and waited for a better table but we weren't given that option.The waiter rushed us from the start, barely looked us in the eye and took our dinner order with our first drink order (we had no time to look at the menu). Again, this was completely different from my other experiences, where we lingered over our wine and savored each bite.Despite the fact that we were all dressed up, ready to celebrate, the waiter never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks or checked in on us once. Birthday sparkly candles were flying around the room for various other diners birthdays and when our birthday girl went to the ladies, we let the waiter know we wanted to order a special dessert with a candle for her....we all waited for the dessert to come, ready to snap a pic of her blowing out the same sparkly candle everyone else got....but when her dessert came, it was a regular .99 store candle. They brought the bill with the dessert.I'm not a loudmouth, I find these circumstances extremely uncomfortable to deal with, I normally just don't go back to these places again but I was really so shocked that I did ask the waiter why she didn't get the sparkly candle (...sounds silly but we were treated poorly and this just added insult to injury)....he was visibly annoyed and said ""that's just the candle I grabbed, I don't get it, whats the problem?"".....and of course, on cue, another sparkly candle comes out of the kitchen for another guest. It was really a sad moment and put a damper on what was already a rushed and lackluster experience.There's nothing you can say to convince me that we weren't treated differently for a specific reason and I'll never come back here again. It's 2017 and this is New York.",12,1,

Was a little nervous about the experience since it's rated 3.5 stars on Yelp.The experience completely surprised me and made me wonder why the heck does THE DUTCH not deserve more stars!!!The seating area is huge, there is a backroom behind the front room and a private dining area downstairs. We were seated in the backroom, and the decor was amazing, classic decor.The brunch menu was honestly not too big, it incorporates lunch into brunch, so you can have options like oysters too. I have a picture of the menu, so you could see what's for brunch.we ordered an appetizer to share:- Steak Tartare ($18) - It was absolutely amazing, to start with the toast was crunchy and amazing, the steak was phenomenal and it came with mayonnaise that blends really well with the whole dishBrunch food- Omelette with caramelized onions and salad on the side ($18) - the omelette was amazing, very strong on onions, a must-try if you are an onion lover- Smoked salmon with bagel with scrambled egg - the scrambled egg? no joke is the best scrambled egg i've had in the city. the bagel was crunchy but not dry, and the smoked salmon was really good, it also have sour cream and salmon roe on the side where you could put on the bagel, love the little touch.Strongly recommend the smoked salmon with bagel and scrambled egg, probably the best brunch dish you get in the city!Service is absolutely amazing, the servers are super nice, take really good pictures from good angles, and everyone was super attentive.Will definitely come back and would recommend everyone too!

For the crazy high prices they are touting, I would think the food would be a lot better and the service a lot friendlier. We came for brunch so of course got bloodies. Again, meh. Mine was watery and didn't have great flavor. We split the doughnut tree which was definitely the best thing, maybe the only good thing. I got the baby bib lettuce salad which was, for lack of a better term, bad. I'm not sure how they are selling that for $17. We also had the eggs Benedict which I would recommend if you were to come here. I think there are better options in this area!",1,,

Ordered wagyu tartare, shrimp cocktail and oyster sandwich. Appetizers were great!! The entrees on the other hand was far from my expectations. I ordered a hanger steak with kimchi fried rice and egg while my fiancé ordered a ravioli. The taste was alright, had better at other spots. Which was a bummer. Apparently, their famous dish was the hot fried chicken. I didn't want to order it as it looked like KFC on a plate and thought it'll be dry. Maybe i'll give it another chance next time. For dessert, we ordered a sorbet; pear and ginger. It was delicious! Must-order!!! I will come back again just to try their hot fried chicken.",,,

84,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",2,86,0,2.0,4/7/2018,"Perfectly acceptable place for brunch or dinner. Nice selection of oysters, and a bistro menu with the usual suspects plus things like fried chicken. I came here for a client lunch and everyone was pleased with their orders. Our server was pleasant and we made friendly chit chat with her.  The lunch went on a little longer than I had anticipated and I was going to be late getting to my next appointment. I was preoccupied when I got the check and left only half the tip that I meant to. The manager came over to me and instead of asking me if something was wrong privately, demanded angrily in front of all five people from the table that typically you leave 20%, what was wrong, this isn't standard practice, etc. I was horrified first of all for my mistake.  I used to be a server and I know that feeling of being stiffed. But I was also horrified by his behavior.  There is no reason he could not have been discreet.  I was clearly mortified and apologized profusely both to the manager and the server and left more tip than I had to but he was still cold. This was obviously a business lunch so even if they don't know me to know that I'm not cheap, why would anybody do that intentionally on expense account. My clients commented on how rude they were once we got outside which was even more embarrassing. I guess his emotional first reaction just got the best of him, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.",,,

Would definitely come back although the main course looks sub par! Just need to know what to order more of a date spot or even business spot to chit chat! The only complaint I have is that one of the hostesses told me I could sit at the bar so we sat on the reverse side where raw bar was we ended up spending 150 not including tip but she said it is meant for people having full course meals, even though no one was sitting down there! We got lucky someone just paid the bill at the other end so we waited two minutes and snagged a spot on the other side! The bartenders were on point so made up for the snooty hostess!",,,

Updated review",Love to go to this village eatery especially when the have their special menus. Better late than never but we went for the Memorial Day bbq and really enjoyed it.  They also have other holidays menus that I have partaken of.,,,
95,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,376,718,3.0,2/4/2017,If were to give it a rating on value it would be 2 stars.First off this was for a birthday party for 9 and originally wanted to do dinner as birthday person wanted the fried chicken.  This place is one of those that requires getting an expensive menu for parties greater than 8.  I am not a fan as would have been fine doing a order of 2 items and paying a guaranteed 18 or 20 percent tip.  We ended up doing brunch as chicken is on that menu.Everyone raved about the chicken but the wing I tasted was okay.  I am from the south so maybe harder to please.I ordered the banana waffles with bacon.  Bacon was great and one of reasons give place 3 as nice and thick 6 pieces and well cooked.  My waffles though tasted like cooked  earlier as did not have that right out of grill taste.  I know it comes with bananas and ice cream but should not have to ask for syrup.  Give me Waffle House over these.The doughnuts were to die for as perfectly flaked with coconut and nice chocolate sauce.    Bloody Mary was okay but hard to screw those up and at 16 dollars better be good. Place is very nicely designed and service was good. Though mocha not on menu they made me one. I have been to locande verde and loved that but this place was a disappointment.,,,
96,Chip R.,"Morrisville, NC",510,469,1035,4.0,5/22/2017,"Short version: The Dutch delivered a pretty enjoyable Sunday brunch on this visit. Nice clean sharp venue, great menu choice variety, and good service all round out this experience. The breakfast sandwich is definitely thumbs up both in portion and taste. I am a fan!The Deets:As everyone knows, the main meal on NYC weekends is brunch...no doubt about it. In the search for that ever elusive brunch bliss, we made it down to The Dutch in the South Village area. The Dutch is a pretty sizable eatery, and that in itself makes it stand out. Inside is a well finished decor that is not too bistro but not too fine dining...just right. The front area is a bit brighter with large windows and an inviting bar area while the back area is somewhat darker but just as welcoming (we were seated here). Our server was attentive and pleasant, and drinks were distributed in good time. Their brunch menu offers a great variety of options for every taste. I chose their breakfast sandwich with a mimosa and coffee for my brunch experience. The breakfast sandwich has maple sausage (appears to be hand pattied) along with a large block of scrambled egg surrounded by an outer layer of cheese on one of their honey butter biscuits. It's pretty large as they give you a steak type of knife to help enjoy it. And enjoy it I did, the flavors of all the components came together wonderfully and no complaints on the portion size. I was delightfully surprised how well the flavors all worked together beyond a basic sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. I would recommend this choice and I am looking forward to getting it again when visiting The Dutch in the future!",2,1,4
97,Marina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,354,892,4.0,11/15/2015,"I have a feeling this is a place you go when you want to be seen during brunch, and/or insta beautiful pictures of your brunch to make everyone else in your newsfeed look like peasants. Luckily, if you're not normally part of the SoHo crowd, you can also catch The Dutch for a great weekday lunch and still eat with your eyes.We opted for the lunch tasting menu ($32), which is a relative steal for both prices in the area and considering you get full-sized portions instead of small tastings. I ended up trying:+ sunchoke soup with coffee cream and a chestnut-date granola: the foamy coffee cream on top was quite bitter and off-putting, but the actual soup was very good. The sweet ""granola bar"" on the side was also delicious for dipping. Probably wouldn't order this again, but I wanted something warm on a chilly day.+ crispy duck leg salad with cranberry beans, frisee, and egg: this was absolutely delicious, and it took serious control not to eat the entire thing in one go. The duck leg was deep fried and melt-in your-mouth perfection, while the light salad was perfect to complement the heavy duck. I loved the puree beneath it all (still not sure what that was), while the egg had some serious yolk porn going on. Definitely order this if you want to pretend to be healthy.+ devil's food cake with vanilla ice cream: pure chocolate heaven. The entire cake was wrapped with this meringue-like coating that had a little pepperiness to it, while the cake itself was super decadent. Their vanilla ice cream was also some of the best I've ever had; you could really taste the fresh vanilla beans inside and it was the perfect compliment to the rich cake.The entire staff was very friendly and the pace of the courses was very relaxed. Not the best place to come if you're on a lunch break, but if you want to do some people watching while enjoying a beautiful meal, The Dutch is a good place to start.",3,,2
98,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,10/27/2016,"I'll give the Dutch four stars for now until I have a chance to come back and try more entrees, desserts and cocktails from their menu. On my first visit, I had the burger (which you can't really judge a place known for it's brunch food by their burgers). It was quite a large burger with two patties and well cooked. No complaints. I saw lots of delicious desserts going to tables nearby, including a dish that contained multiple mini donuts on hangars, I will have to order that next time. My table mates liked their dishes as well. Service was ok, though I think our waitress didn't particularly like us. Front desk staff was very friendly. We had made a reservation on OpenTable, which I highly recommend, as wait times are long here on weekends. Very cozy, woodsy, cute decor on the inside and quaint on the outside of the building too.",2,1,5

The Luau theme also helped to create a fun atmosphere.  Will definitely be back to try their regular menu.",1,,
100,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,9/18/2016,"I've always considered The Dutch to be the cooler, slightly rambunctious sibling in the family of Andrew Carmellini's restaurants. Situated on a central street in SoHo, it's an ever-busy restaurant that serves the whole gamut of elevated ""American"" cuisine, complete with a full bar and with all your key meals of the day (even your Mid-Afternoon munchies) covered.On the evening that my friend and I visited, the restaurant was almost full to the brim, despite the fact that it was in the middle of the week. While grateful that I'd made a reservation in advance, it did also mean that we were seated fairly closely to neighboring parties, and that we had to repeat ourselves several times given the volume of conversation in the dining room. Needless to say, don't come to The Dutch expecting a quiet and leisurely evening; it's far from the place for that.To begin, we started off with the Steak Tartare, which featured finely chopped wagyu beef topped by slices of pickled mushrooms and dill. The tartare was well-seasoned and had just the right amount of creaminess to bind the protein together; a little acidity from the mushrooms and a freshness from the dill rounded out each mouthful. And, of course, the side of toasted bread made for an ideal vehicle, giving just the right amount of texture and crunch to the dish.The mains shouldn't be undersold, either. As an avid lover of duck, I couldn't avoid ordering the Duck Smoked in Hay, which featured five expertly cooked portions of duck served with a rutabaga puree and a cranberry mostarda. The duck was perfectly cooked to the requested medium rare, the skin was crisp and had just the right salt and pepper crust while the actual meat retained its juiciness. The puree provided a smooth, lightly sweetened contrast, and the mustarda had just the right level of sweetness to complement the duck. As for the Hot Fried Chicken, it's certainly not the most elegant dish to eat, but the chicken is served piping hot with a crispy, lightly spiced skin - a surprisingly well-done feat for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in the dish. The honey butter biscuits and the vinegar-based slaw served on the side round out the dish, making it one of the larger and more filling plates on the menu.While they're not particularly well known for their desserts, I have to give a nod to the Pecan Pie, which was chock full of glazed pecans and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. One slice was quite dense, and was ideal to share between two people; and if you're interested, they make pies daily on premises that can be ordered to go.Aside from the slightly claustrophobic dining area and the fact that you may have difficulty hearing your dining companion, I'd return to The Dutch without hesitation. The food is surprisingly well-executed and conceived, and our dinner service flowed smoothly without a hitch. Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I'm sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea.",12,5,9
101,Julia M.,"PACIFIC PLSDS, CA",13,82,288,5.0,3/13/2016,"The Dutch is nicely laid out with walls opening to let in the charm of the SoHo streets.

For lunch we had a lobster roll served with caviar and fried duck breast on a bed of greens and beans.  Both very tasty. The wines were good and waitress very knowledgeable about pairing. The Vermentino went well with the duck. All in all a great place.",,,

Food is fine, some creativity here and there, but DON'T go for brunch. Packed and fast paced. You will see your wait person frequently, especially at the end of your brunch. The pressure to get out is beyond belief. Horrible experience that became a running joke at our table. We all walked out saying ""We're sorry we stayed so long.""  Total time spent? 70 minutes, or about $2.50 a minute for our group.  The prime server was almost angry, and certainly undeniably irritated that we lingered for that last cup of coffee. Asked if we wanted anything else at 45 minutes and pulled the bill from behind his back when we said no thanks. Table staff cleared glasses, napkins, salt and pepper, and even crumbs in repeated visits after that.  I get the need to turn the tables, but back off please.  Just put a meter on the table and we would have been more comfortable.",,,

Updated review","Another great experience at The Dutch for brunch. Still my favorite brunch place in New York City (and if you are a brunch go-er, you know this is a pretty insane claim). Carly, at the front door, was just as sweet as the last time. I came in at around 1pm, and she was seating guests, tickling a baby and answering the phone all at once with a smile on her face. My waiter, Erin, was so pleasant. We got the doughnut tree again because it's just irresistible. I love watching through the window by the staircase and seeing their extremely talented and professional chefs go to work. The Dutch is one of the few restaurants I find it necessary to leave a review for, and I wish it were a little bit more in my budget so I could come more frequently. I'm such a big fan of this place and send any one who asks for a great brunch spot their way.See you guys soon!",,,

It seemed like an elaborate version of a hot totty, but made with vodka, and I don't really drink vodka, so we asked if we could have some thing like this - with the extra spices with a whisky.

119,Kyle S.,"Manhattan, NY",18,86,563,3.0,10/5/2016,"I struggle with this rating... I came in last Saturday for brunch with two friends. I love the interior/ambiance. It is definitely a cool, trendy, popular restaurant in Soho.We started off with the burrata, which was excellent. It comes with toasted bread and a Delicious fig/hazelnut salad-- the burrata itself was delicious, although small. This is where the struggle comes in-- I ordered the ""POACHED EGGS, CHEDDAR BISCUIT, HAM, CHIPOTLE & TOMATO"" as my main. The eggs were not poached. I think they aimed for them to be soft boiled-- however they ended up being somewhere between soft and hard boiled. Half the yolks in both eggs were solidified by the the time the dish was placed on the table. The rest of the dish was just kind of confused at that point-- I ended up nibbling on everything else on the plate individually -- and I'm not sure where the chipotle was really. My friend got the egg sandwich-- The sausage on the sandwich was delicious-- it was sweet and tasty, however an egg sandwich without a fried egg for me personally is a miss. The egg is more of a square shaped scramble-- which just isn't appetizing to me-- again-- personal opinion.If I came back for brunch, I would most likely try different main dishes on the menu.",,,
120,Elle W.,"San Francisco, CA",198,276,361,2.0,3/9/2016,"First, the Dutch is overpriced.  Perhaps I'm totally spoiled by all the amazing brunch choices in NYC where I only pay $30 for food + unlimited mimosas... so I was surprised by the price tag here.  Without alcohol, we spent $40 each.Second, the food isn't stellar.  I ordered their famous fried chicken which (if you're a hungry girl like me) is good for just one person.  The fried chicken is tasty, but the problem is... I recently discovered the fried chicken sandwich at Fuku+.  Now I want my fried chicken to have a tiny bit of kick to it.  My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp & Kimchi fried rice.  We warned the server that her being Korean meant she had high standards for Kimchi and he still told her to go for it.  Mistake -- she took a one bite and then said she could make better kimchi herself. Third, I was surrounded by preppy kids in plaid.  Perhaps a lot of kids from NYU decided to go to brunch that day, but I was definitely aged out.So if you haven't ever gone to the Dutch, just go check it out once.  It is a NYC institution, and I'm happy to have gone so I can take it off of my Yelp bookmarks.",3,2,1

122,Elizabeth B.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,41,1,1.0,1/4/2017,"I'll let this letter I just sent to the owners speak for itself:My boyfriend and I dined the Dutch on Sunday after it came highly recommended. I ordered the catfish for dinner, and given that I was a vegetarian for sixteen years and have been a pescatarian for the last two, I am in the habit of reading ingredients carefully. I literally haven't eaten a bite of meat intentionally since 1998. When the catfish dish arrived, I ate part of it and half wondered if the chewy pieces I was tasting in the grits and collared greens were perhaps bits of meat--but no, I thought--what restaurant would list the ingredients on a seafood dish but leave out the fact that it contains meat? These must just be hearty mushrooms. When I asked the server if there were mushrooms in the dish, she replied, ""No, but there is bacon and blood sausage."" I cannot begin to imagine why you would bother to list the primary ingredients in a seafood dish but choose to omit the fact that there is meat in it. While I was disgusted and immediately lost my appetite, I was upset not so much that I had accidentally eaten these things, but more so at the thought that others with dietary restrictions might be truly devastated if they ended up in the same position. Can you imagine someone who doesn't eat pork for religious reasons coming to the realization that they had just consumed bacon? And considering that many people who do eat meat won't even touch blood sausage, the whole thing truly blows my mind. Even worse, the server mentioned (upon my prying) that I was not the first person to be surprised by these ingredients, and as I pressed for an explanation, she acknowledged that this issue had been previously been brought to the owners' attention, and nothing had been done in response.Neglecting to highlight the pork-based ingredients in a seafood dish is irresponsible, but your decision to ignore the issue is negligent and reprehensible. I'd appreciate if you would correct the menu to reflect those ingredients.",6,1,
123,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,4.0,2/27/2016,"The Dutch is only a few years old, but it already has the swagger of a New York institution. And that might be one of the strongest things to say about any restaurant in Gotham given the city's tendency to be spoiled rotten with new food joints popping up literally every day. Trendiness only lasts so long before some younger, hipper, more attractive digs open up. And from there, it's off to the worrisome, awkward, puberty-esque second stage, which could last long enough to still see the spot sputter off and shut its doors. Somehow, The Dutch has unfairly skipped this zits and braces phrase. Frankly, that's a rarity. But it's certainly not by chance.The dining room is inviting, stately, modern, and casually gorgeous, like a well-tailored suit, worn unbuttoned and without a tie. It's an effective first impression one gets even before taking a bite of their unapologetically American cuisine. It's a safe favorite for business lunches, and I've been lucky enough to frequent The Dutch enough to narrow the menu down to three solid choices: the Hot Fried Chicken, the Pastrami Roll, and the Double Cheddar Burger.The Hot Fried Chicken is The Dutch's most popular dish, so we'll start there. Deserving of its omnipresence on top ten fried chicken lists in the city (if for each piece's juicy center alone), but I personally would stop short of putting them near the top spot. To be honest, they're upstaged by the very side its served with, those devilish Honey Butter Biscuits, drenched in liquid sugar and blessed in a Southern Baptist church.The Pastrami Roll may have been my favorite. And perhaps no one else's, since it's sadly off the menu these days. As I feel like I'm eulogizing the sandwich while I reminisce, it was anchored by deliciously briny meat, slathered with horseradish and Swiss, and armed with crispy onion rings at its hip. I always hold out hope it's a special, and I've tried to bring it up with servers since its disappearance, in the off-chance there's some secret sandwich code among the well-informed, but no such luck there. Yet.The Double Cheddar Burger has probably been my most reliable pick. It's got your typical fast food formula (sesame seed bun, pickles, secret sauce, addictively salty fries on the side), but with of course way better ingredients. So rather than reinvent the wheel, The Dutch attempts to perfect a low-brow American standard, and they more or less deliver with a gooey, cheesy, dry-aged monster not for that faint-hearted. As a general rule, in fact, you shouldn't misinterpret The Dutch for light fare. This is some all-around, gut-busting cuisine.The service can be spotty, but The Dutch really lets its decor and cooking do most of the talking here anyway. It's quickly become a SoHo staple, despite serving a week's worth of calories in a single meal for the models strutting down nearby Prince and Spring Streets. A wolf of Wall Street in Southern sheep's clothing (or is it the other way around?), The Dutch is confident, delicious, and American through and through.",3,2,2

We have been eating in Soho because she works in the area and really what is there to complain about eating in Soho!?I always wanted to try The Dutch due to reading a great review a few years back from NY Mag.I can't even begin to describe this perfect gem of a restaurant:You find this cozy restaurant on the corner of Prince and Sullivan. When I walked in I felt as if I was walking into a restaurant in Prague: intimate, cozy and beautiful lighting greet you. I checked in and a very pleasant maitre' d escorted me to my table where Rochelle was already seated: a booth next to a fireplace and near our table old recipe books were placed. We were immediately served water with ice and lime/ lemon and amazing corn bread. Our waiter,Ramon( best waiter!), greeted us and told us to take our time in ordering. The menu contained many tantalizing options. We decided to start with the eggplant dip with savory crackers( toasted flatbread with delectable spices) and I had the little fried oyster sandwich( scrumptious slider).We then ordered from the Restaurant Week menu: 1st course: mushroom soup( I wish they bottled and sold it) served in beautiful Apilco pottery. Ramon checked on us to ensure we savored it properly: next to the bowl is a delicious cheddar cracker with truffles on top. He instructed us to crumble the cracker into the soup. All I can say is OMG!2nd course: a delicious veggie burger( alas Hillstone still has the best) with melted cheddar and fries. Rochelle had the salmon with cauliflower( she loved it). I ate half of my burger to save room for last course, dessert. I asked Ramon to pack my burger for a late nite snack*(* I will explain later about my burger)3rd course: Apple pie with cherries on bottom of pie with Chestnut ice cream. (OMG part 2). Rochelle had the Devils food cake with Vanilla ice cream.Ramon, who was pleasantly chatting with us throughout our dining, returns with my burger packed to go. He pleasantly explains ""Fawn, we gave you a brand new burger and fries"" How nice was that?All I can say is WOW!

Whoa. I mean really a couple fancy poached eggs and not enough ham with a mini biscuit?Anyways, it was a meal, nothing spectacular and they were very strict about outside beverages (it was just a cup of coffee from a local location) that they held for me at the front while it obviously got cold.

It's the only explanation for her petty behavior: argumentative, having a curt response for everything, staring at our group who was taking their time to move from the bar to the table like she could murder them. After a very uncomfortable exchange with her as she sat us, she went straight to our waitress to complain about us... all in front of us. Quite awful.

Now don't get me wrong, their fried chicken dinner on Mondays (which they did away with) was legendary and the beef burger I'd gotten during another restaurant week in the summer was enough to make me weep openly at the table it was sooooooooo good. This time...the veggie burger disappointed greatly. It was too...something...and not something enough. That likely makes no sense unless you know that when you are looking for flavor and texture and you're let down, it's easy to be a little bitter.

143,Lauren B.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",376,1,0,4.0,5/9/2017,"I chose this place for my birthday dinner and really enjoyed it. When you consider location, atmosphere and quality of food the prices were good (not sure why others are complaining about price - seems par for course in NYC considering the above). My group of three ate an appetizer, three mains, a side, three cocktails and a dessert for $200.I ordered the chicken, poke appetizer, a side of French onion potatoes and the coconut cream pie. Although the menu may look small to some, I found there were plenty of delicious, diverse options to choose from. My only compliant is the chicken was not spicy, neither was the hot sauce - although I'm a big spice fan so plenty of ""hot"" things to me are not spicy.  Also, if anything was overpriced it indeed was the drink menu ($16 a cocktail, over $20 for certain wines by the glass). The service was fine, not overly attentive but not inattentive which is how I prefer service to be. Bottom line: I would recommend this place to others and I would also return here myself.",,,

Our service was great!  The food was quick & delicious with some unique options, though we all settled on the poached eggs with cheddar biscuit, ham & tomato. The tomato was fantastic!  The ham was more like prosciutto, & a friend asked if he could substitute it for bacon but was told no, so he ended up having to get it on the side.  I also tried the Bloody Mary which was a bit on the small size for the price but was good - do watch out for what appeared to be peppercorns in it that came up the straw unexpectedly.  I absolutely loved the decor.  Overall a nice time!",,,

164,Abby S.,"New York, NY",0,1,1,1.0,4/9/2017,"I have to say I was extremely disappointed in my experience at The Dutch today.  I have dined at The Dutch several times and was excited for my boyfriend to try it as well.  I was planning on ordering the tuna poke but our server said this was not available so I settled on the smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and bagel for a steep price of $25.  I was wrong when assuming this meant the dish included cream cheese.  When our food arrived there was a huge spoonful of sour cream served with the dish and when I asked for cream cheese they said they did not have cream cheese.  I find it VERY hard to believe that a nice restaurant in soho with a broad menu does not have cream cheese in the kitchen.  I have to say I live in the area and dine out for most meals and will not be visiting The Dutch again anytime soon.  My boyfriend was also very unimpressed by his breakfast sandwich that was stacked so high you could barely eat it without removing half of the egg on the sandwich.  I have no problem spending money on a nice breakfast but if I want cream cheese with my bagel instead of sour cream I think I'll go to Murray's bagels instead.  As Jew who eats bagels almost every week I can honestly say I've ever seen someone put sour cream on their bagel.",1,1,1

The fact that they think this is a good idea will keep me from ever going to this restaurant.Could someone please tell their powers that be that there is simply zero justification for charging $9.00 for a SPAM musubi. The fact that in Hawai'i, one of the most expensive states in the U.S., SPAM musubi is like $1.00 to $3.00 should be an indication that The Dutch is just screwing over their uninformed customers, as well as appropriating Hawaiian culture inappropriately with their version of a ""luau"".Also, from the photos of their SPAM musubi on these reviews, they don't even know how to make them with the proper SPAM to rice ratio.

168,Mark M.,"Austin, TX",775,943,536,2.0,1/19/2014,"My friend took my here to celebrate my birthday while I was in NYC for work. She's raved about this place. We've known each other for years and are always on par and on the same page when it comes to food and restaurants. It seems that, with The Dutch, we have our first foodie friend disagreement! The atmosphere is lovely: warm, comfy, the kind of place you could hang around for a while a have a long, slow dinner. The night started great. I was truly excited by the menu and excited to dive into deciding which cocktails and wine I wanted to have. We started with a selection of oysters. All fresh, briny and simply yum yum yum. We tried a few different cocktails. All of them seemed a little off--as if they were trying too hard to create something unique. The last cocktail I ordered was the ""Emerald City"". It was repulsive. Bright green--like some nasty slushy you'd get at a street fair. We put it at the edge of our table as to clearly signal it wasn't to our liking. The servers ignored it and did not ask us if everything was ok. House-made rigatoni is solid. Grilled red chicken is flavorful and some of the most moist chicken I've ever had (although served not quite hot enough, temperature wise). The major screw up with the cocktail in addition to the fact that service was just completely off the entire night leads to my two Yelp star review. We had a few different waiters throughout the evening, and none of them seemed to know what was going on. To be fair, the manager brought our dessert (which we ordered and paid for) out with a candle for my birthday. I just bit the bullet and politely asked him to taken the virtually untouched Emerald City, telling him ""it's just not good"". He removed it from our check.",3,,

170,Sarah E.,"Monrovia, CA",1,13,0,5.0,10/17/2016,"reading some of these reviews.. makes me wonder if we ate at the same place.  Our experience at The Dutch was top notch. We had a party of 7 and had a reservation on a Sunday evening.. perhaps early by New York standards but as four of us had just completed the 39-mile AvonWalk, it suited us perfectly.  Started with cocktails which were excellent... and salads that were fresh and nicely seasoned but honestly nothing to write home about.  We all loved our entrees... I had the crab risotto, which consisted of a black rice risotto with the crab mixture on the side of the plate, sort of a yin & yang combination.  The elements were delicious separately and together, and a perfect amount.  The black sea bass was perfectly cooked.  The steak tartare was some of the best we've ever had, chopped to beautifully diced consistency, not a pasty mince.. impressive knife skills by the chef.  The hay-smoked duck was crispy and tender and delicious.  Another friend had the hangar steak with kimchi rice which was unusual and spicy, while another had salmon, and the last person had the spicy roast chicken, which tasted like chicken basted in tabasco or cholula sauce... simple, but perfectly executed.  The desserts were really outstanding ... the nutmeg ice cream was amazing.  I only wish we'd ordered two scoops instead of one, because it was the smallest dessert that came to the table.  The pumpkin donut with ginger ice cream came with 3 large pastries plus the ice cream.. could have been enough for the whole table.  The waitress graciously separated the bill for our table.  The wine steward did his best to interpret the tastes and needs of members of our party, and everyone left feeling satisfied by a wonderful meal.  We didn't find the noise level to be uncomfortable.  The restrooms are downstairs, so persons with mobility issues might be challenged.  But overall we had a wonderful experience, felt like we had discovered a great neighborhood gem, and enjoyed a meal prepared by people who truly cared about food.",,,1

Updated review","The Dutch is an upscale restaurant and bar with prices to match. The crowd type varies by the time of the day but generally you can't toss a bottle without hitting a wall streeter, real estate guy, or a dolled up member of the hair-flip-n-giggle set. But that doesn't mean you'll get a cold reception at the Dutch if you're dressed casual or don't fit the demographic. My wife and I are terminally uncool and dress down...  but we have been consistently well-treated at this busy bar. The craft cocktails are good and - if you're adventuresome - ask your bartender to recommend a drink.The food is exceptional - seafood or otherwise. They have some of the cleanest oysters we've ever seen - no grit and no shell bits. The Shrimp Cocktail with Crab Louis dipping sauce is great. And pretty much every special we've tried is a rock-star. My wife and I aren't heavy into desserts but we plowed through the Banana Cream Pie (with a ridiculously good chocolate-peanut butter ice cream) like we were starving.The service is as good as the food - with the bar and hosting staff being very attentive. I can't remember the names of all the folks who've been solicitous to us (there are quite a few) but Anthony, Rachel, Yuri, Rueben, and Cooper are always delightful.And to the wall-street wonk who was trying to 'compliment' his far younger bartender last night... you were about ten years behind the times when you gave her 'mad props' on her skillz. Painfully out of date, dude, ya dig? :)",2,2,

173,Elizabeth R.,"Potomac, MD",0,16,10,2.0,7/6/2016,"Went for the 4th of July luau party and we had to wait 45 min past our reservation.  I imagine it only got worse for people with reservations later in the day.  At one point they said our table was almost ready and brought us to the hostess stand.  After 10 more minutes of waiting, my friend joked ""Did we lose our table?"" to which the hostess replied with a dead look in her eyes, ""No.""  It was really rude and awkward...The food was ok.  Not great enough to make up for the rest.",2,,

175,Mihaela D.,"Lakeville, MN",15,4,0,1.0,7/4/2017,"Ordered the steak to be well done. They took 1h15 min approximately to make.... steak ended up being overdone and a little burnt on one small edge. Rice was the most horrible taste I have ever tried, fried rice with kimchi to be exact- worst possible combination. Ordered a side of fries which were super greesy. Husband had the pig which tasted like garbage, like it was cooked a while ago.  They gave us a round of beer for free because of the long wait... this was after we had already had 2 rounds each -I thought the effort for laughable and they could have done better. I would not recommend this, way better tasting restaurants in New Tork than this!",,,
176,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",169,571,866,5.0,2/16/2014,"This is in my top three favorite restaurants in NYC (along with Takashi and Casa Mono). I've been to The Dutch three times now and have never been disappointed!Last night, my boyfriend took me there for my birthday and let me splurge! We started with four different types of oysters (absolutely delicious), a mini lobster roll each (also excellent) and the truffled beef carpaccio appetizer. I wouldn't say I'm usually a fan of raw meat but this was incredible - my favorite dish of the night actually. It came in a lovely dressing with parsley and tiny mushrooms.For main dishes, we shared the truffle fusilli (creamy, truffle-y, and wonderful) and the spiced pork with collared greens and grits. For dessert we shared the rum baba (great presentation - the dessert comes out and then they pour more than a shot of aged rum over it) and the lemon chess pie (highly recommended).The service was perfect, the atmosphere relaxed but upscale and the experience was memorable. My only complaint was I didn't love either of the drinks I ordered (the buttered rum and the emerald city cocktail). Both were far too sweet and did not go well with dinner at all. My boyfriend had a cocktail with cachaca and grapefruit juice and that was much, much better!",1,1,1

They moved the stroller to the basement to make room. Now the food. Chicken waffles are our favorite, which are not on the menu, so we decided to remix it: 2 apple waffles and 2 fried chicken entrees for the 4 of us to share. Everything was excellent. The fried chicken was well seasoned inside and out, I suspect the addition of Old Bay! The waffles were perfectly crispy and came with a vanilla cream sauce. We also got a a stack of the cornmeal pancakes, also delicious. To drink I had the Diamond Cutter, a well balanced passion fruit cocktail. The staff was friendly, especially Rueben at the bar. I'm looking forward to returning for dinner, and try his version of the Corpse Reviver.",,,

183,Aaron G.,"New York, NY",67,64,0,4.0,10/22/2016,"I think The Dutch really stands out on the service. The coat check is fast, and the front desk is friendly, efficient and realistic with wait times. Their bartenders take careful note of who shows up in which order and serve you appropriately. They even are careful to never pass drinks between members of a party at the bar.Our waiter was delightful, offering hefty pours of wine and a few quick jokes but never overstaying his welcome. Good advice on wines and appetizers, too.The food was solid but didn't blow me away. We started with a half-dozen oysters and the burrata, which was really delightful with sunflower toast and a side salad. I had the hangar steak with kimchi fried rice -- decently spicy with a cooked egg on top, and the steak was blackened and rare inside. My date had the scallops with lemonade foam and trout roe, and they were cooked perfectly and nicely presented. Would I go across town for any of these dishes? Probably not. It wasn't especially cheap or expensive for SoHo, either. I bet this place slays at brunch, though.Bottom line, if I were in the neighborhood, I wouldn't hesitate to eat here, especially if I had a larger group or needed a reservation on short notice.",,,
184,K F F.,"Freeport, NY",7,10,1,1.0,6/18/2017,The staff was very rude. The waiter wasn't good. We ordered 2 margaritas and they came half full with 4 extra large ice cubes.

188,Jackie B.,"New York, NY",96,138,5,3.0,4/3/2016,"Really cool vibe, good drinks, and awessssome biscuits. That said, our whole table of four ordered the burger despite our better judgement of more interesting things on the menu, and we were all left thoroughly unhappy. The burger is really average at best. That is a lot coming from a town that has so many awesome restaurants serving burgers. Heck, even the Italian place on my corner serves a better burger. For a place that has so much going for it, they can really step their burger game up. The bun was tasteless, the special sauce is useless, the two thin patties make it so most of the juice is lost, and the meat blend...well, I don't think it's Pat Lafreida, so why even make a burger then? Also, the ""homemade fries"" are identical to those you would find at the double arches establishment you see on every corner over America. I guess I'm bitter because this cost me $23.Mehhhhhhh. Try harder. But definitely order like 20 honey butter biscuits. Those were bomb.",3,,1

The setting is very dimly lit and intimate, and it's a lot bigger than it initially looks. Our waiter was attentive and everything was well timed. Cocktails were STRONG. We got different ones and both cringed with every sip, but I guess that's better than weak ones for the $$$. Had the king crab legs and the grilled pork chop. AMAZING. I could not stop thinking about that pork for hours after. For dessert we had the devils food cake, which was good, but the White Russian ice cream that accompanied it was CRAZY.

We showed up around mid to late afternoon but we were greeted and seated promptly (by some very pretty and kind hostesses btw). This jalapeño cornbread was brought out to the table and it was amazing! So soft, moist, and flavorful. Would've been content if that's all we ate during our visit. We decided on the Shrimp Hushpuppies. Phenomenal decision. The shrimp tasted so fresh and outer crust of the Hushpuppies were also crisp. They were served with a kind of aoli (don't remember what it was called) but complimented the Hushpuppies perfectly. For my entree, I ordered the Fried Chicken, which also comes with two biscuits and coleslaw. BEST. DECISION. EVER. Words cannot describe how amazing this dish was, although it took a while for us to finally get our food, it was well worth the wait! The biscuits were warm, soft, and smothered in a honey glaze. OMG. The chicken was seasoned magnificently, the crust was crispy and the inside so tender and juicy. I was in heaven.

193,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,5.0,2/25/2015,"Dinner at The Dutch is an amazing culinary experience! A cold snowy night last week, some colleagues/friends and I went to the West Village for supper at The Dutch. We walked into the restaurant and instantly felt at home. The space is balanced well, with a front foyer and coat room, two main dining rooms joined together by a large square-shaped bar, and then a downstairs area with an intimate private dining room. Each room feels very separate and somehow cozy, with low, but warm lighting. And the acoustics were amazing...we were able to easily hear each other even when the restaurant was entirely full. Our table was in the front dining room by a wall of windows, giving us a lovely view of the snow as it fell that night. The meal began (and ended) with cocktails, wine and prosecco. And on the suggestion of our highly skilled servers, we opted for a number of appetizers, including The Prince Platter seafood tower filled with oysters, clams, octopus, scallops, shrimp and crab claws. The presentation of this seafood tower was so impressive that we all took photos and posted them to Instagram. We also tried the Ravioli with Sheep's Milk Ricotta, which was my favorite item of the night. Homemade pasta and cheese drenched in a buttery sauce...delicious!For our entrees, we had quite a range of the menu represented at the table, though the Korean-Style Hangar Steak was very popular. Again, the plating and presentation of this dish was so simple but special, as it was served in a cast iron skillet and garnished with KImchi Fried Rice and a Fried Farm Egg. I ordered the Mahi Mahi which was cooked to perfection and complemented by a shared side of the Housemade Fries. How we had room for dessert, I really don't know, but we moved ahead with the delicious Banana Fosters Crepe and the Warm Apple Pie to share. I absolutely loved the Warm Apple Pie, and really appreciated that the top crust was created with individual pieces of dough cut into the shape of leaves...such a nice detail!Overall, this meal was truly awesome, the service was incredibly professional, and the ambiance was just lovely.

""Wow!"", is what I said when I sipped it. Idk if it was worth $16, but I had two more before the night was over.  Very high quality cocktail and delicious! My friend got the Hot Tin Roof cocktail and didn't care for it. For apps we got the calamari and ribs.  Both were outstanding and enough to share.  Calamari was a little spicy, which I like...love.  Most of us got the fried chicken which was out of this world.  Seasoned WELL, juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  All things that fried chicken should be and more. And the honey butter biscuits were insanely good! I even ate the little side of slaw and I DO NOT like slaw! My other friend got the snapper and while her plate looked disappointing compared to the chicken, she said it was very good.  All in all I will be back, but maybe on a special occasion, as my wallet cannot take this hit very often.  Bravo!",,,

Basically take your shittiest week at work, and double it, so that's what we were cooking with. We got out early and hit up the Dutch at 3pm, and drank our dinner that night! One fine ass perfect Manhattan after the next. Clearly the head bartender trains his staff well. The measurements were exact, the style was clean, and the service all around impeccable. I would recommend you get there early on a week night if you're looking for a cocktail. It can get very crowded. I can't speak a damn thing to their food - we just focused on drinks.

I got a lea upon entering; ordered a delicious rum cocktail; blew some bubbles on the sidewalk; and ordered a la raja china whole pig plate that was out of this world.

It was moderately loud, but my husband and I were able to carry on a conversation very easily. Place decor was cozy and comfortable. Our waiter, Brandon was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He really helped me decide on what to order. I ended up getting the Shrimp and Kimchi Fried Rice with Two Eggs and Grilled Pork Belly. Oh man. This dish was everything. A touch of spice from the kimchi, the pork belly was so flavorful, and the eggs were cooked to perfection. My husband order the Smoked Salmon and Bagel with Soft Scrambled Eggs and Trout Roe. Those eggs were unbelievable. Super luxurious.Looking forward to coming back soon (and ordering that fried chicken)!!!",,,
