0,Gerard P.,"Staten Island, NY",276,372,5,3.0,7/1/2018,"It's fast food at a Ferry terminal, so you wouldn't expect a Zagat experience. That said, this Wendy's is very well-run, which the long lines of people waiting to be served seem to illustrate. I went there for a limeade and a chocolate chunk cookie the other day-in retrospect, I probably should have ordered a Frosty.",,1,
1,Murat Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,2,4.0,4/21/2018,"I liked this burgers before. But now I changed my opinion. I can eat not, if I have choice compare with ShackEShack I won't choose Wendy's. If compare with Fiveguys I will choose Wendy's. But is really good.",,,
2,Dominik D.,"Staten Island, NY",191,2170,4908,4.0,12/20/2017,"The service can be a little slow, but they were courteous and the chicken nuggets came out pretty darn good.",,,
3,Jonathan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,92,130,4.0,9/3/2017,I gotta say that the workers of this location always get my order right and always have my food ready in time to make it on the ferry.,,,
4,Joseph M.,"Manhattan, NY",20,289,13,2.0,2/7/2016,"This has got to be the most un-organized, rudest and slowest Wendy's I've ever been to in NYC. The person taking your order is both talking to her friends and taking your order at the same time, and gets your order wrong. If you were paying attention, you would've gotten my order right. I ordered one thing, and it took 15 minutes to make, when other Wendy's has it ready for me to go when I order. Rude service, ghetto attitudes, definitely not worth it.",3,3,2
5,Jerome Espinosa B.,"Manhattan, NY",231,662,196,1.0,12/9/2015,"Don't order here when the boat is arriving soon in 10 minutes. They won't give u your complete order. I had to ask for my soda, w/c was given me. But when i asked for the nuggets, the staff rudely replied that food is not served from her section. This attitude pissed me as i was seeing all the doors were closing on me from the boat entrance. I tossed them the burger, fries, & soda as i hastily went before i am left by the boat & be made to wait 30 minutes for the next boat. What a very lousy food experience. SMH.This store should only get staff and managers who live in Staten Island, and who take the boat. As such, they would better understand the necessity of being quick and prompt in properly taking and giving orders of customers.",1,,1
6,Amanda T.,"Graniteville, NY",87,27,50,1.0,7/21/2016,"Absolutely disgusting. Ordered 2 chicken caesar wraps & the guy working didn't even know what I was talking about, had to ask a manager if they carried the item and then proceeded to just ring me up for 1. After my order was done whispered and laughed to the girl next to him. The workers have very unprofessional, rude attitudes. As I went to eat my food the chicken was uncooked, very gross.. Will never order here again.",2,,
7,Christine P.,"Manhattan, NY",86,39,6,2.0,11/21/2016,"I work down the block and live on Staten Island so I'll stop by for a quick eat. There has been many occasions where they are out of sweet & sour sauce, ice and baked potatoes. the service could be better too.",,,

Updated review",Their improving! Rush hour staff the best good nuggets and service.. ! Waited only 30seconds!,,,
9,Anthony F.,"Staten Island, NY",4,3,0,4.0,6/2/2016,"Brittany, at the register, is the best. She made sure I got my order in a timely fashion, before my boat. Even though she was ringing up customers, she made sure, updated me, and let me know when my order would be done. She is a boss. I didn't know where to leave this feed back. But her etiquette at the register is unparalleled from any other fast food experience I have had. In NY it's acceptable to ignore the' how are you' but she took her time and was so sweet. Her interpersonal skills will get her far, no matter where she wants to go. So thank you so much Brittany!!!!",,,
10,Delia M.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/15/2017,So disappointed. I can make a creme brûlée faster than they can serve small fries. Just wasted my money and had to run because I almost missed the ferry.,,,
11,A Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,70,27,3.0,12/27/2016,I try to come here whenever I'm taking the ferry. Fast service. Good deals and the customer service is friendly. I've never had any problems with the staff or getting my order before the boat arrives.,,,
