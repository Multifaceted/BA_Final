Updated review","Updated review...I guess I expected a little more. Here again for the marathon, and everything is the same - great location, great service, and great amenities.  BUT - this time the hubby and I upgraded to the presidential suite (room 4344) and I am left completely unimpressed. We will start from the beginning:We were granted early check in, and the lady at the front desk, Yessina, was incredibly kind and helpful.   She explained the perks (internet, executive lounge, Hilton honor credits), and then handed me the keys. I then drug my 4 giant bags (hubby was parking the car) over to the elevator.  Now, I'm not super high maintenance, but there are some perks I will enjoy w/o issue....one of those is baggage assistance when I'm clearly toppling over.  Not one person, at any moment, asked to help with my bags. There was no semi-special welcome or amenity that made you feel that the extra money you spent was worth it.   After I drop bags on the elevator and drag my crap a couple hundred yards (felt like miles) I walk into my room.  First thought - subtle and clean...big and welcoming.  But then I looked a bit harder and realized how un-presidential this room really is. Cheap furniture, tiny fridge with nothing in it, no robes, two queen beds (no king rooms?!), lack luster lighting, and a bathroom smaller than the closet.  Really.  The bathroom was made for a small, regular room.  I actually looked around for another bathroom assuming that was the 2nd bath. The view was great though.  Good skyline and a bit of the trees from Central Park peeking out.   The room has a lot of natural light - so that is a huge plus. I understand that this isn't the Four Seasons or the Ritz,  but I just spent an evening at the Loews in Santa Monica - in a regular room - and was greeted with champagne, the bathroom was three times as big as the one in my ""presidential suite"" and had robes to die for.  How is it that Hilton is completely passing up the clientele that WANTS TO PAY FOR THE MORE LUXURIOUS OPTION?!  This is NYC, not Des Moines. This is a Hilton hotel, not the Hampton. I am quite disappointed in the room for the cost.  This should be called a suite...or an executive suite.   This is, in no way, a presidential suite.",1,1,1
1,Sunny C.,"Lynbrook, NY",1364,368,1524,4.0,10/29/2018,"Really enjoyed my time here! I came here for a law conference on a Saturday. The New York Hilton is located just a few steps away from a Starbucks, the famous Halal Guys, Times Square, and Radio City! I came on a weekend where New York was hit by a Nor'easter. There were plenty of umbrella bags in the lobby and it was nice and dry. There were carpets laid out so that with all the people coming in and out, no one would tread water in and slip. There were nice pumpkin decorations in the hallway too, a contest. I was surprised that there was no wait for an elevator to get up since it was such a huge conference. Very pleased that there were enough elevator sections for all guests and conference members! The conference space on the second floor is spacious and looked pretty new. The rooms were all well marked. The bathroom was very nice. Well lit and very clean!",25,7,21
2,Eddie S.,"Fort Myers, FL",97,422,101,3.0,9/20/2018,"I couldn't understand why this particular property was cheaper than other comparable hotels in the area until I stayed here. I have to agree with many of the reviews I have read on Yelp and will address them below:1. The check-in process: was actually pretty good. I arrived on a Saturday around 1 pm with no line. What you may not realize when you book is that there is an additional $25/day fee added onto your bill that you must use for the lounge ($15), the Herb N Kitchen store ($10) and premium internet. As a Diamond member I already receive premium internet so I could have cared less, but they did not discount that fee. Also, for snacks, I had access to the Executive Lounge but still no discount so every night I had to go to the store and buy junk I didn't need just to use the $10 on my tab. There were very few drinks in the lounge that were under $15 so I went over this every night. I will say that this is a brilliant idea for Hilton as it forces you to visit and then spend money where you normally would not. 2. The room: it was a nice room; however, someone in another post mentioned a smell in the room. I didn't notice this at first, but when I went to bed I smelled a slight urine, musky scent in the sheets. I hoped this would go away when housekeeping changed the sheets but it did not so it must be in the mattress.3. Executive Lounge: while most hotels that I have stayed in offer snacks and complimentary drinks (alcohol), this property charges a fee for wine and beer...and not a cheap price either, in my opinion. We didn't realize this the first night, and since we could not use our $15 bar credit, we were out additional money we should have used at the bar. I can't say anything else that is negative about the lounge as the breakfast was decent and free, along with the nighttime snacks (free).4. Check-Out: nightmare. I would typically not go through the line; however, I needed the bar and store charges carved out from the hotel bill as my company will not accept charges lumped in all together...so I got in line. The Hilton Honors line was longer than the regular line and moved slower. A couple of Honors members went in the regular line and were done well before I made it to the front desk. Yes, I know, I am a glutton for punishment, but I knew as soon as I moved over into the faster lane, my lane would pick up. Anyway, I told the Guest Relations person what I needed and he said that can't be done. I explained that I talked to someone the night before and he stated it could. Again, he said all he could do was put the grand total on a separate page so that is what I got. To be honest, I did expect more out of this property. I will say that I had a couple of issues during the stay and they resolved the issue fairy promptly and went beyond my expectations with apologies. For that I am thankful.",2,,
3,Eileen C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1025,117,343,4.0,7/5/2018,"The Hilton Midtown's best feature is it's location. It's minutes walking distance to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall and 5th Avenue shopping. I'd recommend the hotel to folks unfamiliar with NYC just for the location alone. Even the most directionally challenged individuals out there will be able to navigate from this hotel to many of the most popular NYC attractions. I think some of the rooms have been renovated here and some haven't based on other reviews I see. The room I stayed in on the 5th floor was very modern and doesn't look like some of the other rooms I see from other Yelpers. Maybe I just got lucky or something? Lol....Pros - Outstanding location, nearly 24 hour food available downstairs (it's not cheap though), close proximity to the subway, huge fitness center with weights and plenty of treadmills. There's great views from the fitness center as well. Plenty of elevators was a plus as well. The rooms are small, but not for NYC. Our room had a frig and safe too. Finally, there was a large strip of outlets at the bed for all of our electronics - which was great.Cons - The full size beds were small and too soft for my liking. Overpriced hotel food and drink -- I'd recommend you get your water and stuff across the street at Walgreens and then keep your frig stocked. Overall, I'm surprised at the bad reviews -- I think I may have landed a newly renovated room though based on other photos. :)",7,4,7

6,Jane L.,"Queens, NY",455,559,1732,3.0,7/28/2018,"New York Hilton is conveniently located to all the sight and sounds of Midtown and many of the tourist attractions. Subway station close by. It is a hotel for tourist, conference attendees, and so much more.There is no coffee machines in the room as compared to other Hilton Hotels and sister companies. So you will have to go downstairs or outside to grab that cup of Joe.There is a daily mandatory charge of $25.00 that is added to the bill. It's called an ""Urban Destination Charge"" with premium guest internet access; daily $15 beverage credit in Lobby Lounge or Bridges Bar; daily $10 food credit in Herb N' Kitchen (grab and go only); local and toll-free calls. The hotel staff will not tell you this there is a card under your key card that provides description of fee.Must show ID, when checking in as well as ID of guest that is staying with you will be check for security purposes.Bathroom tub and shower was not cleaned so good.

7,Mickey H.,"Reno, NV",15,114,40,3.0,8/30/2018,"For a Hilton, i would expect a bit more. I understand the traffic flow at a midtown hotel is rather high but it's enough to be frustrating and distract you from your stay. It feels at times like being run through a cattle camp as the numbers of people can get really high.The rooms themselves are nothing special and the craftsmanship in the rooms is lacking with tile and trim pieces inproperly installed.The amenities are standard for a city hotel with a restaraunt and bar on site.The price is standard for the area but I think you can probably find a better place in the area with a more personal feel and will look elsewhere next time.",,,
8,Gabriella R.,"Atlanta, GA",15,102,362,4.0,4/2/2018,"I love the location of the New York Hilton Midtown. It is right in the center of a perfect area that is a short walk to enjoy Times Square, shopping, Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center, amazing restaurants, and so much more beauty of New York City.The gym at the Hilton has a variety of cardio machines and lifting equipment. For a hotel, I was very impressed. The views from the fitness center are stunning. Looking out over skyscrapers and the New York sky is just stunning. This trip to the Hilton, I was a bit disappointed by the cleanliness of our room. The bathroom shower was filthy and the liner to the shower was quite dreadful as it was full of mold.  For the sticker price of this hotel a night, this is absurd. I love sitting and enjoy cocktails in the lobby, but be prepared, the drinks are priced very steep and at times the service is non existent.  I've sat for almost 15 minutes without it being a packed bar without being offered services. I also witnessed a guest curse the staff for their terrible service and being ignored.  A little annoying, frustrating, and reflected very poorly on bar staff service.",2,,
9,Takeshi Y.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1187,226,5649,2.0,2/3/2018,"1. The New York Hilton Hotel, Midtown is very conveniently located in the Midtown or Theater District in Manhattan, NY. It is a high quality 4 star hotel.2. I have personally visited the NY Hilton Midtown on the occasion of the events of business, expo, and my alumni (Maryland Institute College of art in Baltimore, Maryland). The photographs attached here are from this MICA Alumni gathering event on February 17, 2017 there.3. ROOM & EVENT STAFFSThe event room of the New York Hilton Midtown for our MICA Alumni event was rather small. nevertheless, the room was elegantly modern and clean. The event staffs (reception cold food section, beverage table) in tuxedo and black bow tie were so professional and hard working people (not untrained a young kids). The empty drinking glasses and small ceramic cold food dishes were immediately removed from each table (no chairs) there by them. (There are many rooms on the floor but each were all used for small events for the evening on that night. It was a very busy evening there.) They served party standard alcohol beverages only. They prepared beverages for the gathering of alcohol lovers. (This is for the alumni of the university, including someone with the age of barely passing 20 years old, so why not they serve more non-alcohol beverages?). I do not drink alcohol at all whatsoever. They did not have any fruits juice, or diet soda (or any soda variety), or high-end bottled tonic water (Perrier, etc.). So, all I can drink was a glass of water there, sadly.   4. APPETIZERSI was very curious about what kind of appetizers the New York Hilton Midtown serves for our several hours of evening event at the NY Hilton Midtown hotel. This is because it really expose the level of the hotel, based on my first hand experience of attending hundreds of such events in many major cities in Japan and America. They served sliced small pieces (1/4 shape) of plain (no tastes) small size naan breads, that can fit to the small white serving ceramic dishes there for us. For that, they also prepared 5 different types of non-spicy and tastelessly faint-flavored non-oil-based Western-flavored pasty condiments. (See my attached photo below.) The flavor of them was dominated by the olive oil and cheese for pleasing the pallet of the Westerners. If you remove all the dramatic spices and herbs from the Indian food, you now get what this hotel served us for our reception for the evening. I did not enjoy them at all whatsoever sadly. I was disappointed in multiple levels.  NOTE: Compare these to the those, that were served at the Nirvana Indian buffet restaurant by the Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, New York. I published a review with photos here in yelp.5. JUDGEMENTThe quality of the event room and the staffs' service was solid 4 stars BUT the quality of the appetizers and drinks there was so bad and barely 1 star in my personal opinion.

10,Addy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1018,531,2274,2.0,9/10/2018,"One of the worst check in experiences I have ever had. I arrived at a pretty popular hour, apparently, and there was a huge event taking place here in which most people were staying at the hosting hotel which was the Hilton, Midtown. I am not exaggerating when I say, there were three people checking guests in and over 100 people in line. What really bothered me is, I am an Elite member and there was no Elite member line. I even tried calling to see if I could check in online, but after being passed on to several different confused representatives, I gave up. Frustrated, after almost an hour in line after a full day of travel, I was finally able to check in. The room itself was fine, spacious and accommodating. What was the most frustrating thing is, the elevator situation. There are different bays of elevators for different levels of floors. The elevator situation so congested, that I was in an elevator with over 20 people at one point, and most times had to wait 10 minutes to even get in line. It made me late on several different occasions and I was not the only frustrated guest. It is in a pretty decent location, in which you can walk to several different attractions. However, there are a lot of hotel options in this area, and I would not recommend this one for that reason. There is a grab and go style restaurant as well as a gift shop on the first level, all of the ballrooms an event spaces are on the second level. It seems like this was a very old hotel, I even had to write to the Hilton to tell them my experience. I will not be returning here.",4,3,1
11,Mitch E.,"Atlanta, GA",277,181,662,1.0,9/24/2018,"This Hilton is relying on its location size and the Hilton brand name. At check-in I was told communications from Corporate Hilton did not matter.

14,Alyson B.,"Downtown, Austin, TX",164,1,0,3.0,11/9/2018,"The hotel has a great location. Unfortunately we did not have a great experience. To start, there was a very long line at the check-in desk. We are presidential diamond and the regular line moved quicker than the Honors. The lady who checked us in did not explain things well (such as the daily credit that can be used at the bar/Herbs kitchen). As if waiting in the long line once wasn't enough, our key did not work for the executive lounge so we had to get back in line later that day to have our keys re activated. This time we choose the regular line as it again moved quicker than the Honors line. Every single time we left the hotel we noticed how terribly long the lines were. Perhaps they could hire more front desk attendants. Unfortunately the staff was not very friendly. You would think the largest Hilton in the world would have customer service figured out.Also, they will charge you $5 per bag to hold your bags. In the executive lounge, beer and wine are not free like they typically are at other Hilton branded hotels.",,,

The hotel cafe had overpriced items. I paid $4 for a bottled juice, but its NYC and its a hotel. I'm used to it, but pointing it out in case you're not.  The breakfast buffet was really good! Made to Order omelets were amazing, fruit, bacon, etc. If you aren't looking for a fancy breakfast and want quality food, this is a great option.Note:  The seating in the cafe for the buffet are low profile, so sit in a standalone chair.

17,Janell C.,"Cerritos, CA",368,61,14,1.0,7/21/2018,"I came here to enjoy a special weekend with my daughter before she spends a week here with a school-related MUN conference. We checked into this hotel about 1:30 this morning. As soon as I walked into the room, I was overwhelmed with the smell. It smelled like dirt and old cigarette smoke. It reminded me very much of Circus Circus, where the smell is permanently embedded in the walls (we recently visited there while in Vegas to see if it had changed since we were kids). The room itself is outdated and in need of repair. There is dirt in most corners of the room and parts of the walls and doors are chipping and coming apart. I opened up the curtain to see the view and I find oils from fingers and head marks on the the window. I was exhausted when I arrived. We had just traveled from Ca and had 3 hours in delays. When we arrived to check in, there was a long line. After waiting in the line for about 10 minutes, we decided to ask the bell desk if they could take our bags so we could go eat. We didn't have a chance to eat all day and realized we have another long wait. The gentleman at the bell desk said we could leave our bags with him and to come back and pick them up when we are ready for check in (wasn't sure why he didn't offer to take it to our room). We went outside to Halal Guys, ate quickly and came right back in. Our luggage was next to the desk, unattended. We stood there for a couple minutes with the intention to tip the guy for ""watching our bags"" but nobody came back to the desk. We took our bags and got back into the check-in line. I kept looking back at the bell desk and the gentleman returned about 10 minutes later. The line to check in was a little shorter and we were helped about 20 minutes later. We booked through the MUN group because of the group rate. The gentleman who checked us in said two other people were staying in our room. That worries me so we messaged our organizer and he informed me that the Hilton staff member who booked it had their names put on because those named were staying a day after the conference (we came in 2 days early).Back to the hotel room...after the initial shock of the outdated and dirty room (it felt like a Motel 6), I decided to take a shower to wash the long day off of me. I opened up the floor towel and it was full of dark curly hair. I then proceeded to get into the shower to find that the water was ice cold! No heat at all. I got out and found a piece of paper in front of the TV saying there's no hot water until 6am. Enough was enough. I was so tired but I couldn't wait until morning for resolution. I called downstairs and asked for the manager. A gentlemen got on the phone and I explained the condition of the room I was in (the smell, no hot water, poor room condition). I could hear the manager sigh in a very un-empathetic tone and then he replied that there are no more rooms available in the hotel and I had to wait until tomorrow to request a move. I was shocked and disappointed. This is supposed to be a very special weekend with me and my daughter. At this point (2:30am), I decided to try to get some sleep. Starting at 7am this morning, I was woken to tons of banging and voice noise from the room or hall. It continues, but at this point, should I have expected any different? At least my daughter can sleep through it. It's now 9:30am and I'm pretty sure the people in the room next to us are having some sort of party. Music is blasting and I can hear a lot of people. This is crazy.",2,1,1

20,Roni K.,"Fremont, CA",30,143,573,3.0,3/24/2018,"Overall this is a nice hotel. The lobby is bright and open. Check in wasn't as quick as I thought it would be. As a Hilton member, I checked in the day prior. However, from a customers perspective, you would think that once you check in via the members website, you wouldn't have to spend more than a few minutes at the front desk. After flying across the country and getting in around midnight, all anyone wants to do is go straight to their room. It took the front desk about the same time to check us in as if we just showed up without a reservation. Apparently, they changed our room and ""upgraded"" us to a different room. Yes, I said ""upgrade"" sarcastically. We walked to the elevator and passed by a little to-go cafe. It was cute and convenient. We grabbed some lite late dinner and headed to our room on the 41st floor. My husband tried using the key card but it didn't work. So I used the digital key, which is a pretty cool key I opted for.Upon entry we noticed that the room is not well lit. Granted one side of the wall are big windows but there wouldn't be any privacy if we opened the drapes. The room lights could have been brighter. In total there are 5 globe lights. They were quite dim. The bathroom light was very dim as well, not great for doing makeup. The only other mirror is in the hallway- and that light was more of a nightlight. I was surprised they didn't have robes. For $300+ a night, I would appreciate some robes. The towels could have been softer and bigger. The pros? The bed was very comfortable. There's a small fridge, hair dryer, iron and ironing board. The tv was ginormous. The shampoo and soap smells good. The shower is decent with good pressure. The sink- a bit small, it hard to avoid splashing water.",1,,

22,Winnie C.,"Richmond, VA",1,63,171,1.0,1/9/2018,"This place is Fawlty Towers, but without the humor. It is a sprawling Hilton with poor communication, emboldened by being too big to fail, so your service will depend on which employee you ask.  Positives first:1) You can't make coffee in your room, but you can request an electric kettle, complete with paper cups. Sometimes tea bags will be included, sometimes not. When they are, they're Harney & Sons. So that's nice.2) At least one of the concierges went above and beyond to locate an adapter for my middle-aged MacBook. Since Apple is notorious for tweaking things into obsolescence, she did not succeed, but A+ for effort, which is too much more than can be said for the rest of this experience.Not so positive:1) Upgrades that aren't: We were here for an academic conference the first week of January. As a ""gold"" member, I was automatically given an upgrade to a room that would be undergoing construction, so we were forced to move on the fifth night. (Indeed, the jackhammering on the top floor above us was loud and constant, impeding our work.) The room itself had a malfunctioning thermostat, which was not a great experience during the bomb cyclone. Our room also lacked the customary guide to Guest Services, and this hotel is unusual for innovations that are not improvements. 2) No (conventional) room service:In lieu of room service, the Herb 'n' Kitchen--this Hilton's in-house Prêt à Manger / Au Bon Pain / Panera equivalent--can deliver its soup-and-sandwich offerings to your room.3) No in-room coffee maker, with confusing alternative:Herb 'n' Kitchen will deliver coffee to your room, but the hours aren't posted, but it was never made clear when or whether or not the delivered coffee is complimentary. When I requested coffee delivery after 2, I was told I had to make the request before 10:30, but when we called the next morning, we were told to wait until after 6:30, when the phone rang unanswered. The coffee did finally arrive, with a pair of Smart Waters, and the order was complimentary. In the grand scheme of first-world hospitality problems, though, it was a ridiculous ordeal.4) Bars, bars, bars, with a hotel attached: Unlike neighboring hotels, this one has no restaurant, let alone fine dining. Apart from the aforementioned Herb 'n' Kitchen, it boasts three bars: Minus 5, an ice bar; the Lobby Lounge, a gastropub with limited menu; and the Bridges bar, with an even more limited menu. Plus, you can buy wine and beer at Herb 'n' Kitchen. So, I suppose this hotel's modus operandi is to keep its guests liquored up?5) Segregated breakfast buffets: Gold status includes complimentary continental breakfast, which offers a vast array of perfectly wonderful cold selections from a well-stocked buffet. The American Breakfast included the typical hot items as well as Japanese and Chinese options, such as miso soup, congee, and dumplings. Both breakfast bars were exorbitantly priced ($28 and $40, iirc), so don't pay out of pocket. There are so many options within steps of the hotel, and we would have pursued them had our breakfast not been complimentary.6) Audaciously priced business services: If you need to print anything, beware that this Hilton's 24-hour Business Center is very not free. To print, you must log onto one of the desktops, minimum $10 for max 10 minutes ($1 each additional minute), and printing costs $1 per page. Taxes will be assessed in addition. So, go find a copy place.7) The pièce de résistance: I received SEVEN folios with different charges, and the one that finally posted is baffling. To accommodate our train, I requested late check-out (which is one of the benefits of my membership), but was quoted different times by different reps before a charge would be imposed. Depending on whom I talked to, this charge differed. I can't help wondering how this inattention reflects cynicism about business travel.",7,1,

Our room was on the 40th floor and we got the privilege to enjoy the Executive Lounge. I will summarize the most important points that led me to give a 5-star-review (I rarely do that):1. The location is the BEST in the city.2. The room is ALWAYS perfectly clean and tidy.        I MUST mention our AMAZING Room       Attendant, Paula Lazo, who was always      welcoming, smiling, kind and attentive to our      needs and demands. She is definitely an asset      to the Hilton. 3. The Executive Lounge is a very pleasant space         which offers pretty good food& beverage       (although they always serve the exact same       and it is a bit boring...) and service oriented       staff. I have to mention the exceptional       hostess Sharon, who was always  friendly and       helpful. 4. The front desk is professional and attentive.      I'll have to mention Nati, who was        extraordinary. So if you're considering a hotel in NYC, The Hilton Midtown will definitely be the perfect choice.Enjoy",,,

Such that I decided not to stay here.  The security guard Polanco was extremely rude, refused to let me go to the check in. Then he verbally threatened me. I do not appreciate this treatment. And I believe polanco is racist. He said I have been here before,  and I never have. Maybe he mistook me for someone else, but there is no reason for his insanely rude behavior.Just tried to address this with the manager Brian. He rudely hung up on me.",1,,

The bed and sheets smelled like sweat, mildew and urine. I requested a different room - new room had same issues and AC was not working. I asked manager (Brian) to please fix it as I was running out for a couple of hours. Just got back to my room and it was not fixed, called again and still have not had anyone come up. Room smells.

Once I arrived, I never saw such a long waiting line to check in. The front desk told me it was because there was a dance competition, but during my three day stay, the line was always ridiculously long.  It took me 40 minutes to check in as a hilton honor member. They were handing out bottled water but if you are a Hilton, this is absolutely not acceptable.The room that I stayed seems muggy and the A/C was not working well. The first night, the inside temperature was 74 degrees and muggy even though I tried to bring the temperature down with maximum fan speed, it was just very hot.  With such an excellent location, this hotel needs an overhaul if you want to continuously bring in new customers. The competition is fierce in midtown New York, and unless you upgrade your service and hotel infrastructure, you will be losing customers. I am not going to stay at this Hilton again.",,,

You might as well be some chewed gum on the sidewalk. I didn't feel the need to check reviews before I booked because I thought the name would be enough. CLEARLY I was wrong.I booked online and scored a sweet deal from what I could see: the ""All-Inclusive Sale"" so $284/night for a Deluxe Queen Room with free American Buffet and late check-out at 1 PM. Sounded great. (FYI it came to about $330/night after taxes.)We arrived at 12 PM, a few hours earlier than the 3 PM check-in. We were able to check-in early for a $25 fee (really? The room is ready but you're going to charge me?) but I was too tired to argue.The room was tiny, the window could be opened only about half an inch, there were holes in the wall, and we found a mouse hole under the desk. Yeah, on the 44th floor. Gross. We were only staying one night so we left it at that. The free American buffet? They ""forgot"" to give me my coupons. I had to request them.My late check-out? They get to decide if you can use it. What a joke. I asked an employee and she said it was unavailable. I waited thirty minutes and asked another employee, and she said maybe. She would let me know. I was getting annoyed so I asked a third employee and she gave me the 1 PM check-out. Why the complete lack of consistency? Don't trust anyone here and fight to get what you paid for. I PAID for late check-out and it was listed on my confirmation. I shouldn't have to beg for it.Furthermore, every interaction I had with an employee was rushed. They had zero customer service skills and were curt so as to get you out of there as quickly as possible. What happened to this brand?The only redeeming qualities about this hotel is the location and the water pressure in the shower. Everything else sucked. This experience would really have me rethink ever staying at a Hilton again.",25,11,10

So over priced.In the past 5 years, the Hotel has moved to cut costs anywhere possible compromising quality. From the time you arrive to the time you leave you will notice the difference.There used to be a nice large driveway on the first floor cabs and such could pull into to unload. The cheap ducks that own the hotel filled the driveway in to create additional retail. The best part is the retail location doesn't make sense and is always 75% vacant! Serves the cheap a holes right! In all seriousness, without the driveways, 100's of people are forced to exit their vehicles and cabs with luggage directly on 6th Avenue which is super busy and dangerous. I hope I get hit or run over so I can bring a lawsuit against these cheap Hilton ducks!They got ride of the room service. Now the only in food option available is the food deliver from the cafe in the lobby. It stops by 10 pm and the quality sucks. Again, the quality was better a years ago and since then they have gone with cheaper ingredients so it tastes terrible. It's also way over priced! For a small flat bread pizza, it's $30!Overall, I would not recommend staying here. It's such a rip off for the price. There are way better options in New York like Ace Hotel. I hope Hilton takes a loss on this operation every year because it's clear they only care about their bottom line margin.",5,,
33,Yaa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",199,97,232,4.0,5/3/2018,This review is based on the Hilton as a great meetup point / common space in Midtown. They have so much lobby / hallway space seating that you can easily meetup with friends for a quick chat inside / enjoy food and drinks at one of their many restaurant options / or just find a space to charge your device. They also offer 30 minutes of free WiFi. The new renovations are a plus!,2,1,2

They also have a place to get your picture taken in the lobby.  Its cool to retain those memories of your stay or if you are just going out for a night on the town.  Lastly there is a ICE bar attached to the lobby.  We didn't partake but would have been fun to go.  Great Place to Stay",,1,

The hotel itself is very conveniently located, the rooms were very small with no mini bar (which I expect in a Hilton.. but ok it's Manhattan). The room was clean, the hotel was nice, and like I said extremely conveniently located. Just 4 blocks or so from Central Park.Now to the water .... the bigger smart water water bottles were 8 dollars? Wait what? 8 dollars for water? I only made that mistake once. The hotel has a Starbucks across the street.. in the morning I got my almond milk Latte there and a cup of iced water (because Starbucks Water is filtered) you can get a Venti cup of Water and voila .. no more 8 dollar water bottles. Aside from that, I went to Wings.. and I'm vegetarian .. so their restaurant had to think on their feet (I usually only get a plate of veggies at events like these) but no .. they did an awesome job making a Pad Thai for me .. it was really good and I was pleasantly surprised.All in all, the food in the lobby is overpriced, but due to the convenient location .. there's a plethora of restaurants, coffee, smoothie, and whatever your heart desires just around the block. So it's def worth 4 stars!!!",1,1,

The wait to check in was over an hour. There are roughly 10+ stations to check guests in, there were only 3, sometimes 4 during prime check in hour on a holiday weekend. No water was provided at the hotel to honors members. They were unsure if the room was clean upon check in. Once we arrived in our room, the windows were not cleaned. They were extremely dirty like people had put their hands all over them and their foreheads looking out. The room otherwise was nothing to write home about. For the expensive price tag, it certainly is plain and boring. Housekeeping came knocking on our door the next morning at 9 asking when we were leaving. I feel like they should have that planned better where I'm not bothered during my one night stay. One positive, if you arrive early, the complimentary check your bags. If you are checking out, the fee is $5. Hopefully this Hilton gets their act together, because I will not be staying again.",,1,

41,Sylvia N.,"Gilbert, AZ",78,146,104,4.0,4/2/2018,"We came here for a conference and leisure. It has multiple levels of conference space and is quite impressive, being that they're able to host a large quantity of people, multiple conferences at once. They do offer free WiFi throughout, making it easy to connect without having to look for a ""conference code."" The remainder of the facilities are well-maintained and clean. The gym is quite impressive, offering multiple types of equipment in quantities that allow for more than 2 people to work out, and a lot of space, varying equipment for a diverse and thorough work out. The elevator is also super fast. They're divided by floors.  My room was on one of the top floors and it took me less than 30 seconds to get there. The room itself was on the smaller side but it was sufficient and they did a great job utilizing the space, maximizing its furnishings. There was a pull out couch, refrigerator, tv, all the standard amenities. The hotel is centrally located few blocks south of Central Park and north of Time Square. It's minutes away from a lot of the usual tourist attractions, food spots. The hotel does have a restaurant and bar on the ground floor but I didn't utilize it so I don't have an opinion about it. They also have a cafe. All the items were a little higher in price due to NY pricing and add on the fact that this is a hotel. At the front desk, a lot of times, there was a large line for check in and check out. It does move fast so do not fret. The employees are also super friendly so it makes the wait more bearable. They were offering bottled water when I first arrived. Few things I didn't like: -when you check in, bag check is free. When you're checked out, and you need a place to store your bags for a few hours due to late flight, etc, bag check is $4 per bag.-there is very little to no sitting space in the lobby. Early in the day, they use a small lounge space for sitting but when happy hour rolls around, they move it to a small space in one of their restaurants.

The AC in the room seemed to remain one temperature no matter what we set it at. This hotel was decent, the location is perfect only a few blocks from Central Park and Times Square.What brought down the rating for me was a bad customer service experience. For some reason our room keys stopped working, and when we went to the desk to see what was wrong, they had messed up our reservation. Two of us were on it, as I was staying a day later than my friend, and when it was explained we found out the man who checked us in not only messed up the dates, but didn't put my name on the reservation, meaning if my friend hadn't been there it would have been tough crap for me.Again, that didn't really bother me, we weren't mad just relieved. But then the clerk gave us a freaking lecture about how ""that man is human and we need to give him the benefit of the doubt, just like he himself was giving US the benefit of the doubt."" Let me repeat, me and my friends were not being mean, we were relieved because an issue was solved and yet we were getting a philosophical lecture from the hotel clerk while another one standing right there was laughing under his breath.

45,Erin M.,"Chattanooga, TN",18,9,4,1.0,7/24/2017,"Hilton name, NOT Hilton quality! We are very loyal Hilton customers, but this location has completely ruined Hilton for us. We have stayed here twice, 2-3 years apart, hoping the first time was a fluke. The lobby is nice and the location is very accessible, but the rooms feel and smell old. We had mold around the top of our sink and the bathroom had not been cleaned thoroughly. They will nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING (no coffee pot, no microwave, no free Wifi unless you join their Honors program, no breakfast, etc.). Staff are rude, condescending, and think very highly of themselves. The last time we visited, they had us barter our daily housekeeping service in exchange for ""free"" Wifi, which does not seem to be in line with the Hilton brand and seems very unprofessional to me.The only employees that are friendly are the housekeepers and the Hilton Honors reps. The Honors reps are only nice because they are trying to sell you a time share, and will try to recruit you immediately upon arrival to listen to their pitch. This bombardment feels very cheap, similar to when you are trying to avoid the kiosks at the mall that are trying to sell you cheap As Seen on TV products. If they do snag you for an appointment they will continuing calling you repeatedly if you don't make your appointment, as if you came to New York solely to listen to them drone on and on about time shares. Once you decline to purchase, they don't care anymore. We even said we'd like to take a few days to consider purchasing and we were shot down. They told us they only accept purchases on the spot, the day of your appointment. But, they at least send you on your way with a $100 Visa gift card.If you call or go to the front desk, they act like you are wasting their time. They say they will allow early check in/late check out, but it's like pulling teeth to be able to do so. We were told we could check out late due to a delayed flight that would have us sitting at the airport for over 8 hours. When the time came, they claimed they were completely booked full and couldn't even spare an hour for us, then left us on hold for 20 minutes waiting for a manager. Very overpriced and low quality. You do not get what you pay for here at all. Worst hotel I've ever stayed at.

Updated review",I used to be a fan but no more. The line to check in was ridiculously long. I was told rooms were ready but I had to lay $45 to get in early (early arrival fee). I had to get back in line after 2 to check in again to avoid the fee. If the rooms are ready and I'm a Hilton honors member you should give me the room. Marriott allows for early arrival and late check out without gauging me. I'm sure they will be happy to have me on my next visit.,2,,

The dinner was not bad, however, it was not consistent. I enjoyed my steak, but others complained of theirs being too dry. The bathrooms are well kept, and the coat check had good service. I was a little sad that one of the bars ran out of simple syrup! No old fashioned for me. I certainly found the location excellent.

Unfortunately, I was shocked to discover that the rooms don't have a coffee maker. I was reading reviews while I was staying at the hotel and the hotel's Director of Marketing said that the onsite cafe, Herb n' Kitchen, will hand deliver a cup of coffee to your room between the hours of 6am and 1am...but, this isn't true. I called Herb n Kitchen at 6:30am to request said cup of coffee, and they had automated answering machine stating that they're closed until 6am (clearly no one showed up to work by 6:30am). I also called guest services about the coffee, and they flatly stated, ""sorry, the rooms don't have a coffee maker."" They never mentioned anything about this elusive ""hand delivered coffee"". So, that was annoying. Also, the mini fridge in the room still had the last guest's leftovers stored in the fridge. Who knows how long it had been there...I wasn't about to open it and find out.Last, the hotel felt pretty humid. The AC automatically turns off, so when you return to your room after a long day, you're greeted with the smell of moist, stale, hotel room.

The door knob to the door was odd as well it faces down and swipe left to get out. Good lighting of the room and size. Not too noisy as I was on the 21st floor. They could have had more front desk clerks check people in as the line was kind of long even for a HHonors Member! Lastly, we wanted to ask about luggage hold and express checkout and the front desk clerk named Yesenia who worked on 1/1/17 at 3:25pm was not friendly at all.

We arrived around 3:00 and parked the car in the hotel parking, which was done really conveniently and fast, the check in line was long and there was a gentleman passing out h20 to all guests in line. The lady at the front desk wasn't very friendly, no welcome nothing, she asked me how I wanted to pay my bill, I told it was prepaid and she said ok and she had to check it, they still authorize is for $75 a night Incase you want extras.

We saw the housekeeping lady on Sunday before we went out around noon and gave her some tip so she call make up our room nicely, besides that when we arrived there were no glasses in the room, we called housekeeping for several minutes but no answer so we gave up. Next day we checked out and asked some staff that if the front desk can keep our luggage for few hours because our parking was till 3:00, they said we can ask the valet to keep the luggage, we asked valet manager and he had our vehicle brought down and we puts our luggage and they took it back up, I don't know his name but he was like Pakistani or Indian background very nice person. I would stay there again as it is very closely located to everything and I liked the rooms and the hotel overall.",,,

Updated review","We stayed here over Thanksgiving holiday, mainly because we wanted a hotel on the parade route and a room w a direct view of the parade.The process began nearly 6 months prior as we finalized plans for this event. The reservation process was pretty easy and the staff helpful. We needed a 2nd room for our son and his family. The nightly rate for the view room was ridiculously high plus a 5 night minimum but we decided to bite the bullet and get over it. I could've bought a good used car for about the same $$. LolCheck in was a breeze when we arrived. Separate check in for Hilton Honors members, a welcome perk. In a matter of minutes we had our keys and were on our way.There were 3-4 sets of elevator banks to keep guests moving freely. A concierge desk located right near the elevators to get help scoring those last minute theater tickets or any of the other local attractions. Our room was fairly standard by Hilton standards. An amazingly comfy king sized bed, cozy love seat that converts to a twin bed. Nice desk area near the window. Our TV was a little on the small inadequate size but not a complete bust. The bathroom and shower were adequate. The view from the room for the parade (14th floor) was amazing! Overall we were thrilled with the location of the hotel and a great venue for our Macy's Day Parade experience. Our son's room on a higher floor was completely remodeled and had like a 50"" flat screen as compared to our 36"" TV. I would definitely stay here again!",8,5,5

Yes I am a Hilton Honors member and so is everyone else, so that line was longer than the other one. Object when you get to the counter for the person there to get rid of you as quickly as possible. Was the reservation prepaid as planned of course not so why argue just swipe your company credit card. You too the business traveler can get taken at a mere $500 a night. Was it a $500. A night experience more like a $149. Hampton Inn without the cookies, breakfast and friendliness. Upon arriving at my average room. Yes it had a humongous tv, big deal it wasn't coming home with me. I took a shower that is where the fun began the water I couldn't manage to pull out the thing in the center enough to get water pressure. Also I needed to get past the whiskers left on the edge of the tub and in the shower curtain. Ewe gross. Sorry Hilton on a time schedule and no time to call in your housekeeper and maintenance person for you. So when I leave for the evening as events for my group were held in the ballrooms I didn't come back until after midnight that's the interesting part. You need to show your room key just to get inside the hotel. There was a couple ahead  of me that wanted to get in desperately but the guard wasn't budging and lied to them that the bar was closed. I got in went to the elevators right past the crowded bar. Went to sleep but the bed linens were like a very cheap motel and not inviting to sleep. So I didn't sleep, up again at 5 AM and checked out. I told the person at the desk about the whiskers in the tub she was not phased. I was another number to process. Even though it was centrally located I personally would not stay here again ,despite they were the host hotel to the trade show I was attending.",33,15,23
54,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,4.0,6/6/2017,"I came here the other night with my mother-in-law for her annual 25-year club celebratory dinner, hosted by the hospital for which she works. The event was held in one of the ballrooms on the third floor. It was easy to get to and there are plenty of staff to direct you of where to go. There was even a mini wine tasting being held in the lobby which I thought was pretty cool. We took the elevators up to a grand sitting area, waiting for the ballroom to be opened for the event. The ballroom was even grander. There were at least four bars available for the hundreds of guests that attended so I never found myself waiting for too long to make a drink order. The tables were set very nicely. Our appetizers were waiting for us at our places settings. We were served jumbo shrimp with farro and radicchio and a sexy burre blanc. I was happy enough to snag a couple of plates from another table where the guests never arrived (don't judge because they had to toss over a hundred plates, I'm sure, so therefore, I was merely helping to reduce the amount of food waste from the event). After some speeches and formalities we were served chicken breasts with roasted potatoes and baby zucchini. The main was good, the chicken was juicy but the way they served was a bit clumsy. A bunch of guys in suits, bumbling around and rudely pushing in between each guest to basically throw your food on the plate as quickly as possible before serving the next person. It felt very rushed. Our dessert consisted of a simple chocolate mousse which was plated beautifully, likely because they were prepared well in advance so each one looked beautiful and it tasted good. The bartenders were very nice, at least the bar I kept visiting. It was closest to our table section and the guy working it was very personable, striking up conversations and being genuinely pleasant. They're not allowed to solicit tips but if you ever attend an event here (or anywhere for that matter), please use your better judgment and tip the staff. They work very hard for a night of people essentially attending an event with open bar and free food, so you know people are taking full advantage of the amenities. I mean, the people seated at our table swiped the two wine bottle off the table and hid them in a bag. Not to mention the fact that, our ramble was reserved and they were never even supposed to be there; just a little side rant about the ratchetivity. I went to one other bar and the staff there were less sociable. I almost felt like I had to engage them in order to get a drink. I waited a bit and once I got to the counter, I just was not feeling the vibe, turned and saw my regular bar was finally empty and hightailed it back on over there and was served immediately, with a smile. The bathrooms were well maintained throughout the evening with every visit, they were clean and well-stocked. The lighting in the ballroom was great and when they opened the dance floor, the lighting was altered to give a more dance club feel. This would be an awesome space for a wedding, prom or any large group event. I would jump at the chance to visit again, despite some of the small setbacks. I mean, I don't need anyone to do back flips in order to keep me entertained but if I spend time to get gussied up for a semi-extravagant event, I would like to have the staff be personable, at best and maybe don a smile.",7,3,8

We were 3 guests along with my coworkers but due to mistake from my office only 2 rooms were booked. We requested at the lobby for another room. We did get a room for $612. We paid $399 per night for other rooms. We tried to negotiate to get  the same room for the price we paid for others. Elissa, the manager did not budge. I get it, it's capitalism you maximize your earnings when hotel is fully booked. When I reached to the room, i realized was a dungeon not a room but still I was ok with it as I needed a place to stay anyway. Day 2, when I returned to the room in the afternoon, my key stopped working. When I went downstairs to the lobby, I was told, my room was only booked for a day and they are fully booked they can not help it. Elissa was there, she was gracious but lacked brain and empathy both. Neither I nor my coworkers heard that room was booked for a day. In fact, I was told that they are fully booked therefore charges for both days are $612 each and I was ok with that. I had to finally move in with one coworker.

59,Karen K.,"Newark, DE",1,7,13,4.0,5/26/2018,"Arrival/Check-InMy family (husband and 7yo son) and I traveled to NYC via Acela train. We took a Lyft ride from Penn Station to the hotel rather than dragging our luggage on mass transit. We arrived at the hotel 20 minutes before official check-in time of 3PM, but were able to be accommodated.RoomWe booked the Two Bed Executive Suite. Our room was on the 43rd floor. Ears popped each time we took the elevator, but that's no big deal. The living room area had a table with 2 tall chairs, mini fridge, TV, L-shaped sofa pull-out bed, coffee table, and a sitting chair by the window. The windows had heavy drapes as well as pull-down shades. The bedroom had 2 double beds. We're used to a king bed at home, so the husband and I each took a separate double bed! There is another large TV in the bedroom, as well as a walk-in closet with full length mirror. There is a lockable door between the living room and bedroom areas. The bathroom access is through the bedroom area. Given the spaciousness of the rest of the suite, the bathroom was surprisingly small. Toilet, small sink, tub/shower. Towels are stored on a wire shelf at the far end of the tub. Not much storage space. Overall, pleased with the room. Executive LoungeIt is located near the front desk in the lobby. There are bottles of water and Perrier available for the taking. Breakfast is served from 6:30 to 11AM. This includes bagels, danish, muffins, croissants, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple. There are assorted small boxes of cereal and packets of oatmeal. There is a coffee machine for lattes and cappuccinos, in addition to urns of coffee, OJ, and the soda machine. Hot appetizers served from 5-7PM. This includes cheese, pita triangles, veggies & dip, chicken on a stick, wings, fried goat cheese balls. Between breakfast and hot snack time there are cookies. There are also cookies at 830PM. Herb n' KitchenDon't eat here. Well, let me rephrase that... don't eat the grab and go hot foods. They have likely been sitting there. Our mac & cheese was rancid, and the chicken sandwich was dry. We only chose to eat here because of the $10/day credit due to the daily urban destination fee. My suggestion is to stick with cookies, chips, drinks. Might as well use those credits, because you're being charged regardless. Negatives:- The pullout sofa had veggie straw remnants from a previous occupant, and was missing sheets. This was easily corrected.Positives:- Close proximity to subway stops and a 24/7 Duane Reed pharmacy.Overall, it's a nice hotel. Will definitely choose it again for our next trip to NYC.",2,,

For the duration of my stay, I had reserved an Executive Suite One Bed which at first glance looked great. Probably the worst part of this room was the bed.. considering the amount of money that was spent on the room, I would have expected a soft and comfortable bed. Instead I got something that was next to impossible to sleep on. The bathroom could use some work, paint was chipping and there was a problem with the plumbing for the bath tub. The A/C control was rather limited and could only be set to cool down to 67 degrees, which still felt hot nonetheless. The overall lighting can be okay if you turn on the extra lights in the room. The wall mounted lights were just not enough.Furthermore, services such as Room Service were also limited as this location has a market which provides those services instead of a full restaurant.

Updated review","Hotel has great location. That is about it. Rooms have a terrible musty odor. Only option was to buy a $42 candle in lobby to mask the stench. More unfortunate is the fact that there are no matches on the premises. I kindly asked the concierge if they had any and I received a very snarky ""why are going to smoke? You need to go outside!"" I tried to explain that my room stinks and bought a $42 candle in lobby to mask the horrible smell. Next terrible move by this woman was to chastise me that if I lit a candle in the roomthe fire alarm would go off? Really??Worst customer service at a concierge I have every had. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE YELP KEEPS FLAGGING THIS REVIEW AS INAPPROPRIATE?  Please explain your self yelp? Yourcustomer service is lacking as well! Or do you get paid by Hilton to remove the truth?Shame on both of you!In response to hotel:  front desk did not offer a different room. They offered to send up housekeeping to spray febreeze in room.

To have to get up, get dressed (dressed for the financial district of NYC is not the same as dressed for Sonoma County) catch the elevator, stand in line with the business people / bankers to pay $8 for a coffee in the lobby is way too much to ask at 7am EST.  Seriously.

The wall paper is peeling, the hallway carpet is gross, the entire hotel is completely dated. Once I entered my room I was met with a dingy odor. The same odor you receive walking into a pawn shop or older antique store. The furniture is old, brown and uncomfortable, the bedding is just a bunch of sheets thrown together meant to mimic the warmth of a comforter. Not to mention, despite being a Hilton Honors member, my complimentary WiFi did not connect, thus having to sit on the phone with technical support. Jose however was very kind and able to resolve my issues; that is the only 'highlight' of my stay. Customer service is rude and a joke. I will NEVER stay at another Hilton in NYC.

66,Jeongeun Jessie S.,"Houston, TX",86,1,0,1.0,9/11/2017,"facebook.com/catherine.j…Dear New York Hilton Midtown, This is not how you handle security and your clients. On September 10, 2017, around 11PM, I was resting in my room at the 1335 6th Ave location, waiting for extra blankets. I heard a knock on the door and ran to the door to receive my blankets. To my surprise, a homeless person was standing in front of the door. Something was definitely wrong. Panicking, I closed the door, but this person put a foot between the door and the frame, and he came inside the room. I was trying to call 911, but he grabbed me. So I ran outside to the corridor towards the info desk on the 37th floor, crying for help, as the stranger following me. NYPD arrived and I asked front desk duty personnel if they caught a guy. He said, oddly in a calming tone, ""Yes, they got a ""gentleman."" I didn't just run away from a ""gentleman"" who grabbed me and tried to barge into my room.I didn't call the police for a gentleman who had whatever crime in his mind.He was a mentally unstable homeless guy who was arrested. The security people told me that the Hilton hotel is a public place until 10PM, and for that matter, anyone can come inside the hotel until then. To my surprise, I didn't know that Hilton was such an open place for anyone and would negligently let any possible crimes to happen on their premises. Moreover, the incident happened well after 10PM. It was around 11PM.After reporting this incident, I requested a refund. Instead, I was simply offered a 4-day voucher. Due to the traumatic nature of this event and realizing how unsafe this Midtown location is, I have no desire to stay in any of Hilton's affiliated lodging spaces that do not have any reasons security assurances for their guests. A hotel is in the business of providing a safe living environment for people. Clients choose to stay in Hilton because we have a reasonable expectation of the safety Hilton's hotel room and areas will provide us after a long day in another city.All I heard from an in-person meeting with a hotel manager, Carlos, the day after was a bitter, cynical, condescending message: ""If you pretend to pursue legal measures, I can't offer you anything."" It was completely unexpected and I have never experienced this kind of rudeness in all my time at hotels. No proper apology was given for this unusual incident, and I have entirely lost my trust in the Hilton brand. This can be fixed simply with a refund and apology, which is all I wanted in to the first place. Not a voucher. Or, Hilton can continue to try to hide this incident under the rug, continue to treat their guests in this unacceptable manner, and ruin their reputation over time.#hilton #hotel #hiltonmidtown #hiltonnyc #hhonors #newyork #midtown #nyc #mostterrifyinghotelexperience",10,,

There is 2 restaurants herb n kitchen and bridges. The main full bar located on the first floor called lobby lounge. The minus5 ice bar is located in this hotel. After 11pm you will need a room key to enter the hotel. Located on 54th and ave of the Americas. The hotel is close to everything a tourist could want to experience. 4 blocks away from Central Park. 3 blocks away from radio city. 6 blocks away from Times Square and Bryant park. Rockefeller center is super close. Oh and it's close to 5th Ave some of the best shopping in the city. There are a lot of really good restaurants close by for brunch. Walk to the west and it will get touristy. If you want not touristy restaurants walk east. The halal brothers cart is across the street. They have been of foodnetwork for there food. I can walk down here from the upper east side no prob. But of coarse I don't because it gets touristy. The only exception is to meet friends. I ended up staying here 1 night. The hotel is super clean and modern. The views are nice. I would recommend staying here. The lobby is filled in the morning with people from class trips and groups of people. Overall the Hilton midtown is very nice. Just remember after 11pm you will need a room key to get past the main doors.,7,4,6

The room was on the small side, but for NYC that is expected. There was a little maintenance problem in the bathroom (handle on the door was broken), but after we let the management know about it, they fixed it quickly. The bed was very hard, though, and the pillows lumpy. I didn't sleep well there, which is why I'm only giving 4 stars. Also, they messed up the time of our wake-up call, and called a full 40 minutes too early - I let management know, and they were apologetic.We requested a high floor away from the elevators, to minimize noise, and they were able to accommodate us. If noise bothers you, be careful not to get a room adjacent to the elevators - there was even one room whose door was right in between two elevators. Not for me.Lots of other reviewers have complained about the elevators being slow, but I found them to be pretty quick. The problem is that the elevators are *small*, so only a few people can get into one at any given time. We came up for a show nearby, so the location of this Hilton was the biggest draw - it was conveniently located close to both the subway, the Ed Sullivan Theater, and good restaurants. Walking to Times Square was around 5-10 minutes, depending on how long your legs are. It was about a 10 minute taxi ride away from The Met, too, so if you're going to be Uptown, this is a convenient location.

In room toiletries were by Peter Thomas and the bed and linens were super comfortable.The central location means it's a short walk to Radio City Music Hall (4 blocks), Fifth Avenue shops (2 blocks), and excellent five star restaurants (1 block). The hotel itself has a business center on the second floor and a gym, so if you are working or want a work out you can do it in the hotel. Nice café and bar areas, and even though prices are NYC hotel, it's worth it for the quality if you don't want to venture outside.Beware the advertising calls from the hotel offering extra nights for $150; they are selling timeshares!",4,,

The Herb N Kitchen is overpriced and all the restaurants and bars are way over priced! I'd rather go to a dive bar or a stock up at a liquor store, than pay $18/cocktail or $7.50 for water. The housekeeping staff is absolutely amazing, but I cannot understand how such a popular Hilton property can be so hit and miss. Although Ingrid at the Hilton Honors Check-in was fantastic, the WiFi is exceptionally spotty, and don't be surprised that your premium floor/street view room means you'll have trucks honking their horns in the middle of the night. One of the USB charging ports in the work station was busted, and we had to call housekeeping to get an electric hot water kettle, but they only gave us two cups for three people.

You're close to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Plaza, NBC Studios, Central Park, and St. Patrick's Cathedral!If you're here for business, it's fine too.My hotel room was good. Everything was mostly clean, and housekeeping obeyed the Do Not Disturb hanger. The only problems were the crowds (there were two conferences in the hotel when I visited), and the slow elevators. I was on the 34th floor, and one of the elevators was broken all week. This caused super long waits for the elevator - easily 5+ minutes.I was here on business, and I requested away from the elevators because I'm a light sleeper (and I currently live in a small, quiet city). My assigned room was directly next to the elevator. I'm guessing they didn't read my request, or the rooms were all booked up. Fortunately, the elevators weren't that noisy.At the lobby level, you'll find the hotel bar, the Herb N'Kitchen, and the Minus5 Ice Bar.

The staff was very kind and helpful. The lobby was clean and very nice. That's about all the positives I have for this place. As for my room, it left a lot to be desired. I was in #1526 and for $300+ per night, it should have been a lot nicer. The bathroom ceiling had paint peeling, one of the outlets near the door came OUT of it's socket. For the price I would have also liked to have a coffee pot in my room and a mini fridge. What hotel doesn't have those? Even some skanky Best Westerns I've stayed in had more amenities then this place. It was very ""bare bones.""  I doubt I'll come back here. NYC has lots of better places for the price.",1,,

Even after notifying security, the noise went on for several hours. When I complained to the front desk, they offered me a different room and guaranteed it would be ready at the time I needed it. When I went back to get a new room key, the new staff was completely unaware of the situation. I once again had to battle for change to secure a decent night's sleep.   The next morning after 20 minutes of trying to reach the front desk regarding my checkout time, I gave up. The operator said the reason no one was picking up on the front desk phone was because they were switching shifts. When I argued that someone should be answering the phones, the operator proceeded to become rude with me.  In addition, we received equally rude treatment from another staff member in the hotel when I was delivering lunch to my daughter. We sat in a couple of chairs on the second level only to be told that we were in allowed to stay in the area because it was reserved for different organization. Nothing was blocked off. There were no signs  other than the ones on a couple of tables. Those tables we avoided. We were just as invested in our program as that other group and their program. It was completely unacceptable. There is no value to being a Hilton honors member  when staying at this hotel. With the exception of the cleaning staff, the individuals in this hotel or rude and dismissive.",,,

There were a few other incidents that really surprised me.  The first one was the bar next to the elevators was not open on one of the nights and there were dirty glasses everywhere - again, not the level of service we are accustomed to with Hilton Hotels.

138,Nathaly V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",458,215,490,3.0,8/16/2015,"This review is strictly regarding a Gala Awards Ceremony in which I attended and critique dinner, service and drinks.We were seated in the Grand Ballroom, located on the 3rd floor, accommodating about 3,000 guests. As soon as you walk in you will notice two gigantic screens, left and right. When I looked up to see any fancy lighting fixtures or chandeliers, I found it to be outdated. As I looked down, the carpets needed an upgrade too. As for as the servers, they were pleasant, polite and quick to react with our requests. Now, I am not sure how much money was spent on our dinners but for such an important event, it was quite disappointing to have served an overcooked steak, a bland corn salad and skimpy-seasoned mashed potatoes. The "" strawberry shortcake mousse"" dessert was flooded with sugar. One bite and I already felt a cavity coming in. Limited wine options. Two whites and two reds. Here's my thinking. I bet Hilton makes enough money with the rooms and parking given it's prime location, that they may feel there is no need to be fancy with the food at Ballroom events. I guess I can respect that. If the food served was mediocre on a special event, then there is no way I will ever recommend a tourist to order food in ( assuming it's the same line of cooks and chefs).

It's also close to the MoMA and Radio City Music Hall (both within eyesight!) The staff is very friendly, check-in was fast, and housekeeping was on top of their game. The views of the city are great too. My only complaints are the price and that housekeeping was perhaps a bit TOO on their game. We were awakened by them multiple times as they tried to enter our room for cleaning around 8:00 - 8:30 AM on most days.

Updated review","I had a horrible experience here due to the utter lack of any semblance of customer service. When I went to check out, there was a problem with my bill (paid via my credit card instead of points). Not only were the front desk person and the front desk manager uninterested in resolving the issue, they did not care that I had a problem at all. More importantly, they were rude, condescending, and disrespectful about it. I left the hotel with my problem unresolved and in tears due to this abominable treatment. Never again will I stay at the New York Hilton Midtown. Never again will I stay at a Hilton.Update 4/10/2017: It has been over a month since I contacted the Hilton representative (twice). No response. It is obvious that Hilton's poor customer service extends beyond New York Hilton Midtown.",2,1,

Many of the rooms are in need of upgrade but they are comfortable. Wi Fi is only free in the lobby area. You must pay for it in your room.They have a fitness center which I found no use for and instead of a restaurant they have Herb and Kitchen which is a pricey grab and go.

The price will vary depending upon the dates chosen and if something is going on in the city.They do offer complimentary luggage storage only upon arrival if your room is not ready.

The last time, I came with my sister on vacation. This time, I was stopping just for the night, as part of a long drive from TX to MA. I also had plans (which fell through) to meet with a friend for dinner.This was my first time driving into Manhattan. I was surprised, evening during rush hour, it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd expected. I did, however, have some issues with valet parking. I initially drove into the taxi area but, an attendant directed me to drive around to the side of the hotel. Leaving my vehicle wasn't too much an ordeal. (Picking it up was a different story.)I walked back around the side of the hotel, through the main lobby, to the front desk to check-in. Easy enough.My room was on a lower middle floor with unremarkable views and no wifi, which I haven't experienced with Hilton very often (at the time, anyway), though I'd forgotten this from my prior stay. It was a minor annoyance, however. (I love that this is no longer a thing for all HHonors members!)The greatest benefit to this hotel is its location - in walking distance to so much great food and the famous Broadway - both of which I enjoyed (again) after my friend's cancellation.On the morning of my departure, I got some food from the cafe shop. Then I went to the lounge to get a sit-down coffee while waiting for my car. I thought I was going to be greeted and asked to order, but, instead, he informed me that I wasn't allowed to have any outside food or drink.  I didn't even bother to correct him, as I'm happy to take my business elsewhere.Instead of waiting inside for my car, I went outside. There's no actual ""waiting area,"" just a group of people, lined along a covered curb. The wait time was near 40 minutes, which seems unreasonable by Manhattan standards.

Noooooo... that's NOT a high floor.  She argued a bit, I stood my ground.  So she gives a big sigh, snaps at me, then comes back and says she'll give us the 18th floor.  Still not great, but we agree to give it a try. The 18th floor room:  What a dump!  Ok, this room really just sucked in so many ways.  The beds were soooooo old.  You know how a really worn out bed just sags when you sit on it?  Yeah, it was like that.  Squeaky and saggy.  Killed my back.  Then there's the bathroom.  Old.  The tub was all chipped and cracked.  Nasty.  And don't kid yourself... 18 floors is not high enough to avoid the noise of the street.  Super loud.  We had the worst night sleep.So the next day, I went back to the desk and said no to the room we were in... we needed to move up higher.  I also asked if they had rooms with better beds.  Boy am I glad I asked that question! Turns out they have been renovating rooms.  The nicer fixed up rooms cost more, so he said they could give us something better if we paid the upgrade charge.  Fine, it sucks, but get me out of this awful room.  He moved us to the 34th floor, to a room that had been very recently upgraded.34th floor room:  omg, what a difference!!! just walking in, the room had a ""new"" smell.  translation... it smelled clean and of new carpet.  the carpet was nice, and very clean.  the beds were super comfortable.  great support, but not hard.  perfect.  the rooms are actually a good size, especially for New York.  We had a room with 2 beds, and there was still plenty of space to have suitcases out and not feel cramped.  we spent 4 nights in this room, and enjoyed our stay so much more.  wish they hadn't charged extra for it... that bit sucked.checkout:  they have key drop for easy checkout.  the not easy part of easy checkout... then you don't get an invoice of charges for the stay.  they don't email one.location:  awesome! 2 blocks to rockafeller center and subway, only about 5 blocks to times square or central park.  loved the location!Overall:  upgrade.  it's completely worth it to be comfortable.",4,1,2

This is probably the most frustrating and least-accommodating Hilton I have stayed at (I've logged 50+ nights at this particular one too). The only reason I keep coming back is that they do give a good amount of HHonors points, but with my most recent experience, I probably will not go back.  The hotel is loud, crowded, and the lines at the front desk are always long. I have never  had a room upgrade all the times I have stayed here. This is a huge conference hotel, so you have to wait 2-3 cycles just to get on the elevators and they virtually stop on almost every floor. I feel really bad for the staff, because they clearly are overworked and underpaid and are doing they're best not to be rude. For this last particular stay, the hotel was hosting the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA). This group was HORRIBLE on so many levels. Because of the conference, I couldn't get an early check-in, couldn't get a late check-out, and got stuck on a low-level floor. When I checked in, they accidentally put me in the wrong room (an error which was realized after my room keys stopped working and I had unpacked), and when I needed to move my stuff from the incorrect room to the correct room, the front desk refused until I spoke to a manager because they must of thought I was a hobo or a creeper or something, I don't know. Even though this hotel is at a great location, it's honestly not worth it if you're traveling for a business trip. Better suited to stay at the Marriott on Lexington or the Hilton Garden Inn near Times Square than at this place.EDIT: Also, this place CHARGES YOU to hold your bag. They can't charge it to the room and do not accept credit/debit cards, because it is a private company. Hilton has privatized their baggage storage services .... I didn't even know that was a thing.

Unfortunately, I can't recommend this hotel from a safety standpoint. There is an unsecured four feet drop beneath the stage in the ballroom that has been cleverly disguised with a ""wall"" of fabric but there is no warning to let guests know it's there. I believe this is a breach of Hilton's duty to its guests to take reasonable care to warn guests about hazards - and I know it's a situation they are aware of, because the wait staff told me (as I waited for someone to help fish my smashed laptop out of the void) that they've had both a toddler and an elderly guest fall into that void before (as I said, it looks like a solid wall but it's just a curtain, and NO WARNINGS posted anywhere).Security were very nice and told me not to worry, I could file a claim for reimbursement. The charming people at the claim facility - who are clearly told to put the burden on guests to get an attorney and never to agree to any payouts - told me today (to paraphrase) that I'm an idiot for thinking Hilton should have to take any precautions to warn guests about these sorts of hazards.It's not worth the cost to take this further - as I'm sure their claims department are aware! - but at least I can post a warning here to people about the lack of care taken at this facility to look after guests' safety.",5,,

The room has a ton of outlets for all your needs and we never had to stand in line to check in or out.  The location is very touristy close to Magnolia Bakery, Rockefeller Center, Time Square and Central Park.  One star off because this hotel is pretty pricey and everything inside of it is pricey as well.  A banana is $2, a coffee and yogurt is $12 and a bottle of water is $3.  Note that their food is very good and they use Illy coffee.",1,,2

I reserved a specific room using their hilton honors site, and I didn't get that room. Then when I  arrived, the beddings smelled like dirty water. Housekeeping did promptly replace the beddings the next day, but they shouldn't smell that way in the first place. Lastly, after taking a shower one evening, one of the bars from the shower rack almost fell on top of me (the rack sits above a person in the shower). When I complained about the bar almost falling on top of me, the front desk simply asked if I wanted it fixed -- I honestly didn't care if they fix it. It shouldn't have happened. My experience was certainly not one I would expect from the Hilton.",1,,

Like seriously rude!  I asked for his employee number to make a formal complaint and he wouldn't give it, claiming he was the only John that worked there. I was then assured that both booking had been cancelled, but I found out two days later that they had not been.Called for ANOTHER HOUR, and passed around from department to department before I could actually get confirmation that the bookings had been cancelled.

175,Marie S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,0,1.0,5/6/2018,"I stayed at this Hilton May5-6. The room was fine. However, the customer service was terrible, in particular a manager named Alyssa. I became very ill in the middle of the night and needed some tea.  ( I had recently completed a  chemo therapy series). Unfortunately, there is no way to get a cup of tea in the middle of the night, as, according to Alyssa, ""this type of amenity is not available at this property."" So, I asked her, how she might address this problem. She said that house keeping could send up a kettle, however, they did not have cups or teabags!  Now, keep in mind there is a market in the lobby, where one can purchase tea, but is closed at 11:00. Also, at this Hilton, there is a Club Hilton on the upper floors, which has a coffee maker in every room. Bottom line, Alyssa could not solve a simple problem. Alyssa, the answer is 1. Have several coffee makers available for this type is ""emergency"" 2.  Borrow coffee maker from Club Hilton, 3. Instruct housekeeping to open the market and get a cup and tea bag. Bottom line, this particular Hilton and the manager Alyssa really don't care about the customer. So, if you are with a big convention and get a good price this Hilton would be ok, BUT IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL GUEST, STAY AWAY AND SPEND YOUR $459/NIGHT ELSEWHERE WHERE THEY APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS.

179,Liz G.,"Washington, DC",140,360,96,4.0,1/22/2015,"Sightly surprised at some of the reviews, but whatever. I can only comment on my experience. Look, I am not the biggest fan of NYC in general. It's crowded, dirty and generally overwhelming. This is magnified intensely in Midtown and the Times Square area. Unfortunately, this is also where my client happens to be located, so while the NY Hilton was super convenient, it also put me square in the middle of my least favorite part of town.The hotel is enormous. Like, honestly maybe the biggest non-resort hotel I've ever been in. There were always a TON of people coming and going, people in black tie, people in tourist sneakers, so many people. The check-in process was really smooth. There were a couple of people ahead of me, but I'm in the HHonors program, so I walked right up to the special check-in and they took care of me. They gave me an upgrade, though I'm not sure how the room I ended up in was really any different from any other standard hotel room (two double beds, desk, dresser, bathroom, etc.). The room was clean and comfortable, with high-end products in the bathroom. Lots of fun for my boyfriend who loves hotel products. A couple of downsides, mostly pertaining to the location of the hotel and the fact that everything is more expensive in NYC. Internet was $14, despite my HHonors membership, and bag check was $3.50 per bag (worthwhile, as opposed to lugging my suitcase to meetings after I'd checked out). Having express elevators to my floor was a plus, though they did break down at one point, or were stopped because of some alarm in the building. (There was a weird message on the PA one night, indicating this.)We got a really good deal through Priceline on the hotel, otherwise I'm not sure we would have stayed here (in addition to the proximity to our client).",2,,

Finally moved me into another room on the last night. Room was a serious downgrade and obviously hadn't been cleaned. Even found perscription bottles under my bed. To this day they have yet to honor even giving me points for the inconveniences after promising they would at check out. They show face when called out on Twitter like they care and say message privately or email them. Then they don't respond. I've recommended my employers and associations not use them in the future as this is no way to treat a guest working inside your hotel for a very loyal client. I had stayed here in the past and didn't have issues. But this was unacceptable.",,,

We could have taken the stairs, but we were on the 23rd floor. It always took much longer than expected just to leave the hotel. The room was larger than I expected and contained two double beds. But there was wear and tear on the walls, ceiling, and door frames, and I would have expected that to be fixed between guests. When we checked in, the bathroom also had a wet dog smell and because of the lack of ventilation, we couldn't seem to get rid of it.We checked our luggage because we got in earlier than the check-in time of 3:00 PM, and they brought our luggage up to our rooms for us. They also delivered complimentary slippers when we called the front desk.We were woken up at 3:30 AM by a party going on next door; the neighboring guests were talking in voices louder than normal, but the wall between us barely muffled any of the noise. On the plus side, the front desk was very responsive to our call about the noise and a couple minutes later, we heard the phone in their room ring.We were getting a discount for attending a 2-hour time share presentation, which is why we chose this hotel. There was a mix-up with the scheduling where we were told that we were switched to a different time, and then when my mom checked, it turned out that time didn't exist on the presentation schedule. We had to change around our plans, but it ended up working out okay.Other comparable hotels offer a minifridge, such as the Hyatt Place in Midtown South.

Cons - I was visiting for a conference which took up approximately 3000 rooms in the hotel, as well as conference room space, and I was still charged $25 for an early check in fee. Really, Hilton? Hosting a conference in your space is not enough for attendees to have that charge removed? Smh.

Wonderfully comfortable bed with tons of pillows like I like it.Limited room service did not sit well with me but I really loved the Herb 'N Kitchen variety. Their burger and fries are really yummy. The fries alone are a gourmet treat sprinkled with rosemary and other spices. Bag check should be for hotel guests only but they seem to let any and everybody do it.

They called at 645 and I probably just turned off the phone, they were not able to get the 7AM call thru, so a staff member knocked on the door to help ensure I was awake - a plus.
