1,Allie B.,"New York, NY",303,224,205,4.0,7/18/2018,I tried a sandwich here on a baguette on a Friday afternoon. The sandwich was so good ! But also so large I had to save half of it for the next day. I love how they have artichokes which are really hard to find at other sandwich shops and they let you make your own sandwiches. I would like to try the ciabatta next time because most people were ordering their sandwiches on that.,1,,1

6,Anna L.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",39,208,261,5.0,2/17/2017,"Tiny little cafe which sells sandwichs, salads and other prepared foods. It gets really busy during lunch time. After placing your order you stand aside or in the back to let other people pass and wait until they call your name with your order. Sometimes it can take awhile. Other times it can be quick if they already had some premade and ready to go. I love the sandwiches here especially the chicken and avocado, but they are all good.",,,

I complained about my undrinkable almond late. They made me another one which I highly appreciated. However the efforts. The coffee tasted as bad as the first one. So I suggest you to go somewhere else to have a tasty beverage. The food however is very tasty and well seasoned ass well is the price. I really suggest their bread which is delici,,1,
9,Roseann W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,0,3.0,7/13/2017,"I'm a semi-regular customer at Bonsignour's and enjoy the prepared foods. Their chicken milanese is always excellent and there's never any of the gristle I find in chicken purchased elsewhere. I also like that they have a large variety of tasty vegetarian dishes. My only complaint is about how the employees regularly close up the store early. Last Sunday, I arrived at 7:30 pm to pick up some dinner, only to find 2 employees sitting outside who told me that business had been slow so they closed up half an hour early. On Monday-Saturday, they are supposed to be open until 9:30 pm, but I've arrived (on about 6 different occasions) by 9 pm to find the place locked up (not sure how early since no one was around). My suggestion: change the store hours to close at an earlier time; that way, customers won't be disappointed or confused about what your hours are.",,,
10,Aruna A.,"Rahway, NJ",94,537,12,5.0,5/21/2015,"I visit this little French gem frequently and it is AMAZING.  Great soups, great sandwiches, and great bread rolls / croissants.  Their salad deals are a great value - and all of the above is a satisfying lunch or breakfast. The BEST though is without a doubt their cookies. The hamantaschen, the little linzer cookies, and ruggelach all truly melt in your mouth. And when you want a tiny sweet treat, they are perfect. Everything I've ever had tastes super fresh & even when there is a long line, I usually am in and out sort of fast. I recommend visiting here for a great little casual meal. Don't expect to sit down though, just a few small tables in an already small space. Best bet is to grab food & go over to 9th ave, the Highline, or the little squares around this cafe.",1,,
11,ANdy S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/1/2017,"Food is good but run away from the store when the blond woman is behind the counter (in the evening) and could not care less about what you order, won't remember to offer you bread with your salads - just rude.",,,
12,M B.,"New York, NY",6,63,3,2.0,8/4/2017,"Not open until 10p as yelp says, or 930p as Google says. In fact I was told by the fairly rude person behind the counter that this place closes early most days. She gave me attitude because I wanted to sit for 5 minutes at 8:40p while I scarf my food down. The foul customer service wasn't necessary. And food was only ok. Won't be back.",,,
13,Eva R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,50,3,5.0,3/18/2016,"The cubano sandwich was EXCELLENT. Cute little place, the prices I felt like were not too bad considering the location.

Me entienden?",,,
14,Patrice D.,"New York, NY",0,21,0,4.0,9/21/2015,"So difficult to reviewPros: best coffee in Manhattan, possibly some of the best coffee i've had in the world, including Latin America and Europe. Their food is delicious and their catering is reliable and fun and always disappears rapidly at parties.Cons: The employees. The employees are (mostly) awful. No other words for them. Some of the longtimers are great (one guy is horrible and has been for over 10 years) but the revolving doors of annoying youngsters that dance around and chat and gossip behind the counter when you simply want your coffee is ridiculous. It was much more reliable when owned by the previous guy.",1,,

19,Simon S.,"Jersey, Jersey",0,17,23,5.0,8/14/2015,I love this place. Don't let the appearance of a tiny seating area fool you. We always grab our food to go and sit on the benches outside in the sun. The choice of sandwiches and breads are amazing. Have been here many times and always have great food.,,,
20,Gabriela G.,"Atlanta, GA",1246,893,1690,3.0,3/10/2012,"It's ok, but not raving awesomeness! I came in for a snack and got to sample the broccoli and cauliflower in sesame dressing and it had a good crunch though a bit oily on the tongue. Beet and arugula salad was also ok, but had a bit too much mayo. Came back later in the day for a cup of soup and guy behind the counter recommended the veggie puree soup. It was healthy, but completely bland and flavorless. Only good thing about it was the free roll you get to accompany your cup. You get a choice of roll. I picked the 7 grain, it was a bit chewy (meaning not totally fresh), but it did have a nice sweetness to it that i enjoyed.Severs were busy and on a roll trying to get orders out and make sandwiches and drinks for people, so they were not too friendly; but they weren't rude either.I was able to grab a table to sit and it was nice to relax by the window, looking out into the cold bustling city from a safe warm space where i could disconnect from the rush and breathe as i slowly sipped on my hot soup, blowing steam from each spoonful.Would i come back here again? Yes, if i find myself in this part of town, i would give this place another chance. there were many many options to chose from and maybe i didn't chose the best ones, but a lot of them looked very appealing and i was left wanting to try some of their other soups and colorful salads in the glass display.",4,1,2
21,e e.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,5.0,1/30/2017,"Fantastic little deli... very consistant and definite go-to for breakfast, lunch or latte.  Staff very friendly.  Space is tight so more of a take away place.  We go back again and again:)",,,

23,Greg B.,"New York, NY",90,120,15,3.0,7/11/2014,"We were here a while back and I think the sandwiches were OK, that was the draw... read about real good sandwiches. The thing that stuck though, and this was annoying. I paid for the sammies and the guy didn't give me change as if I was going to leave a fat tip for take-out sandwiches. I had to like wait for him to stop ignoring me so I could flag him down and ask for my change which was like 4 or 5 bucks back from a 20. Sorry dude, tips are for people to leave, not for you to just take.",1,1,
24,Julie N.,"Noord, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",18,27,0,4.0,9/30/2013,"Being a huge fan of french food, I was really excited to stumble upon this quaint little spot near my new office. To be honest, it's a little tricky at lunch time - a very small venue with not a lot of room to wait indoors (and an inward-swinging door. Wah!) However, the food is really delicious. I constantly order the 2-salad option, which is plenty of food, and their salads are awesome. I highly recommend the couscous salad (tomatoes, feta, green onions, so great), with either their avocado/tomato salad or the potato salad. Everything looks amazing in there, though, and decently priced for the quality. Their sandwiches are also fantastic. I am a fan of the turkey sandwich with avocado and herb mayo. Try it! Go! But order, or go early or after the rush. :)",3,,
25,Walter B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,38,3,5.0,12/28/2016,"Breakfast pastries are top notch as is their ruggalah when they have it. Their sandwiches on chiabatta are the best. Love the Turkey with brie and also with Swiss, tomato and cranberry. The roast beef is fabulous as is the curried chicken. The staff is friendly enough and efficient. I am happy I discovered this place as I now get breakfast or lunch there at least 3-4 times a week.",,,

Updated review","Great simple food! Best for breakfast or lunch, for a simple one! Only issue I have is that they can take forever with their orders, so order simple/prepared food if you're in a hurry. Otherwise, expect to wait a little bit for your food. They have good food, so it's worth the wait in my humble opinion. Good bagels + Eggs for breakfast, and a very decent cup of coffee.",,,
29,Lars F.,"Setagaya, Japan",48,523,725,4.0,4/8/2013,"Stopped by here for lunch today. Crowded inside, but not too long of a wait. Only three tiny tables next to the counter, so everyone in line is basically standing next to you. The two benches that seat three in front of the shop are better for people-watching anyway. We ordered the Cuban panini which was pretty tasty. More pickles would have been better. The coffee was only warm, not hot, so not happy. A huge selection of sandwiches and so nice looking soups.",2,,1
30,Paul D.,"Wellington, New Zealand",79,316,15,4.0,3/9/2013,"Always love a rustic, worn in cafe, where the aroma of coffee and the sight of cake awakens your senses. The coffee was just great .",2,,2

32,Rosetta S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,127,0,4.0,7/12/2015,"All I had here is the iced coffee and I like it a lot. It's not bitter or sour, like much of the coffee around town these days. Not sure why people are complaining about the service, as I find the staff pretty friendly at 8am!",,,
33,Evan G.,"San Francisco, CA",222,730,362,4.0,8/18/2013,"This is a small-scale neighborhood deli.  Fellow West Villagers can compare this to ""Ready to Eat"" on Hudson, just a few blocks south.  But Bonsignour is the better of the two, and better priced, in my opinion.I go here mostly for their prepared foods, but they also do made-to-order egg (and regular) sandwiches, salads, and other tasty items.  I'm a big fan of their curry chicken salad and their beet salad (even though it has corn in it, and corn is EVIL).  They also do a really tasty prepared salmon. Their pastries are also rather popular with regulars - which makes this a good stop for a croissant on Saturday or Sunday morning. And the chai is pretty good, too (I'm not much of a coffee guy).Single salads run $4.95 for a small and $5.95 for a large;  or you can get three together for $11.95 or $12.50 (I forget which it is).  The ""trio"" is a good grab and go for lunch - and if you added some bread and a beverage, and easy-to-share picnic lunch by the Hudson for two (because who picnics on the East River, really? Ha ha.)",,,
34,M E.,"Seattle, WA",17,87,11,3.0,9/2/2013,"This is a popular neighborhood spot, you'll always see locals with their kids getting sandwiches.The sandwiches are pretty good, not mind blowing. I got an avocado and Swiss sandwich, it was a bit burned. It was decent though.Unfortunately, it takes forever to get a sandwich. After I ordered it took 15 minutes for my rather simple sandwich and there was no one ahead of me. So if you go, just be prepared to wait.I prefer Snice a block over.",,,
35,Marina K.,"New York, NY",351,313,68,4.0,5/30/2012,"Yummy place to grab a quick, hearty salad on the go - if I still lived in the area I could definitely see myself regularly grabbing a quick bite to take home after a long work day. It's mostly a to-go place but they have a few tables inside, as well. In addition to pre-made salads and baked goods, they have a full menu of made-to-order sandwiches, etc. I tried a bowtie pasta salad with feta, tomatoes  and greens (kale?) and really enjoyed it. Their chicken and apple curry salad also looked delish.Minus one point for lackluster service, but maybe it was an off day. If I'm in the hood and looking for a snack, I'll be sure to stop by!",1,1,1
36,Stephanie K R.,"New York, NY",53,23,1,4.0,8/9/2011,"Bonsignour is the cute little sandwich shop that you want to live by in any city. It's good, quick and always reliable (not to mention it's mere walking distance from my bf's apt! SCORE!)The food is always good and so is the coffee. So far I've had the breakfast sandwiches, their salads and a panini or two. The breakfast sandwiches do not disappoint, especially if you're looking for something filling to soak up the booze you drank from the night before. Ham and swiss with eggs on a croissant? Yes please, don't mind if I do! I LOVE the create your own salad option because I'm pretty picky about what I want on my salads from day to day... I mean who doesn't like to be able to create a salad that is specially made for them?! :) Their homemade balsamic dressing is a bit mustardy though, so for those who HATE mustard, you might want to choose something else. Their paninis are delicious too and they have a huge menu of other salads and sandwiches. I have yet to try their salad bar but that is next on my list!One of my fave parts of this place is the benches outside. You know this place is good when you see locals hanging out on the benches chatting. This place has the quintessential neighborhood feel that is signature of the Village. Another plus is the dog bowls filled with water they leave outside, I mean even my pup Oliver is a fan of this place! In sum, if you're ever in the area, you have to check this place out!",2,,1
37,emily l.,"Manhattan, NY",8,19,4,3.0,10/16/2011,"This sandwich shop is definitely reliable for certain sandwiches, I'm sure, since the one I had (number 18)  was excellent, but my companion's sandwich was dry and overall unsatisfying. However, we did not try the coffee or the various salads (both which seemed to be the most popular things for other customers), so my rating would probably be higher! The atmosphere was nice and homey, and the music selection was excellent (I enjoy listening to the Beach Boys in the 21st century). I'd like to return to try the other food, but I'm not yet in love.",1,,3
38,Candace Q.,"Manhattan, NY",49,26,1,5.0,6/5/2013,Danilo is terrific! I've used his company for several events and he never fails to deliver high quality food and excellent customer service.  He is the one of the only caterer's in NY that I've worked with that doesn't try to gouge his customers with outrageous pricing!

I ordered a turkey sandwich with avocado on ciabatta and added havarti cheese. It was absolutely delicious, as was the iced coffee.

(hey, a girl can dream)This small cafe with a display case of pre-made yummie looking food is a gem.  Nice music, nice artwork, benches out front, cute smiling staff.  GREAT steamed hot coco.  Small, but tasty beef empanada in a lovely flaky crust.  $6.00 was a little pricey for cheap old me but for the West Village, well worth it.

It's nice and cozy in there, and the prices are pretty decent for what you get.I had some spinach and feta thing that was amazing, and a turkey/brie/honey mustard situation on a baguette that was incredible.

Food quality is great, service is simple but friendly, spot is charming and in a quiet corner of the West Village. You can't go wrong here. Stop in for a quick lunch or simple dinner.

Freshly made. With honey mustard. It's like Thanksgiving dinner in your hands. The bread alone is worth trying out -- hefty, with a chewy crust. For dessert, I got an oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips -- a rare treat.

The cheese options are a nice change from the norm.I was impressed by how friendly the staff was and how simple the prepared salads where. Nothing was covered in ranch or mayo, which is a big change.I am not a huge dog person, and with that being said, I was a bit taken back by how many dogs were in the restaurant. It is a dog friendly spot but it is also tiny so there really is no where to go when a dog starts licking you leg. You pretty much just have to stand there and pretend you are ok with it. Good thing the lady gave me a free cookie (for being such a good sport) or I am sure this would be a three star review. Anywho, check it out!",2,1,
59,Jordan C.,"New York, NY",2,15,0,5.0,4/18/2007,"Have you ever had a craving for chicken fingers?  Well I do.  Often.  And I must admit that I'm a little reluctant to yelp about these tasty delights available at Bonsignour (what is that, French?).  I'm afraid there will be a run on the 'fingers, similar to what has sadly happened at Magnolia Bakery when everyone learned about their cupcakes.  For you S.A.T. whizzes (yes, that's the plural form):Magnolia : Cupcakes :: Bonsignour : Chicken FingersFor years, I have tried to figure out the algorithm by which they serve these little buggers -- b/c they are not available everyday.  No sir.  Well I JUST found out.  It's Wednesdays and Saturdays (and some Thursdays).  There.  The cat is out of the bag.  Oh, and when they ask if you want the dipping sauce.  Say, ""You betcha!""  But leave some for me, please.This gourmet joint, tucked away on Jane Street, serves soups, sandwiches, a variety of salads, specialty dishes, deserts & more.  Try a turkey & cheese on black bread, or a quarter piece of chicken with beet salad & a raisin walnut roll.  Meatloaf, stuffed chicken, salmon -- it's all good.  You must try their timbales (mushroom or cheese).  Delish.  Many of their goods are on display in their glass counter.  So go and gawk away.You can eat in at their 3 small wooden tables, or take away.  And try the chicken fingers (did I say that already?).  I'm eating them as I type...",2,,1

61,Alexis S.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,3.0,1/21/2011,"The food here is consistent but so is the poor customer service.  Bonsignour is close to my office so I order from here daily, they have slow delivery times (for less than a block away) and when I go for take out, it always takes at least 15 minutes to get out of there and all of the food is premade!  This place could be really great if they improved upon their customer service.",1,1,
62,Matt A.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,217,16,4.0,11/8/2010,"I really love finding tiny little sandwich shops where you can quickly pop in for a sandwich, salad, glass of freshly squeezed juice or whatever suits your fancy and either squeeze into a seat (if you're lucky enough to find one) or sit outside on a bench and people watch.  This is one of those places.  I find the ambience more memorable than anything I've eaten here, but that's not to say the food isn't good either.   Staff members are quick and attentive, juices are very good and fresh and I don't ever feel rushed out despite the limited seating.  If I'm in the area, I would definitely consider stopping in and recommend it to others.",,,1
63,Dennis-Phyllis B.,"New York, NY",0,25,0,4.0,10/17/2013,"Bonsignour is an adorable little place and their food is scrumptious! Denny and I love their fried chicken fingers---crispy and delish (so unhealthy but we're totally addicted---you only live once! :)  Now if you get a yen for the fingers, keep in mind that they're only available on certain days (Wednesdays & Saturdays I think) and you got to get them while their hot, cause they sell out. Sometimes we get their three salad combo and we go for the chicken salad, couscous and feta salad, and avocado-tomato salad----it's great but a bit pricey at $13.95. Their beet salad is very good too but Den wouldn't touch beets if his life depended on it, so I don't get it often since we like to share. Overall, Bonsignour's food is very fresh and well put together. People often sit and eat there but Den and I see it more as a take out place, since the 3-4 tiny tables are not particularly inviting. Also, in the summer, don't miss their strawberry lemonade---it's wonderful, tart and refreshing (and not too sweet).",,,

They have this pasta salad with mozzarella and olives, basil and tomatoes -- it's very simple, but when you have fresh ingredients, you don't need anything extra.Super nice staff!! And always adorable dogs sitting outside :)",,,1
66,Jackie Y.,"New York, NY",92,205,8,4.0,9/17/2008,"A couple of friends recommended this place to me, claimed the meatloaf sandwich was out of this world.  So of course I had to see what all the fuss was about...especially since I would say that I'm a LOVER OF HEAVY FOODS.I was NOT disappointed!Meatloaf & Swiss with Tomato Sauce (on Ciabatta): ask for a little extra tomato sauce (it softens the bread so that it's easier to bite into) and you won't be disappointed.  It can get a little messy, so be sure to have napkins on-hand.  The sandwich is pretty large and in charge, so I'd recommend sharing this w/ another person and getting a side of some veggies or any of their cold sides to avoid overeating.Average to I'll pass on:Broccoli, Carrot, Green Beans marinated in sesame oil (?) w/ sesame seeds: little too much sesame oil, but made me feel ""healthier"" for eating a side of veggies as opposed to another half of the meatloaf sandwich which, by the way, was so good that my friend's 16 month old baby kept tapping her mom for bite after bite while the sandwich was in her mom's mouth!Don't get:Quiche-like muffin w/ spinach, mushrooms, and gruyere: their offer to ""heat"" it (in the microwave) made me think it had potential.  but not even the baby would eat it.  I left the scraps on the table and walked it over to the garbage.I'll stick w/ my meatloaf sandwich but would be willing to try out a pastry, coffee, or salad next time as well!Tip:The place is absolutely tiny and it can get crowded, but in general it's not too hard to get a table inside or a seat on the bench outside, as long as you don't have a lot of people with you.  You can even walk over to the park a couple blocks away and have a seat on a bench.",,,

Updated review","Keeping in mind that this is premade takeout food, i would say this place is pretty amazing.    Bonsignor fulfills a variety of cravings with incredibly high quality ingredients.   Whether you want to gorge yourself on comfort food or take a quick coffee break with a pastry, this is the place to stop.   The coffee is good (and i dont say coffee is good unless it really is good)  the sandwiches are delish, the curry chicken salad is a favorite.  The deserts are out of this world.  In a cityfull of chains like Au...  and Pret...  its easy to forget how authentic versions of those products are really supposed to taste.   Bonsignor toils to make this stuff right and you get to just walk in whenever you feel like it and indulge.",2,,
68,Mike B.,"New York, NY",15,401,19,4.0,8/14/2010,"Nothing spectacular here, but everything's decent and it really fits with the rhythm of the neighborhood.  Coffee's fine, muffins are fine, croissants are fine, bagels are fine, breakfast egg sandwiches on focaccia are really great as are some of the cold salads featured at lunch.  Some people swear by their timbales (I've never had one.)  I'm not thrilled by their dinner entrees but their meatloaf is OK and sometimes they have a rolled chicken breast which is really good.  Oatmeal is good in the morning and not expensive.  Soups are too watery.  Not super-cheap, not super-expensive.  It serves its niche well and the benches outside encourage socializing (sometimes it seems more among dogs than people,) but it's a nice touch.",,,
69,Diana S.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,39,0,1.0,4/1/2009,"I used to include Bonsignour in my lunchtime rotation only for the yummy chicken and sundried tomato salad (which isn't available every day) which was overpriced but delicious.  Everything else I found kind of meh and waaay overpriced.But I'm a little biased because I'm now boycotting.When I sat down to eat lunch with some colleagues the heater BURNED A HOLE THOUGH MY COAT.  When I told the manager, she said they would reimburse me for half of the repairs (I late found out the coat can't be repaired). When I politely told the manager they should turn the heater down she said, ""You're the first person who's ever had a problem. We don't even have to give you anything."" ummm, customer service?",2,,1

71,J K.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,5.0,11/30/2012,"This is absolutely one of my favorite places in the Village and am glad that it remains a wee bit under the radar.  I've tasted just about all of the good ones and think this place has the best coffee in the City.  Yup.  It's that good.  At least the best ice, and I'll give Grumpy the best hot coffee.  I have no idea how they do it, and how it is never, ever on any of the best coffee in the city lists.  Just about everything on the menu is stellar, but there are a few misses, like the soups, breakfast sandwiches (except for turkey, havarti, and egg on a croissant).  But the lunch/dinner sandwiches are fantastic, esp. turkey/avocado, chicken salad's amazing, chicken w/ red bean mayo, meatloaf, etc., etc. (but not the panini).  And the random entrees and salad sides rarely disappoint.  The baby green salad often tastes like it just came out of the ground.  Great place to stop for a quick, healthy dinner too, and there's no one there in the evening.  Love it.  Bonsignour is truly one of my favorite things about living in the West Village.",2,,1

73,Frank D.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,44,0,1.0,4/8/2009,"This is a very cute place on a cute street. HOWEVER,  when I was there I ordered the spinach quiche and they offered to ""heat it"". They then handed me something that was the temperature equivalent to molten lava. They had heated this thing in the microwave. Obviously that changes the texture of what is supposed to be a subtle egg dish. The thing tasted terrible. My partner tried it and was aghast. I brought it to Cassandra, who had prepared it and told her that I didn't like it and asked if I could please have something else. She gave me the most strangely evil, disgusted stare and refused to say a word. I couldn't believe this was happening and I couldn't be bothered any further. So I said, ""Oh, never mind"", threw it in the trash and walked out. Customer service like this, and like I've read on other posts regarding this establishment is intolerable.",,1,
74,Andy G.,"Palm Springs, CA",14,66,0,3.0,6/6/2007,"I just had the most expensive average whole grain loaf bread sandwich in the world.  It sounds good... Turkey, avocado, fancyschmancy mayo, lettuce, tomato, whole grain slices... but it was ok at best.  Normally this is no problem; you get an ""ok"" sandwich and you move on. The thing that makes this yelpworthy is that I paid $9 for this sandwich.  When Subway makes a better sandwich than you, you really can't justify $9. West Village or not.  Coffee in the AM, however, is 5 Star.  I did see a movie star while there today though, so maybe that's what makes this place the shiz-nit.",1,,1
75,Sam F.,"New York, NY",28,125,1,3.0,1/26/2007,Bonsignour makes a mean tuna sandwich. There are red onions and capers mixed right in with the tuna plus lots of fresh veggies all piled on delicious bread.  This place is always very busy around lunch time. There is a tiny seating area inside and a bench outside which is always full in the summer.  It is a little expensive even for the area ($10+ for a sandwich and drink).,,,
