Yara was such a sweetheart and took great care of us.Owner, Christine surprised us with some special drinks and checked on us multiple times.I'm definitely coming back.",,,
1,Ricky T.,"New York, NY",230,152,31,5.0,10/16/2018,"Came here for dinner with a friend that lived nearby right before 10 pm. The service and the food were wonderful. We ordered the Thai Steak Salad and the Pork Belly. Both dishes delicious were bursting with flavor, and cooked perfectly. Prices are reasonable.I really have no complaints. The kitchen closes at 10 pm, so definitely try to come before 10. Highly recommended, and I will definitely come back. We spoke with the owner as we were leaving, and she was really sweet. You can tell she really cares about the restaurant and wants to make sure everyone has a good experience.",1,,
2,Rachel K.,"New York, NY",291,11,427,5.0,8/31/2018,"This is such a lovely restaurant run by truly great people. I just moved to the neighborhood a few months ago and have walked by this place many times. One day after work, I decided to just grab dinner and a glass of wine here. Not only was the food delicious, but the owner is amazing! She struck up a conversation with me, making sure I was satisfied with my meal and service. We ended up talking about her hopes for the restaurant and I have to say, she did an awesome job. Their mission is to create a comfortable environment, as if you're dining at home. The decor is so cute/trendy and attention to the little details give off a homey-quality that puts you at ease.Keep up the amazing work! I know I haven't visited in awhile (crazy new work schedule) but I'll be back soon to try your other dishes like I promised :)",,,
3,Areeba K.,"South Hadley, MA",281,5,1,5.0,11/11/2018,"Great, affordable food that's healthy and wholesome and tastes good! Quiet enough to be able to hear company. Recommend getting a bite here",,,
4,Rob M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,3,5.0,10/18/2018,I stopped by on the way to my friends event which was happening nearby. I was greeted by the owner who was very kind. I'm on a low carb diet so Christine suggested the Thai beef salad with mild spice. Yum! The subtle spices with Tamarind and well considered and prepared beef was truly superb. This place has lovely food and a kind owner. It's a cozy petite spot near the park.,,,
5,Levi G.,"Manhattan, NY",74,13,7,5.0,7/31/2018,I saw this place when he opened and haven't had the chance to stop and now is one of my favorites the owner is here hosting with a lot of care the food is fresh only eat inside no take out for now,,,
6,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5152,4.0,10/25/2017,"The definition of a small, mom 'n pop business. This is a sliver of a restaurant space in the lower part of Lower East Side. The front of house is seemingly run by one woman (Jia), and she features a modest number of Asian-inspired comfort food items on the menu. From salads to sandwiches and even meatloaf, there's a lot of variety packed into a small bill of fare.I went with the Thai beef salad, and it was a perfectly healthy meal at the right portion. Lots of flavor with the tamarind chili dressing, and the beef was seasoned with plenty of zing. Paired with a happy hour wine, and it was a lovely early dinner at a price that didn't break the bank. A true neighborhood joint, so if you're in the area, you should consider popping in and supporting a hyperlocal business.",8,1,7

Updated review","Its 94 degrees outside! Came in for brunch, had a cilantro/cucumber white wine cooler, amazingly cooling effect! Picture is worth a more than a thousand word! Perfect hang out place!",,,
8,Alex R.,"New York, NY",3,12,6,5.0,5/17/2018,"Lovely little International Comfort Food restaurant and wine/sake bar with a lovely host and relaxed vibe. The food brings inspirations from Thailand, China, American and more. A lot of healthy options. A great respite from the wild bars around it and a nice soulful, worldly establishment. Did I say they have sake?",,,
9,Ray L.,"New York, NY",151,3,1,5.0,3/21/2018,"This is a beautiful place helmed by a wonderful owner and her niece. With a mission to provide comfort food (NOT Asian fusion, a necessitated clarification) that is home cooked and accessible by people from a variety of cultural backgrounds.Each dish that we ordered (soy braised crispy pork belly, oxtail stew, Thai beef salad) were phenomenal. You absolutely must try the pork belly, which performs all the right amounts of crispness and tenderness. The Thai beef salad had its signature kick to its sauce while still remaining a light and popular option. And finally, the oxtail stew will presents the right balance between its potatoes and its meat.Like the food, the ambiance is carefully and lovingly crafted, with each element having been carefully selected and placed by hand. Whether you want to be sitting down at a table or have a friendly conversation with the staff while sitting at the counter, this is a house that welcomes you into its doors and treats you well. Christine will come around several times to make sure you are not only enjoying your food, but that you are home.",1,,1
10,Randy P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1,5.0,5/17/2018,"Jia, just as the name entails, after eating this plate of meatloaf and potato salad, it has left me as satisfied as a homecooked meal mom would feed me. Everything was just right.",,,
11,Nicholas Y.,"Edison, NJ",80,5,0,4.0,8/26/2018,"This was my first time visiting this little place and I can say that my experience here was great! I happened to pass by and decided to give it a try with my mom who was with me. Firstly, the atmosphere of the place matches the name of the restaurant. It truly feels like ""a home away from home"" with how cozy it felt. Secondly, the oxtail stew and teriyaki salmon we ordered were delicious! The oxtail was the most tender oxtail I have ever had and the teriyaki sauce on the salmon was light yet flavorful! I would definitely come back again if I were to pass by!",,,

Updated review",This restaurant is excellent. They have different varieties of food. The food is inexpensive but the food taste mind blowing. You will amazed and surprised on how delicious the food are. The restaurant is kept clean and the workers are very nice. The atmosphere of when you enter the restaurant makes you feel at home and relaxed. The menu contains unique food you will not find in other places. I recommend this to everyone who wants to experience good food.Update: They have now added a brunch menu. I tried their Eggs Benedict and It was amazing. I recommend it to anyone coming in for brunch.,,,1
13,Erinn S.,"Austin, TX",0,15,7,5.0,3/25/2018,"WOW. I didn't know what a gem I had found when I first came in! The menu seems all over the place-but it's because they have a selection of different comfort food dishes that someone might have at home, in all different cultures. (Jia means""Home""). The prices are low so I thought the quality would be just okay. Nooo- each dish I've had has been soooo phenomenal. Very fresh, very home style. Beautiful presentation. Blown away.",,,
14,Laney L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,28,5.0,7/14/2018,"Had a delicious dinner at Jia's last night with my family.  When we were told there was a small place nearby with comfort food, we were excited to try a new place and support new business in the area.  Owners and staff were super friendly and felt like every dish was special made for us.  The decor and music made the atmosphere very homey.  Everything exceeded our expectations.  We ordered the Thai beef salad, oxtail stew, roasted pork and salmon.  Everything was delicious!  You will not be disappointed.  The sides were actually my kids' favorite part of the dinner.  They loved the garlic butter fries and fried brussel sprouts.  Both were crispy and tasty.  Shirley/Christine - thanks for treating us like special guests!  We enjoyed every aspect of dinner!  Thanks for the special appetizers and yummy desserts you so kindly served us on the  house.  We will be sure to come back.",,,
15,Nick B.,"Queens, NY",0,1,0,4.0,4/24/2018,"Wow, what a wonderful place. The atmosphere, the employees, the music, the FOOD. Right food. Right portions. Not overly dressed or spiced. Fairly priced. The menu has something for everyone. They also have a quality beer and wine selection that includes sake. The mojitos are dangerous. Soo good. In the area, there isn't anything like it. You just can't find all of that in one place. Christine, the owner, truly cares about each and every one of her patrons and always ensures they have a great experience. Always friendly, always engaging. Shirley, the cook, is so knowledgable, passionate, and quirky, which is the best combination to make for some awesome food. JIA means home and that's definitely what it feels like. Good, home cooking from people who care.",1,1,1

17,Christopher P.,"Philadelphia, PA",273,2,0,5.0,5/5/2018,"Excellent food, excellent vibes! Jai is home and my soul was fed! I had the lemongrass chicken sandwich and that was phenomenal. The garlic butter fries were great as well. I'm thoroughly happy with my choice to randomly eat here!",,,1

Updated review","Tried again, this time as take out.  Found hair in my food.  :-(. Won't be coming back again.  I was trying to figure out how here are so many positive reviews for this place since I have clearly had such a bad experience with it.  That's when I noticed that most of the other 5 star reviews are from people who have only written 1 or 2 reviews--meaning they are likely friends of the proprietor and created yelp accounts for the purpose of propping up this place--so shouldn't be taken at face value as critical reviews.  Sigh.",5,,
24,Lulu W.,"Santa Monica, CA",14,22,0,5.0,11/9/2017,"I've only been to ""Jia"" twice and it already feels like home - everything from the food to the people. Everything I've had here is perfection. The only time I've had oxtail stew exactly like Jia's recipe is from my Mom! Real home cooking -  nothing artificial, all fresh ingredients, run by the nicest family. There's no better business to support in the city than ""Jia"".",,,
25,Alyssa C.,"Westerville, OH",176,4,8,5.0,6/1/2018,A friend and I came in at 11PM because it was quiet and the drinks were nicely priced. Christine is one of the nicest restaurant owners I've ever met. The ambiance is perfect and the comfort food looks so good. The mojito is to die for but it won't kill your wallet. Will definitely be coming back to try out the brunch menu.,,,
26,Ryan H.,"Windham, NY",23,2,0,5.0,10/29/2017,"The braised crispy pork belly was amazing. It was tender on the inside while being crispy on the inside. The salad that came with it (mint, cilantro, lime/lemon juice, and onion I think?) gave an nice kick with the pork belly and cuts down the fat of the pork. The sweet potato fries was well seasoned and crispy. Overall great food, nice atmosphere, friendly service. Would come back again to try the rest of the menu.",,,
27,Sabrina S.,"New York, NY",0,6,2,5.0,6/22/2018,"Such a great warm welcoming place , you could smell the aromas from the door .Staff so welcoming and friendly.

I ordered the oxtails with Jasmin rice they were amazing so tender and had such a home-cooked feel, my fav is the carrots in it they were fresh .i will be back!",,,
28,Noemi T.,"Chicago, IL",9,2,0,5.0,10/21/2017,"The food was lovely, super affordable and the staff is extremely friendly! We had the salmon teriyaki dish for the entree and the kale and edamame for appetizers.",,,

31,Matt D.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,0,5.0,4/20/2018,"I came here by myself when I was in a mood, and got exactly the delicious, affordable, mama's-cooking food I needed. If I was the only person who wasn't a regular in the place, the owner Christine immediately made me forget it. This is a real neighborhood spot with a home-away-from-home vibe. Also, the music is perfect. I've been tapping my toes, and Christine is singing along. I feel better already!",,,

33,Melinda L.,"Jericho, NY",0,7,6,5.0,8/5/2017,A new wine bar with tasty homemade food. Like the crab cake sliders and the beef salad. A well selected wine and beer collection. Nice vibe and a good addition to the neighborhood.,,,
34,Debi B.,"Hewlett, NY",0,2,0,4.0,2/17/2018,After a day at the tenement museum my husband and I came across this place.  It was quaint and cozy.  The menu was very interesting so we gave it a try.  What a wonderful surprise!  We ordered the crab cake slider and lemon grass chicken with the sweet potato fries and sautéed kale.  It was outstanding.  The food was made to order and the service was impeccable. The portions and the price were well worth it.  We will definitely come back for more.,,,
35,Joyce W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/3/2017,"Great staff and food is bomb! Really chill place to hangout with friends, grab a drink while you're at it! Definitely recommend the Pork Belly dish. Tip: Eat the belly with the salad!!",,,
36,Lloyd G.,"Liberty, NY",0,6,0,2.0,12/18/2017,"The selection of food here is so widely random, you can hardly pair an appetizer with an entree. The quality of food is average with above average prices. This restaurant is only opened for dinner, but the quality does not compare to other places that has lines forming to get a dinner seat. Not sure why some others have given five stars, this place is okay not terrible but definitely not five stars.",,,
37,Andrei V.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",0,2,0,5.0,9/14/2017,"Healthy food, made quickly, all at a pretty good price. The owner Christine is super friendly and fun to talk to. Recommend the Thai beef salad definitely",,,
38,Esther J.,"Bayside, NY",0,3,2,5.0,8/5/2017,"Jia, Chinese for family, lives up to its name. A currated menu of dishes inspired by family recipes with an Asian fusion spin, the food has both the comfort of home and the experience of dining out in a fresh new corner of a familiar neighborhood. The prices are hard to beat for the quality you're getting, and the service is attentive and efficient. Easily a place one can stop by and get a delicious bite to eat.",,,
