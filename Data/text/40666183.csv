They also have nice comfy couches to sit on. The vibe is low-key so it's a nice place if you just wanna hang out with friends and actually talk to each other. The first time I came here, we ended up making friends with two different groups of patrons and played Cards Against Humanity together! I think it's usually a little more crowded on weeknights/Fridays but when I came here on a Saturday evening, it was empty. That can be a good thing though if you're just looking to sit down somewhere and have a no-frills drink.",1

I don't know what this Michael A is talking about or how he knows such specific details from that night. I'm pretty sure employees making their own profiles to bash customers and give positive reviews to their working establishment is against Yelp rules and guidelines.Anyway when we got there I ordered a PBR and before the bartender even gave me my drink, he asked me for a tip. I said I'll leave a tip after I get a few more drinks but he insisted I leave one. I also asked for water along with the PBR and he refused to give it to me. We were judged as soon as we walked into the bar. Then the woman hosting the trivia night SAYS OVER THE MICROPHONE you guys must be straight...I don't appreciate people assuming my sexual preference but fine we all politely ignored it. Then she says she's going to ask me a ""hard question"" then asks me ""Is it hard?"" and looks down at my crotch area. I ignored her sexual advance and I answered the question right and the woman told me that I get a free shot.So get this, she walks up to the bartender to say I get a free shot. The bartender looks me straight in the eyes and says ""You get this!"" and he flicks our whole table off. We left as soon as that happened as we felt scared for our safety. Needless to say we will never be back. Such a shame we are all college film graduates and wanted to watch the Oscars at a dive bar with people that enjoy the cinematic arts like we do. But as the woman hosting the trivia night put it we only know how to ""play the football'",

You really can't beat $3 PBRs and $5 well drinks in the heart of the East Village.

My friends and I were excited to check it out after passing it a few times and thinking it looked like fun. Wow were we wrong. From the moment we entered, it was laughingly bad. Terrible, terrible bartender. I wish I knew his name so I could inquire about how he manages to have a job. He was wearing a bowtie and glasses. He was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered in New York, which is obviously saying something. We ordered their awful drinks and sat down only to be annoyed by another employee, who was a man dressed like a woman. This person immediately began asking strange questions over the bar's microphone, which was upsetting not only us, but the others in the bar (which wasn't many). We finished our drinks as fast as possible so we could finally leave. Safe to say we won't be going back, and I highly suggest you do the same, not even if this is the last bar on earth.

So if you're like me and just enjoy reading scathing reviews of terrible places -- best move along.Queen Vic serves food, which I've never had. Though I've been to this bar hundreds of times, I only just learned this from a reviewer here. But nobody (as far as I'm aware) comes for the food. They come for the inexpensive but dangerously strong drinks. They come for the atmosphere which is ideal for catching up with friends, and people-watching on Second Avenue from the massive windows on the north- and east-facing walls. They come to chat with the -- gasp -- actually entertaining and pleasant bartenders.You walk into Queen Vic with whatever worries you might've had, with whatever weight on your shoulders, and you stumble out bereft of them.Melodramatic?

But if you're looking to drink cheaply around a good mix of sweet people or if you want to catch up with an old friend while sitting on a couch, this is that bar.Only annoying thing is they switch back and forth between taking cards and being cash only every few months. So always have cash on you cause you never know when they're not going to be taking cards. Last time I went it was cash only again. The good news is you will only need a $20. God bless the Queen.",

Good mix of high-top bar tables as well as comfy looking couches and seats (I didn't get a chance to use them!) There was a decent amount of people, but nothing over-bearing or crazy. Two old men hanging at the bar, along with another random guy. Three gay dudes off on the other side of the bar. Two other groups of girls and their gay friends at the comfy seating areas. High top tables had some ladies hanging out and one or two dates, plus myself. Ambiance was very relaxed, complete with the fake fireplace. Windows were large and great for looking out into the city and passer-bys. Some Union Jacks were around, and the menu chalked onto boards above the bar. I just didn't like the jukebox...some people want to play music that obviously is meant for a bump-and-grind club. Really?!Ordered an Old Fashioned from the bartender. It took a little bit, but I'm usually prepared for this since not everyone walks into a bar and orders one. The bartender made it the right way though, complete with a lemon twist (and yes, he actually twisted it!)The only main drawback is the TVs, the large one situated over the fireplace. I don't like TVs in my bars, especially over a fireplace (fake as it was.) If I wante to watch M*A*S*H, I'd have stayed home!Concluding, my 30 minutes there alone wasn't disappointing.

I ordered a Newcastle Brown and my beer was definitely something else, but for lack of caring, I drank it.

It took a while to get served. Once I ordered, I found out they were out of most of their beer specials for the night. Ordered an alternative and was pleasantly surprised by the similarly low prices.I read somewhere that QV is owned by the same people as Boiler Room. It has a similar relaxed atmosphere and crowd, although with a few more ladies than are typically at Boiler Room. I enjoyed the variety of seating options, mid-level volume, and the large windows!

What a mistake that would have been! When the bar tender saw me lollygagging on the sidewalk, she peeked her head out and said ""Come on in, it's great!"".DRINKS: The drinks were amazing and cheap. I had a $5 glass of refreshing Pims Cup (bartender's reco), and a $3 glass of Sangria (which was quite strong). The bar tender, Cat, Â took time out to get to know us and to tell my literary friend about the bar's book swap. When we were getting ready to leave, she even bought us a round of drinks and a shot for the road. FOOD/SERVICE: I had the fish n chips and a black berry pie, both really good. I was especially impressed when I ordered a slice of blackberry pie and the cook, Joe, manned the bar while Cat went out to fetch more ice cream (they ran out before I got there). Most places would have told me to order something else but not Queen Vic. That's customer service!! ATMOSPHERE: I loved the old pub feel of this place. With wifi, comfy chairs, and TVs that they are totally willing to let you change the channel on if you ask, this place was the perfect Sunday afetrnoon hang out. I felt like I was sitting at home in my living room. Also, there were a ton of regulars which is always a good sign. Everyone was friendly and called each other by their first names.

I've been to England many times, mostly London pubs and I've had a cozier feel. We sat at the bar for dinner, we looked over the folded menus by the side of the bar, and the bartender was NOT welcoming. He did not ask us what we wanted to drink, he did NOT even offer water, or acknowledge us. He kept talking to three patrons by the end of the bar. I thought that was rude. We asked for a sample of the Tetley's on draft, just to see what it was like, and it was completely flat tasting. I don't know if thats how its supposed to be, but the ginger ale I ordered after that, was also completely flat. I couldn't even get the bartenders attention to tell him any of my concerns, because he was too busy talking to others or going outside for a cigarette. So I kept my mouth shut, and let my friend do the talking. We ordered a Cornish beef pastie with mushy peas. The Cornish beef pastie was yummy, and tasted kind of like a Chicken Pot Pie. The mushy peas on the other hand, were really sour as if there was vinegar. When Kim asked the bartender if there was vinegar, he asked the cook, and informed us it was chicken stock and salt? Kind of weird, and we didn't even really eat much of it.Now for the TV and juke box... WOW thats another story. One of the staff, don't know what he was, but he was young, and his music selection was kind of off the wall. A bunch of pop music and we even heard a track by Josie and the Pussycats? He was sort of singing along to it to. Who knows what his role was, but he was walking from behind the bar to the front and not really doing much? The TV was on LOGO. I have no issues with LOGO but its not really a bar type of channel to have? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it was so boring staring at that channel with a bunch of boring soap operas and something that we should do in the comforts of home?*****Improvements they can make:-Hire a host/hostess-Play some British music (even if its pop music!)-Get a new bartender, or tell the existing one to change his attitude and -acknowledge his patrons, especially if they are sitting in front of you!-Turn the TV onto something other than soap operas?? It doesn't have to be sports!Maybe if we see some improvements, we'll be back.",4

My friend lost his phone there one night and didn't realize it until we had been gone for two hours already.

It turned out to be a good choice though, as we easily grabbed a table and drinks were SUPER cheap. $3.75 well drinks and Irish car bombs meant that we only paid about $20/person for several rounds and food-- RIDICULOUS.Only three stars for you though, Queen Vic-- service was sloooooow (even before the bar got increasingly packed), and they ran out of things like shot glasses even before the bar reached a whopping 15 patrons or so. Food was also subpar.. (mushy french fries= sad face).Overall, not a place I would frequent, but I would think of them again the next time I'm in the area and wish to stock up on cheap drinks.",

Â Even in my intoxicated state I new their french fries were no good. Â They were chilli cheese but with little chili and even less cheese. My friend had corned beef and cabbage - the corned beef was eh but maybe that's because I like Jewish Deli corned beef?I would go back if I could sit on that couch again by the front window, that was a nice place to rest.",

I had a beer and the shepards pie. Nothing to write home about, but it was cold and rainy that day so it was a good warm up. I would say the most entertaining part of the evening was when a (very old and very decrepit) woman came in to eat. She had the entire place to choose from, but of course chose the table directly on top of ours. She talked to us, the waiter and most often, her self. She ordered the oysters on the half shell and slurped every one down like she were noisily French kissing a lover. It was beyond nasty. But boy, did she enjoy those oysters.Not sure I'd ever return, but it wasn't bad overall. The design of the place is cute, there's a fireplace with a few overstuffed arm chairs near by to plunk down into.",

The bartender was really friendly and Doctor Who and Buffy were playing on the TV while I was there (a VERY welcome respite from sports at a bar). The shepherd's pie was really good...flavorful meat with a nice balance of lamb and beef and a nice creamy mashed potato top. Eric got fancy British pigs in a blanket. The sausages were very flavorful and the blankets were a cross between a puff pastry and a biscuit. They were covered in gravy which was excellent for dipping.The happy hour special was great and lasted for a long time. I had heard people grumble about the prices when this place first opened but I thought everything was really good and reasonably priced.I could definitely see making this a regular spot especially in the winter with the faux fireplace.,3

Â And if you are a dessert fan, definitely try the blackberry apple crumble with custard. Â You'll be surprised at how delicious it is. Â Happy hour goes well into the evening, I think until midnight. Â Do British pubs even stay open that late? Â Tetley's and Guinness for five bucks is more than reasonable, and the taps seem to be clean, not that usual hangover-inducing draft you're used to in the East Village.As for the music - well., the jukebox has a lot of great stuff, but be forewarned, it's one of those 2 credits per song deals so, $5 may give you 12 credits, but, that's only 6 songs. Â I've found it best to just ride it out and wait for it to go on shuffle.. Â Once you get past your friends' shitty Jason Mraz playlist, the box starts throwing out some truly obscure and delectable gems. Â (I've heard Bollock Brothers, Tones On Tail, Saint Etienne, and Stardust, to name a few.) Â Service is great. Â The bartender always brings the drinks to us - I've never had to go to the bar other than one time to ask the owner ""How the hell does this thing have Performance by Tones On Tail? Â That's awesome!""So yeah, friendly service, exceedingly great food, impeccable music selection (except when your friends go to the jukebox), and of course, chair-dancing British chicks.I'll definitely be back.",4

Directly across from Belcourt, it should be packed on a weekend. But it was empty. With a fake yet still comforting fireplace, comfy and eclectic seating, lots of tables, and an overall relaxed vibe, this place has the makings of something great. So why was it empty? To start, beers are basically always $5, even during ""happy hour."" Come on, this is the East Village, not midtown. We are not fools. When there are hundreds of bars nearby offering even a dollar cheaper, that's where the masses will go. I can see being $5 during regular hours, but during happy hour, entice me a little! Food special? Hot Toddy's for $4? Hope this place gets it together soon and starts drawing the crowds it deserves.",2

My friend ordered the toad-in-a-hole plate (which was supposed to have 3, but only had 1), and it was luke warm, waited too long for the other two to be delivered(which were also luke warm), and the place was quiet. And there was nothing next to it, no sides at all. For 14 dollars, they need to put a couple sides and make a better/ fuller plate. My bangers and mashed were great, and the fish and chips are yiummy too.I'll give this place 4 stars, which is a little generous.

But actually, the fish and chips weren't that bad, though the chips were more French Fries than British chips. You did get the real vinegar to top them off with, as well as decently breaded and not overly fried fish. The beer variety wasn't all that British, unless Brooklyn (IPA and Lager) moved to England without telling anyone. The bar has a lot of tables and a small bar. For some reason, no one sits at the tables, and everyone (a crowd of regulars, it seems), squeezes around the bar. If you're with a group, snagging a table should be easy!
