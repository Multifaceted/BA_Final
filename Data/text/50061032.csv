0,Dove C.,"New York, NY",906,80,18,4.0,7/12/2018,"I have been getting the impossible sliders here lately and I really love them- especially with the Jalapeño Jack cheese. This is a vegan patty, so you don't have to get cheese on it of course.For the most part the restaurant is comfortable and service is fast. The staff has been very friendly on every visit. Even when there is a long line of customers the staff seems to maintain composure, stay organized and polite to each person. From what I have witnessed, it is not easy to work customer service in New York particularly in fast food restaurants, so I always applaud a good team. Thank you for giving us a vegetarian option on the menu. I really love the french fries, and the Impossible Burger combo meal is a great alternative for fast food when I'm in a hurry.",2,,
1,Rafi S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,1,3.0,11/8/2018,What can I say. I went here on a dare from coworkers and it wasn't horrible. I had a sack of the bacon and cheese sliders and must say they were pretty tasty. Now the down side is that there are so many crazy folks in the location. Not the most upstanding crowd if you know what I mean. All in all worth the trip if you can get around the cray cray traffic,,,
2,Gina W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4,3,0,4.0,11/4/2018,I like coming to this place over the years and usually go around lunch time on my break.  The sliders are always consistent.  Ive taken a few people here for their first time over the years and the staff is always happy to help them out.  Service is pretty quick too at this one.  I have been there during some busy times and it never takes longer than 15 minutes.  The price is always good here.  The location doesn't look very big from the outside but I have always been able to get a table.  They could clean a little more often but I've never had a problem with the cleanliness of the  food.,,,
3,Dan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",474,454,69,1.0,10/21/2018,Could not find this location. Map and directions on Yelp is wrong don't waste your time.,,,
4,E H.,"American Fork, UT",2,75,13,3.0,10/9/2018,Very nice employees and they have to put up with some salty people. The food was a solid B it was my first time in a White Castle. The service was very slow though. We waited 15 minutes to get our food after waiting 10 minutes just to order.,,,
5,Lawrence R.,"New York, NY",35,69,56,2.0,2/5/2018,"Number of visits: Once.As a former employee of White Castle, I was extremely excited to discover that this place was around the corner from one of the many sites at my new job. I had to go back because I had... well, I had the crave.When I walked in - ""oh, mama"" - there were no seats available. This kind of situation gives me a lot of stress because I have some serious issues. Serious issues. It seemed as if vagrants spend time here. The ordering area had two groups of people: the line waiting to order and the huddle off to the side waiting for their food. It's never a comforting feeling having to order through a wall of glass.I ordered the #2 combo with two double cheeseburgers. ""Change the French fries to hash browns, please. And add a chicken waffle on the side."" Then, I stood aside, just watching.""I miss working in White Castle... Maybe not.""Not less than a month ago, I was on the inside. Now, I'm on the outside looking in. During my 10 to 15 minute wait, I stood to the side most of the time. I watched as one or two customers complained about waiting too long. Another customer argued that she was missing ten burgers. (The #8 combo comes with ten burgers, not twenty!) I tried to get a ginger ale from the soda machine, but it was literally empty. Over 100 combinations and all you could get was either water or seltzer. It was unbelievable. I was able to secure a seat in a corner. Yay!The employees were cordial under pressure. Their issue was sending out orders in time and you could tell that they had no time to refill the soda machine.As for the food, the double cheeseburgers were good ol' White Castle double cheeseburgers. The hash browns were fresh and crispy. The chicken waffle wasn't as crispy and wasn't as hot. My crave was satisfied, but the entire experience wasn't great. As one of the other customers exclaimed, ""I spent my entire break waiting for y'all."" Hey! Me too, buddy! You don't see me complaining! Well, until now.Two and a half stars out of five. That half star is for the good food and smiles. But will I return? Only if it's not too busy.",1,2,
6,Thomas E.,"Fort Worth, TX",284,236,225,2.0,12/2/2017,"The food was just fine - like any other white castle. I got the double burger, the fish burger, chicken burger, and the chicken and waffle burger. They specialty sandwiches weren't that great, and I should have stuck with the original sliders.The inside is a bit dated and some of the tables/chairs were wonky. The staff seemed really friendly though.I do enjoy white castle every once and a while so i'll probably come back at some point!",1,1,
7,Miriam G.,"Manhattan, NY",184,2,0,3.0,8/15/2018,Three stars the food was hot chicken rings juicy  chicken and fish sandwich too crispy. Down $23. Asked for a cup for ice since my water I paid for was room temperature. So there out of courtesy cups and want me to pay $2 and change for a regular drink cup.  Not my fault they ran out of courtesy cups why should I pay $2 and change for an empty paper cup smfh and the tables were dirty leaned on the table and had the previous customers crumbs on my forearms. Disgusted!,1,,
8,Ruth C.,"McAllen, TX",244,496,459,3.0,1/25/2018,"This was the closest White Castle to us, so we ventured out to try and find it. It was basically a Harold and Kumar experience, cause it was so out of the way. The soda machine had most of the flavors out of order. It was pretty frustrating. And the place itself was kinda sketchy looking, like thy had security concerns or something. But nonetheless, the food satisfied my craving.",,,
9,Mitchell M.,"Concord, CA",0,27,5,1.0,9/16/2018,The rest room had poop and urine and trash on the floor. Absolutely disgusting. One could only guess that the same cleanliness is in the kitchen. Calling the health inspector... thank god we don't have these back in the West.,,,
10,James W.,"Bronx, NY",84,11,5,3.0,3/11/2018,"I visit many of the White Castles in NYC and stop at this one whenever I'm in Harlem. Order your food, then leave. Do not dine in. If you like White Castle's food, the food is on point and delicious. The restaurant is dirty and some of the clientele are shady. Open 24/7.",3,,
11,Morris D.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,160,1,2.0,8/8/2016,"So Ive been hearing about this place since the 80s when I was in Jr High listening to the Beastie Boys.. its basically a McDonalds.. with bullet proof glass. lol . as me and shorty tried to eat our tiny ass burgers some ratchet ass broad answer her phone ""hey, baby daddy"" then goes on to tell him that she is IN white castle but not EATING white castle she was only here to change diapers..",3,2,1
12,Pie L.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,9/12/2015,"Read couple of the review and was already negative about the burgers. Bought me a #2 and surprisingly the burgers, fries, and drink were pretty good! I would give it 5 Star but the place was a little dirt, only saw one person cleaning. I always see in other fast food restaurants couple people cleaning, specially when your at a high demand. Pretty good! But a somewhat more expensive than I was thinking!",2,,
13,Tanquray J.,"Bronx, NY",0,24,7,1.0,10/16/2016,"I got some stale refried french toast sticks. Yuck. Burgers are soggy. Cashiers, unprofessional",,1,
14,Ernesto G.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",129,21,6,4.0,12/15/2013,"Like most other reviewers I was siked to check this place out as it was recommended highly by my friends Harold, kumar, and Mary Jane.  I got what I expected. Ok junk food to stuff my pie whole with.  The staff did seem a lil slow but like any fast food spot your not exactly dealing with the brightest.There's a plexiglass barrier between you and the cashier.  Not exactly welcoming.",2,1,
15,Kay G.,"Jamaica, NY",39,12,4,1.0,5/27/2016,I think this place uses bad / old oil. Ate some fish sandwiches that had such a bad aftertaste. I will not be back,1,,1
16,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,4.0,12/22/2014,"I see alot of the reviews for poor ratings.  This is White Castles people not a 5 star restaurant.  White Castles is normally known  for cheap late night  'I am drunk food "".  I visited this location on a Sunday around 2pm. Ordered 2 jalapeño cheeseburgers and  small orange drink.  Took more than 5 minutes. But when I got my food it was fresh and hot.  Although next time I will probably order OnLine to avoid such a long wait.  I gave them 4 stars. I WILL BE BACK.",3,,3

18,Kanika H.,"New York, NY",74,195,6,3.0,2/12/2015,"If you're looking for a fancy place to eat, don't come to White Castle.   You'll be sorely disappointed.  Atmosphere:  This location is gross and dingy and rife with stoners. This is typical of most White Castles in the area.  If you have a delicate stomach, or prefer a more elegant ambiance while eating, order your food to go.Service:  It is what it is.  You order through the plexiglass, pay for your fare and pick it up at the next window.Food- The burgers are nasty good.  Don't know if it's the soggy buns, or the rehydrated onions, but it is that guilty indulgence that I enjoy every so often.  Apparently WC is legendary for messing with your digestive system, but my bowels have remained intact so far.  The secret is to *not* have the milkshakes with your burgers.Also- they have a cute little set up on Valentine's day.  You can reserve a table for a candlelight date and/or even get married there!  I've never tried it, nor know anyone who has, but it's good to know that the option is there for those who want it!So yay!  A fan!  No regrets or shame!",,,
19,Jonathan L.,"Austin, TX",185,252,144,1.0,4/29/2011,I was really expecting something more than a measly patty stuck between two stale buns. Did I also mention that I had to wait 10 minutes for my order to be ready? I only had two people ahead of me!I was expecting White Castle to be at least better than McDonalds (guess not!); Harold and Kumar must have been really high to be able to finish eating these burgers!,2,1,2
20,Kristina L.,"New York, NY",987,506,1239,1.0,1/12/2012,"I donno how Herald and Kumar wanted this so bad...I was so excited to be on the west coast and to finally try what Herald and Kumar wanted soo bad....then I took a bite and AHHHH THE WORST BURGERS EVER! The sliders were so oily, moist, and just not good! Not worth the hype! I say if you ever think about going to this place...DONT....unless you want your stomach to hurt and your taste buds to go bad! PLus, the people were very unhapppy working there and unfriendly to the customers.",,3,
21,Janen G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,76,6,1.0,1/2/2015,Sometimes you just have to honor your craving. Basic place for basic burgers. White Castles will never be fancy.,2,1,1
22,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",9,37,0,2.0,1/28/2015,"Boy did I learn a lesson today. Don't be lazy and go to this location for White Castle again! First off, the staff, even with cash registers, is bad at math. They gave me a dollar back for change when I gave them a $20 bill for my order. As for my order, it took almost 15 to 20 minutes for me to get it. While I was waiting, I've noticed the smell of overused oil. (Good thing I didn't order fries of rings). Also another customer complaining that there was a hair in their slider. Not good, and I usually go to this WC when I'm in a hurry. Now I've triple checked my sliders before I ate them. I was okay, but I'm not going back.",1,1,

My head is spinning.Took a while, but settled on:clam stripsonion ringscheeseburger (w onions, extra k'sup)Result:clam strips--Not half-bad.

25,Mabel T.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,0,4.0,7/15/2015,White Castle Burgers an old and iconic burger joint filled with a lot of history. Still pushing out fabulous tiny burgers filled with tons of flavor. While here in New York with my family I was able to take my daughter to her first White Castle experience and she loved it. I must say it's been a couple of years since I've ate White Castle but it still rocks and the staff was great and the food was on point!,,,

Updated review","I miss White Castle. Those little steamed burgers with tiny bits of onions makes for a mouth-watering late night meal. I miss them so much I dream about them, and wake up in the middle of the night with cold sweats, drooling on my pillow.Yes it was a slyders wet dream.Seriously, the only way I can get those burgers are the frozen family packs I get at the supermarket. But it just taste so much greasier and better when you get them from here, even though I feel like I'm going to get shanked here. I will never come here at night, no matter how hungry I am.",7,7,7
27,Toya H.,"Stamford, CT",30,106,14,5.0,2/17/2011,The only people writing bad reviews about White Castle are NON-NEW YORKERS! If you want an In-N-Out burger eat at an In-N-Out burger. White Castle is a stable in this fine city.,5,5,5
28,Kimberly N.,"Campbell, CA",134,48,6,1.0,11/5/2010,"Disgusting. Repulsive. Vomitous. I actually spit it out. It must be made from the lowest grade meat possible. Plus, the bun is so soggy it feels like paste/goo. I went to McDonald's to get this horrible taste out of my mouth. And I thought McDonalds was the worst food in the world before this.",2,2,1
29,Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,572,13,2.0,4/13/2011,For decades I have heard of White Castle.  I finally had one and all I can say is that they are nasty.  The bun was too soggy for my taste.  Sorry.,,,
30,Y K.,"Oakland, CA",208,385,35,4.0,1/27/2010,"Mine and D's hangover preventative of choice. Sketchy area, but haven't had better White Castles anywhere yet. Don't get the chicken sliders.",,,
31,Ted N.,"Westwood, CA",25,9,0,4.0,7/8/2008,"I was in Harlem yesterday, and I thought, I ain't never had a White Castle Burger before, I guess I'll go and try one (or four).  I got in there and the experience was totally complete.  The registers were covered in glass to prevent robberies, the soda machine was shut off (""so the crazies don't come in here with a plastic bag and fill it up"" according to the register) and the really friendly lady at the next table chatted with us about the neighborhood (while dealing drugs)  Can't say I didn't experience the real Harlem.As for the food, exactly what I expected: greasy, tasty, and just a tiny bit questionable.  The sliders were greasy heaven in a box (though any more than four would probably make me throw up) and the fries with honey mustard was a good flavor combination.  As was expected, one of my friends found a hair in one of her sliders, and I bit into something slightly fishy from my fry box when I wasn't paying attention.  All in all, it was a trip I will not soon forget, a true Harlem experience.",2,3,3
32,Kiki B.,"Cambridge, MA",5,317,0,2.0,6/19/2008,meh is the most accurate description.  mcdonald's is better for a similar little patty experience.,1,2,1
