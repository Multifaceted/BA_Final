0,Deana B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",342,101,295,4.0,8/25/2017,"Q Marqet has been my go-to for breakfast since I moved up here a few years ago. My typical order is an egg white omelette platter with jalapeños, spinach, tomato and onion. The home fries/breakfast potatoes are some of the best I've ever had. They do run out of the potatoes early, likely because of the huge portions, so I would advise getting there between 9:30 - 10:00am the latest of you really want those extra carbs. The coffee here is pretty solid - they have both hot and iced. I've also tried the hot and cold food buffet bar a few times which is awesome. Huge variety of food and everything always looks fresh. The area is always clean as well. You can also buy plenty of snacks, sweets, house hold items, ice cream and more from here. There is one big con to this bodega - it is cash only. I'd honestly buy a lot of items here if it wasn't cash only. Oh well.",,,
1,Swatee A.,"Floral Park, NY",132,550,4587,3.0,8/26/2018,"Any deli in Manhattan that sells a beautiful selection of flower bouquet(s) wins major brownie points in my book. Sure they're quite pricey but you get what you pay for. Besides, if you're visiting someone at Mt. Sinai Hospital, a couple of blocks down Madison Avenue, what better way to brighten the visit than with some (expensive) beautiful flowers! HeheFlowers aside, this deli has everything. A separate sandwich counter, sushi counter, chips, sodas, cookies, cereal, dried fruit, real fruit, soup, and a Hot/cold salad bar, which is also quite costly at $8.99/pound. The lunch crowd doesn't mind as hungry patrons line up the store. I gave only three stars because it is a Cash-only business. They have an ATM machine by the entrance (how convenient right?)",44,15,31
2,Deborah M.,"Yulee, FL",1001,552,5160,5.0,10/27/2016,"This place is pretty awesome.Its a food convenience market on steroids.Today I was on the run, so I grabbed a large hazelnut coffee and a buttered roll for $3.25. In NYC you cannot beat that price. They also have all sorts of breakfast sandwiches to order. Sushi and hot bar are located at the back of the store.The guys behind the deli counter are light in fast and have great smiles. Dont forget the tip jar located on thw top of the deli area. I have stopped here alot just to grab a Snapple and the ladies working the register are always friendly and smiling. You really feel like they are glad to see you. Although there are alot of fabulous food carts in the area, this place has such a great selection it certainly gives the food carts a run for their money. Value for what you order is excellent considering its location in the city.",6,4,6
3,Ashley A.,"New York, NY",3,91,202,3.0,1/27/2018,Great location and great options. There is more than what mets the eye here as the store is bigger and has more food options than one would assume. I'd give them a higher rating if they accepted credit/debit cards. Cash only is a let down but they do have an ATM is store so it helps.,,,
4,Ashley S.,"Manhattan, NY",286,457,898,4.0,2/16/2017,"This is a good place to come for breakfast or lunch, but it's actually open 24 hours. I usually come here for breakfast. They have delicious egg sandwiches to which you can add avocado, hot sauce, tomato, or whatever you'd like. Their coffee is pretty good for a convenience store. The prices are also reasonable. $3-4 for a breakfast sandwich depending on what you get on it. They also have an assortment of cupcakes including oreo and red velvet which are pretty good. And they also have delicious fruit and yogurt parfaits. Overall, the quality here is great for the price. Also, they finally have their ""A"" rating back from the health department, so I'm adding an extra star :)",1,1,2
5,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",458,655,80,2.0,12/15/2016,"Had the hot buffet here for $7.99/lb. Overpriced if you ask me. The food wasn't bad but nothing really stood out. It got you full and that's about it. I'd normally just give 3 stars but this place is actually cash only. What establishment in NYC that caters to  the working class lunch crowd is CASH ONLY!? This is stupid, plain and simple. I had to use their ATM for which they charge a fee just so I could pay for my lunch. So instead of them eating a 50 cent fee for me to use my credit card, they instead profit an additional $3 from me having to use THEIR ATM machine so I can pay THEM. All this on top of what they probably save by underreporting their taxes. I will not be coming here again even though I work at Mount Sinai down the street. These people are NOT keeping it real.",2,,
6,Melanie D.,"Queens, NY",249,496,310,4.0,7/24/2017,"4/5 for convenience for drinks and candy. Ive tried their hot/cold food and its over seasoned with everything you could possibly season with. They really dont know how to cook and the food isnt properly closed, its exposed to all the air and theres a lot of traffic by that store. Im not surprised to read reviews that people got sick here.",1,,
7,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,936,4.0,12/1/2015,"This place has tons of food options. Its open all of the time (even on Thanksgiving). It has sushi, hot bar, lots of pre-packaged... but I skip all of that and go straight for the sandwiches. The deli has not let me down. I'm not a huge fan of the pre-made paninis... I don't think any great food is pre-made, but I have tried several sandwiches (6+) and all have been solid. My favorite has been the Chicken Pesto.I love that its reliable and always open, the only place in this area. Staff are always friendly though they always seemed rushed (even at 3 am of a nigh shift with on one around).-1 star for cash only :(",1,1,1
8,Mitchell B.,"Bronx, NY",4,13,0,1.0,3/20/2017,Please avoid Q-Market!  I was just talking to a friend of mine and she mentioned that she knows 4 people who have gotten sick from the food at the Q-Market on 98th and Madison Ave.  But that was not the cherry on the ice cream!  She caught one of the register ladies with her pinky on the scale when ringing up what she owed.  She told the woman to take her pinky off the scale when she was measuring the weight of the food and then told her to step back.  Everyone there at the moment then noticed how the food cost went down in price.  I stopped going to this location because I knew there was something shady happening.  I now only go to Superior Cafe next to Duane Reade at 1290 Madison & 102nd St where their food costs are a bit lower and they don't put their fingers on the scale when weighing the food.,4,,
9,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,7/1/2016,"Thanks for: (1) the one cashier who always has a smile and never gives me any judgmental side-eye when I pick up two pints of Ben & Jerry's and a couple bags of Haribo gummies. (2) the amazing strawberry yogurt/granola parfait that rivals only the yogurt in the Secaucus train station. It's around $4-5 so stupidly pricier than any homemade parfaits but when it's Sunday night and Game of Thrones is about to start, nothing else quite hits the spot. (3) being open at very late hours. I haven't tried any of the hot bar items or the sushi, but let's just note that Q Marqet has a very extensive stash of chips and snacks. I've found Herr's pickle chips and Haribo ginger gummies (the rarest of all the Haribo candy!) tucked away here.  Awesome for my sugar addiction, terrible for my dentist and my waistline. The downsides are the cash-only policy and the fact that the damn Ben & Jerry's is about $6 each.  You can find way cheaper ice cream in the Morton William's further down Madison.",4,2,2
10,Shiho K.,"ASTORIA, NY",10,43,169,4.0,7/15/2017,I love it here. Hot buffet is so tasty. They have Korean and Chinese food. I always go there when I need to go around there. It's 24 hours open.,,,
11,Samantha S.,"New York, NY",12,86,75,3.0,9/5/2017,"Solid deli option for the area. Fast efficient deli counter and they have a hot food ""buffet"" station in the back that is by the pound. Everything is a bit overpriced and in terms of flavor it's not the best. But considering the few dining options in the area it will do. Most of the food in the buffet section is very salty. Now the actual food part about this deli is the sushi station which is only open for lunch during the weekdays. They have great udon! Tons of toppings and very tasty and fast. Otherwise this place is not my first choice but when in a bind it will do.",1,,
12,Hero P.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",4,47,0,3.0,5/13/2017,"The prices are good, the burgers are the same quality as the stands on the street. They only accept cash, but charge you tax...hmmm seems like honest tax paying business.",1,1,
13,erin h.,"New York, NY",11,44,8,1.0,4/9/2017,"They overcharged me for my sandwich , then decide to tell me that it's $1 extra for lettuce... first of all, this isn't posted anywhere, secondly, who charges extra for lettuce on a deli sandwich?!??! Cashier was extremely rude when I questioned this. Also, cash only, no exceptions. Go to Sammys a block away, they're cheaper, more friendly, food is much better... and they understand that a deli sandwich includes more than just slapping meat on a roll.",1,,
14,Lindy D.,"New York, NY",160,72,69,4.0,7/9/2016,"Q Market is a gem. You would never notice it just walking by because it looks like an average convenience store market, but inside they have a huge variety of food and drink options. You can get everything from a fresh made sandwich, to ramen/stir fry (Good! Fresh!), to sushi and seaweed salad, to hot breakfast foods (I love a hot egg white, cheese, and home fry wrap!). They have a big selection of coffees and teas at all times, and the coffee is fresh is not burnt even at 2am. There is a hot buffet during the day with fresh foods available as well. This store is open 24/7 and the only downside is that they only take cash. They have an ATM though. Summary: Open 24/7, functional, you get can almost any food you want and it won't be bad, but they only take cash.",1,,
15,Shay R.,"Chicago, IL",181,272,448,3.0,2/21/2015,Q Marqet is a typical corner store that is good if you need to grab a quick bite to eat or picking up essential items for your apartment. Pros:They are open late so it's great when you are coming home from a night out and you can get a breakfast sandwichThey have delicious and affordable muffins available at all timesThere are no ATM fees when using the ATMCons: Q Marqet is cash only Hot food is $7+ per pound so it adds up quicklyThe food in the hot food section and the pastry section tends to sit out for a long period of time The staff is never really able to provide clarification on what the specific foods are in the hot food section,1,,
16,Devin L.,"Yonkers, NY",309,729,108,3.0,10/16/2014,"In the area overnight and wanted a good sandwich.  It's a 24 hr deli/market. I ordered a pretty simple cold cut sandwich and went looking for something else to munch on.I ended up grabbing some pretzels, my sandwich and a coffee.  The pretzels were your regular packaged variety.  The coffee was a bit strong, probably a bit old.  The sandwich was tasty and fresh.  Honestly, it's an adequate place to grab a bite at any time of day.  Nothing special, but very serviceable.As stated by others, Cash Only!",1,1,1

21,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",68,59,2,5.0,3/27/2014,"On the way to visit a friend at Mount Sinai, I was lulled in to Q Marqet by the $1 ANY SIZE COFFEE sign.   I was impressed by the selection of coffees.  There are several hot flavors to choose from in both caff and decaf.  Customers pour and season their own coffee.  Several milk and cream options. There is a made-to-order korean/asian food counter and a hot food bar with all types of selections.  Lots of snacks and options here, and the prices seem reasonable for manhattan.Q Marquet reminds me of a mom-and-pop Wawa (for  those who haven't been to a Wawa... you are missing out!... make a point to go during your next visit to Jersey).  Q Marquet is everything you want a small bodega to be.  I wish this market was closer to where I live.  Hooray for Q Marqet!",2,2,2
22,Brian R.,"Atlanta, GA",114,97,70,2.0,3/6/2014,"My favorite aspect of Q Marqet are the hours. Open 24/7 it seems. Always perfect when I'm getting back to my apartment really late and don't feel like making anything. Food is passable and there is a great variety from burgers, to sushi, to a buffet of prepared foods in the back. Quality of the food is nothing to write home about. Hmmm, maybe the hours are the only thing I really like about this place. It gets the job done whenever you need it to.Ok, so how else can I sum this place up? Mediocre food. Does not accept credit/debit cards, only cash. Everything here is overpriced except for the bad coffee which is a dollar for any size. Staff isn't all that friendly. And oh yea, once I saw a cockroach running across the floor. I know roaches are all over the city, but I still don't like to see them out in the open at establishments were I'm purchasing food.I only come here when I really need to.2 stars.",1,1,1

I literally eat there 3 - 4x / week because it's right near my place of work. the food is very good and buffet style, and they also have udon and bibimbap ... not to mention sushi... not to mention pretty much every kind of deli meat you can imagine if you just want a sandwich.  the vegetables in the buffet section are always made fresh (you can usually find the very nice korean chef tending to them)  and so very, very flavorful.  japchae on wednesdays and fridays is an extra delight of mine.  they definitely have a very loyal customer base.the ONE bad thing about Q is that it's cash only, which makes me terribly depressed if it's suddenly 2 pm and i haven't yet eaten lunch and then go on to realize i don't have any cash on-hand and do not have time to run out and get some.  but otherwise, the staff is friendly and a little harsh sometimes only to keep things moving since it's PACKED in there from 12 - 2 pm daily.",,,1
28,Lowie T.,"Manhattan, NY",72,264,24,4.0,9/6/2012,"Extra star for a FREE ATM!! What's the catch? There is none! Just a pure, unadulterated, no-fee, Automated Teller Machine. This alone makes me a fan.But that's not the only think Q Market has. Yo know those days where you want outside food, but you just don't know what? Well a walk into Q Market can usually remedy that. It has an odd mishmash of hot & cold food, from mango salads, to seafood, to chinese, indian, pasta, a sushi bar, deli counter, and pastry selection. There are also plenty of grocery snacks (chips, candy bars, juices) to augment your meal in case that wasn't enough food you weighed in. The staff is quick to keep the line moving, but always very friendly. Even if you missed the many ""Cash Only!!"" signs after they had rung up all your food and rush over to the FREE ATM. They must be used to this happening a hundred times a day. The food is not phenomenal, but will satisfy you and is relatively fresh (fruit & veggies at least), and prices reasonable. Sandwiches are a good bet when in doubt.",,,

31,Yunji L.,"New York, NY",106,152,95,4.0,4/16/2011,"This place is a good addition to the lunch options in the area. It's a convenience store + hot food bar + deli. They have baked goods and fresh fruits in the front of the store. To the side is a sandwich bar with your standard lunch meat choices. Back of the store is a decent hot food bar. You can choose from a variety of American/Asian food. The food is pretty fresh. I find the salads to be particularly good. I would though stay away from the roll/gimbop they have at the hot food bar since they put too much rice in it. Next to the food bar, they have a bibimbop station. I would have to try it next time I make a visit. On the walls and shelves are your snacks, canned food, simple grocery items. They carry lots of Asian brand items such as pocky and other kirin snacks. The cashiers are very quick and efficient, so have your wallet out if you don't want to hold up the line.
