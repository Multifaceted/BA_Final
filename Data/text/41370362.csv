0,Brian M.,"California, MD",144,113,168,4.0,7/1/2018,"Much closer to 4 than 4.1 - but good nonetheless. Started with a slightly dirty assembled wonderfully thanks to my Aussie mate manning the bar. Fish and chips good - not quite as crisp and flaky as one would want...Lobster Mac and cheese - tasty, $16 may be about $4 too high for this dish.  Overall, nice place to stop and rehydrate when walking from Times Square back to Chelsea.Tip:  To be applied anywhere... get your dirty without olives - based on price - each  .02 olive costs about $3.25 in displacement on a $16 martini.",2,,1
1,Jim T.,"East Brunswick, NJ",57,291,549,3.0,11/13/2018,"We stopped in for a few drinks after dinner and before our concert at MSG. There was still a happy hour up until 7pm I believe with some decent specials for NYC. $5 Bud Light bottles and I think $7 for some other draft beers. Service was pretty bad at the upstairs bar, the bartenders seemed more interested in their cell phones than serving drinks and making money. I think the 3 star rating this place has is exactly right... nothing great, nothing terrible... just an average pub in a city full of them.",2,1,1
2,Linda D.,"High Point, NC",52,90,137,5.0,11/12/2018,"Fun little place to eat. Made a reservation and were seated right away. We got a table at a window and it was a lot of fun to watch the city streets at night. After a crummy lunch elsewhere in the city that day, and a long grueling day of work, we were hungry and exhausted. Our server was fantastic, making us forget how exhausted we were, and the food was delicious and filling. Dinner seemed a bit expensive, but I guess that's just a NYC thing? Soda refills are not free, which is odd, we don't have that down here in NC. It was a little loud, but its a NYC bar, so we expected that. It was within CLOSE walking distance of our hotel, and it was warm and dry inside. Will definitely visit again if we are in the area.",,,
3,Yessika P.,"Bronx, NY",29,3,14,5.0,11/3/2018,"This has to be my favorite bar. Happy hour drinks are $8 and they are strong and delicious. They have Happy Hour food: Sliders (my favorite), wings etc. The regular price food is also delicious: chicken tenders, fries, penne pasta with chicken, mashed potatoes, chicken pot pie, steak sandwich, everything is really a must try. The staff is also amazing. Very attentive, friendly, helpful and great personalities. Never once have a felt rush when being there. Great place I will always recommend.",,,

Updated review","This place was the first place my husband and I went to when we got to New York. We were starving and we walked in unknowing of what to expect. The service was great and the food phenomenal.  The atmosphere was great too. It's a bit pricey but worth it I think, and they have a decent happy hour menus.",,,
7,Maria P.,"Freehold, NJ",233,82,622,2.0,5/11/2018,"The service was fantastic, but the food was terrible. First we ordered the scallop appetizer- it came out gritty as if it hadn't been cleaned properly. When we sent it back, the bartender said that the chef said it was frozen and there was nothing he could do about it. Then we ordered the fish tacos. They were supposed to be cod, but they tasted more like tuna fish with brown avocado on them. We said something to the bartender and watched as he told a manager who shrugged his shoulders. All in all, great bartenders- crappy food.",8,4,5

Updated review","After nearly two years of consistently ponying up to their bar and various evenings of table service, gotta add an extra star for how much they've improved AND kept their new excellence at a consistent level.The host station - both in person and on the phone - keeps getting better and better.The Manager (owner?) is friendlier and friendlier, and keeps it 100 with drink recommendations.Consistently good bartenders and bar-backs.Food quality has improved.They're now one of two go-to's for me in this 'hood.  Give 'em a whirl!",5,1,2
10,Staci A.,"Los Angeles, CA",103,178,623,2.0,1/19/2018,"My coworker and I came here for lunch after a long day of traveling.  We ordered the escargot, scallops, kale salad, roast beef sandwich and sweet potato fries.  I have to say, the only dish we really enjoyed was the sweet potato fries.  The kale salad was the laziest salad I have ever had.  It was just cut up pieces of kale, tasteless dressing, with huge pieces of pear and an avocado half placed on top of the salad.  The escargot did not have much flavor; I'm used to them being in a cream-based sauce, but these were in a broth.  The scallops were mediocre, and my coworker said that his soup tasted like water.  I would not recommend this restaurant, despite the good service they provided.",1,,1

12,Katie H.,"Waterbury, CT",3,62,57,3.0,3/7/2018,"We recently went to see Billy Joel and didn't have time to eat until afterwards.  This restaurant was thankfully open and serving a full menu.  We both had wings as an appetizer,  which were very good.  I choose ribs for my main,  and my fiance choose fish and chips.  My ribs were huge and tasty.  But the seasoning could have been applied before cooking not just after.  My finances fish and chips was sub par. A lot of breading, not great fish.  Overall,  we were happy we found food,  but unless it was late without other options open,  we aren't hurrying back.",,,
13,Au'Jah W.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,26,19,3.0,9/16/2018,"An okay place to come and get a drink while waiting for the train. They definitely need to update the restaurant though, it's a bit outdated.",,1,
14,Michael C.,"New York, NY",262,171,129,3.0,8/15/2017,"The food is average, but what really makes this place special is it's happy hour! They have a wide variety of cocktails (and some of them are very strong!!) starting at noon. If you're looking to meet up with a friend in midtown while transiting through NYC, this place might be your spot. It's in a less-interesting area of midtown, which makes this pub standout more.I usually order two cocktails during happy hour, but this place made a drink strong enough that I only had to order one. The bartenders we very nice and professional, which really added to our experience. I noticed one lady sitting at a table send back her cocktail because it was too strong.Will consider returning here for happy hour if in a rush for time and would like to meet up for a friend in the area.",,,
15,Doris M.,"Indianapolis, IN",21,23,38,4.0,6/1/2018,"I've come in before for Happy Hour but didn't order food. The Shepherds Pie is quite tasty. Sangria is a red wine with a little fruit added but not bad at all. More like a Malbec with fruit. Less than 1/2 block from my hotel so very convenient. A little noisy for my taste but plenty of seating and prompt service. No complaints here, I will try it again next time in NYC.",1,,1
16,Marlon G.,"Long Island City, NY",4,5,6,5.0,4/7/2018,We happened to walk by this place and decided to go in and boy were we not disappointed Let me start with the prosFood came out quick Let's start with the appetizer we got mild buffalo wings and the wings were Amaaazing plump chicken and the buffalo sauce was superb. For the main course I had the special of chicken and linguine in Alfredo sauce and it came out hot and delicious the sauce was great a good amount of chicken as well. My friend got angus burger the meat was juicy and cooked to perfection. My friends nephew got the steak tip sandwich with garlic bread also very deliciousNow the cons- The hostess was chewing gum while speaking to us (I found it very rude to chew gum as a hostess) the Security didn't let us go through at first bc my friends nephew was under age and thought we were going to the bar even when the waiter took us to a table the men's bathroom sink only had hot water thus it almost burned your hand.Final thoughts The food was really good and I would def come back here again,,,
17,Merlina R.,"Westminster, MD",1,40,33,5.0,9/23/2018,"Took the AMTRAK train from Baltimore, MD to NY Penn station. Got to Penn station close to 1pm to meet my friend outside the train station. She was coming from Harrisburg, PA, and were both famished. We passed by several restaurants with ""A"" ratings, but they were all crowded with several minutes wait time. As we walked a few more minutes, Houndstooth Pub had a couple of table vacant seats. We were seated as soon as we walked in. We were able to order within minutes. I ordered the Manchester and my friend order a seared salmon. My sandwich came with French fried sweet potato. The sandwich was big enough to served two people, that I had half of the sandwich to go. The service and the food was good. I can't say I will be back, because there are so many fine restaurants in NYC. This is a good restaurant, worth the ""A"" rating.",,,

You'll have to place an order with the bartender and hope that your food finds you.  If you're lucky, you'll find the roll of paper towel that will serve as a napkin.Food was just about passable.  Beer is reasonable.  Mixed drinks a little high.  Food overpriced for what it is.",1,,1
20,Tanisha F.,"Denton, TX",72,63,415,3.0,9/17/2017,"This little pub seemed it might have been better had we caught it during happy hour. The service was not so good. The waitress took our order and only came back once after that to bring us the check. The food was very tasteless and very over priced. I ordered the escargot which had no garlic taste whatsoever! I also ordered a tuna salad which was 18.00 and it had lettuce, cucumbers, radish, and the fish on the side. My friend ordered the fish n chips which she said was decent however the fries were hard and over cooked. I guess my recommendation would be to find something else if you are looking for good food but if your looking for a good happy hour this is your spot! They seem to have drink specials everyday of the week.",1,,

22,George B.,"Milton, MA",218,715,1,3.0,8/22/2017,"I came in for drinks only and had a fun time. The decor of the bar is pretty simple and features a lot of wood for a pretty clean look. I gotta say, the cocktails were very strong (and I like that). I tried out a ginger string, which did not overdo the ginger. The people with me went for the espresso martini and they liked them.All in all, we had fun, but did not experience anything that stood out.

Happy hour can be tricky since there's usually no place to sit hard to stand since the set up doesn't allowed for much open space u just need to make the most of it. If your lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar it's much easier to get drinks & service standing around takes twice as long since it's hard to go over people. They offer a few good happy hour specials bottle beer have tried the Bud light not my first choice but good during happy hour.My friend usually sticks to Jack & diet not bad. Yuengling beer on draft is decent not bad for $5 dollars. Nice place good amount of seating upstairs if u can get a table below is another area for private events. Decent happy hour specials, good size bar & service is not too bad good place to just hang & grab a few drinks.",7,4,4

34,Robert L.,"Portsmouth, NH",2,27,5,2.0,2/3/2018,"We were here because we wanted some quick comfort food and libations close to our hotel after set-up at trade show.  It was very early on a Saturday night yet the place smelled like stale beer spilt from the previous night.  The food was just OK. Three of us had the Cobb salad which was large and fresh, but another had the cheese fondue which was melted Velveeta.  The fifth had a chicken with mushroom dish. It was average and too salty. They had a decent draft selection including Yuengling. It was the best deal of the night at $5.  The drinks otherwise were expensive ($12-20) and were mediocre as was the service.I might have given this place a conciliatory three stars but they added a 20% tip to the bill automatically.  I guess five is a 'group'. I am normally a generous tipper but like to choose how much to give. In the end, five of us had a very simple set of meals and one drink each and the bill was $220 for five including tip.The five of us ate the night before at a fabulous restaurant a few blocks away called Mercato on 39th. It was really good and a huge step above the Houndstooth.

I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was great.  The roll was toasty and there was lots of BBQ sauce on the pork.  The fries were good as well - crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The coleslaw was lack luster, but it didn't matter.

Thought I would grab something small to munch on while waiting. I wasn't going to drink anything alcohol-related before said appointment and instead asked for a glass of water as I perused their food menu.When the bartender asked me what I would be drinking I said just water would be fine and when he asked if I'd be ordering food I said I was killing some time and still looking at the menu for what I would get to eat - unless you have selective hearing, this implies that I am planning on ordering food...his response was, ""that's not was the bar is for"". Yeahhhh...okie, I decided to hop on out of there grateful that the bartender was rude *before* I spent money there rather than after.This is a craptacular bar in a rather craptacular neighborhood.

46,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,615,558,2.0,12/16/2015,"""Gonna skip this place""I visited Houndstooth Pub to catch up with some friends. With its proximity to the arm-pit of NYC (aka Penn Station), it is a great location to meet up with friends from out of town. I will say that the service was annoying and the food was not that great. We will start with the service: It seems that the waiters were extremely pushy in getting me to order food. I was the first to arrive to meet my group and I wanted to wait until they (or another person, at least) arrived before ordering food. This seemed a little weird to me because the bar had just opened, so it was not like anyone was waiting for a table. However, I did order a beer. *I don't mind drinking in the absence of company.*  I think the waiter asked me on THREE separate occasions if I wanted food, while I waited for my friends to arrive. When we finally ordered food and drinks (especially drinks), we had to asked the staff a couple of times remove the empty plates and glasses. I thought it was common sense that if you bring a new round of drinks then you should take the used glasses. Ok, the food was mediocre at best. I was really excited for the seafood bisque BEFORE I put the spoon in my mouth. It was the grossest seafood bisque that I have ever tasted and there was not much seafood in the bisque. I will say that the appetizers are decent and there was an aggressive (in a good way) happy hour special.  I would only recommend this place if you are meeting friends for drinks or BEFORE going to another restaurant.",6,1,1

The hostess first told us to go downstairs and find a place at the bar even though we told her we would prefer a table as we wanted to get food along with our drinks. When we came back up and told her there was no room and wanted a table she said to just give her a second. She then proceeded to seat THREE other parties that arrived after us! She admitted that she just ""gave away"" our table right in front of her as she didn't make it clear she wanted all parties (3 different groups of people) waiting for a table to follower her downstairs. After she gave an insincere apology she proceed to seat another party who arrived after us at an open table. We were left to try and squeeze into the corn of the bar.

I was concerned that it would be packed because of the Connor fight that night and the New York Rangers playing. It was kind of busy but not too bad. We managed the get a couple seats at the bar. Now I know when in New York everything is super expensive. We got here and it was happy hour until close which was 10p - I think 1 (too lazy to check). Either way they have $5 pitchers of the beer of the day, $8 sangria and cocktails and $7 glasses of wine. These are normal prices where I come from but here they're happy hour steals which you'd know is true because I paid $18 for a cocktail the night before.The bartender was super cool though. I got a Moscow mule with bourbon (Call that a Kentucky Mule back home) and a Sangria. The wife got two sangrias and they were strong! She let me get Makers bourbon and kept the price the same.

So I go talk to the "" manager"", he tells that if there is a tab open in a table you can't pay in the bar so he has to leave , I thought this was very stupid and laughed , he told all of us to leave . Then On top he wanted the tip ( I work in restaurants for 8 years ), I told him no way , and he replied ""fuck off"" to me and to 2 of my friends .We then had a laugh about it , and moved on .

Walked in for a drink with a co-worker during happy hour, and was practically ignored by the bartenders even though the place was mostly empty. Noticed everyone else, who happened to be white, receiving prompt and friendly service. After we finally ordered drinks from a waitress who looked like she'd just drawn the short straw on who would wait on us, we spent a few minutes chatting before deciding to spend the rest of our time elsewhere and asked for the check. When the waitress finally made her way back around with the bill, she proceeded to toss it on the table and walk away. It was more than obvious we were not welcomed there, and I have a strong feeling that the behavior of the staff is not only tolerated, but possibly encouraged as a way to keep certain types of people away.Midtown is full of great bars & pubs..if you're a person of color, I recommend saving your coin and spending it anywhere else but here.",,,

The food is always fresh and the quality high. The upper eating area is similar to a Fridays with photos on the wall and a central bar but at a more sophisticated level. The lower area we ate at two times when the upper was full and the service was the same although you may feel far away from the crowd the service was just fine. Someone wrote about stale air but none of us noticed that and my wife is very particular about the atmosphere and cleanliness and that was never in question.I love the rosemary sandwiches with either grilled chicken or vegetables, the bread is fantastic and the quantity of food is excellent as the price which is no more than your average long island restaurant of similar status.My wife likes the vegetable dishes and daughter the shepherds pie.

Unfortunately, its location is the only thing to recommend it. Every time I've come here, I have had poor service and mediocre-at-best food (and it's definitely on the expensive side for a pub.) However, what prompted me to write this review was my last visit a few nights ago. I was there with some friends and we split the bill. Most of us used cash and one of us asked to put a specific amount on that card. Well, that person just found out that her card was actually run twice, and it wasn't accidental - the second amount was for a different (much larger amount.) When she called the restaurant to ask about how this can be fixed, she was told that no manager was there right now (is a restaurant ever open without a manger there??) and that it was casual and she should calm down. I'm sorry, that's not how you should speak to someone that your business has wrongfully taken money from.I have never liked coming here, but in the future I will actively tell people to avoid this place.",1,,

97,Eric S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,1,3.0,3/4/2017,"Good solid pub food spot, I go often because I live across the street and the prices are reasonable but it's really nothing that special at all. My favorite thing is the steak sandwich, very tasty. The service is fine from the waitstaff but they will definitely slow down there service for drinks if your eating there as it approaches end of happy hour I noticed or wait until it's over to go to your table if you come in 10 mins left of happy hour. Which is annoying especially since I don't usually order happy hour drinks anyway so it's just inconvenient and obnoxious. And what's really obnoxious is the club like security they have at the door, I mean come on. It's a pub. I'm pretty sure it has to do with race because the host and the bouncer will stop you at the door and make you show Id just to go in and eat even after you say that your coming to eat and want a table and not just going to the bar. After me and my friend said we'll show it to the wait staff if we choose to drink with our meal the host said, and I quote ""we'll I will not give you guys any drink menu so you won't be able to order unless you show your id's rite now."" May I add that me and my friend are both in our thirties and I feel it has to do with race because after the rude encounter, we watched as we were eating throughout our meal and they are very selective of who they id. If your white, let's just say you won't have any issues and can literally walk right in over to the bar no questions asked.   I really don't know what there trying to go for, I literally come in to get some food and some drinks if I feel BECAUSE I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET,  in the middle of the day on a week day. It's not a late night, weekend, club hop Party spot. So you should really cut out the attitude. Unless of course.

We arrived at the pub at about noon, and were instantly greeted with smiles as we sat at the bar. I'm giving 4 stars because the drinks were strong and the food was great, but a bit pricey for what it was. We spent $70, on two beers, two drinks, a burger, and fish and chips. The drinks were priced pretty reasonably, but the food was what was expensive. $20 each for two meals at lunch time seems a bit crazy. We would have surely came back for happy hour but we never made it back before we left. For what it is, it's a beautiful and affordable bar. I wouldn't recommend the food though.",,1,

108,Kaplan A.,"Queens, NY",118,18,7,1.0,10/1/2015,"Pretty pissed about my experience at this bar. The thing is, my experience while there was fine, it's what happened in the post experience. I luckily glanced at my credit card statement the two days later and noticed that I was charged $58 for 3 drinks. I called them up and told them I think I was over charged. I asked how much the three drinks I order cost. I was told $27. So, why was I charged $58? I usually tip $1 per drink so my bill should be $30 total. When the manager called me back, he found my slip and said that I tipped $31, not three. I'm calling bullsh*t. Why would I write $31 for a tip!? It was a very straightforward transaction, nothing special. The only difference is that I didn't take my receipt and left it in the check book. Extremely sketchy. Customer leaves a less than 15% bill in a touristy area and leaves the receipts behind. Very easy for the bartender to add a 1 to the total for tip especially if I didn't fill out the total. The manager did refund the difference and claimed it was an honest mistake...on my behalf. Doesn't fix my review and I'm still suspicious. The lesson here: Take your receipts with you and ensure the fields are filled out completely or your server/bartender could try to take advantage",5,,

I sat at the bar where the service was fine and attentive enough. Plenty of seating here and the tables are far enough apart where it's actually roomy. Large horseshoe shaped bar with plenty of seating around it too. There is also a downstairs level but I did not venture there.

116,Brian B.,"Verona, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,3/22/2017,"Date of visit: 3/19/2017Time on check:  3:24pmOrder number:  51099Normally, I don't really write any reviews.  Having spent years as a server and/or bartender, I try my hardest to understand and remember that the life of restaurant people can leave you beat up.  Also, quite frankly, everyone has bad days.  Normally, I would never have dreamed of giving a place a bad review on yelp (I try to be positive in all of my day to day existence).  Regardless, this past Sunday, my father, my girlfriend and myself went into Houndstooth for lunch after an afternoon activity in the city.  The food itself wasn't bad (the parts that were input correctly), but the service was all out atrocious.  As we sat for a good 15 minutes before being ""greeted"", we decided to browse the menu.  Our delightful server, whos name starts with D, greeted us with a very lukewarm welcome of ""drinks"".  This is actually what he said as he walked up to our table.  The word drinks.  Not a question.  Just the word.  Fine.  Some servers suck.  Understood.  No one at the table spoke of this and continued our ordering as normal.  Almost 15 minutes later our delightful server, whose name starts with d and kind of sounds like walton, returned with our sodas and placed them down and walked away.  We than saw him take off his apron as he walked around the bar towards the door.  Another 10 minutes later he returned and took our order (which was royally messed up).  My father asked his recommendation.  When my father ordered a sandwich instead, dalton chose to put in his personal recommendation instead.  Our server, who may think his tattooed hands and flippy hair look edgy or cool, was incapable of writing down any of our requests.  For instance, I got balsambic instead of ranch.  My sandwich was missing the cheese (I'm assuming this is the kitchens fault).  One of our sandwiches received mozzarella instead of the requested swiss.  The salad contained the single ingredient that we specified there was an allergy to.  After dropping off our entrees, our server disappeared before recognizing 6 empty glasses on the table (3 sodas and 3 waters).  I had actually started to ask for a refill when he was already halfway across the bar with his apron in his one hand and a pack of cigarettes in the other hand.  He never came back.  Almost 20 minutes later, we asked a busboy for assistance who grabbed a female server who explained that our young hip server was on a ""break"" - she actually used airquotes.  When I inquired as to which of them would get our tip, she explained that the restaurant makes their servers pool (combine and split among workers).  While I never want awful service, it made sense now.  Why would this terrible server bother trying to do a good job in the greatest restaurant city in the world when he can come in, do a pathetic job and still get his portion of the money.  Much like communism, there is no incentive for anyone in this place to do anything even remotely above and beyond (or even mediocre in his case), because they all just combine and split.  It is completely obvious why there is no going above and beyond hoping for an extra $5 or $10 per table at the end of the night.  All in all, the food was ok (what came out correctly).  The service of our friend was pathetic and quite frankly, I understand why (I still dropped a 25% tip for their ""pool"" because I can imagine how awful it could be to work there).  I have no reason to ever come back here and even though I am frequently in the area, I will bring my groups elsewhere.",2,1,1

An unreasonable sense of self entitlement, he doesn't even ask if we want another drink for 15 minutes after my first round is finished. Industry standards? Young and unexperienced bartenders have better bar and work ethic at college bars around Syracuse and literally worst bars in East Village.

Houndstooth has a relaxing atmosphere. It's not a bar where you get rowdy, it's a place to wind down after work. The waiters are also friendly and attentive. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends.",,,1

Yuengling, Brooklyn lager, Bud, Coors, Stella, Sams Winter Ale. I looked for a second set of taps but the view across the bar was blocked.Very nicely appointed place.  Background music was interesting, nothing too loud.  Did not try the menu.",,,

159,Shawn C.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",296,299,202,3.0,10/22/2014,"Houndstooth Pub is, simply put, as run-of-the-mill as run-of-the-mill gets. It's an A-OK establishment sitting in the wonderful world of the Garment District (e.g. tourist swampland) that features strangely overpriced drinks coupled with a very Irish vibe. The space is large and there's a ton of seats at the bar. Seating probably will not ever be an issue here-- they boast two floors with tons of standing / sitting room. One nice perk is that the tables are spaced far enough apart that you can probably hold a conversation without having every other person in the establishment eavesdropping on you. In regards to the munchies-- I've only ever sampled the chicken tenders here, and they were pretty okay. I wasn't expecting to be blown away and they pretty much delivered on that. They have your typical bar foods here.Standard drink selection with your usual area upscale. Cocktails, beers, wines, sangria-- so on and so on. Nothing special. You pay extra to have drinks in this area, I guess.Service is hit or miss. Some of the bartenders are nice, the others are swimming in a sea of misery. I had to laugh at the one time if I was interested in another round, and upon responding that I would revisit the decision in a couple minutes I received a pretty epic disappointed look as a response-- not much of a motivator to continue drinking here...Personally I feel there are better bars just mere blocks away from this spot. But this is an okay, spacious decision if you only plan on grabbing a round or two and killing some time.",,,

I ordered the shepherds pie and my wife got the fish and chips. The fish and chips were excellent, the fish was hot and crispy served with great French fries. We only wished that the portion of fish may have been slightly larger with less fries.

Although it's pretty loud and relatively crowded for a later-ish time on a Saturday night, it was easy enough to get seated. The service was okay, and the food came out relatively quickly. I stuck with the burger, which is a huge patty (12 ounces) that will fill you up right. It's pretty standard from a flavor perspective, and you get served fries on the side that are mediocre and relatively flavorless. The beer selection is also pretty unimpressive, and it does feel like the booze is priced a little high given you're at a pretty standard bar and grill area.For regular food, I would stop by again - you definitely get your money's worth for a $15 burger, but I would imagine there have to be bars around that have better selection and might be a little bit cheaper. All in all, it's pretty much your standard joint. By the time we headed out (which was not too long before midnight), it was starting to quiet down as people headed out to their ultimate destination for the evening.",,,

We brought it to the servers attention and he took it to the kitchen. He then returned with the slider and stated it was jalapeño bread. He asked us if we still wanted it! Maybe I missed it but we didn't see anything on the menu stating the buns had jalapeños on them. It was just frustrating because there was no apology and no offer to bring us a fresh slider.

The pastry on top was light and flaky, which I liked (I think it was made with phyllo dough). The filling, consisting of cubed chicken, green peas, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a cream sauce was ok; it was too creamy for my taste and I needed to add salt and pepper. A couple of colleagues ordered a burger, which came with steak fries. I sampled a fry and it was delicious.  It was hot and crispy. I would definitely  recommend an order of steak fries.",2,,1

I had a 6:30 reservation because the concert was at 8:00. We had put in our order for two hamburgers by 6:45. At 7:15 our food had not yet arrived and I asked the waitress how much longer since we had a show at 8:00. She apologized and said they were a little backed up because they had a party on the lower level and were also busy because of the concert. By 7:30 when our food had still not arrived I told her I needed to cancel the order, she said ""let me just check to see if they're done"" she came back and said she was sorry but it was not ready. I asked her if I could be comped for the two glasses of wine I had and she said absolutely. So although I appreciate the comp we never received our food and needless to say we went to the concert hungry. My question is this...how long does it take to grill two burgers? I believe not that long. If you know you are going to be busy because of an event at the Garden then you really should not be booking a party for the same night if you can't handle it. Extremely disappointed and would never go there again and would definitely never recommend it to anyone",1,,

193,Geoff Y.,"New York, NY",63,173,14,4.0,1/3/2013,"This is a good place to stop in for a bite and a drink, but only if you go at the right time. Like the others have said, it's a tourist spot, being in such close proximity to Times Square, MSG/Penn Station and Hell's Kitchen (let's face it, the latter is a far cry from what it used to be). The key is to come while/after the tourists are otherwise occupied, like around 10pm or so. By then, they're all gone, and it's just the locals left who are on their way home after work, looking for a quiet drink. Do note that if you do visit during the rush, it gets very crowded and it's not a good place for groups even if you have reserved a table.A friend and I stopped in after we got out of the Phish concert early (they were good, but the atmosphere was a little, shall we say, dry). Prices are what you'd expect for a tourist area, but if you work in the area, you're used to it. Visiting later in the night on a Friday will yield some menu items no longer being available (like the fried calamari), so stick with the staples like potatoes or onions if you're looking for some bar food to go with your drink.My friend went for a mixed drink and I a scotch that night (Balvenie 12, if you were curious), which the bartender served up in short order. She was very calm, cool, and didn't bother us unnecessarily, like some others are wont to do. A note on the scotch list: I was happy to see they have the Glenmorangie 10, as it's something I don't often see in other places. Another note if you were wondering: I don't recall seeing Johnnie on there, so that may give you an indication of to whom this bar is geared towards. Judging from the offerings, you go for the liquor or mixed drinks more than the beer.Overall, not bad. It makes you think of an English bar, even if you've never been to that side of the pond. It's a good place for a drink or two, but not for a bender (unless you're on the corporate tab, in which case have at it).",1,,
194,Dawn R.,"Arnold, MD",157,637,138,2.0,12/17/2012,"I was in New York with some friends on a day trip, we were looking for someplace where we could actually sit down and get out of the weather for a little while, and this was the first place we found.  I wish we'd just kept walking about 5 more minutes, or at least that I'd read the Yelp reviews FIRST (lesson learned!).   It looked nice from the outside, and we were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, so we were off to a good start.  The interior was cozy, with lots of dark wood accents.  But once we were seated, that's where things went downhill.  It took forever for our server to acknowledge us, and once she did we quickly discovered that they were out of just about everything on their menu.    If you have a brunch menu and advertise that you serve brunch until 4pm, and if mimosa is supposed to be included with the brunch, how do you run out of champagne before 1:00, especially when you supposedly have a ""full bar""?   Or even better.....when one of the staples on your menu for ANY time, not just brunch, is your carving board ham, HOW do you run out of ham to make a ham & cheese omelette?   But moving on.....I decided to go with the Manchester sandwich, which the server said was one of their best sellers.  Advertised as a marinated grilled chicken breast served with homemade fresh mozzarella on a rosemary bun with olive mayo and sweet potato fries on the side, it sounded pretty tasty.  Sadly, the only thing with any flavor at all was the bread.  The chicken was thin, dry, and totally absent of flavor.   My dining companions opted for a bacon & cheese omelette (after being told they were out of ham) and the angus hamburger.  The fact that they both said their food was good is the only reason this place got a second star from me.  Especially considering that once our food was delivered, our server never came back to check on us, refill our water, and even completely neglected to bring the lemon we requested at all.  We had to flag her down just to get the check, and then had to wait nearly 15 minutes for her to bring it.  And the place wasn't even that busy.  Like I said, I wish I'd just kept walking another 5 minutes.  I won't make the same mistake twice.",1,,

They had a special holiday menu and I wanted to get something somewhat related to Irish cuisine, so I chose the Chicken Pot Pie. I was apprehensive because I had no idea what it was going to taste like, but I'm so glad I took the chance. It came in an oblong casserole dish as a cream sauce with chunks of quality chicken and vegetables. This wasn't actually a pie as the contents was in the dish which was topped with 2 flaky croissant-like shamrock shaped pieces to dip with. It was deliciously yummy!! A pleasant surprise for sure and a creative way to commemorate the day. The atmosphere was fun and friendly. The service was great and it wasn't too crowded or rowdy. Although there was one really drunk guy who kept trying to sneak in much the chagrin of the bouncers at the door. He was eventually forcibly removed but there was no scene or unnecessary roughness. We were only privy because we were seated near the entrance. The Houndstooth may not have been the most trendy or rowdy bar to go with on St. Patty's Day but it definitely did not disappoint in the most important areas: food, service, and fun.",2,2,3
