0,Deana B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",343,102,296,5.0,11/20/2018,"It is quite rare that I am out on a Monday, let alone out on a Monday after 11:00pm. So when I was in need of a non-Irish pub in the area that was open late, my boyfriend suggested Haswell Green's to grab a cocktail and catch up with my cousin. I am so glad he made the recommendation because Haswell's is awesome. This place was bumpin' on a Monday night with incredible live music. Since I was there to catch up with my cousin after all, we didn't want to be too close to the band so that we could hold a conversation without screaming over the music. We were able to sit toward the back of the bar and it was perfect. As far as the drinks go, they are really good here and reasonably priced. Cocktails are $15, wine is $12 and beer varies depending on the size and type. The bartenders are friendly and the vibe of this place is just really fun and chill. I would definitely suggest Haswell's if you're either looking for live music or if you're looking for a solid cocktail bar in the area. It may be a little loud for parents but I would recommend Haswell's for drinks with co-workers, drinks/dancing with friends or for a fun date.",1,,1
1,Beth R.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,1,5.0,11/4/2018,"Five years ago, I was in a small town in Ireland for work and decided to go out one night to find some live music. At that time, I wasn't very comfortable going to bars by myself, but I wanted to make the most of the opportunity and stretch myself out of my comfort zone. After indecisively wandering around town for a half hour, I finally stepped into a pub near my hotel and sat at the bar. And I'm really grateful that I did, because that's where I met a fantastic bartender named Trevor. Sure, he could pour a great pint, but he was also so welcoming and helpful, and his warm and thoughtful presence put me at ease and really made the visit memorable to me.Nowadays, Ireland's loss is NYC's gain -- Trevor now tends bar at Haswell Green's. During a recent work trip, I stopped by before and after a Broadway show. The space itself is beautiful, and the live band was talented and fun. I tried several of the Broadway-themed cocktails, and they were all amazing and also Instagram-worthy.But since that Ireland trip, I've traveled solo quite a bit, and I've realized that no matter what bar you go to, the caliber of bartender can make or break your experience. And Trevor is still one of best bartenders -- and human beings -- I've met in my years of travel near and far. He's attentive, friendly, makes a fantastic drink, and has a super charming Irish accent. What else could you want in a bartender?!But seriously -- I highly recommend getting a drink at Haswell Green's to anyone, but to solo travelers in particular. There's a large bar, it's a lovely and lively environment, and you will be well taken of.",1,1,
2,Lori M.,"Milwaukee, WI",263,309,268,5.0,9/24/2018,"Oh,​ What a Night!  We stopped by after seeing Wicked (short walk about a block and a half).  We had a late dinner reservation and we were seated right away.  I was not expecting live music on a Thursday night so we lucked out with top-notch entertainment (more on this later).I would describe the restaurant bar as warm industrial.  I didn't go upstairs but there was another floor that looked onto the stage/dance floor.The wine was good.....the mixed drinks were good and the service was friendly.  Because it was so late, we opted to share appetizers instead of full-blown meals.  Everything came out hot, fast and tasty!Onto the entertainment....so MUCH fun!  The band that was playing was called The Big Woozy Band and they were phenomenal​.  We ended up staying and dancing until​ the wee​e hours of the morning.  I honestly would travel to see this band, they were that talented.We will definitely be stopping back by Haswell Green's when visitng NYC.",4,1,3
3,Julie W.,"New York, NY",248,68,65,5.0,7/10/2018,"If you enjoy live music, cotton candy mixed with tequila and rosé, and a beautiful yet cozy ambiance, Haswell Green's is the place for you. Had a blast at their grand opening a few weeks back. The bartenders/servers were great and the atmosphere was incredible. The cocktails are definitely creative and will make your night. Did I mention the food? Delicious. It was hard to leave. While I'm not in this area all too often, I know it won't be long before I'm back.",3,3,2
4,Mel T.,"New York, NY",415,1212,2872,5.0,7/4/2018,"I recently got to experience Haswell's Green's grand opening event (thanks, Yelp!) To be honest, I wasn't sure of what to expect of this place - especially with their big green sign outside. It looked like it would be just another pub. But this is one of those 'don't judge a book by its cover' situations. Inside, the space is beautiful. It reminded me of an old British person's living room: kind of a regal, Shakespeare-esque feel (but with live music).I thought their Mean Girls themed cocktails were clever since the Mean Girls Broadway show was right across the street. I tried the 'Pink on Wednesdays' (rye, pink grapefruit, raspberry, lime), which I thought was only okay. It was expertly made though. After that, I tried the Chianti (Florentia Chianti Reserva) that they had and I really enjoyed it. I had the change to try a few small bites, including the smoked chicken wings, some kind of biscuit with these really amazing aioli-type sauce, and a chicken taco. Everything was great. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes!",3,2,4
5,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,5.0,6/29/2018,"I came here after being chosen to attend a Yelp Elite event on a Tuesday. The deal was that there would be complimentary drinks and food for 2 hours. I brought my friend along with me and we had an amazing time! I will say that even though the drinks are pricey (or I guess normal for this area), they definitely pack a punch. Since they were complimentary and I wanted to try as many as possible (I blame my friend for suggesting this), I got pretty drunk; fun-drunk, not sloppy-drunk... well, not until the end of the night, at least (I may or may not have fallen out of my chair...).The band is great and seem to adapt to any style of music; they're really talented! They also take requests via little cards placed in a bucket by the stage (although they didn't honor my very drunken request for Bodak Yellow). Everyone was dancing and we had so much fun! The bartenders are really cool and we didn't have to wait a long time to order. The food I tried was good but didn't get to have a lot as other people had taken it first. I'd love to come back and try more dishes. Even though this place is a bit pricey, it's definitely worth it for the experience. It seems to be pretty lit any day of the week, too!",2,,1
6,Greg J.,"Bronx, NY",272,55,464,5.0,6/20/2018,"5 Stars! I went there for the opening and had a fantastic time. The first floor has a bar, restaurant area, dance area, and live music band! The 2nd floor has a bar, group seating, gorgeous lounge chair, and a view of 52nd street as well as the first floor. At the event, we were treated to everything from deviled eggs(that looked like a nest) to a myriad of pizzas. They were small personals that looked  great but left something to be desired. A lot of space was just bread.The part where they really shine is their cocktails. Really creative drinks; they have a fantastic combination of ingredients that include the likes of popcorn washed bourbon and cotton candy! Believe it or not, they taste as good as they look. The only drink that needs a revision is probably their Wicked Mule; their take on a brandy mule. They have 8 signature cocktails in all. My favorite was probably their ""That's So Fetch Cocktail"". I mean...how can you not choose a drink made with fresh cotton candy. A close second for taste was the ""Pink on Wednesday"" (delish); the close second for aestetics was The Silver Screen popcorn cocktail!Lastly, there is the music. The house cover band was amazing. I listened to Linkin Park, Prince, Greenday, Usher, Ginuwine, and many more artist's songs. The musicians were so talented as well. They hit high notes, played multiple instruments (sometimes simultaneously!), and even had guitar solos. They took request on a card and it did not take long for the dance party to start. Everyone looked like they were having an amazing time down there.Overall, great for dates, groups, and an overall good time! I'd come back.",3,1,1
7,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",58,132,516,5.0,6/20/2018,"Here I Go Here I Go Again - What's My Weakness??I don't know if it's food, decor, or just plain live music!!!!Yesssss, Haswell Green's made an impression yesterday. Presentation wise the spread on their offerings left my tastebuds jumping. My favorite appetizer was the deviled eggs. It was not like any deviled egg I'd had before. Everyone has a take on deviled eggs these days. From dying them pink to everything else. In the case of Haswell Green's it's like a toasted egg with a solid yoke and something I'm beyond words for as the filling - and it's not boring.  You'll simply have to try for yourself. It's delicious, has texture, and it's #hatapproved.  I'm not one for public restrooms but their restrooms are neat and tidy - showcasing full length mirrors in the Ladies's room, Myers Clean Day Lavender hand soap, a Dyson hand dryer, and look up in the sky the ceiling is covered in antique pineapple wallpaper. Did you know a pineapple  meant ""welcome""? I suppose many pineapples mean you are very welcomed.  The Decor is eye catching - there are two floors. However their main floor is where the magic happens.  Live Music. It's like a jukebox - but in person. You can write your request and the band will play your request. Debbie Rocks!!!!The second floor is more intimate with a petit indoor terrace. Perfect for private parties.  This is a must on your list.  I had a blast. The service and staff is exceptional. A special thank you to Farrah.  I got to make cotton candy and there's a cotton candy drink that's all the rage.Whoop Whoop - Haswell Green's & Wonderful Thank You to your Entire Team!!!!  I'm Green With Envy!It's just a simple kind of elegance that reminds you of something special from childhood - but remember you're adulting now. This is for the grownup side of you.",2,,1
8,Akshata T.,"New York, NY",28,78,157,3.0,6/22/2018,"I  surprised that this place is not jam packed on Friday evening! They have great live band (Imperial Cities), the cocktails are slightly watered down and the food is acceptable. Its a fresh new decor, very spacious with a crazy huge bar.",2,,
9,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,6/23/2018,"When I got to know through yelp about this place opening up in our neighborhood I was so excited! All our favorite places, Tanners Smith, vida verde, Dutch Fred's , all owned by the same group!  I couldn't get in to the event, but at the first chance I got, I visited the place for drinks. I like how spacious they have made this place to be. There's a huge bar in the center with seating all around. They had tables set up even upstairs. There is a stage set up at the back with space in front for people who want to dance. They played live music after 10. Really good artists. They handed out a paper for giving your requests. We tried a couple of different cocktails and they were all really good. I didn't try the food as yet but I will surely come back for food. Even though the place wasn't as crowded, but am sure as more and more people get to know about this place, it's going to be hard to even get in! This is surly to be one happening spot in the area.!",1,,2
10,Gloria J.,"New York, NY",278,120,254,5.0,6/4/2018,"Had to meet my friends in the city, and I heard about this place from Vida Verde, a place I go to often. I really didn't expect much from the place as it is in between bright musical neon signs. Wow, this place is great!Pro- the interior is so pretty. Very romantic and cozy. Reminded us of Catch.- very spacious. They were able to accommodate 8 of us.- not too crowded, where you hear every other conversation in the room.- our server, Danny was so professional and attentive. - their cocktails are great. Our whole group got to try out all their signature cocktails and were able to find a cocktail they liked. I also tried the Mai Tai that wasnt on their menu and it was so refreshing.- their breakfast pizza is a MUST! Egg on a pizza is very yummyCon- tbh, my friends and I had a great time. If I find something, will update review",3,,2
11,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,5.0,6/25/2018,"What an amazing addition to the theatre district! I came to Haswell Green's and will probably never go anywhere else pre or post theatre ever again. The interior is beyond stunning. Two floors full of ornate vintage feeling furniture, old NYC photos and maps on the wall and more. It is simply gorgeous. From the top floor you can look down over a large balcony to watch the band below. For Broadway geeks like me this place was heaven. The top floor overlooks Broadway theaters, and there are several show themed cocktails on the menu including ""That's So Fetch"" a ""Wicked Mule"". That's So Fetch is a cocktail that comes with cotton candy which melts down when you pour your drink over it. It was a delightful blend of Tequila, Lillet, and passion fruit. It was far less sweet than expected. The Silver Screen cocktail comes with a tiny bucket of popcorn pinned to the side. The attention to detail here adding that extra special touch goes above and beyond. You can't go wrong with the food here as well. Everything is priced really affordably and is beautifully presented. The pizza is amazing as was the burrata,  bacon wrapped meatballs and wood fired rainbow carrots. The band played a bunch of show tunes and covers and was incredibly talented. I'm excited to spend more time here and try more of the amazing food options and cocktails.",1,,
12,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",177,136,573,4.0,7/13/2018,Came for cocktails ($14) around 8-9pm on a Wednesday. Was anticipating live music but the stage was empty. There weren't many people in the bar so it wasn't crowded. I really wanted to try the cocktail that comes with popcorn but accidentally ordered something different. I ordered the curtain call and my boyfriend had the wicked mule. I'm usually not a gin fan but the lemonade covered most of the taste. Their cocktails definitely run sweet. A fun place with cute drinks. Might come back with my girl friends.,,,
13,Elle S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,2,5.0,10/30/2018,Giant bar with a cozy feel. Attentive bartenders and fun drinks (I got the Curtain Call). Live music. What's not to love??,,,
14,Mark T.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,2,5,5.0,10/26/2018,"I absolutely love this place. It was on a Thursday night, great clientele and great drinks got me started, then I decided to stay for dinner and had a margarita pizza that was delicious! Then the band started and I had a couple more drinks and ended up not wanting to go anywhere else. Great service, I highly recommend this place.",,,
15,Candace A.,"Manhattan, NY",187,173,631,5.0,7/16/2018,"Fantastic upscale Irish bar centrally located in midtown.  I met my friend here one evening after work and was pleasantly surprised to see a new bar (it's only been opened about two months) with an open atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent food/drinks.  Our bartender Mike was superb and gave us the whole history  behind ""Haswell Green' and the overall concept of the bar which was really interesting.  The specialty cocktails and brick oven pizza were absolutely wonderful.  If you're looking for a nice (not typical midtown pub) place for happy hour with one or 20 of your friends, or even a quick drink/bite before a show, Haswell Green's is definitely the spot.",1,,2
16,Chris G.,"New York, NY",20,139,386,5.0,6/19/2018,"I had the pleasure of visiting Haswell Green's on the night of their Grand Opening. I received a notification from the Yelp crew inquiring if I would like to attend; thankfully my work schedule lined up perfectly with this event! I'm so glad I got to try H.G. and experience them at their best. First impressions: A hostess greeted us at the main entrance and directed us upstairs to their reserved bar area. I got a glimpse of the lower level which featured a stage for a live band, dance floor and ample seating. Above, there is a view of the live band with a wrap around bar perfect for resting your drinks while enjoying the live music. There was a a beautiful spread of every item on the menu! The selection is scrumptious to say the least. They offer everything from pizza, sliders, salad and wings. I really enjoyed a chicken and bacon sandwich that was served on toasted bread and packed with flavor! I should have eaten the other half but I had much more to try. The staff were busy bustling around serving guests samples of everything they had to offer for this Yelp event. The drinks were top notch and potent just how I like them. I felt a buzz after the second drink so I knew they were working. I got the chance to try all the cocktails on the menu and all of them were great. My favorites were the Wicked Mule & Pink on Wednesday's (love the Mean Girls References).It was great to be apart of such a lively night celebrating the opening of another great dining spot in the city. I look forward to visiting here often with friends and family for drinks and good food. Thank you Yelp for making this night possible and thank you Haswell's staff for great service and food! See you soon.",6,3,4
17,Alexander A.,"New York, NY",23,58,140,4.0,6/23/2018,"Overall - Amazing atmosphere and house band, but food and drinks could be betterWhat I got - thats so fetch, the silver screen, wicked mule, pink on Wednesday, green with envy, smoked chicken wings, pretzel balls, and pizzaTaste - hit or miss; thats so fetch was a really enjoyable drink that gets poured into a glass with cotton candy. The cotton candy melts and gives the drink the perfect amount of sweetness. The silver screen is a whiskey drink that was my favorite. It is served with large square ice cubes and a small side of popcorn clipped to the side of the glass. What I really enjoyed about this was as you sip it you smell the buttery popcorn and it's an extremely enjoyable experience. Pink on Wednesday was an ok drink, nothing great but nothing bad. Green with envy was nice and had a slice of cucumber. I feel like it could have been better though. The wicked mule was not good. It tasted like the bartender made it wrong. Didn't taste the ginger beer or much of the apple. The flavors were muted and i was dissapointed. The chicken wings were pretty good. They had a nice smokey flavor and were tender. The sourdough pretzel balls were just ok. The pizza was the last thing I had and I don't remember it very well, but I do remember thinking that it wasn't that great for the price.Value - average, the food and drinks are about average for the area. The food is disappointing for the cost unless you factor in the value of the entertainment.Service - great, the bartenders knew their menu well and were able to make good recommendations. They seemed to be having fun and made the drinks fast.Atmosphere - Amazing; this place has a great young vibe (think mid 20s-late30s). However since it's located off broadway I could see older crowds stopping in before or after a show and enjoying themselves. Facility - Amazing; this is one of the coolest spaces I've been in. There are 2 floors. The bottom floor has a bar, tables for dining, a dance floor and a stage. The dance floor is big enough for ~30-40 people. This place has a house band that performs regularly and they are awesome. The upstairs is really cool because it is more like a lounge. It seems ideal for large groups probably 100 people if you want the whole floor. There is a balcony overlooking the street and tables to stand at. There are maybe 4 tables to sit at. There is a large bar upstairs with 3 bartenders. The best part about upstairs is the opening so that you can see the band and dance floor. It's ideal for people watching. There is a really cool looking couch and some nice lounge chairs if you are lucky. I really liked how this place was decorated too. Upstairs was also really good because the music was not too loud. You wont have to yell at the people you are with so the can hear you and you ears won't be ringing after you leave.Need to know - the band is amazing, they really got the dance floor moving and they will take requestsWould I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - YesAdditional info - this place is great for lounging around before or after a broadway show or if you just want some live music. However, I would recommend eating somewhere else if you have the option. The venue and band were about 5 stars and the food only 3 stars.",4,,
18,Varun J.,"Philadelphia, PA",589,38,10,5.0,6/20/2018,"Wow this place is really amazing. From accidentally googling the general Andrew Haswell Green to trying some of their aptly-named drinks, this place is an adventure. I went here for a Yelp event celebrating a Grand Opening of some sort. They have a nice view of the Broadway Theater on their balcony and the view inside is just plain gorgeous. I think the only thing I could have enjoyed more was some of their food offerings. I liked their fried deviled eggs and their tacos, but their sweet potato bread fell short of expectations and their wings aren't anything spectacular. However, the drinks were pretty interesting. There was a cotton candy machine that was served with tequila making for a really smooth flavor. Another one called the silver screen, was a nice chill whiskey with a little cute container with popcorn, simulating a movie screen and popcorn. The live music was really great and I even heard covers of Linkin Park's ""In The End"" and Smash Mouth's ""All-Star"". Overall was a great vibe and would consider coming here again!",1,1,2
19,Mike B.,"Phoenix, AZ",47,16,0,5.0,9/22/2018,My wife and I went to Haswell Green's following dinner on a Friday Night.  We love live music and Haswell's did not disappoint.  The band we saw played for three plus hours and they really knew how to work the crowd.  It was high energy and fun.  Bartenders were attentive and prices are reasonable.  We had wine and beer so I can't comment on mixed drinks.  The band was Imperial Cities.  We are already planning our return in two weeks when my sister in- law is in town.,1,,1
20,Amy R.,"Havre de Grace, MD",154,352,592,4.0,6/12/2018,"What a fabulous find right in the middle of the Theater District.  From the minute we sat down and were greeted by our server, our experience was excellent.  We tried the Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Carrots, and the Broccoli Rabe Pizza.  The carrots were served cold, which was a surprise, but had a fabulous flavor.  The pizza was the perfect size for sharing and cooked perfectly.  I was not a fan of the brussels sprouts- I prefer them crispy- but my friend loved them.",1,1,2

Fun live music with brilliant musicians, specifically the band ""imperial cities"". The management is very friendly and helpful with their staff as needed, they are also very hands on with interacting with customers to ensure a great experience. I've been twice, and both experiences have been truly pleasant and enjoyable. I love the pretzel bites and tacos and pizza. It would be a great space for happy hour if they offer it--I'm not sure they have a happy hour though. This may be my new favorite place.",1,,

26,Galit T.,"New York, NY",45,166,4,5.0,6/22/2018,"If you want a perfect night out, this is the place to do it.I was invited to an opening party and did not know what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised at how awesome this place was.The decor is awesome. Haswell Green really took on to carry on the theme of it's namesake by decorating the walls in old school New York City regalia and maps of his work galore. If you want to see something really impressive, just look up. It is absolutely beautiful and historical feeling while still being quite modern and trendy. They did an amazing job with it.The drinks are adorable and look very pretty.What really stood out was the food and the music. The food was insanely delicious. Two major stand outs for me: the yucca bread and the pizza. The bread was glorious. chewy to perception with cheese and a hint of heat. I could have (and maybe did) eaten a whole tray. The pizza was also outstanding. Being a native New Yorker, I am quite picky about my pizza but every slice I had (I had quite a few of the veggie option pizzas) was outrageous. Get these things. Trust me.The staff was super friendly and although it was crowded I never had to wait long for a drink.Now, the music was SO GOOD. The name of the band is Imperial Cities (again, great nod to the namesake), and they blew me away. It was something I was not expecting. Every member of the band was insanely talented and played every request from the audience...like...how did they do that?! And then the drummer became the singer and the singer became the drummer at some point and they rocked everything and I was just so impressed. I wanted to stay and listen all night, but it was a Tuesday and I have a job...so....If you're looking for  a really fun night out, you can't go wrong. Recommend it all the way.",,,1

We came in on a Saturday night. We were seated and greeted immediately. We came solely for the drinks so I can't speak so much on the food. There's a good mix of beer, wine and cocktails on the menu. Between the 2 of us, we got 3 Wicked Mules and 1 Silver Screen. They're about $14 each but we really enjoyed the flavors of each drink. There was a live band that night, which really made the atmosphere even livelier. The people who work here are awesome from the security to the hostess to the waitress.

It's a really big place with an upstairs bar that we gathered at. The bartenders are amazing. One of the best dirty martinis I've had. Great beers on tap. I ordered the brussel sprouts which were amazing. The only thing that wasn't 100% was the jerky plate. Instead of tasting like the meat that it was, it tasted like the refrigerator it was in. We couldnt stay for the live band but we saw the stage set up for it. Sorry to have missed the music so weI'll definitely be going back here!",1,,
36,Hillary M.,"Hoboken, NJ",184,29,11,3.0,6/8/2018,"I found this restaurant on Yelp when I was searching for a restaurant to go to before seeing a play at the August Wilson Theater across the street. I set my reservation for an hour and fifteen minutes before the play was to start. We got there and the hostess sat us, and asked us for our drink order as we were sitting down; she didn't even give me a chance to take my jacket off or look at the menu. I asked her to give us a few moments. Our waitress seemed very spacey and didn't know the menu very well when we were asking her about certain menu items. I know it's a fairly new restaurant, but know your menu. We started with the brussels sprouts and carrots which were pretty good, but took forever to come out of the kitchen. For a restaurant to be not only in the theater district, but right next to two different theaters where they have to know they'll be getting people who are eating before the show, the service and kitchen was extremely slow. We had to ask a manager if our food was almost ready because we needed to leave in 20 minutes for the show, and she said ""everyone here is going to the show so the kitchen is aware, your food should be right out"". We all ordered salads, so nothing crazy that needed a long time to prepare. We get the salads, which were all under main courses on the menu, not appetizers, and the plates were the size of an appetizer. My mom and sister got chicken on their salads, and there were 5 little cubes of chicken on top. For the price of the salads, as well as the fact that they were main course meals on the menu, the salads were very small. We all finished our food and were still hungry, but opted for the check so we could get to the show. We looked around for our waitress and it took us about 10 minutes to get the check.Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was cute, and if you have all the time in the world to dine, then this would be a good place. Their drinks were good, and maybe this is more of a ""let's grab a drink before the show"" kind of place rather than a sit down dinner. I'd find another restaurant to eat at in the area if you're seeing a show later that night.UPDATE:The manager and owner of Haswell Greens have reached out to me and assured that they are still working out some of the kinks and would like to make it up to me. I really appreciate how they took ownership of the issue and reached out to make it up to me; that's great customer service. Thank you Patrick and Mike for reaching out to me!",3,,

42,Kaitlyn K.,"New York, NY",152,11,6,5.0,5/27/2018,"Met up with a bunch of friends here on a Friday night after work recently and had a great time. I started with a delicious tequila cocktail (it involved cotton candy, need I say more?!) and then switched to Allagash for the rest of the night. While we didn't sit for a full dinner, the group of us split a few apps - everything I tried was excellent, the pizza was a favorite. The interior, especially upstairs, was very charming and glamorous looking. Also nice and spacious so it doesn't feel like you're packed in. I can't finish this review without mentioning the live music! That's what really kept us there for the full night, along with the friendly staff.Overall, highly recommend!",1,,

58,Louis K.,"Paramus, NJ",1,4,2,4.0,6/24/2018,"I had a great time at a friend's birthday party at Haswell Green's last night. I used to go to it's predecessor, Howl at the Moon before it closed, and this is a fitting successor.I really like how they renovated the room to feel like a 1920's club, pushed the stage back to allow for a larger dance floor, and used carpeting for the dance floor (I've never seen that before.My only complaint is that the band stopped playing at 1:00am, but other than that I had a great time. If they kept on playing for another hour I would have given it a 5-star rating. Highly recommend!",,,
