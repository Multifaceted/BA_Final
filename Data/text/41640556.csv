I never went downstairs . Evidently it opened up at a certain time - and it seemed like a lot of people went down there We went on a Saturday night- they played 90's hip hop and r&b.  It was such a good time .The drinks were ehh to me . They burned going down . Too Strong but you will definitely get tipsy from them .  Don't expect any mixology stuff here,9,3,9
1,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,5.0,8/30/2018,"Located on Lenox, this Caribbean-Soul lounge has been one of the popular choices on this historical avenue which is known as ""Harlem's Heartbeat.""  With a small intimate outdoor seating area and sleek and sexy bar up front, the Cove has you covered for any occasion.  If you head to the back, they have a lounge that is perfect for a girls night out and even a downstairs area that is always rocking! Their dinner menu includes items such as Jerk Skirt Steak, Fried Chicken & Red Velvet Waffles, Crab Cakes, and Lobster Mac & Cheese.  All the food choices I made were pretty solid the Fried Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles was the star of the evening.  The chicken is was seasoned to perfection, and their award-winning Red Waffles was so soft.  The strawberry butter is homemade and a great addition to the entree and so good I barely touched the syrup it came with.  Cove also serves brunch that is available on the weekend and includes 2-hour unlimited drinks for only $35 per entree.  I got to take a peek at their brunch menu, and it consists of the Cove Omelet, Shrimp & Grits, Cove Brunch Burger, and those tasty Red Velvet Waffles I mentioned earlier.The Cove recently introduced a couple of new rum-based drinks to their cocktail program, and I felt it was my duty to sample them all for you guys.  The Sweet Ting Mojito was one of my favorites and featured a subtle hint of coconut that compliments the rum and muddled strawberries.  The Cove Rum Punch is not part of their new rum line but worth mentioning since it is made with Wray & Nephew.I highly encourage you trying and supporting this black-owned business in Harlem that is also a favorite among Harlemites.",5,,1
2,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,3.0,8/17/2018,"A little bit of a restaurant, lounge, and bar. I had a nice experience dining al fresco at Cove Lounge. We chose to eat outside because the music was just too loud inside to have any meaningful conversation (I guess that we could have sent texts to each other during dinner). Loud music is great for a club/lounge atmosphere, but it's not my cup of tea for dinner. However, Cove Lounge does have an outdoor section that is significantly quieter. For my meal, I really enjoyed the fish n chips. The menu had a wide range of options for your dining pleasure. I will note that the small plates  (the fish and chips was one of the small plate options) are actually regular-sized and quite filling. Based on the portion of food you receive for the small plates, I think that the price point is on par with what you would expect for most mid-tier NYC restaurants (yes, I know technically this place is a lounge). Our waitress was lovely, but the service was kind of a struggle. However, I think she was the only waitress working the inside and outside sections of the lounge. I think that it would be beneficial to have a drink menu that  includes beers and wines, in addition to the fancy cocktails. Our beverage orders kind of went like this: The waitress would tell us the wine list. We ordered our wines. *10 minutes passed* Then, the waitress would tell us that the restaurant did not have that particular wine. We order another type of wine. *10 minutes passed* Then, we'd get our drinks. It seems that this problem could have been circumvented if there was a drink menu. My experience was not amazing, but it was not horrible enough for me not to visit again for dinner and/or beverages.",1,,
3,Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",71,259,941,5.0,8/13/2018,"So I came here after doing dinner at ""Corner Social"" next door and I have to say, I had an AMAZING time! We got here somewhat early (maybe around 9-9:30) so there really wasn't too many people here and we were able to get a seat at/around the bar area. There was a cool funky little lighting situation upon walking in the side entrance bypassing the resturant and leading directly into the lounge area. The bouncer that let us in was a very nice Egyptian guy who seemed real cool- and had great small talk while checking our ID's.The drinks that we had were pretty good, although somewhat strong. I guess this was a good thing as we didn't have to keep buying drinks all night because we are not heavy drinkers. The music was a mix between 90's hip-hop and R&B and top 40 hip-hop songs to date. Our waitress was pretty cool and so was the other staff members.Overall, I really enjoyed my time 1st time experience, we came here on a whim because we were in the area and we had no regrets! I can definitely say moving forward, anytime I am in the area and looking for a spot to ""chill""- ""Cove"" will be the place for me!",,,
4,Latoya W.,"Bronx, NY",241,160,410,4.0,6/17/2018,"Cove lounge is a local favorite. They offer happy hour specials on food and drinks which are priced just  right. Outdoor seating, three bars and a lower level where the party is usually jumping. Thursday is soca night who knew. I've been numerous times this last time i got the fish and French fries. It was 13 dollars and it was a good portion size. There is a dress code after about 8.  No athletic wear, hats or boots. This is based on the discretion of the security.",2,,2
5,Sonya B.,"Cary, NC",0,2,0,1.0,11/11/2018,I used to go to the Cove Lounge at least two or three times per week spending a combined $100 per week. Now I don't go at all. I got sick because they served very old Whiting fish and old chicken. The waitresses take over 20 minutes to serve you water and cocktails. They are extremely slow in serving you and taking your order. They never come to refill your water and you have to run them down to get another cocktail. This place needs an overhaul or shut down. Their business skills are very lacking.,,,

The bartenders are really nice and they make some good drinks.They have a decent happy hour special that includes drinks and food.

8,Felicia I.,"Queens, NY",14,105,37,4.0,9/15/2018,"I came here for a bday party & cove lounge is pretty spacious with decent music. My party had one of there rooms which consisted of couches & tables. What I didn't like, was people sitting in the room area, not apart of the party. It's one thing to have two parties in the room area, but people shouldn't be allowed to just sit in the area, if not apart of a party. The food & drinks were good too.",1,,

It also goes until 8pm which is a rarity in nyc. On top of the specials the food itself is delicious. I usually eat one of the same 4 dishes whenever I visit (the shrimp, lemon chicken bites, wings, and sliders) but whenever I have ventured out from this selection I have not been disappointed. They even had an amazing guest chef visit over the summer to do an exclusive menu for the night. In addition to all of this the music and energy there is ALWAYS bumpin and jumpin lol. I moved from this neighborhood but whenever I come back I always want to pop in for a drink and quick bite.",2,,2
10,Alberto S.,"Berlin Township, NJ",16,7,0,2.0,8/17/2018,"I have to leave a so so review here just to hopefully get management to fix some things. First up...we were served water in a plastic pitcher. The cups brought out were plastic. They were cracked, chipped, and dirty. The water tasted horrible.  I asked for bottled water (even if I had to pay for it) and didn't have it brought to the table. I order the Jerk Skirt Steak with Spiced Fries. The meat was over cooked but the sauce made up for it. There was confusion about the fries. More on that later. My girlfriend ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Mango Salsa. This disk was excellent. My other friends ordered Crispy Whiting Fish & Malt Vinegar Fries. This dish was very good. The fish was great!The server was nice but made an error and charged me for an extra side of fries. It was corrected amicable enough. There are no free refills for soda which I noticed on my bill. I drank 3 narrow glasses of soda because of the foul tasting water on this hot day. Overall I'd give the place a good review but I was so turned off by the items I've mentioned. The only way for this place to get great reviews is to fix this.  The food is good just need to improve the rest.",,,

She mentioned Cove Lounge... my initial impression was beautiful entrance and nice decor! Bathrooms were clean and spacious. Bar tender was attentive! Crowd was mature, by this I mean 25 and up. Music was loud and there was also sections that the music wasn't as loud just in case you needed to speak on your phone and or amongst each other. This is the part where I am giving three stars! The seating arrangements or reservations are completely off. My friend wanted seating in the back or downstairs and somehow it wasn't available. Luckily for us, we had someone who knew someone and arranged things differently. But if we didn't know our friend... it would of probably been a bad night.

16,Dray X.,"Far Rockaway, NY",0,8,0,3.0,7/22/2018,"Went here on a rainy Saturday night. Standard dress code (no hats, collared shirts, fine) drinks were Manhattan priced (10 and up for everything, fine).The spot was pretty crowded and the dance floor had potential. The DJ was terrible. He didn't understand transitions and playing to his crowd. He played a random mix of rap, r&b, and reggae as if he had no relation to the music and just found a random playlist of unrelated songs.... Get a better DJ and you have a better spot.",,,
17,Latisha W.,"Newport News, VA",299,19,38,4.0,6/14/2018,"This place was pretty awesome. They had a somewhat two floor bar, downstairs was pretty much like the chill spot, really dark but also relaxing, second floor was where everything came alive, if you wanted to enjoy yourself go to the second floor. The must was hitting and the bartender was serving them up, he even gave me a free drink basically because I wanted to try a free liquor that I've been trying to try forever to make a long story short I fell in love with that liquor that night. But overall this place is a go to when you want to get out the house and enjoy yourself.",,,

Updated review","Came on a Friday night....the food is great and the music too. Perfect for a night out in Harlem...Came in another Friday night (2/23/18)......So this woman who identified herself as a manager came over to our seat and told us that we had to move the small table in front of us that our drinks were on. We explained that the table had been there the entire time we were there for dinner and we didn't want it to separate us further because we could barely hear one another. She told us we had to push the table back and move it between us. I suggested she could just take the table since we had finished eating. She tells us ""watch the security move us"" and walks away. A guy with a black ski mask on his head as a cap, and hoody comes over and says the manager said we have to move our chairs apart so the table could be pushed back. I replied just move the table away since she said it's blocking the floor, he says he has to push it back, I said ok go ahead, he says you have to move, I said exactly I'm not moving. We had dinner and were on round three when all of this happened but they rudely wanted us to move. This robo cop later flashed a badge and said he's ""on the job"" yet wore a ski mask on his head...since we wouldn't move he went and got the head of security on us lol. Head of security politely asked what occurred and when explained he respectfully handled the situation and we continued with our evening...the table was removed. Oh and the manager in the pic started this conflict and never returned...lastly our waitress Dominique was amazing the entire night. If it weren't for her And the head of security I might have flipped that little table that caused all of this her embarrassing commotion.",4,,

I don't think this place is made to make food. The DJ was great and the music was amazing but the food is not superb. My shrimp and grits were very warm and the grits were not as creamy as I'd expect. I recommend Cove Lounge as a spot for their drinks because their drinks are good but not the food.",,,

The Dj always accommodates every age group playing your throwbacks, your 90's/00's, and music from today.last Tuesday I was there and Dj Trase had me and my girls singing and having a good time.

I ordered the lobster Mac & Cheese my last visit which was delicious! And Moscow mules which was cool because I haven't found too many places do that in Harlem. Very convenient nice little spot.

I kind of regret my decision. Soon as I sat down I noticed the small plate options on the menu was a lil pricey. I don't mind spending money for my food when it's worth it, so I decided to stay since I was already sitting down. I hate doing that awkward walk-out after looking at a menu. I got the honey hoisin wings (6wings for $14). They were ""ehh"", wasn't worth it. My friend got the beef sliders ($17 for two sliders & fries). The meat in the sliders didn't match up with the proportion of the thick pretzel bread that they serve for those sliders. Customer service was a lil crappy. We felt like we were being rushed. We had to say ""Thankyou"" atleast five times before we received a ""you're welcome"". Maybe we went at the wrong time. I see all of these great reviews and I'm wishing I had the same experience.

There's a VIP section I think with couches, and tv screens which is very cool .. the decor is very nice and the only thing I'm going to not necessarily complain about, but I wish the spot was bigger meaning spacing, and they should have a coat check. Almost everyone I saw was holding their coats in their hands. Overall I would love to come back to try the food, for I did see a shrimp salad that looked delicious.

I was there for a birthday celebration.  We had gotten there a bit early and decided to have a drink.  I wanted to get a dessert, but they don't serve any.  So my girlfriend finished her drink and we went somewhere else and came back later for the celebration.  Cute atmosphere for the most part.  Love the ceiling lights and the different mirrors on the wall in the back room.  The back room, where we were had 2 televisions, which was on a sports channel.  That was quite the contradiction to the music and the atmosphere.  To me, it would have been better to put it on a music video station, which would help keep the energy up in the space.  It was touch and go all night as the DJ was just AWFUL!  You can't hear the music as well in the back room because there are are no speakers in the room.  DJ Mike Sessions was one of the worst DJs ever! He kept playing ol' skool, but not the 'good stuff'.  It was boring and people were falling asleep.  The people I was celebrating with were getting annoyed with his terrible song transitions.  He talked too much in between songs and never let a song fully play.  He would cut the song off after maybe the 1st verse.  He was just NOT GOOD!  We did have fun, but The Cove can do so much better than Sessions.",1,,1

I haven't made a better decision all week! I asked the server what she'd recommend, she said everything is really good...of course I thought she was just saying that...*side eye*. I wanted to keep it light and healthy (as much as possible anyway) so I ordered the turkey sliders filled with goat cheese, which comes with Asparagus fries...I subbed it with grilled asparagus.

The server Dominic was FANTASTIC and really made my review a 4 star than a 3.5 Star the food was good as well as the drinks. HOWEVER the wait for the food was terrible Someone in our party waited over an hour for broccoli and I waited over an for my food. I placed an order for some food to take home OVER and hour as well guess the unlimited mimosas and bumping music makes you forget how long you are really waiting for your food. But. I really wish the food wait time was better!!!,,,

We didnt eat so I can't say anything about the food. But the drinks were on point. The vibe in there was so nice, grown and sexy crowd that was there to party, no fighting or anything.So that night I lost my phone there. I was belligerently drunk and cursed everyone out. That kind of drunk when you don't know how you got home.So anyway the next morning I'm so stressed  and my boyfriend was giving me a recap of the night.  I was so embarrassed. So instead of heading straight to Cove to see if they had my phone I went to the Sprint store. Sprint wasn't saying anything I wanted to hear. So I felt like I  HAD To take that walk of shame back to Cove. When I got there a Spanish girl was like ""I remember you from last night"". I was so ashamed and she was totally cool about. Thank God they did recover my phone and they invited me back.  I have lived in Harlem for 3yrs I absolutely hate it. I don't go anywhere in Harlem, being west Indian I feel Harlem doesn't cater to my culture. But now Cove has a special place in my heart. I'm telling everyone to go to Cove on Thursday nights!",3,4,1

My sister and I had just had an unpleasant experience across the street and really wanted a drink and something light to eat. We only waited about 5 minutes for a front outside table. The host was the happiest, friendliest and super professional service oriented front of the house person I've seen in NYC.He sent over a really nice, friendly, knowledgeable and fast waitress. We ordered several amazing delicious appetizers and drinks and wound up eating, drinking and people watching for hours. Must go back to try other food items & check out the constant party downstairs.

Seating upstairs is limited I know the basement area is huge compared to the upstairs. I specifically came here for the red velvet chicken and waffles, and experience that I saw after eating at Corner social (used to be my go to until they stopped serving lobster Mac and breakfast nachos). We were looking over at cove and saw groups of people taking pics with A Instagram frame and music blasting mimosas flowing. My friends and i slightly wished we went there instead. Well that was last summer fast forward to this weekend unfortunately it wasn't the same. Okay 90s r&b they had the door open to the outside but it was so chilly out it was just as cold on the inside do we ate with our coats on. The chicken and waffles were sooooo good. A hearty piece of bone in chicken quarter and a full Belgium red velvet waffle . Worth the trip up from our hotel in Times Square. Loved that it was a black owned restaurant like many of the Harlem establishments , I think the owner was sitting at the bar , most of the time owners make their self known and speak to the customers vs just sitting there people watching. The place is literally the size of a bedroom. Great food though.",3,1,2

Bartenders  are fast, and experienced mixers. Ketel One & Ginger was $13. Music is modern and cult classic hip hop/ rap.If you continue to the back there is an area you can reserve with couches and two or three table.  Downstairs was the surprise winner of the night for me. Downstairs you'll find another bar and a open space dance floor. It's surprisingly large, coming from upstairs you wouldn't expect that kind of space down there. The dance floor level has a mandatory coat check.",1,,

Never brought me my food. And then when she came over 10 minutes after we inquired about the food she said that they didn't have the cheese that was supposed to go on the burger. They were also out of half of the menu despite Whole Foods being across the street. Grat is included so they think they can treat people any way and get away with it. It's so sad that these establishments are trying to hold on and their service is sooooooooooooooooo terrible.,,,

I have a severe shellfish allergy and they use the same oil for everything so I couldn't consume anything fried! I asked for a sub of grilled chicken and had back and forth debate with the waitress to accommodate my allergy. Mind you there were 5 in my party! We waited 45 mins for our food and what added insult to injury, people who arrived 20 mins after me received and completed their food and drinks before my food arrived! And last but not least my daughters fries arrived 1 hour and 30 mins post ordering. This was totally unacceptable..... pure disappointment!",2,,

I spoke to one of the security guards, he was completely unprofessional, rude, on a power trip (this is the one who stands inside the door). Also spoke to the manager who we told had racist policies but he was not trying to hear anything we were saying. He said since Cove is a black owned business, how can they be racist? Well when you discriminate against your own people, thats how. Unfortunately, this makes it even worse. AWFUL ESTABLISHMENT- never returning!",9,,2

The bartender was really nice and made our drinks up to par. It's hard to find a restaurant in the city where the drinks aren't filled with juice for $15. My friend ordered the shrimp scampi which would've been good if it wasn't so salty. Now My real issue  was the bouncer. I invited my friend to come over and the bouncer wouldn't let him in because of a ""dress code"". If you have a dress code that's fine but enforce it with all customers through all business hours. There were women wearing sweatpants and sneakers and plenty of men with jeans and sneakers as well. Then the bouncer was rude to my friend and didn't handle the situation in a professional manner. It was definitely profiling! It situation like these that makes it hard to support your neighborhood with the sometimish ways and the lack of professionalism !",3,,

I prefer to sit in the back lounge area because I mostly go with a group of 8 or more. I have had great service. The drinks are hit or miss, but mostly hit. The food is always on point.

Why would anyone mix red velvet and jalapeño???

This was my first time there and unfortunately it will be my last.The server just sucked! We asked if he had a drink menu and he named 3 brunch specials and also stated we can make whatever your normal drink is. We asked for a Moscow Mule and he had no idea what is was. When he explained what the ingredients were, he could not make it. I asked for a dirty martini and that too was denied. Clearly we could not order what we normally do. We settled on their brunch special of rum punchat $6. The cocktail tasted like something I would get at an all inclusive resort. Water down alcohol with too much sugar. The server never checked in on us, never offered us any food and also never made eye contact when we spoke to him. He had no people skills and clearly was there to just put in drink orders and not up sell anything else.The music and scene were great. The food looked tasty. However this server made such a bad impression we asked for the check and went to Corner Social where we ordered food and three rounds of cocktails with a great server named Peyton! First impressions are meaningful. I hope they train this guy to be a little more personable. Your food can be great, the atmosphere can be great but if the service sucks it doesn't matter.

The changing colors along the long walk way was nice. Upon entering the lounge was packed everywhere. The bar, the back room had a party going on, and there was a bouncer blocking people from going downstairs.  From what I heard it was packed down there as well. Aside from that the decor was nice. The waitstaff was friendly and courteous. Willing to accommodate your needs. We stood off to the side and waited for our food. We took it out as there wasn't anywhere really to sit. I sampled some of the food:The food:-Fries: crisp with a Cajun seasoning. Not bad. A little salty. -Lobster Mac and Cheese: the lobster was plentiful. There was a smoky flavor to the Mac and cheese. Maybe bacon. A little over powering. -Chicken bites: nicely fried. Pretty goodI will have to check them out another night for drinks and food. Saturdays are packed!",5,,2
83,Tae K.,"Bronx, NY",70,61,82,2.0,3/4/2016,"Two bad experiences at cove lounge.  First one was a little bday brunch I put together on Dec 13th 2015.  Emailing Gloria back and fourth for at least a week.  Everything was set in stone as to what I wanted and when my party and I arrived they had two parties already going on in the back area, and only one waitress.  Gloria wasn't there and a young man told us we either sit in the front or there would be no one to serve us.  How is that possible? I made reservations....Anyway we were served by a waiter named German.  He advised us something's on the menu weren't available and when everyone decided to order the chicken and waffles, he said there is no white meat.Second Try:  Sunday morning Brunch.  Arrived 30 mins after opening and waited 45 mins to get our food.  Of course everything on the menu wasn't available.  Ordered the jerk chicken with jalapeno cornbread. The jerk chicken had no seasoning what so ever, so I can't understand why it took 45 mins to cook.  It looked like left over chicken from the day before with oil and grease dabbed on it.  I asked my server German to provide me with some jerk sauce to place on top of the chicken, he first said we don't have any (HUH)????? and then he said that's the sauce on your plate. Garlic spring beans look like they could have tasted good, if they weren't cold as heck. I ate all of the corn bread because I was starved some of the chicken that was edible and a couple beans.  My best friend said her chicken and waffles were good. Which was a ramekin of grease and oil.  I asked for a supervisor because my food was cold, under cooked, rubbery and very late.  He advised he that he was the only person I could speak to.  However I noticed a man in a gray sweat suit giving him orders earlier that day.  Our bill wasn't discounted at all nor was a sincere apology given.Pros: The jalapeno cornbread and the Drinks.. The lounge part is great when they have a DJ",6,,

No dress code/No cover but I'd highly recommend to come dressed to impress as most of the patrons are. There was no riff raff present when I went. Love that it's downstairs! From the outside you can't tell that there is a popping party downstairs. The bouncers were cool! The DJ was on point! Spinning hip hop, top 40 and a little soca, Latin and reggae tunes! There was only 1 bartender but she held down the fort! I never waited more than 5 mins to order and have my drink. Everyone was dancing. Everyone was friendly.

I contacted the owner who gave me the run-around for months. Customer service and follow-up is lacking when it comes to The Cove management. Drinks are just okay slightly overpriced, place is a little tight and gets very crowded fast which would normally be good if the setup was a little different.

87,Chelsea T.,"Patchogue, NY",252,201,1755,3.0,12/14/2014,"Okay, so I have mixed feelings about this place. Let's start with the food. I've been here a few times-the majority of them being for events held by school organizations. The food is actually very tasty! Lobster mac&cheese, wings, chicken skewers, shrimp, crab rangoons...all delish!!! Atmosphere: upstairs there is a bar and private room. The bar area can be alittle tight but it's sore try relaxed atmosphere. TVs, music, good crowd= good entertainment. The private room in the back is nice...a few large couches and chairs. There is more space downstairs...atmosphere not as nice but it has a bar and tvs and a few places to sit. I've also been to two events downstairs and had s good time. They have karaoke and other events you can attend. Service: I'll just speak to our last event. Our sever was really nice but maybe not as attentive as I would have liked given the huge extra fees they added on to our bill-that we weren't made aware of until we got there. No bueno. They were accommodating with our needs while planning event so that was appreciated. Drinks: happy hour prices are good. And in the summer time they added some outdoor seating where you can enjoy the happy hour outside. The actual drinks are nothing special and the regular prices are a little steep. Overall it's a decent spot! I'll probably go back- maybe would even give more stars if it wasn't for the whole up charge on our bill.",4,,2
88,Maurice A.,"Valley Cottage, NY",3,16,91,1.0,10/17/2015,"I cannot understand how you can run a business with management that has no respect for the customer. When we first get to the restaurant and attempted to enter, the Manager, gothy looking woman in black, is blocking the entrance as she is talking to one of the bouncers. We had to wait for her to finish her conversation before she let us in. Keep in mind the place is mostly empty. When we do go in, we are just standing there as a blonde black woman walks by us a couple of times and begins to move a table. She happens to be the hostess and she does not greet us at all. We are eventually seated by the waitress, who is the saving grace in this whole fiasco.We order drinks and food and attempt to enjoy ourselves. After dinner we order another round of drinks. We get our drinks and my wife notices the manager talking to our waitress. The waitress comes over and let's us know that we could take our drinks to the downstairs lounge or the bar, if we would like. The request wasn't a big deal since we had asked about taking our drinks downstairs. We decide to stay where we are but ask for the check, which the waitress brings. Halfway through our drinks the manager comes over and says we have to move. The reason, someone is waiting for a table and has ordered food that is about to come out. SERIOUSLY? We are in this establishment spending money and we're being asked to leave so someone else can take our place. The mistake the manager made is not realizing that although we had the check, we hadn't paid yet. We let her know that we weren't moving until we finished our drinks. Without payment there wasn't much she could do.The waitress comes over and apologizes and we do realize it wasn't her call. We paid our bill after finishing our drinks and left. We will never go back. I do not spend money anywhere that doesn't respect my patronage and I have no problems letting people know why. As for the food and drinks. I consider dining out an experience. The experience I had at Cove was so bad it's not worth commenting on the food. If you don't mind being treated any kind of way just to say you were in the spot, then go. If, like me, you do care about service, this is not the place.",23,,1

I advised her that my friend drink was short of course nasty nancy had to reply with an attitude saying no its not I measured it correctly and did nothing wrong ""it just so happen"" that your drink is fuller than hers.....OK well simple sally if we ordered the same drink, that cost the same amount shouldn't the serving size be the same as well??? mind you my drink wasn't even filled but it didn't look as bad as my friend. My friend asked for the drink to be made over she said no I told my friend to ask for the manager she eagerly stated ""I am the manager"" If in fact that statement is true then miss manager should be ashamed of the humongous chip on her shoulder, lack of coif and inexperience in customer service and bar tending...... Oh I also ordered truffle fries (3 buck upcharge) instead of the malt fries that came with my food when my food arrived I was given the malt fries when I told the ""manager/bartender"" she acted as if I was lying and said I told them truffle fries so idk what you're talking about! my friend agreed it was malt fries she sent my fries back all while rolling her eyes when I received my new fries they was truffle fries but all they did was toss the original malt fries they gave me with truffle oil and served me the same fries! so my end result was truffle malt fries....On a good note the food is always good in cove, which is the reason we went back in the first place I love the truffle fries and wings the fish sliders are good as well.... the drinks are blah depending on the bartender I like this drink called the smuggler cove it packs a punch but it's 18 bucks which is upscale rooftop chelsea prices and shouldn't be Harlem prices however when I feel like it I do just go for the gusto and consider the smugglers coveI despise feeling like I have to travel outside of my neighborhood for an quality experience, Customers make businesses flourish so I don't understand why local business in Harlem act as if you are not paying for a service and they're in fact doing YOU a favor. Many businesses open and close in Harlem as the trends change. Note to Cove humble your staff or ""management"" and understand that the people keep you afloat.....",8,10,1

After making a reservation in person and receiving a text confirmation, they treated me like I had no reservation and made me show the text several times while they tried to figure out amongst themselves who sent it.  After walking out the Manager finally decides to speak to us and admit that they double booked, even though my reservation was at 6pm and the others were not until  7 and 8. I don't understand how anyone can run a business like this.",8,,
92,Diddy E.,"New York, NY",6,6,1,1.0,6/2/2014,"Words of the manager: ""We have a strict dress policy. We don't allow sneakers like Chucks or Jordans, but you can wear like some designer sneakers.  We want a Soho feel and clientele but here, uptown. And now that all of the hood places are closing in Harlem, we want to keep those people out of here. They aren't our clientele. They can go next door to Corner Social.""What? Wow.And here's how we came to that:I went for happy hour on Friday with a friend. The bouncer wouldn't let me in because of my footwear, so I ask to speak to the manger. It was 5:30 on a Friday and everyone sitting outside was in t-shirts and jeans, so I couldn't understand why my sneakers with a wedge heel weren't considered acceptable attire for happy hour. The manager and I spoke back and forth about the situation. She didn't apologize for it- instead she blamed the bouncer for being aggressive and the owner for her silly policies. You are the manager; it is your job to take responsibility, not to throw your coworkers and your boss under the bus. Say your sorry for whole situation explain the dress policy for my next visit, and move on.  Or enforce the policy your manager has set and don't allow me in.  To the owner: You want to cater to a certain clientele-I respect that. Best of luck keeping this place open. I'll be next door with ""those"" people at Corner Social. Also, I would suggest cleaning your bathroom and investing in soap that is more suitable for your patrons.",27,35,2

One of my girlfriends ordered the omelet which was delicious, and another ordered the chicken and waffles again delicious!!! It was so good we're going back this Sunday for another brunch. We were planning on going to another place for brunch but all decided we'd prefer the Cove again. The music was great the the place is comfortable and absolutely beautiful.

98,E T.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,3.0,2/25/2017,I went to Cove afterwork on 2/24/17. I used to come here the first year it opened. I saw they added a very small dining area and a small bar in the front that about 4 people can sit at. So I went to the original bar in the back. The downstairs lounge was not open (they said it would be open at 11pm) which was a disappointment because I wanted to dance. Before it used to be open around 6 or 7pm). The bartender was very nice but Cove needs to hire another bartender to help him. The barmaids drinks were nasty! The happy hour drinks and some regular drinks I ordered were not good at all. Maybe that's why I saw a lot of people ordering shots.  The reason why I gave 3 stars because my food was good and the DJ was good. I will go back but I will not be ordering mix drinks. If I do drink it will be wine only!The old management and entertainment was better.,,,
99,Denise R.,"Bronx, NY",50,63,118,2.0,9/7/2015,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICEI've come here many times in the past with various groups of friends who wanted to try the place and minus the first couple visits when the establishment first opened were fine. But a few months after and onward I've been consistently disappointed. Begrudgingly I went again today for happy hour since the one thing they've always had right is their drinks and appetizers. So i indulged and regret it. The delay in services. The NUMEROUS mistakes on our order and patrons at neighboring tables was an embarrassment to the historic harlem neighborhood this lounge calls home. The one stars is for the happy hour drinks and apps. The second is for the decor. If I could give 1.5 I would. I can no longer spend my dollars here. I've avoided this place for over 8 months for a reason and am upset I came back.,4,,1

While there for the work event I tasted their wings which were Okay, nothing to run home and tell Mommy about. The room we reserved was the back room upstairs which was decorated pretty nice. I told myself I woukd come back to see what its like at night, well I finally did and.... The drinks were soooooooooooo watered down I could not believe it. On the bottom floor where they have the Dj there is also a unnecessary bar and I say unnecessary because it is not a good use of the space, should especially when there is already 2 other bars in the same lounge. At said bar they also have seats reserved ao dont think you can place your drink down and stand there, who the hell came up with that idea,reserving a seat at the bar.The bartender was also slow waited long to get drinks. The Dj wasnt the worst once I left and went to the business next door and got a good deink in my system I was was ready to dance to anytbing he played. All in all. The decor is nice, the use of the space in general is not good the drinks are not good and having reservations for a spot at the bar is not good.",2,,1

The space is tight, but in an intimate way.Pros: a great food selection, good music, no cover charge, and Cove is open very late on weekends. The crowd is great as well. It's a diverse mix of mid-20s to grown and sexy and for some reason it works well.Cons: the servers are really slow! I've for about 5 different occasions and getting a drink took at least 10-15 min. I personally feel the place is too small to not have great service. The only other issue is the bar selection is weak. Some nights they have run out of bar essentials (ex. Malibu Rum, blue liqueur, peach Ciroc, etc.).",1,,

We only stayed in the bar on the main level. The room is slim and the decor is cool. The music was consistently great (hip hop/rap) the whole time we were there, no duds.It was a Friday night around 9:30 so we were ID'd by the bouncer. He was totally polite and friendly. We were seated and first dealt with a lady in a fabulous outfit who seemed like an owner or manager. Our waitress, while friendly, was pretty spacey and seemed to forget about us. I asked for a drink menu which only had cocktails on it - no beer, no wine, no hiballs - and she never came back. The manager noticed and took our order. My husband ordered a beer (only two on tap) and I ordered a standard hiball. The waitress eventually came back waaaaay later but we had already ordered, and she seemed sort of surprised. The bartender came over to check on something and he was really nice. We only stayed for the one drink and had to flag someone down for the bill. $9 for a draft beer! $12 for a well drink! I was certainly not expecting these prices, especially when the signature cocktails were $13. I figured my hiball would be more like $8-10. Definitely overpriced in my books. I saw people eating and the food looked good and the prices were comparable to other places in the neighbourhood, so I would potentially return here for dinner sans drinks.",4,,1

A tad salty, but I would still recommend it. The truffle fries are perfect though. Seriously, I should just get an order of those one day!The staff is nice, the ambience is lovely, and my food came out in a timely manner.

I wonder if the DJ went to the bathroom or was fiddling through the playlist (no shade). The main issue I have with Cove was when the manager (I assume this was the manager) asked everyone to get off of their bar stools (in the lower part of the lounge) so that they could remove them to make room for everyone to dance. Now I have never heard of this done anywhere else, but a friend of mine had a problem with that and made a fuss about it.

On my first visit two months ago i came with one girlfriend and we had a reservation. The service was SLOW to say the least and all the food came out cold. Every time you ask for anything you got an attitude like they were paying you instead of the other way around. It wasn't even busy lots of tables free. Also no mention of the lounge part or second bar in the back. Found out when the security walked me to the bathroom.  Needless to say I wasn't impressed but another girlfriend wanted to go there for after Hoodwinked (that I highly recommend).  I digress, we get there they say they can't seat 9 of us but a big space by window opens up we ask if we can get it. The waitress says fine with attitude  galore. You would think big tips food ect nope not her.  Other pp came after no menus no service 20 mins later Nothing. So we got up and left. On the way out we see some a gentleman ( word used loosely) who says they are a manager.  Say you just lost a huge table he replies almost to the effect of so what who gives a flying leap.  Try the lounge if you want to feel like you are in a old HS house party where your cousin is Dj for the 1st time and hasn't learn the art of mixing or keeping the crowd going.

Their Turkey sliders stuffed with goat cheese and cranberry are crazy, and the Red velvet waffles and chicken will make you want to come back. The drinks are pretty good too.The ambiance is hip and the multiple dining spaces allow for a fun and comfy group hangout or an intimate date night. The servers are always attentive and informative. This place is a winner",1,,

143,Jeff R.,"Montclair, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,12/7/2015,"To the owners of cove lounge I consider Cove my local spot, however  with one major flaws  such as the attitude and inconsistencies of some of the staff members specially the Spanish ""so call manager bar tender "" she will run your business into the grown .I know you worked hard to build this business yet you leave in this people's hands, this weekend you could had a serious incident on your location ...all because you have rude and inexperience ""management staff""??...You have now lost my entire network of high income quality people you should be trying to attract and for that I'm sorry.This Spanish young lady behind the bar at the lounge serving drinks but claim to be the manager in combination with the person that was at the door Saturday 12/5 around 7pm. They acted like they own the place. She has to be a relative or no other way I can see a smart lady like you allowed her to ruin your business...smh.... This woman is ALWAYS rude and nasty everything is responded to in an ill manner.For the record she's also a thief, added a gratuity to my bill....no worry's Visa it's now investigation all your transactions...I love to go out and spend money and have a great time, I respect your place however your ""employee "" have a ghetto mentality that not fitting with the culture you're trying to set up .I now have to travel outside of my neighborhood for an quality experience, Customers make businesses flourish so I don't understand why local business in Harlem act as if you are not paying for a service and they're in fact doing YOU a favor. Many businesses open and close in Harlem as the trends change. Note to Cove humble your staff or ""management"" and understand that the people keep you afloat..... Please sister before it's gone..... Yours Truly",2,2,

Something about the layout equals a lot of lines for everything even available dancefloor space. The bouncer inside is annoyingly and very uptight .

146,J B.,"New York, NY",19,94,58,1.0,7/18/2015,"Here's a conversation on how NOT to run a business. Came here with a client for the first time, place was pretty packed, decided to checkout the downstairs area. Music was decent decided to stay. Ordered some drinks. In heels and wanted an area we can sit get some bottles, order some food and meet some people so decided to get bottle service. Addressing the bartender: ""Hi, would you have a wine list or a champagne list I would like to buy some bottles."" Bartender: ""We don't have a list, what do you want"" Me: ""I would like champagne"" Bartender: ""What kind"" Me: ""I don't know, do you have a Brut or a Prosecco""Bartender: ""I think I have that"" Me: ""Which one?""Bartender: pulled out a bottle of Prosecco Mionetto Brut - He told me the price, and said gratuity would be automatically added for table service. I said ok, I'm assuming we're going to have the table at the end of the bar on this floor, I don't want to go back upstairs. He said yes, I'm getting you a server to seat you now. 15mins go by, which is a long wait for no one having bottle service and wanting to buy some bottles. Hoping to speed things up, I turn to the bartender and ask if it's easier we can just have our bottle service here at the bar if we can get 2 bar stools. He said, no your server will be over soon. Another 10mins later a pleasant server came over and said she would be serving us, and hands me a menu and said which bottle?. (Notice, suddenly there is a menu). I scan the menu & the bottle I was offered was not on the menu, which I tell the server. She goes behind the bar, talks to the bartender. Then they pull over another guy over into the discussion. Few minutes go by and finally the bartender turns to me and says ""We don't sell that bottle"" then turns away. Me: ""Um hello... excuse me... ""Bartender: ""Yea sorry we don't sell that bottle.""Me: ""Ok what happened cause you showed it to me so you clearly have it."" Bartender: ""I can sell you the bottle but you can't get a table"" Me: ""Ok can we have the bottles here at the bar, and get 2 stools"" Bartender: ""No"" Me: ""No I want to sit which is why I want bottle service"" Another 10mins go bySame female server comes over to me and with a big smiles says, ""I'm ready to sit you guys"" Me: ""I was told we couldn't get the bottle"" Server: ""I can sell you the bottle, no problem, so don't worry I'm going to show you your table""Me: ""But the bartender told us we can buy the bottle but we couldn't have a table"" Server: ""Oh really, then I can't give you the table"" Me: Beyond baffled now this is happening in such a small lounge. Another 10mins pass, I see the gentleman the bartender and server pulled in to talk to before. I motion for his attention. He comes over. Me: ""Excuse me, are you the man in charge?""Mgr: ""Yes""Me: ""Well I wanted to let you know what what my experience was in trying to buy some bottles tonight."" Then proceeded to say everything that happened, and said, so you see I'm getting several different responses from several different people after long periods of time from your staff trying to buy bottle service""Mgr: ""Well what I say is the only thing that counts"" ((Really ***hole I believe that was already established when I started the conversation asking if you were in charge. Show your inches to someone who should care like your staff, I do not.))Me: ""I just thought you should know, because no one is buying bottles, I'm willing to buy bottles, and no one is using the table. Not to mention, I thought you should know your staff is not in line with what they're telling customers""Mgr: A shrug and walked away. Here's another tip for running a business and making money. Not one person out of 3 (including the incompetent manager) bothered to ask how many were in my party and how many bottles was I planning to buy. I was in town on business vacation and had my company credit card and was prepared to show my client a good time buying several bottles for us, food and share the good time with whomever we met that had a good energy. I also tip very well when my clients needs are met. I would've bought 3-5 bottles easily, already seeing a few people we would've enjoyed sharing the party with. But that's what happens with inexperienced one dimensional managers looking to have a good time more than run a business. Here's another tip, all staff should know your bottle service policies and have menus on the ready. In such a small place it should take no longer than 5mins for a VIP or bottle service manager to handle the sale not going on a 25min discussion on what's the right information, and several people completely dropping the ball on the sale. Went to another well managed club spent almost $800 with a night and day difference on how a business is run smoothly and service leaves you and your client and all our new friends having a great time. If you want to spend money and have a good time, I would skip this business, manager's ego seems more important.",29,5,5

Updated review","Gone are the days of execution and facilitation:(. I use to frequent this establishment, as they use to have many many entrees that were just addictive. I have to say that the last visit broke my addiction for sure. The wait to get drinks  (which I never received) and well as an undesirable change int he menu had mr walking out and heading to the Meatpacking district 20 minutes late in an Uber. If you are going to charge $15 for a drink in Harlem, please be professional intaking the order, lose the attitude and deliver the drinks efficiently. I can pay the same in Meatpacking or Midtown and have it delivered with better efficiency and attitude. The organization of this place is a mess! It will be interesting to see how they manage their recent expansion.....",5,,
148,Kelli J.,"New York, NY",16,71,72,4.0,11/9/2014,"I went here for drinks with a friend around 9:00 on a random Friday night. The interior is nice -- I could see hosting an event or something there. We had a few cocktails with top shelf liquor and they were $12 a piece. Not cheap, but not ridiculously expensive either. The music was good, but not so loud that I couldn't carry on a conversation with my friend at the bar. The bartender is HAWT and his drinks were flavorful and strong, plus he was nice and not in a douchey way, which I appreciated. Since Moca went downhill, I've been looking for a neighborhood bar in Harlem and Cove might be it. I will definitely be back.",1,,1

For the longest, no one even knew Cove sold really great food. Many still don't. What used to be an amazing happy hour is now disappointing.

155,Jessica C.,"Manhattan, NY",63,10,0,4.0,7/9/2013,"I have never hung out in Harlem before this year and usually head downtown for fun. However, Cove is definitely my new haunt for summer 2013 and beyond! There are so many things I like about the place that I will list as follows:5 Stars = Ambiance. The place is classy, sexy and comfortable. It definitely looks and feels like a real lounge.5 Stars = Food. Okay, so I haven't tried everything on the menu yet (though I am actively working on it) but their lobster mac and cheese, red velvet waffles and fried chicken, shrimp skewers and seasoned fries are just scrumptious!4.5 Stars = Service. Courteous and professional staff from the door all the way to the downstairs kitchen. Thanks guys!4 Stars = DJ. You will dance, I repeat... you will DANCE!4 Stars = Crowd. Everyone is there to have a good time and there is quite a large age range in terms of populace. However, I wish the dress code was more strict. Let's keep it classy folks!3 Stars = Drinks. Sorry guys, but the drinks are a bit pricey and I really didn't get a buzz after 3 specialty drinks and 3 shots. On another note, the other night I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea and it did the trick plus it was delicious!Well, that's pretty much Cove in a nutshell. It is a nice little nook to eat great, talk to down to earth folks and get your boogie on. Oh and Wednesdays are Karaoke nights so come thru if you want to hear me sing a Destiny's Child song.",11,4,5
156,Troy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,124,27,4.0,8/5/2014,"Lobster Mac & Cheese!!!!!Mutha effing amazing!!!!I enjoyed some of the other food they had there as well. The drinks were really good. The place is a bit small, but not uncomfortable. I enjoyed myself there. The music was good. The staff was really friendly. My gripe with them is that when I checked my coat, i had no idea I had to wait so damn long to get it back. I believe they used a space next door or something like that as their coat check. I haven't been in quite some time, but hopefully that has changed. I will be going back very soon tho. Parking is Harlem is ALWAYS difficult for me. And dress accordingly. I got turned away because of my footwear. Luckily, I keep alternative choices in my trunk. I definitely recommend this place.",,1,1
157,Reba P.,"Austin, TX",39,153,106,2.0,7/23/2014,"Harlem Sizzle night. The gatekeeper was handsome, cordial, and professional. The waiter was efficient, friendly, and accomodating. The server - he should just be fired, rude little guy who can't go with the flow of a fast paced stop in, nibble, hop out evening. It is so unfortunate when there are many choices around that one employee can jeopardize a good thing. You've all heard the stories about the weakest link. The drinks, flavorful, strong, Hendricks Coctail was a delight! Water - a precious commodity that was rationed as if we were trying to water our lawn in Texas when the lake is 20"" low!Yes, I ""settled"" for the Island Chicken wings - flavorful, however a bit on the over done side - I know, they had to plan for ALOT, but can work on the timing a bit more. The fries - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I don't generally eat fries so this recommendation means DO IT!All that said, I will give this place another shot - primarily because they were out of the truffled mac and cheese and that was my main mission!Give this place a go, or 2!",,1,
158,Vana C.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,76,22,1.0,3/24/2013,"Horrible! The one star is for the atmosphere, decor, and shrimp... the praises end there. Last night was one of the most disenchanting nightlife experiences, ever. The staff is unorganized, unpleasant and extremely unprofessional. My friend reserved space to celebrate her birthday, a good majority of the party was not allowed downstairs because the longue area was over capacity. How is this possible if the venue was compensated for a celebration? And that's just a portion of her guests' that attended after enduring the hour long wait to even enter the establishment. Many of her family and friends left before they made it inside after having to wait on line in the cold; *possibly because management's guests are priority instead of paying patrons. When concerns were brought to his attention the situation still was not rectified.Women were improperly dressed (sneakers, in a lounge, on a Saturday night? Oh.).The Dj was terrible (Fresh Prince theme song in rotation? Really, Sir?).The coat check system is a complete catastrophe (here's my ticket, please make me wait 20 minutes while you retrieve my jacket from the outhouse next door). I won't even begin to express how long it took for me to receive my drink in comparison to how fast the check for it came. Or how we practically had to clean the discarded cups and plates ourselves because there was no barback to speak of nor did the waitress seem to notice or care the table needed to be cleared.Not impressed, will NEVER return, especially for a party... Guess it's to be expected, afterall it is Harlem.*Be prepared to wait on line and get skipped by groupies, college roommates, family members, out of town guests, frat brothers, baby mamas, little league coaches, pastors, kindergarten teachers, and cub scout leaders of the manager. All of these people will enter before you. I'm unsure if this practice is routine or if it was just this particular night but if his social circle is paramount to business he should entertain at his home or the venue should have been closed for the evening.",21,10,

The bar tender was brand new, but him and the other guy who seemed to have been working there for a long time and maybe managing? Were awesome.

Instead, we received another drink that tasted like a mixture of cough syrup & moonshine. When asked if we could go downstairs, there was an extra $50 fee. We decided to pay the extra $50 to go downstairs for the open bar & dance floor. Although the DJ did play the latest music, the crowd was a bit older than expected. The available appetizers looked old, and the men constantly danced all over you when asking politely for them to stop. Some made attempts to buy drinks during the open bar time frame.  When it was time to leave, the management couldn't find my coat for over 20 minutes. I paid the mandatory coat checking fee & after arguing with the staff, they found my coat.Overall, I would NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone and come only if you want to have a horrible time.",9,2,

170,Kishory M.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",12,13,8,3.0,3/13/2015,"The setting is beautiful. Feels extremely homey and comfortable. The food was wicked basic though. Chicken and fries type of finger food. The setting did not match the food selection nor who they should be appealing to for an audience. The surrounding places were packed, but this place only had a few people in it. Something in isn't matching up in their strategy. Music was a good plus though. My drink was really strong (not complaining... but could have been mixed better). So advice to cove, update your menu, hire new staff (more professional who pay attention to their guest), and do a bit more training with them. This place has great potential if ran by the right management. Finally note, when the check was received... we were given the wrong check (that happen to be way higher than ours). If we didn't check to see what was ordered we were have been schemed. Then after it was brought to the attention of the waiter, he just took off a few things but gave us the same bill (with items we did not order) that was ""equivalent"" to our bill because they combined bills or something. Did not like this at all. Very careless on the staffs part. Oh and get some higher tables jesh!Has high potential but has a few things holding them back from complete success .",2,,

The waiter bought out crab wontons to my sister and she was allergic! She never tasted crab so didnt know what it was! When i ate one and told her and flagged him over.. He said we had to pay because i ate one and she ate one. Meanwhile, her throat was itching. THEN... We were promised a table and they tried to have us sit at a bar! THENNN when I finally got my food my chicken was burnt! My my sisters food was bombbb! Service was def horrible but the food was yummy",,,

Updated review","Cove gave me a first impression worthy of a 5-star review.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed it so much that we became instant regulars, frequenting the place almost once a week.  Unfortunately, our experiences began to decline in quality.  We noticed staffing changes and inconsistencies with the food, which didn't always result in a good experience.  One day after a particularly brutal happy hour (extremely long wait for food and drinks,) I informed the manager on duty, Billy, of our recent experiences--How witnessing this establishment perform below its potential saddens us.  He listened to every word of my feedback, and thanked me for it.  He invited us to come back another time, and to let him know when we did. We felt like celebrities on our next visit.  It seemed Billy had really taken our feedback to heart.  There was a new floor manager (Jesse) who clearly knew her stuff (engaging with guests, making sure everyone was provided for.)  Not only were we waited on with a ton of care and attention, but the food and cocktails were amazing.  It made us really happy to see Billy actively address the recently developed weak points of Cove. So i'll finish my second review with this: if you feel like this establishment failed you in some way before--give it another chance! The staff are amazing and the food and drinks are supreme.  Those who walk past it are missing out on a seriously impressive establishment.",,,
180,Andy D.,"New York, NY",16,42,1,4.0,7/3/2012,"I want this to be my secret place, but it's too good not to share. Seriously kick ass decor, esp the basement. The doorman isn't a bouncer...he's a doorman... he's cool (read: not a douche!) - wonderful surprise. Please go to corner social so I can have this place to myself. Caveat: I only got a quick peak after John Lui's fundraiser. But I feel confident that it will not disappoint.Ps: no sneakers. Dress nicely.",15,2,3
181,Laura O.,"Bronx, NY",1,13,1,2.0,3/11/2015,"Though our party was late, we waited a considerable amount of time before we were seated.  We also waited about 45 minutes for a drink and even longer for our food, although we ordered five minutes after arriving.  The waiter could have easily have given us our drinks, as we waited for the seating since we ordered right away.  The food also took a very long time to come.  Once we were seated, it  was cramped and crowded for our large group.  At one point my friend gestured to the waiter to get his attention and he very rudely told her to hold on.  Overall, it was not a very professional atmosphere and I probably wouldn't be coming back.",1,,
182,J L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,41,6,4.0,6/23/2015,I went to have a good night out. It was clean and safe. The crowd is mild but festive.,,,
183,Dee J.,"North Riverdale, Bronx, NY",1,14,6,1.0,11/8/2015,"I stopped in on Friday night for late night eats around 11:30.  Upon entering we were told dining ends at 1:00 am.  Great we thought.  We were seated outside during the warm november night.  After about 5 minutes we were given 2 menus, meanwhile there were three us.  Ok no biggie we can share a menu.  After about 10-15 minutes our server takes our order.  Our party ordered the burger with cheese and 2 fish sliders.  After about 30 minutes of waiting the food arrives.  The fish sliders were cold and so were the fries.  It was either microwaved or reheated.  ugh.  Fried food should always be fresh. My friend didn't even eat the slider dish.  I was hungry so i ate my burger which was wrong.  I asked for cheese, didn't get it.  I asked for regular instead of spicy fries...didn't get it.  Basically our order was incorrect.  Ordered drinks...that too took forever.  We had no silverware or napkins.  We then ordered a couple of appetizers trying to get food in our belly.  We were hungry.  requested the shrimp and hoisin wings.  The shrimp waas so salty it was inedible.  The wings were cold.  I don't understand how you can mess that up.  I get that it was late but the customer service is not there and the food is not good.    Cove should invest in training their staff and finding a new cook.  Needless to say, i won't we patronizing this establishment again.",3,,1
184,Lovely D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,28,0,3.0,1/31/2013,"Very nice decor with a duplex set-up. Mixed drinks are well made and apparently they have a good food menu -  I have not sampled it the past three times I've visited.The only drawback-and for me it's a major one - wayyyyy too many women.  Was there last Saturday and a couple of weeks ago, on the Friday and there were like 15 women to 1 man. Can't control the gender of your clientele though.",1,1,
185,Melissa K.,"New York, NY",0,22,0,5.0,3/4/2016,"Great happy hour with delicious drinks and food ending at 8 pm. Recommend the sliders, although I wish there were more than one slider. Good atmosphere and I like the second (secret?) bar tucked in the back.",,,
186,Esmeralda G.,"New York, NY",15,41,20,5.0,11/4/2014,First time coming here and i loved it. The food was so delicious and fresh. I enjoyed my time here. Plus the happy hour drinks plus happy hour food is the perfect combo,1,,
187,R S.,"Warren, OH",0,9,0,1.0,5/17/2014,"Customer Service is seriously lacking in this place Security guards talk to people anyway they want and think it ok. I graduated from college on Ma y 10, 2014 with my Bachelors in Criminal Justice. Two of my cousins, her boyfriend,and myself went out for cocktails later that evening to celebrate. It was kind of rainy that night so the Cove was not crowded at all but my cousins tell me that normally its so crowded everyone's elbows are touching Long story short we where sitting at a table having $24 dollar Cosmopolitans that taste like cranberry juice the whole time this rude obnoxious security guard sees us. There is a nice downstairs area my cousin wanted to show me so we go downstairs to see the area and then a few minutes later came back up when we where abruptly stopped by this rude security guard (I wish i would have gotten his name and photo i would have put it in this review)anyway he rudely says to my cousin you cant run up and down the stairs we both looked at him perplexed and said you seen us go down and just now come back up so what do you mean running up and down the stairs and last we checked we where paying customers and do not see any signs saying you can not move from one area to another we then asked to speak to the manager which never happened. After that we refused to stay and spend anymore money in the place and went next door to the Lenox lounge where the drinks where excellent, the staff was very friendly and respectful, and the vibe and environment was very grown and sexy I will definitely return to the Lenox Lounge. We stayed until they closed great conversation, company, and music.As much as the watered down drinks cost in this place you would think customer service would be top notch I guess they missed that memo",3,1,
188,Yi Ting C.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",63,199,28,4.0,9/21/2014,"I've been to Cove twice, once for a birthday and another time to hang out for drinks. We chose Cove because of their dance floor downstairs (though a lot of people don't dance there, its nice to have that option) and the chill ambiance. I haven't had any issues with the dress policy like other reviewers because both times were a Saturday night out and my friends and I were dressed accordingly. Honestly, I prefer it to have dressier standards anyways...sneakers, etc just don't belong in a lounge on a Saturday night. A bar for sure but not at a lounge. We tried the spiced fries and brussel sprouts and both were amazing. I'd definitely consider trying their other dishes. Good music, food, drinks and friendly bartenders...what more could you want?",1,,
189,J D.,"Inglewood, CA",48,10,14,3.0,10/16/2014,"Cute place in the NEW Harlem. Went to see Jaz a well known DJ on a Tuesday evening. Was glad to hear it was happy hour. Cool vibe, well dressed folks enjoying an afterwork drink at the bar. I found the bar service to be quick, polite & professional. Went back on a Friday night @8pm n the joint was jumping,  really jumping. No place to sit which was fine. Again, despite the large crowd, the bar service was still quick,  polite & professional.",1,,
190,Queen T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,4.0,12/30/2014,"Cool afterwork cocktail and appetizer spot. The wings are really good.

I never ate here, no clue about the food but ppl seem to love the mac n cheese. Crowd is usually chill, more grown than not. Door guys can be stringent so use your head. I danced for like six solid hours because the music was that good, like I said best night ever....well one of the best ;)",,,
192,Billy J.,"Manhattan, NY",39,4,1,2.0,9/6/2013,Eh this place is whack. For the much much older crowed. I wanted to leave as soon as I got in. On to the next one. Lol.,8,5,
193,Shantaa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,18,34,4.0,9/18/2014,Fun Harlem lounge with pretty good djs. Great decor. 1st floor has a nice bar and lounge area. Downstairs has space for dancing and cool lighting. Will have to come back to try the food.,,1,1
194,Lisa S.,"Bronx, NY",56,26,0,1.0,1/13/2014,"Well the music was good, tried to get the attention of the bartender upstairs, no luck. moved onto the downstairs, pretty much same deal...hate to play the race card but we were a bit light for the scene. We went to corner social, scored a table promptly, ate drank, tried to go back to Cove to continue party, got treated the same, sokay saved my $ for stupid cover charge at red rooster :-p",2,,
195,Tanya R.,"Brooklyn, NY",403,318,137,5.0,7/28/2013,"Directly attached to another one of my new fave Harlem haunts, Corner Social, Cove Lounge is where it's at! Come to Cove Lounge to groove, flirt, chill and mingle after dinner at Corner Social or just come to Cove to do it all. My favorite cousin celebrated her birthday here this weekend and I'm so glad she did.  There were about 8 of us in our own white leather couch, reserved seating area dancing, eating, drinking and acting a fool. Our pretty waitress was very accommodating as we ""turned up"" on sesame wings, fried wontons, delicious specialty drinks and plenty of Prosecco. The DJ at Cove is outstanding...he definitely knows his craft! For three hours we were taken on a musical journey that included R&B, hip-hop, reggae, calypso, a little techno and some other goodies in between. There are two levels at Cove Lounge. The upper level is when you're looking for a little more intimacy and a lot less noise or you just want to get closer to your boo. Go downstairs to wear out your shoes, pump your fists and drop it like it's hot. Someone even started a train through the dance floor and I couldn't wait to jump on it. Choo choo!",4,2,2
196,Amber K.,"Manhattan, NY",88,121,8,4.0,7/29/2013,"Cove Lounge's happy hour is one of my favorites. You can get two drinks and an appetizer for $20! The shrimp and grits app was delicious and cured my soul food craving. Not too crowded post-work on a Wednesday: plenty of room at the bar, with a lounge area in the back and a karaoke room downstairs. Order the shrimp and grits and/or the brussels sprouts... AMAZING.

A bit pricey menu was ok only had one waitress working the room we in about that time about 30 people.im sure they can find more help.I might come back.IN the village for happy hour that drink would have been 5 dollars.And in Harlem drinks should not be that high in a lounge bareley heard the music. But loved my people who i partied with they made the party.",2,1,
198,Yvonne P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,2,4.0,9/14/2013,Love this place. Ended up here on a whim with the bf and another couple. Decor looks like what you would expect Harlem to look like urban/chic and inviting. Music was a good mix old/new/r&b/ hip-hop/reggae and some pop. crowd was for the most part 25+. Didn't give the place five stars because bar seemed to be understaffed and a bit of a mess. Took a while to get drinks...but hey it's to be expected on a busy Friday night.,4,,
199,Claudia C.,"Nassau, NY",52,25,32,4.0,3/29/2014,Music n food was GREAT N the faces were nice looking also lol! Everyone is fashionable n approachable even if they looked like date night everywhere in there!,1,,
