0,Scott B.,"New York, NY",8,171,204,5.0,9/12/2018,"Nice spot with outdoor seating and a big window for the summers.I hit this place for brunch and am always satisfied. The mimosas keep flowing for the wife and a great beer selection for me. Sometimes even bucket specials.The food is solid American fare. The biscuit and gravy bomb, a sausage and gravy wrapped in a biscuit deal is always a pleaser. The breakfast nachos (waffle fries instead of chips) is also a solid choice.The wings here I have gotten multiple times and always come out crispy. I like to do them plain with a side of both the sauces for variety.Service is usually friendly and attentive.",,,
1,Gabriela H.,"Louisville, KY",176,11,19,3.0,10/14/2018,"My boyfriend and I are visiting NYC. We are stating in West Village and we were looking for a near by place to grab a late dinner. The ambiance was pretty chill. My boyfriend and I ordered the calamari for the appetizer. I ordered the max and cheese, and my boyfriend ordered the Nashville Buffalo chicken strips. This place was not busy at all. There were many 4 groups of people in the same restaurant, but service was terrible. They had the bartender wait on all the customers.We got the calamari first. It was tasteless, very bland and greasy. I friend to add salt and pepper. My boyfriends Nashville chicken strips were ok. He finished his mean. My Mac and cheese was tasteless. And it was undercooked. I returned it and decided not to eat anything else.",,,
2,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,3.0,9/4/2018,"Tuesday evening, looking for a place to eat/drink outdoors. Although this bar had lots of people crammed inside, the outside seating was generous and sparsely used.Got one of the tiny table seatings for two and was quickly given menus by the waitress. Started off by ordering the Good Nature Farm Annie ($9) to drink - a hoppy bitter with a smooth finish. For food, shared the Avocado Salad ($14) and Impossible Burger ($16). Salad is your regular fare, a sliced up avocado sitting on top of a bed of greens with moderate vinaigrette dressing. The impossible burger is a nice variation from the normal veggie burger option. The ""meat"" is juicy and has somewhat the qualities of an actual hamburger, though the consistency/taste isn't quite there.Service is excellent considering the crowd. Was bumped a few times by people entering/leaving the establishment, so if getting seated try somewhere away from the door.",2,1,2
3,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,4.0,4/3/2018,"I enjoy halfpint for various reasons...1) pretty good selection of beer 2) I'm a big fan of the dim light setting 3) laid back atmosphere and a pleasant crowd  4) did I mention how good their selection of beer is?  If you're a beer snob such as myself then this is definitely a bar you want to try. Not your typical bar food as I've honestly enjoyed each dish I've had here.  Happy hour here is so chill and laid back which is a good change for your average rowdy HH crowd.  The bartenders are always friendly and talkative.  Happy hour comes with $5 beers with a decent selection of beers from their list, $6 well drinks and $7 house wine.  Good spot if want to hang out and catch a game (without sound).  The only negative about this place is sometimes it can get loud in there once it gets crowded which makes it hard to hear if holding a conversation.  I really enjoy this place for happy hour, a date, birthday events, Thursday night trivia and even for a week or weekend night out, so I recommend coming by to enjoy both the atmosphere and some good beers.",3,2,3
4,Aditya R.,"New York, NY",212,95,107,2.0,9/18/2018,"Not a fan of this place. They advertise themselves to be a brunch spot with drink specials, but fell short. I met up with a bunch of people to celebrate a birthday, so was excited. The unlimited drinks were very watered down, so we had to keep asking the waitress to give us more pours. At one point they ran out of mimosa so mixed my drink with another fruity one, actually tasted good so that worked out ;) The brunch food itself was very average but overpriced.  Also for a college brunch place, would've expected more TVs to watch all the Saturday games.",,,
5,Jeff B.,"New York, NY",22,99,130,4.0,9/29/2018,"A great neighborhood spot with outdoor seating and real pub vibe. Strong selection of draft beers, both main list of a dozen plus a 12+ rotationals. Had two new ones today for me, both fantastic: Burial Beer Bonedigger American Pale Ale (Asheville, NC) and BrewDog Jet Black Heart (Nitro) (Ellon, Aberdeenshire). And hands down the best BLT+avocado (key is the thick cut, buttered and brilled bread) and plenty of B&L&T.",,,

Updated review","Just visited the place again. The rudeness and agonizing posture from the waitress did not change. What did change was the fact that gratitude now included in your bill and you have no discretion about the amount. I guess instead of screening for a better service, they just show you the finger.In any case, i have disputed the service fee and got all back from CC - this is my finger to this place.",1,,
7,Sheeva M.,"Manhattan, NY",292,4,1,5.0,10/12/2018,"I went here for my birthday brunch last weekend. I had a large party of 18 people and the Half Pint was very accommodating!!! We all got the mimosa towers and our waitress was great at filling them back up. Not to mention, she gave us free shots!! The whole staff was very friendly and everyone had a great time. I got the breakfast nachos which were amazing. I definitely recommend coming here if you have a big party for brunch. Just make sure to make a reservation!!",,,
8,Jesica T.,"Berkeley, CA",211,1,0,1.0,11/1/2018,Drinks are pretty good but the service is terrible. Every time I've come here the bartenders and servers have been incredibly rude.,,,
9,Bea L.,"Crown Heights, NY",0,314,0,2.0,10/15/2018,"The food here was completely disgusting. Added chicken to my mac and cheese and thought I was going to throw up. Never thought I would say a mac and cheese is too cheesy, but it was. Gloopy and thick. And the chicken was clearly old and dry hidden in the cheese. Once you took a bite each piece tasted like a bunch of sponges. Tried picking it out but I was just so turned off. Drank my beer. Returned a dirty water glass. Waitress was hard to flag down. Just all around unsavory. Beer selection is fine, but nothing to be particularly wowed by. Wont be returning.",,,
10,Josh F.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",146,1,0,2.0,10/20/2018,Has so much potential to be a great brunch spot. Timer starts as soon as the base of the tower for mimosas comes but the mimosas themselves didn't come for another 15 minutes and if you need another tower within 10 minutes of your time they only bring pitchers over to fill your cups up. They advertise the deal so well but truly scheme you by cutting nearly a third of your time off. Great atmosphere overall just wish they would follow through with the deals they're advertising.,,,
11,Katharine S.,"Arlington, VA",352,588,461,3.0,2/13/2017,Came here for a beer/appetizer with a friend before an event. Overall positive experience. They had a nice selection of beers. We also got the calamari. It was ok....kind of soggy. Very small portion for $14..Our waiter was nice.Not a bad place. Just ok.,2,,1
12,Liza R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,30,11,2.0,3/11/2018,"When I lived in nyc previously, I frequented this place for years.While visiting town yesterday, I came in for drinks to celebrate my birthday. A friend and I were seated at a high top table and the waitress was perfectly nice and the drinks were good. My problem was the lady who appeared to be a manager who was moving tables around! This woman not in the black uniform like the other wait staff, very rudely came up to my table and asked me if I was using an empty chair. To which I said yes, as my friend was in the restroom. Upon then her seeing another high stool chair at the table with our jackets atop, she said ""What about that one?"" To which I said ""we have our jackets there"", to which she then without saying ""please"" or ""excuse me"" picked up a jacket and moved it onto my friend's stool, and said ""well, you can sit on it, I need this chair for another table."" I was absolutely shocked by her incredibly rude attitude, had she asked nicely I would have moved the jackets myself! This person absolutely needs to learn some customer service skills, as I have been here many times and never interacted with her before.",1,,
13,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,4.0,3/24/2018,"All in all, not a bad bar to hit up in the area. There's plenty of tables available. Came here for happy hour on a Friday--$5/$6 for beers, $6 well drinks and $7 wines I believe. The drinks had good deals but the food's a bit on the pricey side. For that reason, there are other places in the area that I would recommend over The Half Pint. I will say though, that the chips & guac were deliiiiicious. Something about the way they made the chips made them so crunchy and slightly oily and overall SO tasty. We also split buffalo wings which were meh--tasted the same as what you'd find at any other bar.",,,

I will definitely be going back sometime in the near future.",,,
18,Liz K.,"New York, NY",301,217,809,2.0,6/28/2017,"I had brunch at the Half Pint with a group of friends on a Sunday. While I appreciated the convenient location and ability to reserve a table in advance, we left unimpressed. I ordered the roasted squash salad brunch special, which arrived without any squash in it. I asked about it, and awhile later the server came out with a little bowl of diced squash but no explanation about why it was left out. The poached eggs were unsalted, messy-looking, and partially overcooked Two of us ordered coffee, which was fine but was never refilled. Also, it was unclear whether a refill would be included, as in the norm at bar-brunches and diners, or if it would mean paying another $2.50 for the second small mug of average coffee.Unrelated to the food or service, all of the seats were really uncomfortable. Half were simple stools, and the other half were along the window bench; neither had any backs or padding. Luckily we were all 20somethings and no one had a physical disability, but still felt quite uncomfortable after about 40 minutes. Most people in our group got the unlimited mimosas ($19), which is good for up to 90 minutes and therefore could be a decent value, but honestly I can't imagine sitting on a stool or backless bench for that long. Maybe it's intentional.Two stars because nothing was truly terrible, but we likely won't be back at the Half Pint to eat.",,,
19,Ava H.,"Las Vegas, NV",188,3,0,5.0,6/30/2018,"Visiting town, stables across this place glad we did! This place is great had the special of the day for brunch the breakfast mac n cheese and chicken and waffles. The host and waitress are pretty great too. Thank y'all we will visit again",,,

I didn't eat there for brunch but we popped in just for the towers and it was a bunch of fun. The bartender was super friendly and helped us have a great time! It's located right by Washington Square Park and NYU, so a super fun location and crowd!",,,2
21,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/1/2017,"(Review for brunch) This has become one of my favorite bottomless brunch places. It's the only one I've been to that serves the mimosas in beer towers which makes brunch MUCH easier when you don't have to flag down the waitress however often to get a refill on mimosas when you're trying to take advantage of the bottomless. I also find that the brunch food here is actually decent, better than a lot of the bottomless brunch spots. I got a BLT with avocado and it was very good. They make you put a credit card down for big reservations, but I think that's fair when a restaurant is trying to hold people liable so they don't end up with a huge empty table for 2 hours.",,,
22,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,3.0,7/13/2016,"I've stopped at this place many times of the years for a drink while in the area. I finally however dined here for lunch when one of my favorite restaurants in the area turned out to be closed.This place definitely has the feel of a ""nicer"" college bar, but a college bar none the less. There is a fair amount of seating and the bar area houses a good amount of beer.I've actually eaten here twice and tried a variety of things. The chicken sandwich was surprisingly good and is very filling. Their wings are fairly average, their Cole slaw is just ok and their salt and vinegar chips are good. I list all these things so as to show they have all the food staples of a standard bar and with the exception of the chicken sandwich, it's all very average. One gold star for this place is they do make a mojito that's made with pyrat rum. Score.Average food, standard bar, in a good location if you go to NYU.",4,,
23,Kelan T.,"Seneca Falls, NY",392,5,2,5.0,2/17/2018,I live 6 hours away from the half pint. I would literally drive here on a weekend just to enjoy brunch from here on a weekend. Vicky and her team do an amazing job.,,,
24,Stephanie J.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,3,0,4.0,9/8/2018,"I came to the Half Pint for brunch on Labor Day. There are a lot of restaurants in the area but the great prices drew me in to this place. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We ordered the chicken & waffles and breakfast nachos and some drinks. The drinks were very tasty but needed just a little extra kick of alcohol to them. We didn't get unlimited drinks but it was great that it was an option. The chicken and waffles were just okay. The waffle was a good size but not crispy enough. The chicken was just okay. Not my favorite. However, the breakfast nachos were AMAZING. So many flavors in one dish. I would definitely come back just for that.",,,
25,Julia S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",38,148,145,4.0,4/14/2017,"Cool place. They have draft beers of very original flavors and play very nice music. We went to have dinner during easter weekend and they have a special offer of a veggie burger, which was very good!",,,

Big fan of hers and she is definitely a great addition to this place. She is friendly, attentive and a good bartender.

Their draft selection has about 10 beers and a handful of bottles/cans. Decent selection (very IPA heavy), but they had a sour on tap so I was happy. I wish their tap selection was a tad more varied, but I was overall content. I didn't try the food so I can't speak to that, but the food selection looked good.

We have been here before for brunch and I usually go for one of the skillets but I saw that on the specials they had a Breakfast Pizza with buratta, asparagus, pancetta and a fried egg. This has to be one of the best pizzas I ever had in my life and I suggest to the manager/owner to consider putting this on the regular brunch menu. My wife had the French toast and enjoyed it as well. The service was excellent with him filling up our glasses and checking in with us.

37,Mireya H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,37,206,3.0,4/11/2017,"Well, the good news is, there's Good, there's Bad, but fortunately there's no ugly. THE GOOD: Comfortable place with low stools, high stools and high backed chairs at the bar. THE GREAT: It is SO hard to get a decent stout that isn't Guinness but this place has a nice selection (even though they were out of the Breakside Salted Caramel Stout that I wanted to try)THE BAD: Service? What service? The waitress informed us when she took our order that there would be a little wait for food since the kitchen was busy. No problem. She didn't tell us she would not be back to check if everything was okay OR to find out if we wanted another drink. Maybe there's a 1 drink maximum? Idk, but the guy who came to clear the dishes was kind enough to take my drink order.OVERALL: Not terrible. If you're looking to hang out and enjoy some Stouts, check it out.

There actually weren't many brunch spots open before 11am and Half Pint also offered 90 minutes of bottomless mimosas, which was exactly what we were looking for. We ordered the mimosa tower and powered through 2 of those before the end of our meal. Each person was required to order an entree when partaking in the bottomless option.

The waitress never came back to ask if I wanted anything else. I had to stop her as she was walking by to ask for my check so that I could pay to get out of there.

When our waitress returned to us a few minutes after seating us, she DID tell us that food might take a while because the kitchen was busy. ""No problem,"" we optimistically responded. ""Just keep the drinks coming and we'll be fine."" So we ordered our stouts and sweet potato fries. Drinks came immediately, fries shortly thereafter. And that was it. Waitress never came back. Busboy came by to clear the table when it was obvious our drinks and fries were done. We had to order another round from him. Oh well. Please note, the place was half empty. In the hour we were there sipping and munching on one beer and fries, customers did start to flow in...I can only imagine the service THEY got when it was actually BUSY!When it comes to this place, it's one and done for me.",,,
55,Mia D.,"Bronx, NY",73,26,7,4.0,5/24/2017,"The place was pretty nice. I went in on a Friday night. They have plenty of tables and 2 bars. The hostesses are friendly and will seat you if you need a table. They have happy hour until 7pm on weekdays and the food is pretty good. I'm not sure if I'll go out of my way to go back anytime soon, but I would if I'm in the area.",,,
56,Alyssa A.,"San Francisco, CA",586,261,876,1.0,5/31/2015,"I came here with some friends this past Tuesday. It's a cute little bar with your standard bar fare within a reasonable price. They have some good specials each night -- on the particular night we were there they had a bottomless wing deal for 10 bucks. So they would bring you 6 wings at a time and for each 6 wings you can try a different style. Some of the people I was with particularly enjoyed this.Why the one star? SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. We had 12 people and as students, we're hoping for split checks. Melissa (our server), brought us a check while people were still eating. When it came, she told us someone asked for it, although we checked and no one did. She then told us if we asked to split it earlier, she could have but now we could only do 4 cards max. WHAT THE HECK WHY??If you're looking for decent food and horrible service, this might be the place for you. Otherwise, try a different local option.",1,,

Came by around 5 on a Wednesday and we were sat immediately outside, per our request. Pretty standard NYC happy hour prices for drinks, but also running a summer special on select cocktails. My friend and I each ordered fries (I got regular and she got sweet potato) which came out quickly and were incredible and a huge portion. The service was great, the drinks were strong, and the staff was amazing. We will be returning!",,,
58,Kayleigh E.,"Smithtown, NY",0,7,5,3.0,4/18/2016,"I really want to give this place 4 stars. But.... Let me explain.I went here on a Sunday afternoon with 6 girlfriends for ""bottomless brunch.""Upon our arrival, The Half Pint honored our reservation and we were seated at 1pm on the dot. However, while the front of the restaurant was busy, lively, and bright, we were placed in the way back dark corner of the establishment. Fine. No big deal, my friends and I have a great time no matter where we go. The waitress sat 5 of us, and told us we has to wait for the other two girls to arrive (subway troubles) in order to start the bottomless brunch which was only a 90 minute limit. Again, fine. Once everyone arrives, the waitress comes over and takes our drink orders. They have you chose between a Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or ""Brunch Punch"" (prosecco, fruit juice, vodka, ginger ale). I tried the brunch punch, which was ""OK"" at most. I really wasn't a fan of it. When it came time for a second round of drinks, the waitress told us we could not switch our drink choice. I looked at her and told her very kindly that I really wasn't a fan of the brunch punch and just wanted to switch to mimosa. She hesitated at first, but then appeased me and let it slide. I was happy even though I didnt think the rule was appropriate.When it came time for food orders, 2 of my friends ordered the ""Waffle Sandwich"" special. After about 25 minutes, our food starts to come out with the exception of those two special orders. Our waitress was 1000000% blind to the fact that everyone at the table was eating except for 2 people. She did not come over and see how everything was, how the food was prepared, etc. My friends sat there food-less for 15 minutes. Beyond unacceptable.Finally this waitress comes over again for drink refills (which she needed to be called over for 2/3 times) and SOMEONE at the table has to point out to her that 2 people did not receive their orders. She responded with a dumbfounded look, and went to go check ""what was going on.""She came back and told us that in order to place the special order, she has to click a different button on the computer and that button was not working/being received by the kitchen. Fine. Not totally her fault..... kind of.By this point, all of us had finished our meals. The waitress asked if my friends still wanted their food (obviously?) if it could be rushed out. One girl said no forget it, the other was still willing to wait. About another 10 minutes go by and the waitress brings my friend chicken and waffles.This was not her order. My friend was very polite in telling the waitress that she was served the wrong order, and the waitress replies, ""Oh. I don't know if its me thats confused, or the kitchen thats confused."" Let me just stop right here. OBVIOUSLY, it was the waitress who was confused since she acknowledged the fact that my friend ordered the SPECIAL considering she used that as the excuse that the meal did not come out in the first place !!!This is now over an HOUR of waiting for the correct meal. All of us have been finished for a while, and this poor girl can't even get what she ordered. Finally, the correct meal was brought out to her. The waitress extended our ""Unlimited drinking time"" another 30 minutes, and she comped the meal that was an hour late, although my friend had to convince her to do so. Which in my opinion was extremely wrong. Overall, we really did have a great time, besides the fact that we were in the back room in a corner, and the service was exceptionally awful. Not sure if I would return considering I'm sure there are better places to go.",2,,

Our waitress asked us what tequila we wanted in our tequila club drinks and we said it didn't matter. I have no idea what she gave us but the tequila tasted so weird. Sucked them down anyway.

For the ""boozy brunchers"", you can enjoy unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and brunch punches (yea, don't get this) for $16. Since I wasn't in the mood to be buzzed at 3 p.m. this time, I opted for one drink and the Buttermilk Chicken and Waffle.

I just love the casual vibe, the reasonably priced beers (you can get these.. beer towers? if you're with a group for a good deal), and even the food I actually think is really good, especially for bar food. The appetizers are uniformly good, but I especially like the build your own burger-- SO GOOD.I also brought my dad here for brunch once and sat outside (there are only like two tables, so don't count on that part) but ever since, it's the only place he wants to go.Great place to grab a quick meal or some drinks with friends if you're in the area!",,,2
86,D L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,189,0,3.0,12/13/2016,"Went here because Amity Hall down the block was closed for a private party. Had the mac & cheese skillet w/ pulled pork, which was surprisingly filling & quite good. My pinot grigio, on a happy hour special, was just fine.The staff was very accommodating, making good recommendations and showing adaptability when we made changes & added guests. No stink eye when we asked for leftovers to be wrapped, so that's good, too. The only staff error, which is easily made & easily corrected, is that we gave 2 credit cards for the same tab & the amounts to be charged were reversed. Considering the place was packed on a Monday night, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. We sat at a table against the window. Those on the bench were smack up against a heater & ended up leaning forward & being uncomfortably hot the whole time. The rest of us sat on armless, backless stools & were uncomfortable because of that. By the time we left at about 8:30, the music was so loud we found ourselves screaming to be heard across the table.",,,

They have a few interesting titles revolving on tap, such as Troegs Nugget Nectar, which I've never seen served draught before (beer nerd checkoff beer). Some snazzy-sounding cocktails are also available if you're in the mood.I had a bratwurst burger with cheese fries, and while neither was life-changing, both were above average for pub grub. The lighting I thought was a tad too dim for the early evening hour, making every conversation feel unnecessarily intimate (depending on the occasion, of course). But I'm carping.

98,Jazmin W.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,42,16,3.0,2/7/2016,"Came here tonight for the SuperBowl after trying to check out Amity Hall which was already at max capacity. I saw on the website earlier that this was their sister restaurant and it's literally across the street and looked pretty empty so I thought ""why not?"" As I was still waiting on a friend to arrive.I chose one of the lower tables near the bar as it had a really good view of the tv. I was talking on the phone, so I understand why a waitress would not want to interrupt but she totally seemed to be ignoring me and I had to flag her down for a menu which should have been dropped when I sat down (she greeted me when I walked in and inquired about seating).So I finally get the menu and order the buffalo wings and fries, both decently priced for the portion and a bud light because it's cheap. I will say that this place does, in fact, have an amazing selection of beer. Aside from the fact that I'm not too into craft-y beers, I honestly just didn't want to spend a lot of money. The waitress takes my menu (which has food and bev options) and puts in my order. The food came a little too quickly, which was good because I was hungry but made me feel a littler unnerved thinking about how fresh it was. Wings were VERY MEH. They were just...off. I think the buffalo sauce just didn't go with the batter on the wings and they had a weird tang. Now I've eaten my fair share of buffalo wings and these were in the top 3 worst. I probably should have tried the sweet and spicy. Fries were meh as well and mostly just greasy pieces as opposed to actual potatoes. I finished what I could, got another bud light and waited for my friend.Other bartenders/managers were helping out a lot which was good because after a while I hardly saw my waitress. My friend finally arrived and it took forever to get a menu and then to order food. The waitress just seemed absentminded. And on top of that she would take the menu back every time we ordered something. I had to take it and place it on the windowsill so I didn't have to keep asking for it. My friend seemed to have enjoyed her nachos and had a Mackenzie's cider. I decided to go for a Lindeman's Framboise as a treat, but when I went to the restroom I guess the waitress told my friend they didn't have that flavor at the moment. So I went with an Abita purple haze for the duration of my stay.We get the check, and everything was good except me being charged for a...Lindeman's Frambois that they didn't even have... I brought this up to waitress (who couldn't even remember that I'd gotten a Purple Haze instead) and she proceeded to tell me that they were the same price...what?! I've had both of these at various places and I'm well aware of the average prices for each. Plus, I LOOKED AT THE MENU although she kept trying to take it. I let her know that that was not true, and I guess she didn't care enough to adjust it so she just took the Framboise off altogether and didn't add my last drink. It was nice of her, but she definitely didn't give off that ""I'm so sorry and going above and beyond to fix it vibe.""I'd come back here again if I'm in the mood for something other than the run-of-the-mill beers other bars serve but I probably wouldn't get the food again.",1,,

102,Erik C.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",215,22,9,2.0,12/16/2014,"I heard a lot about this place, after all, it is right next to campus. But, I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed in the drinks. I ordered a mojito, and it was definitely too strong that I just didn't enjoy it. I will give them back points on the whiskey sour, but then again, how hard is it to make one right? But the size of those drinks though... for at least $11 each? Oi.I created my own burger (medium rare with cheddar and sauteed onions), which came with fries on the side. The burger was okay, not the best, definitely could have been seasoned better. Also, the fries I didn't end up touching because they were soggy, lifeless, and leaking grease by the time I was done with my burger.On the plus side, the staff was nice and attended to everything that we asked for in a timely fashion. The execution of the food and drinks? Iffy... My friend and I spent about $50 each overall here, but I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1,1,
103,Maggie I.,"Milwaukee, WI",187,232,197,4.0,6/2/2013,"My friends and I were wandering around in the neighborhood trying to find somewhere to get drinks. The beer variety is great! There were a lot of great things on tap. I didn't have any mixed drinks so I can't speak to that. Also, none of us ordered food.The biggest plus of this place is that I went with a group of 9 people. They have something called a beer tube, which I had never seen before. You can get 96oz of Bud Light for $39. We all threw in $3 and each got a pint with a little left over. Great deal if you have a big group!There weren't a lot of people when we went, but we did go early. It was nice and clean. The bartender was pretty quick on getting our orders, but there weren't a lot of people there.Main complaint is that a can of PBR was $5.50. I'm from Milwaukee and I generally can pick up a 12 pack for $6. It was a bit of a shock, but I suppose those are the price differences.",,,

Updated review","Half Pint is a great bar because it doesn't try too hard to impress you. it has the fundamentals of a good bar, and that's why it's a keeper: lots of space, great beers on hand, excellent bartenders, a kitchen serving good pub food that's open late, and sometimes even a DJ.they even let you reserve space if your group will be big enough - props to the staff for helping with that!fairly recently threw a little get-together event for some college friends, and while the competition was fierce for which drinking establishment would receive our patronage for such a rowdy and epic army, ultimately Half Pint won out. glad to see it is still as awesome as I remember from the last time I came, maybe a year ago. memory's a bit hazy, yanno? the DJ was pretty good, phasing in more awesome and cheesy 80s tunes as the night progressed to balance out the mediocre modern music he was playing earlier. no night is complete until a remix of ""I Wear My Sunglasses At Night"" comes on! it certainly got people up and dancing...or maybe it was the well-poured drinks that the bartenders were slinging. maybe a little of column A and a little of column B!convenient to get to - almost much every subway line in the city and the PATH train all stop right nearby.",3,2,3
106,Mike O.,"Brooklyn, NY",210,1721,570,4.0,2/18/2015,"I had many pints at this place. Sierra Nevada on tap. Dang.Came here to meet a friend. We had lots of drinks, and only a little foods. We had a pretzel and maybe the cheese curds. Both were excellent. But it was not enough food. I have a test pattern image on my brain for the rest of the evening.There are a lot of NYU students, grad and undergrad here, as you can imagine. The service is good. The place gets increasingly busy as the night wears on. Apparently it's ""cliche"" to go here if you go to/work at NYU. Not being one of those people, I did not see it cliche at all. Nice little bar.",,,
107,Katelynn A.,"Queens, NY",0,7,0,2.0,3/26/2017,"Good beer selection and atmosphere earned this place 2 stars. Prices pretty typical for the area and the food is just average. The service here was awful, waited 30min to get the check. Would not come back.",,,
108,Gerard P.,"Staten Island, NY",276,372,5,3.0,11/17/2015,"This is a quaint little spot close to Washington Square Park which I had never heard of until this past week. I had no idea this was a bar/restaurant-I thought it was just a pub-so I was caught off guard when I saw seating in the rear. Even though I didn't order any food, I can attest to the good service and the hospitable atmosphere. For a sports bar, the noise level was also very reasonable. The prices are a bit steep, but that's Manhattan for you.",1,,
109,Coralie C.,"Elmont, NY",36,17,1,4.0,4/24/2016,Ordered the burger and it was just okay but everyone I came with loved their food. They got the chicken and waffles and breakfast nachos and they were so happy. This review is more based on our server Mary who was bomb.com she filled our drinks up every 5 minutes and was legit the most attentive server ever! She deserves a raise (to her boss if you see this). I had an amazing time and enjoyed myself!!!,,,
110,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",449,1226,32,4.0,8/3/2012,"I came to Half Pint for the first time a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend and some of his college friends. Half Pint reminded me of the late, great Choice Kitchen & Cocktails which was my favorite watering hole for several years.  It has a laid-back atmosphere, an enormous selection of drinks and is the perfect place for a large get-together with friends.  I was particularly partial to one of the shots I kept ordering (both for myself and others) that tasted like mocha.  I can't find the name of it on their website but I think it had the name Dixie in it?  Well, regardless, it was delicious...and strong.  Exactly what I wanted.  While I thought the DJ could have been a bit more creative with his musical stylings (he played ""Call Me Maybe"" multiple times), it didn't stop me from dancing, although the drinks may have had something to do with that!I don't get to this part of town much but between bars like Gizzi's and Half Pint, I  should probably change that!",1,1,2
111,Kyihara A.,"Newark, NJ",1,5,7,4.0,11/8/2014,I came here for their bottomless brunch. There were several people walking around making sure your glass was never empty for long.

112,Adam K.,"Baltimore, MD",104,334,571,3.0,1/19/2013,"While Manhattan's not normally my scene, I found myself meeting some friends at this wonderful pub in Greenwich Village. I'm so glad they recommended it.Let's start with what ""Half Pint"" got right: Buffalo Calamari. BRILLIANT. I couldn't decide if I wanted buffalo wings or calamari, why not calamari in buffalo sauce? No bones about it. Loaded fries are pretty standard; they were perfect to go with late night beers.Areas for improvement: WAY too loud with the music. I shouldn't have to shout to the person across the table so they can hear me. It was also rather dark, way beyond a pleasant dim ambiance.The great beer and cider selections on draft is respectable. Unfortunately, they were out of some of the seasonals that sounded really good.Our waitress was very friendly, patiently answered our questions, and gave her own recommendations. To sum up, I'd go back.",,,

114,Priti K.,"Jersey City, NJ",582,536,706,4.0,11/15/2012,"There's something about this bar that I love. It's spacious, doesn't get crowded, and beer towers are available! A few of my friends stumbled into this place to watch the first presidential debate this year. I think it'd be great to watch the World Cup (I'll have to keep this in mind if I'm not in Rio or Sau Paulo myself, but that's neither here nor there). Their beer list is written on a scroll that never ends! They have everything from Bud Light and NYC locals to beers from 16 different countries. The crowd was pleasant. Service was good. We returned a few weeks later. I can't comment on the food, didn't try anything.Simply, Just an awesome, chill spot to get together with your buddies and watch sports (or talk politics? maybe)",,1,1
115,Jacky D.,"Jackson Heights, NY",73,101,10,3.0,8/22/2014,"This is a pretty standard bar with nothing out of the ordinary, either bad or good, that I  could see.  It's steps away from Washington Square Park, so this bar probably feels like with a location like that, they don't have to try so hard.  This bar probably has more to offer that I just didn't experience - I saw ad advertisement for their bottomless booze brunch, and I might be a bit more exuberant with this review if I had gone for that instead of a few happy hour drinks. My friends shared some buffalo wings and they gave them good reviews (I didn't try them). I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place, but if I were in the neighborhood again, I'd probably prefer to try out a new bar.",1,,

119,Jake K.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,3/23/2015,"I live nearby and drop in to the Half Pint on a regular basis. Kenley, the rock-n-roll, awesome bartender, always makes a great drink, has a fun wit, and makes sure my food arrives in a timely fashion; plus, she changes the channel on the TV for me occasionally :-)  The food is also consistently solid. I typically eat the brunch food; go for the eggs benedict, the hollandaise is more than acceptable. The food I have had in the evening has all been respectable as well. Remember, it is a bar and not a 4 diamond restaurant and all will be good.What could be better than this? Well, since 1/2 Pint is in Greenwich Village and offers a bottomless brunch, it draws a fair number of younger and/or B&T clientele. Most of the kids and even the majority of the B&T are  genuinely alright folks, but some of them are a bit lacking in what is reasonable behavior. Often, their lack of class just let's the rest of us make snarky jokes at their expense ;-)Credit to the management for hiring a solid group of staff. As a whole, all seem to be quite good. They regularly exhibit a pleasant demeanor even in the face of obnoxious customers. Having walked more than a few years in the shoes of a server, bartender, line cook, and dishwasher, I know first hand it is not always easy to be pleasant to annoying customers, but the 1/2 Pint crew pulls it off. Of course, don't take this comment as license to act like a jerk.Last, here's to hoping the management will eventually realize this restaurant is located in The Village aka Greenwich Village and not the West Village as their carpet at the front door claims. You can't be a W. Village beer bar when you are east of 6th Ave, y'all :-)",,,

My dearies who have been wondering where I've been- well you should know that I tore my shoulder ligament (labrum) from  too much pole fitness. Silly me. Sad to say, I will never be able to aerial dance again but hey this should be for my never-to-written blog, so I'll stop. (though any friends who are in the field of medicine, message me I'm scurred!)My latest food adventure at the Half Pint in my 'hood came to me when I discovered  Hoo Deals. What I like about Hoo is that you can buy an unlimited amount of deals per table- so, if you feel like 50% off burgers, you and your friends can all revel in the savings. That's exactly what me and my bf fellow Yelper  did. $6 for $12 to be used on burgers and fries at Half Pint and sister resto Amity Hall (yay for choices) We'd tried Amity once before (ooh stuffed burgers) so we wanted something new and tried Half Pint. I would actually have to say Amity was better but discounted food always makes things sweeter. Maybe it was an off night. Walked in with no problems and got a nice corner table around 7 on Wed (deal can be used from Sun-Wed). Our waitress was really sweet, prompt and patient-- she had no qualms with the deal and didn't gawk at the fact that I was wearing a sling (a relief). She didn't also scoff at the fact that we wanted no drinks (no alky for me for all the painkillers I'm on)- though bf raised his eyes in approval at the whiskey offerings. The environment was much quieter and better than Amity. There isn't a whole lot of burger selection, but enough to feed everyone. Veggie, turkey, football player sized, chicken... yes chicken. Jerk chicken. This is what bf got and it was yummy. Well seasoned with really good mango chutney and guac. Standard side greens.I got the turkey. It was juicy and big but not as tasty as the chicken. Not too much seasoning but good corn and salsa. I was a bit upset that my plate didn't come with shoe string fries (as said on the menu) but hey the standard thick cut are still good with salt. Love fries. Not sure about return factor- but def worth a try for the drinks; try Amity's stuffed burgers next door.",2,,1

137,Shea D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",109,547,88,3.0,11/9/2013,"(3.5 stars)I've been meaning to try this place after spending several nights across the street at Amity Hall. My understanding is that the Half Pint is owned by the same person (people?) as Amity Hall. I stopped in while waiting to head uptown for a dinner party, and ended up having the chicken sliders and two pints. The sliders were good, but a little pricy. Beer selection is also good, but again, a little pricy compared to across the street...FOOD: pretty diverse menu options, and you should be able to find something in either the appetizer or entree options depending on how hungry you are. Since I was headed to a dinner party a few hours later, I opted for the chicken sliders under the appetizer menu. For $10 I received three sliders. The chicken was cooked well, but the bun/cheese were nothing special. Felt like this was a bit expensive for what you get.DRINKS: impressive selection of both drafts and bottles. Unfortunately their happy hour special seems somewhat limited in scope, so my Blue Point Winter cost me $7 and a pumpkin ale (forget the brand, but it wasn't a high end one like Southern Tier) cost me $6.50. Again, a bit pricy ($7 for a Blue Point? really?). Additionally, they do much better with happy hour and pricing across the street at Amity Hall, so I definitely think I'll stick with Amity Hall whenever I'm down in the area.AMBIANCE: this is where Half Pint has Amity Hall beat. Very cool vibe inside, and didn't strike me as the big NYU hangout that Amity can be. I liked the layout with the bar immediately ahead of you when you walk in and a more general dining area off to the left.PRICES: if you've gotten to this point and don't know how I feel about this, well, you haven't been paying attention. Compared with other places in the area, the Half Pint has marked up its offerings just enough to be noticeable. For a pre-dinner party stop, nearly $25 (pre tax and tip) was a bit much for an appetizer and two pints. Especially compared with other offerings in the same area.",2,,

This place is damn straight playa with their tap beer selection. Over 20 beers on tap - and a damn good selection it is!Chimay, Delirium, Lagunitas, Bluepoint, Stella, Sixpoint, Sierra Nevada, Harpoon, Leffe, Goose Island, Radeberger, Duvel, and so many more great brews to chooose from on tap and in bottles too. You can spend days here sampling their kick ass beer options.The place itself is pretty big and seperated into two different bars, some flat screens, decent music playing (no jukebox), seating spread throughout on both sides, and a nice pub menu. A few in our group ordered some pub grub - wings and some other things - and said they were really good. It's actually a very nice bar overall.Still, this is the type of place to go for the beer, and kick back with some friends to enjoy a few different samples. Not really a spot to be considered a hook up destination. More like a pre-gaming or end of the night spot. As for the beer - try all 20 or so of them on tap if your heart desires!

The atmosphere was nice and it was easy enough to get a table on a Sunday at noon. Basically, don't go out of your way to eat here for brunch.

Mostly adults having lunch when I went on a Friday afternoon, not too packed.  Kind of empty.  The food was amazing.  I had the turkey burger and french fries, which was absolutely to die for.  Turkey burgers are amazing!  This place needs more customers.  They make you feel like you're at home.",1,,

One of those bars where the beer list is stellar, but just about every other thing about the place is mediocre.

Good beer alone does not a beer bar make.",2,1,

Updated review","Last week I was back at the Half Pint and once again this place proved to me why this is the nicest bar in NYC and why I love coming back. At this place you will always find a good beer, good food, nice people at the bar and really friendly staff members! Nothing beats sitting down at this bar after a nice alk through the city and enjoy a nice cold beer while meeting other people there. They also server the best hamburger in NYC. You will find ""Best burger"" advertisements all over the city but the one that is really the best is served at the Half Pint, fresh and juicy.Already looking forward to go back in June",,,
151,Deedles P.,"New York, NY",33,52,0,1.0,7/1/2013,"I have worked in the restaurant business for 9 years. Last week I had the worst experience I have had at a bar in NYC to date. I was there for a going away party. The minute I walked in, I had a woman yell at me and tell me that I couldn't stand where I was standing because I was blocking her way.  Ok, well then you shouldn't have put a party in an inconvenient spot. Everyone was more than willing to move over when people walked thru, as anyone would in a bar...it's called manners, well apparently that wasn't enough and she continued to yell at our party. So then, I proceed to the bar to get away from being yelled at and to get a drink. The waitress chases me down and tells me since I am with the party I have to order from her. I told her that the party tab was over, I wanted to start my own tab and hang out at the bar. She told me I had no choice but to order from her. Even though I was wanting to sit at the bar, with my friend and not even be a part of the party. Made no sense. And she was so rude about it. Insisted on taking my credit card and telling me how they don't pool tips. I get all that, but I was wanting to sit at the bar and she basically stole from the bartender and forced me to hang out in an area I didn't want to be in. Just so she could make my $1 tip on the beer. Apparently she needed that pretty bad.Regardless, I wasn't the only one that was grossed out by their behavior. I overheard a few people in the area all talking about how aggressive the employees were. Let's be real Half Pint, you are a bar. A bar in the village in NYC...not the Ritz Carlton. Chill out a bit...",1,2,

The sliders took forever to arrive, and I was sitting at the bar, just a few feet away from the kitchen window. I had to ask the bartender what was going on and it seemed like the kitchen had just plainly forgotten about my order. The bartender was nice but when you've waited half an hour for some sliders  and when they arrive they are less than stellar, it would be nice if the bartender could at least offer you a conciliatory beer.Unfortunately that never happened. This whole area suffers from turn and burn service and somewhat jaded wait staff in my opinion. It's definitely not an excuse for bad service though.

I like the seating in the bar area.. lots of small tables & stools, windows (that open in spring/summer!) and sunlight (during the day!).

Updated review","The Half Pint, for me, was my first ever NYC Brunch experience, and it did. not. disappoint. The ambiance was incredible. They have TVs showcasing Sunday Football and I didn't need to shout to have a conversation, which is a real struggle at other places. Half Pint did an excellent job maximizing square footage without compromising personal space. It was, surprisingly, not as busy as I expected and Erin and I were seated almost immediately. We were greeted by this super bubbly waitress named Sarah who suggested we try the brunch punch (all you can drink for $18.. duh) and, holy guacamole, was it amazing. Prosseco, gingerale, muddled raspberries and strawberries served in a champagne flute. The service, for the entire duration, was amazing! We never had to wait for a refill on our punch, which was both good and bad. Bad because we couldn't keep track of how many we were drinking and good for fairly obvious reasons if you're into fun, drunk, Sunday's. We are. I digress. Let's talk about the food: Great selection of menu options, they truly have something for every palette. Erin ordered a skillet and I tried their breakfast burger with fried egg and bacon. Woof! Everything came out, timely, with awesome presentation and tasted even better. I think the thing that sealed the deal for me was that we were never rushed or felt like the staff needed or wanted us out. I had an amazing time in an awesome environment that served quality food and drink at a reasonable price. I highly recommend the Half Pint as a great way to start your Sunday and I'll definitely be back to try their traditional menu and to check out their selection of Scotches. Cheers! Jordon, out.",1,,

They are served in an actual miniature skillet which while cute, is annoying and slightly challenging to eat out of. Pretty average brunch offerings, nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either.

176,Payam Z.,"Toronto, Canada",218,432,137,2.0,12/3/2010,"The Half Pint has a good space and great potential for a good bar in the touristy Greenwich area, so I'll cal this an interim review until I give the place another try (this review is based on my second experience). To start the rant, I expect all places boasting such a large beer list to have the top selection from Germany and at least a few decent brews from neighbouring (CDN spelling) Canada! Instead, aside from not serving Hacker Pschorr (my fav beer, and inarguably top 3 brews from Germany), their only selections from Canada were Labatt (actually a Busch label) and Canadian (ironically a Coors label), both of which are crappy college-grade beers. As a suggestion, Blanche de Chambly, Alexander Keith's, and Moosehead are many folds over better representatives of Canada if you are going for the generic brands!On to the next part (and I swear I wasn't being this snobby while at the bar), the beer my friends ordered didn't arrive for a good 10 minutes, and in fact mine did not arrived at all. To make things worse, after bringing the pints for my friends the waitress did not return for 30 mins, and needless to say I went to pick something up at the bar instead. This is totally fine, except in situations where you tell your patrons that they will be waited upon if they sit at the tables in the front of the bar!Finally, for such a large space, 1 or 2 washrooms are not enough, and making them unisex was not a good idea ( this is worse for the ladies of course).On the bright side, Half Pint carries a lot of great American brews and Belgian brands, and if it wasn't for the crappy service, they would have gotten at least 3*! Prohibition Big Daddy is a great IPA from Northern Cali and I was pretty happy to see it on tap in New York!",,1,

Everything's dark wood. It's a great place to sit and talk with friends over a very, very wide selection of drinks. (and their mixed drinks are great, too!)Food: Sigh. What can I say. I have NEVER been disappointed. It's regular pub food on a whole 'nother level. I've been here for brunch and dinner. Their wings: huge, juicy, crispy. Their burgers: I get randomly cravings for these bad boys (the half pounder). Soooo juicy. So much flavor. Fried calamari in buffalo sauce? Yum! I recently had their pizza and that was so good too!

Amity is more of your typical sports bar (awesome) and this place seems more like your typical drink and party place. So all in all the owner of these bars is doing a great job at capturing everyone's perfect amount of drink(age) and party(age).Last time I came here it was a typical Friday. Packed per usual, there was a fiesta going on at Amity so we went to the Half Pint. We found ourselves some chairs by the bar and all in all had a good time having some drinks.

190,Daphne M.,"ASTORIA, NY",66,247,97,3.0,11/27/2012,"3.5/5 The Half Pint is an excellent beer bar, boasting a long menu of various beers. I hope that's what you're there to drink, because it's one of its best aspects. It helps that the place is spacious and the service was really friendly, attentive, and overall fantastic while I was there. I came for brunch, and they had a sweet offer of $12 for unlimited Mimosas or Bloody Marys for the remainder of your meal/brunch hour. Considering that some places (like Cafe Orlin) charge something like $9 for a single mimosa, this is a steal. Just drink two and you've already made out well. Note that it is just a big pitcher they're pouring from.I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which was okay. Nothing stand out about it, but the potatoes it came with were really disappointing. Kind of dry and cardboard-y, I didn't bother to eat them. For $10, you get the two slices of English muffin topped with the Canadian bacon, poached egg, and Hollandaise sauce. Nothing unique here, just standard and expected.Good brunch spot if you're not in the mood to be impressed by the food, but great spot if beer with friends is what you want.",,,

Updated review",Walked in to have a New York City style brunch and was blown away by how amazing the food and service was. I came in with friends from out of town and they were just as happy as I leaving. This brunch was AMAZING and Stephanie J was a huge factor to keeping my friends and myself full and happy. I WILL be back!,,,
195,Alyssa S.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,9,0,4.0,4/19/2016,"Very cute little place right by Washington Square Park. Went for a friend's birthday brunch and they did a great job accommodating us. Our waitress was very on top of the ""bottomless"" drink refills and we all were satisfied with the food. The only thing that their website does not say but their menu does is that the ""bottomless"" brunch is only for 90 minutes. But trust me, that's all you need! Mimosas were strong (in a good way!) and the waitresses have a very generous pour. If I find myself in the area, I would definitely go back!",,,
196,Angela R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,4.0,9/4/2013,Friendly bar with outdoor seating. Mixed crowd.Had a few dished off the menu and had no complaints - solid bar food.Pleasant to sit outside and people watch as life in the village goes on.,,,
197,David M.,"Seattle, WA",6,12,0,5.0,2/1/2014,"Incredible Bloody Mary's and fantastic service. Had the Bacon skillet with wheat toast. Away from the big crowds, but still feels like New York. Huey Lewis playing in the background. Go Hawks!",1,1,1
198,Sandee L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",236,494,105,3.0,2/12/2012,"Good place to hang out, but not so great if your intent is to watch a major sporting event.  Lots of flatscreens around, unfortunately none big enough to seriously watch the action.The buffalo wings were phatty.  They must have been on 'roids.  Crunchy outside and moist inside.  Pretty good, but the ""hot"" wasn't very hot at all.",1,1,
199,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1701,2743,655,2.0,11/13/2009,"Known as an NYU Stern bar.  Plenty of small tables and a tiny bar space... not really meant to handle a large group (10+) of people coming in for a post-class drink.The staff wasn't particularly helpful with seating or accommodating our large group, so we ended up moving over to another place later in the evening.If you have a smaller group, though, you can grab a seat on the dark wooden tables and a beer. There are quite a few different kinds of bottled and tap beers here, but charging $3.50 for a tiny can of PBR and calling that your ""special"" is a joke.  At least the regular beer selection was decent.",4,1,1
