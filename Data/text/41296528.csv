Drinks are cheap but they don't make up for the poor service and judgment. Will never return and strongly encourage another place if you're in the area!!",

Took a girl there for a first date, so didn't want to argue with the bouncer when they said 'they knew nothing about the internet,' even after I showed them the ad. We had come out of our way to come to this show, so I didn't want to turn back.They still charged me $40, along with 14 dollars for two small seltzers.We left at 11:45, and the show still hadn't started.So literally spent over 50 bucks to sit in an empty bar over an hour.If this place is trying to drum up business - they're doing a terrible job. They should have honored the ad, not charged 7 dollars for a seltzer, and had the show start at least remotely on time. As a queer person who used to organize parties and frequents queer entertainment  - this party is not promising. You should not be charging for a show that no one goes to. It is disappointing to the people who actually show up - and word of mouth is your best advertising, trust me.Will not be coming back, and will be telling the same thing to my friends.",11

Bartenders as themselves do not make drink right. Martini without olives black label coke with the coke  plus a $20 cover charge where I saw many other people escape with stupid reason not to pay. Mandatory coat check $3. This is midtown save your money.,3

First the door man was incredibly rude as I walked in no greeting just 10 dollar cover , as I pulled out my wallet his first response was No cheapskates allowed in the bar; I haven't been in the bar for 1 minute and I already got a bad vibe. The dancers here are very aggressive and are semi disrespectful. The bartender Carlos at first was so nice and helpful but after I got a round of drinks and tipped him , his response was ""Only 2 dollars, this is such bullshit."" After sitting on his phone for 5 minutes as I tried to call him and When I finally got his attention his response was ""WHAT DO YOU WANT!?"" I was so taken a back cause of the sheer level of disrespect I was shown as a customer. The men's bathroom was out of order and everyone was using the female bathroom which has no doors on the stall which I've never seen. The sink was clogged up and when I told a bus boy , he took time to address the problem with the sink and even asked how I was doing which was refreshing cause at this point I thought everyone who worked here was rude. I LOVE Adonis but after my short visit in New York I will not be coming back and do not recommend coming to this bar. A bartender should never be rude to a paying customer.",13

They explained to me what it was, and were hesitant to bring me not really knowing me all that well. When I walked through those doors I felt like I had dressed in my finest outfit and had been working out for weeks - I hadn't, I just ate a slice of pizza with garlic bread and I'm pretty sure i had a decent chunk of mozzarella cheese stuck in some of my teeth. Anyways, I now know what its like for a woman to walk into a country bar. The bartender was really friendly and poured me a generous cocktail. I saw him pour soda but I didn't actually taste it. I guess that's the charm here :) walked further back and there was a nice area with a giant sextional (see what I did there) type of couch where kind gentleman could show their Uninhabited interest for one another.Walked in the backyard for a smoke and was courted by a nice gentleman in his 50's. It was a completely different world to me. But I liked it. Everyone was super nice and I didn't feel like anyone was judging me. (they were)",4

It really was that powerful.I don't know if they had a toilet blow up earlier or something, but we didn't even get a drink here.

It's only after several weeks that I finally decided to drag my ass all the way to Midtown in the rain on a week night, thinking to myself: this better be good. Well, it was! I suppose there isn't too much to say about the bar itself: pretty large, a bunch of couches and low tables, a nice patio in the back. The drinks weren't very cheap but not too expensive either ($8 for my Absolut Citron and soda), and they were pretty strong too. The crowd is definitely a little older than in EV or HK, but people seemed friendly for the most part. Now about the Porsche show: I can't say how much I enjoyed it (thanks Billy for introducing me to her!). Finally a drag queen that knows how to be funny without being a total bitch (ahem... Bianca and Mimi...). And she knows how to sing. No, seriously. You have to hear it to believe it. Great show!",9

38,13,6/4/2008,0,4,"Long Island City, NY",Brian M.,0,1.0,1,"I am writing as a regular reader of your website who is aware of your sensitivity to gay rights, human rights and the human tragedy of HIV and other STDs in general.  This evening I visited a gay bar that happened to be convenient to my subway ride home:  OW  Bar on East 58th Street in Manhattan. (I guess formally named Oscar Wilde Bar).  Well, I'm sure Oscar is rolling over in his grave to have heard the indignities uttered there tonight as ""entertainment.""  Around 11pm, two drag queens performed for a while.  Although their singing was passable, one of them saw fit to include an AIDS joke (unfortunately, I don't recall its specifics) in her routine.  When this drag queen stepped aside to the bar to sip her drink, I approached and informed here that her AIDS joke was not funny and that she should apologize.  She muttered agreement.  A while later, she announced that someone didn't like her AIDS joke, but then she added to the offense with a syphilis joke.  I booed loudly - not difficult since the rest of the audience seemed oblivious.  The ""barback"" or cocktail boy then told me that I'd have to leave.  I asked, ""Since when are AIDS and syphilis jokes funny in a gay bar?"" and he responded, ""They're drag queens so it doesn't matter"" and that I'd have to leave.  I waited five or so minutes to indicate my non-cooperation as protest, then resolved to send this message as an alternative.  I don't know if you get involved in these somewhat petty disputes, but I believe that what transpired marked a sad demise to whatever gay community there is in New York.  My personal grievance was that the drag queens were asking bar patrons to identify whether any bar patrons had June birthdays.  Wednesday happened to be June 4, the birthdate of my brother who died very early on in the AIDS epidemic in 1985.  I was only 24 at the time and as my eldest brother and gay brother, I've lived ever since with the regret and remorse of not having been able to do anything as a brother to diminish his suffering.  Today, in my own small protest, I feel I took a small step to vindicate his suffering.  In 1985, despite my own family's unfailing support, he suffered greatly.  The management (I don't mean to pin the blame on a hapless and inappropriate ""barback"") of this establishment needs to be made aware that this kind of ""humor"" is unacceptable in the gay community.  Too many of us have been witnesses to unimaginable suffering.  More importantly, HIV continues today to be no joke.  It is regrettable that what I had entered as a place of some small refuge -- a gay bar -- brought back to me instead, on my brother's birthday, the full depth of my grief over his loss.  I cannot have been alone tonight in OW Bar in this.  The management needs to understand its social commitment to making a safe place for gay men and women to congregate.  Otherwise, without some kind of public acknowledgment that it is a safe place, gay men and women should not commercially patronize such an unsafe space that in its own way perpetuates through thoughtless ""humor"" the AIDS and STD epidemics that we all know persist unabated in New York and elsewhere in the gay population.",22
