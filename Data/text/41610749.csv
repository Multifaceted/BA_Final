0,Ale H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0.0,5.0,9/30/2018,This place is amazing. I'm a NYC foodie. Lived here for years and try to come back every couple of months so I select my restaurants very carefully. The vibe is incredible. The food is amazing. The service is fantastic and actually ALL attractive. The music is just amazing.,,,
1,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4006,4.0,11/3/2018,This coffee kiosk in Astor place has a cool logo and very good coffee.  A large coffee for $3.25 seemed to be a very good deal.There are tables and chairs in the public area nearby if you want to sit down.Pastries were around $3.25 each so I passed on that.  The kiosk looks like a dark brown wooden house and I believe it faces cooper square.,3,2,3
2,Riselys N.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",248,100,272,5.0,9/13/2018,"I've been to MUD twice because of a recommendation from my friend for brunch. Brunch is great here especially if you're on a budget, you get to pick anything off the brunch menu for $19 plus a beer or mimosa and coffee or orange juice. I've had the biscuit sausage with sausage, eggs & cheese - DELICIOUS! I've also had the breakfast sandwich and that was delicious too, paired with avocado - YUM! my favorite item from MUD is the coffee though. The coffee is delicious, and now I know why I see empty MUD cups all over the East Village, haha. Littering is still not a good thing guys, but woah! This coffee is to die for. The staff is really nice too, think of this place as ""hipster."" What I love the most is also the atmosphere of MUD. they have a great outdoor space with cute seats and vintage fixtures which makes the place feel ""homey."" I'd recommend this spot to anyone wanting a great cup of coffee or breakfast on a budget!",2,,1
3,Jennifer T.,"Washington, DC",53,236,131,5.0,11/2/2018,"Loved this spot! Very friendly service, outdoor seating in the back, very limited seating indoors. It seemed like the kitchen was more a kitchenette and  right up front. It's takes a while for the food to come out so if you're in a rush, just have coffee and go elsewhere. The huevos rancheros was great and adjustments were made to make it celiac friendly. You do come out smelling like food so I think the place doesn't have great ventilation. But great decor! I would return again!",,,1
4,Zack G.,"Saint Louis, MO",160,78,52,4.0,10/15/2018,"Coffee shop with funky/hipstery vibe that serves alcohol at night. Seating at tables or bar indoors, and in enclosed patio outdoors. NO WIFI!! Solid food. I customized an omelet (which has a max of 4 toppings) and it came with a choice of side and 5 grain bread.  I got a salad as my side and it was pretty generic. Good coffee in large mug. Fairly fast service. Very tiny bathroom that you can barely fit into. 8/10",,,
5,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,5.0,7/28/2018,"I give rare, 5 Star ratings when I'm blown away by the service and food of an establishment. This place well deserves their 5 stars! Service is impeccable! I'll elaborate on this later. Food, INCREDIBLE! I ordered the brunch meal- banana pancake with fresh OJ and iced black tea in lieu of coffee for $19.50. Banana pancake: holy moly omg I would put positive, profane words in here for how mind blowing it is!! The banana is oooey gooey greatness and the actual pancake is an incredible texture! It's crisp and the edges are divine! The fruits on top make it even more dynamite, as does the real maple syrup. I'm drooling thinking about this. Fresh OJ is good as well. Service? I can't believe how good they are. We waited very long for our food (pancake and huevos rancheros) that we thought they forgot our order. People who ordered 30 minutes after us got their food. When we inquired, they apologized, explained that my banana pancake takes a while, and then offered us complimentary mimosas. Incredible customer service! I asked for the rest of my food to go, which they did promptly. As the restaurant was mostly empty and I was burning from the sun at my table, I shifted to the empty table. I didn't expect them to, but the instantly came to me and started moving my drinks and such to the new table. How kind of them! I asked for a bag for my takeaway and the guy walked away to do so and even had it waiting for me at the front of the restaurant. Thank you guys for an honestly superb experience. Between the scrumptious food and the top notch customer service, I'm genuinely impressed and left on banana cloud nine.",,,
6,Gloria Z.,"Hempstead, NY",135,373,2123,4.0,5/11/2018,"Brick walls, wood floors, tin ceiling. Narrow, dark and really cozy. Ceiling fans. Chill music. Big mug o' drip and they put the milk in for you. Your own bottle of NYC water, best in the land. No place mats, no pretense.Table service is pretty prompt and the staff were friendly. Just head past the tiny front counter (unless you want to sit there) and make eye contact and they'll find you a table.Coffee was fresh and frothy, not a trace of bitter.Not really for groups bigger than a foursome and not a place to bring your children, ok? I had scoped out the menu photos ahead of time so I knew I wanted the Avocado toast with eggs. It arrived in about 10 minutes and was excellent. Yolks were runny and the smashed avocado was fresh and plentiful. Those chili pepper flakes really made it sing. Quality breakfast and large coffee under $20 including tip.Loved the little single use bathroom, so punk and so small. Also clean and well stocked. There's a bench outside to wait your turn.  Fuhgeddibout Starbucks. Dive in here for breakfast or a cuppa & you'll be glad you did.",6,1,6
7,Ben S.,"Cambridge, MA",596,73,97,5.0,5/21/2018,"Awesome spot for weekend brunch!MUD's brunch menu is a flat $19.50 and includes a choice of OJ or a mimosa and comes with coffee alongside an entree. Upcharge to get coffee iced was only 50 cents which I appreciated, and the coffee and (fresh squeezed) OJ were great. Bit of a wait but wasn't worse than 10 minutes for a party of 2 at 12:30 on a Sunday. Took some time to get the food, the kitchen is small and the place was packed so can't blame them. Scrambled eggs weren't dry at all and loved the multigrain toast. Will definitely be back even just to grab coffee from the to go counter, great atmosphere and I'd love to post up here with a book or computer when it's less busy.",2,,
8,Jenny C.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",56,79,175,4.0,5/28/2018,"I came here with my brother and cousin on Saturday and the wait was sort of crazy. It was already 1:30 in the afternoon and we still had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table. The waiting area in the front was really small so it got cramped really fast. When we finally got seated we were led to a small area in the back where there were more seating. Let's just say it was cramped and hot. All that being said the food was really good. I had the huevos rancheros and it was the perfect bite of rich egg and avocado, crispy tortilla, chewy rice and beans and fresh pico de Gallo in every bite. My brother ordered scrambled eggs with onions and bacon. He raves about the onions. It was cooked perfectly so it was tender and sweet. It was the perfect match with his eggs. Food from the brunch menu comes with drip coffee and a choice between an alcoholic beverage or oj- we just ordered the oj but it was still worth it. You have the option of getting your coffee iced or hot. Please tell them you want milk and sugar while you are placing your order.I highly recommend this place for a small party of 3-4. Just keep in mind that it may be a little tight.",,,1
9,Ahmed F.,"Manhattan, NY",6,98,161,4.0,6/4/2018,"This has been one of my favorite coffee shops for many years in NYC. The decor is just so unique and unexpected for any out of towner. Coffee is solid. They make the real macchiato not the fake one :)However, their best coffee drink is their latte with sugar. With sugar is what makes it good. They actually mix the sugar with the espresso which makes it better.Their desserts are quite decent too. The warm brownie sundae and the banana bread sundae is also great.The best part is they are open very late. So if you are craving late night coffee, this is your spot.",,,
10,Rory M.,"Nashville, TN",114,315,940,4.0,4/9/2018,"MUD was the perfect spot for a cozy breakfast on a gloomy Friday morning. From the outside, the place looks small, but there is a larger seating area in the back that has a comfortable cabin feel to it, though the tables are very close together. We each started off with a hot mug of their signature drip coffee. The coffee had a good, strong flavor, and their mugs were amazing. To eat, we each had one of the ""bowls"", however a lot of other dishes on the menu were very tempting, but not K for P. We both really enjoyed our bowls, which were reasonably priced, big, filling, and healthy! The egg yolk on top was perfect to break open and mix in with the quinoa for a delicious glob of goodness!EGG, QUINOA & KALE PESTO BOWL // Quinoa mixed with the flavorful kale pesto, topped with walnuts and a sunny side up egg, and added avocado. This dish had a lot more flavor in the quinoa than the other one, and the avocado was a good addition to add more protein to the dish. It was divine!SWEET POTATO BOWL // This one was a special! Quinoa was topped with roasted sweet potato cubes, black beans, avocado, a sunny side up egg, cilantro, green onions, and a drizzle of sour cream. The sweet potatoes in this dish added a heartiness to it, but the quinoa could have used it's own seasoning like the Kale one did. Still an excellent dish!The only thing lacking during this meal was the service. I understand it was busy, but our server was inattentive. It was hard to signal her down to order and pay, and other than that we didn't hear from her.",1,,1

I predate MUD, but have never stopped in until this year because my girlfriend wanted to try this out.I never would have thought that the food here would be delicious, but damn was I surprised. I had the most amazing grilled cheese with avocado and bacon with a side of rice. Holy sweet mother of god, was this grilled cheese heaven on a plate. The prices were decent for the portions and I am looking forward to trying more of their menu.",,1,

Updated review","This place has a special place in my heart, and for all the right reasons. I particularly love their weekend brunches, for I find the brunch options to be varied and all delicious, servers to be very friendly and the place to be charming with a mini garden to boot. Brunch goes for $19.5, it comes with a brunch item of your choice, a tap beer or mimosa or a freshly squeezed OJ, plus a drip coffee ( you can pay the difference for a latte upgrade or other drinks) I opted for a smoked salmon bagel( they source from Tompkins sq bagels) and I could choose my bagels: regular, sesame or everything. I really appreciated the extra options.The bagels came perfectly toasted and the smoked salmon was top notch. My fellow diner ordered the chicken salad and she loved it. It had a generous portion of grilled chicken, goat cheese and toasted almond flakes with sliced oranges and grapefruit. Thank you for being such a great addition to the East Village community!",,,
13,Kristina B.,"New York, NY",63,211,130,4.0,7/6/2018,"Firstly, only retracting a star because there were little to no vegan options. That said, the customer service was chill, kind, polite;the best. KlI had the special, avocado with pink sea salt toast, which was filling and delicious. Dog friendly cafe, so my old chihuahua sat on my lap while a friend and myself ate. Love to see this place thriving after so many years of going here when I was a young high schooler.",1,,1
14,Jon W.,"New York, NY",3012,290,1008,5.0,11/27/2017,"Brunch at its best!This place is brunch done right with it own special unique ambiance, delicious food, and friendly waitstaff.When I took a step inside this narrow shop for brunch I knew right away it was going to be good. It seemed like an old school coffee shop and I went straight to the bar for a seat. The baristas working were super cool and got me a coffee right away which was full of flavor and did not need any sugar. Now lets get to this awesome brunch menu is full of some awesome entrees and comes with your choice of 2 of beer,mimosa, Juice (OJ/Grapefruit), Coffee. The waitress said the huevos rancheros, banana pancakes, and almond crusted french toast were popular so I went with the french toast and grapefruit juice. The juice was clearly fresh squeezed and tasted fresh and delicious. When the french toast came out it almost looks like a pancake. It was completely covered with almonds cooked in and a mixture of fruit on top with the perfect amount of syrup. Every bite was a delicious new experience with a different piece of fruit from a strawberry or blueberry or apple.In short:- Delicious Food (Great Brunch)- Strong Coffee- Friendly Waitstaff- Cool Spot- There can be long wait times for brunch",17,3,12
15,Huilin C.,"Manhattan, NY",29,59,82,4.0,1/6/2018,"Came here for brunch on a winter morning. The food we tried are good.Pros:I recommend bagel and smoked salmon. It's simple and delicious. They are very generous on smoked salmon.It has a ""backyard"", it's more spacious.Cons:The coffee is bad. They don't have a nice coffee machine to brew with coffee beans. Seek picture attached.Backyard is not as warm as inside in winter.",,,
16,Jessica T.,"Arcadia, CA",430,228,801,5.0,4/26/2018,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this little coffee shop. I'm from Cali, and was visiting NYC for 36 hours, and within those 36 hours, my best friend took me to 3 coffee shops. This was the last one we hit before boarding our flight and I'm so glad she took me because they had THE BEST LATTE I'VE EVER HAD. I'm not a great coffee person, so you might want to take my opinion with a grain of salt, buuuut I've had a lot of lattes and this was one that did not compare to any I've ever had. I swear they put some magic powder in it or something.... I got a regular iced latte, with some simple syrup added. I also got a bag of ground medium roast to bring home (which I am so happy about). I think if you buy a bag of coffee, you get a free coffee (I just paid for the difference since I got a latte). But now I wish we had a Mud in LA.YAY FOR MUD COFFEE (LATTES).",5,,2
17,Dana K.,"New York, NY",13,72,65,3.0,6/27/2018,"Went for brunch on a Saturday. I didn't know there was a fixed price brunch menu but went along with it. They offer you coffee, a choice of beverage, then your meal for $19.50. My boyfriend and I both got fresh squeezed orange juice. For meals he got the almond crust French toast, and I got the make your own omelette. Everything was good except he noted the dish was too sweet (syrup is added to the dish already when it comes out) while my omelette was like any other omelette. Probably won't be back but service was friendly and atmosphere was nice albeit tight.",,,
18,Adeline C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",266,67,55,5.0,7/3/2018,"A delicious place to stop by for breakfast/brunch!At 9am on a weekday, there was no wait to get a table inside MUD. The front of this store is a functioning coffee shop, while hidden in the back are a handful of tables for you to enjoy their full food service. I ordered a Maple MUD and a two egg scramble with goat cheese and sausage.The Maple MUD coffee consisted of maple syrup added to the store's signature drip coffee. Tasty twist on an otherwise classic coffee. Onto the main dish, these eggs were FANTASTIC! Never has a simple plate of eggs tasted so good. The eggs were scrambled to perfection, maintaining a creamy texture alongside the goat cheese and sausage toppings. The multigrain toast was simply the tastiest bread I have had the pleasure of eating. This is the first bread I've eaten that was packed with such dimensional flavor. Mixed greens topped off the plate, adding a nice balance to the meal.If you find yourself in East Village, I would highly recommend stopping in for a meal.",,,
19,Jennifer A.,"Flushing, NY",296,321,501,3.0,5/13/2018,"First I want to talk about the bathroom. It is literally the size of a refrigerator. Upon using the toilet, your face will literally be inside the sink.Next, I ordered an affogato and I highly suggest they change it up because I kept choking with each spoonful. Presentation was poor and the bowl they use prevents you from slurping down the liquid. The spoon they give you prevents you from drinking much, and when you try to eat the ice cream while drinking some of the espresso, you will inhale the powder and cough. I had the hardest time enjoying this dessert. I had to ask for a straw to drink my affogato. The people I was with were also confused with my dessert and felt bad for me.We also tried the buttermilk pancakes at 11 pm. It was ok. Fruit on top was fresh.The music does not match the atmosphere either. It went from country to oldies to rap. It is cozy though. Thats all. I wouldn't come back.",,3,

21,Rucha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",428,174,211,4.0,9/26/2017,"A solid favorite of mine since high school, MUD never fails to keep me happy with their strong coffee and delicious brunch. It's a tiny hidden spot like most places in the East Village, with a portion in the back that used to be outdoors but is now like a little sun room. MUD is great for brunch or even a late night glass or wine or beer. Brunch is prix fixe at $19.50 (I long for the days when it was cheaper), and is served with OJ/Mimosa and a special MUD coffee. I have had many of the brunch options, including the Almond French Toast, Lox on a Bagel, Huevos Rancheros, and Banana Pancakes. All sweet dishes come loaded with fresh fruit, and everything is decently portioned.Try to sit at the part of the building that's actually in the building when it's a hot day, because the fans don't always cool it down in the back. On my most recent trip, I had the breakfast burrito (loaded with scrambled eggs and cheese and pico). Very delicious. Come here to eat the food and check out the tiny bathroom!",5,3,5
22,Phoebe W.,"New York, NY",548,323,803,1.0,3/24/2018,"Yikes. I usually wouldn't bother reviewing a place I haven't eaten at, but the service was bad enough here that I felt it worth mentioning. My friends and I came by for weekend brunch at 11:30, the place was packed and we were told a 40 minute wait. While waiting, the restaurant door kept opening and closing due to people pouring in and out. It felt disorganized, and management and certain customers kept yelling at people to shut the door. We ended up stepping outside to wait.After the 40 minutes had passed, the host that we had put our name down with came by and said (in the most impassive voice too, might I add) that he just then seated another party that had arrived after us because our whole party wasn't there. Bummer, he said. Huh? The three of us were standing right there. When we told him this, he claimed that he had glanced out the restaurant window 10 minutes prior (and amongst the busy crowd waiting) had only seen 2 of us, not 3. My friend simply had walked a few feet down the road to take a phone call well before our reservation time was up, and the host, instead of calling our party's name and actually speaking to us, had just skipped right over our names. Lovely service you have here MUD!My friend then asked how long the wait would be, and he shrugged his shoulders, rolled his eyes, and said, ""another 20 minutes maybe, I don't know."" I then mentioned that we'd have appreciated him acknowledging our party before skipping over our reservation entirely and he said, word for word, ""I did what I did and here we are."" Taken aback, my friend then gestured for us to head across the street to Veselka instead, and the host, still lingering for whatever reason, went, ""you guys can go to Veselka, see if I care."" Hahahaha what? Do you want people to eat here or not? I'm honestly appalled. Veselka is exactly where we went! And I hope everyone who reads this review does the same! I don't think I've encountered such rude service, ever. While the food at MUD certainly looks good, the poor management doesn't make a visit even close to worth it. Stay away!",6,3,2
23,Annie C.,"Philadelphia, PA",339,122,187,5.0,10/29/2017,"Came here with local friends. This place is a must try place in East Village for ridiculously delicious and reasonable brunch. For under $20 you get an entree, mimosa/OJ and coffee/tea (the slash is ""or""). Not to mention the unexpectedly large portions. Service is fast and efficient with friendly servers. Highly recommend both the entrees that we got-huevos rancheros and the out of his world almond crusted sourdough French toast!",1,,
24,Almaria B.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,81,656,4.0,3/27/2018,My first time going to MUD after hearing such good things about this place.  My first impression was it looks small but there was lots of room in the back which made you feel like you are outdoors with the glass ceilings. Although a bit loud when crowded it has such a homey feeling. The menu has a wide variety of options to pick from and the food is as delicious as it looks . The coffee is to die for and oh so delicious. I will definitely be coming back.,1,1,2

Door way is small, and you walk in and get welcomed by a smiling barista working hard and making orders for both indoors and take a ways. We sat at the bar, as were were not locals and wanted to watch the action. If you would like you can ask to be seated in their internal glass encased backyard at the end of the hallway.Their decor matched the feeling of being on a beached patio but in the city. I ordered coffee and my other half a tea, but we got the brunch menu which the buscuit breakfast sandwich and their special sauce. YUMMY. Portions were large and well work the dollar amount. No one seemed to be waiting too long and the amount of organization we saw to get orders out the door and in from indoors was incredible. They made time to make conversation with us which was great. You do have to wait to be seated so be aware. Its worth the wait. But if you cant, just take to go and try another day.There is a reason for it to be so busy and you are waiting!Menu had tons more options and I was told that it turns into a local pub/wine bar in the evening, which would probably be amazing as well. As non locals, since brunch is our favorite meal, we have nothing to complain or regret! If I lived there, Id definitely keep going back.",,,

34,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,310,372,4.0,8/27/2017,"This place is located in St. Marks area and great for brunch. They have a decent size selection for brunch and for $18.50, there is an entree, an oj,tap beer OR mimosa and coffee (but for someone like me who doesn't drink coffee, they were kind enough to swap it for tea). We were seated quickly after our arrival at around 11:45AM. They have an indoor seating with dimmer lighting and an outdoor-sy seating. The outdoor seating didn't have any AC and had fans (which didn't blow in our direction). It was slightly warm since we just walked in but as time went on (since today wasn't excessively hot), the temperature was just right even without any fans. However, I would not recommend this on a hot, humid summer day (cause it would definitely suck).  And our waitress quickly brought us our water and came back quickly to see if we were ready to order. Attentive!My friend ordered the salmon with a plain bagel (they had a few types they ask you to choose from) while I ordered the huevos rancheros. We had a side of home fries to share as well. Overall, I felt that our food was good and the sunny side eggs were cooked perfectly. Loved it when I poked into it and it oozed out. The huevos rancheros was a little spicy but it made it perfect. Loved the taste of everything together. But the rice felt odd - a bit crunchy (undercooked maybe?). And the smoked salmon was good too but can't comment as much. The home fries were done well and everything was very filling altogether. When I was done, the guy was ready to take my plates so nothing would be in our ways as we continued to chat and hang out with our drinks. It's great that they don't pester us out too. The other downside was how small the bathroom was. It was hard to maneuver inside but at least today, it was mostly clean (but the lighting wasn't the brightest so it was hard to tell). The trash was also overflowing with paper towels so .....yeah. But I would love to come again to try their other foods!

38,Van N.,"New York, NY",87,3,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"While the food might have been good, the service doesn't justify it. I come here frequently for brunch and know how packed the place can get. However, when I followed up with the waitress on ETA since I've been waiting at my table for over 30 mins, she corrected me that it's been only 23 minutes. We were about to leave when they finally brought out the food and shamed us into packing them to go because it's wasteful. Maybe I'll try this place again in 6 months when I forget about this terrible experience.",,,

I admit, I like a caffeinated punch and this is a left hook without any bitterness.Now on to the food, healthy, organic, fantastic fare. Momma K had watermelon gazpacho and i, an egg salad melange with plenty of pesto, avocado and egg. Go for the coffee, come back satisfied for the soul!",,,
40,Ibania C.,"Brentwood, NY",209,99,185,5.0,5/16/2017,"I read about MUD online and I was Immediately fascinated. This has to be the cutest brunch place I have ever seen. Definitely worth the visit. The menu is not wide in selection, but the items they offer are all great choices. The food was very delicious, I had the Huevos Rancheros. They also serve Mimosas for breakfast... how could you go wrong. Pricing is fair, not complaining. CASH ONLY! You will have to wait to be seated unless you go extremely early !",2,,

Most likely you'll have to wait to be seated , but it doesn't take that long , I guess we waited for 10-15 min.Service is very friendly, place is sooo cozy and you can have a nice brunch talk with your girlfriends!Portions are very big and everything is delicious!For $19 per person you'll get a brunch dish ( huge!) , you'll get hot drink ( tea or coffee) and you'll get cold drink ( orange juice or mimosa)!I love the place and for sure will be back !",,,
42,Chad R.,"New York, NY",232,473,8,5.0,9/15/2018,Just came for coffee and a snack (nuts). The coffee was exceptional as they did it up with maple syrup and whipped cream. Even the peanuts were don't just right. Loved the ambiance and the menu looked delicious. Definitely coming back.,,,
43,Ioana H.,"New York, NY",147,34,38,4.0,8/24/2018,"Decent breakfast. Huevos rancheros were a bit dry, avocado special was good.

44,Alan N.,"New York, NY",284,230,808,5.0,6/25/2017,Absolutely one of the best French toast place. It's an almond crust over sourdough bread. I absolutely love it. Took my girlfriend here and she really enjoyed the food. It is a bit pricey for brunch. $19 for an entre and two beverages each. Would come back for that French toast though.,,,
45,Chelsie N.,"New York, NY",184,78,188,4.0,9/1/2018,"I love the outdoor seating in this place. Always a wait but it moves quick when I've been there. Their $20 brunch deal is awesome - you get an entrée plus beer, mimosa, or fresh OJ, AND coffee. Today I went with the granola bowl, which sounds basic, but is unbelievable. The granola is perfectly crunchy and toasty with a hint of sweetness and the fruit on top is fresh af. The omelettes are really good as well, however the home fries could be a little crispier for my taste. The buttermilk banana pancakes are yummy and big and would definitely recommend for something sweet.",,,
46,Julie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",805,52,92,4.0,6/8/2017,3.75/5 stars Stopped by on a cold winter break for a coffee pick up and tried their Maple Latte (not sure if this is a seasonal thing) and it was really enjoyable! I liked how it tasted and would come back for brunch.I wished their bathroom was bigger. I am a very petite girl and even for me I felt super cramped in their. This place seems like a hole-in-the-wall type of a restaurant and is smaller then most brunch places. Which is why the bathroom might be so cramped. Do not bring a group here for brunch because it would be hard to accommodate.,,,
47,Lauren L.,"Manhattan, NY",105,114,14,3.0,4/3/2018,"I've been to MUD a few times for their weekend brunch. Every time I walk out I have the same feeling, which is ""that was alright!"". Between the food/atmosphere, it's really nothing special yet the consistently long wait tells a different story. I came this past weekend around 12:30ish and waited almost an hour to be seated. They do a fixed menu for weekend brunch, and it's an okay deal if you're getting the mimosa. If you're getting the orange juice (I don't even like orange juice) its just fine. It's ~20 bucks and you get a mimosa or oj, drip coffee, and a meal. I had the burrito and added bacon. It was okay! My bf had the omelette. Again, it was okay! My coffee wasn't even as good as I remembered it to be. Vibe is cool if you're in the back. If you're not, it's just a dark restaurant with decent background music.",3,,
48,Ami A.,"Charleston, SC",222,162,147,5.0,4/21/2018,Mud has a cult following for good reason. It started as a food truck and has a little coffee shop located across the street from the famous Velseka Diner (LES/East Village). The coffee is addictive and the chai lattes are out of this world!,1,,1

The drinks were great - chai tea latte was perfect and I loved the OJ - but the food was meh and definitely not worth the long wait for brunch. My sourdough French toast was overcooked and the chicken sandwich (mudman special) was average at best. Huevos rancheros were good but the rice and beans were bland. Service was absolutely awful and for the place to be cash only at these prices is ridiculous. Won't return.",,,
50,Jonathan S.,"Boston, MA",1,6,0,5.0,5/8/2018,"We were heading uptown to catch a bus to Boston and decided we had time for brunch. We checked Yelp and decided on MUD. I should note that we were carrying 2 suitcases and I was recovering from hip replacement surgery so I was walking somewhat painfully and with a cane.We were greeted politely but told it would be a 45-minute wait for a table. We asked about sitting at the bar and were told we could have seats at the bar in 5 minutes, which we did. They quickly found a place for our suitcases, and made sure I was OK with the bar seat.The brunch was spectacular. Their brunch special included an excellent mimosa, followed by great eggs (for me) and a wonderful bagel with lox for my better half.We trundled off happily to the bus and decided that our brunch was a high point of our weekend.",1,,

Very rude and unprofessional.,,1,
52,Eve V.,"Denver, CO",82,179,30,4.0,5/12/2018,"Delicious coffee!! We didn't realize that the back was service only after we'd already ordered coffee at the front.

54,Jenny J.,"New York, NY",426,104,207,4.0,2/25/2017,"I came with my roommate for brunch at 10:45 am. No wait, and I would venture to say that if you have a party of 2, there won't ever be a long wait (most tables are set up for 2). It got more packed 45 minutes later.The servers were nice; I always like it when all are open to helping you, instead of an assigned server. My friend wasn't a fan of the set price $18.50 for drink and food. I agree, as $18.50 is a bit much, but she got to enjoy both tea and orange juice. I chose the omelet with a side of home fries and avocado + sausage topping. What I received wasn't really omelet, more like scrambled eggs with sausages mixed in (still good though!). Friend got smoked salmon with bagel. The tomato slices were too big, in her opinion.This establishment is really...narrow. Also, the only bathroom in MUD is so small that the sink is in your face when you're on the toilet, and you can't sit straight down onto the toilet (you have to maneuver under the sink). SMALLEST bathroom I've seen in my life. Wait for food was kind of long too, about 20 minutes. However, I did enjoy the food and would definitely come again!",2,3,2

This place is a little on the smaller side, like most places in NYC but the French toast pics drew me in. My boyfriend had the Banana buttermilk pancakes with a Stout beer and I had the Almond crusted French toast with a mimosa which was BOMB. The service was friendly and prompt. We'll be back for the avocado toast!",,,

57,Susan W.,"Denver, CO",86,132,7,5.0,5/12/2018,"This is just such a great spot for brunch!We've tried a bunch of items off the menu, and all of them have been yummy. I especially liked the Egg, Quinoa and Kale bowl with avocado. And the Mudmama salad with a fried egg also stand out.Weekdays it's way easier to get seating than on the weekend, for sure. Great vibe regardless of how crowded, just a different feel. No wait and tables in the main room for the weekdays - on the weekend, it's a long wait even with a bustling back room. The food is good though, so if you're visiting on the weekend, just don't come to wait in line really hungry.Remember cash only :)",,,

59,Andrea W.,"Brooklyn, NY",161,1942,1007,3.0,7/23/2017,"Very meh. I came with a friend for brunch around 11AM, and we waited for about twenty minutes. This was summertime so it wasn't the most pleasant outside, yet there was no AC! Anyway, we were handed the brunch menu when we sat down, and I got orange juice, Argentinian tea (last one on the tea list), and the huevos rancheros. The tea was very very very light and didn't have much flavor. The orange juice was fresh-squeezed so that was nice. The huevos rancheros was very average, and I felt I could make it at home. The food was just lukewarm and nothing had a lot of flavor. It was very bland and just not very tasty at all. Not to mention the portions are quite small for the high $21 post-tax price. Definitely not the biggest fan of this place!",3,,2

The restaurant is always packed and there's always a line outside. I ordered the B. A. T. = bacon, American Swiss cheese/ Avocado? And tomato. The home fries were cut too big for my preference, didn't have much flavour. But the sandwich was amazing. Will switch to a side salad next time. They have a single table in the corner with a light and flowers. I will definitely be back to do work or just sit and read a book. Very relaxing atmosphere. I think I just found my Friday spot.",,1,
61,Erick S.,"Staten Island, NY",17,30,24,3.0,7/31/2017,"I was here with a party of four and decided to base my rating on everybody's take about the place. 1. Food: I'll start by saying that 3 out of the 4 were happy with the food. Their buttermilk banana pancakes are a must have. 2. Ambience: Hipster. I, personally, liked their set up. Although I must say that 2 people complained about the lack of AC during summer time and the tiny bathroom. However, I did not base my final rating on this. 3. Beverages: They have okay coffee and good mimosas. 4. Staff: Now, this is what I mostly based my review on. If you look at any of my past reviews, I don't judge restaurants by one or two mistakes made by a server and I believe in having bad days. However, our server wasn't particularly happy about our table for some reason. I'll start off by saying that one of us ordered an Italian soda and quickly changed her decision and called the waiter to let him know that she had changed her mind and that she wanted a coffee instead. The waiter just looked at her and left. Then, he comes back and tells her that her soda was already served and if she'd like to take it. Of course, she said yes, expecting that he would bring the coffee after (even if she had to pay for both drinks) but he never brought the coffee. Strike 1.Somebody else in our table ordered a coffee and decided that he needed some sugar. He called the waiter to ask for sugar and the guy just stared at him as if for some reason he thought that the request for sugar was nonsense. Strike 2.And strike 3 was that he never made eye contact or tried to look nice, not even once. He just dropped the check at the end and left. Not a ""have a good day guys"" or ""thank you for coming"" at the very least. Overall, I greatly recommend this restaurant because I personally enjoyed the food and the ambience but our personal experience wasn't good because of this server. I won't mention any names because I don't believe in putting people down, but I do hope that this great restaurant sees this review and encourages their waiters to try and put their personal problems behind when at work or at the very least make eye contact and be courteous.",2,,
62,Felix B.,"New York, NY",119,64,23,4.0,8/1/2018,"Decent option for brunch. Mostly for the patio and the good coffee. Food is pretty good, not great. But as a result the wait is usually not too long, which is a definite plus these days.",,,

65,Cavin L.,"Santa Ana, CA",56,14,8,5.0,8/18/2018,This place is a GEM it is honestly the highlight of my New York trip so far I loved the ambience of the place and the staff were very nice and friendly and looked like they were having a lot of fun working. I had the all day brunch which was 19.50 and had options I got the granola bowl and a mimosa and an iced coffee. I would totally come back here if I ever went back to New York,,,

My wife and I come here once in a while but often get odd attitudes especially from people behind the counter. Luckily Veselka was across the street.

67,Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",298,623,1257,5.0,7/26/2017,"I'm super happy that our travels made MUD our neighborhood coffee shop. We came here 3 times in a week during our stay living across the street. Their coffee is phenomenal and their avocado toast with olive oil, pepitas and red pepper flakes was the bomb. Two pieces of thick wheat toast, piled high with smashed avocado; its huge. And you can even add fried egg on top of the two slices if you're feeling really hungry.You can either place a to go order at the counter in the entrance or head towards the back and be seated in their charming dining room or in the backyard bungalow. The outdoor seating area is larger than inside and there is covering but I'm not sure how waterproof it is. If you don't want to smell like food, I recommend you sit outside. Service is great. The food comes out fast and we loved it.",1,,1
68,Scott M.,"Vienna, VA",113,187,1170,3.0,3/10/2017,"Great drip coffee, best part about this place.  Service is mediocre and the food is pretty standard.  They do offer an ""all day brunch"" for $18.50, choose an entree, and beer/mimosas or coffee/OJ.  Most of their entrees are $10-14....Great deal in these parts. I would definitely return for the coffee",,,

Visited on a rainy Sunday morning for brunch and did their great brunch combo (entree, coffee, and choice from OJ, beer, or mimosa). Went for the almond sourdough french toast - it was such a unique twist on the classic french toast - couldn't really taste the sourdough but definitely got the almond flavor, which I loved. It was a hefty portion, so definitely something you could consider splitting with another person. The coffee was strong and tasted great (looked like their lattes and espresso drinks were super popular - you could order these to-go as well). The service was friendly, and it was cool watching the baristas doing their thing while sitting at the bar. Will definitely be back! Want to try other things on their menu and check out that back patio when the weather is nicer...",,,1

We were seated in the back room but it was pretty loud (can barely have a conversation) cos there were no windows.We both ordered salads, (kinda on a diet lol). Gf had the love salad and i had the citrus chicken salad.

We chose the fresh OJ, very good!I had the chai latte with soy milk and gf had the mud mocha. Their drinks are really good.

74,Jamie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,76,13,3.0,5/22/2018,"I've come here with Tess who sat totally erect with her pursed mouth and orange locks and white face. Raw enamel. A museum-like light. Spot lit, she asked me if I ever loved anyone more than her. The answer was a sincere no. She brought me to Cafe Mud because she loved health food more than she loved me. She felt that it was sensitive to the body-conscious. Organic this. Bland rice and beans that. I found Mud to be okay. If Cafe Mud asked me the same question, I'd have to stroke its hair behind its ears and lie. I have loved other cafes more. Though, it didn't mean I wasn't happy at the moment. I was. It's the kind of cafe the norm core crowd has Stockholm syndrome to. Sometimes I just want a bottomless mug and a ten dollar plate with a side of hash browns. Perhaps that's subjective. Perhaps this is the same type of criticism I've endured for my paintings, and loathed. To be fair to Cafe Mud, they aim to do what they do well. But lukewarm Huevos Rancheros without any type of sauce gives me goose pimples. I'm an olive boy from California who happens to think that this menu item is a good example of Cafe Mud trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. I understand this phenomenon perfectly. I'm doing the same thing by dating Tess. Square peg. Round hole. Huevos Rancheros is not a sunny side up egg on a tortilla chip. The seating is nice. The waitstaff friendly. Trendy. This last time here, at Mud, I drank a cold brew in the patio and the ice melted too quickly. Now, I'm with Lauren, her height, her might, her ability to eat as much as me and stay limber and thin...she's the envy of literally everyone...loves junk food but wants the ambience of LES braided hair and low cut blouses...her words. She's wooed by brunch menus and I surrender. All brilliant people suffer the ills of popular opinion in some capacity. But we haven't slept and that's maybe why I'm grumpy at the fact that we'll each spend around thirty bucks. It's not Cafe Mud's fault that we were up all night in Robert's flat not two blocks away, the powdered sugar we had still making me sneeze, that I'm blood shot, that I'm in desperate need of more water and Cafe Mud is packed. The nice waitstaff is overwhelmed. I'm sitting in the corner of the patio, on a small seat, sweaty, thinking the night was heated just as well, fired up conversations with Robert about the true meaning of painting. I got made fun of one time for stating that painting was everything, and Lauren made the mistake of bringing up brunch. We were accused of being basic. Though in good fun, it stung. I never liked kale or quinoa. I like eggs to run golden rivers through fried stuff. I like my coffee like I like my Lauren, not at brunch, but in bed, or on a sizable table.",2,4,4

You can also opt to get beer or a mimosa if you're in the mood for a little bit of booze.Sometimes, I do feel that their menu is a bit limiting. I crave the bagel but I do not think that's worth the price of the pre-fixe. Lately I've been getting the omelette - which is really yummy!

I recommend EVERYONE to go!!! Enough said. But yelp thinks otherwise haha.So I got the french toast which is REALLY good (soft yet crunchy with a good amount of fruit on top), an egg bowl (which was not as tasteful as thought it was but nevertheless pretty good and hearty), and a biscuit with eggs and green tomato (which has the most interesting flavors but works so well together).

This time it was only 30 minutes and the day was beautiful, so we walked around. We were promptly seated 30 minutes after we first arrived. Although the place looks tiny from the entrance, there is actually a beautiful terrace in the back, where we were seated. The ambiance is trendy and relaxed. They have a sweet fixed price brunch menu from which you can choose either savory or sweet brunch options. I chose the three eggs option. Everything was great except for the home fries. The seasoning they use is not the typical blend and it just didn't taste good to me. The breakfast comes with 2 drinks, from which you can choose coffee, orange juice, mimosa, or just straight up champagne. The orange juice here was actually the first orange juice with pulp I have ever liked. I took one star off because the service was just so-so. Our server was fine, but forgot to bring our drinks and was a little slow. I also took off a star for the subpar home fries. I would definitely come back, however.",1,1,

It seemed like it was soaked in just the right amount of syrup, so no need to put extra on it. It took a long time to get seated though, we probably waited for about 40mins. It was Saturday around noon, with a party of 4. The mimosas were also quite bitter. 3 of us didn't like it, so I don't recommend it. It's also cash only so make sure to take some cash before going. However there are a few ATM machines less than 5 min walk. But I don't want to take away from the awesomeness of the French toast. I like that it also comes with some fresh fruits as toppings",,,

I ordered the sourdough French toast and it blew me away. Everything about it was on point, the texture, the sweetness, the freshness of the fruits. I believed it came with either a coffee or a mimosa and I opted in for the coffee. It was super strong and bitter. I tried my friends mimosa and it was delicious. What I didn't like was the bathroom.

You can have coffee and OJ at the same time!) The fresh OJ was delicious! My friends and I got pancake, love salad, and huevos rancheros with MUD coffee and fresh OJ. We enjoyed everything. Pancake was my favorite. It tastes different from the ones I usually get from other brunch places. Not buttery or dry at all, it is fluffy, soft and tasty. There are some ingredients that taste like rice water, which added slightly sourness to the dish. The fruit toppings include pineapple, orange, stew every, blueberry, apple and etc! The pancake also has banana inside of it, bringing extra fun to the dish.Service is pleasant too.

When my wife asked that the kitchen actually caramelize the caramelized onions that she had ordered (the onions were still crunchy) the server, a brunette in black overalls whose name I didn't catch, rolled her eyes before grabbing the plate. What was returned were partially burnt onions that had been doused in some sort of additional sweetener, because the edible bits were unnaturally sweet. Add on the fact that the server never returned to our table the rest of our stay, lead to a very disappointing experience.

It is a combination of coffee shop (during day time) and a bar (at night), and you can sort of tell it when you try to glimpse inside. Stopped for a short while to get my cappuccino during middle of my weekend run and got impressed by their cappuccino. It was as smooth as I could taste and served as a perfect medicine to cure my tiredness.I would love to return and try their famous avocado toast, or at least grab some drink at night.

96,Lance N.,"Centreville, VA",28,156,154,4.0,8/10/2016,"I did a search on yelp for all of the best breakfast joints around the area. Out comes on top is MUD. so, why not? It's my last day here in NYC and I want something GOOD to eat. At first walk in, it was super dank, dark, and cramp. But lo' and behold they have a back room with lots of light, making it a more proper place for a morning meal. Their coffee is freaking delicious! all i ordered was a normal coffee and the waitress asked if i wanted milk and sugar. When it came out, it literally looked like a latte. Milk and sugar was already added and it was the PERFECT amount. Love how they add it for you! (just like how they do it at Dunkin donut! which is why i go). So I'm not a coffee snob but i do love my coffee. This coffee was a blend of different beans that they mixed themselves. It was smooth and nutty yet had very little acidity to it. I could literally drink this all day! Its that good! The food is also quite good. At that time, I wasn't feeling anything heavy and wanted something light. So the waitress suggested the plantain breakfast cake. It was just perfect! Lots of veggies with a lovely side of tomatoe salsa and a neat thing of plantain cake. Never ever have i had/heard of such a thing but it was quite nice. It had a light sweetness to it from the plantains yet it was savory. Then u got the egg ontop and it also had a texture like cottage cheese which was great. Other than that the only reason why i took 1 star was because they are CASH ONLY! Thank goodness I had some cash with me and i had JUST enough. So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CASH!",1,1,1
97,Maggie W.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,24,10,4.0,7/12/2017,"Perfect spot. Came for brunch on my own. CASH ONLY! There is an ATM at the grocery on the corner. Ambiance alone would be 5 stars. Food alone would be 3 stars. Service 5Brunch beverages (latte and mimosa) would be 5Value would be a 4 or 5 So I averaged that out to a 4 :) The ambiance is what really makes this place truly special. The latte was also so huge I almost didn't finish it, which I love! Most brunch lattes cost more and finish faster, which is such a let down - this one lasted through pre-food, food, and a chapter of a book! The food was simple and similar to what I would cook at home - that's a good thing in some ways (healthy! I know what I'm eating!) and not in others (eh, if I was having friends over I would have made something even more interesting than this, and the egg yolk was cooked through). It wasn't terribly overpriced though, so 3 stars on food. Overall loved my time here this morning and will come back - maybe just for a latte, mimosa and snack instead of a meal this time :) $23 for latte, mimosa and an entree (Mushroom breakfast bowl) - not bad!",,,

100,Akash M.,"New York, NY",108,51,79,5.0,6/26/2016,"Favorite under $20 brunch spot in the East Village, by far. Brunch consists of an entrée + mud coffee + beer or mimosa or OJ. You can ask for a grapefruit mimosa for no extra charge. I had the Huevos Rancheros which was really good, minus the bland rice (you've been warned).This place is literally a hole in the wall, no joke. If you come with a large party expect to wait a lifetime to get a table, regardless of the time of day. I highly recommend getting here before 11:00am to beat the brunch rush. The inside has dim lightening and an artsy feel to it, so if you're into brunch dates, you can't go wrong with this place.FYI this place is cash only, and the bathroom is made for a smurf, that's how tiny it is.",4,2,

105,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,2.0,6/15/2016,"Came here for brunch around 11:30AM on a Sunday and the wait was about 45min-1hr. We ordered a few iced lattes and were lucky enough to grab a seat on the benches along the windowsill so that the wait didn't seem as long as it was.When we we were finally seated, we were seated in the inner area, which was unfortunately very poorly ventilated. So much so that the entire dining area was almost hazy!! The brunch service was slow, and the whole brunch ordeal - from wait time to when we paid the check - took us about 2.5 hours. That being said, if you are planning to come here for brunch, I hope you don't have any impending plans! For brunch they have an $18.50 deal for a coffee/tea, alcoholic beverage, and an entree of your choice. I was irked that the server assumed that the iced latte I had in my hand hadn't been purchased at the front and wasn't going to give me the coffee/tea that was included in the meal. What an awful assumption to make - especially since my latte was in a to-go cup! The food was mediocre and the brunch options were limited. I ordered the Mudman sandwich and while the sandwich itself was tasty, the potatoes were oddly slimy and soft (and luke warm) instead of crispy, which is how I usually expect my breakfast potatoes. This is definitely a far stretch from the best brunch place in the city.Service was also super slow the second time I visited. We stopped by for dessert and coffee, and although I thoroughly enjoyed my companion's presence, the entire ordeal lasted close to two hours!! We'd seated ourselves in the back atrium and it was an awful idea because the waitress was almost nonexistent. I had ordered the honey almond gelato, and it took about 1/2 hour to prepare...I watch a ton of cooking shows and that is about the time it takes to make fresh ice cream..so that gelato better have been fresh! The final latte we ordered also took an additional 1/2 hour, but the waitress was nice enough to take it off of our bill. The gelato was good, but for a 1/2 hour wait time, I expected it to be amazing. It was a honestly just a bit too sweet for my taste, and could have used more strawberries to balance out the sweetness. The Mud coffee and the Mud Mocha were both extremely watered down. So watered down they were almost undrinkable. And I'd told my friend that they had excellent coffee here. Smh. Fortunately the latte was a saving grace...if only it hadn't taken a 1/2 hour to make!PS. The bathroom is smaller than the lavatory on an airplane. It's quite hilarious.",4,1,
106,Douglas R.,"New York, NY",1,3,2,4.0,7/29/2017,"If you want to get a quick cup of coffee, read the newspaper over some tea, or bring a medium sized party to brunch, MUD is easily one of the most versatile Breakfast & Brunch destinations in NY. The one thing that is always a reoccurring theme is how easy it is to get a seat - regardless of time. For anyone who is impatient and portrays the New Yorker mentality, this is a great spot to relax and get away from it all while still having the luxury of an upbeat and attentive service. From my own personal experience, the wait for a table with a party size of 10 is generally only 5-10 minutes without a reservation. The food is always exquisite, and the service is nothing other than timely.It's important to note that MUD is cash only, but don't let that stop you from coming here.

The atmosphere is super cozy and the menu was super cool, I only wish I went with more of an appetite!I ordered the blood orange tea and banana bread, both of which were very tasty. The tea was a very nice portion too, and the banana bread came with sautéed bananas on top of it which was delicious. I didn't plan on eating anything else, but my friend convinced me to get some guac and chips- and let me tell you the guacamole was so FRESH and tasty!!

Updated review","This place is great, super cute, delicious food and very reasonable prices for what it is. My only complaint about the food is that I don't think the rice is 'real' rice, it falls apart and looks/tastes like Minute Rice. My breakfast burrito would've been perfect with better rice.Coffee was great, beer was great, however, service was not.We were welcomed quickly and served our beverages but after that it went downhill service wise. We waited at least 25 minutes for our check while the server was at the next table talking about TED Talks. It was just a little annoying since we had other places to go after. Still love the place but was just unsatisfied with the service today.",,,

Yes, they're cash only and I didn't see an ATM, but they also have a bunch of items under $10, so just scramble together all those singles thrown at the bottom of your bag (is that just me?).I sat in the back in a dark corner. This place is great if you're trying to perfect your brooding look. The server was really friendly and laughed at all of my (two) stupid jokes. I got an affogato. It was served in a bowl, not a glass, which kind of threw me off, but it was still good. The espresso was tart, strong. $10 for a coffee/dessert/place to chill for a few hours?

I was in the East Village and wanted brunch, so I thought, why not give it a try? I made sure to stop at the ATM before, since this place is indeed cash only. This place has such a cool, hippy vibe. Not to mention, has an awesome brunch prefix price. For my almond crusted french toast with fruit, a mimosa, and coffee, I got for $18. I'd say a pretty good deal if you compare other brunch spots. You really can't beat it. Plus, the french toast was absolutely delicious. On top of that, the service was very accommodating and friendly. Even though it was a Sunday (and most Sundays brunch is a blood bath for New Yorkers. Every place is overwhelming and packed), they easily got me in. I may add, the place is a bit tight. It's cozy though, but luckily, their seating goes all the way into the back. When it's warm enough, there's even more seating out on their back patio.

This place has hands down the best mocha in town - the Mud Mocha - with just the right amount of chocolate to coffee ratio that is not too overpowering! The place emanates the East Village funky-cool vibes from the signature logo to the ambiance inside - although a ZOO on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch. My favorite time to go is on weekday mornings between 8-9am on my way to the Astor Place stop! Just the other day I was greeted by a smiling barista and 90s hip-hop tunes which was a definite mood-booster. When I first moved here I had no idea it was CASH ONLY so I stopped there on my way to work without enough to cover my $2.75 coffee (I know, I know) and the barista simply said ""no stress, get us back next time!"" and that's just what I did :).

We split two brunch portions (around 20 each) which came with a nice hot mug of drip coffee coffee, and an orange juice/mimosa/or beer. We tried the almond french toast (soo delicious and unique) and the avocado sandwich, which was surprisingly good. Next time, I would definitely try the savory Huevos Rancheros as well.The vibe of the restaurant was good, besides the bathroom being one of the most narrow rooms I've been in, which can't really be helped.

The guy at the counter told me to sit anywhere we would like so we chose a two person table inside next to the wall. It was very very small and tight. Then I realized there was an outside area so we grabbed a seat there. Plenty of natural light and way more comfortable especially because there is no AC and it was hot inside.They have all day brunch!I got the sour dough french toast while my friend got the banana buttermilk pancake.Honestly, I was kind of disappointed with my french toast. It didn't really taste like anything and I didn't even finish half of it. The banana buttermilk pancake tasted way better. Originally, I was going to order something else like the chicken sandwich or love salad but I thought, i'm coming here for ""brunch"" why am i getting something that's not?

I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, caramelized onions and tomatoes. The omelet itself was okay, nothing special. The potatoes were a bit on the saltier side like another Yelper said. My other friends seemed to enjoy their food but it was also nothing super special. The mimosa was strong, and I like that! Also came in a cute mason jar as well. Coffee was definitely flavorful and well brewed. I mean, for a coffee shop it should be, right? Some places don't brew their coffee well, and I'm glad I had a good one here.

How grateful I was then to my friend for showing me this wonderful establishment. I was also able to convince them to break up with their significant other, whom I had always found unpleasant. It was in all, a great lunch.Months later, I come here often. Its space is great for lunch date, a group outing, or to go alone and read or work by oneself. The service is great. The employees are so friendly I was initially incredulous of their authenticity, but after repeated visits I believe they are truly genuine in their warmth. The coffee is great, and the food is adequate. My favorite part is that certain orders include both a meal and a coffee. I don't like to do much thinking when I order, because thinking about food causes me great anxiety. That I can simply order in two words a full meal with coffee (as I'm eating primarily to put some food in my stomach before I drink more coffee) is something I'm incredibly grateful for. One odd trend I've noticed is that people are more often looking over at what a stranger is doing, without the strangers knowledge, than they do in other public spaces. What's more, when caught in their spying they quickly turn away, afraid to meet eyes with the object of their gaze, lest they be reminded of its subjectivity.",,,

The bathroom is super tiny. Huevos Rancheros ($11) - 4/5 This was really delicious and filling, but nothing spectacular.Orange Juice ($3.75)-5/5 Just like any fresh squeezed orange juice.

I also tried the SO's special omelette with gouda, bacon, scallions, and tomatoes, and that was delicious!  The home fries were way too salty.Nice place for a cozy brunch at a very decent price, but beware of cash only and a very possible wait.",7,2,6

It's definitely more of a simple cafe versus a culinary experience but I thought I felt like it was a nice place to start my day. Staff is friendly but not very attentive. It took them around 15 minutes to realize we haven't ordered and we tried flagging someone down but as soon as they handled their table they didn't even look at us. My friend got the Mudman Special and I got the Grilled Chicken Citrus Salad.I only got two bites of my friend's sandwich but it is delicious. It looks simple but it is plain tasty. The grilled chicken citrus salad wasn't even in the same league unfortunately. The chicken was a bit overcooked and very underseasoned. The actual salad itself was decent but not that different from something I can quickly whip together at home for half the price. This is why I normally don't try to eat healthy when I go out... It's an ok salad nonetheless but I'd say just splurge and go with the Mudman Special.Overall, MUD is a good stop if you happen to be in the mood for something light. The atmosphere is very nice and the food is decent.",7,8,8

Would definitely stop by again just for their coffee. I got the avocado sandwich and oh damn. It was amazinggg. Not really a sandwich person either but it had everything I so desired.

We went in for weekend brunch here. It is 18 dollars per person for an entree, a mimosa or OJ or beer and a regular coffee. I had sunny side up eggs with avocado and goat cheese, mimosa with OJ and my hubbie ordered the chicken press. I loved my mimosa and sunny upside egg. The chicken press was average- bland and flavorless. We finished with a mocha and a capp. Coffees were pretty good- prob the best part of the brunch. Ambience is cozy, staff courteous, baristas do a great job, but food is average. Not worth 40 $ brunch at all. Have had better at much lower prices.",,,

We were seated in the back of the restaurant which was really quaint, had nice lighting and had a small, intimate table setting. The brunch options offers a good variety of salads, pancakes, french toast, and more. I opted for the Huevos Rancheros with queso fresco with a glass of mimosa and sunshine iced tea. It was a really tasty dish (the avocados and salsa really tied the dish together). The mimosa was on the stronger side and I usually prefer something with more of a orange juice taste. The sunshine iced tea was also surprisingly yummy, not your average cup of iced tea for sure.With tax and tip, it came out to around $25.Mud is an awesome brunch place with good portions.

This day we decided to give it another try and it was worth it. The service was prompt for a Friday noon, considering it is a brunch place which most people always talk about. As soon as we arrived we were given a menu and was given the option to choose our seating. The food was AMAZING! Partner mentions ""best banana pancakes ever"" and the avocado toast I ordered with chorizo was scrumptious. It's definitely a ""must"" brunch place. Can't wait for next brunch date and go there again!",,,
144,Lovereen K.,"New York, NY",152,193,131,4.0,12/25/2016,"All day brunch is always the best thing that can happen to anyone in New York. Food: Good portions. Ordered an omelette and was very delicious. My friend ordered a holiday toast, which was rather looking and tasting a little sad. It was a simple toast with a few avocados and strawberries on top. They could have put in a  little bit more effort into the holiday toast considering that it is a ""holiday toast"". However, I would still recommend this place to everyone for their all day brunch menu.Service: Good service. If you are just 2 you can pick any table. The host was very welcoming and checked on us every now and then. There was also some confusion on our check, and the host quickly helped us resolve it.Ambience: It has a very nice ambience, very old, rustic, and hipster. It is a little gem in the east village. They have additional seating behind the main space/area which could have been maintained better. We initially sat there for our brunch only to find that the floor had small water pools. We changed tables and moved inside later on.I would definitely recommend this place for a cute casual date and to catch up with friends.",,,

Everything was perfect, probably the best cup of tea I've had in the States, but the reason for my 3 stars is purely the wait time. It wasn't that busy, it wouldn't have mattered so much it it was.

150,Mai P.,"Houston, TX",215,154,186,3.0,6/17/2017,"So I wanted to give this brunch place two stars but the service was good... so I couldn't. But anyway, let me complain about the food and pricing. We went during weekend brunch, and you have to order from the $18.50 menu. I wasn't aware of this as I only wanted to order the sourdough French Toast... without the drinks. The sourdough French Toast on its own is $10.50. So I had to pay $8 extra for orange juice and a drip coffee. (If you get iced drip coffee or any other variation, you have to pay additional FYI.) On another note, everything's priced the same... so even if a dish is more on a regular day, it doesn't matter. That ""all day menu"" is false Bc it only applies to M-F. Ok moving on from the false advertisement and tricky pricing.... the food was ehh. There was nothing special about the sourdough French Toast. It was unique with the almond crust, but overall, it was just plain. We also had to ask for syrup multiple times. The famous drip coffee, which I ordered iced, was nothing different from a standard iced coffee. The orange juice was freshly squeezed that morning, but the size they gave you was so small. $8 on oj and drip coffee... ripoff. Very disappointing. Come if you just want good service and cool ambiance.",,,

You have a great selection of healthier food and it's all made to order.  My favorite is the BLT w Asiago and avocado with their side salad.  Go for the orange vinaigrette - its too notch.  You can wash it down with a beer or even a fun mint tea. They're quick and not terribly pricey. Sadly they don't do take out by phone; but it's worth going there.,,,

157,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,3.0,8/6/2016,"In reading through these reviews, it seems that New Yorkers call the brunch deal ($18.50 for an entree, coffee/tea, and beer/mimosa/orange juice) a steal. The out-of-towners call it pricey. I'm in the former camp: For Manhattan, this is a good deal, but it seems that the price is increasing at about a rate of $1 every 6 months, so get here fast.I had the huevos rancheros (two sunny side eggs, corn tostada, avocado, rice and beans, and ""pico de gallo"" which seemed to just be tomatoes). All tasted fresh, but the dish was honestly a little on the bland side. So while I felt like I was eating something healthy, I wasn't particularly blown away by the taste. I did really enjoy my mimosa, however, which tasted of fresh-squeezed orange juice, as well as the coffee. The coffee tasted bold and rich and full, as if each cup was made via french press. I was even allowed to upgrade to a maple coffee, which was great, although when the check came I was charged for the full price. I did check with the server and she said it was just a glitch in the system, so we didn't end up having to pay for it.I had a few bites of my boyfriend's french toast (almond crusted sourdough, fresh fruits like oranges, blackberries, and strawberries, and maple syrup) which was very nice and not too sweet like some french toasts. If I had ordered this dish, I probably would've taken the plunge and given Mudspot a 3.5 rounded up instead of the 3.5 rounded down. But such is life.I do really love the concept of brunch all day. Brunch food is really its own category; why should consumption of it be relegated to arbitrary times like Saturday and Sunday from roughly 11 am to 4 pm? Do eggs taste better at noon? So its great that this place agrees. And the outdoor seating is very nice; although technically a roofed space, open windows create a nice breeze and all you can see outside of the windows are leafy greens. It looks like you're in a forest rather than the East Village. This room is where we were seated, and although it was a little on the warm side, it wasn't too bad for this 85+ degree Saturday in August.The cash only thing is a bummer. Seriously, just take cards. It's not going to kill your business and your customers will be much happier.",3,1,1
158,Matt D.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,0,2.0,7/7/2018,"Nice service. Salad dressing on greens tasted like it came from a bottle. Home fries mushy like boiled potatoes, not fried. Overpriced for quality of cooking.",,,
159,S M.,"New York, NY",0,132,9,4.0,7/23/2017,"Great neighborhood coffee and breakfast/brunch spot but minus a star for cash only :( On weekends they kind of 'force' you into an $18 brunch that's an entree + coffee + juice or mimosa. Everything is really good and high quality so I think it's worth it, but it would be nice to be able to just get a basic breakfast too (they're open early so it's not a brunch-only place). You'd have no idea from the entrance but they have a pretty big courtyard type area in the back (completely covered and indoors) -- cute and cozy area. We got there around 10 on a Sunday and were able to walk right in but it was packed by the time we left. Definitely will be back but will remember to grab cash and also use the bathroom at home first next time (after listening to my boyfriend describe his struggle to fit in theirs, I didn't bother haha).",,,

The amount of time it takes people to get cash, change, etc figured out among friends in an age of credit/Venmo was a blast from the past... In a bad way like trying to watch YouTube over dialup..Oh but the food/drink... Let's say that you, like me, don't drink. You come for brunch. You want the Mudman Special (normally $12). You'll be paying 18.50 for the privilege with a glass of OJ thrown in. Need to go to the bathroom here? Good luck. It's tiny and you can barely find space to wash your hands. And there's a line. For the bathroom. And the wait staff didn't inspire confidence in cleanliness... Our waiter had holes and dried paint on his sleeveless tank.

For entrees, we ordered the huevos rancheros and the love salad with chicken. I was a huge fan of the salad, it was filling and fresh.

175,Sheng M.,"Beacon, NY",1,28,28,2.0,8/27/2016,The place looks very cozy. You have an option to sit inside or outside. The waitress was very attentive. Mimosa- pretty strongCoffee- it mediocre.. And it was not hot enough. Mud ice coffee- was not good. They chocolate syrup they used was too much and it made my coffee taste sour. Bacon - was crispy and good. French Toast almond- the presentation was good. If you are almond lover this is for you. Too much almond for me. It didn't satisfy the French Toast craving. They give you adequate amount of fruits.The bathroom was super small. The sink is right in your face. If you are claustrophobic make sure to use the bathroom somewhere else. And CASH ONLY.,1,,
176,Judy B.,"Sebring, FL",86,70,43,5.0,12/8/2016,"I loved this little gem! Lots if character, great service and yummy food! Out table had all kinds of different things off the menu all of which were very good. The French toast was amazing and not to sweet! The coffee is AMAZING! I don't think you could go wrong with anything at this place.  I will definitely return when back in NYC. Would like to experience in the evening! Go - you won't be disappointed !",,,
177,Tamira G.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,96,146,5.0,6/15/2016,This is a hidden gem. My sister suggested this place and I was pleased. It's a cute little hipster cafe that serves breakfast all day. They also have a small quaint outdoor area. I ordered the Mud burrito and it was good. The only thing about it is next I go back I'll probably order it with light tomatoes. My sister ordered the toast and my other friend ordered the pancakes. We all ordered the mimosas (there are only 3 that vary in price) and they were pretty strong. Overall a great experience; I will be back to try their other breakfast options.,2,,
178,Fanny C.,"Bethlehem, PA",224,33,28,5.0,6/5/2017,"The fluffiest pancakes I have ever eaten. So good! I got an omelette here too that came with homefries, and I really liked it. The waittress was very friendly too. There actually surprisingly wasn't a long wait when my friend and I went.",,,
179,Alice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,13,10,4.0,12/24/2016,"All day brunch is the best thing ever. Their citrus chicken salad was also effing great. I freaking love goat cheese.My friend ordered the gigantic pancake with a side of whipped cream (+ $1 or something like that). That was not bad either. Also pictured - huevos rancheros and lox bagel. Those didn't seem so amazing.FYI: The space is pretty small. Waiting for a table and get ugly between people sitting at the bar and people ordering to-go. There is a larger seating area all the way in the back of the restaurant, however. Still wouldn't recommend for parties larger than 4 though.",,,

Updated review","Update: So since the original post when I discovered MUD's existence, I've eaten at MUD for four consecutive days because #clingy. I even tried to switch it up  one day and brunch somewhere else to my disappointment and returned to MUD that evening for a breakfasty dinner. So today instead of my usual home fries and omelette with mushrooms, I ordered an omelette with guac, tomatoes, and rice and beans. PARDON ME for viewing MUD as more of a coffee gig that happened to serve food. Maybe it's perception bias, but why was everything SO amazing. Perfect guac, sexy rice and beans, and of course organic egg omelette and sourdough. Ooh and siracha. Idk. It doesn't make sense.",1,,1
181,Le Anh V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",82,3,0,2.0,4/14/2018,"My party waited 10 minutes for the hostess to take our names down, another 10 minutes after we sat down for us to order drinks and another 15 minutes for the waitress to bring us orange juice (that came in the size of a kiddie cup). After ordering and eating roughly half of a vegetarian dish, I found a piece of bacon in my pico de gallo. The waitress handled it very poorly by replying with, ""Well...what do you want me to do?"" when I alerted her of the situation. At least the manager handled it well by comping my meal. Safe to say I won't be coming back here again.",,1,
182,Jackie P.,"New York, NY",803,75,252,4.0,9/14/2016,MUD is soooo good :D I came for brunch and there's a fixed price menu where everything on the menu is the same price and comes with a juice and coffee/tea. I got the chicken sandwich just cause I wanted something filling and it was DELICIOUS. It was perfectly complimented with juicy OJ and a huge cup of green tea. I would totally come here more often if the price wasn't so steep.,,,
183,P F.,"New York, NY",12,23,6,4.0,5/8/2017,Food was really really good. Atmosphere is extremely relaxed.Con: the bathroom is extremely small but hey welcome to NYC,,,
184,Christine W.,"Blue Ridge, VA",109,7,0,4.0,1/12/2018,"Great atmosphere, food took 25 minutes and fried eggs were over cooked. We went across town for a unique breakfast but were slightly disappointed.",,,
185,Arya B.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,49,3,4.0,12/26/2017,Cute and cozy. No Wi-Fi so not good for working and the atmosphere is not great for reading books etc either. Good for hanging out with a small group.,,,
186,Robbie B.,"London, United Kingdom",75,521,225,5.0,4/25/2016,"Get here early! Otherwise you will have a long wait! One of the best deals in town, under 20 bucks for a coffee, a drink from OJ to beer to mimosa plus a main. The food and drink here has always been perfect.",2,,1
187,Eva C.,"Houston, TX",186,31,45,4.0,3/20/2017,I had a sourdough French toast and that was the best French toast I've ever had. The crispy almond was really really good. The fruits are fresh as well. What's more they have a great atmosphere. I would like to go back again!,,2,
188,Claire W.,"San Francisco, CA",535,207,1813,2.0,3/25/2016,"Overrated, has a long line out the door, but good price.The Bagel & Smoked Salmon and Mudman Special Sandwich were both pretty good. Brunch is served with a mimosa, beer, oj, or coffee for $17.50. Definitely good value for price. *Coffee was excellent, as expected.*However, the space is tiny. The line was out the door because there was 0 room for movement inside. Our table for two was so small our plates and glasses barely fit. We were cramped into a side table in the back with people walking by every two seconds probably trying to dodge outside for a breath of fresh air. Service was not the best either. It took forever to get orders placed and to get our waitress's attention every now and then. Also CASH ONLY, which you've probably seen in other reviews.Overall, wouldn't be back even though the food was good. Has a super long wait, way too hyped up, and cramped atmosphere: the good just doesn't outweigh the bad, especially when there are so many other better brunch places. Might stop by for a cup of coffee though now and then.",8,4,2

190,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",153,466,1812,3.0,5/11/2015,"PRO:- Huevos Rancheros - healthy breakfast - contains avocado, beans, rice, and 2 sunny side up eggs over tacos.- Almond French Toast - I typically don't like sour dough but this actually tasted good mixed with crunchy almonds and fruits. The sourdough tasted like glazed wholewheat bread.- Grapefruit JuiceCON:- MUD ICED COFFEE - MUD is supposed to known for its coffee but this was not good. It tastes like water down Dunkin Donuts coffee. - Place is kind of small.- Smell of GOAT CHEESE wafting through the tiny restaurant while I ate was disturbing. I don't like goat cheese and the smell made me want to gag a bit.",1,1,
191,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",10,161,12,5.0,11/13/2017,"This place is a hidden gem, but not really though, because it is packed even for 2pm on a Sunday! It is a coffee shop right when you walk in, but when you walk to the back, there is a seating area for brunch. Very tight space!All the pics of the food on Yelp looked so good but I ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros which I highly recommend. Next time I will try the MudMan Special Sandwich or the french toast.The hostess said the wait would be 30 minutes, but it only ended up being 15! I would stick it out and wait for a table vs. trying to find another place in EV.CASH ONLY.",,,
192,Stephanie H.,"New York, NY",136,304,750,5.0,7/17/2016,"Came in here just to relax and have coffee on a late night. The espresso was smooth and thick. I had mine cold since we were going through a heat wave + the humidity, making it a really uncomfortable night to be outside. I have to say, this was one of the best espressos I've ever had. I would come here for brunch if I was ever in the mood for overpriced eggs and toast.Just beware that it is CASH ONLY.",,,
193,Regard T.,"Fremont, CA",11,32,43,5.0,3/27/2016,"Found a new brunch spot and it was fantastic!! Mud has set menu so it made all the split checks easier. The price is $18.50 (or $18.95 can't remember exactly) for one brunch dish plus coffee and craft beer or mimosa or fresh oj. It comes to $23.50 including 18% tips per person.Food: I ordered almond french toast and it came with fresh fruits and maple syrup. Man, I didn't expect it was that good. It's really crispy on the side and soft in the center. Yummmmmmmm!!! Services: It was pretty good. The server asked me do I want cream and sugar in my coffee, I answered please have both on the side. The cream came in warm, so it was a huge plus.Price: Come on, a good size of dish with coffee and an alcoholic beverage for under $19?! I bet you will not find anything beat this place in NYC with the same quality. Side notes: You can really taste the champagne in their mimosa. Not like most places 85% OJ + 13% H2O + 2% champagne.",2,,

195,Iqrah C.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",297,54,19,5.0,1/19/2017,I LOVE this place! Came here for the very first timewith my girlfriend and instantaneously fell hard! It's such a cute coffee shop and cash only. Beware there is wait time cause it fills up fast. Whenever I'm trekking to the east village I always come here. The banana nut pancakes are to die for! They're just sweet enough and taste amazing with a mimosa on Sunday brunch. They have outdoor seating which you must take advantage of when it gets warmer out! My favorite place ever,1,1,2
196,Lyn T.,"New York, NY",2,62,6,1.0,8/5/2017,"The service here is absolutely shocking. The girl handling seating and wait times was excellent and accommodating. However waitress and service was non-existent. Waited 15mins to get our order in and then 45mins+ for food. By this time food yet to come out, waitress - never saw her again. Had attitude even when taking our order.. Like what's up with that? Couldn't even wave someone down to ask about ETA on food. Thought 'screw this' I'm not putting up with this type of service and left. No one should put up with this. You run and work a restaurant, you should act like it, instead of wasting and ruining patrons Saturday's with this type of bad experience. This ain't BYO self serve food and drinks...",1,1,

Updated review","After only having gone to MUD for breakfast, I had a chance to go at lunchtime with my daughter. Just like my previous visits, I was very happy with the food and service. We went in around noon and were pleasantly surprised to have no wait. This, compared to the usual long wait for weekend brunch. We grabbed a table in the back patio.My daughter ordered from the specials menu, a molé bowl. It was a bowl with a base of rice and black beans, topped with a sunny side up egg, cheese and tortilla strips. She said it was very good. I had a taste of the molé (I'm a big fan). It was good, very intense, definitely on the chocolaty side. I ordered a bowl of corn chowder with a grilled cheese sandwich. The corn chowder is a nice sized bowl of chowder made with roasted corn and scallions. It's an interesting consistency, not smooth but not chunky. The waitress said they lightly puree the ingredients. It had a slightly spicy flavor but it was very subtle. The grilled cheese was a fairly sharp cheddar on sourdough bread. It was a cold day in NY so the warm soup and sandwich were just what I needed. They were very good.The service was good. Our waitress was a little inattentive and we had to flag her down a couple of times for some things but it wasn't a big deal. The bill was about $30 plus tip, so reasonable for the good food. Once again, totally enjoyed our meal at MUD.",1,2,1
199,Vaishali K.,"New York, NY",114,7,10,4.0,6/14/2017,A great brunch spot. The place looks like there's hardly place to walk but they take you inside into an gardenlike sitting area with sun shining in...its wonderful! The chai latte was exceptional and the food menu had great options...not to mention they got food made in less than 10 minutes!,,,
