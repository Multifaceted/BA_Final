The place it self is really pretty. I definitely recommend trying this place out. The employees were super friendly. Also the age range there is mixed which to me is a good thing.",,,
1,Sara P.,"Manhattan, NY",426,79,233,1.0,9/24/2018,"Horrible place. We had a promoter and it still took us forever to get in. The bar is crammed between Dream Hotel, phD, and Tao so there is a lot if foot traffic and the staff forces you to stick to the wall. I get that this is what the setup is at almost every club, but I think this was even more brash than usual with the bouncers yelling in your face and physically pushing you around. Once we did get inside, theres a bar area with some benches. Didn't even try the drinks so I cant comment on that, however I can say that the dj sucked. He was playing songs from the 80s, then would switch to latino pop, then go back to early 2000s music, all with horrible transitions. Apparently there was a back room club, but I didnt even get to see it. There was another line and a bouncer that you had to wait for to let you in and I was already done.  And guess what- there was a line to get out too! Avoid at all costs!",,,
2,Christopher B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,4,0,2.0,8/16/2018,"So, I went here with a local networking organization last week. I paid $10 per beer (Founder's IPA) and tipped $2 on top of that, per drink. The next day, I thought a bit about the cost and went to their website. Their online menu said Founder's IPA is $8 each. That's annoying. Then, I found out from a friend that the networking event was suppose to be charged $5 a beer and other drink specials. Even more annoying.So, I don't give anyone one-star, but here's two stars because is was a pretty fun night, despite being ripped off by the bar.",2,,

5,Kelly D.,"Merrick, NY",207,245,705,3.0,5/2/2018,"Decided to visit The Lately since it was nearby and offered a free drink via the Hooch app.  They didn't have most of the drinks on the app since they just changed the drink menu, but offered any of the cocktails on the new menu in its place.  There was a limited offering of food including tacos, wings, sliders, chips and guacamole, Cajun fries, and grilled cheese.  I decided to get the a cocktail and carnitas tacos.  Three soft tacos came in one order which was a good size for the $11 price.  They were average compared to other tacos that I've tried.  The meat was flavorful and slightly tender, but I felt it could have been juicier.  The soft shells were toasted and doubled layered so that none of the contents broke through.  The strips of pickled red cabbage and onions gave the tacos pleasant accents of sourness.  The coconut water/lime/tequila/cucumber/cardamom cocktail (I think the name was coco momo or something like that) was dominated by the lime and tequila and the cardamom was really weak.  Nonetheless it was quite smooth.  I sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive.  After ordering I was given the option to pay then or after I was done eating. The price for the tacos on the receipt was two dollars higher than what was printed on the menu.  After informing the bartender I was refunded the difference immediately.  The feel of the place was retro with an emphasis on old tech like video games and movies.  Old VHS tapes were repurposed as menu holders.  Crowd was mixed, but chill overall.  There was a large empty space in the middle of the restaurant maybe for dancing later in the night and also an upstairs section for more dancing that I didn't check out.The Lately is a good place to grab a drink and some bites at a reasonable price (especially compared to the bars surrounding it), but not a place I'd go out of my way to visit.",,,1
6,Ann P.,"Manhattan, NY",84,19,8,1.0,4/30/2018,"My friend & I had our bday party here Friday.  Setting up the space/open bar went smoothly.  For the most part everything went well.  Naturally a couple kinks when there are 35 people asking for drinks at once but overall we had a good time....that was until we went upstairs.A few of us made our way to Blue Light Room 1st.  After a little bit the other bday girl tried to get in.  She was denied by the bouncer who said ""not in that outfit"" with some attitude.  She was in a skirt, t shirt, prada shoes & a leather jacket.  Obviously upset after we just spent $1700 & there was nothing about her look that should had prevented her from coming up the manager Kyle then proceed to tell her she can leave.  So we left.  Not exactly how we wanted to end our night, thank you Kyle.A couple people told me this place had problems & now I see for myself why. Clearly management sucks.  How do you treat someone like that who just brought 35 people to the bar, spent $ and only had planned on spending more.  Not how you run a business.  No wonder people told me not to come here.  Plenty of other places to go in this city.",3,,
7,Julia S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",38,148,145,1.0,9/9/2017,"We got really angry with the attention at this place. The bar was nice, I ordered a cosmopolitan and it was good. My friend ordered a gin and tonic, which was absolutely horrible, it didn't taste like gin and tonic at all. He asked the bartender if she could add more gin to it, in an intend to make it taste better, and she said that she wasn't allow to do that because they can only use a specific measure of liquor for each cocktail. They charge you 16 dollars for a small cocktail, which was no good at all, and they give you that kind of answer when you tell them, instead of trying to make it up to you, ridiculous!",3,,
8,Milo C.,"Manhattan, NY",203,42,8,1.0,4/26/2018,"I came here recently, where I ordered a cranberry vodka. The bartender asked what kind of vodka, and I'm a simple guy so I asked for whatever the well vodka was. So the bartender used whatever was left in the bottle, and then goes to put the cranberry in and tap water comes out. He then tells me that he's out of cranberry and that I can get orange juice or pineapple juice. I opted for OJ, thinking that he was going to remake my drink since it was now equal parts vodka and water in a glass, but no he puts the orange juice in. Then I get charged almost $15 for this vodka, water, and orange juice. I can't imagine how much an actual cocktail costs. (The person next to me told me that they were waiting an hour for 3 hamburger sliders). Don't even bother coming here.",1,,
9,Kristen K.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,38,7,3.0,7/21/2017,"It's not a great sign when your favorite thing about a bar is the wallpaper.Arrived here on a Tuesday evening and it was very empty. There were some interesting sounding Drinks of the Day written on butcher paper on the wall, so I ordered one of those. Unfortunately, I was told ""We don't have those. Those are from yesterday."" Uhh... ok. Not sure why they couldn't just make the drink anyway, but I moved on. I ordered two cocktails, both of which were fine but forgettable and not really worth $17 each. Same thing with the food: Ordered the hush puppies and pretzel and both were just mediocre. Not bad, just not great either.As other reviewers have mentioned, the decor isn't really ""Mad Men meets Twin Peaks"" like it's been advertised, but I did find my spirit animal on the wallpaper.Overall, I give this bar a resounding ""meh"".",3,3,

12,Vidit C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,12/10/2017,"I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night around 11 PM & the bouncer told us it was only reservations; I could see the place was fairly empty for a Saturday night. We then booked a cab to go home. After 2 minutes, I see the bouncer allowing a group of four without reservation. So the only reason he didn't allow me was because he probably didn't like how I looked. I confronted him but he was quite dismissive; to his credit he did tell us we could go inside but that was after we called for an Uber!Sad to see such a place open in Meatpacking. I hope they can fix it!",4,,

Updated review","Update:After this review was written the owner reached out and apologized and assured me the bartender responsible was no longer working at the established.

The bartender was no longer working there and we were treated extremely well.",,,1
14,Lauren V.,"Manhattan, NY",362,5,0,1.0,6/30/2018,"This place is definitely racist and, weirdly enough, sexist. If they decide your hair isn't curled enough, heels aren't high enough (last night's ""reasoning""), or shirt isn't cut low enough, you're not coming inside. Don't trust the promoters to get you in, either. They follow the lead of the asshole bouncers and will only help in making this place a waste of time.",,2,
15,Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1524,1242,3777,3.0,5/5/2018,"Pretty cool overall place and I had heard a lot about the spot for a while. I just got to check out some live music on a Thursday night in the Meatpacking District. Drinks I got were typical beers, Sierra Nevada was cool , pale ale and got one Red Bull and Vodka. Bartender was very cool, older gentleman with almost a hippie look and he provided great service. The vodka was actually pretty decent, haha Strong ENOUGH let's say with this Sugar Free Red Bull. Music was actually awesome on this night and I am not sure if live bands are always there on a Thursday night but I would definitely come back just for that. The retro feel of the back of the bar was cool, old VHS tapes some clearly tagged Blockbuster video, and some reasonably cool albums on vinyl with some 80's artists, again I loved the vibe of the bar and music played, it was late 90's hip hop like Mos Def, Blackstreet, Dr. Dre and Snoop. I can see myself back here definitely within the month.",4,2,4
16,Genny S.,"San Francisco, CA",134,5,0,2.0,7/21/2018,"I only came here because I was invited. Soon as I walked in there was a terrible fish smell so  I said to my friend ""it smells in here"" . A short male worker walked up to me and ""if you don't like the smell you don't have to come in here"". Very nasty and a direct clash of disgraceful customer service. That encounter ruined my first impression of the lately and not only did I not purchase anything , I decided to tell the birthday boy enjoy his night however I do not feel comfortable and left. Not because of the stink ass smell but because of the worker approaching unnecessarily to voice his opinion when no one asked him.",,,
17,Adam S.,"Bronx, NY",93,14,0,5.0,3/6/2018,"This was not my first time here, but after being back a few times I went upstairs to the lounge/nightlife area.  I wanted to give the place a great review because not only do they offer a really cool bar area downstairs with finger foods, drinks and games, but they also have a killer nightlife area upstairs.  The staff is super friendly all of the time and very informative about drinks and their offerings.  The cocktails are all made with high quality ingredients and you can tell the bartenders what type of drinks you enjoy and they will make it for you.  I told the bartender I like Spicy Margaritas and he was able to pull it off perfectly.  The first time I was here was for my friends birthday and they made it an amazing experience.  Everyone had a great time and played games and hung out on their private mezzanine area and played the arcade games.  Management did nothing less than the best, they provided us with everything we needed to party like Rockstars.  The place is also special because they offer something different than the norm in the neighborhood.  The cool bar downtstairs is very laid back and in-pretentious.  And then you can go upstairs and party the night away.I suggest this place for any kind of night, birthday parties or a cocktail experience.Hope you enjoy like I have!",,,
18,Jordana S.,"Manhattan, NY",95,86,403,4.0,12/29/2017,"Nice try at doing something different in MEPA. Unlike the stuck up nightlife establishments surrounding it, the Lately stands out as a much more easy-going and casual hangout. The bar is divey chic, to boot with arcade games and skee ball machines. I had the ultramaroon, a tequila and watermelon drink which was very good. Eclectic design and spacious. Good choice to meet friends for a casual drink in a fun and chill atmosphere.",,,
19,Katie S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0,1.0,4/20/2018,"Honestly, the worst place I have ever been for a party. They start with making everyone check their jacket (ok, not so bad). Once the time frame of your party is up, you should not go downstairs, even to go to the bathroom. Then, good luck getting back upstairs. The bouncers don't care of your card is still down or if your with other people who are still up there. And, sorry if you're on a list, that you have been on all night, who are you?! So half the party ends up downstairs even after getting the stupid tattoo you made us get. Long story short, don't ever have a party here. It was the worst situation ever, and I spent $300 (prices are ridiculous) and have to replace my credit card. I'm sorry I did it and will never go back!",2,,

We made a set list of people who could come and they made the entire night seamless with a huge group of people.

Pros - great location, spacious, very tastefully (yet creatively!) decorated; amazing popcorn! The cheddar and the asiago options were delightful! Cons - drink menu tries a little too hard to be cool; the bartender that day seemed like he didn't want to be ""bothered"" as he wasn't eager to make recommendations and answered our questions haphazardly (mind you, we were the ONLY people there). Also, it was a little dead...it may get popping later in the evening (we were there 5:30-7)... but it wasn't very ""happening"" while we were there.

Finally after 25 mins of waiting around, he brought us over to a table with 10 other people surrounding it, saying that this was our bottle service. Not only did they not bring over bottles throughout the night, they got mad at my friends when we asked if they could replace the empty ones. Not to mention but the other promoters surrounding our tables were very drunk and drinking all of our alcohol. What did we pay 200$ for?? Don't spend your money! Don't have promoters who drink all the alcohol that you pay money for and maybe people would actually enjoy this place.",,,

No problems at door even though lots of people were standing outside! Went inside all the way to back to the upstairs club, and got to our table with bottles ready and everything for us! The hostess came right away to accommodate us, our drinks, and so did one of the managers. Good service and really fun night! I would recommend people to RSVP though. It also had great music... throwbacks, R&B, and the latest pop hits. So important for us to party with our kind of music. We will be back!",2,,
28,Seb A.,"New York, NY",2,32,0,2.0,3/25/2018,Place overall is just ok. I can't give it a 3 tho. The decor is quite nice and facilities clean. The music was just ok. DJ played mostly good songs but they were played randomly with different tempos/feel one right after the other. I'm not a dj but even I know the order in which u play songs is as important as songs themselves. The drinks were expensive but not even well made and they were cheap on the alcohol in the cocktails. If it's expensive then it better be quality stuff. Also how are you gonna put a whole bunch of ice in expensive scotch as if it's a cocktail? Obviously a few cubes are all that's needed. And why the heck does it cost $5 to check a coat? Doubt I'd go back. If you're expensive then you better deliver accordingly.,,,
29,Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",127,278,28,2.0,5/6/2017,"I came here with a friend early on a Friday night after having read some press that described it as being inspired by Mad Men and Twin Peaks. As big fans of both shows, we thought that sounded pretty cool, so we were disappointed to discover that there is absolutely nothing about this bar that's reminiscent of either of those shows. In fact, there's no cohesive theme here at all. Wood panelling, TVs, and a strange animal and athlete motif add up to...what? No idea. Despite the ambiance, we forged ahead and ordered some drinks. I had the Everything Nice (plantation pineapple, rhum ja, Ed Hamilton's Gold, Greek yogurt, pineapple tarragon syrup, pepper), which was pretty good. I can't remember which drink my friend had, but she said it was just OK. For our second round, I had the Jaguar Shark (strawberry infused Hendricks, allborg aquavit, aveze, lacusta rojo, celery shrub) and she had the Wings of Desire (banhez mezcal, rittenhouse rye, amontillado sherry, coffee and arbol chile infused vermouth, creme de cacao). We both agreed that this round was terrible. My drink was extraordinarily bitter and she said hers was like drinking liquid smoke. I'm not usually one to complain about price, but all of these drinks were pretty steep at $16-$17 a pop and frankly, not worth it.We also ordered a couple of snacks off the odd assortment on the food menu: white cheddar popcorn and quinoa hush puppies. The popcorn was inedible due to the fact that someone had apparently poured about a gallon of salt on it. The hush puppies sort of tasted like savory munchkins. If there was quinoa in there, it was disguised by all the bread.The service wasn't that great, either. I arrived before my friend when there weren't that many people there, yet it took about 10 minutes for me to get a menu (I was sitting at the bar). Later, it was very hard to get any of the bartenders' attention.  We didn't even finish our second round, and told them we weren't paying for the popcorn since we couldn't eat it (they were fine with that). Aside from my first drink, there was nothing redeeming about our experience there. The lack of any sort of definable theme in ambiance, drinks, and food might have been acceptable if the drinks and food were good, but overall they weren't. Needless to say, we won't be going back.",3,2,2
30,Cheril P.,"Washington, DC",2,8,2,4.0,3/4/2018,"I like this spot b.c it's chill compared to the huge clubs around it. The only thing is that the music was way too loud, like it wasn't a huge spot so it was just crazy loud. But I was also surprised on the mix of music they play. Literally everything, that was pretty cool. Drinks r 14+, beer is 8, understandable for the area. There was a mix of how people dressed which was also nice. I would go back",,,
31,Shelley R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,52,9,3.0,4/10/2017,"In a nutshell:- Nice, unique cocktails- Bar can get super packed, but the booths have table service and really make the atmosphere enjoyable- The crowd was 90% young-twenty-somethings, gearing up for a night at the club next door. This turned a very nice little spot into a loud and rowdy place. Nice drinks, but depending on the night, it's either a quiet relaxed bar or a noisy pre-game spot. I prefer the former -- hence the 2 star deduction.",3,2,2

You walk in and the running joke was you feel like you are walking into an Abercrombie and Fitch store, it smelled so hard of fragrances. The drinks are definitely over priced. We didn't get any food, so I can't review on that. We had a pretty big group of us of about 10 people and went to sit by the ""fireplace"". They have a couch and 2 nice seats, but after that we had to get stools and squeeze in as they don't have many other seats available aside from the booths. Not a great place for large groups. Right next to Tao and some other great places so probably a good spot for a pre-dinner drink.",1,,

It's also spacious enough to fit a larger group comfortably, and not worry about guest list, etc.  The cocktails are expertly made, and they have a great selection of unique drinks plus more traditional ones.  To me, this place is a welcome addition to meat packing's clubby atmosphere and a perfect casual spot to enjoy company.",2,,3

He kindly offered us the upstairs and free champagne and shots, promising over email that we would have the space the entire night.  We arrived and realized that the upstairs would be way too small for us and only able to accommodate 10 people comfortability max.  We decided to make the best of this situation and split half of the party between our space and the downstairs bar area.  Then 2 hours into our party we were informed that another party was booked for our space.

42,Patricia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,30,9,1.0,1/21/2018,"Wow, I can see why this place is so poorly reviewed. They served up the worst group reservation experience my friends and I have ever had. We had a section reserved for the whole evening for a Saturday night party. When we arrived, they told us our original section on the main floor was booked, and we'd have to cram 30 people into their tiny upstairs area. After a couple hours, they told us they had actually double-booked the upstairs, and we'd have to move. Initially, they didn't even give us an option of where to move to. When my friend called them out, calmly and reasonably, over their absurdly bad mishandling of our reservation, a manager started yelling at him. Our server intervened, momentarily de-escalated, and led us to a section on the main floor that had freed up. (It appears she took the initiative to problem-solve for us on her own, so kudos to her for being the only sane, helpful person in that establishment). Once we'd relocated, a bouncer kept yelling at us for putting our coats on the couches in our reserved area, repeating --rather cryptically-- ""we have a code."" Not ""you must use the coat room,"" but ""we have a code."" Like, wut? One of the two surly managers came by again, and when my friend stated --in a perfectly level-headed tone-- ""You know, the next time I have a 30 person party, I don't think we'll be coming here again."" Instead of taking the sentiment into consideration, the manager started threatening him. The other manager swooped in, and instead of de-escalating, joined in the yelling and threatening. Needless to say, their appalling behavior put a momentary damper on our party, and we got the hell out of there. I've gone out quite a bit over the past decade of living in New York, and I've honestly never seen such incompetence or bizarre, unwarranted aggression from management. Moral of the story: do not go there, and whatever you do, do not book a group reservation with them.",1,,

44,Michael G.,"New York, NY",11,7,0,5.0,3/8/2018,"The Lately fosters an excellent mix of being approachable and also living up to meatpacking's finest.  The ambiance and overall flow of the bar area is great and the crowd is top notch.  Not to mention the Blue Light upstairs space really turns up.  In addition, the wait staff, bartenders, and overall management delivers on the nightlight hospitality game exceptionally well.  Definitely worth a check out.",,,
45,Federico M.,"New York, NY",5,1,0,2.0,8/25/2017,"The place is average. Drinks are small and pricy. We ordered a couple of drinks, nothing special. Particularly one of the drinks was a gin and tonic, which was not good at all. We asked the bartender if she can add some gin at least to make it better, and she refused saying they were not allowed to ""alter"" the drinks. Horrible customer experience. Not recommended. Music is great though.",,,
46,Spencer M.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/4/2017,"The manager kicked us out because he told us there's a reservation. When the waitress sat us down, nobody told us there's a reservation coming up. If we knew there's a reservation later, we would manage our time and order less drinks. After we paid, the manager kicked us out. This was NOT ok, and they should train their team properly.",3,1,
47,Natalie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,4,5.0,3/8/2018,"Went to this bar last weekend with my girls and we had such a great time!! One of my friends had gotten bumped into and spilled her drink everywhere, the manager Kyle was so sweet! He saw what happened and offered us a round of complimentary drinks. Will deff come back here!",,,
48,Taylor S.,"Denver, CO",0,3,0,5.0,3/6/2018,I love this bar! Such a better vibe than all the other bars/clubs in the area. The decor is retro themed complete with old video games and ski ball. Everyone who works here has always been super friendly and accommodating. Also- their house cocktails are all awesome. 10/10 highly recommend if you want something different than club promoters and assholes in the meatpacking district.,,,
49,Kevin S.,"Edison, NJ",3,2,0,1.0,11/4/2017,"the service is absolutely awful, they don't  even tell us when to lease then kick us out. absolutely rude!!! horrible horrible. they give us too much drinks but kick us out when the drinks come up! and they said because the manager says we should leave then we should leave!!! don't go this place",3,,
50,Stephen M.,"East Meadow, NY",300,4,8,5.0,4/29/2017,Definitely seems like a newer place. Wasn't here very long stopped by for happy hour for my birthday yesterday. For looks it's really nice set up and the ledges by the windows are chill to post up with a drink. Seems like a dj  might come nights. Little more of a crowd and would've stayed longer. Good place to check out good luck!,,,
51,Madeline L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,4/3/2017,"This place sucks. The article about it being ""mad men"" themed in eater is completely false. There are very few places to sit, and lots of awkward space. The drinks were watery and over prices. Waitstaff didn't know the menu and had to come back three times to get our order right. Add over-priced to boot (expensive drinks are fine if the atmosphere and drinks are solid). Highly believe this place will be closed in a few months. STAY AWAY",5,3,2
52,K L.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,0,4.0,5/9/2017,"Great drinks, cool space. There were some odd smells so they had lots of fragrant candles burning to offset.",,,
