I went with someone who goes very regularly and they knew exactly what to get. The fry basket was a huge appetizer. It came with 3 types of fries.  The fries were waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and shoe string fries.  They also came with a lot of different sauces and once specifically that was a maple syrup sauce it was great.  The wait staff here is great and they had a daily special that I got. It was a Bison Burger with bacon and cheese on it and it came with a side of mac and cheese. This was great. The bison burger was cooked perfectly and not overdone at all.  The bacon on it was candied bacon and also was amazing!  The mac and cheese was good but I only had a bite of it because of how full I was.The only thing I would say was bad was the time it took to get drinks made from the bar. We ordered several rounds of drinks and it took them a long time to get the drinks to us.  Overall a great place and I highly recommend!",6
1,,9/2/2018,459,,"Manhattan, NY",Ray K.,16,4.0,24,Came here with a friend on the weekday for dinner. I got the rare burger with a side of truffle fries. The burger was very well cooked and was overall a solid burger. Juicy but not particularly memorable.Service was great and they often checked up on us how we were doing. I'd recommend this spot if you're looking for a great burger on a moment's notice!,
2,,7/16/2018,102,,"Mineola, NY",Merisa H.,60,4.0,68,"I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I came to this place on a whim with my husband for dinner, and it did not disappoint! Upon the recommendation of other Yelpers I ordered the Jameson Burger. Oh My Gosh, this is one of the best burgers that I have ever had! It was perfectly cooked, juicy, flavorful. AMAZING! Definitely recommend this! We also tried the cobb salad, which had very flavorful chicken on it (but otherwise it was a normal cobb salad). We also got the basket of fries which came with sweet potato, regular, and waffle fries, and dipping sauces. This was probably my favorite thing at Rare. Every fry was crispy and tender and salty...SOOO GOOD! Do yourself a favor and go here!",
3,,10/13/2018,104,,"Pittsburgh, PA",Julia E.,202,4.0,220,"Ate here for breakfast while staying at the Shelburne Affinia. You can charge it to your room which is great. I ordered the egg white omelet. It came with potatoes, toast, tea and fresh squeezed orange juice. I also ordered fresh fruit. The meal was delicious. Zero complaints and everything came out quick. It is a little bit pricey but isn't everything in NYC?",
4,10,5/29/2018,3651,9,"Hoboken, NJ",Nicholas G.,2091,3.0,952,When you come to a place called Rare you know you have to try the burger. The problem is I ordered it medium and the burger came out rare. The irony is incredible haha.  That being said it was a flavorful burger just a little undercooked for my liking. The tuna sandwich however was very good. Tuna was cooked RARE haha but that is how tuna should be cooked. We ordered the parmesan truffle fries which came out cold.  If they were hot they would have been a slam dunk.  The best part of the meal was the service. The waitress refilled our waters multiple times and was very attentive.Would I come back? Ehh.. idk but there is always a table available here for lunch. If they can get their temperatures right on the meat and fries this place could be a  4 star.,16
5,,6/19/2018,220,,"Houston, TX",Estelle Z.,418,4.0,113,"Went there with friends on Friday night. Was easy for me to get a reservation. Jameson black barrel burger came with a $5 deal of bourbon shot, def ask for it if you like bourbon! In general food was good, the waffle fries and sweet potato fries were the highlight of the meal. They have a rooftop which I heard came with an amazing view during sunset and after it gets dark. Unfortunately we were running late so didn't have time to check out. Maybe next time!",
6,,7/29/2018,0,,"Frankfort, NY",Christina M.,9,2.0,9,"Stopped in to grab a quick breakfast before having to grab an Uber for our bus ride home. Very few people in there which was nice. Ordered a coffee, which tasted good because I can be picky. Didn't offer creamer, just poured the cup and walked away. Less calories for me I guess. One waitress running dining room, so as more people came in for breakfast, she got busier. Someone else brought us our food. Dropped and walked away without a word. Would've liked ketchup and hot sauce. The hollandaise sauce is not what I'm personally used to. It tasted sweet and like a cinnamon cream cheese mixture..which the person I was with ordered French toast so idk if same bowl was used for something but overall, was fed. Would not go back. Also waitress was busy. After waiting so long for her to come over (which she didn't come back since ordering), had to go ask someone else for check.",
7,1,5/26/2018,479,,"Columbia, SC",Sherry C.,1501,3.0,405,"We came here for brunch only because it was convenient. It was pretty hot in there for some reason. The decor is totally outdated and worn. The service was slow considering we were one of 3 patrons. They brought out my orange juice which was warm. However, the food was actually pretty good. My husband got the omelette and he said it was very good. I had the oatmeal, potatoes, and bacon. It was great!  The oatmeal was seasoned just right. This place hopefully will get the update it needs. Also they need to work on the service. But the food was good. Our seats vibrated throughout the meal. I'm hoping it was the subway running underneath. Not sure what else could keep them vibrating.",
8,,9/6/2018,4,,"Charleston, SC",Candace M.,6,3.0,42,The bison burger was just meh.  I did really like the sweet potato fries with dipping sauce.  I was staying in the hotel and tried to order room service...took about 5 minutes to get through to the kitchen.  Everyone was really hospitable!,

Updated review",0,,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom",Emmy H.,15,4.0,13,"Really tasty I had the 3 mini burgers (guacamole + mozzarella, slaw and one with bacon) - all were good and flavoursome even though they were mini. I felt that this dish is just the right size so you can fit in a side tooWe didn't plan the sides too great - we ordered a fries and dip selection for an appetiser which was enough for 4 people! Then we each had fries with out burgers which was too many fries in total!! Still great though, I'm a fan of the truffle parmesan friesThe staff are also really nice! The pictures aren't too great as the restaurant is really dark, maybe too dark, sometimes I couldn't see what I was eating, and the music is quite loud but overall I enjoyed my meal",

11,,5/26/2018,315,,"Manhattan, NY",Sydne P.,41,5.0,60,Unexpectedly went here after being on the rooftop with like 10-12 people. We were seated quickly and helped right away. The burger I got was unreal and I ate it within 10 minutes. SO GOOD. I was really impressed with how accommodating they were. Definitely want to go back.,
12,,8/26/2018,0,,"New York, NY",Robert T.,0,3.0,10,I actually liked the menu here a bunch of good burgers some nice sides ok service But the problem with it is how loud it is for some reason they insisted on playing the music so loud that you couldn't hear anyone at your table for a bar that's great but don't go there for dinner,

14,,7/30/2018,2,,"Natick, MA",Michael R.,0,5.0,5,The rooftop is wonderful.  Very friendly and chill crowd.  My wife and I had some amazing drinks and new friends we met there.  The staff did an amazing rain shower service - in the summer you never know when a rain shower might pop up. Well worth checking out.,
15,,1/31/2018,11,,"Charlotte, NC",Chris S.,105,1.0,142,"Stayed at this Hilton property before, and have been here all week.  Sat in the bar area, which was empty maybe two other people in the bar.  I'm talking with an associate, not even an hour in this empty bar.  Bartender states the only way we can sit at this high top in the back, is we'd have to buy something -- really???  So i order a soda.When I go to pay for the soda, I tell her to just put it on my room.  She asks for my ID, which was in my room, even though I give her my room key. I'm in the very same bar the night before drinking beer, no one asked for ID and there was no hassle putting on my room.  Horrible and inconsistent service.  It may sound like overreacting, but making me buy a soda to sit there for a little bit and then the hassle of trying to pay for a soda. Come on.  I do like the hotel and location and will probably stay in the future, but will not spend my money in their bar or restaurant. Nothing infuriates me more than poor customer service.  Paying for a soda in the hotel bar shouldn't have been difficult, and I really shouldn't have had to even get a soda to sit down.  Too many great bars and restaurants in the area. Moral of the story, next time get in a beer instead?!",
16,,7/25/2017,280,,"Queens, NY",Mabelle L.,1513,4.0,284,"The view is absolutely amazing!! Front row seats to seeing the Empire State Building. It's so close that maybe you won't even notice it because it's literally in your face. It's inside the hotel so you have to go through a side entrance, pass by the security guard, take the elevator up to the rooftop and BAM you're there! The downside is there's no food here or maybe it was just nachos, I don't recall. The drinks are a bit expensive ~$15 per drink but it's a good size wrap around rooftop so it's worth it. It does get packed so it may be hard to find a place to sit but there's always been standing room available. If you get hungry, there's a restaurant on the 1st floor that you can go and enjoy a good ole burger!",
17,2,5/10/2017,132,2,"Manhattan, NY",Gigi A.,5473,3.0,899,"Rare has seems like it would be a great steakhouse and with a rooftop lounge, once visited by Mob Wives Season 1. There is lots to like and I also kind of like the Rare mini-chain with locations in Manhattan. However, Rare has disappointed me more than once.First, whenever I try to go to the rooftop it's closed. Pls open the roof on beautiful days outside the usual Memorial Day to Labor Day. When I've come here for brunch, I ordered a salad with so much cheese it was inedible. Why bother ordering a salad loaded with so much cheese? I realize this is a pro for some people so I'm not knocking off stars for that. The other food was OK but we didn't get bread. Maybe perhaps that was for the best.",3
18,,3/4/2018,26,,"Floral Park, Queens, NY",Jordan D.,6,5.0,7,Burger was great! Also the cottage fries (waffle fries) were out of this world. Definitely coming back soon. Cooked to perfection,

But (as you may have noticed from my previous rants) I'm in rebellion.Life has become a series of ever higher tabs for less food of dubious quality. At Rare, right now, we get the privilege of paying $16 For a basic burger WITHNO FRIES, $9 for a small SIDE dish of chili, and$8 For a glass of lukewarm, flaccid beer. I could buy a six pack of good over priced beer, an armload of potatoes,  and 2 good steaks for that money. And believe me, those steaks would be grilled to perfection.  We must all just be too busy staring at our smartphones/ text emojis/""presidential"" tweets to notice how badly we are being scammed.

The lamb was there but that's about it, there was one cherry tomato, three pieces of cucumbers and 3 pieces of onions on a bed of head lettuce.

If you send it back, as I did, it comes out charred. At the end of the day, it's just a burger. It would be a fine though unexceptional burger if cooked correctly.",
22,2,8/4/2016,197,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Fazeela S.,348,4.0,338,Burger review only. Seriously please go here just to taste the lobster burger - the one served with butter and jalapeño and (another really hot chili pepper) and cantaloupe slices! I've been to the rooftop before - but meh not my scene usually. Too yuppy. So just sit indoors and get the lobster burger. Ya hear???,4
23,,3/7/2018,208,,"Cumberland, RI",Stephanie R.,36,5.0,22,"Everything here was SO good. It was super convenient that it is connected to the hotel I'm staying at. I started off with the Spicy Mango margarita and the lollipop wings! The margarita was the perfect amazing of spice! Then for dinner I had the ""rare"" classic burger. It was build your own so it had everything I like and it was perfectly cooked to my liking. I will be at the hotel weekly for the next 6 weeks so I am really looking forward to coming back here. Service was great too!",
24,,4/29/2017,3,,"New York, NY",Bryan H.,14,4.0,74,"I'm a fan of this place! I tried the weekly chef's special burger and parmesan truffle fries and wasn't disappointed. The burger was juicy and tender while the fries were of the shoe string variety.This came out to about $30 which for a really good burger and really good fries is on the expensive side of things to a normal person. Then again this is Midtown so the price is not unreasonable.I do want to note that one waitress was a completely unprofessional. We set our things at a standing table and went to order from the bar. When we turned around there were dirty dishes next to our things. When we went back to the table and chilled there the waitress just did a walk by and snarkly said ""waitress table only."" There was neither an explanation, apology, or a complete sentence. The waiting area wasn't even that busy. Other than the waitress, the place is cool. Be sure to check out the rooftop bar. Theres plenty of seating and the view is quite spectacular.Value: 3 stars pricey but reasonable given the location and viewTaste: 5 stars tender burger and crisp friesService: 2.5 stars-- cool bar tender but lame waitressAmenities: 5 stars-- great view and spacious roof topOverall: 4 stars-- great view and great food.

26,,7/20/2016,59,,"New York, NY",Shawn H.,2648,4.0,467,"The burgers here really surprised me -- for whatever reason, I didn't have particularly high expectations, but I was impressed. We got the Mexican and the Rare Classic (both medium rare), and I really liked both. The Mexican was spicy, and the guac it came with was very good. My wife preferred that one, but I preferred the Classic, which is just a normal burger with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, plus cheddar as an add-on, but I thought it was great.We live really close to here, and this certainly won't be our last visit.",2
27,,9/14/2018,146,,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",Matt C.,0,1.0,2,Came here to eat with my friend tonight the restaurant was 80% unoccupied and we were asked if we had a reservation we said no. We were told we could only sit at the high tops tables which was fine with us. Sitting down waiting 10 minutes no one even came to give us water. Before we left we saw a mouse scurry across the floor this is the point we LEFT,
28,,6/4/2018,233,,"Houston, TX",Monisha M.,7,5.0,30,Had a group of 16 that walked in waiting for the roof to open. We didn't realize it opened at 4:30 and we were early so we decided to have a drink at the lobby bar. We got sat in a back room that almost felt like a private area and our waiter was so so awesome. We know we were a loud bunch but he had such a great attitude and was so attentive! Went up to the roof afterwards for great views and plenty of space for our group. Enjoyed our whole experience there!,
29,,4/29/2017,9,,"Bothell, WA",Jaime G.,189,2.0,114,"I called to make reservations and the hostess told us they were not needed. When we arrived we made a reservation bc we wanted to visit the rooftop bar. The girl told us that was fine and we needed to head towards the entrance of the rooftop bar. We walked around the corner, outside the building and upon arrival to the entrance of the rooftop we were told the rooftop was closing. We went back inside to the restaurant and were told they didn't have any table so we had to wait 10 mins to be seated. I ate the shrimp skewers and my friend had a hamburger. The shrimp was under cooked and not seasoned. I do not recommend getting this dish. The service was really slow. It took almost 15 mins to get our check. The waiter only checked in on us twice throughout our meal. Not impressed with the food or the service. Pick somewhere else to go in NYC.",
30,,9/24/2016,728,,"Manhattan, NY",Dana H.,1309,4.0,287,"I've been to both locations in Manhattan now, and it is definitely good food. I ordered the duck confit melt this time, and it was surprisingly delicious. It's basically a grilled cheese (with melty Gruyere) on thick white toast with shredded duck. It was a huge portion and so good and also came with a side of cheese fries. The fries are just okay in my opinion, not very crispy and thin cut. Also my meal was $19, which is decently hefty, and I got a mint Arnold Palmer cocktail for $15, which is definitely expensive for what it was and the amount of alcohol that was actually in it. Overall, good and will probably be back again because they have a nice rooftop bar area with a great view of the Empire State Building. We had dinner there for one of my friend's birthdays and they were nice enough to hold our table of 7, even though we were about 15-20 minutes late for our reservation. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get 10% off your bill which is nice. Service was good as well, and food came out fast. Not ground breaking stuff but definitely good!",

32,1,9/5/2017,184,2,"New York, NY",Paul S.,100,3.0,27,Necessary. That's the title of this review. My experience at RARE started at the entrance. Go figure. It's a muggy September 5th and I've just walked nearly 15 blocks. I have what could only be described as a thick fog sliding down my back. #gross. I arrive and walk to the rooftop entrance only to have some middle age man pop up in front of me like some sort of circus act with Joe Joe the idiot circus boy. I'm a solid 4 on a good hair day and at the ripe age of 31. I don't think any cops will be questioning my legal ability to drink. Anywho Joe Joe makes me get my ID out. I took out my ID and showed him. I didn't want any trouble. The man then proceeds to come at me with a sharpie. I jump back not sure what he's doing. He then chases me down to mark my hand. Point is - is it necessary to me marking up the hand of a 30 year old to prove he's of drinking age at 5:45 on a Tuesday. I think not. Not sure where I was going with this. 5 stars for the view. Minus two for the bartender more interested in chatting about Labor Day with the cocktail waitress than pouring me a beer.,

We ordered and the food came in a decent amount of time but no coffees and already needed a refill on my juice that never happened. We were done with our food and still no check ins and no coffee. Finally asked a different waitress for my coffee and got it, then had to eventually get up to ask for my check after not seeing any waitresses to ask. All this while there were only 2 other tables with people so it wasn't busy.

43,,1/2/2017,547,,"Providence, RI",Steve L.,132,3.0,589,"Excellent burgers, but really unfortunate service.Was thrilled to discover that RARE wasn't a steakhouse, but rather a high-end burger joint.  Rolled in for lunch and ordered the excellently priced gruyere burger combo; at $10.95, the burger, fries, and soda package (dine-in only) represents a better deal than the better known burger joints in the neighborhoods including Jackson Hole and Bareburger.Burger emerged rapidly, and was cooked the requested medium rare.  Burger was hockey-puck thick, and had far above average flavor, but not quite the highest-end umami notes characteristic of aged beef.  It's strange to say, but the burger actually improved with a few shakes of additional salt to consolidate the Maillard browning of the patty.  Shoestring fries were both crisp and flavorful; certainly worth the $4 outlay if it hadn't been included with the burger.Unfortunately, the accolades end there, as the overall experience was dragged down by the waitstaff.  Requested that the onion patty be grilled (a la the In-N-Out option) in order to mellow out the flavor and better enjoy the high-end beef.  Our waitress vetoed that request and never relayed the order, which was all the more disappointing when we discovered that this was a customization that the kitchen was easily able to accommodate.  Further, was befuddled by the most confusing explanation that the burger comes standard with lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, and onion that it almost felt that she was doing us a favor by delivering that which was printed on the  menu (sans a grilled onion).  Finally, any time saved from a quick burger service was lost with an interminable wait for the bill.Will return, ideally on a different shift staffed by the A-team waitstaff.",
44,4,4/12/2017,688,4,"Brooklyn, NY",Matteo R.,3016,2.0,691,"A glorified pub, RARE manages to be fairly successful thanks to its location inside the Affinia Shelburne Hotel, and the fact that tourists just don't know better.Thanks to some relatives who were staying at the Affinia Shelburne, and their ultraconservative stance when it came to going out to eat, I had the opportunity to try RARE 3 times within a few days.When it comes to eating out, service is not that important to me. At RARE, however, service is not good. Or, more appropriately, service management. The servers at the tables are actually prompt and courteous, and I feel bad for them, but the 3 times I've been here waiting time has varied anywhere between 30 minutes and 50 minutes, independently of whether we had a reservation or not. In fact, I would say skip the reservation: it's largely useless as you'll have to wait at least half an hour to get a table anyway.The first time we had a problem, it was after waiting for half an hour to get a table despite a reservation. After we complained with one of the managers, he relied quite rudely saying: ""What do you want me to do? I can't tell other customers to just leave!"". Nice. We mentioned this behavior to another manager, and her reply was rather dismissive: ""Oh, it's ok"". well, no, it's not ok for a manager to talk that way to customers; that's why we're bringing the issue up.The other time we had a problem was after being seated promptly, but we then had to wait 50 minutes before the first dishes we ordered arrived.If every time you come here it takes so long to be seated or to get your food, clearly there is a problem. Either this place is severely understaffed, or it is managed poorly.As far as food, I would say mediocre at best. I'm not a burger person, so take this with a grain of salt, but the special burger I got wrapped in bacon sounded great but was just meh. It also came with a side of fries that were cut angelhair-thin, which made it almost impossible to eat them.The grilled ahi tuna looks very nice, but it suffers from a severe case of blandness. The same can be said for the larceny laced BBQ back ribs: the meat is perfectly cooked, and it just falls off the bones, but it lacks flavor. My impression is that the chef is doing her/his best with the mediocre ingredients she/he is given. You can only go that far if flavors are just not there.You're in NYC; why settle for mediocrity?",3

Another friend ordered the duck confit sandwich and it looked rich. She thoroughly enjoyed it, considering she loves duck. The service was attentive, water was refilled without prompting (which is something I really appreciate), and we weren't rushed out. We ordered a bottle of rose for the table and I only wished they had a container to keep it cool. My suggestion is if you're going to eat here, make sure you're hungry. The portions are ridiculous, but in the best way possible.",1

My boyfriend and I had dinner here last week and based on the reviews and the photos, we thought this would be a great date night spot. As everyone mentioned, the fries and sauces were great! I thought it was a little too greasy and the sweet potato fries tasted burnt and overcooked. However, the other two fries and all of the sauces made up for it.My boyfriend ordered the BBQ Bison, which he enjoyed but he didn't think it was worth the price we paid for a typical NY burger. I had the Mexican burger, which I didn't enjoy at all and ended up having my boyfriend eat it. Both of our burgers were medium. While his burger came out on point, my burger was practically rare. The meat had no seasoning and the black bean spread was bland. The only part of this dish that had flavor was the guacamole / chipotle purée, which slid right off. Another side note, it wasn't a busy night but I felt like we had to constantly ask for water from the bus boys. I was disappointed overall, but I'd like to end with a positive note.

My margarita was so spicy and I had to keep spitting out jalapeño seeds . Not cool . And it had like no alcohol . Oh the kicker is my daughters burger had a large piece of plastic in it.  We informed our waitress and she said the manager wasn't there. I paid the bill and left . I mean if your food has plastic in it you shouldn't be expected to pay full price esp if it's a 4 yr old . But whatever . Also it was so hot . Worst experience I've had in a long time.

The Bad: Service was sub-optimal. It took our waitress a solid 10 min after seating us before taking a drinks order (I had to tell her we wanted drinks) then upon taking our orders, disappeared for the remainder of the meal. We would have ordered another round had she cared to stop at our table. We maybe had our water glasses filled once after the initial pour? Overall, the food is what saved this place from being a 2 star. If you don't care about service, this place is great, I haven't had a burger that good in a long while. Would I come back?

Then we ordered food which took an hour and 15 minutes to come. 2 of us were not given food for an additional 10 minutes!!! Myself being apart of the restaurant business for 6 years told the manager that two plates have not been served yet, and he said ""relax its a big table, it'll be right out"". 12 people may be a large table but there were two other tables in the restaurant on a Saturday night (wonder why). When the last two burgers came out they were cooked incorrectly. Our server who I will leave anonymous, told us we can split the bill in 5 ways. Fine. We did that and he told us we cannot give us 5 cards but he will make an exception. When we had not received our cards after 15 minutes I asked the manager where he was. Again he told me to relax because it takes time to run many cards. This restaurant can't handle increments of parties larger than four. He charged the cards $250 instead of $25. We were furious. Obviously he voided the incorrect charges and settled it. Thankfully one of us noticed this mistake.

Little did we know you could not see ANY of the fireworks happening. By the end of the night, there was a line of at least 20-30 people waiting outside of the manager's office demanding a refund.

The chips were stale and needed a lot of salt to compliment the somewhat flavorless dip. For my entree I was undecided between the tuna sandwich (which I saw had mixed reviews) and the ribs. The waiter very enthusiastically recommended the ribs and raved about the BBQ sauce. The ribs were a huge serving and were cooked to perfection, slipping right off the bone.

We happened across Rare which was conveniently down the street from where we were staying. The interior was very cozy and not busy being only 9PM on a Friday. We were greeted by a very kind bartender who left us to examine our menus and didn't return until we were ready. Each of us got a burger. I remember the food like we got it just last week. The fries were delicious and crisp. My Mexican burger was very flavorful and although the texture of the black bean purée put me off at first, I really enjoyed it. My friend got the Jameson Black Barrel and I was lucky to get a bite. Hands down one of the better burgers I've ever had.

We asked to speak to the manager and about 10 minutes later this big old boy with a tongue ring and sweating liking a pig comes over and just generally seems to be annoyed that we would complain about flies and bugs. All of us at the table just looked at each other in amazement. Were we doing something wrong by bringing unsanitary health code violations to a manager's attention? He actually had the nerve to say that this was New York City and that we shouldn't complain about it. We then asked him to cancel our dinner order because none of us liked his attitude and we really were not sure about the suspect conditions of their kitchen. He told us that since our food was already being cooked he would cancel the order but that we were still expected to pay the entire bill. Are you kidding me? Mind you the food here is not cheap. This is a burger joint and not a very impressive one at that. The place looks like you just stepped into the 70's and I don't mean that in a good way. Their burgers range between $15 and $25 dollars. Really? $25 for a burger that doesn't even come with fries? What does this place think it is, the Oak Room or something? Unbelievable! The ONLY reason that I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the waiter. Very nice and generally sympathetic to our situation. He was standing there the whole time this so called manager was lecturing us about the do's and don'ts about eating out in NYC.

So, my friend who had changed his order got his right dish, but another member of my party got the wrong dish.  When we said something to the server, he brought over the waitress, and she realized right away that she mistakenly put in the wrong order. She said she'd bring out the right meal but it would take a bit since the kitchen was very busy.  My friend said it's fine she'll just have the wrong dish since it was getting late and we had plans, and the waitress graciously said she wouldn't charge us for it.  The manager came over to ask if everything was ok and apologized for bringing out the wrong order.  But, when we got the bill, the wrong dish was on it and when we disputed it, the manager said that it wasn't the waitress's call to say we wouldn't be charged and said that because my friend liked what she ate we'd still have to pay (even though this isn't what she ordered and he has no idea if she liked it).  He also said that she did first order this so it's her fault.  One, she wasn't the one who had originally ordered this sandwich, and two, my friend who had ordered it, changed his order right away and the waitress aware and responsive to that.  He was so rude and finally after arguing said he'd take off the wrong dish but was extremely argumentative and blamed us for this.

The real standout here was obviously the burger!Definitely should have ordered the French fry tasting basket, which includes waffle fries, regular fries, and sweet potato fries with a variety of dipping sauces. All of the tables around us ordered that and it looked amazing.

The venue is really nice and fancy itself, which I appreciate, but you're getting overpriced burgers that aren't THAT great. And when I say overpriced, I don't mean you're paying $25+, but you're paying $15-17 which is a pretty pricey burger... at most American restaurants, even the fancier ones, the burger is usually the cheapest item on the menu at around $10-12. AND these expensive burgers don't even come with fries... fries are another $5-8.I got the sliders which are like a sampler of some of the specialty burgers on the menu and honestly there was no wow factor to any of them. They were all dry and too much bread to meat ratio. I also got the truffle parmesan fries and they were really limp and not crispy at all.

We also got the sampler of french fries, which included seasoned waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and regular fries. Honestly - skip the regular fries and sweet potato fries and just get two orders of the seasoned waffle fries (I think they are called cottage fries on the menu). We also split the spinach artichoke dip to start (forgettable - also, save room for the burger and fries!), had no room for dessert.

Menu is pretty basic there's nothing you can get there that all other restaurants don't have but the food was good.,4
99,5,11/25/2012,4421,5,"San Francisco, CA",Ed U.,35768,3.0,4418,"A lot of the Yelpers under this entry appear to be talking about the Rare View bar on the rooftop of the Affinia Shelburne boutique hotel on Lexington at 37th Street, but my experience was strictly within the bar & grill adjacent to the hotel lobby. I'm assuming all the hip, young people breeze up to the rooftop, and aging baby boomers like myself are relegated to this hidden space since it doesn't have high optical value for people who want to be seen as cosmopolitan cool. In fact, when I was there in late one morning last week, there was a trickle of blue-hairs and walkers coming in for lunch.By coincidence, I was staying at the nearby Affinia Dumont and looking for a bite on my way to the Chrysler Building on 42nd for work. Rare doesn't serve breakfast, just burgers, salads, bar food, and did I mention burgers? I wasn't feeling that carnivorous, but I wasn't about to cave to my flexitarian sensibilities and order a salad. I decided to order the $17 Lamb Burger, a half-pound of ground lamb prepared medium-rare, stuffed with feta cheese and roasted red peppers and drizzled with tzatziki sauce. It was pretty good, especially with eggplant and jalapeno hummus spread inside the bun, but overall it was a bit too salty for my taste.The burger came with a Mediterranean side salad which was quite refreshing with a mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, mango, red onion and chickpeas. I'm happy to report that I traded in the inevitable fries for the $5 Rare's Homemade Slaw which was also not too bad and not at all mayo-intensive (see photo). Meanwhile, the blue-hairs were keeping the waiter hopping with their insistent demands, which just made me respect the patience of the staff here all the more. At the same time, I have to admit the burger was not enough of a standout to make me want to return right away. Perhaps if I dye my hair, get a facelift and wear a gold chain around my stretched neck, I can graduate to the Rare View. Wish me luck.FOOD - 3 stars...decent lamb burger if a bit too salty, the side salads were pretty goodAMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's just a bar with a few too many tables to maneuver aroundSERVICE - 4 stars...patient folks work hereTOTAL - 3 stars...yeah, it was OK for a quick albeit pricey burger",8

The burgers were juicy and dressed well but a bit small. They do pay attention to how you like your meat done and executed correctly.

The waiter we had was on top of everything but not to the point where we felt smothered.  The ambiance is very quiet and there is 1 TV by the bar. The restaurant is very clean as well. I asked for a grapefruit, seltzer and grey goose and at first they had no fresh squeezed grapefruit. Then the server came back and said he could do it. The drink came back so delicious.

OK FINE, now were on the roof.  we tell the waitress that we'll be a larger party would they prefer we claim a spot somewhere out of the way.  She helped us pick a good spot HOWEVER as more of us start to show us is when the ""security"" starts acting like this is 50/50 and the place is packed....is it you ask.....NOT EVEN CLOSE!! We're a pretty low key crew talking some of us order some drinks and the waitress tells us we either have one credit card for the whole table or we can purchase drinks and close out the tab each time......whattt? Why....theres literally no one here....ok whatever.  now again were not even close to being a rowdy bunch most people are from church and wont even go so far to drink. there's a bench that is apart of our little section security keeps telling us our legs cant face the outside of the aisle mind you its a huge aisle were talking about 5-6 feet from this bench were many people can pass and were and the wall.

We had the m&m burger, the ahi tuna salad, and the calamari. The calamari was very good but nothing extremely special, still I would get it again. The ahi tuna salad was so yummy. It's over a bean and vegetable salad and the tuba was cooked perfectly. The m&m burger was good, but not as good as what we had read in the paper about it.

The meat was dry. The gravy tasted like lard. The fries were cold and the cheese had instantly made it into one giant block. I like the option of the burgers. How we were able to customize to our liking. Toppings were a bit steep, but it's expected mainly assuming this was a higher end kind of place. Sadly to say the burgers were nothing of any high end meat I've ever eaten. Sure they cooked it to a perfect medium rare. But were are the juices!? Did I order a George Foreman Burger?! I expected better also for the Jameson Black Barrel Burger. Which was suppose to be made with ground ribeye flambéed ??? The meat taste exactly the same as the classic original. Tasteless, no juices, lack of creation. Did I also mentioned its served with pickles no fries. Fries is the most COMMON combo with burgers. But I guess it's marketing strategy to make you pay more for the fries on the side. Oh wait but the duck confit sandwich had !? Hmmm.. Tricky, tricky. But we ordered it anyway. Hmmm.. I never knew the parm truffle fries were suppose to be served cold? Oh was there even any truffle? I guess not. Strike 3. Last but not least. The ribeye steak!

Nice perk: Several of us redeemed the free draft beer from checking-in on here :) food was well prepared and nicely served. I had the New York strip steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus- delicious and filling! The only downside was that the top of my steak was a bit charred while the inside was nice and juicy. I would have definitely preferred the juiciness all throughout! The atmosphere is relaxed and casual. It was a great experience for a Sunday night.,
132,,6/14/2017,150,,"Los Angeles, CA",Kristin H.,0,2.0,10,"I went to Rare Murray Hill last night for a birthday party and the whole experience was terrible.  First of all, the birthday girl had made reservations for 15 people, but when we checked-in we were told that our group would have to be split between two tables. When I flagged this issue with the manager, Timothy, he said he couldn't guarantee large parties would be seated together. I pointed out to Timothy that there were two other large parties there that evening that were all seated together, and he said they arrived first and that's why they could all sit at one table. I told him this is something that needs to be told to people upfront then when making reservations.  If we had known we couldn't all be seated together, we never would have even came to this restaurant to begin with. It started the birthday dinner on a very bad note, with the birthday girl having to go back and forth between tables.  Timothy assured me though that we would receive wonderful service to make up for it, and that he would make sure we were taken care of and that the birthday girl would receive a complimentary dessert with candles.  He went so far as to ask me what she looked like and what she was wearing to make sure it got sent out to her after our meal. During the meal itself, service was very, very slow.  We had to constantly flag down waitstaff to place drink orders and ask for water refills.  One member of our party came 30 minutes after our group had sat down and ordered.  He ordered late yet received his burger first, 10 minutes before all the other food came out...very strange and he ended up eating his alone because he didn't want the food to get cold.  I can't speak to everyone else's food quality, but I ordered the Jameson burger to be cooked medium.  It arrived with a ""medium"" wooden flag stuck in the burger, but low and behold when I bit into it, it was well done and totally overcooked.  For an $18 burger (no sides included in that $18 price - literally just the burger), this was totally unacceptable.  I didn't even bother bringing this up to our waiter because at this point I just wanted to finish the meal and get out of there. Lastly, we never received the birthday dessert Timothy promised us.  But Timothy made sure to come to our table to aggressively address with the group how we wanted to split the bill.  In short - the whole experience was extremely disappointing and unpleasant, especially given that it was meant to be a celebratory and joyous occasion.  I will not be returning to Rare Murray Hill and I would never recommend this place to anyone due to the service and the sub-par food.",
133,,10/15/2015,29,,"Manhattan, NY",Kanan M.,13,5.0,74,"Rare is a solid burger spot in the city. Probably my go-to spot. Over the last couple months, I've only had the M&M burger, which is amazing! It's the Rare classic flambeed in whiskey, topped with cheddar cheese and caramelized onions. Oh man, I think about it often. I usually don't deviate from the classics but there is something about the combo of caramelized onions on burgers that I can't get enough of. And of course, melty cheddar is the best.The truffle parmesan fries are awesome. The regular hand cut fries are good as well. I think the burger portion/size is just perfect. 8oz, so definitely filling, but not ginormous and hard to eat. The burger itself is juicy and flavorful. Patty is just right - not too thick but it isn't thin either. Medium well is perfect if you like pink (but not red) on the inside. It's not overdone at all. In fact, if you like your burgers medium usually (for the pink), Rare will recommend medium well. Just double check with your server before you order. The staff at Rare is great! I've been to the Chelsea location (which is more spacious) and the Murray Hill one, which I think has a slightly nicer ambiance - although it's smaller. It just feels a bit more intimate but can get a bit loud. It was packed on a Wednesday night, so make reservations if you can!

Their steak is always cooked perfectly, and I've never ordered something that hasn't been 100% to my liking. I was a little skeptical at first, because RARE has a very 'corporate steakhouse trying to be trendy' kind of vibe, but their food makes that completely tolerable. I highly recommend the lollipop wings, as well as the fry sampler (if you're with a group especially). Their dipping sauces are pretty bomb, and you get a hefty portion of sweet, regular, and waffle (UNREAL) fries. I suggest ordering the fry sampler with your meal though, so you don't just fill up on potatoes before you even get a chance to devour their delicious meats :)The M&M Burger, and the Mexican Steak are two of my favorite items, but like I said, everything is amazing. I generally go with my boyfriend and we order a ton of food to share. This helps me not feel like a total fatty, just a little bit of one!

Came with tea and fresher squeezed orange juice (so good!) We could see the Empire State Building from where we were sitting right by the window. I loved the music they played- it was mostly acoustic indie and was very relaxing and exactly what I would want to listen to if I had made brunch at home on a Sunday morning. The juice came pretty late and the waitress apologized and said because it was fresh squeezed.

My colleague and I ordered a basket full of fries with different dips and the chicken wings. The fries came out hot but the wings came out room temperature. My colleague even asked them to make the wings crispy meaning keep them longer in the fryer, but the meat was no crispy at all. We told the waitress who brought it back to the kitchen but they brought back the original food which was now hot but the sauce dripped off. Technically food should not be brought back like that because it can cause contamination. The manager came and she brought the food back to the kitchen. She brought us a new order and it was exactly what we expected minus the stranded piece of bacon that came into the new order of the wings.If I could rate the server and the manager, I would give them a 4 star for their professionalism and their efforts to fix the problem, but the food was a disappointment.",

It is too runny, and didn't stick to the fries.  I ended up just pouring it over the rest of my fries, which did and did not really work.  Oh well.Overall, not bad, but I don't believe for a minute that this is ""the best burger in NYC"" as boasted by the front desk people at the hotel.Nice rooftop bar, too.",

We waited in line (which is actually just a line for the elevator) for about 10 minutes. We got to the top and realized there was a ton of open space. I circled around and quickly found somewhere to sit. Great views and I really loved that it wasn't crowded, as I expected from an NYC rooftop bar. The only downside is 1. The music - it's all Brittney Spears and Kesha type stuff, doesn't fit and I hate pop music anyways. And 2. The drink prices - I read reviews before coming about how shitty the drinks were, and then to see that they were $15 a piece, no thanks. A beer was $8 which was still pretty ridiculous, so I suggest having a few drinks somewhere else beforehand.

Service and ambiance is great, casual enough for a date, but the booths are nice enough that it's cozy and private. Great noise level as well. I have, have, have to talk about the food here though.The french fry tasting basket is a must. It comes with three sauces. Since it's not listed on the menu, ill describe them! One is a barbeque sauce, and another is a ketchup with a nice kick to it. What's especially memorable is the honey maple syrup dipping sauce. It's sweet but not too sweet, and by far my most favorite dipping sauce. The waffle fries and regular fries are absolutely delicious, and the sweet potato fries are great as well. I still like the waffle fries the most though.I also had the Jameson Black Barrel Burger which was delicious. Super flavorful, but the barbeque sauce makes it quite salty. Just a heads up!For dessert, my boyfriend (who's from Cincinnati, OH), was surprised that RARE Bar offered the Rare Graeter's Trio. I think the flavors were the Black Raspberry chip, Vanilla Bean, and Blueberry pie ice cream. It comes with these fried straws and raspberry sauce and small cakepies. Cakepies were overdone, but otherwise it was very delicious and a nice reminder of Ohio.Definitely would come back.",3
175,1,8/1/2012,123,,"Munich, Germany",Judy C.,136,3.0,698,"I can only speak for the rooftop bar.It is a nice rooftop with both the Empire and Chrysler in sight. There are lowly dimmed lights and DJ playing chilled music to enhance the romantic air, yet there are baseball on TV and large benches and tables to host a get-together.My night at Rare was not so fortunate. We arrived late (11:15 PM -- bar closes at midnight), so it wasn't too crowded. Drinks are more on the expensive side (Strawberry Mojito for $17), but I guess it's a price to pay for the view. For a $17 drink, I would expect more rum or something special, but it was tasteless and I hardly tasted the rum. To make it worse, as soon as we got our drinks, it downpoured, and the bar practically closed when it happened -- DJ naturally stopped the music as he had no roof, the service all stopped and all tabs were closed. We felt like we were rushed out of the place.At the end, it is a good place to go for a view, but other than that, everything else (especially the drinks) were sub-par.",
176,,6/10/2014,121,,"Manhattan, NY",Kanika M.,0,1.0,2,"If you assume that Rare (the restaurant) and Rare View (its Rooftop bar) are owned by the same people, you are correct! But, if you think that they share a menu or are in any way courteous to their guests, you'd be incorrect. Rare View has three things on its rooftop menu -- none of which are vegetarian. They do nothing to cater to the needs of their clientele. On some level its as though they are unaware that Manhattan is literally FULL of rooftop bars. At first I thought their inability to be accommodating wasn't a corporate policy but rather just the waitress being dumb.  However when she brought the manager over, my friends and I learned that it wasn't the waitress. It was the Manager who didn't smile, didn't apologize for his 3-item menu not having one veggie friendly option! Who does that in this day and age?! They refused to bring up a veggie option from Rare (which is right downstairs), and gave us an attitude when we decided not to order drinks. As we were leaving, we noticed (and pointed out), that they had the RARE MENU posted on a huge board as you came up the elevator and walked into Rare View so the fact that they couldn't bring one item up to accommodate religious dietary needs was highly discriminatory and quite frankly just a stupid way of conducting business. My advice, go to Pod 39 instead! RUDE, OVERPRICED and DOESN""T EVEN HAVE  A GOOD VIEW OR TASTY DRINKS!",1
177,3,9/3/2011,329,3,"Forest Hills, NY",Tom K.,47,2.0,804,"Rare was a rare disappointment. Nestled in the Shelburne hotel, Rare specializes in burgers and also sports a roof top lounge.We were led past the bar into a smaller dining room that was tastefully decorated red, perhaps to represent the name of the establishment. An affable enough waiter presented us the burger centric menu although salads and steaks are available too.Starting with the lollipop chicken wings, I was presented with about eight pieces of medium size. What struck me as a positive was the spicy flavor of the skin that almost cried out for dipping into the roquefort fondue.So far so good.Up next were our burgers but unfortunately, my wife's was missing two crucial ingredients requested: cheese and mushrooms! Mistakes happen, of course, and the error was remedied. However, my burger, the organically raised all natural (Pesticides be gone!) was ordered with american cheese...that wasn't even melted. Nay, neither melted nor about to be melted but cold.Yes, cold american cheese, the kind you'd put on a homemade coldcut sandwich when slumming it.A rare double fault.Perhaps it was an off day. The burger itself was large enough to require a firm grip around the bun. It wasn't all that juicy either which added to my disappointment.I may return for the rooftop bar and give Rare another chance but I'm not in any immediate rush. Not when my organic burger damage came to $17.50 (additional $4 for  a side fries. The classic burger is only $9) and was cheese challenged.",6

There is a wide selection of burgers, all of which are excellent and not overpriced, even for NYC. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the service can be a problem -- I've been seated and then told I have to move, been forgotten by waiters, and had to wait for what seemed like forever for my check. Staff is extremely friendly, just a bit inexperienced.",
180,1,9/18/2013,370,1,"Brooklyn, NY",DeShaun C.,30,3.0,245,"I've been here on two occasions: once for drinks, once for drinks/dinner. Both times were pleasant experiences. The decor wasn't particularly memorable, but that's okay! They make up for it with a rooftop that isn't pretentious and/or filled with hedge art (I'm looking at you, 230 Fifth). When I had drinks on the rooftop, my bartenders were always kind. Drink strength varied wildly, though. One drink would taste like it was mostly liquor, then the next would taste mostly like mixer. After a while I just went with beer because well, you can't mess up beer (I hope). As for food, I had the M&M burger, which was good, but I've certainly had better. The truffle fries were tasty, though.I'd come back here on occasion, but probably just to take in the view and have a drink if I was in the area. Not really something I'd go out of my way for, though.",2

Updated review",0,,"Hartford, CT",k k.,0,5.0,12,Wandered by looking for a bite to eat and decided to stop in. Husband had burger special - Gruyere on their basic burger with fries (thin and crispy) for 10.95. Great deal and he said it was perfect. Special also comes with 3.00 beer special. I had basic burger with cheddar. Asked for it as rare as possible. I only request this of true burger joints that obviously use high quality meat. They nailed it. No salt and pepper needed here - seasoning is perfect. Bartender Chris was really great and welcoming. We will certainly return. Update: We are back again and brought friends for a delicious burger. This time tried the Bloody Mary and  Margarita.  The Margarita is made with a habanero sour mix - awesome kick - highly recommend!  Friends say the Bloody Mary's rock!  Burgers perfect as always.,

Seasoned waffle fries, chipotle aioli. Food. Orgasm. In my mouth. For real, the burger here is so good. Cooked a perfect Medium rare, not bloody but juicy and a bit red with pink edges. The bun held up nicely to the juice too. I want to come back immediately, but I'll become a fatty fat fat fat with high cholesterol and meat sweats.",
184,1,7/18/2011,780,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Matt E.,1851,2.0,2201,"There are a lot of reviews of Rare View in the Rare Burger listing but they should be listed seperately. Although they're owned by the same people, it's a separate place with a different entrance, 16 floors above the burger spot.You'll be hard pressed to find a better view from any bar in the city, you've got one of the most beautiful unobstructed views of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler building among many others buildings. The roof is large with a couple bars, waitress service, and plenty of strung up lights, plants, and couches. I'm glad I checked the place out but I'd never be coming back again for a couple simple reasons. I was there with a large party of people and when the waitress came around to take an order I asked if I could just do a water for now. She told me they could sell me a bottle of water but she couldn't just get me a glass of water. Later on one of the girls in our group just went up to the bar and asked for a water and it wasn't an issue for her to get one. I went to the bar and ordered a Bud Light, it was $9. NINE DOLLARS. Add the dollar tip and I just paid TEN DOLLARS for a Bud LIGHT. I wasn't expecting a $4 beer here but $9 is the most I've paid for a beer without a stripper sitting on my lap in the process. The people who think it's a good idea to come here are either very well off or the type of people who think it's a great idea to pay $2,800 for a studio in Manhattan. Its a decent one time experience but you couldn't get me to come back here.",3
185,,1/29/2016,0,,"New York, NY",Stefan R.,0,4.0,5,"If you go here, just get a burger and move on. Don't spend time looking through the menu - ""oh the wings look good (btw i hear people say this all the time. how can words on a page look good?); hm that table got the fried calamari - smells great; or maybe i'm in the mood for a steak actually"" - just stop that nonsense. You are in Rare for the great burgers and that's all. If you want something else, maybe order a side of fries or whatever - I don't care.PS- the entrance to this place is super weird. It's attached to a hotel so you sort of enter in through the lobby, and there are always people hanging out on the couches or at the free computers, which I don't understand. It kind of creeps me out if we're being honest. It's not even one of those nice lobbies with a fake trendy bar with a nice mid-western gal here on business ordering martinis to pass the time, etc. Its just a small hotel lobby. Strange stuff. Just walk through the doors, take a hard right into Rare and enjoy your burger.",

To start I had the mango margarita (it's spicy!) and my bf the dark and stormy and we ordered the lollipop wings and the fries basket. The sauces are SOO addicting!! The chipotle one is best with the waffle fries, the honey/maple syrup is best with the sweet potato fries and the spicy ketchup with the regular fries. The lollipop wings were okay - nothing too special!We were already kinda getting full after our appetizers but had to try their burgers! My bf got the T-Bone burger medium. The patty was MELT in your mouth amazing!! I thought worth the $21! I got the Mexican burger but because I was already pretty full from the appetizers, I didn't eat the bun. My patty was kinda falling apart so it wasn't as enjoyable!The pickles that came with the burgers were also soggy and really sour. I LOVE pickles, but found these to be sub par in my opinion!!Definitely get the fries basket and try their flambeed burgers!!",1

The decor is nice, just like a regular restaurant and the waitstaff are really accommodating and very friendly. But usually since my mom stays at the hotel and RARE does the room service menu for the hotel, I eat it in the hotel room. Either way the food is still delicious.",

We saw this happening to other people around us, including one woman who got the wrong omelet, was brought the right one, and then was charged for both. These guys need to tighten up their game. On the other hand, the roof bar is great. It's an excellent space with a wonderful view of the city.

I'm just saying, if I'm ordering a burger for $15, I better damn well get some fries with it (which you don't). The extra basket of fries is a fairly large portion and you can share with another person, but it'll be an extra $5. $20 for a burger and fries? Also, $7 for Coors Light? Service was pretty awful, but it was very busy and they comped us with a free drink (got the Macallan 12 year), so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.That being said, the quality of the food is excellent. Juicy, meaty burger, the fries and the sauces are top notch. I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, but with the maple honey sauce, it worked out well. Toppings on the burger range from basil pesto, brie or even a fried egg. I would go here again if I wanted to splurge on a quality burger, but for the most part, it's definitely overpriced.",10
