The hanging minatures were quite cute. The crowd at this establishment was 95% white and average age seemed over 55. The waiters were all white and other servors were other ethnicities. Not unusual I suppose for old-fashioned upscale American diners.The food was fantastic. The tables ordered round of apetizrrs including steak tartar, faux gras. All were delicious. I ordered the lamb chops and truffle Mac and cheese. Desert included their creme brulee offering. The lamb was exquisitely prepared medium rare and just so beautiful.",1,,
1,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,11/14/2018,"True to its reputation of being an old-fashioned place, 21 Club did not disappoint. We started at the bar with some drinks and I loved that the female bartender read my mind and recommended a great beer that I actually liked. She was attentive and provided us great service. We asked for a table and after a 20-min wait for a table for 2 (in a mostly empty restaurant), we were seated. Great food. I had the 21 burger and it was juicy and flavorful. Did not like the weird and spicy ketchup substitute. My friend liked her lamb chops. While service at the bar was excellent, service at the table was lackluster and distant. Also, did not appreciate the obnoxious large party that was seated next to us, you'd think in an empty restaurant (late at night at that point), they don't have to cram everyone next to each other.Loved the toys hanging from the ceiling. Hated the uncomfortable chairs - you'd think an expensive place like this could afford better furniture than standard stuff you'd find at your local pizza place or deli.",4,2,3

We had to flag down the waiter and sommelier each time we needed something. Our family haspatronized this restaurant since the 1930s. Dining there was once avery special occasion. Now it is forgettable.",2,1,
3,Dona F.,"Staten Island, NY",26,221,639,3.0,8/17/2018,"Dinner here during restaurant week. Still really expensive esp after the $18 martini!!! Whoa!Choice of a few appetizers, entrees and deserts. We both had some smoked salmon appetizer which was spectacular. It was marinated and I really don't know what crunchy stuff was on top but that was the best part of my meal. We also both got the lamb bolognese which looked like a small portion when it came out but the cavatelli was very dense. It was also delicious. Great sauce. Pana cotte for desert. Also delicious and refreshing during this heat wave. The decaf coffee just tasted like it was sitting from the day before.",6,2,3

One of the rich guys brought his own lawn jockey statue and then others did it .. and it became a thing.          I gather its a nice restaurant and bar.  we didn't eat or drink there .. but it looked really nice.,2,,

We entered from the classy exterior down into a hole in the wall. We had ressies for the Bar Room .. While waiting fir the friend we walked into the bar which had kids running around and a totally inattentive bartender who never made any contact for the first 10 minutes and the bar wasn't even crowded. We entered the run down Bar  Room  restaurant that looked like a Sizzler Steakhouse. Really jackets and no jeans ???? Why ??? It's not classy at all... food is good but atmosphere ..two thumbs down.. wait staff very nice .. oh those kids running around don't have jackets on!!! anywAy very disappointed only saved the night by going to The Monkey Var a lot classier !!!,1,,

8,Lil W.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,21,85,4.0,8/17/2018,"I had the 3 Course Lunch at 21 Club in Midtown. Homemade Smoked Salmon appetizer w/cucumber, apple, sauce Gribiche, croutons. The smoked salmon was delicious!  For the entree I had the Faroe Island Salmon w/olives, quinoa, chickpeas, kale, tzatziki. The entree was good & satisfying. For dessert I initially ordered the Coconut Panna Cotta w/lime gelee & mango chutney, but after 1 bite I could not continue. The lime gelee is very strong it is the only thing u can taste, I could not even taste the Panna Cotta itself. I informed my waiter that the dessert was not to my liking. He suggested the Dark Chocolate Mousse instead. He brought the chocolate mousse dessert w/strawberry compote & almond crunch ice cream in place of the Panna Cotta. This dessert was definitely better. The best part was the almond crunch ice cream which was really delicious. The mousse itself did not have enough dark chocolate flavor, it was not great but ok. I felt that the appetizer & entree were both great, but the desserts overall lacking & needs improvement.  I also had a glass of 2013 LoLo Albariño Rías Baixas white wine which was nice & refreshing & paired well w/my meal. The service here was impeccable. My waiter Robert L was amazing & attentive.  This is the type of service I wish I had at every restaurant.  Definitely 5 stars in terms of service.The location itself is quite historic.  A prohibition era speakeasy.  Every President since FDR has dined here except for George W Bush. Dining here gives u a feeling of nostalgia. All in all I highly recommend 21 Club.",1,,

Updated review","I didn't have chance to review this place for long time. I went there's twice for my special occasion. Both of the time I had such a nice experience, enjoying with delicious food and romantic environment. Good service and professional wine tastI love how the place decorated with toys on the ceiling. My boyfriend(now he is my husband) saw governor of NJ over there and I heard a lot of famous people went there. I recommend this place for a special day.",1,,

The authenticity and ambience of the restaurant is unparalleled. The food is expertly prepared.I was blown away that our server would recommend the burger, as it is definitely not as expensive as other things on the menu but after eating it, I understood why he suggested it.

14,Christie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",3,9,2,2.0,7/30/2018,"Not impressed. The tables were so crowded we can almost rub elbows with the table next door. Our waiter completely ignored us throughout the evening probably because we look young. He was so much more attentive to other tables which the patrons are people in their 40-50s. We had to wait 15+ minutes to receive our food menu, long after we started on our cocktails.  No one asked how any of our food was, except the bus boy when I didn't finish my main course.  I had the most eye contact and interactions with my waiter when he was taking the check/ credit card from us. We even had to ask the bus boy to get the check. If you want good service from this place, make sure you look old enough before you step into the door. The food was not bad. Crab cake and the smoked salmon appetizers were pretty good. The dessert was not good.  The flan was not eggy but flour-y, and the coconut panna cotta was bitter with a layer of weird lime jello on it. Overall I will not return to this restaurant. If you are looking for fine dining experience with some history behind the place, there are plenty other restaurants to try.",2,1,
15,M R.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,0,3.0,7/13/2018,"So last night my wife and I ate here because it was a promise to her 91yo father who ate there in the 50's. Saw some slightly negative reviews prior, but we were committed. Unfortunately, the negative reviews are correct.Upon our arrival we were greeted and offered time to have a cocktail in the bar area, which we did. We quickly ordered our drinks because we knew what we wanted (old fashion).  Everyone was very nice, but 15 minutes later we were without our drinks even though the bar was less than 8' away. It wasn't until we inquired about them that we received them about two minutes later.  Shortly after, we were asked if we wanted to move to our dinner table, so we took the hint and moved.  I will say the drinks were excellent. Our waiter came to the table and greeted us and for the most part and was very attentive until the end (explained later).  Food was just ok and I had to return my filet after it was brought to me medium well when I had requested it medium rare. The meat quality was not up to par and just didn't taste great. My wife's fluke was average and somewhat dry, but not bad.So, at some point after my wife and I shared the creme brûlée and expressos, our waiter left for the night without ever saying anything.  We waited and waited for the check and after 20 minutes finally asked another waiter.  He then brought the check and since we were in a hurry I just gave him my cc. When I was able to read the bill after I discovered a $12 charge for water we never ordered or were provided. I didn't care at that point and was frustrated so I pointed it out to the waiter when we left and he simply shrugged his shoulders and apologized.Needless to say, we won't be returning. It's sad such an iconic piece of NYC history is going down this path.",4,1,1
16,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5477,4.0,2/16/2017,"Excellent overall experience at the legendary 21 Club. This is a REAL NYC place and I loved it. I came here with my Ma during Restaurant Week. She didn't like the appetizers but she did like the entree (shrimp) and dessert (brownie sundae). My entree, branzino, was great! The curry cauliflower was authentic. Twelve stars for the excellent service! I'm always trying to watch my figure, so I asked if I could have a fruit plate instead of the ""real"" dessert on the prefixe. The gracious waiter accommodated me! Thank you so much!This place is kind of expensive for the portion sizes. I also don't really like the low ceiling, it was a little claustrophobic. Some folks may find the decor fun. The restrooms very clean and modern. This is a trite point, but I loved they had a separate room for makeup applying. Thanks! I will surely be back.Pro Tip: call to make a reservation over Open Table. You may get a better time slot.",5,2,2
17,Jennifer W.,"Manhattan, NY",120,9,3,4.0,8/12/2018,"Popular with my grandparents years ago, my mom and I checked it out. Definitely popular with an older crowd, I had a great experience nonetheless. The lamb bolognese was delicious, staff was bountiful and extremely attentive.Knocking a star off because multiple times I would hear the staff and customers talking politics and raving about Donald Trump and how he eats there. I found it inappropriate for the waiter to partake and very loudly, might I add, in such a conversation. The staff at least should be mindful of others around them.",1,,
18,Jeff H.,"Margareten, Vienna, Austria",277,1020,6713,4.0,1/27/2017,"One of New York's iconic eating spots is the 21 Club.  This former speakeasy is an atmospheric midtown restaurant - for me just seconds from the Austrian Cultural Forum.  Amid the tall surrounding buildings, the low-rise old 21 Club stands out.  And just why all the jockey statues out front by the wrought iron fencing? .... Well I've never gotten a definitive answer!When you enter the 21 Club you enter a fiefdom that has not changed much over the years.  Don't expect a quick bite to eat - things will move at a different speed.  When your reservation is ready to be honored, you will still have to wait for the maître d to present you with the menu.  By that time you probably already have had a drink and bread basket served.  For a recent luncheon, I started with a nice Kale salad and roasted sweet potatoes. I followed that up with a tasty lamb osso bucco over creamy polenta.   And desert was a memorable bread pudding with cranberry compote and cinnamon ice cream.  The waiter was both competent and friendly.It takes a while to get started at 21 Club (and guys don't forget your suit jacket) but once the food starts coming, it is all worth it!",7,4,5
19,Karsten V.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",219,107,194,4.0,8/22/2017,"I recently got a chance to visit 21 Club for a lunch. Admittedly, i wasn't amped about having to wear a sports coat to lunch on a Friday, but I put on my big boy pants and made it happen.It's a bit a of a trip because you walk in, and there's toys hanging from the ceiling. Just an ""interesting"" decor for the interior of a restaurant that's supposed to be a bastion of old NYC sophistication. That said, the food was satisfying overall. The Clayton crabmeat was a great starter, with the mustard providing a great contrast to the chilled crab. I also went with the Chicken Hash, which was supposed to be one of the main attractions here. It was really rich, with a nice bed of wild rice. I also tried some of my coworker's Chicken Paillard - it was a bit too dry for my liking, so i was glad i didn't order it as my main.Service was pretty decent as well so I'd definitely be down to visit again.",2,,

The first time I visited was for restaurant week and I knew I wanted to come back again. The atmosphere, service, and food is amazing. I went back this weekend to grab a drink at the bar after a busy day in the city with a friend. The bartender Jason was friendly and welcoming. I felt right at home ! I really enjoyed our conversations and the drinks he made were unique and delicious. Thank you Jason for helping us relax after a busy day around the city, we will definitely be coming back soon !",,,
21,Elizabeth S.,"Montclair, NJ",123,291,151,4.0,2/5/2017,"This was the second of three iconic New York restaurants I have on my 50th Birthday Year Celebration list, and 21 did not disappoint!The decor changes from room to room -- with an entry way that opens one way into a bar and seating area with wood panels and a smaller number of table, and the other way into a small foyer with a large, comfortable sofa to sit on while waiting for your party. This leads into the bigger dining room, where we sat. The tables are uniquely shaped to allow for pairs or groups to sit and enjoy real conversation, even though restaurant overall can get rather loud. No matter -- the noise was more like background music and didn't impede our evening.We went as part of restaurant week, and all ordered from their suggested menu. Two of us had the potato leek soup; rich, creamy and flavorful and perfect on such a cold evening. One other guest had the kale salad with roasted sweet potatoes, which she also enjoyed.For the main course, we actually all got the same thing -- the chicken grandmere, and it was delicious; even after a little time being out on the table, it didn't dry out. It came with mashed potatoes that were flavored with bacon, although no little pieces. Really delicious.When we placed our orders, we were asked to say what we wanted for dessert -- I didn't think I'd have room, but I made the sacrifice... :) Two of us had the brownie sundae, and one had the carrot cake. The sundae was outstanding; the carrot cake was probably the best-flavored carrot cake I'd ever had. The traditional icing was a little lighter, piped over the top like cupcake frosting, so a little less dense. Just delicious.Our servers were wonderful, whether refilling water, taking and delivering the food orders, or giving us suggestions when we asked for them.And a special shout out to the woman who worked in the restroom -- she engaged every person who came in in conversation. Because that's what people need to do, especially now -- greet each other, connect as human beings, be polite, express gratitude, even for a gesture as small as handing someone a towel after they've washed their hands. It all matters.This was a bucket list cross-off, but I definitely plan to go back again.",2,,

24,J H.,"New York, NY",0,41,21,5.0,12/26/2017,Went here last month for my sister's birthday celebration. Our group had a wonderful time. The cocktails were great - the bartender was able to make me a dazzling Between The Sheets. The manager came over and explained the history of the hanging objects including JFK's wooden boat - loved learning while we're celebrating. The hostess and maitre d' and staff were so pleasant and positive. CBS Sunday This Morning was taping background shots for a restaurant uniform fashion segment - it just aired.

A 80 years old couple sited next to us and shared there 50 years story with the 21 club; the waiter showed us trump's favorite spot( I liked the story but not trump for sure); even the lady hand over paper towel in the lady's room shared her favorite celebrators she has served. It's a cool place and is worth your money. It's expensive but not crazy.",1,,
27,Sam W.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/21/2017,"Just got back from the 21 Club and my experience was FAR from what I expected it to be. For a restaurant that has such an illustrious past, I was VERY disappointed.My family and I went to celebrate my 21st birthday here and were seated next to an OBNOXIOUS large party of people. They were screaming, cackling, cursing, and were overall incredibly drunk and rude party. (Half of them never even touched their food or dessert!) When my mother went to go speak to the manager, Carol, she was brushed off and was told that management's hope was that they'd eventually settle down. It was clear that management simply did not want to deal with the problem. Our rude neighbors never settled down and my family and I were forced to dine with our obnoxious neighbors for the entire evening.The food overall was delicious and the birthday cake was superb. Our wait staff took EXCELLENT care of us and did their best to make our experience first rate in spite of such a disruptive party next to us.It is very unlikely that I'll ever go back. The management needs to GET A CLUE. For a $500+ bill, I would have expected management to nip obnoxious, rude, and disruptive behavior in the bud. At the very least, they should have offered to move us to a quieter area of the restaurant. Such behavior has no place in such a fine establishment and it truly ruined what should have been a momentous occasion/night for me and my family.",14,1,

The first floor is quite dark and the layout and decor is very ""old timer"". It would not be my place of choice to enjoy a meal just from the vibe.However I was here for a private event so we went to the 3rd floor where it was nicely lit and the dining setting was pleasant. Staff were also very courteous. The food: Caesar salad was as usual, chicken entree, chicken was a bit dry, and last was a cheesecake dessert. That was very light and not too sweet which I liked it.

30,Bill S.,"Litchfield, CT",202,588,1,3.0,4/5/2017,"Club 21 has been around a long time and it rides its reputation surprisingly well. It is on the expensive side typical for midtown Manhattan), but the food - especially the steaks - are good, the bartender knows how to mix drinks (they make some killer martinis, and big ones, too!) and there waiters know their stuff; many of them seem to have been around almost as long as the restaurant. It has a clubby, dark atmosphere with a lot of toys hanging from the ceiling in the main dining room, which adds character while imposing some concerns for anyone suffering from claustrophobia. And the seating can be awfully close, really way too close, meaning that we're serious about this place being a concern for claustrophobes. That seating bothers us a lot, and we don't go back often for that reason. That said, they do serve up some good, marbled steaks -- we're fond of the large filet mignon -- and the steak tartare is about as tasty. The sides are ok, not exceptional, and the salads and bread are delicious. Honestly, we've never sampled anything but steaks here, so others will have to rate those dishes. We mentioned the bartenders, but please note they have an outstanding wine list here, and the prices aren't as high as in many other fine dining establishments in the area. So in sum, there's a lot to like here and some things we don't especially care for, hence three stars: good but not exceptional.",4,2,1
31,Dima K.,"New York, NY",382,6,0,2.0,7/28/2018,"I don't believe I've ever written a negative review before, but my dinner at 21 Club pushed me to do so. Sidenote: this is during restaurant week, so I sincerely hope this was just a fluke due to the staff being overwhelmed.Last night, I went to dinner at Club 21 with my parents. The doorman was great - he ran across the street, held an umbrella for my mother as we crossed, opened the door, etc. 5 stars for him. We came in, mentioned our reservation, and waited 10 min for our table (which is perfectly fine).Once we sat down, that's when the service went downhill. Maybe it was because we opted not to order drinks and wanted to just eat from the Restaurant Week menu? That's not an excuse. Anyways - waiter brings water for the table, and while pouring spills it on me. And doesn't say a word. Ok, no big deal. We order our food, and the staff brings bread + butter. The bread tastes a bit stale, and the butter is cold. Again, not a big deal but I would have expected more from this place. 15 min later, the waiters bring the salads and soup we ordered for appetizers. As the waiter is trying to serve my mother first (which I 100% support), he tells her to move her bread plate and utensils out of the way so he could put down the soup. In my opinion, it shouldn't be her job to rearrange her table. Appetizers are ok. I enjoyed my salmon, while my parents were ambivalent about their wedge salad and soup.Next, the waiters bring the main courses. Once again, my mom is asked to hand her plate and utensils over before she gets her food (while my dad's and mine just get picked up by the waiter. Main course - lamb and chicken - were once again ok. Nothing special but not bad. We also ordered the mac + cheese and mashed potato sides. Mac + cheese I enjoyed while mashed potatoes were lacking flavor. Also would have been nice for the waiter to mention that when my mom ordered the chicken, it came with potatoes, and getting mashed potatoes on the side might be too much (double potatoes). And the exact same thing for me when I ordered lamb with pasta, and mac + cheese on the side (double pasta). But I don't blame them for this piece, just a suggestion.As we finished our main course and waited for our dessert, the table next to us left, and one of the waiters began cleaning and setting up the table for the next party. In the process of cleaning, he him my mom with the tablecloth twice. Again, happens, but maybe apologize and be a bit more careful / discreet?The dessert (dark chocolate mousse) was not very good either.Interesting spot and unique decor, but I definitely won't be back.",4,1,

I dropped off many celebs at this place and vowed one day to come here as a customer, and be able to afford it. Granted affording it was the hard way, I spent hundreds of thousands raising kids, so they can pay for my dinner on my 71st Birthday. The night was magical, and I am sure to reflect on this evening frequently. The food and service was excellent, and the ambiance was better than excellent. I had the Filet Mignon, cooked to perfection and the $12.00 order of French Fries, which was my only ""Ho Hum"" on the meal. They were just a little better than McDonalds, but did not hold up to Nathans. Everyone raved about their meals. Then came a VIP tour of the Speakeasy Basement which was only offered because the staff thought i was Al Pacino. Amazing tour, amazing history, and a wine offering that is probably one of the best in NYC with Petreus and Esxchuzeau's all over the place, not to mention private wines kept for moguls and celebs, that won't be back for them for various reasons,foremost and including: because they are dead and it would be difficult.

So part of that they project an old school vibe including a dress code.  About an hour unto dinner I receive a call from my wife saying they need to know who the reservation is under.  I come out front (it's not a huge place). At this point the host turns to ME and says she doesn't meet the dress code, as if she is not even there.  She's wearing nice shorts and a blouse.  Now, I don't have a problem with them having a dress code. Someone in my party had to take a loaner jacket.  The issue was that 1) they went through the pantomime of having her prove that she was supposed to be there by me coming out (I can only assume if I had been a celebrity they would have made an exception) and 2) when they did say no they acted like she wasn't there and addressed me.There are certain kinds of old school we can all look back and appreciate and there are others that need to stay in the past.(i will add the servers and general staff were all excellent and very nice)",8,2,

36,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",208,241,160,4.0,2/7/2017,"So I reallyyy didn't want to give 21 Club 4 stars.  But I did. And it was well earned. 21 Club has been on my NYC restaurant bucket list since I was a freshman in college.  I am a sucker for those old, NYC institutions that are abundant with history, good food, a touch of class, and best of all - secrets.  I came to 21 Club with a preconceived notion that it was going to be extremely snobby - likely driven by dining cost, decor, and celebrity clientele. Despite my preconceptions, I was delightfully surprised and delighted by my experience at the famous 21 Club.  Alas, we did visit for Restaurant Week, and received a superb meal at a fraction of the cost.  However, after dining here, I would certainly return many times over at the full price tag. We arrived a bit early so we could grab cocktails at the bar.  We were kindly greeted by the host and invited to check our jackets.  I had a classic Lemon Drop Martini while the beau had a Makers & ginger.  Fantastic.  The best thing about old school institutions is they KNOW old school cocktails. When we were ready to eat, we were promptly seated at our table in the back.  We were mesmerized by the chachkies hanging from the ceiling.  Our server was just OK, even if it was Restaurant Week I still yearned top-notch, white glove service. It was good, adequate, but not the service quality aligned with the famed 21 Club. I ordered the Kale Salad (GREAT!), Chicken Grand-Mere (FABULOUS) and the Chocolate Brownie Sundae. They also had a fabulous wine list to accompany the Restaurant Week menu in the $30-40 range. Overall the food was great.  We were not rushed, the food came out at leisure, so we were able to take in all the history and ambiance around us.  It was old school NYC at it's finest. I'm knocking off a star not only due to the lackluster service, but we asked the hostess on our way out if we could have a tour of the wine cellar and were denied.  Her response was because it was Restaurant Week that they were very busy and could not accommodate.  I found this a poor excuse and off-putting, especially seeing as though the restaurant did not seem especially packed during our 7:00-9:30p seating. Highly recommend for Restaurant Week, a celebratory dinner, or a very high end date night. Stay away if you have kids, have issue with wearing a jacket (dress code highly enforced), or have your heart set on visiting the famous wine cellar.",3,,1
37,Elena T.,"Massapequa, NY",7,12,1,4.0,8/18/2018,"This review is specifically for the Summer 2018 Restaurant week menu. I made a reservation on Opentable. This was a great price to have dinner at a classic NYC restaurant that I probably won't be able to afford for quite a few years! Upon arrival, we were sent to the bar area. This was my only complaint about the whole night; we had drinks elsewhere before, so we didn't want another cocktail, but had to wait around 20 minutes after our 8:30 reservation time for the table to be ready. It was a beautiful space to wait, and granted we probably wouldn't have minded at all if we were having drinks! For dinner, we loved our intimate little table in the Bar room. The restaurant week menu had some tasty options, and we also appreciated some delicious lower-priced wine by the glass suggestions. My boyfriend had the crabmeat soup, which was delicious, and I loved my wedge salad with creamy, fresh cheese (if you like blue cheese!!) The lamb cavatelli and roast chicken entrees were solid choices; nothing extraordinary, but well-done, tasty, simple dishes.  The desserts were also delicious! The service was exceptional, especially because I put we were celebrating a birthday on Opentable, but didn't specify whose it was. I think the waiter heard me say happy birthday to him, and brought out a special-decorated birthday dessert for him without me asking! Hopefully I'll be back some day to try the regular menu :)",,,

The staff was by far o e of the best I have encountered over the years; attentive, knowledgeable and all around very professional. The food!!! The food!!! Delicious and perfect portion sizes. I had the escargot and the duck. As a birthday surprise I was treated to a delicious lava cake...I ate the whole thing. This is interesting because I am not a huge fan of dessert.Ok, yes the decor was ""interesting"" but it gave the place character.

40,Christian B.,"Skytop, PA",72,9,9,4.0,12/29/2016,"My friends and I go here once a year, dressed up for a fancy dinner and a night galavanting around Midtown. 7th annual dinner was two days ago and the 21 Club continues to impress.We started with drinks--expensive but delicious. I had two Manhattans which were strong enough to justify the price tag. We always sit downstairs in the bar room. The warmth of the deep reds and dark woods are instantly calming. The place feels like our own cozy nook in some early 20th century mansion.We started with two shellfish towers and the crab cake. The shellfish towers are our favorites. Nothing bad to say about a giant metal tower overflowing with crab, lobster, oysters, clams, and shrimp. All the seafood was fresh and rich.I had the steak tartare for my meal and it was TO DIE FOR. There's a reason it's one of their classic dishes. The steak tartare was sweet, spicy, juicy, and smooth. The meat was tender and simply bursting with flavor. The best way I can describe it is ""eating a cloud made of steak."" The capers and scallions tied the whole dish together.I got the ice wine for dessert. It was a fun, smooth, and sweet glass of wine. Perfect after-dinner drink--right up there with Bailey's and coffee for me.21 is simply one of my favorite spots in all of NYC. The location, the atmosphere, the food, the ambience are all top-notch. I knocked off a star this time around because the service wasn't quite up to snuff considering the high prices. Our server pretty much disappeared after dessert and we waited a while for a check. Had to ask another server! Nobody wants to feel forgotten about after purchasing a $1200 meal. We're a young group of guys and we couldn't help but feel a bit of the old money condescension that all places like 21 have.Either way, stop here at least once in your life. Eat that amazing steak tartare and then spend the rest of your days wondering why people even bother cooking their steaks.",2,1,
41,E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",32,487,169,2.0,5/6/2017,"This is a place you'll end up going regardless of your enjoyment of the food. This is a historic restaurant ... eat in the 'bar room' which features toys and helmets hanging from the ceiling. It looks like an old fashioned restaurant combined with someone's basement but for the most part, this is where the heavy hitters and notables eat vs. the more formal dining room. (Sinatra, Trump, etc. all have/had their favorite booths.)Two things you need to know ... 1.) it's expensive. 2.) the food kind of sucks.Our waiter was a complete asshole. Always trying to upcharge us or sell us on something we didn't want. Completely ruined the experience for us. You don't want to go out to eat and feel like you are in some touristy market in Mexico. It is not at all enjoyable having refills on drinks and wine pushed on you before you halfway finish the first glass. Especially given a Manhatten cocktail will set you back $19. This place knows all the tricks ... the first drink you get will be absolutely weak. They start getting stronger on the second round. They know you'll order another if you don't feel a buzz after the first, so essentially you are spending $40 on two drinks (weak and strong) in order to get a bit mellow.After going throug the gauntlet of ordering dinner with our waitor ... who acted like a souvineer hawker on a cruise ship dock ... ""Would you like salads? How about soup? What sides can I bring you? No sides? Are you sure? You don't want dessert? I'm going to bring you the menus just in case."" Dude, I know how to order from a menu!! Don't act like an Italian mother in law!! I know what I want to eat ... stop pushing stuff on me that I know I don't want.This really ruined the experience as the waitor always seemed to be right on top of us pushing more sides, drinks, etc. on us. We couldn't even enjoy the conversation ... I would never do business here.The food was (as always ...) average at best. My medium rare steak was basically raw. (Other restaurants would call this 'Blue'). At $56 for a small filet, this is very unacceptable. My date wanted only a salad. The waitor kept pushing more food until she finally felt guilty and ordered 'steamed vegetables' thinking it was a side. A $35 entree of vegetables and mushrooms came out on a dinner plate. This is addition to her salad, which is all she really wanted.I wanted so badly to leave this asshole a 15% tip but she made me leave 20% so as not to cause a scene. The restaurant is cozy, inviting and has a fun vibe. Lots of regulars go here because of its history. I love that gentlemen are not allowed in unless they are wearing a jacket and no jeans are allowed. It bugs me that a polo shirt and jeans is the customary uniform at fine dining establishments these days. Kudos to 21 Club for enforcing the dress code Now if they can just replace the waitstaff and chefs ...",8,5,2
42,Jemimah A.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",4,41,63,3.0,9/3/2017,"The restaurant decor is marvelous. The decor above the bar room is so adorable and kitschy that you can't help but stare. Regardless of this though, the place still felts very high end through the intimate lighting and amazing service staff. You are definitely paying for the experience of going here. The food is a little bit above average, everything is cooked great but not a lot of flavor if you ask me. I would suggest going here during restaurant week when they have a prie fix dinner setting. Overall, not a bad experience and I would go again (only on restaurant week of course)",,,
43,Evelyn R.,"New York, NY",0,18,13,4.0,6/27/2018,"The food here is amazing. However, the prices could be lower. I tried: lentil soup (soup of the day), steak tartare, chocolate and raspberry soufflés, and decaf coffee. All of these dishes were out of this world. The lentil soup had ground meat, so it almost tasted like a light, spicy chili. The steak tartare, while small, was excellently garnished and had a thick texture. The soufflés, which took 15 minutes to prepare, were warm and light. The raspberry soufflé was my favorite since it was so unique and even tasted a little tart. But lastly, the decaf coffee-- oh my goodness. It was the best coffee I have ever had. I have my suspicions that it has chocolate or some other flavoring in it. It just was not bitter at all and tasted divine. I might even come again just to have the coffee.     The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It is clearly very upscale, which means you will be surrounded by Midtown workers and even celebrities. There certainly was a pressure to look presentable and be very polite, especially since I was one of the few people there at the time and waiters were constantly checking in. I would suggest coming for dinner when there are more people and the space is more lively.",1,,

Suit jackets are required for but men should also be required to wear a tie.  NYC has decayed so much in style that it is hardly the sophisticated city of the past.

There's a staircase, fireplace, old fashioned bar, and it seems almost like a library or a club house. But when you walk into the dining area, there are toys hanging from the ceiling... a bit weird I thought. Soon, I learned that this place has a legacy, excellent prix fixe, and one strict dress code. There's apparently a famous ""secret"" wine cellar somewhere in the building. It's one of the most famous speakeasies from the Prohibition Era and iconic restaurants in NYC. It's worth a visit.",2,1,5

Would give this place a three star to be honest, but given we came in for restaurant week menu and did not put high expectation, I would love to give a four-star review here.First, we were depressed by the outside looking - quite different from what's show in Google pictures because of its exterior renovation. But inside decoration is nice! At least, I never imagined it before I came in personally. We got checked in super quickly and services were very friendly. Great service here I feel.To the center, the food. For restaurant week menu, I would recommend the appetizer - Crab and Salmon Tartare, tasting great. For main course, I got Roasted Leg Of Lamb , not bad. I ordered Ricotta Tart for dessert and it was so-so. I see online that the restaurant week menu is also offered on other days throughout the year but charge higher - Two Courses for $34 / Three Courses for $42 per person.  In general, only on the food side, I feel this place offered me food no better than average $$$-$$$$ restaurants in the city.

Since I was the last to arrive, the host walked us to our table, the carpet vanished to hardwood floors and there were various types of artifacts (model air planes, trucks, bowling pins, football helmets, and etc.) hanging from the ceiling. Once seated, Chauncey and John presented themselves and proceeded to give us the drink menu. Now the fun starts.I had a red wine to start and the rest is as follow:Appetizer: Hamachi Sashimi - avocado purée, frisée, spicy-yuzu dressingMain Course: Faroe Islands Salmon - chermoula marinade, heirloom cauliflower, lime yogurtDessert: Chocolate Sticky Toffee - butterscotch sauce, vanilla ice creamThe service was immaculate, superb, and outstanding. I can go on and on but I would like to thank Chauncey & John and the others for making my dining experience incredible. Their 3 course meal for restaurant week will receive a 4 + + stars from me.The final résistance of the night was the opportunity to see the wine cellar. Learning the history of the cellar was amazing but entering was even better. Seeing famous people names for example, President Nixon and Isaac Mizrahi on wine bottles was great.  They also have a beautiful table in the cellar that seats 20 people for a special event and an original booth where people would sat to make deals in NY.

64,Jing X.,"Brooklyn, NY",258,641,2734,4.0,2/2/2016,"It's true, all the guys (or should I say men) wear blazers/jackets, even the waiters.  But a simple nice dress will get the ladies in.  So girls, it's time to dress up and treat yourself to a classy meal underneath all those toys and sports memorabilia hanging from the ceiling.My girlfriends and I made a reservation for dinner during Restaurant Week (RW).  $38 for one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert is a steal at this venue considering how that's the price for just one of the cheaper entrees here!  Their RW selections are denoted with a small jockey icon next to the item.  We were able to choose amongst 4 appetizers (3 since a Caesar salad doesn't count for me), 4 entrees, and 3 desserts.BAR 21 EXPERIENCEWhile waiting for my friends, I had a seat at the bar.  I wasn't offered a menu but already saw their drink menu (~$17 cocktails) online beforehand and ordered a Blood and Sand cocktail.  I'm not a fan of whiskey but the rye and vermouth came out tasty with the orange juice and cherry liqueur.  Hence, the hefty price tag bought me a strong concoction and complimentary bar snacks (mixed nuts, wasabi peas, cheesy crackers).  They give you the option to bill your drink to your dinner tab but I paid for it right away.  I brought my drink to the dinner table once my friends arrived and one of the waiters offered to carry my drink on his silver metal plate.  Damn, I felt like royalty!  He even pulled out my chair for me (and turned the table to help my friends get into the inside seats).  Plus, we sat at the same table President Richard Nixon did if that adds any bonus points?Now onwards to dinner @ BAR ROOM (dining area on ground floor)APPETIZERS - I can't choose a favorite, they were all so good!!- Chef's Root Vegetables Soup -- creamy, light, flavorful, large portion!- Hamachi Sashimi -- thin slices that are seared with an almost chewy texture and spicy fresh kick of flavor from their yuzu dressing- Venison Pot Pie -- flaky golden crust with hearty filling insideENTREES - Short Ribs and Salmon were my favorites!- Faroe Islands Salmon -- I love how the outermost layer of the salmon is flakey/crunchy and the inside was so wonderfully soft and juicy. - Red Wine Braised Short Ribs (beef) -- gloriously shredded and screaming with a mouthwatering array of subtle flavors- Herb Crusted Poussin (baby chicken) -- tender chicken sprinkled with a very spicy herb that reminds me of wasabi and threw me off.  The brussel sprouts and root vegetables were roasted to perfection but the sauce in the dish was a tad too sweet for me.(The other RW entree was their Macaroni and Cheese with shrimp and lobster, which sounds really good too.)DESSERTS - They were all decent and well put together but nothing spectacular.- Chocolate Sticky Toffee -- came with a candle for my friend's birthday (hehe surprise!) I love how the chocolate wasn't too rich or sweet but still very chocolately.  The toffee flavor was there.- Cinnamon Ice Cream Sundae -- this was an explosion of flavor and texture with cinnamon ice cream, vanilla custard, and sweet caramelized apple.  I loved the first two bites but was completely overwhelmed in trying to finish it.- Pear Tart -- very cute mini pear sitting on the tart.  I've had tarts before (without the pear) where the nuts were glazed with so much sugar.  The Pear Tart here is nothing like that!  The tart, although hard, does crumble and the nuts are not overly sweet since the pear adds a fruity sugary taste.CONCLUSIONI would say that the RW dining experience here was a success.  I was expecting top notch service and ambience (which were present) and only mediocre food.  I'm impressed that their RW menu had good food.  Definitely worth it for RW!  3 courses for $38 before tax and tip.P.S.  Coat check is free but make sure to tip at the end.",6,1,2

68,Ian M.,"New York, NY",0,29,0,2.0,3/12/2017,"Excitement led to disappointment with this place. We booked as we were going to a show and they offered a fixed priced menu. The good - great decor, quite moody which reflects its past, the pre-show menu. The bad - stuck up, pretentious, rude/surly staff, a male domain where women seem to be banished to the menial tasks (coat check/restroom), they made us feel like we should be privileged to be there, food average, did their best to get us in and out in less than 1 hour.The joke is that although they are trying to be like some posh silver service restaurant, with the attitude to match, they provided a dessert spoon for soup, and when asked if they could do a latte the response was 'we can do anything'. What came back was dishwater with a bit of froth.No, you can't do anything. And you certainly do most things badly, including recognizing we're in the 21st century.",,1,

72,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",216,448,2742,4.0,2/26/2015,"I visited here for restaurant week as it had been on my list for a while. I really enjoyed the place, the atmosphere and the food. I really appreciated the good service I got here, the doorman, the host taking my coat & the nice lady in the bathroom. From entering the restaurant it felt welcoming, the staff are dressed well and the bar/lounge area was very cosy. Our table wasn't ready straight away so we had a seat at the bar & did some people watching. There was a bit of an older crowd & what looked like business people. When our table was ready the host addresses us by Mr & Mrs and carried out drinks to our table. Once we sat down we took in the decor which is a bit kitsch, which I loved! There were small airplanes and trucks hanging from the ceiling and red checked tablecloths. The food was very good, to start I had crab and salmon tartare and my husband had the head on maya prawn. Both were very tasty & full of flavor, we were very impressed. For our main meal I had the short ribs and my husband the Amish chicken. We ordered French fries to accompany them as we felt we needed some carbs, but afterwards wish we had got vegetables as we were missing them from our dishes. The chicken was a really large chicken breast, but the short ribs portion was on the small side, although it was excellent and again full of flavor, I just would have liked more! For desserts, I had the banana sundae and it was sooo good! It had so many elements to it & was great, I didn't want it to end. I think it was my favorite dish. My husband got the Tarte A L'orange and thought it was nice and thought the fruit that garnished it was nice too. All in all it was a great meal and I would return, however it was nice to have a deal with it being restaurant week. We didn't order wine on this occasion but be warned the wine menu is 84 pages long, so you might want to review it before you visit!!",1,,1
73,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",376,679,30581,4.0,9/9/2015,"the first rule of 21 club is you don't talk about 21 club...actually the first rule is gents must jackets when dining and drinking.no jeans and sneakers--WHAT? i can't wear distressed denim or crispy Jordans, huh? argh. however sacrifices must be made for the greater good like eating and drinking in swank old school establishments.i've only had lunch (mostly biz lunches) at the 21 club, which was never a private club...though many thought it is/was based on its storied locations, famous clientele, and rules. most recently i dined here during Mad Man week where there was a special drinks and edibles menu. long live DRAPER!opened in the prohibition era--this restaurant (former speakeasy) has serving swanky meals and sloshing sober patrons for over 80 years. the outside is pretty eye-catching--decorated with colorful horse jockey statues against the dark black of the iron gates. the interior of the reception feels old-ish but not worn out---everything looks shiny, polished, and well-maintained. i expected something out of another era of time...feels like old decor but not in an antique or classical sorta way.you'll be greeted. asked for your reservation time. and walked to your table.always make reservations!i typically sit at table 3 in the BAR ROOM--the ""Gordon Gekko"" table--the character from Wall Street. GREED IS GOOD!you'll notice in the in the reddish themed, dark wood room--which makes you feel like you're in fancy parlor or study. tons of different items hanging from the ceiling--toys, sports memorabilia, knickknacks etc. apparently the celebrity clientele here have donated these items that are carefully hung from the ceiling.the lunches in the Bar Room are prixe fixe or a la carte. if you have time and having a boozy lunch, do the prixe fixe. for the faint of heart--the lunch or anything here is pricey. you are not only paying for quality of food (which is fine. i would not say it's the best ever), but the service and ambiance make it pretty damn good and to me well worth the price for lunch splurging. also the prixe three course sans beverages is the best bang for your buck, imo. the starters of 21 salad or the crab tartare is pretty spot on. the lamb or salmon are solid entrees. the chocolate panna cotta during Mad Men week was dessert heaven. drinks are made with a heavy hand here. order classic cocktails: martinis, gimlets, etc. you will not be disappointed. the service is amazing. very attentive. great conversation. super friendly. and not creepy. white glove service all the way. with cleaning and refolding napkins and such as needed. the waiters, bussers, and other staff really pride themselves on providing that next level of service in terms of dining experience by really spending time to answer your q's about the menu, accommodating your requests, and making your experience at 21 seamless (no, not the delivery service!).the clientele in general is on the older side. much older siiiide. i have a feeling that many of the regular patrons here have been eating at 21 for the last 20-30-or 40 years. so outside of the entertainment of a fabulous meal, you get to see old folks get hammered. HA!tbh, can you get a better value food wise? yes. will you find better executions of the menu elsewhere of course. however you can't place a true value on the time-travelling feel of being transported in the 21 Club via food, drinks, service, and historical elegance. drops mic, so i can kick back and relax with this gimlet.i out.zzz.",29,26,26
74,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",307,37,72,3.0,2/5/2016,"Overall - 21 Club is an undisputed NYC landmark and I'm glad that I finally made it there for lunch but I'm not eager to go again. My experience would have been much better if the waiters would have given my mother and I a bit more space and personal time to actually enjoy the meal.  Food was solid quality. I went to 21 Club for the restaurant week lunch menu. I've been here for drinks but this was my first time dining there. I was led to check my coat as soon as I entered. The seating process was a bit disorganized with multiple hostesses. It was clear that communication was a bit choppy at the front of the house.Dining Experience - I ordered the venison pot pie, which came quickly after ordering. The puff pastry was light and the meat was tender, not gamey. Perfect.   I had the faroe islands salmon for my entrée - stellar dish as well. The salmon and heirloom cauliflower were cooked perfectly.Dessert was underwhelming and perhaps this only applies to their restaurant week desserts. I had the pear tart (poached pear in the middle over vanilla custard, sprinkled with walnuts). Not too sweet but I wasn't blown away.Service - Kind of aggravating. My mother and I waited much longer than others with the same reservation time, which was a bit confusing. I think the lack of communication between hostesses caused choppy cadence of seating. We had attentive service once seated that evolved into waiters asking if we wanted dessert every five minutes. The dining room wasn't busy at this time so they didn't need our table.",1,,
75,Hanny H.,"CANAL STREET, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/29/2016,"I came here with some friends on a week day evening, and the place wasn't too crowded. I was dressed nicely in a shirt, slacks and dress shoes, but the restaurant forced me to wear one of their loaner blazers which did not fit me at all, so I looked like a child trying to look like an adult. We were told to wait in differing areas by different staff members, and they made it clear that we were ""in the way."" We didn't sit at the bar because we don't drink (that much).Upon being lead to the dining area, my first impression is that the place is extremely dark, and the decor is tacky, dirty, and old.The service was sub-par - it seemed like our server didn't want to serve us. I looked around and saw other staff standing around, talking to each other, and generally ignoring customers. I overheard two staff members talking negatively about a table.The food wasn't good. We were a pretty large party, and we all ordered different dishes to try as it was the first time for all of us. Nothing stood out as being spectacular, and we all agreed the food is mediocre.It appears to me as if the 21 Club is going by momentum how it used to be, but no longer is. My friends nor I do not have any interested in returning to this establishment. We felt a bit ripped off, actually, due to the poor quality of food and substandard service.",32,5,3

I guess that is why the restaurant is so dark so one does not see the dust. Ladies bathroom was a bit messy.  So what is all the hype ... U tell me!  I find it insulting that they add the tip on the bill....Dear 21 Club you do not deserve a 20% tip maybe 15% at most.  Waiters did not go out of their way or make us feel all that welcomed.We had every dish ordered on our table of 10 and we all said the same... the food is just so-so!",6,,2

79,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",210,93,335,4.0,2/3/2016,"Came here with a friend for restaurant week lunch. To make reservations, my friend had to provide her credit card info. If you want to cancel or modify your reservations, watch out and do it at least two days before on the phone because you have to call them or they apply a fee for not showing up.There is a dress code, no jeans or sneakers. A lot of well to do people dine here, so even lunch on a Wednesday was packed with people who had the means to lunch at a chic establishment in the middle of the week.The interior is spacious, nicely furnished, and dark. During the day it's somewhat difficult to see and I would have preferred a better lit environment to at least see what I was eating so that I could fully appreciate it.For appetizers, my friend got the soup of the day, which was deliciously creamy, thick, and flavorful. I got venison pot pie which was very tasty and juicy because the red wine they used as a sauce highlighted venison's taste and added vibrancy to a dish.For entrees. my friend got the salmon which was amazingly done in a creamy sauce, way beyond my expectations for a simple, unassuming salmon dish. I got the wild poussin, which was delicious with the herbs on the chicken and the wine reduction sauce with the potatoes and vegetables. My portion was very small, so don't expect to over eat depending on the dish that you order.The desserts were extremely sweet, and that's coming from the person who likes sweet. My friend got the caramel toffee, which was crunchy and rich, and I got the cinnamon sundae, which was a disappointment. The waiter recommended the sundae because the chefs make all their ice creams in house, so naturally I was excited. But instead of ice cream, I got two slices of overly sweet caramelized peach sprinkled with cinnamon and a teaspoon of ice cream on top. My friend's toffee cake had the same exact amount of the same exact ice cream on top. Only I ordered ice cream sundae, not overly sweet caramelized peach. Sadly disappointed with such ending of a meal.All in all, I will return to try their other dishes during the evening, when the overdone darkness of the room is more appropriate.",,,

81,Steph M.,"Long Island, NY",399,514,632,3.0,3/26/2014,"We were running with the classic new york theme for a friend's roaring 20's (30th) birthday last weekend. With it's brilliant history as a prohibition era speakeasy, 21 club was a perfect for our night out.We committed numerous faux pas that evening:- The birthday girl wanted balloons. When you're the birthday girl, you get what you want. Especially at 30. I brought them along and got the feeling they were perhaps a bit obnoxious, even in the downstairs room clad with checkered tables and antique toys hanging from the ceiling. - I didn't know any of my my party mates (with the exception of the bday girl and her beau) but we were largely well behaved, even if we were a few decibels louder than the average table (oops). We ended up doing a round of shots. Yes, shots -- at 21 club. Our waiter politely obliged but I felt that really wasn't the time and place. - In line with the 20's themed party we had fake cigarettes. The birthday girl even had an Audrey Hepburn-esque cigarette holder that she was casually holding for photos. The look of polite horror on the waitstaff's face when we brought them out was a bit humorous. They were covertly trying to figure out what the heck we were doing and if they should put a stop to our shenanigans.Now, on to the food.Wanting to get a taste of vareity and leave with a full stomach, I opted for the 3 course prix-fix. I started with the crab cake which was pretty amazing and was richer than an oil rig owner. Seriously creamy and good. Only one came out on the plate but I could of devoured plenty more. The salmon main came out way undercooked but our waiter politely corrected this error. When it returned it was light, and full of baby new potatoes, not bad.The birthday girl brought her own cake and they charged some crazy amount to cut it and serve it.The Sorbet and fruit dessert was last dish down. Delicate and creamy and a light conclusion to my meal.My dirty martini came in at a grand total of $19. Ouch.I'm left confused. White glove service in a room of knick-nacks and checkered table cloths? While I liked it here, the value was negligible. Even for a NYC restaurant prices were a bit exaggerated.",3,1,1

85,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,1059,8595,4.0,8/19/2014,"Saw 21 Club on a plethora of top 10 restaurant week (RW) lists so chose it as one of my RW picks to go to this summer. I had no idea of the historical significance of the restaurant regarding every U.S. president since FDR (except GWB) had eaten here and that numerous films were also shot here (i.e. Wall Street) prior to choosing it.On the outside, the restaurant looks classy, upscale and there's a nice touch with the little jockey figurines on the top of the entrance. My friends and I had dinner inside the Bar Room, which was really dark inside. The dim lighting could be looked at as giving off a romantic ambiance, but at the same time you had to have the vision ability of a bat to see the menu!The restaurant was once a speakeasy so it was understandable that the décor was unique too. There were all sorts of toys hanging on the low ceiling (trucks, airplanes, footballs, helmets, etc) and little statuettes and paintings on the walls. The table clothes were a red/white plaid color, which added to the ""weirdness"" of the room. The room definitely had an ""old school""/1900s feel to it and is nothing like the modern, classy restaurants of today. A strict dress code is enforced here --- jackets are required for men (ties being optional now) and no jeans or sneakers allowed. The noise level throughout the night was moderate and not extremely loud. The Bar Room was not at capacity on the Tuesday night we visited, but it was almost full in our section of it.As for the RW menu, I was pleased to see that there were 4 of each course served. The RW menu was actually embedded within their regular menu with little jockey figures next to the RW items. Here's what I ordered:----- APPETIZER -----Beef Carpaccio - The thin slice of beef was not cooked all the way through, but was excellent and perfect for my palette! It was flavorful, almost like a giant, thin piece of pepperoni and was surrounded by some vinaigrette seasoned arugula and parmesan cheese.------ ENTRÉE -----Roasted Murray Chicken - Moist, juicy and tender. I loved the seasoning on the top of the chicken and it was roasted just right where it wasn't burnt, but I got that toasty flavor from the skin. The mashed potatoes were a good addition to the plate to fill up on.I also had a chance to try the Braised Baby Lamb Shank and I would have to say that would have been my #1 choice in retrospect. The Lamb was also extremely tender and the juices just spilled out with each bite. Also, the serving size was perfect and the Broccoli Rabe was really good! The only complaint I could have on it was the Couscous because I'm not a big fan of it.------ DESSERT -----Roasted Peach Tart - I also had a chance to try the Crème Brulee and Almond Chocolate Blondie Sundae and I highly recommend the Sundae out of all 3. The peach tart was caramelized on top but there was a little too much ginger flavor in it for me. The Crème Brulee was a classic brulee, so I didn't feel it was that special either. The Sundae was sweet, but there were so many delectable ingredients in there, including the blondies that we could dip in the sundae and little crunch balls.Overall, I liked the RW menu food, but not sure if I was fully in love. I found the décor to me very unique, although a bit odd. I didn't feel the Bar Room gave off the high-class environment feel, despite the fact that they have a dressy dress code. I did like that the RW menu had a 4-4-4 list and the wait staff was very professional. I would hate to give the restaurant a 3 because it was better than that, but it wasn't a 4 either, so I'll have to settle on 3.5 stars.",,1,2

If you are a male, you can't take off your blazer or at least thats what we were told when my BF took off his. So for females, nice classy dress, for males a suit and no jeans.Decor: They have toys hanging down on the on the celling, definitely many planes (old school type of toys...classics). Pretty cool. Setting: It's quite loud in here, so for that romantic date...Maybe?? It is upscale, but if you want to have a good conversation with your date be prepared to speak a little louder than normal, not the ""1 inch voice"" we all learned in elementary school.Service: Excellent, they are pretty attentive to your needs and walk around constantly to see if you need assistance. What we ate:1) Beef carpaccio2) Mediterranean grilled calamari3) Braised baby lamb shank-Not bad, a little gamy, but not over powering-Juicy and tender4) Faroe island Scottish salmon-Cook perfectly and not too tough -Had a great blend of flavorOverall: I had a good time and I enjoyed their restaurant week selections.

99,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,276,32,4.0,3/2/2015,"This place's lighting was made for photographing food and then posting it on the Internet. The food itself, for the winter restaurant week, was as good as we anticipated (we'd been eyeing this place for quite some time). The selection was generous--you could have the 21 Club Caesar salad, a prawn, maine crab/salmon tartare (always my choice if its on the menu) or the soup of the day for appetizers, Amish chicken (which I got), salmon, lamb bolognese, or red wine braised short ribs for the entree, and a banana caramel sundae (awesome), chocolate panna cotta, tarte a l'orange, or mixed fruit/berries for the dessert. The appetizer was fresh--the salmon and crab worked well together, though I mostly tasted the salmon and did not seem to get much of the crab. The chicken for my entree was superb, and the sundae was heavenly. I had a great meal here. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because our table felt claustrophobic (compared to the ones next to us, where two people could sit comfortably next to one another on the same side), and the waitstaff was a bit impatient; it was understandable because the place was crowded, and overall they still provided good service. My boyfriend even bonded with one of our waiters over being Greek. The decor on the ceiling was a bit unnerving--it's a distinct collection of random objects, including helmets and toy trucks, that are suspended over your head as you eat. I was a bit paranoid they might fall on me should there be an earthquake or something. But other than that, the place was swanky, the clientele seemed high-class, the general atmosphere felt aristocratic, etc. You cannot come here dressed in jeans and a t-shirt...

100,Vince C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,42,14,2.0,2/2/2016,"I was here for a co-workers' lunch during restaurant week.Extra star for the interesting ambience of toy airplanes and football helmets lining the roof, but the service for such a supposedly high caliber restaurant was simply inadequate. It is not that they don't have enough staff, it is that the staff are all disgruntled and grumpy. The gentleman serving water spilled water all over my dessert, did not apologize, and ran off. My ice cream was swimming in a sea of ice water. Service was slow.I ordered the sashimi and salmon, which were quite delicious and made to specification, along with a decent cappuccino. The total bill for restaurant week for lunch came out to about $55 per person. I wanted to tip more, but the ice cream swimming in water made me cringe and I decided to tip 10%, but really should've been a symbolic 0%.My colleague got the lobster mac n cheese. You should get that one if you can afford the calories. He loved it.Also, jackets are mandatory for gentlemen.",3,1,

Let's say i give it 3.5Upon entry we had a gentleman answer the door, a dif gentleman take our coats, a dif gentleman check us in, and several attendees in addition to our waiter.This is not a place i would necessarily chose to go to if i did not have the request from my client. It was definitely an old school new york's men's club attitude but without any discrimination of women. The staff was absolutely fantastic, i would give them five stars.I chose the prix fix for lunch with 2 items. the soup du jour (tomato bisque topped with Parmesan) which was very delicious. I ate every single drop. Next i had the Amish chicken which was with English peas, wild rice topped with a truffle jus. The chicken was moist and very good. The peas were minimal (which i was fine with as i don't like peas) and the truffle jus was less truffle and more au jus, again which i was fine with as i'm not a huge truffle fan. In my party we also had the crab cake, which i had a bite of and had huge lumps of crab. was again very good. She also ordered a salad, a bit boring but still looked good and plentiful. Another person in our party order the soup and pork prix fix and she said the pork chop was amazing. So what's the reason for the less stars? It's not my scene. Not really a place i would go to on my own or necessarily again. I suggested to my fiance if he was to go to take a client to impress.",,,1

They are here to enjoy the longevity of an institution brought by staff that has worked in the place since dinosaurs roamed the earth. The latter is one of the club's greatest assets. When the irreplaceable bathroom attendant ""The Rev"" passed away some years back it justified an article in The New York Times. I was also personally saddened to learn of his passing. How many other restaurant service staff in town would you be able to give the same credit?Speaking of media articles, the club hold one of the city's most impressive wine lists. Another article was generated some time back, this one in The Daily Mail, when two diners to the club spent $16k on two bottles of Bordeaux. That's a lot of media coverage that but The 21 Club has just the kind of history to give such occurrences the authenticity to make them true happenings.While the restaurants famous Chicken Hash still remains on the menu at nearly $50 it is something you can easily skip for the Steak Tartare which is made to perfection on a classic recipe with unquestionable produce. You can't ask for a better place in town to provide you with Old Fashioneds either, none of that mushed cherry to be found here. All in all you shouldn't be visiting The 21 Club for the menu however. While the food won't disappoint you it is a mere distraction to the ambiance and setting. If restaurants where ranked by the influence and networth of their clients The 21 Club would stand head and shoulders above the pack.",1,,1

We went there for up stair at 21. But we got to walk around and had a small tour of the restaurant. First of all, i have to mention the services are what bring customers back. Waiter is very helpful and mindful of what we do. They are all knowledgeable about the place and history. The selection on their pre-fix menu is awesome. We got our 4 course meals. We were completely full and satisfied after the 3rd course. We couldnt even finish our main entree. No complaint there.

They have old Hess trucks, toys, bottles, mugs, and etc. hanging off the cieling, I thought was pretty cool and different.  Now onto the food, for appetizers we ordered the Shashimi, and Venison pot pie, both were simply amazing.

Not like other reviewers who experienced (or complained) poor service or long waiting time, we didn't have any problem during the course of our meal. However, I feel like something is missing... just don't feel rating 4 stars for this place. Idaho trout was good but didn't deserve its $34 price tag.

Almost identical to the style you get in France at the best bistros. He got the chicken hash which was huge and smothered with cheese and spinach.

Jackets required for men, and hosts who greet everyone at the door as if they are the restaurants best customer, rather than acting like they are doing you a favor as in so many restaurants here.The building is beautiful on the inside, reminiscent of dinner scenes from Madmen, you feel like you are at a fancy dinner in 1968 minus the cigarette smoke.Waiters in tuxes, table stewards in white dinner jackets, and a wine steward who still carries a tastevin.The menu is simple, and the dishes perfectly executed.We ordered off of the restaurant week 3 course menu for $38 each:Appetizers - Cucumber Gazpacho and grilled Calamari over ratatouille.Both excellent, the Gazpacho crisp and refreshing, the calamari perfectly grilled over a delicious Ratatouille.Entree - Orecchiette with roasted vegetables and Scottish SalmonThe pasta was very fresh with a kick of red pepper.Salmon perfectly executed, medium rare. The plating was particularly pleasing.Dessert - Peach tart and a fresh fruit plate.The fruit plate came with a white wine sorbet that was the highlight of the evening. The wine list here is extensive... like 300 pages extensive, and they have some very expensive wines, yet we were able to find a reasonably priced bottle or 2011 Mount Eden Chardonnay for $50.The restaurant week menu for $38 is an unbeatable deal for dinner at an NYC icon.",7,,1

My wife asked if the tuna was spicy, she was told no. It was too spicy. Our main courses were fine. Burger was excellent but not sure if worth $36 on its own. The ambiance is lovely. I should have stuck with the house Hobbs cabernet however. After a glass of the house  Hobbs, I ordered a 2011 Bordeaux and they brought me a 2013 without declaring the updated year. Then took the sommelier's recommendation on a 2010 Bordeaux (in theory better than 2011) and it felt turned. I felt like I couldn't send back another bottle.

Once our table was ready, we were seated in a dimly lit, romantic feeling room with toys adorning the ceiling. I thought it added a fun vibe to the otherwise serious place. For an appetizer I got the salmon and crab tartare, for my entree I got the leg of lamb, and for dessert I got the frozen yogurt parfait. All were amazing. The service was very attentive too, always refilling drinks and the courses came out in a timely manner. This is a great formal dinner spot that doesn't feel too stuffy. They do their best to make everyone feel like their most important customer. From the way the host pulls out the chairs for each person before everyone sits down, to the bathroom attendants, this is just a very high class place. I'll be back for special occasions to come.

It's most known for the toy automobiles hanging off the ceiling (Coca-cola truck, firetrucks, airplanes, etc.). They speak for nostalgia. Reminiscing childhood - innocent times of our lives. This is the perfect date spot (although I came here with my gang). You simply will not run out of things to talk about with your date, and it's a dining experience she will not forget, and will recount to her friends.There are the framed vintage photos on walls, and auburn-colored wooden interior, dimly-lit dining rooms to give an intimate feel.

123,Queenie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,125,263,3.0,2/25/2014,"Between ""a fan"" and ""a-ok"", I regretfully must pick an ""a-ok"" rating. I went there yesternight for restaurant week, and like most yelpers, I received a fluctuating service. The hosts, white jacket waiter, coat check lady, and doorman were superb, smiling and very polite. However, the rest of the servers were subpar. They weren't terrible but lack professionalism. I have been to numerous high end restaurants, and no matter how we are dressed the servers professionalism does not, and should not, change.Whether the servers we got were just having a bad day, or they were stereotyping us as ""cheap tippers"" or ""low class"" individuals, their reactions for a high end restaurant is unacceptable. I am fair, because if they were only a, let's say 2 star restaurant, I'll rate them as that. However, when you regularly, restaurant week aside, charge customers $34 for tuna tartare, I expect a certain service.First, they NEVER removed the bread or the dishes and instruments affiliated with eating the bread. This substantially decreased our table space causing unnecessary noise every time the server tried to put the food onto our table.Second, after I ordered the restaurant week dishes, I wanted to order more off the regular menu. The server in the black jacket just stretched out his hand and wanted to take my menu. I looked at him for a second to see if he'll withdraw his outstretched hand. ( I wanted to give him a chance to amend his reaction, he did not). I handed him the menu. Third, as a high end restaurant you NEVER say ""you done?"" You always politely ask, ""are you done, sir/madam"" before stretching out a hand to take the dish. There are other minor complaints, but I think I've made my point. These servers were snobby, and not classy. Classy is to present someone the professional and/or knowledgeable front the customer lacks. In a classy setting, the customer might feel inadequate because they are not accustomed to restaurant etiquette, and the server will gently nudge the customer in the right direction. It is NOT, the server BEING inadequate. (Please see my comments above).  If the server lacks that professional front, they are no longer classy. They are merely snobby, and I will not stand for that. I would have given this place two stars, if not for the other great servers and exceptional designs. The ceiling was just so amazing, filled with toys and football helmets. Coupled with classic wood furniture and small iron statutes, it was a sight to be seen. The food, is just okay. They certainly need a switch up the chefs. I have had better tuna tartare, fresher crab cakes, and ice cream that wasn't half melted when it was served. *Shakes my head* I was looking forward to this place too. Its not a surprise when I say the ""class"" and food of this place does not match the price of the menu.",4,,

It's a decent midtown restaurant, although I do understand that it's probably the history and legacy of the place that contributes to its reputation more than anything else. The space is interesting - a fancy bar area at front with plush carpeting, an almost salon-like room to the side where I believe there was a private party, and then a dining room that reminded me of JG Melon's more than anything else. The food was decent but actually pretty forgettable - I've already forgotten what I had here last night. Service is friendly and helpful.

My family had reservations for 4 on Friday December 30th.  My family includes me, my wife, and my 18 and 14 yr old sons.2.) The hostess called my wife 4 times in total to verify our reservation and also to make sure we were aware that sport-coats are required for me.  We were told this when we made the reservations, so we didn't need to be reminded 4 times.3.) We arrived on time and the Maitre D checked us in and took us to our table.  For two of my family to get to their seats the table needed to be pulled out because our table was 4"" apart from another table that had guests.  I was on the end and it was next to the waiter's butler station where they fill glasses with ice take care of minor items.  It was literally a revolving door of wait staff shuffling in and out within a few inches of me.  I have no issue what the butler station.  My disappointment was the distraction and how close it was to me.  We requested to be placed at another table and they did accommodate.  I don't know for sure, but my thought was because we had a young family perhaps they thought this was the best place to put us.4.) head waiter.  I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  I was surprised I wasn't offered a choice.  When he finally asked if we would like appetizers I ordered a seafood tower and his exact words were ""for the whole table to share?""  I nodded yes.  Wasn't sure what that meant exactly as I've never witnessed one person eat a tower by himself.5.) The menu was not described.  There were not recommendations offered.6.) head waiter. We never saw him again after our order was placed.  We did have a couple other waiters help us, but I bought this was very strange.7.) my opinion and I'll try to be constructive.  My guess is that if one Is a regular and also from NYC or someone that is well-known you will be just fine.  You likely know what to expect because you have been there before.It is an established restaurant that has been around a very long time and there is a lot of history.  There are toys hanging from the ceiling which is a strange decor for the menu.  My opinion is they don't need to try very hard because of their deep history.  We were in NYC for a week and ate at two other steakhouses and had the complete opposite experience.  They worked hard to serve us and the quality of the food was much better.I do not recommend Club 21 to any person who is visiting NYC.",,,

That was where Donald learned not to bend down and shovel his food into his mouth like Kasich.  Things have changed and now the food is top notch.

The overall lunch took 2.5 hours, which was longer than expected, so keep that in mind.I would come back for business meetings for sure. Super swanky with a jacket required.

The salmon was so tender and the peaches and vegetables complemented it nicely. Although it was overall a good experience for me, the place was a bit too hot. It seemed like there was poor air circulation so having central air would have been nicer. Tables nearby also had issues with that. Additionally, I felt that the waiter rushed us a bit.

I was baffled and did not know where to go to try it for the first time. I did an extensive research and stumbled upon 21 Club. It had a lot of great reviews and videos. Therefore, I decided to go with 21 Club to try steak tartare for the first time in my life. It was good. Really good! Tastes a lot different than cooked meat. It was so good, that I ended up having it two more times, for a total of three visits to 21 Club. If you are scared to try it, don't be. You'll fall in love with it after the first bite. As for the atmosphere, being there makes you feel like you are in a 50's movie. Warning: For men, jackets are required. No exceptions. Aside from their exceptional steak tartare, I also had Big Eye Tuna Tartare and Crab Cake which I also recommend. 21 Club Sauce is also pretty good. Foie Gras Terrine, Romanesco Cauliflower Almondine, and Crème Brûlée Tasting I would not recommend as they were all lackluster. See photos below.",,,

147,S M.,"New Canaan, CT",0,171,0,4.0,4/2/2017,"We had not been to '21 in a number of years and had heard that it was not so great under new management.  I'm happy to report that we had a different experience.  Our party of four sat at the bar first and had wine/cocktails.  The bartender was friendly and helpful, offering me a taste of a wine I was unfamiliar with.  They were very relaxed about our taking our table and encouraged us to sit at the bar as long as we liked.  The Bar Room dining area is an absolutely wonderful old New York relic.  Fortunately the furniture has been updated and improved without losing that clubby old school vibe.  While I don't think the titans of industry come here the way they used to (President Trump notwithstanding..), and I believe there were many tourists in the crowd, the overall impression was of a lot of nice well heeled people enjoying a festive Saturday night.  I think their rigid dress code helps with this.On to the menu and the food.  We found everything we ordered to be beautifully presented and pretty delicious.  The tomato and oyster soup was a hit with those who ordered it.  I had a perfect little raviolo with buttery sauce and an egg cooked in.  This would be a great lunch entree with a salad as it was very rich.  The old standard entrees were there and the chicken hash is as good as it ever was.  Such an old-fashioned, comforting dish!  The chicken paillard is good and very pretty, topped with salad and surrounded by micro-chopped vegetables.  The burger was all it ever has been, which is good.  (Tip - if you are planning to order the burger, sit at the bar and order it there, $15 less expensive!)  The only miss on the entrees was the Dover sole which was OK but definitely NOT worth its $72 price tag.  Desserts were rich, flavorful and definitely old school:  rice pudding, profiteroles, BAKED ALASKA which was flambé at the table - when was the last time you even heard of Baked Alaska?  We loved them all.  Overall this was a very fun evening but I would be remiss if I did not comment on the service.  We had several different staff attending our table and even so, the service was slow and sloppy.  We waited a long time before even having a drink order taken and one of the drinks was forgotten and never arrived.  Also a long wait between the delivery of menus and the taking of orders and a pretty long wait between courses. All in all it took three hours to complete dinner.  We had a great time but that seems like a slow pace.Final comment and the reason for the fourth star - the decor and vibe of this place take you back to a glamorous NYC that doesn't exist anymore.  Really fun to revisit that even for a night.",1,,

My husband and I arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation and were promptly ignored by an amazingly obnoxious maitre d, that is until 5 minutes had passed at which point he decided to look us up and down (I guess that was his way of assessing whether or not we fit the restaurant's dress code - in hindsight I wish we hand't so we could spend our lunch money elsewhere) and showed us to our table.We were then ""greeted"" by our waiter who seemed rushed and was quite rude. For the first course I had the crab and salmon tartare. Small portion and FISHY - you could smell it on its way to the table. I forced a bite down before I threw in the towel - I didn't want to risk getting food poisoning. The Short Rib was terribly bland. It was way over cooked, very dry and again of a very small portion. For dessert I had the caramel banana sundae - the only highlight of the meal but really, anyone can make a sundae. The meal and waitstaff both left much to be desired. In summary, 21 Club offers small portions of poor food served by pretentious waiters in a dated atmosphere. I find myself wondering how the 21 Club remains in business but I guess that they capitalize on their reputation.WORST RESTAURANT I'VE BEEN TO IN A LONG TIME. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",4,,
149,Peter Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",644,636,415,4.0,8/2/2013,"Came here for restaurant week with a couple of friends, and ordered straight from that menu. The interiors are really cool when you first enter, with that feeling of having stepped into a chapter meeting of a secret society. Everyone is dressed to the nines, with jackets and ties everywhere. I'm personally not a huge fan of the jacket requirement, but I do love the formal attire. The clientele is either well-off, young people or some more established older folks. Definitely a few lookers here and there.Having said that, the actual dining area inside was a bit unexpected. First of all, the ceilings were extremely low, making this place feel super small. It didn't help that the area wasn't too large in the first place, making it feel extra cramped. Second, there were a bunch of random helmets and objects hanging from the ceiling, which erased some of that classiness you first felt. The food itself was alright, but I honestly expected more for something of this caliber. My grilled shrimp appetizer was probably my favorite out of the 3-course meal, with the miso-glazed salmon and vanilla bean crème brûlée not too far behind. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted fine, but nothing really blew me away.What bumps this place up to four-stars, however, are their complementary macaroons and white chocolate pieces and their parking deal. They have a parking agreement with the nearby Central Parking Garage (31 west, 52nd st), where you can park for 6 hours at the mere price of $10. This is an absolute steal when it comes to parking, and alone makes up for the price of the food.Just be wary though, because only the 31 west, 52nd st location has a deal with the restaurant. Any of the other Central Park Systems don't count towards the discount (I learned this the expensive way).Overall, I've had better food, but the location and parking is unbeatable.",2,1,1

Jeans and sneakers are not permitted.""So, my party didn't really realize this, and had to walk back to change, it was like 4 degrees weather outside. Yeah, not happy.... but plus side is when we went back, my younger brother, who was visiting and didn't bring a jacket, wasn't turned away, instead they lent him a jacket to wear. The food was alright considering it was the restaurant week's menu. They didn't have a separate menu for restaurant week, instead it was marked with a figure on the side. The whole lay out was really cute and clever. It was just too bad, I couldn't get a picture because I had to walk so long outside, my phone's battery froze (yes, I need a new phone). So, it has been a couple of weeks since my visit, which is most of the case when I actually write my reviews because I want it to settle in before I actually do (any not do anything too rash or too in the heat of the moment, and if something really stands out, it will stay in memory). Anyways, the food didn't really stand out, pretty mediocre, not horrible nor great. The service was alright, they were nice enough to keep our table until we came back almost 45-1 hour later. However, as I have learned after my meal, you can go around and tour around the building. We didn't realize that was an option and plus, the receptionist didn't seem too happy with us being either, he kind of glared at us till we left. So we got out asap. But I really did enjoy the decor on the ceiling in the restaurant. Will I come back? Probably not, if there is no special, the food isn't really worth its original price, nor is the service.

160,Ginger P.,"Los Angeles, CA",356,319,262,3.0,2/17/2015,"Why have I eaten at so many steak houses when I eat steak so rarely? One big reason is I've been married for 11 years and when my father-in-law comes to visit for Christmas, he only wants to eat at steak houses. So, I have eaten at almost all of the NY institutions. As an aside, I worked as a hostess at Keen's when I moved to NYC and have some amazing memories, and the funny thing was I was a strict vegetarian at the time. I never ate their steak when I worked there.We did the Christmas prix fixe at 21 Club, and my father-in-law liked the atmosphere and the caroling, although they only sang to half the room and skipped us. I still remember my elk loin game medley was good, but everyone else was nonplussed by the experience. This was a few years ago, and it was a hefty price tag.I know their kitchen went through some rough patches there for a while. But that's what restaurant week is for.

161,Mister M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0,3.0,3/14/2015,"I had heard good things about this place so I went there for dinner with a friend during Restaurant Week to check it out. While the food itself wasn't bad, the overall ambience was a bit off-putting. A few notes: -Food: The food and drinks were decent--nothing that will blow you away--but decent enough. I stuck with the Restaurant Week menu so perhaps I didn't get the full 21 Club experience, but I figured a specialized menu would showcase at least a few standouts; unfortunately nothing really stood out for me. -Atmosphere: The clientele looked surprisingly diverse. I thought it'd be predominantly musty old men but saw a mixed crowd. Unfortunately for us, we were seated next to some eyeroll-worthy guy who very much liked hearing the sound of his pseudo-European accent and enjoyed unnecessarily flipping his scarf throughout his dessert cheese platter. At one point, we heard this individual ask the waiter about the Restaurant Week crowd. The waiter, perhaps to humor the customer (who clearly fancied himself a regular), said something like, ""Yeah, they'll come, order from the Restaurant Week menu, and we won't see them again until the summer [when Restaurant Week returns],"" after which they both chuckled. Pretty obnoxious commentary from the waiter and a ""regular"" (who, by the way, was basically seated in the Solange section of the restaurant #justSaying). -Dress Code: I got scolded for taking my jacket off after we were already seated and had started eating. I understand having a dress code to get in and wanting to create a particular vibe among customers, but you don't need to get your panties in a twist just because a customer is getting overheated.-Bathroom Attendant: The men's bathroom has someone there to ""help"" you wash your hands, something that I've been doing myself for a few years now and which I had thought was limited to pretentious, overpriced clubs in the Meatpacking District. Overall, I wouldn't return here (not even for Restaurant Week over the summer).",2,,

I understand that during restaurant week, some restaurants might not pay full attention to the services and delicacy of food as they usually do. However, no restaurants can be ruder and more insincere than 21 club. The service was horrible from the very beginning. The waiter who took our order was condescending and impatient, just because we had some questions about the menu and took a bit longer to decide what to have. I mean excuse me isn't it very normal? What's more, they charged us $6 per person for just hot water. HOT WATER FOR $12!!! After I expressed my confusion, another extremely rude guy came to explain impatiently about how hot water was counted as service, so it was charged reasonably. He even rolled his eyes on me. Which restaurant on earth hires waiters who roll their eyes on customers!!!!??? Anyway it was a total waste of 2 hours of my precious life and $50. I will NEVER EVER EVER visit this restaurant again. If a restaurant does this badly during restaurant week, it definitely says something about its performance in general. I will not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant, well, unless you feel like wasting your time and money. Good luck 21 club! Keep losing the tradition and competition in New York City, where so many good restaurants are improving and booming!I wish I could've asked the names of these two rudest waiters who took orders and explaining ridiculous charge of hot water, but they are both in suits.

As you can see in any photos of the dining room there are hundreds of toys hanging from the ceiling. They looked very clean! But really, if you do not clean them thoroughly EVERY day with a LIQUID then you're not doing a good and safe job protecting your customers.Who knows how old those specs were and how many of them made their way into our gullets? I say get rid of them. It's disgusting.",1,,

I don't know if we have ever been treated as poorly as we were by the staff at 21 Club. From the hostess looking us up and down when we arrived to the sommelier treating us with condescension, the service was absolutely horrible. We were either ignored or creepily stared at. Meanwhile, the restaurant was half empty. The food was also sub-par. My $36 burger tasted like an over-priced snack bar item. And I'm pretty sure the fries were frozen. It's their loss treating us so poorly as we live in the city and will never recommend this place to anyone. Big mistake. Big. Huge.",,3,

We had a large group of executives, and the waiters kinda stand there and stare at you while you eat, which i thought was uncomfortable. Then you go to the washroom, and the guy inside stands there and stares at you, again super uncomfortable. I got the salmon, which was dry and not very tasty, couldn't even finish half of it.

The service was attentive, the cocktails strong, and the food was very good.In fact, the only thing kind of off-putting about the whole place was the decor. I don't get why i have to dress up in a jacket, dress shoes, no jeans to be in a place with football helmets and killer whale statuettes hanging from the ceiling. It's like some harvard frat douche did the decor 30 years ago and it hasn't changed sinceI picture some winklevoss looking dickhead holding his gamma delta sigma paddle going ""Wilmers, that bear statue is perfect in that corner.

179,Jamie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",24,165,1,5.0,8/13/2014,"I have wanted to eat here ever since I was a little girl growing up in hillbillyville, reading about the glamorous lives of stars (of literature and film) in the 30's - 50's, and this restaurant was frequently mentioned. I thought I was making my reservation for restaurant week, but wasn't really paying attention to what I was doing, and wound up making it for a Saturday evening, NOT restaurant week. HA. I'm going to be feeling the sting for a while, but it was worth it.We dressed appropriately: suit and tie for my husband, dressy dress for me.  We came early so we could have drinks beforehand. When our cab pulled up (my shoes were NOT made for walking), a restaurant employee opened the cab door for us and helped me out.  We were greeted by the maître d and shown to the bar.The bar is the standout here.  They had my favorite gin AND they buy the tonic water in glass bottles. If you really like gin and tonic, you know tonic from a soda gun is just sub par. It's always, always flat, so the fact that they spring for the little Canada Dry bottles (the tiny glass ones, none of that cheap plastic bottle crap here) was a huge selling point.  The pours are extremely generous.Of note: the bartender asked if we were dining and when we said yes, he put the drinks on our dinner tab.   We had assumed we'd tab out at the bar and use a card.  We had no cash and there was no way we weren't tipping the bartender, so my husband ran across the street to an ATM.  Just remember that: bring some cash to tip the bartender if you're eating here.When the maître d approached to let us know our table was ready, we asked for a few extra minutes which was graciously granted. The table, incidentally, was one I had requested specifically, and I got it.  Yes, it's where Dorothy Parker sat! I'm a rube!  They asked me, ""this is your favorite table?""  which made me sound like a regular and not a rube, which was appreciated.We got to the table and were greeted by I think a bus person or assistant. We were brought bread, water, etc.  The sommelier came by and when we told him our price range and what kind of wine we liked, he suggested a wine that seriously blew our socks off.  I saved the receipt so I could track the wine down locally.  It was every single thing we wanted, and about $40 less than our limit.We had the foie gras terrine, I had chicken, my husband had steak. The chicken was nice and juicy, the steak was delicious as well, cooked perfectly.  I had profiteroles, and my drunkard husband had a scotch for dessert.  They brought him some complimentary petit fours, which was nice. Everything was really good.The restaurant does close kind of early, 11 pm.  We were enjoying the desserts, running our mouths, and they had to tell us they were closing. Oops. Sorry, we were having too good a time to leave! Can we move in?We'll definitely be back.  If you're looking for a quiet, old school place to have drinks after work (and I do work in the area, so I do see this becoming a regular thing, yikes), this will do it. The music is Sinatra, etc., my favorite, and low enough you can enjoy the music while still hearing the people you're with. Great ambiance.If you're looking for a place to really splurge in a traditional way, this is it.  The ambiance, the service, it's all amazing. This is IT, the last of the great New York restaurants. The Stork is gone, El Morocco is gone, but 21 remains. And now I know why.",3,2,2

The serving staff (big thumbs up to John T., Chauncey, and Rosalita) was dressed sharp, attentive and not overbearing or stuffy, as well as all having a welcoming attitude. Started with big eye tuna tartare and foie gras. My cholesterol probably hit 500 but it was worth it. Duck l'orange and steak tartare were outstanding.

For the first drink I ordered, I was told they'd run out of one of the ingredients. My second choice brought the bartender over to our table to inform me that she hated that drink, I'd ordered the two worst on the menu (an alcoholic root beer float and a Fly Boat Irish Coffee), and could I please ask for something else. While I appreciated the candor, I don't understand why they put items on a menu that they then won't prepare and don't enjoy.The lobster mac and cheese was far too fishy, and nowhere near enough cheese. I couldn't finish it. I watched our table neighbors make the same mistake and give up on their mac and cheese partway through as well.While there were a number of good foods, appetizers and desserts that were enjoyable, the overall experience did not meet the standard set by their prices. They were generally slow and unresponsive. I would not return, I would not recommend.",1,,

And the food at 21 is better than good if not a tad shy of excellent.

The tuna tartare is also stellar.  The wife had the Dover sole which was complex, buttery and wonderful....I didn't have as good of an experience with my filet.  I ordered medium rare and got medium well. Chauncey, the waiter took it off the bill and when I thanked him he was surprised I didn't expect him to do so.Service from Chauncey was wonderful, but our first waiter asked if we were going to a show (we were and had limited time) but then ignored us for 15 minutes until Chauncey came by.

190,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,5.0,2/4/2012,"It's only appropriate that I begin my review of 21 Club with a notorious quote from the indomitable Groucho Marx:""I don't want to belong to any club that will accept people like me as a member.""Ok, it's not really a club but it's a landmark that has been frequented by legends of the screen, captains of industry and just about everyone in between. And for three glorious hours I felt like a member of a private club, receiving white glove service (Literally. The white gloved bathroom attendant joked that fellow yelper in crime Benson Y and I were taking the spots belonging to Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.) While 21 earned notoriety during the roaring 20's when Prohibition reigned supreme (Such an uncivilized time when vices were illegal...) , the repeal of the 18th amendment means you can legally drink here again. 23 skidoo!The complimentary bar munchables were quite good, roasted nuts and such. There's a fireplace! With real fire! The 1% and restaurant week 99% never had it so good.Led into the dining room, turn your head upwards. No, it's not rude and you'll be treated to a panoply of toys and memorabilia. A Cincinnati Reds hat from Pete Rose, a walmart truck donated by Sam Walton, and plenty of other corporate swag. Apparently this tradition dates back to when British Airways donated a toy, it was mounted and the rest is history. (Perhaps bars that feature womens' undergarments in similar positions share a spiritual bond with 21?)Anyway, our waiter was all too happy to explain ,with ease, the menu and the historical importance of our table.I like places that have such cachet but I also like places that deliver the goods, food-wise.No problems here as the regular menu offering of a mixed grilled wild game platter was expertly explained and carved by our waiter. He even name dropped where 21 purchases such exotic cuts as antelope. At $46, it cost more than a regular prix fixe resto week for one but here's what it contained:antelope chop, Millbrook venison loin, homemade rabbit sausage, bacon-wrapped Mangalitsa pork loin, carrot purée, ginger chutney, huckleberry sauce .How could one possibly refuse? 8 people were able to amply share a bit of each piece. I'd return just for this plate alone.Regaining fiscal sanity, I ordered from the restaurant week menu and started with the salmon tartare, served with taro chips. And as a stand alone appetizer this was quiet good but I must be brutally honest. It didn't have a chance next to the mixed grilled wild game platter (MGWGP). The taro chips were crunchy and were a fine complement to the salmon tartare, serving as a reminder of what healthy eating could be as I gorged upon rabbit sausage, feeling the blood lust du lapin.Time for a breather and a glass of malbec, recommended by ever helpful waiter.Resume feasting.Up next, Coffee-Chili Rubbed Pork Loin with sweet potato purée, chestnuts, roasted Brussels sprouts and  Oaxaca chocolate sauce.This was easily one of the juiciest pork loins I've ever had in my loin consuming career, the kind of loin that should make pig eaters across the world unite and realize that pork is so much more than the other white meat.And hats off to brussels sprouts for these veggie orbs were also flavorful, especially when dipped into oaxaca chocolate sauce.The chocolate sauce was more savory than sweet, serving as a transition to dessert, the flourless chocolate torte with peanut rum sauce and chantilly cream.It's as if Captain Morgan put a little captain in a bottle of Skippy.The peanut rum sauce was by far the distinguishing characteristic of an otherwise par for the course flourless chocolate torte. The peanut rum sauce pushes the rank over the edge of four stars and into five star heaven.So our crew of intrepid eaters, occupying a table that has  seated the incumbent president, Hilary Clinton and Dag Hammerskjold back in the day (Daaag!) staggered out well fed and ready for a return trip.Gents, wear a jacket please.

Lighting design is inconsistent and plain ugly.Why am I obsessing with the decor so much ?Well - you definitely would not come to this place for the food. Rumor has it that it used to be worse. But what you are getting for a horrendous price tag is simply an insult.I had braised short ribs. They were ok but everything was sort of bland, overcooked and smushy. Tuna tartar as an appetizer was completely bland.The sauces have no taste and no kick and could have come out of a can.To remind you: A burger at this place is 34 bucks.

The romantic couple sharing an expensive bottle of wine, a group of girls out for a classy girls night, and the gobs and gobs of well-dressed super rich men at the bar, with gaggles of young pretty girls hanging over their elbows.  It's a sight to be seen for sure. As for me and my hubby, we came here for the WINE LIST, which is Ah-mazing!  Both of us had perused the wine list in advance.  You can download the ""Wine Spectator Grand Award"" winning wine list, all 84 pages of its glory), on their website or right here: 4c6c364fdf1082a37bcf-544…The wine list is divided by regions and the wine list has been so carefully put together to show you the maps of the regions and even the appellations and the vineyards themselves.  It's fun just to look at the wine list and all the maps. If you thumb through the wine list, you'll quickly notice that many of the bottles are sold for minimum $200-500, and upwards of several thousand dollars!  This is not wine for the novice!  Fortunately, there is a sommelier who is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful; bonus - he won't turn his nose up if you tell him your price range.  However, get ready to speak wine the right way - you can tell the sommelier ""Yes, I'd like a red wine from the Burgundy region of France, vintage 2005-2010, fruity, preferably with some green apple tastes, but dry and well-balanced.""  He will provide you options in your price range, and you won't be disappointed.

198,Jenn K.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,1,3.0,11/26/2015,"Just came from a disappointing Thanksgiving dinner from a once-venerated NYC icon.Upon entry into the lounge area I was impressed with the ambience -- it felt like the home of one's (imaginary) wealthy Upper East Side grandparents. All the patrons, including the kids, were beautifully turned out. When we were sat in the bar room with its checkered tablecloths and plastic toys hanging above, I was charmed.When tasting the crab cake which was made of gorgeous lump crab with very spare usage of binder, I was impressed. And that's where the upward momentum ended.In an uneven spiral in which the overall trend was downward, the rest of the meal failed to meet expectation. I ordered the classic turkey dinner which was accompanied by Brussels sprouts, sweet potato purée and chestnut dressing.The turkey was very dry and beyond assisting with gravy. The sprouts tasted like they had probably been good when first pulled off the stove a couple hours prior. The sweet potato purée was smooth and sweet and...that's it. Smooth and sweet. The dressing was quite tasty with its crunchy chestnuts but I have a nagging feeling that it seemed better than it actually was because the turkey was so absurdly sad.My spouse's pumpkin pie tasted like it had just been pulled from the local grocery store. My apple tart was a brighter spot, with its buttery flaky crust.Then the check came. With three cocktails, our dinner for two came to nearly $400. For me, that shoved the meal from the realm of acceptability into the land of disappointment, and quickly slanted my perception of the atmosphere from being one of quirky charm to self-important childishness.Last night we had dinner at another restaurant, where the check came dangerously close to $1000. Yet it was, incredibly, worth every dime. Is 21 Club the same type of place, where one can pay an enormous check but feel it was worth it?No.",1,,
