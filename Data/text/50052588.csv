0,Jessica C.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",13,75,39,4.0,8/30/2018,"One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. The food here is very delicious and the service here is equally amazing! I always get a freshly squeezed grapefruit juice before starting on a glass of mimosa. My favorite dish is the eggs Benedict, but there has been a few times my dish was a tad bit over salted. The mussels is always my go to appetizer and is always consistently delicious. I recommend if you're looking for a new brunch to check out. I also suggest you make a reservation because the wait can get pretty lengthy. If not you could always sit and eat at their bar. It's huge and honestly if it speeds up the process for getting great food, why not?",,,1
1,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",976,190,913,1.0,10/2/2018,"Going into Henriks I had high expectations because I love brunch and their menu sounded quite impressive. That being said it was far from meeting any expectations that I had. We had reservations for our brunch date but walking in we didn't need them as the the restaurant was empty except for three tables. That should of been the warning from right there. But we decided to try it out anyway. I ordered a sparkling water and a cappuccino. She brought me a club soda. Not that big of a deal except, I like it when the sever tells you that it's club soda. I asked her that if I could just get a sprite as I do not care for club soda. She tells me that they have sparkling water but it's a large bottle. I told her that was fine. I would rather have that. Annoying. We started off with oysters. They were unique only because they had crème fraiche and roe on top. Interesting. Then I ordered lobster eggs benedict. It looked amazing. It really did. When I tasted it there was no flavor in both the hollandaise and the lobster. I thought that was just weird. Very weird. But she never came back to check on us. I tried to wave down another server and she looked our way and said ""I'll get your server"", yet never did. I was just annoyed and irritated at that point. I asked for our check and got the hell out of there. Final thought: if you're looking for some good sparkling water, cappuccino and oysters then this is the place for you. Otherwise save your money and go somewhere else.",2,,1
2,Florence K.,"Manhattan, NY",18,80,192,4.0,8/29/2018,"What a gem. Food is amazing, especially for the area. There are lots of crappy restaurants in the kips bay/murray hill area but this one is now on my top 5. Ambiance is dark and romantic/cool, guests are generally in late 20s-40s on a Friday night for dinner. Only negative thing I can think of is... the noise level was real loud when I was there. Otherwise, excellent.",,,
3,Meredith S.,"New York, NY",61,100,114,4.0,11/11/2018,"The food here is above average. My friend had the butternut squash ravioli and I enjoyed the pork belly risotto. The pork was very tender and the risotto was well prepared. We also shared the chocolate cake for dessert which tasted slightly frozen, but was delicious nonetheless! The ambiance is very nice here. It does get very crowded and loud during the evenings on the weekend so keep that in mind. Service was average and could have been better.",,,
4,Allix H.,"Manhattan, NY",337,135,438,4.0,10/29/2018,"We had come here for brunch (there is no boozy brunch here) and had ordered a few bloody Mary's, avocado eggs Benedict and lobster Mac and cheese. Their brunch drinks are $6 which is pretty reasonable. The avocado Benedict was really good although I'm not sure if I'd consider it a fresh avocado - it looked moreso like it came out of a package being that it was smeared onto the English muffin like a jelly. The lobster Mac and cheese was super creamy and delicious, although there could have been a bit more lobster in it! Overall it was nice experience and I would go back again.",1,,

Updated review","Just got a note from the owner who's response as you can see was beyond dismissive, and had the audacity to say ""glad you liked the coffee,"" a flip response to my saying that the bottled water and coffee were the only likable things. I can see why his staff is so terrible and spends more time chatting and texting than waitering and serving.",2,,1
6,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",119,301,527,3.0,10/14/2018,"I came here for an early dinner and it was just ok. I got the beet and mozzarella salad, but substituted it with tomatoes rather than beets. The salad was expensive for what it was ($17). It came with 3 small slices of mozzarella cheese and 1 tomato cut into 3 pieces. The mozzarella pretty much had no taste. The dressing on the salad portion was good, but had a little too much dressing. My friend got the pumpkin ravioli which was really good. The sauce that comes with it was great.",,,

Nice décor and good service. Prices are pretty reasonable. There are some good options on the menu enough to please most people. My all-time favorite is the lobster risotto.  It's creamy and flavorful. I've had lobster risotto at some other places in the city, but I have to say this is the best one. I've also tried the burger and it's really good as well. The truffle fries are delicious. The flourless chocolate cake is decent, but it didn't impress me that much. Overall, this is a great spot for a casual dinner. I might have to come back to try the happy hour the bar looks nice and cozy!",1,,
9,Angela S.,"Manhattan, NY",463,114,77,4.0,10/26/2018,"This place reminds me of a hotel restaurant. It has a clientele of businessmen, travelers, and people in their 20s-30s. I had the lobster eggs benedict - everything about it was perfect, except for the fact that I wish there was more of it. The pancakes, while pleasant in presentation, was actually quite dry and reminded me more of corn flour cake. Would definitely be higher up there on my list of brunch spots if it was a bit more affordable.",,,

11,Rachel B.,"El Segundo, CA",46,50,91,5.0,4/13/2018,"I was in town for work and wanted to grab a bite to eat in midtown. This place was a nice surprise. It was a Tuesday night, so the restaurant was relatively quiet and I was able to get myself a comfy table in the corner. My meal was fantastic! I had the mussels, which were kind of unique given that they were made with mustard in the wine sauce, which I loved. I then had the kale and quinoa salad, which also was very tasty. I will definitely go back when I am in town again!",1,,
12,david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,371,1028,4.0,7/20/2018,Stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and the restaurant was fairly quiet. The lunch was pretty awesome. Try the crab sandwich. Good stuff. I understand they have a very good brunch and it geta crowded on weekends. Will try one day,1,,1

14,Andrew F.,"Hoboken, NJ",215,24,11,3.0,11/17/2018,"Was looking for a new local spot with decor, drinks and food to match. After reviewing the website, Hendriks seemed to be a good bet. Upon arrival, the first flag was the menu in which the pricing for all items were higher than the website's menu, placing the restaurant into a more high $20s low $30s price point per main course, rather than a more casual reasonable pricing as listed on the website. Regardless of this, I was still looking forward to the drinks and food. The cocktail I ordered, the Cruel Intention was tough to drink and had to be returned. We ordered a bunch of appetizers instead of main courses which were palatable but nothing that stood out (French onion soup, salmon skewers, chickpea fritters, short rib arancini). Overall, the ambiance is nice, not too loud and good for a casual dining experience, but the food left much to be desired. Would more likely stop by for a beer after work, but probably won't be dining here again.",,,

Updated review","Had the joy of going here for brunch today when the quick breakfast spot on the next block informed us that they were not serving breakfast anymore. I ordered the english muffin crab cake, a mimosa, and a side of berries. Everything was delicious and well made. Only disappointment was that the menu listed the berries as being with whipped ricotta but was only with whipped cream, making the $8 price tag a little questionable.",,,
16,Clay K.,"Plant City, FL",2,25,2,4.0,11/5/2018,"Very good spot.  Impressed with every dish.  Big flavors but with nice complexity and balance.  Its pricey but it is one of the priciest neighborhoods in the world.  Also, atmosphere seems a little unsure of itself.  Its sort of casual but upscale.  Decor is hip with brick, wood, and Edison bulbs but then they play jazz.  Also beer selection is all the corporate mass-produced Inbev/Miller swill.  Service is above average.",,,
17,Steven P.,"Port Washington, NY",3,46,3,5.0,8/4/2018,"This is a throw back to the days of cheers.  Come here a few times and you are a known Entity.  This is a neighborhood pub/bar where the food and drinks keep you coming bk for more.  I can recommend the salmon and the calamari appetizer.  The absolutely best part of this establishment is a head bartender named Antigona. She basically is like the ring master of a well orchestrated circus.  Treat her well and you will be a devoted customer for life.  My best friend and I have been patrons for over 10 yrs.  Gona has taken care of us in a way that has never failed.  If your at a table ask to be seated with RJ.  He combines wit, sarcasm and candor in a way only a seasoned NY waiter can bring. This is the very soul of Manhattan.  A diverse staff and clientele that convey the amazing treats of the best city in the world.",2,,
18,Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",488,372,1050,3.0,2/21/2018,"Came here for lunch with my friend. I ordered the steak on baguette sandwich. It came with garlic Parmesan truffle fries. The sandwich was good, exactly what a steak sandwich would taste like. The fries were the best part of my meal. Each fry was crunchy and so flavorful. I ate more of the fries than my sandwich. My friend ordered the lobster Mac and cheese but since she's a vegetarian, she asked the waitress if she can have it without lobster and if the price could be cheaper. The waitress was extremely friendly about it and it was cheaper. My friend liked the Mac and cheese, it was a good portion. I would come again to try something else since I work nearby.",4,1,1
19,Gina M.,"New York, NY",79,180,42,4.0,2/11/2018,"Was able to get a reservation the day-of for a Saturday night which was key. This is not far from grand central, critical if you are meeting friends who are coming from out of town into the station.The ambiance is very cute, dimly lit, and a refreshing addition to the area--not the typical 'pub' and definitely a solid restaurant.We got the short rib arancini and fried calamari for apps--these were delicious--ESPECIALLY the short rib arancini!We all had the burger for entree which was good, but not phenomenal and came with parmesean fries.Next time, I will try the short rib entree, since the short rib app was so delicious!Service was great-attentive and not rushed!!",2,,
20,Johnson L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,116,2,3.0,4/10/2018,"Went with a friend (EW) on an early (8pm) Friday night with a reservation, took about 10 minutes to be seated and the host wasn't sure friendly nor was he a total jerk.  Just ""A-OK"" as Yelp likes to call it.For apps we got the short ribs and crab cake. We had thought they had screwed up the order since the former came out in this fried ball looking thing (wish I took a picture) but there was short rib inside, there wasn't any mention of the preparation on the menu so I can't fault them. They were surprisingly tasty and had a nice spicy sauce that came with it I don't really eat crab cakes so can't judge em but my friend wasn't impressed and said they weren't too firm and seemed frozen;  she is kinda snobby about these things so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.For entrees, I got the sea bass special of the night which came with some clams and shrimp, it was decent.  My friend got the lobster ravioli, also decent.  Nothing really blew me away.Not sure if it was because it was Friday but it was really really loud.  Sat at a table for four and I felt I had to yell to talk to my friend.  I've hit the age where I care about how loud certain places are....At the end of the day, the price didn't justify the venue/service/food.  It wasn't a terrible experience...I just would never go back.",,,

I chose the avocado benedict, which was great. The house mimosas and bloody marys were $6, which is an incredible deal for NYC. The staff was super friendly and accommodating.

30,Allen T.,"Queens, NY",290,185,395,4.0,6/13/2017,"Wow another Seamless favorite here. Looking for a healthy option for dinner, and the coworker recommends this place. their KALE SALAD is really good!!!! Too bad the portion sizes are really small. They give it to you in plastic bowl that isn't even half filled. I always have to order two of them ($11/ea) and combine them to fill up the whole plastic bowl. Bread they give is usually fresh nice and soft. The Calamari and french fries here are pretty good as well and I order them as a ""cheat"" meal. Calamri has peppers in them and when you dip with the sauce provided oh wow! The fries have little slivers of cheese on them and taste good even without ketchup! I have yet to try any of their main dishes.Price: If work wasn't paying for this I would think this is a tad expensive for food.Conclusion: On just a food perspective this place has yummy salads, calamari and fries!",,,
31,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1268,914,4.0,9/22/2017,"I recently went to Hendriks for an after work happy hour gathering.  This bar/restaurant is both elegant and modern at the same time.  They do not go overboard with the decor.  It is relatively dim inside with dark colors, wood and some nice long tables near the bar with more formal dining tables on the other side.  When we arrived it was around 5:30PM and it was mostly empty, which was great for us.  We sat at the long tables with bar style seats to enjoy the happy hour menu.The host and waitress were very quick to seat us and attend to us.  I ordered a glass of Malbec which was great.  I also ordered the chickpea fritters.  If you get these, I highly recommend asking for some type of dipping sauce.  They were a bit plain on their own, but a spicy sauce helped kick the flavor up.At no point were we pressured to drink or eat faster.  I think my party easily spent about 45 minutes there and our waitress checked on us the appropriate number of times so we could enjoy and feel taken care of.  This is a great spot to go to after work for dinner or a drink with friends.  I look forward to going back again.",2,,

We were super hungry so we agreed.The pancakes and French toast were absolutely delicious! The portions were perfect and the flavor was just right! I usually can never finish a whole meal to myself but was able to finish most of it that day. The French fries were crispy and perfectly seasoned! The coffee was perfect for our hangovers and definitely woke us all up! Our server was very friendly and attentive to our needs! She was quick and refilled our coffees without us even asking her to!

It was about half full, so plenty of choice for seats but still a nice ambiance. The lighting is quite dark (atmospheric) but adequate enough that you can still read your menu. On offer they have appetisers, salads, pasta and entrees. Throughout there are meat, poultry, seafood and vegetarian options. There's a wine list plus beer and cocktails. In short, you should be covered for options. In terms of the food I would say it was fine. I've only been here a couple of times in the 2 years I've live across the street - predominantly because it's nothing special.

Updated review","My sister and I were around the Murray Hill area a few days ago and were trying to find somewhere nice to eat and the first thing that popped in my mind was this place since I dined here last year. I remembered the service and food being excellent. So we decided to eat here. It was amazing just like last year! The host was great, the manager(Fernando) was amazing, so glad to see that the management turnover is not high. It was really nice to see a familiar face. Food wise, here is what we had:Apps: Crab cakes(original menu) and manila clams with scallop in tomato broth(daily special)- this was bombbbbbEntree: We got the salmon and sea bass. I LOVED the bass. Probably one of the best I had and I've had a lot of basses in my life lol. My sister was the one who got the salmon and she said it was excellent as well. My bass came with tostones which was a really nice touch to the lightness of the dish.Drinks: My sister got the white wine spritzer and she said it was amazing and very refreshing. They put a lemon twist in there which I don't see many places do. I had their rose which was very nice and complemented my dish.Dessert: no dessert although the menu looked good, we were way too full after all that. Vibe: Very cozy, casual, and intimate would be the best way to put it.Price: everything was very reasonably priced. Especially for the area. Good for: groups, casual date, and friendly dinnerService:Fernando and his team were very friendly and attentive to us and everyone in the restaurant.

First, happy hour from 4-7 p.m. $1 oysters and cocktails, champagne and wine for 7 bucks. Tip: arrive early, get drinks, have them at the bar then migrate to a table for dinner. The place is dark and romantic with a lot of candles. It's a gorgeous restaurant. Now for the food: I was starving after touring all day. Literally starving. I didn't know what to expect. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies for $18.00. Wow!!!!! It was incredible. My friend and I both ordered the dish and we both thought it was phenomenal. My other friend got the pork belly risotto ($18) and she also thought her dish was impeccable. This is a great spot for happy hour and dinner. You can't beat $1 oysters and cheap drinks in NYC. The next time I visit from California, I'll be sure to stop by! Thanks Hendriks!",3,1,1

Updated review","Simply NEVER disappoints!The most consistent food in the neighborhood. The quintessential NYC restaurant it's menu has something for everyone and each is executed to perfection.The staff is attentive without being overbearing and the atmosphere supports virtually all occasions. Take a window table for a quiet dinner or take a seat at the bar and mingle some, you won't be disappointed.  If it's crowded don't be afraid to have dinner at the bar as Luis or Antigona handle service with ease.",1,,

53,Lizzie Y.,"Thornwood, NY",1,5,516,4.0,2/13/2017,"I have been in the U.S. for several years but seldom do I tried real American brunch. I like the style of this undisturbed restaurant around the corner of the street, the mellow sunshine passes through the French window with romanticism. It's typical New York style decoration, and the waiters are typical gentlemen.【Classic Egg Benedict】Poached eggs, ham and English muffins...The poached eggs were brilliant: As the knife gently went down, the egg yolk trickles from the egg white, and immense the salty sweet ham. The English muffins under were crunchy, crispy, and you could hear the sound when you took a bite, while the thick egg yolk and the velvety egg white.【Steak and Eggs】Here the eggs are sunny-side up. Actually the baked potato on the sides of the two dishes were worth mentioning, too. They were completely soft and melting as it touched your tongue, and tasted just right with the ketchups. Egg yolk was trickling, which means the chef did a good job, and I suggest you eat the egg with the toasted bread. Steak was medium-rare, it was pinkish in the middle, thick, tender, and juicy which gives you a fantastic experience of chewing.【Pancake】Pancake was for extra and it came with ice-cream and blueberry jam. The pancake was thick so it provided satisfaction as you took a big bite. The taste was rich in milk and egg, and blueberry jam guided most of the sweetness so it wouldn't be so greasy. It has some solid grains inside which I assumed that the chef did this on purpose?I think I would recommend this restaurant. It isn't that popular so that there is no need to waste time on waiting, and you can enjoy a cozy, chilling eating experience here. The food was well-qualified with reasonable prices, size wasn't crazily big, and it has an excellent location near Grand Central.",1,1,1
54,Rick S.,"Valdosta, GA",0,7,0,4.0,5/27/2018,Good food and service. Came he with my family. Our favorites were the fontina omelette and avocado eggs Benedict. The americano is solid. Home fries very good.  Cool interior.,,,
55,Peter M.,"Manhattan, NY",32,29,1,2.0,4/28/2018,"I've eaten brunch here several times. The food is adequate, not great, and expensive. The portion sizes are adequate.

They forget to bring things and you have to ask repeatedly for salad dressing, condiments, etc.",,,
56,Sh. J.,"Queens, NY",27,25,0,1.0,5/17/2018,"The food was not bad. But the server was definitely rude and racist.

I love the look of the restaurant, although I will say it can get a little loud sometimes. Brunch is my favorite. The pancakes are hands down my favorite in NYC. They're made of cornmeal, which I do at home, but have not seen in a restaurant before. They don't do unlimited drinks, but brunch drinks are only $5 and they are gigantic. The burger is also amazing. Anytime I have friends visiting from out of town, we go here for brunch at least once. Dinner is equally as good and the prices are very reasonable. My favorites are the flat-iron steak, the rotisserie chicken, and pork belly risotto.",1,,

Nice decor, not a huge restaurant, but still had a full bar and excellent, honest, funny service (we had RJ as our server). Menu wasn't large and overbearing. We had a calamari appetizer (not overcooked at all unlike many places), chef's special sea bass entree, the babyback ribs, seared scallops, and the braised short ribs. Everything on each plate was delicious. My short ribs, so tender that my fork cut it-drool. I will say that it's a somewhat pricey meal but I left well satisfied. I would be happy to go back.",,,

The menu is new American but fairly diverse so if you have a large group.I had the pork chop and mashed potatoes which was the special. Well cooked (though they didn't bring out a steak knife until we asked so whatever) and the mashed potatoes were creamy and good. I also tried the chickpea fritters (okay) and the lamb meatballs (very good).Cocktail menu was pretty standard but my Manhattan was good. It was Sunday night and pretty empty but service was pretty slow.",,,

We were walking thru the Murray Hill area and my phone had died so I couldn't access Yelp to find bookmarks or restaurant reviews. Gasp. Stumbled upon this restaurant, peeked in and decided to give it a try. What a find! Ambiance.  The decor is warm, contemporary cozy, brick walls, interesting decor, wood tables and candle splashes. Lively feeling as their were groups of people eating at nearby tables.Service.  Fantastic. The host ended up being the owner and was very hands on, seating us, then checking in on us later - friendly, accommodating and took my phone to charge.  Server RJ was also amazing- friendly, witty, attentive and knowledgable about their food.  Food. Wonderful. There were several great food options and I had a tough time deciding.  I was hungry so went for a filling seeming mixed seafood pasta with a wine and garlic sauce instead of marinara. Wow. So incredible. The sauce was light and perfectly flavored.  Super Plump fresh little neck clams - a favorite of mine from when I grew up which I rarely have found and loved in this area - they were perfect. Mussels were also great, as were the scallops and shrimp. One of my favorite pasta dishes and they did not disappoint. My friend had chicken which was so perfectly flavored and tender. Mashed potatoes and veggies on the side- the Brussel sprouts I tasted also great.My old fashioned was fantastic.Definitely recommend for dinner with a date, friends or family.",5,3,5

Updated review","I came here for brunch on a Saturday with my friends because of the great reviews, and I was neither impressed nor disappointed. I ordered the eggs benedict, my friends ordered steak & eggs and a pancake on the side. Eggs benedict was good, steak was nice as well, but the portion overall was smaller than I expected. The restaurant was packed, but only three waiters could be seen, however the food still came out quick and the service was sufficient as well. A nice place if you want some quick and good brunch, but quite noisy at midday.",,,

Expectations were not met in this round. Next course, appetizers, tried the lamb meatballs which were missing seasoning and the raw seafood for two, again not very fresh and had better, so again loss of one star. The dinner was average nothing to rave about had the chicken dish with Parmesan fries. Wouldn't try again",,,

70,Ann F.,"New York, NY",224,276,538,5.0,10/29/2016,"Every person I introduce to Hendrik's has a first impression of something along the lines of ""Wow!  How darling is this place!  Its perfect for date night!"" ... and I can't disagree!  Walls of windows & brick alongside burlap signs and hanging lanterns pretty much sums up Hendrik's charming decor.  You just get the sense of cleanliness at this place. The bar is neatly organized and offers additional seating.  And we've only ever had phenomenal service during our visits. What else is there?I've enjoyed Hendrik's for take-out, dinner and brunch.  Shamefully, I've had their Gnocchi for both dinner and brunch.  Lol.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but there's something intriguing about one dish to include Gnocchi, Pear, Hazelnut, Parmesan, AND Bacon!  I also thoroughly enjoy their Cornmeal Pancakes!  Imagine Cornbread and Pancakes having a baby. That's right!  Yeeeesss!! We can't wait for our next visit!  And happy to have you as our neighbor!",2,,

Believe it or not, everyone was a fan of the food. Unfortunately, one of my coworkers had an issue with her food and did not complain about it until the end so she was not able to enjoy her entire meal. The truffle mashed potatoes are to die for! Most of us had the steak which were all cooked really well. The service was to par. A bit slow but friendly. The dining area can be a little tight but I was okay with it. Ugh dreaming of that truffle potatoes..**i heard about Hendricks via Yelp! 1st timer.Thanks Yelp :)",,,

It was perfectly cooked - light batter, not oily and not overcooked - it was very tender. Also, a plus, they include the tentacles, my favorite part. My daughter had a great salad (and added grilled chicken) which she loved. I had the special Chilean seabass - a generous portion which was also perfectly cooked. they served it with about 6-8 PEI mussels (yum, like a bonus!!) over a bed of risotto with peas. wow. each could have been a dish of its own. we were too full to try the desserts but we will definitely be back to try more of their great menu. Service was very good and pleasant as well. Well priced, not cheap, but restaurant has a nice ambience. kind of the sweet spot for a nice, but not over the top dinner experience that you can enjoy regularly.

76,Ellie L.,"Manhattan, NY",166,220,4,4.0,12/22/2017,"Pretty solid American fare but punch line is that I think I could have gotten more satisfying food for a lower price elsewhere.  For appetizers, we had the short rib fried rice balls which were well seasoned but super small and there weren't discernible short rib chunks in my opinion.

I thought the place was cute and casual and was interesting to also see a family with babies (sleeping). My friends ordered the lobster risotto and I got the pork shoulder risotto which was really good! The rice was flavorful and I loved the bits of mushroom in it! Not to mention that the pork itself was really good although slightly on the salty side. For my drink I got True Blood which was gin based mixed with a bit of malbec. The drink was also really great so overall I really liked my experience here as the servers/waiters and bartender was all really kind and friendly.

I arrived early for my reservation so my parents and I sat at the bar and enjoyed the last 30 minutes of happy hour. I had the white sangria, suggested by the bartender, which was very good (definitely sweet!). For appetizers we had the thick cut bacon & friend calamari, which were both delicious. I highly recommend the bacon but be warned, it doesn't serve that many people, especially since you'll want the whole thing to yourself! When it came to ordering, I knew exactly what I wanted - shellfish cioppino linguini. The dish was the perfect sized portion with a lot of clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops!!! What can be bad about that? Some other things people ordered were a burger, a steak, linguini with clams, & salmon. Everyone really enjoyed their meals - so much that we didn't have room for dessert.  I would definitely come back here and suggest it to my friends with the warning that it's a little pricey & very loud, but what NYC Italian restaurant isn't!",2,,1

My family and I live in New York during the summer and the one thing we are always most excited about is the food. Hendrik's was wildly disappointing. They basically ignored us the entire time, and only ended up coming over three times the entire meal. At one point my dad asked a waiter if we could have our waters refilled (the glasses had been sitting empty for 15 minutes) he said yes then walked to the back of the room and stared chatting with another waitress!! For another ten minutes!! Then when the food FINALLY came, the eggs where cold AND burned(we asked for over easy). And just to top it all off the charged us FOUR extra dollars from switching from regular eggs, to egg whites. Without even informing us!

The highlight was the lobster risotto, but even that wasn't worth the $25 price tag as there was barely any lobster. The seafood isn't the freshest and it's heavily overpriced.

The atmosphere is casual, but dress casual and sophisticated. This could be a great spot for a date, or a business lunch or dinner. I wonder if their brunch is any good. I'm inclined to believe that it is based on what I had that night: calamari and the lobster avocado salad. Calamari was crisp, not greasy and served with some fried peppers. The batter was like buttermilk, and cornbread, and herbaceous goodness all in one. I'm a big fan of this. And the lobster and avocado salad was equally delicious.

For the record, my husband was a restaurant owner for years until his retirement, and we are very hesitant about sending things back.    Since I was hungry, I kept it.  I think it was probably sitting waiting for my husband's dinner to be cooked.  I think that $18,00 is high for a burger.  My husband's salmon was just o.k. On a positive note, the cheese cake was the best I have eaten in a long time.",,,
98,M S.,"Stratford, CT",1,54,0,3.0,5/5/2017,"I would love to give this place four stars because I think the food is good but I have to say after tonight's meal and what they charged me, it was a total ripoff. I ordered a salad, $13, ok.. reasonable. I asked if I could add a protein and the waitress said sure but the cost was not listed on the menu. $14 for a small piece of salmon, ultimately $27 for a salmon salad is ridiculous especially when considering the rest of the menu. I truly think they just thought, let's take advantage of this person. Disappointing.Service was poor. I walked in alone and it took 5 minutes for someone to seat me then 5 minutes for someone to bring me a menu and 25 minutes for one dish to come out. The waitress was friendly when she interacted with me but ultimately forgot about me.",,,

100,Christae E.,"New York, NY",18,47,23,1.0,5/14/2017,"Edit: Came today on Mother's Day, expecting them to be busy. I made a reservation for 1:15pm and the rest of my party was a few minutes late (about 10 minutes- I ordered a drink in their absence). It wasn't packed at all and there were several servers on, several large tops leaving. Upon my friend being seated, we proceeded to wait SEVENTEEN minutes before our waiter finally came over and greeted us. He looked our way and several times wasn't even serving other tables, but didn't greet us at all. When he decided to come over, we promptly put in our food and drink orders, he delivered my friends drink and he never came to our table again. He never checked on our meal and did not return with the ticket. I had to ask a busser for it and ask that busser for it to be picked up and run. We were 100% kind and polite the whole time. Our waters were empty, our drinks were empty and we were completely forgotten. According to our ticket his name was Alex and I won't be returning because of his lack of service or at the very least, inability to transfer our table when he left mid meal. So disappointed that I had such a poor time at what was once my favorite brunch joint.Original review:One of my favorite weekend brunch places in Manhattan- lovely decor, delicious food, and really good $5/mimosas and $5/Bloody Mary's during weekend brunch!  They also take reservations, which is nice.",,,

102,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,79,4,2.0,3/16/2017,"Perhaps the Happy Hour. There is something to that, generally.  Very decent venue, understood as 'place', as bar & restaurant.But the dining is on autopilot, at the very best, and can be something of a chore. Some waiters are better, more attentive (and less chatty), than others. At a last encounter, our table waited ten minutes for menus, fifteen minutes for a waiter to take our order. Bread only arrived after we asked for it twicely. Dinner for four, off the regular menu, took 35 minutes to arrive after ordering. It wasn't busy. (Were they angling for us to order another round of drinks?)I've had brunch, dinner and all the rest here. Much of the food is very decent. The risotto is excellent and the ribs are good. My last pork chop was big, but even so too dried out and overpriced at $28 for a single pork chop (please note, the menu reads plural, 'chops'). The hamburger, which I've tried twice, thinking the first probably a fluke, looks good, but the meat has no taste other than to be somewhat oily. In short, I think they are trying to get away on their good looks: a restaurant looks a certain way, and you assume quite a lot, and perhaps upgrade your experience in your own mind, even if the actual fare and service are not quite up to the caliber of the décor.As for the bar, taps are perfectly unremarkable (if that's your thing, try nearby Ted's). There are no buybacks, a venerable NY tradition honoring the faithful customer, or other discounts outside the happy hour. Cocktails work, but no one should confuse this with a craft cocktail bar. As for the autopilot, it seems Hendriks is the Tesla of midtown. I'm stuck, sometimes, because I live and work in the area.... and with friends who insist on nearby, I am not often in the driver's seat. So I 'passenger up' to the bar or table here, with apathy if not misgivings.UPDATE: I appreciate the civil responses of Jack P., who is apparently the owner. But if you read them for yourself, he really dismisses me (nicely: 'probably don't come back!'):  not a thing I wrote seemed to resonate enough with him to suggest he'd look into or improve it. To this, all I can say is check the place out for yourself and see whether you have a similar experience as me and if so, talk to Jack P. or write it up here.",,1,

My second visit I tried the Lobster Risotto. Fantastic rich cheesy goodness, and the tempura battered claws were a nice touch. Generous portion as well.

Once we sat down, it was a bit cramped but it didn't bother me too much. Our waitress attended us right away and was very nice. The atmosphere was great - a talkative crowd, nice music, a bit fast paced, and everyone who was working the floor looked very attentive to their customers. Drinks- we got two Moscow Mules which were delish. Appetizers- Deviled Eggs were just the right temperature, tasted great and presented well. The Crab Cake was amazing; soft, warm and made just right. It also came with a mixed salad with bits of apple slices which was perfect for the season. Entrees- I ordered the Lobster and Avocado salad. I barely order salads as an entree, but I gave this one a shot and I'm glad I did! The lobster was such great quality and freshness I wanted more. The salad also had avocado which is my fave and added great texture to the salad. My boyfriend ordered steak, potatoes, kale with hints of thick bacon - he loves it.

After seeing a good rating on several websites including Open Table and Yelp, I decided to make a reservation here for my mom's birthday. While the restaurant had a nice vibe overall, we were seated at the table right by the door & front window which made it feel as though we were being watched more than anything. We ordered a salad to share, which we specifically requested to be an appetizer, and it came about 5 minutes after we received our drinks. Not 2 minutes after the salad was put down were our plate being thrown down in front of us. It all felt extremely rushed - not the nice relaxed evening we were expecting. By the time we finished the salad, our food had cooled down considerably. I ordered butternut squash ravioli, which was pretty good but needed more cheese, apples, and cranberries (the topping). My sister ordered the rosemary gnocchi which was had maybe a tablespoon of sauce in the bottom of the bowl. Even with extra sauce, the dish was very one-dimensional. My dad ordered the smoked salmon pasta, which was probably the best of the 4, and my mom ordered the lobster risotto. I don't know about you, but when I read lobster risotto, I have pretty high expectations. To be honest, it was one of the reasons I chose the restaurant in the first place. Unfortunately, this was by far the worst part of the meal. I have had many risotto dishes before, and this was simply white sticky rice with some sort of sauce on top. It was EXTREMELY bland and so disappointing that my mom even asked them to take it off of the bill.  Our waitress was very pleasant and tried to reconcile the meal by bringing a birthday desert for my mom, but overall I was super disappointed.

No amount of candles, kale, or exposed brick can hide the shocking truth that this is just another straight up bog standard diner with a capital D. We had brunch, and were treated to the exact same bland Sysco eggs, flavor-free coffee, and rock hard foil butter pats that you will find in literally every diner in NYC. Even the potatoes were the identical recipe shared by every greasy spoon clone from Inwood to Battery Park...a mushy pile of the 3 Ps; potatoes, peppers and paprika. The chic staff of this nouveau eatery is a diner staff hiding in dark ironed shirts. Despite the outward appearance of Hendrik's as a hipster joint, you'll find no tattooed chef. No man-bunned barkeep. I think I even recognized one or two of the staff from my local diner.  Given that the place was mobbed with 3 Red Wedding sized banquet tables filled with yammering millennials, (thanks for clogging up every kitchen in the city you roving packs of afraid-to-be-alone-for-5-seconds idiots!) it's pretty obvious that the draw of this place is the cheap drinks, and definitely not the food.  On the other hand, people have posted an utterly inexplicable 500 photos of the mediocre food. The biggest differences between this place and my local diner?  At my local diner, I don't have to ask for a knife, water, salt and pepper, or butter and jam, and the food is served quickly and hot. I wouldn't have minded any of this if the place was called Hendrik's Diner, or had the universal diner warning sign of a revolving dessert menagerie in the window.  But we peeked through the glass and glanced at the menu and were duped by appearances.  This is a knock off of a decent restaurant.  It's just another diner, and a lame one at that.",1,1,

Updated review","I came in for a 5p dinner with a guest today (11/16/16 Wed). This is my second time dining in here with guest(s). And the food has been consistently terrific when dining in. In fact, today's experience was better than my first time dining in. I ordered the following:1) Kale salad: This is an excellent, flavorful salad w/ interesting toppings. I order this one consistently everytime when dining in (as well as taking a delivery).2) Today's special sea bass w/ clams & potatoes: sea bass was perfectly cooked w/ outer crispness and juicy flakiness -- placed on top of potatoes. The clams w/ jus in the same dish was excellent. If it was offered again as a special, I'd definitely order it again. Also, enjoyed the small flavorful veggies that soaked up the jus. Excellent dish.3) Short ribs entrée w/ mashed potatoes: my guest ordered this, and I had a small sample of it. Very good & comes w/ a side of brussel sprouts and other veggies. 4) Tiramisu & black coffee: the coffee was served hot and went well w/ tiramisu, which was good quality and not too sweet. 5) Terrific service. Good food presentation. Great décor for a dinner w/ friends/date/family.  Of note, the first time when I dined in, I tried their burger & the accompanying crisp fries. As one of Yelp reviewers already mentioned, this place does a terrific burger + fries when dining in. Highly recommend.",,,

Also, they deliver (even though we live across the street...it's gotten to the point the delivery person knows us. Problem? Probably not.) Assorted favorites from our apartment:+ angus burger - just a solid amount of burger, melty cheese, toasted bun, and deliciousness. plus the sage parmesan fries that come with it are amazing. + salads - the roasted pear + fig + goat cheese salad is simple / healthy / great - if you like a mix of sweet and savory and vegetables it will make you happy+ shrimp diabolo with steamed broccoli pasta - only on the delivery menu, it's the right mix of spicy and tomato-y for the sauce, with a pretty good amount of shrimp+ brunch! they pretty much cover most of what you could think of (salads, pancakes, pasta, delicious eggs benedict) and has something for everyoneFriendly service, not too loud, and just a pretty relaxed, comfortable atmosphere - it's always a good fallback place when we can't think of anything else nearby to try.",,,

Anyways, we didn't know where we were gunna go now that our plans had changed. So we saw this place and walked in. Love the decor, very modern but classic. We were seated right away. Our waiter RJ was great. Very personable, checked on us often enough but not too much. We started with the lamb meatballs which were great. I ordered a hangar steak special which was delicious and my boyfriend ordered a pasta dish which he ranted and raved about. He got dessert, don't remember what it was. The service was just super good, food delicious and the atmosphere was perfect. We plan to come back on like a Friday or Saturday night sometime when it gets nicer out. Can't wait to go back.",,,

By 7:00pm not only was the bar occupied but the entire establishment was filled with talkative eaters enjoying their company and food alike. Hendriks is a quaint restaurant on the South East Corner of 37th & 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, NY. The assortment of food varies from land to sea. Although the appetizers and main courses were blandly flavored, the desserts are flavored to the NINES!!!!! In particular the Apple Brown Betty was my favorite emphasizing the meaning, ""saving the best for last"". The beverage menu too was vast and accommodating from water, beer, wines and cocktails.",,,

She had bookmarked it and I took it upon myself to make a ressy here and surprise her with dinner plans after she had a hard day of work. I knew she could use a nice few drinks too. Got here way earlier than expected and they sat us no problem. Rigjt near a little window. Place is not too big but sufficient. Very nice, upscale type looking place.  Nice bar area though it is on top of the dining area which can create some loud noise when the place gets busy. I got the burger and my lady got the chicken dish. Of course I got to try some of that chicken too. Must say, the food was delicious.  I thought the chicken had good flavor and was very well cooked. Nice and tender.  The burger was also very tasty, juicy and well cooked. Since it was a lot of food we took home half of each our meals. Just as good the next day The service was good but when it got busy we had to flag down the servers, which can happen. The bar got loud and as I said, since the bar is right on top of the dining area it got loud too. I guess that will happen in a smaller place in NYC. I would like to come back and try more food. The specials they mentioned all sounded good. But my eye was on the burger going in. I am certain we will return again.",1,1,1

Ordered the French Onion soup with baguette, which was superb. But the highlight was the lobster and avocado salad. From presentation, to large chunks of lobster, to perfectly aligned avocado slices, to superb mixture of greens to a just right olive oil dressing this was an outstanding meal in and of itself. Pace of the meal and waitstaff attention were just right. If I had nothing important to do tomorrow would have enjoyed more wine, very casual but attentive atmosphere, and stayed another hour or two. Find you way here and enjoy.",,,

I was able to make a reservation for 8 people earlier that day. Once our group arrived, we were seated quickly. We got the calamari appetizer to share - not the best I've had, but it was a solid choice. For my entree, I had the butternut squash ravioli, which was very tasty. The portion size of the ravioli (between 7-9 small raviolis) is small, however, for the price I paid. The ambiance of the restaurant is really cute - it was decorated for the holidays and there is a section with the bar lining the side of the sit-down area of the restaurant. It would be a great place for a date night or dinner out with friends. The food didn't blow me away, so I'm giving Hendriks a 4 star! Solid food that is above average, but not exceptional.",1,,1

Polished, clean, old school American. I liked the decor.Service - servers were nice enough and our food came out fast.Food - My daughter had the steak and eggs and loved it. My husband had the crabcake benedict and ate the entire thing. The accompanying fries were burned and greasy so he didn't eat those though. (Curious why the restaurant doesn't improve their fries as I've noticed many other reviewers with the same comment about them?) I had the organic salmon which I requested ""well done."" I requested this twice upon ordering, but the salmon came back raw in the middle. The kitchen took it back to cook it more, and it was delicious, but it wasn't fun eating it after my husband and daughter were already finished.We shared an apple betty (I think that's what it was called) for dessert. Nothing to write home about.Overall - I would return to this place. It's nearby, the food was good, the prices reasonable, and I LOVE that they serve organic salmon.",6,,

For drinks we did cocktails, but I am thinking I will go for wine next time. Unless your into dark liquors the cocktail list was a bit limited... For an appetizer we did the short rib arancini which was absolutely to die for. It comes fried in ball form and it was so tasty. For the main course I also did the short rib, which I didn't realize I doubled up on until now. It fell apart and was melt in your mouth good. The Brussel sprouts on the sized weren't prepared the way I usually like them (charred,) but they were still good, and the mashed potatoes were delicious. My boyfriend got the steak and although he ordered it medium rare, it came out rare. For his side dish there was potatoes and kale, the kale was very good.",,,

The interior is modem with a nice bar, exposed whitewashed bricks and some retro light bulbs. It creates a nice intimate and enjoyable environment.The food was pretty good. I ordered linguine and clams and it was delightful. The clams were clean and the pasta was fresh. I wish they had a slightly bigger portion, but it was reasonable. The people I was with ordered a burger and the squash pasta, both seemed pretty well made. Nothing I'd rave about, but the chef did his job.If I were to suggest one improvement to the establishment it would concern the beer selection. In a time where craft beers are popular, there wasn't a single one on tap and they had a slightly better but still limited bottle selection. Overall I'd say I was pretty satisfied with my experience, I'd go there again.",,1,1

Didn't quite find that here, but the restaurant/bar was cool and refreshing, which was a nice break from all the loud and sticky outdoor places.I was just going to get a drink, but I couldn't help but glance at the menu. When I saw the words lobster and avocado, I knew there was no turning back. So instead of getting my weekly Chipotle, I opted for this delicious salad, and I have no regrets! It was light and refreshing, and the lobster was very fresh. There was also a very generous portion of lobster, which pleased me to no end.I will definitely be back for this salad, and am also looking forward to trying the grilled peach salad and other menu delights.Thanks for opening up here!",3,1,

Always playing is safe you can say.I got the butternut squash ravioli with a creamy sauce apples,pickled cranberries, and goat cheese. Which none of this together sounded good but individual each item I liked expect the goat cheese. Normally didn't like goat cheese. It was absolutely amazing. Honestly I loved it. Confused on how my taste bugs changed. The only downsize was like I got  6 ravioli for 15 dollars but hey I was in Manhattan so I understood. It tasted really good but definitely didn't fill me up. The Bartender was nice. It was great experience. I would come up but maybe with some people so I can split an appetizer with someone and get full. Try this place out.",,2,

We had no major complaints - it was a fantastic experience. Our server was patient, polite, accommodating to dietary restrictions and very  attentive to detail. The atmosphere was pretty quiet when we arrived as it was on the earlier side for dinner but that was fine as it allowed us to chat without strain. We were there for about 2 hours and by the time we left, more diners had arrived and it was a little noisier but nothing unbearable. The music selection was great and the overall ambience and decoration are tasteful.The food was delicious! We ordered the raw bar, the fried calamari and the lamb meatballs as apps. Best fried calamari I have ever eaten - crispy, light, and not chewy. For mains, we got the salmon, the pork chop special, the chilean sea bass and the grilled peach salad. Everyone in our party was very satisfied with their meals! They even put a little candle in our dessert and sang for my grandmother's birthday. It's not often I take the time to leave reviews but Hendriks and our waiter especially deserve recognition for what was a stellar dining experience all around!",1,,

They have Bicardi Limon which made me happy from the start because not every place has it. We shared the lamb meatballs which were succulent and cooked to perfection. The sauce was so good I practically ate the rest of it, which had little bits of meat crumbled in it, with a fork. The real showstopper here, though, were the seared sea scallops. OH EM GEE. The entrée comes with massive sea scallops (I believe there were around 8 of them) which fell apart with a fork, chorizo, fingerling potatoes, kale and roasted tomatoes. The entire thing was cooked in some kind of light broth that was bursting with flavor. On top of the wonderful food and drinks, the place is charming inside and the bartender gave great service.

Hendrik's occupies a place that was empty for the all of the three years (maybe even longer!) that I've lived in the neighborhood, so welcome! The place has a gorgeous interior - homey and sleek at the same time - first star!To start off, we did not have reservations, which I did not think were necessary given the day of the week and how new the place was. Unfortunately, all the tables were fully booked so my girls and I grabbed a few stools by the marble counter next to the bar - read: no waiter service. Because of this seating arrangement, we had to flag our bartender down MANY MANY MANY times. To get a drink menu, to order our drinks, to get a food menu, to order our food, to get place settings, to check on our food 4x within the span of nearly an hour wait. This is just rediculous. I appreciate the fact that Hendrik's is new and has to work out its' kinks, but to have us wait over an hour for 3 dishes while not coming over at any point to apologize for the wait? Nonsense. While we were waiting, the 2 girls to my right were experiencing the same agony -- they actually had to cancel one of their dishes because they waited so long!When the food FINALLY arrived, it was mediocre. I had the raved about grilled peaches salad, which was just fine, nothing spectacular. My other friend had the risotto which was a large portion but very bland, and the last girl went with the burger which she stated was nothing to rave about. Finally, the manager (I presume) comes over to our table to apologize about the wait and to let us know he would ""take care of us."" At the end of the meal, he comped us one meal - which was a nice gesture that he did not have to do, so for that Hendrik's receives the 2nd star. Unlikely to return!",1,,

Hubby wanted to try something different and went with the lamb meatloaf. He said it was great. So glad we tried this place, another new restaurant to add to our list.",,,
193,Namrata A.,"New York, NY",279,710,24,2.0,6/27/2013,"Hendricks just opened up this week in Murray Hill.  It's nice to have a new place in our community that seems welcoming and nice.  That being said, it fell short to expectations if it had been any place outside of my 5 block radius.  The service from the beginning was great- hostess was friendly and accommodating.  However, the waiter was absent minded in the beginning getting my friend's glass of wine, but remembered the other 2 glasses for our group.  At the end of the meal, he only charged two cards instead of the 3.  He seemed a bit frazzled at the whole situation of a packed place- hey it's new, of course Murray Hill will come out and see what it's all about as soon as it opens!The food I ordered was bland and limited in choices for a vegetarian.  I had the vegetable gnocchi and we shared hand cut fries (fine) and chickpea fritters (nothing to write home about).  My friends ordered the mussels and lamb meatballs.  They seemed to enjoy the lamb meatballs more. The wines by the glass and bottle prices were reasonable.  No cocktail menu though.It could be opening issues, but I'd welcome trying this in a few months again to see if it's gotten any better.",1,,
194,Kat S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/9/2017,"Hendricks is the ""go to"" place in Murray Hill for us. It's a fun space perfect for people watching, with a beautiful marble bar. The menu is innovative, great food and pricing to match. Not only is it apparent the chef knows his business, but the bartender, Antigona, never misses a beat. Whether it's just a  few folks, or a full house, the speed at which she serves the establishment is always impressive. We're very happy to have Hendricks to frequent and recommend checking it out. Don't miss this one!",1,,
195,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,441,116,3.0,1/1/2014,"Food = 4 Stars; Service = 2.5 to 3 stars.We came for dinner on a very cold day after work.  Made a reservation because I'd read that it can get packed.  It wasn't too crowded when I arrived, and didn't get too crowded while we were there.  The food was good.The service was attentive, but a bit too intrusive.  They constantly came by to ask how we were doing.  When my gf finished her meal before me, they rushed over to grab her plate off the table, even though I was still eating.  I think the usual custom is to wait until everyone has finished their food before clearing the table of the plates.  Then we got the check and within one minute, our server rushed over and grabbed the folio without even checking whether we had already reviewed the bill and included payment.  We had to call her back as she rushed off to let her know we hadn't looked at it yet.Not sure what the rush was about since the place was not packed at all.  Can't imagine what it's like when they actually require a quick turnover of the tables.",,,
196,Blake R.,"Peekskill, NY",0,20,0,5.0,4/5/2016,"Mid afternoon meal.  So happy to have found Hendricks. I'd never heard of lamb meat loaf and it was excellent. Saved some to take home. The chief also mastered a juicy well-done hamburger. Nora is an excellent waitress. Highly recommend, all the way around.",1,,
197,Jenny F.,"Johnston, RI",4,30,1,5.0,2/19/2015,"Best delivery I've had in a while! They were fast! The food was excellent and still piping hot when we got it. If you are tired of the neighborhood B@reburger getting your order wrong, then Hendricks has the burger for you. It was fat, juicy, cooked perfectly medium rare and it comes with smoked onions (so smokey and delicious). Their hot wings were also awesome- good amount of heat to make your gums tingle and sinuses clear, but not enough to make you cry. Will definitely be ordering delivery again! (Might go check out the place too, but not till its above freezing).",1,,1
198,Dan O.,"New York, NY",2,22,0,3.0,7/21/2016,"We really liked everything about this place (food, service, price, and decor) but it was VERY LOUD which really took away from our evening.   On top of that, they were playing music which added to the situation.  I did ask a member of staff if they could turn it down, he said they would, but they didn't.  Bottom line is that, if you don't mind the noise, def check this place out.",,,
199,Tom J.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,28,4,2.0,7/17/2016,"This place is cute. The menu is hit or miss. Avoid the French fries which are over cooked and hard. Gnocchi lacks seasoning. The pork belly risotto however is amazing, as is the smoked salmon angel hair pasta. The grilled peach salad was wonderful as well. Of the 6 entrees we ordered 3 were passable to delicious,  and 3 were lacking in one way or another. Given that NYC has so many amazing places to eat, I wouldn't return to this one except maybe for drinks at the bar.",,,
