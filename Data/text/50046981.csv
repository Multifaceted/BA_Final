0,Ackrawin R.,"New York, NY",25,10,7,5.0,10/27/2018,"I pick up my girlfriend from FIT about 2 or 3 times a week. During my commute to the college one afternoon, I noticed that The Wilson just recently opened and we decided to give it a try.  My girlfriend and I came in this previous Wednesday, and the restaurant's decor, ambiance, friendly staff, and amazing food/ drinks all helped create the perfect date. Our waiter Sal was very welcoming and attentive and gave us great recommendations. We had the Brussels sprouts tacos, which were outstanding! I had the ribeye steak and my girlfriend had the blue crab carbonara. Both of our entrees were soooo delicious. We finished with a warm and sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet for dessert. We loved the Bottle Rocket Old Fashion and the Midnight Hour cocktail. We had an amazing date and will definitely be returning very soon!",1,,
1,Nancy H.,"New York, NY",231,814,2139,3.0,11/12/2018,"I was thoroughly impressed by the food. The drinks are overly complicated and take forever to come out. Received our food before the drinks came out! Creative but overly complicated if you have a big group ordering. Great for drinks as there is plenty of seating and you can carry a conversation without yelling.Tucked inside the Nomad Hotel, The Wilson was recently opened by the IGC Hospitality group. There's the cocktail bar where everyone sits and also a lower level restaurant that I find to be is more for overflow, though it's very beautiful and tastefully decorated is unfortunately underutilized. The NYC Burrata ($18 ) is overpriced but delicious, smoked carrot hummus ($13) is unique and a must order, avocado fries ($14) over priced yet perfect, fried green tomatoes and cheese ($10) awful, fries ($7) delicious yet the size of a McDonald's small. Basically, everything is overpriced but executed well.If you're only getting one drink for the night the 50/50 ($18) is all you need, unless you're trying to get turnt then keep ordering the straight up gin and vermouth drink. The G&T drink embodies what drinking potpourri would be, if you could that is, due to the pink peppercorn. Star drinks of the night include: Midnight hour, bottle rocket old fashioned, and midnight in paris.",3,,2
2,Robert G.,"Brooklyn, NY",287,34,21,5.0,10/12/2018,"This place was phenomenal Buzzing with energy The food and service was greatWe got the sliders to start, the sauce was so good. If this was an entree I would get it, or just double this order Also had the grilled octopus and Brussels sprouts Both delicious and very flavorful Had the bottle rocket old fashioned and it was a really nice presentationChris, one of the owners, came up to us too and talked with us, definitely appreciate the feedback (all positive) we gave him Coming back soon for sure!!!",2,,1

4,Gabby S.,"New York, NY",475,254,121,5.0,10/10/2018,I love me some great carbonara.So when I heard The Wilson was opening up on West 27th street and it was super close to me and the menu had blue crab carbonara I knew I had to be in there like swimwear and try it. oh my was it delicious from how amazing the sauce was to the portioning of the crab it was great.I also love their brussel sprouts they are cooked perfectly and aren't some cliche brussels and pancetta. but it instead has a delicious saucy kick and is topped with scallionsservers are super friendly and really do try to make sure you have a great experience. The restaurant is also seriously beautiful like I want to go eat here and also take photos to post on my Instagram beautiful.Also let me say this I normally hate hate carrot cake. but something about this carrot cake changed my mind. The presentation is not only chic but it has nuts in there and its perfect balance of ingredients.I can't wait to be back and really try the rest of the menu.,3,1,
5,Rhonda L.,"Long Beach, CA",118,320,407,4.0,10/29/2018,"We arrived on a Saturday morning red eye and were waiting to check into our hotel and yelped what was nearby for breakfast and found this new place.  Breakfast was buffet only for $35 including tax and gratuity.  Food quality was excellent.  Scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, sausage (possibly chicken, I didn't have any), rosemary potatoes, french toast, pastries, Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, homemade granola, variety of juices, coffee, tea, and milk.  Art work of famous people with the Wilson name- Luke, Owen, Rita, President, etc.  The whole building if very cool with usual art and furnishings.  Cool place for a drink and to hang out.",1,1,1
6,Ken M.,"San Francisco, CA",75,113,4,5.0,11/11/2018,Wow we stayed 3 nights at the hotel and never went to the bar resturant until today.  Jay the bartender is down to earth and knows how to pour the fancy drinks and the standby old fashion drinks like we had (greyhound and seabreeze). The food looks and smells delicious but we didn't try it.  Next time we are in the Big apple this will be a must.,,,
7,Sean T.,"Manhattan, NY",14,18,0,5.0,10/10/2018,"Hi Stephen (Business Owner),I noticed you normally respond to your reviewers,but before you thank me for my review and feedback, I want to go that extra mile to just thank you.  Inside the Mellia was the kind of place you walked in and forgot about.  The CPR you administered to that place has not only revived the space, it's given new life to this block, so take a bow Mr. Stephen. Angela, one of your waitresses, I'd give 10 stars to.  She's an absolute gem.  Her attentive service and happy demeanor were right on point with how guests should be treated. It's a first for me, I never really had an appreciation for the arts. That is until I saw the two story living mural.  Let me just say I have no doubt Michelangelo himself would pull up a Barstool, order a cosmo, and stare in jaw dropping silence out of shear admiration just like I did.  Thank you for changing my way of thinking Mr. Stephen. Best, Seangt",1,,
8,Susana N.,"New York, NY",37,21,36,5.0,10/5/2018,"Amazing ambience, food so good, small menu which I feel is perfect, great drinks, great service. This place is a hit.",,,
9,Jessica B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",266,6,1,5.0,11/3/2018,This establishment gives you fine dining! Perfect for a date or business meeting. I stopped in by the bar and was recommended the Brussels sprout tacos. They were to die for! The staff members were friendly and competent. Great wine selection.,,,
10,Gage A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,8,0,5.0,11/8/2018,Excellent quality food and nice ambience.  Great for date night or going out with friends.  Service was extremely friendly and the drinks were also great.  Thinking this will be around for a long while.  Love the unique items on the menu makes it all more different.,,,
11,Susan D.,"Bonita Springs, FL",0,18,2,5.0,10/25/2018,Fantastic!  Roasted carrot hummus was amazing and the salmon with brown butter and pancetta was melt in your mouth!,,,1
12,Esther R.,"Storrs, CT",0,3,0,5.0,10/9/2018,"What a great new spot! We came here for a romantic evening out, and had the best time!Our waiter Shane was perfectly attentive and very funny.  He helped us decide on the menu must-haves.  We tried the NYC Burrata with chorizo, the Grilled Octopus and the Smoked Carrot Hummus for our appetizers.  OMG.  SO good.  The Carrot hummus especially was one of the most creative and delicious things I've eaten in a while.We shared the blue crab carbonara-actually, we basically fought over it, it was so good.I had the Castaway Mule Cocktail. And then I had it again. And again. I am not exaggerating when I say it is probably the best cocktail I have ever had.  Layers of flavors and a gorgeous presentation to boot. The restaurant space itself is unique and has something for everyone.  We sat outside in their all-season patio.  There are heat lamps above to keep you cozy, couches if you want to chill out with friends, and plenty of foliage to make the venue feel exotic even though it is right in the middle of Manhattan.The next time we go, we will check out their downstairs with its' cool hanging lights, 2 story ""painting"" made entirely out of living foliage and odes to Wilsons from movies, tv, sports and music.Definitely check out The Wilson, I guarantee you'll fall in love with it, too!",2,,1
13,Deirdre O.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",30,12,0,5.0,10/20/2018,"The service is great and the dishes are cooked superbly, with nuance and great thought to how individual flavors build on each other.",,,
14,Sean D.,"New York, NY",190,3,0,5.0,10/29/2018,"Yaaaaaaaaaaaas!!! If you are looking for your new spot, this is the place. Octopus, Oysters, Pad Thai and the Ribeye were amazing. I have no idea how you make Octopus that delicious, but they crushed it. The 50/50 martini is delicious. Insider tip, go with Vodka versus Gin on the 50/50. The physical design is killer and the hospitality is unreal. I can't wait to go back and try brunch. The Wilson is a home run!!",,,
15,Brianna T.,"Manhattan, NY",110,2,0,5.0,10/17/2018,"I heard about the Wilson through a friend and let me tell you, I was not disappointed! Their unique menu has amazing options and the staff is well versed on the details of each dish. Our server gave us great recommendations on everything from drinks to dessert! Be sure to check out this newfound gem!",,,
16,Jeff H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/9/2018,"The Wilson hits all the notes of a a great neighborhood restaurant. Delicious food, great service and really tasty cocktails. I've been back twice since The Wilson opened and feel like I'm part of a family. The staff really care about guests having a great time. Hit this spot before it gets too crowded!!!",,,
17,Anika P.,"Manhattan, NY",69,19,0,5.0,10/17/2018,"This new restaurant does not disappoint. Great spot for comfort food (if you don't order the Brussels sprout tacos, you're doing it wrong). The outdoor area has heat lamps and a spacious patio with lots of plants, awesome for groups. Service was on point as well, our server Dylan was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. There is an awesome space downstairs that is not open yet, but would be perfect for events!",,,
18,Vinnie L.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/9/2018,"The venu itself is gorgeous, amazing music and vibes and the service is outstanding. Sal, our server, went above and beyond. Truly amazing experience, and the food.....the best!",,,
19,Hiawatha Q.,"Weehawken, NJ",149,1,0,5.0,10/7/2018,"Came here with friends that were visiting from out of town. Both food and service were really good. But i must say, one of the coolest things for us was that they have this huge outdoor seating area partially enclosed that's actually open year round. We could eat and watch the city go by. It's also pretty trendy and the music was cool. My friends were very impressed and we ended up having a great time. I will be coming back.",,,
20,Whitney S.,"Flemington, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,10/21/2018,"My girlfriend and I celebrated our birthday's here, and had a fantastic experience! The drinks were delicious, the food was fantastic, the ambiance was gorgeous, and they really went above and beyond to make our celebration special. We shared a few items and weren't disappointed. The brussel sprout tacos were delicious, and the falafel waffle is not to be missed! Unfortunately I don't remember our servers name, nor did I catch the managers name, but they were very hospitable and kind. I highly recommend this place.",,,
21,Chris B.,"New York, NY",1,6,0,5.0,10/9/2018,Finally! This neighborhood has been needing a real restaurant for so long. I never order vegetarian but my fiancée ordered the falafel waffles and made me try it. This will be my new go to. Unreal how much flavor it had. I am not used to that from veggie dishes. Will be back when in the hood.,1,,
22,Frank J.,"Vail, CO",0,2,0,5.0,10/17/2018,"Excellent experience. . .a great new casual restaurant with friendly staff and creative well done menu.  Absolutely a ""go back to"" kinda place!  Welcome to the neighborhood!!",,,
23,Michael T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",170,3,0,5.0,10/23/2018,"My girlfriend and I found this place last minute on Yelp and we are extremely happy that we did!  The entrance has The Wilison illuminated in bright white letters while maintaining a classy look.  I arrived at 6 pm and upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted and given a table in less than a minute.  The waiter was really attentive and nice to us and our food arrived in little to no time. We had the avocado fries (try them you wont regret!!) and they were extremely good!  Next, we ordered the raw oysters and they were delicious!!!  In the ice tray, where the oysters laid, was this cute little bottle of Tabasco sauce and it became a little souvenir that we took home.  For the main course, we had a pad thai and it was big enough to fill both of our stomachs.  The noodle was cooked extremely well with just the right about of sweet to sour ratio.  On another note, while going to the bathroom which is located in the lower floor, I was presented with a gorgeous bar, wall art, tables and hanging lights which had me wondering if I was in a dream.  Overall, The Wilson has left me and my girlfriend with an extremely positive experience.  I will definitely be coming back here soon.  Thank you to The Wilson for such an epic experience.",,,
24,Amissa R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,10/20/2018,"I'm so glad we tried this place. We had a wonderful birthday dinner- great service, fabulous food and cocktails and beautiful outdoor setting. Will definitely be back! especially liked the Falafel Waffle and Brussel Sprout tacos!",,,
25,alyssa l.,"East Northport, NY",0,5,0,5.0,10/9/2018,"So so good! Everything was perfect from the food, drinks atmosphere and service. Our favorites were the brussel sprout tacos and avocado fries. The carrot cake dessert was AMAZING. Would highly recommend this restaurant.",,,
26,Samantha M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,3,5.0,10/9/2018,"Love this new spot! The ambiance is amazing and the food and drinks are even better. The garden margarita on their cocktail list is the best margarita I've ever had. Can't wait to go back, highly recommend checking it out.",,,
