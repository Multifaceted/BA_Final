I went in last week as I was starving and wow there is pretty much nothing for vegan minded people! It's 2018 how hard could it be to stock up on a few options? At least some tofu spread for the bagels? That's been around in all NYC delis for decades, some lactose intolerant customers might enjoy it as well.... besides expensive fruit there is nothing here.It's hard to believe as the space is enormous and the location fantastic.

I walked around then found what I was hoping they have soupsThank you Carleen for going over the soups with me. Once I explained I have food allergies she let me sample the chicken lemon soup and it was good. You get to choose bread with it. I chose the baguette and they give you more than enough.

7,10,7/19/2018,299,6,"Queens, NY",Andrew S.,1198,4.0,618,"This Dean & Deluca should be considered one of those landmarks. It has been here from what I can recall and have visited for over 12 years. Not much has changed. It is the Soho Supermarket. I come here usually at the beginning of or after a Soho shopping experience. It is where I get something to drink or a quick bite. For one seating is none, you stand at the tables up front, in the middle of the market or in the back where the current sushi offerings are. It is a gourmet style super-market.I stopped by yesterday just to grab a drink. They have craft drinks along with the very commercialized name brand drinks. I grab a, I forget the name of, soda made with herbal additives, pretty good for a soda with herbal ingredients, something I have never had. I also grab a pastry from a booth on the opposite side of the market. The pastry wasn't that great. The crust needed more butter but the jam inside was good.Other than that they carry curated meats, pre-made foods including ribs/flank steaks, sandwiches and such to be found at most markets. It isn't really a supermarket but a market with gourmet style foods and accessories.The highlight this week is William's Family No No Sauce featured with the bottles flipped upside down as dispensers. And the bottles on pink painted BBQ Grills.",8

I was reluctant to try it, given many of the popular places are just popular because they are on some show, but I was wrong. As it turns out, Dean and DeLuca has some of the best prepared meals I have found in the city...I live all the way on the UWS but will go here at least 1x per week for their sushi (incredible), deli prepared items, and sometimes their baked goods if I am going to a party. Everything is always fresh and seems to be the highest quality. I always buy their spices and little odds and ends for my kitchen there. A few things I do not like is their coffee (lattes or mochas are too bitter and/or sweet) and the insane cost of the produce. It's fine, I just buy that at Whole Foods, but it's pretty pricy. Tip for locals: tourist madness ensues everyday around 11:30am until about 2pm. There's a lull between 2-4. Then a break after the dinner rush before they close. NEVER go on the weekends because oh my gosh...it is truly a madhouse and you can't even fight for space.",

And I think that's why they keep messing up lately. I didn't have this problem until a few months ago.

20,1,6/21/2017,113,,"New York, NY",Matt L.,548,5.0,544,"Mirror Review for the yelp event that happened here over Tuesday.I came to Dean and Deluca for probably the second time, my first time being some time... several years ago? I think I only came in here at the time for a coffee or something like that.Turns out D&D actually does a lot of different things, but it primarily serves higher end prepared food items. As such, it's typically a popular choice for lunch for people who work in the neighborhood, or dinner if people are on their way back home. For the event, they gave us a tasting of several different items which probably represented some of the better/more popular items that they typically carry.The first thing they served us was wine, of which I wound up with white. It was less sour than I've typically come to expect white wines to be, which was great overall. Made me realize that perhaps I have to give white another look. Then, for our first food dish, we started off with a prosciutto slice which was pretty good. I generally don't eat a lot of highly salted, preserved meat, but I thought it was decent.Next up came the vegetables on sticks, which was kind of an interesting take on vegetables. I had several of them, such as the cauliflower, pea, radish (which wasn't for me), along with the shrimp and lobster. The accompanying sauce was pretty good, but I felt like the vegetables were better off alone since the freshness made them pop enough as it was.Then came the summer rolls and the hand rolls. I enjoyed the summer rolls more than the hand rolls, of which I had a salmon variety. I didn't feel like the regular salmon roll was much different from the other salmon rolls that I've had in other places, but the summer rolls were composed very well. The sweet sauce that was served along side it could have been less sweet, but overall very good.Final dinner item was the cheeseburger slider. Honestly, I didn't think this thing was anything special. I kind of felt like the patty itself was lacking flavor. There was a wagyu hot dog served, but I didn't get to try it since I was too full. I was told it was interesting, texture wise, but I'm not sure how it tasted.Then came the desserts. I had the brownie, the creme brulee, and some sort of peach based dessert. The peach dessert was pretty good and I'll probably try to find the name of this item later on. The brownie, on the other hand, was just average. My favorite thing however by far was the creme brulee, which was coffee flavored.Overall, the people working the event were incredibly helpful and friendly. They were pretty quick to offer to take our plates, they kept the desserts and water flowing, even though I felt like the elite crowd blew through the desserts WAY too fast for polite company- there was basically nothing left there by the time I had arrived.Thanks very much to d&d for this great introductory experience, the very high quality service, the people who prepared the food who took time to explain what every item we were eating was, and of course our community manager, R. J.",1

Yes, things are pretty overpriced, but if you're in a pinch, this is probably one of the better choices you have in the area. I love their sushi section and also their pastries. They outsource their pastries from a few bakeries around the City. I had a MAPLE WAFFLE DONUT the other day and it was magical...went perfect with my coffee. I've bought a few things from D&D over the years -- one of the best things I've EVER bought is WHITE TRUFFLE HONEY (zomg) -- they have a few different types. I spread this stuff over baguette and with some prosciutto or salami. My mom also bought a few bags of different coffee beans from D&D -- she really enjoyed the selection.

Now that we are Philly folk, the visits are less frequent, however the same.. lunch or breakfast, a box of cookies or treats to bring home for dessert. The chocolates are an area I will carefully review, and I've bought a cookbook or two there. It is such a hotspot you are likely to bump into a celebrity, a few years ago we saw Cindy Crawford!

34,8,6/22/2017,334,5,"New York, NY",Helen Y.,3671,5.0,838,"Attention all event planners! You can use the same old supplier for your next corporate conference or wedding party, and guests will still eat the food out of boredom, hunger or simply because it is free! Or you can ensure that the guests will talk about the event long after it's over by utilizing this powerhouse of gourmet fare.The Yelp Elite event at this store provided a revelation that this purveyor of fine foods can host an event with precision, professionalism, good cheer, and all the while serving up scrumptious fare. Forget your standard sandwiches and meats, brownies and chocolate chip cookies for dessert. This was party food taken many notches up, with touches you don't normally find. This was what we ate at the various stations-mini burgers(black bean, cheeseburger, turkey), sushi rolls(plain and spicy), proscuitto rolls, cherry tomatoes with proscuitto, fresh rice rolls, mini wagyu hot dogs, grilled cheese with ham toasts, asparagus spears, mini-shrimp tacos, and skewers of assorted baby vegetables, lobster and shrimp, and even truffled marcona almonds(that the store usually samples). We had a large crowd, I estimated at 50 people, and having the stations smartly steered the crowd to disperse, and mingle. The back of the store was set up as a wine bar, with beer, red and white wine, and water.  There were tables in the back and front of the store for people to eat. The focus of it all was the dessert station, an eye-catching table of desserts right by the side entrance, created by the superbly talent pastry chef, Nida. There were over a dozen different types, with more unusual desserts like the matcha cake, the chocolate peanut butter cups, the warm crème brulee served in spoons, and towers of macarons. (see my review for Elite Event: Dean and Deluca for the nitty gritty). All the food was fresh and artfully done. I don't know if the caterers were Dean and Deluca employees or a group they always hire. They were tops in professionalism and grace.  I winced when a Yelper dropped a piece of her dark chocolate raspberry cake on the flour, stared at it, turned on her heels and walked away(manners, Yelpers, manners!)! The caterer, a few feet away, picked it up without a frown or any hesitation. The caterers also provided the stunning white peonies that adorned the event as decorations, giving those of us who wanted them the flowers at the end of the event. I reposted some pictures here that I had posted for the Elite event in case event planners want to see the offerings. If your corporate space is ho hum, or you want to host an intimate cocktail event for a few hours and don't have room in your home, I suggest using the actual store as a venue. The food can be prepared here, and served promply. White marble tables and floursflend an elegance to the clean space. The store closes at 8 pm, and then it can be yours.The event was also a reminder that old friends should be revisited. Long before the fancy food market exploded, Dean and Deluca was a pioneer and my go to place for gourmet treats for myself and for items to put in my gift baskets.  Then Soho got swarmed with tourists, and the store got so annoying crowded. So I bought my gourmet fare at better grocers where I could also get my standard grocery staples. I had also come for the cakes and then Dean and Deluca started making their own. I thought, how can their cakes be as good as places that make only pastries and favored bakeries.  I know now they have the petite dynamo Nida, who makes pastries the way I prefer them, not overly sweet in most cases, using rich dark chocolate, and with interesting flavor palates and textures(like the apricot cake that was a shortcake type with almond cream).  I recommend the Ferrero Rocher cake and the peanut butter cups to start. There were so many outstanding desserts I can't wait to gift their cakes for the upcoming birthdays of friends and family.The day after the event I rushed back to buy the amazing sugar snap peas and the roasted baby beets.  Alas, they really do customize a fancy event so nothing we had was for sale. Deborah is the store manager, and if you are reading this review, I bet you could have a bestseller in a summer salad of roasted baby beets, those tiny pickled pearl onions we ate, and sugar snap peas, tossed with the barest hint of dressing! I snagged a leek quiche and some artisanal honey before rushing to work. The flavorful quiche had so much butter in the crust I thought of dessert as I chewed on its flaky layers. Dean and Deluca sells pretty much anything edible that is fancy, along with cut flowers.  Prices match the quality so please don't come here and gripe. Everything looked fresh, but for some of the mushrooms(I forgot whether it was the delicate maitake or oyster).  Hype isn't the reason this place gets crowded. The friendliess and helpfulness of the service here matches the high quality of the food. For outstanding gourmet food, Dean and Deluca is tops as a stop.",10

When I tried to order, twice now, a ham and cheese Panini with the same exact him, the store person guided me to a baguette with the same ham and butter in it. When I instructed him that I did not want a baguette with butter and ham, and that I wanted a penny any as is listed on the sandwich board, he told me they did not have that kind of bread. What?  In a store where a ham sandwich runs around 9.50 and that boasts a board selling paninis of customers choosing, to be turned away and told to go get my own bread, pay For it and bring it back seems unacceptable.  I would suggest removing the sandwich board that says you can make your own panini with meat choice if you cannot, in fact, make said thing.  I just wasted my entire lunch break walking there for a craving that was right in front of me but was refused to be made... even though it seems that several sandwiches are ore made there daily and in display for the taking and for the hot pressing... the aforementioned Croque Sammy is one of said ore made delights.  Just sad that a simple request was detracted simply because a person at the counter with zero line behind me found it easier to steer me away and toward buttered French bread... sometimes it's a bummer when someone like me with a foodie following has to experience this at a store that truly makes the BEST ham sandwiches :/.

So, I was really surprised when I opened my Oregon Blue cheese, from Oregon Rogue Creamery, sold at $25.00 per pound, that it did not look fresh, & even more surprising, it did not taste fresh.  I only recently discovered this blue cheese, made in Oregon, & I really love the story behind this cheese & the care that goes into making it. So when I buy it, it's a treat for me, because the first time I bought it was at Whole Foods, East 57th street, & it was $42.99 pound. Yes!! So I bought a small sliver --it looked & tasted great & fresh.  The Oregon Blue cheese tonight was a disappointment, & it was less expensive than at Whole Foods. But, in my humble opinion, as a blue cheese lover, it did not taste fresh, it tasted past its prime. I will call Dean & DeLuca tomorrow. I really can't imagine that they meant to sell this, I don't know. Anyway, overall, I still like Dean & Deluca; I'd still recommend it. I just took off one star b/c of this cheese. I guess the moral of the story--ask for a taste!! Shoulda, woulda, coulda. Bummer!!!But my relationship with D&D shall continue, but I have learned my lesson--I shall always try to ask for a taste, before I buy ANY FOOD ITEM, other than fresh produce. I think D&D still sells Fran's yummy chocolate covered caramel, that gold-wrapped, confection that is so delicious. It's about 2"" long, 1/2"" wide, wrapped in gold foil, and sometimes near the registers, but more often in the candy section---mmm, yummy, creamy, soft, fresh, and about $2.50 or so. Try it!

But, they have a really nice cheese/charcuterie/antipasti selection that's hard to beat and not terribly overpriced (but it is overpriced, just not terribly). I mostly come for lunch, and usually lunch is soup. They have 6 different soups each day and most don't repeat daily. Most of them are good, but sometimes I find them oversalted (lobster bisque with cognac, wild mushroom). They have a deal where you can get a soup and half sandwich and the sandwiches are pretty nice. They also have some hot prepared foods to grab and go -- the half chicken isn't a bad deal at $7. There's also a giant chicken pot pie and a huge portion of mac and cheese. But the real thing that keeps me coming back is the maple sriracha tofu. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. It's all I want.

No email received. Never found out if gift was sent. My order history page showed it as ""pending"". I had to contact them to find out that in spite of the ""pending"" designation and no email, the gift was sent to my boss.Then I ordered macarons, which required next day air due to freshness issues. I paid the $30 for next day air expecting them to be shipped that date (Jan 2) and delivered on the next day, Wednesday, because I know the office to which I sent the package was closed Thursday and Friday, so nobody would be there to pick up until Monday. Well, same issue--no shipping notification email, ""pending"" in my order history.

I wanted to purchase everything I saw but I contained myself and settled for a lemon meringue tart for dessert. The lemon was a bit tart, as expected, and the structure on the bottom was crisp. I felt that the whip cream was a bit too much for me, but that's just my opinion.

107,1,6/6/2015,946,4,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",Danny V.,34,3.0,131,"Dean and Deluca is a great place to waste your money on mediocre, hot food. Do not buy their Mac and Cheese and Lasagna Bolognese. It's good, yes. But it's not worth the insane prices of $10 and $13. My usual rule of thumb for D&D is that you will get 60% satisfaction for what you pay. For instance, the Bolognese would be a decent deal at $7. Hot food, out of the way, D&D is a borderline Wonka-esque gourmet grocery with plenty of really good little things. It's all insanely priced, but this place isn't for you. It's for people who have a car in the city. It's for people who never use the subway. It's for people who say things like, ""I avoid Brooklyn."" Look, if you go into D&D looking to get a bargain or even your money's worth, you're going to leave sad. It's just not there. I've tried a bunch of things here and I can honestly say, the prices don't translate to higher quality most of the time. I'm not a chef so take this with a grain of Sea Salt (probably $7 here). There are tons of great little treats you can only get at D&D and these are worth a sporadic splurge. This is the perfect place to try every now and again to remember your place and socioeconomic status. If your default Yelp search is $$$, you'll adore it.",2

The Soho branch is located in an old building, with high ceilings and a very white, cool factory feeling. For delicatessen, it is the best there is, with very knowledgeable staff, and there is nothing that you can not get there. I love getting a sandwich there which is sometimes stressful to order as you need to be quick knowing what you want if there is a line - which is the case more often than not. It is however worth the wait and the quick spelling of your favored fillings. Same at the coffee/cake station..Sometimes I get sushi and eat it in the small area at the entry way. People are used to moving close to each other in this area so don't be shy.What I always look forward to is the merchandise: next to cook books and absolutely everything you need for cooking, Dean and DeLuca offers a great range of cotton bags for shopping, which I always bring back to replace plastic bags and carry one of those in my handbag all the time to use (..and avoid purchasing another plastic bag..). This is also the place to buy gifts - I like the Dean and DeLuca spice tins, but there is so much more..My best purchase ever was the Dean and DeLuca stainless steel coffee thermos, which is completely leak proof, nice and sleek, and keeps teas and coffees warm for ages.

I visited NYC on travel for my company and decided to treat myself to a dessert at Dean & Deluca on Broadway. The dessert counter is heavenly in this place - one of the most beautiful and high end displays of desserts I've seen in a long time. I knew exactly what I wanted. What I always wanted. The Lemon Meringue Tart.Now mind you - this thing was $7.50. The full tart was $30. I was doing some mathematics on the economy of scale of buying the whole tart vs. a tartlet, but decided that trying to eat a full lemon meringue tart over 3 days and then getting on a 5 hour transcontinental flight back to San Francisco probably wasn't very smart. I decided to go with the $7.50 tart.It was excellent - lemony, but not overwhelming. Strong meringue (it was the end of the day so I worried about it being rubbery and stale, but it wasn't), excellent crust and a surprise bonus of some sort of delicious sponge cake in the middle. I wish I would have been able to afford the delicious desserts here earlier in life. But I've finally made it and I will be back on subsequent trips to NYC to eat their tarts again.",1

Class!! The chicken salad is not very good. I don't understand how the prepared spaghetti squash with cilantro is more expensive per lb than the fried chicken? Hmmm?  Also, for such a high end shop, it is a bit surprising that they don't regularly carry grass fed/finished meat.  But even if they did, I'm sure the price point would be very high. One other thing, I have to say, it is annoying that they only sell ultra pasteurized heavy cream...that stuff does not even have to be refrigerated and has Carrageenan added to it (not good!)  Overall, while I like Dean & DeLuca for some things, for regular grocery shopping I think Whole Foods is better.",4

The arrangements of fresh produces and the way the store is set up make grocery shopping so much more enjoyable, even for non-cooks like myself!

Prices seem to be higher than most gourmet food stores in NYC , but they have products you won't see in some of the other better food stores.",

Called it a epicurean, gourmet, food emporium, super delicatessen, or what ever you can image, it's still truly a food obsess paradise for many including myself.Similar to Zabars in uptown, Dean & Deluca is more modernize version of a comparable nature. Exploring and finding neat & new items is part of the fun and excitement I find every time I'm roaming the aisles.",1

My girlfriends and I stopped in for some coffee and pastries for a light and quick breakfast, and as always, I was not disappointed. I love the Dean and DeLuca location in Georgetown, DC, but it just doesn't compare to the selection in SoHo! I was able to try a white peppermint latte and thought it was delicious, and we all indulged in a chocolate pistachio pastry as well as a raspberry pistachio tart. Beautiful for the eyes AND the stomach! Both were so delicious and really put us in good spirits :) And I ALWAYS check out their floral selection - they did not disappoint! Gorgeous calla lilies and roses galore. Big thumbs up for me!",

The breakfast selection is varied and each item on the menu is delicious and tasty. The assortment of cakes will make you mouth water and they are worth trying. With a few around Manhattan Island, they are worth a visit!",

Can't exactly find that anywhere else in the neighborhood. The employees are extremely rude but it depends on which person. My coworker told me she used to come here all the time to grab a quick lunch during her break but one time, an employee from here went up to her and said ""Don't let me catch you stealing anything here"". Okay, that's extremely rude and racist! She's African American too and a regular customer. Also because I'm very short and look like I'm still in high school, some workers think I'm going to steal things too. I had an employee follow me twice on different days and just glare at me while I'm shopping. Seriously, if you're going to do that to a regular customer, then you've got problems.",4

197,,3/26/2015,36,,"New York, NY",Christina M.,0,5.0,8,"The best chai I have found. I don't know WHAT makes it so good because I'm sure they just use powder but it is delicious every single time. Whether I get it with whole milk, soy milk, fat-free milk, or almond milk it remains creamy and delicious. It is also not extremely pricey compared to their other stuff. The medium chai is about $3-4 i think. Their store seem like they have some great quality stuff, but I just haven't had the opportunity to try yet.All I can recommend is the chai!!!!!",

It's always a treat to stroll the aisles and see what lovely and unique things they have.  Their food is good too!  Sushi is fresh, coffee is great and the red velvet loaf is fantastic. You just can't go wrong with this place. And all the staff are friendly too.",1
199,1,11/28/2012,107,,"Pasadena, CA",Ana C.,453,4.0,129,"I believe this one is their flagship one.A gourmet market full of imported foods from Europe (balsamic vinegars, olive oils, atun...), cured meats, artisan bread, and great coffee.  It is very well stocked, but somehow I prefer the one in Georgetown.  That one has a nicer feel.  Maybe because this one in NYC is always crowded, full of tourists, and New Yorkers on a rush.",
