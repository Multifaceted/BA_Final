0,Dan M.,"Astoria, NY",18,23,58,5.0,9/16/2018,"I typically prefer to cook American standards at home so we rarely go to diners.  But my wife and I were on the UWS on Sunday morning and I was starved, so we stopped in for breakfast.Manchester Diner nails it...menu definitely has enough variety with all the diner standards, but isn't a phone book, either.  Service was quick and polite.My wife got the matzoh ball soup...broth was excellent and she could add her salt as needed rather than the typical problem of it being overly salty from the kitchen.  The balls were soft and fluffy but held their shape.  I had the smoked salmon Benedict..for only $15.95 which seemed like an excellent price for that neighborhood.  Also cane with a pretty generous portion of home fries.All in all, a fantastic, quick meal and would definitely return next time we're hungry and up by Columbia.",,,
1,Ana O.,"Buffalo, NY",127,9,1,5.0,5/16/2018,"I love this place! My family and I have been coming here for ...a very very long time. We get along well with everyone! My favorite dish: Zorbas Omlette. It's not in the menu- that's a perk of not being a demanding gentrifier.Anyways- I take all my friends here including my partner- we love it- we loveeee the service! IMPORTANT NOTE:If you have bad reviews it's because youre probably new and weren't born/raised in the neighborhood. Get your panties out of a wad, tip well, and maybe then your service would be better.",,,
2,Shelby M.,"Daly City, CA",13,36,50,5.0,9/25/2018,"I ordered the Manchester steak sandwich, which was great, but I'm giving five stars because of the kind elderly man who was working the when I came in! He was very friendly, attentive, and clearly cares about the customers. He has definitely developed friendships with the regulars at this diner, which was nice to see. It's a quaint diner with decent food, but come just for the great service!",1,1,1
3,Watson E.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,0,5.0,10/29/2018,"With gentrification taking over New York City like a cancer, there remain a handful of classic diners like this one. What a delight to have a waiter who knows many of his customers, listens carefully, has a cheery disposition- and gets every order out quickly and flawlessly. All this without being cloying or bothering me while I'm trying to eat with that ever-maddening, ""is everything ok??"" Of course it is ok, and I know he knows it. Places like Manchester are a pleasure not only for the delicious food, but also simply to observe, as every worker does his/her part to make it run like a well-oiled machine.",,,
4,Lori G.,"Danbury, CT",38,116,164,4.0,8/5/2018,"Arrived early on a Sunday morning and we were the first to sit outside. They easily and happily accommodated our baby with stroller and our dog. The hostess, servers and wait staff were all very friendly. It is so rare to have a dinner with outside seating. You can tell the food is home cooked and better quality than most dinners in the city. They have a standard breakfast menu but does the job. I like how their waffles come with nuts and fruit and yogurt. My husband had the corn beef hash which was tasty (even though Not my favorite). All in all - a solid diner on the UWS.",1,,1
5,Lucy C.,"New York, NY",120,101,23,3.0,8/18/2018,"I tried this place a few months ago for brunch and I was sadly disappointed. The service was horrible. As soon as I walked in, I was not sure if I could seat myself or if I had to wait. They finally saw me and they told me to sit in one of the booth sections. I finally got a menu and ordered one of their brunch specials and asked the waiter what he suggested. He told me to get the brunch specials as it comes with coffee and juice which was great. I ordered a type of omelette and it was very disappointing. He asked me what bread I wanted on the side and I asked for wheat. I got white instead. I couldn't even get his attention for  refill for coffee or to ask about my bread. I decided to just eat it but didn't even finish it since it was not great. I was disappointed and really wanted to love it.",,,
6,Andrew W.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",314,36,43,1.0,9/1/2017,"Why this place pissed me off. There is nothing worse than that feeling. You're busting for a pee but there is nowhere to go so you go into the nearest place that has a restroom despite the only sign in the doorway. Not a sign that says, ""Best breakfast in town"" or ""Try our pancakes"", no, a big neon yellow sign designed to prevent you splashing your hopes. ""Restrooms For Customers Only. Thank You.""Staring at defeat you walk in, offer to pay for coffee if you can use the restroom.After 4 minutes of discussion, and 4 minutes of dancing, the owner is consulted. He says no. Paying for coffee does not make you a customer.Not piss off but take your piss off my premises. The price of my restroom more than the price of my coffee. Thank goodness for the Asian Dried Hotpot the other side of the street. They didn't even ask for the price of a cup of coffee. Not even a dollar. I left them five. As I finish writing this the owner comes out. I give him a shout. Ask him he'd like me to read him my review. He says yes. I start reading. He starts getting fidgety. Then, yes you guessed it, he tells me to....",2,2,
7,Alyssa W.,"New York, NY",578,19,5,1.0,3/25/2018,"I had a really mediocre brunch here. It's unfortunate that there aren't good diners near morningside heights, so despite the poor reviews, we decided to try this place out. We won't be coming back. I got the corned beef hash with cheese and they just stuck 2 slices of American cheese over the eggs and the corned beef tasted like it came out of a can. My boyfriend got the Mediterranean omelet which was so salty it was hard to eat. The waiters never came back to see how our food was. As we were getting ready to leave, one of the waiters spilled water all over the floor and got my legs wet. They didn't apologize or even acknowledge it, they just shouted at each other to get a mop. Bad food, worse service -- I would NOT recommend coming here.",1,,
8,Chris P.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,2/7/2018,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. It took almost 3 hours for food to arrive and each time we followed up with Manchester, they lied about the food being delivered. Food ordered at 7:42 pm, did not arrive until 10PM.  When I contacted seamless to complain, the app suddenly updated with delivered time as 8:15. LYING! Seamless called the restaurant to state food arrived at 10 pm and they insisted it was not true! How about just saying you don't have enough delivery guys and tell us it's late so sorry- here is a free egg cream, cookie to shut us up. If they can't  be honest, how do you know if they are hygienic with your food ?  I will admit, it's my fault. On Seamless, there were multiple reviews with my same experience and I should have listened. So pay heed to mine.",2,,

10,Shayan S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/2/2018,"Corned beef and hash is excellent as is the French toast.Their coffee is usually on point too.Favorite place to go in the area, regardless of time of day",,,
11,Michael E.,"Crown Heights, NY",7,7,6,1.0,11/5/2017,"I want so badly for this diner to be good. It is not. I've tried sparsely over the past 5 or so years, and it consistently disappoints. Location is in fact not everything, thought it appears to be the only positive quality. I don't care about anything at a restaurant except the food. Bad staff- don't care. Ambiance- don't care. Lights, colors, this, that- don't care. If you're a restaurant in NYC, you have an obligation to be awesome, memorable, accommodating to all, delicious. The Manchester Diner is none of these things. The food is awful, clearly catering to tourists who's tastebuds have been fooled by the aura of the Upper Westside. I appreciate the sometimes rough and fast pace of NYC diners, and most of our cherished establishments can operate this way and always leave you satisfied. TMD does the opposite. You always leave questioning your day, because your now grumpy tummy only wants to lay down. Food is made with love, and there is little to be found here.",2,,
12,Donna C.,"Trumansburg, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/8/2017,"This would be great as a skit for a comedy stand-up, but not so fun in real life.Have been here 4 times. Moved to the neighborhood 1 year ago, and wanted this to be a regular go-to. The first three experiences were great; went back because the portions are generous and the fries and brown gravy are way better than Tom's down the street. I like french fries with brown gravy, and I understand that I have to pay for the side of brown gravy. The first three times I went, the bowl of gravy was 3/4 full for $4. It's worth it; their gravy rocks. The last time I went, I got the french fries with brown gravy and my daughter got the mashed potatoes with brown gravy. Her bowl of gravy was 3/4 full, but mine was half full. I know, it's only gravy, but the disparity was so glaring...So I asked the waiter if he could fill my bowl similar to the other. He did not seem to understand me. I pointed to her bowl, which she was now actively pouring gravy from onto her mashed potatoes. Still, when she put it down, you could see where the fill line had been. He was still confused, and as I tried to find another way to say it that made sense, the owner came over. ""What's the problem?""""Oh, hey! I was just asking if he could fill my bowl of gravy...we got two bowls, and one was 3/4 full, but this one was only half...""""You have to pay extra for more gravy.""""I'm not asking for another side order; it looks like the kitchen staff might have been in a hurry and just didn't fill this bowl. But you can see that the other bowl...""""You cannot have more gravy unless you pay for it.""""I'm willing to pay for the side of gravy...that's not what I'm saying. See this bowl? I just...""Now the other owner came over, so there were three of them crowding around our table, and other diners were all beginning to stare at us.""What's the problem?"" ""She wants the gravy, but doesn't want to pay for it."" ""No, I'm happy to pay for it! I just wanted the bowl I got to be filled fairly...this is not a big deal. I didn't know it was going to turn into such a scene...""""You cannot have more gravy unless you pay for it."" ""I don't think you understand...I'm happy to pay for the side of gravy. I just want it to be a full order of gravy...this bowl (which I had not touched) is only half full."" Now both of them started badgering me at the same time, and loudly too. I said, ""Hey, hey could you please stop? We live in this neighborhood and were going to make this our regular place. Why would you make such a big deal over gravy?""At this point, one of the owners snatched my bowl of gravy, went back to the kitchen, and brought it back brimming and dripping down the side of the bowl. I thought that was the end of it, but they stayed right at table side, still hammering me verbally. I asked them to please leave our table, but they continued. I asked them again to leave us alone and let us eat in peace, and they both left, muttering to each other. The waiter was obviously embarrassed by their behavior, but couldn't say anything. Did they charge me extra for filling the bowl? No. Can't make this stuff up.",3,,1

14,Dos T.,"Chicago, IL",66,270,461,2.0,9/10/2016,"I'm mad.  And, it's dangerous to come to Yelp when your mad - but when I arrived I made it clear that I didn't want any single use plastics and everyone was too busy to respect me enough to say that they couldn't do a bagel with cream cheese w/o it and unstead sent me off w/ a $12 bill an an unfinished order. Paid $12 for an iced coffee, orange juice and bagel w/ cream cheese to go and waited 25minutes.  When I got to work, bagel didn't have any cream cheese.  Went back at 320pm and told them I was upset - they told me it was busy so that's how it goes and it takes the kitchen a long time.  25 min for a toasted bagel??  I bring my own reusable cups - I don't believe it's harder to fill them than their plastic cups - and the bagel come in tinfoil.FYI - they don't have cream cheese in the kitchen.. They only have single use plastic pods like the table jelly. There were empty tables in the morning - they were busy filling delivery orders.  Maybe this is a place to order online from only.PS: I didn't come in wanting a bagel & cream cheese and OJ - I wanted coffee. I didn't have my cash & they have a $10 minimum for cards.  I should have gone somewhere else.  My bad.",3,,

17,Nancy H.,"Philadelphia, PA",540,153,8,4.0,1/9/2017,"Bright decor and friendly staff and quick service, with the food coming out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering. I once came here before catching a flight and got my food in time. Their portions are big and yummy. I usually get their vegetarian frittata, which is a huge platter of egg and vegetables. I think they choose speediness over fluffiness for their frittata, so it's a bit dense and thin for a frittata, but the quickness that the food comes out is incredibly consistent every time.I'm also in love with their chicken and eggs quesadilla! The cheese somehow becomes barely noticeable as a texture because it blends so well with the chicken, eggs, jalapenos, and mushrooms.",1,1,1
18,Shianti B.,"Manhattan, NY",208,81,134,3.0,3/7/2018,"So went here for a little date with my old co worker because we wanted some diner food. First, you can get better dining food than this. Anyway came in we both ordered the Turkey burger deluxe. The food was good. The turkey burger was seasoned and cooked well and the French fries were crispy, without burning. I was not mad at my meal at all. The turkey burger also was the only thing reasonably priced. The diners food menu was not that complexed were the prices needed to be so high. But that's what Broadway prices look like in some establishments. The bathroom did not smell clean either. Be warned though, the wait staff's unprofessionalism and the diners lack of flexibility toward customers who do not eat meat is apparent. While we were eating, the waiter was giving this other dining party a hard time about ordering pasta with vegetables added to it, without a meat/ meat sauce. Instead of taking their request to have vegetables and tomatoes sauce only, his response was we can give you pasta with olive oil or a salad. Seriously? There were other parts of there conversation that were cringe worthy but y'all and I don't have time for that. The owners are also ... bias toward specific customers, if you know what I mean. All and all, the food is not bad here, but I wouldn't recommend it due to the staff and the way they operate. Dine at your own discretion.",,,

He took our drink order and drinks came out right away. I opted for the Gorgonzola salad with chicken and my lady had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Phenomenal!! It was so so good. My salad was perfect, as well; light and crispy, I didn't want anything too heavy. I saved that for the side of onion rings. Crispy, crunchy and delicious. Oh, and the food flew out in under 10 minutes. The restaurant was pretty close to full, and definitely full when we arrived, so kudos to the back of the house. Portions were large, I took some home. Overall prices were quite reasonable. Sure, it's not the Four Seasons, but for the price, and fast, friendly service, I will definitely come back and eat here.",1,,1

We chose this one because we were hungry, no Yelp reviews intervention. Brunch was the call of the jungle.The menu it's your average diner cuisine, full of pancakes, bagels, waffles and frittatas. And good coffee, I may add.I had the tutti frutti waffles and I loved it. Fruits were super fresh and big waffle on the dot. My travel companions had bagel with salmon (humongous portion), fried eggs with fries and sausage. All good.Thanks to this review I will stop in this diner next time I'm in the city.

The food here is pretty good.  It's not like to-die-for, but if you're hungry this is it.  My friend ordered the club chicken sandwich and it was really tasty.  It's still diner food, not like anything gourmet, but it works.2. For the price you pay, the portions are humongo.  Be sure to go on Fridays for ~$10 lunch special- featuring soup and sandwich or pasta. 3.  The service here is not the best, we waited before we got seated because all the waiters/waitresses were busy, but they certainly made up for it when they were refilling our coffee and water for tea constantly.  The food also came relatively quickly.I would come here for a bite if you really like diner food or are just on a budget because this will certainly be a good choice (shout out to all my college students!).",,,

I wasn't expecting much, considering it was a diner bagel, but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't anything special, but definitely did the trick. They only offered two types of bagels, plain and sesame, but again, what can you expect. Service was attentive, and we were in and out pretty quickly, which, in our case, was a good thing.

In the last few years, BF and I have been trying new ones all around the city (new to us that is) and so here we were @ Manchester. Upon entering, I was struck with how small it is. Don't know why, but I expected it to be larger. We were seated in the worst possible spot, tiny table for two next to the kitchen, but we understood since it was pretty crowded - and I take that as a good sign, since neighborhood diners should have lots of neighbors there. To sum up  the experience, food was fine/good. I got a LEO, BF got another omelet, and we were both happy, especially for the price.Best thing was the service. We had a really sweet guy who gave us just the right amount of attention.

Look, I've been to a number of diners in NYC. There are some really great ones that are more like restaurants than diners and other that are crummy and quick, like Moonstruck. Let's be honest though, no one goes to a diner to expect fine dining. It's like when you go to TJ max and want something on sale - everything is already a giant sale. Anyway, I got the Uptown Frittata(sp?) Omelet with a cup of coffee. All for 15 bucks, which included a generous tip. They were quick, but not too quick to make me wonder how fast and carelessly someone made my meal and the actual omlete was very tasty. It wasn't a ton of food either, so I didn't feel stuffed or overwhelmed after the meal.  It was just right and the food actually tasted like food. I find that with diners like Moonstruck, Dennys, etc. there is something very rubber like about the eggs and meals in general. The omelet here actually tasted like a nice, well cooked meal. Now that I live in the area, I'll def be back. Oh and they deliver! yay :)",,,1

The meat was really juicy, I think this one was made from fresh ground beef, not a frozen patty, like some diners are inclined to serve. The same can't be said for the fries...edible, but weak. Probably from frozen. That said, it's way cuter than Westway was on the inside! Very fun and clean feeling. I'll definitely be back to judge the brunch! Always rooting for a solid diner in the neighborhood.UPDATE (4/29/12): So, I've obviously been back here quite a few times since my first review (half of them I haven't even checked in for), being as we live in the neighborhood. My boyfriend always gets the corned beef hash, and says it's tasty but ""is probably straight from a can"". And since I began attempting to eat vegetarian last month, I have deferred from my full Lumberjack breakfast routine (Always a delight! No ham, double bacon instead!) to just pancakes. Which, I have to say, are themselves really tasty...but they give you little packets of syrup instead of a little mini pitcher of it (what is that called??) and obviously, it's high-fructose corn syrup stuff, but really I couldn't expect anything more than that from a diner. And I've had a couple of their omelettes as well, so to report on those: generous portion sizes and fresh-tasting ingredients. Also, comes with potatoes and those are pretty darn good, too! Alas, all things considered, we still go there pretty much every other weekend. Review upped to four stars, the extra star of which is for the snappy and attentive service.",1,,

It was really cozy and warm inside, and not too crowdedI got French toast, turkey sausage, home fries and orange juice. The French toast was good, though calling it ""3 slices"" when it's really 1 whole slice and 1 cut in half is just...yeah. They gave me those little packs of syrup, which I hate. Either have pure maple syrup, or at least pretend it's real and put it in a syrup dish.  The turkey sausage had an odd texture, but the flavor was really good. The potatoes were okay, but they were kinda dry, not enough peppers/onions, and it was slightly underseasoned. The orange juice was fresh-squeezed.Pros: Food comes out pretty quickly, good French toast, bill was about $13 for a lot of food.Cons: I felt kinda rushed because a guy wanted to switch his seat, so they were going to give him my seat, even the the place was fairly empty.All in all, I'd go back again.",,,

97,Beth A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,12/7/2011,"I miss the old turquoise benches of the West Way diner -- as will as the sassy waitresses who always made a fresh pot of coffee for you.  Lighting is way too bright.  Service slow.  Music too jivey for a placid diner meal with the New Yorker by your side for company.  Also, a flat-screen tv with news or something or other flashing in the background.  Burger was good.  Grilled cheese not; didn't cover the bread which was too oily.  Boohoo.  I wanted it to be better.",2,,
98,Chad M.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",0,3,1,5.0,2/13/2015,Love this place. Good diner food and great customer service. Hope they stay around for a long time.,,,
99,Joy S.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",1,20,0,1.0,9/7/2011,"This restaurant won't be around long if it doesn't hire a better cook. The breakfast was horrible. Eggs too runny, pancakes way too overdone, homefries no flavor at all and breakfast meat undercooked. I will never eat here again! I ate 5% of my food and paid and left. I gave the normal tip even though it was glaringly obvious that I didn't eat the food and NONE of the staff even said goodbye or have a nice day or anything! I gave it 1 star because I can't choose zero (or can I?).",4,,
100,Carl F.,"NY, NY",1,51,0,3.0,9/23/2011,"Had a bacon cheeseburger deluxe and a soda.  $13.95.  A little too pricey.  To give props where due, the food was quite good.  VERY tasty burger and above-average fries.  The service was a bit slow, and I'm not sure why: it was only half full on a weekday lunchtime when most diners are packed.  I think they're in some trouble since the proprietor kept standing at the door waiting for customers.  Note to store owners: don't stand in the door waiting for customers.  It makes people feel uncomfortable and self-conscious and makes people who were thinking of coming in decide not to.They keep WKTU on the radio.  Loud.  I have no idea why.  HORRIBLE music, it turns the whole atmosphere to shit.  And it makes you feel like you have to leave as quickly as possible.",3,,
101,Elliott C.,"Manhattan, NY",6,30,1,4.0,11/16/2012,"This place should really have a better rating than it does. It has everything you would really want to find in a diner, and, because the quality of the food is good, it is my go-to diner in the area (not to mention that it was open for my last meal before the hurricane!). Normally, I go for the ""Zorba's omelette,"" a 3-egg omelette with tomatoes and feta, served with really great potatoes ($7.95), and I leave completely satisfied. Also. the 10% Columbia discount doesn't hurt.",,,
102,Daniel R.,"Manhattan, NY",75,7,0,1.0,3/15/2014,"Ordered a waffle, bacon, and a coffee. Waffle was so wet I had to throw it out. I ordered it plain. It was like it was dipped in water. Coffee spilled everywhere and was undrinkable. Far too sweet. Asked for it just with half and half. No sugar. I am now re ordering breakfast from somewhere else, a second time. Avoid at all costs.",1,,
103,Julia D.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",445,302,16,4.0,3/26/2012,"Yiiikes, 2.5 stars?! Oof. Luckily, my happenstance experience with the Manchester Diner was nothing short of very satisfactory. I managed to eat a healthy breakfast (whole grain waffles topped with low-fat yogurt and fresh berries), while stealing my companion's home fries and corn-beef-hash. The meal was cheap, super quick, efficient and kind service, and tasty, and I would come back for the cozy diner-feel as well. All in all a solid diner option in Morningside Heights.",,,
104,Simon S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,12/9/2012,"If you have money to burn and you don't care too much about how far your dollar goes, then no problem.  Go here.  If on the other hand you do care, then don't step foot in this place.  $12.25 for four measly pieces of chicken fingers and a separate side order of french fries.  I even had to ask them for bbq sauce.  The fries were greasy, and semi soggy, while the chicken fingers were small and unfulfilling.  I'm definitely not ever stepping back into this place.  This place is overpriced and very expensive for what you're getting.",,,
105,Tony Y.,"Kirkland, WA",0,9,0,1.0,8/17/2013,"Food is okay but terrible service. Ordered breakfast delivery and they missed my toast. Called in and they told me it would take them hours to to send me the toast, which didn't come at all. No explanations, no apologies and so I guess this is nothing uncommon here. Will never order from this place again given other similar places with better service and attitude for business.",1,,

107,Regina M.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,4.0,6/12/2014,"We come here about twice a month for breakfast and the food has always been good. Solid diner food, lots of options. Service is friendly. It's a small space, so a little cramped.",,,
108,Jin W.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,11/20/2013,"This place is great, def 5 stars for my experience. Staff are friendly very attentive, and the burger I got was really fresh and quality is good. I also had French toast once, and it was yummy!!! Def returning and recommend.",,,
109,Ben S.,"Park Slope, NY",12,98,0,4.0,9/8/2012,"Completely decent place that appears to be underappreciated on yelp... It's got all the characteristics of a traditional diner - cheap prices, prompt service, laminated menus, chrome fixtures - and it's not presenting itself as anything more (or less) than that. Other places nearby - Deluxe, for instance, comes to mind - will serve more sophisticated fare in an attempt to be both a ""diner"" and a classy restaurant at the same time, mostly as a means of justifying their grossly inflated prices for staples like pancakes. But back to the Manchester... I came away from my $5 eggs-toast-potatoes-coffee meal perfectly satisfied, pleased to have finally found a decent diner in the area. The student discount (10%) is also a nice little extra.",1,,
110,D-Maria B.,"Madison, WI",4,17,3,4.0,6/3/2012,"honestly, the food was good. nothing mind-blowing. but good. like, dependable good. the thing i really enjoyed with this spot was the service. everyone was so nice. the hippy hostess, the old man server, the dudes in the kitchen winking at me while i chowed down on my open-faced turkey dinner (for real, huge portions and done well).",1,1,1
111,Liam D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,59,0,2.0,5/5/2012,Manchester diner is one of the only diners I know about in the area so for that alone it gets a star but it also has pretty good burgers especially The Chipotle Burger. The chicken fingers are good as well but way to overpriced for the four small ones they give you. All in all it's a pretty average place that makes hit or miss good food,1,,
112,Nicole R.,"New York, NY",18,131,2,3.0,12/23/2011,i have to say that i had chicken soup delivered last night and it was one of the best chicken soups ive had in a long time and i eat a lot of chicken soup.  glad to have a good delivery stand by for when im under the weather.  it came quickly and hot.  just the way i like it!,1,1,
113,An M.,"Clifton, NJ",431,10,0,5.0,10/1/2011,"I have been here several times since it recently opened, and I am a fan! Will be coming here often whenever I feel like breakfast or diner food. Not only do they have potatoes late at night, but they taste good too. They also put on a fresh pot of coffee instead of being lazy and giving us whatever was left in the old pot. That shows personal care, and I am glad to be a patron at a place where the employees give a damn. They have honey, the waiters haven't messed up any orders at all, and they don't mind taking special requests. The food is definitely typical diner food, but it is good. The prices are just the same as any other diner in NY and even in NJ too! They did a very good job with the decor too, I like being in a place that looks clean and new, makes me forget about the dirty city outside the doors (no offense NY, I still love you).",2,,
114,Jane C.,"New York, NY",0,52,0,5.0,2/15/2013,"Can't go wrong with a classic diner...huge selection, great service and even have an impressive selection of beers (Blue Moon, Sam Adams, etc.)",,,
115,Harriet G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,17,0,4.0,9/1/2011,"The food is really good, service is excellent, and the menu almost identical to that of the City//Metro/Manhattan (formerly Key West) Diners--same owners, clearly. They're all overpriced, but what diner isn't in this neighborhood? I do miss the more varied  menu of the former tenant in this space, the Westway Diner, especially the varieties of omelets (like the Santa Fe, which came with a tortilla). I wish the Manchester didn't offer almost exactly the same dishes as its 3 local cousins, because that gives me little incentive to go here rather than the other places. The Westway was a nice break from the usual.",1,,
116,aaron l.,"New York, NY",18,3,2,4.0,2/7/2012,great little diner quick service and good quality cheap priced food and great milkshakes close to the train so its good grab a bite and then head to the movies. and recently renovated.,,,
117,Emily L.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,3/3/2012,"I live a block away and was worried when Westway closed (although the food there went downhill at the end)....but I've been to the Manchester Diner at least ten times and it's always been good.  It's a typical diner with diner food and atmosphere.  The servers are very nice, food arrives quickly as does the bill, which is right for a diner.  My family and I have ordered grilled cheese, pancakes, chicken soup, the crunchy ranch salad, a turkey burger, a blt, and scrambled eggs (these are just what I can remember offhand) and everything has been tasty and fresh.",,,
118,Blah Blah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,4.0,2/7/2013,it has really yummy food. you should go there because if you go there well you can get dessert stuff and good stuff so thats why you should go there.,,,
