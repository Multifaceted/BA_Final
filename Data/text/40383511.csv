1,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,4.0,3/24/2018,"I've had many a late night at Brandy's. Now that I love across the street, I tend to go less than I did before. I prefer Friday nights... getting in a little earlier to get good seats, this is typically before the doorman starts being a super asshole. I don't care who you are, he's a dick to mostly everyone... it's a wonder people don't just leave, honestly. There is a 2 drink minimum. Get seats and wait for the show. The cast and crew here bartending Ana waiting tables are all ex Broadway types, so most will belt out songs. The bigger man behind the bar sings Little Mermaid and it's awesome. Hope for a good crowd, enter tons of requests-and tip, then they tend to take better care of you. The bathrooms are disgusting. I honestly don't know why they don't put work into it, but it's always been that way and well, people keep showing up. Plus, I think they may be open til 4am nightly. Lol",,,1
2,Johanna Marie A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",52,5,0,2.0,9/17/2018,"Bartenders are rude. Cocktails are disgusting. I just love the fact that there's live piano music and guests can sing along while the pianist is playing some songs, but other than that, this place totally sucks!",1,,
3,Sharon P.,"Brooklyn, NY",261,142,101,5.0,9/16/2018,This place is incredible! Bartenders chiming in on the music supplies some surround sound. Drinks are strong! Place can get crowded if you don't show early enough for the performances so be wary of that.,,,
4,Julia M.,"Orlando, FL",78,47,34,4.0,11/18/2017,"Had a ton of fun at Brandy's. It's like a dive bar with great live music. The bartender Joe has an amazing voice and engages the crowd well. Piano play is super talented as well. It gets super packed so don't expect super quick service but the bartenders were friendly so we didn't mind. We waited about 25 minutes in line to get in, but the line moved fairly quickly and was well worth the wait. I do think the doorman should hold off on letting so many people in at a time, though. Definitely would return!",,,
5,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,5.0,5/20/2017,"I almost don't want to write this review in order to keep this place my little secret, but it's too cool not to share, and makes me look like I always go to fun places and do hip things.My main man Phil and I swan in during the most crowded time and get a primo seat on the banquet by the pianist, like that continuous shot out of Good Fellas. Only without me having to flush cocaine down a toilet at the end of the night. The place is small and they pack in an eclectic crowd. Some older folks, some younger folks and some in the sweet spot of 40-something like myself. I knew every song that was played and thank God singing along is encouraged because boy did I ever! The sets are impressively long,with various bartenders  and waitstaff taking a turn to sing. Everyone is crazy talented and it's a pleasure to listen (sing) to them. The service is prompt and attentive with a decent pour. There were a surprising number of small groups of friends at the tables, so don't let the size of the place stop you. You'll get in even on a Saturday night during lovely ""I have to get out of my house!"" weather. If not, just come back later. It's a great way to end a night out. So much fun!",5,4,5
6,Calluxe H.,"Madison, NJ",0,15,0,1.0,2/3/2018,"We just went to this place for the first time. It is very tiny. We got there early.......around 8:30. It is very dingy. There are some very cool vintage posters on the walls. I guess someone cared about this place at some point. That person must be long gone. The piano player was just ok. There was a female singer who was talented. The song selection was meh. One of the bartenders sang and he is talented too. Now on to the ladies room. Absolutely disgusting. Filthy hardly describes it. One stall and the floor literally has a hole in it. I almost sprained my ankle while squating!!!!!!!!! So, so bad! I honestly don't know how they pass any sort of inspection with the lack of concern for hygiene throughout.",1,1,
7,Megan R.,"Philadelphia, PA",185,17,1,5.0,7/23/2018,We were introduced by friends to this hidden gem a few years ago. Always have a good time when we go. Weekday evenings are best as it isn't too crowded.  The pianist are always excellent. Lively place with a fun crowd.,,,
8,Danny P.,"Miami, FL",0,6,1,1.0,12/8/2017,Wow crappy night! So crazy and sad to see such poor service. Door man was beyond a #%€€¥$&&! Mean and rude and I hope it's a schtick because it is to abrupt for the regular person. The bartender hates his job. The star is for the piano player who tried. As a gay man I am insulted and underwhelmed. As a person who is in service I am never going back!,2,1,
9,Courtney W.,"Washington, DC",250,404,183,5.0,5/2/2017,"SUCH a fun place! This venue is TINY, so make sure if you want to have a seat at a table you come immediately - like 830PM. No Joke. It quickly becomes standing room only once the piano bar starts up (around 930PM). We came promptly at 830pm on a Friday night and were able to get a nice set of chairs / tables for a group of 6. Disclaimer: Brandy's typically does NOT seat groups larger than 5 simply because they do not have the space. So be strategic about how you phrase your seating requests ;)Once the pianist starts, they require a 2-drink minimum. It does NOT have to be an alcoholic drink however, with they do not advertise. :) The table area does have waitress service once the show starts, and all of the staff are pleasant and friendly - and they frequently join the pianist for performances in the ""stage"" area.  I have heard some nights the staff are different and less pleasant... downright rude. I have not had this experience, although the ""bouncer"" seems to always have some sort of an attitude so tread carefully with him. Because of this bar's history, they focus a LOT on Broadway and show tunes. It started as a gay bar and it remains a gay influenced bar - so let's not go acting shocked here, people!",2,3,1
10,Ella L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,4,5.0,12/23/2017,Bookmarked this place for a long time and finally went last week. It is a small but very lively place. We went in just in time right before the music started. The line started outside around 10. Probably more crowded when the weather is warmer. Drinks are regular Manhattan price. A little pricey but if you like live music and like to sing along. This is the place to go. They do a lot of musical songs and also play as the audience requests. Definitely worth checking it out!,1,,
11,Hazel D.,"Toronto, Canada",0,16,0,4.0,12/7/2017,"A friend recommended we visit Brandy's on a Friday evening. That evening, Will Hall was on the piano - Will is SPECTACULAR. He's an extremely talented piano player and he kept us singing and laughing all night. The wait staff & bartenders are also talented singers.Quick tips:* It's a small bar so if you want to get a seat, I'd suggest arriving between 8:45-9:00 pm. The place fills up quite quickly. * Great for 2-4 people; otherwise, it might be tough to find a seat.* There's a two drink minimum and the place doesn't serve food.",1,,1
12,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,1.0,3/28/2017,"This place is such a great concept and clearly has a unique history. I wanted so badly to love it, but both times I've been here have been nothing short of a nightmare. It's a popular spot due to its novelty and pastiche, so there's always a line to get in. The space is way too small, and it's always packed to capacity on the weekends. People get very moody, especially after a few drinks and will push and shove you to get by. This attitude extends to the staff who are rude, surly and snooty and will treat you with a general contempt for merely existing.The last time I was here was especially horrid. The guy who runs the door is a sexist jerk. I'm an attractive woman (working, agency-repped curve model, at your service *tips cap* ) who rarely dresses ""sexy"" but decided to that night for fun. The bouncer started giving me crap about having the top button of my shirt undone and my black bra peeping through. My boyfriend had to intervene and tell him to knock it off. It was incredibly offensive and demeaning. His job is to check IDs and control the flow of people into the bar. Not to police women's fashion choices like he's their father or some flyover state pastor. Once we got in there, it was no better. Saturday nights are insane, and we couldn't even get a drink because apparently, the doorman had failed to do his ACTUAL JOB. If I hadn't been treated in such an egregiously offensive way, I may try coming back on a weeknight but now, methinks not!",6,,
13,julia s.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,42,3,1.0,6/8/2018,"Proud red hat supporters performing on Friday night (6/8/18). This red hater also incorporated the word ""cunt"" and ""bitch"" into his version of a The Little Mermaid. Looser bar for old school farts.",,1,
14,Emily B.,"Manhattan, NY",93,24,6,1.0,1/12/2018,"Extremely upsetting experience at Brandys wine bar... Have been there several times before during the piano bar singalong. Walked in with my friends on January 1st at 5 PM and was told that we couldn't have a drink because we were  too drunk??...  After only 2 beers at another bar. I feel that we have been majorly discriminated against as women.  There were several men at the bar drinking straight shots of whiskey. I still can't believe this happened to us. It was extremely messed up and I will definitely be letting everyone I know not to go to Brandy's, which used to be my favorite place to recommend to people. Sexist and discriminatory.",4,1,
15,Carla R.,"New York, NY",0,21,14,5.0,8/25/2017,"I'm so fortunate living right across the street from Brandy's piano bar, I'm becoming addicted to it, almost every night before to go to sleep, I go there x a glass of wine to enjoy the great music this talented people performance every night, from the pianist to the bartender and waitress, they not only sing beautifully but also entertained with jokes and request, making this place a unique best keep secret at upper east side!!!",1,,
16,Bryan B.,"Portland, OR",0,11,0,5.0,4/17/2018,"This piano bar is a jewel of the UES. I was recently in NYC for four nights, and Brandy's was a part of every evening. Every time I come to NYC, I stay at a place close by, just for easy access to Brandys.It gets a little too crowded on the weekends with chatty straight women, but the weeknights harken back to the good old days of piano bars.The people who own it and work there are wonderful, talented people.Thank you to Jimmy, Sean, Joe, Michael, and everyone who makes this place the treasure that it is. I hope it never goes away!",,,
17,John S.,"New York, NY",4,62,0,5.0,4/7/2018,I love this place.  It is always a lot of fun.  They have great singers and the bartenders are always nice and friendly.  Can't recommend this place enough.,,,
18,Melanie D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,60,2,5.0,7/27/2017,We try to visit bars with gay history anytime we vacation. And Brandy's did not disappoint.They are friendly to everyone! It is a small venue but when we went on a Sunday night it wasn't crowded. We sat at the bar but there were tables available.The drink price wasn't bad. And the bartender was awesome. It was an awesome environment. The pianist was excellent and the interactions among patrons was awesome. There were some amazing singers who stopped in. I highly recommend making Brandy's a part of your life.,1,,
19,Jamie R.,"New York, NY",7,110,60,5.0,2/19/2018,This place is always a fun time!! One of my favorite places to go. Go during a weeknight so it's not so crowded. The weekend is always packed. Love all the broadway songs and miscellaneous songs the piano player & bartenders sing. Everyone here is so talented! It's always funny how the piano player puts obnoxious & annoying people in check! So don't be that person or they'll call you out!,,,
20,Martina C.,"Long Island City, NY",61,269,198,4.0,1/3/2016,"I went to Brandy's on NYE with four friends, and overall was a nice fun night. We got there at 8:30 pm to catch a good table, since they don't take reservations and there are not many tables. Usually there is no cover charge, but on NYE you have to pay $10, which give you a party hatband/hat and a glass of champagne at midnight. We ordered few bottles of champagne and few other drinks. The pianist was ok; he was fun but didn't want to experiment too much in song he didn't know. He also had an iPad where he download notes (I miss old music-books and artists who memorized songs!)The two bartenders who joined him for few songs were talented: a redhead lady and a young guy. We had a good time, but the all night was ""ruined"" by the redhead waitress who follow us outside the bar to complained we didn't gave her enough tips. She was a tornado, really upset, yelling at us. I think we did fine, the usual 20%, plus my boyfriend previously paid with a good 25% on drinks at the bar. Beside this upsetting moment, it's definitely a nice piano bar to try on, and have a good time.",1,1,1
21,Malin J.,"Manhattan, NY",2,1,0,1.0,3/25/2017,"DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR BILL!!! I have never left a review on Yelp but I just felt like I had to after tonight. I took my mom here who was visiting me from Sweden and they ""mistakenly"" overcharged us. I politely brought this up with the bartender and he did not care at all and ignored me. When I told him a second time he started screaming that we were thieves and that we will never be allowed in this bar again, out of nowhere without even a conversation. I have never been mistreated like this in my life and I was shaking for hours afterwards because of the shock. All the bad reviews are unfortunately true. I will never go here again and neither should you.",8,3,
22,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,4/7/2017,"Disclaimer: I LOVE Broadway which heavily influences how much fun I had here.We came here after an engagement party at Five Mile Stone (see my review) to cap off the night. There was someone on line in front of us and the getting-in situation was ambiguous at best. At first, the ""bouncer"" didn't let us in and rudely commented on the fact that my boyfriend had his phone out (he was calling an Uber since it didn't seem like this was happening). But, I turned on the charm, as I'm known to do, and persuaded him to open the door for us.It was pretty crowded, though there were 2 seats at the bar. Signs all over the place said it was 2-drink minimum, but it didn't seem like that was being enforced. Brandy's is small and all of the tables/seats are within eye/earshot of the piano. I was extremely pleased that the first song we heard was from Hamilton. I'd say the music variety was great, mixing in some popular non-Broadway songs at times. It's certainly not the same experience as Marie's Crisis (see my review), but it definitely satiated my appetite for some show tunes. It looked like there was waitress service, though I can't comment on how good or bad it is. I think it's very important to note that my boyfriend does not enjoy nor know anything about Broadway but had a great time (I think), so don't be scared away if you're with someone who's in the same boat.",4,2,1

24,Jennifer R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/15/2017,"Awful awful place. I've lived on the UES for years and have gone to Brandy's many times. It's a shame that they have such awful people working the door. We showed up at 8:30pm last night to an empty place. Even though we were a group of 4, we were refused entry because of a new rule that groups larger than 6 are no longer allowed (which in of itself doesn't even make sense). The doorman cursed at our group and was yelling at us in our face (told us to get the F out of there) and then the ""manager"" who was inside then proceeded to call my friend the C word. Completely disrespectful and inappropriate and an unacceptable way to run a business. I will never ever attempt to go there and no person should ever give this place their money.",4,1,
25,Jeffrey O.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,48,3,3.0,11/25/2017,"This fun gay piano bar has been invaded by hordes of straight younger women, some dragging their boyfriend in, hey its fun, more fun than any straight bar ever was for sure.. The pianists now cater to these younger people so you get less and less Broadway tunes which kinda ruins it for me. I prefer when YOU sing the song you request (for the most part) because here everyone is writing songs on napkins and the piano guy has a stack of request in front of him. The place gets way too crowded and they need to get that under control, it's obscene how packed it gets in there. It's a gay bar before 8p, after that it's a college girls bar.",1,,
26,Brian C.,"Macon, GA",0,2,0,5.0,1/27/2018,Well worth the Uber fare to get from the theater district and the boring bars in that area.  The bartenders and waitresses have amazing voices and often sing with the piano.  Lots of fun - just go.,,,
27,Cheryl G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,4,2,2.0,5/11/2018,"Disappointment. I've been coming here for 15+ years and stopped in to have a drink before going home as we usually do. The doorman was a complete asshole! The moment we walked in he accused us of being drunk and unable to serve, then asked us to leave. I was shocked as we were completely sober. Sad to see a neighborhood staple turn away their local loyal customers. Get it together, Brandy's. What's happening to you?!",1,,
28,Joseph S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,17,0,5.0,6/14/2018,"Was there on a Tuesday night and it was fantastic. Singing was absolutely excellent, piano playing extraordinary. Great atmosphere. Most people very friendly, staff particularly. However, the old fashioned I had was not good at all",,,
29,Evelyn L.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",72,1,0,1.0,5/10/2017,"Very crappy. There are table and chairs in front of Ladies' room. Two minimum drink for this shitty place? And because we tipped 18.5% instead of 20%. That grumpy old waitress yelled at us ""20% tips!"" ""Don't come back!"" You (waitress and the place) just don't deserve it.

30,Paul S.,"Beacon, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/5/2018,"I was looking forward to going to a piano bar with some friends. I ordered a few bud light bottles, gave the bartender a couple of dollars for tip, and he subsequently pulled me from my group and chewed me out for not tipping enough, which was very unprofessional. He then told his other bartender to not serve myself or anyone else in my group and they would completely disregard our orders after. Worse of all I checked my credit card receipts and compared it with my bill and saw that they added more money to my tip without my approval.",,,
31,Alex S.,"Manhattan, NY",173,88,44,4.0,1/31/2017,"Brandys is always a fun time. Yes the place is small and there is limited seating but that's what makes it so intimate.

33,Pamela S.,"New York, NY",899,1199,107,4.0,2/23/2017,"This is not a swanky piano bar. It's divey. It's small and cramped. But for the price of 2-3 drinks, you get an evening of live entertainment. Sing along to standards and request your favorites. Stay as long as you want. I recommend getting there before 9:30 (and the smaller your group, the better), in order to get a table. The live music starts around 10pm. Later arrivals end up by the bar or on line outside.",1,,1

35,Arielle C.,"Manhattan, NY",54,56,3,5.0,4/24/2017,"I absolutely LOVE Brandy's. It's always the best time. I do have one note though (and I'm not docking a star because Brandy's really IS one of the best gem's in the city). The one thing I'd say is maybe come on Friday instead of Saturday (though they have shows 7 nights a week). The pianist on Saturday is great, but he sort of forces everybody to listen to the songs he wants to play for 45 minutes (music from the 30s and 40s) before he actually starts playing what people want to hear . The first time I saw him, I thought it was because there were some older audience members, and I figured he was catering to everybody. Then I went again this Saturday and he played the exact same set -he called it Music Education for the Millennials. Now, don't get me wrong, I actually love music from the 30s and 40s - Cole Porter is amazing and I listen to him and his contemporaries frequently. I just don't like the assumption (or condescension) that I'm a stupid millennial with no knowledge of anything before 2000.",,,

It was a fantastic experience! They charged $10 cover fee on NYE, but definitely worthy of it.You can request songs to pianist to play or you can go on stage to sing a song if you would like.

It's been on my list for a while and I wanted to check it out.I arrived a little after 8:30pm, deciding to enjoy a drink before the show started. The bartender was very nice & informative, sharing his experiences about the establishment.I told him that I didn't expect the place to be a small bar, but more like a dressed up Broadway-esque establishment decoration-wise. He took no offense and said others have also had the same expectation, yet it didn't deter them from enjoying Brandy's. I ended up being approached by a random woman and her suave, gentleman friend. We hung out for a few hours at this place. The tunes were amazing. Many great voices. There wasn't a bad singer in the house. Broadway tunes, some recent top 40, tunes from the 50's - 80's. It was all incredibly enjoyable.My intention was to enjoy the crowd and sing along. Should the guy at the piano know the song I wanted to sing, I would sing it. He didn't know it. It was an old school Mariah Carey tune from 1990. No worries though. I asked the random woman I met what she did for a living.  Well, she transformed into an insanely deranged psycho, viciously attacking me with her words, which I then cleverly & clearly corrected her for, saying she was crazy & delusional. She literally embodied the soul of a rabid female dog.Hopefully, when you go, you don't meet any people who are deemed appropriate for a straight jacket and padded room.Other than that crazy interaction with an insolent crazy, I truly had a good time at this place.",2,7,1

The place is pretty crowded on a late Friday/Saturday night with really no place to sit. The pianist was great but the singing wasn't the best. If you're around the UES late night and want to just pop in for a few minutes go for it. Just be mindful of the crammed space and the average sounds.

45,Dan N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",239,3,0,2.0,2/17/2017,"As a frequent guest of Brandy's (all amazing experiences) I wanted to introduce this hidden gem to my friends. So earlier in the week we started up an email chain and made plans for 4 couples to meet there early to get a table to enjoy some sing alongs and drink the night away. Unfortunately the ""manager"" behind the bar was extraordinarily rude and told us that we were not welcome (it was 9PM and nobody else was there) because we were a group of more than 5. This guy also went above and beyond calling us F'N kids and yelled at our wives. It's sad when such talented individuals who perform there have a shadow cast over them by poor service and a manager who needs to go to anger management. I would like to say I will go back but after this experience I feel like my money can be spent at another place that appreciates their fan base/customers.  If you can avoid this place, you should.

50,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,3.0,2/4/2016,"Fun, GAY dive piano bar, with a lot of (sometimes ornery) talent at the mic ...Why am I emphasizing GAY?  I'm not.  It doesn't matter, nor should it.  In fact, I've been here a hundred times and never even knew.  But during my last outing here, I was treated to the singer announcing to the world that we were in fact in the midst of a gay bar.  He even asked the crowd - repeatedly - to indicate by a show of hands if they were heterosexual (most were).  A bit bizarre to me, and very unnecessary.  Was he trying to embarrass people?  Make them feel like they shouldn't be there? The bar, though small, regularly draws a pretty diverse crowd of younger, older, singles, couples, groups and apparently, different sexual persuasions.  To me, it shouldn't matter, as long as everyone is having fun.  And it certainly shouldn't matter to the staff, as long as patrons are keeping their tip jars full.  But what do I know ...That said, there is some pretty great talent at this place.  There are two women who appear regularly, and they have voices that give me chills, and are sweet as can be.  These two really have the talent for bigger and better places.  There is a guy there who regularly sings the classic, ""Hallelujah"" (one of my favorites), and his version is spectacular, sung with an emotion that seems to rise up right from his inner core.  Love it.  The servers double as the entertainment, and group singalongs are not uncommon.  After all, do you really expect to go into a piano bar and not sway with your neighbors to ""Piano Man""?Drinks are mediocre - best to keep it simple.  I've gotten strange looks when I've asked for a more ""exotic"" cocktail, and I think I tested a bartender's anger management capabilities when I - how dare I - offered to explain how to make it.  Take it easy, fella ... you are the professional mixologist.  Message received.I don't know if it's the starving artist thing or what, but, much like the sexual orientation-obsessed gent mentioned above, there is sometimes an angry undercurrent flowing through the generally good vibe of the place.  One time, I was snapping some pics, as I often do, and the singer kept asking me if I was taking selfies.  He even ordered me to delete some pics.  I didn't.  Another time, the piano player seemed to have some beef with the guy sitting next to me (who I didn't know), which, in an attempt to lighten the moment, prompted me to say out loud, ""can't we all just get along?""  Yet another time, I was trying to coerce my very talented but shy friend to get up and sing a song.  I was reprimanded, and told not to speak for the guy - if he wants to sing, he will say so.  I responded by clarifying that I did not have my friend by the ""trousers"" -  I was just supporting him/them.  Even the piano player cracked a smile at that one.Notwithstanding the occasional starving artist/tortured soul syndrome, this is a cool place.  No-frills, generally good vibe and fun time.  Even if you're not gay.",6,2,3
51,Nicole Z.,"New York, NY",8,2,0,1.0,12/7/2015,"Before, Brandy's used to be my favorite bar. I had respect for it and had an amazing time every time, except this time. Due to having such a great time, I wanted to have my birthday celebration here. I knew their website said they didn't take reservations for big parties but I assumed if I walked in with everyone, they wouldn't refuse 15+ people's business / money / company. I was very wrong. As soon as I stepped in the door, with at least only 7 people with me, the bouncer immediately stopped me, started yelling at me, and asking how many people i was with. I said about 15 and he immediately rejected anything else I tried saying. Then the bartender chimed in and said I was fucking ridiculous and that I could've called. Bouncer then took over to tell us to get the fuck out, we can't accommodate you. Even got an ""are you kidding"" after I said the amount of people. I've never had someone speak so rudely to me. If they had given an actual explanation, maybe I would want to go back. But after being cursed at and kicked out for trying to give them business and have a fun birthday, me and the 20 something people with me will probably never return again. Go to Duplex. Go to Marie's crisis. Don't go to Brandy's if you want to be treated nicely.",12,3,
52,Nye L.,"Antioch, CA",312,1,0,1.0,11/14/2017,"This is not an open mic night bar for singers. The waitress & the piano player don't allow other people to sing. First the guy told us to find our sheet music, then the older looking lady w/ the blonde hair asked us if we could sing a different song then our original song. At first we said no but then 5 mins later when we approached the waitress to sing she basically told us we couldn't. To top it off there is a two drink minimum for watered down drinks. I was so disappointed in my experience at this establishment. If you are looking for an open mic night to practice in front of an audience for an up & coming artist don't come here !!!",,,
53,Neha P.,"Manhattan, NY",45,143,201,3.0,4/5/2015,"Good, but not great. Cozy little bar. It was not hard to find seats when we came here on a Thursday evening a little before 9:30, which is when the live music begins. Drinks are reasonably priced at approx $9-10 each (fyi they do have wine). Everyone who sang/played was extremely talented. It's cool that both the waitress and the bartender are also amazing singers and split their time between working and coming up to perform. However, the songs they played were very old and some of them were slow and depressing. No one had heard them/knew the words. The main pianist often asked the audience if they knew the songs, and everyone kept saying no. It was a young crowd mostly in their 20s and 30s. People were putting in tons of requests...but maybe 1% of them were being played. They didn't have the music for even famous pieces like ""seasons of love"" from Rent. The performers made no effort to cater to what the audience wanted to hear. We stayed for 2 hours, but left after because it was just unbearably boring. I have heard so many great things about this place and had walked in with high expectations. Perhaps this was one of their ""off"" nights, but first impressions matter.. and there are plenty of other options in the city.",2,,1

After a reminder that gays are the reason sing along music exists, he belted out the best rendition of Moon River I have ever heard. His soulful voice filled the room and the sardine packed house was silent, for the first time all night. I cried. Go here and expect to be reprimanded if you act up. It's all in good fun. The bathroom will stay pristine, somehow. The drinks are mandatory and tipping is essential. Request your favorite song and he just may play it. Put your damn phone away.

Updated review","I went to Brandy's the other day after Writing Room post-92nd Y Borowtiz talk (beyond amazing). I've been twice since my last review, once in 800 degree heat. It was too hot and crowded. And the music was okay but not as good as it often is. Well, the crew I heard that Tuesday night was the best! I have always enjoyed weeknights more than weekends here. I forgot to take down names, but the server had just returned from Europe (Spain I think) and she has a gig on 2/8. I have to find the name as I seem not to have written it down in my phone. I will make it a point to return more often now that I have fallen in love with Writing Room. Very convenient via subway. 86th and Lex is just a few minutes to 84th between 2nd and 3rd.",5,2,3

58,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",252,505,1,5.0,9/24/2014,"I am not a New Yorker.  If you asked me Monday morning if I would ever really love New York, I would say ""no"".  I've lived in too many cities to realize that New York sucks for a lot of reasons.Then Monday night happens to me and I realize that while New York sucks in so many ways, it also freaking rocks.  Brandy's was my seminal moment...the moment where I realized I need to embrace New York for what it is: a place so full of talented people that my waitress can break into a Cyndi Lauper tune followed by ""all about that bass"".  I shit you not.  Mind you, that doesn't even count the talented guy playing piano who definitely didn't belong in a dive bar late on a Monday night, the awesome new friends that I had just met and had a great dinner at Elios around the corner, and the fact that you wander into a bar at midnight on a Monday and have a great time (can't do that in Philly or DC).Thank you Brandy's for making me realize NYC really is a great place that I probably won't be forever.  I promise from here on out to stop hating (fingers crossed) on NYC.  I am going to try to get back to Brandy's again soon, I suggest you do the same.",6,3,7
59,Jillian C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,68,7,3.0,1/30/2016,"Brandy's can be hit or miss, some of the employees are disgruntled wannabe performers, others are outstanding. In this day in age, there is no reason for them to not have all their music on a tablet. Brandy's is extremely small, not for large groups and you may have to stand for a while before finding a seat. The drinks are watered down and the place isn't very clean, so I stick to bottled beer. Bad $%&ing language is the norm in this hole. This is a residential neighborhood, so the door man/bouncer is aggressive. Brandy's is small and not a cabaret, so don't even think of dancing.  The employees do drink while on the job, so don't be surprised if they appear hammered and sometimes belligerent.  But don't let my review scare you, definitely go check Brandy's out if you haven't already. We've had many a good times and always bring out of towners there for a drink.",2,2,1

After dinner we approached at around 1am only to be attacked by the doorman who raised his voice at our friend who was traveling with his suitcase. He told us very aggressively and rudely that we needed to leave because they could not accommodate luggage. Our gentleman friend, very kindly said, ""well what should I do with it then?"" and the doorman said ""go home with your luggage"". It was very disrespectful and totally out of line the manner to which he was speaking to our group and lost our business. Luckily, Trinity's Pub next door received our business.",3,1,1

Yes, the people who work there can be a bit testy, but I understand being annoyed with yapping people while they are taking the HUGE amounts of effort it takes to sing so beautifully for us.  I am always polite to the servers and singers and they are always so nice to me and my friends.This is such a great place to bring visitors!  I suggest going during the week as it gets crazy crowded on the weekends, but it is still worth it if you have to cram in there.",,,

However after last night, I will NEVER patron this place again. Ever. It was a sleepy wed night around midnight and I walked in with my husband and two friends who I happened to run into on the street and haven't seen in years. We were quite jovial about our reunion and went to Brandys to celebrate. My friend was twirling me around as if in a slight ""dance"" bc he was so happy to see me, and the bartender yelled at us and was SUCH an asshole about their ""no dancing"" policy. He said if he were to see that again he would throw us out. We hadn't even ordered yet! And there was hardly anyone in the place to begin with. My friend then was grooving in place - basically moving his feet while he was talking- NOT dancing, and the bartender took my drink from my hand and threw it out, and told us to ""get the fuck out of his bar"" - he threw all of our drinks away and said how dare we not listen to him. Not once did we actually dance. I was appalled, speechless, and so angry - I have brought countless guests to this place and he treated us like criminals. The waitress also told us to ""get the fuck out"" and called us horrible names. We were there for probably 5 minutes - here were so many better ways to handle it, and they were just mean. Brandys, your staff and your bouncers are horrible and I hope your piano singers find work elsewhere.",21,4,

The bouncer does a great job of crowd control (and he's also a really nice guy!!) so at no point during the night did I really feel like I was in people's way/claustrophobic. I did see a long line outside though (even with it raining tonight) so it would be a good idea to get there towards the earlier part of the night. The live music is spectacular. They play a lot of oldies like Elton John, Carole King, Ray Charles, etc...but then also Lady Gaga and Maroon 5 and my personal favorite from Little Mermaid - Part of Your World. The vibe is great and everyone is the bar is singing along and I just had a really good time.

A few of us stopped in on Friday since it's right across the street from a friends apartment and I had heard good things.  It's a teeny tiny place, but the entertainment was larger than life. I wish I could remember the names of the performers. They took requests all night, played some amazing music and were absolutely hysterical to top things off.  We had a lot of laughs, made some friends and had an overall great time. I will definitely be back. That being said, there are a lot of rules at Brandy's... which is fine. Rules are Rules. I get it. I worked in the service industry, and that brings me to that 1 lonesome star I sadly had to leave off of this review. Our waitress was rather unsavory. Plain old rude and for no reason at all. I guess because she feels she can be since she knows people will always return for the amazing entertainment.  I'm sure she's a nice, fun loving woman in her personal life, and she did a great job shaking her maraca to the music... but we were really put off by the way she treats customers. She was very abrasive and unpleasant. That was the only negative part of the experience.

The piano players, bartenders, and servers all participate and are very talented people. It is a very engaging and energetic atmosphere. They really hit a majority of genres throughout the night including pop, rock, Broadway, country, even Disney tunes, so its pretty much guaranteed that you will be able to sing along to something. There is a limited amount of seats and tables, so its best to get there by 9 pm at the very latest if you want to sit, even a bit earlier on the weekends. There is a 2 two drink minimum per person per set, which really is a great deal considering that there is no cover charge. Bottled beers were about $7-8 with cocktails being about $9-$10.   They have daily happy hour from 4pm-8pm. with the live sets going from 9:30pm-3:30 am. I can't wait to go back to Brandy's!",5,1,3

92,Jimmy R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,5.0,1/20/2014,"I've lived on the UES for 6 months and hadn't heard about this place until this weekend.  Some places label themselves as ""best kept secrets"" or ""hidden gems"", but Brandy's really is both of those things.  It's tucked away between 2nd and 3rd ave on a quiet street, and even if I passed it, I probably wouldn't think that much of it.  If you walked into this place when there was no music, you probably wouldn't think much of it either.  It's tiny and divey.  But go in there at night, when people are performing - and.. wow.  Just wow.  This has got to be the friendliest bar crowd I've ever seen.  It's more like walking into someone's living room and watching the host and some of his/her very talented friends play piano and sing everything from showtunes to 60s/70s to Pink and absolutely everything in between.  We closed it down on a Sunday night and the staff didn't seem to mind as we chatted with them once everyone left - we even got into a brief, but drunken and spirited political discussion with the piano player. Everyone is just super cool and super talented.  I even hung out and chatted with a Broadway conductor for a bit.  They'll also let you go up and sing if you'd like - in fact, they'll encourage it if someone makes a request that the staff doesn't know how to sing.  There were definitely some very talented singers in the crowd - but there were also some drunken ones.  As the night went on, it seemed to descend into karaoke - but all in all - the talented singers outnumbered the drunken ones - and in the end, the piano is loud, the pianist that night sang and would help out when necessary (I kind of assume they do on every night), and the crowd sings along to most songs, so it wasn't a big deal.  Don't let this deter you - the extremely talented staff/singers outnumbered the rest, and it was awesome.If you're looking for a local, friendly, piano bar - then this is your spot.  The crowd is great, the staff is extremely talented, and the vibe is just all around great.Also, some people have labeled this as a ""gay bar"".  I think there's a difference between a gay bar, and a bar where gay people sometimes go.  This is certainly the latter.  Nothing about this place made me feel uncomfortable because I was straight, which I assume is the implication by labeling this place a ""gay bar"".  Just like any bar, there were some gay people and some straight people - but if that bothers you, you should probably question why and promptly leave NYC :)  This is the kind of place that welcomes all - sexual orientation, gender, race, age, etc. are irrelevant.  There were singles and couples, old and young, gay and straight, all there to enjoy this place together - just as it should be!",8,,2
93,Michael P.,"New York, NY",246,250,11,5.0,4/2/2012,"Come here on a weekday because it gets crowded on the weekends and consequently less enjoyable and more annoying.  We came here on a Monday night and it was perfect.  The place is cozy and you are never too far from the upright piano.  My date and I nestled ourselves in a little cozy corner, the host brought us two cold beers, and we sat back and enjoyed the entertainment.  The pianist was also a very talented singer and took us on a journey from showtunes to Bruce Springsteen to Lady Gaga to Disney.  One after another.  He was also willing to take requests from the audience.  The only thing is that they are a bit naggy about asking for tips for the performers.  I guess they got to make a living somehow.  Overall, a surprisingly addition to the Upper East Side nightlife scene that is otherwise populated by fratty sports bars along 2nd Ave.",4,,2

A great place for a small group of friends. The pianist, bartenders, and waitress all sang beautifully and were all very nice. Their adlibs can be hilarious and added to the energy of  place. The guy at the door was a little rude to my friend, but other then that, we had a blast. I have been there a handful of times and it seems like ""Walking in Memphis"" is played every time, so make sure you learn the words if you don't know them already!

Not only did they not allow us to be seated, but they denied ever speaking to her. We were asked to leave and had to do so with 6 guests who had made the trip from all over the tristate area, in vain. It's a pity when poor management takes away from the great atmosphere the place has to offer. Needless to say they just lost 12 paying customers-who are also easy on the eyes, just saying ;-/",11,1,

106,Brad C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,74,1,1.0,6/22/2016,"going going... gone.  It's gone so far downhill in the couple decades that it is kinda heartbreaking. It used to be fun, upbeat, silly, energized, and talented piano player and singers/waiters/bartenders.  The last few times I've been there, the piano player has been painfully bad and unenthusiastic.  Recently, Rick Jensen was playing; awful, bored, sarcastic and boring.  Literally begging for money, mocking the customers and mocking song requests - but not in a funny way.  Frankly, he's not talented enough to be that arrogant.  I'm sure the bartender and waitress' voices would have carried the night but they were too busy chatting to pay attention to customers and never got around to their sets by the time I left. I couldn't take any more of the awful voice of the piano guy, his sarcasm and detached boredom.   Never again.",3,1,

There were people wearing sweats - no dress code I guess. Just nothing classy about the place. I've been to much better piano bars!

108,Diana T.,"Manhattan, NY",6,22,0,4.0,7/20/2013,"I had a blast singing my lungs out at Brandy's last night!  Anyone that loves singing both old and new tunes would enjoy this place.The piano guy can pretty much play any song.  Requests from the crowd are hand-written on napkins (passed to the pianist with a tip, of course).  The tunes he plays are mostly those that everyone knows, and the occasional number sung by the waitress or one of the bartenders is equally fun.  These performers are all supremely talented with their vocals, in a broadway musical-theater type of way.  On top of that, they also kid around with a laid-back sense of humor that gets everyone into it.  One of the bartenders really blew me away with ""Sittin on the dock of the bay"".  Not to mention, Jen the waitress did a split in the middle of the room as she belted out some Cindy Lauper tunes.  The one downside of this place is the extremely cramped space.  We were lucky to get a table, but the tables are tiny and you are squashed against your neighbors on either side of you.  One guy practically had his chair halfway into the ladies' bathroom.  If you have to climb out of your chair to visit the restroom, you've got to do it limb by limb; it's just such a tight squeeze in there.  Also, FYI - there is a two drink minimum at the tables.",4,2,2
109,Jesse And Christy S.,"New York, NY",41,250,20,4.0,5/16/2013,"Came here on a Saturday night around 9:00  as Yelp told me to arrive early to get a table....the show started at 9:30 and when we arrrived at 9 we managed to snag one of the last tables. They have signs all over the place clearly stating that there is NO DANCING and that theres a 2 drink minimum (per act). Since you are getting free live entertainment, $6-7 beers and $8-9 mixed drinks seems like a pretty good deal to me. They don't define ""act"" per se, but our piano player played at least an hour an a half before he took a break, so I assume thats approximately an act.  Anyway, they weren't strick or annoying about the two drink policy so I wasn't turned off by it. It was so crowded that I dont see how they could enforce it anyway....I imagine that theres mostly for slower weeknights.Overall my friends and I had a blast here. The musicians were amazing, the staff had a great sense of humor, and the drinks were strong. Every single one of the staff members comes up to sing a few songs with the piano player and I feel like they all could have won ""The Voice"".....they are that good. If you get a seat I can almost guarantee you'll have a good time. Hasta la vista, Brandy.",6,,2
110,P N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,1/1/2016,"My friend and I just had a horrific time here tonight due to the absolutely rude and unstable redheaded waitress that stormed that place like a tornado. There's a 2 drink minimum to have a table, so when we got our table 10 minutes before the music started, we asked the bouncer and the bartender if we needed to wait for the waitress to arrive to order our 1st of the 2 required drinks and they said no. They said that we could just get the first one from the bar, and it would be fine. Well, clearly the staff need to communicate better about this because as soon as the waitress arrived, she looked at our full glasses of wines and said rudely, ""Just so you know, there's a 2 drink minimum as soon as the music starts"". I explained to the waitress that we were aware of the 2 drink minimum; however, no one told us the clock started as soon as the music began and that both the bartender and the bouncer told us we could get our 1st drink from the bar. She then yelled at me and said, ""So you're just gonna have that ONE drink and then leave?!!"". I couldn't believe her rudeness and her tone. I said, ""No, we're having TWO drinks"". As in, not 3, you idiot. Then, as the show went on, she stormed our path like a tornado several times, slamming empty bottles into the trash can next to us so that they shattered loudly, and was completely unpleasant and weird. In order to be kind, my friend and I decided to help her out and get a 3rd round of drinks anyway even though neither of us wanted to. In spite of doing so, she got my order wrong and brought the wrong drink. When I alerted her of this, she then had the audacity to yell at me, stating that I was the one who made the mistake. That's when my friend and I knew this woman was absolutely out of her mind. Here's an opportunity where we were trying to be nice by ordering a 3rd round even though we only had wanted to order the 2 drink minimum, and she gets the order wrong, and THEN yells at me when I pointed out the error so she could correct it. By this point in the night, my mood went totally foul. I was having a good time, and she killed it. The other customers were also displeased with her as was evident by their mutterings and facial expressions. When we were done with our drinks, my friend and I were SO angry and upset by how this unstable fool ruined our night that we decided not to tip her. And we NEVER do that. That's how bad it was. In fact, she got 50 cents tip because I didn't want to ask that woman to bring us change. We quickly left because she stormed our table as if she knew she was gonna get stiffed, and then she proceeded to follow us out the door and YELL at us down the street that we were not welcome back there! I was so appalled that I walked back in and informed the bouncer of what had just happened. It is completely and totally insane to employ someone like this in a bar in Manhattan. She doesn't deserve to be in the service industry, and she ruined it for her colleagues as well who didn't get a tip because we were so eager to get out of there. This woman brings the whole establishment down, which is a disgrace and a shame because everyone else there seemed welcoming and pleasant. Horrific experience. Great way to start the new year thanks to her.",10,4,2
111,Margaret L.,"New York, NY",145,2,0,3.0,6/7/2015,"Here's the thing. It's a bar with entertainers who aren't on Broadway. They come off as bitter, angst-filled, and irritated when random people come in drunk and disorderly. I feel for the artists. I really do. But, at the end of the day, they're there singing for a bunch of people who want the Broadway experience without paying Broadway prices. So, the attitude and general disaffected nature that's assumed by the performers/wait staff is a little ridiculous. Just sing and be grateful you get the opportunity to do so, or go elsewhere where you'll actually be appreciated for what you do. I used to love Brandy's but now it just makes me sad. Avoid it. Or come armed with lots of cashola to support the starving artists who are also mildly insulting to paying guests.",2,,

116,Heather T.,"Winooski, VT",3,12,5,5.0,4/8/2013,"Surprisingly, there are not a lot of piano bars in NYC.  Coming from Vermont where no piano bars exist to my knowledge, I was really excited to have my pick, but the pickings were slim! Based on the reviews of this little bar, my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. What a find! The bar is tiny and cramped, and you have to get there at a reasonable time to get a good seat, but there is no cover charge and the drinks were pretty good for a cheaper than average NYC price.  The only request they have is that you tip the piano player, and buy at least 2 drinks per set.  The sets are long so I found this to be very reasonable.  It is an old building and a cramped space, with the bathroom being the smallest i've been in in a while, so don't expect a fancy, cleanly  layed out place. Its a bit rough but that adds to the character and charm of it. The waitress and bartenders were very helpful and even sang some fabulous tunes while the pianist played away.  We had a relativity new pianist to the bar, but watching him play was very entertaining and he didn't skip a beat when requests were coming at him from every direction.  There were only a few songs requested that he didn't know (He stated that ""I will learn these! Promise!"")Every genera was covered and no popular song was left unplayed. Everyone sang along and the comradery felt in the place was amazing.  We ended up staying there for pretty much the whole night.  Made some great new friends while we sang and cheered along.  The bar has been there for a long time, and the regulars there are very friendly and supportive of visitors.  We felt very welcomed and had a great time.  Definitely a gem and we will go again on our next visit to NYC. I recommend stopping in and hearing a few tunes at the least! You won't be disappointed.",4,,1
117,Marie L.,"Manhattan, NY",5,421,300,4.0,5/6/2013,"This place is tiny and insanely busy. Come early if you want a table, seat or even to get in. We sat at the bar, and had a great view and tons of fun. The drinks were reasonably priced and we got to sing at the top of our lungs to show tunes, and other bad 70's and 80's pop songs. It was heaven. The place starts to thin out around 2:30 or so. When it thins out, drunk douchy guys from 2nd Avenue come trolling. So creepy. Everyone else we encountered was super nice - even the Jersey moms that we admittedly judged at first glance. People come here to have a good time and it's evident.If you want a quiet bar where you can have conversation, this is not your place. Also, if you're a woman, go to the bathroom before you get here. There's one stall and you have to crawl over the entire room to get to it. Such a pain.Edited, because I remembered the one downside: They have a STRICT no dancing rule. I don't know where it stems from, but I was verbally abused by the bouncer because I had a cramp in my leg and stood up from my bar chair. When I turned to tell my friend what happened, he got in my face, again, and said, ""IS THERE A PROBLEM?"" I said no, and then the bouncer with the Napoleon complex backed off, but it was a strange oddly abrasive encounter.",3,,

It was my birthday and friends were meeting me to celebrate...since the place can fill up quickly and reservations are not accepted I called to see what time my friends and I should arrive, and was told 8:30. Around 9:30 when the waitress service began...the waitress with the last name Pace started yelling at my friends to move over...even though she was being rude and downright Bitchy they did as she asked them. After everyone moved to the seats Pace requested she said very nastily ""I'm telling u all right now there is a two drink minimum and don't ask me for separate checks"".  I was appalled..the many times I have been to Brandys in the past there was never an issue with separate checks, and my friends and I all knew about the drink minimum..nor did we have an issue with it...as most of us already had two drinks while waiting and were looking forward to drinking more once the music started.  The waitress from hell then began to scream and yell about how Brandys does not serve parties larger than six...however, the place usually fills up ...what's the difference if it's filled with people who know each other ?The horrifying waitress then went on to yell at us to leave...saying she's expecting a party of 9. Wtf??? We have to leave to accommodate a party of 9 in an establishment that does not take reservations?  And how are they accommodating a party of 9 if they don't accommodate parties larger then six??After this final egregious insanity I rounded up my friends and headed out. On the way out I told the ugly bartender with glasses that they just lost a ton of money with us walking out and he said ""oh well. Bye"".  My friends and I ended up right up the block at Dorians...where we were treated the ways customers should be treated!!!!!!!! And Dorians even has a back room where we danced into the early morning hours. My aunt left Dorians around midnight ...and had to pass Brandy's on her way home. While walking by my aunt saw a group if women yelling at the waitress..livid at how they were treated. So this awful treatment was not an isolated incident apparently. The gentleman who works the door apologized to my aunt for the waitresses behavior and our treatment.   Some of my friends also passed Brandys on their way home and were recognized by gentleman working the door. He apologized to them for the way they were treated earlier by the wackjob waitress. I'm sad to say that I will no longer go to Brandy's after this incident...not after the way I was treated.  Sadly, this once awesome establishment will now lose tons of business.",15,2,1

Sad because the performers are so talented and so great that you wish they were performing under the lime light as they deserve to be. And the only thing more ironic than incredibly talented performers waiting and bar tending in a dive bar are the occasional UES douche bags who are too dumb to look up from their phones or conversations to realize that they have just stumbled into one of the only real places left in the neighborhood.

Cons:  The waitresses usually like to remind you that its a two drink minimum per person at the tables,  OK we get it, I will order from you, after I finish the drink that I just bought at the bar, while I was waiting for a table to open up...Otherwise, once you get past that, its a fun and great time.  The bartender busts out the tamborine and while the other one is belting out a tune, and a good time is had by all.",4,,1

The seating is THAT CLOSE.There is a bowl full of bagged Lays and Cheese Its--I'm a sucker for old school lunch box favs--and the watermelon margarita is made out of freshly cut watermelon.

Everyone has a story of the time the bartender lost his cool, a waitress screamed and yelled for no reason, it's widely entertaining and sometimes NYC'ers go to Brandy's and bet the over/under of ""how long until the staff makes fun of a patron or loses the bar business"".  Not well managed and the bar loses a lot of business due to the staff, but if your willing to take the constant rudeness and cult like staff, then by all means look past it, have a beer, and sing a song....Pro: nice doorman, live music. Con: inside staff.",4,2,

133,John C.,"New Haven, CT",4,64,8,5.0,7/29/2014,If you love New York for its unique charm and are looking for something away from the hustle and bustle of all those tourist traps; then make your way to Brandy's in the Upper East Side. I had the pleasure of living in the Upper East Side and visiting this bar on many nights. Its not upscale by any means and if anything its aged over time.  I love this place for one simple reason..the lively characters who play the piano. Again I remind you this is a piano bar. I don't come here for high end drinks or for fancy wait services. Often there is only one waitress for the whole place and one bar tender. Take in the moment and enjoy the place for what it is. If you're in NYC make this a place to visit. They have people on the Piano EVERY NIGHT till 1am or later. You can't get this any where else in the world.,2,,1

136,Jessica M.,"New York, NY",5,73,5,1.0,8/15/2011,"I thought this would be my favorite piano bar.Not anymore.Let me caution you: This place is actually criminal.  I went on Friday night to celebrate a milestone, and the entire night was ruined by the out-of-control waitress.It started when she wouldn't let us move a chair.  Ok..not a huge deal... It then progressed to her not letting us use 2 separate credit cards. There were six of us.  She said we HAD to put everything on ONE credit card all night.  Um, alright....She then got up to sing (multiple times) and yelled at my friends for texting while she was singing, and not paying attention.  OK, it's a bar, not a Broadway theatre.  I understand that you're singing right now, but we're at a noisy piano bar. People sing along or talk or text or whatever. It happens.My friend went to the bathroom and she went in and yelled at her, making snide remarks about her appearance.  What?At this point, we just wanted to get out. The criminal part? She then double-charged us. We actually had to find and corral the other bartender (Gregg, who was VERY nice and professional) to help us sort it out, because she became belligerent when we tried to tell her that she double-charged us. Gregg said she must be having a bad night. In the middle of our conversation with Gregg, I heard a CRASH behind me.  She had THROWN A WOMAN DOWN TO THE FLOOR for standing in her spot at the bar!  ?!?!?! A further note about the double-charge:  I went to Brandy's last year.  This waitress was there, then, too.  She was abrasive but relatively harmless and we had a nice night.  The next day, though, my credit card company called me to ask if someone had stolen my card -- that's how high the charge was.  I thought it was odd, but I had bought drinks for my friends and wasn't paying attention to money.  I'm willing to bet that she double-charged us then, too, but we didn't catch it.Brandy's is a cute place, and it could be really fun.  The pianist is talented and Gregg is a great bartender.  But if you see this waitress, I encourage you stay away from her, to take a really close look at your bill, or to skip this place for the night.",24,8,1

(wtf?)- the door barely closes so it's freezing at the bar! Everyone inside was wearing their coat- it took over 15 minutes to get our 1st drink (the warm wine) - there was a non-drinker with us and we never managed to get a second round!

It filled in as the night wore on, but it was great that it wasn't packed to the brim and we were able to joke back and forth with the piano player and singers. It's fun that your waitress is also one of the performers. The atmosphere was really laid back and welcoming.

There are so many mixed reviews about this place, so i'm gonna give it to you straight.Yes this is a tiny ancient bar with a piano with one microphone and low quality speakers. Yes you feel like you went in a time machine back to the 1800 when you are here.Yes, unfortunate time didn't stop for some of the patrons that are here and you will be amongst an older generation.Yes the bartenders that sing think they are full of themselves, including the regular pianist who will try to solicit dollars from you.Yes there are only specific hours they will play the piano, and the times when it is off, the bar is absolutely boring and not worth paying the higher UES alcohol  prices.Yes you will see washed-up ex-Broadway stars trying to relive their glory days.Yes you can request a song and even sing it in front of an adoring crowd ( be prepared to make a song donation).Yes the people the performers are rough around the edges and will easily offend you for pure entertainment purposes.But that's the fun of it! If your looking for something different and sick of the frat bar coalition, give this place a try. Keep an open mind, try some brandy, and realize that some of the party-goers here have been doing this the time you were in diapers.Find another Piano Bar that has nightly live music in the UES and I will applaud you (but please do inform me)!I'm not afraid to say that this is one of my favorite non-speakeasy bars in the city.",8,1,2
147,Nick K.,"San Francisco, CA",473,639,61,4.0,7/10/2009,"Brandy's is a mini piano bar on the Upper East Side. It is a hidden gem. It is some of the most fun I've had on a Sunday night in New York.A few great things about this place:- Intimate live music. The pianist, bartenders and even you sing- A nice break from the fist-pumping Journey/Bon Jovi scene on the UES- Pianist takes requests, even odd ones like some obscure David Bowie songs- Friendly barkeeps and nice, mixed, albeit older clientele- Stiff drinks and semi-reasonable pricesThe only real downside to Brandy's is that it is miniature. Good luck getting a seat at prime time on a Friday or Saturday night. Otherwise you can stand at the bar or squeeze into a corner. But the coziness is what makes it great. Wherever you are in the bar, you are an arm's reach from the pianist. Very fun.",4,,2

The reason I give it 4 stars is because the last few times we went there has been a waitress who was awful. She took forever to get our drinks and was completely rude. She actually shushed some of the people around us. I get that there is a piano player but it's still a bar and people to go to socialize. She would randomly play the maracas and was really bad and distracting, and basically told us we better leave a good tip. When I say everyone had a problem with her, I mean that we talked to people at the other tables and they all thought she was rude.",,,
149,Julia W.,"Medford, MA",39,133,2,5.0,11/6/2009,"Forget one of the best places in the UES, try the island of Manhattan. No joke, most fun I've had in awhile here. I'm just upset that I have never wandered into here until just a few weeks ago when I've lived nearby for over 2 years. Is it a gay bar? - No. I wouldn't go that far. Are the bartenders and piano man gay? - Yes. And they are amazing. I went here with my heterosexual boyfriend on a whim and we had a total blast. We managed to snag seats at the bar and enjoyed an hour plus of the greatest singalongs ever. I honestly felt like I was a part of something and it was a total blast. The bartenders and cocktail waitress were all singers too, and they freely and frequently used various instruments (i.e. cowbell (yes!), tambourines, chimes), sang the harmony part and grabbed the mic to perform a number. They were also happy to do and encouraged requests and did a great variety of songs. Believe when everyone says it is very small and gets cramped. It very much is and does. So the closer you get there to 9PM when the set starts, the better off you are. But even if you don't get a seat, I would imagine it is still fun. The drinks are a little expensive too, but you don't pay a cover to get into the place so I considered it a fair trade. The bartenders are so nice and friendly too! As far as the crowd goes - Yes, it is older, but why does that matter if they're all having a great time? Us youngings just haven't figured out that this is a much better spot in the UES than mediocre (at best) sports bars filled with douchey ya dudes.",1,,1
150,T K.,"New York, NY",13,108,0,2.0,8/29/2011,"I discovered Brandy's years ago when living across the street from it.  I loved the vibe and it was always filled with fun loving, happy people.  These people always enjoyed the music and the talent here.  When someone sang, you would listen, and actually be able to hear the performers.Unfortunately the last couple of years more and more people have showed up to just go and talk.  It's v. hard to hear anyone sing for the most part.  Nothing wrong with singing along mind, but having a conversation OVER the singers is a different story.  If you want to go talk to someone, a piano bar isn't really the place for it.  Lord knows there are plenty of sports bars on the UES...The main reason that I'm writing this now is that I was so very disappointed by the new piano player this weekend.  I've seen many talented performers come and go, and I have enjoyed nearly all of them.  However, the piano player that was replacing one of the fabulous piano players that was let go was well  below all others.  I thought ok, perhaps he's completely brilliant so I'll give him a try.  But nope, he started playing and whilst technically yes he can play and sing, he 1) played songs that belong in a hotel lobby bar, not a piano bar where people come to have fun, and 2) he lacks personality in a huge way.  He has no showmanship about him.  I was beyond disappointed and I have to say that whilst I will go back on a different night, it won't be when he's playing.  I miss the other pianist as he was so talented and had such a great personality and was always fun.The owner really made a huge mistake with changing the piano player.  Shame!!!",2,,

The bar is well stocked and the people there are incredibly welcoming and fun.On Monday nights, Nate Buccieri graces the piano with a very large arsenal of crowd-pleasing pieces from the classics like Elton John's early work to Lady Gaga's chart-toppers. Jennifer Pace, between bringing delicious drinks to your table and conversing with the regulars, will get up and sing with a pleasantly surprising air. Joe Ardizzone is a sociable bartender with a tremendous talent on the mic.**ADDENDUM: And ladies (or gentlemen, if it's your thing), this piano bar is also a part-time home of one of New York's best kept secrets: Justin Lopez.

You'll see what I'm talking about.**I am definitely going to continue frequenting this place, especially on Mondays.

I have been here once before, and if I had been writing this review after that experience, five stars would have been an easy choice. However, tonight is not that night.Our waitress was the rudest, most incompetent person I have encountered in some time. After very clearly being asked to be kept separate from the rest of the people we were with, our waitress gave us an $175 tab (3 of us having 8 drinks), and told me to basically fuck off and get money from the rest of our table when I said (and this is verbatim): excuse me miss, we only had 8 drinks and asked to be kept on a separate tab from the beginning. A few other gems from our experience with this awful woman:one of the members of our party had recently become pregnant and just asked for tap water, and was charged $3.50. Granted there is a two drink minimum per person, but her boyfriend had at least 5 drinks by himself. But hey, apparently our waitress supports birth defects.early in the night our waitress brought us free shots (watered down of course) and said they were on her, however, when the check came, we were charged for these pathetic things called ""shots""after having ordered vodka sodas for the entire night, we started receiving vodka tonics, and needed to send them back. this didn't happen once, nor did it happen twice: it happened four times.Let's just sum everything up here: Brandy's PIANO bar is great. the piano part at least; the entertainment. The multiple gay bartenders are incredibly talented and nice (in fact, he was the one who corrected our bar tab mistake). The self-proclaimed JAP waitress (her initials ironically and aptly spell out the word) was abysmal, rude, and made a huge fool out of herself.

The sets include a blend of oldies, classic rock, pop, and show tunes. The piano player is always open to audience requests. I also love the fact that each of the bartenders and the waitress perform their own brief sets. The talent of the staff is incredible! This is all made better by the sing-along environment. Overall, this place is always a great time. If you want a seat, make sure you arrive by 10 on normal weekends.

168,Tiffany Y.,"San Francisco, CA",326,373,58,4.0,10/3/2010,"We decided to check this place out because my friend had heard about it.  The place is described as a whole in the wall, partly because its tiny with a huge black door--you wouldn't even really know what was going on there unless you knew the place.There was no doorman, but when we opened the door, the place was packed with people.  We stood by the door for a bit because there wasn't really anywhere to move.  After awhile, we moved closer to the live pianist/singer.  Then we managed to get some seats!  I requested a song and my friends and I stayed there until about 2am.The bartender/waitress also sing and the pianist is also an amazing singer.  I was quite impressed and had a blast belting to some of my favorite oldies and ""newies.""    The people who frequent this bar are older (late 20s/early 30s)... but as the night gets later, the crowd gets younger.  The one thing that struck was that most of the people seemed really friendly--and what better way to meet some new people than over a shared interest in music.We went in not knowing to expect, but I'm a big fan of people who can sing well and a friendly atmosphere.  I'm giving it 4 stars because its a place that had to grow on you since you'd be surprised by how crowded it is.",2,,1

Kyle the bartender made a nasty comment to my sister about her tip even though she wasn't even finished ordering and was still collecting money.

There was no need to be because this place is awesome! The talented piano man, and servers and bartenders keep the crowd entertained and singing along. The only downside is the space. There isn't much of it. When I first got there, the place was crowded and it was standing room only, except there was really no place to stand without being in someones way. We got a table shortly thereafter, and crawling over the chairs to get in and out of the booth was awful.",2,2,2
173,jennie l.,"Flushing, NY",1,5,0,5.0,2/7/2014,"This piano bar is perhaps the single greatest discovery since Columbus found the new world. The typical New York bar scene consists of pounding drinks whilst raging to some overplayed top 40 hits on Pandora. Brandys however combines live music, sing a longs, and the best crowd in town.

175,JC W.,"New York, NY",4,30,3,1.0,4/19/2010,"Do not waist your time... This is not a ""piano bar"" in the true sense... Yes, there is a piano, and yes, the piano player sings along while he plays, and yes, the bartender and waitress get to sing as well... so it is more like a performance space for the three of them.  If you are into watching them sing, good for you, but I arrived thinking it was a real piano bar, where one could request a song and sing it themselves!  Nope, not so.  If you are looking for a real piano bar and or a karaoke joint, I wouldn't go here.  Head to Don't Tell Mama or Maries Crisis for that.  If you want to see some nice performances by the staff, then this is your joint.  I have no complaints about the quality of performances, just the idea that they bill themselves as a piano bar and they don't quite know how to do that.",3,,
176,Perez E.,"New York, NY",3,66,5,2.0,3/26/2014,Went to this place at the recommendation of a friend who lives in the area.  She raved about it.  So we joined her on a Tuesday evening only to be disappointed by a standoffish pianist.  Not so good for a first impression.  Nothing special.  Could've had a better time elsewhere.,3,,

178,Juliet A.,"Washington, DC",420,1039,974,4.0,9/14/2008,"Um...I had NO IDEA that this was a gay bar. hahaha. I love Brandy's! Good drinks, good songs, good times. The staff is so talented and knows how to please the crowd, keeping them happy and keeping the drinks flowing.  Four and not five stars for the following two reasons:1) It is jam-packed like none other (but that also speaks to how many people love coming here). You will most likely be standing, squished like a sardine, for at least an hour until a table opens up. And if and when one does, be prepared to fight to the death for it. 2) We had a REALLY rude bartender who gave awful service and was complaining that we were just ""standing near the bar""...when there clearly was nowhere else we could physically move (see complaint #1 above)Despite those two drawbacks, Brandy's is still a good time. If you only venture to the UES once, make sure a visit to Brandy's is on your list of places to hit. Go pop in and belt out a few classics along with the piano player.",,1,

That night's ""piano man"" was so talented - singing, playing the piano and even using this lightbulb with a cord (so 1980s!) to create ""lighting effects"" during particular songs.It's a really fun place, drinks aren't too pricey and the crowd is always really eclectic.

183,Samantha B.,"Manhattan, NY",34,42,5,3.0,10/25/2012,"I live right across the street from Brandy's so I decided to check it out with a couple of my girl friends...LOVED the live music and was so much fun.. however, the only reason why I am giving it a 3 star review is for a few reasons. The woman there who is I guess the waitress for the entire bar is RIDICULOUS.. I think her name was Jennifer. HORRIBLE and really has turned me off from going back into this place sooner... She was very rude. * Let me start from the beginning... Two of my girlfriends and I decided to stop by and see what Brandy's was all about... we walked in to a very crowded very small piano bar (but that is what gives it that little flare and fun! ) So we squeeze in (the bar is 3/4 people deep) but we had been drinking beforehand and werent in a rush to get a drink. immediately Jennifer the HAWK swoops in and asks us what we would like to drink... I asked for one drink that me and my friend would drink for now until we were able to get a seat, and/or restore our balance from the few drinks before..  Jennifer snapped back with-- ""no, you must all get a drink""  (Meanwhile, my boyfriend just tagged along with us for a few minutes and wanted go to back to the apartment-- He HAD to get a drink) As we all were trying not to spill our drinks because it was so packed we finally were able to get a seat... when then Jennifer let us know-- we MUST HAVE TWO drinks if we want to sit at a table. (SERIOUSLY?)  we nodded, honestly thinking to ourselves, we will just leave before we are forced to have a second drink-- when one was already too much. We then met a very kind man and his family who were enjoying the live music, who bought us around of drinks.. so I guess that counted as our second drink and we didnt have to sneak out.. We were then finally allowed to enjoy the music. From that point on the night was great ! I do have a few of the songs on video-- and the men really arent great singers at all.. but with far too many drinks and singing along with them.. they were GREAT.  Throughout the night, the one and only Jennifer was running around with a maraca and the woman who we met asked to see it.. Jennifer responded NO. She just isnt nice. and it doesnt look good for Brandy's...Finally around 3 or 4am we left and went to a diner to soak up the alcohol. All in all it was a fun time minus Jenniferrrrrr..",,1,
184,Ellen T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,4.0,1/18/2013,"Was there with friends last night, and had a blast. The waitress and the bartender are accomplished singers (I gather they were - or still are - in Broadway), as is the pianist. I also love the ambiance - rustic and intimate. It's easily packed, so it's probably best to come a little early, although - unfortunately - they don't serve food. And that's the small drawback for me. Will definitely come here again (a friend has planned to come back the next day, lol).Oh, and also I noticed we were the only non-white people among the crowd (we're Asians). No discrimination at all, but it's interesting. Probably just a coincidence.",,,

186,Mark S.,"San Francisco, CA",24,241,18,4.0,2/23/2010,"Having previously dined nearby, I was looking for something fun and upbeat in the UES area. Fortunately I did my research beforehand and found the glowing reviews of Brandy's because the host of the restaurant I was previously at divulged that they never hang out on the UES and always go to the LES (which is where I admittedly frequent as well).We arrived just after 9:30PM on a Friday night and snagged a table. I was actually a bit surprised as there were quite a few tables available, but not for long... The show kicked off about quarter 'til and the people soon thereafter started pouring in. I was still tripping over bodies when we ultimately made our departure. The pianist was great; very fun and lively. And our waitress/singer, Anne, was awesome. When we asked about a special drink my friend's Aunt used to drink (known as the Leg Spreader), she got a puzzled look but said that if we know the ingredients, then the bar will make it.* With ingredients eventually in hand, we proceeded to drink, be merry and occasionally sing along to all the awesome tunes that were being played. And they do take requests; don't be shy.Looking for something a bit different, but lots of fun on the UES? Whether it's with a group of friends or just two of you, you can't really beat Brandy's.*Leg Spreader: grand marnier, courvoisier, hot water and a twist of lemon all served in a snifter glass.",1,,

191,Jessica E.,"Austin, TX",11,227,110,5.0,11/6/2013,"Awesome bar! The pianist was pretty late which worked out for us since a lot of people got up and left which allowed our group of friends to snag a table.  This place is perfect for someone who enjoys a divey atmosphere and even a plus if you like musicals. No cover. Drinks are reasonably priced considering the entertainment provided.  The music played ranged from Elton John, Billy Joel, Journey, Jewel, Alanis Morrisette, Beatles and so much more. The pianist is extremely talented in playing and singing as well. A lot of the staff would grab the mic and sing a few tunes too. Sometimes people from the crowd would also get up and sing.  I heard more talent in that little bar than I have a had in a long while. For an impromptu situation, I was truly impressed.  The staff does a great job in involving the audience as well.  This is labeled as a gay bar in my travel book.

197,Michael K.,"Houston, TX",41,146,0,5.0,5/29/2007,"The best bar I've seen on the Upper East Side.  So understated too.  Walking in the frigid winter cold, I look in the window, and see nothing but warmth and a good time.  I step inside.  I get immediate welcomes from patrons and bartenders.  It gets a little crowded though.  Well, a lot crowded.  You'd be lucky to have a seat at the bar, and sitting at the tables takes nothing short of divine intervention.  And speaking of divine, there's the bartenders.  Between serving it up for a room full of picky gay men and their fickle women-friends, they all manage to have a go at the mic and impress us all.  Most of the time, though, the pianist does the singing and takes requests for tips, so bring some extra cash if you wanna hear your favorites.As far as gay bars go, this is definitely not a typical one.  Come with a date or alone, but don't expect to just pick someone up.  Brandy's also attracts quite a bit of straights as well, which really adds to the friendly community atmosphere.  Different singers come on each night during the week (except Mondays, their off-night), so try them all and pick your favorites!  Personally, I prefer the Saturday night crowd.  Finally, I have to also suggest Brandy's for their happy hour, before 9:30.  It's much quieter, drinks are cheap, and it's much easier to get to know the bartender and people around you.  Sunday is bingo night, woo!",4,,1
198,Aprille M.,"Warren, NJ",26,17,0,2.0,8/10/2013,"One caution: the waitress! rude as ever. All I wanted after an incredibly stressful week was to go to this piano bar, sing along to some familiar tunes, and get a cocktail... In all fairness, the bartender's chocolate martinis were good (not strong though & very pricey) and the piano guy really was talented and fun. After feeling good, my bf tipped the piano guy very well and I was going to give the waitress a 20% tip, but I needed change first. When I asked her for change, she said really loudly ""Really?!"" and then made a snide remark to the bartender. Then she gave us change and said ""you know, we don't charge cover you know!!!"" as if we were being cheap. My bf gave her the 20% tip, (actually even more than that, I think he gave her out of haste $10 for only a $30 bill! just so we could get out of there fast without the hassle) which I personally wanted to give her nothing after that... You know, as we were walking out, I said to my bf that the bar was fun but the waitress would make me NEVER to go back there again. She even forced us to get more drinks than the 2 drink minimum because she said the drinks we ordered from the bar & brought ourselves to the table didn't count! You know, all I wanted was to destress & a good night was tainted by a bad waitress! after reading the other reviews on Yelp, it looks like this place should really consider getting new wait staff to replace rude help that is driving people away from this piano bar!",1,,
199,David S.,"San Diego, CA",304,652,282,3.0,9/28/2008,"Is this really a gay bar? I never would have guessed had my friends not told me. And after seeing it for myself, I'm still not sure if I believe them. The crowd was very mixed: lots of (seemingly straight) girls, and the guys did not seem particularly gay either.A better way to describe it is as a piano bar. They have a piano in the middle of the bar, and some dude spends the night playing/singing famous tunes... if you're bold (and talented) you can give it a shot yourself, but beware: this isn't crappy drunken k-town karaoke, we're talking professionals here. It reminded me a bit of Martuni's in SF (but Martuni's is much snootier... this was a lot more relaxed).The bar was packed at around 2am, which I did not know was possible on the UES. Friendly and animated crowd: good times can definitely be had if you're into that kind of venue (which isn't really the case with me).",3,,3
