0,Kyler T.,"Lynchburg, VA",194,26,10,4.0,6/28/2018,"I love Ted's! Coming here is always something I look forward to. The atmosphere is probably my favorite part. The tile floors, the bison on the wall, paper straws, and vintage soap make this something I treasure. I am also a big follower of Ted Turner, so I enjoy hearing about him from the servers (if they remember to tell you). Sometimes the servers don't mention it at all, leaving people wondering who Ted is and why there are bison on the wall and the menu. The burgers are incredible, and though the recommend bison I prefer not to order it. I like the fatty flavor that isn't always included with bison burgers and steaks. Food prices are not reasonable, but I think it's expected for a steakhouse. Give it a shot - go back in time and dine like Ted!",1,,
1,Joe M.,"Madison, NJ",0,16,108,3.0,8/27/2018,Ted's Montana Grill is a fine place to dine if your standards are low. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive however the Buffalo Steak  struggles to please as they are tough and the cook staff lack the knowledge to prepare them correctly. I like Ted have a large ranch in New Mexico and the buffalo steaks could be prepared in a more comprehensive manner.Prices are fair for the NYC market so if your looking for a reasonable priced steak dinner this place will do!!,,,
2,Philippe L.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Canada",20,50,0,3.0,7/14/2018,"Your middle of the road steakhouse although they are heavy on the leaner bison option.  Seems like 51st street has a few steakhouses option, this one probably has the most varied menu but might also be the most accessible price-wise.  I got there fairly late in the evening so service was rather quick, food was average: meat was perhaps not of steakhouse quality?Bring your own ambiance, this place feels a bit like a morgue.",1,,
3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1550,4.0,3/30/2018,"Ted's Montana is a steakhouse, but at lunch there's a serious focus on burgers. I came here for a work lunch (with a large party reservation made just minutes before arriving) and everything ran smoothly. Our table was set up, our waiter took good care of us, everyone left happy and very full.Do the burgers live up to their ~$20 price tags? I can't comment on the signature bison burger, as I had a turkey burger ($18) at the suggestion of our enthusiastic waiter. It was indeed peppery as promised, from both the pepper mixed into the patty and the arugula piled on top. The sriracha aioli combined with the pepper jack added a touch too much spice, or maybe the former was just applied too generously. The patty was super tender and flavorful though.My side salad of kale was good, though overdressed; the fries I tried were average. The ambiance is nice and surprisingly quiet for Rockefeller Center. Clean and beautiful bathrooms, with powder (?) soap. Again, good service, though a touch relaxed on the back end. The lunch ran about an hour and a half start to finish but I would imagine that's largely because we were a group of 15.Very solid pick in Midtown, though at a price.",2,,1
4,Greg F.,"Miami, FL",0,19,39,3.0,10/19/2018,"Went there on a friday around 5... it wasn't busy at first then started filling up towards the middle of our meal.  It took about 20 min for the guy to take our order, then a long time to get the food.  I got the bison bacon cheese burger, it was ok and the rest of my party wasn't really blown away by their food.  Overall it was ok and the are a lot of other places that are better quality for the money.",,,
5,Martin F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,2.0,11/18/2018,Asparagus tips were crunchy as in burnt. Steak Delmonico over cooked. I would have preferred a refill of my water glass instead of drinking out of my wife's glass.,,,
6,Charlie D.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/30/2018,"This was serendipity. I was looking for a decent burger and what I experienced exceeded that. The Creek Burger with blue cheese was very good. Yet the service from the hostess Melissa was the onset of great service with a warm welcome and consideration. The best part of the meal was the outstanding service by my waitress Melissa R. She was what inspired me to 5 stars for the review. She was attentive, knowledgeable and charming. The Best!!!",,,
7,George C.,"Morristown, NJ",0,27,0,2.0,7/14/2018,Disappointing.  I used to go to the location in Aurora Colorado and always had a positive experience.  Tonight I took my daughter to the NYC location and the only thing more disappointing than the bartender trying to pull a fast one on me and sub my favorite gin for some garbage (which I immediately flagged) was the waiter constantly looking at his phone and ignoring us...,2,,
8,Victoria K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,11,3,4.0,8/28/2018,"We often go to Ted's bar after work or have departure parties. I love the place, but they have hard time serving to larger parties. We often have to look for and call a server for more drinks.",,,
9,Chris G.,"Staten Island, NY",3,36,4,5.0,8/5/2018,Very cool place.   First time eating Bison.  The burger I had (with the fried egg on it) was delicious.  Decent value for the money for NYC.  Highly recommend!,,,

11,Kyle P.,"New York, NY",337,48,5,4.0,3/10/2018,"Why so many fussy reviews of Ted's? Our server was brilliant. Drinks were spot on. Huckleberry Jalapeño Marg was excruciatingly well made. Like I can never come close to creating at home. And the Manhattan was great, too. Bison burger tasty, if a bit $$. Still. I'd hear back. Also, bison short ribs - brilliant. As was the bison meatloaf. All the sides are well done and can be swapped out. This is an extremely convenient location and we should have come here years ago. Also, the Friday night bar scene was hopping, if that is your thing.",,,
12,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,79,4,2.0,11/27/2017,"I have eaten at Ted's more than half a dozen times since my friend Fred first recommended it. It's relatively near my work, and I like bison, beef and the american theme. It's a meat eater's venue-grill.In the past, I have usually had the bison rib eye.While not a huge piece of meat, it's always been very flavorful and good. On several occasions though, I've had the bison burger.  I enjoy sitting at the bar, though occasionally I'll take a table or booth if I am with a friend. Casual, relatively quiet, good service and quite a lot of space.But now I must write my last experiences -yes, the last couple. I think something has changed and, to my mind, they are taking it out on the meat. Unless my last two visits were together an anomaly -and one shared by my companions, the staple is not as good as it was or ought to be. And, of course, and in the end, that's all that matters here.I had the rib eye about two months ago. It was a tab skinnier than ever before. And perhaps I'd have let that go -I have until now-  but it meant that it did not come to the table as medium rare. So it was a smaller cut and not cooked to order. Ah well. That however pales in comparison to my last visit, two days ago. I had the bison burger as 'Avalon.' It showed up on my plate as a thin puddly bit of meat  under gruyere, bleu cheese, garlic aoli and some greens. I looked forward to the cheeses and aoli; and I was aware it would make it somewhat oilier. But you needed a burger that could stand up to those toppings or condiments. This was just a small dark pool of meat -not well pressed together, and less than a fifth of a pound. You had to hunt! The meat was so thin that, like it's older brother the rib eye of some months back, it did not come to the table cooked to order. Not a bit of pink. Neither I nor my wife could taste the burger meat in any case.So Ted's gets a two-star rating, based upon my earlier prior happy memories. I hope to raise it up again. I know I'll visit -though perhaps I'll wait long enough that the kitchen is back in order. If it gets back to old form, I'll raise my rating by two stars. If I end up with something similar to the last two experiences, I'll demote it and send Ted to detention. I surely hope it gets back to being man's meal, with some tasty bison.",3,,1
13,Joseph F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",26,46,164,5.0,12/10/2017,I was here back on October 28'th on a rainy Sunday afternoon. I was highly impressed with the food and service. It was really slow since it was rainy that day. I sat at the bar and had a couple pints and a Budweiser in a bottle and both beers were nice and cold and reasonably priced. Their happy hour is from 3 to 6 or 7 if I remember correctly 7 days a week. I had the 14oz Delmonico Ribeye. I asked for it medium rare and that's exactly how the chef cooked it. I liked how you can see them behind the bar cooking your steak right in front of you. The African Amercian man who was working the grill that afternoon was very friendly and takes great pride in his food. He made sure I was nothing but happy. My sides were green beans and fries which was also delicious as well!This is the only reasonably priced steakhouse in Manhattan in my opinion and I will definitely be back! Keep up the good work!,1,,
14,Jenn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,286,0,2.0,4/13/2017,"I've been here a couple of times, tonight I met some friends for drinks and food at the bar. When we got there, a large party had just left, so the waiter came over and cleared off our table and gave us menus. Then he disappeared.  We arrived around 6:40, plenty of time to order by the time happy hour was over.  When the waiter didn't return and it was getting close to 7, my friend went over to the bar and placed a drink order.  The waiter suddenly reappeared, and I asked if I could place a food order.  He directed me to the bar, since we'd already started ordering there.  I don't understand why he couldn't just take the rest of our order, did we offend him so badly? So I go and wait at the bar (it was a little busy) until a bartender served me, and I asked ""Can I place a food order here for that table?""  He turned around and told the waiter that I wanted to order. The waiter essentially blew me off with an attitude, saying we'd already ordered drinks at the bar, so as far as he was concerned we weren't his table anymore. The bartender caught an attitude, made a show of taking my order. When the food came, a cook delivered it (not a server).  He didn't give us silverware, and a different server gave it to us. Our original waiter came back with ketchup nobody asked for, and then disappeared again. No drink refills, no ""how's the food"", nothing. I went back to the bar, since it was obvious we weren't getting service, and settled the bill there.Y'know, if you're going to ignore your customers, you're not going to have customers for very long. I won't be back.",8,,
15,David T.,"Boulder, CO",11,230,2,4.0,10/26/2017,The Teds in Boulder is better.The food is quite good. But they were out of baked potatoes. How do you run out of baked potatoes at 7:00 when the place is basically empty?The service is slow and you don't see them much. But they are pleasant.Ruth's Chris' is 100 feet further down the street - go there.,1,,
16,Brian J.,"Washington, DC",148,4,0,5.0,7/9/2018,It was a slow night. The options for me this evening were bison burger or meatloaf. The server suggested the burger would be a fresher choice. Burger fries arrived quickly and cooked to specification. Not overly expensive. I enjoyed Ted's and would definitely recommend.,,,
17,John D.,"Bronx, NY",11,91,7,4.0,5/25/2017,"Interesting mix of folk here, as in most midtown, near-times square-establishments. There were either tourists, or nearby building business employees on client lunches here. I was the latter. Apparently Ted Turner is the owner of this restaurant, and there's a couple of them, I think in the Midwest.The Uptown Manhattan cocktail was an interesting, bold, tasty drink. Strong too, with bourbon and bitters I believe. Highly recommend. I had a few of those. The nachos are very hearty, with beef that has a chili flavor on top and cheese. The chips taste pretty fresh. The potato chips are good as well, slightly chewy and thin but overall nice crunch. I ordered a bison burger with fried egg. The bison was very hearty and tasty. Ordered it medium, as was suggested to me by the waitress since I don't know how bison is usually best enjoyed. Brioche bun complimented the bison well. Nice ambiance of rustic and ranch decor, made me feel like I was on Ted Turners ranch and they just wrangled the bison that was now on my plate. Prices were reasonable for a steakhouse, think ~$22 for the bison burger. If I have the extra bread, I'd come back on my own dollar another time or if I wanted a good, hearty burger, or to be reminded what Montana is like",,,
18,Jeff W.,"Dublin, CA",3,61,41,4.0,5/1/2018,"O.M.G.  Great restaurant- just needed more staff as it was so busy during mid-week. Our first trip to New York. Didn't research or plan any restaurants ahead of time. Found this place on Yelp very close to our hotel. Had good reviews so reserved a table for 10. We were greeted promptly and seated. It was a busy weeknight. It took a while to take our drink order, and a little longer for the food order. We were kind of hangry but had good company, so that helped. We each ordered different kinds of steaks - New York, filet, etc. They had it, we probably ordered it. Steaks came out juicy and cooked very well.  Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. Side orders were also very yummy.  All of us were stuffed afterwards. Drinks were good. Small beer selection though. Wait staff was very good as well, given they were short staffed. You could tell they were moving around frantically, but when they got to us, they were so professional and friendly. Bottom line - great food. Certainly would come back here again when visiting New York!",,,

The deco of the places is nice with a old fashioned feeling. We were waiting at the bar maybe for 15min then we got a booth table which was super nice and romantic. We ordered fillet mignon and lots of sides plus dessert and everything was delicious.Overall food it's good and nice friendly service.,,,
20,Charisse S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",130,192,359,4.0,3/12/2016,"This was my second time at Ted's for lunch.  Excellent, speedy service and mouth watering dishes. I decided to try one of the burgers this time around. My first visit I had the sirloin steak,hitch was very good. If you are going for a burger,  I highly recommend the Avalon Burger--Carmelized onions, bacon, Gruyere and may tag cheese. Very tasty combo. No complaints from me, although I do think it's a bit pricey. Luckily both times I've gone, it's been on someone else's dime.",1,1,1
21,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2208,8236,4.0,1/22/2016,"Brought 13 people here for a work dinner and everyone was very pleased.  The food is not necessarily the most interesting or flashy that you might have, but it's very tasty, served hot and fast and the service was top notch.  Our server kept everyone in drinks, checked up on us often and made the terrific service seem effortless.I had a salt and pepper trout which was very good, along with a salt crusted baked potato that was pretty exceptional.The burgers received raves from those who had it.  The bison and french fries were also rated well.  This is a pretty good place and you won't be disappointed!",12,5,7
22,Prudence M.,"South Plainfield, NJ",74,70,191,3.0,8/23/2017,"I've been to this location at least 10 times. I'll say the food is consistently good (except the bison meatloaf is too heavy for my liking) and the service is consistently slow at lunchtime, especially for large groups. Today, the server left one small bowl of pickles for a group of around 15 people. I typically dine with a group of co-workers. My favorite side on the menu is the squash casserole. Absolutely delicious.",,,
23,Jason C.,"Orono, ME",57,55,41,4.0,4/25/2016,"Went here before seeing ""School of Rock"" on Broadway with elder parents, two kids, and a wife who doesn't eat carbs. Found it to be a great place - upscale without being pretentious, and something for everyone on the menu.The decor is classic steakhouse, with private booths, white tablecloths, and large windows that look out onto the street.The service was excellent- we told the server we had a short amount of time due to arriving late (and needing to make the show time) and she was attentive, responsive, and friendly throughout. The kids menus included Wikki Sticks, which are fun, bendable pieces of plastic (instead of crayons + paper) that kept the kids entertained throughout the meal. Better still, the kids menu food was above average with good portions and quality.The adults' meals were all great - salads were large and fresh; veggie burger wasn't a standout, but was definitely filling and well-sized. Yes, we came to a steakhouse and ate salads and a veggie burger, though my 12-year-old son ordered the child's menu steak and gave it 4/5 stars.",,,

I am not sensitive to cross contamination, but they fed me something that was completely glutenous and told me it wasn't and I had a violent reaction during the night that caused me to have a seizure. The bread must have been wheat or something. DO NOT eat here.",,,
26,Kevin C.,"West New York, NJ",136,121,85,4.0,5/29/2017,"We came here on Memorial Day for dinner, and were quite surprised by the rather empty restaurant.  We asked, and the waitress kindly explained that this location did better with the lunch crowd, and again on theater days.  So we were pleasantly surprised when my wife's delmonico bison steak came out deliciously juicy and grilled to perfection.  My bison burger wasn't bad either, although not quite as good as that amazing steak.  The complimentary biscuits, mashed potatoes, and side of fries ended up being all the starchy foods we needed to leave the place feeling quite full.  For anyone visiting here, I'd give a strong recommendation on that delmonico bison steak.",1,,
27,Joseph G.,"North Bergen, NJ",6,31,80,5.0,12/5/2016,"We were actually waiting for a table at another restaurant a couple blocks away when I checked Yelp and realized Ted's was a few blocks away. A call to them found no wait for a table verses 45 minutes. The timing was perfect and I always wanted to try this place.We found Ted's to be very comfortable with a normal noise level. I started with the onion rings with a horseradish dipping sauce and they were awesome. My main dish was the bone in bison ribeye, which was very delicious. My son had the bacon cheeseburger, which he promptly demolished. We were too full to fit desert - perhaps next time.",1,,
28,Savannah B.,"Mount Sinai, NY",2,6,0,4.0,7/21/2018,"Nice atmosphere and relatively affordable food. We had a NY Strip steak and and Avalon Burger on the menu and it was very good. The food should probably come with two sides though. Overall, good experience.",,,

30,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,8/6/2015,"I came here recently for Restaurant Week dinner and enjoyed it, though I feel like they skimped on the appetizers, only offering salad or soup but I did like the soup. It consisted of sausage, vegetables and rice sprinkled on top. It was pretty tasty with plenty of flavor.The main course was steak with Parmesan fries. The steak was delicious -- Juicy, with butter on top and cooked perfectly in its own sauce. The fries were wonderful as well. Very fresh, fluffy and served warm. For dessert, I had the brownie with vanilla ice cream, coffee and caramel syrup flavoring, as well as some whipped cream on the top. This was extremely sweet, rich, decadent, delectable and it was a huge serving! I enjoyed the chocolate-y flavor with the caramel, coffee and ice cream... Everything melded together perfectly.Overall, a good experience... Large serving sizes and nice service.",12,9,9
31,C.C. G.,"Seattle, WA",311,17,24,5.0,1/19/2018,The burgers are divine. The bison meat apparently is healthier -tasted just as delicious either way! We had a pretty large group and they accommodated us just fine.,,,

Ted is a chain with a history and it is really cool to know that your meat is fresh, cut and prepared from A to Z right on the premises. Not that many places can say the same... There was so much to try! - the trout dip was first and perfectly paired with corn chips and baked toasts. - then came the crab cakes- delicious and very meaty! - the corn was good but it was my least favorite...- the salmon was delicious, could definitely taste the woody cedar flavor in the fish! - the steak was the piece of resistance! Medium cooked and generous portions! Yuuuuummmmmm- the fries could have been a little crispier - the sliders were paired with the onion ring. Yummy! - dessert was warm chocolate brownies and we all left with bags of homemade cookies!! The event was amazing! Thank you so much to Ted for hosting such a magnificent and generous table for us!

We had reservations at 5 and got seated right away. Around the table, we ordered the roasted chicken, short ribs, veggie burger and salt and pepper trout. The chicken was the most liked. It was juicy and a healthy portion. The trout was also tasty but smaller in size compared to the other dishes. We were able to switch out sides (i.e. asparagus for broccoli) with no extra charge (which is also a +). They don't have a printed kids menu but they do offer one. Our waitress verbally told us what's on the kids menu. Service was great at first but dwindled down as the restaurant filled up.

39,Allan R.,"London, United Kingdom",136,94,103,5.0,7/8/2015,"This review is based on attending a Yelp event at Ted's Montana Grill where we got the opportunity to sample a selection of their food and drinks.  Bison has long been something I wanted to try and although it is a red meat very similar to beef, there is a subtle flavour difference (probably due to the reduced fat content of bison meat).  Let me tell you, ""Ted's filet"" did not disappoint!  The bison sample was delicious and perfectly cooked for my taste.  To me, the filet was the highlight but we also sampled: * ""St Phillips Island Crab Cakes with avocado"" (generous amounts of crab)* ""Southwest corn"" (although not something I would normally have it was very good and spicy without being over the top)* ""Bar None Sliders"" (beef and bison burger in a ""biscuit"" bun - we ended up in a long semantic debate about scone vs biscuit vs cookie but as the weird foreigner, I really had no chance ;) )  The sliders were excellent although the ""salt and pepper onion rings"" were not really my thing as I'm not a huge fan of deep fried crumbed stuff* ""Cedar Plank Salmon""  Noticeable cedar flavour, which worked very well with the salmon* Brownies (which I generously helped others finish).  Had it not been for the bison filet, this may have been my favourite...They also had red and white sangria, plus wines and fresh squeezed lemonade.  I drank the ""Bison Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon"", which paired well with the bison in more than just name.All in all, a very enjoyable evening with excellent food and extremely friendly staff.  Granted it was an organised event but I would definitely return for a pre-show meal, especially the three course ""Theatre Menu"", which seems a reasonable price for Manhattan.",1,,

We even considered leaving but since we were already there and we were told the food was good, we stayed.After being seated, our friendly waitress took our drink orders. I went with the Lemon Drop Martini (Tito's vodka, Cointreau, and lemonade). SO good, I had another. Others got Hendrick's Mule, Vodka Water w/ Lime and a few beers they had on draft. We were all very satisfied with our drinks!As for food, we all ordered burgers. I ordered the Avalon bison burger cooked at medium. It was a little over done but the gruyere, blue cheese, arugula, carmelized onions and roasted garlic aioli saved it. The cheese was amazing and I LOVE arugula, so this burger was a great fit for my taste buds. I ate most of the burger before I started feeling like a potato. Speaking of potatoes, the french fries on the plate were pretty standard but I ate all of them so no complaints here.

45,Dennie C.,"Englewood, NJ",110,295,14,3.0,5/4/2016,"I recently had lunch at Ted's Montana Grill and overall it was forgettable.  I had a bison burger and my sister had sliders and bison chili.  Our food was okay, nothing particularly interesting and my fries were kind of limp and didn't help add to my meal.  It's someplace that you can eat at in a pinch if you're hungry but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.Ambience:  The restaurant is spacious, nothing too fancy but suitable to the Midtown work crowd.Food: We just had burgers and a side of chili which unfortunately didn't impress us much.Value:  A tad bit pricey like everything else in the area.  Honestly, nearly every restaurant between Times Square and Rockefeller center is pretty much ho-hum and overpriced.Service: Okay.  Our waitress was attentive and prompt.Location: Near Rockefeller Center.",1,,

When I got my food it was really undercooked. My mom asked for a steak well done and it was more medium rare. Now I thought ok maybe it's just a one time thing, let me not judge because of that but then I over heard several tables having the same issue. Maybe this place is a hit or miss or maybe it was the particular chef this night but, they were attentive when I brought the issue up. Also remember to tip! It's not the server's fault!",,,
49,Chrissy H.,"Manhattan, NY",134,395,1258,3.0,1/31/2016,"I had been here before for an event.  I couldn't wait to return.  I am sad to say my own visit was nothing like what I had expected. We thought the price fix menu for plays was a great option.  I didn't see any times online so I assumed it was available any time.  We had to eat after our show due to an occasion we attended before.  So we switched our reservation to 10:30 instead our initial 6pm reservation.Upon arrival I asked if we still could do the price fix.  The hostess was very friendly and said yes.  She gave us the restaurant week menu.  This menu is $3 more than their price fix menu and didn't have the crab cakes and steak on it that sounded good.  I asked the waitress if we could do the price fix menu for before shows.  She said during restaurant week they only run the restaurant week menu.  So let me get this straight, they downgrade the menu and charge $3 more?! In my mind I thought that's poor business.  I asked the waitress if they could honor the items on their regular price fix.  She appeared annoyed.  I said I don't eat much steak so maybe she can explain the steak options to me.  In a snarky tone she barely described the items and was rushing us to order.  She said her manager wouldn't honor their normal price fix and we had to order ASAP.  We rushed to order so much so that my boyfriend felt guilty ordering a drink but I insisted he order. To begin they bring out pickles.  The pickles were good.  I had a Caesar salad, it had a very light dressing with tasty croutons and some cheese.  It was mediocre.  The meat dish I ordered was chewy/grizzly at points, but mostly tender.  Both our meats were a bit rare which we didn't order.  The fries were just warm not hot.  The highlight for me was the brownie dessert.At this point I'm sad to say I'm not sure we'd return.  The poor attitude, raised/revised menu for restaurant week and snarky waitress less left than a desirable taste in our mouth for our $130 bill.  I'd like to think my first experience was more true to what they are, but I'm not sure we will return to ever find out.",3,1,1

For $16, I was hoping for a bit more.The ambiance is nice. The place is pretty big and has a large bar off to the side. We had a few tables around us, but you never felt like you were on top of anyone else. Service was terrible. Our waitress took our order almost immediately, but we waited over 1 hr for our food to come. She never came over to give us a status update and our waters were filled infrequently.

The place was his choice.  I had never even heard of it, nor had anyone else I mentioned it to, but I'm glad it's such a secret! It wasn't crowded at all, even though I had made a reservation, but granted it was a Tuesday. There were only a handful of tables, most of them appeared to be business dinners. Upon sitting, we were greeted by our waitress, water and a bowl of half-sour pickles. I'm partial to sour, but these we're yummy and had a nice crunch. We ordered a bottle of red wine, and sat for a bit and enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered the bison ribeye and I went for the bison short ribs, as I'm not a steak-eater. He had never had a bison steak, but honestly said he couldn't tell the difference. Saves you a couple hundred calories though! We were both VERY happy with our meals! The short ribs fell off the bone and I didn't even need a knife to cut them. Everything was perfectly cooked, as ordered, which was excellent. We slowly enjoyed our meals, enjoying the calm, quiet of the restaurant. I think this place is a great option for a very nice meal, especially for steak lovers who want to try something new!",3,1,1

Succulent beef perfectly cooked to order with fries to die for. The service was excellent and the food came pretty quickly. It took about a half hour to get a table, but they let us sit at the bar and gave us complimentary soft drinks while we waited.

The crab cake app was very tasty and came with a small kale salad that was also very good.  Caesar salad was fine - basic but ok.

The steak was cooked perfectly, and the balance of flavors in the salad was perfect. The manager, Elio, introduced himself to us, which I think is always a great personal touch when dining in a restaurant, it shows that they have an interest in their guests.  We will absolutely be back next time we are in midtown, and I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't yet!",,,

It has never happened to me that the restaurant changes the amount to pay, ignoring what I put with my signature. I put a very small amount of tip since the service was awful (too much waiting, was never there when we wanted to ask something but every time we ask, she would say hold on and start serving other tables) but I thought it was clients' privilege to choose the tip amount but I guess for this restaurant the restaurant decides the tip amount for you!I am still waiting for the reply from the restaurant.",1,,

Ted's Montana Grill was awesome! We were there last month to visit the NYU's dormitories (my daughter's new home for the next four years) and we all felt like eating steak. We noticed the restaurant was adjacent to NBC Studios so it wasn't a surprise to see a few familiar faces and a couple Exec's chowing and downing both food and wine right before our eyes. We all had the steak dinners only because we did not understand where Bison came from until we looked up and saw a huge Buffalo derma on the wall. So then we tried it, not only does TMG have steak from cows that are naturally raised from organic farms but they have Bison. The succulent texture feels, taste and goes down like steak yet smoother and probably easier to digest but I'm no gastrointestinal doc-but it felt different. The servers were pleasant and on-point, this was a surprise to us considering NYC is pre-dominantly about speed and not courtesies and salutations, needless to say the server earned himself and healthy tip, especially since he was so pleasant when it came to serving the red wine.",,,

I had two and in most cases after two drinks, I'm raring to go however, I left feeling nothing. Booo. Tipsy YoSteph is a much more fun YoSteph.The bison nachos were disappointing. I know buffalo may have been extinct at one time, but I thought they were back in business; apparently not on these nachos. The cheese, the small amount that were on the chips, was barely melted and all other toppings (think some tomatoes and jalapeños) were sparse. Overall, these were some pretty pathetic nachos and nachos are pretty much the easiest thing to make. The fried green beans were delicious, so I'd suggest those.Overall, if you're desperate for somewhat affordable fare in the neighborhood, I'd say be hesitant but come by, but maybe stick to the burgers.

82,C C.,"Little Elm, TX",1,32,8,2.0,7/12/2016,"Visiting NYC, pre-Broadway-show meal.  We were going to go casual at Ellen's Stardust, line was too long, Ted's Montana Grill was just down the street and within easy range of Gershwin Theatre.Food overall was decent to good, service was severely lacking.   Started with house Caesar salad.  The ingredients were fresh, yet the dressing was very bland.  i.e., it lacked the flavor and 'zing' of a regular Caesar dressing.  The fact that it was eggless, as stated in the menu, should not have accounted for lack of discernable Caesar flavor.  Daughter got roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots. I tried the carrots, they had nice texture and flavor.  I had the veggie burger and salt & pepper onion rings.  I liked that they had horseradish cheddar cheese available for the burger.  Don't come across it often and I jumped at the chance to have it on the burger.  Burger held its consistency well, compared to other veggie burgers.  Overall, the food was decent to good with the one exception of the Caesar salad dressing.Service is where this visit gets bad marks.  Upon being seated right away (good), there was too long of a wait for our first contact by server. Around 6-7 minute range.  Other servers not ours were continually coming in the general area.  It was getting to the ""do you know who the server for this table is"" question to anyone who could be flagged down when our server appeared.The server got our orders correct.  The issue was in the service itself.  After delivering our order they largely disappeared.  Proactively checked on us only once the entire meal.  Had to flag down twice for condiments, flag down another time for water.  I also noticed at one point they disappeared around the corner by the bathrooms, and didn't appear again for about 10-12 minutes.  Smoke break, phone texting/call break?  When they did come to our table, theiir disposition was hurried and rushed, instead of inquisitive and service-oriented.  Example:  we were in the latter half of eating but weren't finished yet.  During the one time they checked on us, they approached and asked, ""All done?"", instead of ""how is everything?"", ""may I get you anything else?"", ""will you be wanting to look at a dessert menu?"", ""Will you be needing a to-go box later?"", etc.    Later, during another extended absence from our table, another server cleared our places.In short, the service was largely absent, and when server did come by there was verbiage and nonverbals of rushing us.  Food overall was decent, service severely lacking.  When back in the area, first look will be for somewhere else to eat.  Wish the establishment the best, the service was a bit too paltry for an establishment with this atmosphere and this price range.",,,

The Happy Hour bar scene is thriving, so for an early dinner the dining room is basically empty and service is quick, so this is a great option for a before theater dinner.Most of the beers on tap are pretty standard, but we did enjoy the Sam Adams Cold Snap.  Our server was friendly and attentive.We had the Salt & Pepper Onion rings, noted on the appetizer menu, along with our burgers and they were probably the best onion rings I've ever had. The were crispy, not at all greasy and they provided the perfect bite.  No breading falling off or onion pulling out.  Served with a creamy horseradish sauce, they were truly excellent.As for the burgers we opted for bison meat which was high quality, but a bit more gamy than bison I've had at another burger place.  The Bacon Cheeseburger included crispy bacon and grilled onions.  The No. 11 is a burger topped with braised bison, cheddar and mushrooms.  The burgers are quite hearty and fulfill any burger craving in a strong way.  The fries are excellent, crispy and tender and you can tell they are real fresh-cut fries.It's not a cheap burger spot, but you get a great burger and a satisfying meal.",,,

Although it was good, im not sure that the strong flavors of gruyere and blue cheese worked that well with this burger, but that's not the bison's fault!If you are unsure whether to try bison or not...just think it tastes like meat, but with less fat, and all the same juiciness. How does the bison do it no one will ever know.",1,1,1
88,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",193,212,4275,3.0,10/12/2014,"Ted's Montana Grill overall score: 73My wife and I came in for the ""theater menu"" deal: $29 for three courses. Not a bad price. Check the verdict below.Flavor: 6My first bite of the beef rib eye was a nine, but it went downhill from there. The steak was nicely cooked and all, but the meat was a bit tough, a bit over-salted and wet. When I say wet, I mean there were small puddles of grease on the top of the steak. Also when I say tough, I mean the grain of the meat was tight and a little difficult to chew. While it did have a decent flavor, I had to drop the score because of these things. There was also a good deal of grizzle on the cut, and a shitload of bleed-out once I got down on it. If it weren't for that and the grizzle I might have scored this a seven.",1,,

90,Jennifer W.,"Rocklin, CA",634,281,72,5.0,7/8/2015,"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. I came here last night to attend a Yelp event so I was lucky enough to be served a variety of food options. For apps, I would definitely recommend the crab cakes which come with a guacamole and kale salad - something different and such a great pairing. The bar none sliders were perfectly cooked and served on a moist biscuit like bun instead of the standard dry white bread buns. For dinner entrees, we sampled the cedar plank salmon and the Ted's Fillet. Both were great but I would definitely recommend the steak over the salmon (it is a steakhouse after all) as its very tender and was perfectly cooked. The restaurant has the feel of a typical steakhouse inside with a spacious dinning room and a large bar area with additional seating. Even with our large party, the wait staff was friendly and I could tell they were rushing around as quickly as possible to make sure that we were all taken care of (they did forget my water but made sure I had plenty of wine so I will forgive them).I hear that they also have a decent happy hour at the bar so that's always an excuse to pop in and check this place out.",5,4,4

Turn out the bar area is big and super comfortable. They have 5+ tall tables for groups to hang out around and 15ish chairs at the bar. Every seat was taken so I had to wait a bit to grab one. That wasn't a problem though because I grabbed a drink and stood around and waited.Kevin, Nick, and Alex were my bartenders and they were AWESOME! Super friendly, engaged in our conversations and they kept us there drinking and buying food. I will definitely be back to visit the bar and I hope to cross paths with them. I already suggested our next work happy hour be at that bar. Throughout the night I had a beer, a couple margaritas, and one of their craft teas. All were good.

Bigger than possibly any other restaurant I've seen in Manhattan. They served us very generous portions for our tasting event. My favorites? 100% definitely the bison cheeseburger slider and bison filet. Their bison is incredibly juicy and tender, so this is your spot if you're looking for that.They also had a delicious crab cake with guacamole (who knew the two went together well?), ice cream fudge brownie dessert, and snickerdoodle cookies. I would highly recommend their sangria, which was probably one of the tastiest sangrias I've had in the city...just couldn't stop drinking it.I would say their salmon was very dry, but honestly I would come here for bison over salmon any day.

Everything is super fresh and made on site. No processed foods at Ted's! They have a great variety on the menu and everything I've tried has been amazing. My fav is the steak with the bison burger being a close runner up. The sides are all great too. They have a great happy hour and lots of yummy cocktail options. Even their cocktail mixers are fresh and made on-site! I definitely see more trips to Ted's in my future. I hate the commotion of the area where Ted's is located, but the amazing food you get there makes it all worth it! Oh yeah, the prices aren't too bad here either!

I was jonesing for a steak salad and in the wasteland of midtown lunch options, this was the only place that had one. You have to order at the bar, which is fine, and the bartenders were really nice. But it took almost 40 minutes to make a salad. A salad! It finally came, and I ran out to get back to work. I had asked to have the crispy onions removed because of an allergy, which the kitchen apparently just ignored. The steak was okay, nothing special, but the lettuce was some gross iceberg mix which was clearly past its expiration date (all dried out and brown). Not a great experience for a salad that cost over $20. Live and learn, I guess. Won't be making this mistake again.",,,

We had to wait almost 20 minutes for her steak as our food became cold. Then to add insult to injury our bill was overcharged. The food portion on my son's rib order was ridiculously small -one rib. The only positive was the food was tasty but very, very salty. We didn't try desserts because the service was so poor and slow we had to leave to catch our show.

The restaurant is located in an expansive room with a bison head mounted on one of the walls.For the Yelp event, we were offered a tasting menu with highlights from Ted's. Every menu item was quite good. My personal favorite was the crab cakes, which had generous amounts of crab meat. Also, the hamburger and bison filet were delicious. Or perhaps it was a bison burger and meat filet. I couldn't tell the difference, but both were very good.I also got to sample some Sangria from their bar. It was quite good, and the maitre d' told us that all of their juices/mixes are pressed in-house. They have a Happy Hour from 5-7pm on weeknights that with $5 martinis.

I have to say, everything I tried was great, but the bison burger was PHENOMENAL. The drinks were also great- I recommend the white sangria, or the fresh squeezed lemonade for a non-alcoholic option. Both drinks were from a truly fresh batch so they tasted great!The waitstaff was also really nice and accommodating. The manager of the restaurant even came out and told the whole group the history of the restaurant and its founders, which I thought was a nice touch.All in all, Ted's is a great casual place with phenomenal food and drinks.

The food was quality, the clientele was mixed with locals, tourists, and business folk, and the staff was super friendly and attentive. On this visit, I had their New Mexico burger with beef (they also offer bison for their burgers). This delicious and tender burger was topped with pepper Jack cheese, roasted Anaheim peppers, spicy tomato jam, and yummy guacamole! Definitely worth getting again!! Fries were served on the side with the burger, and these were super tasty as well. I didn't taste any of their cocktails, but I did order diet coke, which was the fountain variety... and served with the small crunchy ice pieces that you find in Sonic sodas. What a treat! Also, the sodas were all-you-can-drink as they should be at every restaurant-- don't you just hate it when a restaurant is so high and mighty that they don't offer free refills on soda?As for atmosphere, the place has a very masculine feel inside (lots of wood) but still very fresh and up-to-date looking and neither stuffy nor pretentious.

The first time was a group pg 4 and this time was a group of 7. We had a 12pm reservations and it took a while to get seated as it seemed a lot of people came in at the same time. The hostess area is not located in the best place so it gets a bit cramped and awkward waiting to be seated and you constantly have to try to get out of other people's ways.The 7 of us were initially seated at a 5 person table round table and we were quite cramped. Per our request however, they moved us to a booth, which was much more comfortable.We all had burgers and there were no complaints made. I had the bison green and hot and I thought it was ok. My burger tasted like bland meat, the guac added nothing to save it and the jalapenos were barely grilled. I also had the 50/50 and the fries were way better than the onion rings.

134,Sean H.,"Plainville, CT",8,13,0,4.0,12/16/2014,"On a nice trip to NYC with my fiancé and a few friends we decided to eat at Teds when the original place that we wanted to eat was packed. Upon entering we were seated and saw the menu and everything seemed interesting, they had bison on the menu which intrigued us. And they put pickles down on the table which was an awesome treat.We ordered various things and was satisfied with the meals. There were unfortunately only a couple things that made the experience less than perfect. 1) the waitress took a while to approach us. 2) there are no refills on the $3 soda which is in maybe a 10oz glass. 3) the drink that was a simple rum and coke was $12.50. 4) overheard a few off comments by waitstaff. Most of that is minor and it was good food and I would go back again to experience more of their menu. It is worth a trip.",,,1
135,David B.,"New York, NY",59,140,2,4.0,5/29/2014,"Midtown Manhattan isn't know for brunch. However, Ted's Montana Grill on 51st Street is looking to change that. With a newly-launched brunch menu, Ted's is looking to pull some of your traditional Village brunchers up above 42nd street.I was invited to check out Ted's new brunch menu. Ted's Montana Grill is known for two things 1) Ted Turner 2) bison, bison and more bison. On the brunch menu this is evident as your eyes are immediately drawn to the Bison Short Rib Hash, called out in enormous font and dominating the other dishes listed.Some of our brunch highlights:Subtly spicy Bloody Marys were served with a slice of bacon.The Bison Short Rib Hash came served with breakfast potatoes, roasted cornand avocado, topped with fried eggs. Don't let the pictures fool you. There were mounds of melt-in-your-mouth slow-braised short rib bison underneath those eggs that were bursting with flavor. The bison delivered a flavor punch (that's right, flavor punch) directly to my taste buds. This is an unbelievably rich dish.The Crab Cake Benedict consists of St. Phillip's Island crab cakes, wilted spinach,poached eggs and chipotle hollandaise served with breakfast potatoes. For those of you looking to cut some carbs, this Benedict was unique in that the crab cakes served as the English muffins. Hailey had no complaints here, greedily devouring this dish. (I didn't even get any!)Next up, savory corn flapjacks with oven-roasted ham, cheddar cheese and chives, served with honey butter and maple syrup. I was expecting these to be heavy pancakes. What we got were light, fluffy and buttery flapjacks. I was stuffed from my bison hash but somehow I found room to fit these guys. The edges had a buttery crispness to them and I'd highly recommend these for those that aren't into eggs as much.Finally, a boozy mudslide milkshake capped off the brunch. This was made with Baileys, Kahlua and vodka, and filled with huge scoops of ice cream topped with lots of whipped cream. If I had known I would be drinking a milkshake during brunch I would have worn my stretchy pants!The best thing I heard during brunch came from one of the chefs. He told me that they're experimenting in the kitchen to come up with the perfect brunch menu. How are they doing this? By checking out popular brunch spots in the West Village to see what's working. (By the way, this sounds like an awesome part of the job.)The VerdictI'm looking forward to seeing how Ted's menu evolves over the coming months. They're just starting out with brunch and it sounds like the team is committed to making it work. The only critique I have is that compared to other brunch spots, prices are a little steep and drinks aren't included so this may be a brunch to check out when your parents are in town. Regardless, I highly recommend giving Ted's Montana Grill a try - you won't regret it!",2,1,2
136,Geoffrey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,0,5.0,6/24/2016,"Some people complain about the price, but keep in mind this is all meat from animals that have grazed free on the range.  This is about as ethical as meat consumption gets, the steaks are pretty good too.  It's no Peter Luger but it's not nearly as expensive, so factor that in.  Service was good, I thought the asparagus was slightly stringy but frankly I'm here for the bison.  Would definitely return.",,,

Uninspired and very slow waitress. Will not return. Giving 1 stars for the decor + 1 for the food.",,2,
139,Nick C.,"Pleasanton, CA",128,43,95,2.0,3/8/2015,"Ordered the bison ribs and onion rings. The onion rings were awesome! Lightly battered and crispy. The same can't be said for the bison ribs. When the dish came out I thought they had brought an appetizer. Only three ribs and the fries took up more of the plate than the ribs. Ok so I thought the ribs better be pretty amazing for so few. Unfortunately they were just ok. Flavor on the BBQ sauce was decent but nothing spectacular. I guess I should have tried the steak, but when you have bison as a main selling point it should be on point. Next time I'll skip it and order a steak.",,,
140,Cathy A.,"Long Beach, NY",0,3,2,5.0,6/17/2016,"My cousin and I had pleasure of eating lunch at Ted's Montana Grill earlier this week.  I ordered the Ted's bacon cheeseburger (bison, of course), and it was pretty impressive.  I will admit, this was my first time eating bison anything and I am so happy that I did.  It was delicious!  My cousin also ordered a bison burger and thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it!  We shared the grilled shrimp appetizer, which was just as amazing as the burgers.  Of course, we couldn't leave without ordering dessert.  The strawberry shortcake was out of this world!  The wait staff was very polite and attentive, and that is always a huge plus.  This was my first visit to Ted's and I will most definitely be back.  The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was warm and inviting.  Kudos to the management.",,,

143,Marites O.,"Red Bank, NJ",20,68,28,3.0,1/3/2015,"We came here with a large group that included 4 children and 5 adults who just survived the chaos at American Girl.  Although we did not have a reservation, it was early on New Year's Day when everyone was sleeping in, so the place had only a few customers.  We only had to wait for them to pull tables together for our large party.  Pickles are served immediately which pleased my husband.  He is the guy who will visit our local farmers' market weekly in Red Bank, NJ for his 2-Tub supply.  I think our table did ask for another round before we ordered our appetizers and meals.The menu is a vegetarian's nightmare.  All beef and bison dishes.  More diverse burger combinations than at Bobby's Burger Palace.  The adult milkshake offerings caught our eye, but so did the calorie count which was listed on the menu.  We chose to just dream about them.  The waiter patiently answered our menu questions and was attentive throughout the meal.  Service was accommodating that they allowed one of the adults order chicken tenders from the kids' menu because there was no equivalent offering from the adult menu. Adult size = double kid price. We ordered a basketful of onion rings and homemade potato chips which came out with house-made ranch dressing and horseradish dressing.  I never got a chance to taste the rings because the kids inhaled them.  The chips were OK, but I have had better from the plethora of Portuguese places in Newark.I chose to get a naked burger with avocado, tomato and roasted Brussel sprouts (with bacon!) which was the veggie of the day.  The burger could use some seasoning but otherwise fine to satiate me. My daughter had the sliders which she finished all three.  They had to be good because she usually brings  leftovers home.  My husband enjoyed his bison burger.  He also had their tortilla soup which he also said was good. We had no room for dessert.  We would go again if we are visiting this part of the city.",,,

147,Marie S.,"New York, NY",55,262,190,4.0,2/16/2016,"Ted's Montana Grill is located steps away from Radio City Music Hall & Rockefeller Center. It has a very ""low key"" facade & you can almost walk right past it. Don't. This restaurant has a lot to offer. Founded by philanthropist & environmentalist Ted Turner, the eponymous Ted's Montana Grill offers authentic American fare at reasonable prices (especially for this Manhattan neighborhood).  Bison is the main draw here & it is a great place for that. If you don't already know, Bison has less saturated fat than regular beef. It's a nice change from the regular burgers offered at most places. Ted's Montana Grill's menu is basic yet offers something for everybody. Healthy and gluten-free selections are available. In fact, there is a meal nutrition calculator on the website that allows you to create a meal taking into account dietary & calorie restrictions! (See link tedsmontanagrill.com/men…) As for the food, it is consistently good. Keep in mind that it is traditional American, don't expect anything exotic. It is a great place to bring visitors from overseas who have never had Bison before. It also a great place to go with people who have issues with food & cannot handle spicy, fatty foods. I usually go here in the evenings when it is less crowded. I always get the iceberg wedge salad. I'm addicted to the homemade dressing, I want the recipe! Also good are the burgers & cedar plank salmon. The sodas are a little too sweet for me, but that's just a personal preference. The service is consistently top notch. The staff is super friendly & accommodating. It's a low key place, so don't expect lightening fast service but they don't try to rush the meal and pressure you to leave either. Noise level is average. Nice business crowd. Overall very friendly, pleasant dining experience.",,,

The burgers were done very well (quality wise, not meat temperature wise). My only complaint was the baternder wasn't attentive at all. There was only one other patron at the bar (and the restaurant wasn't packed), and it took a long time for her to come over intially and to get more drinks throughout our meal.",,,

The food was good, the server we had was super nice and attentive. Just overall I think we all look for that ""special"" spot, that makes us think it's special and fun, not something that probably has a bunch of cousins scattered around the midwest like a Denny's... You won't hate it if you go here, but you probably won't love it either, so it never hurts to try it and say you went...",1,,1

I also got the delicious duo which comes with two 3oz burgers. You can choose to get both beef, both bison or one of each. I got one of each and they were both delicious, but I actually enjoyed the bison burger the most (I've never had bison before).  The burgers are one of the best I've ever had!!

154,Amanda L.,"Denver, CO",128,296,0,3.0,8/5/2014,"Soup (it was the gumbo that night) was OK. Bison nachos sounded interesting but they too were just OK. Same with the onion rings.The bison short ribs were pretty good (when is braised meat not good?), as was the bison ribeye. Not life-changing, not omg-i-have-to-come-back-because-these-are-so-delicious, but just right in the middle good.Service was painfully slow, but it might have been because they stuck us in a small private room in the back. And it was Restaurant Week. But still... our server never checked up on us, our water glasses were never refilled, and our check took forever to arrive.Overall, right in the middle A-OK (since I will give them the benefit of the doubt re: service): The food just didn't wow me, but it's not like I'll balk at the idea if someone really wanted to eat here with me.",,,

We were not seated till 4:20.  That was the only complaint that we had.  Our waitress arrived to take drink orders, we choose this restaurant for two reasons.  One on someone's recommendation, and two because they have a gluten free menu.  True to there word they cooked everything separate.  The food was excellent, I had the bison Avalon burger, I never had bison before, I thought it was a little leaner than the beef.  It was very tasty.  Yes, we would definitely go again!",,,
