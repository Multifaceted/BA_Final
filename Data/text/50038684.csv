0,Tonya H.,"Tampa, FL",73,28,40,5.0,8/24/2018,"I visit NY often, I live in Florida. My brother took me here for the first time in June. This place is awesome. The music, wings and Henny Punch! Oh! And not to mention the Hookah of course! I returned to NY in August and didn't know where to go it was pretty late like 2am by the time I decided to go out I wasn't far from here so I stopped by. I didn't get there in time to get the wings actually was only 8 mins after kitchen closed so I enjoyed a nice margarita and the music of course. Next time I will be sure to get there on time for wings! Great place and atmosphere.",1,,
1,Eva T.,"Brooklyn, NY",321,9,7,3.0,11/11/2018,"What I didn't like was the attitude of the hostess, I had to go back and forth with her to let my friends and I in. She was saying I can't seat you without your whole party, we were waiting on 1 person!Inside is pretty small! It definitely has a great vibe in there, but our server was nice, but she couldn't be as attentive because she was the only one in the front half & maybe in the back to waiting tables.The buffalo wings were good & the hookah was great too. I like that someone gave us bubbles, my friends and I were able to blow bubbles into the hookah and it caused a cool effect !!!If they expanded the place and added some more servers that would be great. I feel like if they did this that two hr limit to stay seated (which I find weird) would be eliminated.",,,
2,Felicia G.,"New York, NY",243,3,2,1.0,11/3/2018,"New Addition to this review:1. I called to let them know I was running late for my reservation and they said that they only hold for 15 min no exceptions. When I did arrive, which was a minute past the 15 min grace period they said they didn't know if they could honor my reservation. -The kicker is they literally had a total of 4 people sitting within the whole establishment. And according to resy.com open availability for the next 4 hours.2. ID check: This was the 2nd time I've come to this establishment and had an issue with ID checks. My mother came from out of town and did not have her physical drivers license. She did however have a government issued military ID and a paper MVA drivers license replacement which included her address, name and actual drivers license number. They said she could not enter the establishment because she did not have a state issued ID that they could scan.-A military ID is a federal issued identification card with a photo so I don't understand what the issue would be. On top of that she had 2 forms of identification. The paper MVA card-which is State issued- is sufficient enough for her to drive but isn't sufficient enough for her to enter the establishment? An establishment that had a total of 4 people with it on a Friday night? I keep trying to support a Black-owned establishment in my community and it continues to disappoint me. Unfortunately, my third experience here really has done the trick and I will make sure to tell everyone about my experience and to think twice about trying to come. The obviously don't want business or are okay with the minimal support they do have.Old: I brought my mother and her friend here on a Friday night as they were visiting for the weekend. My mother's friend license happened to be expired by 2 days and she was denied entry. We came for a 5:30 reservation and there was a total of 10 people in the entire restaurant. We asked to speak to the manager as she was clearly over the age of 21 (52 to be exact). The entire waiting staff went to the back to ""discuss"" the situation. The manager then came out 10 minutes later to say it's their policy to have everyone's IDs scanned at the door for entry. I understand that this is the case but for a place to be basically empty and to deny entry to someone that is clearly over the legal age because of this is somewhat ridiculous. She was willing to have a credit card held at the register or some other identification to appease this policy but still she was denied. This is the second time I've had an issue here as they made me wait 25 minutes to enter on a separate occasion because my party was already seated. They really need to reevaluate their ridiculous policies especially when there's people who are willing to pay and experience. Safe to say this will be my last time coming here. I'd rather go downtown.",1,,
3,Alex H.,"Atlanta, GA",640,3,3,2.0,8/26/2018,"Customer service improvement needed. Brought some friends from out of town to come enjoy the vibe and mood Sunday night. There were 5 us, looking to get a table, the place was full but not packed.  The line at the door is just ridiculous for a place that isn't packed -- but were frustrated to hear that to get a table, there is a 4:1 hookah policy and the 5 of us would have to get2 hookahs.  I explained, as an asthmatic person that doesn't smoke -- the extra hookah wouldn't be necessary. The hostess explained the ""house"" policy, and again I explained that I don't smoke. Totally getting the policy and willing to spend an adequate amount to supplement the decision not to get second hookah, we made eye contact and the hostess then explained that the bar was available and we could sit and get one hookah. Not wanting to escalate situation and still wanting to treat my out of town guests well, we buckled and accepted the seats at the bar.Generally house policies are understood, management should consider alternatives and appropriate accommodations for patrons that aren't able to comply for health reasons.",,,

Really good tasting drink, came with gummy worms, shared it with my friend wasn't completely strong, but cool.Gummy bear hookah was tasty, smooth, and coals were changed so it wasn't harsh.Bathroom was clean too, so 5 Stars for me.Calm crowd, not rowdy.

5,Keilon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,312,1878,3.0,10/2/2018,"I'm giving 3 stars only because I think that they're slightly overpriced. My friend and I ended with a $200 tab for simply drinks and a hookah. Granted, we left thoroughly inebriated, I'm sure that I've been out to hookah spots with 4 friends and paid roughly the same total bill.  The ambience is clean and sleek. They treat it like a club experience, from the line that they create to enter the venue at 8pm even when there's only 8 people inside at the time.  That almost made me want to leave and just find a with less pretentiousness. We stuck it out for the roughly 10 minutes as we didn't want to do standing room at another bar on Lenox Ave.  The drinks were cool, and both bartenders (Latin guy who left midway through the evening to make way for a darker skin woman) were friendly.  The latter very fun and inviting.  I believe they do some food here also but we came after dinner and weren't checking for it.  The music was good and then there is also a DJ on weekends later in the evening on weekends, at least.  This is a nice spot to come and be seen I suppose.",3,,

7,Darween F.,"Brooklyn, NY",158,82,185,4.0,5/21/2018,"After sadly missing dinner with my friends, a couple of us came here to chill and hang out for a bit. As soon as we got there, the bouncer let us know that they were at capacity and wouldn't be letting anyone else inside. We were so annoyed, but started looking for another place nearby. As soon as we found someplace and started to walk away, the bouncer called over to us and let us know that some people just left and that they had 3 seats available at the bar! Look at God!I was a bit annoyed when we walked in because I didn't see why we were stopped from coming earlier. The place was not full at all, but I suppose they don't want people standing around and will only allow people in if they can be seated. Antyways, once seated, we immediately ordered our hookah and some dranks... and since I missed dinner, I got some wings and fries. The food came out so quickly I almost sent it back in fear it wasn't cooked enough, but it passed the taste test! Or maybe I was too hungry to tell the difference haha. The buffalo wings were good and the fries were nice and crispy. I had the Triple H drink, which was Henny, Henny, and some other stuff. Also, you guys, the hookah was ELITE! Nice and smooth, great flavor (we got mint and mango) and they change the coal frequently. Shoutout to the real MVP, our bartender Shelby! She was so cool and down to earth and makes amazing drinks!",,,

10,Keke R.,"Addisleigh Park, NY",136,69,176,3.0,9/7/2018,I really wanted to give this place a better rating but I must tell the truth. For my birthday my girlfriends took me here. We were a party of 5. After telling us they will not seat us and me explaining to them that we drove all the way from Queens they asked us to wait 15 minutes to get in and we agreed. 15 minutes quickly became an hour standing up outside and dresses and heels. After getting in we were told that a party of five couldn't share one hookah. One of my friends didn't smoke but they still wanted us to buy another one. After talking to management she over looked it and allowed us to purchase one. On The bright side The hookah was great the music was good and the drinks were good to. I will definitely come back here and give them another chance. It's a cool small Black owned business but I'm sure they were just having a off night. Oh the ice cream brownie was amazing,,,
11,Tee G.,"Hudson County, NJ",97,99,72,1.0,8/6/2018,"First of all the pompous giant at the front door needs an attitude adjustment.  That uppity, ""miss thing there is no guest list"" demeanor went out in 1995, get a grip! After looking and scanning our ID's for 10 minutes on a humid, hot, summer Sunday evening he finally let my friend and I inside to this EMPTY and overpriced establishment.   I have no issues with the place being empty early Sunday evening.  Our party was large enough to make it lively.   My issue is why the 10 minute scanning of ID's with a scowl on the face, only to walk into an empty establishment. My boyfriend went to park the car and apparently someone from our party had to go outside and confirm that he was part of our party before letting him in.  Again this goes back to the bad vibe from the bouncer and the pretentious attitude given from the minute you walk in the door.  No smile, no hello, not even a ""Have a good time"".   We are high paying customers in our 40's and 50's walking in on a Sunday evening which is not prime time for party goers.  Do you want our business or not?The bottle service with sparklers is all a bunch of hoopla.  A $350 package among a group of 8 ultimately got me ONE solid cocktail. Huge waste of money for some Henny and cranberry juice.  The two hookahs were mediocre at best but thankfully the waitress checked and refreshed it midway.   In other words, kudos for doing your job!Three of us started dancing a little bit, the middle space was completely open and we certainly were not bumping into any patrons but we were told we could not dance as they do not have the appropriate license to allow dancing.  Total buzz kill!!  We finished our drinks and left!  I do not foresee us ever going back.",2,3,

The tables are timed (2hrs), so we decided to sit at the bar instead. The hookahs were periodically filled without asking, smooth smoke, flavors were great and the music (DJ) was poppiiinnnn! Lol.

Yes, the bouncer does hold the line at times, but has been a sweetheart to me and my friends and I never had to wait more than 15 mins to get in (even when packed). The hookah is AMAZING, the best in Harlem (heck, even Manhattan), and the drinks are deliciously made and packs a punch. I had a few light fares (wings, fries and eggrolls) and we're all pretty good.

I've had them a couple times since I've been there and they're always so good. From now on I'll be going there just for them and the hookah will be just extra for me.

19,Ricky W.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",228,6,1,1.0,9/3/2018,I want to like this place because I live in the neighborhood and love hookah. The owners and management need to understand that it's not okay to hold people in a line to walk  into an almost empty establishment. Drinks are weak and over priced and the food is Meh at best.

I said to myself that the people make the party, not the place. I was wrong. This place tried its best to ruin my birthday celebration. Our waiter was awesome. That's the end of my compliments.The wait to get in to a half-empty place is hilarious. My girl who arrived before me had to come get me at the door like a promoter at a club. The FOOD is unseasoned unless you are eating wings. We ordered a bunch of things and they were all mediocre. And after an argument with management in an attempt to get a hookah -- we had a party of 5 so they tried to make us buy 2 hookahs, even though 1 of our party wasnt smoking -- they finally agreed to give it to us, only to have the waiter come to tell us that he would ""take it away"" if more than 3 people were observed smoking. We promptly cancelled the hookah, paid the bill, tipped the waiter well and left.If you want HOOKAH go someplace that doesn't have a per-person hookah policy. This is New York.

They had us wait until a space opened for us to sit down at which I thought was reasonable. Drinks were standard NYC prices and fairly potent as well. The bartenders were efficient and the DJ kept the vibe hype with the tunes he was spinning (rap/hip-hop/r&b). The night we went there appeared to have been a large number of lady loves there which was no bother to us; everyone was chill, social, and there to have a good time. We enjoyed our hookah flavor with the pineapple head and the they refilled the coals at adequate intervals. Honestly a great turn up spot in Harlem.",,,

Updated review","Unfortunately, I cannot share in the glowing reviews of this establishment for the most absurd and unpatriotic reason ever. This past evening I attempted to patronize this establishment with my Air Force fiancé who had been deployed out of the country for the last two years. We were denied entry because they DO NOT ACCEPT MILITARY IDENTIFICATION!!! I was shocked.  I'm still trying to figure out how identification that is issued by the US military is insufficient; an identification that indicates a security clearance, but a state identification that does not provide similar assurances is. They can risk their lives to keep us safe but that ID/sacrifice means nothing to HARLEM HOOKAH. PATHETIC!!  While the business manager may think referring me to a policy justifies said policy she is incorrect. Just because it is written doesn't it make it logical or just. I would love to thank Harlem Hooker for its service but unfortunately for them that will NEVER happen. Beware servicemen, they may be grateful for your service but the identification associated with that sacrifice isn't good enough to get you in their front door. EXTRA PATHETIC!!!!",,,

Updated review","Let's state the facts 1) if it is a law then you guys should have never asked us that if we closed our previous bill you would allow us to get a hookah. (Raised eyebrow) No where in the law does it state that. (lies)2)I definitely asked the waitress to remove the 18% ""SUGGESTED"" gratuity off my bill several times and she stated that it was mandatory.

30,Angely R.,"West Bronx, NY",450,61,365,3.0,3/25/2018,"Came here for the first time with a few friends.. to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were all in the mood for hookah and drinks and we decided to try this spot as it was in the area. The hookah, the drinks and waiter were great! This place also plays really good music! We loved the concept. However we felt really uncomfortable with the fact that the front door ladies took a photo of our IDs?!! Passports and licenses. No scanning. Just photos. We asked how come they are taking photos of our IDs and how with identity theft incidents we didn't like the idea. One of the door girls simply said ""it's for our manager.. because if something happens to you he needs to know who was here"". Excuse me? Should I be worried about my safety in this place? .. she then said ""the photos are automatically deleted in 24hrs and if you don't want me to take a photo then you just can't come in here."". But how do we know this is true? How do we know who uses this iPad?. So after letting her take the photos we sat down. And I went back up to her to ask her to please delete my license photo that I didn't feel at ease. She said ""that's the manager's iPad, if you like I can get a manager to speak to you"". I said please do. She seemed annoyed and gave me attitude for it. I said ok I'll be seating and will wait. She replied ""uhu, I heard you"". However the manager never came!!!! And my sister being an NYPD she said not even THEY are allowed to take photos of IDs!!! So why is this place taking photos of our IDs. Totally did not like that experience. It's odd, shady and shouldn't be acceptable. I gave this review an extra star because the waiter (asian guy) was awesome! Otherwise it wouldn't been 2. I hope this method gets changed.

31,Maya B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/12/2018,"this was my review that was from Resy but, the site won't let you post the review no matter what length so, i took my talents to yelp what went wrong you ask? well, let's see...made a reservation for a party of four, at 6:30pm on a Sunday. We arrived around maybe, 6:16pm and the security guard checked our ID's and said ""give me a second, i'll go get the hostess"". At a normal establishment, you'd think that this would mean you'd be getting seasted shortly or AT THE LEAST, allowed inside to wait because it's only damn near winter outside. Nope, not here. Instead you wait outside while the hostess dances around, texting on her phone, chatting it up with all of everyone inside. Not to mention, it was dead in there. So there's actually no reason why the hostess was so very ""booked and busy"".  By now, frustrated as hell, we ask the bouncer what the hold up was and even he was saying how disrespectful what was happening was. By now the time is 6:36pm, asked to speak with a manager, takes him an additional several minutes to come out and I explained the situation and then the hostess comes out, says nothing to us...STILL all while the manager is being very combative with me telling me ""we don't seat guest before their reservation time"" meanwhile it is now after our said reservation time and yet still, no one even bothered to come outside to tell us anything in regards to anything. Long story long, we did not end up staying. When this place first opened service was phenomal. As time went by, service has declined IMMENSELY. You want to try so hard to support local black businesses but it's truly hard when they do not value their customers with respect and exude the worst attitudes possible.

Oh I also forgot about the drinks - bottomless mimosas. We literally spent hours there and had to force ourselves to leave we had such a great time. Our waiter David was amazing! He was friendly and checked in on us often. I recommend this restaurant if you are in NYC. I'll be back for sure. I'd like to come at night next time to see what it's like.",1,,
37,Lanetta H.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,3,0,3.0,2/6/2018,"Went here with a party of 6 in mid January. We had a late reservation on a Saturday night after midnight. By the time we all found parking (3 cars) we were about 10 minutes late for the reservation with a 15 minute grace period before cancellation. The bouncer had us wait behind the rope while he turned a few walk-ups away stating 'reservations only'. We were informed that 'we just made it' and seated right away. We decided to order a bottle of Ciroc, a bunch of appetizers & a hookah. The waitress told of we had to pay for the bottle 1st and that it would be a separate bill. It was strange but we went with it. The bill for the bottle had gratuity included. Next was the food & hookah order. They told us we had to order a minimum of 2 hookahs because their 'policy' is 3 people to 1 hookah even though 1 of us wasn't smoking. We went with that too.So the food was good & the hookah was 'okay'...I've definitely had better. The pineapple head was supposed to make it burn longer but we needed new coals which took at least 20 minutes because 'they were being heated'. When the bill came we realized another gratuity charge was added for the same waitress that bought the bottle we ordered. There was some kind of small altercation at the table next to us & they kindly packed up their food after a brief conversation with the bouncer. Overall my biggest issue about this place was being charged twice for tax & gratuity & forced to order more hookah than necessary. One hookah would have sufficed as we couldn't even finish the two we had even if the new coals came faster. The vibe was kind of stiff with all the 'rules' in place although the music was good and the staff could be more friendly.",4,,

Came here for my brother's birthday on a Thursday night after making a reservation on Opentable. The decor is awesome as is the music. The hookah here is also great (and affordable). Ordered food and drinks here which were also delicious (shrimp quesadilla was awesome!)The breakdown:- Make an online reservation have valid id and don't waste your time if you're under 21.- Hookah is $25-$35 (dozens of flavors!) and food and drink are $12 for plate which range from wings to sliders to quesadillas.- Drinks are $12 and they're delicious!- The chandeliers are gorgeous the vibe is great, very Harlem very chill.They automatically tip themselves 18% which is kinda ehh since our server wasn't the greatest but nevertheless I had a great time.",7,,

I really was not going to write a review about this place because it's not even worth that, but considering how awful my friends and I were treated I must warn the world. Management does not only suck at this place, they are clearly crazy! We received the the worst service, having to wait for 30 mins, then allowing the party behind us to be seated before us ( same party size), then being told we have to purchase 2 hookahs for a party of 6 or we can't smoke hookah at all..... O YEAH they also gave my friend house liquor instead of the mango Ciroc he ordered. After making a complaint he got a new drink that actually tasted like mango ciroc. Sad! Why are y'all trying to rip people off ? O and by the way we had to experience some crazy party arguing and threatening staff. WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON THE BOUNCER WAS HOLDING THE DOOR SHUT TO KEEP IS INSIDE WITH THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. My friend had to ask the bouncer to let us out of the establishment. Why keep a rowdy person inside the establishment and endanger everyone else??? Again poor decision making on managements part. SO if you are looking for a place to sell you bottom shelf liquor for top shelf prices, Rowdy people, unaccommodating management this is the place to be.**Tiffany you can not accuse everyone who had a terrible time at your establishment that night of being part of that rowdy group. Sadly,  if you had put this much effort forth with customer service you could have received a wonderful review instead of a bad one. Be more proactive. ***",5,1,

Updated review","It's clear that you ain't got nothing better to do than to keep making accusations that are clearly false. Like I explained to your ignorant self before, THAT WAS NOT MY PARTY THAT U CLAIM WAS THREATENING YOUR MANAGER AND BOUNCER!!! TRUST ME, I would have NO PROBLEM owning it, IF IT WERE MY PARTY!! It's clear that you don't have an ounce of professionalism & are continuing to accuse my party for making threats that CLEARLY WASN'T  us! OBVIOUSLY, this just goes to prove, if multiple parties are making similar complaints, CLEARLY it's FACTS & ya'll ain't doing your damn job!! So instead of harassing me on yelp & talking nonsense about my party making ""threats"", why don't you go occupy your time by seeing what improvements you can make to improve your terrible management skills & customer service!!! And you're VERY welcome for the feedback!! Now you be blessed!!!",3,1,

I made reservations a few days before the time I planned to go for 11:45 pm which was a Saturday night. I received a call for confirmation, which I thought was cool of them to do so. We arrived about 10 minutes before our scheduled time and was seated within a few minutes. I will say the server seemed a bit pushy for us to get our drinks and order placed but maybe it was because of the two hour limit on tables. We ordered a hookah (bomb), wings and fries(bomb) and drinks (bomb) and we were in heaven! I can't forget the music (bomb)!! The vibe was very nice and it wasn't too crowded. Everyone was having their own fun! I would definitely recommend checking this lounge out and I must add that it is black owned. One of the main reasons I wanted to check it out. Visiting from Alabama and what we enjoy in lounges I will say that we really enjoyed ourselves.",,,1

The day of my reservation I tried calling again left a voice mail and still so answer or call back. I arrived to be place about 30 mins after my reservation time and explained to the hostess about my reservation and that I tried calling but she told me that they gave my table away and that I wound have to wait at least an hour and a half for another table it was 11 pm at this point and I asked her to see if anything Could be done because I didn't want to bring in my birthday on the street. Finally I was able to speak to a manger and showed her proof that i tried calling and she worked her magic and got us in before 12!!!Soo ... the place is kinda small but very nice inside the waitress was very nice and attentive. We ordered the bob Marley hookah and the coquito both are amazing !! And strong !! I had the Harlem mule . We ordered some appetizers the fries were fresh ! Loved it also the quesadilla was good also. My friends ordered the sliders but I didn't try it. I would definitely go back here and arrive on time .

The hookah wasn't good tho, and it didn't last long and we had the pineapple head and ice hose. So they should definitely look into fixing the hookah to make it taste better and last longer with out the harshness or coal taste. The music was nice too it was a mix of R&B and hip hop. We came here after dinner so we didn't try the food. I'll try them out again but it's not in the front of my list. Also it was a Thursday around 7 o'clock when we went so the next time I'll come later and on the weekend and maybe it'll liven up a bit.",1,1,

62,Pourcher J.,"Cortland, NY",0,7,6,3.0,6/11/2017,"First of all I'm going to state some good and some bad. I found this place on yelp when I was looking for a place to celebrate my birthday dinner. Since I had more than 8 people who wanted to come I had to make a reservation. Any reservations over 8 people need a deposit for $100! You have to schedule your reservation at least a week before depending on what day you want to have it on (the weekends are very busy). I called a week in advance like the lady said and paid for me deposit. A few days later the receptionist said it didn't go through. I was able to pay over the phone the day before my reservation. Fast forward to the night of, my party of 10 became a party of 5 because everyone was running late. The lady who made my reservation (I don't know her name but she makes EVERYONE'S reservation) she was beyond rude and did not want to let us in. It was my birthday night so I just wanted to leave because we was embarrassed for standing outside. Luckily my bf spoke to the manager and she was nice enough to let us in. The manager was literally the sweetest lady and checked on me frequently throughout the night. If it wasn't for the manager I would of gave this place 1 star!! Everything is pricey and will add up so be careful. Oh and your deposit can be used once you are in there but the bill have to be together and the gratuity is 18%. My bill ended up being $149 even with the deposit already added so really it was $249! My Besttriend had a tab open and ended up paying $70 for about 4 drinks and a shot. This place is high end and NOT WORTH GOING TO.",9,1,

Updated review","Since opening the service in this spot has now gone down. I mean from entering, to sitting down, the workers are not warm or welcoming. We came in to the spot being told that they can only hold three ppl because they do not want it to be over crowded (understandable) then when two ppl left we were allowed to have our party of 5 enter but was told there are only 3 seats at the bar and 2 can stand. Ok whatever we went with it. We enter and order food at the bar and then a table opened up and we took it. Shortly after we were approached to say we needed to pay for food and drinks we never received since we moved from the bar. Left confused because we are being told to pay for something three times but our response was of course we going to pay but Janay(one we weren't told that policy when we said we are going to take that table and 2 we will pay as soon as we receive our food) Janay proceed to roll her eyes and went and got the food. She plopped the food down in front of us and put the bill down again. That type of service behooves me because I have been to Harlem Hookah a few times and appalled at the shift in service.  Shawna came over and changed our experience. She apologized for their behavior and continued to serve us. The workers need to be trained on how to speak and handle customers. There is a level of professionalism that should be maintained at all times. My party of 5 will definitely think twice before we come back. There are too many spots throughout the city that provide the same service to deal with this one. PleAse train your servers, hostess and busboy. Thank you! Food was good, warm! Drinks was good! Service was bad! Hospitality was horrible! Service and Hospitality is key to the success of a business especially in New York!",5,3,
65,Sammi J.,"Brooklyn, NY",507,8,6,5.0,5/9/2018,This was the best spot I've been to in forever. The service was amazing & the food was immaculate. I got the crab cakes and they were freshly cooked. My sliders where well done and juicy. I highly recommend this spot in Harlem. Bianca was my waitress and she brought out everything I needed without me having to ask her twice. She'll be getting a big tip from me.,,,
66,Jeffrey B.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,1,0,5.0,7/17/2017,"I went with a group of four people for a reservation that we had on a Saturday night. Our reservations were set for 9:30pm, and we got there around 9:15pm. We were greeted nicely at the door and taken to our table immediately.Sitting down for the four of us, I thought that the table they placed us at a tiny bit tight, but we sat and got comfortable after a while. I ordered some calamari with sweet thai chili sauce on the side. Let me tell you America, this is the absolute BEST calamari you will ever taste in your entire existence on this earth. It is seasoned to perfection and the tenderness of it is perfect; it's not too crunch and not too chewy. It has the perfect consistency. The sweet thai chili sauce was amazing as well, especially on the calamari. I ordered a Henny Punch and another drink that I cannot remember, but they both were good. The bartender's hand was a little heavy, so although the drink prices are slightly high, you will certainly appreciate it with the amount of alcohol you get in your drinks. The hookah we got was a mix of two flavors and it was very good. The servers are constantly coming by to check and see if your coals are still fresh. They are very polite and attentive to everyone's needs. The music was perfect there if you like Hip-Hop. Perfect blend of classics along with good songs that are out now. Music isn't played too loudly to the point to where you can't hear your friends, but it is loud enough for you all to thoroughly enjoy the ambiance there. I have been back a few times since my first time and I have been nothing less than pleased every single time I've been back. Highly recommended!!",1,,

71,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,4.0,10/19/2016,"Checked out Harlem Hookah on a humbug on a Tuesday night around 9ish.  They been open since October 1st and I have been meaning to make my way here.  We were greeted by the hostess and grabbed two seats at the bar.  The bartender handed us menus, but then it took him a little longer than expected to get back with us to take our drink order. When he finally took our order then another bartender came over to take our order again.  I am assuming maybe they were changing shifts.  Anywho I ordered a glass of Riesling($12) and my friend opted for the Red Wine Flight($16).  After looking at her flight I felt like that is what I should have went with.  I also tried the specialty cocktail called Lenox Ave, and I got it because I am a gin lover.  It was great drink but the salt was a little overpowering.  During the time I was there they apparently ran out of wine glasses and the staff was hovering over patrons for empty glasses.  For this to be a bar with wine flights they should have more than enough wine glasses, and especially on a Tuesday night.My friend ordered hookah as well, and I believe she got watermelon and mint.  I tried it once because I have a respiratory infection that would not allow me to enjoy the hookah.  The one time I did try it had a very smooth flavor which I loved.  We had people come by several times to change the coals, and they were very attentive.The establishment's decor is beautiful and has this clean and chic look to it.  The marble bar is what your eyes are immediately drawn to and also the beautiful chandlers.  The bathrooms are pretty tidy and have mirrors have the log illuminated which make great for photo ops. LOL.  This is a great place for large groups, and I recommend making reservations.  And this seems to be a popular place for people to celebrate birthdays as well.The place also serves up food and the chicken wings seemed to be popular with everyone at the bar.Overall, I can tell they are still working out a couple of kinks which is expected with any new business.  I will be back soon regardless!P.S. - They have happy hour for the month of October from 4-6pm.  Also, don't forget to check in and get 5% off :)",7,1,2

When I arrived, I was rudely told by security and a hostess to stand on line outside in the cold. I complied and didnt debate the issue. I was the only person on the line for 25mins. After 25 mins, I politely asked why exactly I couldn't go inside. His response ""its our policy. The place is packed. Your party is already here and we dont allow ppl to join parties after everyone is seated."" I called the birthday girl to let her know the situation. Within, 5 minutes I was allowed in the spot. I guess she spoke to the manager. The security guard and hostess seemed annoyed that the manager decided to override their decision.  Funny, when I entered the place.. it was not packed at all! Other than that ridiculous policy, the music was great, hookah was solid and the spot is cute. I didnt drink or have anything to eat. I live in Harlem and I love supporting black owned businesses but treating customers rudely and trying to act like the place is some exclusive celeb club is not cool.Not sure I will be back unless i come after work for a drink.",9,,1

I knocked one star off because we did have a short wait outside for a table and when we got inside there were many empty tables,  so the wait was confusing. As far as drinks go, I had the white sangria which I had to return, it was vodka based (unflavored vodka) and tasted like orange and cranberry juice with some fruit punch and LOTS of vodka.  Def not a sangria.

It wasn't even the fact that it looked filled to the brim inside either, there was some drama at the door that we found best to avoid.I decided to finally go after work on a Friday and made a reservation for a mere one for 10:30. I arrived at 10:15 and was seated! Not sure if the ladies in the line were happy about that, but I think they were waiting on their entire party.Decor is pretty sleek, the chandeliers are a fantastic touch against the white marble. It gives the venue a sophisticated edge that I NEVER see at hookah places. I got the vanilla hookah and it was, without a shred of doubt, the smoothest hookah ever. The owners mention on HH's site, that they're avid lovers of hookah. The quality shows! Coals were always tended to and if I had the lightest hint of harshness or decrease in smoke quality, they were on it. A pal decided she wanted to come through and when I asked the host about it, it was no issue. Initially she was told that she couldn't come in, but that was only because the doorman wasn't informed. Easily solved. She loved the hookah too! We're both hookah novices (aka we choke often lol), so the smoother the better!Drinks were so-so, I got something made on the spot as a suggestion by my waitress (it was essentially a strawberry lemonade with vodka) and a cosmo. Both were lacking on terms of liquor, but one was free so hey! I got the sliders which were a bit dryer than I would have liked, but my friend got the hot wings and devoured them like they were her last meal. My server, whose name I kept forgetting but I'm so certain it was Tatiana, was THEEEEE BEEEEEEST!! Though she was busy, she was attentive and super chill! Like, I would totally ask for her again! All in all, a really fun time! Recommended!",5,,
78,Jocelyn H.,"Newark, NJ",11,5,32,1.0,10/28/2017,"Super unprofessional!!!! Worst hooka spot I've been to! We came from jersey for a birthday party of 23. The waitress was horrible!! Rude and a nasty attitude! The general manager although nice, was not aware of the check in offer and could not control her workers! The owner was there and did not do a thing!!! We all walked out! The rude waitress should have been fired on the spot and if not at least sent home. None of the group will ever visit this establishment again. They missed out on a huuuuge check and gratuity. Was a horrible experience for the birthday girl!",3,,

I'm a vegetarian, so I am glad they have some yummy veggie options. I've had the fries, guac and homemade chips, and the quesadillas, all were yummy. I tried a few of their signature drinks too, which were great as well. I only had hookah once, but it was good (I don't remember which flavor it was) but based on the menu they have a lot of options, so for hookah lovers that must be a good thing! But I think it's great that you do not need to smoke hookah to enjoy this place. Also the music is always great a good mixture always has me dancing at my table. Will be back soon!",1,1,1

82,Rodney F.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,11,6,1.0,3/17/2017,"It's my first time here, and I was waiting outside like every other person in line to get it. We had a reservation which was good. The Maitre'd was very cordial and got us seated fairly quickly. She was also fairly nice. At this bar, they search mostly men for weapons which is reasonable. I had my hood on when I was outside because of the cold. The bouncer approached me and asked me if I had been convicted of a crime; I assumed he was joking so I said no. He then proceeded to ask me if I was a woman; I wasn't offended because I think women are great. He said he can't let ""chicks with dicks"" in. (I kid you not) I was shocked and I told him that was a very rude question. He said he wanted to know so he could search me and there were no surprises. This is NYC, im not trans but I felt that was incredibly rude especially in the current political climate. No one deserves to be treated like that and I don't think my friends will be returning. As someone who is an ally to women and people who identify as trans, I wouldn't advise that you visit here. Our experience was reprehensible",12,3,1

They will literally hold the door even if the inside is empty.  The owner needs to seriously address this issue.  They are unprofessional, tacky and down right egregious. I hope this lounge gets closed.  These people don't belong in Harlem.  There is no respect for the community or the historic avenue that this place resides on.  I could go into long detail of my awful experiences about this establishment.  Just take my and all of the other reviewers advice.  DO NOT GO!!! Currently contemplating doing a write up for the magazine company I work for about all of the awful establishments around NYC.  This one would take the cake!

They have a variety of hooka options that rival downtown. The atmosphere was modern and classy.  Chandeliers, leather sofas, marble countertops, etc. They serve finger foods and dessert. The brownie sundae was awesome!! Feeds a lot if ppl. They are open until 4am EVERYDAY!! I'll def be back. Thank you for the experience.",1,,
86,Jane S.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",42,8,10,2.0,8/15/2017,"The place it's self it is beautiful, waitresses were friendly and attentive. Hookah was decent, we ordered the mint flavor nothing crazy. Food was ok, we had the wings. The real reason I'm giving this place two stars is because I came on a Friday night to meet up with some friends. I was late as always and arrived at 1:00am, all my friends were already seated inside. As I approached the front door there was a group of 5 girls waiting in front of me, mind you it is raining and none of us had an umbrella. After waiting about 10 minuets I asked the bouncer what was the problem and why are we all waiting outside. The bouncer then told me the the place is closed and unless I had a reservation I was not getting in. I explained to him that my friends were already inside with a table and bottle already purchased. The bouncer then said he needed to know a name in order for me to get in. I had no idea who's name the table was under so I texted my friend and he sent the waitress to come to the door and get me. Even after the waitress comes to the door saying my name the bouncer still gives me a hard time and asked me where do I think I'm going??!?!  Then once I got inside the place was Half EMPTY!!!   The whole process of trying to get in was so frustrating that I honestly wanted to leave as soon as I got in. I will never go back. Huge disappointment and it was a bunch of ugly guys with baggy jeans fitted hats. Waste of my Friday night.",9,7,
87,Jessy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",221,174,370,5.0,3/18/2017,"This place is amazing! Kind of upset with myself for not coming here sooner! Athough the venue isn't huge, the ambience is extraordinary. Great music, customer service, and the menu selections. The hookah they provide is strong, meaning you actually taste  the flavor and it doesn't leave that annoying itchy throat feeling like most places. The FOOD IS DELICIOUS; the Southwest Egg Rolls with Avacado Ranch dip is a must,  the Sticky wings, and Thai Sweet chilli calarmari are just as good. Looking forward to coming here again. Oh and did I mention that they have their own snap chat filter!",2,,
88,Christian H.,"New York, NY",55,17,16,4.0,3/12/2017,"My girl made reservations and brought me to this lounge. (The woman underneath this post w. the big head ) we came here with a group of 4. Walking into this establishment I was blown away by the environment. The decor was unique and set your mind into a relaxing state. The Skittles flavored Hookah was powerful, and definitely will have you choke up. The Duke game was on . The music was smooth, featuring a range of artist such as 6lack, Tory Lanez, Disclosure, Drake, & The Weeknd. The drinks were strong/flavorful, and the server was attentive to our every need. The downside of this night was the host asking us to move to the bar after an hour into our reservation. (When you have 6 people you're suppose to have 2 hours at a table). Once we moved the host gave us complimentary patron shots for the unfortunate removal. Overall I would come back to the establishment, but on a slower night than a Saturday. P.S. - They are strict on reservations and arrival time.",2,2,1

90,Shanel T.,"Roosevelt, NY",75,99,409,5.0,11/4/2017,"This is my third time coming here, and I must say the service is really great. My girlfriend and I had made reservations, but she actually made it for the wrong day. At first they weren't going to take us, because his is a ""Reservation Only"" establishment. But she said she would sit us at the front if that would be ok. It was honestly the best spot for me and my girlfriend in the night. We were in the cut, not in the open, and got to have a great ""Girls Night"" First, let me say I actually really like that they do reservations on, because that means not just anybody can walk in there. Second, it's very organized and that is a HUGE PLUS for me. Very CLEAN!!!!! Let me say this again very CLEAN!!! The waiters, and waitresses are very nice, and helpful. Usually when I go to hookah lounge they always want to charge 5,10 or sometimes even 15$ for a hookah refill. However, here there's no charge for that. I guess when you are spending money on food and drinks already why do you have to charge for coal replacement. I spoke to one of the managers I believe her name was Sonia, and I had let her know that the service was impeccable, especially with our own kind. Service goes a long way! I came just to catch up with my friend so I only ordered the ""Mac Attack"", and she ordered Fries. I had a Jack & Coke, and she had a Jameson & Ginger. The hookah I ordered was a Mint with Strawberry mix, and it pulled very well. There hookah is on point and so are the hookah staff members. Maurice, if I'm not mistaken was a great host to my table and Blondie the host was very fun and down to earth. I would definitely recommend this establishment to my friends, and family. Thank You for the lovely service, and I can't wait to come back!",,,
91,Sharice M.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",10,4,1,2.0,1/30/2017,"First of I would like to say that I am a frequent customer of this establishment and have been here quite a few times since it has opened. Never had any complaints before this, Love the decor and the service and the crowd it pulls in.. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. My last two experiences here was the absolute worse.. With a reservation I waited 45minutes (unacceptable) And not only that but the bouncer was letting others in with no reservation at all. All Awhile telling me and my party there was no tables available, But when we finally did get inside the same guys with no reservation were at table. Once I seen this me and my party was completely turned off and just ended up leaving. I'm assuming he was only letting people in that he personally knew. But it was completely unacceptable. My second experience with a reservation made also.. I was told that it was a party going on with no outsiders so me and my guest would not be able to get in. Once again disappointed, I proceeded to show my reservation confirmation after being told I couldn't have made one for this particular night. Needless to say we ended up leaving. I haven't been back here since because of these two incidents, customer service means a lot to me in any establishment I go to. And I was not pleased at all.",6,2,3

93,Debreche G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,4,4.0,2/5/2017,"First off, this is a beautiful establishment. I was a little put off by a couple of things. One thing being that I was left to wait outside in the snow for the rest of my party. There was a snow storm so it wasn't extremely crowded. I thought that having me wait in the snow was a bit rude, especially since they were only excepting guest with reservations. But I didn't make a big deal out of it.  Once my party did arrive, we were seated immediately and the service was OK. We placed or drink orders to have the waitress come back 10 minutes later to ask, ""what did you guys order again? I forgot"". That took me by surprise because I swore she logged it into an IPad or something. Still that didn't upset me. She was sweet and attentive from there on out,  so I looked passed that. We each ordered 2 drinks. And a 2 rounds of botton shelf rum shots...We ordered a hookah with a the pineapple top and gummy bear and blue mist flavoring. We loved it.    We were a party of 4, and only 2 of us ordered food which were  2 orders of wings and the mac attack (which were not as cheesy as the IG pics). Our bill with tax and gratuity was $350-400.  A little expensive but we enjoyed ourselves. I would go back for happy hour. Hopefully it won't be as pricey. PS. The bathroom mirrors are DOPE. Check them out if you visit.",5,,1
94,Jevet J.,"Manhattan, NY",23,26,5,2.0,2/4/2017,"Where do I start? I had high hopes for this establishment and I was let down. First, when I arrived myself and other people were made to stand outside on line in the cold. The person at the door did not give us any indication about how long the wait would be and he ghosted. I was there for a party and texted my friend, he came outside and collected me. The other people had to wait outside for quite some time.Now I have read comments from HH where they say that the wait outside is necessary for safety reasons. I find this hard to believe, but if this is the case it would be useful to share this info with your patrons instead of literally leaving them out in the cold.Second, I ordered a drink and twenty minutes later it still had not arrived. Sangria just does not take that long especially when it's not crowded. I noticed later on when I went up to the bar that was not crowded to order a drink that service was snails pace slow. It seemed as though there was no urgency to take my order. Third, a person in our party was told that she could not come into the bar from that line outside because our area was too crowded, she asked if she could just go to the bar to buy a drink for the bday boy and she was allowed to, however, at the bar she was then told that she couldn't buy a drink and had to get it from the server because she was part of our party. Makes no sense. If she is not allowed to stay because our area was too crowded, how was she supposed to wait to order a drink from our server?All in all the evening was filled with hiccups. As a resident of Harlem I always want to support businesses in Harlem, but sometimes it really is difficult.Had to edit my review since Tiffany from HH replied to my review. I don't know who is Yvonne is, you assumed incorrectly. My review is based on my experience alone and wasn't posted to coordinate with anyone else.I will be more than happy to pass on the information, please provide an email address as I don't want to put my friend's personal information on Yelp.",4,1,2

We agreed that we still wanted it. Ok so he brings out the pitcher of Sangria and it had no fruits in it. I said to him ""where are the fruits?"". He said ""oh I can go put fruits in it if you want"" I said ""yes we would like fruits"". He goes and grabs fruits and starts putting them in the pitcher with his bare hands. Didn't use any type of utensil to pick up the fruit or put it in the pitcher. He starts stuffing the fruits inside the pitcher. He did this all within eye sight of us like this is a normal thing. Meanwhile before this we had seen him collect money from other patrons ,he even touched the computer screen to put our orders in and the kicker is while he was pushing the fruit in the pitcher ofcourse his hand would get wet and he would lick it and then go back to putting fruit in. I was so grossed out I asked to speak to a manager . The manager Fannie came and just looked dumbfounded. She didn't apologize or anything.

We waited for 25 minutes for the bussers to ""bus"" a table but I'm not even sure if that's what we were actually waiting for or we were being used to stunt to the public that this venue was hype and packed. smh.

I myself work in the industry and I'm aware of how others should be treated and how table rotation works. A guy literally came outside searching for a reservation and I told her they had left and she still refused. My friend was celebrating becoming a captain in the NAVY and they told us we had to wait despite calling in advance. I've been here on 3 separate occasions. We were disgusted and appalled with the treatment we received. The hostess 'Blondie' and whomever else working the phones lied to the bouncer and said they did not speak with us and I had to go inside and speak to her face to face in regard to the reservation. There was even a complete open table and she refused the seat us, explaining that her table may show up in twenty minutes. Then we all said our goodbyes to one another and 5 minutes later they asked how many and we looked back in disgust, like we weren't just at the door 3 minutes ago. Just all around bad and I've had the hookah here before and It doesn't even pull that well. Such a disappointment how they treat their own black customers who are coming to spend. Never again will I recommend attending Harlem Hookah. PISS POOR SERVICE! (Go to Sylvana's instead or Parlay Cafe at least you will be treated like a human being and not a dog)",,,

My friend ordered hookah, she said it was the best she'd ever had lol. The food was delicious! I was surprised b/c I was only expecting their hookah to be great. I had a really good experience n I will definitely be returning!",3,,
116,Daniece K.,"Middletown, NY",0,13,0,1.0,7/29/2018,"I visited Harlem hookah for my sister's birthday and I wasn't pleased. The host at the door was very unpleasant. Her face screamed attitude. I told her I had a reservation for 6 people and she rolled her eyes and just began walking. No greeting, no smile, nothing. She was not welcoming at all. You would think they would hire someone nice and friendly who's going to try to bring people in not make them want to leave before sitting down. As we were seated our waitress greeted us with a smile and she was extremely nice!!! I seen her running around the entire time waiting all the tables by herself with a smile on her face. She could be the host and waitress!  That is the only good thing I could say about that place. Besides that the food was disgusting. None of the food was seasoned and it was so over priced. The place is a hole in the wall. Everyone was sitting on top of each other. Then we were rushed off our table by the nasty host who marched around the place with an attitude rolling her eyes. She came over even tho we were still ordering their nasty food and weak drinks and hookah she said you guys have to get up. We didn't even finish all we had but we were over that place anyway. Mind you they tell you that you have a 2  hour limit but we were there for an hour and was kicked out. Prior to my review I read reviews about this place and also heard about this place from other people and everyone has said the host has a disturbing attitude and the food and drinks are weak and overpriced. I was advised to not go to this establishment. But I tried it out only because from my knowledge it is a black owned business. I love to support my people but I didn't have a good experience. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would recommend Corner social (amazing food , good music, friendly staff) , Lenox saphire( hookah, drinks, amazing food).",,,
117,Emmanuelle A.,"Bronx, NY",182,22,4,3.0,11/28/2016,"Overall pretty nice spot. Love the decor. If you're a Hookah Smoker, you will recognize that their Hookah is HIGH QUALITY. They can definitely work on spacing but other than that .. very nice area with great urban music. Drinks and the finger food they do have is ""ok"" ..*KEY TIP* MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS! It gets packed and the lines can be a long wait!",2,,
118,Tahirah R.,"Brooklyn, NY",139,11,4,3.0,10/14/2016,"Went with some friends on a Thursday evening.  Cool spot - chill yet classy, I would say.  I ordered the sliders and the mac attack (3 ways).  I asked the waitress what the three ways were and she had no idea.  I also asked that she find out and she returned without an answer.  I decided to try it out anyway - I eat mac and cheese everywhere.  The sliders were bland and had no sauce.  The mac and cheese 3 ways were 1. mozzarella and chicken 2. basic cheddar 3. unsure of the cheese, but it had a nice crumble on top and contained shrimp.  THANK GOD I WASN'T ALLERGIC.  It's dangerous not having that listed on the menu and even more dangerous that the waitress did not know that it was in one of the macs!!!  I also had the Harlem Marg on the rocks, which is their play on a margarita. It was purely margarita mix so avoid ordering.  The service was good and the waitress was sweet.  They all need to be more educated on the menu and the food was mediocre.  I am, however, still interested in the hookah. I personally feel smoking and eating is odd, so next time - when they've been open for a bit longer - I'll give the hookah a try.",6,,
119,Sliim G.,"Jamaica, NY",139,42,49,3.0,11/19/2016,"After 8 you need a reservation so make sure if you plan on visiting on the weekend you do that. That's 1.Decided to try this spot & luckily we were able to get a table. The decor is nice but the the spot is small. I love the marble tables, the chandeliers & how well lit the area was. The music was good. We were vibing & still able to hear each other talk. As a hookah lover, I was not pleased with the hookah what so ever. It was very harsh. The pull was whack. However, a very nice gentlemen came by & spoke with us offering his assistance anytime we needed but there was no saving it.  #dead...the coal is refreshed often. For food, my dude had the sticky wings that he said lacked seasoning. He wasn't too happy with them. I got the Mac attack all cheese cause i don't eat meat & im allergic to shrimp. It was good. Real cheesy so . Three cheese quesadilla was what it's supposed to be. We just got henny on the rocks so can't comment on the drinks. The shot was alittle skimpy.Overall, it's a new spot & recently opened so I'll definitely revisit for a second try. The staff was nice for the most part. My dude didn't feel like he got enough attention since he felt like the spot was small & more intimate then a typical lounge/bar.",2,1,

121,Charles G.,"New York, NY",1,1,0,3.0,10/16/2016,"So me and a friend came to visit this place last, night which was s Saturday. We ended up going there because it was 2am, (they close at 4am) it was new and I seen a few friends mention the spot on IG, haha. Now me Personally, I'm A HOOKAH HEAD! lol I'm sorry I love hookah so the fact that this spot was close to home I was so hype, I normally would uber to Dykman in a heartbeat! After Visiting I would give this spot and overall 7.5 /8 & it's only for two main things. Again as I said compared to other spots like Dykman (sh*t anywhere in Dykman) You know the dominicans don't play with their hookah, it's ALWAYS on point IDC which Resturant you go to and yet they have hookah at every single Resturant up there lol. This hookah at Harlem Hookah was not hitting at all, like the flavor taste a little off to me, I ordered blue mist and it was hard to blow smoke and then when I did blow the smoke it was low.Now listen I'm a realist lol when you smoke hookah you want to pull out you phone and take corny videos for IG or snapchat blow nice clouds. but the way that hookah was set up, yea not too sure about that lol. I asked the guy about the hookah and it not really blowing like I would expect it, he ensured me ""no problem that's what we're here for.. took it to the back changed the coals etc. & Still nothing.No I'm lying actually when he changed it, it was slightly better (by that time I was just a little over it) And on top of that there Air conditioner system is another ""something I would change"" it's like directly over you and it's blowing so hard that it's blowing the smoke from the hookah. And like I said I came to do hookah I wanna blow smoke clouds and the ac is just blowing the shit away lol that had me aggy as hell. --but listen I know I'm a bit of a jokester but overall this place is chill. The decor is BEAUTIFUL! it really looks nice as hell inside, I'm big on that. Really clean, the staff seemed pleasant. my waiter who was helping was really nice the whole time so their customer service I would diff give them a 10. We didn't eat I only order a drink a Long Island that I couldn't finish because I was already feeling a little nice and it was strong lol which is a good thing. other then that they should turn that damn ice box ac down and work on the hookahs some more and they'll be good.Sidebar: I was sitting right next to another group of people who were unsatisfied with their, what looked to be ""fried Oreos"". she told the waiter that they tasted like the chief fried the Oreos in the same oil he fried the fish with, said the Oreos tasted like ""fish whitings"" LMAOOOOO! true story I was crying smh the girl to the left me was fucking this Mac attack they have which is like 3 Mac and cheeses. Now I read another review where someone said that one of the Macs had shrimp in it smh it doesn't say that on the menu and that so scary because I'm allergic and I was thinking about getting that I'm glad k didn't smh they should change that up or warn people about that for sure.I'll probably revisit this place in a few months let them break in I hear they just opend up a few weeks ago anywho.",2,8,

She is more worried about helping her friends who come to this spot all the time then any regular consumers. Went her for dinner on Friday, March 23rd, 2018. The calamari was dry and on the tiniest plate I've ever seen. I had to ask the server to please remake our sangria because it clearly wasn't mixed correctly (the color of red sangria should be red right?) the kicker though- the hookah here is harsh. You will cough an be very sick the next day. This is my second time having hookah and it was so harsh both time I got sick. This is also another spot in Harlem when the staff needs a course in hospitality. Too be honest l, what are those old out of shape- rude bouncers going to do if something goes down? All I seen them do is speak to women in a rude way but let all the neighborhood bros come in (7 people to one hookah all night.) Don't waste your money.

They have lots of options for anyone more familiar with hookah.Menu has typical bar type food and the food was excellent. Sticky wings are a must!! Yummy! Also had the mac and cheese (plated and served 3 different ways)which was also yummy and the calamari; which was tender, not rubbery! I enjoyed the vibe of lounge and can't wait to go back.

The manager is an extremely rude person not sure how the heck she even got hired to manage this place. I'm all about supporting local businesses especially blacked owned (if it even is), but this place here is definitely no longer on the list. The staff needs a training in customer service, like ASAP!!!! What kind of establishment lays down rules about what you can't do as soon as your seated, before even getting a menu to order food and drinks. (This one does). Also after the 2 of us were seated our friends stopped in to say hi, they decided to order food only to be told that we had to order another hookah to our table because it was now 5 people at the table. Our friends don't even smoke hookah, they came to say hi and also support local business. We kindly explained that they didn't smoke hookah and were still told that we needed to order a new one, not a refill but a whole new hookah!!! After attempting to speak with the manager, which did not go over well at all she was just rude and nasty soon as she came to our table. We left and will never come back to that place. I advise you do the same. Never go someplace to spend money only to get treated poorly, doesn't make sense. Sad to say this place is harlem. #closeharlemhookah #newmanagement@harlemhookah.

My friend and I went to H.H for her birthday, just for drinks and hookah and I was just blown away by the sophisticated atmosphere. We were quickly seated..(As I heard you need RSVP for the weekends) we got a booth which I loved, Very comfy and cozy..great if you were on a date. The food was awesome, and I only had wings and fries. But I'm pretty serious about my wings and these were fried and sauced to perfection. (I just wish they gave more blue cheese). The drinks were pretty strong( just how we like them). We were there during an ""unexpected"" happy hour where the drinks were $9 for a margarita.. now I don't know what kind of happy hour that was but with the music and hookah..I didn't even care!! I usually pay less than $7 for any happy hour, anywhere! The guys kept our hookah lit all night, which was very impressive. I wasn't too happy with the service though and that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5! Our server never came back to check on us after our first drink, we basically had to hunt down the ""hookah guy"" to get our server to refresh our drinks. She got our drink order wrong as well which was another slight turn off, but nothing too serious..I was more bothered that my drink wasn't refreshed. It seemed as if she was the only server on the floor that night. And if so, I'm here to let the owner know..SHE NEEDS HELP! Service should NEVER suffer in such a beautiful establishment! I had a chance to met the owner, who was very humble and appreciative of our patronage. I was extremely happy to find out that this was a BLACK OWNED business, which made us spend just a little more money! This is a beautiful piece of Harlem and for my first time..I must say I was very impressed! The music and the vibe was on point!!! The bathrooms were clean and there was a tv built in the mirror that I thought was very savvy! Overall I really give this place 5 STARS!! But they have to step up the service!!

138,Brittany D.,"New York, NY",0,27,2,1.0,11/9/2017,"After my experience on a Saturday night at Harlem Hookah, you'd think the place was in the midst of a soft opening.  I was meeting up with friends, there was supposed to be a reservation for 6, turns out their record showed 4.  The place was practically empty, and instead of being accommodating, the hostess had a nasty attitude and neglected to be of any assistance. Two people in our party had to sit at the bar while the rest of us sat at a table.  Over the course of the nearly 3 hours we were there, tables remained empty, yet the hostess still refused to accommodate us. There was more than enough space for us to have all sat together at a table. One person spoke with the owner about our experience and the rest of us spoke to the manager Shay.  She was attentive and apologetic, but made the excuse that the issue was lack of communication.  She also didn't seem the least bit surprised at our complaints about the hostess.  I'm guessing this girl is a family member of someone and that's the only reason she still has this job.  Lack of communication has nothing to do with being rude to patrons.  When you work at the front of the house, you should be personable, friendly, and most of all communicative, NOT have an attitude.  If tables are reserved for hours later, people should be able to use them. This place has so much potential, the decor was nice, music was on point, and Shawna, our server, was amazing.   Don't waste your time or money on this establishment until they go back to the drawing board and teach their staff what customer service is.",,,

From the beginning, I should have left. As soon as my guest and I sat down we were greeted by our waitress. As she advised us of the birthday packages she kept continuing a personal conversation with a co worker which made it difficult to understand the items in which she was speaking about. My guest and I ordered our drinks and as the waitress was passing them out she spilled a full drink down my friends back. To make matters even worst she immediately cursed and walked off after realizing what had happened. After about 2 minutes she came back to our table and told my friend that she would accommodate her with another drink. Not sure if that was her way of apologizing but still not cool! The orders of food were completely wrong, the waitress brought other drinks to our table and to make matters even worst she attempted to give us someone else's credit card. The table next to us had the same horrible experience and walked out. All while the general manager was there walking around and did not do anything !

We had made reservations weeks prior to our night out. They give you a 15 minute grace peroid for your entire party to arrive. We were originally a party of 15 and then on the day of we where a party of 9. We all got there within the 15 minute grace period and were still made to wait OVER 30 MINUTES outside. The waitress kept telling us that our entire party needed to be at the venue before we could be seated, mind you we had explained to her several times that our party was there because several people were not coming and they still made us wait. Finally we got the manager out and although we ended up getting seated service took forever to arrive to our table. Mind you they act like the place is packed and when we got inside it was empty!!!! So why make us wait so long outside? The real kicker though was the fact that the manager spent more time smoking hookah with her friends at a table right next to us rather than running her business correctly. Who does that? If I could give this place negative stars I would. Normally I never have an issue there, but this particular night was horrendous and I will never be returning again.

After finally being seated, someone of the staff overheard me saying I was going to write a bad yelp review.

Music was definitely on point and it wasn't too loud where u had to scream at each other to hear what the other person was saying.

I didn't order food, tbh I was full and came for the hookah and drinks and I wasn't dissapointed. Me and my friend had patron margaritas and we ordered a hookah.

I even resent the email and asked if the email address was working with hopes that IF it had fallen through the cracks that someone would finally see it an reply. It is sad because I am trying to support Black businesses and of all the locations I've contacted about my birthday party, this is the only one that has yet to reply...and it is also unfortunately the only Black one.

156,Joi B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,2.0,10/22/2017,"Yesterday my friends and I were looking for a fun/chill place to hang out on a Saturday. We stopped at Harlem Hookah around 3:45pm and were greeted by a quite unfriendly hostess (I think her name is Dee). We were unaware a reservation was required (although the website says its required after 8pm). It wasn't what she said about us not having a reservation, we understood, it was the tone, facial expression and body language that was off putting. She did end up seating us and we were having a good time eating, drinking, some were smoking hookah. Another friend ended up showing up and wanted to join our table. We asked our waitress, Bella if we could add another chair and she did. When our friend arrived she was stopped at the door by the hostess. Confused I walked over to see what was going on. She told us she did us a favor by seating us without a reservation and she couldn't add another person. My friend offered to sit at the bar and she said she needed to talk to the manager. The manager, Fannie comes over with arms folded and a don't f with me face and states ""I'm not getting a ticket for nobody"" and walked over to the table to remove the chair. She then comes back and says she will make an exception but we have to squeeze on the couch. We didn't want the negative staff to affect our time so we continued enjoying ourselves in an uncomfortable seat.As the time went on the resturant began to empty out.  We couldn't understand why they wouldn't offer to relocate us to a larger area to accommodate our group - it wasn't like we weren't spending money. Overall we enjoyed our time and felt Bella, the security guard and bartenders were great! I hope for the longevity of this business, the hostess and manager are taught customer service skills. Again it is not WHAT they were saying it was HOW they were saying it.",,,
157,Cachelle M.,"Spring Valley, NY",1,51,5,3.0,1/8/2017,"Went here on a Tuesday evening about 7:30/8pm, good music  and this Place has cool mellow vibes. So my mistake was I didn't check the menu before coming because I was really hungry. I know other lounges to have more selection of food varieties but this one get had just simple appetizers. So word to the wise, if you are starving do not come here first, go eat and then come here after! LolAnyway food was cool, hookah was cool and service was good. Bouncer, hostess, and waitress all polite. So it was a total of 3 of us and:6 drinks, (3 henny rum punches and 3 rum punches) a pineapple head hookah, (blu mist flavor) and 3 appetizers later, (buffalo wings, calamari and chicken quesadillas) the damage was $Somewhere around $200-230 I believe. Taxes AND 18% gratuity was already included. I think they charged us incorrectly to be honest. I mean being that we didn't get anything THAT stellar and extraordinary from here, I would say over priced! If you break it down that's 1 appetizer, 2 drinks per person and we all shared a hookah. Lol, sorry for the. Real down but as I'm typing this I can't believe it. Now again with taxes and tip that's about $73 a head.... for what? Lol anyway Be forewarned: they DO NOT take any type of card payments without a chip embedded in the card! I repeat they DO NOT take a card payment without a chip embedded in the card!! I get that it's for those lame ass scammers who can't get a real job and make real money but it's kind of a drag. MCU happens to be a NYC based bank that doesn't have chips in their cards, (yet-2017) and they wouldn't take it as a payment. Like what if that was legit the only card we had? They need better ""software fraud detection"" for their system or whatever other companies use so they don't take the ""L"" when a scammer hits. Would I come back? Hmmm, maybe! But only if I already ate, had a slight buzz and just wanted to smoke some hookah n listen to music.",1,,

Probably in 10 minutes I realized why. The food, drinks and multiple hookah flavors were awesome, but  the overall atmosphere was what stood out the most to me and my friends. Just an awesome spot to chill and kick it. The vibe only got better as the night went on. Great music and staff also helped get the night going. There was a surprise marriage proposal and then some dancing. It almost felt like I knew everyone there. Everyone was just chilling and enjoying each other's company.  And that's what you want any night to be. The flow and table set up allow strangers to meet and become friends. I can't express how the cool the vibe was, literally no one in the whole place wanted to leave. Def a spot I will return too in the near future ! 5/5 stars all day!",2,1,

Updated review",Hi I came today as A walk in and the bouncer is telling me I can't get in because I have to reservations. Which is kind of Alarming because on the website it clearly say Friday and Saturday no reservations after 8pm. This is second time I have had an issue this is terrible customer . The bouncer name Clark would not contact the manager .,,,

161,Shaniese H.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,3,1,1.0,9/21/2017,First off let me say the atmosphere is beautiful that's about it! The manager at this place is HORRIBLE (ms.nicole) her attitude is by far the worst and the reason why me and my friends will not be returning! I know business will get slow because of her what manager brings out a flashlight and go through the customers food that was so embarrassing and uncalled for my order was completely wrong I was very polite to her she storms out the kitchen with a flashlight in front of other customers telling me my order is not wrong and her body movement was like she wanted to attack  I can't get over that she is disgusting and need to be retrained! As far as the waitress I can't remember her name I think one was Tatiana and she was training someone they were very sweet and polite and helped us through the confusion keep up the good work ladies and this is not the first time the manager did this people warned me about her and I seen for myself that day will never come back here if it was the last place on earth!,,,
162,Arielle P.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,0,1.0,1/23/2017,"Unfortunately beautiful place, but unpleasant.  I went on a Sunday night with friends and one from out of town.  We were told by the hostess that we had to wait, which wasn't a problem.  The problem is we were told to wait outside.  Its winter not summer.  I asked if we can go to the bar, she said theres not enough seats and you cannot stand.  It was 4 of us and I saw at least two seats, but I didn't even bother to look on the the other side.  I was turnt off.  She was dismissive and nonchalant which was even more upsetting.  She didn't even tell us how long the wait would be and we were the only ones waiting.  I am expected to go outside in 30 degrees weather and wait for how long!? I spoke to a manager she told me the hostess could of been better.  I just left no reason to stay, if it was summer no problem, but its lack of customer service. Why would I come back here? if it snowed they'll probably tell me to play and make snow angles while I wait.  They have their policy and I have mine. When you offer no solution or feel I'm supposed to know your policy cause I guess I work there too is crazy. I will not spend my money here.",1,,
163,Delvona T.,"West Farms, Bronx, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/18/2016,"At first, I thought it was a cool spot, good music, cool vibe but I was quickly bought to reality. Their Parton margarita was disgusting. The food was ok. We order the CHEESE slider but it seems as if the cheese were out of stock. It was more of a burger. The General manager was rude. To the point where he told my party and I quote ""No matter what, I'm going to make money when you leave."" At that point, we picked up and left. It wasn't worth the stay. They were lucky I'm classy and just didn't walk out on the check or made a scene. I would never go back there again.",4,,
164,Renee G.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,10,0,1.0,10/2/2017,"The food was good but they made an error of charging my card twice. When I reached out I was directed to F. Fernandez.

Stay away unless you like to be disrespected.",,,
165,Desi M.,"Brooklyn, NY",110,137,87,3.0,10/20/2016,"I was really excited to check the place out after the pristine aesthetic showcased by their Instagram page. After arriving, I was a bit let down, the pictures looked a lot different so maybe it was just a rendering. Still a beautifully decorated space! I love the light fixtures, the bar, and table designs. Very inviting decor and ambiance. I strictly came for hookah and wine, as I had already eaten the day of my visit. The hookah was very reasonably priced and coals were changed efficiently. I wasn't at all pleased with the fact that one glass of wine is $12, I don't think I've ever paid more than $8-$10 for one glass of wine. I'm in the industry and well aware that typical wine pours are 5 ounces, at $12 per glass that's a crazy markup. My friend ordered wine by the glass, it looked more like 4 ounces. I opted for the wine flight, thinking it was a better deal; 3, what looked like 3oz pours for $16. No way I'd only do one glass lol I allowed my bartender to choose the wine for me, since Cabernet which is my Red of choice wasn't available. I was very fond of his recommendations, I had a Pinot noir, a Malbec, and a merlot. The Pinot was my favorite. Being such a new spot, I definitely sensed areas of improvement as far as operational structure and general flow of things but hopefully in time they will iron all kinks out. I definitely will be back, I'm open to giving them another shot and hopefully being able to give them a revised 5 star review.",5,1,3
166,Nolo Z.,"Arlington, Staten Island, NY",248,1,0,2.0,3/6/2017,"I heard from a friend that this place was great and that I should try it out. I was told to make sure to make reservations being that you need a reservation to enter after 8pm on the weekend. So my friends and I made 2 reservations since it was going to be 8 of us. Being that our number went from 8 to 6 they didn't allow them to keep the other reservation. I arrived after my friends and thought everything would be ok with me getting inside, instead I was told that the reservation was at capacity. I mentioned to the guy at the front that we had 2 reservations and I'm not sure how we could be at capacity, unbeknownst to me they cancelled the other reservation and put my 5 friends at 1 table. He said he saw that there were two reservations and said that my friends had extra people because there were 8 people at the table, which was a complete lie. I contacted my friends and they had to beg and plead for them to let me inside the establishment to wait for them to settle their bill because it was freezing outside and your staff didn't seem to care about that or that there was some confusion with the reservations. Upon entering I could see that it was not packed and there was an empty table and space at the bar. In fact the manager came and removed the reserved sign off a section at the bar. I was never offered a seat they wouldn't even allow me to have a drink at the bar while I waited for my friends to figure out the situation. I understand you guys have a strict policy to prevent overcrowding and to give a comfortable experience to your patrons however there was more than enough space  for me where my friends were sitting. What I also felt was insulting was that there were people coming in who were joining another party that was at capacity but were still allowed inside without a hassle. They were even seated next to their party at someone else's table. Not sure if they're regulars or friends of the staff but I was left standing by the door for over 30min. I don't understand why you would chose to treat your customers, or better yet potential customer being that I was denied service, that way. I am completely turned off by Harlem Hookah's lack of customer service. I will never return and I will definitely dissuade others from going as well.",,,

Was told at the door (not when we made the reservation) that they have a strict ""everyone here"" policy or no seating. 15 people  showed up by 10pm and still nothing. By 10:20 the initial 25 had arrived but still we had to wait for them to set up. When we got in, nothing was ready and they sat us cramps din the corner of the space. This is a hookah bar with no couches, that require people to sit to be served. Then they started turning away members of party who arrived later (aka normal NY club time). They were making up policies on the spot about cards for food and hookahs etc. Which was confusing and annoying. Not a good venue for a big group at all. There was hardly anyone inside jut they wouldn't give us ""reserved"" tables (even though our party only continued to expand and we took over the space). Terrible service. Never again.",,,
173,Latrice E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",38,6,0,1.0,3/4/2017,"Yea this place is a no for me. I do understand the importance of reservations but just put this as a date night place. Even when I made a reservation I told the manager I just had one person who I haven't seen in years that just wanted to come by and say hi and she did not budge. The seat next to me literally was littered by coats, which leads me to say you really need a cost closet. I came here before and it was alright. There's tons of more accomodating places where the speaker isn't blasting in your ear in the Heights and Inwood.  We ended up going to The Kiosk which was very accommodating and did the actual thing I asked this manager to do which was can I have one person join. Cheaper and more chill. I gave this place maybe a year or so. Many have come through Harlem and many have gone due to minor things like this.",,,

Again, denied because they were ""at capacity""Finally found reservations available on opentable.com for about half hour later. When we walked in the hostess showed us to a small table directly behind her. When I explained we were there for dinner and that table would be too uncomfortable she rudely told us it was what opentable.com selected for us.

We were meeting people there whose reservation was just 15 mins before ours; there were able to be seated before us. Once were we let inside, to wait some more, we asked if our small party could squeeze in with our friends' party since the table next to them was about to leave. The hostess said no because there were people waiting ahead of us. We found out the people ahead of us were a much larger party and would not fit in the two seats that we needed. As time passed, we could no longer watch the seats stay empty and sat down. The wait staff was amazing, kind and professional. Most of us stayed for 3 hours or so. The hookah was tasteful but the hose kept coming out. The food: small bites but tasty. The owner gave us all free shots for celebrating two birthdays. The music and vibe was awesome! Overall nice place but it doesn't make sense to allow reservations to be made if they cannot accommodate everyone. We will be returning but during the week. Never the weekend!",1,,
180,Jasmine Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",187,2,0,2.0,3/4/2017,"This was my first time to Harlem Hookah. I'm sad, because the food (that I was able to eat) was delicious, and our waitress was very sweet and polite, the vibe was very nice and chill. However, I'm taking off three stars for two reasons:1. I'm not really sure why there needed to be around 15 men walking around policing people. It was extremely awkward and made me uncomfortable to have two men standing right outside of the restrooms to ""guard"" it, I'm assuming? Also, two of the men commented on my body which was very unwelcoming and extremely inappropriate. 2. We made a reservation for 5 people. Our fifth person arrived, and the manager argued with us about letting her sit. It wasn't until the waitress confirmed our fifth person, that she was given a seat to join us. We're enjoying our meal, then our friend (who came all the way from New Jersey) wanted to have a drink with us before heading to our final destination. They wouldn't even let her come through the door! The bouncer actually said, ""If you try to sneak her in, I will come in and drag her out myself."" That was extremely unwarranted and agressive. Then when we spoke with the manager, they finally let her inside, THEN she wasn't allowed to join us at our table or be served at the bar!! We ended up having to leave early, not finish our hookah or drinks so that our friend wouldn't be left standing at the front. The reasoning was ""The reservation was for five, not six."" It's one thing to have a policy, it's another thing to be extremely rude to patrons while dining and spending money in the establishment, and to be unreasonable. There was room at the table for her to sit, and if not, there were several empty stools at the bar for her to enjoy a drink. My advice: Please train your bouncers and managers to think and analyze critically rather than speaking to patrons as if they're uneducated and hostile. We would have happily stayed for another two hours, and spent more money if it wasn't for this behavior.",,,

183,Gelany M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",86,2,0,1.0,2/2/2017,"closed my old yelp account so have to repost from 10/28/16First and foremost let me start by saying this, Don't Believe The HYPE! Where do i start? Let me start by saying something nice. I was very excited about coming here, heard it was a cool new hookah lounge in Harlem and several people told me about this new spot, so why not check it out. Inside is very nice with chandeliers and white sofas, real cute. I had reservations for friday 10/28/16 for 11:45pm coming all the way from Brooklyn. Mind you, it was nippy that night. Me and my crew reached about 20min early. Do you know that they let us wait OUTSIDE in the cold until it was 11:45pm just to go inside? This is not a club! Anywho, when 11:45pm came, we had to sit outside even longer because they didnt have a table ready for us!! Yea, you know I'm pissed! No apologies no consideration whatsoever! Anyhow its 11:50pm and we finally get in. There better be some pot of gold in there somewhere the way these people went on. So...... you cant stand unless you using the bathroom or coming inside or leaving out. The tables are so close to eachother you might as well hug the person sitting next to you. The hookah was weak, had to send mine back and even on the 2nd round i wasn't impressed. Waitress said, ""hi, do y'all know what y'all want""? Really? How about, ""Welcome to Harlem Hookah, is this your first time here""? Another thing, my bill included the gratuity in the total. it was a party of 3 not 10 and the service wasn't good. for a new business that have A LOT to work on.

193,Coco B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/4/2017,Great place to relax and listen to good music while enjoying delicious drinks and awsome hookah flavors! The staff was super friendly and attentive. I will most certainly be returning to this venue.,1,,
194,Shanel S.,"Bronx, NY",0,12,0,2.0,3/18/2017,"I expected more. Especially for the prices. Yes you have to wait outside. The ambiance was nice, the place is small. Anyway my friend had her bday party with 15 guests. She paid for a table in advanced. When we got there, there were not enough seats for 15 people. The female waitress (can't remember her name) was very rude when we asked her about it. We were waiting for three more people and it was 14 minutes into our reservation, she pretty much said that's on them that they aren't here on time for a seat. What does it matter if my friend already paid for the table? And why wasn't enough seats ALREADY prepared in advanced? We talked to the female manager, who kindly helped us out and asked two other guests on the other side of the couch if they can move to another table so that we could fit our whole party. The waitresses and bartenders automatically get 20% gratuity so they probably don't care about customer service. There was a big burn hole on one part of the couch. The food was ehhh. Hookah ehhh. All in all I wouldn't return, there are better hookah places. For those prices you might as well go somewhere downtown.",,,
195,Marshia T.,"Berrien Springs, MI",0,1,0,1.0,1/19/2017,"DO NOT GO TO HARLEM HOOKAH IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PARTY! Initially the manager Tiffany was very helpful and makes you feel like you will be taken care of. Then when you actually show up don't call her because she will be in her office ignoring your phone calls. The food was not good, you're better off going to Manna's before you get there. The most important thing I want to let you guys know is they don't have their Cabaret license! Which basically means no dancing. The bouncers literally grabbed me to prevent me from dancing and said I could be kicked out smh. You are better off looking for a better place to celebrate your event. The only positive is that the hookah was good and they let you cut cakes without cake fees. Overall horrible experience and they will never get a dime from me again. They wouldn't get one star from me... Yelp won't let me take it back.",1,,
196,Rashay N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,3/12/2017,"I've been here a few times now and it's been great so far. The food is good, the drinks are good, and the hookah was as well. They come around pretty often to check is the coal in the hookah is up to par. And the music keep the place live. I've only been been here on Fridays and Saturdays so it was the energy has been great.",,,
197,Tiara L.,"Bronx, NY",2,21,5,1.0,12/21/2016,"So disappointed with my experience here. I never got to make it inside but the bouncer and mangers on duty were so disgusting. My friends and I made reservations for 9:30, half of the party arrived and they made us wait outside in the freezing cold for the other half to arrive, the other half were running a few minutes late due to traffic but the bouncer said he put it in their system (little tablet) that half the party has arrived and he did express that the reservation would be canceled after 10 minutes, we agreed and let our friends know. They made it within the 10 minutes, he asks for our IDs, goes inside for 1 minute , comes back out and tells us our reservation was cancelled... how???? How could it be canceled after you told us to make sure our party was there within 10 minutes?? They apparently couldn't do anything about it either. THEY DID NOT EVEN TRY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE! I Will never try this place again or recommend it. It's a shame, ruined my friends birthday plans.",1,,
198,Sophia P.,"Mount Vernon, NY",91,12,0,2.0,12/5/2016,"First I want to start with the positive and say the idea of this place is cool. The decor is nice and they play great music to satisfy everyone's musical taste buds. I visited on Saturday 12/3/16 and the experience could have been much better. The food was good but not original. The sliders taste like mini big macs and the sticky wings taste like Asian wings from BWW. We had a party of 11-12 and was accommodated within a reasonable time for us not having reservations (kudos for that), the waitress greeted us fairly quickly but we waited a long time for appetizers and hookah to come out and for someone to come back and check on us periodically. People that ordered things after us received things 1st. The waitress kept apologizing so we kinda felt bad and just tried to be patient since the problem may have been in the kitchen. Upon a few ppl leaving, there was a mix up with a beer that was ordered at the bar and not included as part of our bill. The bartender (don't know her name) brown skinned and a short hair cut reminded me about the beer and the person who ordered it. I expressed to her he paid for it and would ask him when he returned from the restroom. When he came out he said he had paid. I reiterated what he said to her again, and she then explained that the money he had originally given was not enough so she gave the cash back to him with a bill and because we were still eating, ""let him rock"". She NEVER said to him sir this wasn't enough, i attached the bill and the money back give it to me when you're ready. So he must have assumed it was change and never looked at it. So I said to her that should have been communicated and this is could have been avoided. Clearly this was all miscommunication but at this point I was beyond aggravated because this was over $8 after paying hundreds at our table. The bartender had an attitude while swiping my card. My friend came to ask what happened and as I am telling him the bartender chimes in and says ""the cursing is not necessary"" so that definitely ticked me off because no one was talking to her so I turned and said just that to her and we began arguing. I told her she was being very unprofessional and she kept going. Clearly, she was not afraid to get in trouble for acting this way regardless of she felt I was right or wrong.  After her talking tough and me becoming aggressive, she calls the security to have me escorted out.  Customer/patron service should always be an establishments priority. An employee should never conduct themselves in that manner. You can't offer A1 service with classless employees. I don't think I would ever return and will definitely spread the word.",2,,
199,Alexis G.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/5/2016,"Harlem Hookah is AMAZING! Celebrating my birthday here was a great decision! I wanted to choose a place that offered good music, good food, great drinks and of course Hookah! I booked a very large reservation and I wanted to make sure that everything would go smooth for the night. They are very strict with reservations on the weekend, which is a plus for me! I purposely told my guests to be there a half-hour before my actual reservation because we could not be seated if everyone was not in attendance. Thankfully, more than half showed up on time and we were seated right away. The food was delicious, the drinks were great and the hookahs were awesome. I love that they came around to our table several times through the night to refill our hookahs, without us having the ask. The owner even came by at one point to refill one of our hookahs. I love that the owners are very involved and helpful. Last but not least, I must commend the staff for doing an excellent job. It's not easy serving a table of 20, especially when everyone is on their third drink LOL. Tiffany was very helpful in providing all of the necessary details and information for me to book the reservation. It was also nice to meet her in person at the restaurant. Our waitress Briana was excellent. She was very attentive throughout the entire night and made sure we were all satisfied. Mitchell also was excellent and helped Briana throughout the night. There were a few others that helped out and took pictures for us. Thank you Harlem Hookah for a great night. I will be returning soon!",1,,1
