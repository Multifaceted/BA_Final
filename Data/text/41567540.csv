0,Will S.,"Fords, NJ",283,8,0.0,4.0,7/25/2017,"Wimpy's is your consistent side hustle that you know will always have your back. Wimpy's is that friend that Facebook always posts about in those stupid memes about ""Which friend would be by you  if you wake up in jail."" Wimpy's is a ride or die that'll make sure you're fed, well and ready to take on your day. They don't stay up late, but they'll get you your pizza cheap. They are the delivery kings. You will get your food fast. It is what it is. Traditional American food. The only thing I would change is instead of putting my mozzarella sticks in tinfoil it came in a container. Also wish I could order a milkshake on seamless after breakfast (lol?). But honestly they'll get me some great tasting comfort food in under 30 minutes (sometimes far less) and I am 100% here for that.",1,4,

Updated review","I got a Bacon double cheeseburger deluxe by calling in a pick up. The food was ready in 10 mins. even though there were 2-3 other patrons waiting. The burger was good, fries should be packed separately to remain crisp. Asked about the price 9 dollars over the phone cashier confirmed. Yelp menu says $8? Somebody needs to update.",,,
3,Rachel T.,"New York, NY",5,54,0,5.0,8/22/2017,"Can't believe it took me years to try this place.  this is the best burger in the neighborhood,  and the fries were good too. steak fries! now I want to try everything... the menu is so reasonably priced.  can see this being a local go to.  seating inside!",1,,
4,Nina T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,2.0,10/15/2017,"This used to be my favorite go-to place for takeout food fast easy and greasy. However, I feel that they are taking advantage of the new influx of migrants to the neighborhood, and hiking up the prices so I won't be ordering from them anymore because the go from $7 to $9 for bacon cheeseburger deluxe is ridiculous",3,,
5,Casey P.,"New York, NY",36,375,34,1.0,9/21/2015,"This is an unethical business that tried to cheat me. Beware.I came in here and browsed their extensive menu. I ordered quite simple and got the egg and roll. I noticed they had nasty coagulated pizza sitting out so I avoided that.I make a point to check prices on the menu so I don't get scammed (happened way too many times -- many businesses in the city do it). And sure enough, he charged me 25% more than the price on their sign. To preempt a disagreement I asked if they charged tax. Nope. I pointed out what their advertised price is. And then, as is customary for scam businesses, they pull a menu out of nowhere that has the higher price.An honest business honors the price on their sign, and never attempts to charge more in the first place. An honest business corrects discrepancies and makes it clear before the customer orders where such discrepancies exist.After repeatedly asking him to honor the price on the sign, I walked out without paying them, and with the food sitting there, wasted. Sometimes the only way a business will listen is when you deny them your patronage.The other way they'll listen is if you call the cops. Knowingly charging higher than the advertised price and refusing to honor that price is illegal.",7,5,2
6,J C.,"New York, NY",0,7,1,4.0,6/22/2017,"I've been going to this place for their burgers for over 10 years but it was their tacos that prompted me to write this review. Their tacos are deliciously simple and served on corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas, which if you like traditional tacos makes all the difference.  They are topped with plenty of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and accompanied by a delicious green sauce. I never thought I'd be getting my taco fix from a burger spot ^_^.",1,,
7,Tariq A.,"Somset, United Kingdom",293,3,0,1.0,11/6/2016,"Didn't send extra items like I had placed in my online order and also called to confirm they would send the extras. And my side of sausage was undercooked and it tasted spoiled I'm a chef I know bad meat when I taste it. Will not order from here every Again, at least grubhub refunded my money.",,1,

9,Samyy I.,"New York, NY",25,34,58,1.0,1/1/2016,"bread and French fries soggy smh very greasy just sloppy, I order a Bacon Cheeseburger deluxe a waste of my $ also the bottle soda was hot and flat",2,,
10,Kathy W.,"St. Albans, NY",49,1,0,1.0,3/29/2016,This restaurant STEALS PATRONS MONEY !!!!! I ordered a Grilled chicken salad last Friday 3/25/16  and was charged $8.50 when the menu clearly reads $8.00. I let it slide. Today I went on Grubhub to see what it would be if I ordered a salad to pick up and the price was $8.71. So I cancelled the order and called to place it over the phone. When I went to pick up I handed him my card and he swiped i walked out looking at my receipt and they had charged me $9.75. This is the shadiest restaurant who is constantly over charging their customers. I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau.,1,,
11,Alex A.,"Washington, DC",0,11,5,5.0,6/17/2015,"5 STARS for the breakfast ONLY! 10+ times ordered. Huge portions. Very Fast (15 min or less)...I just got my order in 10 mins. I ordered 2 slices French Toast, 3 Pancakes, 4 slices Turkey Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, 2 coffee for $12.Always accurate and Fast!",,,
12,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,3.0,4/20/2011,"This is my go-to spot for some of, if not THE, best pancakes and bacon in the city!  Always the same butter-drenched, syrup laden, big pile of bacony awesomeness!  I call them, put on my shoes, walk over, and it's ready and waiting.  Consistent.  Tasty.  And cheap ($4.50 for a three-cake stake and four sizeable strips of bacon).Awesomeness!",1,,1
13,Julia K.,"New York, NY",2,20,1,4.0,5/15/2012,"If you're looking for a classier McDonald's burger that's delivered to your door- Wimpy's is it!When I feel like giving into my demons and ordering food that will set me back a few days, Wimpy's is always my go-to! You get a HUGE amount of food for a little amount of money!I'm usually weary of places that sell tacos, burgers, and breakfast under one roof but damn Wimpy's gets it right every time! And get your money ready before you call because the delivery is the FASTEST of any place I have ever ordered! Even though I'm right down the block, I've never actually been in to the store so I can't comment on the cleanliness and I prefer to keep sleeping dogs where they lie! This is Harlem, y'all! Let's be real! Wimpy's loses a star for being CASH ONLY and closing up shop pretty early! But regardless, Drunk? High? Sober? Wimpy's is the sh*t! Remember to ask them to wrap the french fries separately (it keeps them crispy)!",3,2,
14,Roy H.,"Manhattan, NY",162,11,1,2.0,10/6/2013,"This place is blocks away from home, so when I 1st moved to the area I would frequent here, sometimes twice a day. The food is sometimes burned but for the most part is average...service is fast and polite but depending on who takes ur order and if they speak fluent English... might be a good idea to check ur order BC sometimes it's wrong. More recently the menu prices were raised a dollor or more on every item. Making a BLT $4.50! When bodegas and/or other restaurants, less than a block away charge $2.50 for the same quality food. Needless to say I eat other places now.... cheaper...and they never get the order wrong  ;-)",3,1,1

Updated review",Probably not ordering from here anymore. Why? 1. My boyfriend and I both got sick after eating breakfast from here today. 2. They didn't send everything they charged us for and when I called back the gentleman on the phone argued with me and said he wouldn't send the rest of the food unless I paid $3.50 extra. Huh?!Skip this place.,,3,
16,Alba U.,"New York, NY",16,116,2,5.0,11/7/2012,"We order from here all the time -  have probably ordered 40 times over the last few years - and we're never disappointed.  A diner-esque menu, but everything is fresh, tasty, and served in generous portions at very affordable prices.  It is a fast paced greasy spoon type place, but when I've been there in person I've always been impressed at how very immaculate it it.  We love the quickness of the delivery service and have become quite accustomed to looking forward to our no-cooking, no-effort, Wimpy's nights (or Sundays).  We are both loyal customers and so glad to have them in the neighborhood.",2,2,2

18,Joel B.,"Manhattan, NY",7,20,5,3.0,11/19/2012,"Usually quite happy with this place, but careful ordering the pastrami platter: the first time I ordered it, it was surprisingly good.  The next time I ordered it, they used some processed and (most important) horrible-tasting sliced 'pseudo-pastrami' loaf that was literally inedible and gave me indigestion for the next 24 hours from just two bites.  I should have called them right away to find out what they used, to be sure to specify next time I order, but whoever answered probably wouldn't have known or told me anyway, so sadly, I just chucked the whole thing and will probably just avoid ordering that meal in the future rather than take the risk.  Too bad.",1,,
19,Regina W.,"Oakland, CA",316,229,52,4.0,11/12/2009,"Okay, this place is literally steps away from where I live now.  Couple that with a craving for a bacon cheese burger that I've been fighting off for a couple of weeks, and it was pretty much inevitable that I'd order from here at some point.I was out late last night and slept in.  When I woke, I realized it was closer to lunch than to breakfast, and I still had that damn craving for a burger!  Good for me that I'd stopped by to get a take-out menu a few days ago.I ordered their bacon cheeseburger plate.  Their plates are basically a burger with fries.  I ordered a medium-well burger and lots of ketchup packs (I'm subleasing, so I've got minimal supplies.)  My order arrived a few minutes later.  It was great.  The fries were actually warm and good (sometimes that can be hit or miss.)  The burger was good.  My only objection is the bun was a bit thin.  That made it both messy and hard to eat the burger.  However, the burger itself was quite good.I can't order from here all the time, but when I'm craving a burger it's much better than the fast food options which charge just as much for their crap combo meals.  Plus, they're just steps away and will bring it to my door.",4,2,1
20,Alexa M.,"Queens, NY",188,34,0,5.0,6/23/2011,"I love Wimpy's - especially their cheeseburgers. I live right around the corner, and it's completely dangerous because I could eat their burgers everyday. Go check them out! Don't forget it's cash only though.",2,1,2
21,Nick C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/4/2010,"Beware.I called to order from this place today.  At the end of the order I told the man on the phone that I'd like to pay by card.  He said go ahead.  I did.  After I gave him the number he hung up on me.A short time later the delivery guy showed up, handed me the food and then asked for cash.  You can imagine how confusing this was, seeing as how I was given the impression the meal had already been paid for.  Long story short, we called the restaurant, they claimed they thought the SIXTEEN DIGIT number I gave them was a phone number. When I asked him how he could possibly think that he started mumbling an excuse under his breath. Then he sent the delivery guy back to pick up the food.The delivery guy also called my girlfriend a puta under his breath.",1,3,
22,josephina p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,2,5.0,4/6/2011,"I agree with the previous reviewer about the bacon cheese burger... While I'm a vegetarian, my roommate is a huge fan of the Wimpy's bacon cheeseburger and fries. The only bad thing is that when the burger and fires are in the delivery container -- an aluminum pan with a plastic lid -- sometimes the fries can get a little soft from the steam. They're much better in the restaurant, which as a location leaves much to be desired, especially in the afternoon when all the local school kids congregate there. The mexican guys who work here are great, and they always make extra efforts to feed me vegetarian tacos, always remember my name, and remember what I want as soon as I walk in the door. Also, when you order for delivery, the food comes in less time than it would take you to walk there. I'm still not sure how they manage to cook the food and deliver it so fast!",,,
