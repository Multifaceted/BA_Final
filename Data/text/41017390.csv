1,John C.,"Sandy, UT",552,785,5172,3.0,9/23/2018,"Not a great dessert place, all of the other places near Times Square were packed. When we saw nobody in line we knew what we were getting into and no surprises.Decent desserts but nothing that should be considered European or fresh or delectable.Probably won't ever come back but it was worth trying out.",3,1,4
2,Kevin G.,"Midland, TX",272,61,42,1.0,6/25/2018,"This was the worst $22 I've spent in awhile.  One bite from each of these and we threw them all away. We walked by the window and was immediately drawn in by the amazing-looking pastries and desserts. Once inside, we made our selection and sat down to dive in!  The majority of it seemed like not-fully-thawed-freezer-desserts.  I guess, seeing it's old school look and not reading reviews before we went in - we learned a lesson.  Lastly, I will say that I've heard other foods from other countries were not as sweet as it is in the US but there was no flavor to go with the lack of sugar!  Idk this may be a bit harsh, but it was not what I was looking for on the streets of NYC!",,,

4,Ping K.,"Lake Oswego, OR",163,130,1223,3.0,2/10/2018,"This cafe belongs to a franchise and they have quite a few in NYC. It's a fast food chain without the drive through window and with yummy dessert and pastries. Better interior though compared to other fast food franchise. Their menu is pretty simple, mostly American breakfast: omelet, sausage, bacon, toast, coffee and tea etc. service is fast and it's pretty convenient to get your fresh made breakfast and consume it in the store. A good place to have group meet-up. And lots of pastries to choose from. I ordered their veggie omelet and it came with potatoes and toast. They are ok. On scale 1 to 5, I would give them a 3. Got to say the busboy was pretty nice and helpful though. Convenient location - a plus!",,,
5,Lyubov L.,"Leander, TX",72,120,577,5.0,8/20/2018,Very delicious  desserts. Love  their napoleon  They have a great selection of European cakes and dessert selection. Convenient location. They have regular lunch and dinner options for to go. It's kinda deli place. The cashier was really nice and gave us good dessert recommendation.,,,
6,Diana Q.,"Babylon, NY",397,835,1431,3.0,9/22/2017,"Visit Date: July 29, 2017I wasn't overly impressed with this place. Hubby and I decided to have a coffee date here after we saw Phantom of the Opera. I ordered a cappuccino and got a linzer tart (as a cheat). Hubby got a danish and coffee. The cappuccino was alright and so was the linzer tart. I didn't find them to be spectacular but I didn't hate them either. Overall I would say this is a three star pastry place. It will not wow you but I didn't dislike it either.",2,1,2
7,Amy N.,"Bristol, PA",171,289,46,4.0,3/13/2018,"The best hot mocha in the neighborhood I've found so far!It looks like a sitdown venue from the street, but you can absolutely pop in and out, to grab something and go, which was all I was looking for. So glad I did! It was so good, I may forsake trying a new place next trip and just stop here again (which is saying something!)",,,
8,Yesenia R.,"Newark, NJ",95,355,551,3.0,2/11/2018,"After a horrible dinner, we decided to try this place for dessert and coffee and was very happy with our choice. Everything was fresh and yummy.

9,Kathy T.,"Saylorsburg, PA",9,234,325,4.0,7/3/2017,"We sure weren't disappointed- great decision on our behalf. Place is located in Time Square, we walked past and all you can see is a variety of amazing cookies and pastries in the window. So we turned around and and decided to try them out. When you walk in they have a deli case, salad bar/ case full of fresh veggies and a case full of pasteries, cakes, cookies and cupcakes. Store has a a nice sitting area inside. While we were lucky and able to get a table to enjoy our order, we notice the sitting area be cleaned twice and the restroom checked for cleanliness. We had ordered two cups of coffee, a slice of there apple crumble cake, which was moist, full of flavor and apples crisp to the taste and a slice of baklava, which was flavored evenly with honey and nuts. We were happy with our choice and will be back on our next trip to New York to try some other kinds of dessert.",,1,

11,Amanda C.,"Long Island, NY",103,52,67,4.0,7/8/2017,"So disappointing that more bakeries in NYC don't have cannolis, all afternoon long I had been craving one and popping in and out of different places, until I finally found this place! Everything looked delicious! The cannoli I had tasted fresh, and definitely hit the spot. Coffee was also ok. Also plenty of seating while I was there! I'll definitely be stopping by again!",1,,
12,Jen S.,"Brookline, MA",143,302,203,3.0,12/27/2016,A fast but super busy place next to the Westin at Times Square. I had a craving for crepes and they make them!  I got the chocolate banana and toasted almond crepe. By husband got the spinach and mushroom quiche. Very yummy! The 3 stars is not so much for the food quality... it's more for the atmosphere and attitudes of my fellow tourists (aka table vultures). We were lucky to get table (on Christmas morning!) but geez. I'm glad I got to satisfy my crepe craving. :)Don't come in if crowds stress you out. But do come if you want decent food in the tourist capital of NYC. :),,,
13,Sharon F.,"Secaucus, NJ",29,25,28,4.0,1/21/2018,Great place for a bite to eat with vegetarian and vegan options. I enjoyed the spinach pie here last time.

16,Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",352,557,1849,3.0,9/20/2016,A decent place to duck into to get out of the craziness of Times Square. The place is very cozy and if you can score a seat..well..you're luckier than others.The staff here was nice..no problems with them.The only issue with this place was that the baked goods just looked better than they actually tasted. They looked absolutely amazing..they tasted just about average. Not terrible..but nothing close to what you're imagining when you see them in the cases.,,,
17,Jackie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",395,289,353,2.0,4/14/2017,"The food looked good, but tasted awful. We stumbled upon this place as we were walking along 8th Ave and decided to get some breakfast pastries. It was about 9am and most of the breakfast pastries were out already. We got a danish and some croissants. The danish wasn't very good and the croissants tasted old. The outside was hard and tasted like it was made days ago. This place has some seating inside, but gets crowded. There was only one person working the pastry/coffee side, so it took a little wait to get our food. The worker was working as fast as she could. I think they need another person to help her out on that side. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to other people. It wasn't very great and just disappointing.",,,
18,Sarah G.,"Midland, TX",85,560,428,3.0,6/24/2016,"We found this place while walking back to our hotel a little after 9pm... The desserts in the window drew us in for a sweet treat. Everything looked over-sized. Big cookies, big cupcakes = big waistline? Calories don't count on vacation, right??My mom and I shared a gigantic cupcake! $3.75.The lady behind the counter was not friendly at all. I partially blame it on it being late and she probably wants to get the f**k out of there? Maybe?? I don't know. Anyways, the cupcake was ok. We got yellow cake with white frosting (with rainbow sprinkles). The cake part was a little dry. The frosting was good. Love me some buttercream.",1,,1
19,Wendrich J. M.,"New York, NY",77,162,518,1.0,6/21/2016,"After a long day at work, I got off at Port Authority Bus terminal and decided to walk north, to find Europan Cafe with an attractive display of food that when you are hungry definitely work.I ordered a chicken and rice soup and the house salad which is based on Greek ingredients and grilled chicken. The salad looked good, so I started eating right away to suddenly find out all the dirt encrusted in the lettuce. WTF??? I stayed calm for a bit and continued eating the soup. I didn't want to make a scandal since the person who took care of me was really nice and friendly. But it got in my nerves when I kept finding dirt and rocks of mud in the salad.I went to the counter and none of the people there were the ones present when I bought my food. The lady seemed to be the owner of the franchise or the manager (a total b%t#h) I told her that I've bought that salad because I was hungry, and that they are supposed to take care of the quality of what they sell.She basically blamed it on me and said ""this is a special lettuce that we get"" the lettuce didn't look special at all, total crap. I kept asking her if they don't wash it and she kept saying ""this is a special lettuce that we get"" then she realized I was right and only said ""It's not your fault"" I told her since the beginning that I didn't want my money back, I just wanted to let her know. I should had asked for my money back. This place is a total bullshit except for the counter guy.Before I left she didn't even try to satisfy me as a customer. I hope not to get salmonella or e. Coli because I will be going into others mediums. Remember that even when the lettuce package says""pre-washed"" you have to supervise that it's clean and rinse it if needed. A total disaster, never go to this place even if you are a tourist. Food only look good, but the sanitation is a zero!",1,,
20,Kenya M.,"West Orange, NJ",122,188,808,3.0,4/2/2017,I was drawn in by their vast display of desserts! I decided on a huge red velvet cupcake that was $3.75. It honestly wasn't anything to write home about!! The icing was good but the cake was extremely dry. The place seemed clean for the most part but I wasn't there long enough to scope things out. There was no line so I was only in the store about 2 minutes. The customer service was so-so. I probably won't go back.,,,
21,Christina S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,78,10,3.0,8/19/2018,"The sandwich was good, the cupcake and cookie were not so good. I asked if the baked goods were from today and they said ""yes"" but tasted like they were not. I only took 1 bite of the cupcake and a few of the cookie.",,,
22,Scott V.,"Pequannock Township, NJ",505,314,703,5.0,12/28/2016,"Pretty place, fast service, freshly made goodies.  My wife and I usually stop here before heading back home for some Flan to bring back - and it's to die for!!!  So good and fresh!  We took in lunch for this visit and again, fast service, fresh, yummy food, priced right!  I ordered the Prosciutto and Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich, with sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and extra virgin olive oil.  A very generous amount of Prosciutto and the combo of the ingredients really made the sammach!  They have quite a bit of sammachs, salads and grilled food options as well as desserts to choose from.  You need to get lucky to get a table, as there's not much room, but do you walk out of a place that's small and busy?  Not this guy!  Very Highly Recommended!!!",8,5,6
23,Donna P.,"Red Bank, NJ",754,568,3199,4.0,12/2/2016,"I'm rather impressed with this place. Food is made fresh constantly and everything from the salad bar (not serve yourself), to sandwich station and bakery is great looking.  The selection of veggies for a salad was fantastic. Right across from Port Authority.  Prices were decent.  Liked food so much I did sandwich takeout for my family and purchased cannoli. Serves all day from breakfast to late night snacks. In the sometimes chaotic streets of NY it is a wonderful to find a place that sells healthy and delicious food in the later hours. Busy but moved customers thru fast. You put you order in and they call you when it's done. There is a good amount of tables for eating and relaxing. This was a great accidental find and I'm definitely returning to this place soon.",9,4,6

28,Harshvardhan M.,"Wisconsin Dells, WI",55,6,9,4.0,3/23/2017,"Like many others, I was drawn into the cafe by the immense display of cookies and pastries. The amount of cookies and pastries had earler driven me away, for I thought the cafe wouldn't have a high churn rate and most products may be old. Took the risk and gave it a try. I am a satisfied customer. Now I have to avert my eyes whenever I pass this place by, for the scent, the image, and the memory of the taste may lure me in like a sailor to the siren's sweet delectable notes. Have tried only two food items so far. The eclairs and the oat & raisin cookies. The cookies are so light, it's like they were made in an other worldly oven. The taste fresh, u want to take a handful and put them in your mouth. They have a slight burnt after taste, but it blends in nicely with the taste of the cookie. The eclairs, has a creamy inner layer. It is sweet but still the right amount. And you just want to eat one bite and stare at a little, for you would want this moment to go on and on. Looking forward to trying more stuff here.",2,,
29,Tessa S.,"Amarillo, TX",190,14,0,5.0,1/6/2018,"While staying at the Westin, we ate breakfast here every morning and tried something new everyday.

30,Netta L.,"Syosset, NY",1,178,1,2.0,4/8/2018,Only because it's convenient. This place is overpriced and a zoo. Employees are friendly enough. Does not seem like the baked goods are fresh. I was craving a sprinkle cookie. It was 4 bucks.,,,
31,Eyad A.,"Mason, OH",0,6,8,1.0,9/30/2017,Watered down coffee. Dessert is old and stale. Not worth the price at all. Definitely lacking in service and food quality,,,

33,Christine B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,0,5.0,1/16/2017,"We popped by this place earlier in the day, drawn in by their cookie display. They did not disappoint, reasonably priced and quite yummy. Later in the evening...much later...with a crowd of nine, and a starving teen (who clearly was about to die...insert eye roll)...we recalled that this place was open 24 hours a day. Winner!!!Ended the evening with an omelet, French toast, paninis, French fries, smoothies, and a giant hamburger for the afore mentioned teen. Full bellies and no one was harmed from Sir Hangry. (Late at night plenty of seating and attention from the staff...fixes some of the comments from others.)",,,
34,Daniel B.,"Augusta, GA",2,190,335,4.0,9/15/2016,My friend and I stopped in here the other night for a quick late night dinner.  I went with a fruit topped yogurt and a chocolate chip fudge cupcake and my friend got a fruit bowl. There was nothing special or amazing about the flavor of the yogurt or fruit bowl but I wasn't expecting anything amazing. The cupcake was very delicious though and I highly recommend trying the cupcake.  Overall it was a bit pricey and the cashier wasn't the most friendly person. She seemed annoyed that she had to take extra time to put our food in a bag because it was take out.,,,
35,May N.,"Union Park, FL",49,14,21,1.0,6/23/2016,"The service was horrible this was our first time hear , we where looking at the menu decidedly what to order , like at every restaurant/cafe and the guy was yelling ""NEXT"" ""who ready"" with a bad attitude and the nasty face he had . The food we order was Black Forest ham sandwich and a panini turkey club with a coke . The best was the caned drink the sauce on the panini had this weird sour taste and the sandwich bread on the black first was hard a rock , I kid you not . Please stay away an go some places else but the dessert look good didn't try one . For both plates it was $23.00",1,,

40,Michelle S.,"Levittown, NY",11,27,59,3.0,2/15/2015,Found this place looking for a quick desert spot in the city. The outside window displayed a nice selection of cakes and cookies. I had to go in. They have two counters so if you just want a desert you order quick as the other counter make sandwiches which i also had. Service was fast and very accommodating. The sitting area is small like all spots in the city but the tables are not tended to. so people are just sitting around taking space with no food. One guy was sleeping in there. Thats where they earned the 3 stars. Great for take out but sometimes you want to eat in..,1,,
41,Seneca W.,"Westfield, NJ",0,59,46,4.0,3/20/2017,"We popped in for a quick bite, mostly because the sweets in the window looked amazing .   Got a turkey sandwich with (a lot of) bacon - yum, and a giant chocolate cupcake. The sandwich was really good, with chips and pickle. The cupcake was meh.

42,Sean E.,"Centerport, NY",198,246,127,3.0,11/12/2014,"Not exactly hopping at 3 AM, which suits me just fine. What didn't sit well with me was a wait time to order like it was the height of breakfast. Dude was just really taking his time. Price-wise, it's Times Square. I could have gotten a burger at White Castle for like a fifth of the price, but hey, ""treat yo self"" and all that.Once I finally got my order in, I was served at a respectable speed. However, it wasn't quite fast enough to stop me from spotting the nasty rips on the chair and strange smears across the table - it made me glad I was getting it to go.Food-wise, I feel like more credit should be offered to the miracle that is Jack Daniels BBQ sauce than any particular preparation on the part of the Europan staff. The bread was a bit dry, the meat was plentiful, though a bit cheap - nothing that really wowed me, but it was certainly decent enough food.As middle-of-the-night meals go, you could definitely do worse, but there wasn't much to entice me back next time.",2,1,1
43,Alessandro M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,1/17/2017,"Relaxed, clean, good atmosphere for the location-- a block away from several of the busiest spots in downtown Manhattan. Service was excellent. Ordered a ristretto (short espresso, ¢75 elsewhere) and got a $3 shot cup of drip coffee. Price was expected due to location, but quality was severely lacking for a place aiming at European products. Did not try the food but it looks appealing. Some top-chart music but it's low and not intrusive. No electric plugs on the walls, at least in the back.Overall, a good spot for a quick snack or to-go pastry (AFAIK), but don't plan on getting any work done here unless you have a long battery life and don't care about the coffee.",,,
44,Peter N.,"Lafayette, LA",530,724,2446,2.0,4/28/2012,"So, while visiting Time Square, we decided to get a quick bite without even looking up places.  And we happen to tumble upon EuroPan.  Big mistake.  We had the following:- Baklava: it was nutty, and all, but not that great to be honest- Carrot Cake: moist, but also wasn't that great- Strawberry Smoothie: they use fresh strawberries, but man, no sweetener at all? the smoothie was so tart!We won't be going here ever again.",1,,
45,Becky L.,"Portland, OR",87,125,244,2.0,5/13/2015,"Not a big fan. The plan was to walk around the nearby theaters and see if there were any rush tickets to purchase while I was in town for a few more days. Finally snagged some student rush ones and had time to kill before the curtains would go up. Wandered and wandered but didn't want to go to some fancy sit down spot. Stumbled upon Europan as it seemed decent and somewhat quick. The desserts caught my eye (even though I didn't purchase anything). The cookies are appropriately ginormous and the circumference of a woman's hand. I resisted and just went for a meal. You can create your own pasta dishes, opt to create your own by choosing your pasta and sauce, or settle for a salad or sandwich. Pretty basic. I went for an Angel Hair Primavera because the description of it on the board looked healthy. It didn't taste healthy. Their ""light cream sauce"" was especially heavy on the cream. I seriously felt like I was drinking the cream and licking a stick of butter right after. I seriously only had a few bites of it and left. The employees were nice enough, but other than that, this wouldn't be a spot that I'd recommend to anyone. Maybe their desserts are better? Who knows? I'm leaving town soon so I will never know.",,,

My mother ordered a red velvet cupcake. It was terribly dry, as if it had been sitting out for days.When I took it back up to the manager, he told me I could trade it in for a different one of their plastic wrapped cakes because they were the same price. When I asked for the red velvet cake instead, he told me I would have to pay two more dollars. Not a chance!

Updated review","Honestly the most frustrating experience EVER!!!I called in at about 9:30am for 3 breakfast sandwiches for my coworkers and I.I tell the girl on my phone my order and she then says so ""One bacon, egg & cheese"" I tell her no 2 just 1 in a wrap. I can already tell he's not listening.I give her my telephone number 3-4x and then give her my credit card number for the order. About 40mins go by and I had a feeling she still didn't have the right number. When I called her back she said that my card read error. I asked her if she had the right number she said ""Yes"" I repeated the number she says ""Yes"" your card has an error. I tell her fine. I'll pay cash. She then tells me the driver left to come her 20mins ago & I asked her to call me or give him my correct number so I know when to go downstairs.She calls about 3mins later & said he's downstairs. I can say that I was down stairs for about 15mins before I see the delivery person coming up the stairs.He then hands me the receipt which I can see has the INCORRECT card number..  & says I owe $30. THIRTY DOLLARS for 3 breakfast sandwiches and a small orange juice when the menu has clear pricing. I told him that  was not right & he tried to call in but could not. So he took down my number & said that he would have her call me. I didn't receive a call or even an acknowledgment. The Delivery guy gets the Star or not this place. He was very nice & helpful.I will NEVER order from this place again.",,,

58,Daniel R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,28,0,2.0,3/16/2017,"My burger was okay--nothing fancy, very barebones. It was tasty. My wife's veggie burger was really weird. I have never seen corn and broccoli in a veggie burger. She did not like it. It's a bad sign when the highlight of the meal is the bun. The cookie we got looked amazing but wasn't that good. It wasn't expensively, but there are definitely better places out there.",,,

61,Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",230,692,861,4.0,12/8/2012,"The EuroPan Cafe is on 8th Avenue just west of Times Square in New York City.  Here, you go to the counter and order from a fairly large list.  Everything is made fresh.The Cuban Sandwich I chose was very good.  Big, too.  It was served as a Panini rather than on Cuban bread.  But, the crust on the heated panini was very reminiscent of the real Cuban bread.We returned later in the day as we were leaving the city to get some of their baked goods.  Wow.  If you are around Times Square, EuroPan Cafe may not be glamorous, but you can have a fine meal with a great pastry desert for a fair price.  Who would have thought?  Right in the heart of New York!",,,

Thank God we could find a table at this cafe on a busy Christmas weekend. The selection seemed really good, so I guess that's a plus. We both had a chocolate croissant with a cup of tea and coffee. All was good enough. Cafe is a little cramped, service not particularly friendly and there was an employee crying at the table next to us. Other than that, it was all good.",,,
63,Epic S.,"San Francisco, CA",25,51,38,5.0,1/24/2015,"Although I wouldn't recommend this as a ""must visit"" place to eat, I personally love the food here. I've tried many of their different paninis, but always fall back to the Chicken Parmigiana Panini. There's usually not much seating, so I recommend taking it to go, and walking around the block to Times Square's red bleachers.",,,
64,Shyam S.,"Charleston, SC",350,756,81,2.0,3/12/2014,"This is an expensive, tourist trap - plain and simple. They trapped me because it wasn't packed like every other place in the Square and it was also raining, which can make NYC miserable. I saw a mountain of pastries in the window and was hooked. I paid $9.52 for a chocolate croissant that was so devoid of chocolate that the guy from ""127 Hours"" could have been trapped inside; an average danish that the staff didn't even offer to heat; and a Diet Pepsi. I agree with the other reviewers that the staff here are not overly helpful and don't really seem to care about customers; they are just trying to get through their shifts. I think it is hilarious and ironic that this place is called ""Europan"" on purpose - as if they dropped the ""e"" because they weren't sure how to spell ""European"", which makes sense, since there is nothing really European about this place.",1,3,
65,Laurie H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,14,0,1.0,7/25/2014,"The only reason I give one star is because there are no negative stars available.Worst service in NYC I have ever experienced. Let me restate that.....worst service I have ever had in any restaurant. Ever! Down right rude! My son was asking a question, was completely ignored, until he started speaking Spanish to the counter person he was directing the question to. I was spoken to as if I was an idiot, not a customer. It was not one, but every person behind the counter. They seemed to feed off each other. They were the same with every person in line. It was a  half hour In line for ordering. I could continue with more bad service examples, but I think you get the point. The only reason we did not leave, is we had others meeting us and time.The reason I am so shocked is, every time I visit NYC, I am amazed at how friendly everyone is. I'm from California and before traveling there, I had always heard the opposite. But I think NYC has very friendly people, from servers, to sales people, to the guy on the street. This was the first  negative experience I have had in NYC.About the food- small portions, mediocre quality, like a fast food restaurant quality. Average price for NYC.Never going back",,1,
66,Tashi B.,"Corona, NY",11,47,1,3.0,2/18/2014,"I can't speak on the pastry stuff but I will say they looked pretty freaking good and the cookies are HUGE and appealing but I didn't purchase it. It was about 1:30am and I wanted some mexican food so bad, and magically I look at their menu above the cookies and I seen ""QUESADILLA"" in white letters but it sparkled from the lights in Time Square, it was a pretty epic moment, it felt like a message from god, I felt like I was at Disney World. Considering I go to this place often for basic salads and french fries, I was shocked to see this on the menu. So I took a chance on a $9.51 Quesadilla and it was magical, it was ordered to go and they gave me a huge cup of Salsa, Guacamole, and sour cream and it was a pretty huge quesadilla cut into 3 triangles. I was impressed and it was SO DARN GOOD! HOLY GRAIL :) PS: Don't buy juice, soda and beverages from there unless you think it's okay to buy a snapple for $2.75 or better yet a cup of Fresh Orange juice for $4.25 SMH. QuickTip: run across the street to Duane Reade and get your beverages for less. By the way, I recommend this place for late night food and they have seating inside.",2,,

At 4 am it is generally pretty iffy as to where to take a young child in any city, let alone NYC.  Europan is great for us as they are so close to port Authority,  the employees are always courteous to us and  never mind us sitting and taking up two bar stools for an hour or so.

If you come during breakfast time, the place gets PACKED! SO packed that it's just a room full of people sometimes.  All the tables are taken, people are just standing in the cafe, it's to the point where there's barely any room to get out. And yes, definitely know what you want to order before it gets to your turn.  Since it gets so packed in the morning, if you start taking your time and get a little indecisive, those guys behind the counter will start busting your chops.  No joke.  I saw a little lady get ripped a good one because she couldn't decide what to order.  I don't know if it's a NY thing or just the guys working here but after seeing that, I knew exactly what to order because I was afraid of getting yelled at by those men.

Its sometimes hard to find a place to eat in Times Square that doesn't have waiter service or a ton of people waiting for a table. I was with a friend and we just wanted to sit down for a quick bite before our movie started. We walked in took a look at their menu. Then I asked what for me is my deal breaker question. ""You have omelets on your menu. It's 1:30 can I order one?""The guy behind the counter said ""Sure, anything you want."" That was all I needed to hear. Actually he said he didn't have waffles or home fries but he'd substitute french fries if it was okay. So we decided to stay for a while. The food was ready in about 10 minutes and the place wasn't packed so we found a nice seat. Though be warned eating space moves fast here so be warned you might play a little musical chairs.

90,Rav K.,"Houston, TX",16,7,14,2.0,5/4/2011,"EuroPan is one of the quintessential New York Cafes, the crowds pour into the establishment because of the enormous amount of traffic that passes by the business. Because of this, Europan can get away with being mediocre and still mange to stay in business.I avoided the deserts and went straight for the staple, ordering 2 slices of the pizza. To my surprise, it was surprisingly over priced for street food, a slice will run you about 4.50  versus 2-3 else where. Getting a drink? You will easily pay double digits. Price is not a factor yet relevant when the food is bland, cold, and basically there as a filler. My pizza lacked almost every quality of a desirable pizza, it was dry and barely warm. The ingredients were sub-par and add no significant flavor. Although it was busy and buzzing with patrons, they are there out of necessity rather than enjoyment. I would not recommend Europan.",,,

The staff is really efficient though, and orders are taken very quickly and get churned out just as fast. I did end up having to get my order to go and take it back to the hotel as the crowd was not something I wanted to deal with. I can't imagine people who aren't tourists actually sitting and eating (maybe at other times of the day they do) and dealing with that.I got the french toast with eggs - the eggs were really good and the french toast was just as yummy. Their tea was pretty damn big but standard Lipton tea - I wasn't sure if I could request anything else. The biggest plus is that it pretty much is right below where I was staying at the Westin, so it was hugely convenient.

This cafe is very conveniently located downstairs of the Westin in Times Square, and has friendly staff and a large selection of sandwiches, breakfasts, breakfast pastries, and pastries/cookies in general.My friends and I stopped in on one day and ordered coffee and a croissant, and a cigarillo. The coffee was very hot, too hot to drink it was so scalding. But the cigarillo, with both ends dipped in thick chocolate and deliciously flaky inside, was a hit with me. On the second day we stopped in and ordered a pound of assorted cookies. The cookies were not as delicious, but my favorites from that selection includes the leaf shaped cookie sandwich with a berry filling and dipped in chocolate, the crispy oatmeal raisin mini cookie, the chocolate chip cookie, and the fudge cookie.

I bought an Oreo and Chocolate Chip cookie and the Oreo one tastes nothing like Oreo- again deceiving. Another reason I decided to give this place a try is because of all the people that's sitting in the restaurant. It made me thought their bakery goods are extravagant, but I guessed wrong. I am giving this Cafe a rating of 1 star because of their wrong and deceiving ways. Aside from their poor tasting cookies, their staffs were also very rude. When I asked for the two cookies, the cashier just threw it at me. And when I said ""thank you"" he did not acknowledged it. The cashier also had a deep accent so when I asked him to repeat the name of a cookie I asked about he looked very annoyed.Even though I am not from NY and do not know much about NY bakeries, I know when I visit NY, I wont be going to this place every again. ~SMH~",2,,

Not only did we spend an outrageous amount of money on a simple, tasteless breakfast, but we also received very poor customer service. One associate, in particular, was rude and impatient. As soon as we entered the cafe and were in the cafe for a total of 20 seconds, this associate was hurrying us along as we were trying to read the menu. This man should've realized we were tourists and not familiar with his menu, never-mind anything else yet.

137,Peter J.,"Toronto, Canada",1,20,3,1.0,8/5/2010,"Six days in arguably the greatest city on Earth allowed us to spoil our senses through food, entertainment, and great company. This all came to a screeching halt upon our arrival at ""Europan Bakery and Cafe"". There was surely nothing European about this venue, other than the snippy attitude we received from our hosts. I ordered a simple dish: the hamburger. In my yearning to silence the rumblings in my stomach, I applied logic and sensibility to my decision: I needed something quick, familiar, and unfathomably difficult for anyone to screw up. Hamburger bun, patty, lettuce, tomatoes; Go.   They failed miserably. How quick they were to accept my cash payment, and easily they forgot my simple 1-item order. The rumblings grew louder. Upon numerous ""Canadian style friendly"" reminders, the cook proceeds to pull a meat patty from God knows where and place it in the microwave. Putain. Things were not looking good. I withhold my reservations, I'm Canadian - we give everything a chance here, most of the time two. I dive in and take a bite. The meat is tasteless and tough. I said two chances right? The second bite yields a cold velvet center: red. Enough is enough, I make my way back to the counter and speak with the presumed manager (the one in the awful baby teal dress shirt, but what do I know about fashion?). I politely inform him that the meat is not cooked. His reply? ""That's how people like it here!"". Exclamation point is verbatim to his tone. Well then, I ask him I would much rather prefer my meat patty to be well done. He pauses, looks at me straight in the eyes, and says with a tinge of condescendence ""I will let you know when it's ready, Sir."" Go figure the closest thing this establishment had to being European was me being called Sir. Of course, he then proceeds to put the whole damned plate in the microwave; why not just the patty I wondered? Now this ensured the buns, the lettuce, and the tomatoes would be irreversibly damaged. I give up! I give up! Please, the rumblings themselves are giving out rumblings of their own at this point! At the very least, I am glad to report that the night wasn't entirely ruined with this sub-standard service, for there will always be a 'dollar-a-slice' pizza around a friendly corner.   Truly yours,James Peter, Ph.D, MDFoodie",,,

167,Ramo S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,0,5.0,6/30/2009,"This location is awesome!!! The breakfast is really good and they are very quick cooking it up. We come to this place all the time for breakfast when we are in NYC. We have two small kids and do not like to eat fast food all the time so it is nice to start the day off with pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon, orange juice and some fruit. The price is very good compared to other places in town and it is very clean and has a very nice atmosphere.  They also have smoothies and desert items available. I would highly recommend this place and give it high ratings.",,,
