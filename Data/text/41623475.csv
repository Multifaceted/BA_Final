0,William C.,"Chevy Chase, MD",219,27,1,4.0,6/2/2018,"I'm a Potbelly fan, and have been since high school. The sandwiches are good, and you can't go wrong with the milkshakes, cookies, etc either. I also appreciate that they always make an effort to have a bit of personality in decorating the place, if you're into that.Those hot peppers, though... every once in a while I forget that they are hotter than f*ckitty f*ck and decide to try adding them to my sandwich again. I am totally fine with spicy food, by the way. Just yesterday I ordered spicy ramen and lived to tell the tale. But these peppers are something else. Seriously, unless you are from the Szechuan Province or something, steer clear of these bad boys. They totally overpower the sandwich!",,,
1,Stephanie J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,60,58,3.0,11/7/2018,"I like potbelly. They offer great sandwich combos and they toast their sandwiches to perfection. You get to choose between regular bread or multigrain and between original size (approx 6inches), a Big (slightly bigger than the original but not a foot long), and a flat. They offer some free topping choices such as mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers, pickles, Italian seasoning and some other choices which you can pay additional for. I think they do a decent job in putting together their sandwiches and I've never really had an issue with customer service. I also like that they have lots of sides and chips options to choose from and some locations even have shakes and smoothies.I am giving 3 starts because I think they are a little overpriced. I came here over the weekend and ordered a big size sandwich ($8.95, slightly bigger than a 6inch), a bag of chips, a can drink, and the side of potato salad and ended up paying about $16! The original size sandwich is about $7.50, so for me it didn't make sense to get it. I just think that their prices can be a little lower for the sandwiches.",,,
2,Karen Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,394,1571,2.0,2/8/2018,"I love Potbelly, huge fan... but this location totally #sucks and the food orders are never #ontime! I love their sandwiches, I consider myself a loyalist because I would go for Potbelly over others (Lenny's, Cosi (RIP), Earl of Sandwich... ) but this location makes me ""cringe"" during the lunch hour rush.  It's in midtown west, too close to Macy's and the massive tourist crowds looking for Macy's... ugh #palmtoface 2x now, I've placed my order in advance and both times, upon my arrival to the ""designated"" cashier - my food was not ready.  1st time, placed order 15mins ahead - waited 5mins for it to come up.  OK.  2nd time, placed order 30mins ahead - waited another 10mins...  while the regular line emptied out.  Really? Should I have just waited in line rather than paying that ""service fee""? What's the perk?!!What tipped it over the top, the ""designated"" cashier was so nonchalant with the 'I don't really give a f*ck' tude...' - apparently she can't handle the line and call downstairs for the food orders.  I get it, not everyone is a multitasker... but at least apologize and pause to find out what happened to the food.  I may need to rethink and skip this location for my daily lunch rotation.  Can't be hangry everyday. #notworthit",2,1,2

Opens at 11 on weekends, we were standing outside in the cold at 11 waiting and they were not ready to open yet. After they unlocked the doors, we immediately got attitude from the lady behind the counter. I asked her not to toast my sandwich and she said she ""needed"" to toast the bread. I asked to her not put the cheese on until after, to which she asked about toasting the mushrooms ( never asked for mushrooms). She then screamed my order at the other employee at the register to ring me up, which I thought was weird since I was not done yet. When I came time for veggies I asked for avocado, lettuce, tomato, pickles and hot peppers. She proceeded to ring up avocado for an additional $1. They handed me my sandwich and I asked if the cheese was added and he said yes (Swiss). I get home and the sub was avocado,cheddar, tomatoes and onions. On top of being unprepared for a late open and rude, my sandwich was completely incorrect. Will never come here again.",,,

They were out of the Tomato soup, so I had the chicken enchilada. They don't give you the full cup when you order, which I found odd, and it was a bit thick like it had been sitting all day. Very salty,too.My daughter had a turkey sandwich and liked it. The place was relatively empty. It was extremely hot in there, even I was bothered. That's saying a lot because I'm always freezing. We left pretty quickly.",1,,2

Someone else will get sick from this location and it us unsafe.  I will call the health department on this unsanitary restaurant.",,,
9,Chris L.,"REGO PARK, NY",9,71,149,3.0,1/31/2017,"This is a quick sandwich shop. Similar to Lenny's if you had ever been. They have a new item, Mac and cheese I haven't tried this yet. Since it's a little bit on the expensive side, $5 for a small and $7 for a large. I made the mistake once in getting their chilli, cup size and I felt like I didn't even eat lunch. When you order a sandwich you better be ready on what you want. You don't have much time to decide. There's a person who takes your order once you get online. So you pick a sandwich, then the size, type of bread and move on. Once you approach the counter you get to order toppings, lettuce, tomato, etc. You get your sandwich and pay.I has their chicken and cheddar sandwich. Nothing special just grilled chicken with cheddar cheese. The original is about 6 inch sub. If I didn't get alot of toppings I'd be hungry. It's such a thin sandwich. Chicken was moist at least. No special sauce on it. There's a lot of seating available here downstairs and upstairs. Not bad place for kids, they have highchairs as well.",,,
10,Darya K.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,65,27,2.0,5/30/2017,"I came in for a salad, and got ambushed by a lady asking what I'm having today, it was confusing whether she was taking my order or taking a survey.I then moved on to the counter and there was the same lady, interesting... I confirmed my order: Mediterranean salad with chicken, no artichokes, no onions, and no hummus. I also asked for just olive oil.I came to my office and was disappointed. It's a $10 salad, there was hardly any chicken, there was no feta cheese (which is listed on the menu as one of the ingredients in this salad), and they did not give me any olive oil nor did they put it in the salad.Not worth the $10.

11,Marissa L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,187,388,4.0,12/3/2017,"Potbelly is one of my favorite spots for a quick sandwich, and this location delivers a solid experience. There is plenty of seating, lots of space for the line (although I often go at off-peak times so there's never really a line), and it's in a very convenient location. The sandwiches are on par with other Potbelly locations I've been to, and I appreciate the consistency. I also like that Potbelly now lets you pay through their app and accumulate points for free stuff.",,,2
12,William H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,12,0,3.0,9/12/2018,Standard sandwiches at what used to be a reasonable price point. But I've noticed prices keep increasing. Drinks and chips are extortionate.

13,Port H.,"Miami, FL",0,22,1,4.0,7/15/2018,"Always wanted to go there since there is no Potbelly in my city or even in the adjacent cities. Missed going to the one in San Antonio last year. But, had a chance to stop by the one in Manhattan on 37th and 7th. Ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was good as expected. The only negative was the cashier working around 2:15 PM. Made me confused as to what I actually ordered. She came off as being angry at something and this clearly came across when dealing with other customers too.",,,
14,Antoinette P.,"Brooklyn, NY",428,47,36,1.0,5/22/2017,"I was in the mood for a milkshake and decided to walk over to Potbelly for lunch since it's been a while. Ordered an Italian and a banana shake. While walking back to the office I tasted the shake and it should have been called ""banana milk"" instead (yuck). It was pouring out of the top the same way a soda would when too full. Walked back & they offered to remake it but the same girl made the shake. Oh did I mention yet that it's raining out?? It was a tad bit improved but she's clearly heavy handed on the milk pouring. This is when I got annoyed that I even walked back for this and just dumped my shake. There are wayyy too many options in the 34th st area to settle for a stomach ache due to milk overload. Went to Johnny rockets nearby and grabbed a banana shake on my return to the office. It was made right the first time! And quickly. Won't make that mistake again, especially in the rain. My sandwich was fine but it's a thumbs down for me on this potbelly location for the experience with the shake.",,,
15,Florinda G.,"Hialeah, FL",42,98,432,3.0,7/25/2016,"I was in the area for a concert at Madison Square Garden and I thought it'd be smart to eat something before the show so I wouldn't end up spending $20 on popcorn inside, lol.I'm from Miami so I wasn't familiar with Potbelly, their menu, and their food. I decided to just look at the menu and go with the first thing that caught my attention. 5 minutes later I was faced with a Pizza Sandwich on brown bread.. eh, the name is probably the yummiest thing about it, sadly.So, what's in it? The Pizza Sandwich had meatball, pepperoni, capicola, provolone cheese, marinara sauce, mushrooms, and Italian seasoning. For my sandwich, I ordered it with no mushrooms and I added some hot peppers. I won't sit here and say the sandwich was horrible, but it lacked a lot of the yum factor that you would expect from a sandwich made at a place KNOWN for sandwiches. I would freaking take a Publix Sub over a Potbelly sandwich any day. I can't exactly pinpoint what I didn't like about it but it was blah, there should've been MORE MEAT and more marinara sauce, it was mainly bread and a ton of the hot peppers.",,,
16,Savvy C.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,63,0,2.0,8/4/2018,"Slow, slow service.  The counter people were too busy talking to themselves, and their friend who was in the shop, to spend their time making sandwiches.  I have no tolerance for people who disrespect my time like that.  Talk on your own time, not on mine.  Probably added another 6-8 minutes to the time it took me to get serviced.",,,

I ordered the featured Buffalo chicken sandwich with all the veggies, blue cheese, oil and got it extra spicy by adding hot sauce and their hot peppers. Their sandwich really did hit the spot. It was very flavorful and very spicy. They offer 2 sizes the small n large. I ordered the small and paid approximately  $7. I was full, happy, and content with the amount I paid for my sandwich.

What I'm not okay with is the employees getting annoyed with the customers because nobody is used to your little system that you're trying out. From sandwich maker to cashier they all had a bit of an attitude with people being a little confused and not moving fast enough. So when a New Yorker who's already in a bad mood comes in it really pisses me off to deal with you. Chill the fuck out and deal with your customers properly.",,,

I thought it would be slightly better than a Subway Sandwich. It was really just about as bad. There was hardly any chicken in it, maybe two or three small scraps and one of them had grizzel in it. Just awful! The bread, though, was a half step above the bread you'll find in a Blimpees or Subway. Something else that bothered me aside from the sub par food was that the freak preparing my sandwich had a straggly six inch exposed beard. I mean really, isn't that a health code violation?

38,Michael Z.,"New York, NY",450,150,345,4.0,6/22/2015,"After coming here a few times--I try to stop here every few times I'm in the city--I can safely say that this is a consistently tasty Potbelly's.If you come here during a lunch rush or something, you're unlikely to get the best sandwich ever, but there will always be a consistency in ingredients. Time and time again, Potbelly's proves to be a very consistent chain that is always better than its Subway/Quizno's counterpart... more than enough to justify the slight price difference.These days, the price difference is actually pretty minimal. For a location so central in the city, it's a pretty great deal to get a filling sandwich for $6-7. They'll never skimp out on meat or other toppings, and their hot peppers are always a big plus if you're into real kick with your sandwiches.Lastly, service is pretty decent. When the line gets like, they'll send a person over to expedite the ordering process. Add plenty of seating and occasional live music... there's little to hate here.",,,

You'd think that resolved it?  Nope.  She calls over this other person (assistant manager maybe). That person reiterates that she has to charge for the mushroom, citing some terminal/pos reason. I point out again the mushroom is part of the name of the sandwich and for them to read their own menu.  At this point, the guy who makes my sandwich steps up and backs me up.  The lady rolls her eyes, punches a few buttons and the charge for the mushroom disappears, and then she walks away curtly.  (So much for terminal/pos issue eh).All in all, a big waste of my time for something that should be quick.  There are too many other breakfast places around this area for me to ever bother with this place again.",5,2,

Big fan of the drink selection with San Pellegrino sparkling blood orange available at many locations, love this stuff! As a sub shop this chain is the clear winner with it's use of superior meats, cheeses, breads and fresh toppings, they have truly raised the bar in this market. The menu has a limited but diverse theme with your choice of toppings, a sandwich of your design is a simple affair as the efficient layout has your meal in hand in no time.

After multiple delays, it finally opened up, but then I didn't have the chance to go until today. Potbelly is similar to Subway, Quizno's, and the like, but portrayed in a more gourmet like way. The dining area is very nice with wood trimming and wooden furniture, giving it a bit of a classy feel. The ordering process is very similar:1) You choose your sandwich and bread (regular or multigrain wheat).2) You can also order salad or soup at menu cost.3) You move down the line and tell the lady at the toaster machine what sandwich you ordered. She then hands it off to one of the several sandwich makers.4) You move down to the sandwich maker and let them know what toppings you would like.5) They wrap up your sandwich, bag it and hand it over to you.6) You then grab any additional items you might want (cookies, etc.). and then proceed to pay for your meal.I ordered the Wreck ($5.80) which consists of very thin slices of salami, roast beef, turkey, and smoked ham with Swiss cheese on multigrain with everything (mustard, hot peppers, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, oil, and Italian seasoning) except Mayo. Mmmm mmm delicious. The 7"" sandwich and meat were toasted warm, just how I like it. The toppings were for the most part on the scarce side, but proportional enough that all the flavors were well-balanced. The hot peppers gave it some nice heat, and all the other vegetables gave it a nice refreshing crispness. It was easy to handle without all the ingredients falling out. The exception to that was the overzealous serving of lettuce and oil that oozed out all over my fingers. It was indeed very delicious, but somewhat on the messy side.Prices are a bit high when compared to Subway and Quiznos. When you break it down, the ingredients are basically the same, but Potbelly does a much better in the preparation and use of ingredients. For some reason, the same ingredients at Subway doesn't seem to pair well and are very distinguishable from one another. But at Potbelly, everything really seems to work well. In time, the hype and glamour made fade away at Potbelly, when people begin to realize they are overpyaing for a sandwich of such fast-food caliber. But for now, I'm definitely a fan of Potbelly until proven otherwise.",2,,1
52,Tyler L.,"New York, NY",357,922,1278,3.0,2/2/2012,"I tried this sandwich chain for the first time today. The interior design was pleasant. It is very new and clean inside, with a modern, hip wooden interior. In terms of the sandwich quality, I would say that it is comparable to Quizno's. I tried one of their Signature hero sandwiches - the Pizza Sandwich.You can get their sandwiches with regular white bread or wheat bread. The Pizza Sandwich contains pepperoni, meatball, marinara sauce, provolone cheese, mushrooms and Italian seasoning. The sandwich is about 8 inches long and was satisfactory, but overall, is not worth a repeat visit.",1,,

It's relatively spacious, the line moves quickly, and there is a lovely guitar player serenading you while you are eating or waiting on line. The sandwiches are delicious. I love the chicken salad (with everything), the turkey (with everything), and the tuna sandwich (with everything). The toppings are so so good, the peppers being the best. They just give the sandwiches that extra oomph. I also love how they don't pack your sandwich with the meats, like delis do. Everything is just right. Each sandwich is ~$6.

The place is HUGE and the upstairs area is a godsend, especially with the cold lately, it's warmer and cozier up there. The staff is friendly in that 'love to make small talk' way that I'm used to for Potbelly's (well, except for most of the New York locations.) My most recent visit I asked for a Sicilian which is on their 'secret menu' my sandwich maker obviously didn't know what it was but asked me what goes in it and then he made it happen. Because I'm a jerk, I didn't think I got my meatballs in the sub and went up to complain but he explained that they put the meatballs under the meat and after a closer inspection I found that these are loafers. No, actually he was right and I felt bad for being that guy, but he let it roll off his back.",,,
58,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11030,3.0,1/12/2012,"The day they put up a ""Coming Soon"" sign for Potbelly across the street from my building, I was subject to coworkers heralding it as the second coming every day up until it's opening. I tried to go there the first week and there was a line out the door, so I decided to wait and get some feedback.Everyone basically said that that the sandwiches were small but very good. So I  went back for a random late lunch. Yes, everyone was right about the smallness of the sandwiches. I ordered the Wreck on multi-grain bread. The bread was very good but there was very little meat (good thing I had a hearty breakfast!). People who are saying that Potbelly is a Subway-killer have obviously never had really good Subway before. I've had subs at Subway or Blimpies on par with what Potbelly tastes like.Don't get me wrong- it wasn't a bad meal, but it didn't live up to the hype. The line was also long despite the fact that it was close to 3pm.So is it worth spending a little bit more for marginally better tasting meats and a smaller sandwich? I can't answer that one for you, but I think I'll be back to try the shakes, which are dirt cheap.",,,

When calling upon to see if it could be delivered sooner, the girl said that it would not be scheduled until 230 even though I'm sure they would have had time before then. The reason I think this is because the sandwiches were pretty cold by the time they arrived. And if they insist on making someone wait an hour, at least show up within that hour when it's only 5 blocks away! On top of that, I specifically requested on the order no mushrooms in my sandwich due to an allergy and my sandwich still had mushrooms! Thank god I noticed or else I would be in the hospital right now. Lastly, I requested 3 bags of chips for my co-workers, choosing SPECIFIC chips which I have proof of in my receipt and received different chips than ordered.

Warm, not too salty, the crispiness of the lettuce gives it a good texture, the bread its fresh and the oils add the extra touch of moist.

I got the tuna salad sub on white bread. There was barely any tuna but it was only $5.60 so I guess that's expected. For $2 they can double the meat. It might be worth it. All other toppings are normal. Not as many options as subway but they toast the sub the same way Quiznos does it.There's plenty of seating here and wednesdays are open mic night.",,,

69,Jen S.,"Chesterfield, MO",2,8,1,2.0,6/23/2015,"This review is more specific to their Veggie/Hummus sandwich. While overall the taste is okay, this is WAY overpriced and a misleading name for this sandwich. First, I ate an entire half before realizing I was supposed to be eating a HUMMUS sandwich instead of just a veggie. Looking on the bread I saw the thinnest layout of hummus I couldn't even taste, and they charge premium for hummus?? Basically it was a veggie sandwich with not even a lot of veggies, yet all for the SAME cost as a sandwich loaded with meat. Sorry, but I buy hummus and veggies at the store and this sandwich should be no more than $4 max for what they give you. If you're charging the same price as a sandwich loaded with meat then hummus better be oozing out of my sandwich (much like the one I'm eating now from a Mediterranean shop down the street.)Beyond that, they are limited in their selection beyond sandwiches and I don't care for the fact they don't do half and halfs (ie- half sandwich and soup, etc.) Their soup is also way overpriced for what you get which is basically a small cup of soup and a few crackers, no bread. Doesn't even compare to Panera. Gave this place three chances and I'll never go back.",,,

The hot peppers are the best add on. And sure your sandwich is toasted. So what?And then I discovered the Chocolate Brownie Cookie. This is without a doubt, the most amazing cookie ever. This is the main reason why I go in to Potbellys. It is orgasmic. It is my cookie soul mate. It can solve World Wars and cure depression. This location also gets a solid extra star for the fantastic build out at the location and the hipster guitar man who plays top 40 covers.

They are very efficient. You can also choose whether you want the normal bread or the thinner  bread (ie. less carbs). I had the turkey melt with provolone. It was good. While waiting in line, somebody comes up to take your order so once you get to the actual sandwich making station, your sandwich is already ready and they just need to grab the right one.

But nonetheless, I appreciate the simplicity of the menu selections as it does look intentional. I thought the names for some of the sandwiches were pretty cool. I ordered ""A Wreck,"" which consists of Salami, Roast Beef, Turkey, Ham and Swiss Cheese. I got the original size, and the total came up to be about $6, which was not too bad. Regular toppings but I wish there were more sauces to choose from. (Think there was just about two) I decided to just get mayo with the sandwich.

Updated review","I can't help it. Seems like everytime I pass this place, I just want to go in. And so I did. A. I was hungry; B. last time I went I enjoyed; C. there was absolutely no line. This time around I had the chilli. It was fine. Nothing spectacular about it. I did not moan nor did I roll my eyes to the heavens as the flavor hit my tongue. I actually had to pause after the first bit because I was really expecting more. The fully loaded also came up to almost $8 and the ""bowl"" is no bigger than an 8 oz mug. Like last time, the same male handled my order. I was absolutely shocked at how nice and pleasent he was. He greeted me and told me to ""have a nice day"" as if he MEANT it. In my experience, this never happens in Times Square fast food joints. Sure the staff will greet you but it always sounds forced. I will go back but definitely NOT for the chilli.",3,4,3

99,Mary Jo M.,"Edison, NJ",55,19,13,5.0,7/13/2015,I want to start off by saying I had a bad experience with a delivery from this store but how the management and staff took care of me afterwards is why I'm giving such a great review.  I ordered lunch for a few people in the office and it took quite some time to get here - long after the delivery window closed - I complained to the management and not only did the store manager reach out to me but the district manager did as well.  My order was comped and they offered coupons (actually sent them to my office) for free food.  The coupons were a bonus but the customer service that I received was exactly what you would hope for from a company when you have a bad experience.  The food was excellent - I will definitely order again and I want to thank Michael and Janet for their prompt response,,,

One of the things I liked about this place was there were clearly visible menu boards and takeout menus to look at while you're on line (so no holding up the line when you get to the front and it's actually time to place your order).  Within a few minutes, we placed our orders and made our way upstairs where there's additional seating.  We loved our turkey sandwiches.  They were tasty, fresh, warm, and very reasonably priced.  I left Potbelly sated, not stuffed...and that's alright by me.",2,1,2

111,Cliff K.,"West Hollywood, CA",131,81,14,5.0,2/16/2012,"I am in a good mood today because all of my fellow yelpers gave me a huge shout out yesterday!  You can thank all of them Potbelly.To preface this review, you need to know the following details about me.Factoid #1: I love sandwichesFactoid #2: I pay way too much for rent, and have no money for anything else.Factoid #3: Equinox came into my office, called me fat, told me i had to eat right, work out, and cry 3 times a week to lose the water weight.  So when I'm out to lunch (or when I'm not crying), I'm usually looking for a sandwich that tastes good, doesn't break the bank, and isn't going elicit yelling from my nutritionist.And to my surprise, there was one right next to my work.  Lotta things to like about Potbelly :1. The line is long as hell, BUT they take your order early, so the sandwich is cooked by the time you get to the portion where they add the toppings.2. Just like subway, you can add your sauce and vegetables the way you want.  Side note: I always thought this was the absolute most ingenious thing about subway.  Because for some reason, it's much more of a hassle to get items substituted out than to take the time to build it.  For instance, when you order a cheeseburger at McDonald's, it's so tedious to take out the pickles.  Even though you hate pickles, and you end up picking them out.  You even end up frustrated because the pickle taste has been infused into the cheeseburger.  So you holler and moan and complain, but yet all of this is still less tedious than asking the cashier to take the pickles out.  Why?  Who the hell knows.  3. The sandwich is cheap.  like 6 bucks.4. The sandwich is 500 calories.  what!5. The ""wreck"" has 4 different types of sandwich meat.  AND is toasted.  Or you can get the meatball sub.  WHAT.6. Live music.  Even at Noon.  That's tight.So after someone took me to this place, I went 3 times that week.  I think I might have an addictive personality... OR maybe just an awesome one!  (That was my lame attempt at ending this review.  Shut up.)",3,13,4

115,Nemo L.,"Tampa, FL",31,205,2,3.0,7/26/2012,"I thought this place was great when it first opened. Given, the sandwiches are pretty small compared to the footlong you could get at Subway for the same price (and don't be fooled by thinking Potbelly is healthier--it's processed meats all the way down, baby), I was impressed by how much they had their shit together. A person at the front of the line with an iPad buzzes in orders so everything is good to go by the time you get up to get your toppings.What happened?! Every time I go there now, something seems to be broken, or that person who takes orders is nowhere to be seen (is it only in a small window of the lunch rush that I fall outside of?)... I went there for a milkshake the other day and had to wait 15 minutes to place my order at the sandwich counter & then could bypass the line to pay. Can't they have people who aren't ordering sandwiches bypass the line completely in general? Not to mention the ""ingredients"" people were sharp when it first opened & last time I was in the girl nearly rolled her eyes at me because I had to interrupt her personal conversation with a coworker just so a brotha could get some Italian Seasoning.That combined with the ugly TGIFridays decor (woo, quirky antique sewing machine and vintage country knickknacks!) and random lunchtime Adult Contemporary Singersongwriter makes this place kinda whack & wants me to give it 2 stars. BUT. I really, really like their sandwiches. The Pizza Sandwich is AWESOME as is the new veggie Mediterranean Sandwich with hummus. I also like that the shakes are pretty affordable given that most bourgy burger places around the area will charge you $8 for a little blended ice cream and chocolate syrup.So, small tasty sandwiches, perfect for take-out. This place is whack so touch-n-go, people! Touch-n-go.",,1,1

117,Michael J.,"San Francisco, CA",124,68,1,2.0,6/7/2012,"I have been to Potbelly in Chicago and was surprised with how good it was, but this particular branch is very disappointing, doing nothing to distinguish it from the Subway across the street.I had the Pizza sandwich, which sounds great in theory as it is cold cuts, red sauce, melted cheese and mushrooms, but comes off bland. All I could taste was the canned mushrooms swimming in watered down marinara.I also tried their breakfast sandwich option today and it was just bad. In a neighborhood surrounded with delis making fresh eggs with bacon and cheese for $3, I expected more than pre-made eggs topped with microwave bacon and American cheese put through a toaster for $4. Despite working around the corner, I will not be going back anytime soon.",1,,
118,R Y.,"Manhattan, NY",43,271,342,2.0,5/2/2012,"I came here for lunch and it was mediocre at best.My friend wanted all veggies without cheese option. Unfortunately, the thing that come closest to that is their veggie sandwich which is suppose to have mushroom and 3 different types of cheese. Luckily they made it without cheese, but it's still very small sandwich for what she's paying since it's the same price. Their vegetarian option is very limited and not much selection when it comes to sandwiches.I had turkey with cheese. Very generic and it's true that I get to choose the extra toppings as much as I want, but nevertheless, it's not very big. I also can't see if they are putting too much or too little because of the darn high wall that is separating me from the sandwich assemblers. Anyhow, our total came out little over $11- JUST the sandwiches. It seems a little over priced for the amount you get. Quality, I guess, but I had better quality for cheaper price. Only good thing is probably that the sandwich was warm and the bread was decent. Music was pretty loud for the lunch crowd. It was live music, a man playing his guitar and singing, but honestly, he could have put down his volume a little. It's really spacious, plenty of seats so you don't have to worry about having no seats.It's not that special. It's just a sandwich shop. They do offer wifi for free, which is a bonus, but don't think it's worth me going for their sandwiches. It was quite a disappointment.",1,,
119,Stephen W.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,63,8,3.0,2/25/2013,"First got hooked at the Potbelly over in chi town...The ""wreck"" is far from what the name states. That is one of the best sandwiches on the line up at Potbelly. I usually throw everything on it minus the hot peppers and it is ready to go with a cold shake. Delish...One thing that kind of troubled me about this place is that one day I decided to get a PB&J thinking it would of been great as it is the same price as the other sandwiches and figured I get my bang for my buck since it's just PB&J. Boy was I wrong, I guess their approach to PB&J is minimalism, very little PB and very little J to the point where I felt ripped off. Did I complain? no, I usually don't complain as I do not like giving things a second chance.in conclusion, good place...just not for PB&J",,,

Updated review","I wanted to be fair to Potbelly since my first review was so disappointing. I must say now, that I am a fan of Potbelly!I realized the key to my sammich was to NOT put the italian seasoning on, and to keep the hot peppers to the side. Now that I have been ordering my sammich this way, I have to say I am here about once a week now lol.The line during lunch can be overwhelming. But if you call in your order, you can walk right up to the pick up counter to get your order and pay. No hassle.",1,1,1

Simplicity is the key to a good menu...IMO.  They offer cookies, chips and what looks to be giant sized pickles.  The service was very quick and never rushed like Suckways across the street.  I really enjoyed my time there and noticed that they offer space for live performances as well.  I'm not sure if live bands would work in this area, but who cares as long as you're sinking your teeth into a tasty sandwich, even an off-key singer would sound heavenly.Thanks Potbelly, I shall return!",1,1,

150,Tom M.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,10/24/2012,Don't order delivery here unless you have a lot of time to wait.Placed our order on Wednesday at 12:17pm...it's 1:46pm now and we haven't received it yet. Called the store and they told us that 'it's on the way'...Not cool.,1,,
151,Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",263,510,33,2.0,4/17/2012,"You know... it really pains me to write this review, especially since I've been so looking forward to eating here.I pass by this place on my way to work every morning. Ideally, I pass by this place on my way home too, but I tend to get lazy at night (I call it running late) and end up taking the subway for 2 measly stops. The bright and colorful sign just beckons to me saying... stop here... stay a while... no need to get to work on time today...The rustic wooden furniture and cute arching designs say... stay for a while and PLAY to your heart's content.One day (it was a beautiful day in March), there was this guy giving out free samples. Now... rarely do I ever turn down a free sample... so here I was, munching on an egg, sausage and cheese mini-sandwich on a (multi-grain?) bread.  It was delicious, so delicious that I vowed to come back some time with a full wallet and a hungry belly.So... a week or two later, I took out my wallet, and entered the store. It was a beautiful morning, and I was feeling lazy (and hungry... a deadly combination indeed).The first problem I had was when I just walked in: There was a guy washing the windows inside. He had one of those extendable squeegie things (the only way to reach the high windows), but the problem was, the dirty water was just dripping down, near the entrance, over the table w/ the coffee and trash area... Ok... well, I thought to myself... I don't have to sit there... maybe he'll be done soon? The line part was also a bit confusing... there's a place to order, but no one standing there, so I went forward to where there were two people at the register. I asked about the difference between the sandwich sizes (roll or square, or something along those lines), and the guy's like... you have to order back there. Well, I didn't feel too bad since he also walked back to the section and I ordered my swiss cheese, egg and mushroom sandwich. What I didn't know is that I had to stay at station 2 with my sandwich until it was complete. Also, there  wasn't a traditional toppings station where you could see what they had available and also how much they're putting on your sandwich (Subway, you've spoiled me so) so I didn't know what they had available. It was just a very high wall/counter and a ""what toppings do you want"" question. Anyway, I only wanted ketchup as a topping to my breakfast sandwich, and they gave me three to-go packets (I had to ask for more later, which I got w/o fuss).So I paid ($4.36 w/ tax) for the larger sandwich,and went to find a place to sit down.  When I looked around, all I could see was the dirty drippy water on the floor... and the guy who's continuing to wash the windows. So... I walked back to the counter and politely made a suggestion that it's a bit off putting to have dirty water dripping near you (at a food restaurant). The guy basically just shrugged and said OK (lip service... ).  Maybe they didn't think it was a big deal, but it was dripping RIGHT where the general counter-top, trash, utensils, etc. was... And also over the entrance... It was a bit difficult to find a table out of the way since the window washer was moving back and forth a lot, but I found one... yes I was the only person in the restaurant.Finally the sandwich was pretty disappointing. The portion size was decent, but the egg was unevenly distributed, and the mushrooms were RAW! I'm pretty sure they're supposed to be COOKED mushrooms! Anyway, it wasn't a bad sandwich, but the ambiance and general apathy of the employees to health and sanitation concerns is troubling.",4,2,2
152,Nancy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,98,1,5.0,6/9/2012,"Fell in love after my first bite. I ordered the roast beef on white bread. I didn't think I would get full off a small sandwich, but I was good until dinner time. Will be back to try the rest of the menu.",1,1,1

155,Ggg O.,"Jericho, NY",0,13,0,4.0,5/2/2013,"Its amazing how you can many sandwich places you can have, and they all taste different. Potbelly is one of those unique ones. Although their contents and recipe seem standard, the sandwich is really good. I used to have Subway for lunch but got tired of their cheap and mass production standards. I'm a regular at Potbelly now.And their hot peppers are the best, I get them on my sandwiches and have bought 2 jars till date.Highly Recommended!",,,

Your wreck was just as delicious as I had remembered...thank goodness it wasn't just nostalgia. I love the Italian sub as well and even the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a gooey bunch of warm goodness. And the pickles...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm",2,,1
157,Dennis A.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,0,4.0,3/15/2013,"I just had Potbelly for the first time and I am quite impressed. I got the A Wreck sandwich on regular with the usual lettuce,tomato,mustard and mayo. It is nothing like Subway; it doesn't have that generic taste you get from sandwich chain restaurants. My only problem is the size but to be quite honest I am satisfied because of its taste. Add a drink and a cookie and you have a $10 lunch. And that's pretty good if you're around midtown.Recommendations: Get the Chocolate Brownie Cookie",,,
158,K L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,50,7,1.0,4/10/2012,"I did complain to management and tried again at another location (366 5th Ave.) much better customer service  experience . I'll still never return to this location. Let Down  This was possibly the biggest food let down for me in many years.I hate to give a bad review but when you leave a place literary  feeling bad.You want to make sure no one goes in to experience the same thing.Still not sure if you should go and spend the money you work for at this place ?Here's my experience.AMBIANCE-   I'd seen the ""coming soon"" in the storefront for a while and I was excited because I love sandwiches.I walk in to find, Potbelly is a fast food chain, no matter how they market it and disguise it with  kitschy old timey knickknacks. There's a winding line of costumers and signs with the small menu hanging in  the line and on the wall. SERVICE - You have two choices for bread. If you go for a sandwich, which I did.I've not been to prison but I imagine from crime dramas the lunch is much like this. Snarly face people in Potbelly shirts stand back and yell at you to order.I ordered an Italian sandwich on whole wheat.""MULTIGRAIN"" I was corrected by the first angry man behind the wall. They toast it, weather you want them to or not.Then I'm herded down to the next portion of ordering where an angry woman with a Potbelly shirt ( apparently those shirts are very uncomfortable because everyone in them is mad) Yells ""what sandwich?"" I tell her, this time I say Multigrain because I learned. She takes my sandwich moves it and then points to the person behind me.I think there may be something wrong with my sandwich so I wait.  Then she points to the next person and the next until 4 people have gone.I asked what's going on and a different angry woman in the Potbelly attire roars ""It's cause you're standing there and not over there"" To which I tried to explain to her uninformed screaming self that I had already been helped by angry woman #1 and that is why I was standing where I was standing in the first place. The sandwich got made by a less loud man in a Potbelly shirt.FOOD- I didn't order anything else for 2 reasons, 1- see above 2- If you didn't order your shake at the sign that has a screaming man saying         ""ORDER YOUR SHAKE HERE""  you can forget it and that sign was by screaming woman 1 and 2.Would you believe the sandwich was not amazing?! It's not hard to mess up meat and bread I realize but there are ways to do it right. 1- Great bread( Potbelly didn't have great bread.) 2- Great filling (To go with the ambiance, service and bread, here's some lackluster fillings for your sandwich) It was just a boring sandwich that didn't set well with my newly soured mood.If you must have a sandwich from a fast food spot go to Subway save some cash and get an extra 6 inches of sandwich with  some options for bread and less people to scream at you.   Go Here if you'd like to experience prison style lunch",,,1
159,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,528,127,4.0,4/30/2012,"I've been waiting for Potbelly's to hit NYC and finally made my trek there today for lunch. 12:30pm Monday...line out to the door, but it moves briskly and in a few minutes I was getting my sandwich put together. I'm biased because I'm from Chicago, but I do objectively think this is a great sandwich. Not phenomenal by any means but a very good sandwich. Rougly a 6"" sandwich on white or wheat with choice of types. Think of it like a Quizno's (nice and toasty) but in my opinion a lot better. Sandwiches come in one size only but honestly it's all you need for a perfect sized lunch. Best yet prices are $5.50 to $5.80 a sandwich which I think is a great price. Sure for $5 you can get certain footlongs at Subway, but these guys have a better sandwich - can't compare. They don't skimp on the meat, the toppings are great (love it with hot giardiniera which is easy to find in Chicago, but not in NYC). Their classic is the Wreck which I remember being roast beef, turkey and salami. The others are great too. Throw in a bag a chips and a soda and you have lunch in midtown Manhattan for under $10. Nice! Ample seating, both upstairs and downstairs. Interestingly they had a person in the restaurant playing live music and singing (acoustic guitar)...belting out Tom Petty and Oasis which I thought was interesting for a sandwich shop. Not really necessary to be honest but hey its NY, I've come across stranger things.",,,

This chain used to be in other east coast states but now it finally came to NY! Best thing that ever happened. Anyways, I love their sandwiches because it has a homemade taste to it. I always get their roast beef or turkey. I tried chicken salad also and they're all SO GOOD! Their shakes are also BOMB. I always get the strawberry shortcake shake and it is seriously the best shake I've ever tasted. PURE ice-cream and fatness but who cares when it's DELISH? Their shakes also have lil cookies that come on the straws that are so adorable! I just love the decor of this place too. It's a very old western pub kinda feel so it's a very relaxing atmosphere. And to put the cherry on top, the prices are so reasonable. I would say it's cheap for a NY sandwich joint. OH and did I say their cookies are AMAZING also? YUMMMMMMMMMMMM so soft and chewy!!",,,

The sandwich was ok not that big and on the pricey side if you compare it to lets say Subway. Really it wasn't anything special and don't understand all the hype for this place.

173,Michelle K.,"Manhattan, NY",13,140,0,3.0,7/9/2012,"I really enjoy these sandwiches- love the fact that they are served warm, the cheese is perfectly melted, the meat fresh, and the bread moist. The lines are always pretty long at lunch time but they tend to move fast. The quality of the lettuce and tomatoes are also pretty good and they've got a good assortment of cookies and chips for snacks. The one MAJOR complaint I have about this place is that I like to order their as-advertised ""thin-cut"" sandwiches, however, they have never given me thin-cut sandwiches (I know b/c they look exactly the same as the other sandwiches). I just don't see the point of ordering something, having someone tell you its something that's its not and getting something that you didn't order. What's the point of having it on the menu then?! Thin cut should be thin cut!!!! Period. Potbelly- please kindly take note. Not all of us want potbellies!!!",1,1,1

This is by far one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had! Beats Panera Bread down here along with the other fast food sub shops.What I absolutely loved was the dream bar though.
