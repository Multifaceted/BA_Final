I liked that they had multiple stands around the area so you don't have to cross a specific street if you're closer to one of their other stands. It was around $8 for a box and let me tell you, it is a LOT of food. I shared it with a friend and we still could not finish it. The meat itself was nice and moist while the rice was a bit dry but they were a nice balance. The spices in the rice was one thing that stood out, some may not like it, but I didn't mind it. It also comes with their white sauce, i don't know what it is, but it is amazing. I also put some of their hot sauce on and even thinking about it now my mouth is watering because it was spicccy. It took me a trip to NY to try it even though they opened one up down on south FL, i'll definitely be going back closer to home!",,,

The beef wasn't good at all but the texture was nice. The falafel was warm, toasty, and not memorable. There are better falafels at other Mediterranean food stands.The white sauce was good but heavy and was absolutely necessary to taste anything in the bowl besides the chicken.",2,2,2
2,Adrian A.,"Long Beach, CA",277,353,776,5.0,11/16/2018,"""Where's the Original one?"" My girlfriend and I are big fan of Halal Guys since it was open in Long Beach, CA and she suggested to look for the original since we're in NYC. She was wondering this question, since NYC and this specific location have bunch of Halal Guys stand on each street corner. You can look travel guides on where was the original one, but frankly they all are original because they're all from the street of the Big Apple. Trust me they taste the same lol. Of course we ordered their half beef and half chicken platter. Their white sauce really complements the meats, rice, and vegetables. The taste was a little different from the Cali version.. taste gritty and street wise; I love it :) Folks, your NYC trip will be never be complete if you did not taste this yet. Overall, I wish they have Halal Guys stand in Long Beach cause if they do.. just take my money and fatten me up :)",2,,2

They gave us so much that my husband and I were able to both eat on it and get full. We got the combo platter with chicken and beef gyro. It also came with this wonderful seasoned rice, onions and peppers and fresh pita. Everything was wonderful. You have to eat it with the white sauce and spicy sauce all mixed together. We will definitely go back to this place next time we're in NYC.",,,
4,Carlye M.,"Davis, CA",360,207,618,4.0,11/2/2018,"Amazing, delicious, well-flavored food that definitely gives you a bang for your buck!Perhaps it was the cool NY air, the evening hour with street lights lit and flashing, the hunger in my stomach, or the welcoming yellow and red colors of the Halal Guys street cart, but I quickly became obsessed with the chicken and gyro plate. On a bed of orange-colored rice were two steaming heaps of meat (I got chicken and the beef gyro), paired with a couple pieces of pita bread, a pile of lettuce, and drizzled with white sauce...you are in for a feast. I split it with my husband. The portion size is phenomenal for the mere cost of $8! The servings of meat were quite large; they didn't skimp at all. The meat was so savory and flavorful. I wish they gave more pita bread. It was so soft but the portion was oh-so-small. Don't forget to ask for extra white sauce; they'll put some extra packets into your bag! Also, don't read the nutrition label on those white sauce packets. It'll spoil your fun! Just sit down on the nearest bench and savor that lovely goodness. The aluminum containers they serve it in come with cardboard lids, so you can somewhat easily save your leftovers. They have bottled drinks for sale if you need something cold. One star deducted only because the employee working the cart was very rude and gruff. Perhaps that's routine New York food cart behavior. Also, have cash. Perhaps that's also common knowledge - and now it's common knowledge for me!",1,,
5,Wei C.,"Markham, Canada",465,219,1846,5.0,9/24/2018,"Okay finally got to New York last month to try out the original Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th.  Yes there is a Halal Guys in Toronto now, but I specifically waited until we got to New York to try the original.  These guys literally own that south west corner in Midtown as the only thing that is going on there are people either serving or customers eating Halal Guys.The menu is really simple....choose either a platter ($8 USD) or a sandwich ($6 USD).  From there choose either chicken, beef gyro, combo (beef gyro/chicken) or falafel.  Then add the famous white sauce and their fantastic hot sauce and enjoy!  Such a simple concept but utterly fantastic.  Portions especially of the platters are huge and great for big eaters like me.  The protein is tender and delicious with either the rice or wraps but as everyone says that signature white sauce really gives it that distinct taste.  However I was really impressed with the hot sauce....most hot sauces are just too mild but their hot sauce has a serious kick to activate the endorphins in your body!  Both the white sauce and hot sauce comes in separate packets that you put on yourself.We got there early around 5pm so there was no crowd but I've heard from many on how long the lines can be at the lunch and dinner rushes.Based on price, portions and taste I can see why there is such a craze for the Halal Guys in New York.4.5/5!",19,5,14
6,Peter C.,"San Francisco, CA",366,425,173,4.0,11/17/2018,"A good place to get a cheap meal in NYC. There are many locations in Manhattan and apparently one back in my hometown of San Francisco which I have yet tried. This location is located at the corner of 6th Avenue and West 53rd Street, they actually have multiple carts on both sides of 6th Avenue. I guess they want to monopolize the Halal cart market at this intersection. I got the Chicken and Gyros Combo which was only $8 for a huge platter of food. The chicken and gyros was very flavorful and tender. They give so much meat that it's a thick layer covering all the rice. In addition, they include a few slices of pita bread, lettuce, white sauce and red sauce. The white sauce is a must, but be careful with the red sauce if you cannot handle spicy. Be sure to mix the entire platter with the sauces before eating. Depending on the time and day there can be long lines, but it is worth the wait. The service here is fast with no frills. You order, pay and hand you the food. They are also cash only, so make sure you go to the ATM beforehand. Overall a good budget meal for those visiting NYC.",1,1,1
7,Doug M.,"Chesterfield, MO",83,451,1654,5.0,11/10/2018,"Oh yeah!  Freshly cooked and shredded chicken with tasty spices, over a bed of tender rice and greens on the side - add the tzatziki sauce drizzled over the top - you can't miss.  There's a reason the line stretches down the block.  Quality food at a cheap price right on the street corner, and open until 4 am.  Satisfies that late night hunger with a healthy, delicious choice.  Oh, and get a side of hummus and pita!",,,

9,Christopher K.,"Sacramento, CA",226,141,1335,4.0,9/17/2018,"CAUTION...Hot damn.  Literally...I mean that spicy sauce is no joke.  They actually have 3 sauces you can pick from - a creamy white sauce, a bbq sauce, and of course that super duper hot sauce.  Proceed with caution even if you like spicy.  I wasn't expecting much from a lil food stand but much to my surprise, it was pretty damn delicious and I'm craving it right now as we speak.  The food stand is so busy that everyone gets their order fresh right off the grill, which is a plus.  I got the combo with rice and I recommend you do too.  Get in line and get it while its hot.  lol.",3,,1

11,Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",196,350,46,4.0,11/4/2018,"How does The Halal Guys in NY taste so much better than the other locations? One recently opened up in SF and it's so bland. Well after a late night out in NY, a couple of us were starving and wondered what we could devour at 3am. My friend suggested we should go to Halal Guys as its less than a 30 min walk and he promised us the original location tastes way better than other ones we've tried.He didn't lie. It was way better here. Of course we waited ~30 mins in line, but it was definitely worth it. The combo over rice is always my go to for a halal cart and this one didn't disappoint either. Also for those of you who are completely new to halal cart food, please use the red sauce sparingly. I've lost many good friends to it. RIP.",,,
12,Alice Y.,"Downtown, Baltimore, MD",35,25,19,5.0,11/19/2018,"Oh wow. This place lives up to the hype. I smelt the food before I even saw the stand.

Absolutely brilliant.",,,
13,Diana S.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,130,294,5.0,10/27/2018,"Tourist or not, THIS is the place to get your halal food. I don't care how much they expand and to where, I'll always come back to this (original) location. The food cart is open all day and late night. You can almost always expect a line but it moves quickly since they have all the ingredients already cooking. My go-to order is the chicken and gyro mixed combo over rice and this is more than enough for a meal. The platter is good for sharing unless you're really hungry or I sometimes save half for later. It comes with a bit of lettuce and a couple pieces of warm pita over yellow rice. It's a must that you top it off with a packet (or two) of the white sauce along with some bbq sauce and maybe a drop of hot sauce if you're looking for a kick that day. But BEWARE, even the tiniest drop of that red sauce will burn. Mix it all up and there you go, a tasty New York food cart staple!",1,,2

I spent $8 on a plate. I guess that's a little for the amount of food they give ya. But I can get many many delicious tacos with that money.The meat is dry and flavorless. I had two bites and couldn't take it anymore. I gave my plate to a homeless person.",2,2,1
15,Anju S.,"Bellerose, Queens, NY",16,58,82,2.0,11/2/2018,"Maybe I should give it 1 star but 2 it is for the portion and quick service. Heard a lot about them and I been in NYC for so long and didn't try this place sounds pretty sad. I drove all the way from Bellerose to try their falafel platter. The portions are good, falafels were good, but I wonder why the platter has just lettuce not anything else probably tomatoes or some other veggies. Being a vegetarian I do except places to be a little more generous in creating something more than just a meal that seems like every other meal. I can get rice, lettuce and falafel anywhere. There's gotta be something unique about this place but nope they failed for me. I drove to their location around 11:30pm and I was excepting an exciting meal. What really upset me was that there was a small piece of rock in my food. I have accidentally put it in my mouth and I heard it crunch in between my teeth. By the time I got home it was pretty late so didn't get a chance to take a picture of the food because I was so long hungry. Considering the traffic in that area took me good 50 mins to get back. This place may be great for meat lovers but for me as a vegetarian I excepted something different. Considering this was my first time the rock situation was not good. Totally ruined my experience. So overall this place is a no go for me. One time experience checked off my list for sure. Never again!!!",,,

17,Angela J.,"Washington, DC",73,91,241,3.0,11/14/2018,"Eh, we weren't so keen. A huge portion, with lots of rice and sauce. It wasn't the best Middle Eastern food or way to waste calories. It will satisfy a hungry person after a night or drinking no doubt. Didn't do great things to the insides either. Late night food, that you wish you never had but probably enjoyed.

I'd give them 5 stars if the rice was better, more moist. it's a bit dry. Would definitely come back. It was worth the wait! Luckily the line wasn't too long so we waited only about 15 minutes. Note: Make sure you have cash. My boyfriend and I didn't have cash on us but the guy in front borrowed me a $20 bill while my boyfriend ran to the ATM.

It's a small food truck across Hilton hotel- it'll be easy to spot because there will be a lot of people lined up to get this divine halal food. I think it may be more popular at late night, but if is generally pretty crowded all throughout the day. People are sitting by the water fountain areas/benches to eat this food. You can add as much white sauce and red sauce as you want, but you really have to be careful with that red sauce... it burns your tongue. I ended up wasting my platter one time because i added excessive amount of red sauce. My go to menu is beef and chicken over rice with a lot of white sauce. It comes with pita bread.",4,1,1
20,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",75,66,65,5.0,10/12/2018,"Picture this: got off my delayed flight at 1AM, goes home and the bf propose to go try the Halal Guys' food cart. How could I say no? When I got there, the line was short. There were huge piles of meat on the cart and I was ready to try the hype. We ordered a combo platter and a gyro. Sprayed white sauce everywhere, along with the red spicy one. Now let me tell you about that yellow rice. It was flavourful and adds so much to the plate. The meat was also tasty, a bit salty granted, but the overall mix with the sauces, the different meat and the rice was just delicious. No wonder there's a hype, it's totally worth it. Best after delayed flight midnight snack EVER!",2,1,1
21,Michael C.,"Orlando, FL",570,261,846,4.0,10/4/2018,"The first few times I went to Halal guys I was definitely in love. But like most loves I fell our if it with time and realized that they were much better things out there. Side note this review is about food so don't read too into it lmao. Anyways what you realize about Halal guys is that even though the food is really good really quick and there's a lot of it, Halal food in general is just very good. When you're in New York you cannot pass a street without seeing a Halal cart. Often the food just as good and a few bucks heaped. I'm not talking about that Dank Halal cart where the meet is a little questionable and the white sauce is warm, no no no Halal food is just really good wherever you go. Now I would definitely say try these places out because you're probably get more greens, number one, and number two you'll be supporting local people rather than the Halal conglomerate. Anyways I still go to Halal guys because of the sheer fact that they give you as much white sauce as you want, but it's definitely not the only place I go to nowadays.Basically if you're new to New York and it's cold night definitely want to hit up Halal guys and pour that white sauce on your food. But if you just craving good food any Halal cart will do",3,2,1
22,Andrew H.,"Philadelphia, PA",399,90,97,5.0,8/11/2018,"I went to the East Village location first and did not like it at all. I actually gave it 2/5 stars, which is pretty low for my standard. But, given how famous it is, I wanted to give the original truck a try.My roommate came back one day with a chicken over rice with some sauces he mixed in and I loved it. He added barbecue, a bit of hot sauce, and white sauce, which was amazing (who would've guessed barbecue would be good on halal?).I decided to come here to give it a shot. I really liked it. The portion was larger than that of East Village's - there was a lot more rice and chicken and a lot less salad. They gave us enough sauce packets to liberally add however much you wanted to it. The chicken was not dry, and the rice was just as you'd expect. The drinks are also cheap.If you didn't like an experience at another location, I'd come to the original and try it out!",1,,1

25,Vincent P.,"Alhambra, CA",328,365,755,4.0,8/5/2018,"I've heard of Halal Guys before, but I never went out of my way to try it in the West Coast. Thus, the original location is my first time trying them. The food cart located on a busy street near Times Square and there are some public seating available around the area. There are multiple carts, but my friend recommended going to the one with the longest line because that is the best one. We came here around 5pm and the line wasn't too long. I ordered a Combo plate with chicken and gyro. The classic Halal Guys plate includes slices of pita bread, meat, lettuce, and rice. However, what makes the plate delicious is their white sauce and hot sauce. Mix a lot of white sauce into the plate because that's where most of the flavors come from. As for the hot sauce, it is VERY spicy. I added a bit in the beginning to test it out and then continued adding more as I ate. My friends who had Halal Guys on the West Coast said that the hot sauce here is much more hotter than the locations they've been to. Lastly, the portion size is pretty dang big. I ordered one for myself and I barely finished it. I would recommend sharing it with someone because it's a good amount of food to consume in one meal.I enjoyed the chicken and gyro plate from Halal Guys, but it isn't something I would consider a favorite food. The meal was great, but I don't crave for it. Also, after eating the bowl for a while, I got a bit tired of it. That's another reason why I recommend sharing it with someone so that you don't get sick of it. Overall, Halal Guys is a a decent place for food, and it's definitely a great choice for a meal.",1,,1

We don't get good middle eastern food where I'm from in Nova Scotia so this was on the top of the list of places to try. These guys are open LATE. Until 6am at least on Fridays.  It's $8 for a large plate of food which was most certainly more than I could eat. I got a chicken platter. The guys were somewhat surly but maybe I would be too if I was waiting on drunk people at 1am. The platter had a small, boring salad made with iceberg lettuce, a good portion of rice and chicken and a few pieces of pita. They give you packets of their signature sauce and hot sauce. Their sauce reminds me of ranch dressing, I was expecting the potent garlic sauce that you see on shawarma wraps, but it was still tasty. The hot sauce was hot hot hot and delicious. The pita bread was nice and soft, the rice was a bit bland and the chicken wasn't dry at all. The salad didn't really get touched. Yeah anyway, it's not bad for the price but I was expecting something more than ""ok"" based on the reviews",4,,

This location is the real deal, providing delicious (and addictive) platters of chicken/beef... I always go for the combo platter because why not have both type of meats if you can, right?Beware that the red sauce is extremely spicy, I would put little to none unless you want a numb tongue and watery eyes. My suggestion would be to just stick with the white sauce-- It's so rich and adds plenty of flavor on it's own.Definitely check out halal guys if you're visiting NY and looking for some cheap but satisfying eats!",,1,

My most recent visit, the taste was more bland than I was used to, even with all the white sauce piled on (and I put a LOT). I feel like it's really dry without other sauces. I was very disappointed because I was so excited to get Halal Guys with my friends again. I'm not sure if this was just a one time thing but I wouldn't really go get halal guys as much as I used to anymore. PS if you're on a diet, I really wouldn't recommend this place.

I love spice but I actually steer clear off the red sauce here because it is so damn spicy... definitely not trying to burn off my taste buds anytime soon.

But in that world, I wouldn't care what other people thought, because I might not live past 20 with the amount of cholesterol, sodium and saturated fat in my diet.All jokes aside, these ""guys"" are some of, if not the best Halal carts in the business. I do love Rafiqui's too, but there's something unique about this style. Maybe it's the yellow rice, or the now served in packets versions of their sauce with nutritional info, or maybe it's how they sort of finely dice all the meat. Whatever they're doing, the spices and massive portion of food in a round container are a winner.Cheap, hot and delicious. All the things I look for in partne... I mean meal. If you're looking for Halal, and in midtown, you've gotta stop here. Get a combo platter with some hot and white sauce, dump both packets and don't think about nutrition, well-being, or any of that nonsense.Just think about pleasure, because as Guy Fieri loves to say ""You're about to enter flavor town""",,1,

It's quick and it's so, so, fu***** amazing. I ordered the Beef Halal, and it was packed with meat and flavor.  If I ever get another chance of having this, I'm going to try to lean towards the combo platter. I just got the gyro as it was portable and we were on the way to walk to Central Park.I would highly, highly recommend to try their food out. Even if you're not going to eat it immediately, order it, take it to go, and eat it some time later. It's that good. This is definitely not a over-hyped place, and that all the reviews are true.

We walked a bit out of our way to make sure we tried the best!The hype is pretty legit for this cart. Like I said, I've tried outpost brick & mortar locations in Chicago which were fine...but this cart? It was delicious.There was a huge difference in taste, not to mention service. We saw the guy working the cart describe to confused tourist clients sizing even though they asked about 50 questions on the topic and one even asked what hummus was. I was standing there thinking, y'all it's a street cart! Order and go! But the guy working was so kind answering with patience everything they asked. Get the combo platter. Be sure to douse in their magical white sauce. If you like spicy, add a few drops of that, but be warned it's realllllly spicy. Even if you've had Halal Guys in your hometown, get it from this cart.

38,Miranda K.,"Buffalo, NY",88,52,21,5.0,5/27/2018,Stopped here during a trip to NYC based on some Yelp recommendations. The food did not disappoint. There's a couple locations but we visited this one specifically as it was near our hotel.  There was a huge line around 10:30 pm but it went by really quickly. The workers seem to have the process down to a science. This is my first time having street food and I'm really happy with it. I got the chicken/gyro platter. Now I'm just upset I won't be able to find something like this back home in Buffalo. Pro tip: load up on as much white sauce as you can. It's the bomb.,2,1,1
39,Sana S.,"Cachet, Markham, Canada",3,2,3,1.0,10/20/2018,"After hearing about this place for years, I was excited to try it while in NYC. I was quite disappointed. I ordered the chicken platter for $8 which was served very quickly. It came with a sad piece of pita, 3 shreds of lettuce, and tasteless chicken on top of a heap of stale yellow rice. Safe to say that I did not enjoy this meal at all. The white sauce was good but it shouldn't be carrying the whole meal. P.S. the hot sauce is extremely hot, so be warned.",3,1,1
40,Alexander A.,"New York, NY",23,58,140,4.0,5/8/2018,"***Overall - great for street food but otherwise just averageWhat I got - combination platterTaste - good for street meat. The flavors were very enjoyable because it was seasoned well and had a little spiciness. I added both packets of dressing they provided which was good on its own and great when mixed with the rest of the dish. However, the chicken and beef were cooked inconsistently and some pieces were dry while others we not. The pita was not soft and seemed like it was bought at the corner bodega. As a result, I wouldn't recommend the wrap.Value - very good, $8 and there was enough for two mealsService - I got lucky and there was no line so it was ready by the time I finished paying.Atmosphere - N/A, it's a food cartFacility - N/A, it's a food cartNeed to know - meat is a little spicyWould I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - Maybe***Rating justification - For a restaurant, this place is serving average food at below average prices. However, it's not a restaurant, it's a food cart and they are doing a pretty good job considering. As a brick and mortar restaurant this place would probably get three stars.",7,5,6
41,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,2.0,5/7/2018,"I had Halal Guys when I first moved to New York and accidentally added too much red sauce. I promptly avoided it for years. However, as I work nearby, my curiosity got the better of me and I returned to try it on a warm spring day.Around noon on a weekday, the line was virtually nonexistent, which surprised me. There was still a bit of a wait as they were switching over their meats. Chicken and rice is $8, which is a decent premium to other carts, but I challenge you to finish this in one sitting.Once I was back at my desk, I was pleasantly surprised that it was still warm. Unfortunately, the chicken was absurdly dry. Their famous white sauce failed to perk it up-- I don't understand why all the raves when it tasted like nothing to me. The red sauce is nothing to mess around with, but it makes it tough to make a consistently mildly spiced experience. The rice was decent, as were the pita and lettuce.I don't know... it lasted me two meals, which I appreciate, but I was never happy to be eating it. I don't mean to be a Halal Hater, but I really don't get the hype here.",7,2,3

We've been to the franchise chains in Va and to be honest they are just ok. Meat is dry and nothing great. Had to see the difference with the flagship. So, what do we think???  Super tasty. The chicken is much more juicy and the gyro meat is very flavorful. Lives up to the hype.  My kids give it 4.5 stars.",,,

The line is long- expect a wait. Once at the window- you get your standard halal options-  the extras are what make the halal guys amazing. They give the most side foods with the meat and rice in nyc- like olives- pita bread- corn-etc. Amazing experience on its own- not just for the food. Love it or dump it? Absolutely love it,,,3

They have only a few basic options (3 or 4?), and that's all you get to choose from. There's no fancy terms or cool toppings, you get what you get. The portion is generous, and I'd be impressed if you finish the entire thing. Loads of meat, and really like how they didn't go easy with the sauces!

I ordered beef shawarma with salad.. nothing more. The beef had zero flavor and was drenched with salt. I was dehydrated with cotton mouth for the rest of the night. Apparently, they get the meat on skewers already pre seasoned with tons of salt ... I wasn't thrilled about it honestly. And their dressings/condiments aren't too great either. You have white sauce (basically mayo and vinegar) and HOT sauce that just leaves you with a horrible burn of regret that you tasted it. No offense guys, but you need to work on your flavoring.",7,4,4

As someone who lives and works in New York now, I don't go as much any more and maybe that's for the best because I would most likely be 500 lbs overweight by now. Regardless, this place is a must try for tourists! The lines are long but the wait is so worth and the food is always hot and fresh. Be careful with the hot sauce cause I always make the mistake of pouring the whole packet in when you probably only need a 1/4 - getting hot thinking about it.",,,

Not just anything, Halal Guys. My friend is a purist and not just any halal cart would do so we hopped in an Uber to the OG Halal Guys cart on 53rd Street and 6th Avenue. This location has one size only combo platters for $8. They don't slather on the sauce for you, so you have to put it on yourself. I like this a lot better but I can see why in California, they don't do this for health/cleanliness reasons. We ordered the combo gyro and chicken plate. Guys, it is legit good and BETTER than what we get in California. I understand the hype now. The rice is straight up buttery in flavor. The gyro meat is DELICIOUS. The chicken was on the meh side but slathered in the white & red sauce, it was magical. I honestly did not get it before. Also, we didn't get any tomatoes but at 1 am, I didn't much care about it other than stuffing food into my mouth. If you're a fan of halal food and in the city, check out the original Halal Guys cart on 53rd & 6th.",11,8,8

As the years have passed, the prices have steadily gone up, which is fair. The unfortunate part is the portions are not only getting smaller and smaller, but the quality has decreased. It's simply not as good as it use to be. A lot less flavorful. I'm honestly bummed since I loved this place and came regularly.",2,,
51,Jordan I.,"Salt Lake City, UT",11,80,49,4.0,10/24/2018,"There are 5000 Halal trucks in NYC, and there is one you eat at: The Halal Guys. I always choose the original on 53rd and 6th. Now, they've expanded so much, you don't have to wait in long ass lines like we used too. With that expansion the experience has definitely diminished a little, but it's still the only Halal truck I eat in NYC. ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: if you've never eaten Halal Guys before, they're going to give you a red little sauce pack with your food. You should know that it's literally mouth-numbing, belly-scorching, ass-melting sauce IF you get about more than 10 total drops of it on your meal. So, remember, it's like salt, you can add some, but you can't take it off once it's on there. If you want to function normally the next day, and you know what I mean, go easy on the hot sauce.",,,

Impressed by the first Halal Guys I had on 14th St, I had high expectations for the cart! Just a one man station, but he seemed to be holding down the fort pretty well. We ordered two platters and a gyro, and not only did our food cost only $22, but it was out within 3 minutes! I can't think of any speedier service. We went over to the local McDonald's and ate our food as we ordered our coffee. The food still remained warm despite our walk over in biting 40 degree weather! Overall, the beef platter was very savory, and its tastiness was augmented by the lovely yet very fattening magical white sauce. The vegetables' flavor was upstaged by the white sauce, so I wasn't able to really get a good taste on them. I also wished there was more rice available, but it also tasted good. Overall, a great place to get some cheap food! It's probably the only place I recommend eating at when in the Times Square area!",,,

I don't know how they make their beef and chicken so well and so uniquely, but it's got me hooked. Halal guys is the meal I go for to treat myself. I always get the chicken and beef combo because they are both so delicious, I can't imagine just getting one. Even their white sauce is spectacular. I love that they have their sauces in packets so if you want to take your food to go, it won't get soggy in sauce. Other Halal carts don't do that.

Great food if you live in New York City and want something sort of cheap and a fair amount of food for the price....If you've ever had decent food anywhere else I'm not sure this is worth a visit.

The sauces are pretty similar, nothing noticeable unless if you're tasting them side by side. This one is also cheaper, here it's $8 while $10 SF.

I am really disappointed that the white sauce is now in packets. It doesn't taste as fresh as it used to be when they were in bottles.

After we split it, we were full! I don't think I could have finished the whole thing. He absolutely loved it, but I thought the meat could have been more flavorful.

Take a bite and find your tongue dancing a thousand different ways. The line might seem intimidating with upwards of 40 people waiting at a time but it is so worth it. I recommend the beef gyro with 1 strip of red (spicy) sauce and 2.5 strips of white (mild/yogurt) sauce for newbies, or 2 strips of red sauce and 3 stripes of white for more experienced chicken and rice eaters. Be careful trying to find this place, they're the cart that's right next to Starbucks. There's about 5 or 6 other chicken and rice carts around the area claiming they're the famous ones you want to try but NO! You'll know you've reached the right cart when you see the long but quick moving line and guys wearing their characteristic yellow shirts with red lettering. Will definitely go again! So so so good. None of the stand alone stores they've popped up in different cities around the country compare to this location which is crazy because it's a cart.

It's not even a stretch to say this was my favorite thing I ate during my three day work trip here. It was simple, inexpensive, and tasty. The Halal Guys have quite an operation set up on the corner of 53rd & 6th. One guy takes your order and money (cash only), and three or four are preparing orders for fast, fresh, and hot service. Down the block, they have two extra grills set up for additional food, and around the corner, another one. So the food itself. I got the falafel sandwich ($6), which also happens to be one of my all time favorite foods. This one was amazing. Hot and crispy falafel balls. Soft and warm pita. Plenty of fresh lettuce. All in a perfect foil package. You may notice in the pics that I ordered it without the white sauce. Sometimes it is just way too much for me, and I don't like my falafel soggy or soupy. Well, they accidentally made it with the sauce. I told the guy who handed it to me that I ordered it without, and before I could even finish saying ""...but don't worry about it,"" he immediately apologized, started making a new one, apologized again that I would have to wait an additional minute, and then handed me a fresh one a few seconds later with a big smile. Holy falafel balls, customer service! I couldn't believe it. And for the record, a part of me regretted not getting it with the sauce because it looked like the perfect amount. There's always next time. And there will be a next time, because I am specifically coming to this cart for my next NYC falafel. And you should, too.",1,1,1

While you're waiting, the aroma of grilled meats fills the air and within minutes, a big plate (or handheld) of food is given to you. Make sure to ask for their famous white sauce and go easy on the hot sauce - it'll make your mouth numb without notice.Since it's a street vendor, there's no seating. Luckily there's some benches nearby, but they get crowded really fast.

72,Angela K.,"Manhattan, NY",359,368,119,2.0,6/16/2018,"No one is going to care about this review among thousands, but as someone who's been going to Halal Guys for years, I must write this.I was always a huge fan and would have given it five stars several years ago. Throughout the years, I slowly saw some changes.The beloved white sauce: there's always been huge dispensers of these for those eating at the cart. What about to go? They used to give those out for free (many years ago) but eventually started charging for them. I understand this to a degree since I'm sure its popularity probably caused people to hoard this magical sauce, but it was disappointing when I would take a reasonable number (1-2 packets) with an order.I didn't know at first that the lamb was changed to beef - and I definitely noticed a huge difference. This was not placebo effect or just ""in my head"" - I did more research after this, and it turns out that they switched to beef after franchising. The taste of the original Halal Guys and the reason for its popularity is now gone (for me, at least).The last time I went, I had some drunk jerk knock the plate out of my hand and walk away! The guy working there witnessed the whole thing. I asked him if there was anything he could do, and he coldly told me to get back in line. Technically not his fault, but I'll remember this.This incident alone wouldn't stop me from going back, but the decline in quality and their general unfriendly attitude toward their customer base makes me unwilling to go back.Such a shame - a quality NYC establishment is no longer. They have officially sold out.",12,1,1

As a Californian, I have been a regular at the Halal guys near my area, but last year I was able to visit these guys, the OGs. Everything tasted so much better. Now that I'm back again in the NYC area, I decided to pay a visit and allow one of my friends to try some of their OG goodness. He enjoys their food as much as I do, so he was very excited to try the food and see the original halal guys. Even though it was cold as heck, we walked over to their stand and ordered their delicious combo platter. Boy oh boy were they generous with the meat! This is one of the things I like about them, they're not stingy and the price is unbelievably cheap. Lines are a lot shorter now compared to before, but that's probably because they have other stands around the same area. Be sure you're going to the right one though. Don't be fooled by the other stands around the area. Some may say they're the original, but don't be fooled!Finally having a bite from this spot after a year brought me back to the start of 2017.

I got the combo plate, and let me tell you, it was amazing. You gotta add the white sauce, it makes so much of a difference. It is creamy rich goodness! The hot sauce they give you is also quite spicy so eat with caution. However the spicy sauce adds such a nice kick to the platter itself, but if you do not like spicy, i would not recommend you to add any!Each platter comes with salad, rice, a few pita bread and your choice of meat. It is a pretty big portion, I could never finish 1 by myself. I usually split it with someone or save half for tomorrow. They have around 4-5 food carts along  53rd street stretching from 6th to 7th i believe. When I went, there was no line. Given I did go on a rainy day at 2pm. I am from california so my flight was pretty long with 1 layover. I brought three containers home with no spills and tastes perfectly fine!",1,2,1
77,Jan Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",545,50,498,5.0,9/10/2018,"There are many things that make New York City iconic. Never mind the long list of famous landmarks, museums, buildings, and restaurants in the city, my favorite New York City icon is undoubtedly the unassuming little food cart on 53rd and 7th with the consistently long lines and the distinct smell of freshly cooked street meat: the original Halal Guys.Don't get put off by the long lines. After all, this is fast food at its core. Because of their long hours (10am-4am most evenings), you can fulfill your craving for chicken and rice with their signature white sauce and just the right amount of spicy hot red sauce whenever it's convenient. Never mind that the lines are still long at 11pm after you get out of your late night Broadway show, the wait is always worth it. Chicken over rice is my go-to, followed by the combo platter of chicken and gyro over rice. Each platter comes with a generous helping of yellow rice, a small side of lettuce and tomato, pita bread, and your choice of meat. While it is good as is, take advantage of their white, red, and bbq sauces to take your Halal Guys experience to greater heights! I like a generous helping of white sauce, topped off with justttt a single stripe or a couple small dots (yes, dots!) of the hot sauce, as it is very very spicy! You've been warned! These platters are best enjoyed streetside along with other hungry patrons. Take your time to talk to your fellow diners, and I guarantee you will meet some interesting characters from around the city, and the world. If you are traveling and want to take a platter (or 2 or 3) home, I suggest doing yourself a favor and purchasing some sturdy tupperware-style containers to pack up your plate of goodness as the foil containers simply don't travel well! Again, you've been warned :]So overall...The good: You simply can't go wrong with their signature chicken and rice plate. Enjoy it with your favorite combination of sauces and eat outside. The ambience adds to the experience exponentially.The bad: If you can't handle spicy foods, avoid the red sauce. I LOVE spicy food and too much red sauce can ruin a plate for me.The ugly: There will be tears shed if you try to take a chicken and rice platter home on the plane in your backpack in one of their foil containers. Trust me on this one. Bring a container if you want to enjoy one of these babies at home! You will also cry if you don't have any cash, but there are plenty of ATMs nearby!",1,,2

79,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,5.0,2/25/2018,"The Halal guys is a casual Middle Eastern fast food cart. The menu is simple and relatively inexpensive, containing only rice plates and sandwiches with chicken, beef gyro, falafel. You also are given creamy savory white sauce and spicy red sauce. Portions are generous! Probably my go to for fast simple ME food.There are a lot imitation carts, but I think you can tell by the packaging. Apparently there is usually a large queue, I went at 3PM and it was only a 5m wait.Ordered:Combo rice bowl - a very large portion that made me really full. The chicken and beef were bbqed well. What stood out to me was the flavor of the orange rice, super rich! I used both the red and white sauce. They're both good, just beware the red sauce was surprisingly hot!",,,
80,Sujoyee C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",39,71,1,2.0,6/4/2018,"Going to Halal Guys was like peer pressure. So many reviews, every one was talking about it - I had to try it! I understand people love it here in NYC, but I could not justify the trip to their cart with the food I got. It was basic halal cart food with a magical packet of white sauce. In all honestly, I do think the white sauce is 70-80% mayo, full fat mayo. It was chicken, rice and white sauce. I did not get the big deal and neither did i like the food.",3,3,1

But It lives and surpasses all expectations. The balance of soft chicken with warm rice. The contrast of fresh crisp lettuce, and the white sauce and barbecue sauce to tie it all together. Perhaps it's that it's only $10. And you are eating at the worlds greatest outdoor patio, the streets of New York. The lights. The glamour. The grime. The culture. The history. The fame. Right in the capital of planet earth. Downtown Manhattan. Thank you halal guys. Single handedly making New York that much better.",,,

84,Dina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12,71,157,5.0,7/7/2018,"100% must have halal when visiting NYC. I've been coming here for years and the only difference then and now is that their signature white sauce and hot sauce is now in packets so you can take even more with you. My go to order is the chicken and beef combo on a pita. The meat is extremely juicy and tender with a good char from the flat top. The pita is the perfect thickness and adds the best bite with the meat, lettuce and tomato. The white sauce is a must and as a spicy lover their hot sauce is not comparable. Whenever I'm craving halal this is the #1 place to go. The line is sometimes a bit long but the food is well worth it. A bit more $$ than some of the other carts in the area but they are not all the same. 10/10 would recommend",,,

You can beat the feeling of a -14 degrees, bone chilling, 12:15am Saturday night, holding the warm ass bowl of a combo plate soaked in white sauce. Truly, the experience is irreplaceable. Having the same bowl in LA is way different than on 52nd. When in NY, must stop midnight pound.",1,,
88,Helen T.,"Garden Grove, CA",911,88,242,5.0,5/23/2018,Okay Halal Guys definitely lived up to the hype!! I came on a rainy Thursday night around 9PM and there was a short line. We waited about 5 minutes before we got our food. I ordered the combo platter over rice and DEVOURED it! I didn't think it would be that great since the Halal Guys in California is not that great. Everyone already knows how amazing the white sauce is so I won't say much about that. The red sauce is SPICY. But I love spicy food so it was amazing! Just make sure you don't put too much of it before trying it first. Not much else to say that others haven't already mentioned... will be back soon!!,4,2,2

It tastes terrible right?If you get Halal you 100% need the white sauce because it will go from terrible to okay.But the logic is, if you have to put sauce to mask the terrible food.The food is terrible period.It's like getting terrible food and paying $6-10 for the sauce and a free drink.",,,
91,Karen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,173,744,5.0,12/4/2017,"What you need to know: - Beware: there are many copy cats but the southwest corner of 53rd and 6th Ave is the real deal! You will know because of the long line! - Their cart states they are there all day and almost all night! This was not always the case, in the past, they opened up after 7pm. - Cash only! - I have tried other locations and they just can't seem to replicate the perfection of this specific cart. - This food is based off their Egyptian origins. What I always order: - Chicken platter price $8 - I don't know how they cook this but the chicken is incredibly succulent and the rice is the perfect complement. You MUST coat it with their magical white yogurt sauce, it is the sauce that brings it all together, making it savory, greasy, juicy and just down right to die for! Beware: the hot sauce is REALLY spicy, just put a little! Notes: I have tried their lamb but it has a weird texture, so don't be tempted to get the combo platter, just get the chicken platter!!!!",2,,1

IT IS AMAZING. my friend dropped the two containers and it definitely dented the food containers, BUT NOTHING SPILLED OUT. The sauces, on the other hand, popped open haha. Portion sizes are huge for $8. I had a generous amount of chicken over the rice. Absolutely delicious. Tip: drench your bowl with white sauce!!! (Don't look at the calories hahaa) so good! I definitely recommend this place if you're eating on a budget. You can easily make this two meals for just $8 or just share a plate with someone!",,,
93,Robin Y.,"San Francisco, CA",171,157,268,4.0,5/7/2018,"OG halal, wonderful. Beware of red sauce. Take some probiotics before and or after if you're concerned.

94,Shar M.,"Concord, CA",151,362,977,3.0,6/13/2018,"The first time I had Halal Guys was in the City, and by the City, I mean San Francisco, because California is where I'm from. I visited their restaurant location on O'Farrell St and had a falafel sandwich, doused in white sauce. It was good, okay, not fantastic, and extremely salty. When I told my sister, who lives in NYC, that I didn't think much of Halal Guys, she responded, ""It's because you did it wrong.""My husband knew better and had ordered the combination rice plate, which comes with beef and chicken. I had a few bites of his, but still thought the meat was overcooked, and the dish overall extremely salty. I was parched afterwards.I just came back from visiting my sister in NYC and she took us to this location, the original Halal Guys food cart that started it all. Here we had the combination rice plate, doused in white sauce, and I had a much better experience. The meat was not overcooked, and the dish as a whole was very tasty and fulfilling.So, if I could give a rating just based on the food, I'd give them 4.5 stars. A little more lettuce might have been nice.As for service, yes there was a long line, but it was moving along quickly... until... a shift change. Somehow, all operations came to a halt, and the staff were quite rude as they swapped out with each other. It's like they completely forgot they even had customers in line. So, I subtracted stars based on the service and the wait time that resulted from this.",,1,1

The food was just amazingggg! There is another halal guys truck across the street but definitely try to go to this one since it's the original one. An advice: don't make the mistake I made and put a lot of red hot sauce! Just put very very little red sauce and a lot of white sauce!!!",,,2
96,Jim B.,"Nashua, NH",15,352,332,3.0,6/19/2018,"The Halal Guys offer about six or so dishes from a food truck. I got the chicken and gyro meat combo that came with shredded carrots and lettuce in an aluminum tin. You are given two packages of Tzatziki sauce and one packet of hot sauce. Your food is cooked on a second food truck nearby and assembled in production line manner at the retail truck. Payment is by cash only. The meats were quite good and the vegetables were fresh. I thought the sauce was rather flavorless. I made the mistake of putting all of the hot sauce on my meal and it was incredibly hot. There was far to much food for lunch. I should have stopped and left half of it it I didn't. Overall I'm glad I tried it because it is one of the hottest food trucks in NYC. Now I know what it's all about. By the way, my rating is based solely on my personal preference for food. You may have a different opinion.",,,

I discovered Halal Guys on my FIRST visit to NYC way back when and have been coming here ever since during each visit.  It's definitely a must when in NYC.  Although they have franchised out and there are quite a few locations in California now, I still prefer the ORIGINAL ONE. Their RED SAUCE is to DIE FOR, literally.  My peeve is when places advertise their hot sauce as spicy and it's not.  Maybe it's because I can handle a little more heat than most people, but still.  Halal's Red Sauce is actually SPICY and it's delicious! I brought the BF to Halal Guys on 11/14/17 after visiting the Top of the Rock before heading down to the High Line.  I accidentally put a little too much red sauce in it and it wasn't as enjoyable for him because he was dying.  WHOOOOOPS.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed it though!",1,,1

Sadly I could only eat half due to the pain and had to through away the rest, which sucks because the chicken was cooked well. It was really bland without sauce so add that white sauce and go easy on the hot sauce. I also didn't like how they give shredded carrot instead of rice.

I'm sure they are all good, but this is the original one I've been trying to get to for YEARS.  I've been to the Las Vegas ""restaurant"" and this is probably better, even when it's cold.

Walking around Manhattan after a long day of traveling and going around NYC, it was late night, we were super hungry and things around here are pricey just because is Manhattan, we found this spot and ordered a platter (chicken and lamb/gyro), and decided to order only one and check the size before ordering a second one. They order came put extremely fast and the size was more than enough for 2 people!This is a stand in the middle of the street, so there's not seats, but we got the change to seat around and it was delicious! Very tasty, good portion of meat, the proportion of the rice compared to the meat was good. Both of us were full and still having some left overs, and that doesn't happen often when sharing our meal. They have chicken, gyro sandwiches and falafel in the menu for $5. The mix platter was our option and they also have falafel over rice, platters are $7. They have different kinds of salsas that you can put in your meal, we didn't, but that's an option. Drinks are available too and I was surprised they didn't over charge those (food trucks sometimes over charge drinks to compensate the cheapness of their meals). But this wasn't the case, we got a Coke and water and paid $3... I thought that was fare.While eating we saw a lot of people buying to go, cars stopping, people on foot...

Though the experience was quicker and not like waiting back then in anticipation...We walked up to it by seeing 3-4 people man the original one. $8 for a combo of chicken and beef? Well worth it. We told them what we wanted, food was already cooking and kept warm in the grill, after paying, you step to the side and WHOOSH. A brightening yellow bag with The Halal Guys logo is handed towards you with your request. If you are eating with someone else make sure to ask for a extra fork. They now also have prepackaged white sauce (2 of them) and a packet of hot sauce.Presentation may seem plain at first, but combining the sauces in? It was an explosion of flavor. Meat is tender but a bit dry which adds to the crispness - quite well flavored. Meat may be a bit salty for some which is why we had the rice. Rice goes well with the white sauce and the spicy sauce. Wouldn't eat the rice on its own of course.If you are looking for seating, there is a public space area that's hidden nearby.

116,Zhang C.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",125,81,275,4.0,10/20/2017,"This is the most popular food cart in NYC. Well if you live in NYC and you did not try it, then you are missing out. This is an inexpensive meal so it does not hurt your budget by trying it even if you do not like it. At this location which is the original location, there is always a line from lunch time until very late at night. There are couple of food cart there and many people get confused which cart is the real halal guy cart. I always recommend people to find the cart with the longest line and order it from there. The line always move fast so do not worry about waiting in long line. Getting there before 12pm then you will find yourself in no line or short line. After that time, you expect your to wait roughly 10~15 minutes and still it is not that bad. First timers, I always recommend getting half chicken and half lamb on a platter unless you do not eat chicken, lamb or both. Each platter cost $8 in change including tax. Chicken is a bit plain but the lamb is very flavorful. I usually put good portion of sauces on the chicken platter and put less on the lamb. There are three major sauces at Halal Guys, white, BBQ and hot. Both the white and the BBQ sauce are great for the chicken but watch out for the hot sauce. The hot sauce is extremely hot so do not try to put the whole package in. (Clearly that was a WARNING!) everything else was good.",1,,2

118,Sai N.,"Hoboken, NJ",12,58,49,5.0,5/31/2018,"Best of the best in nyc! This is one of my favorite street foods in NY. I have been coming here for some many years, I've honestly lost count. I like having different things to eat and as a former meat eater I thought This was one place that I would miss.., but the falafel sandwich was just as amazing as the chicken. Let's all be honest and acknowledge that the white Sauce that has a billion calories is what makes the food taste amazing! I love the standing in line and waiting while watching my food being made! There are so many different options for drinks and I love them all! I am trying to remember how the set up was but I believe that the rice and salad are already cooked and ready to go and the pita is warmed up as they are cooking the chicken. I live to mix the white sauce with the hot sauce- WARNING- the word hot is accurate in this case. It's so spicy. Be careful!",,,
119,Rebecca Clay E.,"Lexington, KY",170,20,18,3.0,4/23/2018,"For street food, this is a really great option. The food is cooked fresh and you get a very large portion. However, the food did not ""wow"" me and that is what I expect from any food in NYC. I have had some pretty good falafel before and this was hard to compare. Without the ""white sauce"" it would have been bland. But overall, after a long day it was still a good warm meal and the experience of buying street food makes it taste even better! It is located across the street from the MoMA and it was an awesome quick option to grab after a long visit to the museum.",1,1,1

But I don't think it matters, because people will be lined up here regardless. Drown the combo plate in white sauce, couple drops of hot sauce (it's really freakin spicy), and when you're as sober as most of the other people in line, it always hits the spot.I will warn you, there is no bigger feeling of regret though, then waking up next to half eaten platter and rice all over the floor.",1,1,

I guess it does curb many different cravings at 3am. I still don't know if I'm at the right spot during the daytime, as it seems all corners of 53rd/6th has a yellow Halal Guys cart, but their line is unmistakeable and unavoidable during the late evening/early morning. The hot and white sauce now come in packets, which is quite convenient. But they still offer the same dry, shredded up halal meats and sad pita for $8. I prefer more heft in my chicken and lamb, preferably cubed vs shredded to smithereens.I highly suggest taking your money to the Biryani Cart, Royal Halal, Rafiqi's, etc before coming here.",8,4,4

Updated review","Still delicious as I remembered it. Although this time my chicken over rice didn't have any lettuce or tomatoes on it. Came here on a Friday night and there was line, which didn't take that long. I'm not sure if they ran out of the tomatoes and lettuce but I didn't see any. Also they initially didn't give me any bell peppers or onions on mine so I had to go back and ask for it. The guy didn't seem too happy but it's your fault giving it to us or for not asking us if we wanted it or not... also we said we were gonna take it togo and they didn't close it or give us any togo white sauce... and he told us to get the sauce ourselves which was on the side of the cart. They also have a BBQ sauce that I haven't seen before when I was here 3 years ago. They opened a Halal Guys in San Francisco but it is not the same. Also in SF, it is more expensive. Chicken over rice...I'll love you forever. Must have in NYC!**do not put too much red sauce if you can't handle spice. It is actually quite spicy!**",1,,2

Don't really know what that white sauce is, but it made me faint due to how AMAZING and DELICIOUS it is when combined with the orange rice.After that whole incident, I became obessed with ranch and yellow rice due to my New York withdrawals. My girlfriend keeps making fun of me for coming up with such a thing and she plans on getting me 50 bottles of ranch for my birthday.",4,2,4
127,Wenya Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,23,5,3.0,8/7/2018,"Honestly, I really do enjoy the food. I always get a combo over rice, extra white sauce and a drop of hot sauce. The chicken can be a little dry but the rice and sauce make up for it. The rice is done really well here, it not wet or bland like some other places. The white sauce is the best here, it makes everything tasty.  Whenever I get halal food at a different stand, I wish it was this. The only that irks me is the disorganized long lines and the guys can be pretty rude sometimes. I understand that it is popular therefore it can be a wait sometime but they let people cut and act pretentious to their customers.....it street food. New Yorkers made you guys popular, don't forget that! Without us, you wouldn't of expanded. P.S you can ask for sauce on the side.",1,,

Honestly, be careful with the red sauce though, because they do not warn you & as a spice lover, I still only put a couple of lines of it in my bowl. I love coming to this location, because the food is cheaper ($8) for a plate & the servings are larger than the actual stores!! I personally like the chicken better than the beef gyro, but if it's your first time, I'd recommend getting 1/2 & 1/2. Also ask for extra white sauce, bc it's bomb and you gotta drench your food in it lol. As for seating, you can take your food and walk a bit & sit in times square.. or if you wander a bit, there are some outdoor benches/chairs you can sit in that are a part of the nearby office buildings.",,,

Time and time again, this NYC institution has garnered so much popularity not bc ppl like the ring of ""halal guys"" (wait, 5 guys is pretty popular too)- most ppl can't even say ""Halal"" properly by the way- it's ""ha- lou(d)"" basically. That's my improper pronunciation break down for the even more unworthy. It's because it's deliciously, oily, fatty, spicy, cuminy and yogurty, meaty and hearty and fluffy with the long grain saffron-y rice. Oh my word, if weight was not an issue and cholesterol was not an issue I would halal guys all day and night all week long. That said, they are the best proportioned, well spiced and believe it or not- least oil ladened of all the food trucks boasting halal meat and rice. So it is like a blind taste test- and over and over people have spoken, the halal guys win because they've perfected the perfect spiced lamb to chicken to rice to sauce ratio. And the perfect white and red sauce to boot.",1,2,1
132,Rebekah L.,"San Diego, CA",77,9,7,5.0,7/14/2018,"Sooooo good! It's fast and cheap (for NY) and most importantly, delicious. It's $6 for a sandwich and $8 for a platter. The sandwiches have a very generous amount of meat! The white sauce is the best. I like to get the combo chicken/gyro meat, both of which are very moist and flavorful. The only negative thing I have to say is that the employees were incredibly rude. We immediately noticed that we were not given any hot sauce so we asked them for some but they argued with us saying that they had packed them, therefore we should have had them. It took a while before they reluctantly gave in and gave us one packet of sauce. I also watched a girl ask several times for a fork before they finally gave in and gave her one, very ungraciously. Please note that this was NOT during a rush time and there were only 2-3 people waiting behind and 4 workers.",3,1,2

It comes with sliced warm pita bread as well. Although overall the dish tasted good, I wish the chicken was seasoned and didn't look like it was boiled. The rice was also a vibrant orange which is not how I've seen it advertised everywhere. For $7 you get a lot of food. My recommendation: skip the hot sauce.

The food is good but not memorable. I ordered the beef gyro and mix (beef and chicken) platter. They got my order wrong and gave me both a mix gyro and mix platter. There is no seating but people generally sit on the planter in front of the halal food trucks. It's a very lively area and lots of people pass by but they manage to keep it fairly clean by sweeping when it is less busy. The verdict: try it but it's not something I would eat twice.,1,,

To me it didn't taste any different than the stuff we had in the bay, but not a bad thing! We shared a combo over rice, with a bunch of white sauce. And though we were careful with the hot sauce, they don't mess around with that spiciness!Everything, except the chicken which was rather bland and dry, was absolutely delicious. The lamb part was flavorful and juicy as I expected it, and the sauce (albeit spicy as oooohhh man) sealed the deal. Great food and if I'm in the area again (which I most likely will be), will be stopping by for some good ol Halal Guys. Hopefully no line next time as well.",,,1

141,Jacqueline V.,"Hoover, AL",26,84,304,5.0,9/24/2017,"So the infamous Halal guys... the original which ""original"" is actually written on the side of the truck so that you knew which of the many many halal food trucks was actually the one that made history. My goal: should it be as hyped up as it is? My answer: YES. Our vacation to NYC consisted of one aim - eat well. And we did. And, to break my long existing rule that while on vacation, never try a restaurant twice, we did it anyways. That's how good Halal guys was. We went twice on our 5 day vacation. To summarize, it's a food truck with a very limited menu. But why do you need a vast menu, when what you have was amazing? Maybe that was their idea behind that. Rice is the base, and you can choose between chicken beef or combination, comes with pita bread and a little bit of sauce... never stop at that little bit of sauce... always, may I repeat, always.... add more.The white sauce is from another planet. I've never tasted anything similar to this sauce so I'm not quite sure how to explain it. And I'll repeat what some of the previous reviews commented ""when you think you've had enough, add more.""The red sauce is incredibly spicy. I added a few drizzles but mixed in with the white sauce - astronomical power. Waiting time: I read there is a ton of people always trying to go eat here and the lines can go really long. However we had no wait both times we came because we went after our long days of adventure (Broadway's and such) and arrived around 10:30. Perfect right? No wait, the food was amazing, and our hike back to our airbnb made us feel like we somewhat burned off our heavy meal. Indeed, it is very heavy. So on my normal, non vacation self, I would not go that often. But keep in mind these portions are huge! For $8, my husband and I split a bowl and we were both incredibly full afterwards. The chicken was the best to us. Try the chicken plate, add tons of sauce, and take a walk after to make you feel less sore after eating such a heavy meal. Highly recommend. It hit every high point for me. You come expecting an amazing food truck, well I definitely got to eat from an amazing food truck.",1,,1

What makes this halal so good, in my opinion, is the chicken. The chicken has a very distinctive taste, almost smoky. It is a bit dry, but the texture just feels so good in your mouth. Their rice displays a pleasing color that's been perfectly seasoned with chicken broth, butter, and salt.I honestly don't find myself enjoying the pita breads, but it's not terrible. Other people, however, find the pita bread to be one of the best parts about halal. Finally their sauces. The cherry on top...Their chicken's dryness is wonderfully countered by the creamy white sauce. Their white sauce is so good I always ask for an extra pack just so I can bless my halal with extra goodness. Now I don't know what they put in their hot sauce, but it is a darn challenge to eat each bite fighting the kick in your mouth and throat. Yet this is what makes halal so good. Every time I eat halal my mouth, my stomach, and my toilet (the next morning lol) is utterly demolished.

A lot of my friends kept telling me that the original halal guys in NY ONE IS WAY BETTER since I never been to NY I can't really do a comparison. (Moving time forward to last week) I finally visited NY and tried the original halal guys, and let me tell y'all the original halal guys from NY IS WAYYY BETTER!!

No matter what time of the day it is, people seem to get their Halal Guys fix any time of the day and actually, in any part of New York!  I was amazed by how many Halal Guys locations there were when I was in NYC.  It seemed as though every street corner had a HG food stand, including this one where right across the street - there was another Halal Guys! I had the Chicken and Rice combination and added white sauce with it.  The food is constantly being made, so it's always ready as soon as you order.  The portion is huge, so you're guaranteed to have leftovers.  And most importantly, the chicken was tender and yummy with the famous white sauce.  There really isn't much to the bowl, as it's just chicken over orange rice with some lettuce and pita bread on the side, but it is good, and reminiscent of comfort food.  I have to say this is one of the best deals in the city for a hefty meal that's fast and affordable.",,,

We have one in LA but I was saving my first bite for the real NY one.After a day of feasting and exploring NY, we made our way to the cart at 9 pm. I got the mixed meat plate. The workers are really nice, just like everyone says.I read reviews that the hot sauce is dangerous so I was careful with it. I was quite liberal with the white sauce. We were eating in high 30 degree weather... the hot plate of meat and rice was comforting. The dish was just what i imagined. The meats were tasty, rice was well seasoned. The white sauce was refreshing.Glad I got to try the real deal. Idk if I'll eat it in LA though as it has pretty bad reviews.",1,,

When you have a lackluster experience at an expansion location in SoCal, you can't help but want to go back to the source, especially because there's just something about lining up at a cart in midtown for street eats. The sauce is still relevant, but instead of making the meal, enhances the overall flavor of the meat and whole plate, which is indeed much better than the taste at a brick and mortar franchise. Service was efficient as expected and drinks were satisfyingly ice cold. I will say I've had better, similar meals at other food trucks elsewhere in Manhattan, but I know to give The Halal Guys a lot of credit for hyping this delicious, good value cuisine.",3,2,5

The Halal Guys has added several carts to its original location to deal with the volume that they get but its totally worth the wait. They are generous with the meat portions and hand out ample amount of sauce, and a plate is still only $8 the way it should be. Their rice is well seasoned and very fragrant, the meat delicious and their white sauce seals the deal. Their hot sauce is uncomfortable hot for most, I wish it was more manageable so I can add more to my food.

It was right across the street from our hotel. Honestly, I wasnt blown away. I got the chicken plate. I just had Halal guys in Las Vegas last month and I thought it was way better in Vegas. I believe in Vegas they serve the salad with tomatoes which I liked. Here they dont do that and they dont give you much salad. The chicken to me was okay.

Don't even bother with the others including the B&M ones. I would rather just go to another no name dime a dozen halal cart than to a B&M Halal Guys.BUT like the original Shake Shack, the original Cart was some how a better cut of the same cloth. Rice, awesome, moist, al dente with some flavor. Chicken and Lamb tested great. I particularly like their gyro meat over any other Halal cart. People talk about how great Halal Guy's chicken taste, I'd say their lamb is significantly better than any Halal cart.  The lamb was flavorful, smoky and juicy.  Chicken, I found a tad on the drier side.  Excellent white and hot sauce. I love how creamy rice and meat work together. Top with onions and bell peppers (bonus points here) give everything a gooey meaty crunch. White was creamy and goes well with the hot sauce. Just be careful with the hot sauce if you don't want a firey exit.So I told the worker ""It's fine, its 25 degrees out, ill eat this piping hot covered in hot sauce to keep warm. It tasted so go going in as I was so cold. in about 5 mins, I was sweating under my beanie!",2,1,2

I am a loyal fan to halal bros in Austin and these are my opinion for halal guys in NYC. Service: fast and efficient. I did not wait at all, but you do have to pay cash. No credit cards. The guys were all super nice. Food: I got the beef gyro and it was decent. There weren't that much veggies compared to halal bros. I do like that the sauces were all in packages and not directly on the food. I felt the food was pretty oily compared to halal bros and the lettuce was not as fresh as it either. Environment: there were at least 3-4 trucks down the street. So it's pretty easy to get the food quick. Just look for the location with a line and that's where halal guys is! Overall I would pick this place if I crave this type of food. Is it better than halal bros in Austin? No. But pretty damn close.",3,1,3

It is cheaper than the stores locations where is is $7.99 before taxes for a small and $8.99 for a larger.Wait: There is always a wait no matter if it is lunch time, mid day, dinner time or even midnight. First because of tourists and second because it is cheap filling food after a long night of drinking. Be prepared to wait 5 to 10 minutes.Food: Food is always fresh and hot. If you get a platter, it comes with yellow rice, pita and salad. You can add chicken or gyro or both as meat. I am a frequent visitor when i am by the location. The food i got was really salty. I don't know why. I had trouble finishing it because of that. I will give it another try to see if they have changed their food.Sauce: If you get the platter to go, they are very stingy with the sauce. They charge you more if you want extra.Drinks: They sell drinks. A can of soda is $1.Overall: i would give this a try if you are in the neighborhood, hungry after a night of drinking. It is filling affordable food in NYC.",3,2,1

My go to is the combo chicken and lamb, plenty white sauce and some red sauce which is HOT but sooo good. It's great because you get so much flavor from the protein and the yummy rice, then you get the salad as a nice fresh contrast.

We ordered the falafel plate and chicken plate and brought it back to our hotel for a nice night in. It is SO much food for just $8 a plate. The food is cooked very well and the chicken was very tender. I really liked how they were conscious of not including the burned pieces of chicken into the plates they served. I hate when places will mix it all in together. The falafel is the best falafel I have had and is made even better by their white sauce which is super amazing. The falafel plate also comes with lettuce, bell peppers and raw onions. I didn't realize there were onions. They also give you a few pieces of pita bread. The line was pretty long when we got there but they are very efficient in getting orders ready. It is cash only as well so make sure to have cash and beware the knock offs of their cart that are in the same area. I think we saw a cart that looked the exact same with the colors that just said ""The Original Guys"". Definitely a must try place if you're visiting NYC.",1,,1

Very cheap given the amount of food you get. In the combo, the meat is so flavorful especially when you mix in the white and red sauce. WARNING: don't go crazy with the red sauce because it is butt hole burning hot! The rice is great and the salad is probably as fresh as it could be.

Their food is okay. The chicken is not as flavorful as other places. I also feel like their white sauce is watered down because no matter how much you put, something somehow seeps it and it disappears?There are better, underrated halal carts around the area that are more worth it.

If it isn't already seasoned well enough for you, they'll give you extra packets of goopy sauces. In general, there's no skimping on meat in favor of lettuce and rice like the Halal Guys outlets in the Bay Area - so yes, there's nothing quite like the original here in New York.",10,2,4

Luckily there are two carts serving deliciousness, so everyone can get some grub. The line cut down rather quickly. My sister was willing to choose Chinese over this until she had a taste, and then she looked at me wide-eyed and knew; she had a taste of the truth. The chicken was tender, garlicky and super flavorful. My sister got the combo with    Beef and Chicken, she didn't care for the rice but it was super good to me. I am a fan of Spicy but be weary of the  Hot Sauce, because it wont make you forgot. Load your plate up with all the White Sauce AKA chronic and then dots of the Hot Sauce thats the smart way.

And I had wanted to go to rafiqis but had read so many good things about this place on Yelp so I thought ok why not try it. He ordered and we walked to Rockefeller center to sit and eat.  As soon as I opened it my face fell. The meat was ground up and and unappetizing looking, and there was only old looking iceburg lettuce. It did come with bread but I found that to be redundant (the hubby liked it tho). So the taste is good, all be it very greasy and mostly good due to that white sauce/ red sauce mix. I'm definitely not happy that this was his intro to halal plates :/",,,

Also, this was just down below our hotel in midtown Manhattan. I could see their yellow and red umbrellas from my room window(room with a view;). We tried their falafel bowl twice. Once there was a short line. Luckily got hold of them as soon as they opened their cart. The red chilli sauce is really really hot. So be aware and try it on your own risk. The mayonnaise sauce gives a good taste when you mix it with falafel, orange rice, naan bread pieces and lettuce. I like that they don't mix it and it depends on the customer to add as much as you want. Next time a friend ordered to go and we ate the bowl as one of the lunch options. I found their falafel better than the other cart's falafel which I tried in lower Manhattan. The price point is good and the quantity in on a larger side so definitely more of a dinner portions but the taste of the food is okay nothing really great. The Naan bread is more of a store bought taste. I am saying this for their falafel bowl! Overall I am glad that I tried them and got The Halal Guys checked out of my yelp list:)!",1,1,1

195,Alyanna C.,"San Jose, CA",360,422,3951,5.0,6/3/2017,"Back in 2010 when I visited NYC, my cousin (a NYC local born and raised) wouldn't shut up about some chicken and rice cart in the city. I mostly ignored his recommendation since it sounded too simple. Over the years I made fun of him for always talking about it too. I didn't realize it was Halal Guys at the time, and given the popularity surrounding them lately I decided to take up his offer to try their chicken and rice in my latest visitYes, it's indeed chicken and rice for $7 - a bargain in this city given the amount of food one bowl provides. I shared with the BF and it was enough to satisfy us. The chicken is shredded, seasoned, and slow cooked to give it an incredible amount of flavor. I'm not a fan of chicken, but I was so surprised how moist and tasty it was! There's some lettuce and tomato that gives it some freshness, and the rice is incredibly flavorful.  They also give a few slices of pita bread for extra carbs to eat with your chicken (the rice is so tasty I kinda don't mind just eating that). It's a picture worthy dish despite how simple it looks - the colors make it very appealing.While the plate itself is delicious... what really elevates this place are the sauces! Make sure you add sauce to your meals - they're really good! They offer 2 sauces - a creamy garlicky white sauce and a spicy red sauce. Definitely recommend taste testing the red sauce - IT'S ACTUALLY SPICY LOL. It's burn-your-mouth spicy, but also delicious! We mixed the red sauce and white sauce, and it was a winning combination! Combined, the red sauce gives it a nice kick and the white sauce soothens the initial bite of the red sauce.As my cousin would say, the location on the corner of 53rd and 6th Ave is the original location - if you're visiting and trying Halal Guys, come here. There are some benches around the area to sit down (I'd recommend going one street over on 5th Ave as there are more benches). Just make sure you're ordering from the Halal Guys, as a lot of carts have similar colors.I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that this was probably my favorite meal in NYC, and to my cousin... sorry for laughing at you all these years. You were right, and I was wrong to doubt your tastes in chicken and rice. Haha!",18,11,12
