All of the comedians we saw were great and kept us laughing, but the venue was just average. The venue was small and I thought everything was overpriced from admission to food and drinks (not to mention the minimum on drinks, which was basically at least two drinks). Also, my friends and I were squeezed into the back, which was a little uncomfortable. They only accept cash.",1,,1
1,Lynn J.,"Boston, MA",1652,602,432,3.0,11/19/2018,"This place is five star for the entertainment... The comedians are top-notch, especially the headliner. I took away STARZ only for the small space and lack of access to the bathrooms. We sat on the far end of the tiny room. Once the opener came on, we were stuck in a corner against the wall, through all six comedians, with no way to get to the bathroom for hours! (with out making entire tables of people get up to let us by... Which we refuse to do.)THE DEAL: sit towards the middle of the room,Or on the side with the bathrooms... The comedians are totally worth the Price of admission!",,,
2,Kate F.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",102,407,2071,2.0,12/2/2017,"Small space, needs some sprucing up, and the quality of the acts varied from really bad to pretty good.For the $20 admission price plus $18 min on drinks, I'm not sure it's worth it vs other comedy options in the city.We still had fun though.... you can make the most of it as long as you know to expect $40 per person cost and a range in comedian quality.",1,,
3,Miyuki Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0,4.0,9/7/2018,"Well, I haven't actually been inside yet.So this is just my opinion & the 1st impression about the club.When my husband & I passed by there, the lady was keen to fill in the blackboard in the late afternoon yesterday.As soon as we stopped, she realized and talked to us.So my husband asked some questions about the performer, she was really kind & friendly enough to answer.She kept smiling, was eager but not pushy to explain.We do love her, just because of her nice attitude toward us we are very much interested in the club.I've been a bit worried after knowing the low ratings here but anyway we should try to visit there.Thanks to Lolo. (if it's not correct, sorry. but you ! the female manager!)We'd love to see you again.You must be the nicest lady in NYC!!!",1,1,1
4,Juliana J.,"New York, NY",239,57,41,3.0,7/15/2018,"I bought tickets on an off day near the corner for $10. Fun place to go. $18 drink minimum.  Drinks were not made well but were strong. I would not get the cocktails but rather just get straight liquor, beer, or wine. Acts change everynight so no use in commenting on the talent. I liked who I saw. Seating is cramped if you are near the stage so come early and try to sit in the back, it's the best view.",,,
5,Erin E.,"Boston, MA",318,259,9,4.0,11/27/2017,"Oh boy, our night here was a mixed bag.  Pricing:  There are always deals for half-price entry, free shots, etc. so be sure to Google around before booking anything.  Drink prices are relatively exorbitant, but about normal for a comedy club.  Overall you're looking at around ~$35/person, which seems reasonable to me for a few hours of entertainment.  Venue: Moderately dingy and crowded, clearly been in business for many years.  Again, seems about normal for NY comedy. Talent:  The warm up/MC-type lady was great!  Just the right amount of ribbing the audience and getting people laughing.  We saw 4 comedians, 3 of whom were quite good.  Andrew Shulz, however, legitimately had the worst set I've ever seen.  I like political and even offensive humor; part of the point of comedy is to make you think about things in new ways.  Shulz, in attempting to ""play devil's advocate,"" just tumbled right over into straight disgusting misogyny and racism. The room was completely silent as the audience exchanged shocked looks with one another.  You know when you're on a plane that and it gets super turbulent and you're all looking at one another for reassurance? It felt like that... i.e., not really the vibe you're shooting for when you go to a comedy club. The silence was broken as Shulz started arguing with an audience member about who had read more of the Koran.  Yikes.   So, to summarize: A pretty fun night, but don't go if Shulz is there, unless you're into misogynistic racist jerks lecturing you and yelling at the audience for not laughing.",2,,2
6,Robert S.,"Manhattan, NY",59,4,0,1.0,9/25/2018,"I visit many comedy clubs in NY every year.  I go for the comedy not the food or drinks.  That said my question...What harm would it do to the bottom line if they gave you a drink with a decent bit of the alcohol that should be in the cocktail. Really, could it cost another 75 cents.  Why does stand-up NY force you to order bottled beer because you at least know what's in the drink?  Your tables might not be half empty if you did something about water down drinks.  Why in 2018 would you do this?",,,
7,Claire L.,"Baltimore, MD",0,8,1,4.0,10/20/2018,"Enjoyed 10pm show with 5 comics. Each projecting a different persona and take on the world.: A writer on an HBO show, at least one with a Comedy Central special, another has appeared Jimmy Fallon. A couple were trying out new bits in development. Loved them all and laughed a lot, but my fave was Chloe Hilliard from the podcast Social Misfit. As a stand up club fan since 1980 and a woman, I always especially enjoy comics who bring the lived-experiences of women to their creative work. Small, no frills club thats been around for years def gives the venue an authentic vibe - you'll prob see someone here you already familiar with or will see hit the big-time down the road.",1,,1
8,Kimberly E.,"Hazlet, NJ",41,10,3,1.0,3/30/2018,"Literally just left this place feeling like we just got scammed. We came to see andrew shultz and without any warning or notice the show was filled with some comedian making fun of bad yelp reviews - so this is for you, sir. Andrew never showed up, my poor excuse for a drink was 18 dollars, 10 people showed up and our bill was ridiculous even for new york standards. I dont want to say dont go here because thats unfair to the comics that work this place - but I have to say I am just so very disappointed in all the money we spent to come here and just feel like it was a scam. The host was amazing and so were most of the comics that actually cared... but it just left s terrible impression on us and we will never ever be back.",2,1,1
9,Roger K.,"New York, NY",6,14,0,5.0,7/31/2018,"This is a faithful iteration of the classic NYC standup comedy club. It's all about the comedy, and these guys deliver. I was wondering about all the low ratings until I realized that most reviewers don't understand what a comedy club is about.All good comedy clubs I've been to, both NY and LA, have covers and  drink minimums, and the drinks aren't all that good. Same is true here, but the cocktail was nice and strong, which is the point. Alcohol is a key component of the comedy club environment. And the total cost of the evening is about right for live entertainment in Manhattan. If you're easily offended, don't go. Stay home and watch Comedy Central instead. Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Sam Kinison... Stand up comedy is offensive. That's what makes it funny. I think there were three Holocaust references during our evening. Made by Jewish comedians. Get over it or stay home.Comedy clubs are crowded. The intimacy contributes to the environment.. It's a club, not a theater.",,,
10,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,1.0,10/8/2016,"This place is a ripoff that relies on traffic from Groupon and other event sites. I found out about the event from Fever, where we paid $15 on Fever for two people, and Fever also said there would be a complimentary drink per person.We then show up, are informed that there is an $18 drink per person minimum (the app only mentioned 2 drinks, not $18 worth of overpriced drinks), the credit card reader doesn't work but of course they conveniently have an ATM with fees on the premises, and the free Fever drink only applies to one person, not two. The lack of transparency is unacceptable as Stand Up NY presumably has full control over what is listed on the Fever listing.The other annoying thing is that when we tried to redeem our free drink, we were given two instead of one, and ended up having to pay for an extra drink we did not want. My boyfriend didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but I'm reading from other reviews that this is standard practice at Stand Up NY where they overcharge patrons and rely on their reluctance for confrontation.The comics were okay, a little mainstream and the host was a loud raspy yeller that I didn't care for, but the service was horrible and I will never come back to this venue again.",7,,
11,Casey W.,"Anaheim, CA",293,200,180,1.0,11/6/2017,"Gave in to a very persuasive ticket seller on the street. He promised us shots on the house, gave us extra tickets, etc. We did end up going since you have to pay for the tickets up front. We didn't get any of the shots we were offered. Their menu prices are kind of sneaky in my opinion since you'll end up going over their minimum easily unless you only order beer.The woman that was in between acts had a very harsh sense of humor. She called my friend and I lesbians. Nothing against lesbians, but she saw my annoyance when she called us out. She continued to refer to that probably another 3 or 4 times. She saw I would roll my eyes each time, and even commented on it. She's that bully in the school yard that only gets encouraged the more you give her any attention. She just wasn't funny to me.I think there was only one comedian that really had me bust up for a second. It wasn't worth it going here. Save your money unless you get a good Groupon deal or something.",2,1,2
12,Rachel M.,"Dallas, TX",188,3,0,2.0,6/3/2018,The comedy show was alright but there was an $18 drink minimum PER PERSON.  So the price of the show is actually double what you pay including the overpriced drinks.  We just wanted to see comedy and not drink and this is not the place for that.,1,,
13,Ash M.,"Dallas, TX",0,44,13,5.0,6/1/2018,"I had such a good experience when I came here. The comics are all really funny and the staff is nice and prompt with drink orders.

14,Shawn N J.,"Kingston, NY",128,95,186,2.0,1/7/2017,Been going to stand up for many years with my wife. Mainly all over the lower end of the city such as the cellar and I see why. Went to show here Thursday  night and it was so bad one comedian Sergio was the highlight of the show other 4 were absolutely terrible. The place just didn't have a stand up comedy vibe seemed very dead and very out of touch. And this is coming from someone who visits the comedy cellar almost weekly forMany years.,4,2,1

The only negative would be the drink prices. $15/each is a bit steep for the venue in my opinion. $10-12 would be a more attractive range. Other than that a GREAT experience!",1,,
17,Sari A.,"Philadelphia, PA",1273,926,11330,2.0,11/2/2015,"Here's why I won't be going to Stand Up NY again:1) 2 Drinks minimum. 2 Drinks not 2 items, If you ordered food, it won't count and that Sucks! Maybe because they know their show is not that good, and few drinks is a must for a good time. I totally understand that it is the norm for most comedy clubs, but what I don't get why it has to be a beverage, and not food?!2) $15-20 cover charge. and 2 drinks minimum, per guest.3) Expensive experience and cheap show. 4) Ordered food, don't expect to get a knife. Don't ask! Reminder: it is not included in the minimum, probably because they know people won't enjoy the food as well.5) Tables and illuminated menus were dirty, sticky, and very filthy.6) Coffee? what is coffee? There is no coffee at standup NY.7) Half empty on Friday night, REALLY?!! ( One table was the introducer's family ) 8) Not FUNNY.9) Not FUNNY.10) Not FUNNY.etcOne and Half Yelps.",17,13,6
18,PoLin S.,"Washington, DC",21,38,9,5.0,6/7/2017,"I've been to a few comedy clubs in New York, and Stand Up NY is a special one. As a frequent comedy show-goer, I particularly enjoy going to Stand Up NY because of its intimate vibe and good customer service. Drink prices and the standard minimum are comparable to those of other clubs, so no surprises there! I've had some good laughs and seen an array of funny comics on stage. Every year, Stand Up NY hosts a charity event for the nonprofit I work for. From a partnership standpoint, their generosity, flexibility, and attention to detail (they always provide promotional material like reserved signs, drink menus, and slides without us having to ask) are truly what makes them unique.",3,1,2
19,Cassi A.,"Tempe, AZ",2,30,58,4.0,6/21/2017,"This was nice time. Started exactly on time. The comics were hilarious. My bf had a great time for his birthday. There was a good mixture of comics, which interacted well with the audience which was cool. There is a 2 drink minimum per person ($18 each) which was stated when getting the tickets. There is obviously tax and tip that's extra. So the bill came to around $42 or something, not including the tickets, which were $17 on Groupon. They didn't take cards so make sure you have cash handy.",2,,2
20,Brian H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,50,10,3.0,5/4/2018,"I would not come back here. It was an okay experience- as some of the comedians were really fun, but some just weren't, there is a two drink minimum, and the prices of foods were jacked up. The two drinks must come to at least $18 per person. The comedians were very interactive with the crowd, and prompted many of us to talk with them. It was a nice thing to try overall, but I would definitely not come back, specifically because of the high prices.",,,
21,Brian G.,"Lake View East, Chicago, IL",34,19,1,3.0,9/27/2017,"Came here on a Groupon not expecting much. I love stand-up, so can't really go wrong. Drinks were decent but tiny and super expensive (typical). Comics were funny! My one huge complaint, damn, the woman who introduces the comics at the beginning of the show. She doesn't have any jokes of her own anymore, she just goes through the crowd from left to right heckling the hell out of EVERYONE table by table for cheap jokes. Boring. She said my boyfriend and looked like ""a college date rape waiting to happen"". We're two gay guys?!? Lil off the mark! Still got a laugh out of us. Don't really enjoy being heckled though, I came here to watch, not be watched. Some people are into that thing though. Decent place for a night out, better clubs in the city.",,,
22,Louise R.,"New York, NY",245,288,1386,5.0,4/10/2017,"This venue has a special place in my heart.  Everytime I've come here, someone famous has showed and the 'Not yet famous ' performers are 9/10 spot on with their level of expertise. I've been coming here at least twice a year for ten years. I get emails for free admission lately and I'm assuming that's that drive in audience traffic. I even saw an event page advertising free admission and it used to be 20$ a head just to enter plus the two drink minimum. Now I get emails every other weekend for th, fri, sat , Sunday night performances with free adnission. I replied to the email and even when I got to the check in person he didn't even ask for a name , he just let me in. You must order at least 36$ between two people.  Red wine was never so expensive before,  now it's 50$ a bottle to split. The white is 38$ so if you're trying to be reasonable, you can. Otherwise cocktails run about 15$. We sat in the front row, prime targets for the comedians. Only one time did the comedian rag on us and that was for my blue hair lol the bathrooms are kept clean for the most part, way down in the basement. The comics drink in the bar area between sets so you can get a picture if you want. I think I heckled the comedian from Alabama by saying that Kevin Hart is one note and that Larry the cable guy has been very successful. He got super pissed because he says that guy is from North Dakota and doesn't know squat about southerners.  Oops. But this is why I love this place and I keep coming back for the experience of witnessing talent on the rise. That guy will get famous! Times I've been here random talent has shown up,  this night the guy from 30 rock, frickin hilarious. Before Amy Shumer, Chris rock, etc. All surprised us because they weren't listed on the docket. They just had something to get off their chest and we were lucky enough to be there.",3,,1
23,Francesca G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,88,0,1.0,9/13/2017,"My friends were in town and got tickets for all of us at groupon.  Imagine a parade of some of the vilest racist, misogynist, Islamophobic, homophobic crap possible lasting for several comics in a row.  Then imagine some little pissant getting angry his jokes aren't landing and he starts heckling individuals in the audience (but in an extremely hostile way).  Listen, Richie Redding, it's not our fault you can't write decent jokes and rely on ones that are both racist AND misogynist.  Stop hurling abuse at people for *not laughing* at them.One guy named Graham Kay was great, plus a shave-headed guy who isn't on the website so I can't remember his name, and a great famous comic showed up (but I won't name him because he deserves better than to be associated with this place).To the people on stage this past Monday (with the exception of the three above): Stop trying to one-up each other on how how shockingly offensive you can be.  None of you are George Carlin.While the comics were shouting at the audience to ""lighten the f**k up,"" maybe the hosts should do the same.  My friend got scolded for daring to glance at her phone to see when another of our friends was going to get there because it was ""disrespectful to the comics.""  The irony seems to have been lost on him.",2,4,2
24,Rick N.,"Chicago, IL",12,21,8,1.0,9/14/2017,Went on Wednesday. Comedians were not funny. No one was there to watch. Was awkward in how bad it was. Comedy cellar is better but that's all the way in downtown.,2,2,1
25,Mady A.,"Manhattan, NY",223,186,776,3.0,7/8/2016,Typical NYC comedy place. Bar in the front as soon as you walk in and a comedy room in the back. I've seen quite a few of my comedian friends here. There is the usual two drink minimum and quite a good menu of food bites if you're hungry. The day I went I was quite surprised when another guest jumped out of their seat in the middle of a comedy show because a roach flew from the air and onto his meal....YIKES!!! Definitely not what you want to see while you're enjoying your own meal. Most of the guests were pretty on edge after this incident which happened a SECOND TIME...Not acceptable. I have been here quite a few times and never saw any problems like this. Hoping this gets taken care of so that I can enjoy more comedy shows!,2,1,1

(If you don't order any drinks you still gotta pay ~24$ for nothing).Also don't dare to use the ATMs (Take cash before coming because they apparently only accept cash), it took for it 15-20 times until it worked and damaged my chip, no place accepts my card anymore.",,,
27,Abby B.,"Centennial, CO",260,12,5,1.0,1/8/2017,"Would not recommend this place. The comedians they had weren't very funny, which I feel bad about because it was kind of painful that they all didn't have a very good night. We got a deal on our tickets, however, they get you with the drinks. Granted, the drinks were exorbitantly priced for NY, but the two drink minimum was kind of BS because they weren't very good, I didn't want to drink anyway, and they slapped on some fees to make our bill pretty ridiculous.",6,2,1
28,Justine V.,"Poitiers, France",16,2,0,1.0,4/22/2018,"The Stand Up show here was awful and revolting. The second comedian was racist and extremely sexist. I have never felt this disrespected and shocked in public. He joked multiple times about rape, women and even his own woman and daughter. It was so painful to hear we couldn't stand the show anymore and left after 20minutes. I hope the manager will realize that this comedian should have never been on stage pronouncing these insults. We were disgusted. I am sure that America has got a lot of good places to have a funny time, and a great sense of humor. Just go somewhere else !",,1,

I'm not complaining about admission charges, I'm not complaining about drink prices or food prices (even though the food is hauled in from a local restaurant). I get it, it's a business and a business in my opinion has a right to make money. My complaint is how stuffy the place is which is a reflection on management and ownership. I've never been greeted with a smile, only a cold stare. The pictures on the wall are not conducive to a comedy club either, but rather they are conducive to the egos of the powers that be which makes it even more stuffy.  You have a comedy club on the upper west side, run it like it's on the upper west side. Than again, there is a new Comedy club a few blocks away in the same neighborhood, I'll have to do a comparison and see how they operate.",3,2,2
31,Barrett K.,"New Orleans, LA",1,8,0,1.0,4/27/2017,"This is a review about the management, not about the comedians. All the comedians that we did see were great. I had the unfortunate experience of coming here a few years ago. I was with a group of people from out of the country who absolutely loved Amy Schumer. Sure enough, one of the affiliates of the club was advertising and selling tickets in Time Square. These tickets are general admission tickets and do not actually have the name of the comedian on them. It's the promoter's job to take your name and party size and relay this information to the management, so you can see the comedian or act playing that night-- pretty standard. Anyways, this kid did exactly that: he sent a text to the management. A text which I saw later, as I was talking to another comedian who was affiliated with the club. (He was much more sympathetic to our situation.) Anyways, the management really dropped the ball and didn't put my party in the system. We found this out upon arrival. They offered us the consolation of seeing the act after Amy Schumer (the entire reason we bought the tickets.) They didn't even say they were sorry. The act following Schumer was all local comedian who were still entertaining, but it wasn't what we paid for. Now, I'm not one to give out a 1 star review on an internet review site. Most online reviews, especially negative reviews, are anecdotal. The reason that I have no sympathy for these people is because they will treat you like utter garbage if they think you're from out of town or a tourist. I was actually living on 117th at the time, but everyone in my group was Australian and clearly on vacation. The management made it absolutely clear that they had no interest in offering us a refund or a discount or any amount of goodwill, or even an apology, until I casually dropped that I was just a short train ride away. Their tone completely changed after that, but by then I was over it. Places like this know that sh*t like this stinks, and they don't want locals to talk poorly about a business which is very heavily affected by word of mouth.",8,2,2

You never know who is going to show up, which is what I like about this club and keeps me coming back. About the complaints from people. NYC comedy clubs pretty much all enforce a 2 drink minimum or spending requirement. This club isn't doing anything different than any other major club in NYC. It is the standard here.

It simply wasn't funny, relevant and actually just stupid and distasteful. Imagine your most vivid idea of ""that guy"" at a party... That was her.. X 15. The rest were highly amusing.

I don't know if it's the vibe of the room, the mix of the comics or an audience that always seems primed for comedy - it's always a great time. I have to give a lot of the credit to the hosts, who are always as funny as the comics they're introducing, and especially good at zeroing in on the one person or couple to ignite a running gag between acts.I have never seen a minimum food order, and the 2 drink minimum seems standard. The drinks are fine, but unless you're there to sit at the front bar it doesn't matter much. This is the classic, old school comedy club that gets it right. I even noticed the staff quietly intervene when one young lady got particularly chatty with the on stage talent.",1,,2

We sat on the balcony seats and had an amazing time. I had a Groupon with two shots included. It was easy to reserve online and the line moved fairly quickly when we arrived. The shots are basically water with sugar. Drinks are a bit pricey but not bad. Only thing i didn't like was that they included gratuity and we where only two people. I guess it was convenient to assume we where a party of 6 with the people besides us. i didn't complain because over all it was a very fun experience. My cheeks still hurt from all the laughing. Will definitely be returning but i don't think I'll ever sit in the front row.,,,
41,Jon F.,"New York, NY",1,7,0,4.0,11/22/2017,Incredible show.  Did not expect to laugh for over an hour straight but all the comedians were great.  Would be five star but two drink minimum and drinks were not great.  Highly recommend the experience though.,,,

43,Latia C.,"Hackensack, NJ",65,36,30,3.0,4/21/2016,"I saw a Groupon for Stand Up that I thought was a really good deal. Tickets for two and two shots for $17, which is Great since on their website I saw entry was $20 per person. I decided to go to their Saturday 8pm line up show. It was easy to find, but being in the city of course finding parking took some time. (It's still a little cold at night in April and did not feel like dealing with the trains). Arrived around 7 30pm and showed the man my Groupon , redeemed it, and he sat us right away. The comedy club is small (like most NYC spots) and most table were taken already so we sat at a table along the wall but still had a good view of the stage. Things from here became mediocre. Our waitress came as soon as we were seated and that was the only quick service we received for the rest of the night. We ordered two drinks, mozzarella sticks, and the two shots that were included with the Groupon. Our drinks came right before the show started. Very, very watered-down. The mozzarella sticks took over an hour to come. For what reason, I have no idea because they only give you five. The waitress was very apologetic and gave us two more drinks on the house. Drinks were still watered-down, but I appreciated the gesture. The comedians overall were okay. There was a total of five and not one really stood out to me. Don't even remember their names. (One of the comedians played the best friend in Deadpool)I laughed a few times but I would say  dont expect to have tears rolling down your face. The host was really good, he kept the show moving along. For the price was not bad, I did enjoy it for what it was.",1,,1
44,Nikki B.,"Manhattan, NY",15,69,1,3.0,8/17/2016,"I went here through a Groupon last weekend which overall was a fun night with friends. You have to make a reservation online which was fine but be sure to check off a reply so you get a confirmation email. You cannot call the venue. The comedians overall were good. Out of 5, 2 were great (one had us crying we were laughing so hard), 2 were okay and 1 was really bad. Drinks were really sweet and there is a $18 drink minimum even though we had tickets. Difficult for some of my friends who don't drink but if you get a couple beers, it was fine. I'd go again if there was a good deal but a lot of stipulations that would keep me from being a regular.",,,

Most of the comedians were not as wonderful as I expected - although you may find one or two gems - and very similar jokes were thrown around a few times by different comedians. I have been there two times and the first experience was a bit better than the second. The host makes the same jokes about every show and unlike good wines (or cheese), they don't get better over time. IF you look like you're from Jersey or Long Island or extremely ridiculous you may get some fun out of being picked on by the comedians? Anyway, if you are looking for some hilarity, and enjoy improv I highly recommend UCB Chelsea and Magnet Theater. Can't think of any amazing stand up clubs I've been to.",2,,

Great thing is, this is NYC and everyone who's anyone is here and grinding like crazy.Expect to pay at least a $20 cover with a two drink minimum/ $20 drink minimum. Not that I have an issue spending at least $40 for an outing, I just don't like to be backed into a corner to do it. It's too pushy, but I understand. Trust me, you won't feel gipped, the service is great and I always laugh up a six pack each time I visit.It's a very intimate space but there are plenty of tables sprawled about. You should have no issue coming here with a large group, I'd suggest checking the website before tho because if it's a pretty decent act, don't expect to stroll up 10 minutes before the show starts and get a seat.I've yet to try the food here but I will be back in NYC in Sept. so it's obvious I'll be making my way here.

You don't feel cramped * Solid drinks and delicious (although pricey) food from Serafina   * Really funny comics- my jaws always hurt from laughing so much! I recommend coming Friday/Saturday nights for bigger crowds and talent. I think the 11pm shows are more crowded and raunchy versus the 9pm shows. In total I spent only $26.96 for 2 hours of awesome comedy versus paying almost double if I didn't come with a voucher.

The bar has really nice vibes and it was great to chat over some drinks before the show. Overall the venue was classy and clean, and we found the prices to be reasonable considering the amount and quality of comedy and service that we were getting.

70,David W.,"Seabrook, TX",219,226,299,3.0,10/29/2013,"This one is tricky to review, you'll see as I walk through it.Like most reviewers, we bought these tickets from a sales rep (Max) on the street near Rockefeller Center.  We had talked about seeing some comedy on our trip but hadn't quite fit it in the itinerary and at least this provided an opportunity.  He said he had tickets for $20 ($21 after I charged it, just in case it was a scam I could contest).  The same deal is available on Yelp it appears.  The tickets are good for any show, any night, never expire, just call and reserve when you want to come.  We were told of the two drink minimum (or $20), given an overview of the comics performing (or likely to perform) and in general given good instructions.  He called and made the reservation, probably didn't emphasize the need to be early enough, but other reviewers here did, so we arrived 30 minutes before the show.  Which I recommend to make sure you don't get shut out, the place did fill up.If you want to be in the first row, be sure to lurk near the room door when waiting to go in.  We went around to the far side of the bar and when the doors opened, we waited behind a lot of people but had (what I think was) better seating around the perimeter.The show was really really funny.  I would NOT recommend bringing any kids under the age of 18.  Not for the language, but the sexual references.  In fact, one lady left with her 16 year old son in the first few minutes (literally walked up and left, the MC even kind of joked with her, I mean what else can you do).  This is NY and comedy, it will be bawdy.  And funny, each comedian had their own style and was clearly experienced, professional, and worthy of late night TV, etc.  In all, I think we saw 6 comedians, plus the MC who told jokes to warm up the crowd and intermittent.  One of the comedians was a familiar face from Sitcom TV.So up to this, probably 4.5 stars.The downsides were, like others, we were told of a free shot (by Max).  He asked the host to put it on our reservation.  When we got there, no mention.  I mentioned to the waiter, he acknowledged, never brought the shot.  Since I don't REALLY like shots, I didn't press any more.The two drink minimum, while I understand is common in the comedy industry, is just a price augmenter.  Beer for $9.50, mixed drinks for $14 (my wife said her Cosmo tasted like cough syrup).  It is what it is, but with that $20 drinks per person, plus the 18% automatic gratuity (clearly printed on the menu, fine, I usually tip bar wait staff more) will make your evening more like $50 a person (after the tickets) if you stick to the two drinks.  All that is fine, it just seemed to start with a guy on the street who said ""Comedy for $20 each"" and ended up being $100 for both of us.So for sales tactics, which leaves some customers unhappy (as you can see from other reviews), probably 2 stars.  Without these tactics, they might be playing to empty rooms, I will say a full, lively crowd made the show a lot more fun to watch.  All the comedians interacted with the crowd as part of the act which makes the experience that much better.A night well spent, definitely one of the positive memories of the trip.  If we came back to NY, I'd probably see if I could work another stop here into the trip.  If you want some dinner before or after, Amsterdam Ave in this area has a ton of good restaurants.",6,1,1

He lied to us about the comedians.  Be on the watch out for a promoter/seller named Danny. Once we arrived at the venue, the evening of the show, we really enjoyed the comedians. The problem that we faced was that Stand Up NY did not tell us about the hidden 18% added service fee.. This really added on to the $18 minimum drink limit.  The comedians did a great job, but the business was strongly lacking ethics. I would truly NOT recommend this club to ANYONE!

But isn't that their job to do so anyway?  There was an emcee and 6 comedians. The Emcee was fair at best, but he was better than most of the featured comedians.  2 of the comedians were ok to decent and another was fair.  It was downright painful watching the other 3 and I was wishing for the whole show to just hurry up and end. One comedian in particular kept giving the audience a hard time for its low energy/lack of enthusiasm.  Hard to be enthusiastic about his lousy set.  Wanted to just walk out but not wanting to be rude, we forced ourselves to stay.     Then at the end was a bit shocked to see a $48 dollar bill for my one, watered-down mixed drink plus a water, and my son's one cranberry juice.  I thought $18+$18=$36 but I figured ok, they added a big tax or whatever.  Didn't care to scrutinize the bill at the time because we were so ready to leave. I added an $8 tip figuring it wasn't the waitress' fault for the horrible show.  The next day my sister-in-law (whose bill with her coworker was also $48) said she noticed that the $12 discrepancy was a ""service charge"".   But that's 33%.  Was it a mandatory gratuity?  It appeared that an additional tip was expected since the credit card bill showed a subtotal with that separate line where you write in your Tip amount.  Our bad for not questioning the bill but bottom line it was a complete ripoff even with the ""free"" cover charge.  Big waste of time & money.  Won't make that mistake again.",3,,

The drinks tasted like fruit juice without a single drop of liquor in them (which at $15 each and in tiny glasses the least they could do was add some). The first 4 comedians were funny, but the hostess was awkward and kept harping on how in love she was with the sailors (fleet week), and the last comedian made me and my fiancée wish we had left before he had a chance to speak.

She couldn't handle the obnoxious loudmouths in the corner and let them overwhelm her. Very unprofessional. The host tried to bring the energy back into the room, but it was pretty much gone. Adding insult to the injury of having to endure Gold's disaster, scraping together adequate cash (who carries cash?) to cover the exorbitant tab pretty much killed the buzz from the final act, who tried hard to redeem the night.

I asked him to tell me straight up the best club to go to because I had been recommended to Caroline's. He said Caroline's was good, but pricey (which I knew because I'd looked up previously and saw they had Tracy Morgan for $60+/ticket) and I talked him into pulling out tickets from 5 other clubs he also promoted and finally told me NY Stand Up really was the best of them. The Indian looking MC was super funny. And all the comedians were at least somewhat funny. 3 of the 5 acts were hilarious. We got lucky and Jay Farrow was in the house and did a set which was a nice treat. Later saw on yelp I could have paid $20 for 2 tickets instead of $40+$5 tip I gave the guy on the street. 2 drink minimum or $20 per person. So automatically another $50 you'll spend including tax and 18% added gratuity. Neither my girlfriend or myself drink so that was kinda wasted money for us but would have been no big deal otherwise. All in all, i definitely say GO. I'll definitely look them up again next time I'm in NYC.",,,1

After reading everyone's reviews it seems as if we were all pitched the same 2 for $20/40 deal. It sounded okay with the idea that you got a complimentary drink. Plus, Yelp gave me a check-in treat for a free shot. Awesome!2.) What your eyes may see:It's kind of a tight place, not much space. Good to know there's an ATM downstairs near the bathrooms. The entrance and exit ways are separate, can't come in the same way you go out, especially if there is another show coming up.3.) The comics:A mixed bag. You had some comedians that kept you laughing throughout their set, others were sporadically funny, ad others were just awkwardly and confusingly NOT funny.4.) The drinks:The free shot tasted like they mixed juice with vodka. A glass of house wine was $12. I tried the Apple Martini, they made it pretty well5.) Staff:The servers were okay. Our server took down orders without a note pad. He was polite.6.) Impressions:If the comics are consistently a mixed bag then paying only $20 was worth it.",2,1,1

He said that we would help to pick a comedian for a Comedy Central contest. Said these great comedians, including someone from The Office, would be there. Tickets were $20, not too bad!  There was also a 2 drink minimum per person, expected for a comedy club. We were skeptical, checked the tickets and put the number for stand up New York into our phone and it seemed like a legit venue...Night of the show we arrive and are told that there is a $20 drink minimum... What happened to the 2 drink minimum? We didn't even want to drink bc we had a rough night the night before, and were not happy. One look at the drink menu and we were more irritated. A domestic beer was $9.50, ridiculous. In the end. 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine, cost us $53. There was a mandatory 18% gratuity that was added to our bill. Awesome. The comedians that were promised were not there, I've seen better comedians in basement comedy clubs. Last call was 45 minutes into show, which was awkward  because then everyone was paying and talking as the comedians were onstage. This 1.5 hour show ended up costing us $93...

Once we got there, we waited in the bar area for the first show to finish. It can get pretty crowded and stuffy while you wait too!Finally the doors opened, the audience of the first show filed out, and we filed in. This is the part that I think is shady. Please read the line ""Line Up Subject To Change"", and take it for a fact. We were told that certain people were going to be there, but it turns out they weren't. A couple of the comedians who performed were hilarious (Godfrey performed and he had me rolling), and there also were a couple who weren't funny at all. I found myself force laughing out loud just to try and break the dead silence at times. There is a two drink minimum, like it is in most comedy clubs, so be aware! A visit for 2 will cost you about $80 or $90 at least.I was going to give this place a 2 because of the misleading lineup, but it turns out that I had a good time.

We inquired because we didn't want any alcohol and they mentioned water or soda was fine too so we stuck with bottled water.  About ¾ of the way through the show, the host mentioned they only accept cash and an ATM was available downstairs.  Nice, ATM fees but no big deal.  Before the last act approached the stage, we received our bill.  The total was $46 for four bottles of water.  Although the water was priced at $3, they charged us $9 per bottle and an 18% gratuity fee.  ARE YOU F'N SERIOUS SON!!!!! My friend informed the waiter of the ""mistake"" with our bill.  He directed us to speak with the host who told us he failed to check us in and inform us about the club policy. LIES!!!!! However, he didn't agree to make any changes.  What a trap to get an audience.  Clever but I gave the guy $20 for the waters and departed.  On a good note, the comedians gave us a good laugh even though they were not the lineup we were told by the street hustler.  I mean, you shouldn't have to lure people into your establishment.  I guess the NYC hustle is real whether honest or not.  Somebody has to pay the rent.  A yelper like myself should know better but I had the joy of writing this wonderful review.  I would give this place zero stars if it were possible.   What a SCAM!!!! If you see the guys in Time Square with a Stand Up comedy sign, run at a sprinting pace.  Red Flags:1. Street advertisers ability to reduce ticket cost2.

On the bright side, most performers only get 5-7 minutes of stage time, which means you get to see about 10 people over your stay.We came to a 5 pm showing and there must have been a special since we got a bucket of bud light for only $36. your night ends up ending early (7pm), and you've already dropped $40. But it's definitely a fun thing to do every now and then. Also, food does not count towards the drink minimum...Some others have said it, but I'll reiterate, the jokes can be dirty. And it's not just the performers, but the MC himself starts off with jokes about genitalia, shaving, awkward sexual moments.

Judging from the other reviews, they get a lot of customers from Times Square, and meetups are now happening. But there's like one waitress taking orders and another waiter who helps deliver drinks, sometimes one or two at a time. The waitress, despite using a tablet, can't enter too many individual orders, apparently, so you may have to share your drink order with a stranger. Time to upgrade the app, folks, or go back to more traditional methods. Anyway, there's also an $18 drink minimum. If you go non-alcoholic like I did, at $6 (or $3 for something like a bottle water), you need at least 3 drinks to meet the min. But I realized that wasn't going to happen due to the insufficient size of the staff, so for my second order I asked for two drinks at once. Turned to be a very wise choice.Oh, the comedy was alright. Didn't make me laugh much. Other reviewers have complained about the audience getting picked on.

Street vendors are kind of scum, mine told me tickets were normally 40, buuuut they are trying to sell you something. 2. 18$ minimum is a standard for many entertainment clubs, servers gotta make money too and it's worth it to see the talent here.I went on a Monday and was not expecting anything too funny. Surprise, there were 6 or 7 comics, all of them were funny except for one and the one that wasn't funny was only up for maybe 5 minutes. I was laughing pretty much the whole time, so much so that my stomach actually started to get sore. Around the end of the show, the Irish girl who had been chugging wine all night (Weird because you would think Guinness right?) ended up throwing up a bit on the front stage. I foresaw this way before it happened because I had a run-in with the chick by the bathrooms downstairs. She didn't know how to turn on the light, so I helped her with that. Then she slipped and hit her head on the sink, but got up and seemed alright. Anyway, moral of the story drunkie was taken out with a possible minor concussion, puke was thrown up immediately, and the headliner took it surprisingly well. By surprisingly well, I mean he made a few jokes about the guy getting anal tonight, but that's all good fun.P.S. I'm conflicted as to whether condemn or encourage parents to bring kids.

Updated review","This was the worst experience I ever had. Not only that they scammed us when we got there, but also by the way the management handled the situation. Not one of the staff members were surprised by the false information we were given about the line-up. They even stated that this happens all the time. Even though the manager ensured us we will get us our money back- It was extremely frustrating and time consuming to actually get the money. We had to go back to Standup NY several times. Know one identified himself. Even worse employees changed their names four/five during conversations. Julius (ticket sales manager) denied giving money back to any of their customers. He also insulted us by stating ""my parents are idiots"" and screamed on the phone. After wasting an hour talking to unprofessional staff and insisting on getting paid, money was sent to my paypal account (which by the way was not released). This is no way of running a business. It seems to me you spend more time on replying to negative posts (which are the majority of your customer ratings) then on actually satisfying your customers. DO NOT SUPPORT.",,,

This place is genuinely in the business of ripping tourists off, NOT in making lasting laughable memories. NOT TO MENTION all of the ""celebrity"" comedians the promoter promised would perform didn't. This place is such a trap. They also intentionally handout the bill 45 minutes before the show is over to ensure that you pay them the mountain of fees and expenses they hold you to before you leave. AND their credit card machine didn't work, so you HAD to pay cash. And if you didn't have any, you could either not see the show that night and come back another night, or go to a nearby ATM and pay exorbitant rates to pull cash out and pay them. I walked out after the second to last performance and placed my cash in the bill envelope. My waiter saw I was leaving and cornered me and asked me where the money was. I told him it was on the table and proceeded to walk out. He then commanded some other employee to ""watch them,"" I guess to make sure we weren't leaving without paying. ALL THIS (SUCKY) PLACE CARES ABOUT IS MONEY. THEY SUCK. THE COMEDIANS WERE ALRIGHT AT BEST. DON'T GO! YOU'RE BETTER OFF WATCHING COMEDY CENTRAL IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM!!!",3,1,1

And most importantly, the guy who sold us the tickets promised a line up that was non existing. His name was John (JD initials) and he was around midtown when we bumped into him. He swore on a line up that was pretty impressive and that didn't happen at all. The comedians were alright but not worth the price. The service charge alone was close to 9 dollars... On some water.

Also it is extremely crammed in there, I think there are too many audience members for the size. If there was a fire....CERTAIN DEATH.ANYWAYS besides those two deets, you're lookin at a great comedy club. The acts at my night were incredible and it was a really fun time.

When you get to this venue right there they let you know that the minimum consumption is 18 bucks which I think is not a nice welcoming to the place. There is bar and people will drink, specially at a stand up comedy event. I don't see the need of gliding by every 2 second to our faces asking if we want to drink now.  What if I don't drink alcohol at all? Are you going to force me to drink? Why don't you just increase price on tickets and done with it instead of getting people irritated while hovering around asking if one is ready for a drink. The other thing $5.00 for a small portion of popcorn... That was just a joke. I'm pretty sure it cost you guys less than a nickel to make those popcorn therefore the profit must be pretty sweet!

He said yes!!! Then we get to the door and we paid $18 online for tickets when everyone else is getting in for free! Then we still had to pay the $18 drunk minimum which ended up being 50 due to their insanely overpriced drink menu. $8 for a bottle of water!!!! Also 18% auto gratuity is annoying for a party of 2 and no separate checks. I was having a Bad day and wanted to come to let off steam and relax.

Plus I didn't have an extra $18 on a Cesar Salad.  I'm sure this place once had potential, but the vibe feels like everyone gave up.  Changes must be made or it's only going to get worse.  If it's the comedians that aren't working, change it.  If it's management, make an effort to hear out the complaints from the employees to try and obtain a positive energy.  I love comedy and feel my view of this place can be changed if changes are actually made.   Until I hear otherwise, I urge others to look elsewhere.  There are plenty of other venues that are cheaper, funnier and make you smile without the worry of your smile being made fun of...",6,2,1
147,P. S.,"Bushkill, PA",0,9,0,4.0,12/29/2013,"Last night 28 December, I decided to attend the late show, great decision for a plethora of reasonings. First, the comedians were expertly hilarious, witty, and seasoned. Began with the host mad dog; he should host the VMA's or something along that level. He started on the Australian couple and myself suggesting we're wealthy due to  our scarfs and  posture( clearly I would be the big brown Marine out the trio)-very funny.The comedians maintain the momentum of awesomeness- the acts that appeared subpar were actually very good however the level of hilarity  was through the roof (most  had us weak from laughter  over 90% of their set and those considered subpar only 75% (still  a great percentage and performance). I would be surprised if anyone had a bad taste outside the chick hit by the inebriated comics microphone or the priced beverage selection.Lastly, the bill! I had one drink couple with a surcharge, taxes and 18% gratuity nearly 40 bucks. Although not enough to break the bank quite the shocker for a beverage within a comedy club.  Almost forgot to compliment the bartender - my Long Island was pure alcohol just as I enjoy them! He didn't hold back one ounce-totally recommend!Ohh Rahh, Until I review the nightly entertainment, again!Have a fine Marine Corps Day!",1,,

BEWARE OF #1!1: I got my tickets, like many others, at Time Square. The guy approached me and told me they were 2 for 1, I was about to say yes, but he kept talking & said that for that evening they would be waiving the mandatory minimum of $15 per person for drinks. Sounded too good to be true! Well, it was, lol! He was a big ol LIAR. They NEVER wave it, as we were all told in line. So if someone tells you that, walk on.2: The show started at 7, we were there 30 minutes early, as we were told to be. Turns out they added comedians to the 1 show before ours and we were all stuck in a line till after 7. When it's really cold outside & raining, that kind of matters. Also, add to that the fact that some people were sneaky & came right before the show started just to buy a drink at the bar (located in the entrance by were the line forms) & then they were allowed to go in with the rest of us suckers who'd been waiting for more than half an hour AND they got to sit by the stage, we got stuck against the back wall.

The staff on the phone aren't helpful on this point and the situation gets worse at the door (cluster...).It's an expensive club for what you get and the sound is often bad for quieter comics. Get there a half hour ahead of weekend shows as reservations don't guarantee a seat. I've seen some pretty upset tourists get turned away despite having called ahead. Eat at a local resto before going to the club. Food not recommended.Saving grace of this place is the incredible number of hidden bathrooms downstairs.

178,Marissa M.,"Chicago, IL",39,72,32,3.0,3/14/2012,"Decent comedy show. $20 to tickets and a $15 drink minimum, so beware.  Yet, if you check-in via Yelp, they give you a drink coupon.It is very small and brings a mixed crowd.  It is a good stop for an evening out, but I wouldn't make it the main event.If you don't want to be a part of the show, sit in the back and for your own sake do NOT answer your phone while a comedian is on stage.  Some guy did that (rude) and they ate him alive.Enjoy!",3,,
179,Alicia B.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",3,26,2,5.0,2/25/2015,"I have gone here before and always had a blast, but last night I took a group of friends that had never been for my birthday. They were amazing. The waitress was by herself and was really great. The host at the door that greeted us was also lovely. I brought a homemade cake and they cut and served it to us and it turned out to be a hilarious piece of the comedians lines which was hilarious and embarrassing (but hilariously embarrassing... the good kind.). The host comedian was awesome, she was a hoot! We all had a great living social deal, but even without a deal, it's not too expensive. Thank you Stand Up NY for a great evening and a fantastic birthday!",,,
180,Troy S.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,1.0,4/25/2014,"Tourist trap.In contrast to what the totally misleading ticket seller guy (""Sebastian"") said, beware of the following:- $20 per-person drink minimum + 18% mandatory gratuity (different from a '2 drink minimum')- the show is at a club, not a sound stage, and has no clear connection to any media company- the lineup for the show was altogether different from what was described- tickets say to arrive 30 mins early; but we didn't even get seated until 20 minutes after scheduled start of show; the show started probably 15 minutes after thatI totally get everyone's motivation here. Ticket sellers want to sell tickets, comedy venues want to guarantee drink sales, etc., but being misled makes the whole thing kinda not funny.",2,,
181,Ros G.,"Manhattan, NY",64,27,1,3.0,2/23/2012,"I found a Groupon deal for two tickets for $15 so I decided to surprise my husband and take him. It was our first time at a Comedy Club! The place has a bar at the entrance and the comedy club/stage is towards the back. I truly loved our experience--they were hysterical, especially Gina Brillon and Jim David. We saw a line-up of 6-9 comedians. The only guy I didn't like was Rich Franchese...and I think I speak on behalf of everyone there last night. Either that or he just had the wrong crowd...he was a bit ""too"" sick. The only reasons that I bring this down to a 3 star experience is 1) the $15 minimum beverage charge (food doesn't apply) PER person (so on top of paying our tickets for the show we had to drink something--even though we had a large dinner prior to the show, 2) the comedy club is a bit cramped...seating is super tight, but you'll be sitting there for 3 hours so ehhh, and 3) I recall having seen a 16 years old and up requirement, but somehow at our table there was a family with their 12 year old son which made things super awkward with certain jokes. I would go on, but the obligatory $15 minimum charge really would make me think twice. Oh, and did I mention that Chris Rock showed up unannounced for the last skit? Everyone was SUPER surprised! That was really fun.",2,1,1
182,Jane G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/16/2015,"What a bait and switch rip off.I paid for three tickets in advance to see Greer Barnes advertised as playing two shows tonight. At no point was I advised that he had cancelled. Instead, I arrived to be told that the credit card machine was broken so all bills needed to be paid in cash. There is a two drink minimum per person and we were planning on eating dinner which is advertised on their website as provided by the restaurant Serafina. Not so. We ordered nachos and drinks and burgers. 45 minutes later my drink had not been delivered. I finally had to go to the bar in the other room and get it myself.Understaffed, but the waitress had short term memory issues as it was. Burgers came, no Catsup. When Catsup was requested a nearly empty farting bottle was brought to the table. The ATM gave me $180 for a $200 withdrawal and the microphone on the last act cut out completely. Everything is wrong with this place. And I spent over $200 finding this out. Gotham on west 23rd is where I will return next, as they have professional service and a more comfortable set up without this myriad of problems.There was never any mention during the show of the headliner canceling.",1,1,1
183,C J.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,9,3,4.0,2/7/2016,Went on 1/18/16 -Comedians were good-I didn't like that they require a minimum of two drinks which are pricey- if you want to save money don't order alcoholic beverages- they average $15 and are not the best. I'd return.,,,

Updated review","Here is the reason for an update; after I posted my review, the owner, Dani Z. contacted me and offered to mail the tickets that I was supposed to receive. i think this is so sweet as obviously he is caring about his business and the satisfaction of his customers. I forgot to mention the food from Serafina was delicious.",,,
185,David S.,"Lockeford, CA",0,20,0,4.0,3/4/2015,"Hadn't heard of any of these comics before, but 6 out of the 7 we saw were awesome. The 7th was strange but pretty funny. The host was great. Two drink minimum is typical for any comedy club.This is a great place to see up and coming comedians. Really worth checking out.",,,
186,Olin H.,"San Diego, CA",315,148,2,2.0,7/24/2012,"No A/C. No power to the microphone. Stupid seating. The venue could not be worse. The comedians were great. Overall, I'd go to a different place -- one that has a working air conditioner and a microphone.",1,,

189,Caroline L.,"Coral Gables, FL",6,16,8,4.0,8/24/2014,"I was under the impression that Marina Franklin was the main performer.  She was the third performer out of about 6.  she did really well, but it was such a short piece she did, which kind of disappointed me.  The place had a two drink or $20 per person minimum, which is pretty standard for comedy clubs.  The venue was small enough to be intimate, but large enough to house an interesting and diverse crowd.  I'm glad I went!",,,1
190,Derek S.,"Douglaston, Queens, NY",368,19,1,3.0,7/15/2012,"Went to a 7pm show with my bud. I would give it 4 stars except for the fact that it was pricey ($9 coronas?) My Manhattan cocktails though were pretty strong (cheap liquor by the taste.) Otherwise, great line-up. The place looked great and although it was tight it wasn't unbearable. Expect raunchy and inappropriate jokes, but those are the best!Would definitely go again but I would grumble over the service/price.",,1,
191,Stephen T.,"Gateshead, United Kingdom",2,16,9,3.0,5/1/2014,"Just returned from and evening show.I am a tourist in New York I picked up a couple of tickets from a seller in time square and I have been to comedy clubs in the UK as well as big stadium comedy superstars. This is basically a mixture. If you enjoy stand up you will like this. There are a few caveats I need to throw in. Like the rest of the USA the price you see is NOT the price you pay. Firstly there is a two drink minimum. My wife doesn't drink alcohol so we paid for at least one drink we could not consume. You are charged an 18% service fee on the bill. This is really just a sort of tax charged extra on your bill. Common in the USA and uncommon in Europe, illegal in some countries where the full price must be shown. This is normal behaviour in the USA. The announcer reminded everyone to tip at the end because the waitresses work for tips. Most Europeans don't mind tipping for good or exceptional service but find tipping to top up lack of wages not acceptable. After paying the 18% percent and the 'drinks tax' you feel you have perhaps been set up to be scammed for as much money as possible.The organisation is very mechanical, Get the people in, serve the drinks, get the cash, get the people out for the next show to repeat the process. The comedy was pretty good. The artists were prepared and delivered some funny stuff. Americans are obsessed by race. In part this was self-deprecation but it is also a national trait. Quite a lot of racism involved but the Americans in the audience seemed very tolerant of this. Again this can be a cheap laugh but I think it was a cultural aspect of US comedy. I don't want to over-analyse this but be prepared for deliberately offensive material.When faced with entertainment in New York a comedy club can be a refreshing alternative. A different kind of experience. However be aware it will cost a lot more than is on the ticket and the humour is for an adult audience.",1,,
192,Jason E.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,4.0,12/12/2014,Have been going to SUNY for 15 years.  After a few years of having lost their way they are back.  Saw a show tonight and 4 of 5 comics were hysterical.  Highly recommend.  Not just for tourists.,,,
193,David I.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/8/2016,"I think this is the most underrated places in NYC, A friend gave us tickets, we didn't know what to expect, we have been to other comedy clubs in NYC like the Cellar many times cause we all went to NYU so we were surprised and excited to keep seeing comics come up on stage that we've seen at the cellar. Its a 2 drink minimum but that is the standard in all comedy clubs and it was well worth it. What really got me was that Jay Pharaoh from SNL showed up and we just couldnt stop talking about it after the show. Highly Recommended!!!",,,
194,Joanna C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,5,0,4.0,1/27/2012,"My husband and I went on a Saturday night after purchasing a living social coupon - it was $25 for our cover charges plus 2 appetizers, then we had to buy one drink each.  Appetizers were not worth it - so I would not recommend going for the food (there have been groupons that include drinks instead of food, so keep an eye out for those instead).  Comedy was outstanding - we saw 5 comedians and they were all really good.  The ""host"" Bob was hilarious.  As others have said, seating is very tight, but what do you expect for a small neighborhood comedy venue?  The audience was diverse and the bachlorette party with 10 girls sitting up front made it even funnier!I would definitely go back for the comedy and drinks, just not the food.  So I am giving it four stars for ""Yay! I'm a fan."" per yelp standards since we had so much fun.  If they claimed to have great food, then I would have only given it three stars based on my higher expectations, but who goes to a comedy show for the food?!",1,,1
195,Jessica B.,"Reston, VA",791,13,5,5.0,11/2/2015,"This is my favorite club in the city when I'm in town. I love the feel of the place. The comics are top notch.

I really like the atmosphere. I really recommend it.",,,
196,Erica H.,"Ridgefield, CT",6,11,2,5.0,8/25/2014,"Hilarious and amazing comedy here! Enjoyed it from start to finish. I would recommend this comedy club to anyone who has a sense of humor. I bought a complimentary ticket from Goldstar plus a $6 service fee per ticket. Can't complain about that. Drinks were expensive, but welcome to New York. Got a bucket of 6 beers for $50 (domestic was $45) which was better than $9.50 per beer. Overall, had a great night with tons of laughs. Will definitely come back another time.",,,
197,Thuy N.,"San Jose, CA",46,19,3,1.0,4/2/2013,"My bf and I encountered a guy on the street selling tickets for the show while waiting for our tour bus. We were visiting and he really wanted to see a good comedy show so we decided to give it a try. The sale guy was nice enough to give us a discount at $10 per person and said there's a 2 drinks minimum. When we got to the place the show had already started 10-15 mins. ago so we walked straight towards the back of the bar and talked to the guy hosting the show. He said to stand there and wait until someone seat us and after a few minutes nobody came. He was just standing there so I turn over to him and he decided to seat us towards the end of the room. As I walk through the place I noticed that ALMOST EVERYONE was drinking and the seat we were seated at were so narrow that I barely have an leg room. We were literally sitting in cluster. And it stink so bad! from the B-O of people sitting around and drinking. There was nothing classy about that place so if you're planning to take someone on a date or trying to fine a decent place. this isn't the place for you. In addition to that, the jokes were not clean. It was kind of inappropriate  actually and wasn't even that funny. Maybe because I didn't drink much and drank mostly coke and water the rest of the time I was there. The only two people I thought was decent were the two African American performance. Surprisingly their jokes were clean and respectful and SLIGHTLY FUNNY and perhaps professional. The rest of the people jokes were in foul language and were about genitals or something similar to that (a bit amateur, I would say). But people did laugh. I guess they were either halfway drunk or already drunk so anything those people say could be funny. The environment was not clean. I got creep out using the bathroom. No toilet paper in both of the bathroom and it seem like nobody came to clean it. I had to let them know that they were out of toilet papers.Besides that they didn't give us a menu so we were basically clueless on what to order but we knew that it was a 2 drinks minimum (we were unclear if it was 2 drinks total or 2 drinks per person) so my bf ordered alcohol but I ordered soda instead. Didn't come to find out that the drinks were close to $10 or more each and that we could have an option to get unlimited soda, juice or water for $20 until after we got the bill. ********Long story short, this was not the comedy central I imagined it to be. I thought that I would at least have some leg room or be cleaner environment where I can be comfortable but I felt so squished in my own seat. I think I would have had a better time watching the real comedy central on T.V at home and get my money's worth with some Chinese food delivery.",6,2,2
198,Ali A.,"Washington, DC",167,7,0,2.0,7/23/2011,"Went back to this place after a while -- the first time was a better experience, regarding their service. We were told that we had a 2 drink minimum but most places don't enforce it. be ware, if you go here, you HAVE to buy two drinks or else they will charge you $22.00 regardless. 1. I was annoyed by this concept because I had 1 drink, and didn't order a second drink, but, the waitress did not even remind me that I had to buy a second one, leaving me thinking, well, I just bought one, thats what I should get charged for...NOPE, bill came, everyone on my table that only had 1 drink were charged for 2, and the second drink was never even offered eventhough we paid for it --  yeah some say rules are rules, but I am not a fan of shady rules and regulations, and not being on the side of the costumer to at least remind us to order another, or offer us and everyone else in our shoes a drink at the bar, on our way out. There is also an entrance fee of 20 dollars -- so all in all, $44.00 is a given there, not counting the tip.2. We had probably the worse seats -- they sat us all the way in the corner, behind their comedian wall -- half of the people I was with could barely see the comedian. Nicer clubs would either offer free drinks for such crappy seats, or atleast not charge us the entrance fee. 3. Probably not going back here again, because there are a ton of better, small time comedy clubs in NYC with better rates.",2,,1
199,Al E.,"Toledo, OH",5,11,1,3.0,9/14/2014,"Ok, I am torn by this place, the comics were great and I love the cozy lounge feel. Tickets aren't that pricey and they have groupon and yelp deals that make it better! but the menu is pricey with the 20$ drink minimum but honestly for the quality of comics that you get it's pretty much worth it! I think they are trying to correct the negative aspects from some of the yelp reviews I've read about this place. I will be attending again!",,,
