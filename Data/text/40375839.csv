0,Dayi T.,"Brooklyn, NY",202,17,14,5.0,10/8/2018,"Holy shit the the menu is EXTENSIVE. You'll get a million different choices, knowing you can't make a ""wrong"" choice. I've tried the breakfast and burger menu so far, and the food has been pretty consistently tasty: filling, flavorful, fresh fruits and veggies. A bit overpriced, but reasonably so. Oh don't order orange juice. No joke, they serve it in shot glasses, no refills. It's a great diner to have a big friends' brunch or late-night dinner outing -- the atmosphere is very old-school and perfect for vivacious youthful conversations. The servers are the buffest I've ever seen. It feels like Cozy has existed since the beginning of America and will never disappear.",,,
1,Christina G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",110,92,233,2.0,7/5/2018,"Overpriced and okay to subpar food. Come here only if you're close by and no other place is open.Food- 3.25    Taste: 3.5    Presentation: 3Atmosphere/Aesthetic: 3.5Service: 2.5Price/Value: 1.5This place is so ridiculously overpriced, which is my main reason for giving it two stars. Second reason is the slow service. The food is completely average here, no better than fast food. Honestly, some dishes are less appealing than fast food. However, the prices are that of a nice dining restaurant ($6 for a small plate of fries). The interior is neat at first, as it has a retro NYC diner feel. But after a bit, it just feels like a novelty.Maybe come here once, but that's probably all you'd ever need.",1,,
2,Seth B.,"New York, NY",1,17,0,3.0,6/1/2018,"I am glad this diner exists, but that doesn't mean I want to go there very often. It has been around a long time, and definitely retains its old-school vibe. I believe it is open 24hrs, which is nice. The food is kind of irregular. I had a hamburger that tasted as though the meat had been frozen and thawed several times before it was cooked. The eggs are all right. The waitstaff will not win awards for graciousness. The place is a bit overpriced...but the location is convenient.",,,

4,Rita T.,"San Diego, CA",6,23,63,5.0,6/6/2018,"Came in as customers, left as family! Even though it was a bit out of our way from where we were staying in Manhattan. But this was referred to us by someone to have breakfast there. But we made it for lunch. They have a great selection on their menu. We ordered a variety of foods (5 of us total) I loved their chicken sandwich & soup! And they also had a good kids menu as well. The hostess and staff were so friendly. We also met the BOSS! He was such a great guy & he gave my girls really cool pens that glow. They still use them : ) Thank you guys for your kind service, good food & a memorable chat! XOXO God Bless you all, we'll stop by to visit on our next trip! Love, the San Diego family Can't wait to come by for Breakfast this time!",2,,2
5,Kizzy S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",171,45,37,5.0,7/21/2018,We just popped in this spot for lunch. It was quiet and clean. Nice lil spot with really good service. The burgers were amazing. My friend's burger was not cooked quite as much as she preferred and the server GLADLY took it back and brought out another one for her. I had the French toast Monte Cristo and it was EXCEPTIONAL!!!!! Certainly a spot that I would re-visit!,,,
6,Doug M.,"Saratoga County, NY",29,21,29,5.0,9/27/2018,Grand slam... no really. Good breakfast. Fun banter with the staff. Perfect. Ham egg and cheese was perfectly hard. Coffee cup was never empty.,,,
7,James R.,"Nesconset, NY",229,147,138,3.0,4/9/2018,"Cozy Soup n Burger boasts on the menu that it has been around since 1972.  And I believe them.  It has an old school feel to this place right with the heavy doors when you walk in.  This is a classic NY Diner with the same food as all of the other ""good"" diners in and around the city.   If you want regular, old diner food...you wont be disappointed here.  The waiters take your order on old school pads and scream the orders to the kitchen staff.  Very noisey atmosphere. You get a hand written bill for your check (double check it for accuracy) ...No computers over here! lol My friend is a life long resident of the LES of Manhattan and picked this spot that he went to since a kid.  He likes old school spots like this because he doesnt know better.  He got french toast and I ordered the grilled chicken double decker sandwich.  Just like restaurants back in the day.... a crazy amount of food on the plate but you know that I finished it all.  The portion was huge.  The food was good.  But I have had this same sandwich from Diners all over the area.  When I am in Manhattan I like to eat good stuff.  Not eat at a place I can get the same exact food on Long Island with the same menu items to choose from.  So it wasnt bad by any means....I just wouldnt waste a meal on boring food in this part of the city.  If you want ""comfort"" Diner Food and an old school / nostalgic feel come and check it out.",2,1,1

10,Jeshow Y.,"Alhambra, CA",298,180,25,3.0,5/24/2018,Reviews told me the bacon cheese burger was good. So I got it with a deluxe plate. The burger wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. It just tasted pretty plain. The fries were plain and the vegetables next to it were also eh. The split pea soup was good though. Definitely coming back for that instead.,1,,
11,Jasmine F.,"New York, NY",6,21,7,4.0,9/1/2018,Went after the gym. We got a table quickly. Food came out quick and was decent. This is definitely an old school diner. There are a lot if options to choose from but nothing too complex. They stick to very basic ingredients and options. Every time I've been here it's always been crowded. I wish they just had more healthier options and that the staff we're a little bit more friendlier and accommodating. Overall it's a good place to get a quick bite and go,,,
12,Kristina S.,"Queens, NY",1,11,0,2.0,4/13/2018,"The split pea soup with the croutons is the best soup I've ever had. Unfortunately, the host (maybe he's the owner too?) made me feel very uncomfortable when I was paying for my takeout. I asked if there was a credit card minimum since I didn't have any cash, and he said he would ""let it slide"" for me this once. I thanked him and as I was leaving, he (no joke) told me I was a horrible person. I didn't leave a tip, because it's takeout, and I think he was under the impression that I should have since he let me use my credit card. It was so awkward because his tone was neutral while he was saying it, so I'm just looking at him and smiling as I'm leaving while someone casually says I'm a terrible human being. Umm, thanks?",,,1
13,James M.,"Brooklyn, NY",300,19,3,3.0,3/31/2018,"I've been a patron of Cozy's since 1987, so for 30+ years, and they've always been a reliable place for diner food and their specialty: Split pea soup. But I'm going to be frequenting Cozy's less because of their sloppy service and their tendency to overcharge you. The last couple of times I explicitly ordered a cup of soup. They bring you a bowl. And they charge you for a bowl. And the waiters act like grumpy malcontents most of the time. Then, instead of charging you 8.875% tax, they are considerate enough to round up to 10% most of the time. I understand that they're an institution, but the service has gotten really slack lately.To recap:* Pancakes* Waffles* 2 burgers* 1 cup (bowl) of soup--------Total: $70.00?GTFO",1,,

15,Natalie Helen R.,"Manhattan, NY",282,2,0,1.0,1/1/2018,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. DO NOT EVER ORDER FOOD TO BE DELIVERED. They do not use heat bags to keep the food warm (which cost 10 dollars btw) and then are rude when you tell them the food is cold. The owner, John, was INSANELY rude to our amazing customer service lady at Seamless. Hey John- If you open a restaurant, at least take a crash course in How To first",2,1,

17,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,4.0,4/6/2017,"I came here really early in the morning with some friends after a night out because this was the only place open at 5 A.M. My friends and I were craving diner comfort food in the area and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp. As the other reviews says, you must try the burgers here if it's your first time. It's not the best burger I've ever had, but it's good enough to fulfill my greasy food cravings after a night out. I had my burger done medium rare with fries. My friends had breakfast platters, cheesecakes and omelettes  and there were no complaints whatsoever with their food. Overall, I'd definitely consider this place if I'm ever in the area and craving diner comfort food. Their service is impeccable as they were fine with the 10 or so of us being a bit rowdy. They also accept major credit cards. Also a plus 1 for being open 24/7!",3,,

19,Kheeda C.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,60,80,1.0,7/26/2017,"Wish I saw the review about the rude and lazy staff at this place. I think this establishment believes that since they have cool pictures of celebrities who've frequent them in the past, that they have established themselves and don't need to do anything else. Well I don't know who fooled ya'll but customer service is non existence at this establishment. However, only with the bussers and their sweet souls were kind.I came from a casting with my model friend in the area. And we were starving.. like when are models not starving right? lol. The hostess at the front literally waved her hands and said sit anywhere. So we chose the window seat and was so happy that we can people watch while eating breakfast on a slow Saturday morning.The server was so gruff and very short with us, idk if it was a bad Saturday morning for him, but come on.Long story short because we decided to dismiss his approach. I just ordered the hotcakes with turkey sausages and eggs over medium. My girl ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich. The food didn't take long at all. It came out and I notice right away that the eggs were over easy (not a huge fan of overly runny eggs). I literally had to flag him down since he wasn't paying us attention. As I'm telling him the eggs aren't over medium. My guy did not even wait till I was finished, he just grabbed the plate, did not even wait till I removed the sausages, and took it to the kitchen. My girl is from out of town and shes looking at me like what is up with this place. I've been here on multiple occasions with my ex and the service is usually better than this. We dismissed that because we were really trying to catch up on old times laughing and conversing about our plans for the day and suddenly I heard a loud BANG on the table right near my arms.It was the server! He literally slammed the plate of sausage and eggs on the table. Everybody and their mum turned around! I was shook. I literally jumped. He noticed what he did and hovered for 5 second saying eggs over medium. Like blood, I know what the hell I ordered. SMH! My only regret was not walking out this place the minute that happened. We both looked at each other and to make it even worse, she noticed that we were the only POC here and he did not slam the food on the table to the party next to us. Although I am sure it has nothing to do with our skin, maybe, who knows. We just ate our food hurriedly and decided not to tip him at all!However as we were about to leave and pay, I did tell the host (the woman was no longer there) at the front that he slammed our food on the table and that I will not be tipping that man. But guess what guys, the dag on host was on the phone yapping it up as were paying for our food to leave.LOL!!!  I cannot take this place serious and I sure as hell will not be spending my money that I work hard for, at an establishment that does not respect its patrons.",6,1,3

25,Chris B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,14,0,1.0,5/30/2017,"Unfortunately I didn't get to try the food here. Service is TERRIBLE. Staff is extremely lazy and rude. Walked in on Mon, May 29 around noonish. Was my last day in NY, so had 1 larger duffle bag and 2 smaller duffles had been lugging around from the metro. It was raining. Place was less than half full. Menu looked good as they had whole wheat pancakes.Told the hostess 2 people. She didn't move off her butt and said ""sit anywhere you like"". Thought ok, great. Looked around, wanted a booth. Didn't want chairs. NY is so crowded, didn't really want to sit by people. Saw a nice booth with a window view so thought it would be great to sit there and watch the people outside like I had done at 5 Guys the day before. Put the luggage into 2 seats. Was about to sit down in the booth. Extremely rude man who worked there comes over and says, you can't sit there, it is a table for 5. Sit over here at the round table with chairs for 4. I told him, the hostess said we could sit anywhere we like. He said yes, you can sit anywhere you like. I said anywhere, but apparently not at this table. I said the restaurant is 1/2 empty, there are plenty of seats. And she said sit anywhere we like. He said to move and take the round table with chairs over by the side wall.We moved our stuff. However, decided screw this. If they are hassling us as to where to sit, after saying sit anywhere you like, they were NOT going to get my $$$. i was so mad.Left and found a good diner (Landmark) that had no problem where we sat, and the food was great.Avoid this diner at all costs. I would rather go hungry, and walk another mile with bags in the rain, which we did, than ever eat here with the crummy attitude of the staff.",3,,

We're big fans of the split pea and matzoh ball soup with a grilled cheese and tomato. That's all I've had and that's probably all I'll ever have for here because I like it so damn much.My only problem with this place is that it's a tad on the expensive side for what it is. But that hasn't stopped me from getting that delicious split pea. The service is usually very speedy as well.,4,2,

Updated review","Came here late night with friends 2 wks ago and my food was basic diner breakfast food. Nothing to brag about. We were profiled by the server, who thought we wouldnt tip maybe because we are black. A group of 4 with well paying jobs and were not drunk partygoers. We went out and afterwards was hungry n took a drive to the closest diner. We enjoyed our own company but the waiters were rude. We felt rushed in a empty restaurant. Upon entering another waiter was arguing with a customer about the tip. We ate and we paid the cheap bill. Instead of returning the change the waiter came and said ""he is keeping the change because he works on tips"".wtf??!!.....we WERE gonna tip u ...BUT since u basically stole our change, we ordered more food to even it out (he was pissed) and we LEFT. YOU CANT STEAL YOUR CUSTOMERS MONEY. IF MY FOOD WAS $15 and i give u a $20 GIVE ME MY $5! THEN ,LET THE CUSTOMER TIP UPON LEAVING! dont ASSUME everyone is a bad tipper!Tips are EARNED and the service was HORRIBLE!Never again!",1,,

When we called the restaurant, the owner was extremely rude and said that's what we should expect when ordering food for delivery in the cold temps.

This place is a rip off and advise all of you not to go here. I work for NYU and no one will ever come here knowing that. Save your money and pick a different place. Immensely disappointed. Here's the kicker - - the cheese wasn't even melted, and no one needs a sandwich with 10 slices of american cheese on it!!

This place is nothing amazing I visited once prior in my teenage years when my palette was super simple. I ordered the chicken tenders and curly fries my friend ordered a chicken pineapple burger with skinny fries and my other friend had the mushroom burger with curly fries and cheese. Their only complaints was that it's an extra 1.50 to substitute the fries and the slice of American cheese instead of melted. Me however my plate left much to be desired I could taste that the chicken fingers were frozen not fresh slices of chicken breast seasoned and fries as I would have liked & the fries weren't curly when they landed on my plate, they were broken apart.

Also this place always has some customers no matter what the time. As a 24/7 place I'm here at like 2 or 3 AM yet there are always at least two or three other groups of people eating as well. This place feels very homey and the food is so good! I get the grilled chicken parmigiana (around $13/14) which is so good! This place is a little bit pricy but for the portions you get, I cannot complain. The snack platter (around $15) is so generous with mozzarella sticks, fried chicken, and chicken tenders (with of course their fries). The mozzarella sticks are so soft and it comes with some marinara dipping sauce.Of course they're soup is so good. I highly recommend the chicken noodle soup.

Well for one, you've just downed arguably a meals worth of liquid calories, why not take it a bit easy + with cheese and appropriate accoutrements, it maintains just the right amount of grease to coat your stomach.

I was one of the people in the party mentioned in the review dated 1/21. We visited the restaurant prior to attending the women's march on NYC and had small protest signs with us. An older waiter (who was not our server) went out of his way to comment on the content of our signs and reminded us that there was no point in yelling, as this is the way things are. I initially wrote this off as an older man bored and commenting. As we gathered up everything to leave, having already PAID AND TIPPED, he began questioning our beliefs on homosexuality and gay marriage. We didn't engage more than to say that we supported gay marriage. He began yelling 'Wake up' at our party and commenting that this was against his religious beliefs. We left promptly, concerned about his obvious anger.IN SHORT: this restaurant allowed a homophobic waiter to verbally attack a party of people who had paid and eaten their food quietly. This is inexcusable, and illegal, as sexual orientation is a protected identity under anti-discrimination law. Don't go here, don't go back.",2,1,

(My server probably wasn't, but it's America!)Their French onion isn't bad, with toasted pieces of French bread and plenty of carmelized onion action. A cup is actually not stingy, so you'll already be half full by the time your dish comes out.

I've eaten there three times in the past two months and they have yet to get my order right.The food is passable, it's cleaner than a lot of greasy-spoon diners, and I can see why NYU students pulling an all-nighter might need to recharge there at 3 in the morning. But during normal restaurant hours, there are a hundred better options within a mile radius. (The Stage on 2nd Avenue leaps to mind.)

They're good for groups though, as I've come here with the upwards of 15 other people at times and it wasn't an issue. Also, I've been charged for some things that I didn't request, like a ""deluxe"" burger platter instead of the burger by itself, which I don't think is especially honest, because I just asked for lettuce and tomato on the burger. In addition to that, the food is generally reasonably priced but the add-ons cost so much that you have to be careful how you order your food, so they don't trap you with $5 worth of extras.

I ordered the chicken tenders and asked for ranch. I kid you not, the ranch came in under 30 seconds, conveniently labeled with an R on top of the lid. My comrade (he's not a communist), ordered a bacon cheeseburger, medium, like a true American patriot.Now, bear in mind, Yelp readers, that my dining partner and I have brunch reservations for 11:30 tomorrow morning, but we couldn't resist stuffing our gullets with this fine diner cuisine.His burger was extremely meaty and juicy, just the way he likes them. My chicken fingers were fried to a golden brown perfection. The portion was so large that i couldn't finish the fingerlings, but thanks to the insatiable appetite of my dining companion, no food was wasted. We are a team, we are.

We came in during a slow part of the day and waited about 5 minutes before anyone came by. After that it was another 10 until we had coffee. This trend continued throughout the meal: slow water/coffee refills, denial about wrong orders, and even a Rex Ryan-style ""time out"" hand signal rendered by our waiter when he wanted to ask us a question mid-conversation. No one expects five star service at a diner, but basic civility and promptness are key. I didn't find them here.",1,,

She said she was craving pizza, but ordered chocolate chip pancakes with half an avocado instead (close enough). I ordered some potato skins. Now, this ain't T.G.I. Friday's; these came out fresh, loaded with crispy bacon and melted cheese. The only downside was that it came with a small amount of sour cream. If I'm ordered potato skins at 2:00 AM, clearly I have no shame and do not care much at that moment about my health.The place was clean, the service was friendly, and the food came out hot and quick.

I don't want to say it's because of racism but that's def how it felt. 2 waiters denied to take my tables order and keep in mind 2 parties that came in after mine had already be served while I was still waiting to place an order. When I finally did get my order taken the waiter was rushing to take my orders. The only reason I gave 2 stars was because I enjoyed my burger and chili. But not even the food can have me step foot back into this place. And it's truly sad. Oh and let's not mention they messed up my orders twice. Smh.,1,,

Updated review","Still my favorite spot for no frills diner food.  The menu is extensive and I've never had a bad meal in almost 10 years of eating here.  With that said, I also don't order the pasta or chicken parmigiana.  Come on people, it's a diner...let's be realistic.  They make a good breakfast: eggs any style, pancakes, and challah bread french toast.  I love the corned beef hash!  If you want to avoid the brunch crowd on the weekends, stop over here instead.  For lunch I like their grilled cheese, fresh cut meats, chicken salad, tuna salad, curly fries and french onion soup.   If you want a decent meal at a reasonable price in a comfortable and friendly environment, check this place out.  The waiters are friendly and some remember me and my order from previous visits.  It's a neighborhood kind of place.",,,

I'll paint a picture, not in a literal sense but rather a textical sense: He walks up, casual like, holding not more than a single pitcher of water. My friend and I, we'd both been relatively thirsty that night. Enough so that the two cups before us were empty, save a few cubes of ice. He knows this, I know this, and my friend know this. Properly assessing the situation, he deems it necessary that the both of us are replenished in our hydrative needs. He proceeds to use the primary spout to pour my companion's water, tipping the jug in a magical fashion so that the other side of the pitcher spouts into my cup. Within a few seconds we were both good to go. Five stars. (Food was OK, it's your fault for eating at a diner in NYC.)",1,4,1

Besides the sheer convenience of a diner open all the time, the food is great and the service is outstanding. I have been here several times, ordering a range of diner iterms such as eggs, sandwiches, pancakes, etc. I wouldn't say anything really stands out food wise as a ""have to"" order, but it's a diner - don't come here expecting culinary triumph. Come here because its a warm, friendly diner in a great location, and the food is pretty good.

You can always count on it to give something good and filling.We got the French Onion Soup, a Chili Burger with Fries, a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with bacon and tomatoes, and an order of Chicken Fingers. The soup was very good. The soup with bits of onions and croutons, and melted cheese on top. The burger was a knife and fork kinda burger, since it was pretty messy to eat. The steak fries were very good too, especially if you use either the chili from the burger or the honey mustard as dipping sauce. The grilled cheese and chicken fingers were really good too.  The kitchen is very fast at getting orders out and the servers are super nice.",1,,

When we walked in we were greeted by a hostess who, after we told her we were a party of two pointed vaguely to a bunch of tables instead of walking is there herself, so we just sat at the first empty booth we found. The service was great we never waited to long. The food came out in a timely matter. I had the cheeseburger and my boyfriend had the chicken fingers (he wasn't feeling well) both were very good!    However we ordered a side of potato wedges and they were great but a bit pricey for the amount that they gave you (just three potato skins for $8.) Another thing that surprised me was the fact that they did not serve hard liquor!  Just beer on tap!  I was looking forward to getting my night started early and was totally bummed upon this realization.

146,Frank V.,"Hunters Point, Queens, NY",0,11,32,5.0,4/28/2013,"Best burger in New York City. That includes the five boroughs. I thought you should know.So, in the 1980's my Dad took me here for burgers. When I went to college, I always recommended it. Better than Jackson Hole (but not as big). Their burgers are probably one notch up on the grease scale... but if that turns you off, you shouldn't be Yelping burger joints. They come with perfectly cooked and tasteful toppings - not overloaded - and awesome fries and onion rings depending on what you order. The cole slaw rocks.So around 1993, a place called ""David's Burgers"" opened up on East 13th Street and Second Avenue, and they had a burger menu about three feet long: ostrich, buffalo, whatever. The burger set was a twitter. Many of my friends swore by Davids. Guess what? They're out of business.But I didn't get to lower Manhattan much after that. You know, I'm getting older. When we meet friends these days we go to the ""expensive restaurants"".So the other day, I was in the Alphabet and a friend said he's in the mood for a great burger. So I said ""Really?"" and I made him walk five long blocks to Cozy Soup and Burger. The whole time he's saying ""This better be a great burger,"" etc. He sees the place, he's like ""A diner?""

165,Charles C.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",26,3,0,1.0,8/17/2014,"I never thought I'd write a bad yelp review. Here goes: I ordered a burger, asked for medium rare. They gave me a burger that was completely raw in the middle. I told the waiter, he brought my half eaten patty back five minutes later. It was just weird, and they were rude about it too.",1,1,
166,Stevie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,1.0,4/9/2016,Do not eat here!  I couldn't even eat the chilli because it was so bad.  My boyfriend ordered a burger and fries and he just texted me that he is throwing up.  Top all off the waiter was terrible and this place is over priced.  I will be calling the health department.,,,
167,Jessica T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,5,4.0,9/1/2014,"stumbled upon this little diner last weekend while out for a little ice cream date night with the boyfriend. we were a little hungry prior so we tried this place out. we loved it. food was super fast, staff seemed nice & attentive. I'm a newly dieter (thumbs down), and ordered an avocado & tomato sandwich, the waiter looked at me like I had 4 heads but gladly served me what I wanted. all in all good little diner, we'd go back. :)",1,,
168,A Z.,"New York, NY",61,404,26,3.0,12/21/2014,I stopped into cozys on my way home one night and got the best cup of cream of broccoli soup. Hit the spot. 24 hr diner for NYU crowd. Nice and polite service.,,,
169,Elizabeth B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,25,0,3.0,4/14/2013,"A solid 3 1/2 stars. I usually get their burgers & matzoh ball soup. Both are solid but not extraordinary. Their delivery is fast, their burgers meaty and they are open 24 hours. A perfect place to stop in after a long night out. With their huge menu, something will tickle your fancy. It's really comfort food -- don't expect anything too nuanced or innovative. A bit on the pricy side for what you get (a burger with add-ons can run up to $13 without fries). But consistent, tasty food at your door in 15 minutes...I'm sold.",,,
170,Michele D.,"Pipersville, PA",3,4,0,1.0,8/9/2014,"Wanted to put no stars because we didn't actually get to eat but yelp wouldn't let me. Service was awful We sat at the exact same time as the table next to us. Both sat for 10 minutes until a waiter came. He got their drinks and order and said, quite rudely, he would be with us when done with the other table. Little did I know, this meant after he actually served their food! Who does that? After sitting in this restaurant with my two small children waiting for even drinks, and seeing that happen, we walked out. I'll never try again and I certainly won't be recommending this to any friends.",1,,

172,Sean A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/3/2014,"You know the old chestnut, 'You can't go home again?' Certainly the case with the dump.  Haven't been here since the 90s, went there today for a Cozy Burger to go, and it was terrible. Meat was dry, flavorless and overcooked, AND they left off the onions, which I discovered only when I arrived home. Got soggy onion rings instead of fries--and the batter tasted like  over-seasoned Italian breadcrumbs--disgusting. Price for this awful meal: $18.60!  Telephone tough guy manager was badmouthing two women--after they left of course-- who refused to pay for the second soda they were served, since the waiter filled up their glasses without them asking. Whatever, but you're going to call your customers ""stupid b-tches""? That's just rude.And I mean this in a constructive way--anyone who thinks these are the best burgers in NYC..let alone on this block..really REALLY needs to get out more. AVOID THIS PLACE",2,,

We just asked him to change our dish (like every attendant's jobs), then he was just keep murmuring in his mother language!!! When we checked, he was covering the bill then asking my friend to sign. We were keep thinking the total number, then calculated it again. Then we found that he deceived us!!! He had us pay like 25%tips for the dinner!!! I'm so furious now!!!

176,C L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,106,2,1.0,11/4/2013,"This is literally one of the worst restaurants that I have ever stepped foot in, and I cannot even fathom why it managed to get 3.5 stars, especially given its prime location.I don't know if it was just what I ordered, but the service itself was enough to warrant a 1-star review. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, which was the one of the most disgusting pieces of shit I've ever been served. I also ordered the curly fries, which literally tasted like soap. We ended up sending the curly fries back, and they gave us the utmost attitude after that. They managed to yell at us glaringly, demanding that we order more (my other friend already ordered a soup, so we thought it was fair). After we refused to order more, they talked about us RIGHT IN FRONT OF US, rudely conversing about how they can't believe we sent the fries back, how it was such as hassle for them. etc. Then they turned around and once again aggressively asked if we were positive we didn't want anything more.They also have this stupid rule that they don't take your card- you have to go up to the counter and pay yourself because it's too much of a hassle for them to walk to your table. I ended up tipping $1.50 for their non-existent service, which sucked the soul right out of me. I should have just given a big fat zero because they ended up asking for more tip, cursing at us as we walked out the door.Stay clear of this shit factory.",2,2,

Next time....... Pass,,,

Breakfast items are solid, but still a bit pricey.",1,,
186,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,2.0,12/5/2011,"I love diners, but this place was just meh. Sure, it meets all the criteria we equate with a traditional diner--a huge menu, bar seating positioned along side a flattop grill, Art-deco/pre-fabricated decor with lots of metal, etc. However, the food was just ok. I ordered the Texas Jumbo Burger, which was donned with a fried egg on top of the patty. To me, the meat didn't have much flavor, and it was overcooked. The bun and accompanying fried egg were okay, but, let's face it, it's the meat that makes the burger... and the meat was lackluster. As for sides, I ordered my burger with onion rings instead of fries, and these were just okay, too. They were seasoned well, but they were cold and not very crispy. Vinny was with me, and he ordered the Turkey Club and fries. He said the club was tasty... and, I tried his fries, which, I admit were good. In fact, I wish I had ordered the fries with my burger instead of the onion rings. Go figure.So, the big question is: Would I go back? Well, possibly. It's a very convenient spot, and, that night, we happen to be heading to the Public Theatre nearby and were in a hurry. Would I order a burger again? Definitely not. I'd look through Yelp! reviews and see what items others found to be acceptable.",1,,

Yeah right.My boyfriend got the burger, which he said was good (not great) and like a fool I ordered the cobb salad. I know, I know, who orders a salad a place like this? I did, and it was not good. Overpriced and filled with bell peppers. Who puts bell peppers in a cobb salad? Just awful.",,,

After walking for a bit, I decided to stop here for a quick bite. I had a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries. The staff looked like they had been there since the restaurant opened, which was awesome. The burger was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked. The fries were steak fries and they were good.  It was perfect example of what I have always envisioned a NY diner to be like.",,,

The prices aren't too great, considering the quality and the portions they range on the pricey side. But what can you expect from a 24 hour diner that's in a really high rent location. I will say I was unimpressed by the service. I went with 4 other friends and despite writing our order down, he still messed up one of our orders. They were also really bad with getting our check (we had to ask for it twice) but this may have been due to a lunch rush. Either way, it's not the best diner but it's not the worst either. I'll probably come back again sometime in the future.",,,
