0,Mark T.,"Charlotte, NC",12,326,903,5.0,10/30/2018,"Ate dinner here recently and such a surprising experience.  It's somewhat off the beaten path and feels like a dive bar almost as you approach, yielding an enormous flashing Gallagher's Bar sign out front.  Quite the deception.  When you walk up, you're greeted by a cold room with slab after slab of beautifully aged meats.  You walk in, and greeted by a very well mannered and dressed maître d.  Inside has an upscale feel, with a very casual ambiance -jeans and a tee causal, yet waiters are dressed for five stars.  There was a mixed bag of individuals from families with kids, businessmen to tourists and the lone diner (myself).The food was absolutely incredible.  They started off with a fresh variety of breaks which were out of this world --literally right out of the Oven.  I had their ribeye steak with a loaded baked potato.  The steak was fabulous and cooked to perfection.  The baked potato was good, though the flavor from the steak didn't do it any favors.  The meal was served with a house made, tomato-based steak sauce which was outstanding.  I actually didn't even need it with the steak, yet I demolished it anyway because it was that good.  I finished up -somehow- with their chocolate layer cake.  Now my idea of a chocolate cake is where a normal person takes two bites and pushes away the plate because it's too rich.  This wasn't that, though it was delicious.  If you like chocolate cake but not too rich, this is definitely your choice.  The service was incredible.  Consistently, but just in time served by two waiters.  They were friendly, helpful and extremely polite.  This spot was a great experience and food just amazing.  The prices I felt were very reasonable, and especially for New York.  Highly recommend!",2,,
1,Matthew L.,"Gainesville, FL",1086,500,1341,4.0,11/15/2018,"Ate at Gallaghers recently and the food was really good! I would say it was for sure not the best steak house I have ever been to, but for what we got it was very good.  We made a reservation the day of and got the time we wanted. We arrived about 20 minutes early and our table was ready for us. We were seated very close to other people at the restaurant but it was not bad. We thought by the pictures online this place would be a little more classy, but it wan not. People were wearing tee shirts and other not dressy clothing here. Do not worry about the dress code, no one follows it.  We started out with Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and they tasted amazing! They were big and plump. They came with cocktail sauce and we added some tarter sauce.  Our next course was soup! I got the Lobster Bisque and my friend got the French Onion Soup. The lobster bisque was very underwhelming. The soup could have used more salt and flavor in it. It was just okay.  For the main dinner we each got steak. My friend received the ribeye and I got the Filet. The filet was slightly overcooked and was not packed with flavor. The ribeye my friend got she said was good, but again not the best she has ever had.  The sides here are huge! We got the mushrooms and a loaded baked potato for the sides and they were huge and good. We both did not finish our meals and I think the waiters were annoyed we did not want to take them with us, but it was too much food and we wanted to go a few other places while in town.  Overall an expensive but good place to go out at. It was right in Time Square which was nice! If your going to a show, I would recommend going here, but on my next visit to the city I will try something better.",6,,2
2,Tayler F.,"New York, NY",2,11,27,3.0,11/14/2018,"Had a delicious meal at Gallaghers. For appetizers we ordered the shrimp & lobster dumplings and the burrata with coal-fired peppers. Both were delicious, especially the burrata. For my meal I had the filet mignon with the blue cheese crust. It was very tasty and perfectly cooked, I ordered it rare. I have dined at many of the popular steakhouses in Manhattan. Although we had a really nice meal and I do not have any complaints about the food, I wouldn't say that Gallagher's stood out in my mind compared to any of the other steakhouses I've been to. You will usually get a great steak at any of the high end steakhouses in Manhattan, but the overall experience is usually what determines if I will return. Unfortunately, I most likely will not be returning to Gallagher's. We sat upstairs in a separate room that almost seemed like it was where they placed all of the misfits that were not suitable for the main dining room, which we had a laugh at. It ended up being nicer as the room is much quieter than the main dining room. We had an adorable elderly man as our waiter who was very attentive and full of recommendations. What turned me off the most about Gallagher's was our experience before being seated. We arrived 5 minutes early for our 7PM reservation on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a short wait while our table was being prepared. After waiting for 10-15 minutes we inquired on the status of our table, because several other parties had walked in after us and been seated. We were told the table was not ready so we decided to get a drink at the bar. I will spare the details in hopes of not turning this into an essay, but the overall vibe we received from both the host and the bartender was, for lack of a better word, pretentious. It put a bad taste in my mouth and although we had a great meal, I would rather dine somewhere, such as Club-A steakhouse, where from the second I walked in the door we had a really great experience. If it weren't for the host & bartender and 30 minute wait time, when we had a reservation, I would have given this 4 stars.",,,

4,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2208,8237,3.0,11/6/2018,"Had dinner with a buddy here and really enjoyed the food and the service.  This is a steakhouse so it's pretty loud and there is plenty of testosterone floating around but it's not as bad as some of the other steakhouses in midtown.Service is great from start to finish.  Because we were having steak, we didn't order any appetizers.  I had the sliced sirloin which was awesome, but it was so much I had to take a doggy bag.  We also had onion rings which are exceptionally delicious and the twice baked potatoes, which were also great.  For dessert, we had key lime pie and pecan pie.  Key lime was just okay but pecan was very good.I had to ding some stars off for the drinks, however.  I started with the house old fashioned, which sounded promising with a blend of bourbon and rye but when I got it, all I could taste was lemon.  Also, none of the bourbon or rye really came through and there was no sweetness at all.   It tasted a bit like those canned iced teas with lemon flavor. Thinking that may have been a fluke, I ordered a bourbon old fashioned with Buffalo Trace.  Again, the lemon was overwhelming and I really couldn't taste the flavor of the bourbon.  It had that canned iced tea taste.  Thinking it might be the lemon, I ordered another one and requested no lemon.  That was marginally better, but still no bourbon flavor coming through.  I don't know what their deal was but I would not order anything bourbon-related there again.  My friend's Tito's with a twist was fine.Overall, a decent place and prices aren't too crazy considering this is midtown.  Go for the steak, but not the bourbon.",11,3,8
5,Gabriella S.,"Arlington, VA",133,98,615,5.0,10/29/2018,"What an awesome experience! From walking in and seeing the awesome meat locker to enjoying the final bites at dessert this was a classic steakhouse experience with excellent service and excellent steaks. Mr. Poll has done a great job making Gallaghers a great place for a group dinner. Went here to celebrate a fun weekend with friends and the service was great. We ordered family style some cocktails, appetizers, salads, steaks, sides and even desserts. I had an extra dirty martini and it was perfectly prepared. The tomato and feta salad was just the right start to our meal, fresh with great flavor and not at all over dressed. I also really enjoyed the calamari, which was not at all chewy and had a really nice breading, clearly high quality seafood.I shared a bone-in filet that was super juicy and cooked exactly to my liking, medium rare. My favorite side was the loaded baked potato and the creamed spinach which was super flavorful. Also, the hash browns and onion rings were amazing! For dessert we went with the cheesecake and apple pie, both excellent and a decadent way to end our already great meal!",,,1
6,David E.,"Queens, NY",25,483,942,4.0,9/9/2018,"A classic Manhattan steakhouse that is high on ambience and a sense of history.Seeing the raw meat as you walk in and then watching it be cooked in the kitchen through the transparent window is a nice touch. In a similar mould of Keens and Strip House this steakhouse is worth at least one visit. The music is great, the food is good and the wine is okay.One item I'd not order again is their mushrooms. Also, their Porterhouse is huge (not a negative) and one can feed two people.",1,1,1
7,Anjeline R.,"San Jose, CA",173,88,80,5.0,9/7/2018,"My bf and I got vouchers so we decided to go here. Boy was it a WONDERFUL DECISION! The service was good (it was a bit weird to have two servers) but the food took the cake. Apps: half dozen oysters and crab cake. WOW. get the east coast oysters. They're incredible! Very fresh and I'm salivating just typing this out!! The crab cake is only one but it was a good piece to share for two. Such fresh crab and delicious flavors! Entrees and sides: two 14 oz filet mignons. One with the bone marrow crust and the other with the pepper crust. I got the bone marrow crust and if you love bone marrow look no further. It was absolutely mouth watering! I thought I was going to pass out from the flavors. It was also my first steak in over a year so maybe that had to do with it but the steaks were just SO PERFECT. I had mine cooked to medium and it was stunning. Our sides were creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. WARNING- the sides are HUGE. literally enough for 4 so be careful! We couldn't finish our sides. They were both so delicious I almost forced myself to eat it all! Glad I wore my stretch jeans that night. The ambience was lovely, music wasn't too loud, such a classy joint. Overall it was such a wonderful place to have our final date night before going back to long distance. Highly suggest checking this place out if you have time and money to spare!",2,,
8,Song P.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",70,17,5,3.0,11/18/2018,"3.5. Came on friday night at around 10:45. The place was still packed. We ordered the rib steak with sides of brussels sprouts and mashed sweet potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly to medium which was what we requested. The chargrilled flavor came through. The brussels sprouts were not crispy. Won't get it next time. The mashed yam was good. Service was awesome. 4 stars for the food and service, 2 for the price. Way too expensive for what you're getting. And the old white people in the restaurant kept staring at us, which was so strange...I don't think we will come back given all other awesome steak houses in town.",,,
9,Joseph M.,"Queens, NY",144,103,151,4.0,9/7/2018,"I came to Gallagher's steakhouse during a weekday. Overall the experience was well worth the price. When you first walk into the steakhouse on your left you can see the room where they keep the aging steak. We decided to go with the lunch special ($29) For appetizer, I had the Caesar Salad. It was the perfect amount.For entree, I had the 10ounce filet mignon (an addition $10) it was pretty solid especially with the steak sauce. For dessert, the New York cheesecake is a must try. It was so amazing . The waiter was amazing even had a helper with him at all times. Will definitely go back for a special dinner like an anniversary or birthday.",,,
10,Alex H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1086,188,139,1.0,8/3/2018,"Very disappointing experience at Gallaghers for my dinner in New York with my father, I've been to many different steakhouses but this one was offensive and un-accommodating.I get there a tad early and the maitre de said that my pop wasn't there yet, so I went to the bar for a drink.  The bartender was brisk and not very personable, when I asked for my favorite whiskey they did not have it, and when my dad said Coors Light he gave him a shade stare, like dude who are you to judge, the guy doesn't like coors light, just get him what he likes. The drinks were not that good either.Then afterwards, we move to the dining room because he's hungry and we meet the server, an older gentleman, and look over the menu.  The maitre de comes over and says it's policy that I can't wear my hat in the dining room.  Um, excuse me, in my religion we must keep our heads covered at all times.  I wasn't wearing a keepah or anything but, it's a lil ridiculous that this is a rule. Its archaic and old school. Wakeup, its 2018. If people are paying for it, they should do/wear what they want.Next thing, we get to ordering our steaks. My dad wanted his steak cooked one way, and the waiter literally said to him ""The chef will get mad, he doesn't want to cook it that way, we'll see what he can do"". Listen man, again, this is a restaurant, you don't tell the customers how to eat/cook their meals. If they want it that way, they get it that way, and you don't judge. It was ridiculous.Food comes, I got a Filet Mignon and some Spinach. The steak was whatever, nothing to write home about or really that good. For my dad they gave it to him RARE.  He was pissed, and told the manager about the whole experience. He was doing his best to accommodate, but overall this place is just rude, boogie, and not worth your time.There are dozens of other steakhouses in the city that are worth a trip. This spot. Should go the way of history, close, and be forgotten with their attitude, service, and dismal experience.  1 star.",5,5,
11,Sara W.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",156,71,97,2.0,8/12/2018,"Let me just say l walked in here without high hope. But how bad can an experience be to still leave disappointed? From the start it was unpleasant when we had to ask for the menu after 10 mins of being seated.The waiters were in no mood to serve us in a pleasant or professional manner.The soup of the day - New England Clam Chowder was mediocre. Well seasoned but nothing phenomenal.The French Onion Soup was just ordinary, probably much better elsewhere in walking distance.The 10 oz. Filet Mignon came out well overcooked, quite past the doneness of medium when ordered medium rare. We had it taken back to have it come back out completely rare. With an obvious change of attitude of the waiters when the manager showed up on our side of the restaurant, the waiters came back so apologetic. The manager decided he would take off $10 from our tab as courtesy. Under appreciation, I am rating this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1. I could see that the manager was trying to brighten up our experience but unfortunately, the damage was already done.Not to mention a steakhouse that does not know how to control the doneness of their meat, they need far better training or supervision of their waiters. The little comments and looks on their faces are far from professional and plain out rude.This is NYC. There are countless steakhouses here with great food, service and ambiance.",1,,
12,Stacy K.,"Oceanside, NY",288,181,186,5.0,7/1/2018,"A true 5-star steakhouse. From the seating by the host to our servers (Ceasar and Juan) to the managers who check-ed in to see that our experience was wonderful (Lawrence) we have to say this was a truly great dinner. We started the breads and butter, which had a touch of sea salt to make the taste even better. Then we continued with clams oreganata, and then a sirloin and a rib-eye steak, with sides of corn off the cob and mac and cheese. The steaks were great, and the steak sauce (a Gallagher secret) was a great compliment to the meal. The dessert was a birthday raspberry chocolate cake, and a large cup of pressed tea -- and a espresso martini, which my hubby says is the best drink he has ever had (photo to follow so you can see what this lovely drink looked like). The meal was great but truly the service was outstanding. The recommendations by the waiters was spot on. The kindness of the waitstaff made our meal comfortable and enjoyable. We appreciate a place where you are not rushed, but that will get you finished in time for a show if you are seeing one. We also appreciate a waitstaff that takes the time to talk to the patrons and make recommendations that make sense. We have visited a lot of restaurants in Manhattan, and there are a lot of choices in the Theatre district. Gallaghers Steakhouse is now in our top 5 places to return to. We see why for over 90 years this has been a NYC staple.",4,,

Rib Steak med.  Came out perfectly.  The food here is geat.HOWEVER,Service was terrible.  From the very beginning.

15,Katrina C.,"San Jose, CA",329,438,571,4.0,5/27/2018,"I had a nice dinner with my boyfriend at Gallaghers after catching a late Broadway show. During the intermission, we took a chance and called Gallaghers to see if they could take a last minute reservation around 9:45pm. Luckily, someone had cancelled their 10pm reservation just before we called, so we took it. We showed up about 15 min. before 10, but the maitre d' was able to get us a table in the next 5 min.The restaurant is beautiful, well lit, and had a nice ambiance. With the Sinatra and big band playing in the background, it reminded me of an Italian restaurant from back home. Overall customer service was great - From the awesome maitre d' who was super accommodating to our head waiter who was friendly, personable, and very attentive. Loved the food. We started with a split wedge that came with a thick cut of tomato, chunks of blue cheese, and bacon pieces. Typically a wedge salad comes with blue cheese dressing, but something about the fat chunks of real blue cheese that Gallaghers uses took this salad to the next level. My boyfriend ordered a rib eye, and I got a prime rib. My prime rib was cooked to medium rare perfection, and I certainly preferred it over my boyfriend's steak. We also ordered a couple of rich sides. The Mac and cheese wasn't bad, but the creamed spinach was the best I've had at a steakhouse so far. The horseradish cream paired nicely with my prime rib, but it wasn't as spicy as I normally like it. The Gallaghers house sauce is BOMB! You can definitely get that it's tomato based but had such a unique flavor. It tasted great paired with my prime rib as well.",5,,5
16,Edward R.,"Monroe Township, NJ",79,250,414,5.0,5/6/2018,"A excellent lunch!Table for 6 right by the rare wine and liquor room with a commanding view of the main dining room and bar. Gallaghers impressed with it's recent remodel......Dark woods, deep cordovan colored banquettes, more than adequate space between tables, expansive bar and that amazing aging room upon entering.Appetizers were a wonderfully rich and boozy French onion soup, smooth, creamy and sensual Lobster bisque and of course the thick cut bacon with a sweet, salty sugar glaze.The 28 day aged Porterhouse arrived.....all 4 of them, perfectly medium rare with nice charred ends, sides of mashed potatoes,mushrooms,creamed spinach,grilled asparagus and horse radish all quite good but on to the star of the show......The steak.The Porterhouse was soft but not too soft with a great mouth feel and just that little bit of funky blue cheese background that comes with a dry aged steak, with just a tiny dab of creamed horseradish the meat really impressed. The charred ends, fatty and delicious with just the right amount of seasoning was to fight over and I can't wait to attack those bones in the privacy of my own home....isn't going to be pretty but most assuredly tasty.Dessert was a crumbly blueberry cake with a tart berry sauce and vanilla ice cream, a wonderfully sweet Banana cream pie and a chocolate cake after our very attentive and professional server, Nicky, overheard us say it was a birthday lunch for my wife's niece. Thank You Nicky!This was one of the best meals I've had in a steakhouse in awhile and I've had quite a few over the years. The venue was quintessential NYC steakhouse, the service was seamless, professional, friendly and unrushed, the steak was excellent and the cost, while not inexpensive, was very fair IMHO.Thank you Gallaghers.....you did well, very well.",6,2,7

Food is good, staff wasn't. First the hostess straight just looked like he didn't want to be there. After being seated the waiter asks us if we would like to see the menu..... why wouldn't we want to see the menu? We also had to ask for the wine menu, I would have expected them to offer us both menus without asking. The staff didn't seem professional at all.Filet Mignon was delicious and cooked to perfection. However the sides were quite disappointing. I wish the mash potato had a little more flavor and the spinach was nothing but average. Not sure if i'll be back here.",1,,

19,Evon L.,"Portland, OR",75,5,16,1.0,8/9/2018,"Poor service and food quality. The whole experience would have been better had the waiter not been so defensive and arrogant at the end. We ordered 2 New York Sirloin steak, one filet mignon, one Rib Eye steak with bone and a grilled salmon. We were very disappointed as the New York steak and the filet mignon were very tough and chewy! We honestly told a staff who worked there how we felt about the steak and he was very nice about it and asked if we would like to change it. However, we felt that we wouldn't be able to finish the steak and did not want to waste the food. Hence, we respectfully declined his offer. After the meal, we were given a complimentary fruit platter. However, we found mouldy blueberries in it and since it was complimentary, we weren't too concerned about the spoiled fruit. But when the waiter came to clean the table, I told him about the mouldy blueberries as a gesture of kindness for other guests who might receive the fruits. I think this is meant to be a joke but I'm not sure, he replied ""this is what you get for trying to do something nice!"" At that time, I took it as a joke and didn't think much of it. I then went to the restroom afterwards and I met the waiter on the way back from the ladies' room to my table. He stopped me and explained that he sent a fruit platter to our table because we weren't satisfied with the quality of the steaks. It seemed to me that he was very defensive about serving mouldy blueberries to us, and tried to justify it by saying that the restaurant was simply trying to do sth nice for us. In that case, I would rather not have them served me mouldy blueberries in the first place. It would have been nice and would have left the night at a good note had he not been so arrogant and felt the need to justify putting mouldy fruits on our table. I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and very unhappy with how he handled the situation. Poor customer service and attitude overall, and ruined his initial good impression on us. The food we ordered did not meet the standards of the price we were paying, even though we saw Gallagher's had received decent reviews. In our experience at Gallagher's we received poor quality food and terrible service! We did not receive an apology during this event. Too bad I forgot our waiter's name! Please be wary before going to this restaurant. I have attached a photo of the mouldy blueberries below.",,2,

23,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,2/10/2018,"I came here with a group of friends to celebrate my belated birthday dinner. My friend who is a regular at the restaurant made the reservations so​ that process was seamless. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the host. We were seated at a round table towards the middle of the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant was posh, sprawling and supremely​ comfortable and inviting. So much so that we ended up staying until midnight! There were plush red seats and photographs of celebrities who have visited Gallaghers all over the brown walls. We were served complimentary bread and salted butter. There were 2 different kinds of bread: A soft, slightly sweet loaf and the other was of the savory variety with sesame seed crust. There were several specials tonight, including the Surf and Turf (lobster and filet mignon), fried calamari, green bean salad and cauliflower appetizer. I was trying to decide between lamb chops or the filet mignon. Ultimately, up ordering the Surf and Turf, as well as calamari and french fries to share. My friends also ordered the following sides: Mac and Cheese, Broccoli Rabe, Mushroom, Broccoli, and Creamed Spinach. The calamari came first and I was not impressed. It wasn't crispy enough for me and was a bit bland. In retrospect, I think the green bean salad with bacon would have been better. Then the rest of the sides came out and my Surf & Turf came with a large bowl of warm melted butter. The lobster was delicious... Nice and tender with great flavor and wonderful seasoning. The filet mignon I asked for medium well but it definitely was well done, with the outer part being slightly charred. It was tasty ​but was a bit dry and tough. Also, I would have liked some sauce to go with it. Out of the sides, I really enjoyed the french fries and mac & cheese. The fries were perfectly crispy and full of amazing potato flavor. The mac and cheese had bread crumbs on top. It was extremely creamy, cheesy, gooey and the cheese was well blended with the macaroni. The mushroom and broccoli rabe were also good and quite fresh. The broccoli came in huge chunks and could have been a bit softer. When it was time for dessert, the restaurant servers came out with an adorable mini individual chocolate cake with a pink (my favorite color!) candle in it and sang Happy Birthday for me. The cake was absolutely delectable! It was covered with light brown chocolate frosting with darker chocolate dots around the rim. There were multiple layers and I detected a taste of raspberry, which was a nice touch. The chocolate frosting was rich, luscious and sweet, while the cake itself was velvety and moist. Our waiter, Rick was awesome. He catered to all of our needs with grace and ease. When it came time for the bill, each of us got separate checks. My friends all had a lovely experience and I certainly want to come back but it's a little on the expensive side so I won't be making regular appearances.",20,8,12

26,Paul T.,"Bessemer, AL",57,62,86,5.0,7/6/2018,"On my last night in NYC, our daughter booked a steak place and she couldn't have picked a better one. The historic (over 70 years) restaurant has had a million dollar make over. Several of the waiters have served there 30+ years. Although our waiter, Adam, has only worked at the restaurant for three years, he handled us like an old pro. I kept it simple with a filet mignon, medium served with mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly with a good crust on top. The mashed potatoes were creamy. For dessert I ordered the cream brûlée'. The top cracked perfectly and the rest was just heaven. If you want a great steak with great service, look no further than Gallagher's.",2,,

We went here because we were seeing a play across the street at it seems convenient and looked awesome inside. The ambiance is wonderful and I would recommend evening attire for ladies or a suit for men. I had a Manhattan drink and felt just like Don Draper. Service was all male staff and they were impeccable and polite. We split a gigantic filet mignon, potatoes and salad. Everything was perfection. I would certainly come back and we're aren't even the hoity toity types. It's a classy joint, but not stuffy. We just enjoy good food and good  atmosphere. Some dork in an earlier post said he was offended when they asked him to remove hit Mets baseball cap.

29,Trent T.,"Nutley, NJ",42,156,389,2.0,1/28/2018,"I was looking forward to attending Gallagher's all week. We try to cross off a couple restaurants every time RW comes around, and this time it was Gallagher's turn.The interior is quite nice and the meat locker is pure picture bait. The staff made us wait an additional 20 minutes to be seated, which was no big deal as we were a party of 5. The tables are a little close together and overall it felt somewhat stuffy once seated. After being seated, it took nearly another 10 minutes until we were even acknowledged. The gentleman dropped the menus off and did not return for some time. I am not sure if this was because we were there for RW and he assumed we would not be a large tip table.Unfortunately, this would be the theme throughout the rest of the evening. Never in my life have I felt so insignificant and utterly blown off by a waiter let alone at what I assumed to be a top steakhouse in NYC. We were never checked in on again for another 45 minutes. The entrees came, and one was forgotten making us all wait longer in order to begin eating. I cannot stress Just how disappointed we were for the duration of the meal for how our table was treated.Finally we got to the good stuff. At this point, it could have been the best steak I ever had in my life and I would have still had a sour taste in my mouth. But not even the meat met my expectations. The filet was somewhat tough, and just not nearly up to par. Not that we could have complained about anything being our waiter had no interest in taking care of our table. The sides (hash brown, onion rings) were great, but unfortunately that just doesn't cut it. The waiter had to be reminded to bring us the food we asked to be packed, we were honestly just going to leave it at that point. Such poor, disappointing service ruined this spot. Gallagher's, step your game up.",4,1,2
30,Scott F.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,11/13/2018,"What a letdown. Cool looking old space with an awesome meat window but the dining experience was mediocre across the board. Cocktails were the highlight. Their signature old fashioned was excellent. Their bacon appetizer was also very nice - a bit different than Luger/ Wolfgang. Everything else was a train wreck and we left a full steak for 6 uneaten on the table.  First complaint - someone ordered a dirty martini and it came red. Three times. Sweet vermouth in a gin martini is amateur. Not understanding and messing it up 2 more times is just sad. Second complaint - nothing came cooked at the requested temperature. Ordered lamb chops rare, got medium well. Ordered steak medium rare, got blue.  They were gracious enough to bring us new steaks (can't refire a steak once sliced).  Even the new steak disappointed. Left it. Third complaint - the food just wasn't very good.  The lobster in the seafood tower had a coating of white slime on it. The steaks were all dry and had a funny aftertaste - maybe it was the wood. Skipped dessert and won't go back. Wolfgang's near the port authority is a much better choice in that neighborhood. Or Palm West.  Avoid this dated tourist trap.",,,
31,Daniel G.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1191,160,211,5.0,6/20/2018,"We went to see ""Mean Girls"" at the August Wilson Theatre and wanted dinner after. We saw a Cuban restaurant across the street and walked over. Once across the street we got into a match of 'what do you want to eat'. If you are in a relationship, you know how annoying that is. As we walked by the window with all the meat in the freezer the fight was over. If you are a meat lover, how can you resist. We walked in, but didn't have a reservation. We waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. We were immediately approached by Rick, the server. Let me tell you he was classic New Yorker; gruff voice, well mannered with an edge, even called Chris my boyfriend 'Boss'. I giggled. I did notice that he would address Chris more. I guess he looks like the boss at the table. (giggle)I started with a Caesar; romaine, garlic croutons, grana padano $13. The dressing was fresh, delicious. Salty from the anchovy, which I love. I ordered the Surf & Turf. Wonderful lobster tail with a thick piece of Filet Mignon (10oz). Medium rare. The most tender piece of meat I've ever tasted. And I've had a lot of meat in my life. (hold the jokes).As sides we got the Brussels Sprouts $12 and Cauliflower with curry, pine nuts and raisins. (special of the night) $12. For dessert we had Pecan Pie and NY Cheesecake, each for $12. I don't do dairy so I only took a small nibble of cheesecake, but it was so smooth. No ice cream on the Pecan Pie, but it looked delicious. Try it and let me know. Overall we had an amazing experience, we even chatted with the couple at the table next to us. We are planning on going back before we leave New York, hopefully we get Rick again!",3,1,1
32,Jim B.,"Nashua, NH",15,352,332,5.0,6/22/2018,"We really enjoyed our meal at Gallagher's. The building, service and food were all great. Since I had beef for lunch, I chose  the broiled swordfish with creamed spinach and baked potato for dinner. The others in my group had steaks. The fish was prepared perfectly and it was a huge piece. The side dishes were easily large enough for four people and they too were very tasty. I topped it off with a piece of key lime pie that was as big as Manhattan itself. We cut it into three pieces so everyone could have some. The restaurant was quite interesting. It was built in the early 1920s and Gallagher's has been operating continuously since then. There is dark wood everywhere and that was typical for Manhattan steak restaurants of that era. There are pictures of race horses back from the 1920s on all the walls. The restrooms are 1920s in design with modern plumbing.The wait staff is primarily men in black uniforms. The head waiter told me that open flames in restaurants is strictly prohibited by the NYC fire code, but they still found a way to cook the fish and steaks with the dark grilling lines. I will bookmark this restaurant for future trips.",2,,2

Flawless is the only way to describe the waitstaff. My wife had a 14 oz fillet cooked to perfection. I ordered the grilled tuna steak ""blue"" and it also was also perfect.

I highly recommended the banana cream pie, probably the best dessert I've ever had!  Only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because I ordered my steak med well, and when I got my steak it was med rare. I don't personally enjoy my steaks med rare and I sent it back to be refired and when I got it back it was well done not med well. I feel as if a steakhouse should know how to cook a steak properly.

Their original steak house was so savory I wish I could buy a bottle for myself.The dessert was great as well, I'm a sucker for cheesecake and theirs did not disappoint.

Service: Pretty attentive, knowledge and quick. Food: everything we had was pretty spot on but I have to point out a few items that we always order since our first visit - porterhouse - perfectly seasoned and cooked (I like mine medium rare) - prime rib (my friends fav- personally I like the porterhouse) - burrata - calamari (specials not on regular menu) - beef carpaccio - lyonnaise side is pretty damn good as is the hashbrown - blueberry cake (it's a special sometimes they have it sometimes they don't) Pro tips: if you want prime rib call to reserve as they do run out If you need a high chair call ahead to reserve as there is only one on the restaurant If you're celebrating a birthday like we did the birthday person gets their own personal chocolate mini cake it's quite delicious All in all by far a must visit steakhouse in NYC.",7,1,4

What is the worst is the management asking me what I wanted when I mentioned that it was over cooked! How can you do this! This was rude and unwarranted and truely I felt very embarrassed regarding the way they basically attracted me for telling them that the meat was over cooked. The bartender had the chef come out cut open my steak and it was clearly over cooked 50% of the meat. Then he basically pushed the plate back at me and said ""what do you want""? Why attack a client? Why question them how they wanted their meat cooked? It was a form of sarcasmat best.For a high end steakhouse the chef should know how to evenly cook a $50 fillet.Dissatisfied and insulted.",6,3,

I was fairly excited to visit this place, given its countless mentions in various steakhouse rankings. Our evening began well - we ordered a dozen oysters, burrata with peppers and wine from their tremendous selection to start. Oysters were excellent, burrata was delicious and the wine was outstanding - a dream start for any meal. We ordered the porterhouse next and that's when the wheels came off; when it arrived it wasn't the 'medium rare' that we expected - it was just 'rare', it had large chunks of un-rendered, un-eatable fat - extremely off putting, given that the one thing that you are proudly showing off on the window of your restaurant is the dry aged meat itself. Moving on, the ambience is okay and the service is neither here nor there. Overall, a disappointing experience.",,,

Updated review","The husband and I went out for dinner here and it was delicious! I got a 14oz filet minion, the cook was perfect, it was a melt in your mouth type of situation! My husband got a huge sirloin, again it was cooked perfectly and delicious! They also give you some type of house made sauce to dip your steak in and oh my god it made the steak so so good! The steak by itself was already really good so the sauce just blew our minds! Their bottles of wine are pretty pricey, many that are $100+. We also had broccoli rabe, mashed potatoes and the onion rings. All delicious. The service was great too. Seemed like the only people working their are older gentlemen, which is fine but now that I'm thinking of it, it's a little strange? Not that that would stop me from coming here.

The oysters were tasty, the crab cakes meaty, but the steaks were the feature with a simple charred beef flavor. Just plain good beef - not covered up. Absolutely wonderful meat.

My hubby and I took our 10 month old with us because we wanted a quality steakhouse but didn't have a sitter so we brought him along. Sat promptly with a high chair. We were there on Tuesday (3/6/18) around 4pm and the waiter seemed disgusted with us, most likely because we had our child in a more uppity steakhouse. He was very short with us and had an attitude as if he was trying to get the meal over with as quick as possible to get us out. I also work in the restaurant industry and I felt that we came at a decent time before the dinner rush with the baby (Even though the baby slept more than half of the time we were there!)Anyways, we ordered the Crab Cake appetizer which was ok.. too fishy but had a good sauce. Then had the Prime Rib, 14 oz Filet, Spinach, and Baked Potato family style.The entrees were to die for and that is what made the dinner so much better and outweighed the poor service.The server assistant was there to help us more than the server.

I wouldn't be surprised if the ""for two"" portion with accompaniments could provide a filling meal for three or even four. As it was, we had leftovers.Good drinks, too, and good service.

It came out to be fairly rare, so I had to ask to have it cooked a bit more. It came back somewhere between medium rare and medium. The steak itself, which should have had the most marbling of all the steaks, didn't actually have a lot of marbling (maybe it was just my cut). It therefore made the meat a bit tough and the chewing was a good jaw workout. The steak had a bit of a grainy texture to it as well. Not bad, not great. Just okay.The sides were excellent - mushrooms, lyonnaise, broccoli rabe, asparagus. Yum. Drinks were great - Old Fashioned great, and my friend got the New York Sour, which I normally wouldn't like with the egg white taste/texture, but it was pretty decent.I'd go back for drinks and sides.

Searched Yelp and this was one of the top places that came up. Had dinner on a weekday. Ordered porterhouse for two, sirloin, and two fillet mignons. All steaks were delicious and cooked just the way we requested. The mashed potatoes were just perfect. He'd the veal carpaccio for appetizer which was excellent.My only complaint is that one of the steaks had a few charred spots on its crust that tasted a bit bitter. My guess is it is a result of some flare ups on the grill. Not a big issue, but still you would expect more from s place like this. The servers are attentive and efficient, exactly what you would expect from a place like that. The entire dining experience is very pleasant.",5,,

The vibe that I've gotten while interacting with the staff is that they would almost rather not be bothered with my friend and I. The first time I came here,  I ordered the veal chop. It was covered in red sauce and cheese. Very tasty. The second time,  I ordered the jumbo lump crab cake,  and the shrimp and lobster appetizer. Something similar to gyoza. I cannot remember the name right now. But everything has been tasty. My friend ordered filet mignon once and another cut (I cannot remember) very good as well.

Everything else was downhill from there. Our waiter, Rick seem to have somewhere else he needed to be. I had to stop him three times from walking away from the table so that I could order appetizers and drinks. After we got our food which was undercooked. we never saw Rick again. They had a associate waiter handle our table who was nice but not very attentive. We ate our food and ended up leaving half of all of the sides on the table.

Two of us ordered medium, and one ordered medium rare.The two medium steaks were not the same, with my friend's being a more like medium well, or even well done in some parts. As for the friend who ordered medium rare, it came out in a rainbow of done-ness, from medium rare on the left side to blue on the right. I don't even know how the chef was able to achieve such a result. Maybe he cooked the steak vertically, but it was the first time in my life I've ever seen such a gradient of cooking on any piece of meat.Anyways, the proof is in the pudding (or the raw meat, in this case...)!

Not quite good for the business talk and you won't enjoy the environment around you. Also, I got the dirty plate and fork then I asked for the change. My server took so long. After 20 minutes waiting, I asked help from the food runner instead!!! The way to cook steak is pretty cool and professional but due to high volume of customers, you should expect the delay in every single things you requested except when you asked for the check. For the taste, steak is pretty awesome but the sides (ex. stir-fried onion) are too big, not proportional to the size of the steak!!!",1,,

I know this place is legendary, and a heavy hitter in the NY steakhouse scene, but saying this is the best steak i have ever had would be a lie, and lie i do not on Yelp. My boyfriend and I made reservations her via open table, so that was a breeze. We were here on no special occasion, more of a- just because lets treat ourselves. We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation because we knew we wanted to have a pre dinner drink at the bar. Checked in at the host station, and made our way over to the bar. We luckily saw a couple getting up so we grabbed those seats, otherwise the place was packed!The bartenders were moving at a lightning speed. Running circles around one another, grabbing different bottles. Both of our drinks we ordered were delicious and strong! As we sipped our drinks a glass was broken in the bar area- it happens. About 20 minutes later one of the hosts came over to let us know our table was ready.We had a great able for the evening. Great view to the open kitchen, yet it was also romantic and cozy, perfect for a date. We already knew what our main course was going to be- we studied the menu all week. We ordered our drinks, and this is where things got shotty. Our drinks took a while to come out. Diners that were seated after us had there drinks before ours.  Our server explained to us the long wait was because they could not find the certain whiskey my boyfriend requested...ugh ok whatever...We ordered our food for the evening. Started with the veal carpaccio app. It was a nice starter to a meat heavy meal. Very light and refreshing. I had the filet with the bone marrow. And he had the sirloin. We both agreed they were good, but we have had better. You could taste the smoke from the wood fire which was nice. But for the steaks being prime, aged, all that good stuff, it did not have that flavor that i was expecting, and tasted at other establishments. Our side of onion rings were good, i had to add salt to the creamed spinach. I would come back here for a drink at the bar for sure. Bar program is great, the steak just wasn't for me.",3,1,2

It came with a citrus ginger soy vinaigrette and it was amazing. My coworker's that had ordered the rib steak ended up asking for the sauce that came with the Grilled Tuna Steak.

I don't know what cook everyone else ordered, but looking around the table, not one was over medium rare. This chef knows what he's/she's doing!)

Updated review","I use to come here so often with my mother for our occasional steak dinners after work. Don't get me wrong the steak is good. But what is a restaurant without its atmosphere and Service. The moment I walked in to get a table the host, did not acknowledge us. I asked for a table and was waiting for one guest to arrive. I informed them that she was not joining us for dinner and will only be sitting. The host said we must still wait and when she arrives we will be seated. Once she got there 5mins later, we let the host know that the 3rd person arrived. He just completely ignored any eye contact and continued to help other people. I asked once more and he said ""Sorry You need to wait another 20mins."" And turned his face and contributed to ignore us. Service is a crucial part to any restaurant. Sometimes the food can be great and the people are bad. When you walk into a restaurant you not only look to eta good food but for the experience as well. Unfortunately I need to rate this negatively as the experience I received was terrible.",,,

I'm a very down to earth person, and I'm not necessarily the suit and tie guy, but I feel like anything less in this establishment is an insult. It's a beautiful building, with class and sophistication, and deserves to be treated as such. With that said, the food, again, is always perfect. The price is average for a great steakhouse, with a decent meal with no skimping for the people who really like to eat good food going for an average of 80-100 dollars a head(that's on a gluttony scale, I can never control myself here).I don't go often, but when I do, it's always an amazing experience.

The staff ushered us through a wonderfully curated experience. I loved the traditional steak house touches in the restaurant and the meat room.I started with the French Onion Soup after seeing pics in other reviews and it was delightful. The cheese was perfectly broiled and it reminded me of French Onion Soup I had in Paris in the Opera District. For my main course I had a petite filet mignon (pictured) cooked medium and it was delicious and cooked to absolute perfection. I had the brussel sprouts and onion rings as sides. The brussel sprouts were a bit bland for my liking but the onion rings were incredible. I loved the batter and they were cooked perfectly. I paired my meal with a glass of the Malbec and it was lovely. Would love to come back to this spot with my fiancé who is a big steak lover.

I expected the cheese to be more melted and elastic, but it was just chunky; boring to eat. As for my entree, I had the Rib Steak,  requested to be cooked medium, but received rare, so I had to send it back. It was cooked perfectly when I received it the second time around. The steak wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but it was still enjoyable to eat. Each bite melted in my mouth. It was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the Lemon Sorbet, NY Cheesecake, Chocolate Layered Cake, and Creme Brulee for the table. The Lemon Sorbet was refreshing to eat; perfect after a heavy dinner. The NY Cheesecake and Creme Brulee was tasty and delicious as expected. The Chocolate Layered Cake was humongous, but mediocre as it was a bit dry.The service was a little slow. I expected more from Gallaghers as an upscale steakhouse. Our waters were not refilled at a timely manner and our server hardly checked in on us. When I had to send the steak back, I had to flag someone down since our server was nowhere to be found. I've been to other steakhouses that would wait for each person to check if their steaks were cooked at the right temperature before departing. This was not the case at Gallaghers.Overall, I was not blown away with the service and food at Gallaghers, but it was a good experience.",,1,2

Desserts - I ordered NY cheesecake but I tried my friend's key lime pie and really enjoyed it. Key lime pie is highly recommended dessert Overall - great experience, we enjoyed our time there and the food. Will definitely come back",,,

Service at the bar was okay and can be a little slow since the bartender I had might have assumed I was there for a drink until a table was ready, but he should have asked. Anyways...The bone in ribeye was amazing. Cooked medium rare to perfection to allow the fat to melt and give the great flavor. Beautiful marbling throughout the cut. Wow. I've been to a few places, but this takes the gold (for now). The quality of meat this place offers is pretty great.",1,,1

Oysters were nice  and fresh.   The Blue cheese on the filet was so good and enhanced the steak.  The mashed taters were good but we turned them up a notch by adding some sour cream.  perfect.,1,,
126,Kelly P.,"Baltimore, MD",3,34,63,5.0,3/4/2018,"While visiting New York with two friends, we all decided at the last minute that a classic steakhouse had to be on the agenda. We had a reservation somewhere else for over a month, and got very lucky that we were able to get a reservation at Gallaghers about two hours before dinner service on a weekend. Everything about our experience was phenomenal. I was actually surprised to read some of the negative reviews about the service here, because that was the highlight of our evening. Our server was incredibly warm and attentive, and it seemed like there were 2 or 3 other servers waiting in the wings at all times to refill water, scrape crumbs, and flawlessly change out courses like clockwork. We have been to other high-end steakhouses in our home city, where we were left feeling very unwelcome and insignificant, but Gallaghers left us with the complete opposite feeling. My husband said it was the best service and best prime rib he has ever had in his life. My steak was equally delicious - perfectly cooked to medium rare, and great color on the outside. The sides, sautéed spinach (somehow the best, garlicky, fresh, spinach ever) and mashed potatoes perfectly rounded out the meal. We don't ever try to go to the same NYC restaurants twice, but we would definitely go back to Gallaghers. Thank you for such a lovely experience and for making out-of-town visitors feel so welcomed.",,,
127,Jack S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,153,46,3.0,8/31/2017,"Business dinner. Underwhelming food however service was excellent, hence the 3-stars, otherwise 2 stars...especially for the money. Our servers, Giovanni and Caesar were both very attentive and professional. Giovanni was the lead guy and had a good sense of humor. You could tell he'd been working there a long time yet he enjoyed his work and interacted well with the clientele. Food. 3 steaks, 2 were filets and 1 a bone-in sirloin. One filet was cooked perfectly (med-rare), one was overcooked (med, done med-well) and the sirloin was undercooked (ordered med but served med-rare).  All were under-seasoned. We ordered the recommended shrimp scampi appetizer (6 shrimp $42) and while the shrimp were truly jumbo they were also very tough and had far too much chew...disappointing. Three sides were fair but nothing signature. Price. $410 before tip. Total of 4 glasses of wine and two margaritas. Three sides and the other above mentioned items.  No dessert. For this meal, far too much.  I'd been here once before, years ago, and had a better experience but nothing to overcome being reminded ""been there done that"".  My client said he wouldn't complain since he wasn't paying, otherwise he would.",,,

133,Sam Y.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",9,2,1,2.0,12/13/2017,"I don't write reviews, but yesterday's conversation with Javier at this restaurant has really pushed me to write this review. My mother and mother-in-law were visiting New York and asked me to find a steakhouse close-by. After reading the reviews and looking at the online menu, I recommended to go to this restaurant. The online menu showed the price to be $51 2/3/4 for porterhouse. Although it was surprising to me, that it was so low for this cut, it did not say anything about per person. My mother and her companion do not speak enough English to comprehend everything said to them, but when they saw the recommended porterhouse they ordered it. When my mother called and said that they were charged $102, she called me and put me on the phone with Javier who apologized to me about confusion, however began to say, that although he did not hear the conversation between the customers and the server, he was insisting that the server told them that it was the price per person. Saying that it was a mistake and it will be fixed. There was no consistency in their menu information. I am attaching the screenshot of the menu online, which does not mention anything about per person price. Without further conversation, this person I spoke with, hung up the call, and did not show any good customer service, did not want to accept the fact that they made a mistake. Where is the time when the business did things to reach good customer satisfaction? Or to just simply accept the fact they made a mistake, misinformed the customer, and the customer paid twice more than it was expected? I am disappointed at the way it was handled. I give two stars, because I know the steaks are good, but it's not only about the food, it's about the experience. I will not be coming to this place. There are plenty other restaurants in NY that Care for their customers.",1,8,
134,Kelsea Z.,"Visalia, CA",227,207,35,5.0,1/12/2018,This is my favorite steakhouse in NYC. Not only was the food amazing but the waitstaff was phenomenal.Took my sister here when she came in from out of town.We shared oysters and the lobster cocktail. We all had steaks and split some sides. The steaks were cooked perfectly. Our waiter was very helpful in choosing wine pairings. We learned his life was studying to be a sommelier. I hope to visit one more time before I leave the city! Would recommend to anyone coming to NYC!,1,,
135,Sonia Mae B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",131,81,168,4.0,7/30/2017,"I went here for restaurant week during brunch & it was well worth the price since the menu is similar to dinner at half the price. I got the gazpacho with crab to start. I would have enjoyed this gazpacho soup a lot more if they didn't skimp on the crab meat. It was still good with the fresh ingredients and perfect for summer. My main course was the filet mignon, medium with the perfect amount of pink meat. I enjoyed the side veggies, but also would enjoy a potato side dish, like a side of frites. The highlight of my brunch was the key lime pie! It's a front runner to Two Little Red Hens bakery in UES. I equally find both pies stellar with their own unique lemon tang sweetness.",,,1
136,Andrew J.,"New York, NY",174,22,23,5.0,6/13/2017,"Came to this restaurant on a spur after a Friday night of happy hour drinks. There's no better decisions than randomly getting steaks. I came with my girlfriend and another friend, but none of us were dressed for the occasion. Very casual ware, but the host didn't bat an eye. I wouldn't suggest you do that also, but if you must have steak, it'll be okay. I was worried that we wouldn't be able to get a table with no reservation at 7:30 on a Friday, but we were sat right away. As soon as you walk in you can see all of the cuts dry aging in a big windowed room with fans blowing. Beautiful marbling was on each cut. We all ordered the ribeye steaks with a couple of sides.I ordered the steak medium rare. It came out perfectly cooked. Like perfectly, the texture and doneness was perfect, but in terms of flavoring it could have used just a bit more. That bit more was perfectly solved with the salt shaker. Just a couple dashes and it was the second best steak I had in NYC. Great steaks, great restaurant. Will go again!",3,,1

Chose this place for my birthday one year since I had tickets to see Wicked on Broadway later that night, and I needed to find a nearby steakhouse since it's my tradition to enjoy a delicious porterhouse steak every year to celebrate. Highlights:- Porterhouse steak was cooked to perfection - rare and soaked in its own savory juices.- Service was amazing and attentive. They recommended one of my now favorite red wines to pair with our steak and also delicious side orders. - Interior looks like most other steakhouses (very large but cozy with dimmed lighting and Ron Burgundy style rich mahogany), but at the entrance they have a rows and rows of all their fresh beef cuts on display. The most beautiful marbling of meat ever.",,,

Super helpful and friendly servers, Nick was our server. He is funny and also showed us where to have a good pizza. Talking about their steak: WOW! Is the only word I can say. We got prime rib (gotta order ahead of time), jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab, and bone in sirloin . All of them were so delicious that I am still craving for more.",,,1

141,Carmen L.,"New York, NY",8,226,2214,3.0,11/20/2016,"Packed even on a weekday. We went to his steakhouse on Wednesday. We waited in line for ten minutes just to check in. What's even frustrating is that a gentlemen skipped us and he was offer service first when apparently the host saw that we were patiently waiting in line. I mean I will not argue about it but it was unprofessional to be offer service first just because you know the customer. We were finally guided to our table. We were given the dinner menu. The waiter then asked us what can he start us out with?, I told him let's start out with water first. After he return to our table, he didn't even give us the drink menu. He automatically assumed that we didn't want to drink anything. We ordered the baked clams casino for starter, porterhouse for two for entrees, Mac&cheese and creamy spinach for the sides. The clams tasted great . The steak wasn't cooked to the temperature I wanted it to be, but the sauce was good. The spinach was too salty. I like the layer on top of the Mac, it was crunchy. Water was refilled every now and then. I guess they wanted us to leave quicker because I already saw new napkins and utensils set on the table next to us so that they can reset everything on our table. They kind of rush us out. They overlooked us on when we will sign that receipt. Service can be better.",2,1,

143,Frank M.,"Shelton, CT",0,4,0,2.0,8/1/2018,"What a difference a day makes.  After having dinner last night with a colleague where we had an amazing meal with amazing service, tonight was a disappointment.  Tonight, I brought another colleague for dinner, ahead of my reservation and decided to eat at a table near a bar area-same as night before.   Meal was amazing, and Brian the manager is a great guy.  However, once a party of nine guys sat next to us, we kept getting different servers who didn't know what we ordered or what we wanted.  Obviously, they made a decision on where to focus their service. A simple cappuccino order with dessert was ignored for 15 minutes until I reminded the last person who came to our table.  Needless to say, they never made it so I just cancelled it.  Overall, a great atmosphere and great food.  However, the inconsistency in service one night over another does not convince me to visit again.   At 150.00/per person dinner, my expectations are a little more, especially after seeing what they could do when properly focused/encouraged?There are too many great steakhouses in NYC to take another chance at this location.  Disappointing - as I wanted to love this place.",,,
144,Gerard R.,"Jersey City, NJ",204,75,9,3.0,7/15/2017,"Stopped in before a show. Solid throwback steakhouse. Close to Times Square and theaters. Think they have been in business almost 100 years. Inside real sharp looking  and they have a meat locker which every tourist stops to take a picture of. Pretty cool to look at would be even better if you could pick your own cut from there. Went with the veal rib chop which was really good. Split a few appetizers with the group (Burrata, Shrimp and Lobster Dumplings, Veal Carpaccio and Crab Cake), once again all good. With dinner we went with a bunch of sides and couldn't complain. All in all a solid steakhouse that's a good choice if your just in the area or looking for somewhere to eat before a show.",,,

I had a fillet mignon which i thought was alright but was not impressive. My husband had a sirloin which he thought was under seasoned.The wait staff are very attentive but we find them too attentive that a few of them kept intereupting our table and asked us the same questions that's been asked by the previous staff. Nevertheless the ambience in the restaurant is great. The meat locker is definitely picture worthy.,,,1

The wait staff Ryan and Melvyn were exceptional. The breads, Cesar salad were great and the French onion soup was to die for. Our main gripe was the sides. Cream of spinach had no cream, Brussels were ok and the mushrooms were very earthy chanterelles (which I liked but others in my party would have preferred button). Apple strudel a la mode was excellent. All in all a good steak house experience that would have been great if we had liked the flavor of the sides better.",,,

Couldn't hear the music over the clamor, so not excellent on the ambiance.Food and service were excellent and top rate. Bone in Ribeye Steak was done perfectly and my Dover Sole, boned tableside, was scrumptious, along with the twice baked yummy potato! As for value, it's NYC, so quite expensive!

I had made a reservation online same day and got very lucky as it was the only one left for the early evening. We were seated immediately. Our waiter was outstanding; friendly and personable and checked on us consistently. We were given bread and butter and ordered the calamari and baked clams for appetizers and 2 beers. The calamari was crispy but a little bland, the accompanying sauce was good and the clams were delicious. For dinner I got the Tomahawk for 1, hubby got the ribeye and we got a lobster tail, creamed spinach and twice baked potatoes for our sides. The steak was cooked perfectly but again, could have used some salt. The creamed spinach was very good and the baked potatoes were good as well.

The mac and cheese was creamy, and the lyonesse had a smoothness about it that was delectable. Of course, we had to try the creme brule and that was a highlight of the meal; the orange swirl added just the right amount of tanginess to tingle the taste buds, while the classic sweetness of the vanilla was the satisfying end of the meal.",,,

The bread they served was an excellent variety! The meal... my 13 year old and I both had filet. We both asked for medium and it came out perfect.

159,Michi S.,"Honolulu, HI",20,157,386,3.0,4/14/2017,"I had a dinner before a Broadway show here. Surely they attract a crowd due to their location and well-known dry aged steak, cured and stored right in the front of the restaurant. You can see the room through the front window. Their steaks have excellent fragrance and flavor! My guest enjoyed the steak so I was very satisfied. It's a real bummer because I would truly loved to give them a 4 star review, but I have to minus the star due to their unreliable service. His demeanor was so lovely and  seemed experienced but he got every order specification wrong and was never present! First, I asked for dressing on the side for our salad which he originally kindly responded to (we even had a quick conversation about it). Yet, the salad came mixed with loads of dressing. I also ordered two glasses of wine in the very beginning but it never came. We had to look for our waiter, tell another waiter, but then it never came again so I had to ask again after we ate our appetizers. The worst part was when our steak arrived. Our steak was rolled in and delivered on a cart by an unknown waiter. It sat their for at least 5-7 minutes without being served. I was originally confused whether or not it was our steak but our waiter was not even around so we couldn't ask. Sadly, our steak was served to us afterwards. My medium-rare steak was turning close to medium. Luckily, I had a few bites of my medium-rare steak and it was delicious. Towards the end of my meal, the steak had become medium. Very, very sad for 10 oz of $45+ slab of delicious meat. I didn't express my frustration on the spot because I was with a guest and was also heading to a show afterwards. Overall, my guest was happy...but I left wondering where else I could have taken my guest.

This is why I order filets to begin with, to avoid this very issue. The baked potato was dry and flavorless, despite being a loaded baked potato. If not for a good drink and a good slice of cheesecake, I would have given this place 1 star, but I will give it a little credit. Although I won't come back.",1,1,
163,Mickey G.,"Manhattan, NY",8,52,20,5.0,6/12/2018,Hate to give anyone 5 star but this steak house deserves it .   We sat at the bar as last minute decision . Chris the bartender made us feel at home . We started off on There  signature old fashioned  .  He recommended the dry aged sirloin with creamed spinach and onion rings .  They have a good wine selection can't remember the cab we had but was good .  This is a true New York experience with frank Sinatra playing in the back round .,,,
164,Nikolina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,130,179,2.0,11/17/2017,"Very disappointed. Found this place on google because of their great reviews and didn't get nothing as expected! I'm not trying to be mean person but the meal in general wasn't good at all. That should be a good steak house, instead we got some coals when ordered the meat! My husband ordered filet minion for $50 medium rare and couldn't even eat it because it was dry and over cooked/fried. My mother in law ordered tuna steak and it was better then any of our steaks! But how is it possible that fish were better then meat in the steak house!? And we payed $450 for 4 people. Very very disappointed. Wouldn't even thinking of coming back here. Like the food in general starting from appetizer to the deserts were 2~3 starts. The best thing is happened there was the company. At least we enjoyed each other, period.",,2,

The food: delicious, perfectly cooked sirloin (me) and filet mignon (my date). We shared the arugula and beet salad which was also delicious. So why not 5 stars? Sadly: the location. It is FULL of tourists in shorts and cameras and then when your meal is over there you are on the corner of 52nd and yikes.",,,

After being seated, the host returned to the table to ask my son to remove his bandana he wears due to a scalp condition. When I questioned the manager because there was nothing posted on their website regarding dress code, the manager walked me to the BACK left corner of the restaurant and showed me a 3x3 inch sign that had a "" no hats"" allowed symbol. When I said he was not wearing a hat he said he it includes anything on the head. The rest of the dinner the managers kept visiting our table and asking how we were enjoying our meal which only added insult to injury.

My other boys steak was blue/raw and tremendously fatty to the point it was inedible...  I couldn't cut it with the heavy duty steak knife.  Thin grainy raw membrane so tough & under cooked it couldn't be cut.  as a dad I switched with the Birthday boy and reluctantly & embarrassed mentioned and showed the atrocious waste to my waiter the manager offered a new steak late into the dinner.  They offered to take it off the bill.   I declined they removed the steak anyway.  The Desserts were amazing they even sent a complimentary fruit platter.   My complaint is why serve the kids a inferior thinner less quality steak but charge the same price?  We felt like it was a con on the kids... they asked ""is this a Kids menu"" ? That was the Tremendously disappointing event .  On what could have been / should have been an epic celebration it still was but it was deflated due to the choice of meats served to my 2 athletic carnivores.  Be ware I think they bait & switch kids shave 6 ounces here 6 ounces there.   Bad cuts to kids thinking what do they know.   PS I left hungry on steak full on DESSERT.  1st for me.

174,Eric Y.,"San Mateo, CA",333,705,1322,4.0,3/18/2017,"I was super excited to see a restaurant like this. I'm a big fan of dry aged beef, and have had a lot of dry aged beef at home. My local meat market where I live provide aging service and sell them at a a very reasonable price. Therefore the dry aged taste and texture is not unfamiliar to me. The pictures seen on yelp and the aging room told me that I had to give this place a chance. Immediately, I looked up OpenTable and they had reservations because of weather. We were stuck in New York on 3/14 due to severe weather warning, or should I say a March snowstorm. It was also a special day today, so I had to look for a place to eat. We arrived, told them we had a OpenTable reservation. They seated us immediately in the back of the restaurant, near the corner with a partial view of the kitchen. I questioned the host, ""How many lbs of steak is in the dry aged room?"" He responded with, ""I don't know in that factor, but I can tell you that we have around $250,000 worth of dry aged steak in that room."" My jaw totally dropped to the floor when I heard that. The main server was attentive and offered bread with menu right away. He told us the specials for the day and explained some details to us. I decided on the following:-Cesar Salad-52oz Dry Aged Tomahawk Cut (shared for 3 people). -Shrimp Scampi-Side order of baked spinach-Side order of sauteed mushrooms. I had a small request for the server. I wanted to take a picture of the Tomahawk raw before it hit the grill. He took me to back of the kitchen to fulfill my childish request =). The experience of going to the kitchen was awesome. I had the honor of smelling the dry aged aroma in the kitchen, like it was cut straight from the aging room. With all the excitement, I was left a little disappointed by the tomahawk. The serving wasn't presented so well. Wished they cut in front of us. The kitchen and second server didn't communicate too well either. The seat wasn't served too warm, it was lukewarm.. Yes, I understand you have to let it rest to cook through, but still.. The outer skin was too charred and we tasted too much of the burnt aftertaste. This also took away from the distinctive aged taste. I think the reason for this is because the cut was super thick, and we wanted it cooked to medium. It wasn't quite medium, but closer to medium rare. As for the other stuff.. Giant shrimps made to scampi style was great. Baked spinach was good. Sauteed Mushroom was just sauteed mushroom. 3.5, but rounded up to 4. The reason for this is because they did something for us during dinner.We celebrated a birthday that day. They gave us a cake, and did a quick happy birthday for our table. Thanks. Service - main guy for our table was super. Chatted with us, and was cheerful. The second guy who helped him wasn't as fun. Seemed like he was just there because it was a job. Didn't seem passionate.",4,3,2

The food was amazing. I ordered the lamp chops and they seem to just slide right off when I took a bite. My SO ordered the prime rib (med rare) and that was just as tasty.  The portion of the food was perfect. Also had cheesecake as dessert and it tasted like juniors cheesecake.

180,Karen R.,"New York, NY",541,131,115,4.0,5/15/2017,"Decent steakhouse in midtown. I came here for a Mother's Day lunch with my family and my boyfriend. They have a $29 lunch special which allows you to order an appetizer, entree and dessert  - it's a lot of food at a fair price! I ordered a Caesar salad, 10 oz filet mignon, and chocolate ice cream. As a table, we split a side order of asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was decent, but nothing really stood out to me. Since I became full during the second course, I ended up taking half of my filet mignon to go. My brother, who didn't order off the lunch special, snagged a creme brûlée during dessert. I was kinda jealous that wasn't an option for me. Although the lunch special offers a great deal, the menu can be a little limiting.Throughout the meal, the waiters were extremely attentive and friendly. A+ service / A- food",,,

Not one of the better steaks we've had in the city.I ordered the tuna steak medium rare. It was far too fatty and also, it was a huge, thick cut almost in the shape of a cube as opposed to the thinner cut most restaurants usually give. There was a lot of fat and crusting along the outside, which I didn't love. Wasn't able to finish, which never happens for me! Though I commend them on the large portions. We also got mushrooms for our side, which were really good! But definitely overpriced. I loved the Gallaghers sauce--not necessarily on the steak, but just in general. Will have to learn their recipe!Ultimately, wouldn't come back. A bit too expensive for less than average food.",,,

183,Sangduk S.,"College Park, MD",175,62,47,3.0,2/27/2018,"I thought I was at Ruth's Chris for a second. Despite the extravagant room where all the steaks are out for display in front of you as soon as you walk in, the rest of the experience was basically a pricier Morton's. The mac and cheese was probably my favorite dish of the evening. The wine selection was severely lacking, and even worse was the abysmal service. We had a reservation and got seated an annoying 20 minutes late. But the real offense of the night was yet to come. How dare you walk us to a table that's basically an intimate booth meant to seat 4 people and suggest that we sit there WHEN THERE'S ALREADY A COUPLE SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER THERE. What, should we just have had an impromptu double date with what appeared to be a new couple who clearly didn't know each other very well and most probably had just connected on tinder? The gaped mouth faces they made when our server walked us over to their table to suggest that we join them for their diarrhea fest of newfound love and empty promises was priceless. My girlfriend nearly had a seizure worth calling an ambulance for when she realized where the fuck our server was about to seat us. Luckily they had a bar style circular table with barstools available for us to sit at when they failed to make us make new friends with strangers at a steak house.Tldr, I'd tell them to fire all of the employees aged 65 and older but then they'd have no one left. Please, just go bankrupt and let your mummified excuses for servers go die a peaceful death instead of making them hobble sadly over to tables filled with young assholes who'll write reviews shitting on how old and debilitatingly slow the servers are.",4,11,2

Warm bread slices and Banana Bread.  For dinner, we tried their 14 oz Fillet Mignons and their cut Corn.  The steaks were awesome and the Corn was amazingly fresh.  For desert, we tried their Banana Cream Pies.....one of the best that I have ever eaten.  This was one of best meals that I have had in NY!  Loved the food, ambience, service and Frank Sinatra!  I will be back!  One of the finest NY Steakhouses throughout history!  It screams Suits, Steaks and Whiskey!",6,5,10

Manager was extraordinary. Mom's ribeye was rare instead of medium rare and my porterhouse was medium well instead of medium rare. Fixed appropriately but such a waste of good meat due to inexperienced or unfocused chef work. Honestly expected higher class treatment being the elite steakhouse in NY. Like pulling out of chair for a lady or at least my elderly mom. There was a coat check in but refused to take our shopping bags... which made seating for two very uncomfortable. When you don't mind spending money for an experience, atmosphere, and high quality food, it truly puts a damper on things when you have a rude server who doesn't have time to explain things to you. To the manager, thank you for making us feel welcome, from the southern grace of two Texas visitors. Because of you, we shall consider returning to visit your establishment.

First impression was meeting the Host, a gentleman,and I use that term loosely, who frowned upon our 20 minute early arrival, by telling us we could sit at the bar and wait there, problem was, the bar was already full, and there was no waiting area on this cold,rainy night, so we had to stand next to him for 20 minutes,no fun for either of us.I ordered the 14 oz Filet Mignon, cooked medium. After I cut off the first piece the rest was raw red !  I asked the waiter to have them make it well done (considering what they think ""Medium"" was.  I finished my two side dishes,and the bread before the steak reappeared. This along with only a choice of 3 Cabernets (by the glass) and "" Cain"" at $22 a glass, was nothing to write home about , it was a disappointing night on many levels.
