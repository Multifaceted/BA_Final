0,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",848,3176,11053,4.0,6/5/2018,"I honestly didn't know Fuku had expanded so much. Maybe that's why they ended up shuttering the original East Village location.Came to this one to have lunch with my brother in law. The menu here is pretty extensive. They have items like a chicken dip sandwich, chicken fingers, salad bowls, and of course, their signature sandwich that comes in like 8 different styles. For dinner, you can also get a whole chicken.I went with the chicken dip cuz I wanted to be a *little* healthier. I guess I forgot about the gravy. The chicken was grilled, supposedly with ginger seasoning (didn't get any of that), and came with the extreme hot sauce (which was as advertised). Pretty good, but I would go with the standard fried chicken sandwich next time.They share a bathroom in the hallway, which is dingy and smelly.Other than that, didn't seem to be much of a crowd compared to other lunch spots in the area like Dig Inn. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Time will tell, I guess.Pretty good amount of seating, including their standing room only tables that the original location was known for.",1,1,1
1,Teresa V.,"New York, NY",153,170,808,1.0,10/13/2018,"Maybe it's my fault for not going for their chicken sandwich or chicken tenders and instead going for their crispy kale salad, but I was more than disappointed with my meal and overall experience.Let's talk food first. One. My bowl handed to me looked like something an eight year old pulled together so no effort points there from the staff in terms of presentation. Two. There were three giant pieces of chicken, which I had to tear apart myself so no effort points there from the staff since they didn't take the time to tear them up themselves. Three. My bowl was drenched in sauce. Enough for the bottom of my bowl to feel damp so no points there since the staff doesn't even know how to estimate. And that meal was $15. I could have spent less than that at Just Salad, Chopt or Sweet Greens and would have left much more satisfied with my meal.Now service. I waited more than 30 minutes for my meal to find out they lost my order in their system. How? I could understand if you're a fresh new business but you have multiple locations opened now. Also, you make it up to your customer by literally ""throwing"" my meal together in 1-2 minutes. I would have rather you taken 5-10 minutes and given me something satisfying than rush it.",1,,1
2,Mich M.,"Manhattan, NY",24,93,684,1.0,9/13/2018,"I ordered a Knockout Sandwich. They gave me a Spicy Chicken Sandwich and charge me for a Knockout. Knockout is $9.50. Spicy Sandwich is $8. So this means they overcharged me. A Knockout comes with Kimchi and Knockout Sauce. My sandwich didn't have any of that. I asked them to add-on lettuce, pickled onion, and spicy cucumber. They added that but took the kimchi out. So my Knockout is not a Knockout anymore. It's a friggen Spicy Sandwich! Wth!Fuku is just another fried chicken fast food restaurant. I'm a fan of Momofuku Ssam Bar and Momofuku Nishi. Fuku is nothing like the two.",,,

We were there on two New Years Eves, at the US Open, indulged Wall Street, always ate secret menu items and even checked out the Vegas one when we got married there this year!!Sad to see the East Village location closed, but it was no wonder. Service, attitude, and food started to slowly decline on our last few visits and that same vibe has unfortunately carried over to Wall Street. The last straw was they wouldn't even honor my punch card that I was about to redeem for my last free sandwich!! Such a diss...End of an era~RIP OG Fuku);",,,
4,Dara C.,"New York, NY",4,47,76,4.0,4/16/2018,"Came here for an early lunch on a weekday and got here before the lunch rush came.  My order took a bit long, but probably because the kitchen was just starting up for lunch. I ordered:Koreano (Spicy Chicken Sandwich + daikon) - $9, loved the fried chicken and how the pickled daikon complemented the spicinessFuku Fries - $3, not sure what the seasoning was made out of but it tasted so good and made me feel nostalgic for some reason (haha)Definitely want to come back and try the Chimek!",2,,

The Chimek wasn't amazing but it was a great deal for the amount of food given. Our Chimek came with wings that were half habanero and half sweet & spicy which is normal for most Korean chicken wings spots. The chicken was juicy, tender, crispy and the sauce is like sweet and spicy. It also came with sides like fried pickles, tortilla wraps, kimchi and pickled daikon.",3,1,2
7,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10947,4.0,3/13/2018,"I came here purely because of the new 'MealPal' service I signed up for just the trial experience. Really worth checking out. I've actually never been to any of the Momofuku restaurants in the city or their desert places. There are so many now. But it has always been pretty high on the list. This is one of their more fast casual take-out spots. It's literally behind my office building and super convenient. Pre-ordered a sandwich and came in to the special 'mealpal' line. My meal was ready for me in seconds with a smile. I had the spicy chicken sandwich. On first observation it looks plain as hell. There's no sauce on the bun. No cheese. It's just chicken, pickles, and a potato bun. But this was seriously one of the best slabs of chicken I've had in my life. It was a thick juicy chunk that tasted almost like they de-boned an entire chicken thigh. The chicken batter was crunchy and amazing, perfect amount of heat and flavor and the warm potato bun was just everything with it all. If this is how everything else in the store tastes, then I highly recommend coming. But seriously, they do fried chicken justice.",4,,3
8,Dan E.,"Brooklyn, NY",208,45,23,4.0,8/31/2018,"The new standard in Chicken Sandwich.  Moist and crunchy, with a hint of spice.  The dark meat chicken pairs perfectly with pickles and soft potato roll.  I upgraded to the knockout, which adds a spicy sauce and slaw to the sandwich, a nice touch.",2,,1

10,Kathy V.,"Hercules, CA",958,731,3598,3.0,11/13/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I adore David Chang's cooking at Momofuku and Milk bar, but Fuku kind of made me feel some type of way which was average. It's ok but thier seasoned jalapeno fries was good.Maybe because I compared it to Shake Shacks spicy chicken sandwich or Bettys Bakesale? Or maybe I came on the wrong day. A tiny soggy part of my bread and the  crisp of the chicken wasnt that crispy. The hotness level was bare minimum. Maybe I'll give it another chance",16,15,15
11,Alexsis A.,"Bronx, NY",136,75,50,3.0,8/31/2018,"Okayyyy, I was sold by the Description and pics about comfort food being served here. And it did disappoint.  I will be a transparent as usual guys. The food was not amazing. The customer service was alright. The restaurant is pretty small. On to the taste of the food, it wasn't the best chicken tenders. They lacked flavor and were over cooked.  I ordered 2 orders of tenders and loaded fries with the cheese sauce on the side. The fries were delicious loaded with chives, bacon, and ranch sauce. The bacon was cooked to perfection....What was interesting was the card only payment option. The restaurant didn't accept cash and charged .50 for ranch dipping sauce. HOW DO I KNOW?! The cashier told me that I had re-swipe my card in order to get the sauce. I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH RESTAURANTS CHARGING FOR CONDIMENTS.",1,,
12,Ashley K.,"Philadelphia, PA",249,7,2,5.0,9/18/2018,"As a fellow Korean, I approve. The extremely spicy chicken sandwich is actually spicy! The bun was delicious, and the chicken to bun ratio was on point. Was worth every dollar and very filling. The place is well kept and everything was very clean and neat. The general manager was extremely accommodating and patient with all the customers, especially for people like me when I can't decide on what to eat. I ended up going for the spiciest chicken sandwich and the fries with cheese sauce. Probably the best fries I ever had. Good job David Chang and the general manager with great customer service. Will return very soon :)",,,
13,Stephanie D.,"New York, NY",830,341,44,5.0,5/6/2018,"I had Fuku for the first time at Coachella where it was deliciously tendor and so so savory. I immediately craved it when I flew back to NYC. A friend thinks that it's an evolved, better version of Chick-fil-a but it's best when it's fresh and piping hot. I postmated it one time and it came cold and dried up. Don't do that. Order it in the store and eat it as soon as possible.The fries are good too!",1,1,1
14,Justin L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,17,10,4.0,8/11/2018,"I honestly haven't ever tried any of the restaurants under the momofuku empire so this was my first time. It's a blessing that it was expensed by my former company because oh boy, I wouldn't have paid for this myself. Anyways, this is supposed to be a whole fried chicken with a bunch of extra condiments like pickles, daikon and sauces. To be honest, the chicken was very crunchy and tasty but it isn't what I would expect from Korean fried chicken. The reason I say this is because Korean fried chicken has very light breading so when I bit into this chicken and realized that the breading wasn't light, I was surprised. However this isn't to say that it wasn't a good meal. For the price of this meal though, I wouldn't buy it myself but if you feel the need to splurge on some fried chicken, this is something I would recommend!",1,,1
15,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1913,4.0,10/12/2017,"Fried Chicken FTW. Came here for an impromptu bday dinner with some friends. There's not much seating here, especially for a big group so I definitely wouldn't consider this a sit down restaurant. It's a quick lunch/dinner spot for sure. Fortunately for me and my friends, we were able to squeeze three tables to seat 6 people. We got an order of two chimek and had leftovers for sure. It took awhile for us to get our order but it was because all the chicken was freshly fried so we appreciated that. The amount of chicken you get is huge. The fried chicken was great. It had a mix of a dry (habenero) and a wet rub (sweet and spicy) on the chicken. Both were good, depending on your preferred flavor profile. You get savory and sweet. The chimek order also comes with plenty of pickles, fried pickles and onions, thin Asian like pancakes, kimchi and picked daikon. Everything was really good with the exception of the Asian like pancakes. It was pretty flavorless and didn't really add anything to the meal. I would skip that and stuff your face more of the fried pickles!Overall, a great try!",2,,4
16,Hanna T.,"New York, NY",7,60,568,5.0,5/5/2018,"I describe Fuku as Korean Chick-fil-a. Tastes a lot like chick-fil-a but uses dark meat instead and has a slightly spicy Korean kick to it. I love that it's on MealPal, I get it all the time. The Korean flavor makes it like comfort food for me, so I have to stop myself from having it more than once a week haha. It's near the waterfront so it makes it a great spot to pick up lunch and eat outside.",,,

Updated review","Guess David Chang is not involved in this sad place that claims they have ""chimek."" As my Korean guests said, ""you cook fried chicken like this in Korea you will get trashed."" Chicken was undercooked and dipped in way too much batter that felt like some weird hybrid of biscuits and donuts. Overpriced, pathetic, and gives chimek and Korean fried chicken..heck all fried chicken a bad bad name. Don't waste your calories he ......................................Update 9/8/18 - the owner of this location personally contacted me and offered to let me try Fuku again. Get an extra star for at least caring.",,,
18,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,2.0,2/18/2018,"I don't know why this place was so disappointing! The first time I tried Fuku I loved it but this time I was sorely disappointed.WAIT: Came on a random weeknight so there was no wait, the place wasn't that full either so we sat right away.ATMOSPHERE: It's not that spacious with about 3 tables to sit and then a wide area to order and wait for your food.  I imagine it's an area that gets a lot of lunch foot traffic and where you get to go orders.FOOD: Got the regular spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken dip sandwich.CHICKEN DIP SANDWICH - an interesting concept, it has white meat pulled/shredded chicken on a ciabatta type bread with pickled veggies and then a ginger/vinegar-y dipping sauce.  It was decent, not the best sandwich I've had but a good option for those that can't take spicy.SPICY CHICKEN SANDWICH - I tried a bit of my husbands and it wasn't  as good as the first Fuku we went to! It was stale, cold and almost like it was sitting out for a while.  For some reason it wasn't crispy or crunchy and the bread was meh.  Very disappointing! Maybe it's gone downhill or it depends on which location you go to or maybe I just got luck the first time.Overall, I'm not sure how I feel about Fuku anymore.  I might need to go back to the original location that I liked to try it again.",3,,
19,Judy F.,"Forest Hills, NY",154,369,205,3.0,2/4/2018,"Since I tried one food item, I give 3 stars. I bought the chicken tenders, to see what this craze is about. Maybe cuz I ordered it in person at 12:15, the tenders were just okay. I think they're cooked and kept in a warmer or something. A minute after placing and paying for my order, it was ready for me at the pick-up counter.Tenders are chicken tenderloins which I buy from the supermarket and cook often. Fuku's tenders are either breaded or battered, with seasonings. Taste was not mind-blowing. The ends and parts of outside of the chicken are dry and tough to chew, despite the breading or batter. Similar to what happens with I saute tenders in a stainless steel pan. You can buy Du's Donuts here for $3.50 each. Its donuts are smaller in diameter than regular donuts, so I didn't buy. Perhaps the flavor and texture is on the money.Credit card only.",2,,2
20,Bethany W.,"Durham, NC",257,132,285,4.0,7/20/2017,"At $8 a sandwich, Fuku is certainly the most affordable David Chang meal around. When he first announced his chicken sandwich, he cited Chick-fil-A as an inspiration and I have to say, his iteration does a pretty good job at putting a new spin on one of my favorites. And, if not for the fact that Chick-fil-A has finally arrived in New York, this sandwich would've made it to 5 stars. Visually, Fuku's version looks almost the same as Chick-fil-A's. The breading is a bit crispier, with a slightly harder/crunchier texture closer to Korean fried chicken, rather than the softer, sweeter version Chick-fil-A has. Flavor-wise, it tastes almost exactly like its inspiration, right down to the pickes. For sauces, there's ssäm sauce and ketchup. Go for the ssäm for a spicy kick. The chicken itself is supposed to be habanero, but it's barely spicy.The spicy chicken sandwich uses thigh meat, which I was happy about since I'm a big fan of dark meat chicken. It wasn't particularly flavorful for dark meat though. It was about as chicken-y as Chick-fil-A's, which uses chicken breast, so it's sort of like taking an indulgently flavor packed cut of chicken and taming down the flavor, if that makes sense. It's impressive when you can take a piece of white meat and get that flavor - not so much starting with dark meat. Also, I found the potato roll to be too large for the piece of chicken. About halfway through, my bites were more bread than meat, and at the end, I was left dipping my bun into ssäm sauce. It was still tasty, but I didn't pay for a sauce sandwich!Overall, the sandwich itself is between 4 and 5 stars, but I've got to knock it down since it's not much better than the OG chicken sandwich but it costs more than twice as much. If you're looking for a trendy chicken sandwich though, this one is much better than Delaney's version.I came here for a late lunch after a meeting at a coffee shop, so I didn't try any of the drinks, but I would come back just to try those. The drinks are the most unique part of the menu and it's where Dave Chang's Asian roots really shine. I'm curious about the donuts too - they're by Wylie Dufresne, sourced from Du's Donuts, his new Williamsburg shop.",5,3,4
21,Mike N.,"New York, NY",131,268,51,4.0,3/21/2018,"I once ordered Fuku for delivery (years ago) and I really didn't like it and never felt the need to go back. That changed last week when it was raining and I didn't feel like walking far for lunch (there is one right by my office). My second experience was phenomenal.Don't remember what I had the first time, but the more recent trip I went with the spicy chicken sandwich. One of the better fried chicken sandwiches I've had, and easily the best at a ""fast food""-type place. The chicken was the perfectly crispy without any hint of dryness in the meat. Also got a side of their ranch which was great as well. Unfortunately for my cholesterol, I will absolutely be back.",,,
22,Michelle V.,"New York, NY",27,140,20,2.0,6/20/2018,"I want to like David's food. I do. But this 8 dollar chicken sandwich was so disappointing I don't know where to begin. I want to preface this by saying your girl was hangry. So I was looking fwd to this. However, the chicken was somehow dry and the breading was too crisp where it erred on the side of burnt. Let's just say you're better off paying less for chick fil a and getting a fuller meal. I've come to a conclusion that all of David's food is trendy but not the greatest. The decor and vibe of the place was nice, I would grab a milk bar dessert and sit in here if they allow it.",2,,

Updated review","I decided to give this place one more try. First of all the manager reached out to me with the promise of a voucher which never came. I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries over ritual, waited till it was ready then went to the store to find out my order hand 't even been put in. I had to wait 20, yes 20 minutes additional for a sandwich and some fries. The girl operating the tablets for mobile orders totally ignored me and the other people left waiting for order pickups. The girl serving customers in the end gave us a drink on the house which was nice but the sandwich left a lot to be desired. This place has been a nightmare on both visits and I won't be back which is a shame as I work next to it.",,,
24,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64809,5.0,6/19/2017,"The new Fuku on Wall Street just opened quietly to the public and it has lots of awesome new stuff that you should come try before the office crowds get here.Most notable is the Chimek, a whole chicken meal for $42, and actually a great value for the huge amount of food you get.If you're not there for a massive meal though, make sure you get the excellent new Chicken Dip Sandwich ($10). Be careful of the Extremely Spicy Sauce. It is, indeed, extremely spicy.The fries have changed again, with this third version, Cottage Fries, being the most addictive, especially when you get the super thin, crispy ones ($3).This is now the lunch move if you work in Financial District (by ""now"", I mean next week once they start lunch service, as they are opening starting at 5 PM for this first week).

26,Timothy H.,"New York, NY",3,78,102,4.0,8/7/2017,Fully recommend the ChiMek dine-in option and I have had the other options like the Koreano and they are also delicious. The ChiMek is perfectly sized for 4 people (good for 3 if you want to be disgustingly full). The chicken is prepared for just enough crunch and still have juicy meat. The fries are good but I was disappointed by the daikon which was drenched and had lost some of its original crunch. The Miller ponies are an amusing touch and we went throught them pretty quickly. Great dining option for what I consider a food desert.,,,
27,Hector V.,"Washington, DC",132,57,86,4.0,7/5/2017,"Stopped by on opening day to try out the Fuku Chicken Sandwich and wasn't disappointed. They used chicken thighs (my personal favorite) and the sandwich had the appropriate crunch, spice, and flavor. The chicken strips were ok, not spectacular, so I'd probably skip next time. The Yuzu lemonade was appropriately tart for my taste (but not sweet enough for my wife).

28,Denise L.,"Queens, NY",457,140,183,3.0,12/8/2017,"Fuku is a spin-off of Momofuku most notably known for their fried chicken sandwiches. I've read that the inspiration for this sandwich comes from Chick Fil A and I'm a huge fan of Chick Fil A, so I was expecting a sandwich with the same fresh, high quality ingredients from here. I came here for lunch and tried the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. This sandwich includes habanero chicken thigh, butter, and pickles on a butter roll. My immediate thought was that there was too much breading on the chicken. Some of it was very tough, which made it unenjoyable to eat. The chicken itself was good, with a nice kick of spice, but the meat was a little stringy in some parts. I opted for no butter because the idea of a slice of butter by itself on my sandwich kind of grosses me out. Overall I was a bit disappointed but I do want to go back since it's so close to work and try a few other menu items such as the Fuku Fingers and the fries with jalapeño seasoning.

Updated review","I was invited back courtesy of the Fuku team after my initial experience. I will say that the second time was much better and met my expectations of what this place should really be like. We ordered the Chimek (fried chicken) and it was really delicious.

This Fuku is very true to the fast food concept with only a few menu options (unlike the Fuku bar in midtown). During lunch hours/ rush hours, you do not have to worry about the wait time. The food are prepared quickly and you will get it right after you order. The addition of the fuku bowls (rice bowls) is nice, but the signature chicken sandwiches are still the winner here, with the real highlight being the Koreano (which used to be sort of a hidden menu item). The richness of the juicy fried chicken is perfectly offset by the pickled daikon! If you love pickled radish, definitely get it. As far as I know the only place in Manhattan where you can get Du's donuts. Du's is based in Williamsburg. They offer three different flavors which are all super tasty. $3.50 a piece.

A little twist to regular fried chicken sandwich. Their chicken bites are amazing with saam sauce.If you decided to go for something healthy:-**Rice bowl!! This is one of my favorite chicken rice bowl! HUGE AND FILLING! Brown rice, with chicken breast, kimchi, veges and some pine nuts are so flavorful that I don't even need to add any dressing. -Their salad is also amazing with fried chickpeas. It's so unique that I never see it in other salad storesDinner Options:-CHIMEK!! You can't get it in other location so grab your friends and order this!! You gotta eat it by wrapping it with the bread and the sauce. It's absolutely one of my favorite.I will be back!!!",15,9,16
42,Brian G.,"New York, NY",30,42,41,3.0,7/14/2017,"Fuku is a pretty cool name for an average tasting spicy chicken; we went for dinner take-out and we really were intent upon the Chimek but they wouldn't serve it to go which sucks that is prob the best thing on the menu. Because it has such limited seating, we didn't want to wait to sit in tight fitting, fast-food seating, a shame. They also had these cool donuts that they make in-house but were out of them. Learn to better do inventory so they aren't out.The chicken fingers and french fries were also average, does that mean it is bad? No, it was okay, but the ""wow factor"" wasn't there. To note, Delaney Chicken which may not have the Fuku name recognition is better and tastier (find my review on Delaney Chicken). I'm selfish and gave it 3 stars mainly because location is everything for me with takeout that I can walk 3 minutes away and still have it back to my place, fairly warm. Price does add up but still would agree on $$, my spicy chicken, 2 orders of chicken fingers, some non-alcoholic drinks about $30-$35. And YES, I will indeed go to it again and again for convenience.",1,1,2

There are a ton of people waiting for their food mostly huddled at some high tops or by the drink machine.I ordered the chicken sandwich and fries. While they were good they certainly weren't worth over $12 bucks. The chicken sandwich is no better or different than chic-fil-a, almost the same. I'd prefer to walk over to Shake Shack. The fries are good, more like home fries. The chili sauce is very good, nice kick and sweetness to it. But it definitely doesn't stand out from any other fast food place to me. Overall, maybe if I was in a bind and craving a chicken sandwich I'd come back here.But, it's probably unlikely.",1,,
46,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,2.0,7/5/2017,"Having already tried their signature spicy chicken sandwich at the original Fuku and Fuku+ (really liked it at Fuku when I went a few years back, but it was a complete 180 at Fuku+ and was extremely dry and I haven't tried it again since), I decided to try the ginger chicken bowl since that's new and unique to the menu here.  The verdict: everything in the bowl was delicious EXCEPT the chicken, which was really dry and really not that gingery either.  I was actually a bit worried before ordering that the pulled chicken would be dry because it's white meat, but I was hoping I would be wrong since this place specializes in chicken.  Too bad.  The rest of the bowl had great flavor combinations though.  I just had to pair each bite of chicken with kimchi to add some moisture...then I ran out of kimchi.Du's Donuts:As of today, Fuku Wall Street opened for lunch and is offering specialty flavors from Du's Donuts, which I'll admit is the reason I decided to return to Fuku.  The donut flavors are currently green apple peanut butter, coconut kalamansi, and peach yuzu.  I've been very curious about these donuts and was glad I could try them without going all the way to Brooklyn.  The good -- the flavors are very strong; you can smell exactly what you will taste (e.g., green apple or coconut or peach) even before taking a bite.  The bad -- the flavors are so strong that they're borderline overwhelming after a few bites, and it is on the sweet side.  But the biggest negative for me was the texture of the donut.  They were rather dense; not really dry, but certainly not airy.  They were as cakey as can be, but not in a good way (for me, at least).  I couldn't quite place my finger on it and thought they reminded me of the texture of apple cider donuts, but slightly less soft and mushy.  Then my friend commented and said they were like store bought donuts, and that was exactly it.  They were essentially the same texture as Entenmann's.  Not sure if that's intentional, and maybe there are some people out there who like that...tastes are subjective.  Anyway, as a side note, the green apple glaze was much stickier than the other two and did not set, so it smeared everywhere.  The packaging for the donuts was not ideal -- they were put into paper bags instead of boxes or something that would not touch the glaze on top.",2,,

They serve the sanwich in a tiny slider bun then give a massive chicken patty. No toppings? It could do with lettuce tomato and some special relish sauce.

I caught myself craving their spicy chicken sandwich. Yeah I know I thought I was so cool. Well I decided to go in again and give them another try. I have to say it just feels a little too expensive for a sandwich, fries, and drinks to come out to $14, especially when you see the size of the drink and fries. So that's my turn off with Fuku. But it wasn't obviously a big enough turn off because I came back and ask me ""will you be back again?"" oh why yes I will!  I would say that the only reason why I am giving this place four stars is either because I am cheap or they are a little pricey.  Other than that they have great service the staff has always been friendly and eager to assist.

The chicken was enormous, juicy and the breading was really crunchy. My only complaint was that the bun was really soft and fell apart. Also tried the chicken dip sandwich that was recommended by a staff member. I have to say I was not digging the consistency of the chicken, it was pulled chicken in gravy and just didn't work for me.

The rest of the meal wasn't so great. The sides ranged from decent to cold/soggy, but it was the chicken that we came for. All the pieces were crispy, but some of the coating on the sweet/spicy pieces was way, way too aggressive, like 3 bites to get to the chicken meat thick. Even worse though was the flavor of the chicken, all the pieces had this weird irony flavor that chicken has when it has been reheated as leftovers... almost a turkey-like aftertaste. Maybe why there was so much coating? There isn't much else to say other than it was just bad... which is especially annoying for the price.",,,

Today, I got the chicken tenders and they were really juicy.  In addition, I saw the crispy delicata squash rings on the menu and decided to pair it together.   YUMMY.    I got 4 large pieces of white meat  tenders along with 5 crispy squash rings and I'm a happy camper.  Also talk about above and beyond, I waited patiently for my food and got rewarded!  My squash rings took a little bit longer than usual to come out and the manager offered me a dessert for my patience.  Carrot cake doughnut is delicious!  Pro Tip: Credit Card Only",,,

I've always gotten my sandwich through MealPal, which means I'm paying about $6/sandwich.  I'm not sure how I would feel about the sandwich at $8 (I probably would not get it more than once a week), but at $6, it's one of the best deals around.

Flavorful, moist, and a little bit of a kick without being too spicy. Definitely one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've had.So why am I not giving this 5 stars? A few reasons: For fast food, it's pricey ($13.50 for a sandwich, fries, and a drink, when most fast food places sell combo meals for ~$7).

Cool take on the traditional Korean lettuce bbq wraps that I'm absolutely obsessed with. We also got the salad to try to be slightly healthy.  It was light and refreshing, and we enjoyed the mix of textures.  My only complaint would be that the salad had a few stems in it - depends on personal preference, I'm not a huge fan of stems, but can see how others could be.

I then ordered a chicken sandwich and was told they would call my name when the order was ready. After about 7 seconds she returned with my order and handed me my bag. I was a little surprised it came out so quick, but figured it was recently prepared. When I took the sandwich out of the bag and opened the sleeve to eat, I couldn't get it out as the top bun was completely stuck to the inside of the wrapper. I proceeded to rip and peel it away and rebuild the sad excuse of a chicken sandwich in my hands. Do these sandwiches come with any kind of sauce? Because either there was no sauce, or whatever it did come with was completely absorbed  into the bottom bun, to which it and the pickles embedded in it must've kept it moist enough to prevent it from getting stuck to the wrapper as well. The breading was rock hard and the chicken dry AF. Either the name Fuku is a pun and this whole experience was orchestrated, or the location needs to undergo some retraining on quality control. My best guess is that this sandwich sat under the warmer/heat lamp from an anticipated lunch rush that never came due to the weather, and someone thought it would be a good idea to serve this to save food cost. There is no way a brined chicken thigh would get that dry unless it sat hot holding for 3-4 hrs. The other theory I have is that the person who prepared this sandwich is extremely lazy and did this to maximize downtime and minimize work load, or depending on how you look at it, is a highly determined individual trying to eliminate wait times entirely by always having product ready. To better explain this would be via a Y=1/X asymptote, where X=time. Kudos to you, but unfortunately in this scenario Y=quality. A for effort my good man, but you might want to reconsider your priorities.",4,,
89,Daniel C.,"San Francisco, CA",70,13,10,4.0,5/31/2018,I've ordered the chicken sandwich 3 times. It is really great. The staff on point and fulfill my Ritual orders promptly and accurately. I'd like to see the menu change up more often as well as cheese inside the peppers (side).,,,
90,Tim S.,"ASTORIA, NY",12,101,0,2.0,9/6/2017,Average chicken sandwich....not worth the walk or crowd in my opinion. Also the fries weren't really that great.,1,,

92,Robert K.,"Park City, UT",0,5,0,1.0,12/10/2017,"I was very excited to try this restaurant having tried the signature places in manhattan before.  I love the concept and left my Hotel Andaz and walked over...  I ordered a extremely spicy chicken sandwich, side of thighs and fries(I was very hungry) and eagerly awaited hearing my name.  When I received my food, the chicken sandwich was so dry I could not chew it and the thigh side was equally dry and difficult to eat a single piece.  The fries were good.  The best part of my meal was the Hite beer I had ordered to accompany my meal ($4) and no one noticed that I put my meal into the trash after 2 bites.  Once again love the concept but very poor on the execution. No pride seen in the staff for the quality of food they put out.  Sorry to see....",,,
93,Marin S.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,5.0,10/24/2017,I rarely if ever write a review but I have eaten here a few times and every time I come in I am greeted by friendly faces and awesome food.  The signature spicy fried chicken sandwich is always on point and is just so good. A great addition to Fidi.,,,
94,Carvey L.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,12,4,1.0,10/17/2017,"The food is average, I got the dipping chicken sandwich. Not only did it take them 20mins to make but also spilled my sauce in the container. It was a mess and the price is soooo much higher than other chicken shops. I get that this shop is new to the Wall Street food competition, but I expected it be much more capable given the owner is renowned owner in food industry. Sadly I don't think I will visit again.",,,
95,Lou L.,"New York, NY",5,44,31,3.0,8/25/2017,"I stopped in to FUKU today, there was nothing inherently bad about the food or exceptional. I ordered a smallish, fried chicken sandwich and some fries; the meal was ok.  The service was fine - friendly and quick. There was nothing offensive about Fuku, but nothing exceptional either.   I feel like 5 stars is excellent, 3 stars is average.  I feel that fuku is a pretty average fast food experience.",,,
96,Patrick O.,"Manhattan, NY",102,68,0,5.0,9/26/2017,Excellent chicken. The ranch sauce is bomb. I've heard the chicken sandwich only gives you a fraction of the fingers that you get in a regular order. Sounds like a no brainer to me.,,,
97,Ramya S.,"Manhattan, NY",91,16,9,1.0,9/3/2017,Spicy chicken sandwich was dry and bland. It was nice to grab soju drinks and walk around the Seaport with them - but not much to write home about regarding the food.,,,
98,Emily R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,10/26/2017,"I love david chang's other places but Fuku is not doing it for me. I first went to the one in the east village and was disappointed when they served a prefried chicken sandwich sitting under a heat lamp. Despite the bad experience, flavorless. I'm not going to go back anytime soon.",,,
99,Patricia ..,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,8,5.0,7/17/2017,"I forget that a warm welcome and great hospitality can come with great food at a reasonable price in NYC.I came here just prior to the dinner rush on a weekday for a takeout order as a special request for my husband who was not feeling well that day. While waiting for the order to be prepared, Celia and I began chatting and she explained the build of the new location, what they were going for, and the history of the space.When the chef, Kenny, found out it was a take out order for someone feeling a bit under the weather he went out of his way to add a few special touches to the order to make it easy on me and nicer for my husband.Oh, and did I mention the food? Outstanding! Holy smokes the Chimek is out of this world!The trick to this location, if you can, is to avoid the lunch and dinner rush!Thanks to the folks at Fuku for a great meal and not being treated like a pick up number on a slip.",,,1
100,Debbie S.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,11/2/2017,"I had high hopes for their extremely spicy chicken sandwich. I love chicken. I love bread. What's not to love about this sandwich? Um, everything. Except for the sauce. I have no complaints for the extremely super very spicy sauce even though it gets everywhere, as it clears my sinuses and vanishes all liquid in my tear ducts, which was an unlooked-for bonus. What was definitely an unlooked-for letdown was that the chicken was stringy and had the texture of balsawood. The heat level was just above tolerable for me (see: above) so I didn't bargain for trying to bite into the sandwich, hitting a balsawood wall of resistance, and trying to chomp several times (burning up my lips in the process) before giving up. I give up on this sandwich. I give up on Fuku. You win. But you don't win my heart.",,,
101,Jimmy O.,"Manhattan, NY",34,3,0,5.0,9/8/2017,"WOW. The chicken sandwich from this place knocked my socks off. So tasty and so much fun. Now that I've discovered this place, I feel like I have a new go-to in NYC!",,,
102,Lila H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,40,21,4.0,8/3/2017,Tried here for the first time and ordered the seasonal kale salad with dark fried chicken meat. The meat was not as flavorful as I would have thought/liked. Perhaps that is intentional to make me want to go back for more. The salad was fresh and delicious. Fried chick peas is an interesting twist. Will go back to try the flagship fried chicken sandwich which I was told has a different batter from the salad chicken.,,,
103,Justin N.,"GLENMOORE, PA",3,34,8,5.0,8/1/2017,"Korean Chick-Fil-A. That's pretty much what this place is. However, I much rather eat here than the latter. The sandwiches are great. So are the bites. I prefer dark meat over white breast meat so the the sandwiches and nuggets taste extra good. Not much seating so either don't come during lunch rush or plan to take-out.",,,
104,Evelyn T.,"New York, NY",216,7,0,4.0,7/31/2017,Went on Monday afternoon. Chicken sandwich is goood for $8. Crispy. Has a good enjoyable kick. Wanted to try the fries but was unavailable around 11:15am when I went...,,,
105,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10,34,2,5.0,7/13/2017,"I've been looking forward to trying Fuku for some time, and I am SO HAPPY they opened a location in FiDi. They're also located right next to Milk Bar (I know, dangerous) so plus points for that. The Fuku Chicken Sandwich was delicious and their fries are dusted with just a little spicy kick at the end. Definitely coming back!",,,
106,Ariel P.,"Bronx, NY",26,104,28,5.0,7/6/2017,"Perfect chicken Sandwich!!!! I was convinced that nobody was touching Shake Shack, but I was 100% wrong. The chicken is masterfully seasoned. The batter is world class... the bread... the spicy sauce... just wonderful. I walked out the place with the flavors still dancing in my mouth. Of course I'm talking about the Fuku signature. The customer service was also super on point. I am actually going tomorrow to try the Chicken Dip sandwich. It sounds freaking delicious. Davin Chang is a beast! Thank you for setting up shop in the Financial district which has been known for a while to have meh places to eat just about in every corner.",,,
107,Alex M.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,9/20/2017,"I'm always looking for something new and delicious, I got lucky and found it at Fuku. I'm not a big chicken eater, but their Spicy Chicken Sandwich is the best damn chicken sandwich i have ever had. The fries are awesome, i love the extra kick they get from the jalapeno coating. I'm so sick of the boring flavorless fries from everywhere else. I've been back a bunch of times and have even tried a few other things on the menu. The BLT with Avocado is delicious when you want something a little lighter and the extra spicy sauce that comes with it is incredibly spicy, you only need a drop but it has a great taste. The frozen drinks are great for the really hot days and i love the peach donuts. I love Fuku and food this good is worth every penny.",,,
108,Vainius G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,3.0,8/11/2017,"It seems like their ChiMek is their big draw. However, I went with just one other person so it was too much food for us to order. I just got the Chicken Tenders and they were mediocre. I felt weird pieces in the chicken as I chewed. I regularly go to Sticky's on Maiden Lane which is much better. I am a sucker for honey mustard tho and theirs was pretty good. As well as their peach doughnut. Would only go back for doughnuts haha",,,
109,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,0,3.0,8/25/2017,"I am a big fan of fried chicken sandwiches (especially the sandwich at Shake Shack) so I was excited to see this place open! I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, kale salad, and bites. There was a pretty sizable piece of fried chicken on the sandwich (larger than Shake Shack for sure), but it wasn't at all spicy. A few pickles sat below the chicken, but there was no sauce. We ordered some separate side sauces, but you had to spread them on yourself if you wanted one. The kale salad was tasty, but the bites didn't have much of a chicken flavor to them. Overall, I wasn't that impressed. Unless you add a lot of sauce, the meal will be pretty much flavorless.",,,
110,Min W.,"San Francisco, CA",163,2,0,5.0,8/6/2017,The most amazing chimek meal we had - spicy and delicious :) And the drinks are super awesome as well :),,,

114,Taylor C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,0,4.0,7/20/2017,"Came here the other night- unfortunately we weren't that hungry otherwise i would have insisted on the Chimek. Instead I got the chicken dip sandwich and my friend got the spicy chicken sandwich. We split the dark meat bites. Everything was delicious, my favorite being the bites!! Using dark meat is definitely the way to go as it adds another dimension of flavor. I also appreciated how light the breading was. Very little, really lets the chicken shine through. My friend loved the spicy chicken sandwich. I found the chicken dip sandwich very interesting. It was very hard to hold together as the bread got soggy and could not hold up the weight of the ingredients. I really enjoyed the side of gravy they provided- put that all over the sandwich. I also found it surprisingly spicy... Like really much spicier than I had anticipated considering this was the chicken dip and there was an alternate called the spicy chicken. Maybe just me. Anyways, everything was good and will be back to do the Chimek!!!",,,
115,Chris L.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,5.0,12/29/2017,"Chimek is delicious and actually a great value. Way too much for two people but for three hungries or four kinda-hungries, it's perfect. Both flavors of chicken are great, one is sweeter than the other, and both were extremely moist. The sides are fine, fried pickles were yummy, but the fries were nothing to write home about. The Chimek was totally worth it for sure.",,,

117,Naimul H.,"Austin, TX",216,29,10,4.0,11/16/2017,"I got the spicy chicken sandwich (sando) and the fries, plus one of the donuts (keylime).  Let's start with the temperature - it wasn't hot, maybe that is just my luck but the fries were lukewarm and the sandwich was similar.  They lose a star for that.  Everything else about the experience was excellent.  The restaurant is nicely designed and clean, with clear markings for where to line up for different kinds of orders.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I ate my food at a table in the restaurant, which was pretty empty at 2pm on a Thursday.  The line for milkbar next door was longer. The sandwich is great.  It is better than chickfil-a, or wendy's.  The potato roll is soft and springy, the huge piece of chicken thigh is marinated and breaded in a crispy, slightly peppery coating.  This is a zesty sandwich but I didn't find it particularly spicy.  It has good flavor and the chicken itself is moist though not juicy.  I put their house made ranch on my sando.  The pickles are good too.  Thicker than average and flavorful, tastes of more than vinegar, there are herbs the brine.  Everything works together.  The fries are very crisp.  They're covered in a jalapeño seasoning that is again, not that spicy, but leaves a slow, low burn on your tongue.  I imagine they'd be excellent fresh out of the fryer.  The donut is a great cake donut, very flavorful.  But I don't really like cake donuts.  I recommend going to Fuku!",,,
118,John O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,8/10/2017,"Chicken tenders are ok, but the sandwich was very disappointing.  Tiny portion, which I would be able to live with if it was delicious, but alas it was far from delicious. It was SO SO overcooked, rubbery, and tough. You literally couldn't rip it with your teeth. I used my hands and had to exert almost all the strength in my 200 pound frame to rip a piece of the chicken off. When I told the staff it was absurdly tough and overcooked, their reply was simply ""oh it's thigh meat"". What an insightful and helpful answer/solution (not) for a bad sandwich.... terrible customer service.",2,,
119,S D.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,4.0,11/28/2017,Went at prime lunch time on a cold day. Zero line which was great and very nice staff. Spicy chicken Sandwich was only fair - the bun to chicken ratio is not quite right for me. And there is no sauce which I actually liked but I think most people don't. Fries were great! Super crispy.,,,

122,Killerasp K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",23,34,10,2.0,7/18/2017,"Pretty average food. Fried chicken sandwiches are near and dear to my heart. I've heard friends say its one of the best they ever had. I got their Spicy Chicken Sandwich and their monthly special (koreana? i forget the name), but its just Spicy Chicken Sandwich with some daikon on it. Both were just average fried chicken thighs in between potato buns with some pickles. Their fries are a disgrace to fries. They were technically sliced chips. Fried? Not so sure, they were soft and not crispy at all. They could have at least double fried them. Pick any fast food joint off the top of your head and they will have better fries. Heck, frozen pre cut fries are better than this. Ugh. Had high hopes for this place but everything is just average. Want great fried chicken in the FIDI area? Go to Sticky's finger joint. Stick's is sooooo much better than Fuku. (if there was a McDonalds in the area, id say you are better off getting a McChicken)",,,
123,Benny L.,"Staten Island, NY",43,190,10,4.0,7/7/2017,Great having this location in downtown and it has a lot of seating. Got the promotional opening week spicy chicken sandwich for $5 along with the drink. I wish they had the ssam sauce here instead of these other ones they charge for. I also wanted the fries to have the same seasoning as the other place cuz these are more like chips and more plain but can't complain. Will hopefully try the chimek at a later date.,,,
124,Amy S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,9/7/2017,"Seriously delicious. I've had a lot of fried chicken and this is among the best. Chicken is amazingly juicy, tender and perfectly flavored. And great value too. Can't wait to go back.",,,

126,Steven C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/16/2017,"Really enjoyed the food and experience here. Skipped the classic chicken sandwich and went straight for the newer items, and had the salad, sweet and spicy fingers, and bites. The bites were my favorite - juicy pieces of dark meat that were hot from the fryer.  But what really stood out was the ranch dressing, which went well with the fried chicken. The salad was a good complement to the chicken, with the lightness of the salad balancing out the fried elements.  Service was awesome, and really love that despite this is a fast casual place, everyone seems to really care",,,
