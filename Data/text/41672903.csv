0,Emily C.,"New York, NY",720,100,19,4.0,10/16/2018,"Came here last weekend for their $85 prix fixe all-you-can-drink wine dinner. Definitely a steep price tag but you do get your money's worth since aside from ~bottomless~ wine, you also get an appetizer, entree and dessert! For our appetizers, my BF and I shared the scallops and the shrimp cavatelli. The scallops were so soft and well made, and the sauce it came with was honestly amazing. The cavatelli was delicious as well and surprisingly had a little spicy kick to it. For my entree, I got the Filet Oscar and was pretty underwhelmed. For starters, the kitchen accidentally made my steak well done instead of medium rare and so they had to send it back to the kitchen. Even when I got the actual medium rare steak, I wasn't too impressed. It was pretty dry and the fixings on top were too rich and creamy. For the dessert, my BF and I split the ice box chocolate cake and it was incredibly decadent. So rich and sweet, although by this point I was so full I could barely swallow anything. Overall, pretty solid spot for a fancy dinner but the steaks weren't amazing. Everything else was wonderful though!",1,,1
1,Colleen K.,"Brightwaters, NY",5,24,4,4.0,10/2/2018,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  They have one of the best deals in manahattan, $85 for the wine dinner cannot be beat.  I am usually a steak girl, but at Maloney and porcelli, I always go with the crackling pork shank, it is amazing!  The homemade apple sauce has just the right amount of kick.  The red velvet cake is also delicious. It has the cutest presentation. The service here is top notch as well. The wait staff is attentive without disturbing your dinner.",1,,
2,Amy J.,"Tualatin, OR",57,8,4,5.0,5/22/2018,"My mothers and I are visiting and were perusing possible restaurant choices for dinner and happened upon this one.  I was immediately intrigued by the look of the menu, which was not your hoity toity menu.When I showed her, she reminded me that we had already walked by it and she had remarked how beautiful and inviting the interior was.So off we went.  And I am here to tell you, not only was our waiter, Terry, super pleasant, but the food...OMG.As a rule, I do not buy steaks at restaurants because I can cook a mean steak on my Traeger.  Well, my ribeye was, hands down, the most delicious steak I have EVER eaten.  I ate it just as it came- no steak sauce or extra seasoning was needed or wanted.We had button mushrooms-yummy- and creamed corn-so good.  My mom had the lump crab cake, which she also said was the best one she has ever had- full of big clumps of crab and no filler. She also had the wedge salad, which was served with amazingly fresh slices of tomato on the side.My belly is very content right now.",2,,
3,Alli E.,"Los Angeles, CA",358,138,380,1.0,11/12/2018,Extremely saddened by my recent visit. I came here three years ago and got the creme brûlée & thought it was out of this world. I came in today hoping for the same experience and it was nowhere near as good. It tasted like it's just been sitting in a fridge all day - they didn't even add sugar and burn the top. It was completely soft. My friend got the red velvet cake which was totally dried out. Both desserts tasted like they had been on display for a week lol. And for $14 & $18 each it was a complete waste of $. We didn't make a dent in them. When you come to a steakhouse - you expect atleast a decent tasting dessert. Won't be coming back.,2,1,2

5,Suzie D.,"New York, NY",0,10,1,1.0,11/12/2018,I'm sorry but if you're going to charge $18 for a single dessert...at least make it taste good. The red velvet was beyond dry and tasteless. The cream cheese icing was decent but overall very disappointed.,,,
6,T D.,"Manhattan, NY",10,15,116,2.0,3/24/2018,The quality of steak is not so bad for this kind of level. But the service is so slow. We sat there over 20 minutes for waiters giving us menu. Same thing happened at the checkout. We had waited another 20 minutes to get signed. Terrible!Won't go again,1,,
7,Kyle C.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,214,230,4.0,8/12/2017,"Went by for an early dinner and sat solo at the bar. I was welcomed right away and the restaurant has a typical old New York vibe to it. I ordered the lobster bisque. Had a beautiful presentation and very fresh lobster. Flavors were on point. Still it just was a tad bland too. A slight kick upward on salt or spice might've sealed it for me. For entree I ordered the roasted carrots (a tad too sweet but LOVED the way they roasted them). I also got the roasted chicken entree. Again great prep with the crispy and juicy chicken. If the chef reads this, try thickening the sauce a bit. The sauce would be amazing with a more gravy like sauce texture instead of being so watery. Also, again, the chicken was a tad underseasoned. Just a slight amount more seasoning would've taken two of the dishes from a 7 to a 9. Fixing that sauce would take that chicken to a perfect 10. Great old fashions here too by the way! Perfectly prepared! Almond joy ice cream damn good!",1,1,
8,Roni K.,"Fremont, CA",30,145,577,3.0,3/27/2018,"First impression...the restaurant is quite dim. It's a romantic setting- but hard to read the menu if your eyes are bad. We were seated in the corner table. Immediately, I noticed that the chair is very uncomfortable. It is slippery and has no cushion. Or perhaps I just don't have enough of my own personal cushion. Haha! There is an old school/God Father/ Italian theme, hence the old hardwood chairs. Considering the price and the average 2-3 hours a customer spends dining, I believe comfort is important. We attempted to order a bottle of wine. However, our 1st selection was unavailable. Then our 2nd selection was also unavailable! The 3rd selection was the charm, I reckon. My hubby said it wasn't good though. D'oh! We ordered the shrimp cocktail. That thing was massive! Awesome and Yummy! I don't know how, but I must of gotten confused while looking at Yelpers photos and the printed menu. I proceeded to order the crispy pork shank. And when they brought it over- from afar, I thought it was a crab! I was actually excited hahaa! Thought I lucked out and they got my order wrong. But anyway, yes it was a ginormous crispy pork shank! Man, it was intimidating- scary! I didn't know where to start or how to start! WTH! The shell/pork skin was broiled so crispy that it was actually hard to even eat. It's like chicharrones but this was one super hard, it could be a weapon! It was cool looking though. I eventually got brave and cut the crispy skin off. Well actually, I opened it up- as if it's a shell. The meat was oven hot and tender. The meal came with a side of apple sauce. It was an interesting pair. The meat wasn't marinated enough, so I guess the apple sauce was support to be the dip? Not sure. The dish was ""aight"". I wouldn't order it again. It was much to ginormous. If I was closer to home, I would have taken it and turned it into pull pork! Seriously! But I was about 2500 miles from home. Felt bad wasting half of the pork. Dessert time and there's no cheesecake?? I don't recall ever going to an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve cheesecake...so we got the apple tart. It was ok. Edible but nothing spectacular. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this place. I could go elsewhere and get the same food for much less and probably get cheesecake 2- and a more comfortable chair.",,,
9,Jessica G.,"Larchmont, NY",70,127,367,4.0,3/15/2018,"Really yummy salmon burger, however it said it came with shaved cucumber and it was more like sliced cucumber. It was delicious, no complaints on taste, but I imagined more of a cucumber sort of slaw. It also came with a side of homemade chips that had a perfect crunch!",,,1
10,John T.,"New York, NY",0,33,0,5.0,10/18/2018,"Pros: -The food came super fast. Like wow, that was fast. It came in about 20 minutes. -The food portions were very generous. I had the fig and goat cheese pizzette. I was full halfway through the pizza.-They had free pretzel sticks and this sauce that came with it, I really loved the pretzel sticks. -We were there for someone's birthday, and they accommodated us by putting birthday candles, a little happy birthday sign on a dessert cake we ordered, and serving the cake in a nice looking cake stand. Thank you very much.There weren't really any cons, we finished lunch in record time (1 hour), as opposed to the usual 1.5 or 2 hour lunches. Fast, good restaurant. Totally recommend this restaurant.",,,
11,jessica s.,"Manhattan, NY",50,30,1,5.0,10/23/2018,"I have been to Maloney & Porcelli a few times and have had a wonderful experience each time. I have only been for their Wine Dinner special - after 8:30pm you can get almost any appetizer, entree, dessert and unlimited pours of wine (white, red, prosecco) for $85! And the food is actually really good! It's not the absolute best steak I've ever had, but it's pretty great, they cook it perfectly, and their food in general is really tasty. Their customer service is also fantastic. Their waiters are all extremely accommodating (and do not skimp on the wine pours at all), but their staff in general is excellent as well. Due to an unfortunate occurrence at Quality Italian (feel free to see my review for that), at 10pm this past Saturday we called Maloney & Porcelli to see if they could fit 10 of us in last minute, and they accepted us no problem, and we didn't even need to make a reservation. They were extremely friendly and welcoming when we came in as well... a completely different experience from the general customer service at Quality Italian. We were still there past closing due to our late arrival, and they did not in any way make us feel like we should rush to leave, and were very kind to us on our way out as well. It's a pretty impressive space there as well - the overall experience from service to food is truly a great one, and it's a perfect place to go for a fun evening with good food. Be ready to have leftovers as well because the portions are generous!",1,,

13,Curtis F.,"New York, NY",3,8,14,4.0,1/25/2018,I checked out this steakhouse with a few friends for restaurant week. The ambiance is nice there were many people who were having business dinners as opposed to those attending for RW. The staff is great! The restaurant was packed but In spite of this they were very attentive and we were seating quickly. Now the food. I ordered from the standard menu as opposed to the RW menu. I decided to get the dry age meatball as an appetizer.A dry age prime rib steak cooked medium with whipped mash potatoes as a side. The meatball was flavorful and delicious as were the whipped mash. The steak however was a bit undercooked for my liking. It seemed to have been cooked rare as opposed to medium. Also the in house made steak sauce wasn't to my liking either. Unusually sweet for a steak sauce. So unfortunately the steak by itself was a bit of a letdown. For dessert I ordered the red velvet cake which was moist and delicious. At the end of the dinner our bill came which came out to approximately $400+ for 6 people (5 out of 6 were ordering from the RW menu). Overall I'll give this place a pass since the staff was amazing and most of the food was up to par in spite of my disappointment with the actual steak everything else made up for that. I'll recommend coming here for restaurant week if you're looking for a new steakhouse to try out.,,,
14,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",157,260,813,5.0,6/16/2017,"5-stars for this amazing restaurant. We had a great time and trying to make the nightly wine dinners our ""thing"". We went 10mins before our reservation but got seated right away. This place is huge so it shouldn't be a problem anyway. We got seated upstairs that was lovely. They started us with some breadsticks (read chewy pretzels) and honey-mustard butter. I don't like any of them but my boyfriend devoured those breadsticks. For appetizers we had prosecco with the crabcake and the spicy sopressatta pizza. The crabcake came with grapefruit and avocado and was beautifully made. It was a riot of flavors. It went well with the prosecco. The pizza was one of the better pizzas I have had. It was the perfect amount of spice from the peppers and the shaved fennel complimented beautifully. I ordered the surf and turf for my entree and my boyfriend had the aged prime rib steak (it's huge; heads up). My filet mignon was done right. My lobster was grilled/ broiled (I'm not sure how you cook them) perfectly. It came with butter and a lemon slice. It was a delicious meal. The fact that the wine dinner costs you 85 but you can order anything off the menu (except the angry lobster and the porterhouse) is impressive. The prime rib was also done to perfection. Their dessert choices are amazing. I went for the apple tart that comes with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. Crisp, not gooey apple slices and delicious, creamy ice cream. My boyfriedn took the almond ice cream. They gave three scoops and toasted almonds as the garnish. While I took some red wine with my steak, I went back to prosecco for my dessert. Awesome food for an awesome price. The service is great. The ambience is great. The location is great. Definitely going back!",5,,
15,Kara Y.,"New York, NY",18,80,202,3.0,6/16/2017,"The food was not that great but the service was wonderful. I came here during restaurant week with my family. My sister was running late by like 25 minutes and they gladly let us sit at our table to wait for her without making us feel uncomfortable. 3 of us ordered the steak (medium rare) and they were all cooked so inconsistently that mine was way over cooked and dry, I took a few bites and I couldn't even eat it anymore. I wasn't fond of the flavor either, it was my first time not being able to eat my entree lol. But my sister and father's steaks looked slightly juicer than mine. My mom had the porkchop and it was dry too. I was really disappointed with the entrees. It was a disappointing meal but at least the appetizers and dessert were delicious.",2,1,1

Updated review","I ate here 3x this week. 2 dinners and one lunch. I probably spent at least $400+ on the 3 meals. The lunch and dinner were very good and the servers were very nice. I just finished dinner. Dinner tasted great and the server was very nice. You know what wasn't? The 2 long thin bones in my Salmon. I told the waiter to tell the chef, so he could tell his staff to be more careful when they debone the fish. Salmon bones are no joke. No ""I'm sorry"" and no visit by the chef or manager. Unacceptable. I wasn't even looking for a discount because I am on an expense account. Just an acknowledgement of the mistake and a sincere apology. I spend 35 nights a year in NYC and was very happy to find a new restaurant in midtown. This will be my last visit. Improve your customer service and debone your fish correctly!!!",,,
17,Liz K.,"New York, NY",239,308,463,4.0,6/5/2017,"Nice spot - but a tad bit confused too. TV's at a restaurant/bar atmosphere sign off as a sports bar which this place is NOT and shouldn't even appear to be. Food - delicious! The complimentary bread basket was also, delicious. I couldn't stop eating the pretzel bread with the mustard grain butter... wow. CARBS ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND!!!Ordered the lamb shank which is HUMONGOUS. I highly recommend to order that for the table and share because it's a ton of meat. Service was awesome. our waitress was kind and friendly and even when there was a mistake it was easy to laugh off rather than get pissed off about. Oh yeah, the cocktails were STRONG. I had a vodka martini and my friend had a gin martini. I think we were pretty buzzed after 1 round. Overall, nice spot; Very date-like vibes. Would probably dine here again. Extensive wine list and beautiful decor with the fake cherry blossoms. But the TV... nah, has to go.",2,,2
18,Barbara R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"If you like your steaks greasy and not cooked as requested,, this is the place for you.  I have never in eating in NYC for the last many years beenexposed to more grease in my life.  The hash browns were tasteless, thebread sticks stale, the pours skimpy.  Proceed with caution.",,,
19,Harshini R.,"Manhattan, NY",14,126,43,2.0,11/10/2017,Went there for a team dinner and they weren't really prepared to seat so many of us even though we had made reservations a few weeks in advance.

Not worth the money.I wear a suit and tie to work, so lunches that spiral into the hundreds, etc. is not uncommon.

30,Daniella C.,"Midwood, Brooklyn, NY",15,20,11,1.0,2/13/2018,Came here for restaurant week and was very disappointed with the service have been to Smith and Wollensky and it was the exact opposite. We were seated at 630pm and did not get our apps until 740pm. Marcos our server was no where to be found. Our entrees def came out before our apps Bc the food runner looked at us bewildered and then disappeared with a cart. Must have been our food because my surf and turf looked like it died twice. My filet was charred and the lobster was dried out. They messed up in the kitchen and put all our entrees back under the heat lamps. Marcos didn't apologize he tried to make jokes which didn't make any of us gals giggle. He tried to fix it with a scallops app for two when we are four. Nice gesture but we wished it was a round of drinks instead. The food runner was more attentive. Lol We weren't even offered coffee with our dessert. We ordered sides and drinks it wasn't like he couldn't have increased his earnings. I can't believe took that long. I didn't mind because it was a girls night out. But won't be returning should be ashamed of yourself for ruining food and bad service. Not worth my money I'll go back to Peter Lugers. I been meaning to write to the management of the restaurant.,1,,

The filet was also accompanied with asparagus and I believe artichoke on the side.Also tried the Ribeye which was fat and juicy!!!Dessert: Red Velvet Cake and Chocolate cake.

36,Mel T.,"New York, NY",415,1213,2873,4.0,2/7/2016,"**WINTER 2016 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**For my Mom's birthday this year, we decided to take her out to restaurant week, which just so happened to end on the same day - so it worked out perfectly!The birthday girl wanted steak so when I was researching participating restaurants, I saw that Maloney & Porcelli had really good reviews. Plus their menu looked really good, so that's how we decided on this place.I made a resso through open table weeks in advance (since spots during RW tend to fill up quickly) for a Friday at 6:30. (FYI - if you plan on driving out to the city, metered parking starts after 6 pm. I saw this tip thanks to a fellow Yelper). It wasn't too packed for a Friday but did start filling up more later on.To start, they bring your table a little bucket of soft pretzel sticks with butter that has a hint of mustard (?). I really liked this because a) I haven't had soft pretzels in the longest time. b) they were warm and fresh. c) it was a nice change from the boring bread that other places normally bring out for you. I wanted to eat more of it but I didn't want to fill up on the food that was to come. And using the pretzel sticks as indication, I knew the meal was going to be good.For my appetizer, I had the parmesan-crusted Australian lamb chop with mustard seed & mint jelly. This was excellent. I don't normally eat too much lamb because most of the time, they have that gamey taste that I don't like. But this one was not gamey at all. It was cooked perfectly and the parmesan crust made the outside crispy. I wasn't a huge fan of the olive/tomato/cucumber salad it came served on top of but it didn't matter. The lamb chop was the star of the show anyway.For my main, I went with the prime rib roast with pommes Anna because what else would you order at a steak house?! (The seared tuna they had available sounded pretty good but I learned my lesson a few nights before when I decided to order the fish of the day at Delmonico's....don't ask..) For those of you who don't know what pommes Anna is, which I didn't until this night, they are layered potatoes cooked in a lot of butter and then baked/fried until they form a cake and the outside is golden and crispy. I had never even knew such a thing existed but I sure am glad Maloney and Porcelli introduced me to it! The crispiness went perfectly with the tenderness of the prime rib, which I ordered medium rare. It came with a beef reduction sauce on the side, which was just okay. In my opinion, the steak didn't need any sauce anyway.Finally for dessert, I decided on the vanilla panna cotta with orange sherbert. This was good too. If you've read any of my other reviews where I've ordered dessert, you'll find out that I'm not really a big sweets girl. But both the panna cotta and the orange sherbert weren't too sweet for me. One thing I should mention is that the panna cotta tasted more like a vanilla yogurt. I didn't mind it too much though.I should also tell you that during RW, they had a special where if you paid $48 (instead of the standard $38), you could get a glass of one of two wines they've selected. I really liked the entire experience I had at M&P. I read on their site that they have an $85 special for an appetizer, entree, dessert, and unlimited wine. Now that's my idea of a well-balanced diet!",1,1,1

Highly recommend. It's got the classic steakhouse feel with the warm wood and overall ambiance of feeling intimate even though the space is open.

There are only a couple of items not included and includes unlimited wine and they weren't stingy! Had crab cakes and my husband had seared sea scallops. The green sauce is spicy on the crab cake but I liked it, not sure how the grapefruit fit in, it actually distracted me from the flavors and I like grapefruit. The warn pretzel bread a fan! Not of the mustard butter....regular butter and a side of mustard or honey butter would be great. I had the filet oscar wow - did not get cheated and my husband had surf and turf. Skip the side you dint need it and the asparagus came out a little yellow and over cooked.Not that you'll need it but dessert is included. Has the 100 grand ice cream sundae and hub devoured the cheesecake.",2,,

This is about 3 pounds of pork, with the skin crispy and really crackling, and the inside moist and tender. Served with Firecracker Apple sauce, it's quite a culinary experience.We also do this Filipino style, cooked in a Turbo Broiler but the quality of the meat here is second to none, hence the price.Service is excellent, and that shank sure is unique among steakhouses.",2,1,2

Immediately I noticed one thing.... the AC was broken on one of the hottest humid days in NY and it was dinnertime. The servers were extremely apologetic and offered us free drinks and were on top of refilling our waters that we kept drinking b/c it was just so damn hot. Appetizers - Ricotta flatbread. It was very difficult to cut and it tasted cold and bland. Slightly disappointed. Entree -  I ordered the pork. It was tender, and tasty.. BUT near the center it was slightly pink and when i accidentally cut the bone it was completely bloody... My friend got the prime rib steak and it was cooked to perfection. Maybe a little heavy on the garlic, but delicious nonetheless. However, i couldn't finish my meal as it was too hot to continue.By the time dessert came around I really wished I had ordered the panna cotta than the chocolate cake. I was sweating at this point. I had a few bites of my cake. It was ok, but not mind blowing. Overall the service was great, but I expected more from this place. The broken A/C on a hot and humid day also didn't help.",3,2,1

And most importantly - the entrees - Steak!Nice, large cocktails.  Good wine at a nice value. First course selections were all good.  Finally... the dry aged, bone in, rib steak was one of the best I have ever had  - anywhere!  Flavor was deep, perfectly cooked.

Since we got a lot of items, I will just give some general impressions with a few highlights. I felt that the food overall was just OK. Even the prime rib was just OK. It really wasn't flavorful. What I thought was weird as well was that the person next to me ordered a well done prime rib while I ordered a medium rare. When it came out it was clear that mine was well done and my neighbor got my order. The waiter was so confused by this despite the obvious switch up. The appetizers were overall lackluster. The shrimp cocktail, the salads, even the lamb. The highlight of the dinner were he desserts. We got the chocolate cake, panna cotta as well as  the coconut cake. These were all quite good! The vibe of the place is old school. I enjoyed the collection of walking sticks along the staircase. Some were beautifully carved.",9,4,6

Of course, staying at the New York Palace right next door made the decision easier, but it was my conscious decision after reviewing many of New York's finest venues. At first I was also considering some of the younger, modern decor filled places, but something in my gut told me that this is about quality. And quality should win all the time.Boy, was I right. The minute we stepped in, the hostess greeted us with a big smile, which made us feel good. She led us to a great table upstairs with the right lighting and distance from the stairs and the restrooms as I had requested. Now, enters Miguel - the man who guided us through our dinner to make it a memorable experience.Miguel asked if I wanted to look at their wine, some appetizers and what not, all without forever hovering or pressuring. His demeanor was professional and words were witty. He made my wife and I feel very relaxed, and enjoyable. And since he found out about our special occasion, Miguel treated us with a shrimp cocktail with lump crabs. It was so fresh and tasty. I had a feeling the rest will be all good that night.I went with a bottle of red wine from Napa, and enjoyed the complimentary champagne as well. The entrees that we ordered were also magnificent. I mean, I know red meat - and they knew what they were doing. My wife loved the small Classic Filet and I also enjoyed my larger steak. It was huge for a filet mignon. I already had close to 2 bottles of wine, bread, and shrimp/crab, but I had to finish it. Everything was amazing.As I mentioned, all of this good food and wine, even if the setting looks nice, would mean nothing if the person helping you with the experience sucks. In our case, Miguel just hit it out of the ballpark with his professionalism and brief but witty conversations. BTW, towards the end of the night, a couple got engaged on the first floor - the same night my wife and I said our vows. It made us laugh and smile. All in all, a great night!",1,1,1

We went here for dinner after an event at Radio City & although we got a table pretty quickly without reservations the overall experience was below satisfactory. The waiter took forever to bring us menus and bread. He rushed all the questions we had about that menu and the different steak preps as if he had somewhere else to be. Then the best part was our order was taking an extremely long time to come so they brought a pizza saying it was complimentary from the chef.  After 30mins our steaks finally came and not only was my 14oz Filet Oscar not what I ordered it was charred like a hockey puck when I requested it be cooked Medium. Definitely not my first choice in steakhouses in NYC. Much better options in Bobby Vans, Old Homestead, Del Friscos etc. By the way who wants a pizza  when you're going out for Steak  ??",,,

60,Alice Z.,"Manhattan, NY",153,47,915,4.0,7/28/2017,"4.5 Stars - We chose Maloney & Porcelli for RW because their menu had so much variety. The portion sizes were bigger than we thought it would be which is always a pleasant surprise. The shrimp cocktail was actually jumbo shrimp unlike some other places that say it's jumbo shrimp but then serve much smaller ones (size definitely matters when it comes to shrimp cocktail am I right girls?). I don't usually rave about salads but the tomato and grilled peach salad was so refreshing for a hot summer night, and it was also a good size. I would go so far as to say it was divine! I want to eat that salad every day at home as an entree salad with grilled shrimp or sautéed scallops! The grilled peaches had such a nice char flavor...can't stop thinking about it! Entrees wise, we had the prime rib, the scallops, and the pork chop. All were cooked to perfection. The only complaint heard unanimously around the table was that the cut of prime rib wasn't great, specifically that the meat was stringy. My mom had a piece that had a vein she couldnt cut through with a steak knife. The pork chop was a pleasant surprise. No one gets excited about pork chops but after having a bite of Maloney & Porcelli's I will actively look for pork chops on restaurant menus. Desserts were just ok, we were so wowed by the apps and entrees our expectations were raised when it came to dessert. Again, they definitely did not skimp on portion size, the coconut layer cake was a huge slice of the cake. I don't like coconut so cant really comment on taste. The Panna Cotta was fine and the Chocolate Ice Box cake was too rich for my liking. Still thinking about that salad...",1,,

63,Tay H.,"San Francisco, CA",70,273,64,2.0,11/10/2015,"Average food, ridiculous prices.  Nothing I ate here was bad (except the creamed spinach), but I'm appalled at how expensive it all was.  No one in our 10 person group thought our $1,300 bill (!!!) was worth it.....and in that bill were only two moderately-priced bottles of wine.As a starter, I had stone crab claws - currently in season.  For $34 - THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS - I got about four bites of crab (one claw).  Some people might be OK with this, but the crab wasn't even good.  It was overly chilled and mealy - and it was served with some type of heavy mayo-based sauce.  I've had stone crab in Florida many times, so I'm not exactly a novice here.For my entrée, I had the lobster bisque and then a selection of veggie side dishes.  The soup left a lot to be desired.  It was served lukewarm and in a very, very shallow bowl, which made the whole thing hard to eat.  It was also more of a broth than a bisque - everyone thought I had ordered gumbo.  The mashed potatoes were overly whipped and a bit runny, with very little flavor (it was also lukewarm).  The creamed spinach was basically baby food - I've never had spinach so totally blended in a dish like this.  The button mushrooms were rather enjoyable, however.The other thing that everyone at the table hated were the tough, cold breadsticks.  They were almost redeemed by the interesting mustard butter...but not quite.Service was friendly and efficient, but it just couldn't make up for the ""meh"" food and insane prices.  I definitely wouldn't choose to come back here...",6,1,1

Updated review","George Bernard Shaw said there is no sincerer love than the love of food, and almost precisely two years later I can confidently say that Maloney & Porcelli will help you rediscover your foodsoul.The atmosphere is just as warm and vibrant, and the dining experience hasn't faded or faltered.

67,George T.,"New York, NY",524,226,1188,4.0,2/18/2015,"***ALL YOU CAN DRINK 3 Course Dinner*** $79, enough said....but I'll say a bit more anyways.Please keep in mind, my review becomes less reliable as the night goes on....you should probably disregard my desert comments as they are most likely confabulated. Maloney and Porcelli: the venue is your classic looking old school NYC steakhouse. That's the vibe. Spacious, waiters and to my surprise, waitresses, dressed in suits.  I came here with a large group from work, 11 to be exact.  I can't say Maloney's is up there with the other steakhouse great, you know the ones, but the all you can drink factor is for sure worth it if that's what ur in to.#House red, white, prosceco: which ever you want. Drinks stop at the desert course so take advantage. But stay classy, it'll be a shame if they take away this wonderful and unique deal for a few.  20% of my groups who partook in all you can drink did not make it out in great shape, shame on them. #3 course dinner:This is not a prixe fixe, even though it is.  What I mean is that you actually get to pick from their entire menu, 1 app, 1 entree, 1 desert. The only entree not included is the surf and turf (which is fair and quite reasonable), and sides no included.  But with that said, I got the lobster as an appetizer and huge bone in ribeye for entree.  Shared a giant cherry jubilee for desert. - cold lobster app: solid start, nothing special, good cocktail sauce with mild horseradish taste- bone-in rib eye: can't say enough about the CHAR. Something that I think every good steak should have. The best char I've had perhaps ever. With that said, the meat itself (cooked medium rare) was not as tender,fatty,flavorful as I'd hoped for. Still excellent, and the etoh helped.- cherry's jubilee....too enibrated to comment: i took a picture. comes in a giant glass goblet, supposedly for two.  They prepare the cherry's tableside with a portable stove, flames ablaze and all.OVERALL: I'd do it again.",,,

That's a bold statement, and one that I firmly stand by. We came here for a much needed date night and both took advantage of the $79 wine dinner special. If during your visit you see that special running, trust me and go with that. It's a steal: there are absolutely no restrictions whatsoever. ANY appetizer (even raw bar!), ANY entree, ANY dessert and unlimited wine. And GOOD wine, at that!Our server, John was a delight. Very polite and knowledgeable, and funny! Once we told him we were ordering the wine dinner, he immediately filled our glasses before taking our order, saying ""I couldn't take a wine dinner order without you both having glasses of wine in front of you."" Ha! He also indulged our inebriated inquiry about why they have a steak named after the star of Perfect Strangers on their menu, although I forget his answer at the moment. Blame it on the alcohol ...Our orders included the lump crab from the raw bar, and the halibut gravlax with creme fraiche and horseradish granita to start. The angry lobster and the filet oscar, medium rare for entrees. And the apple tart, and zoot suit creme brulee to round out our meal. EVERYTHING was spectacular. My filet in particular was cooked to perfection, and easily the best steak I've ever had. I was already planning my return visit before the main courses hit the table.And when they say unlimited wine, they mean it. Every time I went to the bathroom, my wine was refilled when I returned to the table. I don't think my glass was ever empty. I'm not sure how many glasses we had, as they were constantly full. Needless to say, we were quite giggly and tipsy by the end of the meal.We did order two additional things that ironically were the only two items that we weren't floored by. The half dozen oysters were very tasty and briney, but rather small and overall unnecessary. I also ordered the gruyere souffle for the novelty of it: I'd never had a souffle before and was excited for my first experience. While it wasn't bad, I realized that I guess I don't particularly like souffles. It wasn't what I expected and I wouldn't order it again. But, that's just a matter of preference and in no way a reflection of the restaurant itself.We definitely got our money's worth and enjoyed a wonderful evening with great conversation and food in an old school atmosphere. I loved the classic uniforms, the rolling carts for food and drinks and the dark cherry wood ambiance. I noted that the restaurant listed it's dress code as business casual, and we dressed the part. I was somewhat surprised and annoyed to see stray t-shirts, tank tops and flip flops amongst other diners. Come on: you're going to eat a $65 steak in $5 sandals?! But alas, we were situated in tourist central midtown and I suppose they must be accommodating as such. But again, this is my own personal rant and doesn't reflect on Maloney & Porcelli at all, as they are awesome!",1,2,1

My friend and I were enjoying dinner at the back corner of the first floor on the bar counter overlooking the kitchen. It was great seeing all the chefs prepare the food and get an idea of what to order just by watching all the food leave the kitchen. We were shocked towards the end of the meal when out of no where a large roach flew onto our table and crawled along the edge before disappearing. That has never happened to me ever so I was stunned still and when we both snapped out of it we immediately told the staff and got out of there. I do give them kudos for getting the manager quickly to take care of our check but I don't accept this reasoning ""this is NYC and it happens sometimes that's hard to avoid."" Well I understand it's a dirty city but I won't accept that of any restaurant I eat at. I did give it 1 star however because we'll it's the lowest rating allowed but even so the food was good. Although the taste is tainted by thoughts of what other critters may have been walking around in the kitchen that I shutter. But in the spirit of yelp I ordered the chicken parm and a salad that my waitress assured me was not big. Well the salad she recommended turned out to be a meal sized salad and I felt guilty not being able to finish it because I still had my chicken to eat. I did look pretty ridiculous with what was basically two dinners in front of me for myself. I think it's safe to say I probably won't be coming back.

The pretzel bread before the meal was good and tasted fresh, I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce though (sweet mustard/butter mix). I ordered the chicken parmesan with steamed spinach. It was pretty good. Nothing too extraordinary, but the portions were huge! I ended up having to take more than half home. For dessert, my table split the wood oven apple and plum tart.

The mint julib added more sweetness than mint flavor, but was a nice touch. The cooked vegetables lacked texture and soaked up the salty juice, so was difficult to finish. Dessert:Ice cream and sorbet - mint ice cream lacked the full flavor, ginger sorbet was very pungent, and raspberry sorbet was just perfectChocolate cake - very heavy and rich, but not so sweet so could enjoy more than a bite. Coconut cake - the coconut was very subtle, without the shavings I would have missed it. All in all, the entrees and dessert were the most ""creative"", but the entrees were solid.

95,Elaine Z.,"New York, NY",481,272,121,2.0,12/1/2015,"Quite disappointed with Maloney & Porcelli. I came here with my entire firm for our holiday party. We had the upstairs portion to ourselves with coat check, cocktail hour and a prix fixe dinner menu. I was pleased with the cocktail hour and hors d'hoeurves, with choices of lobster roll, mushroom pate, sliders to name a few. Dinner is where disaster struck. There were no vegetarian offerings for my friend and coworker, and she was served a mish-mash of side vegetables piled on a plate. She poked at it a few times and had it taken away.When I was ordering off the prix fixe menu and the waiter stopped to confirm, I repeated my dessert and he interrupted me saying ""stop telling me that"". I had hoped that was just an audible error on my part, but my coworker later on told me he had heard and was shocked that the waiter had said that to me. This definitely put a damper on my impression of the service.As for my food, I had the shrimp cocktail, filet mignon, and apple tart. The shrimp were plump and very tasty, and the apple tart was delightful as well. Unfortunately, the filet (medium rare) was a miss. There was no flavor and the sauce it was served with completely unappetizing. I ate half of it and did not feel compelled to continue. Since M&P is a steakhouse, I expected this particular dish to be a certain hit. If I didn't like it free, I probably would not like to pay four dollar signs worth of money to eat here.",6,,

Choice of any appetizer, any entree, and any dessert along with wine pairing with each course. I had the Peekytoe Crab Cake which had lumps of crab, crispy and beautifully topped with micro greens. This dish was good, but I wish I had ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare. I had a bite of the tartare from a friend's dish and it melted in my mouth. The blend of raw tuna on top of avocado with a savory sauce was delectable. For my entree, I ordered the Roquefort-Crusted fillet, medium rare of course. The blue cheese was a bit overwhelming, but presentation was fun! All steaks come with a pick with a potato chip on the top stating how the meat was cooked. I should have gone with the Dry Aged Prime Sirloin though, there's always next time!Dessert, I choose the red velvet cake. They really put this desert on a pedestal, all for me. Moist, good ratio between icing and cake on top of a green cake stand. Service was great, our waiter helped us out with our wine pairings and recommendations on the menu.

104,Rebecca T.,"New York, NY",57,45,51,4.0,8/10/2014,"I came here for restaurant week and it was amazing and beyond my expectations. I do lots of research and try to make my money worth for these restaurant week deals and this place is worth every penny. To start, I got the diver sea scallops app. It was a good size, plump, and perfectly pan seared. It was served over a sweet based creamy corn chowder. I then ordered their 10oz filet mignon. And i must note most places don't offer 10oz..they offer 8oz or even smaller or they charge you a supplement fee that's half the price of your meal. It was grilled exactly how I wanted it and how steaks should be ate , at medium rare-rare. Lastly I ended it with their salted caramel icecream with coffee crumble on top. And it ended absolutely amazing. As we were dining, the table next to us ordered the bone-in crackling pork and it looked like the most juiciest and tender slab of meat as they were cutting it off the bone to serve. This was not a restaurant week item, but I'm already planning my next visit there with the pork as my victim.",5,,

However, the minute I stepped foot into M&P, the staff treated us well, seated us in a nice location, and were attentive to our table.Appetizer:Parmesan Crusted Lamb Chop - Tender, Cooked perfectly.Entree: Dry-Aged Prime Rib Roast - Generous portion, cooked perfectly, medium rare with succulent flavor.Dessert:Panna Cotta - Tasty, great with coffee.",1,,

107,White B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,16,6,1.0,7/2/2017,"I don't know how this place can have such a high rating. Went a month ago, ordered 2 filets. One was ok-ish, the other burnt all over. Not just charred (although even that would be unusual) but blacked on the sides all around. It smelled like burnt barbeque. Meat spongy, flavorless, weird. The dessert and wine good. Ladies bathroom dirty, papers on the ground as if nobody cleaned it the whole night. After the dinner felt very heavy and rushed home.We went a week ago again to give them the Second Chance. What great people are we, right? ;-) I told them to be careful and not burn the filets. The filets came cold inside, spongy / chewy and flavorless again. I had to spit out a bit of fatty meat and didn't finish my steak. I would use that kind of meat perhaps for a stew. Felt sick afterwards and instead of our usual after-dinner walk with my man we rushed home to be close to the bathroom just like the last time after dining there. Thinking about it, even the mashed potatoes were bland and weird. Wine was good. But we go to steakhouses to experience great meat which simply did not happen here.We are not going back and waste further hundreds of dollars for a sub-par experience. After these two instances, we definitely prefer other steakhouses in NYC. I just don't understand what kind of steakhouse is this supposed to be. We are totally puzzled.",1,,

Anyway, as we were ordering, the waitress says ""oh the steak is actually a roast beef, is that ok?"" ... uh, no that's not ok. It's not steak! If I'd known there would be no steak, I'd have gone to a place with steak, ya know? But I digress..We ordered lamb shank and chicken under a brick, which were both very good (even though it wasn't steak). The lamb fell off the bone and the chicken was crispy on top and tender on the inside. We got sides of creamed spinach and tater tots - spinach was pretty good though a little watery and tots were too overdone in my opinion. Neither side was good enough to be worth the $11-12 it cost.Overall, pretty good food (though I can't speak to the steak), good service, nice ambiance.",,,

First, we walked in with reservations and was immediately given an unwelcomed, stuck-up attitude by the servers. They kept rolling their eyes and covered their face with the menus making faces as if they didn't want to serve us. Little that they know that I also work in the restaurant industry, so I know that they were talking and mocking us to the other servers. Clearly pointing and having everyone look at our table and laughing at the service station was extremely obvious and unprofessional. They made us feel like we weren't good enough to be there, and that we weren't going to spend a lot of money, even though our bill was well over $400. The food was okay, not the best seafood in NY that's for sure. Their pretzels appetizer was extremely hard and stale, tasted as if it was 1 week old.  Sadly, Red lobster is so much better.

The dining area is spacious and the servers are friendly and informative. We were a large party of 12 on a Wednesday evening and from beginning to end, our waiter was attentive refilling our wine glasses and attending to our waters. The timing of the food service was also on point, which is important especially when feasting like we did!I'm personally not a steak fan myself, however, I could tell that everyone else who had ordered steaks in the party were happy with their selections. The meats were HUGE and I, myself, opted for the Angry Lobster, which was also quite hefty. The name says it all: Angry Lobster because it's prepared with a nice blend of spices that really packs a punch! If you're a fan of a little bit of heat and want to tantalize your buds, give this guy a try! You won't regret it! It's cooked tenderly, served generously and atop mashed potatoes so don't spoil your appetite (or at least try not to!).We feasted over a nice selection of appetizers and sides, which ranged from the seafood bouquet (a daily special of the day consisting of a mix of snow-crab legs, oysters, crab meat, and jumbo shrimp), crab cakes, scallops and a pizzette to share. For sides, we shared the creamed spinach (nice balance of actual spinach and seasoned cream), creamed corn (sweet chunks of golden corn), whipped potatoes, tater-tots (crunchy and served with an aioli on the side), grilled asparagus (gotta have your greens! & sprinkled nicely with parmesan), and of course one of the more popular items on the menu, the thick-cut bacon (think Peter Lugar's). Everything we ordered was flavorful and complemented our meals perfectly. Definitely bring your appetite and give this spot a try. TIP: Good spot for business dinners as the ambiance fits the bill!

A traditional steakhouse, really solid.    The variety of their menu is well served with their classic cars. The staff is courteous.  The filet mignon, medium rare. Tender, with lots of fat but the raw meat was gratifying. One plate is enough at lunch. Nice to return to this strong steakhouse.",,,

It's not a long list, but there were quite a few that caught my attention, particularly, their Heirloom Beet Salad.And it definitely did not disappoint. I was thrilled with my meal. The beets were roasted to perfection, and accompanied by complementary textures of crunchiness that made it really wonderful. I also ordered a side of old fashioned creamed spinach and that was phenomenal too! For a steak house, I was very impressed with how they showcased vegetables, and offered something for even the non-meat eaters.For dessert, I was absolutely spoiled and got to try the Ice Box Chocolate Cake, as well as the Wood Oven Apple Tart. A note of caution for those brave enough to order the chocolate cake - it is rich. Seriously, I think the cake alone would have been filling in it of itself, and it was absolutely delicious. The apple tart was superb as well, and the ice cream just made it perfect. The whole meal was just exemplary, and I appreciated how a mostly meat-heavy restaurant such as this also had enough items on the menu to satisfy someone who's diet consists of no meat.",2,1,

The crab cake appetizer was very fresh but a little bland. The green sauce it comes with is delicious and I asked for a side of spicy mayo to give it that extra kick. The filet oscar main was delicious! The steak was tender and perfectly cooked and the crab was definitely not canned, also who doesn't love some bernaise sauce. Mmmmm. The creme brûlée was okay- I didn't care for the fruit preserve on the bottom. Buut the best part was the unlimited wine! Service was exceptional. Definitely a place to try!",1,,

And there's a ""limit"" to how much and everyone pays the same while getting the same amount of food.Basically, the steakhouse has this amazing deal (and EVERYONE should take advantage of it). It's an unlimited wine dinner special. It includes unlimited wine, an appetizer, an entree and a dessert (this is more food than any one person needs but well worth it and completely delicious. It's a great place...classy, but not stuffy.For wine, they serve:Quality ProseccoStag's Leap Wine Cellars ChardonnayDuckhorn Decoy CabernetCh. Giscours ""Petite Sirene"" BordeauxThere are no limits on the appetizer or entree (except the surf & turn entree option).So here's everything I ate:-cold-cracked lobster (whole lobster on ice cut in half served with cocktail sauce, lemon aioli and slice of lemon - you can also ask for clarified butter (about 1 lb))-dry-aged prime rib steak - so awesomely charred, but cooked to perfection and so deliciously seasoned.-old fashioned creamed spinach - delicious, very creamed-french fries w/malt vinegar mayo - the mayo is awesome (and i think we actually had the tots and not the fries (totally recommended)-nueske's thick-cut bacon (can this just be an entree?) - yes, it's that good especially if you like or LOVE bacon-zoot suit creme brulee - chocolate, pistachio, vanilla layers (and a berry fruit compote at the bottom) - delicious but after that meal, there's not much room for it-$100,000 bar - chocolate & caramel, ice cream, cocoa krispies (can you go wrong with this?...nope)TLDR: go for the $80 3-course with unlimited wine dinner special",4,2,1

130,Sonia S.,"Manhattan, NY",7,20,1,4.0,7/27/2016,"We went for Restaurant Week yesterday and were very pleasantly surprised. The RW menu was prominently framed in the window outside, and it was at the both place settings on our table. The portions for every course were large, unlike those at some restaurants that participate.We absolutely HAD to get the Thick Cut Bacon from the regular menu as a starter to share. It came with 2 very satisfying pieces of delicious bar bacon. A win for sure! Our waiter, Caesar was very helpful in answering questions about wine, and I had a glass of a California Cabernet Sauvignon for $8, while my friend had an Amstel. For our RW appetizers, she selected the Avocado, Shrimp Salad, Pea Shoots (great fresh citrus dressing!), and I had the Dry-Aged Meatball, Mozzarella Fondue (great quality meat and fresh parsley mixed into the salad was delicious!).For mains, I got the Berkshire Pork Porterhouse w/Fennel & Cherry Peppers - it was perfectly cooked and the basil and fennel flavors really made the dish pop. My friend ordered the Creek Stone Farms Rib Roast w.Potato Gratin. The meat was very tender and plentiful, but was a bit too salty for my taste.Dessert is the reason I am giving 4 rather than 5 stars. My friend's Chocolate Ice Box Cake was huge and dense, but not bad. My problem was with the Vanilla Panna Cotta w/Orange Sherbet I ordered. the description did not have any mention of nuts. When it arrived at the table, I  informed Cesar of my nut allergy and asked about the nut crumble. He assured me that he had confirmed with the pastry chef that there were ONLY ALMONDS in the crumble. Unfortunately, there may have been some cross contamination with Walnuts/Pecans (that I am highly allergic to). The dessert was delicious, but unfortunately, a few minutes later, the roof of my mouth and tongue started getting irritated and swelling. I informed the waiter to ensure that anyone else asking the same question would be able to avoid this awful ending!This otherwise, wonderful restaurant experience was followed by a run to Duane Reade and an immediate dose of liquid Benadryl while still waiting to pay for it in line! Hitch anyone?",1,,

Honestly, amazing. I went here for nye and honestly it has been one of my favorite ways to ring in the new year. And the restaurant did not raise the price for the special occasion which was A+. They even came around with a cart thirty minutes before midnight with an assortment of nye hats and noise makers. Really adorable. I've done the wine dinner only here and have never been disappointed. A definite must!",,,
133,Kenny L.,"New York, NY",126,307,294,5.0,8/19/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week dinner and extremely delighted with the experience. We were seated in a section under Roberto and Emile and very lucky we were because they are phenomenal waiters. Our cups were refilled frequently and they weren't pushy for our orders. Starting off with appetizers, outside the RW menu, thick cut bacon was super delicious and moist, but highly overly salty. It serves maybe 3 comfortably, so 2 is ample for a large party to sample. Fries were disappointing, not worth trying, although one order serves 7. From the RW menu, it was shrimp avocado salad, bacon BLT, meatball with mozzarella fondue cover, heirloom tomatoes over focaccia. Bacon with the BLT was honey glazed and crispy. Meatball was large and rich with tomato flavor. The focaccia came with peaches slices, it was so refreshing. Overall, delectable and pleasant. Entrees were the delectable porterhouse, rib roast, and tuna. Porterhouse was so thick and juicy. Excellent size and sauce serving. Rib roast was tasty, although smaller serving. It was 2 thin-medium slices coupled with a nice slice of layered potato. Tuna was excellently seared plus coupled with tartar. Plus, adding in wine will add a low $8, bringing RW dinner to $50. Very worth it, Roberto helped with suggesting a savory white wine. Finally, dessert consisted of thick chocolate cake, coconut cake, and I pannacotta. The chocolate cake was so decadent, you need to let it rest in your mouth to appreciate the mix of chocolates and then appreciate the thickness. Coconut cake was light, fluffy, right sweetness, but the side of passionfruit puree was too tart. Pannacotta was perfect to close the night with its lightness and palette cleansing smoothness. Throughout dinner, Roberto and Emile were attentive. Although there were some hiccups with our orders, Roberto more than made up with it with complementary foods. We really appreciate the thoughtfulness, super thankful for the chance to enjoy plenty of food. Maloney and Porcelli is a definite place to return to enjoy high quality meats, exceptional service, and delicious desserts. We look forward to our next dinner date reservation, and will do so in Roberto and Emile's section. Absolutely splendid.",,,

They easily accommodated us and there was no wait. We all choose the wine dinner special since it was such a great deal. It use to be only weekdays in the beginning, but now it's everyday after 8pm. And you can choose from their full menu for appetizer and entrees. For appetizer, I had the colossal lump crab which was great! My friends all had different appetizers and enjoyed their dishes as well. I had their rib steak medium rare. Rib steak is basically rib eye with the bone. It wasn't the best rib eye I had. Need a bit more seasoning I felt. But it hard to go wrong with a nice cut if beef. As for the wine, you can have all four types of wine or just stick to the ones you like. Either way, you'll be nicely buzzed by the end of the night. I should definitely mention service is alway too notch here. That's why they get my 5 stars.",,,

140,Rick H.,"Flushing, NY",1,11,0,4.0,12/19/2015,"I had never heard of this place until our vendor invited us to dinner to celebrate the holidays.  The place was packed on a recent Thursday night, with the bar at least three people deep.  My pre-dinner Manhattan was adequate, though the '70's-esque thick plastic stirrer (you know, the long, rectangular ones with the ball on one end), while reminiscent of my parent's cocktail parties when I was a child, was a nuisance.We started out with a couple of mixed seafood towers...the west coast oysters were good and the shrimp were quite large and fresh.  The crab and lobster were less inspiring.  The pretzel-like bread sticks were a nice treat.However, the dry-aged prime rib steak was outstanding.  It was a rather large cut, well seasoned and cooked to an absolutely perfect medium-rare.  It melted in my mouth, with no grizzle.  The sides were decent, if typical.Our vendor treated us to some Caymus cab, which was the perfect accompaniment.If you are all about the steak, then I would recommend M&P.",,,

The croutons were all crumbled in the top, which was odd to me. The lobster bisque was really good and had nice sized pieces of lobster. I sampled a filet that my wife had, and that's what I should have ordered. It was great and cooked as ordered. The service was good. The servers are attentive, but not all up in your business.

I would've really liked to stay and enjoy the ambience more! Food in general (minus the following exception) is good but not memorable. You could get tastier stuff for a better price, but that might've just been the RW menu. Straight up, I do not like coconut. It's not a strong hatred, but it for sure is not positive. This place has a coconut cake that turned my taste buds upside down! I was so full from the previous entree and thought I really couldn't eat any more but that cake... coconut haters, give this baby a chance. You won't regret it.

144,Siri C.,"Frisco, TX",52,225,0,4.0,1/23/2015,"Let me start by saying this place deserves 5 stars for service. The food, however, is more of a 4, so I gave it 4 stars.I came here for a work dinner and I have to say service was on point. All the waiters were super friendly and super helpful. Our water glasses were constantly filled as well as our wine glasses. Since the restaurant is known for their pork shank, but not everyone wanted to order their own pork shank, the waiter had a good idea of ordering one for the table and cutting it up.  I have to say that I didn't love the pork, but it may have been because I got quite a fatty piece and I'm not a fan of the fat. Other appetizers we ordered included the gnocchi, crab cakes and veal meatballs. All were good and after appetizers I was pretty much full.For entree I ordered the Angry Lobster. I asked the waiter if they could de-shell it for me. He said that for presentation it comes in the shell, but it's cracked and they give you a tiny fork to pull out the meat. Honestly, I still struggled with the lobster, but one waiter did show me how I was supposed to use my forks (one holds it down, the other pulls out the meat) and another offered to help me. In the end I ended up taking half of it home, partly because I just couldn't pull out the meat, partly because I was already full from the appetizers. I did ask if they could pack it up WITHOUT the shell which they kindly did. Also with dinner we ordered the creamed spinach and the tater tots. Both were good though I could only fit a few bites into my stomach.Finally for dessert (because I couldn't resist), I tried each of the ice cream flavors. The $100,000 bar was by far my favorite (don't worry, all 3 flavors of ice cream are only $10), but all 3 flavors were good. They also come served on a brownie. I apparently don't have this separate stomach everyone has for dessert, but I wish I did so I could have finished everything it was so delicious.The restaurant was a little loud so it was hard to hear any conversation that wasn't right next to you, but overall it's a nice setting and I would recommend giving it a try.",2,1,

146,Cyrus C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",41,49,5,1.0,1/2/2015,"I came here for company dinner mid-November and it was awful. Steak medium is microwave-d 30secs to less red. Salmon is served cold and not a bit warm. The very least it could have done was place it on a steam table. Something similar to an American Choice can of tuna. Beef Wellington was a joke with some viscous cream puff. The cocktail shrimp, I might have had maybe about 5 or 6 of them.Thank god I only live like 30 mins away, because when I got home I made several trips to the John.Take your time and money elsewhere, certainly did left an impression.",2,1,1
147,Vadim B.,"Manhattan, NY",28,35,0,1.0,11/22/2015,"You wouldn't believe what happened...1. Hats off to one of our servers, Owen, who tried to remedy the situation and deliver the quality service we were expecting. Thank you.2. Now, repeat after me: ""I refuse to spend top dollar on dining experience and receive the worst imaginable service""My review isn't food related; the food was in line with my expectations, good, not great; But we came here with a company of 14 to celebrate a birthday of our dear friend which turned out to be quite disastrous.I must admit, I don't know the name of the waiter, the very same culprit that ruined our evening; it was an Asian gentleman in his late 40s - perhaps I go too far by calling him a gentleman.They sat 10 of us down while we were still waiting for our remaining four guests. It is fairly reasonable understanding in this town to expect some level of service before the entire party shows up, so we've asked this fellow to see the menus and perhaps get some wine and cocktails prior to dinner. This is the brief synopsis of the dialogue that went: A: ""I cannot pour wine until everyone is here""Q: ""I'd like to see the menu and perhaps order few cocktails; we didn't expect you to pour anything nor did we order wine yet""A: ""Why do you need to see the menu; like you don't know what you're going to order""Let me pause for a second and explain; we all have seen the rough-around-the-edges type of a waiter who is abrupt but means well and strives to deliver quality of service; this guy wasn't it; he intentionally went on to be rude an obnoxious for the next 10 minutes while we were speaking to his counterpart and maître-d to figure out the situation.As we learned, supposedly there is a wine dinner special that includes certain amount of courses and unlimited wine. Now it is all clear why this guy is being obnoxious, he is approaching out table with the expectation that we're here with some evil plan to take advantage of the special and potentially empty up their wine cellar. It becomes VERY clear that without our knowing he is implying that at a fixed rate everyone gets something expensive and there is no need for us to see the menu ahead of time and he isn't going to serve the wine before we place the order. I wouldn't go into further logistics of the nasty conversation that took place over the next 15 minutes but as you may imagine this attitude would ruin everyone's mood; instead of good quality birthday fun.Relatively eager to please maître-d took the position that we were NOT supposed to be treated this way and he will get us a different waiter who will serve us best. However, while we were introduced to a different waiter the other guy was still lurking around our table and assisting with bringing out our dishes. I'm fairly certain that he had one purpose that evening, that is to make our dinner horrible. I'm pretty sure he must've spat in our dishes or did something behind the scene to diminish our experience. Before this major rant gets out of control I'd like to address the management of this place.Dear sir/Madame, While you may not care about an occasional negative review, you absolutely have no idea of what's going on in your establishment. Your staff lacks training and most of all basic people's skills. Such experiences, as expressed above, directly reflect on your expertise and ability to manage a high-end establishment, which unfortunately isn't great.Please take an effort to show that you care and have an occasion conversation with your staff in hopes that no one again has to go through the similar experience in the future.As for me, I will never visit another Michael Stillman's restaurant again and go on to promote my experience to my colleagues and friends that visit so many of your restaurants in the NYC area and beyond.Be well, and take care.An unsatisfied customer.",5,2,

My. God. This stuff was like crack!  I almost picked up the dish and licked it clean!  For dessert, we had the Zoot Suit Crème Brulee and the chocolate cake.  Both were amazing, but after all the other food and countless refills of our wine, we just couldn't finish them.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the service here.  Any time we were low on water or had an empty dish on our table, there was someone there to take care of it.  Our server, Russ (?), was great.  He pointed us in the right direction on every course, and made sure we never ran out of wine.  As we were finishing up, and the restaurant was emptying, he came over and chatted with us for a bit.  The manager came by to make sure we were happy with everything, and even gave Russ permission to have a shot of Jameson with me!  The return to our hotel was celebrated by slipping into a food coma, and the hangover I had the next day, as I was being touristy and walking across the bridge, was absolutely excruciating, but it was all worth it for such a wonderful dining experience!",4,2,2
155,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401,4.0,3/9/2015,"Time to close off restaurant week with class - if you're looking for amazing steak and great service, this is where it is at.  We made a reservation for 7:30PM on a Friday and it was packed.  The bar was filled with chatty men in suits and the tables were full of couples, friends, and families.  The light was very dim and the entire place was lit by individual candles covered by a lamp-shade, I'm assuming to dim the brightness of the flame.  The décor is nice - dark wood and brass embellishments everywhere, along with statutes of animals like fish and lamb (my friend jokingly said: ""It's all the animals they serve on the plate!"").Their restaurant week menu was pretty good with a lot of variety for your seafood lovers and meat lovers.  Unfortunately, no vegetarian option but a good choice of meats.  They started us off with soft, thin breadsticks and honey mustard butter (which was amazing).  For my appetizer, I had the shrimp cocktail - three jumbo sized shrimps resting in ice with half a lemon on side and cocktail sauce, along with a spicier sauce, but too spicy for my taste.  The shrimp was so fresh and tasty!  Mostly everyone around us ordered the prime rib-eye, which was also very delicious.  It is not a huge slab of steak, but rather two medium-sized pieces that were cooked and flavored very well.  The accompanying potatoes were all the rave at my table because they were nice and toasted on the outside but soft on the inside.  And for dessert, I had to get their chocolate ice box cake.  It was a pretty good-sized dessert.  Laying in dark chocolate syrup and topped with a meringue just made this rich dessert just a great ending.  Overall, the meal was very hearty but there was very good portion size.  The presentation was certainly plain but not lacking in the flavor factor.  The service was also very good as well.  For some reason, they did accidentally charge my friend $15 for her beet salad, which was included in the menu, but made quick amends.  Also- their bathroom is strangely placed in their basement (sitting on the top floor means going down two flights), but it's clean and it has a couch for you and your food baby after!  Haha.",,,

Updated review","Redemption! Last year I posted a negative review about this restaurant but after the new general manager, Leonard Lorusso, assured me that if we gave them another shot we would be well served. Well I'm pleased to say that last nights dining experience was OUTSTANDING! Our table for 16 was ready on-time, Alfredo and the wait staff were on point, food awesome, wine exceptional.Leonard, Jeff, Bernard, Alfredo - Well done!",1,,
160,YH P.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,19,1,4.0,3/16/2015,"Usually I try to stay away from restaurant week because of the small portions of mediocre food... But wow! Did this place prove me wrong!I came here with my girlfriend for a surprise birthday dinner after work and this place had the perfect atmosphere for a Friday night out. The restaurant was warmly lit and filled with a good mixture of couples, coworkers and families all cheerily laughing and having a good time. The food here was surprisingly satisfying for restaurant week. They started us off with their warm straight from the oven pretzel breadsticks served with honey mustard butter. I could have had a whole meal with just that and my girlfriend would tell you that I did!My girlfriend ordered the shrimp cocktail for appetizer and those three shrimp were the largest shrimp I've ever seen!! I ordered the beef cappracio which was good but not as good as the shrimp. For the main course I had the perfectly cooked ribeye with roasted potatoes. The meat was tender and the potatoes were crunchy. It was a little on the salty side but it was delicious. My girlfriend got the lamb with a side of apple sauce. At first I thought it was a weird combination but the tender lamb which fell right off the bone along with the sweet and tangy apple sauce  were like heaven in my mouth! For desert I had to get back at my girlfriend since she's obviously ordered the better two dishes that night. I took a chance by ordering the coconut cake while she ordered the chocolate cake. That coconut cake was the perfect ending to the perfect meal! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and it really hit the spot. We finished every last drop of it! Definitely need to find the recipe! The chocolate cake on the other hand was bitter for some reason. Good thing we had that coconut cake though.",,,

There aged ribeye is absolutely amazing as is there pork shank.The service is impeccable and professional, But I would say that they could use a little bit of laughter and humor in the service.The prices are not cheap but the quality of the food is amazing.

162,Mitch P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",2,3,0,5.0,5/1/2014,"I had a great time.  I went for a birthday celebration and had the $79.99 deal.  The first thing that surprised me was the fact that they allowed us to get anything off the menu.  Literally anything. I started with the oysters which were fine.  As a big oyster guy I was satisfied with the size and flavor of them.  Next I went with the porterhouse for 2, and split it with my friend.  The steak was great, but the best part was the marrow that the provided.  All and all i probably had $100 worth of wine to go along with the delicious food.  Definitely got my moneys worth.The best part of the whole experience was Miguel, our waiter.  The guy was on fire.  He was incredibly helpful describing the menu items, and was always around when anyone from my large group needed anything.  Next time I go back I will request him by name, and I recommend you guys do as well.  He was the man.Thanks to everyone there, it was awesome.",3,,2
163,Christine K.,"Flushing, NY",99,75,0,2.0,7/22/2014,"My review is focused solely on the Restaurant Week menu. I had the Diver Scallops on chowder, filet mignon (medium rare), the chocolate ice box cake, and a glass of the cabernet wine. The scallops on chowder was good, nothing amazing. But I have to say I was sorely disappointed with the entree and dessert. The filet mignon did come out cooked to order, but it was very chewy, veiny, and did not have much taste to it. I have had both buttered and regular filet mignons before, but this really just did not hit the spot. I actually got tired of eating it and didn't even finish. I had hoped the dessert would make up for it, as I love chocolate cake. However, again, I was disappointed. It was rich, but it was neither fluffy or the brownie like texture. It was very odd. Again, I took a few bites, but did not feel compelled to finish eating it. Maybe others will have better luck with the restaurant week menu here, but my sister and I did not enjoy it at all. You might have better luck just ordering off the regular menu here since it seems like they did not pay much attention to the restaurant week dishes. The service was good, so my rating is based solely on the quality and taste of the Restaurant Week menu food items.",2,,

167,David H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,2.0,11/25/2015,"I made a reservation asking for a table in a quiet spot, but when we were seated we were given a table right next to the wait staff station right in the middle of the restaurant. The host obviously did not read my request or they simply just don't care. Not to mention the restaurant was mostly empty at the time. However, they did accomadate our request to be seated in a booth instead so we were thankful for that.Overall the prices did not justify the dining experience. The waiter was nice but just there to do the job at the minimal level. He obviously cared way more about a family that sat next to us who were probably old customers. The pork shank was good but I would disagree with other yelpers who said this is the best in NYC. David Burke Kitchen makes one that blows this out of the water. The food was overall good here but again, the prices, service, and environment (restrooms feel like they haven't been updated since the 80's) do not make me want to come back.",1,,
168,Patricia O.,"Manhattan, NY",2,43,2,2.0,8/23/2016,"The food is pretty good and plentiful. However, it comes out too fast, at least at the ""unlimited"" wine tasting dinner. Big problem is the word ""unlimited"" has a clear definition, except at M&P, or at least under the guidance of our stern waitress. God forbid you ask for a refill while you are still eating dessert. We were told they were not supposed to pour after dinner. I pointed out that dessert was included in their definition of dinner, since it is part of the three-part dinner offering, and we still had plenty of dessert left to go. She then said they were not supposed to pour after the last course had been served. If they were going to define ""limited"" in that way,  they should damn well make that clear from the get go. No, we weren't looking to stay all night and we're not 20-somethings looking to get boozy at an all you can drink brunch; but grown-ups looking to enjoy a Friday night evening out. Enjoying wine throughout the course (and all the courses) of our dinner seemed like a reasonable expectation. She did (grudgingly) pour me another glass; my companion not so lucky. A complaint to the manager got us an extra glass. If we return, we will ask for better pacing. Also, some really tacky, loud people better suited to one of the nearby Irish dives helped diminish the experience. Restaurants -- not just this one -- are purporting to offer a certain kind of experience to guests, and at this price point they should try to create an atmosphere of civility and subtly underscore it. Otherwise, it undermines the experience of other guests. Restaurants should not be afraid to wean themselves from inappropriate guests. There are plenty of people willing to pay for the experience they have been ""promised.""",2,,

Small aside, when I asked how the filet mignon was prepared the server plainly stated ""get a ribeye, that's the move"". I can't decide if it was a little too ballsy, or just enough balls.

But that aside, the Crackling Pork Shank is all it's cracked up to be - a   most amazing dish. The combination on insanely moist braised pig and incredibly crispy flash fried skin is irresistible. Also amazing - the Bronson steak. Cause how couldn't a steak named for Charles Bronson be great.  Sort of steak dianey but less creamy, spicier and with peppers. Or maybe that's a bad description.

185,Chris S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,0,4.0,3/12/2016,"I've been coming to Malony & Porcelli's for 10 years, it's my favorite steakhouse in Midtown mostly because it feels like a local place as opposed to one of the corporate steak houses in midtown.  The steaks and seafood are top of the line as you'd expect, but the menus also has a variety of other non-conventional options such as the crackling pork shank, chicken parm and a veal shank saltimbocca for 2 which is great for an outing with your significant other.I also like the layout of the restaurant, they have an island bar in the middle and tables surrounding, with the ceiling extending up to the second floor.  The high ceiling makes it feel very open, and the bar in the middle of the room makes the atmosphere lively.The one other highlight is the servers are consistently upbeat and energetic, and make you feel like you're the only table they're waiting on.  The only attribute of Maloney and Porcelli's that feels like every other steak house is the bill.  But that's pretty standard for top-of-the-line steak houses in mid-town Manhattan.",,,

Because they felt bad that they were out of the original order, they gave us more shrimp! We also ordered cocktails to go with our appetizers, but again, they were out of the whiskey my husband ordered, so, they gave us wine on the house and was very generous with my husband's other choice of whiskey. For the main entree, we ordered the Colorado Braised Lamb and the Creekstone Prime rib with 2 sides of creamed spinach and button mushrooms. I'm very particular about how my lamb is cooked, but Maloney did an exceptional job! The prime rib was amazing as well. Creamed spinach was good, but I would recommend the button mushrooms! For dessert, we ordered the sorbet and ice cream and the coconut cake. The sorbets were a bit too tart for our liking but the coconut cake was soft, moist and delicious!

With other places but you need to seriously book places 2 weeks in advance sometimes! Here, my bf reserved a spot for 2 a few days in advance, for prime time, 8pm on a Wednesday and had no problems. Originally, we had Thurs for 8 with no problems, and then switched it to Wed. Check!When we arrived, the house was pretty full though. Note this is your business dinner place, not a date place. I mean, yeah I knew that I still got some raised eyebrows from the outfit I was wearing from the 60+ crowd. Not that I was wearing anything inapprops, just a peach sundress! Anyway, the decor is somewhere between a steakhouse and old American diner. Nothing to rave home about, but the booth we got was spacious and the bathrooms nice and clean. The bread at the table was a sliced, warm loaf of pretzel bread (it wasn't pretzel, but tasted eggy and soft, similar to pretzels), and these big, house made tortilla chips.. or more like just fried tortillas. The butter mixture had mustard in it- so for that, I wasn't a fan (hate mustard). But, I guess that furthers my pretzel bread thesis. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. Our waiter told us it was $24 originally, which we knew was wrong (it's $35 for the dinner 3 course) but he came by around minutes later to correct us. I would come back to try the regular menu as I'm told the pork chop is their known staple. I had: 1. Corn Bisque with Lobster Fritters 2. Halibut with Summer Risotto 3. Sour Cherry CrispThe corn bisque must have had strained corn juice because there no pieces of corn but it was really good. Not very creamy like most bisques. Still very flavorful though. They'll put fresh pepper in it which was nice. The lobster fritters were yummy- packed with lobster and corn. It was indeed fried (like a hush puppy) but didn't taste overly greasy. The halibut was the best part of my meal. I'm surprised at a steakhouse doing a delicate fish so well. The halibut was flaky but not overdone so had a good texture to it, still. It was simple and not seasoned much but had great natural flavor (just a bit pan roasted), and atop a DELICIOUS creamy risotto. Risotto was buttery, with nice veggies, and corn pieces. The sour cherry crisp had merit, but it was on the crumbly side- meaning it was a bit drier than I was expecting. But, that doesn't mean it was bad. I was expecting more goo. There was a lot of fun stuff in it- crumble, REAL (not canned) sour cherries, chocolate pieces, and nuts. A must-try. Coincidentally, I saw a gf dining here at the same time (shout out to Buo Z) and she said the coconut cake was really good. She also said she had the surf and turf and the lobster tail was dry... ok enough reviewing for other people lol. My bf had: 1. The house green salad2. The filet mignon (10 oz I think), medium rare3. The trio of sorbetsThe house green salad was a bed of fresh, nutty, mesculin greens. The dressing a light, sweet balsamic. It was simple and plain- definitely a DIY salad but my bf's on a diet. It came with one slice of a beefsteak tomato.... juicy. The steak I didn't try- yes, I always take heat at steakhouses because I don't eat steak. My bf said it was good though- not the best he's ever had but not bad. He's a ""ribeye guy"", quote. He was a fan of the steak sauce though which was smoky and sweet. I did try this a bit.The sorbets were good, palette cleansers- again with the diet theme. There was coconut, peach and blueberry. All good representations of the flavors. Service was fast (I mean, FAST!). I mean it's RW so they have everything ready to go but I think our whole meal took like an hour and 15! Our waiter was really charismatic and nice- and he didn't look down upon us when we didn't order wine.Interesting part: My bf didn't order any sides for his steak, because of the diet theme. A waiter (not our waiter, who is a nice Australian guy) came by to give us two sides- the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. He said, ""Aw, your steak looks so lonely."" We were weirded out for a moment because really, it wasn't a money thing, we just didn't want any sides (well my bf didn't, I'm pretty down with creamed spinach and mashed p's). But we took them anyway. And they were good! The creamed spinach, especially, which was buttery, and creamy, and had finely chopped spinach and broccoli (!). The mashed potatoes were great too- with chopped chives, and black pepper. They were the creamy kind, not the chunky kind. When the bill came, we figured the sides would not be on there, but it was. Awkward! We told our waiter and he apologized and correct it. They weren't cheap- $11 each. My gf told me they gave her free sides too, so I guess it's all in good spirit.He got a nice tip.",4,4,2
194,Tracy N.,"Raleigh, NC",16,22,17,4.0,4/8/2014,"I just attended an event there last night in the beautiful Skylight Room and was quite impressed. The hors d'oeuvres I had were delicious and creative--especially the miniature beet pie. Dinner was quite good too. The house salad and whipped mashed potatoes were fine but nothing to write home about. But the 10 oz filet was outstanding--tender and cooked perfectly. The wood oven tart was okay--I thought the apples could have been cooked a little more. That could just be a personal preference though.The one off-note of the evening? This high-end restaurant served a small mug of hot water with a Lipton tea bag when I asked for tea instead of coffee after dinner. Most places bring you a small teapot with a couple choices of, at least, a mid-priced grocery store brand to choose from. I'm sure coffee drinkers won't care, but it was just so out of sync with the restaurant's upscale image I think it's worth noting.As for service, wine glasses were refreshed before they ran low and service overall was impeccable.",1,,

199,Floria K.,"Cambridge, MA",2,50,13,5.0,9/3/2016,"I am usually hard to please when it comes to steak houses and restaurants in general for that matter. However, I am from Texas where I think we get a pretty good steak. Well, this is apparently, not true. In NY this past week I took the advice of a former New Yorker and took a long train ride and a short cab ride from NJ, (where I had been completing some corporate training) and pulled up to a lovely, old world,and elegantly appointed restaurant where I had probably one of the best bone in Ribeyes I may ever have. The service was also impeccable and better than anything I have experienced in a Texas restaurant (Trulucks is a distant second) The ambience and restaurant lighting, (something I always complain about, is perfect here and provided a warm glow that made me want to linger for awhile aftet dinner. Good company and amazing food made for an overall great experience and I will now plan to come back as soon as possible with the husband and we will make a weekend of it. This is where we will have dinner. Awesome meal, and thanks again Ashley, for making the tourists feel right at home. You are great at your job.",,,
