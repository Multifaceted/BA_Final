0,bianca b.,"New York, NY",11,21,16,5.0,7/7/2017,Hosted my moms birthday party here and it was awesome. Owners are very professional and welcoming. It is a very intimate environment. The food is good for bar food. We have also visited on several other occasions and always enjoy.,,,
1,Courtnwy T.,"East Bronx, NY",25,47,44,4.0,10/8/2016,"Like most of the spots I've visited, I went here for  after work drinks on a Friday. We arrived around 4:30pm. There were several employees standing outside, waiting for the owner to park so that they could open the spot. We waited patiently for them to do so. Once we got inside, we were given free drinks for the wait.It was a prebirthday celebration for me, so the owner n gave me two free birthday shots. The drinks were really good! Owner was very friendly and interacted with all patrons. There was a dj that played really good music. I had a great time. I will definitely return!",3,,
2,Bianca W.,"Rockland County, NY",6,22,2,4.0,1/16/2017,I visited here recently for the first time. I didn't know it was a makeshift bar .  I was a little turned off by this but it was a regular bar. I had a great time. Dress casual/ cute drinks are on the pricey side in these little ass cups. They got hookah which was good. I didn't get to try the food but it smelled good. There's no parking in this area and it closes early. I would recommend and go back again! I'd get some alcohol before going inside and drinking some then maybe buy a drink or get hookah.,3,2,
3,Sha C.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,4,4.0,10/20/2016,"Came here for a get together . The food and atmosphere was good.. drinks okay , I had ask for a rum punch they had on the menu and the bar tender informed me they didn't have all the ingredients that was required for the drink smh. That was def not a good look . Other then that it was okay",2,1,1

5,Adriel Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,4.0,3/4/2016,Very nice and warm environment. Sweet place for an evening drink. Nice area in the basement for private parties. Very good wings.,1,,1
6,P S.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,4/11/2016,"I attended a birthday party at Studio 735 located in Upper Harlem this past Saturday and the unprofessionalism I encountered by the owner of ths establishment was absolutely reprehensible. He moved tables away from paying patrons while their drink and food servings were still on the table and answered with an attitude with some very disparaging remarks when he was asked a question. Not to mention when ordering food services, it took over an hour before we were served. The only reason I am giving this establishment one star is because the security (Gary) was extremely friendly and personable. In fact, he was so cordial and attentive that I had mistaken him to be the owner. Also, the bartender (Lauren) was very professional. I was impressed with the decor upon entering, to the point where I actually going to rent and reserve for future, upcoming events, but professionalism can and will go a long way, and I will never (along with my party of 40 others) patronize this establishment again.PC",7,1,
