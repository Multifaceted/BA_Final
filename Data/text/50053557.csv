0,Rich B.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,32,113,3.0,10/15/2018,"I've picked up lunch from Lenwich dozens of times over the four years that I've worked around the corner.  Overall, it's a pretty reliable sandwich spot, with a huge variety of sandwich combinations, and a few salads (although you won't find me eating the latter).While I've tried most of the 'All-Time Favorites', I typically stick to the same few these days.  I really enjoy the classic 'Lenwich', consisting of pastrami and corned beef, Emma's, which combines ham and turkey, and the TC, which is nearly identical to the Lenwich but with turkey instead of pastrami.  All of the above, which almost always come out tasting fresh and flavorful, also come with coleslaw and Russian Dressing - appears I just discovered a pattern in my eating habits!However, I do not only stick to coleslaw and Russian dressing sandwiches with a revolving door of cold cuts.  Mikey's, which has grilled steak and cheese, is usually pretty good too.  However, at times the meat has been tough.  I also had a rough experience with the Buffalo Chicken sandwich before.  While it was very tasty the first couple times I had it, the last time it almost tasted like I was eating frozen chicken that had not been thoroughly heated - yuck.  Had to throw that one out.I should also mention that if you order in the store during peak hours, be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes, sometimes up to 30.  I try to come right at noon for lunch, before the crowds get crazy.  I'll be back to Lenwich quite a few times in the future, so long as there is one near me.",1,1,1

2,Dane B.,"Arverne, NY",87,16,27,4.0,6/27/2018,"Sunshine Salad! One of the tastiest salads I've ever had! There was Kale, quinoa, smoked turkey, beets, walnuts, blue cheese, corn and apple and honey balsamic dressing. Yes it all tastes as good as it sounds. Everything was fresh.

4,Reese B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,2,2.0,4/30/2018,"Basically i saw the reviews and a friend was soooo hungry she thought maybe its just people being negative, i didnt argue it and went. The sandwiches looks delicious but theyre not. I have no idea how a sandwich can taste like nothing.The cashiers are ridiculous. I asked the young lady if they build sandwiches because i wanted the emma but minus the second choice of meat or extra and the same bread and with another substitution, her blank stare alone had me pissed me when i was asking the simplest things and all she kept repeating was you want the emma?, i told her no i dont want that a bunch of times asked again do they build sandwiches even my friend was looking at her as if she was (sorry to say but) stupid. I got pissed again and just told her fine give me the emma take out the second meat serving and ahe asked what kind of bread do you want i said if your giving me the emma why are you asking what kind of bread when it shows it comes with white bread, i got pissed again with her stupid stare and inability to comprehend what the heck i was saying. When she told me how much it came up too i really angry. I asked her why so much minus my friends order and decided to drop the argument for my friends sake.Sat down and ate and was disgusting , so was my friends and we ordered two different things (she had i think pastrami). I went online to find and email or number i could send a complaint to. Email was impossible because they wanted your CC number mainly for orders instead of complaints and whenever i called no one picks up. Btw online states you can build a sandwich and it was cheaper than what she charged me for. This place is fuckin ridiculous idk how theyre still open with shitty ass sandwiches that just looks good on the outside and have shitty as workers there.",,,

6,Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",842,1107,394,3.0,2/1/2016,"So I only wanted to try this place out because if you sign up for the app (which forget I even mentioned it because this app won't be available anymore) then you get a $7 credit.  Since the app is being cancelled, my credit it would have expired so I decided to give this place a shot!I wanted a simple grilled sandwich, but when I said turkey and bacon, I realized I did not enunciate properly - and the lady heard me say turkey bacon.  So I got just that, turkey bacon.  The sandwich definitely needed some more meat in there, the turkey bacon was really hard to chew.  The bread was really good, and I the only other items I got in my sandwich were brie and spinach - all good there as well.  When I went to pick up my order, the lady told me they charged me an extra $1 (I only had a $7 credit but my sandwich was $8.17 so I did have to pay something).....so they said they would just give me a refund via the app.  I have yet to see that refund btw!",5,1,1
7,Orchidee G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,2,1.0,4/3/2018,"Unfortunately, this Lenwich suffers from awful customer service. I work for the firm that orders from this Lenwich all the time - so it was really disheartening to see such a negative and unapproachable cashier yell at me in front of other customers. I ordered a sandwich (asked for no coleslaw and mayo), and I was given a pager. Once my pager went off notifying me that my food was ready, I noticed that there was coleslaw on the sandwich. The cashier proceeds to ask me to pay, without giving me a new pager or any sort of apology. I informed her that I would pay once my sandwich was ready - like how the pager went off before. She rolled her eyes, spoke in spanish to another cashier. It was evident that she wanted me to pay now, but how come everyone else pays when they go to pick up their sandwich? I asked her if she understood why I wanted to pay when my sandwich was ready. She was short, unapologetic, and frankly not helpful. This was such an awful experience that I am asking my firm not to order with this Lenwich anymore - lets take our business somewhere else where customer service matters.",,,
8,K M.,"New York, NY",85,3,4,1.0,7/1/2017,"Food here is average and the service from the cashiers is below standard. I went here once with a group of coworkers for an informal lunch meeting early before the usual Wall Street rush. When I arrived, the stanchions were being setup for the day and as a result, we were told to place our orders at another register. So we all went to the designated register to place orders. My turn to place an order finally came and when I began to ask for a salad, the cashier began asking me ""why am I here and not at the salad area, read the sign"". So of course, I explained that another worker said to come here to place orders. She asks who it was as if that's my responsibility somehow. This service was embarrassing and I'm not going to be a patron to any business where their employees speak to their customers in this way.",1,1,

Of course I enjoyed some sandwich much more than others, but so far, Lenwich is my favorite lunch sandwich place.I wish I started taking pictures and posted review earlier but, I'm planning to try as much as different sandwich possible and I will update my top 4 from now on!!! (I have not tried beef or chicken sandwich that much, so I will try them next!)1: NovacadoSpicy Nova, horseradish, cream cheese, avocado, arugula, red onion and tomatoes.Well, nothing can go wrong with lox and cream cheese. but they added avocado and horseradish!! hmmm perfect combination!! I love Novacado with their Ciabatta.2: EmmasSmoked ham and smoked turkey with Swiss cheese, coleslaw and Russian dressing.This is flavorful, nicely balanced, not greasy sandwich. (For me, ""Lenwich"" is little bit greasy and Emmas is perfect for me!!) I like Emmas with whole wheat3: Fish'wichCrispy cod filet, Cole slow, kettle chips, pickle, lettuce, tomatoes, tartar sauce on a brioche ban.Generous portion of crispy cod filet!! crunchiness from kettle chips and creamy tartar sauce. have to eat at store right away!!4: Bello MeltPortobello mushroom, crispy onion, fresh mozzarella, Basil, roasted peppers, arugula, honey balsamic dressing.Melting mozzarella, basil balsamic dressing goes well with portobello and they give strong flavor.",1,,1

12,Maxine S.,"Jamaica, NY",209,2,0,1.0,7/1/2016,"I wish I could give this location 0 stars because that is exactly what they deserve. My company has ordered lunch from this location for a long time, and each time there were flaws in the order that we simply overlooked, but this time not only was the order incorrect but the managers were completely disrespectful and unprofessional. Arguing and demanding their poorly made sandwiches back, telling us that they were not responsible. When a customer comes with a complaint, as a representative of a business, one should do what you can to mend the issue at hand, these managers did absolutely nothing but worsen the situation. This will be the last time this location receives any business from us. Judging from their previous reviews we lapsed in judgement ever giving them business. If there is any prime example of poor customer service, this was definitely it. To the managers of the Hanover location, you've done a wonderful job of tainting the reputation of the franchise. Btw.. You still messed up the new order that should have been correct.",2,,
13,Alex J.,"New York, NY",1,19,4,3.0,8/8/2016,"You can be 100% confident in the following facts about Lenwich (this location, but also any other): (1) the food is consistently tasty and they use quality ingredients; and(2) delivery orders will be late, usually very late (at least 45 minutes, sometimes much longer).",1,,
14,Rocky G.,"New York, NY",37,11,0,5.0,5/24/2017,"I don't go crazy if a staff member does not remember me or my order, even though I'm a frequent customer. However, it feels good to know that at Lenwich, the ladies always address me by my name when I come to pick up my order. It gives me the satisfaction that they at least pay attention. Which brings me to my next point about accuracy of food order and quality of food. I've never had any issues with my food order being incorrect or being undercooked or overcooked. If you're looking for great service, fast service, and quality food...Lenwich is your place.",,,
15,Scott S.,"Short Hills, NJ",4729,706,1335,2.0,2/1/2016,The breakfast sandwich was tasty and filling and killed my hangover.  What makes this cavernous place a two star is the employees.  Cashier incapable of answering a single question which appeared to be decided by committee.  I ordered sandwich and hash browns.  The girl hands me the bag and says have a nice day which would be good but I had no breakfast sandwich.  Then another committee meeting ensured to solve this intractable dilemma.  The only reason I would come back here rather than a cart is they have actual pork bacon and sausage and not that faux sausage turkey served on halal carts.  Seriously incompetence here needs to be rectified.  Also why is the place so huge it is never filled when I come in.  I may try again but I think I will regret it.  Not as good as other Lenwiches I have been to.,5,4,4
16,Joe M.,"Beacon, NY",11,72,50,4.0,12/18/2014,"What a great place. While its a bit confusing at first and the menu is super-large, once you figure out where and what to order you're home free.  I was with a group of people and every one of them loved what they ordered.  Here's what I had.....Their signature sandwich - The Lenwich. Hot Pastrami, Corned Beef, Swiss Cheese, Cole Slaw and Russian Dressing on Rye Bread. It was out of this world.  There was no skimping on the ingredients and yet it was still manageable while eating it which to me is important. (Nothing ruins my day like getting food on my tie.). You can switch up the bread or other components but why bother. This is their creation and it works. Lenny' is cafeteria-like in that there are separate stations for ordering depending on what you're getting. They offer a variety of drinks (their own branded bottled water) and chips. It also has a very New York vibe, with a TV in the dining area tuned to NY1. The only negative is that is VERY, VERY loud.",,,
17,Stuart B.,"New York, NY",1179,586,39,4.0,3/19/2014,Still a secret since they are new.  Very quiet on the weekends.  Good prompt service.  I especially like how they label their sandwhiches so you know which one is which without having to open it.  Decent bagels (a bit small compared to Leo's) but definitely a much calmer atmosphere.  Additional plus for having nice seating.My only complaint is that this location replaced Fresco which had the best breakfast sandwhiches.,1,,1
18,Danny C.,"Maspeth, NY",3,10,0,1.0,3/4/2016,"For anyone who works in the financial district, we have the unfortunate bad luck of being surrounded by really terrible options for lunch. If you are a NY'er from one of the boroughs outside Manhattan you understand that the selection of awful pizza and deli's downtown are nothing like what we find in any neighborhood outside lower manhattan. Its just the way it has always been and Lennys is no exception. This is my second time trying this place as I visited the John Street location years ago which was bad as well. I got a grilled chicken classic on a hero. The bread was ok, Mildly toasted. The chicken was brutal. Tasted like food you would leave in the microwave for too long. I dont mind paying 10 bucks a sandwich but I at least want it to taste decent. This wasnt decent. the line at 2pm was extremely inefficient. People standing around no one quite knowing whos next to order. My chicken  took about 10 minutes to put together which isnt acceptable considering it wasnt fresh. In the financial district you're expected to get in and out fast. Please look elsewhere i know I will",,,

This place is going to put a lot of local delis and lunch spots out of business. It's clean, the staff is polite and friendly (imagine that!) and the food is great. I've been here over a hundred times and they've yet to get my order wrong. Add in the app, and I'm officially a lenster (I made that up). Seriously, you can't do much better than lenwich for price, quality and speed of food preparation. Strongly recommend you try it.

22,Ted M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,11,1,1.0,2/3/2014,"This Lenny's has a LONG way to go to be as good as the one on Water Street. I waited over ten minutes for my S4 tuna wrap and the place was hardly busy. There was tuna all over the outside of the wrap, the cheese was barely melted, and there was barely any bacon in it. It was barely edible, and I paid $10. Avoid! Go to the one on Water Street. This place does not deserve your business, especially for such outrageous prices.",1,,
23,Jenny J.,"Oakwood, NY",0,6,0,1.0,7/15/2015,"This has always been my go-to spot during lunch. I usually go pretty basic - honey turkey, mozzarella on a toasted ciabatta. Sounds easy enough, right?I also tend to head over when I'm sure the lunch crowd has minimized so I wouldn't have to wait an eternity for a sandwich.Well - my whole experience and output of this location has left such a sour taste in my mouth the last four times I've gone there. I think today, I've finally learned my lesson.I've had to wait 20-25 minutes for a simple sandwich, with minimal lunch crowd. I've had to stand and watch people who walked in 15 minutes after me leave with their sandwiches and a smile on their faces.When I go up to question what the heck is taking so long, that is when they want to pretend to be concerned. Mine you, I stand right in their line of vision and they do look at me from time to time, but never bother to ask what am I waiting on until I decide to approach them.I think enough is enough. I've wasted a good chunk of my lunch break just standing around waiting for something that should take no more than 5 minutes to make. I mean, I see others who order after me, order hot food, STILL get their meals before me and within a good timeframe.So, while it is unfortunate, I think this was my last stop on this train.I'll have to head over to the Water Street location which seems to have it together.",,1,
24,Carl A.,"Staten Island, NY",0,21,0,1.0,10/31/2015,"Slowest Lenny's I've ever been to. A bunch of people working on a Saturday almost no customers 15 minute wait and counting as I stand here. Could have done a sit down restaurant instead at this rate.Time to change my review to a 1 star. After waiting 20 minutes for my ""medium"" burger or as they put it slightly pink, I received a nicely well done not a drop of any pink completely cooked burger. Also don't ask the staff anything about why it's taking so long for one burger when your one of five customers in the place unless you want a bumbling answer in almost completely non coherent English. Never again at this Lenny's. I'll go to potbelly around the block for a decent hero on a Saturday afternoon.",,,
25,Seema U.,"San Francisco, CA",359,607,636,4.0,1/13/2015,"I am surprised by the reviews, though I only had a salad so maybe their other food isn't good. I was contemplating making my own salad, but ended up getting the greek salad and adding some chicken. The chicken was surprisingly good and the ingredients in my salad were pretty fresh. Instead of the normal greek salad dressing, I had the low-fat caesar dressing which was just okay but obviously I wasn't expecting it to be like a regular casear dressing. It gets a bit pricey since they charge for all ingredients besides the lettuce/salad base, red onions, and cabbage. Given the prices and nearby competition,I would normally give them 3 stars (really a 3.5 star place from what I tried), but I am rounding up given the overwhelmingly low reviews. Food can take a little long to come out, so I would recommend sticking to salads. Not a bad option and I would definitely come back for another salad.",2,,1
26,Eva W.,"New York, NY",66,37,12,2.0,1/5/2017,"Possibly the worst Lenny's I've been to. Food is standard like their other chains, but customer service? Terrible. I placed my order and was given my buzzer. I haven't ordered here in a while so I forgot whether I had to pay first or grab my food first. I handed the buzzer over to the employee and she looked at me and said ""Miss. You need to pay."" As if I wasn't going to pay! Rude! She could have addressed or explained to me in better terms that I need to pay first then hand over the receipt to pick up my order. Not to mention the wait here is tremendously long considering the lunch hour rush. It's a shame that management doesn't train their employees better and work more efficiently.",,,1

I love Lenny sandwiches but this location is filled with irresponsible people working on their staff. 3 times I've ordered each time it's taken an hour and a half to 2 HOURS to get a single sandwich. One time the delivery guy even ""left my sandwich with someone else"" in my building. You had my apartment number but you couldn't go to my floor? You gave it to someone else instead? Why would you ever give a sandwich to anyone besides the person who ordered it. This does not happen at all locations. But this location deserves negative stars.",,,

The coffee is weak and even though they have said they'll call me when my order is ready, no one behind the counter seems to be doing much of anything or know where I am, leaving me to stand awkwardly around to try to guess which is mine.

I ordered a pastrami and when I opened it there was grease all over the bread paper and aluminum foil in which it was wrapped. Pastrami meat itself was full of tendons and seemed like they added lard or extra oil. Just disgusting. My first and last time here. And to boot inattentive and indifferent staff. A great recipe for a horrible fast food restaurant. I just don't understand how they have stayed in business for so long.   Food vendors are better than this dump.

They probably put a dime sized squirt of horseradish sauce.  Very disappointing because it looks like a very nice well run place.  Trust me for $9 you can get a much better sandwich at any of the other places within a block.  Now that I look at all the other reviews my feelings are confirmed and my trust in Yelp is again renewed.

34,Tam N.,"New York, NY",15,52,2,2.0,4/28/2014,"I like the food here (#1 on toasted ciabatta), but I'm gonna have to give this place only 2 stars due to their amateur operation. The location on John was so much better. Ever since they moved to this new location, the pipeline has been completely jacked up. The numbering+buzzer system isn't working out for them. Most of the time, there really isn't a line for you to pay after you place your order. People are just kinda standing around, and none of the workers directs traffic, so it's all a clusterf**k.To make matter worse, the person who's supposed to call out your number when it's done doesn't know to go get the sandwiches that were done from the assembly line. So your sandwiches get made, and they sit there until the call-out person feels like grabbing them. Major bottle neck.One time my colleague was given a buzzer with its number not matching his number on his receipt. When they buzzed his number, the sandwich ticket didn't match, and none of them knew what to do to resolve the problem. I think this was due to the lack of a manager or team leader on site, so no one could really call the shot. It took 4 employees and 10 minutes later, they all finally decided to give my colleague the sandwich, which was clearly his, except it didn't match the number on his receipt, thanks to the one who took the order.I know I sound like a whiny PITA right now, but this location really needs to have their pipeline figured out",1,,

The Cobb is over $10 so I would expect decent chicken. I also really like the Caprese Sandwich on toasted 7 grain. One quibble; the manager needs to train these folks better. (1) Caprese is pronounced 'ka-pray-zee' NOT 'ka-prees/caprice'. I have to repeat myself several times before the order taker gets it. (2) when I ask for 'no basil' I expect 'no basil'--today the order taker eliminated the capers instead of the basil. ""Basil' does not sound like 'capers', but then again if they can't properly pronounce 'Caprese' I guess 'basil' sounds like 'capers'. The Bello Melt is also a pretty decent sandwich.",,,

45,Alena N.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,10,3,1.0,5/16/2014,"Horrible, horrible long wait for a simple breakfast omlet. I just ordered a vegetarian omlet platter and it wasn't ready in over 10 minutes!!! I was in extreme rush, couldn't wait longer and just left without it completely pissed off on Friday morning.... This is so embarrassing and disgracing for them to be a new location. They must behave and maintain their service at top to gain crowd, but they just doing opposite... I don't understand what their manager is doing, probably sleeping somewhere on Bahamas. Hope they won't fail completely and refund the charge to my card.",,,
46,Elizabeth S.,"New York, NY",20,25,10,2.0,9/15/2015,"I placed an order for a caprese sandwich with no capers - I specifically asked the employees to ensure that no capers would be on this sandwich because I have an allergy to them. After paying for my food and returning to my office, I open my sandwich to find it loaded with capers! This is completely unacceptable. The employees here have zero consideration for the health and safety of the consumers. I will not be returning.",,,
47,Robert T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,1.0,3/20/2014,"Despite 8 (EIGHT) employees behind the counter and no line, I was handed a buzzer and forced to wait 10 min for a sandwich. There's an autistic kid in my local bodega that can run circles around this gaggle of fu@kt@rds. Oh and a sandwich and water was $13.",,1,
