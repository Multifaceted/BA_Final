0,1,11/10/2018,83,,"Covina, CA",Maya H.,193,5.0,159,"Oh Ilili, I can write poetry books and songs about you. I love you, I love you ,I love you! I am Lebanese born and raised. When I visit a new city  I look for a good Lebanese place to try. I came to Ilili after seeing all the good reviews and decided to try it out. First of all, don't order the entrees, they're not bad but they're not the best thing here and you can probably have the same ones somewhere else for cheaper. The best thing here is their mezza or appetizers. They have so many options to try from, there really is no need to get an entree. The mezza is what us Lebanese people love to eat, many reasons for that, one is because we love to enjoy multiple dishes and Lebanese mezza is pretty amazing in general. What the chefs at Ilili did was take the traditional Lebanese Mezza and elevate it to a much higher level with a twist. The word Ilili means ""tell me"" in Lebanese Arabic and let me tell you something, when you have the food here your taste buds will dance in harmony and you will be in a happy state of mind you forget the world around you exists. I am not exaggerating. My favorite Mezza dishes were the Atayef with the veal bacon, the duck shawarma, the kibbeh nayyeh and falafel. You have to, absolutely must get at least these four dishes. I will be coming back to Ilili every time I am in New York, I miss it so much I can't take it.",2
1,4,11/14/2018,1167,1,"New York, NY",Joy G.,153,4.0,786,"ilili falls into one of those categories of NYC restaurants where you should definitely go as a group so you try out more of the menu, particularly the hot/cold small dishes. The space feels less like the Nomad and more like somewhere in midtown with a cavernous dining room and more than enough space to move your chair back and listen to the person sitting next to you. This would be good for a family reunion or a work dinner - dates are better suited to the cute bar off to the side of the dining room. I loved everything I ate but definitely some more than others:- The Phoenician fries. Definitely the highlight of the meal. They sprinkled some kind of herb salt mix on top and I couldn't stop eating them. I love when fries are made extra crispy and slightly burnt, and these were that perfect level of crunchiness. - The octopus. I can't skip it if I see octopus on the menu, just because I'm curious as to how well a place does it. Having never made it before, it seems finicky to get just right. ilili's version came with squash and onion, and was so tender it tasted like a better chicken. - Brussels sprouts with grapes, fig jam, and yogurt. A unique combination that I'll try out for Thanksgiving this year. The only ingredient I didn't love so much with this were the walnuts - I'd swap almonds or pine nuts to add the crunch. - Beef shawarma. They came wrapped individually like ice cream cones so you didn't get your hands messy with the oil slicking out. Pretty ingenious. I was so stuffed by this time but I still managed a few bites - the tender beef with tahini definitely stands out. The other things we tried (but I would skip next time): - Cauliflower. Tasty but the actual cauliflower piece was very, very small for $16. Most of the dish consisted of the tahini labne at the bottom. - Hummus with jalapeño. It pains me to write this but it was just alright. The jalapeño tended to overwhelm the subtler flavor of the hummus and, again, for a $10 dish, a lot of it was just the olive oil drizzled on top. - Beef fried kibbeh. Should have eaten this as soon as it arrived but I left my particular piece sitting for too long and the whole thing was too dry. - The side of pita. The bread is always the silent killer of $$$-$$$$ restaurants - it's something that's easily overlooked but I do think it's a marker for how much a restaurant might pay attention to the smaller details. ilili's pita were very dry and stale. Our server was outstanding and I did really appreciate how fast our food came out. I want to try their fast-casual sister version, ilili Box.",7
2,,11/5/2018,269,,"San Francisco, CA",Pamela B.,3,2.0,16,"Expensive and mediocre. We had a reservation at 10pm and they didn't seat us until 10:20pm on a Friday night. I also heard other patrons upset that they weren't being seated at their reservation times. We ordered the hummus, octopus, cauliflower, and duck schwarma. The hummus was good but the rest was forgettable. The octopus smelled fishy and lacked acid and the duck schwarma was really dry. They got one extra star for the good service. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",
3,,11/17/2018,144,,"Hoboken, NJ",Kimberly M.,9,2.0,290,"A little hyped, overpriced, and underwhelming.  Most dishes are small.  Though the octopus was very good, what we tried from the rest of the menu was mediocre.  The service could have been better for this type of restaurant.  If this spot is on your list, it can probably be skipped.",1
4,5,9/6/2018,918,1,"Manhattan, NY",Darya S.,818,4.0,1900,"I came here for an event hosted by 6plus. The food was fantastic and the staff was very hospitable and attentive. The decor in the room upstairs was so sultry and Mediterranean! We got to sit on pillows on the ground or on the seats by the wall. It was just a lovely vibe that came alive with all of the people bustling throughout. I knew I had entered a special place. Food was great. I'd recommend the felafel (it's square and crunchy!), shwarma, chicken shish taouk, moussaka, and fattoush. Their food is so fresh, exotic, and delicious! Dessert was a letdown actually. There were candy bars, pistachio mousse thing, lemon semi-freddo, a very dry brownie, and baklava. If you must get dessert, I'd go for the last one.Can't wait to go back for a sit-down meal! Walking through, I couldn't help but notice the huge, inviting, sexy space that would be ideal for a group of people looking to get dressed up and wined and dined. Ilili is definitely a diamond in the Flatiron rough.",3
5,,9/24/2018,170,,"Richmond, VA",Suhan K.,305,3.0,141,"Came here last night with the gf as she loves Mediterranean food. Excited perusing the menu and reading reviews on yelp however the food is not anything special and the wait to place an order and for the food to come out was long and ridiculous. No update on the status of our food, took 10 mins to even place the order for our food but accommodating us as we were late to our reservation was nice and timely so overall 3 Stars.The food was good but for the amount your paying you expect a little more creativity and flavor in the food. Starting off with the mouhamara, it was ok. Proportions were good but a bit dry. Flavor was slightly lacking, ours maybe were made with a tad too many walnuts and was not put together to well. The warm eggplant was good. Texture cooked evenly, not too salty pared well with the scallions and molasses. The duck shawarma was good too. Wish they were wrapped in pita that was thinner to enjoy all the other flavors and sort of took away from the fish and lastly the lamb chops were a bit greasy. Cooked to a well medium rare, wish the cuts of meat weren't like 35% fat with more meat.  Overall the food was ok in relation to the prices...wish the service made up for it a bit because you do go to dine at these places to enjoy your experience but that wasn't there either. I wish I remembered the name of the gentlemen who did help our server out with taking our food orders and refilling our drinks. Otherwise our server was out of sight after the food was brought out.",
6,1,10/27/2018,85,1,"Ronkonkoma, NY",Esther L.,408,4.0,148,This is the kind of place you envision when you're younger as a spot that you'll go to when you've made it in some sort of way. This bar/restaurant is very chic and when you're here you feel like you've done something right in your life. Take someone here if you're looking to impress.,1
7,2,10/21/2018,155,,"Central Islip, NY",Nina C.,983,4.0,441,"I love everything about this atmosphere.  The restaurant has such a classy but yet laid back vibe to it.  The food is incredible.  It's such a nice spot to have drinks with friends where you can lounge on the couches or at the bar or sit at tables and eat.  I thought the bathrooms were different yet weird.  You walk into a big room and they have sliding doors to a tiny stall that have a sink and toilet inside and men and women are both waiting to use.  It's kinda awkward.  The downfall, those prices though --- YIKES!",4
8,1,8/19/2018,157,,"Manhattan, NY",Mary C.,591,3.0,275,"Ilili was a 3.5. The service is impeccable but I thought the food was just average, and there was nothing about the restaurant that made me want to go back for.My dining partner and I split the jalapeño hummus, octopus salad, and fries. For entrees, he ordered lamb and I ordered the chicken.The hummus had too much olive oil in it that made my stomach feel sick afterwards. The pita bread with the hummus was delicious though -- fluffy, warm, and soft. The fries were also pretty good. The octopus salad was whatever; it tasted flavorless. The chicken entree also tasted bland and burnt. I think the lamb was a little better.Overall, I had high expectations, and while the service was amazing, the food didn't deliver.",4

Sometimes nice restaurants don't always put out their best dishes for restaurant week, but everything we ate was delicious.The number one plus was that each person got to choose 2 appetizers. WINNING. Between 4 people we were able to try 8 appetizers! They had falafel, mousaka, hummus, salad, everything! It was a great variety of apps and all of them were great.3 people got the lamp chops and I got the salmon. All very tasty and well cooked. As for dessert, I got the cheesecake which was kind of a deconstructed cheesecake, but nonetheless delicious. The chocolate candy bar was also very rich and good.The poison margarita was also a big hit! Restaurant was huge and had a great ambiance.",2

It's been a while since I have Lebanese food (like 5 years omg so sad) this place really Delivered. My favorites: Chicken taouk with sumac garlic sauce Fresh baked bread Hummus with pine nuts The wildfire drink Also although I didn't try it the mousakka I hear from my mother in law that it was amazing and star of her dinner.,
12,,8/17/2018,177,,"Manhattan, NY",Sherry J.,573,3.0,136,"My friends and I came for restaurant week. Our waiter seated us and then explained how the food would be coming out as it was ready. We expected each course to come out much faster but it was pretty standard timing. I guess it was because the restaurant was busy. We actually had to ask the waiter to check on our entrees because a while had passed. Dishes:(Pita bread for the table)Appetizers:- Hommus (kind of sour)- Fattoush (so sour my friend could not finish her dish, comes with sumac lemon vinaigrette)- Steak tartare (does not come in pieces, my friend described the texture as 'like eating butter', I definitely wouldn't get this again)- Moussaka (sort of like eating eggplant that was cooked in a pasta sauce)- Falafel (this was really good! Probably the best appetizer)- Arnabeet Mekle (the cauliflower was great, the tahini was really good but a little sour)- Tuna Tartare (probably the second best appetizer)Mains:- Salmon a La Plancha (really good, the salmon was soft and delicate, the skin was crunchy and my favourite part)- Diver Scallops (very soft and tasty)- Lamp Chops (very well done, not tough at all, definitely try it!)Desserts:- Ilili Candy Bar (my favourite part of the meal. It's very sweet!)- Labne Cheesecake (the cucumber sherbet was not bad but not great either)What I noticed is that most of the appetizers were sour in some way. This is not something I particularly liked.The dishes got better as they progressed; I didn't like my appetizer, my main was ok and the dessert was the best. The service was really great. Our water glasses were never empty, our leftovers were packed quickly and everyone was friendly.",
13,10,11/1/2018,3909,6,"Long Island, NY",Joi B.,1274,2.0,1738,"Mediterranean food is one of my favorite kinds of cuisine and we eat it frequently because my partner can get meaty things and I can get vegan things. Although it seems the best hummus and falafel is often served at modest fast casual places, I do like venturing out and trying restaurants with ambiance, especially for dinner. Ilili is close to where I work and I was sold on making a reservation as soon as I saw the photos featuring soaring ceilings and ambient lighting. Unfortunately, it was a total miss for us from the moment they sat us in that forgettable side room that made me feel I was in some kind of event tent. Why seat your reservations in what is clearly an afterthought room? There were some service errors that you wouldn't expect at this price point, also considering how many different people serve your table. When the first person came over to ask what kind of water we wanted, I figured that was a good sign and that we'd be expertly attended to. Not quite. Our main server was nice enough but pretty absent throughout the meal. We placed an order for the Phoenician fries as an app while we pored over the list of small plates, as well as some drinks. The drinks arrived but the fries didn't. Next thing we knew, all of the small plates were on the table (too quickly. Give us some time to enjoy our drinks and eat those fries that never came). Being that I'm all about hot sauce, namely harissa, I asked for it, as it looked like the only accompanying sauce was tahini with the falafel. Good thing I did because I found the falafel to be dry (the amount of tahini could be a bit larger to combat this) and the hummus, pretty bland. I also had a bowl of salad with Lebanese thyme, which was lightly dressed and lemony. This is delicious but pretty steep at $18, considering that it contained at most 2 olives cut in half and a small amount of greens. I also had to add salt to it. The harissa that I had to ask for again because apparently I had to put in an actual order for it, was a plentiful two scoops and tasty, but I only needed a little. I knew I'd be paying for it, which I am also not used to doing, even in more upscale Mediterranean places. We had to ask for those fries after all and the waiter was super apologetic, offering to cancel them altogether. I don't quite get that, when what should have happened was that they were promptly served and taken off the bill. Although fairly flavorful with sumac, they were soggy/greasy and needed salt. The garlic whip, however, is standout. I could just put that on pita (preferably not their pita, as it, too, is disappointing compared to other flatbread that you'd expect in a place of this alleged caliber).Disappointing experience and forgettable food. The bill came to a staggering 140 dollars for a round of drinks and 5 small plates (including the fries and $4 for harissa ""extra large,"" which I never specified). I'm fine with paying this amount if the food and experience are excellent but I left here unhappy and don't expect to return.",18
14,,8/5/2018,15,,"Manhattan, NY",Peter S.,66,3.0,57,"After dining in a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant named Fattoush in Haifa,Israel, I have wanted to try Illili as it had been recommended to me by Lebanese-raised physician. The restaurant has a very classy ambience and gives polite and efficient service. I ordered Fattoush salad and a glass of chilled Lebanese lager beer. While waiting for my ala carte serving I was brought apricot spread and two delicious biscuits.When my salad arrived I thought for a moment that the wrong meal was being served as it was literally smothered in crackers. I had to dig with my fork to retrieve my salad buried underneath. The salad itself was fresh and tangy. Still, I was disappointed. I then wanted to try lamb and beef meatballs, kebab kerez, and was pleased with the spicy cherry seasoning. Afterwards I ordered cappuccino and found it to be nothing special as much better can be made by any local barrister.",
15,1,9/17/2018,15,,"Hoboken, NJ",T G.,203,5.0,150,"Customer lunch today was great- highly recommend! We ordered the hummus (with lamb) appetizer to start - the pita bread that it comes with was so warm and fresh! We really enjoyed it and it was enough for 4 people to share. We also got 2 grilled shrimp salads, a chicken salad and a chicken sandwich wrap. All of the entrees were good- the food was fresh and the servings are perfect! They also offer a pre-fixe menu for lunch which I highly recommend. We also ordered the lemonade and green tea beverages- the carafe's were each 30$ they easily serve 3/4 people but I found this a bit expensive for a drink, without alcohol. Overall - good service and great quality food.",
16,,9/18/2018,59,,"Dallas, TX",Gill S.,29,4.0,700,"A romantic atmosphere that feels elegant while casual at the same time. Any occasion from dinner to brunch seems great here. The black tea basil strawberry drink was not at all sweet, which threw me off at first, and then I started to like it. Felt like an unsweetened ice tea with everything working together for a low tone impact. The chicken livers had a great gamy flavor, but what ever sauce it sat it made it even better. It provided a sweetness that kept the lovers from going out of control. They also added some depth I normally don't see paired with the livers.  The lamb sausage Had a sweet, but mostly vinegar base with citrus notes (oranges or persimmons?) The texture of the sausage has this chew to it that reminds me of balled up spinach. Not a bad thing but not what I'm expecting. They packed plenty of juice and had a great lamb flavor.  The falafel was disappointing. Has a great crisp on the outside, but the inside lacked character and felt bland. How they prepared it may it feel like a chickpea bread loaf. The tahini they serve with it is delicious and high quality stuff.",
17,,11/19/2018,0,,"San Francisco, CA",Ben C.,0,5.0,12,"You throw foie gras at the problem. Raw tuna, too. You write a menu that permits diners to build a nibble-of-this, nibble-of-that meal from a lengthy succession of small plates. You add pulsing music and lavish décor.And you set aside a prime chunk of space for the bar area, where you serve cocktails with catchy, cheeky names. Anyone for a ""not-so-bloody martini?"" Or is the ""from Beirut with passion"" more to your taste?The latter drink's tag sounds like the working title for a James Bond script with a double-crossing belly dancer in the mix. The drink itself weds passion fruit purée and vodka in a bowl of a glass deep enough for an entire university of goldfish. And the city it references is the giveaway of Ilili's geographic orientation.Continue reading the main story",

We started off with some cocktails from the bar and then headed over to the dining area. Ordered some duck shawarma and Brussel sprouts as appetizers. Both were amazing and heavenly! Afterwards our entrees (scallops, chicken, and kafta) came out and I realized we never got pita. I'm a carbivore so that was a bit disappointing, but our entrees definitely were to die for. We ended the night with a cheese tart that was soaked in a rose syrup with sesame pillows. Overall the food was great. My only minor complaints are that there was a mix up with the tab which caused some awkwardness for me and my friends. I wanted to take care of the bill for the celebration, so I gave my card to the hostess to pass to the server, but somehow never made it to him. So when we arrived with the bill and I told my friends it was taken care of it... It really wasn't. Had to make a trip to the ""bathroom"" again to ask about my card. I'm an awful liar so my friends definitely caught me in that lie. Wish it would've went smoothly. Lastly the music was a tad bit loud - we noticed our server couldn't really hear us... Nor could we really hear him. Overall Good night with good food. Just a minor awkward  situation.",

The falafel was shaped like a square. I only mention that cause I have never seen that before. Humus, pita and salads are the standards of any Mediterranean dinner and this restaurant made them very well. The thing that impressed me were the meat dishes. We ordered the mixed grill, which comes with lamb, chicken and beef. Variety of kufta and kebabs. They come with these flavored sauces that were simply amazing.

Updated review",465,6,"Jersey City, NJ",Jocelyn K.,4808,4.0,862,"Last time I was here, was almost 3 years ago for restaurant week, which I enjoyed immensely. I recently came back for a normal dinner and it was even better than my first time here. It didn't take 3 hours long this time and the restaurant wasn't as crowded. But that could be because the day I went it was right before Christmas weekend.I came with a friend who works as a line cook at a couple of pretty popular restaurants, so we left the ordering up to him. What we ordered was even better than what I had during restaurant week, even though we pretty much had their whole menu the first time I came.Mouhamara - This was the only thing that I had last time, that I requested we get again. It's basically a sweet, savory walnut paste that tastes amazing with the pita. It was just as good as before.Moussaka - This tastes similar to many tomatoey eggplant I've had before. It's nothing really special but maybe good for a healthy dish.Phoenician Fries - I wish I ordered this the first time. The fries were large and crispy with lots of herbs. Holy f**k that garlic whip was good with the fries .Duck Shawarma - I was hesitant on getting this, because I thought it wouldn't really taste like duck, but this was so good. It didn't actually have a very strong duck flavor because it's shredded. The garlic whip with it is delicious. You choose 2 large ones, or 4 little ones. Octopus with squash, onion, peppers, mekanek, pine nuts - pretty good. octopus was charred and tender. I like all the vegetables mixed in. Mixed Grill with chicken shish taouk, beef kebab, kafta, lamb chops, garlic whip trio, seasonal grilled vegetables - This is great for sharing and comes with a trio garlic whip (mint, beet, and sumac). The beef kebab was tender and medium rare. The chicken was a little dry, but the kafta was great. I think I like their appetizers and dessert more, but this was a good entree.ilili Candy Bar - I got this during restaurant week too and I loved it just as much as I did the first time. I'm glad it's still on the menu after almost three years. I love the contrast between the smooth dark chocolate ganache and the gritty pistachio layer. Definitely for chocolate lovers or those with a sweet tooth. It's small but still really satisfying even though we shared among four of us.I didn't make a huge effort to come back before, but I definitely will now.",14
23,6,2/20/2018,3651,3,"Hoboken, NJ",Nicholas G.,2091,4.0,952,"anytime you have over 2k reviews and 4 stars or better usually is a good sign. It is no different here except for a hiccup in service which I explain below. We came on a friday night and the place was bustling. We sat upstairs and although the tables are close to each other we had ample space.We went for the meze options rather than ordering entrees. The server sold us on the fact that we needed 8-9 small dishes which seemed like a lot but I knew she was worried we would take a table on a friday night and order like 3 meze plates. I am no rookie though so I wouldnt do that!!! I understand servers try to upsell the guest but its another thing to give wrong info since there was no way 2 people could eat that much food. For two people you only need 6 maybe 7 appetizers. The lebanese red wine was also unique and added to our experience. It has a little kick to it at the end which I liked.Now for the food: Must order- cauliflower, duck shawarma, lamb dumplings, phoenican fries, fresh pita's (they come at beginning of the meal)What I would pass on was the lamb sausage and cherry meatballsOverall, a solid 4 stars. the server had good intentions but it definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  I would come back.",9
24,,5/5/2018,7,,"Broomfield, CO",Khaled A.,769,4.0,218,"A really good fancy Lebanese restaurant. The order for us was a hit and miss. For appetizers we went for the chicken livers and kabob karez. I would skip the chicken livers they were to burned and very sour for my taste. The kabob karez on the other hand was really good. They are a bit weird given they look like meatballs and I'm used to kabob on skewers. Nevertheless the taste was great and the meatball shape was good for appetizers when you want to only taste. For my main dish I went with lamb mahklouba. It was delicious! I highly recommend it. The lamb was very tender that it melts in your mouth. The combination with the yogurt makes it super good. My wife went with the lamb chops, I gave them a try and they were just ok. By far I made the better choice.Finally we concluded with Bakhlava which was ok nothing special. They were small 6 pieces. If you are looking for a middle eastern restaurant then I highly recommend this place.",

The food itself was quite mediocre- for appetizers we got the hummus, baba ganoush, and tabouleh. All 3 were fine, but definitely nothing that you can't find in the Sabra Mediterranean section of your local supermarket... For my main I got the citrus trout, and it was delicious, but it was $38 and didn't even come with a side of grains or vegetables. The prices in general were a bit ridiculous. And the place is nice, but there was nothing that special about the decor or ambiance. But the worst part was the service- we had a party of 11 people, but half of the party was served their main course while the other half never got theirs. They ended up just canceling their orders because the other half were already done eating and they still didn't get their food over an hour later. The manager talked to us about it but didn't offer to comp anything and just offered condolences. This place is not worth it sadly.",1

Came with three other friends for restaurant week & we all agreed that the food was delicious and the deal was well worth the money. Honestly my favorite restaurant week restaurant I've dined at in the last year. The amount of food we got for $42 was absolutely insane. One of my friends and I decided to order a bunch of different things and share. They also serve warm, unlimited pita bread to dip all of your sauces in!! I'll review everything we tried:-Hummus (5 stars): This hummus was so creamy and smooth I loved it! There is a clear difference between this & what you find at the store/cheaper restaurants. I also loved the lemony flavor that was kind of infused-Mouhamara (4 stars): kind of a walnutty dip, really delicious! weird, but reminded me of the fake taco meat that comes on top of the By Chloe taco salad.-Organic Heirloom Tomato Salad (4 stars): tasted very fresh & was a beautiful dish. didn't blow my mind, but was a very solid dish-Arnabeet Mekle (5 stars): this was the table's favorite appetizer across the board. It was essentially roasted cauliflower on top of a tahini type spread. Really delicious & would highly recommend!-Semolina Gnoochi (2 stars): this dish was just extremely heavy and the gnocchi didn't have much flavor... I didn't really enjoy this-Salmon a la plancha (4 stars): delicious salmon, cooked medium. It was a little too raw for me, so i'd ask to have it cooked a little more if you like your fish a little more well-done-ilili candy bar (4 stars): really sweet and delicious cant go wrong with this choice-labne cheese cake (5 stars): was expecting a slice of cheese cake, but this dish was a lot smaller and more delicate, which was a good thing! I loved the cucumber flavor, it was light and a great palette cleanser to the end of the mealhighly would recommend ilili, whether it be for restaurant week or normal dining.

I've dined here several times and have tried the traditional staples of hummus, baba ganoush and tabouli on each occasion. I have never been disappointed, but suggest trying the establishment's interpretation of the less popular but equally delectable dishes. I was particularly impressed with the kibbeh naye which is served fresh as a tween with attitude with garnishes of onions and mint. It is truly outstanding. If you're looking for another one-off dish, try the buratta with apricot and pistachio. It can trick your palate into wondering whether you're eating an appetizer or a scrumptious dessert - truly ambrosial!  One item that I love but didn't see this week the shakshouka.  It may have been a special when I last tried it or possibly a brunch serving; so if you ever go for brunch, keep an eye out for it. Amazing how such a basic dish can be so satiating and palate-pleasing. Having said all this, your overall experience won't be inexpensive.  Make sure to bring  some big spender attitude and hit the ATM for some fast cash before showing up for your incomparable experience.",1

First, I got there early so I took my seat at the bar/lounge area. The service was very good and friendly. It was crowded with many people enjoying the happy hours deal. HH menu looked nice, too. I only had a few glasses of wine tho. Then moved to their dining room after my niece arrived. Our waiter was very kind and all the things we ordered arrived on time and very tasty!!!!! Both of us enjoyed our dinner, very very happy. I can't wait to go back with my husband! Would like try some meat dishes.",1

When we arrived there was an issue with our table, and we weren't seated until a bit after 9. To the woman in the black dress and blonde hair, I'm not sure if you're the host or the manager, but thank you for coming up to our group and explaining what the issue was. Even though our party gave you a hard time/were rude, you were super professional and accommodating. You bought us a round of drinks despite us being a large party. Thank you for the hospitality...none of the others in the group have ever worked in the service industry, clearly, and don't know what it's like to run a place smoothly on a Saturday night. Besides this, the food was AMAZING. Beware of the hummus, it was addicting. I wish I hadn't eaten so much so as to not have enough room for the rest of the delicious food we ordered. If nothing else, try the brussel sprouts. So bomb! The falafel was cute and served in 4 with a flavorful taste and not dry at all like some falafel can be. We also ordered the semolina gnocchi and it was soooo good but we were too full by the end unfortunately to enjoy it fully :(. Less is more at this place! The Phoenician lemonade cocktail was very sweet and the Fresh Meadow one was like a refreshing cucumber water. The decor inside was beautiful with all the wood and mirrors. Thank you Ilili especially our server Demetrius who was very attentive and the host/manager lady.",

We had a couple of mezza plates , the Baba Ghannouj and Burrata .My favoite was the barrata .  Also fresh soft basket of delish flat breads. We shared the Lamb Makloubeh with dirty rice which was plenty of food for 2 people .We were seated upstairs which was perfect because the downstairs was a we bit noisey for us .Service is prompt and efficient.

33,,2/18/2018,358,,"New York, NY",Sarah C.,116,3.0,104,"I went here for restaurant week and it didn't completely live up to my expectations. I will say, for a restaurant week type of deal, you get to pick more appetizers than you normally are allowed. My boyfriend and I both got to pick 2 appetizers each, an entree, and dessert. The appetizers were pretty flavorful. Their pita was also extremely airy, puffy, and yummy. We ordered the hommus, moussaka, baba ghannouj, and the kibbeh naye beirutieh (steak tartar). The moussaka and baba ghannouj were extremely delicious and was definitely the best part of the meal. They had so much flavor and really captured the Mediterranean taste. The entree was very very subpar, I barely even finished mine. I got the semolina gnocchi and it just did not taste ""right"". It almost tasted a little sweet, but not in a familiar way. It was not what I expected. As for the dessert, not much can go wrong there especially since I ordered the ilili candy bar. It was a rich dark chocolate ganache, fig caramel, dulce de leche ice cream, topped with salted pistachios. To be honest, I don't remember tasting all of those ingredients, but it was pretty good. The true downfall to this restaurant would have to be its service. It was SO SLOW! Now I understand during restaurant week, there will definitely be a higher volume of customers, but it shouldn't take 10 mins to be asked what drink we would like to order, and another 10 mins afterwards to inform us that you don't have the ingredients to make the drink... by the time we actually ordered and got our drink it was already roughly 25-30 mins into sitting and still waiting for our meal.Come here for the atmosphere as it's a very pretty and ornate restaurant, I think you could find better Mediterranean food with better service.",

Glad to have a chance to try it during the NYC summer restaurant week (goes from July 23-August 17). For $42 per person, it was well worth it. We came here with a group of 4. The waiters were courteous. With reservation, there was a 5-10 mins wait. Not so bad given it was a Friday evening. There was a 4 course meal offered for the restaurant week. 2 appetizers, 1 main course and 1 desert. Plenty of impressive choices for the appetizer. All of us ordered appetizers and shared as a group, so we got to try all of those dishes. Personally, I chose Tuna Tartare and Warm Eggplants. Tuna Tartare was amazingly done and so delicious. Eggplants were good but Tuna Tartare was better.As a main course, I picked Lamb chops. They are so delicious it's out of this world. (There was $11 extra charge, but well worth it). Desert come with three choices. My choice was ilili candy bar. Small but delicious to finish up the amazing dinner.Overall, our group had a great time in a nice setting.Will come visit again in the future.",

There's three different rooms for dining and a separate bar. Pretty modern vibes and definitely a place where you can get a bit more dressed up.The food was phenomenal. There was a pre-fix menu but we decided to order a la carte. The first page was a bunch of sharable plates and the second was the main dishes/meat dishes. So we got the baba ganoush, the falafel and the manti + the lamb makloubeh. Everything tasted amazing and it was the perfect amount for two people. We came for my boyfriends birthday so we ordered dessert, the ilili candy bar, and they gave us a candle and wrote happy birthday but the best part was the dessert itself. It tasted so good!The service was quick, and helpful, and super nice. And although the price came out to $150+ (that was plus drinks), it was a pretty great night.",

VEGAN FOOD: Amazing, especially the pita that has a cinnamon touch, I've never had anything like it and I often eat middle eastern food. Another outstanding dish was the Fattoush salad. The falafel was a little too fried for my tasting and the lentil croquettes were quite dry but less fried than the falafel so was almost preferred. ALL FOOD: The family also got the lamb dumplings, labneh, and beef Shawrma which they all loved. WAITERS: A bit too quick for my likings, rushing around and swiping our dressings away from us before we finish (very frustrating). Besides from that though, we were treated kindly. Overall, definitely a wonderful place for middle eastern fine dining (this was my second time here).",

The only this I loved was their hummus and pita bread. I could feel it was so freshly made with wonderful flavors and the bread being warm with fluffy texture fresh out of the oven.We got labne which was again well made , slightly on the tangy side. The Riz was cooked on the drier side. Nice flavors of the nuts. My friends got the mekanek and grilled octopus for the starters. They didn't like the dish too much. The meat want well cooked or maybe that is something which we prefer and probably should have mentioned before. For the main course I got the semolina gnocchi. I just wish it wasn't so dry and had a bit more flavors. Although I loved the drinks here. We ordered the Arak. I had never tried it before and I think it's kind of like absinthe with its refreshing flavor. The service was wonderful. We got the food really fast and all points for presentation. Perfectly clear in its presentation of every dish but lacking the flavor. I don't think I would be excited for this place any more.",3

The only reason we hestiate to visit more often is that its a VERY noisy place.  The music is loud and mostly techno.  And when we visited last and asked the manager if they could turn it down she turned us down by saying that its the wish of the owner to have this type of music and to have it this loud!  So if you are planning on having conversation this is not the place to go even though the food is outstanding!,
43,,6/9/2018,44,,"Jackson Heights, NY",Abeer H.,1,2.0,275,"This place is surprisingly cavernous on the inside, and bit hotel/corporate in decor. The service is friendly but the day we went (Sat lunch), we could not get our server's attention after our initial order. We must have flagged down 3 or 4 other staff to ask for water, salt, order more tapas, get dessert, the bill, you name it. They have a fantastic mocktail menu (I highly recommend any of these refreshing drinks). We didn't do brunch or mains, but got a bunch of tapas so we could try different things. We got the dandelion salad (unsalted and kind of chewy/tough, but interesting), the cauliflower (nice, and with a fantastic tahini sauce), the mejadra croquettes (good), lamb sausage (ok, but my friends liked it more than I did), the shrimp (maybe the best thing we got and with a fantastic sauce), brussel sprouts (good), babaganoush (bland), jalepeno hummus (also bland), and the baklava (super dry and falling apart, even after we asked for and ladeled on more simple syrup). So maybe 1 or 2 things I loved, a couple solids, and the rest bland or untasty. For the price, not sure I'd go back.",

The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and was able to help us navigate through the menu and the wine listThe appetizers consisted of a series of small plates for sharing and accompanied by a series of small side plates which are accented the flavors of the dishes themselves. The picture that I have attached shows the seven dishes that formed the entrée. From Hummus to lamb to greens nothing was less than exceptional.  The waiter recommended a bottle of Bordeaux style Lebanese wine which was the perfect accompaniment to a terrific meal. As an aside my friend has found this wine and has given it to me as a gift.Overall it was one of the best Middle Eastern cuisine dining experiences in New York City. I will be backPS.  The waiter Alex was terrific and made this an even more fun and memorable experience,1

Their ambience was fancy and grand with the wide use of mirrors. Also, try their restrooms. Somewhat odd and modern designs.Now, let's get to the dishes. For a restaurant with almost 2000 reviews of 4-star, I felt underwhelmed. The free cookies were great with the dip, but the real appetizer and entrees were unimpressive. The Brussels Sprouts were a little burn on their own. It could be a great dish if it were not burned a lot. The same goes to the scallop. Definitely fresh ingredients, but a little over-cooked on one side. My CITRUS TROUT was bland with lots of spice visually. Maybe it's a hit or miss restaurant. But that night, it was a miss. :( I won't be back.",2

50,,9/4/2018,2,,"Manhattan, NY",Lad R.,8,4.0,22,"First, I must begin with everything wonderful about my experience here. Today I'm with two fun dinner partners and we're in a great mood. Ilili has a great bar and bar/lounge. Attractive, high ceilinged, open space. Please note the date:  It is Tuesday September 4. Which means that half of NYC still is away. Only the people with kids are back. We had not made a reservation. We were planning on going to Eataly (Il Pesce) which is a fave, but decided to try something new. I had passed Ilili many times and had wanted to go in. The hostess and other host, bartender and wait staff were lovely. Warm, funny, easy-going and friendly. For appetizers we had the Cauliflower, the Phoenician fries and the Brussel sprouts. Absolutely superlative!!  For dinner we had the Gnocchi, the Kafta and the Trout (pictured). All very good. The gnocchi were unlike traditional Italian gnocchi, but delicious. We would suggest lessening the cream. Overall, the appetizers are better than the entrees. So, now for the less than wonderful...you're getting my pet peeve:  I HATE it when you walk into a restaurant at 6pm (!!) to find the place COMPLETELY EMPTY and the hosts are cautious about the tables that they will make available to you. There's a saying, ""better a bird in the hand than  a hundred in the bush.""  We show up and we say that we want to sit so we can get started on drinks (where restaurants make their money -- and btw, we bought three rounds of drinks). Hmmmm, do you screw around being uncertain about putting us at an iffy table in the middle (toward the back) of the restaurant near a swinging door saying that you have (supposed) reservations for ALL (really?) of the other tables OR do you happily put us at the table at the front window??  Here are photos at 6:45, 7:25 and (as we're about to leave) 8:25.  Open tables....ALL evening!  See my review of The Cecil (which closed) that employed this same ""oh, you can't have this table because they are all reserved"" tactic. So all that said, I WILL be back. The food is great and the servers well trained and lovely. I will probably sit in the lounge/bar area and have appetizers rather than sitting in the main dining room, albeit attractive.",

The Phoenician fries were to die for especially that dipping sauce wow! The fattoush salad was also a big hit fresh and lemony. The cheese rolls were a little basic and a little overpriced for my preference but they were still tasty. Also I had the Phoenician lemonade and it was very good but it tasted just like a mojito. Love this place love the ambience very cute and romantic dark lighting but overall it could be a great place for a birthday or a girls night out and a date as well,2
52,3,3/7/2018,22,4,"Manhattan, NY",Dan C.,23,4.0,113,"If you can somehow request upstairs seating, I think that's the way to go. You'll be seated in a small alcove area that's quiet vs. the rowdy downstairs hall (unless you're into screaming over dinner to get your party to hear you properly), and the decor upstairs was admittedly much nicer.That being said, ilili serves quite a bit of appetizers (cold/hot) as well as main entrees. For a group of 5, we ordered around 7 or 8 appetizers and a main entree, and we could barely finish. They recommend ~3 appetizers per person, but I'd like to think it's better to stay on the safe side and order more as necessary.Of all the dishes we ordered, surprisingly, the Phoenician fries were the real winners for me. The garlic aioli this came with was extremely flavorful, and I ended up dipping nearly everything in it. The octopus appetizer was the other star of the night - we ended up ordering two of these, and contemplated ordering a third. The octopus was cooked really well, they weren't stingy with their portions, and they were sprinkled in a medley of vegetables and beef sausage bits that rounded out the flavors perfectly.Honorable mention goes out to the duck shawarma - some members in our group really loved that.Personally, I'd skip on the lamb dumplings and the cauliflower.

I came here with my bf for our anni dinner and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this meal has so far been the best anni meal. Love everything from the vibe to the seating to the bathrooms and of course, the food! Just imagine: If seasoned fries taste 5/5, how great is the main course?! The downside is that the more affordable plates are appetizers and the main dishes are 3x as expensive. But we got 4 appetizers to share and were really full. My favorite were the fries and duck shawarma (basic, I know); there's definitely a Lebanese twist though that you won't find anywhere else.A must try for drinks is Arak.

We were so excited when we snagged reservations for ilili, looking at the 2k+ reviews we knew we were in for a treat!  It was 8pm on a Saturday night and we were out with our good friends, the night was already setting up to be awesome. First off, this place itself is massive!  We were seated promptly at an adorable table against a wall in one of the dining spaces.  The restaurant divided up the space so it doesn't feel cavernous, and adds a fun architectural feel to the room with all the wood and 30ish foot ceilings. The decor is simple without being bare, yet upscale in it's furnishings and accents. Although it was Restaurant Week, we opted to graze through the traditional menu - choosing to heed our waiters advice / suggestions for the ultimate meal.  His suggestions were spot on, and provided us with many dishes we might not have ordered on our own.  He also recommended a better wine for us, while staying in our price point - I always appreciate that, versus when a waiter suggests a bottle that $45 more than the one we originally picked out.We ordered an array of foods, and below I'll list them out with my thoughts.  My favorite favorite would be the duck shawarma - which shocked me, as well as the fries (yes, I know, but ... just try them!).   Dishes we ordered, below:Cold Mezza::: Baba Ghannouj - I'm always such a fan of this eggplant dish wherever I go - it was simple and yum!  Less garlic than I am used to, but good as a start!  (Eggplant, tahini, olive oil):: Labne - a slight bit boring to be truthful, tasted very much like plain greek yogurt, I think ours also was missing the roe? (Strained yogurt, olive oil, fresh mint, zaatar, salmon roe):: Tuna Tartare - fantastic!  Fresh, the lemon and the tuna were beautiful together, plus the pita added texture, a must-order (harissa, lemon, pita):: Chankleesh - super yummy! The waiter mashes up everything together dish - its salty and savory and really flavorful!  (feta cheese, onions, tomato, zaatar).Hot Mezza::: Black Iron Shrimp: really yummy, our waiter suggested tasting it with the Chankleesh which was really good (jalapeño, garlic, cilantro):: Phoenician Fries: i know, i know - ordering fries at a restaurant?? But our waiter recommended them and we listened - let me tell you - they were SO GOOD. PLUS the garlic whip was divine! (sumac, parsley, garlic whip):: Atayef & Veal Bacon: these looked comical - almost like a mini breakfast sandwich that you might find at mcdonalds or something... mini pancakes making a sandwich.  It tasted NOTHING like it appeared, they were a bit spicy, very savory, and highly recommend (fig jam, pickles, hot peppers):: Brussels Sprouts: a little too sweet for my taste honestly, but prepared really well - big hit on the table (grapes, fig jam, walnuts, mint yogurt):: Kebab Kerez: absolutely delicious, very sweet/savory with the lamb&beef combo in the cherry sauce... yum! (lamb & beef meatballs, cherry sauce, kataifi, scallions):: Duck Shawarma: my favorite dish of the night - 3 come to a serving, I believe so they added an extra for us - all the best flavors of shawarma, amplified.  There was a sauce on them, which I would have happily drunk with a straw! (duck magret & chicken, fog jam, green onion, garlic whip)Overall, one of my favorite things to do is to eat a bunch of different types of food - I really enjoy eating tapas style.  Because of this, there was little of the menu which we didn't get to sample.  Solid experience, great food, and really fun atmosphere!",13

That makes it atleast one place, right there, for them to get along ;)  Although their entrees are great too, we usually stick to small plates and order 8 or 9 of different small plates for 2 of us and more for bigger groups.

Beware, this is slightly sweet, thanks to the jam.Batata Harra: The second best dish on the menu - made of cubed potatoes and spicesBlack Iron Shrimp: The BEST dish on the menu.

Good.Strawberry Rhubarb Shortcake: labne with strawberries. Just ok.Baklava:  Not on the menu, but you can ask for it and they always have it.I never get past the small plates - they are that filling!  The dress code at Ilili is business casual, but we have been welcomed warmly every time we turned up in casuals with family.Restaurant week fans, if you have kids with you, they cannot share food from your 3-course order, they have to order all 3 courses for themselves too!  You are better off ordering a la carte.",3

Drinks were fine, even good. But his ""I'm better than you"" attitude was not. I'm not sure why this guy still has a job, especially if that job is to make customers feel welcome and warm before their meal. Our introduction to the restaurant left a bad taste in my mouth. Dinner service was better. Our waitress was informed, attentive and polite. I did feel that the larger parties got more attention, which was fair. We ordered a bottle of wine and 5 mezze plates for the two of us. Biggest hit was the baba ganoush - smoky but light and enjoyably retained the eggplant flavor. The falafel were really nicely flavored, despite being made unnecessarily fancy fried in a square shape. (Why?) Tahini was rich and light at the same time with strong flavor-- as it should be here. Octopus dish was mediocre. Nothing even descriptive here. Pretty (!) but otherwise 'meh'. Overall, our night rang up to around $300. I was left underwhelmed. These flavors could have been more readily and easily enjoyed for lesser prices by a family restaurant nearby. I'll never go back to Ilili.",2

Updated review",59,,"New York, NY",J. Karim A.,334,5.0,742,"One of the best brunch spots in the city. Especially if you have groups. The mezze options are eclectic and modern. We usually never make it to main dishes as we're too full. Highlights are the kibbe naye with their special toum (garlic) options. Maounche, and labne. It's really good and rarely misses. Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity.",

We ordered a half-dozen mezze:  The labneh and tabouleh were the best I'd ever tasted, and the Brussels sprouts mixed salty and sweet deliciousness.  Service was paced perfectly, even on a very busy night, allowing us plenty of time to savor each dish. A selection of ice creams and sorbets was the perfect ending - especially the halvah ice cream.",1

For 5 people, we ordered 7 dishes total between the mezzas and main plates. -Hummus and baba ganoush came with hot fresh pita and was so enjoyable. -fried kibbeh had a great yogurt sauce -Kafta was an interesting mix between beef and lamb, almost tasted like a hamburger patty. -roasted chicken was the STAR of the dinner, so juicy and it was perfect. Served w roasted veggies. The chicken was brought to the table whole and carved at the table by our server. Very quick and expertly. -semolina gnocchi was another one of my faves, nice and creamy yogurt sauce. Very fluffy gnocchi. -Lamb chops were well prepared, but I'm personally not a big lamb fan.  Others thoroughly enjoyed it though! -unfortauntely there was no shawarma when we arrived, neither beef nor duck!! Very tragic :( Ambiance 4/5I was very intrigued by the ambiance of this Lebanese restaurant. The entrance/ waiting area is very modern and sleek in design, suggesting a dressy scene, and people are indeed dressed up, but the dining area, while still nice and formal, has very industrial, almost cafeteria styled chairs and tables. At the same time, it did confer an intimate feel with the dim lighting and dressed up customers. Intricate playing as well. Price 3/5 Quite pricey, our total came out to $50pp, but very satisfying meal. Quality service throughout dinner as well.",

Very welcoming and accommodating when I walked in without reservation. My server was friendly, knowledgeable, and recommended a couple dishes. Unfortunately, this is where the rating averaged out... I'm compelled to rate 3 stars due to uncomfortably waiting (being on a business trip, dining alone) for water to be filled but mostly for just waiting for my bill. To be clear, no one was unprofessional or rude, the food was excellent, I just felt very uncomfortable waiting at the end of my meal.",
66,,7/31/2017,276,,"New York, NY",Asher W.,583,5.0,209,"Ilili is an absolute gem. For a while it had 3.5 stars which is just highway robbery. Its absolutely worthy of a terrific review. Since moving to NYC 3.5 years ago I've been here easily 15 times. Its me and my girlfriends go to spot when we have people in town visiting. Because of its significant capacity its relatively easy to get a reservation. But at the same time its large seating capacity does not at all detract from the quality or the experience. The play is to get small plates. Period. I'd recommend 2-3 per person. And I'm a big guy with a big appetite.You can't go wrong here. Everything is calculated and fine tuned and absolutely delicious. My top picks after many visits...Humus with jalapeno - smooth, velvety, and that jalapeno kickLebne - rich and delicious, one of my favoritesFattoush - well balanced salad, very good, with some pita chips cracked inThyme salad - spicy and herbaceous Duck shawarma - I'm in loveLamb meatballs - nice and tender with this great somewhat sweet sauceMeat dumplings - these are awesome, with a tomato yogurty sauceFeta spread (can't remember the real name) - salty and chunky, really like this stuffFalafel - not dry like most places is, its nice and moist with a crunchy crispy shell, and its square?!? Maybe tays the secret to the perfect textureAnd loads and loads of the pillowy soft pitaThe cocktail selections are always solid. Super fresh ingredients and very unique concoctions. Best way to go is to start your visit off with a cocktail at the low tables in the entrance area then move to the table. Wine selection is great. Lots of lebanese wines alongside the more traditional french italian and american styles. My ultimate piece of advice here...trust your waiter. Th people who work here know there stuff. They know what's good. They know how to read your tastes. They won't steer your wrong. If you're a first time diner or just want to branch out from the norm ask them for advice. They are a resource to be taken advantage of. So if you wanna know just ask for some ordering tips. Believe me.I'll be returning to ilili regularly until I leave the city whenever that may be. I love this place.",2

All of the food both my company and I dined on delighted our palates with out of this world complex but well balanced and delicate seasonings of the Middle East leaving us thoroughly impressed. Being that we dined like Queens & Kings on both visits, had our bellies stuffed with so much delicious food, a few favorite cocktails and lots of wine I will highlight very top favorites and must try dining choices below for reference. Where do I begin...To clarify we all know Steak Tartae is French but iLiLi put an excellent Middle Eastern twist on this dish called Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh with crudités of onions, jalapeno and mint. Awesome do try this!Baba Ghannouj one of the best creamy eggplant & tahini cold Mezzas I've had to date with a wonderful roasted smoky flavor to tantalize the palate and awaken your senses. Get it.Hommus with Basterma out of this world wonderful, you might want to order a few of these with Jalapeno to kick it up a notch, say yes!Batata Harra perfectly cooked tender cubed potatoes, kouzbara, aleppo pepper, drizzle some olive oil all over and you can thank me later, your welcome.Phoenician Fries with sumac, parsley, garlic whip if you love dipping crispy on the outside, soft on the inside delicately seasoned fries in out of this world garlicky creamy dip make this an order to try for sure, you shall not be disappointed.Atayef & House Cured Veal Bacon perfect balance of Fig jam, pickles and hot peppers, the veal bacon just makes this a wow factor.Both the Duck & Beef Shawarma were tender, juicy, mouth watering delights full throttle umami sensations to try all wrapped in warm fresh pita.Citrus Trout absolutely wonderful delicate fish with orange tahini, arugula, and smoked almonds, flavor, texture and crunch delivers in spades! Top favorite Drink to get is the Aleppo Margarita, aleppo infused tequila, strawberry & jalapeno with just a hint of sweetness, smooth with a nice spicy kick. First visit I had no room for dessert what a surprise! 2nd visit we had the candy bar, was not my favorite stick to the food I noted above you won't really care about dessert.Be prepared to be wowed!",41
71,,2/26/2018,49,,"Key Biscayne, FL",Dani L.,365,5.0,349,"By far the best Mediterranean restaurant in NYC. We ordered hummus, labne(yogurt type of dip), duck shawarma, mixed grilled platter, falafel, and kibbeh. Everything was deliciously out of this world, but being such a fancy and pretty expensive restaurant, I would expect the food to be hot when brought to the table. We had to return two of the plates for them to heat them up, since they were brought to us cold. I must say, they handled the situation pretty well, and due to the food being cold, they took the two platters out of the bill. That's great customer service in my opinion. The hostess at the front was also very nice and attentive. I also think that a reservation is necessary to get a table, they are very busy all the time. The drinks were also delicious, I definitely recommend !",

Getting there early I parked myself at the bar for a drink and was greeted by nice staff and a solid drink menu.Upon being seated when our group arrived, we were seated at a large table that felt a little too big for us so it wasn't as intimate as we would have liked. The food options were great for sharing and we ordered multiple rounds after tasting and seeing what we liked. There was an awkward moment when ordering wine when I asked to taste a wine I chose and then didn't like it. It seemed corked and when I raised concerns with the waitress it took quite some time for them to come back with the menu and reconcile my concerns. It's certainly not the first nor the last time something like that will happen, so seeing staff shuffle to get a manager just to make sure I could be provided with another bottle was just bizarre.Not a place I'd go out of my way to return to, but wouldn't turn it down if in the neighborhood.",

To start, the hostess was rude and dismissive when she was moving us from the waiting area to the table. Herded cattle get treated better. However, the most unbearable part of dinner was the wait for food and service. Our party of 5 arrived promptly for our 8:30pm reservation and didn't get to place our order for food or drink until an hour later when our waitress came to take our order, who was nice enough but still delayed. It seemed like the ratio of busboys to servers was highly disproportionate. When our food finally arrived, the pita was cold and hard. Our pita basket tasted like a reunion between all the leftover bread from the evening. That said, the food was not much better. Be warned, do not order the falafel. They come in rectangles, which I'm not discriminating against in itself, except for the fact that the corners were so overcooked, hard and tasteless. It was also about $3 per falafel, which is crazy. Unfortunately for us, the dishes came out so unevenly paced and slow that we didn't get the next dish until 30 mins later to wash the taste out. The lamb meatballs were pretty good, but not good enough to let us forget about how long we've waited for them. At 10pm, we finally got our roasted chicken. Tasted good but $47 for a roasted chicken served at 10pm is pretty criminal. Also served with butter knives for some reason. Any other dishes ordered were unremarkable. Something was clearly going on in the kitchen. To their defense, it was Labor Day Weekend and they might not have been operating with full staff. Our group was so dissatisfied with our experience we contemplated many times just leaving cash on the table and leaving. If it wasn't for the first experience I had at ilili in 2015 and the redeeming lamb meatballs, this would be a 1 star review.",2

Solid 4 star quality, but deducted one for a really slow service.Ambience - Restaurant is really well decorated. I don't normally take pictures of the restaurant, but this one is up there.Service - Painfully slow. Nice staff, but they explained the food 3 times for whatever reason. Again, it was painfully slow. Someone at my table ate an energy bar because the service was so slow...Food (Out of 7 appetizers and 5 main dishes)Good - Duck shawarma was delicious, but add sauce since it can get dry.  Brussel sprouts were surprisingly good, but the ratios were a bit off on actual Brussel sprouts to other ingredients.48 day dry aged cote de bouef was slightly overcooked and undersalted, but it was still enjoyable. It sucked that some parts of the beef were more delicious than the others, and it felt slightly overpriced, considering how awesome the dry aged beef at Minetta Tavern is for only a bit more.Lamb chops were pretty flavorful, if not a little intense at times.Alright - Fries are good. We mainly ordered it thinking it'd get here fast, and we needed something to munch on. Not sure why we're getting fries at a Mediterranean place, but it was decent.Not hot - Labne wasn't popular with any of the 8 at the table. It was barely touched. Mixed Grill had meats that were really dry or just absurdly tough.Dessert - It was pretty average. We got almost one of each, and the pumpkin souffle and labne cheesecake mousse were the only good ones. Usually, most desserts suck at places like this, but these two were alright!",

We had a 7pm reservation and were seated right away upon arrival. Our waiter popped over to explain the RW process and get our drinks. For the meal, I had the falafel and cauliflower to start, gnocchi for the entree, and candy bar for dessert. The best part for me was the candy bar. The rest, sadly looked better than it tasted. The two appetizers were very heavy and the entree was overpowered with the taste of tomato, not to mention the gnocchi was breaded, which I was not expecting. The meal was also timed poorly. They brought out the entrees while we were still eating our appetizers, but we waited what felt like 30 mins between the entree and dessert. Then they brought my friend a dirty spoon, which she started to eat her dessert with. Once she noticed and called the waiter over, he brought her a new dessert, but we waited another 10-15 mins for that to come. Ambiance was interesting. It has a clubby vibe to it. When we first got there it was quieter, but as the night when on the music was turned up and the volume around us got pretty loud too. You are seated very close to everyone around you, we often had to yell at our waiter for him to hear us. On that note, the service was the only reason this place didn't lose more stars. Our waiter was really great and friendly throughout the meal. Overall, this was a RW miss for me. I was really hoping to find a new Lebanese/Mediterranean favorite, but it just fell flat.",

The hostess is beyond awful though. I was there 5 minutes after my reservation and told her it's for a birthday. Nothing was done for that later. She said it would be a few minutes, which was fine because my friend was running late. After 15 minutes, the table was ready and I asked for a minute to find my friend. Less than 60 seconds later, she gave away our table! She then gave us a pretentious lecture about how we were ""so late"" and now must wait an unpredictable amount of time. If not for my friend, I would have left. A few minutes later, we finally got another table and saw many open tables inside. Please retrain this woman.

Additionally, we had the brussel sprouts, cheese rolls and fries. Firstly, the brussel sprouts are a MUST. I have never tasted anything like this before and I always order brussel sprouts.

I had no idea there were vineyards there, but you learn something every day and the wine was good. Aa we got to the table we were handed menus and served a yogurt dish with what i believe were pita crackers. When the waiter saw how much we loved it he brought us more. My sister and I split a Brussels sprouts appetizer that came with grapes, fig jam, walnuts, and mint yogurt. When it was time to order entrees, my sister ordered Kafta, which isspiced ground beef & lamb, sumac garlic whip, and seasonal grilled vegetables. She ordered that with a rice dish and at this point I thank our parents for teaching us to share because her meal was delicious. For myself I ordered Lamb Makloubeh. It was lamb shank, dirty rice, fried eggplant, cucumber yogurt, and mixed nuts. The Lamb had to have been slow roasted because there was no bone and it just melted in my mouth.

Ilili maybe the most famous Lebanese restaurants in NYC. However, it is definitely not your typical traditional Lebanese experience and it is by no means reflective of the true spirit of authentic, simple, home style, generous Lebanese cuisine. It's obviously an upscale, fancy, sophisticated, New York style Americanized lebanese restaurant. It is more suited for big occasions. Portions are so small. High prices.There are many other options in the city for more authentic and affordable delicious Lebanese food such as Naya and balade. I still gave it 4 stars because food is still tasty and of excellent quality (still not authentic), service is so attentive, professional, and friendly. Servers are American but they're very familiar with Lebanese food, cook style and our wine, which they have a great selection of by the way and is a big bonus. The knefe is in my opinion their best signature! Probably the best in NYCWonderful atmosphere. New York chic, vibrant, high ceilings, classy crowd. Definitely a spot to dress nice.I've been here maybe 5 times so far but I would only come here for big occasions, if I feel like a fancy night and for knefe.",
91,,7/10/2017,215,,"Jersey City, NJ",Peter L.,174,4.0,123,"We came to ilili based on a recommendation from a friend. I also saw that they had pretty good reviews on yelp and wanted to give it a try. We booked reservation for Saturday at 5:30pm, a little early for dinner but we wanted to stay away from the crowds. When we got there the place was still relatively empty and got seated 5 minutes upon being greeted.The decor inside ilili reminds me of a sleek and modern 5th ave restaurant. It was minimalist but had enough just to please the eyes. They have a wide range of seating options from the bar, large booths, or dinner tables towards the back which we sat at.The menu offers a wide range of Mediterranean options ranging from hummus plates, assortment of meats, seafood, shawarma, and more. My girlfriend and I decided on a few appetizers and 1 main to share. We just got back from Paris so when we saw that they had chicken liver we got super excited. For the appetizers we decided on the Chicken Liver Mousse, Hummus, and Duck Shawarma. For the main we went with the Mixed Grill for 2.Hummus- The hummus was super good! The hummus itself tasted very typical and usual but the pita bread is what stole the show. The pita tasted homemade and fresh baked and it was still very hot. It was perfectly fluffy and delicious! Chicken Liver Mousse- This was by far my favorite dish!! It reminded me of the liver in Paris but the mousse version gives it a different taste. It does have a strong liver taste but I personally enjoy it very much. Combine this with some of the left over pita from the hummus is really a taste of heaven!Duck Shawarma- This is my second favorite item of the meal! The garlic whip combined with the duck gives it an amazing taste. My only issue with this dish is that at $21 for two tiny shawarma, it is very pricey. I would still recommend this dish however as it is very good.Mixed Grill for 2- This dish was okay overall. It is pretty much a sampler of all the meat items they have. A few of the meat items like chicken and lamb were tasty but the rest was okay. They provided several dipping sauces but compared to the other dishes it was okay. For the price of $68 I wished I got something else. This was definitely not worth it.Overall, I had a pretty good experience at ilili. A majority of the food was really good but could be pricey for what it is. My only negative feedback would be that the service is very slow. The staff did a good job of checking on us but it took forever for any food to come out. I would definitely be back but would try a different main course this time around.",

The kibbeh nayeh was exquisite, happily served with roasted pine nuts; the chicken livers in pomegranate sauce excellent; the bread fresh-baked and as light as my Tata's. Service at the bar couldn't have been happier, but when we moved to the dining table that changed. The service was erratic, and progressively more inattentive as our meal went on--to the point that one of our party had to leave before she could wait out the splenda she requested for coffee. Advice to self: stay at the bar next time.",

Not only do they offer it, but they have special packages that make selecting menu items a breeze. Cut to the prompt delivery and warm food--The food was neatly packaged and labeled, and even came with name cards to label each item after opening. The whole experience, from easy online ordering to the food itself was probably the best catering experience we could have had. The food was absolutely delicious, and varied enough for different tastes and preferences. Highly highly recommend!",

The food. It's not good.We got hummus, moussaka, duck shawarma, and falafel. Maybe salt was the night's theme.The hummus was decent, but certainly not the best. The moussaka was less of a smokey eggplant puree and more of a salty tomato/eggplant salad. Duck shawarma was more salt than duck goodness. And at these prices!Come for the beautifully designed interior for a couple drinks if you must, but this isn't a spot I'd return to for dinner.",
96,,12/16/2017,198,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Judy H.,37,4.0,68,"ilili is a great upscale Mediterranean restaurant, with a lovely dining room that is decorated in a warm and inviting yet high end vibe, but it has the prices to match so just be warned. All the plates are pretty small and they recommend 2-4 per person, which seems about right depending on how hungry you are. I love the ambiance, and the service was on point, but I felt it was a tiny bit intrusive, but I like to be left alone when I eat. The food: Cold mezze :Baba ghannouj was very creamy and subtle in flavor. Hummus was good, also very creamy and smooth. I love the labne, very tangy and rich, and finally the tabbouleh was amazing, I love the slight onion flavor but glad it wasn't overpowering. All the cold and warm dips are served as seperate courses with bread, which was warm and amazing. Hot mezze:Warm eggplant seemed to be fried then cooked again, I would skip this, it was very one dimensional in flavor, a subtle sweet sauce. The brussels sprouts were interesting, served with grapes and walnuts, not sure I loved it because it was such an unusual combination. The phoenician fries were amazing, coming with a creamy garlic dip. My favorite of the night were the manti, they were so flavorful and came in such a yummy tomato yogurt dip. Finally, the beef shawarma was a bit bland, I wouldn't recommend this. Mains:We had the braised short ribs, seemed to be quite small portion for the price and slightly fatty. It was delicious, tender with a charred crust, but for the price and portion, I'd choose another main.",

Not really known for brunch and their menu is pretty limited but it did not disappoint. We both had their eggs benedict- I got the truffle and it was absolutely delectable. The hollandaise was so rich and the portion was substantial. Their brunch deal for $29 for a mimosa, coffee and main dish was absolutely a steal for the quality of the food. The atmosphere was upscale but relaxing. It wasn't that crowded at all and the ambiance was a nice contrast to the hustle and bustle outside in the city.The only reason this place is getting 4 stars is that the staff wasn't very warm and welcoming.

The restaurant itself is massive with an upstairs and downstairs seating area, a lounge area, and a bar. The food and service were great. My boyfriend and I opted to split 5 of the smaller plates which was more than enough food, four probably would've sufficed. Pita is free flowing and perfectly fluffy.

We started with the grape leaves appetizer (in Greek we call them Dolmades) but I can't remember the name in Lebanese. They were good, but very small, and honestly mine are better, much much better, but they were very good! Next was the falafel. OK, you say, falafel? This was no ordinary falafel. What a lovely flavor and spices blended just right with the perfect consistency tahini. Oh Yum! Last we shared the duck shawarma. These were delicious! Just perfect and with sharing the first two dishes and the duck we were completely satisfied! Not stuffed, but satsified.

We each ordered some cocktails, and my favorite was the from Beirut with passion -- pretty sweet but very good! We opted to share a variety of the mezzas rather than getting any mains, and our server recommended a few. We ended up getting the hummus with pine nuts (came with deliciously soft and warm pita), burrata with apricot (not particularly Lebanese but delicious and recommended by the server), and the steak tartare (also recommended by the server, and prepped for us by the table boy when he brought it over). Then for warms we had the duck schwarma (came in two tortilla cones), beef and lamb meatballs, and cauliflower. The meal was suuuuper filling, we definitely didn't have room for dessert after.

This is a beautiful fine dining restaurant, with great service and top notch food! Their seafood dishes were superb!We met some friends and friends of friends for dinner. I'm glad that I dressed up a little. When I saw that the food was Lebanese/Mediterranean, I thought of casual environment. Nope! Women were wearing simple elegant dresses or blouses. The warm wooden-panels made you feel like you were in a decadent library. The attentive waiters and servers made you feel like you were getting white glove service and never rushed. We ordered drinks and our waiter started us off with a complimentary savory yogurt app. The yogurt was thick, creamy and perfect with the crispy pita bread. The octopus appetizer was perfectly grilled, served on top of caramelized onions and sweet peppers. The diver scallops were symphony of flavors: crisped scallops served with addictively sweet roasted cauliflower and topped with a tangy cherries. So amazing! The semolina gnocchi sat on top of sweet eggplant cooked in tangy red sauce. The rich cheesy gnocchi was covered in a cloud of celery foam and pine nuts. Apps ranged from $10-23 and entrees started from $25 to $68. So our bill came out around the $75 a person. A friend recommended restaurant week or happy hour as a more affordable option.

We ordered hummus and since I couldn't eat the pita (I snuck a bite and it was delicious), he sent out crudite at no charge. He was so helpful with good suggestions for me and pairings for both of us. Our drinks were never empty or even close to empty. I don't know her title--if she was the general manager or something else--but the woman working the front of house was just as nice and came over to visit with us, sharing our love for the halva ice cream.

The drinks were amazing and definitely had a more unique flavors and quite boozy. We were able to go to our seat in this deceptively massive restaurant, and ordered a wide variety of foods. We ordered 3 mezzes, the falafel, brussel sprouts, and the croquet. I loved the brussel sprouts were phenomenal. I usually hate brussel sprouts as a vegetable but this was oddly surprising and probably the best part of the meal. I enjoyed the croquet, but the surprising dish was the falafel which I didn't really like. It was too dry and didn't stand out like the rest of the dishes. We finished dinner with the gnocchi which I really enjoyed as well. Overall it was a filling meal with a lot of new and creative flavors.",3

115,,10/28/2017,172,,"Chicago, IL",Joseph S.,235,5.0,182,best Lebanese restaurant in NYC hands down.All the menu is delicious. The Brussel sprouts and KIbbe Nayyeh are exceptional.The Phoenician fries are also special and one of a kind. The tabouleh is great.You can't leave the place without trying the Knefe. Best Knefe ever. As good as the one in Beirut.The ambiance is really nice. Big place with well spread tables. the service is really good.Though it's not easy to get a reservation on weekends.,
116,,1/16/2018,1,,"New York, NY",Amanda L.,38,4.0,44,"Good option for Lebanese in NYC, but not the beat I've ever had. They're definitely better at mezze than entreés based on a couple of visits and ample dishes tried. The main thing I'd recommend is listening to your waiter, they know their stuff and can really improve your dining experience or at least prevent it from being ruined by a bad dish. I was dead set on ordering the manti because I love Turkish ravioli but the waiter told me it was the worst dish on the menu. Good call! Favorites: The hummusThe warm complimentary pitaThe Phoneciam fries The fattoush!!Batata harra Kebab kerrez (awesome meatballs!!)And probably my favorite thing, the Ilili candy bar which was served with ice cream the second time I tried it and made all the difference The Meh:The falafel The shish taouk Neither of them that special",
117,,5/19/2018,276,,"New York, NY",William J.,78,2.0,112,"This place is overpriced in my opinion. The food and the service is fine, but not remarkable, and there are other restaurants in the neighborhood with better fare for less.The redeeming quality is the space, which is gorgeous. The ceilings are high, and the main room is quite spacious. This is not unusual for hotel restaurants in NYC, because the hotel pays for the real estate and the restaurant is effectively an amenity so it can be subsidized by the profits from the hotel. The bathrooms are amazing, with bossa nova piped in over loudspeakers into immaculate private stalls with cloth towels and heavy wooden sliding doors that provide extra privacy.Avoid being seated in the back section if it's crowded! It's okay when they're not busy, but since they changed up their menu a few weeks ago and started promoting more aggressively, it's been packed, and the low ceilings make it very loud. What's worse, in the back area the person seated on the bank gets basically locked in. The tables are so close together that the waiter actually moves them to let people in and out. This is insane to me. It's incredibly awkward when you need to go to the bathroom and there's no waiter nearby, so you have to move the table yourself and squeeze through, risking accidentally knocking over something on the adjoining table.",
118,,9/10/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Trevor A.,0,5.0,3,This place is incredible. The humus and lamb is one of the best dishes in the neighborhood. Plus a dude just ran bread over to my house when they realized our takeout bag didn't have it. All hail Iili.,
119,,8/22/2017,388,1,"Flushing, NY",Carolyn Z.,490,4.0,254,Make sure to make reservations!! Its packed even on a random weekday lunch. Me and a girlfriend wanted to try it out for restaurant week after she dined here previously and raved about it. We made reservations for 2 at 12pm and i was surprised once we got there it was pretty full for the time they just opened. For the appetizers we decided on:Chankleesh- it was basically feta in a jar. Dont get me wrong it tasted good but for $15 i can probably get a block of feta and stacks of pita to go with it. Grape leaves- these were delicious. I've always been hesitant to try grape leaves because they look hard to eat but the leaf itself is actually super tender and doesnt take away from the filling of rice and tomatoes. Phonecian fries- also worth getting. They're perfectly seasoned and meaty and everything a fry should be. For the main course we decided on:Veal BLT- ive never had veal before but it was cooked very well and did not overwhelm the bread of the sandwich with its texture either. I enjoyed this alot more than the sandwich i ordered which was super soggy and hard to eat. Cubano- kind of disappointed on how pancake like the bread was. Picking it up was greasy and difficult to keep the filling inside and I couldn't really taste much flavor profile because the soggy bread skeeved me out after a couple bites. For dessert we got:Strawberry rhubarb shortcake & knafe. The shortcake was whatever. More like a parfait and i only noticed the mild rhubarb tartness in the preserves. Knafe was the winner of the entire meal. To have fried cheese for dessert?! My life is complete. The cheese is super delicate in taste and goes well with the orange syrup they pour on top. Definitely a must have if you can come across it in any middle eastern fare restaurant. Ililis ambiance matches its price point. So does the service. I would come back here without relying on restaurant week but only for special occasions. I can find this kind of food in queens but the aesthetic wont be as pretty,2

121,,9/4/2018,58,,"Paramus, NJ",Lawrence G.,0,5.0,2,Beat my expectations for sure. I'm Egyptian so coming to ilili I had a mindset as to what I should see from the dishes in terms of quality and taste. What surprised me was the creativity in the dishes like the lentil soup. Service was excellent. It's definitely on the pricey side but I'd come here with a date for sure. Lunch special is definitely a good deal. The fact that they even make their own bread is a rarity with restaurants and ilili earned my respect for doing such.,
122,,4/15/2017,343,,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",Deana B.,296,5.0,102,"If you love hummus, you NEED to come here at least once in your life. I literally eat hummus daily and I must say, this is probably the best hummus I've ever had. I arrived during happy hour and ordered myself one or the $9 cocktails at the bar while I waited for my guest. Drinks are on the pricier side so if you can get there during happy hour, take advantage. Once the happy hour specials ended we were sat upstairs to eat. The food is incredible. We ordered the hummus with jalapeños and lamb, Brussels sprouts (omg) and the lamb dumplings. The warm pita is also incredible. Just go here, you'll love it. Note: A majority of the crowd is quite dressed up so if you're dressed more casual like I was, you'll be fine but may feel a bit out of place at first.

Fortunately, every change made, made this dining experience even better than the last.The decor and ambiance of the restaurant has not changed and I'm glad it hasn't. The wood work and the mix of contemporary trims with classic accents really make the restaurant have character. It's quite a piece of art.The server that we had that night was one of the best I've had in quite a while. He had full knowledge of the menu, gave us the perfect amount of recommendations, and had just the right amount of intrusiveness that let us know he was our server without making us feel like we were hovered over. Drinks were never empty, plates were always clean, food came out perfectly timed. People, the kitchen doesn't always control the flow of food. Servers make that happen too. The food.... where do I begin. We had 11 mezza, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts. For a party of 4, it's a lot of food but we finished almost everything clean. We started the meal with ilili classics (Cold Mezza) like their signature Hommus, we had it with shrimp(highly recommend), moussaka (my second favorite), chankleesh (my personal favorite, definite must have), and the amazing kibbeh naye.  Everything was so on point and the flavors mixed with/out the fresh pita bread (which has become even more fluffy and delicious) were just bliss. As for the Hot Mezza, we had the brussel sprouts, (sweet, tart, delicious goodness), arnabeet mekle (fried cauliflower so good), kebab kerez (possibly the most interesting combination of flavors and textures that amazes me every time), manti(fluffy ""dumpling""), atayef and veal bacon (the Lebanese take on pork buns), duck shawarma (literally everything that is good in life is in here), and black iron shrimp (still good but perhaps the only average dish of the night). I made everyone eat with their hands and told them how to have a good time. For the Mains, we had the Cote de Boeuf (absof#$%inglutly the highlight of the meal), diver scallops, and the Whole Roasted Chicken (the flavors on this chicken and the presentation are to die for). Let's say we just saw bones left on our plates. Holy smokes I'm hungry again. Dessert, good ol Knafe bil Jibneh (IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO ILILI AND HAVE NOT HAD THIS OR IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TO ILILI, YOU MUST HAVE THIS), sorbets to clean the palette, and the labne cheesecake (interesting mix of yogurt to create a cheesecake flavor).We were so full at the end we couldn't leave for about 20 minutes.

Others in my party also had and recommended the falafel. 2. As a celiac, I truly appreciated the server's attention to my food allergy. He alerted me as to all orders on the table that contained gluten, just in case I decided to share plates. Negatives1. Stuffed grape leaves were bland and tiny.  I am amazed at how tightly and neatly they were wrapped, given their size. 2. Entree portions are rather small, especially at these prices. The serving of three entree chops for $48 looked more like an appetizer/starter, especially given that it was served with three medium roasted tomatoes and mache. 3. While the bar area is well appointed, the dining room looked dated. The bathrooms were unkempt, smelly and lacked towels.  Didn't stay for desert and actually left hungry.",
126,,10/20/2018,2,,"Montreal, Canada",Aya S.,0,2.0,7,"I'm Lebanese so I had high expectations especially given the marketing that was put into hyping up the restaurant. For appetizers, we ordered the kibbeh neyeh, hummus basterma, rekakat cheese rolls, and the heirloom tomato salad. For the price and reviews, i was expecting flavour that was exceptional compared to what I've known all my life. The kibbeh neyeh was amazing, made to perfection. The hummus basterma was great too but I would suggest that the restaurant use a better quality olive oil, olive oil should not be in a clear bottle otherwise it goes rancid/ bitter, so the olive oil did bring down the quality. The heirloom tomato salad and rekakt cheese rolls weren't exceptional, I've had better. Those were not worth the price.For the main, we had the semolina gnocchi and the lamb maklouba, both lacked flavour and salt. I loved the Mediterranean concept of the semolina gnocchi, it has so much potential. Maybe some fried garlic and red pepper paste topping would've upped the flavour. It really has potential but I was not impressed. The lamb makloubeh was beautifully presented but the lamb was dry, the rice lacked flavour and the eggplants were burnt. I liked the cucumber yogurt side that came with it.Our server, Star, was a star, she was great! All smiles and hospitable, keep that energy up.

127,1,8/7/2017,169,,"Queens, NY",Felicia M.,227,5.0,228,"I went to ilili this last Monday for restaurant week, I read so many positive reviews and the menu looked amazing, I had to try it! I made a reservation for 6 PM, I arrived 15 minutes prior to my res and was seated promptly, it was not crowded at all. It's very large it has a bar/waiting area decorated with plants, low cushion seating and coffee tables right when you walk in, off to the left is two large seating areas that can accommodate large groups and couples, ilili gives off a very chill and sultry vibe. ilili had one of the larger restaurant week menus there were about 5 to 6 options in both the app and entree section and 3 in the desert; you were able to choose 2 apps, 1 entree, and a dessert. As soon as my boyfriend and I sat down we were greeted by our lovely and knowledgeable waitress, she explained the rules of restaurant week, both of us had to participate to receive the deal; $42 prefixed menu not including tax/tip. We started off with cocktails, not apart of the restaurant week, but we can't go anywhere and not have one. The bf got From Beirut with Passion ($16) basil cilantro mint infused vodka, sparkling passion fruit, and I had Lebanese Oasis ($15) bourbon, lime. Both drinks were delish and strong enough to slurp right down. I also tried massaya arak which is like Lebanese liquorish, I was not fan, if like liquorish I'm sure you will be. Now onto the food! For apps we got: burrata (tomato, beet, zaatar), jalapeño hummus w/ pita bread, falafel (fried chickpea & fava bean dumplings), and Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh (steak tartare, burghul, onion, mint). Dinner I had the Diver Scallops (peas, asparagus, carrots, radish, lemon) and the bf had Chicken Shish Taouk (chicken breast, garlic, lemon), and finally for dessert, ilili Candy Bar and Strawberry Rhubarb Shortcake. I don't have a negative thing to say about anything nor did my boyfriend we both loved it! The hummus was creamy and silky and not overly spiced, the jalapenos gave it a nice kick, the pita was came out fluffy and hot. The burrata was great not one of the best I've had but it was delish no the less, oozing with cream. The falafel good but was my least fav, it was not as easy to cut through as I thought the outer shell was hard and you had to use a little bit of umph to cut through, the flavorss were good, I was able to taste both beans evenly, I did find it a tad dry, but that's why we got hummus, I dipped it right in for added flavor! The steak tartare was exactly as you'd expect, the meat was excellent but not for the faint of heart, some people aren't into raw meat, but everyone should try it once, it's delish. I didn't get a chance to sample the chicken, but there were no complaints only rave reviews as it was cooked to perfections and seasoned evenly and just the right amount of lemon, I was told. The scallops were excellent, I think they were the best I've ever had, smooth like butter, they practically melted in my mouth! They were so evenly cooked, which most restaurants/people have a hard time doing, and the veggies at the bottom completed the dish very well, grilled and seasoned with lemon,I love my veggies cooked with lemon so I thoroughly enjoyed them. Dessert was spot on too! I think you get my drift...a great restaurant, a must try!",1

First off, the space is amazing. Really large and spacious and gives you an elegant, trendy and classy vibe. Could be a great place to come with a group on a special night out. That being said, our party of 8 had an experience that fell quite short. The service was quite terrible and we felt like we were being ignored throughout the night. For starters none of the seats had napkins and we asked our server at least four times before we got any. We also had to constantly flag down our server to place more food or drink orders. The food here though is quite good overall. Recommended to try different types of mezze instead of one big entree. We tried the hummus (super creamy but a bit too much lime), falafel (dry and not that great), spicy fries (flavorful), meatballs (decent) and the duck shawarma (which was excellent). For drinks we mostly stuck to wine but some of us got cocktails which, were well made. The great space and the good food save this place from getting a lower rating but they should really work on improving their service here.",

The four-course menu left us extremely full. Neither me nor my friend finished any one plate, and we actually took the main home for leftovers! Two full-size appetizers each, one main, and one dessert. We were stuffed!Appetizers were 8/10. We loved the hummus; very light and fresh, with an assortment of toppings to choose from. The jalapenos were cut into massive pieces and thrown on top, though. Too much for our taste. We tried the moussaka and both loved it; IMO the best appetizer. I ordered the steak tartare and am disgusted thinking about it! It tasted like room-temp insides of a sausage. An uncooked, room-temp, blended sausage. It was awful! The massive jalapenos from the hummus made an appearance on this dish as well, accompanied by blunt-cut white onion chunks. Neither made the meat tolerable. I felt sick just looking at it. Luckily, the main course redeemed the meal. I ordered the Lamb Makloubeh and absolutely loved every bite! The lamb was perfectly seasoned, and sliced in a way, yet tender enough to pull with a fork, that it touched every bite. Dirty rice? I don't care why it's brown, it's delicious. Best rice, lamb, and sauce I've had - separately and together - and that's saying a lot as I'm Greek. Excellent use of toasted pistachios and macadamia nuts. By dessert, we were SO full, but ordered the panna cotta and Knafe Bil Jibneh. I absolutely loved the panna cotta; light and flavorful, topped with the freshest grapefruit and pomegranate seeds. The Knafe was very unusual. It took 20 minutes to prepare, and tasted like a sweet baked cheese (not overpowering, almost like the texture of baked mozzarella with the flavor of paneer), but coated in cinnamon sugar! All together, it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch and mozzarella sticks - weird, I know, but worth a taste for those of you tired of the standard creme brulee and chocolate bomb after dinner.",2

If you get there early, thou can sit in a swanky sitting area and order drinks from the bar. It's a nice touch! This restaurant was a perfect blend of family style dining meets elegance. The dishes are meant for you to order and share (think 2-3 per person). Though all the vegan options are listed as appetizers they eat like meals. The eggplant was a vision! A baby eggplant cut in small soft chips and seasoned to perfection. The waitress recommended mixing mouhamara with hummus and/or baba ganoush and the combination was transcendent! Eating that with the warm pita was a special moment in my life. Seriously, so good! Our guests enjoyed the duck shawarma and wine options.

139,1,12/14/2017,35,1,"Hoboken, NJ",Irina D.,89,4.0,134,"I've had ilili on a restaurant week list going back to 2010. Years later I finally made it here during restaurant week with a friend but she insisted that ordering from the regular menu would be cheaper (I didn't want to argue, but of course it wasn't). While I've definitely enjoyed this experience, I remember the one from nearly a month ago much better.This time I came here for my best friend's birthday. She had this restaurant on her very own list and I was ready to give it another try.We had a reservation for a late dinner because of my Friday evening class (so happy that's over with). Once we got there we were seated right away. You have the option of hanging your coat but we decided to take ours with us. The space is absolutely huge, definitely one of the largest restaurants I've been to in NYC. When you enter, you go through a lounge-like area into a main room, where I've eaten previously. This time we were taken to the back room, which is slightly less nice but is definitely smaller and somewhat more intimate.As most diners who frequent this establishment, we decided to split several appetizers. We went with the Labne (strained yogurt, olive oil, fresh mint and zaatar), Handrolled Warak Enab (grape leaves, rice, tomato, tomato oil and parsley oil) Falafel, (friend chickpea & fava bean croquettes), Phoenician Fries (sumac, parsley and garlic whip), and Moujadra Croquettes (green lentil, caramelized onion, turmeric and yogurt on the side). I've also had a glass of Raventos i Blanc Cava 2014 while my friend had the La Caravelle Brut Rosé NV, both were quite good and went well with our meal. The Moujadra croquettes were the least memorable ones and I can't stay I've enjoyed the dish very much. What probably stood out the most are the Phoenician Fries which although had only slightly different ingredients than other fries I've previously had, still made quite an impression. The Labne and Falafel were both good, the handrolled warak enab was pretty good considering I was never really a fan of grape leaves. As if we didn't have enough of an unhealthy dinner (we just happened to choose the most fried options out there), we also ordered the ilili Candy Bar (dark chocolate ganache, fig caramel, dulche de leche ice cream, salted pistachio) for dessert. It was an absolutely delicious mix of flavors and we both truly loved it. The service was pretty attentive, professional yet not condescending. Once we were done eating, we were not bothered and actually had a difficult time getting their attention once we were ready to leave.All in all, this was a good experience. However, considering how most appetizers are the price of an entree at many other equally good places (which would explain our ridiculous bill at the end of the night), I am starting to reconsider my affinity for tapas-like places in general. Good place for special occasions but not worth the price for just a regular night out.",2
140,1,6/12/2017,147,2,"Torrance, CA",Stephanie T.,118,4.0,147,"Came here with 3 girlfriends and we shared several dishes from the hot and cold mezza menu:1. Hummus with pita bread2.

Falafel (fried chickpea & fava bean croquettes) Out of the things we ordered my favorites were the Mekanek and Phoenician fries. The Mekanek had a fresh citrus-y flavor and the lamb was tender and juicy. The Phoenician fries are definitely in the top 3 best fries I've ever had. They were cooked perfectly with a crisp exterior but fluffy and soft interior. The garlic whip was delicious with the fries. The falafel was a bit unconventional to the traditional appearance, and was a bit dry for me. I thought the kebab kerez meatballs were tender, but was on the sweeter note due to the cherry sauce which I didn't enjoy as much. I loved the fresh pita bread that they brought around for the table to eat with the hummus. Their cocktails are good too but pretty strong. Overall I would come back to try their other dishes, we really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and the service was great!",2

I wasn't quite blown away by any particular dish. My cocktail was good but a tad on the sweet side. The service was also adequate, if not a little clumsy at times.

142,,2/4/2018,1,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Victoria A.,41,3.0,35,"My friends and I decided to check out ilili during Restaurant Week last week. I love mediterranean food, so I was really looking forward to some of the items they had on the menu. We had a reservation and were seated right away. Walking through the restaurant was quite an experience-- there were mirrors everywhere, so the place looks a lot bigger than it probably is. The decor was awesome! When we were seated, we were greeted by our server given the menu. Our waiter was awesome. He was outgoing, funny and helpful with any questions we asked. I told him that I couldn't eat any dairy and he walked through each and every Restaurant Week menu item, telling me if it had dairy or if it could be made without it. When it came to the dessert options, he realized that each option was no good, so he actually had the kitchen make sorbet special for me! I wish I got out waiter's name because he was really patient in explaining all my options. Instead of the typical one appetizer, one main, and one dessert, ilili lets you order two appetizers off the Restaurant Week menu. So I ordered the Mouhamara, and Moussaka. I've had Moussaka before, but I'd never heard of Mouhamara so I figured it would be a good time to try it out. When they came out, they were not really what I expected-- the Moussaka was basically just cold chunks of eggplant with some other vegetables and seasonings. Usually, I equate Moussaka to a mediterranean lasagna but this version didn't have any layers, and didn't appear to be baked since it was served cold. That being said, I still really enjoyed both appetizers. Just as we were about finished with the apps, they put out the main course. This was a little confusing though, because they hadn't yet removed the appetizer plates.  For my entree, I ordered the Lamb Makloubeh (which I still can't pronounce), and it was very good. The chunks of lamb almost melted in your mouth, although the pieces were pretty big and hard to cut with my knife. In addition to the lamb, the dish had ""dirty rice"" and fried eggplant. Not sure what made this rice ""dirty,"" but I was a fan. Finally, this dish came with a cup of yogurt that you were supposed to stir into the lamb to mix it all together (""Sort of like oatmeal,"" my waiter told us). I didn't eat the yogurt with my dish, but I suppose it would have enhanced the dish. By the time the desserts came out, I was honestly stuffed. At first, the idea of getting two appetizers sounded great but in hindsight, it was so much food. I don't think I completely finished any one course that came out. Like I mentioned before, my waiter was kind enough to arrange a dairy-free dessert option for me which ended up being three scoops of sorbet: pear ginger, apple fennel, and raspberry pomegranate, I believe. This sorbet was really delicious. The only downside was that upon taking my first spoonful, I found a huge green piece of dried food stuck to the underside of the spoon. Disgusting. When I told our waiter, he apologized profusely and took the spoon and the sorbet back to get me new ones. The only problem is that I'm pretty sure they forgot about me. I probably waited about 15 minutes for the new sorbet to come out. I realize they did me a favor by giving me an option that wasn't on the restaurant week menu, but waiting for 15 minutes was unacceptable, especially after discovering a dirty spoon in my mouth. I appreciated how surprised and apologetic he was, but he really made us wait too long. All in all, I'm happy I came here to experience some new dishes, but the dirty spoon was a major turn-off.",

Firsly- the price estimates on the Yelp menu are not accurate. The restaurant is actually more expensive. I wish I had known that before, definitely would have chosen a cheaper restaurant. It ended up being $70 a person which was more than double what I wanted to pay for a casual night out with friends. Fortunately, while the price wasn't to my liking, at least the food was delicious. BEST FRIES. Omg the fries are amazing! It's the morning after and I'm dreaming about going back just for another bucket of fries. They were thick cubed fries that had a thin crunchy layer flaked with spices and garlic. When you bit into it the crunchy layer gave way to soft potates that just melted in your mouth. All of the appetizers we ordered were delicious except for the falafael which was dry and didn't have much flavor. I didn't like the brussel sprouts as well...for $18 I was expecting the best brussel sprouts of my life and these were quite underwhelming. I highly recommend the fries and cheese rolls, and the dirt candy dessert afterwards.",1

By far, one of the worst restaurant experiences. Made a reservation for 6pm. Got there and was seated promptly. The hostess was nice. That's where it went downhill. The server was incredibly inattentive. Most of the servers were hanging out chatting rather than paying attention to their tables. We had to flag down our server 11 times throughout the meal including to ask to get our dirty plates cleared. We ordered 4 appetizers. Falafel, beef shawarma, mouhamara, and the Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were ok but the rest was awful. Flavorless and dry food. We ordered 2 drinks. A passion fruit one - which my partner said was delicious and a Lebanese American which tasted like the sidewalk. 2 drinks and 4 appetizers came to $140 with tip. Even though the service was so bad that I felt a tip wasn't needed. Other stuff included dirty restrooms and just really bad acoustics to the point where you couldn't hear the music or the person sitting across from you. Bottom line - if you've gone to halal food carts and/ or fast food Mediterranean places that you enjoy and then assume that going to a place like ilili that charges more money and therefore does it infinitely better - you'd assume wrong.

The boyfriend liked his beer a lot - its a pilsner and is a bit darker than a Peroni, for comparison. On to our main dishes: - grilled octopus: fav dish of the night!!! The octopus was sooo tender and flavorful. The bean things that come with the octopus complements the dish nicely. - hommus with shrimp: ya gotta get dissss. Every bit was memorable. I am a hommus lover but this is a bit different. The texture is creamier and the shrimp adds a tremendous amount of flavor. The warm pita bread is also delicious.- falafel: I was confused when I got this dish. Normally falafel come in circular ball things right? At ilili, you get rectangular cube ones. We asked if these are indeed falafel and the waiter confirmed. Nevertheless, it was good but not amazing. -Brussel sprouts: a bit sweeter than most brussel sprout dishes, but man oh man! This dish is definitely unique and memorable. Good starter dish to start, but I would recommend ordering something salty or bland to balance out the sweetness. (has walnuts, for those who are allergic) - Trout: I've never had trout before but it is similar to salmon. Meaty fish with lots of flavor. Good size to share between two people.Come here! You wont be disappointed",2

166,1,10/13/2017,0,,"Jersey City, NJ",A G.,1,1.0,32,"From 5 star to 1 starMy last review for this place was 5 star. Today's experience says these guys are getting a little too overconfident and don't care a bit about their customers.I took my aging parents promising them a nice dinner. After we were seated, it took almost 20-25 minutes for anyone to say hello and to ask if we are ready to order.  To their defense it was busy, but it doesn't give them an excuse to ignore a party for 20-25 minutes.We ordered six dishes. The first three arrive in about 10-15 minutes. We got working on them while we waited for the rest of the food. These were small portions and we were done in 10-15 minutes at best.We waited a good 30 minutes after that. So overall 45 minutes had passed. Any decent waiter would check to ensure that something is not missed. No waiter showed any apologies or level of urgency or made an eye contact to ensure we were served. I finally waived to the waiter out of frustration. He said he will check. His demeanor was not one of apology. They were winging it. I was still being very polite. The manager finally brought the food after another 15 minutes and claimed they had dropped our food and they prepared it fresh. Mind it, it's almost an hour since we received our first set of food. The ""fresh"" food was cold, out of a refrigerator. The manager (the bald guy who looked like the hitman from Breaking Bad) was lying. Two minutes later the waiter walked over and said the kitchen was busy. Not really, because I saw 10 other tables served who came well after us. I honestly didn't want to pay a single penny for my meal and for the lies. They reduced our bill by $50. I still tipped well and walked away. Looking back, I am very angry that I paid anything at all. They ruined my meal and More Importantly - ruined my parents night out. We packed the food that arrived late because we had lost our appetite after such a long wait.  Ilili, you make good food. But your $50 reduction in my bill didn't make my night any better. You ruined it. And there was no need for your employees to lie that they prepared the food fresh when they didn't. It was pretty clear the food was forgotten and was sitting somewhere in the kitchen and no one cared. And how caring after realizing that someone had screwed up and bringing cold food to the table. Your apology doesn't mean anything if your employees are still lying. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU. I hope you all are served in the same manner when you take your parents out for a meal.And by the way WTF was that cauliflower dish with three small florets of cauliflower. Was that a joke?",2

Started with- cauliflower was divine. Recommend it. - octopus - very tender with a light charred taste- hummus was as expected - square falafel was very crispy outside and soft inside very tasty. Main course were- lamb shop. Super tender and flavorful- whole branzino. $75.  They deboned it for us at the table. I think that's what makes it pricey. Also delicious.

170,,8/21/2017,2,,"New York, NY",Danielle C.,39,4.0,33,"A group of us decided to end nyc restaurant week at ilili because the 3 course menu had a variety of food to choose from. What was nice about the 3 course menu was that we could chose 2 appetizers!! A rarity in nyc!My girlfriend and I got to ilili before our husband's so we decided to get a drink in ilili's lobby. The lobby is pretty spacious and would be a nice spot to grab drinks. Luckily it was happy hour on the speciality drinks (still kinda pricey  for a 'special' at $10 a drink), we both got the passion fruit cocktail. The cocktail was too sweet and tasted like syrup. We asked the bar tender for seltzer water to dilute the cocktail. After being diluted, the cocktail tasted a lot better. Such a shame to dilute the alcohol, after paying $10 for the drink!!!Once our husband's came we were seated right away, since we have a reservation. I highly recommend getting a reservation to this restaurant since it gets packed quick!When we were seated we were informed that happy hour was at the bar only. The wait staff or bartender should have told us this policy so we could have taken advantage of the cheaper prices 10 feet away. This turned me off a bit, but I still continued to look forward to the meal. After our husband's drinks arrived, my husband noticed his beer glass was chipped after having a sip of beer. Make sure you check the rims of the glasses before taking a drink!! The waiter quickly replaced my husband's glass with no questions asked.I chose the hummus and falafel as my 2 appetizers. I expected a small plate of hummus and 2 falafels. To my surprise I received a pretty sizeable plate for the hummus and 4 falafels. The falafels were squares!!! I never saw falafels in this shape before, so I had to take a picture. The hummus had too much olive oil, which overpowered the taste of the hummus. Falafels were well seasoned and not to dry, probably one of the best falafels that  I ever had! Note: ilili is extremely generous with the pita bread. The bread is fresh and warm!  For my entree, I got the lemon and garlic chicken which was very juicy and well seasoned. I liked how the chicken wasn't over grilled and didn't taste like charcoal. The dessert was a bit disappointing, I got a strawberry rhubarb shortcake which was very bitter. I couldn't finish it :(Overall, ilili is a nice spot. The food is pretty good for the most part. Portions are big, we all had leftovers for lunch the next day. The only downside was that the service was pretty slow. Our dinner lasted almost 3 hours, which was great for all of us to catch up, but there was long periods of time between each course.",

For what it's worth, the From Manhattan to Beiruts (Bourbon, st. germain, orange blossom water) were pretty tasty.We were promptly seated once the entire party was there, and the wait staff was very attentive from the get-go, and fed us as much complementary pita as our hearts [stomachs] desired.  For appetizers, you get to pick 2 items from the RW menu, and since there were 6 of us and 12 appetizers to choose from, we just ordered one of each.Hummus - it was pretty standard, but that's a good thing...because standard hummus is still...delicious hummus.Mouhamara -  nice consistency, good balance between sweet and smokey.Fattoush - a light, but flavorful salad...which was helpful in cutting through some of the other heavier dishes. Sumac vinaigrette was very refreshing.Kibbeh Naye Beirutieh / Steak tartar - big fan of steak tartar, and this was a nice, healthy portion. Moussaka - Only got to try a little bit, but from what I tasted...it's worth ordering.Falafel - interesting presentation with the square 'balls', but still tasty.  A bit crisper that most, but I like a crunch, so that was totally fine with me.Arnabeet Mekle - Cauliflower with delicious tahini. Chicken Liver Mousse - I'm a sucker for liver...and not many other people were, so that was totally fine with me. Rich, decadent, yum.Burrata - Can't say I would have expected this at a Lebanese restaurant, but with the Za'atar (I've been obsessed from a young age...Israeli father), it was quite the treat Tuna Tartar - yum. What can I say, I like tartar things.Manti  / lamb dumplings - this was the winning app in my book, especially with the yogurt sauce. Kebab Kerez / meatballs - nice, with a slightly sweet (but not overly) sauce. good firmness.For my main, per the recommendation of our server, I had the arctic char.  It was a surprising large portion given that we were ordering off of the RW menu, but that's totally fine with me. It came on a bed of grains and a puree of some sort (I forget...too many Manhattan to Beirut's I guess). Either way, while being slightly overcooked, the char was plentiful and tasty.  Other people in the group had the steak, the short ribs, the lamb chops, and the gnocchi...there were no survivors.For dessert, we pretty much ordered each one, and doubled up at the labne cheesecake and knafe...and then we ordered another candy bar, haha.Candy bar - decadent chocolate goodness, with pistachios (if you order off the reg. menu, comes with ice cream as well). Very very good.Labne Cheesecake - I'm a cheesecake lover, and this was a fine cheesecake.Ashta - interesting dish of clotted cream, rose water syrup, and berries. Light, creamy, great.Knafe Bil Jibneh (upside down sweet cheese tart / sesame pita pillows orange blossom syrup / pistachio dust) - this was something I've never seen or heard of, especially for dessert. BUT IT WORKED! Warm gooey cheese, tinge of syrup, pistachio dust...it really does much for a delicious, tad be heavy, dish. Share and feel no guilt.Great food. Great service. Will come back to try these famed brussel spouts...which I totally flaked on ordering. Again...I blame the Manhattan to Beiruts haha.",2

Would highly recommend the Brussels sprout dish and the iron shrimp. We then moved on to the mixed grill which was a large portion for sharing. It included steak, chicken, kafta and lamb.

The falafel was delicious, a little dry, but when it was dipped into the sauce it came with it was out of this world. The hummus tasted like any other hummus, so I was not very impressed. The Fattoush was ok, I was overwhelmed with the amount of pita chips on it, if there were less pita chips, I think it would've been so much better. We both got the lamb, that was extra on the menu, and it was one of the best pieces of lamb I had in a while.Atmosphere: Very dark and loud. The tables were far too close to each other so you could hear everyones conversations from around you. Not a fan.Service: Our waiter simply acted like he did not want to be there.

The brunch pre-fixe menu was quite awesome as you get a choice of coffee, OJ or grapefruit juice + a choice of one of three typical brunch cocktails + a main plate + a side, all for $28! Plus, complimentary homemade pita bread for the table. There was a large range of options to choose from between the main plates (lots of lamb options) and sides. Although the portion of the main plates wasn't as large as typical entrees' size, the addition of the side and pita bread definitely left me stuffed after the meal. If you order the main plates al carte, the pricing is a bit steep as you pay around $20 for a typical appetizer-portion of food. I would definitely recommend getting the pre-fixe instead. We got the Truffle Egg Benedict and the Awarma Eggs in Cocotte, as main plates. Both dishes were pretty good, but what stood out was the arugula side salad that came with both dishes. For the side, I tried the Mekanek (lamb sausage), which I must say was pretty sour and vinegary (definitely an item to be wary about if you aren't into that kind of acidity with your meat).",

The food is very good and the presentation of each dish is also unique.  During our parties, the service is very good and there always seems to be a sort of ""head"" server, who is always very attentive and professional.  During most most recent visit, 2 weeks ago, a blonde female was in that role... and of all our visits, she stood out to me because she was more friendly and personable whereas in the past, although attentive, the person in that role has sometimes felt a bit more ""stuffy."" I personally found that this most recent worker increased my overall experience.  The primary reason I cannot rate this a 5 is that during one party there about a year ago, they made a pretty major goof (won't get into it but jist is they accidentally didnt serve a handful of the dishes we ordered). However, when it was brought to their attention, they did everything they could to rectify it. Accidents happen!  Nonetheless, we have continued to return to this venue.  I'd also like to mention that the physical space and environment is very nice - it's  a nice combination of modern and elegant.  You definitely feel like you're in an upscale place which we usually want when entertaining a party.  We usually have two kids and/or toddlers who tend to wander around the space and play a bit.  Maybe it's bc the space is reserved for us but having them play has never been an issue and if anything, workers have tended to sort of appreciate how cute they are! Food:  some of what stands out to me that are worth mentioning are.... pre-food, they offer virgin mocktails that are simple yet unique- I luvvvvv the cucumber lemonade drink and I'd luv to copy it at home but just can't get it right! Also, for dessert, the knafeh is the best I've had anywhere, and I couldn't help but order one to bring home. I personally have not tried it, (for personal reasons/preferences), but everyone who is ok with and adventurous enough to eat the kibby nayeh (raw kibby) which is afterall a pretty traditional dish, my family members have raved about it/the kibby nayeh. Also, the fries (not American fries) are so well seasoned and tasty and remind me of how my grandma in Lebanon would make them - it of course comes with the garlic whip to dip them in.  For vegetarians, there are of course plenty of meat-free options (i.e. hummus, grape leaves, tabbuleh , falafel, baba ganoush, tzatziki).  The pita which is basic generally speaking - they have the best pita I've ever had.  They come out warm and the bread itself is a bit thin, in a good way. No way you'll find anything like it in the grocery store.",
186,,6/13/2016,606,1,"Manhattan, NY",Morgan G.,720,5.0,244,"O.M.F.G. I don't know how else to describe this place aside from the best, most unique Mediterranean meal you'll ever eat. My boyfriend and I came here for our one year anniversary (I chose the restaurant because A. I LOVE Mediterranean food and B. I'm on a strict diet that doesn't let me eat added sugar, grains, alcohol, dairy, or legumes, and Mediterranean food is the easiest cuisine for me to eat). I made the reservation for 6 P.M. on OpenTable; when we got there a bit early (about 5:40), the restaurant was able to seat us immediately in their upstairs lounge. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and can cater to any occasion you see fit. If you're looking for a date night or even an anniversary dinner -- like myself -- this restaurant is upscale and classy, but it is also a great place to dine out with a group of friends or colleagues. There was even a private party upstairs who rented out part of the restaurant, so this place is good for any occasion. In lieu of bread, the waitress brought out these cinnamon-coated thin crackers with a cream cheese dip that my boyfriend really enjoyed. For appetizers, we ordered the octopus and the baba ghanoush, two of my favorite Mediterranean dishes. Though we didn't get the hummus this time, there was an option to order a lobster hummus that I definitely want to try the next go-around. Both appetizers were incredible -- the octopus wasn't over-grilled like many places do it and the baba ghanoush was perfectly smokey. The accompanying pita was freshly made and had a hint of cinnamon on it, too. For our main courses, my boyfriend and I ordered the swordfish with a tzatziki sauce, the scallops in a brown butter sauce and the brussels sprouts in a fig jam with grapes and walnuts. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the tzatziki sauce had dairy in it, but regardless, the sauce was INCREDIBLE and complimented the fish so well, so I guess I can let that one slide. My boyfriend enjoyed his buttery scallops just as much -- there wasn't a bite left by the time we were done. The highlight of the meal, surprisingly enough, was the brussels sprouts. The jam made the sprouts so sweet and flavorful that even my boyfriend was devouring them. They were sweet and savory at the same time, unlike anything I've ever tried. If you come here, GET THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Overall, I enjoyed this meal beyond anything I could have hoped for and I will absolutely be back. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Hell yeah.",2

Overall, this was a solid meal but not the exact experience we were looking for.  I think it's important to feel out the table and what they want, and we did not necessarily want a nearly 3 hour meal with weird spacing on this night.",

ALSO when we were seated at first, we were placed at a table in the dimly light back room. There was barely anyone in the back room and it felt like a punishment to be placed there. I had made reservations through Open Table so maybe that is the table the restaurant has designated for those reservations. But it was terrible and I was very relieved that they accommodated our request to be seated at a circle table in the main room. Especially since this was a celebration dinner and I had written that in the special requests section of my reservation! Anyway, besides that incident, the food was incredible! Literally everything we ordered was delicious. The dishes were mostly small plates. My favorites were the duck shawarma (bigger portioned), octopus dish (bigger portioned), falafel, and the fries.

The restaurant week menu was a great value, and strategizing with the person I was dining with was great. We got to try a little bit of everything. I would absolutely recommend it.",

My father and I are Lebanese and my roommate loves Lebanese food so we decided to give this spot a try. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and spacious. We had a when we came but still ended up waiting 10-15 minutes. Once we were seated, we ordered a bunch of things to try and share amongst the 3 of us: baba ghannouj ($13.50), tabbouleh ($18), fattoush ($18), falafel ($12.50), riz ($11), moujadara croquette ($16), octopus ($24), hummus ($11). We definitely ordered 1 or two more items but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head. We also had to get an additional order for many of these mezze because 1 portion was not enough. Overall, the food did not compare to any Lebanese food we had tried in the past, whether it was homemade Lebanese food, authentic Lebanese food in Beirut, or local Lebanese restaurants that we had tried in the past. It was below average and did not meet our standard whatsoever, especially considering the high price point relative to other Lebanese restaurants and the generally small portion sizes. This place may be a restaurant people enjoy, but I certainly would not recommend it to anyone who has a refined palette for Lebanese food. Food was not good and we paid $200 for the three of us.",
196,1,4/2/2018,1,,"Irvine, CA",OC R.,0,5.0,8,I checked out this restaurant when I went to New York. I was expecting some good food when I went. You can order food in two ways. You can order a bunch of appetizers and share among each other or every can get their own plate however they are big. I ordered appetizers and we shared among each other. There was a lot to choose from and I must say the food was very good. Everything had flavor and I can't say I had anything that was bad. The customer service is good as well servers are always ready to help. There is a lot of different kinds of food to choose from and there is also some Arabic deserts if you like those and that was also very good. Overall I would recommend this restaurant if you are fond of Arabic food. Even If your not the biggest fan of this type of food I still recommend you give it a shot! However food is very expensive so choose wisely.,

The portions are small, and definitely over priced.I love Lebanese food, but this place is nothing special, and very expensive compared to other similar places.",3

Luckily we didn't because we took more than half back to our hotel.",

However, there are other Lebanese cuisine restaurants that treat customers with respect and with better food, such as Almayass. Good bye Ilili.",1
