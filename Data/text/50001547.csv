0,Rachel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,11,0.0,5.0,10/11/2018,"I used to frequent The Winslow years ago when I lived in NYC - it was my absolute favorite place for a casual drink with friends, and I spent many an early afternoon sipping the best G&Ts in the city and noshing on traditional British fare.  A few months ago when my husband and I were looking for a place to host a ""Welcome to NYC"" kickoff for our wedding weekend, we knew we had to have it at The Winslow!In a city that almost prides itself on lack of space to host 30+ people for anything, I was thrilled to discover that The Winslow has multiple semi-private and private spaces in which to throw a party.  Furthermore, the fact that I didn't know my favorite pub offered these options having been so many times already, is just further proof of The Winslow's ability to be everything you want it to be - quiet and intimate for a happy hour cocktail, lively and crowded for a fun night out (their DJ is ON POINT).Cait, the General Manager, responded to my event inquiry almost immediately, and was incredibly responsive and easy to communicate with via email from the start!  I still can't get over the fact that we were able to reserve the back room for our party for a small minimum and no booking fee, simply unheard of at NYC bar / restaurants.  Cait was warm and professional, helped us pre-order some delicious party food, and even printed out custom ""his and hers drinks"" menus for our party!  The team provided outstanding service to our guests, and as much as I loved this pub before our event, it now holds an even more special place in my heart.Thank you to Cait and The Winslow staff for taking such excellent care of us (and to everyone reading this, just do yourself a favor and check it out already!).",1,,1
1,Phoebe W.,"New York, NY",548,323,803,3.0,7/10/2018,"I live down the street from this pub and have been meaning to go for ages. Maybe we were here on an off night -- the restaurant was uncomfortably cold, and the menu was condensed to one page (our waiter told us that they didn't have gas so anything made on the stove was off-limits). This left few options remaining, and I opted for the irish dip. Though a good portion and filled with tender lamb, the actual sandwich was just so salty it was hardly bearable. Everything, from the chips and meat to the dip itself was just reeling with salt. A friend of mine ordered the sweet potato fries and they were absolutely divine, though. We also tried our other friend's cottage pie pasty which was savory and flavorful. Oh, and, I had the Bee's Knees cocktail (Barr Hill gin, raw honey, lemon, bee pollen) and enjoyed it (even though I hate gin). I think the pollen made for a creative touch.Looking forward to trying out the full menu at some point -- I'd order the sweet potato fries again, and the bangers & mash croquettes and pork belly butty blt both sound delicious as well.",1,1,1
2,Jenna C.,"New York, NY",62,24,16,5.0,7/4/2018,"I checked out The Winslow for the first time last night and cannot wait to go back! One of my out-of-town friends booked the back room for a mini friends reunion and it was perfect for our group. I arrived early with the intent to order one of their delicious looking gin cocktails; however, a friend told me about Today's Gin & Tonic for $8 and I couldn't pass that up! I forget the exact concoction and twist on a classic, but it was delicious! The ambiance of this place was wonderful- as a designer, I appreciate a chill atmosphere paired with beautiful decor. The main space was both classy and fresh - the bar itself is simple and charming. I also love quirky touches - the back room had red and gold fire hydrant wallpaper! I snapped a photo for my sister who is newly engaged to a firefighter. I can't wait to return to The Winslow with some local friends and maybe even try out the Gin Club!",1,,2
3,Neelam M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,5.0,11/18/2018,"Had my 40th birthday celebration at The Winslow.  GREAT experience.  Cait was really friendly and flexible.  Reached out to several places and The Winslow was by far the easiest and pleasant to work with.  Not only that, but the minimum was reasonable (whereas other places rip you off) and the food was really good.  Service was great.  My entire group of family and friends had a great time and even though we were a big group, the staff made every effort to accommodate folks.  Highly recommend renting their space as well as would be happy to do another event at The Winslow.",1,,1

She clearly knew a lot about all the gins they had, and made great recommendations. Also the place is super cute and not too loud inside.

5,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,5.0,5/4/2018,"The Winslow is an English gastropub. I came here to meet up with a friend. They sell pub food, beers and cocktails. They have wide variety of gins and gin related drinks. The food is good and pub focused; they have some healthy options and lots of and rich comfort foods. Would come back for a casual meal and drink as well as to try out rare gins.The venue is large and resembles a modern gastropub. In the front they have a bar. In the back, they have a large sitting tables and several stool level tables as well as a private room. The noise level slightly noisy; it is manageable and you can speak in a slightly raised voice and still be heard. The service is friendly, but can be on the slower side when it's busy.Ordered:Aged before beauty - Few barrel aged gin + St Germain, chatruse, green teaBangers and mash croquettes - nice and comfortable",2,,3
6,Miriam M.,"Manhattan, NY",311,287,527,4.0,5/17/2018,"Looking for a pancake to dream about without the crazy brunch lines?After becoming hangry while trying to wait for Veselka, the bf insisted the Winslow is a decent brunch spot even though it was fairly empty. And he was right...shhh don't tell him. They have a bottomless mimosa option for an hour and half I think as well. The Salmon Eggs Benedict weren't bad but just very small.  My Pudgy pancake however frickin' knocked my socks off. The french fries were bomb- thin, crispy, and salty. Our neighbor got the burger and we both lustfully stared it down when the waiter brought it out. Surprisingly for a pub like bar, they have a good cocktail list as well. Oh and this place is deceivingly huge! There's a large space in the back with tables if you're hosting a party. I've been in the evenings a couple times as well and there is often live music playing. Been there about 3-4 times now and it's definitely an easy go to grab that random drink with a friend near Union Square/EV.",2,,1
7,Olivia B.,"East Syracuse, NY",4,12,2,5.0,11/4/2018,"Hosted a surprise party in their back room for 25 people, and it was amazing from beginning to end. Cait was just as excited to host our group as we were to have the party! She and the whole staff were helpful and accommodating and genuinely nice people. The drinks were delicious, and the service was amazing. Don't hesitate to host an event or just drop in for a drink or two!",1,,1

We made reservations, were greeted with a smile & promptly seated. The menu is fun & the atmosphere almost apothecary... loved it! Drinks were well made, food fantastic & well priced. You really can't do any better than that. Thanks The Winslow & Andrea for a wonderful dining experience.",,,
9,Kelly D.,"New York, NY",241,294,741,5.0,5/21/2018,"Love this bar! I've only been in once or twice, but can't wait to go back. Great location - not too far from the train, and close to tons of other bars and restaurants. Will be even better for me once the Stuytown Ferry opens and I can get there in 10 minutes from LIC!Good crowd, at least during the day - steady but not too packed. Bartender was really nice and helpful. He didn't even roll his eyes at my annoying request to sub Tito's for gin in my cocktail. Who goes to a gin bar and orders vodka? ME! Love this place, but I'm just not a gin person. Super cute decor. The bartenders really know that they're doing and pay lots of attention to detail when crafting each cocktail. They're super knowledgeable, and were patient when I asked a million questions. Quality, fresh ingredients too. You won't find a cheap, nasty bottle of Daly's mixer behind this bar. Looking for a classy, but not overly pretentious spot for some great drinks? Give this place a shot!",3,1,3

14,Dave L.,"Brooklyn, NY",3391,2363,18241,5.0,7/28/2017,"Like gin? You'll love The Winslow.I've had the best luck here on sleepy afternoons, and quiet weekday nights: the bar isn't mobbed and you can hear your neighbors. On busy nights you'll either love the craziness or want to claw your eyes out[1].Also: they have Modcup coffee! If you haven't had a cup, ask them for one! It'll save you a trip to Jersey City[2]. Yum.[1] Or just leave, I guess.[2] Not that anything's wrong with Jersey City.",8,6,8
15,Matt B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,96,89,5.0,2/24/2018,"Great bar in the union square area/east village. Can get quite busy especially on a Saturday. 5-8pm is ok but then 8-12 is packed. Then 12 onwards it clears a little and you can have a dance. I was going to flame them on here because they double charged me the automatic tip.  But they were incredibly good when I emailed them and followed up. And refunded the money ASAP.  It's funny how something so small would turn me off the place but it really is a good bar. Cocktails are a-plus and despite the stuff up, the speed of service was generally good given how busy it was. Bar food was pretty standard. Price -3/5 - not cheap not crazyService 5/5 - awesome Ambiance 5/5. Depending on what you want.",2,,2
16,Elaine F.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,64,71,4.0,3/31/2018,"Today was my first day visiting and i love this place. It's so nice, the vibes are nice and the service is good. I got the chicken and waffles and it was good. Unlimited mimosas was great. I would definitely come back",1,,

I can't begin to tell you how great this experience was from the beginning planning stage up to the actual party day. They allowed us to come early and decorate and bring in our own cake. Emma, Cait and their staff were friendly, responsive and went out of their way to help make this party a success. We ordered party food and it was delicious. When it came time to pay the bill, there were not any hidden costs. We will definitely return again.Donna",2,,2
18,kmama m.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,99,0,5.0,6/18/2018,"It's hard to describe the Winslow--somehow it manages to be TOTALLY raucous, pub-comfy AND a bit upscale all at the same time. As a former New Yorker, I knew it was going to be nearly impossible to find a space for an engagement party that was relaxed and funky enough to also let me throw in a few creative ideas and touches. I emailed/called over 50 venues from the west coast looking for a spot I could be proud to invite my friends to that wouldn't break the bank, and got very, very lucky when my google search yielded a Yelp review of the Winslow back room.Cait, the GM, is ON TOP OF IT...and that, my friends, is an understatement. She (and Emma) are rapid fire with responses to questions, crystal clear on expectations, and incredibly flexible. Your party will not be dictated by a bunch of random, stifling rules that have been set forward by an absentee manager.Not only that, but ALL of the staff are fun, warm, genuine people, and the drinks are delicious. And if that weren't enough, the late night DJ knows his stuff!  Perfect formula for a successful evening, let alone an impressive bar.My eternal gratitude for putting up with our hilarious (and loud) friends and family and helping us make our engagement party a truly memorable event. I feel incredibly lucky that I found you and couldn't be happier! We'll be back!",2,1,1
19,Paul S.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",102,42,12,5.0,9/4/2018,"Great food at bar prices, a curated list of gins as good as you'll find anywhere, and best of all, iced gin flights with in-depth tasting notes, served with excellent tonic, crucially served on the side.",2,,2

I reached out to them via email and they were quick to respond, super helpful and very accommodating. We received two table tops for our party and it was perfect. The Winslow allows you to decorate for your event even if you don't have the private room. The waiter was super attentive and the manager helped us with our cake that we brought: storing it, presenting it, plates and forks etc. It was affordable, the space and atmosphere were perfect and they helped make it a party that everyone enjoyed. Definitely will be back for another event soon and couldn't recommend The Winslow more!",1,,1
21,Cindy W.,"Manhattan, NY",35,111,336,5.0,11/9/2017,"Great GIN bar. Wonderful atmosphere. Bee's knees is strong and tasty. BUT...the best thing is the employees. I lost my wallet on a Friday night, and I was there with a big group of 10-12. Came back very late, right before close, and asked Catarina, the bartender, if anything was found. She said nothing had turned up but gave me a business card to call. They contacted me first. CM found me on FB and messaged me that my wallet had been found. BIG THANK YOU TO CATARINA AND CM!!!

23,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1268,914,4.0,9/22/2017,"I recently visited The Winslow for a party, so my experience will be a bit different than the typical visitor.  The Winslow is a fairly large Gastropub in the Union Square area.  Its decor is very classic New York City and it feels like bar that has been there forever and I love that look.  The front area is a traditional looking bar, with the bar on the right and some walking/standing room on the left.Our party was held in the main dining area in the middle of the bar.  However there was another room which could actually be closed off where another party was happening.  That room could comfortably fit 20 or so people (mostly standing).  Our area fit a lot more than that and we even had tables for cake and food.  The rest rooms were located all the way in the back.The service during the party was great.  Water and wine was refilled frequently and the staff seemed to take great pains to make sure food and drink came out when we wanted it to.  There was plenty of space for guests to mill about and in general it was a very comfortable venue for a party.The food was okay, mostly made up of cheese plates and a vegetable plate.  I cannot speak to the other food offerings, but I would not mind going back to check them out.  The wine selection we were given was good, but we did not pick them specifically.I had a fun experience at The Winslow, and I look forward to going back as a regular customer.",4,,1

25,Kahliah L.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",5,12,10,5.0,2/12/2018,"I booked the back room at The Winslow for a going away party for my husband and I who have moved to Seattle from NYC. We wanted to have an event with a designated area for our friends and family, that was fairly close to a lot of trains, with some hearty appetizers late on a Saturday afternoon between 2 and 6 (without having to sell a kidney to pay for it). We figured friends could cover their own drinks. So we were looking for some space and nibbles for about 4 hours so that people could come and go as they pleased. I'd called and emailed around to a number of places and they all wanted at least $2K. Yeah, that wasn't happening. Moving is super expensive and that was WAY over budget for us. Luckily the wonderful staff at The Winslow got back to me. They were super responsive, knowledgeable and accommodating. Once they got back to me with pricing (Well under $1,000 INCLUDING TIP!) and confirmed that the date and time was available - which happened very quickly, everything else was smooth sailing. Emma and Cait were an immense pleasure to work with. Like, exceptional. That's saying something because about 60 percent of my customer service experiences during my 7 years in NYC were pretty crummy. These ladies were on top of it and incredibly professional. The menu options were varied and really reasonably priced and the food turned out to be delicious. I HIGHLY recommend the deviled eggs. I ordered a ton of them and at the end of the party still wished I had ordered more. The cocktail options were delicious and fun - there were a few drinks I had that were really good. We'd brought our own cake with us and, unlike some other places I've been in NYC, they didn't charge us a cake cutting fee and happily provided us plates, a knife, forks and then some containers for folks to take leftover cake home in. This may seem like it's not that big of a deal but I'm telling you, I've been places that are so cheap and stingy when it comes to this kind of thing. Since this is pretty glowing I'm sure you're now saying to yourself this experience couldn't have possibly been this awesome so here are my two nitpicks - minor things, really. The back room can get very warm but once they turned on the fans it cooled down quickly. When we asked they immediately came out to turn them on, no problem. Second nitpick - when we first arrived with my in-laws, our initial server had a bit of a tude and his vibe was frosty and unhelpful. That said, Mr. Frosty Beard seemed like an aberration because everyone else was on point. Luckily we ended up with another server who was SPECTACULAR. She was always there checking in, kept the food coming out and kept dirty plates cleared - just paid close attention to detail and was super helpful and willing to answer questions and promote menu items. I mean, a true rock star. Anyway, I write all this to say that If you're wondering whether or not you should host an event there, don't hesitate DO IT. I could not have been more happy to have my last social event in NYC (and I do mean my last, I was on a flight the next morning!) at The Winslow. They provided the perfect atmosphere and experience for some of my last hours in my adopted home saying goodbye to close friends and family. A crummy experience would have ruined those memories so going with them was the best choice hubby and I could have made. And when we go back to visit I'd go out of my way to meet up with family there - customer for life right here.",6,,2

29,Mad R.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,4,2,5.0,7/22/2018,"Just had a brunch party for my 22nd birthday today and let me just say, everything was fantastic. I was emailing back and forth with Cait and Emma for about a month and they were so nice and accommodating to each and every one of my needs. Besides responding to each of my questions quickly, they also allowed me to make a limited brunch menu with my choice of entrees which really made me feel like my party was personalized to what I knew my guests would like. Also, the fact that the minimum for 16 guests was only $300 is amazing, especially for a restaurant/pub in the city. They do ask to put a credit card down in case you cancel everything last minute (which is totally understandable) but they don't charge anything onto your card so that's not something you have to worry about.We were seated in the back room which was really nice because it kept the party intimate and just between me and my guests. The food was delicious and all of my guests were extremely happy with their meals. They all kept talking about how good the food was during brunch and after once we had left. Besides everything being delicious, food and drinks are also super reasonably priced and everyone left very satisfied. If you are thinking of hosting a party, definitely check out The Winslow!",1,,1
30,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1105,1096,3.0,7/29/2017,"Came in for a friend's going away party - they had the back room reserved so we didn't have to find a table or hover over the bar or anything. HH runs form 4-7, I believe, and the HH menu is pretty limited. My cocktail ordered during HH was only $1 cheaper than regular non-HH time, which was a bit of a bummer. Waitresses were pretty attentive and checked up on us often - by 8 or 9pm it started getting really crowded cause everyone was here after work so it got harder to flag them down but they came by often enough. Didn't really get a chance to try the food except the fries, fish/chips, and fried pickles. Fries or chips as they all them, were pretty good and came with two sauces. Fish in Fish and Chips were very meh. They had this overly fishy taste/smell to them that reeks of old fish.",2,1,1

They are made in books. Very cute idea.  The drinks were great tasting and strong.  I recommend getting the waiter/waitress input before ordering if you're not much of a drinker.  Each drink stayed true to the characteristic of its name.  We also got some salmon crumpets and cheese curds.  They are tapas portion but great snacks to go with a drink. During the night there was a guitarist playing on the front. The vibe was very relaxed. Would definitely come here again and would highly recommend this place.  It can be with friends or for a romantic dinner.,2,,3

I believe that within an hour of sitting at the bar that I became the target of a highly orchestrated racial hate attack. After only having a total of two drinks at this bar and 2 drinks prior to arriving, I was told that I was intoxicated. This kind of behavior is illegal under New York City, State and Federal law. I was asked to the leave the bar with no appropriate reason given when asked. When I refused to leave, the black bouncer held my right arm and wrist so tightly that it was twisted badly that I needed x-rays taken and splint placed on the arm for the entire week. I was then subsequently pushed out the bar by the black bouncer and fell on my face. Blood coming from my face, the NYPD did nothing to ensure my safety. I was taken to the hospital and given care for the head wound.

36,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,4.0,12/1/2016,"After grabbing drinks nearby this week, a group of us were debating where to get food. My friend's wife had a craving for fish and chips and we found this place would do just right. I remember being here a few years ago for another friend's birthday party. She had the small back room reserved. It's really quite beautiful. A little cozy, but a really cute spot if you don't have an overwhelming amount of friends. Solid British craft beers and ciders on tap. What they're known for are their gin cocktails. I think they even have a gin club here. I went with finally trying one. Could not resist the name ""Thank You for Smoking"", which is also a fantastic Jason Reitman movie. It was very smoky needless to say with some orange zest and an overwhelming amount of fernet. Which at this point, I didn't mind as it slowly acted as a digestive. Food that we had: The fish and chips - She said they were above average. This was after her third attempt in the past week of having a proper fish and chip experience. Well done, Winslow.Fried pickles - They make them both circular and the fried part is nice and fluffy and crunchy served with a horseradish mayo sauce. They were so freaking good.Sausage roll - Really juicy and flavorful. Served with a spicy brown mustard and gherkin pickles. A decent portion as well.Macaroni and cheese with bacon - Surprisingly excellent. Wasn't expecting anything outstanding but I was in a macaroni and cheese mood as it was dumping buckets of rain this night. The cheese was mostly gouda and I think cheddar and in copious amounts, creamy to the right consistency and the pasta I believe was Tubetti. Kind of a cross between a rigatoni noodle and the things you stuff like manicotti or cannelloni noodles but smaller. Tubes filled with cheese. Why have places not thought of using tubed macaroni before?! It's genius!",3,2,4

38,Lateefah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,138,171,3.0,9/22/2017,"Came here on a Sunday night to have an after movie drink. Getting its inspiration from pubs, the Winslow is a bar dedicated to serving different gin drinks. How cool is that? Gin being my favorite, go-to spirit, I think its pretty cool. For a Sunday night, the bar space was pretty crowded but there was still plenty of seating for a party of five. We were seated fast and provided table service to order drinks. There was some live music going on which was cool but loud. The cocktail menu uses some interesting and appealing ingredients if you want to try something new. Beet Juice. Carrots. Rose. Bee Pollen. Whole egg. The only downer was that they were out of ingredients for two of the cocktails I wanted. Drop Some Beets. Out of beet juice. Figging Amazing. Out of figs. I thought, as a cocktail bar, might offer alternative ingredients to fill in their place or make something similar. I have had this done at other bars but nope. That was okay though and I ordered the Shishito My Libido. Third time the charm. I really liked the smokiness of the shishito and the black pepper syrup added the right amount of spice. Not sure if I like the grapefruit though since it left a weird after taste in my mouth. My first time here was okay but I would love to come back regardless.",,,
39,Mina G.,"Brookline, MA",93,89,32,5.0,11/30/2017,"Went here for drinks, they have a nice atmosphere in a busy area. Some tables which is good for a change with candle lighting. They have happy hour from 5-7 with specials on beer, wine, cocktails, and gin. This is a gin bar so they have 2 pages of gin specials which isn't really common but great if you like gin. They have simple bar food like wings, salads, etc. Overall nice bar, friendly service and nice being able to sit down.",3,,3

42,Jon W.,"New York, NY",3012,290,1008,5.0,10/20/2016,"Cocktail Strong!The Winslow is a go to cocktail spot specializing mostly in Gin but they offer many other types. This dimly lit bar/restaurant offers an intimate vibe that is perfect for a first date. If you are a big group or a special event they do have a great back room which is fairly easy to reserve for dinner. From a drinks standpoint I like to get the simple gin and tonic which they really class up by putting in dried orange slices or rose pedals to really enhance the flavor and appearance. I do mix it up also as they make a great moscow mule! The bar tenders here are also really friendly and attentive even when it gets busy. My favorite one is adam who comes of like a cool surfer dude.From a food standpoint everything I have had hear is delicious my favorite items are the cheese curds, thai wings, and avocado toast! I mean with those 3 options you can not go wrong.In short:- Great First Date Spot- Delicious Pub Food- Great Cocktails- Good for big groups",20,5,18

The party also happened to be the first weekend of March Madness and we had a great TV in the party area for all of us to watch some of the games while pretending to act classy.",1,,1

The space was substantial and easily accommodated 30 guests. We were going to book the back room but then decided it would be too small, so the party was held on one side of the restaurant (3 high top tables). Cait and Flor were helpful and answered all of my questions about the flow of the party.  Cocktails were great (I really like a ""proper"" cocktail), and Cait's food suggestions were perfect. And it's in our neighborhood!  Stop looking around and book your event here.",1,,1

49,Andy L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,0,5.0,5/2/2018,"I held a reunion at the Winslow, and I had booked this event 3 months in advance. Cait was so great to work with and answered all my questions regarding food, direction for guests, and anything I was worried about in terms of planning. Then, Andrea, our server, was so attentive to our group and going around to ask if people wanted drinks etc, which I really appreciated. There was a minimum-spend if you wanted to book a space, but it wasn't too difficult to meet if you have a good amount of people show. The Winslow also had one of lowest minimums out of the 5 or 6 places I looked into. In addition, the space at the Winslow was much bigger than I expected and the atmosphere is great. There's plenty of music and lively crowd, but not too much where you can't hold a conversation between friends. In the end, the reunion went great, and I think everyone had a great time. I'd definitely recommend the Winslow to a great start of the night or spend the night for hanging out and catching up with friends. Personally, I'd definitely come back the next time I am in the city.",3,,2

I sent a bunch of emails to different bars and restaurants in Manhattan and they all require you to spend at least a 1k just to get a small room in the back, when I was about to give up I found The Winslow. Their prices were reasonable and it was exactly what I was looking for, the music is great, the food was good but beyond all of that their service was outstanding. Cait and Emma were very responsive, every time I had a question they got back to me right away and the waiter was also amazing!

Literally the guacamole stopped people mid conversation to comment on how good it was. We did a mix of the bottomless mimosas and bar drinks and everything was flowing very freely - hats off to the bar tenders and servers - they even gave us some extra time at the end of our hour and a half to get everyone one last top up which was so nice!  The server was amazing at keeping everyone's checks straight (over 30 people!!) which made it so easy for us to all close out.  One of my friends even left her card in the check holder and someone ran it out to her to make sure she didn't leave without it.A+ service and food!

The bar had a great atmosphere - nicely decorated, great music, plenty of space. The servers were so attentive and came around to get everyone's order even though people were scattered around the bar. I was able to focus on my friends rather than ordering/ my credit card.

We got the bottomless mimosas (which is only $12 extra per person) and got prettyyyy rowdy in the 1.5 hour timeslot we were allocated. Although it's a good deal for boozy brunch, the food is pretty overpriced and the portions run small unless you get the kale salad. I got the chicken & waffles, which were tasty but not completely filling. I guess that makes it easier for you to get drunk? IDK. TLDR: the booze is a good deal but the food is meh.",1,1,
60,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",874,1242,25,5.0,2/13/2017,"I helped my best friend plan a private party at The Winslow one Friday evening - we had the room from 8pm onward.   They have a private back room which you can reserve in advance which comfortably fits around 30-40 standing?  The private back room has one large table, 2-3 smaller ones and I'd say seating for 10 or so?  This is great option because the staff is incredibly helpful, friendly, the food is good (upscale British pub), and the drinks are crafty.  The best part also is that it's only $600 min of food and drink, and they are willing to run separate tabs. Somehow our server Cait was able to tell what should be on who's card..amazing. She was very friendly, prompt, and helpful - always checking on us. She also helped me get setup, as you are allowed to bring your own decorations and cake. And they have sparklers for the cake. :)On Fridays and weekends, there is a DJ who loves to play awesome 90s music.  They have great cocktails, to whiskey options, craft beers and wines. I'd say this is more of a craft beer and cocktail type of place. You can wash it down with platter from their party menu which also can go toward your min (it ranges from $25-50+ per platter and each platter is to feed 10 people).  We ordered sliders, chips (fries), pigs in a blanket, wings, scotch egg (so yummy). Think that was everything - I forget if there was more...In any case, The Winslow is a great option for a private party. Highly recommend this fun, casual spot with good people, food & drink.",6,2,8

We had a group of four, with four more people joining, and we were able to get a table easily. The table had full waitor/waitress service so we didn't need to get up for drinks. Turns out that this is a gin bar! I love gin so I was happy to see the huge selection they had. They had a whole key that explained if certain gins had fruity, spicy, citrus etc notes which was very helpful. Each gin and tonic was around 11-16 dollars depending on the type of gin. They did have drinks other than gin, which some of my friends got, and they were good, but I think if you come here gin should be the drink of choice. I tried several g and ts and they were all amazing! Very happy about finding this place, I know where to come for great gin and tonics in bar that's not overly crowded.",3,,3
63,Tina C.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,5.0,3/18/2018,"One of my absolute favorite bars. The bartenders are fantastic. The Gin and Tonics are works of art, paired with their complementary fruits and botanicals to really bring out the flavor of that particular gin. The bartenders are all very nice and knowledgeable and the ambiance is lovely.If you're free on a Tuesday, you should definitely check out Gin Club.' You start with a Gin and Tonic. While you drink, the host talks about the history of the gin and it's flavor profile. Then you get to make 2 cocktails that pair well with the particular gin and you're served some tasty snacks. The best part is that they raffle off a full bottle at the end of the event! I've won twice! All of this for less then 30$. Mark, who oversees Gin Club is the best! He always makes sure everyone is having a good time and he's very open to suggestions on improving the customer's experience. The last time I went, we made a more bitter cocktail that I didn't really like so he made sure that they offered a fruity alternative for the next gin club!Also, Brockmans Gin and Nolet's Gin are both amazing!",2,,2

I got the bees knees which was strong and had bee pollen on the top. They have it for $8 on happy hour some days which is a great deal! We got fried pickles, cheese curds and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese and cheese curds were to die for. The pickles had the batter your would normally find on a fried Oreo so the ratio of pickle to batter wasn't quite right for me but it wasn't bad. I will definitely be going back!",3,,3

All of the food was amazing, with the deviled eggs w/bacon and the shrimp being the favorites of the night! Staff was super friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The room was perfect as it does lend some privacy without feeling completely isolated from the rest of the bar, and there were no crazy deposits or fees or other NYC red tape to reserve it.

We sat at the bar during our first visit, and ordered wine, not knowing that the specialty of the bar is gin cocktails. The wine was decent, and our bartender was very professional and attentive. The space has cute decorations, with a main dining room in the back and a couch and small tables in the bar area. When we came back the second time, it was very crowded since it was a Friday night at 8 pm. The hostess/cocktail waitress was kind and tried her best to find us some seats. We ended up sitting on a very comfy couch across from the bar. The hostess said she would be back with some waters and to take our orders, but we didn't see her for 10 minutes. That is understandable, because it seemed like she was the only person taking orders from everyone who was not seated at the bar. Finally, we ended up ordering from the bartenders. We got the Jessica Rabbit and Aged Before Beauty drinks. Both of the cocktails were refreshing and the Aged Before Beauty had a nice, mildly spicy kick to it. The Jessica Rabbit was heavy on the lime, but you could still taste the hibiscus and rose bud flavors. The cocktails are reasonably priced and we look forward to trying the other drinks on the menu. Overall - 9/10",2,,2

I've been working with Cait over the past month to plan a bridal shower for my friend in their semi-private back room. Unfortunately, I've had to cancel the party (due to NO fault of The Winslow's), and one of the main reasons I'm so disappointed is because I've had such a wonderful time working with Cait and I was really looking forward to hosting this party there. Cait has been the most responsive events manager I've ever had the pleasure of working with. She always responds promptly to emails and calls, and is eager to help you plan the logistics and menu of your gathering. The Winslow is really accommodating for group parties-- to reserve the back room you only need a minimum of 20 people and hit a bar tab of $600. They allow your guests to each have a separate bar tab and each goes towards the over all minimum for the reservation. They have a GREAT catering menu, with tea sandwich platters, deviled eggs, chicken and veg skewers, cheese plates, fries, shishito peppers, hummus, etc... everything was so fairly priced and there's really something for everyone If you're looking for somewhere to host a party or gathering, The Winslow is where you need to be!

We planned a fantastic night in less than 2 days. The special events menu is great. I ordered the beef and pork sliders, pigs in a blanket (which were definitely not ones you make at home) and the avocado toast. All were delicious!

I booked the semi-private back room and it was the perfect size for our 25 or so people. This must be one of the only places in NYC that allows you to reserve a space like this with no money down and only a very reasonable minimum spend - and the fact that they allow that minimum spend to be counted up from everyone's separate tabs is extra surprising. I was able to throw an amazing surprise party without having to take on all of the expense or having to ask people to pay me for their drinks afterwards. Cait and Emma were awesome to work with prior to the event. Our assigned server, Catarina (sorry if I got the spelling wrong!) was incredible. She was so so attentive and our guests said that they were never waiting around without a drink. She was also super friendly and really helped ensure a positive vibe throughout the night. I ordered some of the food from the party menu and it was brought out throughout the night without me having to check on it or ask (it was also delicious, get the sweet potato fries!!). After 11 or so, the dance music really kicked in and we all had a blast grooving for the rest of the night.

So basically I feel right at home.The drink menu consists of a varietal of gin and tonics and craft cocktails. My favorite drink here has to be the Jessica Rabbit (the lavender bitters are awesome). There hasn't been a drink that I didn't like at The Winslow. They do put a lot of thought and care into their cocktails.Live music happens on some nights which adds to the chill vibe of this bar. The signage out front never fails to entertain. It's also a great date spot but chilling with a few good friends is good too. 4 stars, solid. 5 stars during a dope rugby game.",2,,2

The service however was almost nonexistent.  There was adequate waitstaff but it took 30 min to get eggs and pancakes (???) and another 20 to get the check. I had to flag down a busboy for more hot water for tea and he brought back my used teacup instead of bringing a container to the table. We had to put on our coats and stand at the bar to get a check. Won't be going back.,,,

88,Elizabeth S.,"San Carlos, CA",348,817,542,1.0,5/20/2016,"You've got to be kidding me with the rating on this place which is why my bf and I ended up here.  I should have read the reviews.  Generalized, complimentary adjectives free of details describing a genuine experience (overuse and abuse of ""good, awesome & nice"") does not tell me anything special.  As a visitor to my favorite US city, it was a shame we wasted a meal here with all the excellent food NYC has to offer.  We were here for brunch a little before 2pm the day the Eurovision contest was to occur at 3.  Apparently, that was good reason to deny us of the bottomless mimosas.  We didn't even know what Eurovision was and had no plan on sitting there past 3 getting wasted.  How nice of the server to assume though.We opted for the $4 a glass mimosas which was reasonable and fine with us.  The hilarity of ""bottomless"" was repressed within when we were served our second from a mimosa filled carafe though.  We didn't even get to three thanks to the quality of our food.  I ordered the eggs benedict with ham over crumpets which came with a salad.  My bf ordered the fish and chips.  Neither of us liked our food contrary to the photo.  His fries were soggy and bland.  The fish was watery, and under cooked.  It was unusually stringy also.  It definitely wasn't cod.  -maybe, undercooked flat fish or saithe??  My eggs benedict looked good upon a glance.  However, there were only two things good about it.  The Hollandaise sauce was tasty, and the chef poached the eggs properly.  However, beneath this saucy mess laid a stale crumpet and some dried up tasteless meat that tasted nothing like ham.  It was so insipid and dull in color.  I don't even know what sort of meat it was, and I wasn't eating Chinese!  The salad could have been good with the light vinaigrette, but it was drenched in oil.  At least it was fresh.We had to wait about 15 or more minutes to get the bill when the place wasn't close to full capacity.  The waiter seemed to dodge my attention after making eye contact with me.  He was polite but not very friendly.  As we waited the couple behind us just got their food and asked the guy who delivered for something at which he replied, ""I'm not your server.""  Nice, nice...  just more reinforcement that the Winslow does not live up to its Yelp rating.If you're visiting or even reside here just say ""hell no"" to this place!",4,4,2

96,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,4.0,4/16/2016,"This used to be one of my go-to bar in East Village, especially during my stint doing online dating.  The Winslow isn't anything special at a glance.  It's spacious, has a small outdoor seating area, and a good atmosphere.  But there's nothing that makes it stand out in this regard from other bars in the area.  If anything, it's a bit pricier.  However, what it lacks in originality it makes up in consistency.For example, the beer list doesn't have any crazy beers available, but it does have under-appreciated stalwarts like Fullers London Pride. The drink list isn't too long, but what's there is thoughtful and well put together.  If you like gin--and I do--in particular they have a lot of great options, including a few riffs on the Negroni.  The bartenders here are skilled and friendly (an increasingly rare combo in the era of mixology), and the servers are also quick given the size of the place.  Food has always looked good but I've never partaken.  Overall if you're looking for a nice, mid-key bar in this area this one of the best options.  I wasn't a believer at first, but it made me one.  Give it a shot and it may make you one too.",2,1,

98,Erin E.,"Manhattan, NY",97,100,168,5.0,12/28/2015,"The Winslow is one of my most favorite bars in the city. The first time I went, I fell in love with their gin cocktails - specifically the Hendricks Gin with cucumber and rose petals (YUM). I also loved that the bar had a laid back atmosphere while still being classy, not pretentious, and not divey. I decided to have my birthday party there this past September. I called the bar and spoke with Aiden who was the nicest human ever. He was so accommodating in terms of tables, party size, everything. He followed up with me a few days before my party to confirm the reservation and let me know that he wouldn't be there - but Kieran would, and he was filled in on everything. When I arrived for my party, Kieran (who, it turns out, is also the nicest human) led my group right to our table and made sure we were all set with drinks. I also ordered food for the table - Thai wings (SO GOOD), pickles, cheese plate, some other things that I can't remember but it was all delicious. It was a great night, and all of my friends had a great time.Between the atmosphere, the great drinks and food, and the amazing staff, this bar is very very high up on my list.",3,3,2

Cait was super responsive and let me put up my own decorations and bring a cake (which they provided plates and utensils for). She was very accommodating to my many requests and was truly a delight to work with. It was so nice they they could do separate tabs to meet a very modest minimum for the space we had booked. Claire was an excellent server and a pleasure to work with as well.Everyone commented on how awesome of a venue I had chosen. The music was also GREAT - the DJ took requests and had us dancing on our feet until the wee hours of the night.

Cait and Emma were so accommodating leading up to the event, and Kat was the perfect hostess handling our group. They helped me orchestrate a blue colored gin drink, as autism awareness is our cause, and even donated a $50 gift card to raffle off.

I just wrapped up a surprise 30th birthday party for my best friend here last Saturday, 12/10/2016, and I couldn't have picked a more perfect spot.We had our party in the back room which I reserved around 7 months ago. From planning with Emma every little detail such as the menu, the time to start decorating, the decorations allowed for the venue, they have responded to all my inquiries well within 24 hours from my email. Little did I know that SantaCon would be on the same day, so imagine our surprise when we had to get through a crowded throng of drunken Santas to get a headstart on our decoration a few hours before the party. I had called the bar, Cait answered, and she got it taken care of, and we were in after just a few minutes to do our thing, with Mark and Aidan helping us out.The party went off without a hitch, with all the below highlights:~ They invented a specialty gin and tonic for the birthday celebrant named after her and even provided menus for it for guests~ Aidan helped us with our helium tank, blew up our large balloons for us, and provided us everything we needed for decorating the place to be ready for the party~ Our server, Naomi, was the best at attentiveness the whole night, she did not skip a beat making sure everyone got their orders, and was the most pleasant person~ Their food was phenomenal, from their Scotch eggs, to the cheese curds, noms! Everyone loved the food, and it was all served right on time~ They brought out our birthday cake with an awesome sparkler in it for dessert - it looked gorgeous!!!All in all, I would highly recommend this place for your large party needs. You will get the most attentive dream team helping you put it together, they will treat you like a friend when you're setting up, and they will deliver and execute flawlessly to make sure everything goes without a hitch.

From the space and ambiance, to the staff, to the drinks, the food, and the music, everything came together perfectly, my husband had the time of his life, and all of his friends kept thanking me for throwing such a great party -- but I really had the Winslow to thank for that!Having never actually been there before, and planning the whole thing from out of town, I put my faith in Yelp reviews and a perusal of the website, menu, and photos when first considering it, but it was the responsiveness, friendliness, and helpfulness of the staff that ultimately sealed the deal for me. I worked primarily with Emma on the planning, and she was great at helping me choose what part of the bar to use based on our party's size, and was so patient in guiding me through the menu options. I leaned on Cait's expertise in finalizing details as well, and was so happy to meet her the night of the party, since I knew she was keeping an eye on things and looking out for us. Our designated server, Clare, was an absolute gem - she was cool, calm, and collected all night, keeping everything running smoothly, which allowed me to just enjoy myself and not have to worry about a thing. Thank you Clare!! And the rest of the staff that was there that night were equally awesome!The drink menu was exciting and inventive, and the food was great too! (We had some platters of wings, sliders, and pot pies that everyone seemed to enjoy.) They were great about letting us bring in a cake, and brought it out with a sparkler and plenty of plates and forks for all. I think it says a lot that we ended up being there for well over 6 hours and the night felt like it flew by. We were probably an amusing site, a bunch of 30- and 40-somethings turning the space into a dance floor while the DJ played songs from our college days. I know it was exactly what my husband wanted in every way, and the Winslow was able to help us achieve, and exceed, our hopes and expectations!!",3,,3

They just don't exist. That's until you stop by The Winslow. My new favorite unicorn. The Winslow provided me with everything I could have wanted for my most recent birthday party. Planning a birthday party could be tricky. I don't like really loud places, I like to secure a section for my group, and I enjoy a proper drink. I feel that no one place has all of the qualifications. I reserved the private area, which is open, in the back. Nice spot, a couple of tables with benches. A couple of comfy chairs, and several stools. They said it could hold 35 people, I think that's a bit of an exaggeration. You can easily have 20 at a time in there. My party stayed in the back area, within the room and a bit outside of it. The music could be lowered in our section, which we did, so we could hear ourselves. The music was still pumping elsewhere and didn't distort anyone's ability to have a good time. The place also have us the ability to bring out a birthday cake and helped setup. Our server was very friendly and did a good job of keeping up with everyone's order. There were lots of people and they had no issue of taking multiple cards. That was clutch. The place itself makes fantastic cocktails, mostly gin based. It's important to me to drink something besides just shots and beer. Mixed well drinks are not my thing. I couldn't have been happier.

The party was held in the semi-private back room and worked perfectly (we had about 30-35 people there). We wanted a casual but fun vibe and this is exactly what we got. Their minimum to book the room was one of the best deals we encountered and they even allowed us to meet the minimum using separate tabs from our guests.The staff was AMAZING. From the start, Cait and Emma were extremely responsive to my questions and were super accommodating about every single detail. They let us decorate the room with flowers and balloons, play our own music, and stored our cupcakes until we were ready for them.

If you're looking for an establishment where you can sit and talk to your friends with plenty of space, this is the spot for you. Music was pretty good too! We originally had 2 tables reserved in the back for my party, but then the servers let us move to the more private back room which was great too. The only downside was that the temperature was on the hotter side at the back of the bar (the front of the bar was a good temperature). Overall, I'd definitely recommend hosting a party at this establishment. The servers were great and it was a very reasonable price to reserve for a big party, especially if you're not looking to break your wallet in NYC.

Gaston kindly had our food boxed and brought the check without the slightest issue. As we rushed out, he chased us down on the street and brought me my credit card which I had left due to the hurry we were in. Thank you Gaston!!In order to properly enjoy our experience here, we came back Sunday for brunch. Casey served us, making the incredibly tasty Bee's Knees drinks for us and bringing our eggs benedict(s), one with salmon and the other with ham. They were very satisfying with a nice side salad and a flawless presentation. Apparently, when we came for brunch, Arsenal was playing Chelsea in football so a few fans were present to cheer on their team. I think Arsenal was losing as there was an unhappy camper or two. We focused on our drinks, espresso, and brunch. Yum!I highly recommend the Winslow for late night drinking, dinner, or brunch. It's friendly, happening, spacious, and quite delicious!",2,,
129,Olivia C.,"McLean, VA",0,14,0,1.0,2/25/2018,"Not trying to exaggerate but this place was really bad. The atmosphere is great and it's cool to be around so many passionate Arsenals fans, but the service is awful and the food isn't that great either. I would not recommend coming here for brunch or during peak times unless you're just drinking/hanging out with friends. The waitresses are not attentive and do not check on you throughout the meal. And flagging them down doesn't seem to work. I ordered the pancake and it was massive and piping hot. But it only came with one small cup of syrup, which isn't nearly enough for a serving this large. I ran out of syrup right away and then it took 15 mins of failed attempts to flag our waitress down before I finally had to go up to the bar and ask the bartender for syrup. He told the waitress, who later came to tell me that it would cost 50 cents per extra cup of syrup. I've never been somewhere where they charge you for syrup for your pancakes/waffles/etc. By the time the waitress brought me more syrup, my pancake was cold. Cold syrup on a cold pancake is not worth $13. We also did bottomless mimosas, but because the wait staff disappeared, we didn't really get to take advantage of the 2 hour deal. We even moved our empty glasses to the edge of the table so that our waitress could clearly see we need a refill. But she never stopped by. We were there for 2 hours and only saw our waitress twice - once to bring me syrup and another to bring the check. So no one got the refills they paid for when it came to the bottomless mimosas. 0/10 do not recommend this place.",,,
130,John H.,"New York, NY",3,6,0,2.0,5/5/2017,"This used to be my wife and my favorite Friday night spot....until they turned it into hipster central and moved a couch in as opposed to chairs for seating. Let's be honest, you're barely even in the east village and you're not in BK, so stop trying. They also used to switch up the menu, not anymore. Too many great places to go in the city, I wouldn't waste my time or money here.",2,,

The place is really cute & has a welcoming and cozy vibe, which is a nice treat considering how close it is to Union Square. They are well known for their gin cocktails, but I had a couple of glasses of wine as I was not in the mood for liquor.  The cocktails did look excellent though - will definitely have to try next time!We also ordered one of each of the crumpets - Smoked Salmon, Lamb, & Duck.  They were so delicious!! My favorite was the Lamb, but at only $5 a pop you really can't go wrong trying them all. :) The rest of their food menu looked really good - a nice take on British/Scottish/Irish (?) cuisine. I'd also love to try their brunch!!Overall, this is a great bar.  Plenty of seating, nice crowd & ambience, good service, & great food & drinks!",,,

There was even some drunken dancing, though nothing obnoxious. Late-twentysomethings will have fun here.",3,,

It was the perfect spot for a group of people that size- didn't get too crowded. The minimum group spend was only $500 which was easy to reach with that many people. The waitress was also very friendly and attentive and kept coming back to check in and take orders. They have an extensive cocktail menu with a lot of unique drinks and the DJ was pretty solid. Only losing one star because being in the back room wasn't conducive to mingling at all- it would have been nice if it was slightly more open.,1,,

Cait, Emma, and the staff at the Winslow were extremely receptive to any questions or requests I had while booking and that night! We rented two of the high tops which was perfect for our group. When our party grew larger than expected (around 35 people) our waiters didn't even blink an eye in accommodating everyone. I was allowed to bring in a cake from an outside bakery and even have it delivered there and stored. I didn't book food for the party, but a few people ordered some apps and they were all delicious.The drinks were AWESOME, especially the speciality cocktails. The DJ was so nice and played perfect music that kept the vibe going.I highly recommend the Winslow, no matter the size of your party and will probably use the bar in the future!",2,,3
136,Nina K.,"Manhattan, NY",246,73,29,4.0,9/11/2016,"Great spot for drinks/going out (especially if you're a gin fan) and an ideal venue if you're looking to host a small event! After enjoying the vibe and convenient location of The Winslow in the past, I had my birthday party there and it was a great success. The team is attentive and responsive in the planning stages and helped me select the best setup for my group. Best of all: no rental fees/ridiculous bottle buying policies -- just an achievable minimum for the group to meet. Event logistics aside, The Winslow is clean with ample seating and creative, tasty cocktails. All huge pros in my (obviously not so cool) book. Love the British influence/gin expertise as well as the food options. It's also a refreshingly nice spot in an otherwise pretty grungy stretch of 14th Street, tbh. The only drawback I can think of is pricetag: though quite casual, The Winslow does not fancy itself a dive bar and the drink prices reflect that (do not recall any cocktails under $11 and most were in the $12 - $14 range). That said, worth it for an evening well spent!",1,1,1

138,Gloria L.,"New York, NY",9,10,2,5.0,9/29/2016,"Wedding planning + New York City. Two very stressful things. In the midst of planning a full wedding weekend, I realized that I needed a venue for the 'Sunday Brunch' after party for about 30-35 people. My main requirements were: a bar or pub that serves good food, a central location, not too loud, not too many tv screens blaring football, the ability to make a reservation without having to spend too much on holding a space and a space where people could drop by without all having to be there at the same time before we could sit down. No small task!After looking at countless venues in Manhattan and Brooklyn and asking around, I somehow found The Winslow. My husband and I could not have been happier with our experience.We were able to host our event in their semi-private room for 5 hours while meeting a very reasonable minimum spend. The service was great, their food was delicious and it wasn't too noisy. We both say it was one of the most relaxing parts of the weekend because our friends and family were all able to gather together and say goodbye in a laid-back and fun setting. Two things worth noting as well - we were able to split the bill into separate tabs for everyone and the spacious semi-private room has a comfy couch which made it feel like we were in someone's living room. Thank you!!!",1,,1

If you're trying to host an event and want a place that's spacious, accommodating, and fun because we started our own mini-dance party, I highly recommend The Winslow.As for drinks, if you love gin, this is your heaven.

142,Sarah D.,"Nashville, TN",180,11,1,5.0,5/23/2016,"I held my boyfriend's [surprise] graduation party for 20+ people here last week and we had a wonderful time. I had been to the Winslow before for drinks and chose it for the location (convenient after work for most) the general vibe (country-charm meets vintage luxury) and the availability of a private back room. From the planning to the actual day of, everything was perfectly lovely and the staff at the Winslow made my job easy. The manager Kieran was so sweet, he even helped me amp up the surprise by dimming the back room lights so everyone could jump up and yell ""surprise!"". All our guests actively commented on how they loved the space, the drinks were plentiful and strong, and the food was perfectly timed coming out throughout the night. We were able to put the food on one check, and everyone who came was able to get their individual or group's drinks on separate checks. That's a MUST for planning group get-togethers, IMO and our server was super accommodating throughout the night.We ordered small hors d'ouvres plates a few days ahead of time: tomato-cheddar sandwiches, smoked salmon crumpets, crudites, wings, deviled eggs. Deviled eggs were to DIE for (bacon on top!). Crudites were a nice offset to the rest of the heavier food, mostly radishes and cauliflower with some broccoli. In the future I might not choose the crumpets, but I think just because in general they're not my favorite kind of carbohydrate (bready and sortof not worth the calories). The tomato-cheese sandwiches were adorable 1"" squares that were very snackable...if you're ordering those, order a lot because they'll go down quick. The staff here really made us feel special and I'm sure that not only the boyfriend and I, but some of our guests will be back to visit the Winslow in the future.",3,1,1

I went here on a Sunday night around 9:30pm with three other fabulous ladies. The atmosphere is amazing - cozy and familiar, yet trendy and modern. It felt like a bite out of Williamsburg. There was a fantastic singer singing in the front and there was a crowd gathered near him. I think his name was John Shmidt - this man was the star of the night! He had us dancing and singing along to it all, from Sheryl Crowe to Bill Withers to Bruno Mars to Billy Joel to Boys 2 Men. He really made our night!!! Was told this place is known for their gin and tonics, and my Winslow VIP friend recommended the Dorothy Parker gin and tonic (isn't on the menu). Tried hers and it was delicious so had to get one for myself. At just $10, it was worth it. In short, awesome atmosphere, fast and friendly waiter holding down the fort, great live music, and good drinks. Go here; you won't be disappointed!",21,8,20

The managers Cait and Emma made planning super easy and the party food selection is great (the mushroom sliders and scotch eggs were the biggest hits!). The other servers were very attentive and we never waited long to get our drinks. We asked them to bring out the food as the night went on and the kitchen's timing was great. I was impressed overall by how great the service was for such a big group! Our party size was a little too big for their private room in the back so we reserved the three high top tables in the middle section of the bar. It was perfect and not too crowded at all. They had a very reasonable minimum ""spend"" to reserve the space that we easily met. Some other places we checked out had minimums 3-4x what The Winslow asked for. The back room was also booked for an event, and it looked great for a birthday or other party.",1,,1

They have TVs all over the place and make viewing easy. To get a seat at the bar you should get there early, but there are plenty of other tables inside and outside - only thing is you might have to sacrifice a view of whatever sporting event is going on.I got the Bee's Knees based on other Yelper's reviews and photos, and the elderflower drink... Forgot the name of that one. Both were great. Ask your server for recommendations if you don't know what to get. Ours was very knowledgeable! Cocktail list is lengthy with lots of fun options.

Such a great gin selection- gin and tonics are my drink of choice so I was so excited to see the 10 they have on the menu! Almost too many to choose from. They also some really quality cider (the original was my favorite- tastes just like apple cider; dangerously good). We each got two different house gin and tonics when visiting. The bartender (guessing he is owner as well) gave us one to try too (it was so delicious- a little sweeter) and told us about the gin events they hold weekly!

I went with the Mary Pickford since I'm a bit of lightweight.My one complaint is the noise level, but that's not something under the bar's control. It's a very big place that attracts large groups 20-somethings.

Pros:* One of the nicer bar lounges on 14th street with an elegant, warm, and unpretentious atmosphere. * Winslow is perfect for large parties- I reserved the semi-private room in the back that can hold up to 35 people max. When 65 people ended up coming, the room obviously became super cramped so many ventured out into the main bar space, which was totally fine. If I were to do this again with the same number of people, I would reserve the 1-2 additional tables right next to the semi-private room. * The best part about The Winslow was the excellent service. Unlike similar lounges like Stanton Social or Verlaine's, The Winslow is one of the few, if not only, slightly higher-end Manhattan bars that do not require an initial deposit, a crazy minimum charge, and one or limited tabs for parties. They also offer open bar specials, but I decided to go with the easier cash/credit bar! * Keiran, one of the managers, was so nice and easy to work with. He always replied to my emails promptly whenever I had any questions. When he mistakenly informed me the Happy Hour ended at 8PM (when it was 7PM), he still kept his promise for my group. They were so easy-going that they let me re-arrange the furniture in the semi-private space. Rory was sweet and friendly, and all my friends were happy with how quickly he came back with our drink orders, especially when he was our only server. Throughout the night, both Kieran and Rory made sure to ask me how my friends and I were doing. * The food here is delicious! I ordered several party platters (which you order 2 days before your event), which my friends loved! The winning hors d'oeuvres that night were the Pigs in a blanket, Goat cheese and fruit compote, Deviled eggs with crispy bacon, Grilled cheddar and tomato sandwiches, and Smoked Salmon Crumpets. * The Winslow is known more for their gin cocktails. I gravitate towards fruitier and sweeter drinks, so I loved the Garden of Eden $11 (Gin, St. Germaine, Lime/Lemon). Happy Hour Specials:Cocktail of the day - $7Gin and Tonic of the day - $7Draft beer - $5Wine - $5Post-Happy Hour:Cocktails - $10-$12Beers - $5-$8Wines - $8-12* During busy nights Fri-Sat- they had DJ sessions starting around 10PM. The electronic music was fun and not over-the-top brash like dubstep. * My GF surprised me with a birthday cake, and without any extra charge The Winslow added big sparkers on top and brought out plates and cutlery for everyone. Kieran and Rory, thank you so much for making my 30th birthday so fun and easy!!",39,4,15

We did plates of sliders, pigs in a blanket, wings, mini grilled cheeses (I think that's it) and honestly, all of it was fabulous and our guests loved it. We also brought in a cake from an outside vendor and Kieran and the whole team at The Winslow were so accommodating about setting it up, plating it and making sure all of our guests were happy. The service was great all night - the private room has cocktail waiter service but everyone gets their own tab, which is perfect for a birthday party. Everything was extremely affordable as well - we had a TON of food for our 40 guests for just about $300.

The Bee's Knees cocktail we got was the cocktail of the day and had a good helping of gin while also remaining refreshing. Additionally we also got a serving of fried pickles, which were different from any fried pickles I've ever had. They were small, whole pickles that had been batter fried and served with some ranch. While surprising in appearance, these pickles were actually pretty good and a great snack to have alongside some gin.

The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. Even when we spilled a glass of water (before the boozing even happened btw), they were fun and made jokes with us about it. Located on 14th street, I was shocked that on a late Sunday, there were no NYU kids destroying the place. Instead there was a few low key tables scattered around the restaurant. It was pretty comfortable especially since they seated people facing the football games in the back area. We started our meal with an order of scotch eggs for the table to share, which I found very tasty.  The egg was cooked very nicely especially with the fried crispy outer layer of sausage. The sauce was a nice touch. Slight herbed mayo to bring it all together.  For the entrees we got a burger and fries and chicken and waffles.  The burger was huge and tasty. The fries were cooked well. I got the chicken and waffles which was prepared well but be warned that the chicken is all dark meat.  If you like it, i highly suggest it.  Well seasoned and crisp. I want to also mention that the unlimited brunch is for mimosa only.  They offer other cocktails if you do not want to get unlimited or would like to be charged extra for other drinks. Service was a little slow on the mimosas. They were not super busy but I think they were just pacing us. Not my favorite thing for a server to do but understandable I guess.",4,3,3

From the first phone call to my visit to the bar to see the space to my actual event and every other interaction in between, their team has been wonderful, accommodating and professional. Of the 15 birthdays I've celebrated in Manhattan this has by far been the easiest most pleasant experience. We were able to reserve 3 huge tables with leather couch-type booth seating (for a very nominal minimum-spend requirement), we were able to bring our own cupcakes, our waitress was friendly and patient and got all our orders right which included most guests opening their own tabs and paying for their own drinks. I also ordered a bunch of appetisers and food for our 3 tables and everything was taken care of impeccably. Their fat chips (fries) and fried pickles, mac and cheese and cheese curds were terrific.

Our group intended to head out to the Blind Pig, but without a reservation Blind Pig was way too crowded so we wanted next door to the Winslow. It was beautifully decorated and took us with no wait, so seemed perfect.The trouble started when our food came out at all different times. We waited over 10 minutes for the final person's fish and chips to arrive and finally he demanded we begin eating since it had been so long. He stopped the waiter to ask about the progress, and was told his order was forgotten but would get started right away. On my first bite, my food was COLD. Granted, I'd waited ten minutes to begin eating, but the food temperature of my Salmon Benedict was close to if the food had been sitting out for over 30 minutes. After everyone finished their meal the fish and chips still didn't arrive. We were all done and our friend was starving, we waited another 5 until he finally asked them to cancel. The place was decent about it, but obviously could have done better.The final kicker, within an hour of eating there I've gone from feeling fine to sipping ginger tea with the hopes I don't get ill everywhere. I can't do anything that I planned to do this afternoon because I just keep rocking back and forth wondering what was wrong with my meal. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever be back.",2,,

And they are not wrong in doing so, because WOW.On any given night, I think I could give this bar anywhere from 3.5 to 5 stars. I went on a Friday night around 11pm, which is obviously prime time. I shouldn't have expected anything less from the crowd. It was packed and already getting a little rowdy. As it should - it's a good-sized bar on the edge of the East Village, so it's pretty central. By the grace of God, my friend and I had one of those moments that is often one that can't make the jump from fantasy and reality: as we were looking for seats at the bar (I get the sense that the back is reserved for parties), we spotted a couple that was slowly but surely putting on their coats. Ah! Rarely spotted in the wild on a Friday night, people abandoning prime real estate! We quickly snatched up and were a very happy pair. The reason I even mentioned giving The Winslow 3.5 stars is the aggressive arm-reaching that was going on behind us, next to us, sometimes through us. Like, just, chill, people. You will get your drinks. Deep breaths.But about those drinks. Did I say wow? Oh, right, I said: WOW. After doing some research and getting advice from a Winslow regular, I decided to stick with gin and tonics. I wish I could've gotten them all, but I'm not sure I'd remember any of them, had I gone that route. I ended up getting Death's Door Gin and the Bulldog Gin. My friend got the Brooklyn Gin (the latter two shown here). Refreshing and rustic. The cocktails really brought out the hint of earthiness in gin which might sound a bit odd for a drink, but it was quite nice.Bartenders clearly had their hands full given the volume of people, but the woman helping us still managed to be attentive and personable so two thumbs up for her. I believe her name was Katie. You go, Katie, you go (if that is in fact your name).",2,,
160,Angela H.,"New York, NY",297,20,43,4.0,3/13/2016,"First things first - this is a gin bar, so if you're not a fan of gin, I'd say there are better bars out there for you. They really only serve three things - gin, beer, and wine. However, if you do like gin, I'd say this is a don't miss spot as they have one of the better selections I've seen. I got the Ford's gin - very smooth and well mixed. Stronger than I anticipated too! The Hendricks gin is also great, the subtle floral note from the rose petals and cucumber complement the gin well. The atmosphere is also laid back but lively, I took some out of town friends here for a drink before dinner and they thought it was a great place to sit and talk for a bit without having to scream at each other. I've also been later on a Friday night (probably around midnight), and they had a DJ playing a mix of popular songs (I believe it ranged from Sorry to Don't Stop Believin'). Seems like a lot of people in their mid to late 20's tend to celebrate their birthdays here - there's always a birthday party in the back room when I'm there on the weekends!One thing - last time I went, 4 of us split the tab for a table of 5 (the waitress said it was not a problem). However, after she gave us our receipts, we noticed that she overcharged each credit card by about 30%, which is more than expected even if the tip was included. As we were in a rush we didn't bother getting it fixed, but it did leave a bad taste in my mouth.",2,,

The Winslow opened fairly recently and I was pleasantly surprised because at first glance it might look very fancy, much to my liking, it turned out to be a great low-key spot after all! The service is excellent and the bartenders are very friendly (a rarity in my opinion).I tried a couple of side dishes at first, including the Mac and Cheese and two variations of Crumpets they have. Everything was excellent and I wasn't into one of the crumpets and they offered to exchange them with no extra cost. They didn't have to do that. Talk about going above and beyond!  The lamb crumpets were particularly great. I've never seen it very crowded there and later in the night you're likely to see impromptu dance parties pop up in the bar area. On Sunday they have a couple guys who set up a keyboard, acoustic guitar, and get a really good vibe going. I actually considered saving HBO for Mondays instead to take advantage of Sundays at the Winslow. Bold statement, I know. The whole place is spotless, has excellent decor, and the food and service are on point. I also love the outdoor seating they have and last time I was there, they kept them out until the wee hours of the morning for us. All around a GREAT selection! Props.",3,,1

She gave me lol service saying it wasn't her fault so I asked her to ask her manager. Her manager refused so I asked to speak em with the manager. The manager came after an hour ""phone meeting"" and said that it was our fault. I said I know but I'm asking for a customer courtesy and that even chipotle gives you another bowl of you drop yours on the way out. She offered us half a flatbread.

Currently they do not offer a happy hour. Drinks range from $6 for beers to around $11-13 for cocktails. The bar has a great gin selection but they have so much more to offer beyond that.,,,

Known for their gin based drinks you'll find many gin cocktails, some whiskey and beers. I usually come here for the weekend and Gaston and Adam are the fantastic guys behind the bar serving up amazing drinks. They're super speedy and don't ever make you feel rushed despite people queuing up. Can't say enough amazing things about the staff - every single person is friendly and genuine. General crowd is 20s-30s and can get quite loud but it's an energetic atmosphere. As the night goes on you'll find some people dancing in the back. Overall a fairly classy but fun place. They have TVs around before the later crowd gets in for those who like to watch sports with their drinks/dinner. The Winslow has become a go to bar for any sort of night, whether you want to start it off with a chill cocktail or have a great time dancing with friends it's always there for you. Love it!!",,,

Picked the location out of convenience as well as the fact that our friend swore by the burgers, claiming that they were the best in NYC (they're not). The Winslow is everything you would except from a NYC Pub in east village - great vibes and a relatively young crowd. We all got their bacon cheese burger and split some orders of cheese curds, and while the burger was filling and to the point, there was nothing that really stood out for me. Definitely would see myself going back as a local, but if you're in town for the weekend or extended vacation - there are plenty of other places to experience in NYC.",1,,

I've been a huge gin fan for a few years now and can tell you this place has an abundance to choose from. Hailing from SF-my go to is the St.George from Mt.Tam is my absolute favorite. It tastes just like nature, and if you know me, anything with a herbal overtone is sure to please my buds. If you don't already know, Gin was used as a medicinal waaay back. So, of course, I opted for the one with St.George and Sage. WOW. It tasted like a forest in my mouth. I guess I'm that much of a naturalist. We also ordered some food-the usual, burgers, mac and cheese, and a pile full of fries. What I absolutely loved was the Brioche bun :)I would come back for drinks if you're looking for a low key vibe.",2,1,1

I had just downed a ton of meat at Mighty Quinn's on a Sunday afternoon and JAK and I were ready to settle in for some cocktails. Since it was early, some of our neighborhood favorites weren't open yet. We happened to be standing outside The Winslow when we said to each other ""Why not just try out this place?"". And so it was. There were two seats open at the end of the long bar, which we grabbed up. The bartender was nice and friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She told us a little about the cocktails, how they are prepared, and helped us each choose one we might like. Turns out, she's really good at her job, because we loved what we ordered. I went with the Amaretto Sour (bourbon, amaretto, lemon, egg whites) and I really liked it. I wound up having three. Not only were they beautifully presented (swirled egg whites in a pretty design) they tasted great. It was simple and the bourbon and amaretto (both are things I love, but never paired together) mixed well together. It was a light cocktail but packed a real flavor punch. The bartender was quick to offer us another when we were almost empty, and made the drinks quickly. It wasn't the cheapest place ever, but also wasn't terribly expensive, with my cocktail clocking in at $11. The decor is simple but classy. The navy blue bar is cool, and the rustic modern wood and metal bar stools are very comfy. Worth mentioning are the giant hooks under the bar, big enough to hold your bag and your coat, which I really enjoyed. The white tin ceiling makes for an airy but vintage vibe, and I just can't ever get enough of chevron wood floors. I want to come back and try the food, have another Amaretto Sour and relax within their casual-cool walls.",4,1,1
184,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,4.0,10/27/2014,"Finally made it to this place after hearing about it from multiple people and seeing some pretty intriguing photos online.It has a low key look on the inside and a nice seating area on the outside that is great for people watching. It also has a slight trendy feel, but it's the furthest thing from pretentious. I got my usual rum cocktail as well as an order of fries. They didn't have a great selections of rum, which was disappointing, but they did make a pretty good drink with what they had. The fries were delicious as well.I would definitely come back here for the vibe. It can be a chill spot, a date spot or a good place to grab a meal and hangout. In the warmer months, it's the perfect place to sit outside and do a little bit of everything. Either way, definitely a winner and a place I'll be back to.",1,,2

186,Nikkie Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",239,13,17,5.0,9/10/2015,"Someone else called this place a unicorn and I have to second that.Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I was in a panic trying to find a perfect place for my boyfriend's 30th bday. He's the kind of guy who likes good friends, good food, good drinks and NOT feeling like a sardine while not being able to hear your friends because you went to a place that's too trendy and pretentious. Plus, some of our friends are not very punctual, so it had to be a place where we could eat, drink and spend several hours. After hopelessly scouring Yelp reviews for 'the one,' I came across The Winslow. When I saw that unicorn comment from another reviewer, I immediately knew I had to go to a place that's reviewed by someone who would use that reference. And I was not disappointed. Highlights:PERSONAL ATTENTION: From the moment I called The WInslow to plan, Aidan and Kieran were super professional and attentive. They helped me choose the best nook where my friends could hide for the surprise. I mean, they sent me a photo of the nook!SERVICE: Our server was FANTASTIC. Ridiculously good memory, polite and pleasant in every way. FOOD: Everything from the party menu and the regular menu was great. Food came out on time and none was left over. My boyfriend is lactose intolerant, so their chef was even willing to make some dishes lactose free! I appreciated that so much.DRINKS: I'm not a big drinker, but damn, everything I had was awesome. Don't remember any drink names though.SPACE TO CHILL: There was another bday party already planned in the back room, so we got a great little nook that was just right for ~15 people to mill about. Some could stand and some could sit. It worked well and allowed us all to move freely. My friends and I had plenty of space to hang out without being in each others' faces and the music in the background was just loud enough to make it fun but not overpowering. The vibe was not dancey that night, but we were there early (7:30pm - 12:30am) on Friday before Labor Day.So bottom line is, if you want to have a party or host a surprise for someone else, this is a great place to do it. Or just come in for a drink and food. Turkey Chili, I love you. The Winslow, thanks for a great time!",2,2,

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by the bartender, even though I wasn't at the bar yet (it's always nice to be acknowledged). When I got to the bar I told her I was meeting some friends and they weren't here yet so I wanted to order a drink even though we would eventually be taking a table, she said that would be absolutely fine and asked if I'd been here before, I had twice but as we got to talking I asked if there was anything different to drink she could recommend and she gave me a few options while asking questions as to what I like/don't like. I went for the ""damn dirty ape"" strange name, delicious beverage! When my friends arrived we took a table to talk properly, our server seated us promptly and was very friendly. As most people do, when we got together we spent the first 15 minutes talking and completely forgot to check the menus but our waiter was very patient. When we did get around to filling our bellies with food, we went for a selection of shareable plates. The cheese board, some pickled veg (to be healthy) and the crumpets. Yum. E. I can honestly say I liked everything a lot but the curried cauliflower and lamb crumpets were by far my fav! I had a few more of those cocktails, that were very consistent, a problem I've encountered in other bars before. After 4 I decided to get hydrated as I didn't want to get too tipsy. We sat for quite some time and our waiter never forgot us even though we slowed with the ordering. I'm sorry I didn't get the names of the staff so I could give them the recognition they deserve, and for not writing a review before, but I had a great time at the Winslow and will definitely be back, maybe for some very appealing brunch!

The brunch entrees here are on the slightly pricier side ($16 for Eggs Benedict), but for only $12 you can add bottomless mimosas to any brunch entree. Find me another boozy brunch under $30 with actual good food and I will raise you the Winslow!The restaurant has a great ambiance--exposed brick, nice wooden tables. If you are looking for a rowdy and loud boozy brunch this is definitely not the place; however, if you are looking for a quieter spot with good food and drinks to enjoy with your friends this place comes highly recommended.I didn't have any coffee, but was told it was fantastic. Apparently they get it from Vermont and it comes fresh every two weeks.Brunch entrees that people enjoyed included: the mushroom omelete, the duck confit hash, the burger and the eggs benedict.",5,,1

That being said, i've been here for happy hour and a party. +10 points for being able to rent/reserve the back space that's pretty secluded for a party. The servers were quick and super helpful (versus being irritated with a bubbly party). Happy hour was also great. They make their own tonics according to the type of gin you're drinking. (Here's where I should mention they're pretty much a gin bar). They have a full bar, but they definitely know their gin.",,,
194,Ben W.,"New York, NY",514,772,435,4.0,4/5/2014,"A whole menu of gin and tonics?? Definitely coming back.Came here for a birthday party the other weekend. I had never heard of The Winslow and when I saw the intersection, I didn't really know what to expect because that stretch of 14th has some fun bars but no birthday material in my opinion. Now I know The Winslow can also be a bday spot haha.Atmosphere: very much like a nicer bar, there are tables in the back and a slightly cleared area to dance. There's also a semi-private room in the back I think another group had booked out. On Saturday nights, they have a DJ spinning beats in the back. Not the best dance floor, but in combination with the drink menu, it's a unique pairing.Drinks: like I mentioned above, a whole menu for gin and tonic? Done and done. Each option uses a different gin and they add 2-3 fresh ingredients that supposedly bring out the subtle undertones of each variety. It does seem a little steep ($10-12 per drink), but it was a great refreshing way to enjoy a classic. The rosemary and juniper berries in my drink (forgot the name) made for great sipping.Crowd: there was our party, a group of Wisconsin fans, and smaller gatherings around the bar. Everyone seemed to be having a good time, dancing together and enjoying overall good conversation.Too many bars in the city to frequent one on a regular basis, but The Winslow gets a thumbs up and I know where to go if I'm ever craving gin basics.",2,1,2
195,Ashley H.,"New York, NY",8,16,1,3.0,5/8/2017,"Came here this past weekend for the boozy brunch. Our group of 8 was seated promptly and the restaurant was pretty empty around 1:30pm on a Saturday. The food was average but the serving size of everything was pretty small for the price, the only meal that was a decent size was the fish and chips. The mimosas were average tasting, and the staff actively refilled most of the time. However, the mimosas could have been chilled or served with ice because they were tough to drink at room temperature.",1,1,
196,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",232,801,242,2.0,6/21/2014,"Came here for drinks and dessert last night. Beers and cocktails are reasonably priced ($7-12), and I was happy with my selection of libations. However, the place is LOUD at 9pm, so loud I had to shout to talk to my friends. The waiter was also CLEARLY annoyed that we didn't order food aside from dessert -- the place wasn't full when we came or left, so the attitude really rubbed me the wrong way. Also, when my dessert arrived the ice cream was completely melted and was practically inedible. Definitely more of a frat party scene rather than an enjoy drinks with your friends scene. I doubt I'll be back.",2,,

198,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,4.0,5/7/2014,"When I first walked into the Winslow, I thought I would hate it - it was really loud and packed and felt like any other divey east side bar. I was prepared to fight through the crowds and endure poorly made drinks. But this was not the case at all!Drinks - their specialty is gin & tonics. They have an extensive menu of gin & tonic & garnish & herbs pairings that was pretty impressive. At $10 a pop, you should just try them all. Bar - insanely well-managed. Even though the bar looked crowded, it was never a struggle to get the bartenders' attention. They work fast and they do great work. Atmosphere - simple and fun. Good music for dancing, but plenty of places to sit and chill too.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised and this will definitely become my east side go to.",2,1,
199,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,10/29/2013,"Came here recently for a friend's birthday. After experiencing Hype Lounge and Bishops & Barons, I think the Winslow has done a good job of learning from the mistakes of the space's past inhabitants. Hype Lounge was a little confused between being a sports bar and an urban dance floor, whereas Bishops & Barons just could not execute anything correctly, including the food, drink, AND customer service. Not sure if it's new ownership or just a new concept, but the Winslow had a comfortable feel to it. It was a bit more empty than I had imagined, but I'll chalk that up to being relatively new on the block.The ambiance is the right mix of bar and restaurant, where people can still have a casual, relaxed meal, and the bar area can still be lively and fun. Given that it's a large space, people can comfortably talk and the music, while fairly upbeat, isn't overpowering. Deals aren't amazing for happy hour, but I'm sure I'll find myself wandering around there after work one of these days.Anyways, for my friend's birthday, the staff brought out a sparkler with some free strawberry shortcake, which was a nice touch. My friend whose birthday it was had had a few too much to drink, so she tried to blow out the sparkler, to no avail. Luckily, no one was hurt or burned, but it was amusing to see the waiter (and everyone else) laugh hysterically. Good to see everyone have a fun time.I'll definitely have to come back for the food, as the burgers and the 3 little pigs appetizer looked pretty darn good. Seems like the cocktails also have a generally favorable review here, so I'll have to give those a try as well. Given the prime location, I can definitely see the Winslow becoming one of my go-to bars for a low-key night in East Village.",8,8,4
