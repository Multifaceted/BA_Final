0,Courtney D.,"Holbrook, NY",69,52,105,4.0,6/23/2018,"This place was so fun! Its a swanky up scale bowling ally and it's definitely not a bowling ally you find on long island. Came here for a team building work outing. We got 2 hours of bowling (went waaayy too quick) and an hour of ping pong with open bar with most liquors. We ordered a bunch of finger foods like flat bread pizza, sliders, wings, and fruit. In the ping pong room we had 3 or 4 different tables with the opportunity to play larger versions of games like connect 4 or jenga. I'm sure this place was a little on the expensive side, but we all had a good time!",1,,

Updated review","Let me start With the drama, because who doesn't want to know that first!? We left our friends to get another round of drinks... normal right. We get back and our friend is pleading with the ""hostess"" behind the table... Now when we get there they're both arguing. Ok. Not ok. But he goes ""THE LIGHTS ARE F***ING OFF""... we look over to the area where the ping pong tables are, and the other table of People we DON'T know have their phone flashlight on. She proceeds to argue with him saying he was rude for asking to be told prior to turning off the lights... mgr looked over and in short was not happy with his employee. Not cool. You're in the ""hospitality industry"" so get with the program unless you've never had any formal training which was apparent.  She kept her attitude after they turned back on the light claiming SHE didn't know, and saying he was the one with the attitude. THE table that was still there started clapping.  Can't deal. Meanwhile the 6ft plus security was already behind us.  That's NOT how you treat people when your own employee is incompetent and oblivious to her surroundings.  Your job is to have compassion and to rectify a situation that your establishment created. We got nothing. Plus sides, large scale and half empty. In all sections. Lounge booths open, ping pong, bowling, and random large scale jenga and connect four. Be aware they apply 18% before tax to ALL bills.  So good service is far and few between. Come here if this is your only option, and if you want poor attitudes. Extremely intoxicated we were not, and one person in the group was the only person by the ping pong tables that went to the hostess to alert her the lights were off which she still didn't believe. We walked over from the bar to encounter your hostess being rude. It was a simple look over to the left to see the lights OFF which she didn't.  The person working with her was in complete disbelief, and apologized.  Your staff was completely oblivious to what was going on at her post that her first response was to be defensive. Great customer service.",4,,
2,Mandy T.,"Boston, MA",112,11,6,1.0,7/27/2018,"The service here is very condescending. There's only one person in the reception desk which means we had to wait for the person to finish a task before serving us.  We came here twice and the first time we weren't sure what was going on but the reception lady never guided us or helped. There's no pricing on the website which is didn't serve much convenience for us. If I visit a website, I want to know the exact pricing for each person/game. The place is located in TIMES SQUARE so things do get expensive. I was offered the $60/hr which is a bit expensive especially when theres trouble on the lane and also time flies by really quickly! It was around $76 for the both of us together including shoes and the hour. I could've bought a single game and shoe rentals at  other bowling alleys for a third of the price if we knew we'd only have time for 1 game. I didn't like my experiences both times at this place even though I gave it a second try.",1,,
3,Martha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,47,63,4.0,11/11/2018,"This place is very fun! It feels unnecessarily swanky, but very nice. Eight of us came here and did the bowling package that includes food. We added on a beer tower when we got there - and it was a tower. The bowling was good although the lanes are very close together and it was a little annoying to have another group of people so close to you. Having a self-serve bowling shoe station is very nice. The food was very good and portions were great - it made spending so much money almost feel worth it. They played great music that was pretty quiet at first and then as of 7:30 3x as loud and no longer synced with the videos playing above the lanes. I would  come here again for a party or to meet up with friends, but I have also been to better bowling alleys for the price.",,,
4,Cuiyu W.,"New York, NY",126,61,378,3.0,3/23/2018,"Really a 3.5 and i would normally round up but this just couldn't reach that full 4. Maybe next time. Super easy to get the shoe rentals and the lanes set up. The music was on point, the vibe was fun! There were ping pong and pool tables. After bowling, we were seated at a lounge area behind bowling, which was nice. The bowling experience is an easy 5. Location is really convenient, it's connected to the train station and Sky Lounge. The food was ok, i guess it's pretty decent for a bowling place. 3-4The bathroom is disgusting. The servers were good at first then dismissive the rest of the time. Service was slow and horrible. We tried to get the attention of another server to ask if he could tell us where our server was or if he could ask her to stop by... (since ya know she hadn't checked up on us in over 30 min) and he tried to ignore us and walk away!! It wasn't even that busy when we were there. We gave them good business and everyone in the party was courteous and easy to deal with. 2I would go back if i was conveniently in the area and had a lot of time with a group of people.",6,,
5,Shola A.,"Oakland, CA",212,51,150,5.0,1/25/2018,"Hidden inside of Port Authority is Frames Bowling lounge. This is the 3rd year my team has had our annual team building event. We have a blast every year! The drinks are always on point and the bartenders are so friendly and gracious with their pours. Each year we get one of the catering packages that include open bar and food. My favorites are the shrimp, pigs in a blanket which are served with a delicious dipping sauce. The servers are great and always check in on you to fill up your cup. This is such a great activity to do with your team it allows you to have fun and have some great drinks. The vibe inside is very grown, dim lighting and top 20 music videos in the background. If your looking for a fun thing to do with friends would definitely recommend you check out Frames! There is also pool tables and ping pong tables. Next time your in the area give it a visit...especially if you miss your bus a great thing to do to kill time!",5,,

Everytime I called there was a short wait time if any and they were very responsive & helpful. The location is great and VERY close to the train station. There is also a lot more to do here than bowling...ping-pong, karaoke, great drinks/great food. One of the more budget friendly places in Manhattan. Did I also mention that the music was great??

7,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",358,104,116,4.0,6/1/2018,"This place is a great place to host a birthday party. I recently planned a birthday for me and around 13 other people and Laura Kaczkowski was a great event planner. She made the process very easy, straightforward, with timely response which is just what I needed given my job hours. They take the payment in advance, they have great prices/food options, and they play fun music! The only one thing i'd say is there was some technical issues with our lanes as we inputted all of our names, but the computer didn't save it down. I had to write all of our names down and give it to the reception. That was slightly annoying. But they have great drinks here and really good sangria. This is the place to host a party for a large group of people for a good price and great atmosphere.",1,,1
8,Michelle S.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,11/15/2018,"Hands down, the worst lanes in the city.   The computers never work correctly. Lanes are bone dry.  League night should only be 2 hours...tops. Because of continuous issues with the lanes...over 3 hours. It sucks.",,,
9,Anna L.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",39,208,261,4.0,8/13/2018,"Frames is conveniently located in Port Authority but the atmosphere was hip and fun. I came on a Saturday night and the place was very busy. You can reserve lanes online. They have a great unlimited bowling deal on Saturday after 11pm and on Sunday after 7pm for $25 per person for up to 3 hours. Obtaining the shoes is easy and quick as it is self-service. After 8pm it is 21+ only, so bring your id. The cons were that the food was mediocre and pricey (not surprising), no food or drinks are allowed inside even water but water is provided, the music is loud so it's hard to hear each other, and the game sometimes glitches. You have to ask the front desk to manually reset the pins after someone bowls their bonus during the final frame.",,,1
10,Matthew D.,"Wyckoff, NJ",0,6,0,1.0,11/12/2018,Came in for a draught beer while waiting for the late night bus. Tasted awful. Beer was fouled from the lines or somewhere along the process. Two sips and left. Environment seemed cool for bowling but would never order a draught beer ever again.,,,

12,Jay K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,17,39,4.0,6/4/2018,"This bowling lounge was filled with catchy decor and good vibes. It can be a bit expensive but it's NYC after all so you can't get mad. It's worth the money, but I would recommend getting the pay per game deal instead of the $75 for an hour for 2 people. Because time goes by real fast!... The second part was the pool table which is $29 an hour, they have nice tables and clean as well. The seating areas for all sections of the location was comfortable. Great for taking photos.Overall, this place is great and it's fun as well, it's right in times sq so after a quick game or two there's a lot more to do around.",,,
13,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,3.0,2/2/2018,"Solid venue for group bowling events with a good range of good food options, including gluten-free items, and spacious lanes.  The food quality is on par with what you would get at a mainstream or chain bar & grill.  The favorite was definitely the beef sliders with arugula and cheddar on mini potato rolls, although the Yuengling-battered coconut shrimp was solid as well.  The chicken taquitos are a decent option if you are looking for a cheesy option with a crunch; the shell is more spring roll-like but the filling of chicken, cheddar and avocado is flavorful.  Skip the chicken sate: the tenders are glazed vs marinated and on the dry side.There are a good number of company team-building events held here, as well as kid's and holiday parties, during the day.  It gets busier after 5 pm.  The staff are friendly and helpful.Overall a good venue for a group outing or for bowling by PABT.",1,1,1

The place is really clean, modern & trendy; with a nice bar/lounge area in the front and newly updated bowling lanes in the back. The bowling was fun! The food & drink however..... not so fun. The beer was pretty flat. The pizza or flatbread or whatever it was, tasted worse than frozen Ellio's. They served weird tasting fried shrimp..... why would anyone ever order fried shrimp while bowling is beyond me? The mini-sliders & chicken tenders were pretty decent though, but then again, it is kind of hard to mess those up. All in all it was a nice event, but in all honestly I probably will not return. Also a tip, there is a direct entrance to Frames on 9th Avenue, or else there is an entrance through Port Authority which is pretty hard to find.",3,1,2

This is one of my favorite hangout place in the city, especially if you are big group. You have multiple lanes but do book in advance as they fill fast. The food menu is pretty huge and they have a lot to offer. Even though the place gives you a pub feel, their cocktails are surprisingly good. The service can be bit slow sometimes depending on how crowded it is. This place is pretty good even for office parties or even regular occasions you would go celebrate with friends and family.

19,D B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,3,2.0,5/28/2018,"I've been bowling here for a very long time and have let history with this alley override its negatives. But when I got my $16.49 (forced gratuity included) sliders that were this minuscule, I decided that loyalty should be earned. Photo attached of the sliders.In addition to this, the lanes are consistently plagued by errors and bugs. A number of lanes have a bug where if you get a spare, they don't record it as a spare.  There is one or 2 lanes that literally resets after your first role and there have been a few strikes thrown only to have the system randomly reset. Almost all of the lines are warped so you have to figure out how your lane is warped when you start bowling. It became obvious over time that the owners or managers are SUPER cheap. Over 3 years they have never done a single improvement except creating a new space to make more money, a karaoke section. They could care less about their primary format as a business which is bowling. They consistently do NOT sufficiently air condition the lanes, and during league play, everyone universally comments that it's hot as a sauna. Multiple people I know have complained about it. They just don't care.The fact is, most lanes in Manhattan are pretty garbage-y except maybe Lucky Strikes. Frames at least has decent length to their lanes. But it seems they need to push their regulars to post a negative review to actually start caring about this place I come to so often.",1,,
20,Adarsh S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,9/23/2018,"I celebrated my birthday last night at Frames - I had booked the VIP lounge with the weekend remix package (2 drink tickets per person for beer/wine/sangria/soda + a party sized platter for all) for about 10 people and I had a blast! I'd never been to a place with a 'bowling lounge' and the room was pretty bonkers in a good way.It was a massive long room with its own 2 lanes, a bunch of tvs and a big screen above the pins with music videos playing. On the other end, there were some lovely couches and cool cushions (one of the cushions had these sequins you could brush your hand over and flip them from gold to black and vice versa.. like you were painting on the cushion that was cool and a nice touch haha). We got some food and drinks (their sangria was pretty nice and their mac and cheese bites were amazing).I had coordinated this with Laura - kept in touch via emails and phone calls the week before and I ended up finalizing the booking just the day before due to waiting on rsvp counts. The whole process was super smooth, the people at the front desk were professional and courteous and so was our server for the lounge.Thank you for the great birthday experience!

First, the alarm never went off and there was one women screaming for everyone to evacuate. Second they didn't even turn the lights on so people couldn't see where they were going. Third the music was left on so you couldn't hear anything. It left everyone running with no direction. The one good thing was the NYPD, within two minutes there were several officers with fire extinguishers running into the building to handle the situation.Our group was invited back to make up for the unfortunate event and they delivered on their promise. We were given 2 hours of free bowling for 14 people and free 2 beer towers to go along with it. The staff was also very accomidating with everything we asked for. It turned out to be a great night and it was very professional of Frames to have us back on them. It was unfortunate the first night happened however on any other night I would say it would be a great place to a change of pace with a group of friends.",2,4,

While I understand that we could not reenter to retrieve our belongings (including credit cards at the bar), it was totally unacceptable that no fire alarms went off AT ALL.

He wasn't rude, but wouldn't let me explain or go upstairs. I called event coordinator, Laura Kaczkowski, who had help me plan the night and she spoke to him. Laura gets 12 stars for answering every annoying question I had with class and giving great suggestions. We ended up bowling for an hour, but we had so much fun we didn't care. The music was so good. They played  Reggae, hiphop, pop. One of the most fun I've ever had.I plan to go again and again. The music was everything!  Let's take a moment to appreciate good lighting.

She also checked in after our event as well, to ensure everything went as planned.The bowling alley is extremely spacious and great for groups of all sizes.  After we were finished bowling our lane/bartender reserved some tables in the back for us to hang out at.  Service was great, food was delicious and bowling was fun.  All in all a great time!",,,

Things to note: 1) reservation is highly recommended or else you will have to wait, especially on the weekends. 2) Also, cost differs based on time of day, so the website is the best way to see cost difference for diff times. 3) these costs per lane already includes shoe rental 4) if you made a reservation for say, 8-10pm, your clock starts ticking at 8pm whether your party arrives on time or notAside from this we all had a great time!

The level of customer service from the front desk to our servers were great. They even replenished our food and drinks without asking.

They are uncharacteristically attentive and accommodating, always trying to make it work for you.

The bowling shoes are displayed really nicely in a nightclub-like setting shelf; I recommend going down half a size for women shoes because my actual size fit pretty big. The drinks are good. Didn't have much food, just tried the guacamole which was ok; a little bland. The menu did look good though and seemed to have a lot to offer, but my friend and I just wanted something to much on.

32,Cici L.,"Manhattan, NY",8,41,10,2.0,6/20/2018,"Bowler beware of their packages! Came with a large group of friends and bought the Sports package. We spent over $600, and they only brought out one ""large"" platter of sliders, fries, and wings.  When I spoke with management, I was told that each person was meant to have 1.5 burgers to eat (mind you we spent over $45 pp on bowling and food).  Apparently how the packages work is they have a small platter and a large platter. The small platter is for one lane and the large platter is for two  lanes. Therefore regardless of whether you have four people in your one lane or seven people (which is the max), you're paying substantially more but getting the same amount of food.  Their package clearly stated how many beer towers were included but not how many platters.  If there is a clear expectation of one item but not the others, it should not be assumed that more people would receive the same total portion of food.They eventually provided us with another small platter of sliders, fries and wings, with additional commentary from the staff stating we better be happy with this.  Note to the staff - no I'm still hungry and not happy. If you are going to charge me per person, I expect the same amount of food that I paid for. I don't expect it to be a better value of food for 4 people vs. 7.Note to everyone else- to ensure you don't get cheated, do a max of 4 people per lane (which may require separate transactions). Slightly more effort but clearly a much better value.",2,,

Updated review","When my company announced that we would be having our holiday party at Frames Bowling Lounge, I had my doubts.  How nice could a place in Port Authority really be?  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised!!  The space was huge, with about 30 lanes, 2 massive bars, and a spacious game room.  Our team had reserved several lanes and was able to motivate the crowd enough to fill most of them.  The lanes were well-marked, and popular music videos were playing on screens positioned just over the pins.  They had a large selection of variously weighted balls, as well.  Our open bar consisted of well drinks, non-craft beers, and wine.  However, we were also able to get pitchers of some of their more popular cocktails, such as the sangria and Moscow Mules, to supplement the unlimited offerings.  Meanwhile, their well beverages used pretty decent liquor brands, such as Three Olives as the house vodka.  Lastly, they offered yards of beer, which was a great compliment to the engaging atmosphere.We had also ordered several platters of bar-style appetizers.  The  Cheese Quesadillas were stuffed with a trio of manchego, brie, and gouda cheeses, as well as corn and beans.  They were drizzled with a sweet, barbecue-like sauce and were served with pico de gallo and guacamole.   The guacamole dip platter was accompanied by pink and yellow corn tortilla chips.  While the chips were crisp and deliciously salty, the guacamole was watery and bland.  In fact, the guac was like a smooth, green puree with no visible onions, tomatoes, or other enhancements.  The Butternut Squash Hummus had a very bizarre flavor that was more similar to roasted red pepper than squash.  The dip was served with a mixed raw and roasted vegetable crudité and toasted naan.  The French Fries were well-seasoned, but tasted pre-frozen on the inside.  We also ordered the Margherita Pizza, though I did not sample that one, as it did not look very impressive.  It resembled a large pita covered with cheese and some tomato chunks.  Looking at the menu, I felt like we could have ordered much more interesting and tasty dishes, such as the BBQ Brisket Sliders or Mac & Cheese Bites, as our choices left us unsatisfied.  After our bowling adventure, we scattered about to play billiards in the main room or ping pong, giant Connect Four, and more in the separate game lounge.  There was something to appeal to everyone.Frames offered a light-hearted and comprehensive venue for our corporate event.  Plus, the staff was informative and helpful.  It really provided an entertaining evening!",3,,3

She answered all my questions via email, wrote up a quote, gave me a direct link for payment, and always emailed me my receipt once I paid. THE VENUE,VIP ROOM & LANE SERVICE:I got upstairs around 7PM and went right up to the front desk and was immediately shown to my room. Huge and spacious, super pretty, and it was perfect for my party of 10. It was nice being able to walk around without having to worry about our belongings or bumping into people in other lanes. I definitely suggest getting a VIP room if you have a big party. You can choose your own music and change lights for the lanes in the room. The service was amazing, I forgot the name of the person who took care of us but he was amazing. He would check on us often, refilling our food and taking drink orders. When it was time to go to the ping pong area his team move all of our drinks and food to the area.EXPERIENCE OVERALL:Definitely enjoyed the experience. The service was amazing, the room was nice and clean, the ping pong area was social media friendly, and not overly packed. My friend kind of remembers his birthday so I'd say it was a success.",,,
36,Ashley W.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,6,2,5.0,3/26/2018,This place is super chic!! The Saturday night dj is dope! The bartenders aren't that attentive due to the crowds and low staffing in the bowling area. The food is amazing and sangria to die for!!,,,
37,Laurence W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/14/2018,"Awesome place to just relax and have fun with friends. The bowling lanes and equipment are state-of-the-art. The cocktails are amazing & it has an excellent selection of draft beers too.Enjoy a live dj and large screens in each lane - above the bowling pins - showing the best music videos from the MTV era and beyond.Frames is like an elegant night club - only better, because you can bowl too.",,,

Also, all the employees I encountered were really nice and accommodating. I ended up choosing the Night Owl package which gives you two hours of bowling, plus shoes, and either a beer tower or cocktail pitcher for $34.95 a person. It was a great deal and we ended up ordering food separately since some of my friends were vegetarians. Their food is also really bomb and I'm still dreaming about their chicken taquitos! lol I would definitely check this place out if you're thinking of something fun to do for your bday or even a work event!",,,
39,Rasleen S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",74,10,13,5.0,3/15/2018,"I had my birthday here on a Wednesday night. I purchased a package in advance by calling and Lauren was excellent. She was helpful with all my concerns and answered all my questions. The day of the event, my party was upgraded to the VIP room. This was my first time at Frames and I was just amazed how nice this place is. Our server for the night was amazing. My party of 10 ended up being a party of 18 and he handled this bigger crowd excellently. The food and pitchers were favored by everyone. The best part was at 9pm no one rushed us out of the VIP area. Everyone had a great time and I would definitely recommend Frames for events.",,,

Unfortunately, my family and friends were running very late and we would have missed our reservation but the staff worked with me to change it and accommodate them and make my birthday a great birthday.

41,Care A.,"Queens, NY",270,19,57,4.0,12/7/2017,"Last weekend, I selected Frames to host my half-birthday (exactly as you read it haha) celebration with around 30-35 of my friends and we all had an amazing time! Though 21 of us pre-paid and bowled, everyone indulged in the delicious bites (many raved about the pulled pork sandwich but I didn't get a chance to try it personally) and strong drinks. The music was also surprisingly really good! I had expected the classic 80's and 00's go-to's, but the DJ had a great handle on contemporary hits and kept energy high. Totally perfect for a Saturday night, so kudos to whomever they were! We had also expected the classic bowling seating on both sides of the lanes, but had two small tables with 4 chairs that filled the space, so it was difficult to navigate with the number of guests in my party. No other lanes were like that, so were pretty confused. After our 2-hr session ended, we were also super promptly cleared out from our lanes. Like 'staff bringing our coats to us' clearing out, which irked many of my guests, but we were a big group and they had to set-up for another party. It still might've been helpful to have a 5-minute in-person time warning.But in all, Frames provides a great group experience for a great value. The location is central, so everyone could reach it by public transit, which was huge. Booking was also easy with both Laura and Meghan. Since I have been there with a few friends and now a large group, I can say that I would definitely recommend to others (local or tourists)! Obviously I'll be back as well :)",1,,

Our party of 6 had an awesome time.We took advantage of the summer splash promotion, which is great value for the money.  We ordered beef sliders and cheese quesadilla, both items were delicious. Each of us got 2 glasses of wine/beer. I also tried Frose which is a frozen rose wine cocktail with splash of citrus, very refreshing. We bowled for 2 hours. We also discovered that they have a nice lounge, will definitely check it out another time at night. Great place for everyone, will definitely come back.",,,
46,John M.,"New York, NY",341,9,9,1.0,11/27/2017,I made the mistake of purchasing a gilt coupon for seven guests.  I have tried for 2 years to redeem it for seven guests.  The first time made sense a Saturday evening in late February might be tight.  I tried again for a Saturday morning 12/9 at 12:30 and received a note in ALL CAPS from  Frayda telling me no exceptions in December. This marketing ploy was a plan to grab cash with multiple black out dates that was never cool.   What bummer to meet such nasty business owners in New York City.  #giltgroup,1,,

Updated review","I have had two events for our school staff at Frames. From booking, and accommodating a few staff members with a special arrangement, to the service, food, and experience, Frames was great.  I strongly recommend Frames for a big group team builder for any organization as a lot of our staff members had a great time with each other!",1,,
48,Paige M.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",139,23,4,2.0,5/28/2018,"50% off Monday walkins wasn't honored because of Memorial Day even though it was fairly empty. $90 for a lane for 1 hr whatever I payed. I was starving and was told I would have a server at my lane I had to flag someone down to get serviced. Ordered Mac and cheese bites chicken tenders and margarita pizza as well as a red sangria, my server spilled some wine on my Mac and cheese bites either in the kitchen or bar and had the nerve to serve me stained red Mac and cheese bites. I didn't complain just went with the flow and made note not to return it's not really worth it.",,,1

51,Melinda F.,"Manhattan, NY",192,16,18,5.0,6/2/2018,"I booked a 2 hour slot last Saturday evening for 7 people for my bf's birthday (recommend calling versus booking on the website since it was a bit glitchy). We got the black tie open bar package, diamond tier (top shelf liquor). The booking process was pretty straight forward and convenient: I had to book for 8 minimum (4 min per lane) and pay that upfront but if anyone else joined up to a max of 14 people for two lanes, we could add them anytime later and they could pay at the door.The venue is spacious and modern, and because it is a ""lounge"" there are comfy sofa chairs in the sitting areas of the lanes. We were very impressed with the service. The attendant at our lane was extremely attentive, cleaning cups and getting our drink orders so that we could  maximize open bar. The drinks are also pretty strong and the bartenders were very accommodating. I'm going to tip them more next time. It was easy to set up with the self service shoes and balls, and you'll notice that the number of gutter balls goes up with the number of drinks you've had haha. We didn't feel rushed to leave as our two hours ended and I appreciate that we were able to finish our remaining drinks at a back table after our lane time was up. I plan to be back later this summer and possibly for my own birthday!",,,

55,Mike A.,"Rego Park, NY",22,12,0,4.0,11/1/2017,"Had a great time this past Sat (10/28) at Frames Bowling.Easy online reserve for an hour. They're very strict with the times for the bowling so come early to get your shoes and settle in (important...and also bring ID for your reservation and if you want to use the pool table).Nice and clean, fun style for the bowling shoe cubbies, the lounge couches, etc. and love the layout of the seating for bowling and the tables/set up area for food and drinks (very convenient). Bowling lanes look good. Bowling balls a little beat up (some gashes in them) but overall you can find a good selection. Shoes a little worn on soles, but still clean looking.Food was good too. Had a Humus platter w/vegetables appetizer-tasty but a little dry with the humus. Need more peta-bread (which was nice and warm though). Steak empanadas were good and very tasty but the steak too ground up. Needed to have larger, flakier pieces of beef. Salsa for empanadas dry. Mac-n-cheese bites very good. Food overall not too expensive. Reasonable.Had a good Stella Artois beer on tap. Very good and fresh.The bartender was excellent. He was pleasant and polite and did a nice chocolate brownie/ice-cream desert in a giant martini glass for my wife for her birthday. I thought it'd be just a cake with candle but it was a nice surprise and I thank him very much.They have over 24 lanes, plus a couple of private rooms with lanes as well. A game/ping-pong, giant jenga, connect four game room area, another larger area with bar and 2 pool tables near entrance looks nice and a karaoke lounge bar area too. All stylish and clean. I hear they have a live DJ for Fri and Sat nights. No kids after 8pm as well.We played pool on the single pool table in the bowling alley area. Old style leather pockets. Table a little worn, but not bad. Felt was bad and dirty though. Sticks straight and not beat up. Pool table across from a nice large lounge couch area (which are strategically placed throughout the floor). Good to hang out, have drinks and shoot pool. Although on the right of the table not in the way of the lounge or the table too much but a vent unit seemed too close if you're making a shot at a certain angle. Not bad but should move it back a foot or so.Had a great time with the family. Would definitely come back. Certain days have great deals on lanes and food, etc.",1,,
56,Dove C.,"New York, NY",906,80,18,2.0,3/18/2018,"UPDATE: The reply from Frames below does not acknowledge their behavior. Smugness will not suffice to change a series of experiences (or make up for the several dozen comments that are similar to mine in the not recommended section). Review stands until this establishment can start treating people better. Now on to the original review... The good things about Frames: it's absolutely gorgeous and the upgrades they've made to the place over the years continue to make it more alluring. Food and drinks are good. The bad thing about Frames: The attitude of management here continues to be an issue, and the main reason I took my business elsewhere years back. Not that they're missing it I suppose, because corporations are always spending money here, but I would think that every dollar counts towards something when you're running a business. If I'm planning on spending a few thousand dollars on an event, then I would expect to be treated decently and respectfully. Ever since their good event planner left a few years back, things have just gotten very unpleasant. And it's sad... I was really hoping for the best so I could work with them again, but no dice. You might wonder what I'm speaking of specifically, so here goes: two different times recently I have walked into the venue and looked in the various rooms to see the upgrades... no one stopped me or bothered me. I brought back a female friend one time recently to look at the rooms, and again no one stopped us and asked us what we were doing or told us we needed to have an escort. But when I brought back male clients (who actually have a budget to do an event here), we were cornered by a stern-faced manager, and told very abruptly that we needed to leave the Karaoke room because no one is allowed, even though the door was wide open. Mind you we were just looking at the space (for about 60 seconds flat) not touching anything or sitting/lounging at all. My client also actually happens to be African-American, so I'm sure you can imagine my face since I had been in those same rooms before and no one questioned me. But to my statement above, this is not the first time that I've been treated rudely with non-white clients. I hope they can fix that because after all these years and all of the reviews on yelp from people claiming that they've been treated differently because of their race (see the review section for reviews that are NOT featured), it's not pretty.",2,,

Updated review","Had to wait to submit this review because the internet signal did not make it to the the bathroom.  Don't expect to watch your favorite sports team here.  And if you pay $300 for two lanes and two games per lane, which we did for two games, they will still shut your game down the moment your time runs out.    Don't waste your time here, employees are unhappy and there's a terrible vibe",,,
58,D3jm D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,2/24/2018,"NEVER organize a kids party in this place. I had the worst experience organizing one here today. Reasons:1. Badly organized in terms of not having a helper on the floor to assist the kids, provide them with lighter balls or even a ramp to roll the ball2. There is no space for kids to sit and eat or even cut a cake. They initially promise you with more space and then give you a shitty corner3. Poorly staffed. One server for a group of 26!!! And the servers are rude and not intuitive. For example he didn't bring juice for the kids until the end of the party because we didn't mention what flavor ($%^!) and he kept blaming us for his inefficiencyThey just want your money and are HORRIBLE IN TERMS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Location is super convenient, trains buses and cabs all night long. Our waiter was adorable and attentive. Would've tipped him extra but I work in non-profit -$. The bad, but not really:Karaoke is for reservations for 20+ ppl. Big fail. It's the weekend and the spot is nice where no one leaves immediately after bowling. They should open it up and just allow ppl to pay for individual entrance at least. It would be packed. The day of my party karaoke lounge was empty all night. What a shame, it looked nice. The dance lounge was closed. Seriously stupid, it's Saturday, ppl want to drink and dance. I was disappointed that's not mentioned on their website, kind of a big reason why I came here instead of bowlmor/Chelsea piers. Follow dress code, no joggers or sweats or anything gym looking or flip flops like i saw a lady wearing (tragic) they really might not let you in. Sneakers are cool.

81,Angela P.,"New Hyde Park, NY",8,10,0,4.0,3/14/2018,"I booked a package for a corporate event at Frames Bowling Lounge. The package was about $60 per person and included 2 hours of bowling, shoe rentals, 4 party platters of food, and 2 beer towers - and it was definitely money well spent! The food was great - we got pretty standard bar food like sliders and chicken fingers - and there was plenty of it. The place overall had a great atmosphere, and we had a lot of fun. We got in 2 1/2 games (our time was up before we could finish the third game) and when it was over, someone moved our food and beer to a lounge area so we could continue to eat, drink, and hang out. I would definitely recommend Frames for bowling in NYC! Special shout out to Laura, our sales person, who really helped make the event come together!",,,

I am so happy that we went with Frames. I went online and couldn't decide on a package so I gave them a call.I believe I spoke to Laura,she was so friendly and helpful. When we arrived our section was ready and Brian was our server.He had the patience of a saint! Especially because my group couldn't decide on which pitchers to go with.He gave a few suggestions and gave us time to decide without making us feel rushed. Whenever we needed him or needed to order additional things from the menu he was close by.Brian was always pleasant,professional and answered any questions we had, and we had quite a few!We went on a Friday night and after 8 I believe no minors are allowed.The DJ was amazing and after we finished bowling Brian was nice enough to set up a section for us in the back so we could finish our pitcher.We stayed after to play pool and get a few more drinks.Frames  will always be my go to.",,,

Myself and a few of my girlfriends decided to get the guys together with our children and have a fun, chill group Father's Day outing. We picked the Sports Package, and with 12 of us, incl the children, the amount of food we received was more than enough, and they were very accommodating and flexible, even when my party was over a half hour late due to NYC parking (or lack thereof). For groups, this place is great. For dates, this place is great, especially because they have other areas like a karaoke lounge and billiards. It's not a 5-star restaurant, so don't come expecting to get that type of quality with food - but it's definitely bar food yummy. Week-end nights, this place is fun...music/dj plays great music. Will definitely continue to choose this spot for fun group outings.",,,1

86,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,3.0,10/9/2016,"Clean, nice bowling spot in Port Authority.Decor is nice,  the place is updated and clean.  Upbeat clubby music playing with bright light videos on the big screens above the lanes give it a fun Friday or Saturday night vibe.Service was friendly and my extra dirty martini was great.  I forgot my ID the first time we came here and had an issue getting in due to their ""strict policy""...  considering I don't like coming to Times Square unless I have a reason by the second trip in a week  someone would have had to be doing an impressive acrobatic act in the lanes when I scored a strike to make it really impressive.  Also, they had an event going on and for being in Times Square where other bowling alleys have wow-ed me with my son and friends, having various rooms and themes for different lanes, this one did not impress me hugely like the others with its nice but open one room of lanes layout.Seems a super place for a small or large group or company outing as they have nice private areas to accommodate parties. Also ping pong and pool tables.  If bowling, remember ID, and I recommend going on  earlier either afternoon or early eve as I've most enjoyed bowling experiences with a more family friendly crowd at lanes and overall in the Times Square area when it's earlier.",4,2,1

88,Angela K.,"Manhattan, NY",359,368,119,4.0,10/3/2016,"Came here with a group of about 10ish and had a great time. Overall, I really liked this place for the following reasons:1) friendly service, both at the main bar/seating area and bowling area. We enjoyed happy hour while waiting for the rest of our party, then moved over to the bowling area where we enjoyed more drinks and happy hour food while bowling. All of the servers were attentive and friendly (while not overly so). Free popcorn in the main bar seating area.2) decent selection of bowling ball weights. One of my friends and I require a lower weight (we're more petite than the rest) and when we couldn't find what we wanted, someone was able to help us quickly.3) enough space to eat/drink/play.4) other activities available, such as pool and corn holing.5) clean restroom facilities.The only qualm I had was that we weren't allowed to finish our game when time was up. I would have preferred that we had the option to pick whether to continue (and pay a bit more) or stop when our time was up. Other than that, though, it was a fun time and not a pretentious atmosphere like some other bowling places. Definitely going back!",4,,1

Only negative is that it seemed like there was only one playlist on repeat, hearing Migos 4x is annoying as shit. Otherwise, I would recommend it.",,1,

I was able to book my reservation online and when we arrived it was beautiful. The music was awesome, the balls were in great condition and the menu left nothing else to be desired. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because we had a little glitch with our lane and I lost a few frames. This would have been an issue if I stood any chance of winning the game but since my score was a joke we just laughed the whole thing off. We will definitely be back.",,,
94,Kevin P.,"New York, NY",261,34,5,4.0,7/19/2017,"Great environment for a group outing. We did the sports package with beer and it was $50 a person for two hours of bowling, shoes, sliders, wings, fries and beer. This is a pretty good deal for NYC bowling. The staff was attentive and helped with the food as well as setting up the lanes. The scene was fun and exciting with music playing but not too loud where you could not carry on a conversation with your party. Will be back for other group outings.",,,

Once a quarter I look for fun team building events for my small satellite office - and this time I decided on bowling. As I'm sure you know, their are various options for bowling in NY - but Frames was ultimately the best option. First, we were placed in the VIP lounge - which is basically a private area with two private lanes complete with changing LED lights, video screen at the end, music, and 2 hours of bowling time.We also got the Executive Package for 2 hours of all you can drink and eat (5 items chosen off the menu). The third hour didn't include food or drinks, but an hour of either billiards or karaoke. When the time came, we wanted to stay on in the VIP room instead of billiards, and they accommodated us with an additional hour of bowling. We paid for drinks for that additional hour, but the service was such a pleasure - that we provided an additional service charge to the server because he was that good!Overall, was a great experience - from the moment we walked in to the time we left. In fact, I had so much fun - that I'm going back with friends in the future.",,,

Easy to book via email 1,2,3 stress free.... I'd definitely go back!!",,,
97,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,569,74,3.0,7/18/2016,"Strictly OK, but Lucky Strikes is way better. The prices are a complete rip-off, especially if you come at night with 3 or fewer people. $55 for 1 hour of lane, plus $7 shoe charge for both, plus some other gratuitous charge. Day prices are MUCH more reasonable, and you can play for single games. It felt like buying from Comcast or Time Warner Cable and not really knowing what I was being charged for exactly.The lanes are really nicely done and high-tech, though the interface to edit your name, etc., is clunky and has that good old (by which I mean bad) Atari feel. There is also a very poor distribution of balls per lane. Count on having to walk a few lanes over to find that 12 pounder when you find your own stacked with 8's. BOOO. Food is actually very well-priced for some reason, but I'll be sticking with other bowling venues.",7,7,1

100,Valerie T.,"New York, NY",6,2,0,5.0,1/18/2018,"I hosted my birthday there last Sunday and my friends and I had a blast. There were 13 of us who bought the Weekend Remix package that include a platter of appetizers (can't go wrong with chicken tenders!), 2 drinks per person, 2 hours of bowling and the shoes! Laura helped me book this in advance so the check-in was very simple and the self service for shoe pickup made it quick and easy for us to get started. I got to bring in a cake at no additional fee and the platter and drinks was more than enough food and drinks for the 2 hour timeframe. Our server was very helpful throughout the evening. My friends and I had such a fun night bowling and we can't wait to do it again now that we know it's very affordable. I highly suggest Frames for a night out with friends or a little something different for an adult birthday party.",,,

All 18 of us had a super fun time. The food was really good and whatever you don't eat , they will box it up for you so it wont go to waste. the Sangria was yummy and the beer towers is a nice touch. we all enjoyed yourselves.

Food was very good. The Asian Teriyaki Wing were the #1 favorite of the large group as well as the Coconut Shrimp and are must have's. The hummus, burgers and pigs in a blanket were very good. The open bar was great and we had a great waiter I believe his name was Phillip (i hope I got that right) one waiter to wait on over 30 ppl. He did a fantastic job. They gave us pitchers of margaritas, sangrias and beer towers. Anything else we just ordered with our waiter. Bowling was fun and we enjoyed the vibe and music. Karaoke was a lot of fun as well.

113,Tina B.,"Bronx, NY",186,84,96,1.0,4/6/2016,"Where do I begin, lol.1. My event host was unable to check in with my Groupon which would have made this entire ordeal nonexistent. I had to be present to redeem (even though I would have emailed her my information or called to confirm) and I was running late. I missed the cut off time but still wanted to stay.2. I asked if I could trade in the value and just add on whatever extra. I was willing to take one lane (not the two I paid for) for one hour (instead of two) and order food and drinks had they accepted the $149 credit.3. After both my suggestions were denied, I was made to pay $128 for one lane for one hour and another $133 on food and drinks. Neither of which would have been completely bad had the customer service not been so horrible. My guests arrived before I did and when I got there they complained about the front desk staff being rude to them (""Reservation for Tina... how do you even spell that?!"" Exact quote.) and then to top it off our server was equally unprofessional.After our hour was up we finished our food and drink and swiftly exited stage left. I have already left comments to their twitter page about how I was treated. This was no way to spend my birthday at all. No one wants to go back for another visit. The entire experience leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. I just would like my money back from Groupon. I spent way too much as it and like I said had it not been for the fact that it was my birthday and there were people who came from GA to visit I wouldn't have even stayed and wasted the extra funds at all. A total of over $400 for one hour of bowling, some  semi decent wings, and two cocktail pitchers is absolutely ridiculous!",9,,1

This included 2 hours of bowling, shoe rentals, and drinks for both lanes. We had a BLAST!! Alex was our server and he was funny, attentive, and really made sure we had a great time. (Thanks, Alex!!!!) Music was fantastic and the atmosphere was just so much fun. The place was crazy huge!! We didn't even have a chance to check out the other side of the place- there were ping pong tables, billiards tables, and karaoke spots on that side! Along with at least 30 lanes this place was BIG! A few of my friends ordered food and extra drinks too. They said the food was really yummy and fresh and I tasted one of the drinks which was soo good and definitely had a good amount of alcohol! During the reservation process, Laura answered all my questions completely and promptly to make sure I really understood the packages I was looking into. She even emailed me yesterday to follow up on how our night was- so nice!Only things I didn't like:+ We all wish we could have finished the second game! It would have been nice to purchase the number of games in advance instead of pay for the amount of time, but I understand how that wouldn't work with timing and reservations and stuff.+ A few of us got there at 7:45 and was able to keep our jackets, but security made my friends check in their coats after 8. I understand it's for security reasons and our lanes were a little cluttered because some of us had our coats but I felt bad because I did not see that anywhere on the website or in the reservation's fine print. I would have told the group and we would have been prepared with extra cash for it.+ Kinda pricey, but what can ya do- you're bowling in NYC, lol. My friend bought a shot of Fireball and a Blue Moon and his check was $20. I personally knew I was gonna be spending a good amount that night so it didn't bother me but a few of my friends were taken back. (Part of the reason I picked this place over others though was because everything was included in the package (shoes, 2 hours of unlimited bowling, a pitcher of a cocktail per lane). With other places I was looking into, I would have had to ""rent"" lanes and purchase shoe rentals and then if I wanted to add a food or drink package, it would have been an additional per person basis. Just way too complicated to figure all that out, so Frames was easy in that it was one set price for all of that. (Night Owl was around $38 a person with taxes and gratuity added.) )Overall, we all had such a great time and I will absolutely consider this place again whether it's for another party or even if its just my friends and I looking for a night of bowling, table games, and/or karaoke!",,,

After all it is in Port Authority and any ole body goes through port authority *shudders* The location of frames is hip, modern and clean. The food is good for ""bowling alley food"" and the Sangria will get you tipsy. I love the big screen T.V.'s at the end of each lane. The lounge is spacious with sufficient ""2 step"" dance space - please do not come with your subway ""ITS SHOWTIME"" dance moves. The  d.j. The evening I went on a Saturday night was a little.. meh..boring. I would definitely come again but not one of my favorites in its class.",6,3,1

I chose to host a group outing for 19 ppl at Frames because of the amazing package options.  Everything went smoothly from booking online to working with our event coordinator Danielle regarding any changes. We chose the black tie option which includes 2 hrs of bowling, shoe rental and open bar (beer/wine/sangria/soda) while bowling because we enjoy anything that includes unlimited drinks. HahaWhen we arrived on Sunday everything was set up for us. Cynthia who was our server was super friendly and made sure we enjoyed ourselves.We'll definitely be back again and hopefully have less gutter balls. LolOnly word of advise is to make sure your guest are confirmed because at the time of booking you must pay in full for number of guest indicated and it is non refundable. Oh, and look over the dress code policy. You don't want to have to deal with any of your guest being turned away. PS ( the only reason I am not giving Frames a 5 is because I think the dress code is a bit much. I mean this NYC...Most of us wear ripped/distressed jeans) Happy Bowling!",,1,

It is one stop for many things: bowling, ping pong, pool, and a mini dance club (sadly playing hip hop but will do, top 40s or dance would be much better). I am not a bowling pro, but it is a great spot to hang out with friends. It is also a great spot for a date, unlike Bowlmore which has toddlers running into your lane. Not a good combo with cocktails and heavy objects.  The food is really good, not for a bowling alley. It is good food period. I have been many times and will be coming back.Over years of going there, I had only one hiccup. My lane was charged an extra $100 accidentally from the adjacent lane.

HOWEVER, I came here and was blown away but how great it was. There was complimentary coat check on the bottom floors and the whole place looked nice and clean. My friend had set up a party here, reserving three lanes for a group of friends. Each lane came with either a beer tower or a pitcher of margarita. We got pomegranate flavor and it was delicious. We also got a side of fries which were crispy and hot. Delicious!As for the lanes, they were clean with plenty of bowling bowls, a table and cubbies to put shoes or purses. It had everything that was needed. This place had multiple areas including a couple of bar areas with TVs playing sports and plenty of space for sitting down. The music that night was hip hop and my friends and I couldn't help but get down and dirty. When Puff Daddy calls out his bad boys for life, we just had to obey. Overall, it was a great time. Great food, friends, bowling and drinks. I would definitely recommend it for group gatherings looking for something to do.",39,19,42

The representative took our group information and was able to help us with a special deal. We really appreciated the fact that they were extremely considerate and very flexible.Unbelievable food: we had delicious beef slides, the best fries and buffalo wings, the great amount  (We originally thought the amount of food was a bit short, but it actually turned out that we had leftover)We all loved the setting(music, seating, shoes etc) and it is extremely convenient. We would highly recommend this place",,,
124,Kali R.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,14,13,1.0,2/24/2018,"If I could put a ZERO I would! This place had a small kitchen fire. Turned it to a huge fire! Kept people's deposits and ATM cards that were taken by rude bartenders. Dennis the manager was no where in sight to help any of the guest once chaos started. He legit let NYPD handle the situation that they had limited information on. I'm sure because it was the majority of black people a reason and solution was not presented. Police advised they thought it was going to be a riot. Police threaten to arrest people that did not leave. Mind you the establishment still had IDs, ATM cards, and Shoes. Unprofessionalism at its peak and Dennis Monahay was no where in sight to resolve the discrepancies. Told NYPD to tell us to cancel our cards or come back on Monday. Mind you it is Saturday night in Time Square. Never go here. Super hood. Staff is all rude from the security to the bartenders. They also include a 18% gratuity on anything you order. Do not come to this establishment.",2,,

I was able to book two lanes for ten people with food and drinks in five minutes over the phone with one of the great staff members.

After much research and multiple conversations, it became clear that Frames Bowling was the best option.We went with the very reasonably priced Executive Package for our team of 15 consultants, and we were not disappointed! There was plenty of food available, and all of it was delicious (especially the margarita pizza!). The drinks were great as well.The best part was the service. The team there was very helpful at all times, and even accommodated us with extra time bowling when we went over our limit! A big thank you to Laura for coordinating the event!

We paid $39.95 per person for two lanes, shoes, two hours of bowling, 2 beers/wines/or sodas per person and a full platter of wings to share, plus tax and tip. It's a well priced deal and totally worth it. They also checked us all in right away. Everything went really well, everyone had fun, including the birthday girl. The service was friendly and efficient. The Asian Teriyaki wings were amazing, they were crunchy, cooked perfectly and had a nice kick. We also tried the steak quesadillas, the fries and the onion rings, everything tasted good and was well presented. Overall, it's a great venue, with a cool atmosphere. The live DJ provided excellent music. They even have a spacious dance lounge where we hung out after we finished bowling and continued to enjoy our food. We will definitely be returning soon.",,,

I reserved a lane the night prior to going, I didn't get a confirmation email or number but noticed the cost to reserve was deducted from my bank account so I assumed it meant I was good to go! I showed up the next day to Frames just to be told that a pending bill doesn't mean anything and that I didn't have Any reservations. I even showed them my bank statement so they could see the deduction themselves and their reply was pretty much ""OH WELL!"". The manager did NOTHING to accommodate! He was a true asshole and so was the female behind the desk. No compassion or understanding whatsoever!! I'll never give a company with such rude manners and terrible customer service my money!

My friend had made a reservation for tonight and I obviously had to quickly bail on the event because of my situation. Dennis told me that because it was only within an hour of our reservation, we could not change the date at all. He claims they wouldn't be able to fill the lane within the half hour even though the place is always packed and located in Times Square. This establishment is disgusting. If you ever go, ask for Dennis and pour a drink in his face for me. He hung up on me as I was hysterically crying on the phone.",1,,

I booked in advance and was sent a lengthy dress code and was told by the attendant I booked with it was strictly enforced. My party and I followed the code and was even made to take off pieces at the door (jackets/top layers & hats). While playing a party was seated next to us that was breaking all the dress code rules that were made to be enforced for us. they were wearing sweats, jackets, hats, ripped jeans... all things we were told we couldn't wear. It seems to be discriminatory against some groups and not others. In an environment like today we should all be held to the same standards. this would make me question ever being a patron here again.Also a fight ensued while leaving and a overly drunk client was left throwing up and seizing in the doorway while no one helped him upon our group leaving.",3,2,

Lanes were dry as all, when I spoke with staff she didn't seem to know what I was asking about. As a league bowler, I don't recommend bowling there as your ball will just zip into the gutter. I'm sure if I didn't know anything about bowling and use their house balls to have a good time, it may have been a bit more enjoyable.",1,,

Greatest thing I could have done. They have various build a package options and for $10 more a person, you can have the prívate room.

We ordered some appetizers - crab cake, shrimp dumplings, hummus, and pita bread. Plus we had a stand of beer to top it off. One of the guys gave the waiter a nice tip since his service was outstanding. Next thing I knew he brought us shots. We left around 10:30ish on a Friday night and that's when it started to get real crowded. While waiting, you can make yourself comfortable at one of the bars. Don't forget to bring socks.

Our waiter was Nick who was very nice, we had lanes number 23 and 24 at 8pm. A order of wings was place so when the check arrive notice the charge, He called the Manager over she was very unprofessional and rude, I ask for her name she told me Shannon and told my other co worker her name was Jennel, she was a heavy set young lady with blonde hair once she heard our concern she immediately said ""Well someone is going to pay for it"" without even taking into consideration our concern, and immediately telling security she wanted us out treating us like criminal we was followed out to ensure that we would leave. After spending an estimated amount of money, without even taking the customer concern is not the best practice?

Everything sounded great until they called the night before at telling us they only have 2 lanes available due to ""electrical problems."" First off, okay understandable but 22 people on 4 lanes was already too much.. after my friend had to argue with management for one hour we were offered an extra hour bowling or the ""billiards room"". Let me tell you, billiards room = 1 pool table in the middle of the bowling alley. After being there and realizing this we asked if we can switch and do the extra hour. Managements response: ""We can't change you from the pool to the extra hour because we told people they can't use it."" Fair enough... except people not on our party we're indeed USING THE POOL TABLE? Also to just note ...... all lanes were working, remember that electrical problem I mentioned earlier?Basically I do not recommend this place for large parties. Small groups for bowling is okay.

I recommend Frames for private events or even just a regular bowling day. You will enjoy your time here more than other bowling alleys for sure. Check for specials as they always have deals for practically everyday. Overall a great experience.",1,,
175,Chengzhi W.,"New York, NY",87,42,64,5.0,5/26/2017,Amazing experience for a Friday night. Our server was amazing and very helpful. He was the guy who helped Lane 15 Friday night on May 26th. My group of 7 has a great bowling experience plus the food was great.,,,
176,Michele L.,"Merrick, NY",0,3,0,4.0,12/19/2017,"Just had our annual holiday team party here. Second year in a row at this venue. It's clean, professional and the ambiance is just right. The food is really good and presented very nicely. Not your typical bowling alley fare. The service is top notch. Alex was our host and he couldn't be more accommodating. I would highly recommend this place for your next team building experience or just a fun night out with friends.",,,
177,Bryant L.,"Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, NY",3,8,7,1.0,4/10/2016,"So, me and my group of friends are looking for a fun way to celebrate the end of an exhaustive week that managed to learn the one-two combo punch of midterms and term papers. My friends suggested we hit up the bar near our school but I opted for Frames Bowling Lounge. We were, after all a group of ten people. I figured we could have some fun as a group, maybe hold a competition or two, knock the living shit out some pins to relieve our pent up stress. Plus, there's an added bonus of it being a lounge as well; I was proud of myself for having found the perfect hole in one. Well, I must be a very shitty golfer because I have no idea what a hole in one actually constitutes. Allow me to elaborate. I found a Groupon that Frames offered for groups and I purchased it with the sole intent of using it for our little group event. Now, I pride myself on my ability to plan events like this ahead because the last thing I want is to be ripped apart by 9 of my classmates; I called ahead and was assured our little expedition would go smoothly. So you can imagine my surprise when we arrive to find that our Groupon deal was rejected. After a little back and forth, I asked if we could simply apply the price we paid for the Groupon to a bowling session but was refused. Now my friends I major in Civil Engineering so we are not well versed in the realm of mathematics but I am very interested in the method with which this establishment calculates its pricing policies. Next time, be upfront about your Groupon policies, and by 'upfront' I don't mean telling me face to face after I've traveled to your place. To the two the other yelpers who experienced my woe, I wholeheartedly invite you to join me and my friends at the bar we should have went to in the first place.",10,5,1
178,Gigi P.,"Bronx, NY",0,17,27,1.0,10/13/2017,"I had to ask several times to be seated away from the large crowds taking advantage of the $24.95 3hr game play which I thought was completely unfair due to the fact that the fee for 1 lane for 1 hour was $90.24 including the shoe rental and we still had people coming into our lanes , not to mention we lost about 8 min of playtime which adds up to $12.03 because they were cleaning our area which the people next door created a big mess at never again.",1,,
179,Rex C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,5,5,1.0,4/12/2017,"After 2 hrs of bowling and ordered 6 food platters and a margarita pitcher and a tower of beer. The lane closes in the middle of 10th frame and we asked nicely to the front desk for 2 minutes to finish the game. Wouldn't give it to us and gave us a huge attitude like we weren't good enough to even be at this place. The guy was really rude. We came with 8 people and we will tell everyone never to come to this place in the future. I get it if it was a packed night but its wednesday and its empty!![edit] so from further searching through all the past bad reviews, its mostly all related to how rude the front desk is. Go figure",1,,
180,D H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,34,5,5.0,12/12/2017,Frames is absolutely amazing. The staff is always welcoming and friendly. I come here at least twice a month and they never let me down .,,,
181,Ewela G.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/5/2018,"We didn't know where to have our company's Christmas Party. We didn't want to just go to restaraurant or bar and get drunk:)We wanted to do something 'different':) Frames Bowling Loung was great choice! We had so much fun bowling, drinking and eating. We bought the package 2h of bowling plus 1h ping pong or billard, all together 3 hours with unlimites food and alcohol. It was a great deal. We ended up extending one more hour. Great place. Suprisingly was't crowded at all the weekend before Christmas. Highly recommend. Service was great, drinks were great, food was great. Will be back. 5 stars!",,,
182,Andie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,638,92,3.0,8/9/2016,"I came here with a friend to play a couple of games before having lunch. The place wasn't packed but we were the only ones waiting to purchase a couple of rounds. The two cashier ignored us for a good portion of the time and was talking to each other. When another group of people came to play, they took them over us and made us wait even longer. The shoes and lanes were decrepit. Our computer kept freezing along with the machine to place new pins. We spent more time waiting for them to fix the issue than we got to play. The food and beverages were okay, but pricey for what they were.",1,,
183,Jessy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",221,174,369,3.0,5/18/2015,"Came here on May 9th 2015 with three coworkers from 12 am - 3 am. Absolutely  loved  the $20 per person deal for unlimited  bowling plus the shoes. They allowed my party to bowl despite one member of my party forgetting their ID at home. The security  guard was a bit disrespectful and irate. However,  the service was overall  good and the music was amazing.  The food is a little on the pricey side and there isn't  much to choose from  on the menu. The waiter forgot  to include my strawberry  shake in our order due to rushing  to end his shift. Other than that the experience  was great and I'll definitely return.",3,1,
184,Chris S.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,9,0,4.0,6/20/2018,"I had never been to Frames in the past but I knew it existed for a while.  I was pleasantly surprised when I booked my company outing that the place didn't look old and rundown.  For the most part, it is tastefully decorated and feels very current and upscale.  I booked here because their pricing is on the website.  I didn't have to submit requests for quotes or call someone and wait to hear back.  It was simple and I was able to chat directly with a booking agent on the website.  Our group booked the executive party with two hours of bowling, 1 hour of additional activity. (We did karaoke) The food choices were replenishable during the initial 2 hours and we had a basic open bar.  The Sangria was really tasty and the food options were pretty good for bowling alley food. Our lane attendant (ALEX) was amazing. We were the first group in the door and I thought he was just hosting us but soon realized he would be spread out over several events and general customers.  This worried me because when you pay for bottomless food and drinks you don't want to be waiting for your server to wait on other customers.  Alex worked his butt off and made us feel like we were always important and kept us happy.  I don't think I ever saw a server in NYC move as fast as him and accurately.  He asked for drink orders and came back with 100% accurate drinks.  He explained everything to us and was really one of the best servers I think I ever had in NYC.  I do feel someone else would not have handled that much workload as well.  (As a side note, I never met Alex until today, he just really impressed us!!!)  The bowling was fun, we had no lane issues.  Shoes fit, were comfortable, the bowling balls we plentiful and fit everyone's fingers.  At the end of our two hours Alex gathered up leftovers, boxed them and got us into the karaoke room for our last hour.  Our staff had a blast in here.  It went over better than I could ever have imagined.  Alex showed up with items we inadvertently left at our lane. (Thank you Alex, again!)  At the end we gathered our stuff, returned the microphones and the front desk attendant was holding my ID and Credit Card waiting for me instead of making me wait for her! Overall, my staff had a great time and I couldn't be happier.  Thanks for making our event so painless and carefree!!",,,
185,Alexa B.,"New York, NY",3,8,4,4.0,7/22/2016,"I came here with a bunch of co-workers for a team outing. The place is great for big groups. The original deal was two hours of bowling, an hour in the  billiards room and unlimited amounts of beer, wine and our choice of 5 appetizers. The staff was very attentive and kept the food and drinks coming. Since we were really enjoying the bowling, they allowed us to use swap our hour in the billiard room for extra time on the lanes. Overall it was a great time and would highly recommend for big group events.",1,1,
186,Sam D.,"Charlotte, NC",25,210,141,4.0,6/2/2015,"Conviently located in the Port Authority bus terminal so location shouldn't be a problem for NY/NJ invitees.Very cool place to spend a few hours with friends. Frames is a bit on the expensive side but I guess that's just NY and Midtown. Frames offers bowing of course, great drinks full bar, good music very diverse and has maybe 2 or 3 pool tables. My recommendation if you plan to visit is to make a reservation or be prepared to wait a few hours for a lane. They have a few deals throughout the week but I'm sure Friday is the busy days.My group consisted of 10 people so we had two lanes. I believe it was $35 ea for the reservation which included shoes and we spent maybe another $400 on food & drinks. Overall, very clean and cool place. The staff was extremely helpful when some of our pins tried escaping but took like 10 mins so we basically lost that time off our reservation without recompense. The lanes are a tad on the dark side as well.",2,1,
187,Jared N.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/7/2017,"We hosted a ~50 person work event here for the third year in a row and it has always worked out flawlessly. The food is outstanding (we had the chicken tenders, pigs in blankets, chips/guac, margarita pizza, and beef sliders - all were excellent). We had the endless food and drink for two hours, and nothing was ever running low. The venue is wonderful and clean, and there is an abundance of bowling balls in all different sizes so you don't have to run around searching for one. The staff was very helpful and always attentive, and at one point I asked for a certain bowling ball (I didn't know if they had a 6) and the guy ran and found one for me. All in all, this was a great event and we will definitely be back next year!",,,
188,Alexis H.,"New York, NY",18,21,17,4.0,5/22/2017,"I recently hosted an event here for my team, there were 12 of us in total. We decided on a party package that included a lot of unlimited goodies. The food was surprisingly good especially the mac 'n cheese balls and the sliders. I was most surprised at the awesome customer service we received. Our waitress was extremely attentive and always made sure we had what we needed. We definitely got our monies worth and enjoyed ourselves. It was a great team bonding experience and I would host an event here again. Thanks, Frames!",,,
189,Laura B.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",2,5,0,5.0,11/15/2017,We hosted a work event at Frames last week and I was truly impressed with how smoothly everything ran. Laura was incredibly easy to work with and made sure we had enough food and drinks. She even helped me with a last minute change in numbers. My guests had a great time and stayed at the bar after to hang out. We will definitely be doing this again next year!,,,
190,Vincent K.,"Far Rockaway, NY",83,2,0,5.0,5/10/2017,Really good food and drinks. I especially liked when I walked in for my reservations they have me wait.

191,David D.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,12/18/2017,"My office went to Frames for our Holiday outing. It was the perfect venue this this, a great combination of food/drink and an activity! The experience/service could not have been better. We were assigned a lane side attendant who was super attentive from start to finish. I'm certain this will be our annual outing now as this is the ONLY thing all 17 of us can agree on!",,,

Thieves!!!! Anyways, frames was such a pleasant experience the atmosphere is amazing the food is great the price is well worth it!! We all really enjoyed ourselves and the food here, and I'm a foodie !! The burgers, wings, and fries were great!! Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Will definitely be returning here !",,,

194,Stephanie F.,"Riverdale, NY",0,1,1,5.0,5/25/2017,"My organization held its annual event at Frames this year.  We invited 150 high school seniors from across the city in order to celebrate their college acceptances.  Most students did not know each other, so it was important that the space be conducive to new introductions.  I honestly can't say enough good things about Frames.  Not only was Laura very communicative and helpful during the planning process -- she responded to emails within minutes and even let us ship our swag directly to Frames so that we didn't have to lug it with us on the subway -- but also once we arrived, everyone was kind and helpful.  At one point, someone even alerted us to the fact that there was a car accident in Times Square and that we might want to check on our students and/or be aware that some might be late.Not only that, but the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably some of the best wings I've had in a long time.  I'm sure that the next time I come to Frames, it'll be with friends and family, not just co-workers.",,,
195,Ali P.,"Manhattan, NY",11,9,4,5.0,5/22/2017,Recently did a two hour event for my team. The food was delicious and the drinks were great. Most importantly the service was on point. There was no shortage of refills and everyone had a great time!,,,

197,Penny C.,"Mamaroneck, NY",29,8,0,5.0,4/11/2016,Took a group of 8 for the 2-hour food/bowling/cocktails package.  The food choices were extensive and the food itself was super yummy and generous.  The service was spot on and the team had a really great time. We extended an extra hour for some free-form ping-pong and a little cornhole.  All in all a nice place for work events during a weekday.,2,1,1
198,Nia A.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,38,10,4.0,2/23/2015,I had my 22nd birthday pre party here 3days ago.Pros: The VIP room was AMAZING!The Sangrias were really good and got me where I needed to be and beyond (Coming from a person that drinks every blue moon)VIP room allows you to play your own musicWe had a shit load of funCons:Security is EXTREMELY rudeStaff does not have great communication between each other. (I'll talk about below)The server for my 2hour already paid for VIP room was ridiculously SLOW! He literally came every 15mins and it took him at least 15 mins to bring back 1 pitcher. Now the issue was I paid for 10 ppl to attend this event. All 10 showed up and 1 had to go home because he had on construction boots. I spoke to anyone I could about this and we got to a mutual understanding. They claimed they didn't have my card information on file so they had to get it again. They deducted the person that couldn't attend because of their shoes from my final payment. Next day I wake up to being charged twice the adjusted remaining balance and the non adjusted remaining balance. Now today I'm still having trouble getting my money back from these people and it's very frustrating. The event planner Meghan was never available even days before my event. I had to call and leave so many messages to which none of them she returned until I called her the DAY of my event.Overall this was my 3rd time at this bowling alley and I absolutely LOVE this place. It's 10x better than Lucky Strike. It's really pricey but I promise you'll have sooooooo much fun here.,5,,
199,Jessica M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",17,320,6,2.0,3/23/2015,"I came here for a friend's birthday. Another friend of mine and I wound up having to check the party in at the desk since she was running late, and we wouldn't be able to make up lost time. That's my friend's fault, not the establishments. I thought security was fine, but some of my friends said they were rude. My friend bought a package that was supposed to include a beer tower and burgers/fries for everyone. We only got two burgers, and we never got the beer tower. I felt it was pricey for bowling, especially since service was so inattentive.",3,,
