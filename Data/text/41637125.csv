1,Jennifer M.,"Bethesda, MD",227,145,1177,5.0,2/21/2018,They have so much room to cater to almost every event. They offer cooking classes and I believe a cocktail making class. The food is great too. The place is super cute and very inviting. They sell cute things too like cookbooks.,,,
2,Sam S.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,29,1,1.0,8/22/2018,Stepped in for coffee and with the worst attitude i was ever given by a store associate was told they were closed. The barista was a male with glasses. Get your customer relations in check. A simple sorry were closed isn't hard.,,,
3,Doug M.,"Snoqualmie, WA",128,34,22,5.0,3/27/2018,"What a phenomenal night! I was visiting NYC from Tucson, AZ and decided a cooking class would be a great option for dinner! We loved the watch & learn and the hands-on aspects of the class, made even better with snacks and wine! Our chef was very clear in making a complex dish seem easy and I left with the confidence to make Veal Osso Buco myself at home! I also now (finally!) have the perfect excuse to buy a large Le Creuset dutch oven... something I've trying to justify purchasing to myself for a long time.Don't think twice about Haven's Kitchen - sign up for a class and have fun! It's awesome for date night and would work well for groups too. So fun.",2,,
4,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1398,568,597,5.0,11/22/2016,"I was able to take a cooking class here thru Wall Street Journal Plus and loved it! The class started at promptly 5pm and was approximately 2.5 hours long. As soon as we stored our belongings away we were greeted with wine in hand... yea this is already starting off well. Most people had red or white but I actually opted for a craft beer/wine creation that they had which was amazing!The main chef Alexis Delaney was phenomenal. She was friendly, bubbly and great with instruction. We initiated around the main stove introducing ourselves before we headed over to our stations to slice and dice. This was a Thanksgiving inspired menu as it is that time of year. This class was 100% hands on. No cookbooks just simple instruction. The entire time we were cooking someone was going around refilling our wine glasses as well. Our menu consisted of the following:Stuffed pumpkins with wild rice, sausage, pecans and cranberryPotato & celery root pureeMushroom gravy sauceBrussel sprouts with chestnut & pomegranateChicory Salad with fennel, apple & blue cheesePear tarte tatin for dessertEverything we made was literally superb. I want to start taking cooking classes regularly so that I can cook with this amount of flavor, it was amazing. After enjoying cooking and mingling we all sat down for a family style dinner to eat all of the decadent things that we had made. The class was 12 people including myself so it was very intimate. This class was super fun and if you have the opportunity to take a cooking class here I would highly recommend it! I am making two of these dishes for my family this Thanksgiving!",13,5,10
5,Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",109,702,905,5.0,6/25/2016,"Loved this class!  Amazing instructor and staff/helpers. David was so entertaining and engaging, making jokes, keeping everyone's interest. He was patient and friendly, answering questions throughout his demonstrations. We really learned a lot in such a short amount of time. We learned how to butcher two fishes --  a large fluke and a branzino. With the fluke, we worked in small groups of 4. With the branzino, there was enough for everyone to butcher one individually, which was nice. It really forced you to focus and practice what you literally just learned. The fluke was easier, a bigger filet, which we chopped and used in a delicious citrusy ceviche. The Branzino was harder and a lot of people butchered it poorly. It was smaller, and had pin bones that you had to carefully tweeze out. We cooked that one in parchment paper, in the oven, with a variety of flavoring -- salt, herbs, veggies, olive oil. The next dish was a deliciously rich brown buttered branzino. It had some acidity and saltiness that rounded out everything. While some students made the buttered branzino, David helped a cluster of other students with shucking oysters. It was pretty hard, but everyone had so much fun doing it. When everything was done, we sat at the long table to eat, with our wine glasses (felt so grown up!). Then we enjoyed all our work! It was light, refreshing, and paired perfectly with a simple salad. After we were done eating, we got a tour of the place, going upstairs to the other entertaining rooms. beautiful place, elegant and mature in terms of their decor. Black and white paint, tiling, wooden flours, sturdy wood dining tables, and super clean/somewhat spacious bathrooms. And side note, the paper towels in the bathroom are super thick! It was basically the same as the ones I got at Bliss Spa. A winner in my book! I also have to give a shout out to David's helper, Jerome, who was a butcher and was very knowledgeable and patient as he walked around overseeing our work. I accidentally skinned my knuckle, and he quickly stepped in to help. I wish both David and Jerome taught more classes personally, because I would definitely take them! Overall, this establishment is so welcoming. My husband and I came a bit early and inquired about the class. The guy manning the treats/drinks said we could wait, they were still setting up, and asked if we wanted anything. This is a place you want to come back to, because they appreciate and value you as a customer.",4,1,2
6,Mary T.,"New York, NY",6,13,1,5.0,12/21/2017,"What a find! I have always passed by thinking this was just a cooking school, but the cafe is fantastic. The Kale Caesar Salad was delicious. The atmosphere is super chill, especially for this busy neighborhood. A great alternative to the crazy busy bakery down the street.",,,
7,Jennifer M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,4,0,5.0,6/7/2018,"Where to even begin with this review, except by saying there aren't enough characters to even describe how much we love every detail about HK. The venue is so romantic, intimate and personal and from the initial meeting to the day of, we always felt like it was being planned and coordinated by our closest friends. The entire staff pays attention to every single detail and truly wants to know how to make your day everything you imagined and then deliver just that and more. We worked with the culinary team to create a custom menu and even had signature cocktails that were created based on some of our favorite drinks. The communication with Halle during the planning stages made this bride, a Type A planner feel very relaxed. By the day of, I knew everything was going to be taken care of and I didn't have to worry about a thing. Halle helped us with decisions that we didn't even know we had to make and made everything fun along the way. Then the day of arrives and every single detail came out better than expected, a complete dream come true. Irit was with me every step of the way on that day of, from keeping me company when everyone else was walking down the aisle to even offering to assist a bride in need of an extra hand in the restroom : ).  The food and drinks flowed seamlessly, our friends and family still talk about our meal and then dance party that ensued into the night. We've only been married for 2.5 years and we already want to renew our vows, just so we can get married all over again at Haven's Kitchen.",,,
8,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1913,4.0,3/9/2016,"As Maid of Honor to one of my best friends (shoutout to Valerie G!!) in the world, I couldn't turn down the offer to attend a flower bouquet making class that was being hosted at Haven's Kitchen. Using her powers of deal finding, she was able to get us in at a steep discount through Gilt. My first impression of Haven's kitchen was that it was adorable. The front of the place is a cute café and in the back and up the stairs, there is space for events such as cooking classes, hosting parties, and in our case, a bouquet class that included appetizers and unlimited Prosecco in Punch form. Delicious! We were on the third floor and the space was definitely great for hosting a party for a semi-big group. The whole place had an eloquent rusticness to it. The class itself was nice and informative but I think just the whole vibe of the place and the service was top notch. I also would like to point out that their food was amazing. My friend was so impressed. She was saying that she would have definitely considered using them as caterer if she didn't already have choosen one. I couldn't disagree with her as everything was so yummy. We were served little cute fried rice balls, curry chicken wrapped with lettuce bibs, short ribs empanadas, mini crab cakes and a toastini. Everything was high quality, fresh tasting and full of flavor. They constantly ensured there was enough food going around which is always appreciated in events like this as people snatch up the food as quickly as it comes out. Overall, two thumbs up!",9,3,8
9,Nicole I.,"New York, NY",1,49,0,5.0,1/31/2018,"Super cute little cafe in a cooking school. Great for lunch, and not as crowded as everything else (although there's still a line). I especially love the simplicity of the menu: there's a rotating selection of 2 soups, 2 salads, 2 sandwiches. You can get a combo of any two. So that's 30 different lunch options! And the ingredients are fresh and the food is innovative without being too weird for a simple lunch.",,,

13,Sebastian K.,"New York, NY",41,373,0,5.0,7/13/2016,Beautiful coffee shop!! Everything is excellent here from the coffee to the decor and how they serve you the drinks.I had an iced decaf americano with almond milk and it was served in a mason jar which keeps the coldness of the drink instead of a plastic cup which I find not welcoming at all to have a coffee.I didn't taste their pastries but I bet they are awesome too. You can see the staff cooking and preparing food on the back.Just beautiful!,,,
14,Nancy R.,"New York, NY",176,87,119,5.0,12/12/2016,"Such a cute coffee shop!! One of those place you want to take pictures of, especially the bathroom!!I came here for a private event in the back kitchen which was incredible bc the whole thing is so open and you can see the chefs prepare everything. I had to come back the next day and get the full Haven's Kitchen experience bc the decor was so cute that I knew it had to be good. Sure enough a cozy warm vibe during the day. People are working on laptops but its very quiet and not so packed that you can't find a seat. I just got a latte and relaxed with my thoughts for 15 bc living in NY we forget about that sometimes. I def want to come back and try their lunch. If you're looking for a cute coffee place with a low-key coffee/bite/study/work situation this is your place.",3,,1

Suzanne and Halle were great to work with.  Suzanne was organized, efficient and very reassuring during the entire planning process.  The venue itself is beautiful and created a very intimate atmosphere for the wedding.  The food was delicious and they had no problem accommodating our guests that needed gluten free or vegan diets.Thank you Haven's Kitchen for some great memories!",,,

I really enjoyed the cooking class.  The instructor was a guest and the featured ingredient was fermented vegetables from a local farm.  The class was excellent- the instructor explained everything step by step and the students worked together and then sat down afterwards for a delightful dinner together.  I just wish they would have had all the students wash their hands before food preparation.",1,2,1
17,Brian S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",120,84,7,5.0,2/10/2016,"My wife thought we should come here and take a class. She believed I would enjoy getting out of the house, drinking wine, chatting with people and cooking things. The teacher Syd was lovely. She made sure I had wine from the get-go. Very important.The class was centered around ramps season. Until that time I was unaware there were vegetables called ramps and I certainly didn't know they had a season.  Ramps are delicious garlic-like things. You can, I came to learn, make all sorts of amazing dishes with them. I love ramps, and I long for their season to return. That's not a statement I would have ever made before this class.The revelations kept coming too: I've been using a knife improperly my entire life. Kosher salt is actually dramatically different than regular salt. There is a professional way to pinch salt.Also, the wine kept coming. Very important.The class had several women. I remember thinking that if I were single I would take classes here. And download Tinder.Everyone gets assigned tasks. Chopping things. Stirring things. Mixing things. Separating yolks. We all had purpose in our lives. FOR ONCE.I was assigned with another guy, Ben, to the Baby Artichoke Fryer task force. Our mission? Cut baby artichokes just right, lightly batter them and give them a little fry. Ben and I had a good system going. We bonded. Just two manly guys working as a manly team to make artichokes not be raw anymore. Comrades-in-artichokes. I imagine it's the same kind of connection a man makes with another man in combat, except your life isn't on the line because you're delicately frying vegetables.In the end, it all came together and we sat down to a big, delicious, socially engaging ramps-infused feast. With wine. Very important.We've since been back for a second class from the Murray's Cheese people. It was fantastic.I see there's a third class on the horizon because my wife and I share not only joint banking accounts but joint iPhone calendars. That's love.",2,16,3
18,Ellen L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",10,74,2,5.0,12/26/2016,"Where do I even begin? Halle, Bryn, Irit and Chef David are all just outstanding. My husband and I held our surprise wedding here earlier this month and planned it all in under 3 months. Halle was an absolute pleasure to work with and gave us the timeline that we needed to stick to. My husband and I were pretty lacksadasical with our planning and had some pretty crazy scheduling conflicts leading up to our wedding day so we really appreciated Halle keeping us on task and checking in with us to make the various decisions. Halle also brought in her expertise to help us make some of the decisions that we really didn't know/care that much about (like what color/texture linens..??). She also used some tricks to help us stick with our budget which we also really really appreciated. The day before our wedding, we met with Halle, Bryn and Irit when we dropped off all our decorations and supplies. During the planning, we communicated primarily with Halle but when we met for the rehearsal, it was clear that Bryn and Irit had both been looped in to all the details (our candy bar, tea for our parents, surprise party, etc) On the actual day, Irit and Bryn were total rockstars in making sure the wedding went smoothly. They were on hand for the setup and kept an eye on the flow of food and drink throughout the night. Bryn was also my signal girl when it came time for my processional.  After the wedding, the HK team meticulously packed away all our gifts and decorations back in the bins and got it ready for us to pick up during the week. TLDR: the HK team is a true gem and I would recommend anyone to hold their event here. Separately, their coffee is bomb. so basically, there really isn't anything they can't do.",2,,
19,Dimitri S.,"New York, NY",61,229,333,5.0,2/12/2017,"Great place to take a cooking class. The kitchen is large enough for a group of up to 12 to participate and gather around the island space. We learned how to make Coq Au Vin and our chef instructor and hosts were terrific. The wine was flowing, overnight for the chicken and during the class for the participants. The three course meal was delicious. They also have two larger event spaces above the floor with kitchen. Looking forward to taking another class in the coming months. Book early as the classes fill up.",,,
20,Haven B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,10,4.0,12/3/2016,"We enjoyed our class, noddles around the world. It was intimate (10-12 people) with lots of hands on instruction.

21,Jasmine W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,70,2,4.0,10/28/2016,I've come here for lunch a few times. They always have vegetarian options. I also did a cooking class (pasta making); it was amazing! Would definitely recommend for the class.,,,
22,jordan s.,"Manhattan, NY",4,36,1,5.0,6/23/2016,"I did a vegetarian cooking class here with my wife and mom. The whole experience from start to finish was fantastic. It was a laid back atmosphere with wine served throughout, no pressure on how to make the different dishes, help from the team and the menu (and later the meal) were delicious. I'm not a vegetarian and actually love eating meat, this simply happened to be the only class that fit our schedules, wasn't booked and was best suited for my wife's dietary restrictions. I was a bit nervous that the menu would be gross and it would be an unpleasant experience. It wound up being great which I imagine all their different classes/meals are so I wouldn't worry about which one you choose. I would 100% recommend going here and one final pro tip- if you like granola, they sell their own custom homemade granola in the store and its incredible. Buy some as a parting souvenir!",1,,1
23,Dana C.,"Eastchester, NY",2,38,6,2.0,1/15/2015,"Cooking ClassI Instructor is good, resulting food was terrible.Having read some very good reviews about the cooking classes at Haven's Kitchen, combined with my eating style of very fresh and healthy food, I was really excited to take a class called ""California Cooking for New York Seasons"".I really liked the way Chef Sydney Wilcox had the class structured, she gave guidance, but the participants were the ones who really prepared the food. She would stop at various points and give us pointers about different knife skills, why a dish is prepared this way, and that anchovies lose their fishy flavor when cooked (NOT TRUE!).The food included Bagna Cauda (this is the dish that reeked on anchovies - sorry I detest them), which I found inedible, although it looked great. There was also aroasted vegetable salad with a stinky-feet kind of cheese, which I also found inedible. There were pan roasted starchy vegetables (potatoes, jerusalem artichokes) that were bland, a chicken that was dry-marinated with herbs and rubbed down with duck fat that had absolutely no taste (how on earth was that possible?). Last and least, a lemon pudding cake that was so cloyingly sweet it could have put the most hearty of people into a sugar coma - but not in a good way.Although I would not recommend this class, especially if you are looking forward to eating the fruits of your labor.",2,,

It was advertised as a class where we would learn knife techniques, as well as be provided with a full meal - neither of which happened. We stood around a cramped space and were ""taught"" how to cut vegetables at a level pretty much prepared for a new born chimpanzee. The ""meal"" that was subsequently provided consisted of the uncooked vegetables we just hacked, and a few chickens that the 12 dirty-handed patrons had just mauled before being dumped into a bucket. We left $90 lighter, completely bored, and very hungry.",4,,1
27,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",16,47,5,1.0,7/13/2015,"I'm still in planning stages of my wedding, but I'm flummoxed by how I was treated by their events coordinator. I'm not much of an party planner and don't really know how to throw a wedding. So far this fact has not been much of a deterrent in my search for a venue... Most coordinators sit down and go over their pricing structure and options and discuss your taste and expectations, making the process very clear. This wasn't the case at Haven's Kitchen. First red flag was my email attempting to confirm an appointment time got lost in the coordinator's inbox, so I had to wait an additional week to see the space. Second red flag was upon arriving early, she admitted it worked great because she had accidentally double-booked my appointment, so there was time for me to see the space before the next people. She then rushed us upstairs to look at the ceremony space with a, ""well, this is it"" attitude. She honestly gave me a sense that she'd rather not plan my particular wedding... Explaining very little and very tersely. She seemed to expect that I command the process, but as I said previously, I dont really know what I'm doing and I wouldn't know where to start, I can't be the only bride without an idea of how to throw a wedding. Any questions I asked were answered brusquely, as if I should know the answers. I asked to confirm that extra things were included... tables, chairs, silverware, linens... Instead of confirming she decided to go the negative route, ""We don't have linens."" Great, okay, thanks, I was just listing possible items, but everything else? ""Yes"". K. I ended it there, but it would have been nice to have that line of questioning led by her instead... The types of tables they provide, their set-ups, etc. The area described to me as the place where the bridal party can lounge/briefly escape (living room, not bridal suite) is behind clear glass. I asked if people tend to cover the glass, for privacy. A reasonable question, I'd think, but no. Everyone leaves it open. Honestly, what if someone wanted privacy, do they seriously lack the lateral thinking required to imagine the space with a removable drape? Why does this suggestion ring as a ridiculous concept to the ears of their coordinator?To be honest, it wasn't her actual words or responses, but rather her demeanor. My friend that came with me picked up on this as well. When she asked whether the space provided wifi, the coordinator bluntly asked ""Why?"" You could read that and think a person is not being rude when they ask this simple question, but the delivery was so blunt that I was taken aback. I decided that even if I loved the space (it was fine, reasonably priced) I really did not want to entrust this person to the coordination of my ceremony and reception. I didn't want to feel dumb for asking a question that might have an obvious answer or sound like a silly suggestion. I want to work with people who are happy and excited to work with me. Halle just came off unprofessional, which is surprising considering her impressive resume. I initially chalked it up to inexperience, but that's not the case. I could list the awkward moments, but the whole experience was awkward overall... Random questions about my dress/bustle, the suggestion that I check out their Pinterest, instead of actually having photos on hand to show people...  I dunno. There was no clear intention she wanted any part in my wedding or interest in my business, so I decided not to waste either of our time and cut the appointment short. Let's face it, this is NY, wedding venues are not suffering for work, but honest to God, I will never recommend this place based on this experience. I really should have just left it at the forgotten email.",17,,
28,Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",617,100,180,3.0,1/23/2015,"I came here for a warm drink so this review has nothing to do with their cooking class and the bazillion of other things they offer here.The place is BEAUTIFULLY decorated. I'm in love. Everything is so simple yet sophisticated. There is a giant menu with a ton of drinks and pastries to choose from. There were plenty of seats open but the place definitely wasn't empty. Besides drinks and pastries, they also sell snacks, quirky objects, and other things across from the register.The barista was really friendly and I ordered my go-to, a chai latte. As great as this place sounds, my trip ended poorly when I took my first sip of my drink. Maybe the barista thought I said a latte or maybe she had an off-day because my chai latte wasn't spicy enough to be a proper chai latte. For $4.50 for a small cup, I'm not impressed. Haven's Kitchen's cafe is a chill place to be that is spacious that serves a variety of drinks and pastries. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely pop in but will have to try another drink.",,1,

I know about havens kitchen as a cafe more than a cooking space (although I can attest that the decor is very sweet- think modern practicality with small touches of DIY quirk).I love their products, coffees and teas. This is an affordable cafe with high quality beans and leaves. My favorite is the rooibos tea, which has a citrusy note that I haven't tasted with other rooibos teas.It's a great place to read or do work (free wifi). The restaurant also has a great vision of being a community space and uniting local farmers with local consumers with sustainable crops. How can you beat that?",5,1,1
32,Andy L.,"New York, NY",31,20,4,2.0,7/16/2013,"My fiancé and I were all set to put a deposit down for our wedding at Haven's Kitchen when we learned that it would cost us nearly 3x what we had been quoted. Not only were the food and beverage prices higher, but the venue rental, which had been quoted at $5K, was actually $15K. If the cafe on the bottom floor was left open the cost could drop down to $9K. I researched over 30 wedding venues in Manhattan and the venue rental price makes Haven's Kitchen easily one of the most expensive places in Manhattan to have an event. Additionally, we had been told that the venue rental cost was inclusive of rentals and flowers for the space. Neither of these things turned out to be true. Yes, the furniture and whatnot that they do have is included, but it is not enough to have an event for the full 100 people that the space fits. The cost of flowers is not at all included. They will provide the arrangements, but you will be paying for them. My fiancé said that she would never try on a wedding dress that she couldn't afford because she didn't want to fall in love with something she couldn't have and that's unfortunately just the experience we had with Haven's Kitchen. We loved the venue but wasted time visiting and discussing a place that was absolutely not in our price range, even though we had been told it was, and were left feeling disappointed, frustrated, and lied to. If you have $50K to spend on venue, food and beverage alone, than buy all means visit Haven's Kitchen, but if you have a more moderate budget than don't bother, because they cannot accommodate you.",18,1,
33,Evelyn L.,"New York, NY",77,150,7,5.0,4/14/2014,"I've been here twice for two completely different events on different floors. Both were really well planned and enjoyable.My first time at Haven's, I was here was for a fashion launch party in the event space on the top floor. The space was bright and airy, with more than enough space for ~50 guest to wander and browse through racks of pretty clothing. I imagine this place would also be a nice location for a medium sized wedding (~100 people). Haven provided pastries and champagne for the launch party. Although I can't give them credit for the bubblies, the dessert, I assume, came from their kitchen and tasted heavenly.The second time we actually got to take a private cooking lesson in the kitchen/dining area on the ground floor. We made sunchoke soup, fennel and citrus salad, roasted beets, skirt steak and lemon tart. Chef David patiently demonstrated each step and carefully supervised us to make sure no one messed up too badly. Despite being cooked by a bunch of finance dudes and their tipsy spouses, the food actually came out tasting quite good. If you're looking to have an office social event, I highly recommend Haven's cooking classes - it sure beats awkwardly shifting your feet as you make small talk with your fiance's colleague's wife at some random restaurant.",1,,1

So sad to be leaving my favourite coffee spot in NYC!,,,
36,Mrs P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,3/24/2015,"We just had our sons wedding for 22 guests at Havens Kitchen and it was a pleasure from start to finish. With only 6 weeks to plan Havens Kitchen staff made us feel confident that they could make the day run with ease and they did. Halle and Bryn made us welcome and there was excellent communication at every turn  with ourselves and our vendors.We held the ceremony and had the dinner and dancing in the third floor loft venue. The room is real NYC downtown loft style bright and light just ready to be customized with personal touches and bright flowers.  Meal service was impeccable and cocktails delicious, the Hemingway Daiquiri was a big hit. The photos from the day say it all lots of happy faces!",3,,
37,Jean H.,"New York, NY",122,465,13,4.0,6/30/2013,"Came here twice, once to scope out the space for something wedding related, and again for a fundraiser. As a Chinese American person.... this place is waay too small for a wedding of Chinese proportions*. My guest list was about to burst at the 200 guest** seams and this lovely place can accomodate... 70? I was still hoping i'd be an alright size for my wedding rehearsal dinner.The fundraiser was amazing. the food.... i am still dreaming about it. You will be very delighted with this space as you will not need to do much decorating at all and the food is a delight.*** --------*Just think about China's population pre-State-imposed family planning.... yeah, there is no state-imposed family planning here in America.... well, we're just like down n' dirty rabbits**I ultimately didn't get married, but I guarantee if I ever go down that route again.... I very well may return here as I will def. not be hosting a Kardashian sized wedding! *** quality here, not quantity or size. its how you use it, folks, not the size.",1,4,1
38,Kimberlee V.,"New York, NY",19,40,12,4.0,7/18/2013,Super cute place tucked away from 6th Ave. Ordered a muffin and lemonade. Both were delicious. Wish there was more on the baked good menu. Went at 11 o'clock so perhaps they were all sold out from the morning? I used a FourSquare deal where you get a large drink for the price of a small. It had a grade pending in the window but it seemed very clean from the front. A nice table in the back to work on your laptop. Otherwise high bar stools in the front. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!,1,,
39,Benji S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,17,0,5.0,5/29/2012,"I had a Saturday night engagement party here, and I could not give this place a more glowing review! NY is amazing for our hidden gems, and Haven's Kitchen is one of the rare establishments that really make NYC an even better place to live.Service: Incredible! Rather than treating you like a customer, they treat you like a friend throwing a party. The whole party planning process was incredibly easy, as their coordinator took care of everything and was really great about communicating with us. They took time to get to know us and make sure the party suited our tastes. You and all your guests will be talking about how wonderful these people are for days. Food: Amazing! I often wonder why a catered event can't serve top quality food.  Haven's Kitchen made me realize that all of the caterer's food I have previously eaten was just subpar. The food surprises and excites! The wines and cocktails are also fabulous. Decor: This place is bad ass. It feels chic and hip, but also inviting and cozy like you're at home. Check out photos on the internet.Price: For what it is, the price is reasonable. They do not nickel and dime you and they go out of their way to please. They provide you with a cool space, incredible service and amazing food. Nothing really high class is cheap in this city, and you get value for your money here.",7,,
40,Julian P.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,18,0,5.0,4/3/2014,"My husband and I had our wedding ceremony, reception, and dinner all in Haven's Kitchen second-floor space. (They also have a delightful café on the first floor, a spacious open kitchen for cooking classes, and a larger third-floor space for bigger events.)The space itself is beautiful - simple but elegant. They're happy to spice it up for those who want to add design elements, but we liked it as it was and only asked for a few minor changes. We loved the reclaimed wood tables and the exposed brick walls.Halle and the rest of the venue staff couldn't have been more helpful or gracious. They accommodated all of our requests, and asked the right questions to make sure nothing was left out. They put together a fabulous menu based on a conversation about our likes and dislikes, and helped us plan out a schedule for the evening that helped us all stay organized without making us feel like we were sticking to a hard plan.On the big day, they gave us full run of the space a couple hours early for pictures, accommodated last-minute changes and requests, and served up some of the most delicious food and cocktails that I've had in a long time.I can't recommend them highly enough. If you're planning a small wedding or some other kind of party or function, you won't go wrong with Haven's Kitchen.",5,,
41,Mary H.,"Manhattan, NY",43,10,0,2.0,1/10/2014,"It's a beautiful space, but don't book an event here.I booked our company's holiday party at HK. Despite making it very clear that we had vegan/vegetarian staff and needed a full dinner set up (and, moreover, having the staff agree to separate meat from vegetables and have areas for seating), the planners did the exact opposite of what was agreed on.What's worse is, when I expressed my frustration, they gave me an attitude about it and gave a measly $300 discount off of a party that cost thousands of dollars. Terrible attitudes and service.",7,,1

It's a nice place to stop off and have a chat with a friend for an office break. Curious about their cooking classes as well.",1,,
43,Asta S.,"Boston, MA",22,359,28,5.0,11/23/2014,"Came here for an event and EVERYTHING I tasted was amazing - the charcuterie included pate and terrine, somethign that looked like brie, but tasted myuch better, as well as something called D'Artagnan.

44,Sophia D.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,12/12/2013,"Cooking Class Review and Event ReviewHand's down, the best cooking class in NYC. Here is what you need to know.  The instructors are good. If you can, take a class led by Chef David Mawhinney. Look him up, this guy's got chops. He is the head chef at Haven's, and has experience working at some of the best restaurants in the city (i.e. Per Se). Even if you know a lot about food and cooking already, you will still learn from Chef Mawhinney. He is exceptional at making novice cooks comfortable, but also gives skilled cooks plenty to put in their pocket. He teaches advanced technique, and not just recipes. Classes are small, you drink wine, and you cook with premium ingredients: locally sourced, farm to table kind of stuff. Really this is less of a class and more like a super fun night out. One class I went to had 8 people in it, the other 10. The night starts with a little wine, and soon you get down to hands on cooking. When it is all done, you sit down at a lovely dining table and enjoy the fruits of your labor. It is a proper meal, at a proper table, with proper cutlery, and cloth napkins. I have taken two cooking classes here. The first was a Chinese dumplings class, and the second was a Thanksgiving turkey class. Both were amazing. We actually ate a whole Thanksgiving dinner with turkey, stuffing, cranberry, salad, and gravy. Since we all practiced trussing on our own individual chickens, we each had a whole roast chicken to take home with us, along with some other leftovers. Did I mention you cook with premium ingredients? That chicken was crazy good. I went by myself the first time and brought a friend the second time. Both experiences were great. It is a brilliant place to take a date. Gentleman, if you want to impress, take her here.  I found out about Haven's Kitchen because I went to a wedding reception that was held there. Some other Yelper on here is griping about the fact that he could not afford to have his wedding at Haven's, and he is trying to blame the venue for that. I can't afford to eat at Per Se, but I am not about to harangue Thomas Keller. All I know is the wedding that I went to was one of the best I have ever been to. The venue is far from boring: there are different levels with different moods and cool cocktail bar. The food was outstanding, and of high quality. The service was impeccable. It was a pretty worldly guest list, and no one left unimpressed.",3,1,

51,Julie K.,"West Islip, NY",0,5,0,4.0,7/1/2014,"Haven's Kitchen is one of my favorite ""hidden gems"" in NYC. The lunch specials are great for a quick lunch-on-the go although it can be a little pricey. The lunch special is $11 for a choice of 2 options (salad/soup/sandwich). The menu changes weekly and they always offer Meatless Mondays options. The menu is always in season and local - fresh grilled asparagus and hard boiled egg grilled cheese, chilled zucchini soup, heirloom Tomato, mozzarella, Basil Pesto, maldon salt sandwich, etc. SO good. While the savory foods are out of this world - the sea salt chocolate chip cookies are why I really frequent Haven's Kitchen. You have to try them!! The decor is so cute and such a great place to hang out - rustic with white subway tile. They have great cooking classes and options for groups too!",,,
52,Ethan F.,"New York, NY",0,51,0,2.0,2/23/2015,"I don't mind paying $11 for a sandwich although I do expect it to both taste good and fill me up. I  was here a few days ago and got the chicken sandwich with smoked gouda and jalapenos. It certainly sounded delicious. As I ate it, though, it became pretty apparent that there was likely no more than 1/2 ounce of chicken in the sandwich which is really just pathetic. I know that Haven's Kitchen markets itself as an upscale cafe with high quality food, etc but WTF? 1/2 ounce of chicken in an $11 chicken sandwich is just insulting. After finishing the ""sandwich"", I left Haven's Kitchen and had to find another place to eat lunch.",1,,1

What a delightful spot and because I was about to brave the BWS, got a smartly pulled espresso to give myself a mid-afternoon energy boost before heading into the depths of hell further up the street in search of a 'bargain.' Who know, maybe the espresso worked because I found an Armani black label sport coat for $150. Yes, it was a steal and this place is a treasure.",4,2,3

The course was three hours long and attracted an eclectic and fun group of people. We rapidly zipped through 7-8 baking basics such as pie crust, cream puff pastry, ganache, caramel, lemon curd, etc.  There were both demonstrations by the instructor, who was good, and ""hands on"".  Haven's Kitchen is a delightful setting, much better equipped than a lot of cooking class kitchens like ICE.  All in all, it was a really fun experience.  And at the end, we ate our home-made eclairs, cream puffs, and truffles at a french country farm house table.  And their mission is admirable--to educate people about tasty sustainable fare.  There are lots of other options available--someone in the class had been to Sangria and Tapas and liked it very much...",,,
