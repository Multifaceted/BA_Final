1,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",362,209,333,2.0,11/2/2018,"I so wish this place didn't upset my stomach.I think it was the onion rings, they are so soaked in oil that it tastes like you stuck your mouth in the fryer.The burger was just ok and I don't really care for the decor/vibes.It's been done before, and in a neighborhood like the LES, you need to rock something unique.Don't think I'll be back.2.4/5",,,
2,John B.,"New York, NY",296,42,142,5.0,9/14/2018,Made a last minute (5ish hours before dinner?) reservation through Yelp for my birthday and they were very accommodating.Restaurant was empty when we arrived but fairly busy by the time we left. It was a beautiful night so they had all the doors and windows open which was a nice addition to the atmosphere. Our waiter was wonderful and even though in a free birthday appetizer. He was funny as well! The food was great and I was really impressed with my Blue Cheese Chicken Sandwich.The beer menu was plentiful and the wait staff made sure we always had water. I'll definitely come back: food and service was great and it was so easy being able to use Yelp to make the reservation and redeem a Check-In offer.,,,
3,Allie B.,"New York, NY",303,224,205,3.0,8/7/2018,"I was craving a burger and thought to try Benson's. I didn't want a greasy,overcooked burger that you can get at shake shack. I was excited to try Benson's because they seemed to have a number of different options on the menu and somewhat healthy alternatives to a notoriously unhealthy meal. I ordered the classic burger with asparagus as my side instead of fries. the asparagus was good, cooked well and not too oily. The burger was okay. I was not impressed by it, in fact the waiter messed up how my boyfriend had ordered ours to be cooked and gave me the medium burger and my boyfriend the rare. This was a huge disappointment. The burger had some odd seasoning that made it taste too garlicky or onion-y. At 7pm on a Thursday we were the only two in the restaurant as well, which is a bit unsettling for a relatively known spot in LES. I would not suggest this place to someone who is craving a pure and juicy burger. This is good if you like a lot of flavor masking the taste of overcooked meat.",1,,
4,Sara N.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",140,33,49,5.0,5/23/2018,"So delicious! I love trying new veggie burgers, and theirs is like 80% lentil, 20% black beans. I don't want to put false information out there, but there was a spicy element to it, my guess is cumin, but who could know. My sister and I were just looking for a casual place to sit and eat, and we got there around lunchtime and the place was empty we wondered if they were even open! Don't let that fool you! NYC is sleeping on Benson's thats for sure! We both got veggie burgers and fries, and they were both delicious. The atmosphere was rustic and cozy, and had tons of local art on the wall, which we enjoyed. Our favorite part was our bartender, Annie ( I think) we caught her name at the end of our conversation and she is from Australian and so hilarious! She had an awesome presence. We will definitely go back!Benson's, you ARE Sara Approved!",2,,1
5,Katrina C.,"San Jose, CA",329,438,571,3.0,5/27/2018,"All the brunch places we wanted to try were 1.5 hr waits. We randomly came across Benson's, and luckily they had a brunch menu and could seat us right away. I didn't find Benson's to be particularly trendy or hipster. The vibe was more like a cute and quaint neighborhood bar/restaurant. Each person in my party ordered the Benson breakfast burger. I ordered mine with a side of fries. The Benson Burger was massive in part of the thick beef patty, which was super juicy and perfectly medium rare. The burger consisted of bacon, fried egg, tomato, lettuce, red onions, and beets. It was also supposed to come with pineapple salsa, but none of us tasted any hint of pineapple. The quality of ingredients were great, but It would've been nice to have the salsa since I thought the burger itself was overall bland. The side of sweet potato and regular steak fries were really good and tasted freshly made. The fries, which I got with my burger, were crunchy, crispy, and nicely salty.",1,,2
6,Elei Z.,"New York, NY",96,71,419,4.0,6/2/2018,"Came here on a Saturday brunch. Not very many people, which is great.  Friendly and attentive staff. Food's pretty good. I'm usually not a fan of thick cut bacon, but it's really good here. The acai bowl was delightfully smooth and well-blended and not overly icy or cold. Definitely could have used more toppings though. There are barely any toppings for a bowl that size. Few banana pieces and little sprinkle of blueberry and granola. I had to ask for some more granola (which I also got charged for).  Environment feels dirty. The water jug looked a little sketch, not sure how it was on the inside though. I tried adjusting the table because it was a little crooked, but there was sticky residue on the sides and under the table. This makes me question even how clean the tabletop is.",,,
7,Melissa T.,"New York, NY",107,110,104,4.0,5/20/2018,"I walk by Benson's almost every day from work and it's been on my burger list for quite some time. After a very rainy week, the husband and I stopped in on a nice summer-like day for a late lunch:brunch. Great beer selection and menu. Very casual, laid back, but music and ambiance.Burger was cooked to perfection and delicious hand cut fries. Friendly service and casual atmosphere. Next time I'd like to try their boozy brunch.",,,
8,Rob C.,"New York, NY",234,221,144,4.0,7/28/2018,"I came here with my girlfriend because we were craving burgers that weren't oily. It was pretty empty for a Thursday evening, but maybe people who enjoy burgers just tend to have meals later in the evening as more people eventually came in around 7 PM. The service was good, and the burgers come with a choice of fries or vegetables. I chose the fries which were quite large and filling while my girlfriend chose the vegetables. We both ordered the original burger which includes their house sauce made of mustard and horseradish. The burger itself was quite good with just the right consistency throughout. The environment was relaxing with indie rock music playing in the background which was nice. Overall, a decent place to grab a solid burger.",1,,
9,Jia L.,"New York, NY",240,71,125,4.0,3/15/2018,A great spot to catch up with a friend. I really like the atmosphere as it is dim and quiet so you can actually have a conversation with your friends here not like other overly crowded bars in NYC.The burger here is insanely huge and juicy so come hungry or share it with a friend. I had their classic burger medium rare with a side of salad because I was trying to balance the meal out. I'm not a fan of their  horseradish sauce that's just my personal preference.  My bf and I also order the stack of bacons and the bacons was super thick and delicious. We also pair the burger with ciders and it was a great.  Service was good as there is only one waitress that had to attend to us and the bar. Also check in for 10% off that's always a plus.,1,,
10,Sang C.,"New York, NY",64,109,301,4.0,2/25/2018,"Their portion on their burgers here at insane! A little hard to eat due to just fitting the burger in your mouth being difficult and the mess I made eating it. I really like the horseradish sauce and cooked onions in the original. My only critique is I thought the beef was a little bit over seasoned with pepper and salt but other than that all around solid burger. This place is more of a bar, very mellow and laid back. Quieter than your typical bar so it's a nice place to catch up with old friends. Place can fit 20-25 people so its not a big place. Burger runs $15/$16 each and with the portion size I would say its not bad bang for your buck. Bartender here is super friendly and the service was great.",2,,
11,Leslie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,186,247,5.0,2/22/2018,"Benson's has a wide range of beer and ciders with a full bar along with great tasting burgers! The bartender was very friendly. The burgers are pretty big. I ordered the classic burger. The caramelized onions add great flavor to the burger. All burgers are served on a cibatta roll which is a nice change from the usual hamburger bun. The onion rings and French fries (more like potato wedges) were really good. The sweet potato fries were just okay. I would come back here for the burger, onion rings, and fries! Overall, it was a great experience! *Yelp check in gets you 10% off!",1,,
12,Jose E.,"Bronx, NY",165,4,0,5.0,9/9/2018,"Fam. I haven't written a yelp review in years. Like I used to wear fedoras the last time I wrote a review. But I found this place on yelp cause my girl is on a burger quest tryna find the best burger in nyc. Family, this fucking place is so good, I literally am typing this review in the restaurant right after I ate my burger. Like right now, I'm legit ignoring my gf right now. Go here. It's fucking incredible oh my god",,8,
13,Jieun L.,"New York, NY",623,203,724,5.0,7/12/2018,"What a gem in the lower east side. Biggest plus about this bar is that the owners show face and work at the bar. Annie, I believe, served and hung out with us the entire time we were there, and also was attentive and present with other customers. We came for some burgers and flatbread. Burgers are served with sweet potato fries. Decent size burger and very well cooked. The prosciutto flatbread was a little salty but delicious. It's always fun to cut the flatbread ourselves and break the yolk on top. Something cool about the bar is the artwork around. The owners collaborate with various artists throughout the city and swap them out monthly. Gives local artists a chance to showcase their work and you can purchase them in the store. It's difficult to find a bar that gets over 4 stars consistently. There's a reason why here. Benson's both worth it and the owners are great. They'll remember you too.",,,
14,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,11/22/2017,"Sometimes it seems like such a production to just go to a good dinner in New York, but everything about Benson's screams 'easy' - in a good way. We were able to slide right in on a Friday night, order up some beers, ciders, and burgers, and have a low-key but tasty meal in a lively but not overcrowded spot.  The menu is simple but robust. There are lots of beers to choose from, and I appreciated their extensive cider selection, too. There are some non burger options on the menu for sure, but everyone in our party went with the Original burger, which comes with your choice of side. This allowed us to try out the fries, onion rings, and asparagus between our party of three without having to buy three full sides/apps to share. The onion rings were extremely heavily battered (could barely spot the onion under all that fried goodness), but overall everything was really tasty. The burgers were cooked right to our specifications and were hearty without being a gut bomb. The server was very friendly and fun, and though she did keep us waiting a while a couple of times, she acknowledged and apologized for it so all was good. The atmosphere, like the menu, is casual and - yes, that's right - easy. It's a small place with small tables but plenty of elbow room and not too loud to carry on a real conversation. A great place to have a burger and a beer (or cider) with friends!",8,2,5
15,Nemanja N.,"Quincy, MA",31,3,6,5.0,10/1/2018,A really cool spot in lower east side. Food was really tasty and portions are good. Service nice and friendly. I would recommend it!,,,
16,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4794,5.0,10/2/2017,"Every day it seems is a holiday. From ""Kiss your mom day"" to ""National Apple Pie Day"", every day is now turned into a fun day. I'm submitting ""Give all your dollars to Bill S"" day. Somehow stars aligned when I was on the Lower East Side for ""National Cheeseburger Day"". On meatless Monday no less?! Since its an official holiday, let me roll towards one of my Yelp bookmarks, Benson's NYC.Benson's NYC is a typical, smaller pub on the Lower East Side. If 30 people showed up, the place would be jammed. Lots of 4 & 5 star reviews from some of my Yelp friends. Bill T said the burgers looked like something you'd see on a food show?? Oh baby, let me belly up to the bar and get my burger on.I ordered ""The Classic Burger"" topped with grilled onion, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & house sauce. Look at the picture, perfecto! These guys are true burger lovers, from the bun to the short rib burger blend, my burger was top notch. The fries were also a hit, I am a total Benson's NYC fan for life. Now add 40+ available craft beers, Benson's NYC is a great place to kick back with your buddies for a burger & a beer.Now where the heck do I go for National Take Your Parents to Lunch Day?? I'm feelin' Benson's NYC, mom would want Le Cirque...",8,6,15
17,Annie L.,"New York, NY",282,129,15,3.0,8/10/2018,"Mehhh. Decent burger - unique in that they use ciabatta for the buns and the patty was done the way you ordered (medium for me!), but it was a bit too ""loose""/crumbly for me. I ordered the peppercorn burger, which comes with tomatoes, lettuce, a tasty sauce, and onion rings on top, and a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were well-crisped. Everything was fine; just wasn't particularly extraordinary. Came out to be about $18 pre-tip. Small space, friendly service.",1,,1
18,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,4.0,9/11/2017,"A few friends and I stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch after looking for places to eat in the area. As an appetizer, we settled for the garlic and cheese flatbread which turned out to be delicious. It was warm and cheesy and somewhat reminiscent of pizza. I'd definitely recommend the flat bread as a starter. I shared an order of onion rings with a friend and we both agreed that it was extremely greasy. There was even grease dripping through the wax paper. Also it was a bit batter heavy. For the entree, I settled for the lamb burger with a side of salad. All burgers come with the option of either fries or a salad, with the option of sweet potato fries for $1 extra. I had a hard time choosing between the lamb and benson burgers, but eventually went with lamb after reading some good reviews for it here on Yelp. My burger was juicy and delicious. One of the better burgers I've had in the Lower East Side. The bun they used had an interesting taste and texture (not sure what kind of bun it was.) Overall, I'd definitely recommend coming to Benson's for brunch. The food was amazing and the service here was impeccable.",5,,2
19,Melissa H.,"New York, NY",3,19,25,5.0,6/24/2018,"First thing, first!! The service is great!! And so kind! Our waiter was really attentive and had small, fun conversations with our party. One of my friends dish was messed up, but we got the mistake as a complimentary! One of the best service I have ever gotten anywhere. I ordered the mushroom garlic tomato flatbread and I thought it wouldn't be enough but I was full after two slices of it! (You can ask for a box to pack up your leftovers!) The cook of the crust was the best, it was crisp because of the thinness and had a crunch to the soft texture of the toppings. There are pieces of olives and garlic, so steer away if you don't like those! Also make sure you eat some gum to erase the garlic after breath. My order is vegetarian, and the place does have several options but you'll have to read the descriptions because they don't label which contain no meat. The flat breads were very light despite all the cheese, and felt healthy compared to a normal pizza. The onion rings (8$) and sweet potato fries ($7) were so good! I kind of miss the onion rings already... they were crunchy and soft but not mushy or soggy!Only tip: I recommend that you share the flatbreads but probably should've read the reviews before ordering. I would definitely come again. :)Highly recommend coming if you're craving a typical American meal!",4,,1
20,Nora R.,"Rocklin, CA",1,34,16,5.0,8/4/2018,"Amazing Cajun burger and flatbread! Highly recommend. Also a really cute place with great service. Annie was awesome! Not too busy on a rainy Saturday morning, and definitely a cozy place and great for lunch.",,,
21,M. M.,"Melville, NY",2,13,4,5.0,5/19/2018,"Came here with a reservation to try the brunch special ($28 for a breakfast entree and 3 select drinks OR $35 unlimited select drinks and breakfast entree) - we had an out of towner with us and boy, we were not disappointed. Benson's has funky, small and cozy decor, and a great beer selection and cider (no liquor). Between us we had the breakfast board, avocado smash, French toast - plus we ordered an extra side of thick cut bacon (we ordered crispy!). Oh and a poblano empanada. Everything was actually perfect, tasted fresh and wasn't bland. We also ordered mimosas as our select drink - also on point. It's one of those places where I ate everything and didn't have a simple complaint. The food was definitely worth a second visit, but what stood out to me was how nice the staff was, particularly the guy named Dave. A friend in the group was late (an hour) and the rest of us had to slowly take our time to order the actual meal (since we wanted to dine with the missing friend). Dave was super chill about it, didn't make us feel rushed or unwelcome (which is pretty common in some LES spots). It just made the whole situation a lot less stressful because of him. Cheers to you Dave - we will be back!",,,

Their burgers are super size and pizzas is perfect sharable portions or you can indulge the whole thing to yourself. MUST try their BBQ chicken pizza with asparagus. Hands down the best -- loved it so much. The sauce was perfect and the crust was not thick or overly thin, basically just right. A safe choice for anyone who dislikes carbs and thick crusts. Servers here are also super friendly and always checked in if we needed help or anything else. Will definitely come back!",1,,
24,Greg R.,"New York, NY",224,147,56,4.0,12/10/2017,"Pro's:  The burgers at this place are honestly some of the best I've ever had.  My friend and I split the BBQ and Peppercorn burgers and they were both incredible.  The Peppercorn was the winner, but you can't go wrong with either and they have a solid number of other burgers to choose from.  The beer menu was great and nicely organized.Con's:  I was really disappointed that they advertise a bunch of great beers on their website but when I got they said they didn't have all three of the one's I would want to try.  To be fair, they note that they rotate beers regularly so the menu online might change, but I think they should make a better attempt to keep it updated.  Also, the service is insanely slow, but it's a small place and I don't think they have many employees.Overall, definitely a cool place and will be back to try other burgers.",2,,

We then tried a few other places in the area but they either had long wait times, had changed restaurants, or were also closed. Disappointedly, we looked up brunch in the area and decided on this place - it was a little ways from where we were, but we were seated immediately once we got there. The restaurant is half high tops, half normal tables, and we chose a high top near the window. We ordered quickly, her the breakfast board and myself the breakfast burger with fries. Our food actually took longer than I was expecting (~30 minutes? I finished my water and she finished both her water and OJ), which was slightly disappointing. But, the food was really pretty and rather good, too. Her breakfast board looked very interesting, with black beans, eggs, bacon all deconstructed but all served on a wooden cutting board/plate. My breakfast burger was almost as big as my head, and was served with a fat chunk of beet - I'm not a fan of beets and still am not, but it's a pretty pink color and stained my eggs pink too! the fires were good, albeit very greasy. Not sure I'll be back, but we enjoyed our catch up time here and didn't feel rushed at all. They have a small coat rack in the front too, which was convenient.",1,1,1

After wandering around and refusing to wait an eternity, we decided to give Benson's a try because there was no wait. The place was actually empty when we walked in. Our hostess was a total sweetheart so we decided to take a leap of faith and stayed here for dinner. Most of my friends ordered burgers and they all loved it. I ordered the sausage and sun dried tomato flat bread, which came out more like a thin crust pizza than a flatbread. They sure did not skimp out on the cheese though. There was so much cheese on my flatbread that I had to eat it with a fork. Literally the cheesiest flatbread I've ever had. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Benson's. It's a super relaxed place to grab food/drinks and catch up with friends. They also have a decent selection of beer too.",,1,1

Made reservations for brunch in advanced for 11 people via Yelp and got a response within an hour.One of the owners (and our server) Dave was really funny and accomodating from table setup, making fresh brew iced tea upon request, checking in on the group and the funny jokes (gave the birthday girl the check 'cuz we said last one here pays the bill...and she showed up last - no, we didn't make her pay...but it sure was funny)!!  We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. You cannot go wrong with anything you selected from the brunch or regular menu...your sandwich or burger comes with salad, fries or onion rings. Sweet potato fries were delicious! Brekky Sandwich, Rosemary chicken bowl, Benson burger, Peppercorn burger, etc.For the drinkers $28 is really good for brunch and 3 drinks (as long as you can walk a straight line afterwards). Can definitely drink 2...Really tempted if I didn't have to walk around too much after...definitely next time :)Thanks so much Dave for the great service, being accomodating and making us laugh!

Note that they don't serve hard liquor, and the Bloody Sake Mary is now off the menu due to lack of demand.The atmosphere and food were great. I regret not getting one of their signature burgers because my friends raved about them during and post-consumption.

I wasn't disappointed, and I'm sure because I live nearby I'll be going again. My boyfriend got a peppercorn burger and fries. I think he liked the burger enough! No complaints. The fries apparently weren't too good, though. He said they were too salty. Personally, I thought they just weren't cooked evenly. Some bites were way overcooked because they were saturated in grease, thicker bites were just a bit too underdone. I'm gluten-free, so I got a classic burger without the bun, and I opted for the salad. The side salad may have actually been the best part of the meal, not that the burger was bad or anything - the salad was just well dressed and fresh. My burger was good, juicy, and cooked exactly how I requested. However, it was kinda JUST a burger. Nothing too special, but no complaints whatsoever. The beer selection was also great! They had local rotations and a wide selection of ciders. I suggest dropping by!",,,

So good as much as it was a struggle to eat (because it was bigger than my mouth) it was so worth the mess and time it took to eat it. I was also pleased with their sweet potato fries that were such a yummy compliment to my burger.If you love beer this is the place to go because they have a great selection to choose from.

OK Cozied up may be the wrong expression, but I do lament not sitting at this bar more often, knocking back a few choice brews with the amazingness that is a Benson burger. Ugh that burger. If you've never had the pleasure, and at ALL like a prime cut of beef ground and grilled into perfection then make your way over here. Seriously go. now. why are you still here...OK ok back to the review. The space itself is nicely put together, especially those enormous front windows (the light pours in), but lets be honest, I'm not looking for luxury lighting when i'm down here, I am looking for beer....lots and lots of beer, and man do these guys deliver (Aussie aussie aussie, oy oy oy). The list here really is expertly put together, and you absolutely can, and should find a few australian beers (place is an Aussie bar if you didn't know).

Benson's NYC does not serve any cocktails, just ales and wines. I ordered the peppercorn burger with a side salad and the house special: sweet chili wings 6/$10. I really enjoyed my meal and it was very satisfying. The wings needed more seasoning on the meat itself, so a marinade would've really made them more decadent. But overall they were good for the price. The peppercorn burger didn't really sound special from the menu, so I added bacon and avocado to jazz it up. Overall, it was good but wished i order something more true to the menu description. However, for $18 with a side it was very filling and worth an honorable mention. Lastly, the onion rings are BOMB!!! Like not the soggy run of the mill rings served in other  places. They are really good and I would recommend them over the fries. I like dipping them in the house horseradish sauce for added spice.",,1,

Annie and Dave are super welcoming, have a great knowledge of beer, and really are fun to chat with...their genuine love of sharing Benson's with newcomers and regulars is evident in every inch of the bar and their contagious good moods will elevate even the most trying of work days.Benson's is an Aussie bar--a neighborhood bar with charm and a a relaxed vibe. drops mic, so can chomp down on this Benson Burger with no interruptions.i out.zzz",28,25,27

It's got the wood tables and local art show and the craft beer list and burgers, but it's just not very good at it. It's lacking heart and soul and the caring that results in noticing the details of how things are working. Here are a couple things: have a lager on tap. I know IPA are the rage but I'll bet that 90% of people like lagers, including me. Next, if you ask a customer's name, ask because you care what it is, not because you're trying to open a tab because that's what it says in the training manual. Third, if you're training a new bartender it's best not to train them pouring their first beer ever right in front of you and having them spill the whole thing because it's all head. It just doesn't look professional. I'm paying for a basic level of experience here. Lastly, the burger was hands down the saltiest I've ever had. I was starving so I ate it, but it was a travesty. The potato wedges were great. Somebody other than the chef needs to taste for seasoning standards.Overall, this place seems to have local support, but in broader terms it needs to step up its game to get above average marks.",3,,

Good portion, flavor and price so no complaint here. The service was great as well, with the burger coming out hot and at a timely manner.  The bar keep was friendly and good company (I was the only person there the whole time). She (and I assume the others) seem to actually care about the customers so that's a plus.The soufflé was barley warm, and mostly liquid. I'm still not sure if it was due to too much chocolate filling or it was actually under cooked. Either way, wasn't great. The bar keep noted this and gave it to me for free so I can't really complain, again, good service. Would come back here for food. This place seems like a great spot for a group of friend to go to and have a good time in.Can't say 5/5 because I haven't seen it alive, the way you'd expect a bar to be. 4/5 for being empty, but I think the next review might bump it up.",1,,1

55,Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",109,702,905,2.0,6/25/2016,"Except for the sweet and friendly hostess/waitress, nothing about this place was particularly memorable or enjoyable. With all the raving reviews, I definitely expected a much better experience. I don't think anyone did anything bad, but personally, it's not my type of establishment. So I can't say I would come back. During a late lunch, around 3-4PM, there were tons of trucks roaring down the street. I don't mind traffic, considering this is NYC and it would be hard to dine somewhere remote and free of cars/people, but this was very frequent, loud, jarring, and disruptive. It was made worse with the open window. This place really wears the ""dive bar"" establishment. Small, not a lot of seating -- maybe enough for 6 parties-- and annoyingly wobbly stool chairs, I can't imagine what it's like during dinner time or prime-time brunch hours. Food was good -- delicious, fresh fries that didn't seem frozen and then fried. Kudos to that. Large, soft, toasted Ciabatta roll/bun. I like that, it's different and a lot heartier and sturdier for their thick patties. I should have gotten mine medium, instead of medium rare, because some sections of the center were completely rare, as in pink ground beef that you get from a supermarket. But it was minimal and I easily ate around it. I got the BBQ burger, and they didn't slather a ton of sauce on it, so the beef was really able to shine through. Not overly salty, and I thought it was a solid burger. A side of onion rings were slightly disappointing. Again, I had a vision of thick cut, hearty breaded/fried onions rings. These were well fried, crispy, but sliced thinly, so at times it felt I was crunching on fried batter. Just scarfing down chunks of deep fried fatness. Not for me. Again, service was attentive, wish I got the woman's name. Food took awhile to be cooked, but patties were thick and I think it's very fresh and made to order. So in that case it's worth the wait. Did find it amusing that the kitchen was underground, so it was always interesting to see a guy pop up from the ground with plates of food.",1,1,1

My husband ordered the ranch burger with sweet potato fries, which he quite liked. I ordered the peri peri burger, but substituted the chicken patty for the black bean veggie patty, and onion rings. I realize the substitution changes the burger quite a bit, so I can understand that it may not taste quite as good, and sure enough my burger was just fine. I appreciated the vegetarian option, but it didn't quite translate. Also, the onion rings were just fine as well, a little too oily.Overall, a solid burger spot.

Our server sat next to us and playfully joked around while not being too intrusive. They had hip hop hits of the 2000s playing on the radio. They have a ton of beer to choose from and the menus are on clipboards. You really can't go wrong.The only gripe I really have is the burgers (or everything?) come out on a wooden slab, which I guess is cool for the theme, but isn't practical. Things got messy and a wood block doesn't do anything to keep that from happening. Meh.I would return for beer and a chill time though.

61,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,3.0,1/12/2017,"I really wanted to like Benson's. The service / employees were incredible and so down to earth. Unfortunately, the food was a different story. Let me first start with the good - the free bacon that comes via your Yelp check in. Just do it. You get a whole freaking platter of bacon (8 large strips), which tastes like Peter Luger's thick cut bacon, but without all that fat; Benson's bacon is a lot thinner too, but the saltiness was still there. Legit the perfect amount of salt and crispness achieved from the perfect amount of frying time. This definitely isn't your standard bacon as it came to the table fresh and piping hot. Seriously, it took awhile to arrive, but we didn't think it was going to be that hot...until we dug in and burned our fingers and mouths a bit. Then my Benson burger with sweet potato fries and my friend's pineapple bacon cheddar flatbread pizza and onion rings arrived. Portions are massive. But that's all it was - large in size, lacking in taste. Where was the pineapple salsa and jalapeño salsa on my burger? However, I think the biggest sin was that my burger was super soggy and legitimately just fell apart from the moment I held it up - it was so devastating to try to eat, especially when the beef was so bland. I ultimately couldn't finish it. The sweet potato fries were okay, they lacked seasoning. I also stole a slice of my friend's flatbread pizza - it tasted like there was too much artificial cheese, kind of like those frozen pizzas you heat up in your oven. Like the sweet potato fries, his onion rings were also bland, plus a whole layer of grease. Kudos to the service though - by far some of the nicest employees I've encountered!",3,,

Like, it was so difficult eating it cause it was drippy, there was way too much in the burger, etc. But all that aside, it was also just an okay burger. It really should have been seasoned better cause the meat itself was very bland and there were no sauces or flavors, so it was really relying on the egg, beet, and LTO to make the burger taste better. I wasn't a huge fan. My other friend had the avocado smash and she loved it.Service was great. Our waiter was really funny and attentive. Food came out quickly.

It was pretty empty with the exception of people drinking and more people came in later on throughout the night. I ordered the benson burger with sweet potato fries and a bacon, pineapple, and cheddar flatbread pizza to share with my friends.The burger was amazing and totally worth the $16 that I paid for it. The meat patty was thick and juicy, definitely worth the money. The bun was crispy and crunchy, although a bit soggy at the bottom from the meat patty. The pineapple and bacon definitely added nice touches to the burger too. The only thing I didn't like was that my order was a bit wrong, I ordered the meat to be cooked medium, but it was medium rare nearing raw. I also did not want the beets included. The sweet potato fries were super good as well. The portion of the side is just right to eat alongside the burger. The fries weren't crunch and crispy, but still good. Since we all shared our sides, we tried the onion rings as well. The onion rings weren't as crispy as we'd like. They were a bit spicy and soggy. But, it was still addictive. The pizza, in my opinion, tasted better than the burger. My friends and I ordered a second one to share since it was so good. The pizza was crunchy and the toppings melded together so well. At times, we were being rushed to order quickly when there wasn't anyone waiting for a table, which made us feel a bit disappointed.

The restaurant is a quaint square just south of Houston on Essex. The exposed brick, wood floors, funky art, and the wood tables and stools give the place a very homey feel. The beers on tap represent a good cross section of types and locations. But the bottle and can menu shows amazing depth. And both Annie and Dave can give you the lowdown on everything they sell. The food menu is relatively small, but it hit high notes on everything we tried. The dips and bread were fantastic (and the beer cheese that was subbed for the eggplant was excellent). But the burgers were the star.Whatever you do, have your burger southern Australian style and get ""The Benson.""  The bacon, egg, beets, pineapple and jalapeño salsa work perfectly together. (I'm told that northern Aussies like a little cucumber on their burger, but that's another story...). But be prepared for a mess as this is one juicy burger. I'll be back the next time I'm in town.

Both were delicious! I'm not a big beer fan but all the boys were happy with what they ordered. There's something for everyone.,,,
80,Steve R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,5.0,3/12/2018,"Benson's is a great spot to pop in for a beer (or 5) when I find myself in Manhattan on the weekend or perfect to meet up with friends for a drink before going home on a weeknight. I have been a few times and the place always has a friendly vibe to it which is nice when a lot of bars have become stuffy or pretentious. The staff is great and a few of the times I have been there, Annie (who I later learned was the owner) was behind the bar quick to recommend a great beer or cider including some great Australian beers. Spot on burger as well. This place is worth a quick escape from the Manhattan rush to relax and enjoy a beer, burger and great conversation.",,,

It was the bun and the meat that made it. TBH tho, those fries WOW, Can't go wrong (get BBQ sauce on side). But let me say: the best part about this is the chef, he's incredible, he's award winning and he's invested in creating great bar food. We even got a whole basket of bacon (like wow) whew. This place top 3 goat in the area. Whew. The owner Dave, he's a great guy, he works every evening, this man doesn't take time off, he's Australian and he cares about giving the best service and beer selection. Wow I'd come by here again, definitely.",,,

84,Pelin C.,"New York, NY",20,121,88,5.0,10/12/2017,One of the best burgers I have ever had was at Benson's. It is a quite small restaurant and the bartender is also the server which is not a problem at all. The burgers take a while to be ready but once they are in your table it is a magical experience that makes you forget about all the wait. The burgers are quite big and hard to fit in a mouth but the meat tastes like heaven. I highly recommend Bensons!,1,,
85,Lizz T.,"Washington, DC",42,30,2,5.0,6/13/2016,"Possibly the best burger I have ever had.I came here on a trip to NY because we heard it was one of the best burgers in the city. I was definitely not disappointed. The place is small- only a few tables plus bar seating, but the food is incredible.I ordered the special- a BBQ burger with grilled onions and bacon (it came with cheese but I ordered it without). It was incredible. The BBQ sauce was a little spicy, which was unexpected but amazing.Bf ordered the Benson burger, which comes with an egg and beets and jalapeño pineapple salsa. I tried a bite, and it was delicious. The odd combination definitely worked! The owner of the place was our server, which I thought was great. He was friendly and welcoming. I absolutely want to go back.",2,1,1

Updated review","We've been back here at least four more times, and we love it every time. The service is always so warm and friendly, and now they take online reservations?! Yall need to get on that!!Since our first visit, we've tried the sweetened nuts (like praline nuts, but honestly, the Nuts2nuts cart is better), and the kale dip with assorted breads (would be better warm, but the breads are fun).The pineapple and pancetta flatbread is crispy, light and delicious - it reminded me of the rectangle pizza I used to get in grade school with the cubed pepperoni, but far tastier. The boy adores the peppercorn burger, but my heart remains with the Benson burger. Beets + beef = life.It's a shame not more people seem to know about the churro ice cream sandwich, which has swirls of fried cinnamon sugared disks with vanilla ice cream and honey drizzle. Somehow light (least it felt that way because we inhaled it), and oh so satisfying!Benson, we love you. Will be back soon!",32,24,31
87,Zach W.,"Baltimore, MD",40,162,251,4.0,5/24/2016,"If you're not from Austria, maybe you think that Australian food is all ""shrimp on the Barbie"", as the documentary Dumb and Dumber illustrated. But it turns out that Australians, like their former-British-colonial cousins here in America, enjoy an excellent burger now and then, although they do (adorably) call them ""sliders"", because the ""eye"" sound is easy to make with an Austrian accent. Fact checks: sliders and burgers, like Australia and Austria, are not the same thing.On to the rest! The beer is good, the fries are good, the bacon is GREAT, and the bartenders/owners are cool. The place is also decorated like a museum sneezed, which is always a positive.",2,1,1
88,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,4.0,10/12/2017,"Great burger place, the benson is one of my favorite burgers and always hits the spot. I'm really happy that they're available for delivery on some apps so I can get it more frequently. The price is a bit higher than most burger places but worth the price.",,,
89,Amjed O.,"New York, NY",535,26,1,5.0,7/13/2016,"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the many others who visited this wonderful getaway? I walked in and was greeted by Annie who is very kind and genuine. I grabbed one of the beers on draft and had a conversation with her as I decided what I wanted to eat. For lunch, I had the Benson Burger which was cooked to my liking. The pineapples were an excellent touch and made the burger that much juicier and when paired with the sweet potato fries, it was a meal that blew me out of the water. In terms of atmosphere, this place is very clean and has really chill music playing in the background. It's definitely somewhere you can go to get away during the day. I'll definitely be back even if it's for a drink of the wide selection of beers available!",,,1
90,Darwin G.,"New York, NY",277,966,67,3.0,6/26/2016,"We obviously went with a burger, the peppercorn burger with onion rings.The burger is towering. I like the crusty, ciabatta style bun, but a bit bready in relation to the burger. The peppercorn slightly dominated the flavor of the tasty beef burger. The onion rings were greasy and overly bready. The thick cut fries on the other hand, that my friend ordered, were way better.In general a messy burger. Decent for the price.Service was attentive and fantastic.",,,1
91,Harvey G.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/26/2017,Lousy service. Took 40 minutes to get two hamburgers. We walked out. The waitress was nice but it looked like she was taking the order and cooking it in the kitchen also. She never apologized for taking so long. Ambience is nothing to speak of either. Stools instead of chairs with backs. Set up more as a bar rather then a restaurant.,,,
92,Kristin M.,"Kennett, MO",106,48,205,5.0,3/23/2017,"Anna was precious and so very personable.  She gave wonderful suggestions for beverage choices and food selections.  We had the bacon snack, cheese plate, chicken sandwich and three different hamburgers that were huge and delicious! Small place which we loved since it made it more personable.",,,
93,Ali R.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",26,23,2,5.0,1/30/2017,"I planned a 20-person birthday brunch (did not expect that number, I guess I ostracized fewer people than I thought in my 31 years LOL) at Benson's and could not be happier with how it turned out. I contacted a ton of places, but Annie, one of the owners, got back to me right away and was really accommodating. Her response was really personal, which made me want to do the brunch with Benson's and not the other places that eventually got back to me.We did a 1.5 hour prix fixe with bottomless mimosas/champagne/pilsner and then decided to extend to another half hour since we were having so much fun. Annie and team kept coming around with pitchers and serving us drinks and bacon. The food was delicious - I like that the menu wasn't too large yet ran the gamut from healthy grain bowl to a delicious bacon burger (of course that's what I got!)The place is cozy and intimate, located right between LES and East Village so sets you up nicely if you want to head to other bars after. We were allowed to take up 3 tables and were able to stand up and socialize with folks that may have been sitting at another table. The art inside was really cool too- my friend bought a funny Seinfeld sticker and I can't believe he didn't give it to me for my bday :P I had the best time and would definitely come back for a meal or a drink again. Thanks Annie!",2,,1
94,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,4/3/2016,"Cool new bar with friendly staff and comforting food. Heard this place can get packed, so stopped by around opening time on a Saturday morning to try a burger and a beer.More limited options for brunch (ugh), though they had what I wanted. Medium rare Benson Burger ($16) and a beer ($8). Burger is intimidating - a hefty patty dripping with pineapple salsa, topped with bacon and an egg. Each bite is juicier then the last, unfortunately almost all the salsa poured out after my second bite. The bread is hearty and kept the other ingredients in place for the most part. The meal comes with thick cut steak fries that are crisp and fresh.Loved the meal and the service is excellent. Tons of beers on bottle/can, but they were out of the first three things I tried to order. A nice kickback place that I'd like to try later in the night after brunch.",2,,1

96,Eleni D.,"San Diego, CA",53,24,2,5.0,8/19/2017,"Had a great dinner here and enjoyed the environment. Small and intimate enough without being a hole in the wall. I had the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was good except me personally, am not a fan of the ciabatta bread or whatever was used. I like typical round buns that are super soft. This bread had great taste and I would eat it separately but it didn't match 100% for me...a bit too chewy. Meat and toppings were on point. Fries were addicting. Five stars still for me, though. Top it off with friendly service where they call you by name and you have a returning customer.",1,,
97,Jacky C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",144,270,122,5.0,2/8/2016,"I wanted to find something on Yelp that had the perfect 5 stars and I stumbled upon this place. I was like, okay, I'm going to have to come here. I came here with my buddy on Super Bowl Sunday.I have to admit, this place was smaller than I expected. But the atmosphere was great. The wooden decor is pretty cool with semi dim lighting. The kitchen was something I wondered where it was for the longest time ever and apparently there are stairs to a basement level, so I hope I saved some of your brain cells from thinking too hard.This place has quite the beer menu. I like my dark beers and was recommended something called the Baba Dark Lager. Tasted pretty darn well. Will have to come back to try all the other beers they offer.I got the Benson Burger with fries. The presentation of the burger is phenomenal. If you get the salad instead of fries, your burger would be served on a plate. For fries, the fries are served in a basket on a wooden board with the burger. Just a fair warning, you are going to make a mess no matter what, but worth every drop.The waitress/bartender at the time was Ann as she introduced herself. Definitely one of the most active server and most helpful in deciding what to get.To sum it up, yes this place deserves those 5 stars and lives up to the hype. I can't wait to come back.",9,2,3

99,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",289,742,387,2.0,3/7/2016,"It was OK but to me it didn't live up to the hype of an almost perfect score on Yelp.  The place is tiny so you are cramped especially if the bar is crowded, the front door opens directly into the cold street, and the was barely anyplace to hang our coats so we wound up sitting on them.  My medium rare burger was undercooked.  My daughter's breakfast sandwich seemed to be a better choice.  At $4 for a cup of nothing special coffee and the server never asked if we wanted a refill, added to my disappointment.My sense is that it is the bar scene and not the food that is the attraction here.  Even at 1PM on a Saturday the bar was very crowded.",1,3,
100,Anthony C.,"Bronx, NY",19,58,15,4.0,5/3/2016,"This review will be in 2 parts. First the establishment and then why i ended up in this establishment. First benson's is a nice hole in the wall bar, Dave and Annie have a little gem on their hands. It is not the biggest place but the way the table is situated in the middle you can easily navigate around the place without bumping into someone seated at the bar. If the sliders and bacon where any indication of the food they sell i recommend everyone visit this place lol. Im not big on beer but the six point with a little sour taste was not half bad. My only issue would have been space. For such a nice place you would hate to be there when it is ridiculously crowded. Now the 2nd part is this was my first yelp elite event. I love the whole were a name tag so instead of saying im sorry what is your name its right there out in the open. I cannot wait for the next even.",,,2

102,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",829,475,125,5.0,3/15/2016,"Sometimes you find a place for the place, not just the food. Hankering for a late night bite in the LES on a Monday night I stumbled upon Benson's due to the beautiful juicy burger that awaited. It was windy and freezing outside and nothing sounded better. Alas, the kitchen had closed for burgers by the time I stumbled in like an idiot that wasn't wearing enough in the NYC night.It was then there was a small group of misfits watching ball and laughing about and another sole traveler like myself at the bar. It was where I met Annie. She could see the eyes of hunger or more likely my growling stomach behind my shivering mess, but it was then that she suggested the only remaining food items on the menu and the plethora of liquid diets that her esteemed keep possessed.I scarfed down the assortment of bread with a lovely miso pesto sauce that tasted amazing and felt remarkably healthy. Then the liquid diet. Oh the beers! I only have two pint this night over conversation with Annie, but to describe it as pleasant would be a disservice. Thank you for the amazing suggestions and accompaniment as I then proceeded to waddle back out of your establishment.On a better night, I will most certainly come back, because it is businesses like these amongst the hoards around it that make me want to return and definitely try that burger amongst my first NYC Yelp establishment friend.Cheers!",1,,1

Updated review","I found myself back in the area on a gorgeous Autumn day and decided I had to come back to Benson's. Doors were open and a pleasant breeze was flowing through. But I can't reward them on this amazing weather.It was quiet inside for lunch but that's perfect for me. I decided on trying a new burger this time and opted for the Blue Cheese Burger. Whatever the chef is doing to these burgers, he's doing it right. It's so flavorful! my server suggested the IPA from Other Half that they had just tapped and it might be one of my favorites that I've had. Good choice!Well done Benson's, you've got a fan in me! now excuse me while I finish my fries (fresh af) and get another IPA",,,

We had the kale salad that was very tasty and split a blue cheese burger and fries. The burger was cooked medium rare just like we requested and had some interesting spices that went well with the blue cheese. The burger meet is a short rib grind that she marinated so they are incredibly juicy.  The fries were amazing. They seem to be very similar to Thomas Keller's fries that he cooks three ways. The ""skin""on the fries was crispy and and cracked. Can't describe it well here so you will have to try it. Hint.

All of the individual ingredients were good on their own, but stacked together, it's a burger that's tasty, unique, and enormous. The bacon was thick and cooked just right; the lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh; the beet made me happy; and the burger patty itself was juicy, thick, and delicious. I was hesitant about ordering a $16 burger, but when you get it as the brunch special ($24 with fries and three drinks) it's a great deal. After having had it though, it's worth the $16.",4,,

Benson's is centrally located (for a group that lives in both Brooklyn and Manhattan), has an excellent selection of ever-rotating draft beer, 40+ interesting bottle selections, and at least four different kinds of burgers (of which I enjoyed the namesake, Aussie-style version). All of this was served efficiently and pleasantly by an over-worked bartender in this tiny room. Bonus points for the homeless man who came by three separate times to chat with us in the window, raising his Coors Light pounder to toast the beautiful evening while traumatizing my friend who doesn't live in NYC and thinks I hang out with that guy on the regular.All in all, Benson's is a good place to drink some craft beer, and maybe eat some things.",13,18,7

Benson's Burgers are inventive in flavors, and stacked so beautifully you almost don't want to wreck the works of art that they truly are -- almost, that is. If you're a fan of lamb, don't leave here without trying their lamb burger, which combines all the best tastes of mediterranean fare with everything that's to be loved about having yourself an all American burger. If beer is your drink of choice, you won't get bored with the laundry list of drafts and bottles of all different makes that are on the menu.

Our server tried making odd jokes, wasn't educated about the menu (you should know what you're serving) and kept dropping items on the floor. The server must have had a five minute conversation with my friend about adding an egg to his burger and when the burger came out - there was no egg! He had to come back with an egg on the side.

The bartender/waitress was very friendly and also very attentive. They have a very long and interesting list of drafts and bottles along with food! I ordered a Belgian IPA and it was delicious. My friend ordered a raspberry beer and she enjoyed it as well. For the food part, we had a side of thick cut bacon and a garlic Herb and goat cheese flat bread. It was really good ( just a tad bit smaller than we both thought it would be). Overall I enjoyed my stay at  Benson's and would probably come back again to try their burgers and more beer!",2,1,1
127,Emily L.,"San Francisco, CA",91,14,0,5.0,6/21/2017,"Benson's is a great place for a good draft and a delicious burger.

Will definitely be coming back here again!",,,

My husband loved the beer selection with some great options he had not seen anywhere else!Had an awesome vibe with plenty of regulars giving it a great neighborhood feel.

My friend and I came here early on a Tuesday and there was barely anyone here, which was great. The servers were super friendly and attentive, although food did take a while. The burger tasted delicious and the salad was also very fresh and interesting. The only downside was that my friend complained about the difficulty in eating the burger with his hands. Even so, I definitely enjoyed my evening at Benson's and I will definitely be visiting again soon!",2,1,2
130,Anna W.,"New York, NY",8,55,23,5.0,6/24/2016,"Annie, you are the epitome of Goddess perfection. Thank you for always being so kind to patrons like Jen and me. There's definitely something in the atmosphere that makes self-loathing a little less prominent my nights at this quaint little Lower East Side wine/beer/cider bar. Recommendations are always welcome, and they've done a great job every time. I think the beauty of a place that doesn't serve hard liquor is that you get a chance to enjoy the company that you're with, and celebrate in the essence of old-fashioned conversation with strangers. Also, bartenders give GREAT advice on whether or not to swipe right for boys on Tinder.P.S I know the staff and owners are stand-up people because this one time I asked them to refrigerate my bottle of chocolate milk and it was still there the next day.P.P.S Jen claims she's not drinking anymore but we'll probably see you later",1,,1
131,Adam G.,"Washington, DC",68,149,22,5.0,6/12/2016,"Went here this past saturday. Visting from dc. I was looking for a unique laid back place and had heard of the great reviews for this place. It did not disappoint. Located lower east side. Very unassuming place. Nice sign but small interior that doesnt stand out. Suprised by how small it is and especially the bathroom size. Nice bar and casual seating. Not a huge selection of beers but a great selection. Varied and all good choices. Good craft beer scene. Came for brunch. Had heard about the burgers so opted for those. Burgers run 15 plus here, not the most expensive but not cheap either but worth it. Came with side. I got the fries, which were like wedges. Very crispy and salted well. For brunch they have a deal with entree and three drinks which is very reasonable. Burger was the star. I got the benson. Its quite a combo of flavors. Beet, fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno pineapple salsa. Wow. Im not a huge fan of beets, but perfect here. The other star is the bacon. Thick cut and delicious, as well as the bread. Believe it was ciabatta. Thick and perfect for a burger. The beef was well seasoned and large. I ordered medium closer to medium well but it was still juicy. The egg was over medium, i prefer over easy but really these are small issues. The couldnt really taste the salsa, but The burger was so flavorful and balanced. It was one of the best ive had. Gf got the bbq bacon special and it was also excellent. The service is fast and friendly. Seek out Benson's.",1,,1

I initially chose this spot to eat because they had baconnnnnn, but I'm glad the rest of the food was yummy too! I had the lamb burger which was seasoned well and had delicious thick cut potato wedges, while my friends ordered three different flatbread pizzas to share.

Service was excellent by whom I assume we're the owners. I had the Brekky Sandwich with salad (BLT w/ avocado and egg) which was delicious. Sweet potatoes fries and onion rings were just as good. Will come back to try their burgers. Oh, and if you want ice tea and can wait a few minutes...they'll brew a fresh pitcher for you.",,,

It is a small place too, so I imagined it crowded. A few more trickled in by the time I left but I did expect and hope for a more lively vibe during dinner.",,,

142,Robert C.,"Manhattan, NY",124,2,0,5.0,4/28/2016,"Benson's will be celebrating it's first birthday this weekend and I will be in attendance. If bars were children, this would be my favorite child, and I'd cradle it to sleep singing it lullabies. Annie and Dave are amazing, beautiful, attentive owners and if I could date them both as a package-deal I would. I'd marry them. They're the best. Just genuinely nice, friendly people who I am lucky enough to call friends.Honestly I didn't touch the food until probably my 10th or 15th visit - Benson's was primarily a drinking venue for me at first. Now I rarely go without eating. I'd argue that this place is now (and probably was from the get-go) destination worthy as a burger venue and compares favorably against any ~$15 burger in the city. I've sent multiple burger-loving friends here who agree. The beer selection is great and they continually rotate the drafts so there is always something new to try.Give Benson's a go - it's a perfect neighborhood bar..",,3,
143,Galen R.,"Manhattan, NY",413,147,167,4.0,3/22/2016,"Went here one day for brunch with friends based on the epic reviews found here and elsewhere on the internets. We arrived early so it took us a minute to be seated which was find by us. Despite being St. Patrick's Day weekend the bar was pretty chill (guess the Aussies don't turn up for St. Paddy's like we do) and we were soon seated. Our bartender was friendly and kept flirting with one of my friends (she didn't seem to mind) but my other female friend said she couldn't even detect his accent. Not wanting to destroy a piece of his soul, I refrained from telling him this (everyone knows that's foreign guys' pickup game bread n butter, Stateside). Foodwise, I went with the joint's namesake burger and wasn't disappointed although the bread made it somewhat unwieldy. The brunch deal we chose (a meal plus 3 drinks for $25) was phenomenal and we even ended up with a free serving of sweet potato fries for the table (our waiter was thirsting).All in all, Benson's won't blow your socks off but has very tasty food, a great atmosphere, and even better deals.Go here.",1,1,

Next, we split the sausage flat bread, and it was crisp and delicious. Finally, we ordered burgers. They came out cooked as specified ( medium and medium rare) and they were incredibly juicy and well seasoned. The fries and onion rings were delicious as well.Our bartender Annie was friendly, polite and warm. The ONLY reason this is not a 5 star review is because they didn't have the air on and it was over 90 degrees out. By the time we finished eating we needed to leave Bc we were uncomfortable. The beer selection was decent and the prices were reasonable. We will be back- just when they have the AC on.",,,

I got the the lunch special and had the pineapple, bacon and cheddar flatbread pizza and a draft beer, my girlfriend got a BBQ burger and both meals were great. My pizza toppings were a bit more burnt than what I'm comfortable with on a pizza but hey... it's pizza and it was quite tasty so no real complaints there. I got a few bites of my girlfriend's burger and the patty seasoned and cooked well. Not to mention, the sheer size of the burger was great too. The real hidden star at this place was their bacon. We checked in through Yelp and were given a free bacon appetizer, and that bacon was bomb~ very good, great texture and not insanely salty. The bacon was in the rest of the food we ordered and we were very pleased with the overall taste and value for our meal. David was also a cool guy, he waited on our table did what I wanted from a person waiting tables to do; to check up on how the food is and not come bother us afterwards while we were stuffing our faces haha.

The mood was laid back and the artwork for sale on the walls interesting. The beers were not the ordinary brands but the staff matched preferred  brands to their equivalents well. The food was five star and whoever was cooking in the basement deserves a raise because I don't think they will be there long. Excellent burger with a Portuguese type bun, tasty beef that didn't even need ketchup, thick bacon and thin crispy onion rings which were the BEST I've ever had. The only reason I didn't give it a five was the debris collected in front of the stairs where the food comes up from is distracting and should be removed. Also the bun was tasty but didn't fit the burger so either make the patties bigger or the bun smaller. The bun looked right for the grilled chicken breast sandwich which I will have next time.",,,

Updated review","After more than 2 years in business, Benson's remains a great place for great food, great beer, and a great over all environment. The staff is very accommodating, friendly and they really know their craft beers, & the rotating drafts really keep a beer lover interested. I love the Burgers and those those fresh cut thick fries (I always ask for them a little well done to be sure I get those great crispy edges--yum). Reviewers say you should always give a new place at least 2 visits before making up your mind...well I've been back dozens and dozens of times since they opened and it has definately passed the test if time. Don't miss this place.",,,

Instead I received a meatball on a  bun, encompassing only about half of the whole bun. Gotta say, this was probably one of the worst burgers I've had in the city. Even diner burgers are better.

Always quiet but filled with friendly locals, works for dinner, lunch, brunch (breakfast burger!), or drinking all night.

I like that the owner was so passionate and involved in the business- I would definitely go again, not only for the food and beverage, but also to support a young business owner!",,,
188,Alexander V.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,1,5.0,12/28/2015,"Burger was incredible. In my top 2 burgers ever. Amazing bread, and the taste of the meat remained in my mouth for hours.The fries and the onion rings are in the same league. Possibly the best I have ever had. Cool and cosy place. Felt that the Australian waiter could be perceived to be a bit rude once or twice with his comments, but I honestly believe that it was part of his culture/background and wasn't meant to be rude - just comical.",,,
189,Bob B.,"Oakmont, PA",149,242,8,4.0,6/1/2016,"I was expecting the place to be packed given the difficulty to get reservations.  I got the barbeque burger that was delicious.  The barbeque sauce was not overpowering, but gave the burger a nice taste.  The onion rings were perfect.  They had a few drafts, but nothing that stood out.",2,1,3
190,Sasha M.,"South Collinwood, Cleveland, OH",3,12,2,5.0,11/12/2016,Great food. Phenomenal service ! The accommodated our nine member party. It was my birthday and they were so kind and gave me a free piece of cake,,,
191,Adi B.,"Boston, MA",0,22,25,4.0,12/4/2016,"Went with four other people on a Sunday for brunch. Best French toast I have had in NYC! Everyone else enjoyed their food as well. Very fresh and my meat-loving friend loved their bacon lol. Thick cuts!  I can't remember our waiter's name for the life of me (he was from Australia and had red hair and dimples), but he was very personable and made our brunch experience delightful!",,,
192,Cyrus C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",41,49,5,5.0,11/2/2015,Remember to  check-in for free draught. Came last Friday night and got the lamb burger that came with fries. And it was good. It's a small place so come before the crowd does. Great value and yummy drinks and food.,,,
193,Amanda G.,"New York, NY",190,35,18,5.0,10/14/2016,"My roommate and I frequent Benson's and have never had a bad experience here. The burgers are amazing! Staff is super friendly and outgoing.. I am a bit of a food enthusiast (a picky one at that) so I always make special requests, and they graciously accommodate me each time. The space is small so I would recommend making a reservation if you're coming with a large group.",,,
194,Rostic G.,"Boston, MA",1,1,0,5.0,11/19/2015,"First time writing a review, so that should mean something. Really might be one of the best burgers I've had in NYC with a superb beer selection. Great ambience and music. Annie was the sweetest and most fun waitress I've had in the city! Talk about great, efficient service with a smile that would cheer up even the gloomiest person on a rainy NYC night! What a good time!",,,
195,Christian E.,"San Diego, CA",15,21,1,5.0,10/10/2016,"This place was fantastic! It's quite small so consider making a reservation. The food is plated spectacularly and the bacon, in particular, is out of this world.",,,
196,Taylor P.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,5,0,5.0,12/10/2016,"I have never written a review, but this place isSO good that I felt compelled. I'm  confident that this is the best burger I've ever had. All of them are amazing, but my fave is the benson burger with beets and an egg on top! So juicy.Have been for brunch (awesome deal with drinks) and dinner with friends... never disappoints. Annie and Dave are the coolest and make everyone feel like family!",,,
197,Andy L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,47,3,5.0,5/10/2016,dude the burgers are mad good the meat is tender buns are tight no bs just juicy ass in your faceyou can tell they care about their food cause its good everytime feels like a more lunch place to me but a real good burger is good anytime,1,4,
198,Andrew C.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,6,3,5.0,12/19/2015,"Definitely a great spot for brunch. Dave was so cool even though he mocked my choice of not having the Benson burger with beets. He called it the ""Aussie hate burger"" which was funny to say the least, and just added to the chilled vibe of the restaurant. Heading there again tomorrow for my friend's birthday brunch, super excited to get The Benson again",,,
199,Vanessa S.,"Queens, NY",0,1,0,5.0,5/12/2017,"Absolutely amazing, loved this place! David was super friendly and the burger was a dream come true! Definitely recommend it.",,,
