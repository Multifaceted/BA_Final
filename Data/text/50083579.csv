0,Alison W.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,87,36,5.0,11/7/2018,"i love shake shack. shake shack owns all other burger chains, stop it in n out does not compare. i went the first week it opened since i work like 3 blocks away. i love that this location is so big and has the touch screen menus to order. lets talk about whats different here than other shake shacks cus the burger and everything else tastes the same, good quality and consistency all over. the 2 things that i had here that other shake shacks dont have..1. chicken nuggets! = overall very good, but i prefer chickfilas nuggets2. BLACK SESAME MILKSHAKE = omg i love all things black sesame and this was so good, so thick and creamy with so much black sesame flavor, so so so good that i dream about it",,,

Updated review","Got the spicy chicken sandwich with extra spicy, no pickles slaw onions and lettuce. The sandwich was good but they forgot my lettuce and it was probably  4-6 out of 10 spicy. With respect to everyone elses pallet, when I order something ""extra spicy"" I want there to be mild concern in each individual bite. I want to be a little scared, but still feel confident that I'm gonna finish. This sandwich was good but i wish extra spicy was actually extra spicy and not Totinos medium salsa level spicy. My major hang up with this place is that the staircase down to the ""Co working space"" or whatever is right next to the pickup area, so dozens of hungry people congregate in the small area between them, Waiting for their order to be barked out. This lack of Feng shui makes the joint a congested airport of beef and shakes. the texting system doesn't work in a timely manner, by the time I got the ""your orders almost ready text"" I was chin deep in some cutlet.",,,
2,Stacey T.,"New York, NY",152,143,152,4.0,11/6/2018,"This location is unique since it includes innovation kitchen items that aren't available at all locations. It's brand new with electronic kiosks, online ordering, etc. We ordered a shake burger, shack stack,chicken bites and cheese fries. We customized our burgers and everything came out correct and hot within a reasonable period of time. Pro tip: order the shack sauce on the side of your burger if you want some extra dipping sauce without having to pay for it. The chicken bites aren't available at all locations so it's fun to try them here. They were flavored well and didn't have an overwhelming amount of breading which is refreshing.",1,,
3,Joanne H.,"New York, NY",255,266,473,5.0,11/2/2018,One word: nuggets! (two if I have to specify chicken). Dangerous having a Shake Shack open just up the street (and next to the gym!!).,2,,2

Updated review","If you come for one thing, make sure it's the chicken nuggets. These might be the best, juiciest nuggs anywhere in the fast food universe currently.Also of note, their Rick's Picks hotdog with no actual dog inside is a surprise hit. Love ordering from the innovation tab and seeing what sticks.",9,2,6
5,Daniel F.,"Flushing, NY",720,628,1131,5.0,9/25/2018,"Do You ..hate interacting with people? like Shake Shack burgers, fries and shakes?like to try new things? This may be the most perfect Shake Shack in the world. You can order via the kiosk in the front and pay for your order. You enter your phone number and receive a text when your order is ready. It's possible to order and leave with your food without speaking to a single soul. This Shake Shack is also an innovation kitchen. What that means is you'll find things like chicken nuggets and black sesame shakes. They have new items that they'll test out here before releasing it to other locations. The best part is they have all of the items you already tried and love here too. Definitely worth a visit!",5,4,5
6,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64808,5.0,9/18/2018,"This is the new ""Innovation Kitchen"" location of Shake Shack, which is where they will be testing fun new things that might not make it to permanent menus or even other locations at all.First up, and on the menu at this location, are the delicious new Chick'n Bites. These are a nice menu addition and hopefully they start adding more of the test items for us to try. Otherwise, they have all the same classics from the 100 something other locations.While the room is big and spacious, there actually isn't that much seating, as there is a staircase in the middle of the restaurant that leads down to the Innovation Kitchen. It's a location using the kiosk ordering system like they started with at Astor Place, so it seems like it will probably be mostly takeout business for the big offices nearby.",11,2,10
7,Anurag P.,"New York, NY",57,225,322,4.0,10/2/2018,"Beautiful Shake Shack location with big windows and tons of natural light. There's a digital kiosk line as well as your usual cashier line. This was a little confusing for people though, especially since the cashier isn't visible from the entrance.My double Shack Burger, fries, and shake were all perfect, basically what I'd consider an ideal Shake Shack meal.I was a little let down by the ""Innovation Kitchen"" aspect of this location though. When I was here, there was nothing else extra besides the chicken bites, which I heard bad things about so decided to skip. Note of appreciation: I accidentally left my backpack here for 20 minutes and the staff was kind enough to hold it in the back for me. Thank you!",,,
8,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,10/29/2018,"Innovation at its finest.This isn't just another Shake Shack in Manhattan, but its the one that houses its new Innovation Kitchen, a place to test out some new recipes upon the masses. From chicken nuggets to cold brew matcha lattes, as well as their Innovation Burger which gets updated as new recipes roll out, they've got something for the more adventurous stomachs. They've also got their tried and true classics for Shake Shack purists. Ha! Upon entering, you are faced with several self-serve kiosks that accept cards; no worries if you have cash, just order at the counter around the corner! Service was pretty fast for a relatively-packed house at 6 p.m. on a Thursday evening. I came to this location with purpose, to try their Innovation Burger: on 10/25/2018, it was the Black Garlic Burger, which combined fried watercress, breaded mozzarella, and black garlic mayo. It was INSANE, definitely something I'd love to have on their regular menu, or at least as an occasional special. THOUGH...if anyone on the Shake Shack crew happens to read this: While I loved the watercress, I didn't really like pulling out the stems of a few of my bites. Perhaps strip the leaves of the watercress from the stems if this continues to be a regular menu item. :-)It's nice to have both beloved options as well as whatever is being crafted in their kitchen down below. The regular burgers and fries there are just as great as any other Shake Shack location. Though, this location also gets additional props for having Health-Ade Kombucha on tap! Hey, you never know when that booch craving will strike, even if it's while downing a Shackburger!And don't let its location the map fool ya! It may be a little far down, but it's one block from the 1 at Houston. NICE.",,,1
9,Bing R.,"New York, NY",146,515,2997,3.0,9/24/2018,I was anticipating to have a souvide chicken and then fried.  Am very disappointed.The chicken is set unlike what I had expected as souvide would do.  The batter is so thick!  It's like those ordinary fried chicken place. I think they should stick to their hamburgers unless they can make a wonderful melt in your mouth souvide chicken and fried in a much lighter batter.I will not order this again.  I also bought the chicken nuggets to try it out.  Nope!  Too much crust.,,,
10,David L.,"New York, NY",833,1138,1105,2.0,9/22/2018,"Today, my friend & I saw a marathon dance-theater performance (almost seven-hours long), and we ate here beforehand & then again afterward.Everyone was so pleasant this afternoon. So many friendly faces, so much attentiveness & kindness. The blood-orange ginger-lemonade was addictive, and the spicy chicken sandwich (with cole-slaw, pickles, lettuce, tomato, and cherry peppers) was awesome. However, the chicken nuggets were blah. Everything this evening was chaotic and stressful. We got a text saying our food was ready about ten minutes before it actually was, and then it took them another ten minutes to bring us our drink. To be polite, there are too many employees here, and they spent most of the time dancing together (dear management, please check the fu€£ing cameras), they forgot everything, multiple people disappeared to do the same thibg but then came back without having done it, it was a $#itshow; actions are needed. Some weird guy (employee, unfortunately) kept going around shoving chairs under tables and smashing customers (me included) in the knees. Lots of empty tables were filthy, but some awful woman (employee, unfortunately) kept imposing upon occupied tables, then sprayed & wiped them down while people were still eating -- super gross. Even the kitchen was royally screwing up -- our spicy chicken sandwich was really soggy & missing tomatoes and pickles; our shack-ago dog was super soggy; they gave us a small peach tea when we ordered a large; and our fries must have been the first thing prepared which just sat there and sat there waiting for the rest of our order to be completed because they, like everything else, were super soggy. Sadly, the employees bad-mouthed us when we merely inquired about what was taking everything so long, and I can only imagine what they would have done had we complained about everything that was wrong once we got our order! Oh, and all the trash-cans were overflowing. Plus, multiple ordering-machines were out of order!I'd give it 1 star, but the spicy chicken sandwich and the blood-orange ginger lemonade are great, and, again, all the afternoon employees were wonderful.",8,1,2
11,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",237,79,37,5.0,10/14/2018,"This new Shake Shack is amazing.I love that you have to order on iPads when you get in (though I've heard there is also a normal cashier line?). The space is extremely bright and airy though slightly lacking on seating given how big the space is. Their first ever Innovation Kitchen is located here, so you can try things that aren't out at the other Shake Shacks yet. I got their chicken nuggets which blew my mind out of the water. They're more similar to Chick-fil-a nuggets though I would say these are definitely better. Their honey mustard sauce is also amazing and I definitely don't think I can go back to McDonald's nuggets after this. I also love that they text you when your order is about to be ready, which makes it so much easier to grab a seat and wait there instead of in front of the pick up counter.",,1,
12,Joesephine K.,"Houston, TX",1034,29,38,4.0,10/2/2018,Takes a little while to get your food but this location has some fun items you can't get anywhere else. Got the hot chick sandwich - delicious! I still think I'm genera shake shack is overpriced though.,1,1,1
13,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1108,1107,4.0,9/18/2018,"A coworker and I decided to brave the opening day crowd (and the rain) to get some Shake Shack. We were basically lured in by their new chicken nuggets. It's basically a cash-less place since you order via tablet and pay using credit card. I like this cause it I get to make my own order after seeing pics - even though I've basically had every item at SS already. The food took about 20 mins to come out, which is what staff at the door had said. We managed to snag two seats and ate there. The new chicken nuggets are bomb. I took the initiative to dunk them in the cheese sauce that comes with the cheese fries and I will be forever changed. Do it, I promise it's amazing.",3,1,2
14,Jen W.,"Flushing, NY",100,423,197,4.0,10/15/2018,"They have chicken nuggets here. Say what? That alone got me here. They have kiosks that you can order from, so you don't have to have any human interaction of any kind! Plus you have control over what you want to order, so the only person holding up the line is YOU!The nuggets are the same as the chicken in the chick n shack. This location offers things that aren't available at the other shake shacks. The food came out in the standard time it takes at shake shack. There is a person you can order form if you are paying with cash, or if you crave human interaction.Food is the same, as always. The space is great, its got lots of seats and a restroom downstairs. Check it out if you're ever in the area.",1,,

Go now.",2,1,2
16,Anam B.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,41,48,5.0,9/24/2018,"If you've been to Shake Shack before, you already know the burgers are amazing. I visited the new innovation kitchen on the afternoon of September 24. My 5 stars are based on the following two things:First - the chicken bites! Wow these were amazing. So flavorful, tender, and juicy! I had very little expectations for these but they were so good. I ordered these with the honey mustard dipping sauce which was also very tasty.Second - the customer service. Everyone seemed friendly but one employee named Julian (I think) was passing by my table and stopped to ask if I was enjoying the chicken bites, and then he even offered to get me some BBQ dipping sauce to try. I'm glad he did, because it was SO good! This small gesture really made a great impression. Keep it up Shake Shack!",1,,2
17,Gilian V.,"Manhattan, NY",49,52,0,2.0,10/5/2018,my boyfriend and I were in the mood for somejunk food;  hence we arrived.  For some reason the service was really bad that particular day. horrible rest room management did not makefor a happy visit.  I let the manager know thatthe restrooms needed attention .  Did not seem to care. i guess good for a quick bite ...  if it would be quick-,,,

Updated review",Sweetest staff!! I went during mid lunch rush and ordered a shack burger (yumm). When they couldn't figure out how to use my gift card they just gave it to me on the house!! They will also give you extra shake sauce on the side if you ask. I barely had to wait for my food and when I was done they offered to throw it out for me. Honestly how can anyone go wrong with shake shack.,,,
19,Shawn B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,10/29/2018,"Food is good. Been to this location a few times since I work in the area. But the customer service is awful.

20,Navid A.,"Santa Clara, CA",121,11,0,1.0,10/10/2018,Horrible. Possibly the worst experience ever. Ordered and waited for 50 minutes but never got the food. I got text messages that the food is ready. But the food never came and no one was even willing to check the oder. I spoke with 5 different folks on the floor and the kitchen and no one really gave a shit.,,,
21,Stephanie D.,"New York, NY",2,18,9,5.0,10/8/2018,"I was a bit nervous when I walked in last week as there was a self service area with I pads instead of people taking orders. The line was long but it was surprisingly quick and there was a very helpful young lady helping anyone who needed it. The wait wasn't too long and my friends and I were able to find a table quickly. The employees walking around greeted us and even offered to pick up our trays as we were done. The best part was the genuine smiles from ALL staff members. The restaurant was clean; staff members were constantly walking around wiping down tables... not something I see at other shake shacks. And as always, their burgers are awesome. I will definitely be going back.",,,
22,Geoff B.,"Manhattan, NY",150,5,0,4.0,10/10/2018,"How is it possible that they just opened the Varrick location few weeks ago and I've already eaten there 5+ times? Ugh Shake Shack is too good it's a problem. The food looks like a magazine editorial the way they merchandise it so effortlessly on those baking sheets they serve on. Warning that they seem to be having a few start-up pains at the new location, as it's taken a bit too long for my food to be prepared, but everyone was smiley and apologetic, so I'm sure they'll get everything right soon.",,,
23,lysa p.,"New York, NY",440,485,40,1.0,9/26/2018,"Simple tasteless fast food. Burger is dry, thin and over cooked. Fries were ehh. If you need a quick fix I guess this is for you.",,,
