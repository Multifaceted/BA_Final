0,Greg T.,"Santa Paula, CA",84,379,1001,4.0,10/5/2018,"Guyers is a comfy locals kind of place on the upper West Side. A cozy, warm bar inside and a nice outside seating area.They have a full bar and a small but we'll selected menu of wine choices. The house wine I had was an excellent Sauv Blanc, with a good price and generous pour- two things I love.  My wife had a prosecco that was just as good.The food menu is also small but diverse. The truffle Mac n cheese was exceptionally good. I loved the bruschetta as well. Service was a little spotty the second night we dropped by, but everyone was really friendly, and the owner made a point to stop and say "" Hi!"". If you are looking for a glass of wine and bite in a relaxed atmosphere, this is the place.",1,,1
1,Debra R.,"Ventura, CA",583,619,3962,4.0,10/4/2018,"What a lovely spot with outdoor tables, and a pleasant bar inside. After a very generous pour of prosecco and their house white wine, we opted for the truffle mac n cheese, which was wonderful. We were trying to make the Triad theatre show a block away, and they brought the check right away and made sure my husband liked the house white. Will definitely be back since our hotel is only a block away.",5,3,5
2,Emily M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,72,36,4.0,4/22/2018,"I've been coming to this bar for about three years since when it was called Wine and Roses. It used to be a nice place to drink a glass of wine, but they didn't really have a lot of food. I just went again, and their menu now has cocktails and decent sized menu. I was surprised by how good the food was because the charcuterie and flatbreads used to be just ok for how expensive they were. I got truffle Mac and cheese which was super cheesy but not too oily which we devoured instantly. We also got the beef sliders which were also great, very highly seasoned, but still moist and simple good flavors. The service was a bit slow but I always have a nice time when I come here. It's a really dependable place to come for a casual drink in the UWS.",2,,2
3,Pete C.,"New York, NY",13,13,4,4.0,9/16/2018,"I went to Guyer's a few days ago for the first time.  It is a nice place to hang out for a few drinks.  I met some interesting people; it has a casual vibe that can be hard to come by in the neighborhood, and the music was great.  I recommend stopping by.",3,1,3
4,Sammy J.,"New York, NY",10,30,28,5.0,12/2/2017,"Definitely one of the best places on the UWS. The owner is regularly on site and has been nothing but warm and generous. She even made Food one night after the kitchen close.  We showed up after a cabaret performance a few blocks away, with 6 people and were starving. The chef had gone but she whipped up a few flatbread pizzas for a starving table.  We were So grateful. The other bartenders have always been just as warm. After ordering the grunner vetliner (highly recommended), one bartender made several other suggestions and gave me small sampling's of a few other crispy whites I have never heard of. She sold me on two other glasses of new wines I'd never had. The really nice thing about this wine bar is they have a full assortment of spirits. So if you bring friends who are more of the vodka, whiskey, gin type, guyers has you covered. Ask about the picture of the beautiful woman to the left of the bathroom door.",2,,2

6,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,514,298,2.0,6/4/2017,"Popped in here one night for a drink on my way home.  Wish I hadn't, to be honest.  It was the bartender's first day, so he didn't know anything.  There was a woman buzzing around, who I assume was the owner... but she seemed more interested in flirting with regulars at the bar than doing anything else.  And speaking of the (older) men at the bar - they definitely took for granted that any (younger) woman was there for their conversational needs.  NOT.I ordered the calamari, and it was pretty gross. I barely touched it, and when I asked for the check, the bartender didn't ask me to wrap it up or if anything was wrong.  Service fail.It seems like a lot of people in the neighborhood think this is a cool chill place, but I found it to be a weird portal into everything I don't like in a bar.  Will not be back.",7,1,1
7,Alexis D.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/22/2018,A bottle of this particular wine I ordered is $25. They charged me $18 for a glass. I could go to a 5 star restaurant and have a glass of this for 14-16. Absolutely not worth coming back again.,,,
8,Melane M.,"New York, NY",15,54,16,2.0,11/18/2017,"I love wine, and my date loves cocktails. So we came here after dinner thinking this would be a nice spot for us both. It was not. They just don't do cocktails...like, seriously. He ordered a margarita, and it was atrocious. I suggested a classic old fashioned, and it was just the worst. I felt bad that my date wasn't having a good time. The wine menu is wonderful though. But the service was also sub par -- our server literally tried to take our order seconds after we sat down. Weird.I'd suggest not going with someone who prefers cocktails and not expecting the best service.",,,
9,M E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,25,0,2.0,10/18/2018,"Several friends and I stopped in on a Friday at 5:30 to grab a quick dinner and couple of drinks before a timed entry museum exhibit that we needed to be at by 7:00. We were the only customers for a while, but we received poor service the whole time. The bar tender/waitress was the only person working, so we were willing to cut her slack at first (even despite the very small number of patrons), but it became obvious over the next hour and a half that she didn't care in the least to do her job - she only wanted to talk and canoodle with her male friend at the bar/downstairs... We had to get her attention from across the room when we wanted to order after 20 minutes, and she failed to mention that the chef wasn't even there yet. By 6:45 we were trying to ask her when the food was coming, or if we could cancel the orders, and she said it was ready. 10 minutes later she started to bring *some* of the food out. I believe the quality was fine, but I honestly couldn't really tell since I was shoveling it into my mouth so quickly because we had to run to our exhibit. Two stars because she comped our food, but man, it was pretty ridiculous.",,,
10,Mary P.,"New York, NY",173,7,0,1.0,7/21/2018,"This is by far the worst restaurant I've ever gone to. Sure, stop in if you want a glass of wine but for anything else beware. I'm pretty sure the chef went across the street to pioneer to buy my steak that was overcooked and unseasoned. Like literally just eating cooked meat. So shocking for an NYC restaurant.",1,1,
11,Jillian P.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,10/18/2018,"I came in with a large group of friends at 5:30 on a Friday night and the place was totally empty. Drinks came out quickly - so far so good (but 5 glasses of wine and a beer is pretty easy). It was all downhill from there. It took us 10 minutes to catch the waitress's attention to order food - she was mostly too distracted flirting with her boyfriend who was sitting at the end of the bar. We proceed to put in a food order - a few orders of fries, burgers, and flat bread. Easy, right? Apparently not. After 30-40 minutes of her very deliberately avoiding our table (during which she disappeared into the basement with said boyfriend for upwards of 10 minutes - your guess is as good as mine), one of my friends had to literally wave her down so we could ask about our food. Turns out her chef was late, and HADN'T EVEN ARRIVED when we put our food order in - apparently she just wasn't going to tell us until we told her we literally had to run out the door by 7pm to make a show. The food ended up coming out piecemeal after 50 or 55 minutes - we never got the full order. I'm giving two stars because she did comp us for the meal, but honestly how would you charge someone for food they didn't even get to eat? This place is fine if you have hours to spare, but I don't recommend it if you're in a hurry.",,,
12,Irene E.,"Great Neck, NY",140,231,1311,3.0,3/5/2017,"A lovely little bar and cafe on the west side. We've a drink or two there between the Natural history museum and Beethoven @ Lincoln Center. I ordered the house wine which was, not good.",,1,
13,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,5.0,11/28/2016,"Great wine bar with a very personable owner who makes you feel at home, and fantastically made cocktails. My friend and I were looking for a low key place to have a drink before dinner and this place looked cute, welcoming and familiar.  I didn't realize it was a previous Wine and Roses spot I adored, but while I loved the rose theme this is also a really cozy spot.Soon as we entered the very friendly owner Cindy greeted and found us a seat where we would like at the bar, commanding the space as a friendly caring host would greet and address guests in her home.  I actually recognized her outstanding and memorable host type service as familiar. Turns out as I glanced on their site and scanned articles there later this is a new business for the owner who was a model adorning hundreds of romance novels and - interestingly - whose late father had told her what I noticed in my impressionable observation that she had a gift for hosting / entertaining. Her dad was right.Cindy showed us the outlets for phone charging built into the bar area by the handbag holders. Bonus. (I think every bar should have customer accessible outlets for phone chargers and hooks for bags.)She also suggested mixed cocktails in addition to their wines, which I would not have considered but the Mezcal old fashioned was fantastic. Made by a friendly bartender introduced to us to who is also a fireman.  Interesting and cool.Definitely recommend as a comfortable cute wine bar upper west side with an owner who makes you feel like a welcome guest.",9,5,9
14,L M.,"Manhattan, NY",48,31,0,1.0,1/13/2018,They were out of half the wine the bartender was rude and obnoxious and I ended up disputing the charge with my credit card,2,,
15,Carla Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/13/2018,"Horrible. Out of half of the wines, out of ingredients for advertised cocktails. Bartender was at best, not interested in bartending, and at worst rude. Area behind bar unclean. Bartender picked up straws from the floor after dropping and put then back in the holder (they were wrapped, but still). Avoid this place. There are many other, nicer wine bars in the area. Oh and really overpriced.",1,,
16,Rosemary I.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,2.0,5/20/2018,The problem with my meal was the portion size.  I ordered a caesar salad as a main course for 14.00 and it was at best 3 leaves of romaine lettuce a couple of soggy croutons and 2 grape tomatoes cut in half.  I should have taken a picture of it.  I live on the upper east side and have ordered salads in all types of restaurants and have never seen such a thing.  We asked before time how the portions were and the waiter said...pretty good size.  Not sure what he method of measurement he was using.  Well this is the last time I visit this establishment.,2,1,
17,Thomas F.,"Manhattan, NY",84,61,0,2.0,12/14/2017,"A thoroughly disinterested, and distracted owner with the predictable consequences. During my visits, Ms. Guyer breezed in and out like a guest star on her way to who knows where.  Another time she sat in the sidewalk cafe while the bar and kitchen screwed up orders, and checks, including ours. She made no move to pitch in or remedy the situation. Another time Ms. Guyer was actually bartending but made sure that we all knew that it was only until her bartender showed up--the message being that bartending was below her. Our scotch and soda orders were  a major production; she apparently didn't know where the soda was kept and the ice in the bin was old. If Ms. Guyer doesn't embrace her business, I doubt she'll be around for long.",1,,
18,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",40,265,41,4.0,12/17/2016,"Guyer's is nice, cozy wine bar on the UWS.  New to the area, I stopped in after some late afternoon errands to check the place out.  Always good to do so before inviting friends to a new place.  Turned out to be very nice.  I was greeted by a super-cute, tiny dog named Gino, the owner's dog, who's little tail was wagging as he looked up at me.  I was immediately hooked. He had me at the first wag and smile. :)The owner was serving and she was very nice.  She offered for me to taste two types of Pinot Noir, one the happy hour priced wine, the other a regular priced.   Both were nice.  The happy hour one was pleasant and so I ordered a glass, OK and a second, to go along with the Mediterranean plate of humus, baba ganoush, and tabouleh with some pita wedges and some olives.  Very nice, satisfying and certainly sharable.Nice and simple decor with dark woods, candles, etc...I'll plan to go back for sure. :)",,,
19,Glenn W.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/20/2017,"It's clear that the business model here is that the owner is semi-famous (barely) and customers should be thrilled to pay high prices for substandard food and poorly-constructed drinks, in the hope of actually meeting the beyond-her-prime model. I wonder of Miss Guyer will someday realize that she was nothing more than a D-list wannabe.Take my advice and avoid this wreck.",1,,1
20,Ellen S.,"New York, NY",8,75,0,4.0,5/11/2017,"Nice friendly welcoming bar. Owner is very friendly and makes everyone feel at home. Good music selections (at least to my taste). Agree with what others have said in terms of her willingness to accommodate people's charging needs, bags, stuff, etc. Interesting selection of wines by glass. Happy hour offers good pricing.  We tried some of the food which was just OK and a bit overpriced, but it is prime Columbus Ave and rents are what they are.  Its nice to have some food options with your beverages. It used to be just a wine bar. This time around she has a liquor license and I even saw someone order a glass of iced tea. Its that kind of place. Pop in and hang out. I sort of sensed that if you asked for something she didnt sell she would pop to a store and buy it for you. It also fills in a nice stretch of the Ave with limited options. Hope it lasts.",,,
21,Sharon S.,"Woodbury, NY",0,9,0,5.0,5/30/2018,This is a wonderful neighborhood bar on the UWS - the owner knows everyone who comes in and the food is really excellent. Their happy hour is also a great deal.,,,
22,Sarah B.,"Arlington, MA",0,4,0,5.0,4/20/2018,One of my favorite bars on the UWS - perfect ambiance and always calm.  A great place to grab a happy hour drink after work.,,,
23,Marie A.,"New York, NY",48,116,15,5.0,8/11/2017,This place reminds me of Cheers.  It's one of those rare spots in the city where you feel like a regular after your first visit.  I've been in three times in recent weeks and have spotted and conversed with familiar faces (the horseshoe shaped bar seems made for conversations among strangers) and already know the owner by name (it's Cindy...Guyer).  The wine list is succinct but spot on and the beet salad I had was satisfying and perfectly portioned.,,,
24,Jay G.,"New York, NY",9,25,8,1.0,9/30/2016,"Where to begin...My friends and I came here for dinner on a rainy night, knowing it had just opened and looked like a cute local spot. Cute and local it was, but the service experience itself was abominable and one unfortunately I could never forgive.Firstly the waitress, while very sweet as a person, was drinking the entire time we were at the bar. I'd say 40% of the time she was doing her job, the other 60% she was drinking and distracted by patrons. Being friendly is one thing, but you can't forget to do the job at hand.Second, our experience paying the bill was an absolute nightmare. It took longer than we would've liked to flag our distracted waitress down to get the bill (basically begged for it), for which we handed her three cards to split equally. Simple, right? Wrong.30 minutes later, as we watch the waitress not charging anymore cards and meandering about the bar, we flag down the owner to please get the show on the road. She talks to the waitress who finally returns to the register to complete our transaction, only to find out she charged one of our cards over $100 (our bill was $90), and doesn't have any other cards. WHY.After nervously wandering the bar and shuffling through other ppls checks, even trying to blindly hand us someone else's card, she comes back with only ONE of the cards. The other was on the ground discovered 20 minutes later. Probably because she went downstairs to talk to her ex boyfriend mid search... Now to the restaurant owners credit she was helping to corral this woman into helping us, but it only could go so far with someone completely unable to do her job.Long story long, we ended up getting the $100 charge voided and only paying 2/3 of the bill. The owner promised a full comp, but the drunk and disheveled waitress was too overwhelmed to void the other charges.Listen, this place has potential for sure. It just needs all new waitresses, and all new management who will actually enforce rules that will keep the place a respectable establishment.",10,3,
25,Ena K.,"New York, NY",23,7,0,1.0,11/17/2017,Terrible customer service! Their credit card machine broke down and they didn't tell us before we sat down. So unprofessional!

And the bartender was not friendly through the process!!!!,2,,
26,CP P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,1/23/2018,"I have revisited this bar last Sunday after taking a break and was so happy with basically everything. It turned out that our waiter, Dany, who was previously working at Candle - just started there and made us and my friends so welcome - let this be the new local chilled UWS Neighbourhood - a place for anyone! Dany mixed great cocktails and was also very knowledgeable about the wines on offer. It was all topped off with some delicious bruschetta and other nibbles. We'll be back!",,,

We witnessed him being rude to a girl that just wanted the check split on three credit cards and he rudely just told her the machine won't let him do it. There was this ""waitress"" that barely had any clothes on who was also drinking at the bar with some other random people that we couldn't tell if they worked there or not. Everyone was distracted, just hanging out, not paying attention to us or any other customers. It's the worst customer service I've ever witnessed. The people working there were unprofessional and just hanging out. A guy came in and wanted to order food, the wonder told him they couldn't make what he wanted.as he gets up we give that owner our card to pay our check and she runs out that street to run down the guy to tell him they can maybe make him some Mac and cheese while she's holding our credit card!! We were in a hurry to get out of there and just couldn't believe what was happening. Took forever to get out check, just so unprofessional. I can't believe this place is still open.

Everyone is well-spoken, well-informed, and the service is outstanding. The decor is modern and classy, while also being accessible, but the food is an immersive experience using simple flavors in elegant ways.
