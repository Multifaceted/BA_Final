1,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,3.0,11/5/2018,"The wine list isn't too exciting and doesn't have many daring, unique choices you wouldn't be able to find elsewhere. That being said, the prices are very reasonable for the wines they serve, and they have good options if you aren't looking for something overly pricy or ""classic"" and just want a decent glass of wine. This is definitely one of the better places in this neighborhood to grab drinks, at the very least.I also tried the hummus. Portions were small but the hummus itself was amazing. I highly recommend trying it! The service was very helpful and friendly.The atmosphere in Pino is very casual and relaxed. It is a very small place, so I recommend coming here during off peak times to guarantee a spot.I wouldn't particularly go out of my way to come back here but I'd definitely stop by again if I was in the neighborhood.",,,
2,Dom G.,"New York, NY",3,24,15,5.0,11/8/2018,Great wine bar with attentive service. We came here for a night cap and had a great time. The place is nice and intimate.. dark.. music not too loud.. great place for a date me thinks!,,,
3,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,79,73,4.0,7/7/2018,"Great hole-in-the-wall restaurant and wine bar in midtown east. When the weather is nice, the entire facade of the restaurant is open to the street, making for an even more pleasant experience. But, without a doubt, the strongest asset of this restaurant is the service - I've been twice, and both times felt very taken care of. Wine selection is solid. I tried the brussel sprouts most recently, and they were good, but not anything to write home about. Overall a great place for a date or a relaxing drink in a nice setting.",,,

5,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11030,4.0,1/24/2017,"I hate Midtown East, but sometimes you gotta be a good brother (and a good Yelper). The Pino chef does catering for a wedding venue in Brooklyn that my sister was considering, so we decided to stop in and check out the food.Pino is pretty small. We got there super early, so we were able to snag a table, which was precious real estate. Toward the end of our meal, there were just people three deep at the bar waiting for a table. Maybe they should start taking reservations.Like the space, the food is also small. A little bigger than tapas, but not quite a full entree. The prices seem reasonable until you realize that.Between the four of us, we had the Brussels sprouts, truffle turkey meatballs, octopus, crab cake, crab claw mac & cheese, and a beef Wellington. The crab cake was actually an accident (they misheard our crab mac order), but it was a pleasant surprise. The beef Wellington (at $32) was the star of the show. Flaky, medium rare, delicious. The turkey meatballs didn't taste like turkey, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; add truffles to anything and it's automatically delicious. The crab mac had giant hunks of claw meat mixed in with the large shells, and had all the crispy burnt cheese on the sides that everyone loves. The octopus was good with a nice portion size, but the roasted potatoes it came with were undercooked.Makes sense that since it's such a small place, their kitchen is basically non-existent. Just a tiny oven and a small stovetop. Given that, it's pretty impressive what they can send out.Can't say I'll be returning, but I look forward to eating their food again in a few months!",2,1,2
6,Rudy C.,"Loire-Atlantique, France",0,14,0,5.0,8/17/2018,I had heard good things about this spot and it didnt dissapoint. Visited on a Thursday evening and the place was buzzing. Delicious bites served till midnight. The octopus and meatballs were outstanding. Jay the main man was an example host. Thank you Pino !,,,
7,Stephanie A.,"New York, NY",205,128,69,4.0,8/2/2017,"Cute little, tiny wine bar on 33rd. When it's nice out, they completely open the walls/door so you feel like you are almost outside. Nice selection of wines. Happy hour from 4- 6. Didn't have any food, but it smelled really good! Will come back again.",,,

Updated review","What the heck?  No picture posted from anyone here was anything that looked remotely like the ""flatbread"" I ordered, unfortunately It was a half circle cracker with gobs of bagged pre-shredded cheese (they assemble it right in front of you) and a unripe beefsteak tomato with refrigerated pre made pesto?  It was awful. Even my husband who is not picky at all couldn't eat any more than one bite. The wine was awesome and the cute tiny interior was amazingly inviting and cozy, but my gosh, $14 for that thing they called a flatbread?!  I could have gotten 4 pizza slices down the street for less and it would have been ten times better. Booo.",4,3,1
9,Natasha T.,"ASTORIA, NY",80,11,0,5.0,6/19/2018,Andrew is a great new addition to the bar. He is very attentive and able to make a great drink or food recommendation.  Happy hour is great and plenty of delicious small plates to share. Great wine bar to add to the neighborhood.,,,1
10,Fred A.,"Manhattan, NY",399,152,0,2.0,6/21/2017,"4.5 Stars? Now I know you can't blindly trust ratings on here.Sure, the decor is nice, cozy, quaint. Wine selection is fine, good, abundant. But I haven't been this underwhelmed in a while. Which is a shame, because I thought this place was fine last time I was here a year ago. Still pricey, sure, but pretty fine.The waiter (chef?) sort of had this off-putting, brash demeanor about him. The brussell  sprouts  were sort of soft and soggy, with little to no flavor. Something was off about the turkey meatballs, though the sauce it came with was good. The octopus salad was pretty good, but small for the price and not enough octopus. Generally speaking, bland, small portions for a decently high price tag.",1,,
11,R L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,46,151,3.0,7/7/2018,Good relaxing wine bar. Very neighborhood bar. I go there for glass of wines time to time. HH is until 6pm.,,,

13,Valerie M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/22/2018,Found this little hole in the wall place and am so glad I did. Bartender Phil was friendly and seemed to be running the whole joint with only a cook as his partner in crime. It was pretty busy with a steady stream of people but Phil made sure we (and everyone else!) were taken care of and he was great at keeping our glasses full! We had the scallops and they were fantastic. We're looking forward to heading back there soon!,,,
14,Sattra C.,"New York, NY",73,115,375,5.0,4/28/2017,"Beautiful Friday evening in NYC. Yay to good weather! Boomchakala! Casual night; black jeans, white shirt, suspenders, and a vest to complete the look. Oh yeah ;)  Recently been on the lookout for some good wine bars as my appreciation for wine has mature. From this evening experience. I'm definitely  adding Pino Wine Bar to my list. Wonderful ambiance, enjoy the layout of the place, great wine list, and dinner was wonderful from beginning to end. So what did I have for dinner? As you're probably wondering.... maybe or maybe not. Lol. Started off with the seared artichoke hearts; a wonderful simple salad. Second plate, I got the turkey meatball. Very good meatballs, all ingredient counter balance each other well from the mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and the reduced wine sauce. Just another simple dish made well. Lastly, I had their special fillet steak. Saving the best for last. Cheesy mash potatoes perfectly done and the steak was amazingly good. Each bite would just melt in your mouth. arghhhhh. Again another simple dish well made. All in all I had a wonderful dinner and would definitely recommend checking out the place yourself.",2,,
15,Lynn B.,"Manhattan, NY",214,17,2,5.0,1/3/2018,"Ladies if you want a special, small, fabulous place for some girl time, highly recommended! Jay the bartender will totally help you and your group be at ease immediately! You will feel pampered and and well taken care of for a great experience for drinks/ appetizers or a fabulous dinner from the chef! I highly recommend with hesitation because this will only make this fabulous place more crowded...arggg . Putting out the good spirit in the world... a place you should visit!",,,
16,A G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,32,1,1.0,10/13/2017,"The rudest person at a restaurant/bar in NYC.  When our group walked in, he was condescending and told us we cant sit if we dont order food.  Towards the end, my friend was picking his bag under the table when the table wobbled and broke a glass.  He started screaming at us and told us to get the F*** out.  Other reviews also mention of this rude foul mouthed waiter. One of the other guys (also big tall with a beard) said they will get rid of this j**kCrap wines, rude owner/waiter, very loud.  Okay food. Skip.",1,,
17,Jane N.,"BAYSIDE, NY",538,308,339,5.0,6/26/2016,"A step inside Pino makes you forget you're in New York City's Murray Hill neighborhood and not a quaint bar hidden in an alleyway somewhere in San Juan. The small, dim, rustic, unpolished feel of Pino exudes an almost earthy and home-like atmosphere. Everything about this place was memorable, from its infectious 90s summer playlist (cue Wonderwall, Someday and Slide...) and its vast array of wines and beers. The meat and cheese plate was also a home run - need more of that truffle-infused fontina in my life! To top off our night, the bartender, JP, introduced me and my boyfriend to the Moscow Mule, a drink that neither of us have tasted before. It was refreshing -- a perfect drink for the a warm summer evening. He also gave us complementary shots of whiskey as the night winded down -- I'd say this calls for five stars.",4,2,3
18,Nick V.,"Bronx, NY",0,13,0,4.0,8/23/2018,Had a first date here and it was a great time. Obviously the wines were amazing. We had the brussell sprouts and crab mac and cheese and both were perfect. Definitely coming back.,,,
19,Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",495,794,740,2.0,7/4/2017,"The two highlights were the burrata and the Cremant rose. To be honest, the waiter/bartender, he seemed friendly at the outset, but then started to come across as disinterested and cold, yet oddly almost wanted to seem like he was engaged, but didn't really care about you. It was the weirdest interaction as the night went on. We ordered four glasses of wine each throughout the evening and each refill encounter got weirder and weirder. Honestly, if it wasn't so nice sitting outside we probably would have found another watering hole, but we were content with a comfy seat on a wonderful summer night. My tortellini with sausage was just ok. Nothing that I would really come back for. And my friends steak was underwhelming. Filet mignon shouldn't be something that is just ok. I don't think I'll be venturing back when there are plenty of other great wine bars in the city.",1,1,
20,Diana V.,"Queens, NY",57,9,21,5.0,11/26/2016,"Our favorite after work spot in Murray Hill neighborhood. We work literally 2 minutes walking distance to Pino and we finish late, around 11-12 so not many places open till late but Pino does. You can spend time till 2 AM. Daily specials are really good but we are also fan of flat breads. Shrooms is so good. Depending on the crowd, may take 15 to 40minutes, worths the wait.Their wine menu changes from time to time which gives you a reason to visit more often. Employees are all so friendly, Jason and Jay especially. Not proper for dining with a group of more than 4-5 people. If you do not like being arm by arm with people you do not know, you can feel uncomfortable. Just saying. Long live vino and pino :)",4,2,3
21,Michael C.,"Manhattan, NY",76,952,240,3.0,5/30/2017,"Really wanted to love this place, my local bartender had highly recommended Pino to me. To be straight forward, I really enjoyed the food and the drinks selection, but it's just wayyyy too loud in here! By the end of the night I was pretty sure my date and I were yelling at each other (fortunately, not in an angry way). It didn't help that the music was cranked up. I'm not an old fogey, I enjoy my background hum of patrons talking and music playing, but somehow Pino was unbearable. Service was great and attentive and kind. I think I'd be willing to give Pino another chance on an off-time, like the middle of an afternoon, rather than peak dinner time.",3,,

Updated review","Went to Pino's twice,  loved it so much the first time had to go back before we left. Could have gone to many other places, but why try something else after you've found the perfect little wine bar. Food and service were impecible too! Highly recommend!",,,
24,Drea T.,"New York, NY",2,62,2,5.0,5/9/2017,"Rare are the opportunities in which the chef is also the host, the waiter, and part owner. Vino is a true example of a through and true chef putting his everything into the restaurant and producing amazing food. We found a cozy spot at the bar and you'll soon realize how small the place is and be AMAZED at what the chef can do with such limited space. We ordered the griddled spanish octupus, ceviche (it was the dinner special), and roasted baby lamb chops. it was all delicious and served with perfect timing. Just as we wrapped up one plate, the chef would bring another. I highly recommend ordering the baby lamp chops - so good you'll try to eat the bone.",1,,
25,Christopher L.,"East Hampton, NY",5,15,0,5.0,12/11/2017,"The little bar restaurant that could!!! Jesus. Doesn't look like much walking by (décor owners?) but but but don't let that stop you from entering. The entire success and beauty of the establishment comes from its miracle worker inhabitants Jay and Chef Jason. Food first. I've been there almost a dozen times by now and never in my life have I devoured such CONSISTENTLY delicious dishes. Chef Jason (total NY character) is a beast. It literally does not matter what you order, as it will most likely be the best version of whatever item your ordering that you've ever had. Salads boom. Scallops boom. Duck boom. I mean, I don't even like duck and it's now my go to. Reasonably priced too!Service/bar/ambience second. All of these, from what I can tell, are handled by Jay. The first thing I noticed was the music. Hands down the best setlist in NYC. I mean, if some asshole plays bubblegum pop or the Gypsy Kings soundtrack one more time, I'm gonna kill. Moreover, was Jays appearance, his rapporteur w the clientele and his knowledge of the menu/bar was indelible. All done w a smile... he was crazy busy too! Made me feel at home instantly.So go in and introduce yourself to his crime fighting duo and find out the reason why I'll always keep going as long as those two are at the helm. GOOD WORK PEOPLE.",,,
26,Ceren A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1160,1193,7576,5.0,6/5/2016,"It all started weird actually. We wanted to have wine after work and found Pino on Yelp and a colleague strongly recommended the place so here we were. It was about 10.30 PM and interior area was full, only table outside was unattended with 2 glasses on the table so I got inside and asked the guy in the kitchen if it is okay to sit there so he said yes, long story short, while waiting menus, we were informed that the table belongs to other customers. We inquired a table inside and ended up getting one. Tables are literally next to each other so if you are not a person who likes eating and drinking elbow to elbow with other people inside, this place might not be for you. We personally are totally cool with that and I loved their interior design, so simple but classy. Only 2 people works, one in the bar and as a waiter who I also assume to be the business owner, and second person in the kitchen. We got a bottle of Barolo, $81, ordered the plate which includes your choice of 5 item combination of artisanal cheese and charcuterie for $30, we got three meat and 2 cheese, comes with side bread and I guess it was fig jam with a spoon full ricotta cheese. From the flatbreads, we got the ""Shrooms"", $13. I can not complain about even a single item. All were so tasty. We then had 3 more friends joined us and we ordered some more wine by the glass and beer. We were there until he almost kicked us out :) Open till 2 AM everyday so we will definitely be back. We paid about $215 for a bottle of wine, the plate, flatbread, an additional glass of wine, 2 glass of white wine and 2 beers. Thank you guys!",10,5,8
27,David K.,"New York, NY",95,59,445,5.0,6/6/2016,"Hidden gem!!!Now when i got over my emotions about that place i have something to say!First of all we didnt even planned to be here yesterday, cause we got friends waited for us in the club already but in the other hand we had another friends who invited us for a ""glass of wine""! I felt really bad, so we decided first catch up with our friends in Pino and i'll tell you that was the greatest idea! So lets get it started!Its kinda hard to find them cause there is no sign outside but as soon as you got in you want to stay here forever! Cozy place, around 6-7 tables close to each other and 4-6 chairs in the bar! Classic rock music!Our friends already killed the half of the bottle of 2011 Rocca Giovanni, Barolo $81 and were looked really satisfied also they ordered some kinda mixed cheese platter with some meat $30!My friends ordered wine by glass and i got Jameson on the rocks (cause it was kinda pre game before the storm night in the club so i was not about to mix drinks) but i swear next time (which i feel gonna be soon) i'll go with wine menu to the fullest!Staff members in face of Chef and Waiter/Bartender were really nice and helpful! I guess this place is gonna be my go to place for a long time! See you guys soon!",3,1,2

I went with some friends and we split a few appetizers, recommended by our server. We started with a salmon ceviche, which was super fresh and flavorful. The scallop on specia were the best scallops I have ever eaten - definitely give them a try! The turkey meatballs in Marsala wine sauce were absolutely delicious, another must-try.",,,

The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Unlike some other bars in the area, the food is very well made here. I've had the caramelized brussel sprouts for starters. For dinner, favorites have been the smoked short ribs flatbread with goat cheese and red wine onions as well as  the roasted baby lamb chops with thyme bread crumbs. Let say nothing I've tasted on other people's plates had been bad. Overall, it's a real foodies bar, with a nice unpretentious crowd.

We ordered the shroom flatbread, which ended up being the highlight of the meal and one of the best things I ever ate. The scallops and artichoke salad were good, but nothing spectacular. The beer and wine was slightly pricier than others in the area.Service was great. This place was pretty much run by 2 guys that were running around the 20 person max restaurant trying to make sure that everyone was having a great time. They were nice and as attentive as can be.The place is a fine date spot, even though it is small and you are close to the next table. It boasts dim lighting and soft music that allows for a a pretty intimate setting.I would come back to this place again. Definitely should not come here with more than a party of 4.

When he mentioned the specials, his eyes lit up and you could feel his excitement about the dishes. That made our experience feel special. The food came out promptly and tasted wonderful. We opted for the F.I.G. J.A.M. Flatbread and the Lobster Bisque Special. Both were bursting with all the right flavors. I highly recommend both. The price you pay for what you are getting is fair. The wine was good and the waitress was very helpful with recommendations.

Took coworkers here from out of town and we had a blast. It's a tight space but it just makes the meal more cozy! Loved the décor with the exposed bricks and high top tables. We ordered all of the specials which consisted of Beef Wellington, Filet, Lobster Ravioli and then we ordered from the menu the Grilled Octopus and the Shroom Flatbread.

I am rarely impressed because NYC is food mecca but I was delighted to discover that the octopus here knocked out the octopus that originally held the #1 spot on my list. The portions are tiny and menu items are pricey but deservingly so. We ordered the crab cakes $15, shroom flatbread $13, and octopus for $15. The space is very tiny, crowded, extremely loud but we loved the single table situated right outside where we had more space and less less noise. Service was attentive considering we were removed from the rest of the crowd. I recommend Pino for those that truly appreciate exquisite flavors.",3,,1

I've never met a chef so passionate about his food.

My scallops were burnt on one side and gritty on the other, couldn't tell if it were remnants of the blow torch used on everything on the menu or a poorly cleaned grill. 2 points for the exceptional resling...I'll buy the bottle online and enjoy it in the comfort of my home.

The atmosphere was chill and the music was good and not too loud that we could still hear each other. The figjam pizza was delicious, the sweet jam and the tangy blue cheese was a really nice combo. Would go back again!",,,
51,G M.,"Woodside, NY",1,54,42,5.0,3/10/2016,"Very cool place. The bartender was friendly and the chef- owner very accommodating. Great for couples as the place is not very big.  The kitchen is right there in front of you and the chef cooks everything in plain sight.  The menu is small yet creative.  Ask about the specials for more substantial choices.  Now about the food.  We each had the NY Strip, pepper crusted and grilled to absolute perfection. Did I mention cooked to perfect temperature.  In my opinion, the steaks had the taste and texture equivalent to a Prime Steak.  Better than many of the Fancy well known Steak Houses at 1/2 the price. EXCELLENT.   We also shared the grilled artichoke salad and had some great wine.  Overall, a cool little place with great good.  My new place for a great steak.  Hopefully the steak becomes a regular menu item.",,,

The service is unique as the chef himself brought over our dishes once they were prepared. I was torn when writing a review for this place because I think it deserves to be successful, but I don't want to give away how wonderful this place is!The only downside (but not worth taking away a star), is that it got a little too noisy in there for my taste.Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!",,,

54,Sarah J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",39,1,0,2.0,2/8/2017,"This place has a cool vibe, but they won't let you sit down unless you order a full meal, and it's ""intimate"" to say the least. My husband and I went in for a drink and some apps, and the bar was totally full (people standing too), but there was a wall of empty tables. The two guys working there were both incredible rude and one pointed at a single stool for the two of us. It was a Wednesday night... if they can afford to turn away business, bully for them. But why be dicks about it? We left.",,,
55,Kate B.,"Manhattan, NY",84,37,8,3.0,8/4/2015,"I was a little disappointed when coming here Saturday night. I am a relentless review-er and rely on my fellow Yelpers.My boyfriend and I met another couple we know here Saturday night. I think the bartender and the chef were fill ins, as the bartender said he was filling in and didn't know anything about wine. Which might not be the best guy filling in....We ordered a few glasses of wine each, but he couldn't tell us much about them. We also ordered food, meatballs, scallops and flatbreads. The food took a really really long time. There is only one chef and it's a small prep area. Although the restaurant itself is like 6-7 tables, so very small. We noted that it seemed others were concerned about how long it was taking to get food etc.Food arrived, it was okay. It was good. Nothing stellar or what the reviews previously gave an impression of. We will come back and try to see if we just came on an off night. A tad expensive for having spent $200 on wine and mediocre food",2,,

We started with a delicious bottle of wine recommended by the hostess, and we knew it was going to be a good night. Behold! The special dish of the night (gnocchi with lobster and shrimp...wowza) was the cherry on top of the already existing menu items. The truffle turkey meatballs speak for themselves (AMAZE) and the brussel sprouts on the side was the perfect compliment to our meal. The flatbreads were flying out of the kitchen like hot cakes. You do the math. The open kitchen made you feel like you were cooking with Chef Jason as he joyously prepared the meals and sang along to the catchy tunes playing. The mood lighting made it a romantic space yet was the perfect environment for catching up with my gal pal. Oh, I will be back! Murray hill, game on.",3,1,1

The chef was so friendly and recommended this steak special that was mind-blowingly good. It probably also helped that I basically downed an entire bottle of sparkly rose by myself beforehand. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a nice seared outside. The sauce that it was served with was heavenly as well. I can't wait to be back to try more from the menu!,2,1,1

Met a friend for a glass of wine and stumbled upon this hidden gem!  Not only was the wine great (I highly recommend the Malbec), but the food was phenomenal. We weren't even sure we were going to eat anything but we couldn't resist when we saw and smelled everything. We started with a cheese plate and some delicious prosciutto - such a great deal - you get a decent amount and it's high-quality stuff :) Then we had the brussel sprouts and the special - the Kobe beef meatballs. I am STILL dreaming about those (dear Jason, please make those a regular item!!) The place is cool because you watch Jason (the chef/owner) cook right in front of you and everything is cooked to perfection. We thought we were done, but we saw someone order an incredible crab mac and cheese and we couldn't resist. it was perfect. Everything was so flavorful and fresh - we'll definitely be back. Such a cozy little intimate spot - great for chilly fall or winter nights. I can't wait to go back and try all the different flatbreads and these crab cakes that I keep reading so much about!",2,,

Taste a couple before you decide. Sit a while.  Move over so others can crowd into the bar. Meet someone else. Order one thing (mozzarella with tomato and basil pesto and a crazy delicious white balsamic concoction; one good choice among many). Compliment the chef. He's right there, cooking in plain sight. Two guys run the whole place on a busy night. Then order something else. If the special is filet mignon then order that. The bartender may guess how you like it. Been there just once but I will fight you for what I now hope becomes my regular seat in the corner by the window. Enjoy.",,,
77,Sue O.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",34,63,14,5.0,6/24/2014,"La-la-la-LOVE this place! It was actually by serendipity that I found Pino because it is easy to miss. It is literally a hole in the wall, but I mean that in the best way possible.  Something about the quaintness and simplicity of it made me want to check it out. Dani the hostess/waitress/somm/whatever else is so personable and friendly.  On my first visit, I was sold on the white sangria (and I am not an easy sell on white sangria-at all). It was light and refreshing without being overly sugary sweet or puckery. The turkey meatballs are my favorite so far but I still have some venturing to do. The buffalo mozzarella salad is amazing! Ask if they have any specials- I was pleasantly surprised w a tuna tartar dish not on the menu. This is probably a spot reserved for date night or where to bring a girl friend who just got dumped and needs some consoling, or just catching up-not a double date or party/dinner place. Really intimate vibe. It is my belief that anyone who doesn't like this place is a lame, sad, lonely person who doesn't understand the concept of a wine bar.",3,,2

102,Noah X.,"New York, NY",0,26,0,4.0,2/23/2015,"Murray Hill is one less Tonic and a few more Pinos away from being a great neighborhood.  Yes, the East 33rd street location of a sophisticated, handsome wine bar will throw you for a total loop.  But most of my fellow Yelpers below have hit the nail on the head:  Pino is proof that this neighborhood is not entirely soulless.  In refreshing contrast to, say, Windsor Court or Brother Jimmy's, Pino is a very small operation.  What you see when you walk into this little nook of a wine bar is exactly what you get.  All of the food is prepared by one chef, behind the counter -- there's no separate kitchen, or even room to store the numerous cardboard boxes of stuff that are piled underneath the banquets that line the walls.  At times, one could even say Pino feels too small -- on a busy night, one of our orders slipped through the cracks, and with tables so closely packed together, loud patrons adjacent to us made it difficult to hear or carry on a conversation for a portion of the evening.  But these trifling inconveniences were hardly enough to mar what was an otherwise terrific experience.  Without our so much as mentioning the long wait time for our mac n cheese, Pino apologized graciously and told us it was on them.  Truth be told, I would have waited longer for it and paid had I known how good it would be.  The turkey meatballs and flatbreads were savory and delicious, and paired quite well with our wine.  Indeed, the wine list here is not as extensive as you might expect from a wine bar, but the wines available are high quality, appropriately varied, and fairly priced.  And ultimately, there is a pleasant feeling about this little place -- it is both trendy and energetic yet quaint and charming all the same.  The only thing you have to wonder is whether the neighborhood's residents deserve such a nice place.  Hopefully, they take good care of it.",1,,

104,B N G.,"Bayside, NY",0,38,0,1.0,9/1/2016,I emailed this wine bar the day before to make sure they would be open at 4:30pm on a Saturday.  I received a response after 2 attempts and several unanswered phone calls to the only phone # listed which is a cell phone.  In the reply I received I was assured they would be open and to come on down.  So we took 6 of our friends with us only to find out it was closed on that Saturday at 4:30pm.   Very considerate.   So we took our business across the street and had great apps and wine at Cask Bar & Kitchen.  Go there instead.,,,
105,Tom B.,"Rochester, NY",1,35,0,4.0,1/27/2015,"Following the advice of fellow Yelpers we tried this joint on a cold January evening. We instantly found an attractive selection from their limited wine menu - a Nero d'avola - which was both complex yet medium bodied. It matched well with our small plate choices of shrimp enchilada followed by crab cakes with a smoky chipotle twist. Be warned that chef/owner Justin Bunin likes his spices but, even for my wimpy Irish palate, it was manageable... And interesting. We ended the meal with a tasty cheese plate augmented with a dab of fig & cherry compote. The sound track of the evening was distinctly non-wine bar soft jazz but rather, like the seasoning, spicy. A thoroughly enjoyable intimate evening.",1,,

Food prices expected as well. Food - don't eat it. The tuna tartar was the most appetizing. It was kind of like a glorified salsa. Some cubed tuna and heavy on chunks of avocado. The preparation of the brussel sprouts hurt the brussel sprouts' integrity. Burnt and bland with undercooked cocktail onions. No flavoring. Not even salted. The octopus was simply inedible. Once again, burnt, and then they were killed by an overwhelming amount of balsamic vinegar. At this point we had no desire to taste the greens that came with it. The waitress ignored the fact that we didn't eat any of the food and didn't even ask if we wanted another glass of wine to wash it down. Chef seemed to care but not enough to prepare the food. Ugh.",3,,

Tapas were small but perfect for sharing.  My wine choice was not fabulous but that was my fault they definitely have a sizable collection for just a glass or two. Last but not least, I always want just a taste / bite of dessert....this place gives you a spoonful of their chocolate mousse like it was a lollipop....it was AMAZING!

113,John F.,"Richmond Hill, NY",0,2,0,1.0,8/28/2015,"Every now and then you come across a place that doesn't look like much but the food is amazing!  Sadly, this doesn't apply to Pino. My Sig Other and I can deal with poor decor but not when it's paired with public school cafeteria fare. We ordered four dishes to share: octopus, crab cakes, crab Mac & cheese,  and the ""famous"" turkey meatballs. We were hungry! Our server was very pleasant and quickly put our order in. She did a nice job. The food was taking a while so we gave a few glances into the kitchen (using the term loosely inasmuch as it consisted of an electric griddle, a small electric box oven, a prep area that was as spacious as a bathroom vanity, but no judgments at this point).  The first plate the the cook brought over was the octopus: I've chewed rubber with more flavor (it's true - bad time in my life then). Next the crab cakes: they were brown, like paper bag brown, and about as tasty. I knew they were frozen because they tasted like the fish sticks I had as a kid (we were poor and couldn't get real fish but I ain't poor no more and want real fish).  So on to the crab Mac & cheese or should I say shells and cheese. Did I see the Kraft box in the garbage? Can't be, Kraft HAS flavor. I think he waved some imitation crab over the top because no crab in there. We weren't happy and they knew it! While waiting for our flatbread turkey MB with no bacon we were told he forgot not to put bacon on it (seriously, there was one other table that had an order).  I ask for the check and we're brought the flatbread, she says it's on the house. Ok, so we have to try: they charge $17 for a thin half round of bread topped with tasteless white cheese two MB'S halved and what appeared to be wilted basil. Embarrassing. The cherry on top: inside of the freshly defrosted MB was PINK. Rule one: poultry can't be pink. Last be surely not least the cook needs a new hat: wearing a filthy hat backwards may be cool with the frat crowd but not around food you are charging for.",2,,
114,Lynn M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,4/3/2014,"Never did I imagine there would be an opportunity for me to say ""This place is a Murray Hill gem.""  The wine, food and service were all exquisite.Pino opened just three weeks ago, but it's clear Executive Chef, Jason, has been in the hospitality industry for much longer.  This charming twenty-two seat restaurant and bar occupies a tiny space converted from a dry cleaners.  Five high-top, two-top banquettes line the right side of the space and a thin unfinished wood bar with twelve seats lines the left side.  The Executive Chef and one bartender/server service the entire space together.My party and I ordered a glass of wine, and Jason made an immediate suggestion that we try the Torrentes, a smooth, white Argentinean wine, instead.  The server offered us both a proper taste before we each agreed to a glass.  Exceptional service in my book.To start, we ordered the wedge salad, a take on the classic made with endive, arugula and mixed greens rather than iceberg lettuce, with house-made blue cheese dressing.  I'm not sure who this wouldn't appeal to.  The dressing was divine and the bacon was more like thick cut pieces of pancetta.We followed the salad up with the clam flatbread (it definitely has a more appealing name on the menu that eludes me at the moment).  This was beyond delicious.  Every element of the flatbread was perfection.  The clams, fresh from Long Island, tasted amazing; the flatbread itself was crisp, thin and delicious; the additional toppings: a few cherry tomatoes and a bit of cheese, married so well with the other ingredients.  Sh!t, this was the best damn flatbread I've ever had.  Seriously.At this point, chef could tell we were thoroughly enjoying ourselves, and sent over a canapé: house-made honey ricotta with rehydrated figs and cranberries atop a small slice of baguette.  It's difficult for me to describe this bite any further without using expletives.  It was the best food of the evening.  The ricotta was infused with honey and a few other ingredients and had a viscous consistency similar to a thick, homemade whipped cream.  I could have eaten ten more.We closed the meal out with the pan seared scallops served over mixed greens.  This, of course, was delicious: the scallops being cooked to a perfect medium rare and the sauce marrying aioli and sriracha, I mean I would've eaten that aioli off of pigs' feet had it come served on that.We were already thoroughly satisfied, but the chef didn't stop there.  He topped off our glasses of wine and brought us each a spoon full of his delectable chocolate mouse.This small place is fabulous, and Executive Chef Jason is well on his way to winning a following with  equal parts personality and absolutely sapid dishes.",3,1,1
115,Kristina H.,"Manhattan, NY",14,13,0,5.0,8/18/2014,"Such a hidden gem. The bacon small plate was amazing. The food is good, but the atmosphere is even better. They play classic rock and a ton of other good music (and loud!!)  and it's such a great place for a date or to come with friends.",1,,
116,Amanda F.,"Nassau, NY",88,27,1,4.0,7/24/2014,"We need more places like this in the area.  The green tea sangria is amazing and the various flatbreads and crab cakes they had were yummy!! We also had one of their ceviches (although I cannot remember exactly what it was).  I just remember it was amazing.  The only thing that did not do it for us was the turkey meatballs.  They were just ok, however the rest of the meal was great. In addition, the place is adorable! Just what the area needed....",1,,
117,Elizabeth H.,"Brightwaters, NY",0,9,1,4.0,1/26/2015,The food was delicious and served quickly.  The chef/owner was very attentive and gave generous pours of wine. Go if you are in the wasteland of Murray Hill.,,,

122,Heather B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,79,0,5.0,6/19/2014,"Really enjoyed Pino.  It was a bit hard to find so found myself at Middle Branch first by accident.  We sat at the bar and I asked for a drink menu.  It wasn't crowded so the bartender informed me that when it's not crowded they like to interact a bit with the patrons so why I don't tell her what I like and she'll give me some samples of things she thinks I'll like to try.  It worked perfect, she gave me a wine that was great for me.  We also were sitting quite close to the chef and got to speak to him about some of the dishes.  Everything was outstanding.  Especially the crabcakes.  As mentioned below, there was no breading and no mayo, just crab.  Also really enjoyed the scallops and a few of the veggie side dishes.  I highly recommend Pino, it was a great spot for a date or to catch up with a friend.  Since its nice and cozy, you're better off going early and with fewer people to get some of these coveted chairs.",,,
123,Alexandria S.,"Jersey City, NJ",366,3,0,5.0,8/20/2014,"My new fav spot. Food is amazing, owners are hilarious, phenomenal wine, and great music. I stopped here after a late day at work and for a drink on the weekend and became addicted. I love it.",,,

125,Arlene C.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1,3,0,5.0,11/21/2014,"PINO Wine Bar - OMG - amazing - we were supposed to go across the street but were told we were too early, go across the street for a glass of wine and never left. We had 5 apps and one was better than the other. Jason was as sweet as could be. I highly recommend this amazing joint.",,,
126,Fiona S.,"London, United Kingdom",0,3,0,5.0,11/20/2014,"I never go to Midtown, but a friend was in town and recommended we try this place out. And now I have a reason to go back to this area. It was a cold Monday evening and Jay and Jason (I think were there names) were super attentive. One was the chef and the other the bartended/server. I ordered a bottle of red wine and they had me try 5 different types of wine until I found the one I liked. And they were generous 'taster' glasses. I was already on my way before the bottle was even opened!!! :) We decided the let them decide what to give us in terms of tapas and every dish blew my mind: scallops, jumbo prawns, yummy Brussels spouts (yes it's possible), bacon in maple syrup etc etc etc. I really loved the way the dishes complemented each other. The venue was quiet as it was Monday, but still cosy and charming. Great service, fun times, good food and great wine. Will be back again!",,,
127,Christian S.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",5,9,4,4.0,8/12/2014,"Don't judge this place by its size, this hole in the wall is packing some serious flavor and selection.

128,Laura L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0,5.0,7/13/2014,"Delicious food, drinks.. Perfect date night place with my husband.  Would recommend the bacon, octopus, crab cakes and flat breads!  Will definitely be back!",,,
129,C W.,"Austin, TX",0,6,0,5.0,3/28/2015,"Stopped in on a recent trip. Great selection of wines and even though they were slammed we received OUTSTANDING service from our young female server (I think her name was Mac?).

130,Shiwani N.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",1,28,0,2.0,8/14/2014,Owner was rude. Bartender was rude. Overcharged for drinks and pretended it was tax (it wasn't).Also there were SO many mosquitoes.,,,

I ended up paying $50 with a glass of wine and tapas. I feel like my meal should have been closer to $35.  I think I prefer Cask or a spot outside Murray Hill.",,,
