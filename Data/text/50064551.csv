Nice views of lower manhattan, the bridges , can see the Empire State from a distance There is an inside and an outside.  I like the decor in the inside - even have paintings of musicians like my boo PRINCE :) Drinks ok Music was good Would come back again :)",14,5,10

There's so many Asians here! The rooftop is lovely, there's a decent amount of seats which is likely for reserved guests, and the views are great.",,,
3,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",153,765,9983,4.0,9/29/2018,"After celebrating my bestie's pre-birthday brunch at Rice & Gold, we walked over to the elevator that takes us up to the 21st Floor. There was a podium where a guy checks your Ids then stamped your wrist. The elevator was quite tight space and it freaked me out because we are going up so high man. There was a full bar right in front of the elevators and two doors that lead us to the rooftop. We moved around from one spot to the next to get a better view. Look at those fluffy clouds. Definitely limited cushioned tables so you either wait for someone or a group leaving. There are servers take drink orders but we were just merely enjoying the beautiful view and chilling. Bring a sweater or jacket just in case because it does get windy. Overall very convenient if you are staying in the hotel because you got a restaurant downstairs and a rooftop. This hotel is surrounded by a lot of eateries. I definitely will be stopping by =)",6,1,10
4,Sally W.,"Milwaukee, WI",13,138,85,5.0,9/29/2018,GREAT views! I got the frose. We had just stumbled upon this place and were not really dressed appropriately although no one was looking at us funny. I would say dress attire is what would be appropriate for upscale cocktail bar.,,,
5,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2414,5165,5.0,7/30/2018,"As far as views go, it's hard to find a better one than The Crown.Lots of rooftops in this borough tend to be in Midtown. The problem with that is, some of the most legendary odes to architectural wonderment are in Midtown itself, making it tough to take in the famous skyline when you're sitting smack in the middle of it. With The Crown being as far south as it is, you get a chance to see the entire Midtown skyline with ease, not to mention a nearly 300-degree view of the rest of the city as well. Of course during the summer and on big going out nights (Friday/Saturday) you're likely going to encounter people that you might not otherwise like hanging out around. But bring your own crew and don't let bridge and tunnelers or fist-pumping Goldman Sachs bros ruin one of the best new elevated hangs on the East Coast.",11,5,8

8,Courtney P.,"Sacramento, CA",303,823,745,4.0,9/9/2018,"Visiting my friend in New York City, she brought me to The Crown to enjoy a drink with a view. Located on top of one of the hotels, The Crown had a nice outdoor patio area with comfy seating in which we could take in the views of the city. They had a DJ playing music in the background which was nice and the patio was quite crowded but we did manage to grab one of the sofas. We came in the afternoon but I'm sure this place would be even more stunning at night. The drink prices were a little steep but I have come to expect that when I come to New York City. It cost $18 for a glass of Pinot Noir. They did have an indoor lounge and seating area as well but since it was such a beautiful day and I was there to visit my friend and see the city, we opted to sit outside.",2,,1
9,Charisse S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",130,192,359,4.0,6/9/2018,"I hesitate to review this place because I don't want word to get out and ultimately ruin the experience here, but here it goes. This bar has one of the best views of the city that I've experienced so far. It offered everything you could want in a rooftop bar. I dropped by around 5:30 on a Friday to catch up with a friend over drinks and stayed for about 2 hours. It started to fill up  around 6:30 but it didn't get too crowded or loud. It helps that there's plenty of seating to accommodate people because there's a main outdoor lounge and a smaller one that you can access by going inside and emerging from another exit. The prices are on par with most rooftop places with cocktails starting at $16. The reviews were mixed on the quality of the drinks but I thoroughly enjoyed my watermelon margarita and endless summer. Both drinks suit the vibe and were very  refreshing.  This is definitely the place to be for the summer.",2,,

12,Tran H.,"Azusa, CA",0,4,4,1.0,6/27/2018,"Been partying for the past 20 yrs, all over the world, at some of the most exclusive & swankiest clubs.  Never been treated so poorly til I walked up to this joint. After dinner in Chinatown, a group of 20 friends ventured over to The Crown for drinks.  Approached front of line and met a dude, with spiked hair, from Australia?  Looked like he just rolled out of bed and went to work.  Not a good 1st impression. Anyhow, asked if we can check out the rooftop bar.  He said it was extremely crowded up there.  Then rudely told me, since you have a big group, it's going to cost $1500 for a table.  Seriously?  It's a rooftop bar NOT a high end LV club.  Furthermore, he was selectively profiling, charged entry fee for one group and free for others.  Wtpho!!!  After a heated exchange, we left.  He was a total A-hole!!!  Went to 230 Fifth Rooftop instead.  Got 2 tables with an amazing view of the Empire State bldg & dropped some serious cash!!!  Best of all, we were treated like royalty at 230!I've seen many great clubs, lounges, or so call hotspots fall from its heydays.  1st lesson in mgmt, the customer is always right or at least appease to their requests.  Remember, you need us, we don't need you!!!",5,1,

14,Richard L.,"Queens, NY",825,717,14,3.0,8/3/2018,"I've been here once or twice and it's a rooftop bar.  It's pretty high up as it's the top floor of the hotel and it's pretty spacious.  Not huge, but definitely not small - there is an inside to the rooftop where the bar is and the outside patio that has some wonderful furniture and a good panoramic view of New York.  I believe you look north towards midtown and are even higher than the next closest rooftop bar (over at the Wyndham hotel)Drinks are a bit expensive, but would be average for any other rooftop bar, but remember where you are, you're in the middle of chinatown so it's a bit odd to be paying 13 or 14 dollars for a drinks.  I'd only come here for a special occasion when all my friends are there as well.",,,
15,Alyssa Y.,"New York, NY",72,256,39,5.0,8/3/2018,A big group of friends and I came to celebrate a special occasion at The Crown a couple months ago and it was the best rooftop day drinking experience I've had in ages.The views far surpass that of the neighboring competition and the crowd isn't as obnoxious B&T/college frat bro-esque as Mr. Purple and Jimmy (at least not yet...). The decor is chic and minimalist and the service super friendly. The drinks are nothing to write home about but what are you expecting from a NYC rooftop bar?Chef Dale Talde (the legend!) was just hanging out at the bar and he really looked after our group. Now we're even bigger fans of him and his restaurant group.,,,

The freedom tower is literally above you while the empire State is farther but can be clearly scene as the crown is obscenely high above the masses. My favorite drink here is the crown Manhattan. It is a bit different from the regular drink because of the bitters and schezuan flavors. Giving you a good kick in the gonads in the best way possible, if at all possible. Highly recommend to those still enjoying views of NYC and the summer time. Fair warning that cocktails go for around $16 here.",,,
18,Jay K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/9/2018,"Apparently, this rooftop bar does not allow anyone (ANYONE) to take pictures on its premises using a camera with a detachable lense - so basically, any DSLR camera - unless you obtain a license and insurance from ""the management,"" and apparently, they have a policy to this effect. This is regardless of how much money you are spending on food and/or drinks. So, you cannot take a picture (not even one) of your wife, husband, friend, etc., while visiting the bar. You cannot take a picture of the view (this is a rooftop bar for God's sakes). Well, they say, you can use your cellphone and take as many pictures as you wish, regardless of whether you are even purchasing anything. But, clearly, there are exceptions to this policy - just take a look at the rooftop's IG account instagram.com/thecrownny… . Do you think these pictures are taken using a cellphone? Okay, maybe a few. But all of them?? They also say you cannot stand on any of the furniture and take a picture.. again, take a look at the bar's IG page... The staff are super rude and unprofessional. Especially, the bar manager whose name is Natalya (not sure about spelling). I have worked at high-end restaurants and bars, and she would not even last a day at any of those places with her demeanor and treatment of the customers. The security guard is not any nicer.. If you wanna go to this place anyway, and take a picture, make sure your cellphone is charged.  Don't mind the quality.",,,
19,Kay J.,"Indianapolis, IN",88,30,2,5.0,10/29/2018,"This place was swanky, quiet and the huge windows gave the most impressive views! I enjoyed the comfortable couch and how high up we were. I'd totally come back again. Thanks New York! It's been a fun one :)",,,1
20,Jenn Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",223,169,1452,5.0,6/22/2018,"Its a really cute, classy rooftop bar. They have two sections which I did not discover until later! Once you come up to the elevator, there is the obvious outdoor deck behind the bar. But on the left of the bar, towards the bathroom, there is a long hallway that leads to another door with another outdoor deck. This deck is a little more intimate and you get a stunning view of downtown Manhattan, whereas the other side is of uptown. Waiters/waitresses are nice. Its a great place to bring visitors from out of town!",,,

The cocktails are a little pricey ($16), but I think the venue's atmosphere and views of the NYC skyline makes up for it. I think what surprised me was that the chips and guacamole was $18... which is why I decided to give it a 4 star instead of a 5. The quacamole was decent and could've used a bit more lime juice. All in all, would I come back here? The answer is yes!!! I think it would be a perfect spot to throw a birthday or hang out with a large group.",1,,

Well decorated, good music, DJ on weekends. Cons: the drinks are just okay. They're good but overpriced for what you're getting. Service is nonexistent. I've been several times and have never had a server come up to my table. Sometimes there's someone checking IDs at the door (depends on the time of day I guess) but I've had two occasions where the bouncer has aggressively singled me out from my group and asked for only my ID. That's fine, I look young whatever. But both times the person has been SO rude and condescending about it. There's no need to chuckle at my ID.. tacky behavior at an upscale place. So really the customer service is awful and the view is gorgeous. Go for 1 drink kind of place",1,,

29,Sa K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,1,1.0,6/17/2018,The crown need a new manager! Rude to patrons.  Wanted to charge $50/pp for a party of four meanwhile he let other four ppl groups in for no cover charge.  The blonde short hair manager called himself 'Dennis'.  Our out of town friend stayed in the hotel as well.  Never have seen such rudeness to hotel guests.  Tried to take a picture of him and he ran away (blonde guy in the back with the light jean)We go there every week and we never had a problem.  We will bring our business somewhere else and we will surely send this message to all our friends in the city.,3,,
30,Georg S.,"Centrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",45,2,0,1.0,6/2/2018,"We were a big group going to the crown after our dinner at Eleven Madison Park to enjoy a nice drink and the view. Unfortunately our night was completely ruined by the manager of the rooftop bar who called himself Dennis (I would lie about my name if I was this poor about my job so I'm uncertain about his real name).He chose to throw me out after I was physically attacked by a patron who knocked a drink out of my hand and went on to claim that the drink he spilled ruined his sneakers. I couldn't believe the reaction of the patron so I politely asked ""sorry what?"" He repeated that I ruined his sneakers. I was perplex and decided to flip him off. So that patron grabbed me straight by the neck and choked me fiercely. I wrangled loose and walked away while security took the patron and threw him out.However I was thrown out a couple of seconds later by the manager ""Dennis"" because he said I would also have chocked you if you would flip me off. We had lawyers in our group and debated the correctness of his statement. In fact the security of the club came to us and apologized after Dennis' reaction and assured us that it was not their opinion but had to follow his orders. All in all a poor experience even though the rooftop is very nice and the people that work there seemed nice too except for Dennis, who clearly is new at his job and should be doing something a little bit simpler where he doesn't have authority to break laws.We won't be back but wish the place all the luck in the world to find a better manager.",4,1,

Its panoramic views of lower Manhattan are stunning, making it a highlight of the newly opened hotel - and the first of its kind in Manhattan's Chinatown.The cocktail menu is in keeping with 50 Bowery's modern design with Asian elements -  its signature drinks include the Black Dragon Tea (vodka, oolong tea and spiced kalamansi) and the East India (gin, pimm's, lemongrass, cucumber, and lime). Small bites begin at 2 pm here. Drinks available starting noon and open til 2 a.m. Also there are two terraces - the ""West Terrace"" is smaller and separate from the rest of the lounge... would be great for a private party of ~20 people.

I went during off season - it was too cold to be outside - but the interior bar is quite large as well. Friendly staff.

I think the cocktails are only alright. They're overpriced in the sense of the way it tastes. The only way I can justify the price is basically the view and lounging. But otherwise, cocktails aren't amazing. I wish it was better..I haven't tried the food here yet and I'm actually not sure if I will. From the looks of the menu, the food looks ridiculously expensive. I rather go downstairs to Rice & Gold and eat there if I were to order food.Overall, I like coming here and I will return.. but.. probably will just share a drink with a friend or order a Whisky neat (unless that's overpriced as well). We'll see. But honestly, I'm pretty disappointed with how their cocktails taste. I've tried their Toki Highball and their Oolong cocktail--both meh. I wanted to like it but... meh.. It's not worth $16.",3,,1

We came here on a Saturday evening and it wasn't packed at all. The bar was not crowded and had a lot of room. So I didn't see how it was possible that other ppl were being served before us as three of my other friends stood along the bar, made eye contact w the bartender, and still wasn't approached by them. This happened on two separate occasions that night. Normally bartenders would at least acknowledge you and let you know they'll be right with you. They looked at us and started restocking and cleaning the tumblers right after just serving a customer next to us. I say go for the views, take your photos and spend your money somewhere else!",1,,

I first came here around two weeks ago with coworkers, we work in Wall St, close by. It was nice, nice views, yeah...it is a rooftop but nothing special or different from many others in NYC. We just walked in with no issues, had a drink... all good. Then I went back this past Friday with my husband and a friend visiting from Seattle to show him the ""views"" and it was a terrible experience... it was not even 10PM, the girl at the door said there a minimum spend of $150 if we wanted to go to the bar... seriously? I got there like 4min later and didn't hear all the excuses she gave but I tried to say this is not true, I've been here before.. and she said ""Well you need reservations""... mmm. No... Again... ""I've been here before"" and just walked in... Plus I tried to make reservations online and the web kept giving ""error requests""... Get it together, I am a marketing manager, that's not good user experience! If you are full, say it, don't give error page messages...I can't say they turned us down because of the ""looks"" ... for sure that never happened to me or my husband before, we go to way more upscale places than this. Our west coast friend.. well, he is a Seattle boy but still wearing a polo and very polite.... I really hope this has nothing to do with the fact that my husband is African American of course, since he is the one who got there first and asked... He is a high executive in an advertising agency but you never know...  He just didn't want to deal with the stupidity so we left right away, then I decided to go back and asked the lady (aka.... blonde taki girl at the door feeling cool) what was their policy to understand what just happened and then she said that night they have a ""private party of 500 people"" ... Oh! So now it is this? Right... and when I suggested that we felt turned down then her and the dude next to her apologized and tried to be nice... well, guess what? I checked with the place 30min later and they said they were ""less busy"" than usual.... I texted my coworkers to tell them and they couldn't believe it!

On a return visit, a group of us 2 girls and 2 guys couldn't get in at 9pm on a weekend night, they said bottle service only. The people going up seemed like a more ratchet crowd than a year ago too.

If you're looking for a not very crowded rooftop to go to with a really nice view of the city, this is the spot as I assume not many people will know this place exist.This spot has the look of what used to be a penthouse suite that was turned into a bar, so the atmosphere of the bar and lounge area has this very unique feel as they keep the appearance that you were invited to let's say John Legend's penthouse party with a bar smack in the middle of the suite.Drinks and cocktails are standard NYC price so can't really complain there. The bartenders are very friendly and helpful. Didn't try any of the food there so you'll have to go off of someone else's review for that or try it for yourself and let me know!",2,1,1

I witnessed staff being rude to guests, staff putting hands on people to drag them off the balcony, people bribing staff so they could actually get to see what they already paid for, and people doing drugs and staff looking the other way. Overpriced drinks, no views of the fireworks, and unbelievably overcrowded. Horrible experience.",4,,

And the guy blocking off the roofdeck was straight out of ""Knocked Up"" doorman obnoxious. Letting some people in and blocking others completely subjectively, being super rude to guests who were legitimately upset their ticket was misleading. I guess this is New York for you. Just a word of warning. Definitely never pay for any party here. They don't care. Unless you're paying thousands for bottle service, which probably also isn't worth it. Crowd is whatever. You can probably find just as interesting people talking to the person next to you on the street/subway. DJ was pretty good though.",17,3,1

49,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,615,558,3.0,7/3/2017,"Nice, new rooftop bar I cannot deny that this lounge is the business, especially on a nice NYC summer night. The views from the roof top are absolutely amazing. I do not know if the secret is out of the bag, regarding this place, but it was not super packed on the Thursday night that we visited. Many of the rooftop bars in the city are so crowded that it takes the fun out of being on a roof top. Two out of the three bartenders were really great. The other one  . . . was not too friendly. Sometimes bartenders and servers in the nicer establishments tend to have superior, holier than thou attitudes. You know, like the customer is bothering them by requesting drinks. Like I said only one of the bartenders had this issue and I generally stayed away from her. I want my drinks served with smile (or a basic poker face) not with an attitude. The lounge has a very interesting and diverse cocktail list.I did not try one of the fun cocktails (I'm more of a 2-3 ingredient cocktail type of guy) but my friends were happy with their selection of drinks. Most of the drinks are in the 16 dollar range, which may seem expensive, but the cost is in line with many rooftop bars in the city. One slight annoyance. Upon arriving to the roofI was told that I had to check my bag. Actually a hostess followed me to the bar to inform me of this policy. OK no problem; the bag check was free. My annoyance came, because I saw SEVERAL people sporting backpacks inside and outside of the the lounge. Maybe those folks slipped by and I was singled out. Again, it was not a big deal but it stood out a bit for me.",5,,

Gotta pay to play. Few tourists and entitled people don't understand this concept, but go to any other nice rooftop and it is the same policy. Most of the time, it's much more $$$. The hotel rooms are spacious and luxurious. It's nice to go up to the rooftop for breakfast but can somebody do something about all the sunlight?

The rooftop area was closed off for bottle service guests only, ticket holders were getting thrown out of the roof area. Paid $60 for this but I know some other people paid upwards of $140 for the same tickets with the promise of fireworks view.

57,Sina A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,6/8/2018,"We had a really bad experience here mainly because of the manager, Dennis. In short: my friend was assaulted by another patron -- people can be drunk and stupid, but there is no excuse for laying hands on another person. And Dennis, the manager, observing the situation initially did the right thing and escorted this person out. But then Dennis quickly failed in his job. 1. Dennis didn't get a copy of the guy's identification, but asked for a copy of my friend's ID (strange approach). My friend wanted to file a police report but couldn't because Dennis had a backward approach. 2. Dennis kicked our entire group out because we were with a person who was the victim of an assault (because that's the appropriate way to treat a victim?). Not to mention that two of those in our group were actually staying in the hotel -- so you spend hundreds of dollars a night to stay in a hotel, your friend gets assaulted in the hotel bar, there is not only no recourse for justice but you also can't enjoy the rest of your night. In sum, the Crown really needs to get a new manager! The appropriate way for Dennis to have handled the situation would have been: He kicks out the perpetrator of the assault after first getting a copy of his ID so the victim can press charges if he wishes, then apologize to the victim for the incident occurring under his watch and offer the victim a new drink as the $20 cocktail he just paid for was knocked out of his hand by a drunk and aggressive patron.

Before this place opened, I would normally take people from out-of-town to Mr. Purple. There is no competition, The Crown is now my go-to spot for visitors. I've been here a few times during the day and at a night and it's never too obnoxiously crowded. I have noticed that the crowd tends to be a little fratty during the day. The cocktails are pretty good -- they're typical New York rooftop bar prices. The East India is my favorite. Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed!",1,,

When we arrive to the rooftop we were kindly greeted by a waitress and she offered us a table to serve us. 30 minutes later we were told to move because a party who reserved the table arrived. The waitress never told us before we sat down or were we given another table. We told the manager and the host but did not get an explanation or apology.

67,Nishan K.,"New York, NY",258,199,6,3.0,9/24/2017,"The Crown is one of the newest rooftops to open up in NYC.  Normally, I dread coming to Chinatown, because it's (i) full of tourists crammed onto the streets, (ii) dirty and noisy, and (iii) generally unpleasant.  But I made an exception to check out The Crown because I heard good things from friends.  Located in the newly constructed Hotel 50 Bowery, it's a little set off from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown, which is nice.  The interior is classy and fairly spacious with several couches.  There are two outdoor areas.  The one closest to the entrance and bar is the largest and most crowded and has a very nice view of the NYC skyline in the distance.  There's a second smaller outdoor area towards the back, which has views of downtown Manhattan and was empty that day. I've been told the bar is crowded during happy hours after work.  On the Saturday afternoon I was there, it was full but not crowded.  The bartender was very nice and made us some cocktails off the menu, which were tasty, albeit pricier than necessary at $16 a pop (though not unexpected at new rooftop bar in the city). I wasn't a huge fan of the Thai Basil Watermelon Margarita, which sounds better than it actually tasted.  The Black Dragon Tea and Crown Manhattan are better choices in my opinion. The Crown isn't a rooftop that I would seek out compared to some of the others options in the city.  But if I'm in the Chinatown area for some odd reason, I would definitely pop in to take in the view, get some fresh air, and have a drink with a friend.",2,,1
68,Kimberly P.,"New York, NY",336,64,40,4.0,6/10/2018,One of my favorite rooftop bars by far. The entrance is inside a restaurant through a side elevator that will lead you directly to the bar. I recommend coming about 1-2 hours before sunset so you can enjoy the full rooftop experience with a beautiful vibrant skyline. The drinks were super delicious and equally strong. Don't let the reserved plate scare you off from sitting down bc everyone was just sitting wherever they liked. Of course ask first haha. My only complaint was the ridiculous wait to order drinks. There were literally only two bartenders serving 50+ people.,,,

Usual high price for a rooftop bar of $15-20 each.- all tables had reserved signs on them, yet no one was sat there for hours...we eventually took one but be good if they make it clearer as it seems silly to not let people sit down when there are various tables free- service is bad. We ordered bar snacks, was told there is no table service so had to order at the bar. They also wouldn't bring it to us so told us to come back in 5 minutes. It wasn't ready. Same again 10 mins later. And again. We never got those snacks (it was only guac!) so 40 mins after ordering we gave up and headed to Chinatown for some food instead! Do not come here hungry!!",3,,

Updated review","I had a great time at the crown this evening but the drinks tasted strange and everything was very pricy. Our group had a separate area which was equipped with comfy couches and tables. We ordered many of the signature drinks which were all very strong. We had carafes of the Thai basil watermelon Margarita, black dragon tea and the crown manhattan. The drinks were very pricy and had strange flavors I was not accustomed to. Our group also ordered party sized guacamole, ceviche, mini hot dogs and eggplant dip. The views are gorgeous and perfect for enjoying some of the many bottles of rose we enjoyed. The views and seating is great overall a really awesome place to relax and enjoy the sunset on a nice summer night. I would definitely recommend The Crown if you are celebrating a specially occasion and plan to order bottle service. I just wish they had more options for food especially during happy hour. P.S. there is a DJ during the week so be ready to enjoy some great music!",2,,
75,Lois R.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,2.0,1/20/2018,"The views are gorgeous.

77,Matt G.,"Hillsboro, OR",17,3,2,1.0,7/20/2018,I visited this rooftop bar with my girlfriend and another couple( we are Asian) today and was in disbelief. We walked up to the bouncer and was told that males were not allowed to wear shorts. Being that it was a Friday night we totally understood and stepped back to call out other friends to let them know what was going on. As I sat there in a calm matter... I was in shock when I saw that another group of people (caucasian) walked up and there was one person wearing shorts and the bouncers let them go straight up. I was so angry that racism is still alive and I will not be coming back and I will make sure to let al my friends know how rude and unprofessional this establishment is.

I then took my party of 12 people elsewhere because this type of service rubbed me the wrong way. Could not reason with the English accent employee on the ground floor and unfortunately their ""policy"" is turning away guests as I also saw many others with clean shorts getting turned away as well. Again this was 80 degrees at 10pm. My advice guys- be more flexible and don't ruin people's Friday nights with your policies, shorts isn't that serious.",1,,

I would rate them a 7.5/10 from my personal experience. The vibe is pretty nice and they have a good area to chill outside or lounging around on the inside. They have two balconies to catch a nice view of the city although the one in the front is not as good since the seats block the side of balcony keeping you from really getting close to the edge to enjoy the view.

We were at the roofdeck and saw an empty table, we confirmed with one of the staff that the table was free and that we could definitely sit there. About 15min later, a very snooty female usher/host told us to leave because the table was reserved. When we said that another waitstaff had confirmed that the table was free, she again very brusquely insists that the table was only bottle service and we should pay 600 bucks for a party of 5 if we wanted to continue to sit there. So, I have a couple of issues with this:1. Rude rude rude behavior. Your staff told us to sit there, the least you could do was politely ask us to leave and explain the mix up. NBD. 2. Lies- The table was NOT reserved nor not exclusive to bottle service as (a) similar tables had parties with no bottles and single serve drinks, and (b) after we left, a couple came to sit there, again with single drinks and NOT bottle service3. RUDE RUDE RUDE. We were considering leaving but wandered inside instead to finish our drinks. The service and staff indoors were so different from the outdoors area.

I booked a table here 2 weeks in advance for a birthday -- going off a recommendation from a friend who frequents this place. My reservation was not on their list & I had to show them an email for proof. They had to ask another group to move to make room for us. Reservation was for 14 people, but the area we got only seated 5/6 comfortably. When I asked about the space, the servers kept saying ""we're working on it"" to no avail. We ordered bottle service & asked for soda as a mixer but got sparkling water instead. The bar didn't have Hennessy. (Found this odd.) The music was subpar. I went on a cold night so we couldn't use the outdoor seating, but the view is nice from the moments I did spend out there. This would be an okay spot to stop by for a quick drink with a friend, but nothing too special to go out of your way for.",1,,
90,saloni s.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,5.0,7/24/2017,"Excellent birthday experience this past weekend! I never post reviews (laziness plus indifference get the better of me) but I was compelled to write this review as Kari (events coordinator), Valerie (manager) and their team made this a truly memorable experience for not just me but my entire party. We all spoke of their highly attentive, personalized service that went above and beyond, especially given the busy/lively atmosphere of the place. They were really flexible to accommodate our needs (including changing our required minimum) and last min requests, Kari is the world's most communicative event planner, and the niceness of the staff was a reminder that good service is something that can turn a good event into a fantastic evening of joy. I frequent a number of manhattan rooftops, and in the summertime you WILL be expected to shell out a pretty penny for a private seated space/table, and people coming here should expect that. But for the view, the ambience, location, and food and drinks on offer (and the service ofc!) - this really is a great deal. I just hope the Crown continues its great (also female-led,woohoo!) service and doesn't fall into the usual trap of becoming overly ambitious and snooty as it gains popularity - which it surely will. Go here asap people, for the uptown and downtown views, the frose and food, and that squinty, glimmering endless summer feeling that's all too fleeting.",6,1,4
91,Lily P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,33,17,4.0,6/7/2018,I would have given this place 5 stars if the drinks were good. It's not even close to good. But the views made up for it. Pretty chill place to hang out  with friends. Spectacular views especially If u like taking pictures like me. Hopefully they see my message and hire better bartenders.,,,
92,Ankit S.,"Hoboken, NJ",29,1,0,4.0,1/1/2018,"Great views. Just went to the NYE party, had a blast. Would recommend. Someone got kicked out for making out though",,,
93,Lola P.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,5.0,6/13/2018,Beautiful views and great service. The waitresses and servers were not in a rush and got to know our names and even brought us a round of free margarita shots. The drinks are unreal and definitely picture worthy. I hope the word does not get out but still really amazing. Concierge Adam downstairs clued our friends in and we came up. Can't say enough good about this place.,,,
94,DanLin O.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,7,0,5.0,8/4/2017,"Such a great view at the rooftop!!! So much better than mr. Purple or gansevoort. You get to see the whole empire State building without having any surrounding high-rises to block the view. The frose is super boozy and very refreshing. Love the service here, definitely coming back until summer ends",3,,
95,Alan F.,"Louisville, KY",0,4,0,1.0,7/15/2017,"Extremely rude and condescending waitstaff. We arrived and were told by one employee that we could sit at a table, and were then told the table was reserved. Not an issue, except for the extremely hard attitude and lack of apology for the misinformation.",4,,
96,Wilson S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,17,9,5.0,9/10/2017,Excellent Views! So much fun and amazing DJ. Great tunes all night! Wow. Going back for sure!,1,,
97,Laura A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,2,5.0,9/11/2017,Hidden gem in Chinatown. Stunning panoramic views both North and South. If you are looking for ambiance and views this has it. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Drinks are pricey. Small selection of appetizers.,1,,
98,Bryan G.,"Manhattan, NY",384,51,2,5.0,10/12/2017,"Came with a group of friends, we had an awesome time there, the view was amazing, drinks was good! The staff was really nice. The manager Marky really treated us well. Will definitely come back!",,,
99,Rumi O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/6/2017,"The Crown is a great NYC rooftop for several reasons:Views: Awesome views of Midtown, Downtown and the bridges.Drinks: Creative cocktail menu and terrific overall selectionService: Great Bartenders and waitstaff",1,,
100,David L.,"New York, NY",15,8,1,5.0,11/23/2017,"Celebrated my birthday here and despite us running a little late due to dinner at Rice and Gold downstairs, the hostess at the Crown was understanding and honored our table reservation. Once we walked in, I noticed the scene was grown and music was to my liking with the DJ playing hiphop and r&b (hard to find lounges that stick to this type of music these days). Drinks are typical rooftop bar prices ($16+) but the bartenders actually put effort into the cocktails and the drink menu/bar selection was on point. However, my favorite part of this bar is the view. Due to the height of the hotel and zoning laws around it, the Crown provides a beautiful unobstructed view of the midtown skyline and the Manhattan bridge - this is a type of view that I would take my friends to when they come visit me from out of town. Overall, my friends and I had a great night at the Crown and ended off with a delicious late night meal at Noodletown next door.",,,
101,Alison M.,"Irvine, CA",94,8,0,5.0,9/25/2017,Love this rooftop bar. So much fun. Phillip is the best bartender on the planet. Coming back every visit.,1,,
102,Yaqeen S.,"New York, NY",1,12,6,5.0,8/26/2017,This place has a great vibe and great cocktails. But honestly Sunny D the bouncer is the man! He set the vibe. His smile was welcoming and he set the tone for the rest night. Overall great views and great cocktails and great crowd! Highly recommend.,1,,
103,Berto D.,"Bergenfield, NJ",0,4,5,4.0,7/4/2017,Nice spot! Great view!! Seems this place is recently new. They did not have several basic drinks available and even drinks on their menu which was a bit disappointing. Great atmosphere. Only other thing was there's no smoking on the outside area which I respect but as a smoker I rather not go all the way back downstairs for a smoke.,3,,
104,Phillip J.,"Lowell, MA",0,2,0,2.0,7/8/2017,I am sitting here on the rooftop bar as I write this...we were given our check about 15 minutes ago and have not seen our waitress since. She is too busy with the managers tasting the menu to worry about her current customers right in front of her eyes. I understand the tasting of a menu is important for a waitress but please take care of the people right in front of you! How much longer will this take???,3,,
105,Stacy J.,"Miami, FL",0,3,1,5.0,10/30/2017,"Went to the crown this Saturday for the Halloween party and I was pleasantly surprised. Typically me and my husband hate coming downtown but this place is definitely worth the trip!! Since it was our first time here the host (Alison, I believe) gave us a quick walk around the space and gave us some cocktail recommendations. We loved the Halloween cocktails they had!! There was a small issue in ringing up our check, one of the drinks was accidentally rang up 3 times. Thankfully, Marcus, the manager I believe quickly resolved our issue and gave us a complimentary glass of prosecco for me and my husband. Our server Alexis was well informed on the menu and wine selection. Overall a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back for more with family and friends!!",,,
106,Marina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,3,0,1.0,7/5/2017,"If I could give this place zero stars I would! Worst lounge/rooftop ever in terms of the staff/security and manager. I bought tickets for me and my husband to see the fireworks on a open rooftop. Not many people came and so there was plenty of room. I walked out of the outdoor space to get a drink and then the security guard would not let me back into the outdoor space to watch the fireworks! He randomly let some people in and others he did not. I had paid more than 50 dollars for the entry and expected to see fireworks and was not allowed to do so. When I spoke to the manager, he got in my face, threatening me and said since I did not pay 1000 for a table in the lounge, I do not deserve to see the fireworks. He kept screaming that the 50 dollars only covered standing room, however standing room includes the outdoor rooftop. The manager, hostess and security were rude and unprofessional. They are trying to act like an elite rooftop but have horrible service, do not know how to organize a party, rip off people and do not even have decent decorum or space. Many guests were complaining and unsatisfied. The music and DJ is nothing special. This rooftop needs to get new staff, especially a new manager or this place will go out of business.",4,,
