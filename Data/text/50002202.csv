Bea's drinks are nice and stiff - I recommend the Coco Fashion (believe that's the one with the marshmallow) or the Maracuya Mama.Also had dinner there a few years ago - remember Uncle Tommy's Pie (shepherds pie) being great.",,,
1,Diem P.,"Missouri City, TX",19,75,2,4.0,11/8/2018,"Good food and nice ambiance..especially in the courtyard area where we ate. However, nothing exceptional. Had the filet entree - cooked at right temperature but not as seared on the outside as I would have liked my steaks...perhaps this is a Texan thing..?  For a filet, it's also not as tender as I would have expected. But still not that bad.Had baby scallops as well...and it's quite baby :). Tiny scallops but good flavor.  Loads of tomatoes and asparagus.  Good if you like cherry:grape tomatoes.The tuna guac was also good.  Good portion and tasty. Food came out oddly quick. But took a while for waitress/waiter to come back afterwards to refill and check on us. But they were still friendly..perhaps more busy than they expected for a Monday night..?Overall good restaurant but nothing too special that will warrant a repeat visit. But will come back if friends/family really wants to go.",,,
2,Fiona C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",124,12,0,4.0,10/24/2018,"A great place for chill drinks with friends or date night. The drinks are good and the bar food comes at a great price.The venue is super cute, with old movies being projected on the white brick walls. But beware, it can get busy and service can be a little slow so don't arrive starving.",,,
3,Hannah V.,"Flushing, NY",222,232,687,4.0,11/13/2018,Lovely and cozy spot for some drinks with friends or a date. I'd avoid the Port Authority area at all costs but this place might be worth it. I highly recommend the Anything Goes if you're looking for a light and fun cocktail and Coco Fashion for something stronger.,2,,
4,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",961,975,2708,5.0,10/23/2018,"What! A! Find!!! So my gf and I made plans to watch Avenue Q, as we were planning what to do before the show, I was surveying the area for some quality eats that wasn't too far from the theater. Bea was amazing, I loved the decor, I loved the food and I loved the service. The main dinning room tends to be pretty loud since there is also a bar but we were seated in a little side room that was intimate, it had a actual tree growing from inside and there was natural light coming from the ceiling. I highly recommend this place for anyone watching a show or want a nice place for an intimate dinner with top notch food. The food:House Ricotta- Grilled Bread, Rosemary Honey, Sea Salt. Holy mother of Jesus, was this good. I thought the house ricotta was great, I thought the combination of the ricotta, honey, sprigs of basil and toasted bread went together perfectly. I loved the texture of the ricotta, it had such a great mouth feel but I did find the flavor of the ricotta itself to be a bit mild. The toasted bread was perfect, it was nice and warm with a nice crunchy exterior yet a light and fluffy interior, this was the perfect bread for the ricotta and honey. Highly recommend. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Home Made Fries- Home made fries are always a plus in my book but the home made fries here were amazing! They were perfectly fried, nice crunch on the outside while maintaining a nice fluffy inside. Oh and the fries were seasoned perfectly while not be oily or greasy at all. I am gonna go ahead and say it, this was one of the best order of fries I ever had. Highly recommend. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Chilean Sea Bass- Buttered Corn, Brussel Sprouts, Red Onion, Micro Greens. This was so delicious. The Sea Bass was cooked perfectly, I loved the crunchy exterior of the fish yet the center was still perfectly moist and tender. Then they paired this perfectly cooked piece of Sea Bass with a really smart side of delicious corn and Brussels Sprouts. Highly recommend. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Green Pasta- Creamy Fresh Spinach Tagliatelle Pasta, Marinated Shrimp. First things first, it's not a pretty dish, it kinda looks like a hot mess but holy mommy was it a really good dish. I loved the texture and chew of the pasta and loved the shrimp which were cooked perfectly. The size of the shrimp was a good respectable size and they actually give you a lot of shrimp, my dish had seven pieces of meaty shrimp. This is the part of the dish that took it over the top for me since usually any kind of cream based pasta sauces, like Alfredo, can tend to get nauseatingly creamy, but the pasta dish here was perfectly balanced, I felt like I could eat the entire plate without having that nauseous feeling. Highly recommend. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",13,6,13
5,Ashley B.,"Queens, NY",326,64,138,5.0,10/18/2018,"Oh my godddddd can I tell you all how AMAZING this brunch is!!!! For $52 a person it's unlimited drinks (select few including mimosas and bloody Mary's), and a 12 course tasting menu + unlimited food. What this means is they bring out the 12 dishes in courses, smaller tapas-style sizes that are shareable for the table, and after you can order more of whichever was your favorite. I'm not even joking when I say every. Single. Dish. Was out of this world.  Some of our favorites were the spinach pie and French toast. We were so stuffed so we didn't end up ordering extras but I definitely will try to next time.We went to brunch on Saturday so they have the Saturday/Sunday brunch option that many places do not have.  The inside decor is so nice, one room seemed to maybe have almost skylights with a tree inside?? Regardless of what it was, we're hoping to get a seat in there next time!Few other things: drinks were super strong and delicious, service great, absolutely no complaints. Found my new (casual) brunch spot; can't wait to come back and take my parents / other friends / etcz",2,,
6,Niv P.,"Manhattan, NY",85,100,298,5.0,10/14/2018,"This place is a real hidden gem and I loved everything about this spot when we dined here last night - the soft lighting, beautiful ambience, rustic decor, very friendly and welcoming servers, delicious food and yummy cocktails.  There are quite a few entrees to choose from, and we finally ended up getting the Chilean sea bass and baby scallops. Both were cooked to perfection and were just excellent. For dessert we got the flourless dark chocolate cake ( can't recommend it highly enough; it was dense, dark and sooo rich). Will definitely come back!",3,,1
7,Gabby F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",51,56,208,2.0,10/20/2018,"The hostess was extremely rude and I won't forget it. We came here for brunch and chose the al la carte option of $9 per plate and the food was good. Nothing special but not bad. The service was awful. We asked to be move to a bigger table since we were 7 people and felt squished but they said they couldn't because a party of 10 was coming. That party of 10 never showed up.The best part about this place was sitting in this pretty area (patio type). Again, the food was good and I will say the French toast was amazing but besides that the service was so terrible and the hostess was so rude that it over powered everything.",1,,
8,Kristy F.,"East Northport, NY",299,66,104,5.0,10/7/2018,"I'm reluctant to write this amazing review because I want this place to remain a hidden gem. We made a reservation for 2, and def necessary. The place is small and cute which means there isn't a ton of tables. Go for the brunch. It's a 12 course tasting menu with the option of adding bottomless brunch to it. I was with my mom and we were eating here before going to a show, so we weren't trying to get sloshed, so we just did brunch. One note-- everyone at the table has to do brunch. One person can't just do it. You can get small plates instead but they're $9 each so you might as well just get the brunch!!Let me start talking about the food...There wasn't anything we didn't like. The best things were the roasted pork shoulder. It just fell apart and melted in your mouth. It was delicious. The flaky egg pastry with spinach was so creamy yet light, I've never had anything like it. The french toast was out of this world. So fresh, with a little Nutella and fruit. It didn't even need syrup that's how amazing it was!",4,1,2
9,TaNeisha J.,"Washington, DC",66,99,429,4.0,9/23/2018,"Bea is such a cute and fun hang out spot. I came here after work with a huge appetite.Food: I couldn't decide if I wanted the Green Pasta or the Lamb Chops, but somehow convinced myself to order the chops. I ordered them medium-well. The chops came out cooked to perfection and sat atop mashed potatoes. I can't pinpoint the marinade/seasoning on the chops, but they were good and had a nice sear. The mashed potatoes were creamy and came out hot. Overall, the dish was good and I would get it again. - 4 starsDrinks: I ordered ""Anything Goes."" It was a hit. Instead of Gin (I hate gin), I asked the waitress to substitute it with vodka. Yummy . This drink had a nice citrus taste; yet, it wasn't too powerful. It was a nice sweet/citrus balance. - 4 starsService: This is where I felt Bea was lacking. Maybe it was because I visited right when shifts were being switched, but no one really came by to check on food or to see if I was satisfied. Granted, the restaurant was busy; however, it seemed like there were enough wait-staff to ensure that all tables were covered. - 3 stars.",2,1,1
10,John C.,"Concord, NC",167,142,763,4.0,9/11/2018,"This is a perfect gem out in midtown. Decided to come out with my girlfriend after a long day of exploring out and about in the big apple.We started out with the Captain Lawrence Pilsner, which is a great tasting lager. We then went ahead with the tuna tar tar, with some big ol' chips. The tuna tar tar was really good and exactly what you expect in an appetizer, enough to hold your hunger until the entree comes out.After a few minutes finishing the appetizer, my girlfriend and I split the steak and tomatoes, which came with a side of fries. The steak was medium- rare which came it so tender and tasty. The tomatoes... well they were tomatoes, not sure what else to say about them. The food was so good and filling that we skipped on the dessert, but definitely will have to come back an try it because everything was so good and far from disappointing.",1,1,1
11,Leslie C.,"Miami, FL",346,98,661,4.0,9/2/2018,"Love this place! The look, the feel, the food, the service all great! I made a reservation and was running a few minutes late and they called me to see if they should still hold my reservation. What restaurant does that?! Lol I loved that the most! My boyfriend and I shared the tuna tar guac (delicious!) and the steak and tomatoes (juicy steak and the French fries were soooo good!). I didn't like the green beans that came with the steak, but I guess it all depends how you like your green beans cooked. Not sure how they were cooked actually lol but they were hard and had a taste of oil. Other than the green beans and maybe the pricing (a bit high), this place is great. Definitely recommend it. The decorations are very unique and  the feel. I came on a Saturday night.",2,,1
12,Sandy J.,"Westwood, NJ",174,136,94,3.0,10/20/2018,Had high hopes for this place but it was just okay.  Decor is really cute.  We sat in the room that is more like an open area.  The service wasn't great.  Our waitress looked miserable to be there.  The food was mediocre as well.  My friend and I had two dishes and shared them.  One was manicotti and the other the steak dish.  Well maybe I should have known better to get Italian at a restaurant that wasn't authentic Italian but it was just ok.  The steak was so chewy I had trouble eating it.  The highlight of our meal were the fries.  And what does that say?  Definitely not returning for a plate of fries.,6,2,4
13,Amal A.,"Hoboken, NJ",16,56,223,5.0,8/25/2018,"We came here on a rainy gloomy Saturday morning and we thought what's better that the bottomless brunch to cheer ourselves up! When the small yummy plates were flowing to our tables we just were in a good mood! We had unlimited coffee, orange juice and tea. I loved the asparagus mushroom and the potatoes while my friends loved the smoked salmon and pork shoulders but we all agreed on the French Toast so we ordered a third one! Everything was on point and the service was outstanding and when we finished we couldn't believe that we already spent two hours enjoying the food. If you're not coming for the brunch then you've to come and try the french toast, it's one of the best french toast that I've ever had if it's not the best! Simply amazing!",1,1,1
14,Melissa K.,"North Bergen, NJ",88,98,955,4.0,11/10/2018,"I was surprised by my fiancé for a dinner date here and we were not disappointed! The place is funky lit with candles, giving it a very romantic feel. We were seated at a small table for two and started with drinks. The Piña Coladdin is sooooo good! Like a pina colada on steroids. We decided to gets apps and split a meal. We got the Tuna Tar Guac, Duck empanada, French fries, shrimp toast, and the green pasta with shrimp. By far my favorite was the Tuna Tar Guac and the shrimp toast! I was dreaming about this so much, a couple of weeks later I brought my sister and her boyfriend here for dinner and drinks! The duck was fabulous as well! The only disappointment was the pasta. It was dry and bland. I wouldn't order it again, but everything else was so good I didn't care. On our second trip we split a Kale salad with shrimp and we are still dreaming about it! The drinks are amazing and so is the food. If you plan on coming, make a reservation!",3,2,3
15,Ashley H.,"Austin, TX",0,64,62,4.0,10/19/2018,"Good food, nice ambiance but rude female hostess from last night's visit. Haven't had anyone blatantly roll their eyes so hard at me...since grade school I guess. I politely asked a simple question: why did the two guest who came in after us...who we clearly heard say ""party of two, no reso"", get seated right away yet we were told 45min wait??? I have the right to ask. Hostess snapped at me and said she has tables for 2, tables for 3 and tables for 4...all different. Spoke to me like she owned the damn place and I was asking for a free meal. I responded, I was just asking a question...you don't have to be rude. Then huge eye roll, turns away and just dismisses the whole exchange. I headed towards the bar to find a seat and by fate ran right into the manager (tall black gentleman) and he promptly corrected the situation and saved the night. The food and drinks were delicious so that was a relief. Thats why 4 stars. Again, manager saved the day but that's his job so of course he should do it well. Can't say the same about the hostess...pitty, as they are the first impression of the business. Funny how when we left...the party of ""3"" who were seated before us...was still a party of 2....3rd person must of been Casper the Ghost.",2,1,1

Brunch is A1 (I always recommend it to people) and I enjoyed dinner here as well. This past Friday, I decided to host my 30th Birthday Dinner at Bea and it was simply amazing. The appetizers I chose for my package were: Pork dumplings, Kale caesar, Lamb meatballs and Mac & Cheese. For my entree, I chose: Lamb chops, Scallops, Market fish and Green pasta. When I say EVERYTHING was delicious?! EVERYTHING WAS SO DELICIOUS. The servers were on top of it with ensuring our 2 hours of beer & wine were flowing at ease. The manager sang me Happy Birthday, and he has a great singing voice. I felt so special all night. It's a warm vibe with excellent food and great service.

18,Tai R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,42,83,5.0,10/15/2018,"Dropped in for brunch on a Sunday morning and did unlimited drinks and food. First of all, there is no way you could do this without a group. My date and I were so stuffed by the end we couldn't even talk about food. Eating unlimited food is a commitment and the entire menu is very filling. Add drinks on top (mimosas-blushing and regular) and you're really in for it. I really liked the decor despite the fact that I think rustic/speak easy is getting played out. I liked that they were projecting vintage movies and they actually have a lot more space than it seems when you first walk up. The design and usage of the space was very well thought out. Everything we had was fantastic but the most notable would have to be the French toast (he is still talking about it), mushrooms with asparagus and kale Caesar salad. We ordered those twice. The spinach pie and eggs Benedict were very good too. Also, the house ricotta and smoked salmon were nice. If I had one complaint is that by the end, you've eaten a ridiculous amount of eggs and bread. Home fries and baked eggs were not memorable. Again, if we were in a large group, the amount of sausage and bacon they gave us would have been great. We sat at the bar and had a very nice woman serving us Alissa/Alyssa (I got pretty tipsy and didn't catch the spelling) she was very attentive yet laid back. Also she kept those drinks comin' Hopefully this place doesn't become overly crowded like every other spot in the city. It might even be my new favorite for brunch.  This was a great experience and I will definitely be back.",,,1
19,Mayra F.,"Columbia, SC",658,171,747,5.0,7/20/2018,"I made my reservations through the Yelp app after cruising the reviews and photos for Bea. The rest was easy! We walked in and got down to business. Carpe Diem, please! Candied bacon, please! The spinach and egg pie was airy, flaky and savory. We also tried the sauteed asparagus and smoked salmon. Also very tasty. My buddy highly recommended the baked scrambled eggs, and I was not a fan. It's the only thing I didn't like, but hey, that's A-ok! Everything else was magnifique! Our absolute favorite was the brioche french toast! We were almost tapped out when our server said we just had to try it. So glad we did because it's probably the best french toast I've had! This was not our first rodeo with bottomless brunches. They're usually not much to write home about, but Bea changes all that! Easily a feel-good meal of the year! Each dish is worthy of its own spotlight! I love that you can basically brunch Tapas style, and the drinks are delicious. Our server crushed it, and even tried to get us to come back for dinner!",2,1,2

They didn't give us a beer list at first, and my husband got a little worried. They do in fact serve beer, and you might just need to request that menu. The tuna tar guac was great.

We ordered the duck turnover as an appetizer and it was pretty good especially with the sauce. We also ordered the steak & tomatoes. The steak was good, but it came with this weird spicy ketchup-like sauce, which just threw me off. They give a lot of fries as a side and you definitely won't even finish those. The drink we ordered also had a little spice to it, which I didn't like, but I was fairly warned about that. The drink was $13. The place has two sections- an indoor and semi-outdoor kind of thing. The outside still has a roof over, but has a more natural lighting. The inside has a dark bar vibe. It does have charming decor and would be good for a date night!",1,,

I've heard good things about dinner, but I knew little about much else.The interior is really nice and seems to have an old yet updated cinema theme. There are also plenty of tables, so I highly doubt there is any wait.So the way the brunch menu works is you can either order a la cartel where each item is $9, or you can do an unlimited brunch for $29. There was also a bottomless brunch for around $50-60. We were told by the waiter that the a la carte items were bigger portions than the unlimited. We found this not to be true. We just opted for 3 a la carte options-one scrambled egg, one eggs Benedict, and one French toast. When the food came out, it really didn't look too impressive, but everything was surprisingly delicious. I would definitely come back and try the unlimited.",,,

I wouldn't have thought that such a nice spot would be in close proximity to Times Square.Bea truly serves up some inspired food. Everything I ate was seasoned richly and made with a sense of care. The mac and cheese is pretty good by restaurant standards (i'm very picky about mac and cheese). The lamb meatballs and pita bread were delightful. The Tzatziki that came on the side was so refreshing. I damn near licked the container of it clean. The lamb chops were tender, juicy, flavored and cooked to perfection. As weird as this sounds: the highlight of the meal was the garlic broccoli in oyster sauce. Wow...ive never had broccoli cooked this way. The way my taste buds danced when I ate this vegetable...just heavenly.The cocktails were also made with care and were strong.

They also have the option of having bottomless cocktails with the brunch for $52/ person. Or you can have individual dishes for $9/ dish. What surprised me the most was the size of the dishes. For bottomless brunch, I was expecting small dishes. But the eggs benedict came with 2 eggs and the breakfast potatoes was something you would expect that could be a side dish. The brioche french toast was huge. It was one slice of toast but must've been an inch thick. It came with nutella, caramel, maple syrup, bananas, and mixed berries. However, I asked to have the caramel and maple syrup to not be put on it. This was a great ending to a delicious and filling brunch. I would come back here again.",3,1,1

The 1920's theme, with the music in the bathroom, the art, and the movie streaming silently on the walls, is a charming touch. You can't not have a good time here, especially with such a down-to-earth and attentive waitstaff. I called ahead to put my friend and me on the list for a table fifteen minutes ahead, and even though we got there late, the host had no issues at all. Even afterwards, while I was waiting for my friend to arrive, the waiters didn't make me feel like I was unwelcome and even joked around with me and brought me complimentary bread. They were so great. I got the tuna guac tartare and my friend got a Moscow mule. I expected a bigger portion for the price, but I really enjoyed the fish-guac fusion dish. It comes with some chips that went great with the butter, actually. My friend's drink was sweet and strong, just how he wanted. So I question how reasonable the prices are for the portions you get here, but the food is solid and the energy is infectious. I want to make Bea my own special midtown spot!",4,2,3

Updated review","Came here for dinner on July 4th and we were seated immediately. Service was extremely slow but I thought that might be due to the holiday. The food was fantastic as always. We ordered:- House ricotta cheese: Very nice but I can't see how you can go wrong with this combination. - Duck turnover: I thought I'd give this a try since it's highly recommended. Turned out to be a HUGE disappointment. The turnover was soggy and greasy. I was confused by the taste cause there were so many mismatched flavors going on (sweet, sour, salty, cheesy..) I also didn't see any duck meat?? which we all assumed there would be cause of the name. - Lamb chops: We asked for medium rare and it was grilled perfectly! It was super tender and the sauce was a little sweet. - Green pasta: SO GOOD! But it's a very heavy dish with all the butter/cream. I've had this several times now and it never disappoints. - Stuffed chicken: My FAVORITE dish of the night! The chicken breast was shockingly juicy with a crispy flavorful skin. The stuffed pepper was insanely rich. Everything melted together on top of this delicious mushroom cream sauce. The plate size needed to be bigger cause it was super messy to eat! - Cheesecake: I was so upset to find out that they no longer serve chocolate lava cake with fig ice cream. So we settled for cheesecake and I didn't enjoy it at all. The description on the menu didn't quite match what we got. The cheesecake itself was chalky and dry.",1,,3
30,Kimberly B.,"Long Island, NY",16,12,0,4.0,11/17/2018,Cool spot on the corner. Tucked away little gem in the theater district. Mac and cheese was pretty good and drinks were stellar!!,,,
31,Katie J.,"Albany, NY",66,166,385,5.0,6/25/2018,"I came here for brunch after reading all of the good reviews and was not at all disappointed. For $28 each, we had unlimited brunch for two hours (for $52 you can do both bottomless drinks and food); you get a menu of small plates and then you can just keep ordering whatever you'd like from that menu.The simplest dishes were just absolutely delicious in unexpected ways (aside from the breakfast potatoes, which was the only thing we tried that was just a general ""shrug, yes, potatoes""). The rosemary honey on the house ricotta really made that dish shine, so much so that it was one of the few we ordered a second helping of. The French toast with Nutella, caramel, and fruit was the exact amount of French toast I'd ever want anywhere - just enough to be decadent. I don't usually care for eggs and was disappointed when my partner ordered the baked scrambled eggs (with mozzarella, chervil, and tomato sauce), but they turned out to be the most delicious eggs I've ever tasted and had I not been so full, could have eaten an entire serving of just those. Even something as simple as asparagus was an extra delicious surprise at BEA; I can't say enough good things.We will absolutely be back.",5,1,2

33,Maansi D.,"San Francisco, CA",6,27,49,5.0,6/23/2018,"This place was so good, I went twice in one week- once for dinner and once for brunch.First off- the dinner and cocktails were absolutely amazing. I couldn't get enough of the food.But don't even get me started on brunch. All you can eat, all you can drink for a very reasonable price (esp for NY standards). And the food was just soooo good. It kept coming and coming and coming. I mean I was legit full but had to force myself to stop eating because it was so good.This is a great spot to come with a large group bc for one thing, they are a rare kind that take reservations for brunch. Secondly, the prix fixe makes it so easy to split bills and everyone gets to try everything on the menu.Only thing to watch out for is that the ceiling drips condensation drops on ppl sitting below in the outside area on a nice day. So just sit inside. Otherwise food is",2,1,1

It was amazing, so fresh and flavorful. We also had the Sea Bass and shrimp toast they were both very good but the Pasta was my favorite.",,,

Didn't get to sit in the courtyard, but it was adorable. Service was great. Went with the brussel sprouts and ricotta cheese apps. Brussels were delicious, very flavorful! I'd pass on the cheese - honey was limited, bread was blah. I got the duck turnover for a meal, and it was plenty. Very hearty size, and absolutely delicious. Very interesting melding of flavors that just worked. The sauce was a bit sweet, and got to be a bit much by the end...but if I had eaten it as an appetizer as it was meant, I would have wanted more!",2,,1

So, this brunch is pricey, but you get different cocktails and small plates and can keep ordering more and more and switching up cocktails, it was pretty amazing! I'd definitely go back here and bring a group if you can get a reservation, as they are busy at brunch time and a reservation is a great idea! Typically, I'm not blown away by the all you can eat places because everything is just mediocre but not great, but this place didn't disappoint! I think there was only one thing I might not order again when I get back, but I tried so many things that that's totally acceptable! Not every thing is for everyone. We ate so much good food that we were too full to even care much about the desserts, but it was so worth it! The inside was nice, the service was pretty good and the brunch is bottomless! You can't go wrong, unless you're on a tight budget, then this may not be for you when there are cheaper options, though those places won't be as good as this one.",3,1,3

Updated review","I was so thrilled to have found this amazing restaurant!  Hubby and I had a late dinner reservation (11:15 pm) on a Friday night.  When we arrived, the place was pretty packed, but we were seated pretty quickly.  I had one of their signature spicy tequila cocktails, which was surprisingly refreshing/flavorful and not too sweet.  I would try it again.We started with the Tuna Tar Guac and House Ricotta (honey on the side).  Both of these dishes were absolutely amazing.  They were well portioned for starters, so we were not too full to eat our entrees.  Hubby ordered the English Muffin Burger (medium rare) and I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  We sampled each other's dishes and agreed that both were quite good.  Hubby's burger was cooked to perfection - the meat was tasty and moist.  My Chilean Sea Bass had a firm exterior (no crust) with a moist and buttery interior.  The corn and veggies that were paired with the fish really complimented this fish.  We shared a good bottled of Sangiovese, so we skipped dessert.The service was great and the ambiance was both romantic and fun.  It was an amazing night and I would (and have) return!",,,1

41,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,5/21/2018,"I came here with a friend to partake in the Bottomless Food brunch deal (cost was $28) and what a truly wonderful feast (12 dishes) it was, featuring practically every brunch food you can think of! The interior boasts brick wall, lovely lighting with a candle on each table, a bar in the center of the main dining room, beautiful and more intimate seating inside with sheer pale, dusty pink drapes, as well as a lively open space outdoor courtyard garden in the back which had a more brick walls, funky artwork showing off music album covers, tree with fairy lights, green plants, red tile floors, and long tables. After we let the waitress know that we wanted to do the Bottomless Food option, she explained that they would bring out 2-3 dishes at a time and they came in the order that it appears on the menu. I thought that the the order of the dishes were organized perfectly. I tried everything, except the smoked salmon because I don't eat/like raw fish. I did like how this was plated on a white plate rimmed with gold. The combination of pink, beige, green and red was pretty. The smoked salmon came on top of pita bread and underneath that was greens and tomatoes. There was cream cheese, dill, honey and mint on the salmon as well. + House Ricotta: Toasted bread and on the side a ball of light, fluffy ricotta with honey and herbs on top. The ricotta and honey was a delightful combination, however the bread was too hard and a bit too burnt.+ Kale Caesar: This salad included croutons, parmesan and housemade dressing. There was plenty of dressing and the kale was nicely crisp and fresh.+ Satueed Asparagus: The asparagus was mixed with mushrooms and supposedly cooked with white truffle oil. I could not really taste the truffle oil but the vegetables were steamed to the perfect degree. + Turkey Sausage: The sausage looked okay, but were extremely hard (I couldn't cut it with the knife we had) and the tasted very bland. This was my least favorite part of the meal. + Breakfast Potatoes: This consisted of Yukon potatoes, thyme, rosemary and smoked paprika. I enjoyed this hearty and wonderfully flavorful dish. The potatoes and all the spices throughgout were really yummy! + Spinach and Egg Pie: Made with steamed eggs, spinach, red pepper and chervil, which looked really appetizing but lacked in flavor. The shell was buttery and flaky, but the egg and spinach didn't have enough seasoning.+ Eggs Benedict: Classic dish featuring eggs over easy with Canadian bacon and English muffin on the bottom. I normally don't like my eggs over easy or Canadian bacon but on this particular dish it worked really well. The eggs had a tasty yellow sauce and a sprinkling of pepper over it. The eggs, bacon and toasted muffin was a great combination!+ Pork Shoulder: I loved this one! It consisted of pork shoulder, pineapple and pinepaple sauce, red kidney beans. The pork was incredible tender, juicy and full of flavor. The addition of the pineapple was unique and amazing. All the ingredients mingled together perfectly.+ Baked Scrambled Eggs: This had mozzerella, chervil and tomato sauce. It was very cheesy which I liked a lot but the egg itself was tasteless.+ Candied Thick Cut Bacon: Definitely another favorite of mine. The bacon was cooked with brown sugar, maple and chipotle. I was able to discern the taste of each and came in spriral form. The bacon was also intensely crispy with very little fat which is just the way I like it.+ Brioche French Toast: The piece de resistance, which had nutella and caramel sauces drizzled on the plate, strawberries and banana slices on top of the french toast, maple syrup on the side and finally, powdered sugar covering the plate. The french toast was moist and slightly crunchy and the berries were a refreshing touch. The nutella/caramel made it that much more delectable. It was quite sweet but in a good way. Our waitress was lovely. She was very attentive and never left us with an empty plate. She always made sure that we had the next brunch menu item and asked throughout the meal if there was any dish we wanted more of. My friend and I had an awesome brunch experience here. I would definitely recommend this spot to go with a group of 4 friends and trying the Bottomless Food special! They also have a Bottomless Brunch special which is $52 if you like to drink. I would like to come back at some point and see how their dinner is.",8,3,9

I just sprinkle sage sdvice here and there when I see fit.Decor and ambiance is warm, social, and inviting. Maybe build a wall so those doing the pee-pee dance can do so in private. Those leaves don't do much to hide us.The menu is  great to read and everything sounds absolutely delicious. I can tell it was well thought out. My sister and I ordered the beet salad and tuna tartare/ guacamole to start. The scallop and asparagus and green pasta with shrimp as our entrees to share. The tuna was very delicious. Although I was not too crazy about the wonton crisps. I think large cracked  tostadas would suit this way better. Sometimes Asian,  Mexican, and Italian just don't work together on the same plate. The beet salad was so close to five stars but trying to enjoy pureed/crushed beets is not the business. Those caramelized walnuts were though.The scallops and asparagus dish was interesting...my sister said it,  ""left much to be desired.""  The scallops and asparagus were drowned in their sauce. A sauce which was pretty tasty but there was just so much of it. And the dish didn't even come with a starch or carb to sop everything up. The green pasta on the other hand was near perfection. With a dash of salt...trés magnifique. Pasta was cooked al dente and the shrimp were plump and juicy. The cream sauce was great. Just dash that salt please.Can't speak on the cocktails because ice water did just fine. Might I add that New York city water tastes really great!",2,1,1

Exactly the comfort food I was looking for. My friends ordered the Mac and cheese and the other scallop and vegetable dish on the menu and both were very pleased.

46,Cynthia Z.,"Manhattan, NY",166,154,1840,5.0,4/28/2018,"Located in Hell's Kitchen, this place is definitely a restaurant that serves quality cuisine with wonderful down to earth waitstaff service. We made a reservation for 5:30pm and we were seated promptly. This restaurant has two sections. The inner section is dimly lit and has multiple tables and a bar. The outer section is kinda like a garden section because it is brightly lit with an overhead skylight and an interior tree decorated with Christmas lights. There is also a black and white movie playing against the white wall.The food:Tuna Tar Guac - Really liked this one. It's an asian fusion appetizer. It came in a small bowl and consisted of raw yellowtail tuna mixed with guacamole, onions, tomato, broccoli, soy sauce, and lime juice. On the side, it was served with five green chips. Since we came as a party of six, we requested extra chips, which were on the house. Grilled Shrimp Toast - Really liked this appetizer as well. It's yummy and it looked like a pizza with guacamole and shrimp. This appetizer was served with guacamole, pickled red onions, green tabasco sauce, and grilled shrimp on top of the flatbread. Baby Scallops - This was an entree and I found the scallops on this dish a bit too small as I was expecting something bigger. Nevertheless, this dish was delicious and nicely flavored. It also had a  strong garlic flavor for those who love garlic. This dish is served with grilled baby scallops, asparagus, white truffle, grape tomatoes, and garlic. Chilean Sea Bass - I really liked this entree and the sea bass was so tender. This dish came with buttered corn, brussel sprouts, red onions, and micro greens along with a nice piece of sea bass. Everything on it was nicely flavored including the brussel sprouts.Steak & Tomatoes - The steak was so tender with a kick of spiciness. Really liked the flavor. Definitely a recommended dish for meat and steak lovers. This dish came with 7 ounces of certified organic grass fed filet mignon, sliced tomatoes, spicy onion sauce, green beans, and a side of french fries. Green Pasta - Simple and yet tasty. One of the more popular entrees at this restaurant. I really liked the flavor and the shrimp was decent in size and was also pretty juicy. This dish was served with creamy spinach tagliatelle pasta and shrimp.For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cakes served with ice cream and the flourless chocolate cake. I didn't care much about the flourless chocolate cake but enjoyed the chocolate lava cake with the ice cream. Because it was one of our friends' birthday, the chocolate lava cake was complentary.P.S: They have bottomless brunch.",6,3,4

We were a hungry family of four after a Broadway show and were able to get reservations at the last minute. At the restaurant we were seated after a couple of minutes. Even at 10:30 at night the place was full! The lighting was so low I could barely see the place but from what I saw the decor is homey and eclectic. When we were there, a Shirley Temple movie was playing on the white wall. Now 13 year old finally knows the namesake for his favorite drink!Every item we ordered was on point. I adored the Tuna Tar Guac. The bits of tuna were so fresh and the amount of guacamole was not overwhelming. 13 year old and I shared that and the Green Pasta. Not sure how tagliatelle and marinated shrimp could be so tasty but it was flawless.   I tasted 14 year old's Manicotti. Stuffed with chicken, ricotta, and mozzarella, it was hearty and delicious.  Our server was friendly and our food came out super fast. I was happy with that considering how late it was. For NYC and the theater district the prices were reasonable. Just don't expect quiet intimacy. This place is very noisy!  Perfect though, for a pre or post theater meal!",8,4,7
49,Jae R.,"Manhattan, NY",304,213,761,4.0,4/24/2018,"A safe, predictable choice in Hell's Kitchen if you're looking for a night out or a date that won't disappoint you--but won't wow you either.  Their menu is a mix of their takes on standard food options, such as burgers and pastas.  For example, they use English muffins instead of buns and their green pasta is made with spinach.Pros:1) mac n cheese: it's very cheesy and generously portioned.  I wish they had just a little bit more breadcrumbs2) the ambiance: cozy, nicely lit and offers a variety of options for seating (tables, high tops and bar area)3) segmented seating space: it offers a patio-looking room (so not outside seating) that can seat larger groups.  The inside has a square-shaped bar area, surrounding by smaller tables, perfect for smaller groups.Cons:1) English muffin burger: Not a huge fan of this.  They come with carmelized onions, and I recognize that carmelized onions are sweet, but it was a bit too much.2) lavender monk: This place is known for their cocktails, but somehow this was my least favorite part.  Sweeter than I imagined when I first drank it, but I tasted ginger in the ginger beer toward the bottom.  Perhaps it was not mixed as well.All in all, I'll probably be back.  Not a bad option for your weekday dinner options, whether alone (and I saw a few people doing so), with friends or with a date.",2,,1
50,Erin C.,"Cleveland, OH",2,58,141,3.0,10/21/2018,"I made a reservation about a month in advance because we were coming in from out of town. They texted and emailed me 5 times within the 48 hours leading up to my reservation to confirm. Based on that, I thought this place would be packed and there would be a big wait! Not the case.  We walked in and were seated within 30 seconds, and would have been even without a reservation. There were plenty of empty tables at 8pm on a Saturday. The experience started out well. The cocktail (something with ginger syrup and citrus) was delicious. The pear salad was delicious. We waited almost 50 minutes for our entrees. The table next to us was just getting their food when we got there. They had left, and a new couple had been seated, and they even had received their food before us. I'm sure they forgot about us, and our waiter didn't check on us once from the time he took the salad plate away, until when we had to track him down to ask what was taking so long. We ordered the manicotti (by waiter recommendation) and the market fish, and a side of brussel sprouts.The manicotti was not great (I actually thought it was bad, and I'm not picky) and the 'market fish', which was supposed to be some kind of white fish, ended up being salmon. We inquired why it was salmon, as salmon was not even on the menu. The waiter came back from the kitchen with the answer that they ran out of the market fish and just replaced it. Not a huge deal, and it was good, but it was just annoying because we waited for so long and did not get what we asked for. I understand the idea of market fish is that it is a daily thing, and therefore bound to run out, but in that long wait they could have asked if we wanted to switch  to something else. The brussel sprouts were delicious. The waiter did not apologize for the food being so late or for us getting not what we ordered. I am disappointed with our experience, and am disappointed because most other people seem to have good experiences here.",,,

I had read the reviews, seen the pictures, and expected relatively good things. I will highlight what I liked about the place first and then go into my reasoning for the low ranking.I would like to offer the following disclaimer: I did not have any cocktails, and from the look of the menu, their cocktail menu had trendy and fun drinks on them.The atmosphere of this place SELLS the vibe. Walking in, I feel like I'm in a speakeasy and have been taken to the 1920s. Well, the 1920s with modern twists. The waiters and bartenders were dressed formally, with well-fitting cuts of suits and shirts, and an intentional style to exude elegance. The furniture, the bar, and the physicality of the space were AWESOME.Unfortunately, though, the service, timing, and food brought my groups excitement down significantly. The server was friendly when he did show up at our table. Frequently, we had to ask other services and the manager for refills on drinks. Our perception of time could have been altered by the pressing deadline of the show we were seeing that evening, but it took over an hour for our food to be presented after ordering. Out of a group of four, only one was excited about her food after tasting it--the seabass. The other orders in our group, the pie, scallops, and chicken, were average and didn't leave anything to be remembered. My savory pie resembled more LeanCuisine than a traditional English meat pie.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised with the tuna guac we had for an appetizer.",2,1,1

My wife loved the salmon. The kale was a deep rich green color. The ricotta with honey added a light and sweet taste to my palette. The presentation of the French toast was nicely decorated with fresh fruit. The bacon was thick and had a sweet flavor to it. Service was swift and attentive.

Updated review","Fabulous. Has a great vibe with old movies being played on projectors on the walls. Dimly lit, cozy decor.Ricotta with honey & rosemary aioli on toast is INSANE. So glad our waitress recommended it as one of the fan favorites.Beet salad w/ bleu cheese, apples, mandarin oranges & pecans was so refreshing.Both me and my mom felt it was the BEST burger we ever had. We NEED to go back. Came back again for second time a year and a half later with friends in between shows (Harry Potter) and the service was awful. Our server Michael barely came to us - other servers popped in and helped us more. We asked for water 3x he came back with coke . Really put a damper on the experience. The ambience is beautiful, cozy, warm. The food is phenomenal but the service truly was lacking. And I think what disappointed me most was that when I told the manager he did nothing to remedy it!",,,
60,April Y.,"Washington, DC",187,125,204,2.0,2/16/2018,"The only reason I give this place two stars is the server. We had an awful service in here. The server barely came to us, checked on us, or got us our drinks. I thought it was because there are a lot of people, but seemed like they were getting all their drinks (LOL). My friend got an ale, and the server said it was a stout. So she said she didn't order stout; the server kept saying it was stout like it was her fault. We all spoke English, yet the attitude I felt was he kind of ignored us because he assumed that we couldn't speak/understand English. Turned out it was the ale....the server got it wrong...sigh. The frustration kept going on when we needed a check. Since the server didn't come to us after one cup of beer, we decided to leave. However, the server never comes...we went up to the front and asked for a check. The hostess was nice and she took care of it for us.Long story short, it has a good vibe and maybe good drinks. But sometimes, service can change whole experience of the place. Usuallu I leave bars with happily drunk, yet today, I felt bad after leaving the bar.",7,4,1

I had all but 2 out of the 10 cocktails offered and most of them were too sweet for my tastebuds. We also ordered a couple classics which weren't on the menu.Figaro! - the best of what I tried; I would definitely order this again!Lavender Monk - tasted overwhelmingly like ginger beerPaper Fox - a favorite of the group; It was good but a little too sweetThe Gigi - too spicy, but if you're into that, you might like it!Tantelize - bitter, tasted overwhelmingly like gin20 Century Blues - too sweetDivine Derecho - smoky Most photogenic cocktails: 20 Century Blues, Figaro!, and Coco FashionI'd like to return and try some of the food next time because that seems to be getting all the good reviews!",1,,

Do people in NYC eat?? The green pasta with shrimp was just ok. The sauce was tasty but very oily towards the bottom. I felt nauseous shortly after. The shrimp wasn't fresh like I'd expect it to be for $22. It's like that glossy shrimp you get at the Chinese places- I never knew what that was, still don't. (Looking at other people's pictures, some have the ""fake tasting shrimp"" and some have fresh shrimp, odd). Other stuff looked good on the menu but I don't want to chance going home hungry.",,,

I came on the Fourth of July after watching fireworks at the East River State Park and I was lucky enough to beat the crowd and snag a booth with my boyfriend. The waiter recommended the anything goes and divine derecho cocktail to me since I requested something on this we are ended. Both are great if you are looking for something more flavorful! My boyfriend won't for long island iced tea and it was one of the best drinks that he's ever had. It was strong and sweet, just as he wanted. As for dinner, the sea bass was average. It was good, but I've had better. The steak was good, medium rare was perfect.Tuna tar guac is an awesome appetizer. We tried to return the next night for drinks in the tuna again, but apparently they close earlier than their normal hours if business is slow. I arrived at 12:30 AM and was a couple minutes too slow.

75,Joshua R.,"Mobile, AL",330,215,424,5.0,12/17/2017,"Located at the corner of 9th Ave and W 43rd street, Bea is an assuming little restaurant that probably holds like 30 tables.  Decorated in that classical turn of the century way, with black and white photos on the walls and spun fixtures for lights, this place is very welcoming though seemed to be a tad cold.  However, the NYC brunch scene is second to none, and this is by far my favorite brunch in the city. First it's bottomless, not just booze, but also on food! Now if you're not that hungry you can eat a la carte but its 9 dollars a plate and 9 dollars a drink.  Going bottomless, its 52 dollars per person, we chose that option for the obvious reason.  The only condition is that everyone has to go bottomless if one does, otherwise no can do for anyone.  Served in manageable courses, the food was amazing, there was nothing that wasn't at least very good if not exceptional.  The highlights were the smoked salmon, ricotta cheese with honey, kale caesar salad, french toast, and bacon!  Yea there's more food then that but those were our favorites.   For cocktails, my Bloody needed a bit of spice but after some sauce it was good to go, and the blushing mimosa was a hit with my dining companion.Check this place out if you're a brunch fanatic or enjoy the bottomless brunch scene, we flew up from the Gulf Coast and this place may very well be a reason to go back!",6,,1

Food was great, however, it took forever and a day for it to come to our table. We had to repeatedly ask if they placed the order because we weren't sure if it was still coming. That's how long it took. The place is super cute, but there was some water leaking from the ceiling. The waiter took care of that. The server was very nice and the drinks are very yummy.

77,Godley V.,"Queens, NY",195,442,926,4.0,6/6/2018,"Hip little spot just off of 9th Ave. We had reservations for two at 6pm last Friday and were promptly seated upon arrival. The place was buzzing but one section in the back was unoccupied so one other group + we were the first to be seated there. A server immediately came by to take our drink orders and back again later to take our food order.The menu is interesting; familiar but with unique twists. We apped on the Tuna Tar Guac (try it!) & Spicy Lamb Meatballs. Both were pretty good. Neither were hugely portioned but that's okay - it left us room for our entrees. I had the Lamp Chops which were cooked to a proper medium, as ordered. They had a nice little sear on the outside but were still tender and flavorful without being overly spiced to where the flavor of the lamb would have been hidden. Wife had the Chicken and Stuffed Bell Pepper which she wasn't a huge fan of, to be honest. I tried it and it was just okay. Probably the only mild disappointment that evening.All in all, the prices were decent and it's a cool little spot, especially if you are with a not-too-big group and want to catch up over drinks. We stopped by before catching a Broadway production and our timing allowed us to get in and out efficiently while making it to our 7:30 show.",2,1,3

They also let us close the blinds on a busy Friday night so that our friend wouldn't see us. They're great sports.The food. Wow, the food. I got the English Muffin burger, and it is quite possibly one of the best burgers in the city. The meat ratio is perfect--I've no idea what they put in there, but it's delicious. Sour cream, gouda, spinach, and caramelized onions complete this incredible bite. I also had the mac & cheese, for which I did not have high expectations, but it turned out to be the most incredible thing I had that night.Chocolate lava cake was meh; they put ice cream on top of it, which just congealed the lava inside and made the cake cool and rubbery. The drink I had, the Pina Coladdin (sp?), was just okay. Lots of gin and bourbon drinks, but not a lot of vodka. Go for the food and the cute decor.",,,

For a group of 9 they just ""connected"" tiny round tables. I would be ok with the seating arrangement if it wasn't so tight. We were literally right next to other tables. And had to get up to let the waiter in to take orders for the table boxed in.2. Bathroom takes forever. There's only 2 bathroom and the line is longgggggg.3. Food was so disappointing... I almost wanted to cry. Was excited for the tuna guac which was terrible. It was bland and the chips were stale. The tuna guac did not have enough tuna it was mostly diced tomatoes and it needed salt. Sea bass was also another bland dish. The sea bass was super fresh but extremely bland it was quite sad. Steak and tomatoes was another sad, bland dish. It was a waste of steak. It needed more salt and pepper. I also wouldn't recommend the pizza's. Only 2 things that were great out of the 8 different types of dishes was the pear arugula salad-amazing and also amazing and tasty was the green pasta. Most definitely not coming back.

I recently went vegan and there were many things i couldn't have, and they were able to sub a couple of items but not the star dishes.  I feel like other restaurants of this caliber have a better handle on vegan alts.  And in all fairness, a set brunch menu usually doesn't have as any options as a full dinner menu would.  But having said that, everything i had was great and everyone really really enjoyed the food.  I think the asparagus was my favorite dish of all.Our waitress, Alexa was very nice but we could have used just a little more attention, but it did get busy and we were happy enough.  Oh and a last call would have been very much appreciated.  But we had a great time, my sis lost her wallet, which was found and returned by the staff.All in all, this place was great!",1,,

My coworkers and I usually tend to this spot after work because it seems one of the less packed and touristy next to other Hell's Kitchen bars. I suggest making a reservation if you can. Otherwise, the bar seating is great, and their bartenders are friendly and serve in timely fashion.Bea a nice blend of restaurant and bar. You have your full drinks menu of cocktails, wines, and decent draft list of beers. They have a full menu of appetizers and entrees. Their signature cocktails are consistently well made. In terms of food, I've enjoyed the tuna tartare guacamole, spicy lamb meatballs, mushroom pizza, and english muffin burger. For cocktails, the lavendar monk, spring pong, and brooklyn cue are great choices.Bea is one of my go to after work spots. It has a nice ambience and is probably less touristy than other Hell's Kitchen bars. The food and drinks are solid. Again, I recommend reservations ahead of time as walk ins can be a gamble.

Such a great gem in the theater district if you are looking for decent wine and dine before a show that is not overpriced. Most of items I ordered on the menu were pretty on point and seasoned well. The tuna tar guac is a must order whenever I am here. Drinks are strong and super tasty, I especially like the Lavender Monk. I have only sat in the main dining room the few times that I dined here. Atmosphere is lively, loud noise level (perhaps because of the bar). Dark lighting and rustic decor, it can be hard to see the menu. There is a small garden room off to the side. It is much brighter, with greens, a tree, and a glassed rooftop, which brings in a lot of sunlight during the day. It is a great oasis, offering a completely different ambiance compare to the main dining room during the day. It is nice to have a restaurant with different ambiance options, depending on if you want something more buoyant or more low-key. Service appears to be a bit lacking. Perhaps, they were understaffed for such a busy restaurant. Overall, the restaurant is a great find for the location. Good food, good drinks, good vibes, and average priced.",,,

It was so delicious any the flavors melded together perfectly. The duck sauce it came with was a great pairing.  Definitely a shareable portion.My main was the Chilean Seabass. It was cooked to perfection and went very well with the corn and brussel sprouts.  It came out super fast as well. I would give 4.5 stars if I could because while the service was very good, the waitress was unable to answer a neighboring table's question as to what Airline Chicken was. It's the breast with the drum of the wing attached. She said something along the lines of it just being organic and that's the kind of chicken it is...",,,

Tommy's pie (which is like a shepard's pie) was a crowd favorite, and the sea bas was very fresh.The cocktails weren't that good though. I didn't like mine (too strong), and a few people didn't like theirs either. Stick to beer and wine or normal libations like margaritas, gin and tonics, etc.Overall very pleased.

94,Jenni K.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,255,277,4.0,10/17/2017,"I used to live right across the street from Bea but never went until years after I moved out of the neighborhood (so.freaking.loud). I always saw the cute BEA sign outside the restaurant when I was walking home. I've been twice now, once for dinner and another time for drinks. I got the GREEN PASTA (creamy fresh spinach tagliatelle pasta with marinated shrimp) which was absolutely delicious. The sauce was not heavy at all (for a white sauce) and I really enjoyed the pasta. An appetizer I loved was the HOUSE RICOTTA (with rosemary honey and sea salt). They give you a few pieces of baguette with it. I'm obsessed with ricotta so I might be biased but I loved the combo very much. We also tired the SPICY LAMB MEATBALLS (with smoked chipotle, tomato sauce raita, and pita bread). It was yummy, but nothing memorable. Drinks: I've tried a few different ones. I think my favorite is ANYTHING GOES (Beach Plum Gin, Pomegranate Syrup, Lime Juice & Prosecco). Second fave is BROOKLYN CUE (Brooklyn Gin, Elderflower Liqueur, Cucumber, Lemon Juice, and a Sugar Rim). I think their cocktails are a bit on the sweeter side and not that strong. Great place for a group dinner or to grab a few drinks with friends. It's a little loud in there and the bar is usually packed. There's seating around the bar, but you'll be lucky to get a seat the second you get there.",3,,2

The tuna was fresh, and the guacamole was definitely a match. I never expected that.I didn't like the noise level too much. It was loud. It was loud enough that it was actually quieter outside on the street. Prepare to strain your throat here if you want to go inside and actually chat with your friends.

98,Kate Y.,"Queens, NY",211,189,587,4.0,5/3/2018,"Stopped by after work to J for a nosh and some drinks to destress after an awful day. We walked in and was told that the tables were booked to capacity, but the seats at the bar were open. Hallelujah, had we been turned away, that really would've been the cherry on top of a total crap day. Anyway, I do prefer to sit at the bars most of the time (unless doing a full meal), so that worked out perfectly for us. We ended up having 3 cocktails each and was overall pleased with the drinks we had. Below is a brief review of each:Divine Derecho: I'm usually not a fan of mezcal, but I recently had a cocktail elsewhere that had mezcal in it and I actually liked it! Previously, I absolutely hated it... so now I'm definitely trying any and all mezcal cocktails to determine whether I like it or not. The DD was fairly good, a bit smoky because of the mezcal but not too much. The sherry makes the drink interesting. Figaro!: J had this and we were both surprised by how sweet it was. Unless you're into very light and sweet cocktails, I'd say this is a hard pass. Anything Goes: Nice and light, I enjoyed this one. The rest of the cocktails must have been updated and it's not yet listed on the website (or I was drunker than I thought), but the rest of the cocktails on the menu do not look familiar... ^^ I do remember that J had a cocktail with a rosé float and it was delicious. And I had one with Fernet Blanc in it; this was my favorite of the night. Food wise -We ordered the shrimp toast. This dish is huge, it's more like a flat bread that it is toast. I was expecting like triangle toasts with shrimp and guacamole on it. This is a good sharing plate. While overall the dish was good, the shrimp itself had no flavor (previously frozen perhaps?). The house ricotta was delicious. The honey on top really highlights the ricotta. Unfortunately the bread that it was served with was very stale. Perhaps toasting it would help? (Or fresh bread, of course.) The last dish we shared was the mac and cheese. Made with 3 cheeses, this dish was ooey gooey and satisfying. While the service wasn't the friendliest, the bartender was fairly attentive and prepared the drinks very quickly and efficiently. Ambiance wise, it's awesome for a date, girls night, quick drinks, whatever. I like how they play movies on the wall via projector.",1,,1

102,Harshini R.,"Manhattan, NY",14,126,43,3.0,5/27/2018,Really enjoyed my time here. But the only reason I've given this place 3 stars is because their baked egg scramble and eggs Benedict were mediocre at best. And those were two of the main entrees in the bottomless brunch. The French toast and all three first course dishes were amazing. But the most simple egg dishes and the spinach quiche were nothing to rave about. I'd definitely go back but not for the bottomless brunch.,,,

And, knowing we had a 7:30 show, brought our checks at 7:25 and they were wrong. Also did not comp anything despite their mistakes.

104,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,4.0,9/25/2017,"3.5 stars but rounded up.RESERVATION: Made a reservation via phone about 2 weeks in advance and didn't have any trouble for a group of 6 on a Saturday night.  Our reservation placed us in the outside area (which is the nicest spot).ATMOSPHERE: There are 2 sections to the restaurant.  The outside is a courtyard (closed) area with a movie playing, string lights, trees and a greenhouse type roof that lets natural light in.  I would say this is the ideal place because it has a great open atmosphere.  The inside is more dark and also has movies playing with the bar in the middle.  Also more of a romantic/date like atmosphere because of the dark lighting.  Overall, a good place to eat after a show or with a date or even a birthday or group outing.  It has a little bit of a ""rustic"" or old feel but still trendy.  Kind of like Foreign Cinema in SF.FOOD: Lots of options for $15-20 and the food portions, while not HUGE are enough for 1 person to feel satisfied. DUCK TURNOVER - enough for 1 person even though it's on the appetizer side.  Almost like a huge empanada, it has a puff pastry like outer shell that is flaky and crusty.  It also has other Mexican like toppings.  My friends said it was pretty good.MAC N CHEESE - a good thing to share with everyone, for a group of 5 (one person didn't come) we each got 2-3 spoonfuls.  It doesn't seem to have bacon but it has a bacon taste in it somehow...the pasta was a little overcooked but the cheese wasn't overpowering or too cheesy and I liked that the top was breaded and baked so it was drier.ENGLISH MUFFIN BURGER - the most bang for your buck in my opinion since it's a huge burger and fries.  The fries are rustically cut with skin still on them and pretty good.  The burger is thick, the patty is like the size of a filet mignon.  I asked for medium rare and it was more medium.  The flavor of the patty itself was a little forgettable but the cheese is shredded and then slightly melted, which was interesting.  The cheese was flavorful and added a good ""punch.""  The English muffin was also interesting, it was thin but crispy.  How an English muffin normally tastes toasted and it actually made a good hamburger bun!Overall, decent/good food, not amazing but good for what it is and a good atmosphere.",6,1,4
105,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,4.0,8/9/2018,Great for a group outing! I came here for late night drinks and bites with a big group of friends that were visiting town.

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in as the decor was very trendy, unlike many places in this area. We were seated in the back in the room with the trees and big movie screens. Pretty cool vibes - they played clips from old films and it felt like we were sitting on back patio at someone's home but we were inside.My friend and I started with drinks, and the Tuna Tar Guac which was really tasty. I then ordered the caesar salad with shrimp and my friend had the chicken and stuffed bell pepper. The serving sizes were pretty great for the price - we got more food than I was expecting. Mine was fine! It was a salad which is hard to mess up, but the shrimp was good. And my friend enjoyed his meal as well.I am not sure I would come back because as mentioned, I do not frequent this area but if you find yourself in times square and want a break from the hustle and bustle/don't want to eat at Red Lobster - definitely check out BEA.",,,

Whether you want a long meal or a few drinks before a nice of dancing, the menu and ambience here will make your night memorable.My favorite cocktail was hands down the Lavender Monk. Imagine a traditional Moscow Mule but much better, as it was less sweet and had a subtle lavender flavor. I'm a sucker for anything lavender, and this was incredibly refreshing. I also really enjoy the Empire Sunset, as very few bars in the US embrace Aperol, let alone use it in a cocktail besides just an Aperol Spritz.This place has a cool vibe and the food around me looked good, I'll have to go back when I'm in NYC again!",,,

LOL. Anyways, we got to Bea a little before they opened on a Saturday, so our wait for 4-5 of us was minimal and the service was great.  We used our 2 hour time and I feel we achieved our goal.  The food and drinks were great and I would definitely go back to here the next time I visit NYC.",29,24,26

It had been a while since having brunch here and they do it a little differently now: they serve one of everything on the menu and you can order seconds of whichever you like. I guess this is a way of filling people up with the less pricey items? Considering how uncrowded the restaurant was, I was disappointed with how long it took for each course to come out. This made me think even more that perhaps it was a method of getting us to order less food. I picked at the dishes that i probably would've never ordered to begin with as i waited for the stars of the show to be served towards the end of our two hour window, thus filling my tummy up like a fool (haha).Besides this, the food was generally delicious and the brunch experience was quite delightful.Would come back but would customize my order from the beginning next time.",1,,

The decor is beyond amazing, they have a little garden area as well as a movie area that projects old movies. I ordered the manicotti and my friend ordered the chicken with stuffed pepper.

It was quite sweet, but I liked the combination of pear and arugula. I also got the mac and cheese, which was average. Portion sizes were huge. For drinks, the Lavendar Monk was good.

Now the food -- so good 11/10 I am so glad I have leftovers because after I write this review that's exactly what I'm going to eat.  I ordered the spinach cream pasta and told the waitress to take out the shrimp, but she was so lovely and offered to substitute it with mushrooms to make it vegetarian for me.  It was honestly one of the best pastas I've had in my life, and I've had some really good pasta in the motherland of pasta, Italy.  My friend had the steak and veggies, and she, too, was thoroughly impressed by the food here.  Will definitely be back again because everything about this place -- the cosy atmosphere, the amazingly kind waitstaff, and the mouthwatering food -- is irresistible.",2,,

The staff gave off such positive vibes and were so social! The food was delicious with the exception of one dish which my cousin and Mira had ordered. It was a vegetarian dish called the Tuna Tar Quac which apparently taste like rubber. Don't do it people. I did laugh about the Tuna Tar Quac so if anything it served as entertainment.This was surprising to me because everything else tasted great; the pizza, the salad, the pasta. We had both red and white wine which were also very good. All in all I had a nice experience. I am forever grateful for friends like Mira and places like Bea :)",3,,2

This place has been my radar and saved in my bookmarks for a while and it was pretty disappointing. The atmosphere is wonderful- very cozy, unique setting with fun projections and vibey music. But the service was a little rude and rushed for an early, 5:30 weeknight dinner that we had made a reservation for. One waitress even scoffed when my date politely asked her to please discard a wrapper. The food was most disappointing of all. We ordered the tuna tar-guac which was very lacking in flavor. The tuna particularly tasted like nothing. The chips they were served with were too large and too few. We also shared the Mac and cheese which was the best of our choices but was verrrrry heavy and too rich. The mushroom pizza was my least favorite. Too much cheese and the crust was dry, crumbly and tasted like a saltine cracker. We were asked if we'd like to wrap up our food before we were even done eating. I appreciated the nice setting but will likely not return with so many other options in the area.",,,

Updated review","BRUNCH UPDATE:I came here for my birthday brunch and it was absolutely AMAZING. Exceeded all my expectations, and everyone had an amazing time. Definitely one of the best brunch deals in the city.Our table did bottomless food and drinks for $52. Certain people opted for just the bottomless food for $28 and there was no issues with this arrangement (which is fairly uncommon as most restaurants require everyone's participation). The most amazing thing: the brunch menu was served like a tasting menu!! We got 3-4 plates of everything on the menu and had the option to request more of any dish at any time. Plus, the servers brought around rounds and rounds of bottomless cocktails, even before we were finished with the prior. All in, we each had 5+ drinks over the course of 2 hours but could have definitely have had more. INSANE deal!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bea is one of my absolute favorite restaurants, period. I've been here enough times to work my way through a good portion of the menu and I have yet to be disappointed by a dish. Bea consistently delivers flavorful, interesting, and downright delicious food. Everyone person I've recommended this restaurant to has since gone back several times / would recommend to new friends. It is a little bit of a hidden gem as the restaurant is always bustling but never packed or requires too long of a wait. I've generally been able to walk in without reservations. Highly highly recommend!",2,,1

124,Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",4087,1930,2462,2.0,2/6/2018,"I was seriously disappointed by Bea. I had read so many positive reviews before booking a last-minute dinner reservation - but have to admit that most were for the boozy brunch. I should have looked at dinner reviews a bit more carefully. My husband and I were seated in the patio area at a really tiny table. There was really not much room for plates and glasses and we did quite a bit of juggling - especially when our entrees arrived before starter plates were cleared (huge pet peeve of mine). Back to the starters. The goat cheese with honey was tasty but not exactly earth shattering. The meat plate was not great. The charcuterie was presented like rolled cold cuts and wasn't very appetizing. On to dinner. The green pasta, which seemed to be the house specialty, was gummy and the shrimp were a touch undercooked. My husband's manicotti was a bit more interesting, if a little dry. The best part of our experience was our server, who had great wine recommendations and was personable. That said, dinner was an expensive letdown, and I won't be returning.",17,2,3
125,Lisa S.,"Jersey City, NJ",13,48,114,3.0,7/27/2018,"I had a brunch party here.  The place was a little dated and loud.  We had the atrium room, so that was good, but it was hot in there, the skylights make it pretty hot and bright when you sit in certain areas of that room.  The food was good, definitely a decent amount for your money, it just comes out a plate at a time, so the eggs were separate from bacon and all the good stuff was saved for last.  They started with a kale salad, then followed up with smoked salmon on toasted baguette (which was delicious).... but it took a long time to get the eggs Benedict and French toast, which were tasty but next to last.  So, that was a little disappointing....The mimosas were great and kept flowing, but the service was choppy so you had to stay on top of your waitress to make sure everyone was tended to.",,1,

The brunch is unique in that it's both unlimited drinks AND food (aka, my kind of brunch) and the cocktail list was more than just mimosas. My friend and I sat at the bar, and it was fun to watch the bartender make the drinks from scratch. He was always ready to go each time we wanted another drink, and shared recommendations based on our tastes -- he was even kind enough to make a unique cocktail for me during brunch which was great. The food was excellent, and I also really enjoyed the live jazz which was fun and fit the ambiance but was not overpowering.

Immediately when you walk in, you notice the old school movies/shows playing on the wall with great throwback music (I even heard the Ghostbuster's theme song!) They have a cool back area that LOOKS like outdoor space, but just has a  giant tree with lights on. Very cute and intimate! Food wise - we got the spicy lamb meatballs as an appetizer and they were my FAVORITE dish of the night. It comes with 4 meatballs drenched in the most amazing red sauce ever. Sweet and savory, it was a perfect compliment to the included pita bread. They also had tzatziki sauce but I didn't really have a lot since the sauce was so good. For entrees, I got the baby scallops which had LOADS of scallops with asparagus. My boyfriend got the shepherds pie. He would have preferred the portions to be a little larger for the price but taste wise was solid. Overall, a great place for brunch/dinner in Hell's Kitchen. I would say the prices are bit expensive, especially for the drinks but definitely worth the splurge",,,

Cute atmosphere with a little outdoor terrace and a live jazz band. It's best to get a reservation or you'll most likely end up at he bar(Which is fine too!).Back to the food. Yummy! All of the food was really fresh and good.  A few reviews complained about the portion sizes but we did not experience small portions. AT ALL! Most of the dishes were almost full sized portions.  We ordered the thick cut bacon and they brought out the entire pig. The French toast and smoked salmon were sooo good.

The pasta itself was freshly made and the sauce was on point! The atmosphere, interior and service is good. I really like their idea of projecting small screen of black and white movie. The second time I went, it was for my friends' birthday dinner. Again, the food was amazing. It was worth every bite and penny. The service is attentive and our waitress was very nice. One thing I did not like was that they were going to charge $25 for the cake that we brought in as a service-fee. Other than that I really like their green pasta, cheese platter, and sea bass dish.

From the start we should have known not to have high expectations as they couldn't seat our group even though we had reservations. They stuck is in a small table until something better opened up. This decision by the restaurant I believe ultimately lead to the worst dining experience I've ever had.Our table final got seated and then watched as our food and drink orders went to the wrong table. Repeatedly (over 5 times) we were served the wrong drinks. Also they had run out of 2 items on their unlimited menu with no substitutions for the day. Of the food we tried they had a few standouts - french toast, pork dish and the spinach pie. The two egg dishes were pitiful. Drinks ranged from strong to poorly made. Also most of them come out of a pitcher so there shouldn't be a wait...The cherry on top is at the end of our meal we got a new server who made the comment that in our next visit to ask to dine in his section for receive great service.There won't be a next time.

They arrived early and even they were shocked to find  the place was excessively noisy, so loud as to be painfully unpleasant. They notified me of this problem.  I needed  to cancel the reservation. Fortunately at that moment,  I received an automated message from BEA asking me to confirm or cancel my reservation . I answered with the cancel option- but then the automatic reply said that I could Not cancel. So, Why did it ask?! . The message then gave me a number to call which when called had 3 options, none of which involving a human. Two options required an additional  step: drafting and sending an email request and the third leaving a message.  I chose to leave a message. But when I tried to leave the message, the recording reported the mailbox was not operational.

I have been to Bea a couple of times for their bottomless brunch and both times have been very satisfying. Service at the restaurant for the speed of getting your food definitely depends on your server and how you order. The first time we went for bottomless brunch there, they gave us our food very slowly and lost a bunch of orders. However, the second time we went we learned our lesson and ordered a bunch of plates up front and they were able to bring out the food at a steady pace. Additionally, our server was fabulous and kept our alcohol flowing. As soon as our glass was empty she would be back with another mimosa. The food itself had great presentation for every dish. Taste wise was ok to great depending on the dish. I loved the tuna tar guac as well as salmon. Everything else is kind of standard for other brunch places and flavor wise is just ok. The pork shoulder had good flavor but was really dry. Also don't get the bacon it was just too much sauce on very dry meat not good at all. There is a time limit of two hours so definitely keep an eye on that. We accidentally got an extra drink a couple minutes after our time and were charged extra for them. Bea is also just a really adorable restaurant with great ambience. For brunch they always have a jazz band playing so it's just lots of fun to come out and eat brunch with friends!",3,1,2

The bar looked fun and happening.The service was great, we had a Broadway show to catch, so the waitress brought the drinks and food out fast. Now to the food and drinks we each had a cocktail which was well crafted creative and delicious. For an appetizer we had tuna tar-guac which was light and tasty. For the entree my fiance had Chilean sea bass which she said was great I had the market fish which was salmon and it was cooked to perfection. Overall great night will definitely be back. Thank you BEA for a great meal before a great Broadway show.",1,,

151,Michael F.,"Norwalk, CT",21,117,141,4.0,1/16/2018,"I ate here after a 2 pm Sunday matinee. It's a block or two from the bustle of the Theater District, but worth walking a couple Avenues to.After getting there post-Brunch/pre-dinner (~4:30), the bar was open, but the kitchen was closed until 5. It was freezing cold outside, so the barkeep made me an Old-Fashioned ($16) to warm my soul. After nursing my drink, it was almost time for my 5:30 reservations (made via Yelp). I made the reservations to be safe, since it's still Midtown and am very glad I did. After 5 pm, the restaurant filled up quickly. The crowd skewed NY (vs. tourist).The menu is manageable (2 pages). It leans American with a French influence. I ordered the duck turnovers (3 pieces) and the steak and tomatoes entree. The duck turnovers were flavorful, not overly flaky or stuffed to the brim with meat, and complemented with...duck sauce. The steak (7 oz filet) came with fries, sliced tomatoes, and green beans. The meal was very satisfying. Dessert was a pass. There were only two options, neither of which made me bite.The ambiance was very cute also. The charm quotient was influenced by white brick walls, vintage photos, black and white colors, curtains, a back room for events and old movies projected onto the walls [including Grease]; Kind of like the Ground Round back in the day. Add in some drinks and the tab adds up (~$100+ for two). If you're in the Theater District, avoid the tourist traps and give Bea a go.",1,,1

We made reservations on Yelp, but the hostess said the system wasn't working well when we tried to check in. (JUST AS A WARNING, so you should maybe call and confirm if you're working on a timeline...or else call the restaurant to make reservations). She told us they serve the full menu at the bar and if our name came up on the waitlist, they'd transfer our tab to a table, which was fine by us.The cocktails are great. There are so many options and they actually tasted like they were thought out well and there were some unique options. If you're into gin, they use Greenhook gin, which I actually like a lot.The food was great and the portions were medium-sized, I'd say. We got the roasted beet salad, tuna tar guac, and the green pasta. I'd say we were major fans of the tuna tar guac and the roasted beet salad. (I was on a beet kick that week, so I had eaten a lot of various beet dishes.)I'd definitely recommend trying the specialty cocktails!",2,1,1

Easily walkable before or after if you want to explore and take guests out to see more of the touristy areas of the city.Bea has a very nice, upscale, but super chic and trendy vibe. They have amazing signature cocktails and serve food in a small plates style, however they do have entrees as well.We ordered almost half of the cocktail menu as well as the appetizers and small bites. From the meat and cheese platter, the mac and cheese, the mushroom pizza, duck turnover, pork dumplings and then some, it's way too easy to over indulge yourself here because you just can't stop yourself from wanting to try more.

158,Artit J.,"New York, NY",6,51,16,3.0,7/6/2018,"I came to Bea for the first time for drinks late Saturday (almost 11pm). Our party of 4 was seated immediately, but the restaurant was almost full -- surprising for being so late. As a result, it took awhile for our drink ourders to be taken. The cocktails were good, but not amazing, and the prices are in line with the area. The atmosphere was nice - it seemed to be going for a slightly higher class pub vibe.We didn't have any food, since we had just come from dinner, but most tables around us were ordering food. It took our waiter awhile to refill water and get the check.A small nitpick but we were sitting in a booth and everytime someone in the adjacent booth moved, the back of the booth would move.",,,
159,Natacha S.,"Camas, WA",302,335,247,4.0,12/6/2017,"From the looks of this beautiful restaurant, I'm pretty sure they do not even need this review. Sounds Bea is going to be in good hands for a long time coming. The location close to the theatre district is fantastic. We were about 10 mins late for our reservation before seeing a show, and luckily, the staff was able to give another table relatively quickly. I'm very thankful because I had walked about 20 mins to Bea and I was starving. The cocktails were amazing and the food was delicious. The pesto pasta that I had was to die for. The fact that it was recommended, and yet was chicken pesto pasta (nothing out of the ordinary) was a challenge waiting to be taken. So I ordered it. I was actually really surprised at how flavorful and filling it was! The portion was perfect and the pesto literally tasted like the basil was just picked 2 minutes prior. I would not hesitate to have it again! For NYC, I also have to say the prices were actually pretty decent.",3,,1
160,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,5.0,11/19/2017,"This is my go-to spot for a post work / pre-theater / pre-MSG weekday dinner. It is not pretentious and is enough off the beaten path that it avoids a lot of the typical tourist traffic in this area.The overall ambiance is great. It has a classic feel overall and they play an assortment of black and white films on the wall. When I come here I usually get a bunch of appetizers and maybe one or two main dishes to split amongst a group of us since the appetizers are a bit more appealing. Some of my personal favorites are the blue cheese beet salad (wow - two of my favorite things rolled into one), the pizzas, and the pulled pork. I'm definitely a fan of family style meals and this is definitely a place to take advantage. This place has a pretty extensive list of cocktails and they are not over the top expensive at ~$13 a pop. I most recently had an amazing lavender / honey based cocktail.",5,,1

I couldn't tell that the beets were roasted because they tasted normal, but we both like that, so it was fine. For our entrees, he had the lamb chops and I had the chicken and stuffed bell pepper. My chicken was a big portion that was pretty good but honestly, his lamb chops were the best I've had. The seasoning was amazing! I'll definitely be back again.",,,

There are rules to the menu but I think they work and they give you the chance to try everything on the brunch menu (yes, everything). The brunch cocktails were good: Mimosa, Blushing Mimosa, Bloody Mary, Venetian Spritz, etc.  As with most bottomless brunches, there were some concerns about the timeliness of the service to get the most bang for your buck in two hours.  The service was good. Our first server got bombarded with a larger group and a new hire, Gretchen, swooped in and saved the day. She was so friendly and did not let our drinks, nor plates, stay empty for long.Overall, this was a great experience and I would definitely revisit here for another brunch.",1,,
167,Caribbean G.,"New York, NY",0,7,1,1.0,8/14/2018,"I left here VERY upset today 8-13-18 & here's why.I had to meet an old friend to catch up & further a business convo we started previously. He had meetings on that side of town so I randomly chose Bea off yelp to meet up. He arrived about 30 mins before me. Good person- The MD (I think) who is a young man greeted me with a huge smile & even tried to hold the door for me. Thank you for that! Good dish- we ordered 3 dishes: Baby scallops with asparagus- superb, the mushroom pizza- great, shrimp toast- okay. Service from manager- my friend had more interaction with the manager and said he was kind enough to ask if he wanted a table when I arrive as opposed to us sitting at the bar. I also watched him around the room just overseeing & making sure things were ok. I liked that as I was a manager for years with Tao group as well as a few hot spots in the meatpacking & 5th & now own my own in Africa so I'm huge on Customer service. Bartender- this is where 4 of my stars fell off. When I sat I noticed the main bartender, tall, Caucasian with blue bandaid or something on his thumb I assume to heal a wound. He was busy chatting up a storm with an Asian customer which seemed kinda flirtish (not my business as long as I am getting attention). The customer was drinking & I think eating a little something don't remember but definitely drinking & chatting up a storm! I turned to my friend after glancing over the menu that the guy isn't really too attentive anywhere else besides to the Asian gentleman. He said they've been talking up a storm before I came. He bar wasn't packed yet btw. Anyway he came over & asked what we are getting & I told him let me finalise the last dish with my friend. After doing that I needed his attention & waited, tried calling to him but he was busy again with this gentleman at the bar. By now I'm a little taken aback because this wouldn't fly nowhere I've worked & definitely not at my business. He eventually came over (please check cameras to see how well it matches my story. I arrived about 5:55ish) & took my order. I asked him if the scallops were the tiny ones & then gave him the rest of my order. He asked what I wanted to drink & I said give me a second to think about that & that's when his face changed, dunno why. He then placed the menu again in front of me with an attitude & continued his duties. That was it for us I guess Cuz believe it or not the last thing this guy did was Place plates in front of us in preparation for the food. He didn't come back to ask if I decided on a drink, he didn't care that my friend wanted another drink, he didn't even look back at us! Only paid attention to the Asian gentleman who was now leaving & another older gentleman came & that's where his interest laid again. Not at my friend & I. I had to ask who seems to be an apprentice to make our drinks. The food came and we had been eating a while, not once did he come ask how we were doing or how is the food. He glanced over us each time not eye contact no acknowledgement just attitude in his body language & face. We were both stumped cuz NOTHING happened! But I'm sure after this review he will lie & say we both did or said something. If that makes you keep your job luv enjoy! By now the place is filling up and he got busy. He talked to everyone else except us! We wanted more drinks but couldn't. So I said to my friend let's close the bill & go somewhere else cuz I guess our money wasn't good enough. While finishing our food a group of after work women came by us ordering with him. 1 lady in particular ordered what seems to be a beer & she took out $10 to hand to him. He goes ""it $10 -__-"" with the most condescending tone ever! My friend & I looked at each other like wow this guy must be going through it to be this nasty. The lady handed him the $10 but I guess because she didn't give him a tip why he stressed the price in that tone. My friend tried to get his attention to get the bill Cuz we didn't want to be there anymore & this guy IGNORED us! He acted like he was so busy with the ladies when the ladies were busy amongst themselves figuring out what to get! Like seriously dude WHAT HAPPENED?!!! Are you even okay? I am so lost ladies & gentlemen & I only give bad reviews if my experience with a place was absolute rubbish. We finally got the check & I wrote ""next time be nice you are rude!"" In the ""Tip"" section with only $15 as tip. Usually we tip big because of my past restaurant career. Not today though! I addressed the manager on our way out. He was busy carrying plates but I had to say something. That bartender is prime example of turning a good business bad with one negative experience. My first & last time there. Good luck shading people, you never know who you're talking down to. I can imagine the excuse you gave your manager, if it were me after watching those cameras you would at least be suspended until you realise a paying customer is why you have a job.",5,2,

Can't put my finger on the theme, but it's a cool place nonetheless.Above average food. Try the Tuna TarGuac. Better for their brunch specials than dinner. Food prices are on the cheap end for a mid-scale NYC restaurant, but they make up for their value on the food in their steep drink prices.

The truffle mushroom pizza dish was amazing, 2nd best only to Vandal's mushroom pizza. The lamb was also nearly perfect, seasoned well, but could've been more tender. I've also had better in other places, but I appreciate the effort.Drinks were probably the highlight of this place. We ordered 3 different cocktails (can't remember them now), but unable to debate which were the best. Shout out to the mixologist behind the bar.Here's where they missed the mark: customer service and cleanliness. Upon arriving, host was m.i.a. for close to 5 minutes: myself and other patrons were wondering how we were going to be seated. When one finally appeared, he directs us to seat ourselves. We roamed around the few available tables to find that all had crumbs or stains on them, which could've used a wipe down. When the waiter appeared, there was minimal introduction, appeared to be in a rush, and after we ordered our menus were never collected from the table to make space for food. Didn't know it was a CYOT (clean your own table), HYOM (hold your own menus) and SYOS (seat your own self) type of place, but this establishment can do better.

We sat in this covered outdoor-esque garden area with plants around us, exposed brick, etc. which was really nice.Food-wise, we got the duck turnover, tuna targuac, and green pasta entree, all to share between the two of us. The duck turnover was really interesting and flavorful, kind of a sweet and sour sauce with some fruity pieces which added some great flavor. The tuna targuac was also very yummy and seasoned well, and came with these interesting green rice-cake-chip things for you to spread the tuna targuac on. The green pasta (green due to spinach) was also pretty good -- nicely al dente, with about 6 garlic-seasoned shrimp.

The decor is super chic and yet homey. They have old movies playing against the backdrop of the white washed exposed brick and candles on all the tables. The decor inside behind the bar is speakeasy meets steam punk meets modern. It was very cool inside. I liked it a lot. The menu is small but incredibly interesting. I ordered the only vegetarian entree on the menu: Tomato stuffed with root vegetables, eggplant, kale and grains. It was very flavorful and just incredible. Just amazing. We also ordered mac & cheese, beet salad, mushroom pizza and few other sides. Everyone at the table throughly enjoyed their meals as well as drinks. They have a nice selection of cocktails. They do cocktails VERY well. We all got many different ones to sample all of them and they were all unique and interesting and delicious. Very well made. Great bartenders!

I hate to say but that was by far one of the worst bits of food that I've tasted in a long long time. The tuna guac had a strong onion taste and was super salty.

Other than that, the food is pretty good. My last visit here was for their Sunday bottomless brunch. Most of their items on the menu were great. The pear salad may sound boring to the palate, but trust me you should try it. It's light, well dressed, and is packed with flavor. The spaghetti was surprisingly good too. Loved the idea of the melted layer of cheese on top. It's what made the dish delicious. Unfortunately, the fried egg was overcooked so it didn't blend in very well. I did have more than one serving of their French Toast. How dare you add Nutella to this dish! *sarcasm* I couldn't get enough of it. The Tuna tar guac & eggs benedict was delicious as well. I love bacon, but nothing spectacular with their candied bacon, so I would skip. The smoked salmon was also basic.Favorite bottomless drink was the blushing mimosa. It's not too sweet and went down like water ;)",4,1,2
188,Yang F.,"Syracuse, NY",194,1,0,1.0,5/23/2018,"Bea has stellar reviews primary due to their strategic location and the constant one-serving flow of crowd. They do have a cute decor with a focus on the prohibition era and a waitstaff to match.We ordered a total of 3 dishes, the first being the ""famous"" Green Pasta (the noodles were stuck together and blatantly loaded with cream with no salt or spice). The shrimp that comes with the pasta are your precooked Costco frozen kind that are favorless and kind of bouncy. No.2 was Sauteed Baby Scallops over a bed of asparagus. The scallops was not seared as suggested by the menu but overdone. THE BED OF ASPARAGUS WAS UNCLEANED AND UNWASHED. I had sand in my mouth for every bite. I guess it gave the dish some extra crunch. DISGUSTING.No.3 was their Mushroom Pizza. It was meh. The dough consist of a lazy store-brought flatbread loaded with stretchy mozzarella. DO NOT COME TO Bea if you're looking for actual food. Come here if you have no other choice.",1,,
189,Jasmine L.,"New York, NY",38,16,1,4.0,6/13/2018,"Prompt service for a pre show meal. Had a glass of wine, the tuna tar guac, and the pear salad. Food was delicious!  When full, it's a little loud and hard to hear. Recommend!",,,
190,David A.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,39,5,2.0,5/16/2018,"What a disaster! Wow, where do I start? First we came in as a group of nine, with reservations. They sat us in the very noisy bar, on four small cocktail tables. It was so noisy, we could barely hear each other at the same table, let alone someone at the other end of our group. And the food and drinks could not fit on the small tables...of course, they're cocktail tables!!!We ordered drinks, they were okay, nothing special. We also ordered some starters, again nothing special. Here is where is got ""good"". We order our main courses and one of each side, and a few more starters. First out, the side dishes, wait 15 minutes.....then the starter, wait 10 minutes...finally the main course. We had finished all the sides before the starters, then the second round of apps, by the time the mains came out, we were full and pissed-off. As it ends up they put the same teriyaki sauce on all the beef, lamb, fish, scallops, everything... yuk! Not to mention the lamb was ordered medium rare and showed up well done. Did I mention, the water showed up after the dinner plates were cleared?Truly an awful place. Embarrassed to have guest and business associates with us.",1,,
191,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,324,577,4.0,4/21/2017,"Great bottomless brunch! Delicious food and a great variety of well made brunch cocktails as well. The service could use some improvement but everything else about the place was spot on.The front of the house seemed a bit disorganized when we reached, and though we had a reservation the hostess had given our table away to someone else. They sorted it out soon though and we were seated after about five minutes of waiting.The space is cozy and charming, and done up in a rustic yet classy sort of way. They have an additional room off to the side which was closed for a private event when we got there.The brunch, as I mentioned, is excellent! The food options are amazing and for two hours you can get as much food and alcohol as you want with the bottomless option. We sampled roughly half the items on the menu, and the standouts for us were the twice baked potato, candied bacon, and the brioche french toast. The drinks are good as well, I especially liked the Carpe Diem which was tasty and strong, and the Blushing Mimosa which was nice and refreshing.Our server was friendly and sweet, but the service was a bit slow and indifferent. At many points during our meal we were left waiting for someone to come and refill our drinks or take our order for the next round of food.Overall a great brunch deal with some really good options, and a somewhat inexperienced (in my opinion) staff. If they get the kinks in their service sorted out, they would get a solid five stars for sure.",2,,1
192,Debbie H.,"Newport, OR",0,6,0,5.0,9/17/2018,"We walked in here after a long day in the city.  We were able to get a seat right away.  Service was excellent.  Prompt but not pushy.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was cooked to perfection.  My husband had the lamb chops and he said that, while they were good, my supper was better.  Cheesecake for desert.  Tab including tip was about $75.  Only con for us was the noise level.  Diners in close quarters competing to carry on conversations over the music.  Most of the diners were 30-45.",,,
193,Sherra L.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,202,625,4.0,10/14/2017,"Finally got to try this place out after being bookmarked for a while. Came here with a group of 12 total for a birthday gathering. My friend reserved ahead of time and was able to accomdate us. The walk in into this resturant is dimmed light with music and people talking. It felt nice and cozy in which how a Saturday night should be. We got sat down quickly in a decent size curtained room for our group. All round individual tables(meant for 2)  inside which was inconvenience to sit together so we had to split 6 and 6 on one side and the other side leaving the center for waiters to walk in and out. There was definitly a Lost of socialization since it was good distance apart where as a group is usually together as a whole.Just keep in mind they charge  $25 for cutting cake which was never ever mentioned till last second we were asked to bring the cake out which was a minus.The staff were nice and easy going. They made sure we got our orders in and food & water in our table. My husband and I together,  we ordered a glass of rose, a glass of red wine, lamb meatball appetizer, sea bass, and the chicken & bell pepper. We both agreed that the drinks and foods were delicious and meet our expectations. Also keep in mind, usually if you have X many guess, they automatically charge your gratitude on the bill .  We were charged 20% for our group. Overall amongst 12 people totalling, splitting the bill of  $669 among 11 people was not too bad(minus bday girl). That $25 for cutting the cake was no bueno.",2,,2
194,Huan C.,"Corona, NY",349,334,842,4.0,4/1/2018,"Everyone loves brunch, but it is the hardest meal to ensure a great experience. I was planning brunch for a group of 8 people. The checklist required endless drinks, great decor, good food, and takes a reservation for a large party. It is a daunting task as many establishments fall short of the requirements. I was so glad that I found Bea. I initially reserved for 5 ppl but as the party size grew, I was a bit concerned. I called Bea and they said it was no problem. When we arrived, we were seated in the atrium. There is a tree in the atrium with glass roof. We opted for the endless drinks and meals ($52). It's a 2 hour limit so drink up. The food event breakdown:Ricotta with toasted bread and honey. - This is very good. I wish the bread was toasted a bit more, but the honey and ricotta were delicious. Pear Salad- It was okay. We opted just for 1 order of this. Kale Salad- It was okay as well. (We must not like salads haha)Smoked Salmon- This was great. Each bite was very well balance with texture and flavor. Asked for additional order of this plate. Sauteed Asparagus- While I avoided the salad, I did eat the asparagus. It was nothing fancy. There are times in life that you do not need elaborate food. Breakfast potatoes- Umm Yess. Carbs. At this point, you had at least two drinks so have some potatoes so you are not a mess afterwards. Spinach and egg pie-  You are taking slow breathes right about now. Your body is telling you that you are over eating and getting filled. You are debating whether to keep eating or save some space for later. If you skip this, you didn't miss much. I felt the pie was a bit underseasoned. I took a bite and opted for more drinks. Egg Benedict- I usually love egg benedict so this was a big miss for me. It was very meh. They should add a hollandaise sauce.  Pork shoulder- This was very tender and delicious. You should eat this. Baked Scrambled eggs- After the pork shoulder, this was a bit disappointing. It seems very bland and underwhelming. French Toast- This is good. I wished that they serve this earlier. At this point, you are very full. Candied bacon- This is soooo good. Order a lot, but make sure that you eat it all. If you have any space left in your stomach, this is the cherry on top. Fruit Cup- I wish this was served earlier. Recommendation- I am not sure how this would affect the dinning experience, but it would be great if we can change the order that the food came out. Also- if the establishment change the unlimited food menu in the future, I would come back. Overall, a great brunch spot for large party. Very grateful for Bea.",7,2,3
195,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",784,815,371,4.0,10/2/2017,"This is my new favorite place to eat and drink in Hell's Kitchen. I like West Bank food a lot (truffled orzo mac and cheese side for 12 is big and filling and wonderful; their chicken dish may be my favorite chicken in Manhattan). But the ambiance upstairs is sorta, well, it's fine but it's not really cooll. Bea is COOL. White brick walls and projections of black and white movies); fantastic music (a range, but always fun mix of jazz, rock, and R and B); terrific, fun, friendly servers and hosts. There are some snacks (ricotta with toast is 8 and a fine appetizer), plus full menu. Flatbreads are good. The cocktails (specialty) are all 13. That's low for infused spirits and fairly complex concoctions. I love this place, of whose existence I had no knowledge, till a friend told me to meet him and his college classmate for a drink after a show at Birdland. It's kind of a no man's land for food and the bars are not, well, it's Hell's Kitchen. Let's just leave it at that.",4,1,4
196,Sophia P.,"New York, NY",535,226,62,4.0,11/27/2017,"Cute spot with great drinks. Stumbled in here on a weekend because all the other bars were super crowded. My friends and I sat down right away at the bar, and got a few rounds of drinks. They have good cocktails, and the bartender was fun and friendly. We eventually want to turn the night around and get pickleback shots (which they didn't have), but the bartender recommended whiskey with olive juice, which is kind of my new favorite thing. She also gave us tasters of Jameson black barrel. Overall, this was a great place to sit, drink and catch up with friends.",,,
197,Alison S.,"Hershey, PA",17,201,11,4.0,11/24/2017,"I'm not sure why, but the going thing for restauranteurs seems to be NOISY. What? I can't hear you! Say that again--Noisy. Yep, that's the big downside to Bea. The food is fantastic and the service was spot-on. But it's super, super loud. I suppose that's great if you're just in for drinks with a group. If you're trying to have a close conversation with your spouse, though...not the awesomest...ambience-wise. But eat the food. It's great.",,,
198,Fallon R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,21,0,2.0,9/24/2018,"The space was super loud. We were sat in the cool looking ""greenhouse"" area, but in the winter it was freezing. The food was just okay. Wouldn't recommend.",,,
199,Nicole B.,"Bronx, NY",29,7,10,4.0,5/7/2018,"I LOVE THE PLACE. The restaurant is beautiful and unique. I love the old movies projected onto the walls. the cocktails are fabulous as well as the food. I went with a group of four we all enjoyed our meals. I and a friend had the baby scallops dish with asparagus. I had the Coco Fashion cocktail and it was great. My only critique is the baby scallop dish did not come with a carb so me and my friend that had that dish were hungry sooner than we would have liked.  Oh and our waiter was great. Very attentive, great personality and made the right amount of jokes.  I am definitely returning.",1,,
