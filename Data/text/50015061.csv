1,Ashley R.,"Miami, FL",201,56,132,1.0,1/20/2018,"Miserable experience. We brought tickets online for a night out with my friend. Not only did they keep a HUGE line of people waiting outside in 20 degree weather with no direction, but you could tell the majority of the hold up was due to poor management/operations and an inefficient screening process. Once you get in it gets worse - trashy clientele, packed crowd and no where to stand, and guest ""hosts"" that talk too much and you can't even hear the music. Definitely didn't expect this place to be so ratchet, but learn from my mistake and don't go!",7,2,
2,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",59,112,25,1.0,1/2/2016,"This place.. Went to an event here and the event itself was fine. HOWEVER it could have been pulled off better if it was not at this venue for a couple of reasons. How about you have more than four bartenders in the club serving hundreds of people?! Also the coat check system is a tragic scene as its run from an iPad. If you have an hour to spare waiting for your coat.. By all means check it. I know nothing about how this club fairs on a regular club night, but if you're looking for somewhere to have an event..no.",3,,
