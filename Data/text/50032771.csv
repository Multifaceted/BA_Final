0,Rifatul C.,"Woodside, NY",3,9,1,5.0,6/7/2018,I was at the Apple store across the street and i wanted a quick bite. I walked over to west side cafe.  It's a small place but good for a quick bite.  I had a slice of pizza and it was amazing.  If you pass by have a cheese slice. I was surprised that it tasted so good i ordered 2 more slices.,,,
1,BadApple A.,"Gowanus, NY",0,6,5,1.0,2/9/2018,"This is the worst deli I have ever ordered from in Upper West Side!!  The food was awful.  The attitude of everyone working here, all the way from manager to the delivery guy, extremely rude and insulted customers.I ordered chicken quesadillas and it didn't come with salsa, no sour cream, the chicken was like rubber.  I called and have them make a new one, they said ""fine but you have to return the other one"". I said sure!! It's not edible anyway.  Worst experience ever!",,,
2,Eva D.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,32,0,2.0,4/19/2018,"I order from here because it is close by and they deliver quickly. For the last 2 orders, I ordered a vegetable soup, assuming it is vegetarian, but was given split pea soup instead. The first time, I assumed it was a mistake, but it happened the second time I ordered.",,,
3,Kruti A.,"Chicago, IL",1,4,0,1.0,5/6/2018,Ordered delivery.  Carrot cake had mold on it...in two separate places.  Ewww.  Normally food not great but passable....this is unacceptable.,,,
4,T N.,"Manhattan, NY",14,36,32,2.0,4/16/2016,"Should have listened to the reviews here. On GrubHub they have high reviews. DELIVERY FAIL!!! The delivery person doesn't speak English, which is fine except someone at the restaurant should explain directions to him. Throughout my GrubHub profile it says how to get to my office. In the lobby of my building they even give exact directions, there is signage throughout the halls, problem is, if you can't speak English you probably can't read English. He got lost, ended up back in the lobby, they then walked him to my office and he starts yelling at me in Spanish  I said ""dude I don't know what you're saying but I get deliveries here DAILY"". He then threw my food to me and snatched the paper back and handed me a pen. Let's just say I WILL NEVER ORDER HERE AGAIN. Yeah the milkshake was good but the food was average at best and delivery sucked.",,1,
5,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",4,72,0,3.0,8/14/2017,"The guys who work here are super nice. The restaurant is a little dirty and the food is a little frozen/reheated, but it's fast and I think there's something to be said for kind employees.",,,
6,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,195,459,1.0,8/31/2014,"The last time I went, because I never went back, I noticed one of the behind the counter guys cleaning while everyone else was making food.I ordered, a gyro and greek salad, the man who was cleaning with a gray sludgy rag, by hand mind you, also took his time to toss the greek salad BY HAND.Never going back.",3,,
7,Mallory L.,"Oxnard, CA",130,495,1172,2.0,1/1/2016,"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY!!!!!I ordered Seamless and left instructions for them to call me when they got here (baby sleeping). I also called the front desk to make sure they called my cell. To make triply sure, I stood in front of the open door (for 20 minutes!) just in case they forgot to call. I DID get a call, but the delivery guy began yelling at me as soon as I picked up. ""WHERE ARE YOU? I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME! I'M GOING TO LEAVE! I HAVE OTHER DELIVERIES!"" Huh???? I told him to just come up, but he just kept repeating that he'd been waiting a long time and even said that he'd NEVER deliver to me again. After saying, ""Come up!"" 20 more times, he finally said, ""No, that is not my job. You come here!"" WHATTT?? I told him I couldn't go downstairs because of the baby and he hung up on me! I called the front desk to instruct the delivery guy to come upstairs, but they said that nobody had come with food for me. Completely perplexed, I called the delivery guy to inform him that my doorman said he was never there. Delivery guy says, ""ok ok"" and hangs up again. Five minutes later, I hear him running down the hall. He throws the food at me and runs away, never having said a word. OBVIOUSLY, he had been at the wrong address and blamed me for his mistake. I understand if he made a mistake, it happens, BUT he didn't even apologize and still behaved incredibly rudely. I have never ever been yelled at by a delivery person and treated in such a horrible way. I gave them two stars because the food wasn't bad, but I will never order from them again.",,,
8,D N.,"New York, NY",2,73,36,1.0,1/9/2017,"BEWARE!! Food is horrible. Bacon sits out for days and they just reheat it. Also the old middle eastern male cashier is terrible. I watched as he counted my change and gave me the wrong change on purpose. My total was $6, I handed him a $10 bill and he only gave me back $3 but I watched him count it twice, said okay to himself and then handed me the wrong change. I don't care if it's a quarter, it's stealing. Point blank period. Coffee is disgusting and I still can't believe he tried to rob me for a single dollar.",,,
9,Dave L.,"Brooklyn, NY",3393,2363,18242,4.0,5/24/2011,"Get a slice of their spinach pizza, and ask for everything on top. Everything. You'll get all the kinds of meats piled on top, and a crispy slice to boot. It'll set you back $4.50, but you'll only need one slice. Well, maybe two.As for the cafe, there's seating in the back, and drinks and other prepared foods for purchase.Friendly service all around.",8,6,7
10,Carlos P.,"New York, NY",20,28,88,1.0,12/29/2014,The attendant behind the counter was very nice but the food wow it was some of the worse I have ever gotten. I am sick and plan to make a complaint to the health department regarding this disgusting place immediately. I happened to be in the area and was foolish enough to buy there. Beware!!!,2,,
11,J C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,1.0,7/21/2014,This used to be by far my favorite place to order from. They are quick and the food is decent but after my experience today I will NEVER be ordering from here again. Today I ordered an iced coffee and breakfast sandwich. After sipping on be coffee for a while I looked down and noticed something sticking to the side of the cup. I thought it could have only been my imagination but no there was a COCKROACH in my drink. When I called to let management know the person on the phone told me he personally made the drink and there was nothing wrong with it. When I called back 10 mins later to speak to a manager he said that they had no records of my delivery. Poor customer service and clearly a violation of health regulations.,2,,
12,Laura W.,"Columbus, OH",137,388,1,5.0,7/10/2012,"Totally impressive. It's a diner but go in and check it out. We had maybe less than one hour by a few min to hit our movie and we got in, sat at the counter, had impeccable service and truly GOOD FOOD in under an hour. I had the Mozzeralla Caprese Salad with a side of cottage cheese (thinking it would be a side). Wow. The CC was a meal in itself but oh sooo good. Perhaps that's why it was $4.75 - you get a lot.  Drinks were refilled and we were left to enjoy our quick meal before our movie. During my week long stay in the city I ate Mozz Caprese Salad whenever I could and by far, West Side Cafe out did everyone else's.  It had the right balance of dressing, basic, peppers, mozz and tomatoes. Anything you get here won't make you sorry. This place rocked!",1,,1
13,Colmarie M.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",15,15,10,5.0,5/6/2014,"Marsha makes my mornings happy. The food is always perfect, and, if it's not, they'll make sure it is. Great service, and a great way to start the mornings. I switch from the train to the bus here, so, when I'm above ground for 10.73 seconds, I can send my order via grub hub. Even though it gives a time of 30 minutes for my pick up, it's always ready when I get there 10 mins later.",1,,
14,Shaheen S.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,7/25/2016,"This is a nice and small deli, and is my new go-to place while I work now. It has a nice breakfast and for lunch, they have almost everything imaginable, like salad, various hot dishes, pizza, sandwiches, and paninis. I have been eating there for quite a while, and I haven't gotten tired of the food there yet. I recommend this place to everyone, as the price is very reasonable, and the food is very homey.",,,
15,Emily S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",19,11,4,1.0,7/22/2014,"First off, the customer service is HORRIBLE. I waited 40 minutes to call them for a delivery... and when i had politely asked where the delivery man was, the man answered ""he already left"" AND THEN HUNG UP ON ME?! It its now 15 minutes later and i am still waiting... I just moved here and i already have a horrible first impression with them. I am disgusted by the way they would treat a paying customer. Secondly, West Side Cafe, if you're reading this_     ___GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!",2,,
16,Linda K.,"White Plains, NY",0,13,6,1.0,10/11/2016,"I'm really not sure how Delivery and Seamless have high review of this place. I ordered yesterday and the food was fine so I order again today. After an hour and a half, I contacted the deli. A man picked up. I was placed on hold for about 10min while he investigated. He then informed me that the delivery guy have my order to a man. I explained that I'm a woman and the only person that lives here. He yelled and said he doesn't know what to do about it because it was delivered. Even after his atrocious behavior, I just asked for him to redeliver the food because I was starving. He yelled and said no and stated that I live too far. He outright refused to resent even though I'm clearly in the delivery window. He said he will call delivery and hung up on me. I can't believe how unprofessional and rude this individual was. Considering the reviews below, this is a frequent pattern. I will not be ordering from here again.",,,
17,Tiffany G.,"New York, NY",0,5,2,4.0,4/12/2014,Love this place. Been coming here ever since they open. Cheaper prices than everything else on the block and the staff is very pleasant. Love Marsha and the main cook.,,,
18,Edgar S.,"Bronx, NY",102,556,145,4.0,1/20/2011,"A  good, solid,  clean, tasty deli/ pizzeria on the UWS. I heard some raves about the food, so I decided to give it a try. I settled on a Muenster Cheese Burger deluxe. I made the right choice. Everything about my lunch was solid. I left feeling satisfied, not overly full.The service is fast and the place is super clean. I'll be back for lunch.",2,,1
19,Mario V.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,56,3,4.0,7/4/2013,"Ok, so yes although it's a traditional deli, the selection for breakfast and other food items is great. And the lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly. My egg, sausage, and bagel sandwich came really fast. In and out, no frills, and satisfied.",,,
20,J M.,"Bronx, NY",0,12,0,2.0,10/8/2012,"I got two sandwiches to go from here.  My sandwich was supposed to have olives and anchovies, according to the menu.  It had neither, and I was not told they ran out or anything.  What it did have was this piece of rubbery thing inside the sandwich.  It was not a cheese.  I can only describe it as looking like a piece of sliced rubber glove.  I stretched it a bit and it didn't break or snap.  My friend said maybe it was the divider between sliced meats.  I don't know.  I didn't try to taste it.  I was sufficiently turned off by it.  The rest of the sandwich seemed ok, fresh bread and meats, but I would have liked it with the olives and without this... whatever it was.",,,
21,Anne C.,"New York, NY",37,105,8,3.0,12/12/2009,"I get my coffee here most mornings.  The staff is pleasant, the coffee is pretty standard.   The register staff can sometimes be a little slow for my taste, but I'm usually running late, so maybe that's my fault.  Haven't really tried much else here but the prices are decent and they have a fairly broad selection - pizza, sandwiches, salads, packaged foods, hot dishes, etc.",2,,2
22,Harold J.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,4.0,6/30/2010,Has a great variety of deli sandwiches and breakfast muffins. There is never a line and the staff is very friendly. I can't wait to try the pizza!,,,
