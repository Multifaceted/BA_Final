0,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",273,84,162,4.0,7/23/2018,"We came here to watch World Cup. Nice bartender, casual vibe, quirky decorations, good beer, but cash only. The crowd is the local crowd. Many people know each other, and since it is dog friendly, lots of people come here with dogs.They don't serve any food, but they do allow takeouts and even food deliveries!",2,,1
1,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",361,92,16,5.0,10/8/2018,"My favorite neighborhood bar. It's very casual, a friendly and calm environment, while still being lively. And it's dog friendly! Great cocktails for reasonable prices and a good beer list. Perfect for a casual night out in an unassuming and cozy environment.",,,
2,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,12/29/2017,"When I first drank here years ago (on a St. Patrick's Day bender, no less) I can't say I was blown away, but I came back on a tip that T&J was dog-friendly.In point of fact, Tom & Jerry's way way more impressive the second time around. The atmosephere was that of a chill neighborhood bar, albeit one that attracts Green Bay Packers cheesehead fans on Game Day.The beer selection is pretty good, with two or three interesting drafts. There's also a whole host of interesting cocktails you might try. I definitely dipped into one or two. There's a giant TV in the back to blast sporting events, too.Cons: Cash Only, weird ""regular"" in a bathrobe trying to look like Jim Morrison with a hanger in his back pocket who was extremely annoyingPros: Everything else.",6,3,6
3,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,4.0,11/14/2017,"Someone suggested this place to me and some friends so we checked it out. They're cash only but they do have an ATM at the front of the bar. The drinks are a little bit higher priced than some places nearby but they're worth it. They don't skimp on the alcohol and they're a good size so you get your money's worth. Bartenders are friendly and some of my friends even got free shots (not sure how, haha)! I had a Tom & Jerry's margarita which was delicious and pretty strong. I'd definitely come back here; the ambiance is cool and there's plenty of space. I also love how many drink options they have!",3,1,1
4,Tim E.,"New York, NY",79,9,13,5.0,7/14/2018,"We stopped into Tom and Jerry's on a HOT July afternoon, grabbed two bar stools and discover that we were both a bit short of cash for this cash only bar... we dug around in our wallets and found we had enough money between us for two drafts.... as we were getting to the bottoms of our pints... and we were so happy to be out of the heat, we looked in our wallets again and saw we still had enough cash between us to ""split"" one more pint... so we ordered ONE more beer.  The bartender asked if we were going to split it.  We confessed we were a bit short of cash, so he poured us two ""short"" beers instead... two half pint glasses... we were much pleased!  We thought that was that was very cool! Where else in NYC can you order a ""Short Beer"" nowadays?",,,
5,Tony B.,"San Mateo, CA",216,431,8015,4.0,9/10/2017,Ok so I'm walking all over NYC. I stumbled across this place. Actually the sign out from that said watermelon -beyonce- fresh pressed watermelon cocktails. Ok that's more than enough to get me in the door. Once inside you're greeted by the bartender and some cool music playing in the background. It's got that rustic look wood bar shoot wood everything. Very cool laid back vibe definitely a great place to chill. Oh yeah almost forgot it's cash only but they do have an ATM at the door. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area. Service is amazing and the vide is cool.,9,5,7

It's perfect for large groups, casual meet ups, awkward first Bumble dates, and has a solid happy hour with $5 well drinks until 7:00pm. And something I didn't notice until I began toting around a furry, four legged creature, it's dog friendly. Score.They don't take credit cards, so be sure you have cash or your ATM card in tow.",19,8,11
8,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,4.0,4/12/2017,"Cash only, yes. Get over it. They have an ATM at the front of the bar. The bar itself is actually pretty interesting, they have a lot of room near the back, tables and chairs all along the huge bar, and plenty of room for standing. We came around 8pm on a Saturday night and were able to get a couple seats at the bar and the rest of us stand around them. The bartender was really friendly, service wasn't slow. Drinks aren't that expensive either! Around 8-9$$. The vibe is definitely more low key casual drinks, great place for hanging with friends, meeting other trendy people, or discussing how big a moose head actually is.",3,,1
9,Karla A.,"Bronx, NY",344,121,136,4.0,12/21/2016,"Tom & Jerry's! Oh, my childhood, haha.Was introduced to this place by a friend and I can say I really liked it! From the interesting decor to the inexpensive drinks and great vibes, this place pretty much had it all. I'm one who enjoys sitting at a bar and have a nice conversation, and this place was just right. The bartender was friendly and seemed very experienced. Everyone else was either dancing or just lounging around with friends. The animal heads on the wall were pretty cool- definitely stared at them the whole night! You can argue that this place is somewhat divey, but it definitely has more maintenance than other dive bars.P.S: It is a cash only bar!",,,
10,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,4.0,5/5/2017,"Tom & Jerry's is a cool spot, in a very interesting location near Broadway Lafayette/Bleecker Station area.It's cash only.They serve cocktails but I've never ordered one.Music is good, easy to get seats at the bar, and the price is right.It attracts a bit of a mixed crowd, anywhere from neighborhood locals to the 20-something binge drinking new to the city young professionals that think they own the world. All makes for great people watching!",1,,
11,Chelsy W.,"Long Beach, CA",194,913,543,4.0,5/9/2018,Something about this place ??? Can't pinpoint it.May be the cutest BDAY party fro someones dog and all his doggie friends hanging out in the bar. LOVE. BEER good too,1,,
12,Marcos R.,"Miami, FL",373,492,268,5.0,6/13/2016,"Our friends from the Bowery treated us to the little spot AKA the 288.  Cozy confines, great drinks, and a solid juke box.What else could you ask for in a bar?  You want animals up on the wall? Oh they got that too.Hopefully they're fake, but they look real to me.",2,,2
13,Joey L.,"New York, NY",137,283,495,4.0,8/13/2016,"This place has the atmosphere of a dive bar, but serves up some pretty good drinks. I'm always confused by what they were going for since it's kinda dark, has some mounted animal heads along the wall, but also has cocktails. Overall, it is still a great place for everyone since there are drinks to satisfy anyone. The bar has quite a few seats and there are a few smaller tables along the side and 1-2 larger benches in the back. Be patient though as some days there is only one bartender working.*Cash only",1,,
14,Jasmin S.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,4,0,2.0,8/21/2018,"A patron yelling at and chasing a kid out of the bar soured me on this place. My friend and I enjoyed the service and atmosphere up until we got to our second round of drinks and a young child came into the bar with a clipboard asking for donations or signatures. I was surprised to see him, but I didn't get upset until a patron (seemed like a regular) started yelling at and chasing the child out of the bar. Yelling at or getting aggressive with a child are never OK. I don't understand why a grown man would do something like that or why the people working there would condone it. I won't be back. The whole incident was gross and left a bad taste in my mouth.",,,
15,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,11/8/2016,"A great casual bar for reasonably priced and well made, tasty cocktails. Came here a few times for a casual hangout, dates, a birthday party, so it fits any and most types of occasions. They have a wonderful fun cocktail menu. Nothing pretentious and cocktails mixed with quality liquors. Running for a little over $10 for most drinks. I have become fond of this place over my past several visits.Cheeky Monkey, Beestinger, Spicy Mule, Spicy Hibiscus, are namely some great cocktails off the menu. If you enjoy summery, tarty, sweet, or gin based drinks, they have plenty. The variety of flavored cocktails are great. You can of course opt for something more simple, like beer, or simpler mixes, but I think the cocktails they make are the way to go. No food menu here, but they allow you to order food from outside to have delivered there. Cash only here by the way. The space isn't much to talk about. Maybe slightly divey but clean for the most part, and mostly chill and super casual with 'bad' or weird art adorning the walls. Not a huge space with a ton of tables but the seating at the bar is generous. Can get crowded or noisy at certain nights, but it is mostly quieter and chill compared to other West Village bars. Overall, a dive with nothing but cool vibes and good drinks. Young crowds fill this bar, but they are not overly obnoxious. Definitely check out Tom & Jerry's if you need a safe, reliable spot for drinks when passing through the area.",3,3,4
16,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,615,558,3.0,2/25/2017,"Nice local spot.This would be a 4 star review, but the place is a cash only spot, which makes no sense in 2017. Aside from that slight annoyance, this place is a somewhat chill bar (maybe not so much on Friday nights) where many locals (and non locals) go to have a few drinks. It is a dive bar in nature but several ""fru fru"" drinks (like cucumber martinis) are served, so everyone can find something that he/she likes. Actually, the Friday I went the bartender was so happy that I ordered a regular beer, rather than a ""fancy"" cocktail. The drink prices are pretty in line for the the area. Brooklyn lager goes for about 6 bucks without tip. The crowd is as diverse as the music. One second you are listening to Def Leopard and the next second (or rather 3 or so minutes) you are listening to Dr. Dre. Plus, there are dead animals (I think) on the wall!!!!Often times, I want to stay longer at this place but I always run out of cash and I refuse to use shady ATMs .",,,
17,Ray K.,"San Jose, CA",5,116,92,4.0,9/6/2017,"Happened upon this place with the wife on a cool, rainy night. Stopped in here for a drink and was pleasantly surprised with the warmth/coziness of the place even though my initial thoughts upon entering was that this place could easily be a college town bar.  The side tables had a romantic vibe to them even though they had college football playing on the giant projection screen and an array of specialty cocktails written up on wooden boards posted up behind the bar - strange, I know but yet it worked (at least IMHO).The prices are very reasonable and the scene was fairly laid-back (although it could've been the rainy weather). I would definitely stop-in here for a drink or two if in the area.",,,
18,Lydia Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",86,160,8,4.0,9/17/2017,"There are so many choices in the east village when you're looking for a dive bar.  Tom & Jerry's is a good choice.The bartenders are always cool and the music is always really good and not super loud.  It's a pretty big place, but it manages to be cozy enough.High celings so you don't feel cramped, even when it's a little crowded.  There's a big table in the back if you come with a group - if you're lucky enough to grab it.Good prices for the neighborhood.",,,
19,Lisa C.,"New York, NY",236,268,129,3.0,12/30/2016,"One of my coworkers raved about this place so he really wanted me to experience it. To preface this review, I'm definitely a cocktails over beer/wine girl. I usually prefer going to hidden speakeasies or lounges to have my beverage of choice. Tom& Jerrys' seemed like a typical lower east side bar. A little nicer than a dive bar but a similar vibe. My friend really wanted me to try the Dark and Stormy so I obliged but I really didn't enjoy it that much. There's nothing against the drink but a) I don't like beer and b) I don't like ginger so yeas, ginger beer as the main ingredient didn't please my stomach. It is a CASH ONLY establishment so be aware. Prices are in the teens per drink so it adds up quickly.",1,,
20,Sean C.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,496,22,5.0,5/15/2017,"One of my favorite bars. Lots of old memories here. A bar that's not so loud that you can't hear yourself think, that's what I look for in a bar. Good beers on tap and good drinks.",1,,
21,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5477,3.0,8/15/2016,"***CASH ONLY***Not a criticism, just know before you go. There is an ATM there, for your convenience.I dunno how I feel about this place, you guys. On the fence. Lots of good and lots to be improved. For one, it's a bar. A bar with lots of alcohol to be had. It is very reminiscentnot Moe's from The Simpson's. Bar stools, benches with seating and a TV screen playing something. Today was the Olympics. That's all good. Prices are annoyingly high for the atmosphere, which was kinda sticky. But I totally understand given the chic NoLita location. Lots of neighborhood regulars here, out to have fun.I had a martini, it was shaken and tasted OK.",2,,
22,Chary S.,"Brooklyn, NY",313,260,145,4.0,5/30/2017,"I came here on a whim after a date and grabbing a square slice from Prince Pizza. First track that we walked into? Benny and The Jets. Already sold on the music. In terms of the craft selection - was simple and not over the top. Did wish they had more of a variety, but they had hard liquor from all sorts of brands. We sat at the bar, but they do have tables and spacious seating. Decor? Reminds me I'm in the woods or the owner was an animal hunter. Large Moose and Bison and all these animal heads present. LIKE MASSIVE HEADS!Crowd? Kind of diverse. If I am not mistake, it's an Irish bar? I could be wrong though. But the Bartender was cool, so was the lady! I had a memorable time. Oh, price! Not too bad for two beers for 12-15 range depending on the selection? I believe 15 with tip. This is kind of the two dollar range on Yelp vocab / terms, which is normal for NYC.",,,
23,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1723,604,7753,4.0,1/20/2015,"This bar has a down home feel to it that draws me in. I love the high ceilings, the hardwood floors, the taxidermy, the vintage Pyrex bowl's on the shelf behind the bar with lettering spelling out ""Tom & Jerry's""  and I especially love the crafty beers on top. It makes me feel at home. One night I came here with my husband and everyone had brought their pup with them. The place was crawling with K9's. My husband was in love! He's a huge fan of those who walk on 4 legs. They were running down to the basement and back and forth from the bar. It felt like this was everyone's neighborhood bar and the pups owned the place. I definitely enjoy a crowd of neighbors. Perfect spot to chill and have a beer.",4,1,3

28,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2296,4007,4.0,5/12/2014,"With a sea of establishments in downtown Manhattan you can easily flip from gem to boring hole.  This casual dive bar with an Indy edge, a splash of guyish and a dash of no airs lovingly falls into the gem category. The older humble kind gentleman bartender with the bow tie, who felt like a cross between coach from Cheers and Frasiers Father, was friendly, familiar and a bit surreal in the midst of a modern 20s-30s crowd.The large moose head, the wood floors, or were they dirt?, all give it the classic bar touch, just well worn, with a soundtrack of 90s Indy tunes like Sonic Youth and Pavement on my visit.   Hipster lite.  Kind of clean, in a college dive bar way.",3,5,3
29,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",808,1305,3040,5.0,7/10/2014,"A dive bar with a lot of character.

It was pretty crowded when I went on a Thursday night, but luckily seats opened up while I was ordering my drink.  The bartender was very sweet and asked me what I wanted right away.  I got the jalapeno margarita which was unfortunately disappointing.  It was more sour than anything else, wasn't spicy or strong.  Overall, I would come back here for happy hour because I like the vibe, but not to fill my spicy drink addiction.",9,6,11

There are a good number of tables, but this place is packed every time we come here. I usually can manage to get a seat at the bar though. The signature drink is what keeps me coming back - Hendrick's and their homemade cucumber limeade. It's the bomb. The biggest down - it's cash only. And not only that, their ATM charges 2 bucks processing fee, not cool. The biggest up - it's dog friendly!

Great service, cool vibes & the music is just what it should be in dive bar!Big ass drink selection and if you don't like what you see on the wall the kick ass bartenders will brew you up something good...like any good dive bar does!The toilets are toilets.

He shoved everyone out of the way as he cleared the floor of glasses and said ""you have to stand clear of this area for obvious reasons"" before even asking us kindly to shift ever so slightly out of the way. He was extremely rude and multiple people around me in various areas around the bar noticed.

Updated review","I stepped back into Tom & Jerry's now over 5 years since my last review, and I feltthat it had not changed one bit.  The drinks were still affordable; the bar was still packed with a great looking, yet causal and unpretentious, crowd; the staff was still positive and friendly; and the background music was still entertaining and at the perfect decibel.  I could mention how my Watermelon Cooler and St. Germain Cosmo were just OK, or how the bar was annoying cash only, but there were just too many other reasons to praise this laidback and cool bar.  Also worthy of note would be the fact that Tom & Jerry's would act as an appropriate venue for various occasions - birthdays, dates, and certainly happy hour.",6,3,3

However, past 9 it turns into the typical NYU college scene.

In an area with a decent number of bars and restaurants, I didn't find Tom & Jerry's until recently. It's a long bar with perfectly sized wood benches and tables for 2-4 people, and a huge list of specialty drinks to go along with a solid list of beers on tap.Behind the bar is shelving with tons of bowls with Tom & Jerry's emblazoned on them. What does that mean? Is it owned by a Tom & Jerry? Nope. Tom & Jerry is an egg-nog like drink and typically served in bowls.  Something learned every day.Great music in the background, and at least during the day/early evening this place is pretty busy. It might be more suited for an older crowd, but I think if you like a place with solid beer and a place to sit, you'll enjoy this spot. In my opinion, this is a great spot for a drink, and it's the kind of spot where a drink can turn into several drinks. When I was here last, a party with catered food had ended and the party group offered up leftovers to everybody. Free food is good food!Considering I'm a frequent visitor to the neighboring movie theaters, this will definitely become a pre-show destination.",2,,2

But, fear not, there are still places around town where you can snag yourself some HH specials. Tom and Jerry's is a great dive bar in NoHo where you can grab $5 drinks.Beer, wine and well drinks are all included in their HH, but you can also check out their wall menu full of fun and tasty cocktails and martinis. Tables are a hot commodity there, so get there early if you want to get one, or, just awkwardly hover over people who look like they're about to finish up soon so you can scoop theirs up. The walls are covered with moose and other wild life heads. I went for one of my favorite beverages, a Jalapeño Margarita. And, it was a good one.",,,

The bartenders are really nice and accommodating for all the random drinks our group ordered. It's a pretty small/narrow place but and while it did get somewhat crowded, to be expected, it somehow didn't feel overwhelming.

Bartenders were super nice, attentive, and made drinks quick and strong. I loved the bar decor and ambiance - almost makes you forget you are in NYC because it has a bit of a small town feel, but also seems a little hipster at the same time.

When I say 'comfy' I don't necessarily mean that you'll get a comfy seat to sit on, as it often gets pretty crowded and there are just a few small tables on the perimeter to claim. I'm more referring to the laid back atmosphere and low key decor - no sceney vibe here which I appreciate. They have plenty of creative drinks posted up behind the bar to try out, or you can go with your old favorite. I wouldn't say the bartenders I've had have been the sweetest in the whole world, but they're fast and courteous so that's good enough for me. No food to speak of so don't come super hungry, but they do have some weird bags of chips that they sell behind the bar, and I'm not positive but I believe they allow you to get food delivered there.

The music was loud.  The kind of loud where you have to yell to converse.  The tunes ranged from Black Keys (a plus) to potentially Katy Perry or some other poppy top 40 hit.  I have been here before when it was much less crowded and way more mellow and had a much better experience.  I'll revisit again if I'm in the hood on a weekday night.  ** Cash only",2,2,2

I like the taxidermy heads hanging from the wall. It gives it that rustic manly man look. Though, again, we were here after a ridiculously never ending brunch and taking in the winter Olympics on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks back. They have an enormous list of fancy cocktails with interesting names. Irish Apple Sauce, Maple Manitoba, Cheeky Monkey (which is just a Pimm's Cup). At least they are clever and not boring. My friend went with a Blackberry Martini of sorts and I tried a sip. It was delicious and not too strong. Being a cheapskate I just had a beer. Their martinis on non-happy hour prices are Manhattan priced and like $14. It's both divey and kind of expensive. I imagine it makes for a great place to get an after work cocktail more than anything else. They were also shockingly animal friendly.

It is not a sports bar and I think having a huge brightly illuminated television screen in the back of the bar (where most of the seating areas are) playing sports ruins the otherwise quaint hip vibe of the place. The drinks are phenomenal and the bartenders (specifically the older guy I forget his name!) are very sweet. I actually forget the name of the drink I got (ginger and honey something?) but I had a sip of my friend's which was called the watermelon cooler. It is so refreshing and light but also has a strong alcoholic kick to it. It might just be part of their seasonal summer menu but hopefully the bartenders can make it if requested any time. It's not the best place to come in a big group since there are limited seats but I think coming with 2 friends is perfect. Fun spot overall.,,,

Not to say, I have not been here past 9:30p but rather I'm on a different mindset than I was when I come here around 7p. The bartenders are pretty cool, but can be slow at times.

The hot toddies were a nice respite from the frigid cold outside. They also had a fair amount of beers on tap including seasonal winter brews to match the cold.Service can be spotty since there is only 1 bartender. The place was fairly empty so we never had a problem getting drinks.

The bartender was friendly but I felt she was extra nice to the guys and ignored me when I tried to order from her. Girls don't order drinks at bars? Anyway, it's a unique bar and super chill.

Plus, they play fun, upbeat music that folks can dance to in the back (if you are so inclined). Just off Houston enough that it feels more like a neighborhood spot than a touristy, destination location.

Sure there is plenty of nightlife, but its mostly specialty cocktail bars, and wine bars, and tapas bars... Tom and Jerry's is a welcome reprieve from all of the more fashionable venues in the area.They have normal beers at normal prices, with some nice craft brews on draft. The atmosphere is dark and dive-y, with plenty of seating and a giant taxidermy moose-head that tends to intimidate me.You can bring your dog, you can bring your posse, you can bring a pizza (its true, I've seen it done!)

It was my first time here; my husband has been there a few times as it's a ""Packer Bar"" -- he's a fan. Anyways, my experience...We walked in and went straight to the back of a bar where a big screen is playing the game. The bartender is nice, and fairly quickly gets us both served. He gave my husband a taste of a couple beers; nice, but also pretty standard amongst good bartenders. Between the 3rd and 4th quarter, a group of 8 or so, standing near the back left. The bartender then promptly shuts off the projector... what?? When asked why he did that, he said that there weren't enough people watching and so he wanted to save the bulb... we can watch from the TV above the bar. The position of the TV wasn't idea, but fine. The problem is, the story doesn't end there. A minute later, a girl came up to him and asked why the projector was off, he told her and she explained that her group is at a table which isn't in view of the TV (most tables wouldn't be able to see it). She asked him to put it back on and he said, ""No, sorry."" I about died. I've never seen someone in the service industry so unwilling to make their customers happy. To top of off, I ordered another drink, and a water along with it. I was shocked at how annoyed the bartender seemed to have to give me a water, with a drink. Long story short -- would I recommend this is a 'sports bar'? No. Would I recommend it as a regular bar? No. There are a bunch of great bars in the area and this isn't one of them.",1,1,1

She gave me a dirty look and then went on her way, only to come back and try to justify what she was saying and then giving us a dirty look the while we finished our drinks.  I use to tend bar and I always took care of my customers, so they would continue to come back and I would be taken care of.  I agree there are things you shouldn't have to do, but to say a rail vodka with soda water and cranberry is too expensive to replace is idiotic.  It maybe cost the bar $1 max to make, and to piss off a group of customers over that, was foolish.We finished our drinks, left the bar and proceeded around the corner to Slainte.  The bartender was AWESOME, friendly, smiled, gave us a beer on the house and we tipped well.Here is a lesson for blondie at Tom and Jerry's:  Thanks for ruining my experience, I hope you enjoyed your $2 tip while you competition enjoyed their $25 tip.   You cost your bar owner over $100 in sales and cut yourself short...good job!  Oh, and learn to smile and lose the attitude...if you don't like your job, then quit and let someone else work that doesn't give the bar a bad wrap!",5,2,

Can't remember but I had quite a few. Could go for one now.Compared to how crazy and noisy Von gets on a Friday night, I'd go for Tom and Jerry.",,,

I'm not talking about ""blenderize 3 spirits you'd never mix for yourself and call it the T.G.I.Over"" or summat, I'm talking cucumber-infused limeade ambrosia sitting in a giant demijohn on the bar, just begging to be mixed with Hendrick's and ice.

It's definitely got the divey feeling, but the crowd is a little more posh, and the space is large.

Ah, Nostalgia, with a capital N.I really like T&J's as far as neighborhood bars go. Friendly bartenders, good drinks, and a large space so that you don't feel crammed in like sardines. To me, it feels like a transient bar--a good place to include in your bar crawl, or stop in if you were walking by. But not necessarily a place to stay all night (unless, of course, you get sucked in, which can easily happen anywhere). Whenever I've gone with friends, it doesn't seem like anyone stays seated for long. It's a lot of getting up to get another drink, or to smoke outside, or to just stand up and talk. In other words, very relaxed and laid-back. It's not necessarily a place I seek out, but if I'm in the area, I like to stop in for a drink (biggest draw here is the beer in my opinion). If you're with a large group of people, hopefully you can secure the large bench in the back. Like having an indoor picnic!",5,4,5

I had a really fun time with my friends and with the easy-going, friendly crowd. I would hang out here. There was also like a group of bikers and some chads, but even they were nice. We all just partied. It was the bomb. Made some great friends in this place. In any case we all watched Conan's last episode without audio, but had a blast. Couldn't believe he had Billy Gibbons and Beck with him. I would recommend this bar to anyone who doesn't have an attitude. Great spot to just chill with friends. I haven't tried to pick up a chick at a bar in a long time, but I feel like it might be easy here. The people are just nice. Check this place out. Get them to play Bittersweet Symphony.",1,1,1

182,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,2.0,4/30/2010,"I'm reminded of Yogi Berra's Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded. Crowded it was, at least when we got there. Mostly college or just post college age. As friendly as starving rodents. Unlike most of New York, where drinkers stand and eaters sit, at this bar EVERYBODY wants a seat. I hung over a table waiting for the girlfriend to come back from the bathroom so we could snag the table when they went back home to do the deed. When the girlfriend returned... pow! Some little girl ducked under me and shouldered me out of the way. She and her boyfriend then ignored everyone else to talk about their failing romance. There are a lot of stuffed animal heads on the wall, and a decent chalked list of single malts... and that's it. You fight your way to the bar, the bartender will pour your drink (beers $6 plus tip), and then you're on your own. I don't get the draw. The music is at a volume that'll let you talk... but try finding someone who wants to talk! So we talked with each other, and left.-- Drink Club NYC is a roving group of New York drinkers",,,

I organized a work happy hour here and Jo was really easy to work with and accommodating. Tom and Jerry's allows you to bring in or order food which was a big plus for us. We ordered food ahead of time but they also have a collection of delivery menus if you want to order once you get there. I would definitely hold another happy hour here.,1,,

This is my friends' favorite bar and since my friends are the coolest it is no surprise how cool the people are here.Go during the week and you will meet a blend of people like me who just want to get after-work pissed and internet moguls/creatives using the bar as a virtual office for beer induced meetings.

188,Adam V.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,28,2,4.0,11/30/2006,"Tom and Jerry's is a quiet unassuming bar that I one day stumbled into accidentally. They've got beer. They've got a giant movie screen that I always sit facing away from, so as not to stare at and offend whoever I'm hanging out with. And most importantly, they've got a wall full of dishes sporting the bar's namesake.Some folks were once sitting a few tables away celebrating an Oscar win for best independent short documentary (or something like that). The Oscar award was sitting right there in the middle of the table. This is kind of bar you go to, to give yourself a pat on the back after a job well done.",2,,3

When we walked through the doors I knew instantly it was the right choice.Tom and Jerry's is a quiet, cool neighborhood dive with enough class and self respect to avoid the trash chic that pervades so much of the village these days. There were no NYU brats experimenting with vodka tonics or Brooklyn Lagers. Rather, we were surrounded by adults, good music on a digital jukebox and a very cool bartender named Vanya.The ambiance was perfect for a Monday afternoon. Intimate, not desperate or depressing. Upbeat without the annoying self awareness (the 'oh my god, we're so special because we're in New York' vibe) that's so hard to get away from.A Jameson neat cost me $7, which is a little expensive for a weekday afternoon.

The decor is lively and the bathrooms clean. But why not 5 stars? Be aware this bar is cash only, although there is an ATM ($2 charge).
