0,,8/25/2018,119,,"New York, NY",Melissa P.,527,4.0,301,I came here for brunch and it is a pretty good deal for brunch in the upper east side. About $17 for a brunch entry and 2 complementary drinks (can be alcohol). I got the avocado toast with scrambled eggs and a side salad and my husband got the all American breakfast. The avocado toast was very good (even though it was more like a guacamole like texture) and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The salad that came with it was a nice touch. My husband also enjoyed his breakfast and the bacon was perfectly cooked (very crispy). We also sat outside in their backyard which was nice.,

Overall ambiance was greatPrice point for brunch was great! Unfortunately, my meal was not. The fries were great but the NY strip steak was terrible. Quality of meat was so awful I had to give it to my boyfriend who agreed to it being terrible, but still ""eatable"". Service was mediocre.",

Updated review",148,2,"Melville, NY",Andrew C.,2321,4.0,638,"This is one of my favorite Irish Pubs in the UES that I have been too often to for lunch or just to watch late night sporting events with friends. A very cozy friendly atmosphere where you can easily meet new friends or just enjoy watching a game on their flat screens at the bar. My favorite experience at this restaurant is the walk to the Men's lavatory. It's a narrow staircase that has short steps that require good balance while walking down. If you have any issues going down the stair case such as tripping, falling, or just rolling down the stairs. Once you find your way back up the stair case, just ask for a check, say thank you to the bar tenders with a favorable tip, and then go home for the night. I love the Doc Watsons's.",7

I'm watching her write a 1 star review of this place, which I think is totally unwarranted. So I decided to write my own. This is my first yelp review ever. The staff has been extremely nice to her. And offered to try to remake her order as requested. Her rebuff was ""I just want to leave now!"" Very dramatic. For me the staff has been extremely attentive, nice and fun. The food was excellent. Try the French Soup. It's amazing. Thank you for a great Friday night Doc Watson's!",2

Gave 4 stars just because the bar was taking a while to get us our drinks, but the atmosphere and food was good and food service was fast.",
6,,6/21/2018,129,,"New York, NY",William N.,26,4.0,47,"Doc Watson's is everything I seek in my neighborhood sports bar: a comfortable but not overly casual atmosphere, universally viewable TVs, a selection of local IPAs, and a reasonably priced homemade veggie burger. What's more, it's airy when the weather's nice, and the staff is always friendly and (generally) attentive. Doc Watson's is certainly among the neighborhood's top spots for a casual drink or dinner--particularly if there's a game to watch.",1

8,,7/15/2018,171,,"New York, NY",Carly L.,229,3.0,239,"Came here for a work party last week. The downstairs patio area that they reserved for us was beautiful and enough space for everyone in my office. We had the option of paying drink by drink or $36 for a 2 hour open bar (including tax and tip). As for the drinks, the Captain and Coke was so weak, I wasn't sure if they had actually forgotten to add alcohol and had just given me soda. However, the Bourbon Smash was delicious! I wish they had given our waiter some help though; he was the only server for our whole party, and as a result service was super slow and most people didn't get their drinks at least once. People who paid for the open bar felt like they didn't really get their money's worth. He was nice and it wasn't his fault; he just should've had some help. The other servers got angry when some of us tried to go up to the bar and get our drinks ourselves. Overall, I wouldn't recommend having a party here, but if you're going to stop by for a casual drink, stick with their specialty cocktails.",1

Updated review",66,,"Manhattan, NY",Erin H.,3,4.0,9,"The best by far Irish bar on the UES!  The bartenders and waiters are amazing.  Suggest one major upgrade that needs to happen, the Ladies room is beyond small.  2 little stalls with broken doors and no room to let anyone in when another person is washing their hands needs to be addressed.  Otherwise the best bar!!!",
10,1,11/18/2017,293,,"Los Angeles, CA",Chandler W.,110,5.0,83,Honestly the best pub food I've ever had! Definitely recommend the mushroom mac n cheese. It's super rich and delicious. I also had the kale salad with chicken and the creamy goat cheese and whatever dressing they serve with it is SO GOOD. My grandpa got the shepherds pie and absolutely loved it as well. Waiter was so nice and friendly! Would absolutely go back.,1
11,1,4/19/2017,140,,"Manhattan, NY",ChingWa C.,271,5.0,164,"Sunny warm Sunday Morning. Random stroll on 2nd Ave. Spotted this amazing $16.95 brunch deal (1 entrée + 2 drinks) and just could not resist it. Their brunch menu is very traditional with egg benedict, waffles, French toast, salad, burger... etc. I got the turkey burger and it was very good for its price, but at the same time, burger is burger. I have never had a burger that blew my mind away. For the drinks, I got two Bloody Mary's and they definitely got a good kick of spiciness. If you don't like having alcoholic drinks, they also have coffee, juice ...etc. We got a seat by the store front and the windows were wide open. With the 70 degree summer breeze softly brushing past my skin and a yummy glass of Bloody Mary, I could not ask for more!",2

14,,5/27/2017,52,,"New York, NY",Gwen G.,1105,2.0,188,Weather was partly sunny in the morning and a garden brunch would be appropriate. Ended up in this place. They have a garden on the first floor but not appealing. The window at the back overlooking the garden area and outside was the best seat. Food was disappointing. Bland and unsavory. The mimosa is good though. It took almost an hour for for them to serve the food. Slow service and unpalatable food.,

18,,2/2/2017,439,,"Queens, NY",Liana L.,1785,4.0,610,"The price is great ($16 for entrée + 2 drinks during weekend brunch), the ambiance is cute, the service is fantastic and the portions are huge - all great stuff. Honestly, if I didn't cook so much, I would probably give Doc Watson's 5 stars; they focus on pretty standard brunch food. Unfortunately, the menu overall doesn't interest me that much and the food is done fine, but not spectacularly. I initially came here because I wanted the jumbo crab cakes and Raymond loves corned beef hash, but it turns out that the crab cakes are no longer on the menu. The corned beef hash is, though, and it's good. So we came back because it is a really great deal. Unfortunately for me, I don't like ordering the same thing as the other person I'm eating with, so I was forced to stare at the menu for long minutes while I eliminated everything and then went back to try to figure out what I would get. Since I don't drink alcohol or coffee and I don't want to drink too much juice, I found it hard to justify any of the options for the price. (It's well worth it for Raymond, who gets a coffee + mimosa + the corned beef hash. I heartily recommend this combo. 5 stars). I got the smoked salmon hash the first time and the traditional Irish breakfast the second time. Both were fine, but I wasn't thrilled with my entrées; instead, I kept trying to eat Raymond's corned beef hash. Oops. (The black & white puddings were actually sausages - nothing weird). Overall, I do think Doc Watson's is great - the waitresses are really sweet, the food is good and the prices are low.",3
19,,5/14/2018,173,,"New York, NY",Kelsey A.,3,1.0,18,"Doc Watson's overcharged my card. I've called the restaurant 4 times, left messages for the GM and now leaving this poor review is my last resort at getting someone... anyone.... to call me back.

My only disappointment is that I wanted something in place of the cherry tomatoes  that come with it.  the waiter said that they were not able to swap them out for another ingredient...I was confused because it isn't a pre-made salad...so why can't you substitute it for something that would be both cost permitting and delicious for the customer?

There was so much filling that it tasted like a falafel. I even asked to make sure that it was the turkey burger and was assured that it was.....although the server only checked the inputs in the system instead of actually looking at my burger so god knows if the kitchen made a mistake. The fries were frozen and only fried once so they got soggy really really fast. Shame that this happens to potatoes.The service was pretty much non existent because I sat in the front area. The servers only paid attention to the back. Every time I needed anything, I had to walk half way through the bar to get the servers attention. Forget about being checked on.",1

30,,11/30/2017,26,,"Manhattan, NY",John C.,0,5.0,2,"Doc Watson's is a cozy, yet vibrant, pub chock full of character and a welcoming bar and wait staff. They have a classic, dark-wooden bar that stretches most of the restaurant which pairs well with the fantastic beer list. It's perfect for an after work drink, a delicious bite to eat, or a full on boozy brunch. The food is classic pub fare, and it absolutely delivers. There is a downstairs area with a fireplace for relaxing, as well as a patio out back for when the weather is nice. The best part is that there are windows in both the front and back, so it never gets subject to that dark, dingy vibe that plagues so many other bars. Say hi to Sarah - the Manager - or Teresa behind the bar and you'll always get a warm welcome!",
31,5,1/8/2016,824,2,"Manhattan, NY",Chris M.,147,4.0,153,"Solid neighborhood bar in Yorkville.This has been one of my favorite local hangouts for years.  There was a time in my life when I lived a stone's throw away from this place, and my roommate and I would come here every Thursday night.  Although I have since moved northward, it has not stopped me from grabbing a beer whenever I am nearby.Doc's screams Irish pub, and I love it.  Friendly bartenders, staff, and patrons makes it a welcoming place as soon as you walk inside.  There is plenty of space between the bar in the front, dining tables near the back, a lounge downstairs, and two outdoor seating areas.  Televisions broadcast sporting events of your choice, and music is provided via jukebox or live performances.  There are adequate amounts of songs to please the Millennials, but nothing beats when a traditional Irish tune (Wolfe Tones, Dubliners, Pogues, Irish Rovers, etc.) starts playing.  Food menus (lunch, brunch, dinner) are pretty good for satisfying growling stomachs, and the drinks are great for wetting your whistle.  They really do pour a solid pint of Guinness.I highly recommend coming here for a casual drink and meal while enjoying good conversation and music.  See you soon!",9
32,,8/18/2017,0,,"New York, NY",Gina F.,0,1.0,14,"We came for the English Breakfast and were happy to find that brunch came with two drinks. The food was good enough. We liked the seating in the back with the big, open window. The waitress took our order and then never came back over to the table. After another employee brought our food we eventually got up to ask for condiments and second drinks. We finished eating and were chatting, waiting for the check but my drink never appeared. We spotted our waitress directly across from us, sitting with a friend enjoying a meal at a table overflowing with food. We figured she would eventually look over but never did. Finally, I went over to ask for my drink again and she looked at me as if I was a crazy nuisance and did a slow, half head turn in her seat and said ""can someone get a mimosa"" ... to no one in particular. She was even sitting at the first table directly in front of the bar. A different employee motioned to the bartender who looked over lazily from drying a glass and wallowed over a few minutes later. It was so uncomfortable and bizarre. When we initially sat down, the couple at the table next to us had been waiting a while for their check and eventually the man got fed up and walked over to take care of it. They didn't seem happy. If you get the waitress with blonde hair, bangs, and glasses you might as well tell her to go enjoy herself and you'll get your order to the chef yourself, tip a runner to bring it to you when it's ready, and walk up to the bar for your own drinks.Such a bummer.",2

The prices are excellent and I'll continue to come back!  The restaurant is definitely nothing special to look at, since it's just a classic bar, but the garden is great in the spring/summer for sitting outdoors (that's not just on the street!) The brunch deal is what makes Doc Watson's great. For just $13.95, you get an entrée and 2 drinks, alcoholic or not.  The portions are a good size too. I went for the big kahuna today and opted for the crunchy French toast. I usually don't do sweet breakfast dishes, but I heard about the crunch French toast and just had to try it. It did not disappoint.  The only thing that would have made it better were if it was served with real maple syrup and not packaged Heinz syrup.The other great item Doc's is known for is their classic old school ""chip-style"" fries.

No problem I was told. The food was delivered in a very timely fashion. And my only caveat here and the reason for four instead of five stars is that the chicken and the mushrooms were so incredibly salty we could not eat them. I called the restaurant, again no problem, they would be glad to replace the meal. By then it was late and I said no that I would come in on the weekend and give them another try. I did that. This time I ordered a burger rare and fries. Again the staff was very accommodating. The burger was well done . They took it back immediately and brought me one that was done to perfection. The fries were fresh and delicious. The surprise at the end of the meal was that John, the owner, came right over to the table, sat down and continued to apologize profusely for the problem.True to his word there was no charge. I will definitely go back but will always be sure to ask him to go easy on the salt.The front of the restaurant is very much like a sports bar, big screen TVs , and quite noisy.

Saw the Tuesday craft beer and a burger/fries special for $12. Good deal and Lagunitas IPA was a nice choice to wash it down with.Have to say I enjoyed this quickie meal here. Had the Smokey BBQ burger that was piled high with frizzled onions and accompanied with those round cottage style french fries. Large sized pint glass of beer with it. No complaints as the burger was cooked just right, was substantial enough, the fries were tasty, and the beer was cold. Plenty of screens around with the ball games on. Sat at the bar where the service was attentive and friendly.   Doc Watson's is a typical Irish type pub as seen here on the UES. Victorian like lamps hang from the ceiling. Dim lighting. Lots of pictures on the walls. Dark woods. Large bar. Plenty of seating. Back room dining area. Ouside seating on the sidewalk. Flat screens all around. 90s - current rock music playing. Food and drink specials during the week from 4-12pm. It's a nice, homey, and almost cozy atmosphere. Looked like a dozen beers on tap. Standard mix and a few crafts. Lagunitas IPA was a decent one, and I also saw Boddington's, Guinness, and Angry Orchard by the glass. Pretty large sized food menu for a pub too.Did not experience any of the slow service as others spoke about in their reviews. I'm sure it does get slower when really busy as it can be on weekends. Received my food quickly and cooked as ordered. Was asked a few times if I wanted another beer. All good. Also, there was a chalkboard sign on the sidewalk promoting $5 frozen drinks, $5 sangria, $5 Angry Orchard, and  $5 summer comfort cocktails all evening.

The soup was creamy but you still get that acidic tomato punch. I tried a couple bites of the shepard pie and thought it was flavorful and moist as well. My only complaint is the quesadillas.

It's a happy hour place - how can you NOT split checks at the tables?Good atmosphere, too. It's chill enough that you can hear each other if you sit at a table near the back, but not so quiet that you feel like you're in a weird dive bar or anything.

There are high top tables immediately when you walk in and in the back the bar opens up into a small dining area. The highlight of the place is definitely the outdoor seating area in the back. If you're lucky enough to snag one of the few outdoor seats you could spend hours drinking the day away on a Saturday afternoon. If they're all taken, the upstairs dining area is a decent alternative since it has large windows which open above the outdoor seating area and help provide an ""al fresco"" feel. FoodI wasn't expecting anything fancy from the menu at Doc Watson's since it's your run-of-the-mill bar. A burger seems to be the appropriate thing to order at a bar so I opted to try:Doc's Squealer: Bacon infused with frizzled onions, mushrooms and bleu cheese (How could you not order something with this name?!)Let me just say, Doc Watson's doesn't skimp on quantity. This burger was big. A large patty with pieces of bacon cooked inside it was topped with lots of thin fried onions, plenty of chunks of bleu cheese and mushrooms. This was all sandwiched between two extra thick hamburger buns with a wooden stake through it to keep it all together. The burger was good, but far from great. Despite all the toppings, this burger lacked any lasting flavor and I found myself constantly trying to figure out why that was the case. The meat was overcooked and I couldn't really taste the bacon in the 'bacon infused' burger. If anything, the bleu cheese stood out as the dominant flavor, but that's not surprising considering the strong flavor it has to begin with.ServiceAverage burger, average service. Our waitress started off very friendly and even joked around with us. (I'm a huge fan of this.) However, by the end of the meal, she was extremely unfriendly and practically threw the bill at us without bothering to say thanks.ValuePrices were average for a burger. The Doc's Squealer was $14. Careful though, Doc Watson's charges extra for everything. My coworker, Anisha, was charged an extra $2 for a side of ranch dressing. I mean, seriously? The bill came out to around $50 for the two of us, which seemed to be more than it was worth.The VerdictDoc Watson's is the definition of average. Average atmosphere, average burger and average service. Is this a great place to have some drinks, yes. Is this a great place to have some food, no. I don't live on the Upper East Side, but even if I did, I probably wouldn't head back to Doc Watson's anytime soon. There are lots of other places nearby that boast better food at the same prices.",1

130,5,6/28/2011,1475,1,"New Orleans, LA",Jonathan N.,53,4.0,258,"In many ways Doc Watson's is a typical pub. There are lots of beers to choose from, plenty of TVs to watch your favorite team, a packed house on Saturday nights, and even some live music. But Doc Watson's also comes with some atypical flair, which sets it apart from the many imitators on the Upper East Side bar corridor that is Second Avenue. For one thing, there's the food. Of course you can get wings here -- and you can even get three for a buck on Monday nights! And of course you can get burgers, fries, nachos, or even a Caesar salad. But you can also get a salmon sandwich, pork chops, lobster ravioli, and a grilled portobello salad. That's not typical bar fare. Granted, it may not be the best food you've ever tasted, but it's certainly passable and it's nice to have more options. Then there is the layout. There's the usual giant bar with plenty of stools that will allow you to cozy up to the friendly staff, but there's also outdoor seating in front and a back garden in which you can enjoy the summer breeze with a refreshing beverage and some buddies. For the best of both worlds, try snagging the tables in the back when the floor-to-ceiling windows are wide open. On the weekends, prepare to be crammed into tight spaces and to wait in lines for the bathrooms downstairs. But it's always a good time with both staff and patrons eager to enjoy themselves.

I actually think I had one of those deja vu experiences where I may have been here before (my roommate had me meet her either here, or at another bar similar one night when it was really crowded about a year ago). I'd never eaten the food even if it WAS the place I thought, so I figured... let's try it out.Melanie L. was along for the adventure (remember her from the High Line review?). We sat way in the back since the window was open and we could get a nice breeze. I ended up getting a burger with onion rings (fat kid HEAVEN!) and she... I'm not even sure what Melanie got. I think some sort of 'try all of our apps!' type of deal. It looked delicious, whatever it was. I ate way too much way to fast, which is the sign of some great bar food.The service was okay... we had a cute little blonde Irish lady complete with accent and charm. It wasn't really that busy (business was leveling off while we were there, since it was 10ish), but I can't say she was super attentive; she was adding up bills or something and I felt mostly forgotten.

162,,2/20/2010,50,,"New York, NY",Meri S.,0,3.0,137,"At the outset, I'd like to state for the record that I am upset that they removed the pool table from downstairs and turned the room into a lounge.  The new lounge just doesn't fit in with the Irish pub atmosphere - it's a bit odd in my opinion.  And I have a fond memory of making out with my date downstairs against that pool table one Friday night when we had the room to ourselves...  Now that I've got that off my chest, I like this bar.  I like that, on the Upper East Side where many of the bars are frequented by mostly fraternity boys and girls right out of college, Doc Watson's gets a very nice mixed crowd and in my 30s, I don't feel old like I do across the street at Brother Jimmy's.   The bar is crowded whenever I go there and the bar area is kind of narrow and not very conducive to standing with your drinks unless you are lucky enough to get a spot at the bar.  But it is a fun vibe and they have a good selection of beers on tap at reasonable prices.I've only eaten there once and shared appetizers - the steak tips and the buffalo wings.  Both were very good and I was happy that the steak tips came with six pretty large pieces.   I don't live on the Upper East Side but if I did, I'd probably frequent Doc Watsons more often.",1

That being said, the only good thing I can say about this place is that it has a cool name, at least in comparison to other bars on the Upper East Side.  I was seated near an outdoor patio, which was carpeted-okay, so I suppose there are two things about Doc Watson's that don't completely suck-and promptly waited 25 minutes to be served a glass of orange juice. That would be the highlight of their service, as I was to discover when they told me that they were out of waffles, because one of the other guests had ordered the last batch. However, the joke was on her, because we were later told that they didn't have any waffles for her either! After another fifty minutes or so-but who's keeping count-I was served a plate of delightfully soggy French toast and apple wedges. Yum! The wait-staff was incompetent, the food blew, and even the beer wasn't all it's cracked at to be. In short, don't go here unless you have some masochistic fetish involving execrable bars/restaurants.",1
164,,8/15/2012,0,,"Sebastopol, CA",Kirk M.,0,2.0,14,"I like pubs: Guinness on tap, simple food with casual and friendly service.  But Doc Watsons needs to scrape itself off the bottom of these minimum standards.  We ate outside, so cannot comment on the scene inside.  Our waitress was friendly but not attentive (the kind you have to wave down if you want anything).  I ordered the ""Fresh vegetables with penne pasta in vodka sauce"".  It was so bad I could not eat half of it.  I was hungry and will eat most anything put in front of me.  Vodka sauce is supposed to be smooth. That is its distinguishing feature.  No such luck for this reheated goop.  And not a single vegetable to be found.  Just sauce over pasta.  I asked if this was the right dish.  It was but the waitress agreed is was clearly lacking the ""fresh vegetables.""  With apologies, she brought out a side bowl of more of the bad sauce but with reheated frozen vegetables!  Seriously.  They were the frozen variety pack with Lima beans, diced carrots, corn, and green beans that are all tiny and of perfect uniform size.  I wish I could post a picture of it.  It was so pathetic is was funny.  Even the waitress was embarrassed but clearly not surprised.  And she had said this was one of their better dishes when I asked for a recommendation.  Too bad because the prices were reasonable.  Maybe the burgers are better, but beware, they do not have traditional yellow mustard.  I asked.",

The waitress was nice enough but a little slow. She was busy but I had to stare her down to order another drink and getting water was kind of tough too- although, it was pretty busy in there. in Prices were a little high but not ridiculous, and I enjoyed the two martinis I had. Overall an enjoyable spot for a springtime happy hour.",

168,,4/11/2010,87,,"Austin, TX",Matt F.,2,4.0,27,"I came across this place walking around the upper east side when a friend of mine visited. After filtering out the many pubs and fried food places we came across a very small patio that had one more four top just for us.They had a very reasonable pre-fixe which came with your choice of two adult beverages, I went with two bloody marys, which did the trick. The only weird part about the two drinks was that our waitress never asked us what we wanted, we had to pull her aside after we put our order in to get them, you think they would ask when you ordered the pre-fixe...oh well.I had a chicken salad which was huge and very very good. My buddy had the eggs Benedict, which we are very picky about, and he said that it was one of the best that he has ever had. So the food and drinks were great, at a very good price.I did not get a very good look inside the restaurant but it looked very dark, so if you can I would opt for the patio, which I mentioned above is very small. This is one great brunch place that I do plan on coming back to sometime, hope you all enjoy the food!",
169,,2/19/2010,132,,"Seattle, WA",Megan C.,14,3.0,283,"Going along with the Yelp phraseology associated with the chosen star rating, this place really is A-OK!! The bar gets backed... and loud... and whether at the bar or at a table, you will be pretty sure the conversation you are having is with all of those who are within one inch of ear shot (which is a lot of people). The food was surprisingly good. I always order apps at bars because I figure that is what gets ordered the most and will therefore be good. Held true here. My friend and I shared the buffalo wings and the steak bites. Both were very yummy and it was the perfect amount of food to keep us going during our long night of drinking. Overall, Doc's is not a place i would avoid, and not a place I will seek out. Somewhere right in the middle, which is A-OK!!",

176,1,6/21/2009,32,,"Richmond, VA",Lisa K.,20,3.0,134,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 9pm with a few friends. Tables are in the back, behind the bar and they were all full, but the waitress said we could sit downstairs and move upstairs when a table cleared out if we wanted. No one else was downstairs except the pool table and old-school videogame thing (think Ms. Pacman). There's a really nice patio off the downstairs room, but because of the rain no one was checking it out. So we settled in for our own little private party. (Music is good too; and being away from everyone we could actually hear it)I had a Doc Watson's burger (mushrooms, cheddar, bacon). It was pretty delicious. Nothing extraordinary, but a good, solid burger that'll fill you up. Lettuce and tomato looked really fresh too. The fries are the same kind of circular ones you get at JG Melon's except these were awesome. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Deelish. Food came fast, service was friendly. Our waitress had a little trouble splitting the check, but we never realized how busy it had gotten upstairs so I think she was pretty stressed. I was tempted to give them four stars, but when we had to leave our little enclave and head out through the upstairs it was yet another UES frat boy central, except small and thus super crowded. I think I would get annoyed quickly if I was actually here to drink.",1

They were long rectangles and kind of chewy. We had suitcases with us and they sat us smack dab in the middle of everyone. So people were tripping over our stuff. And the sprite was very sweet. Seemed too syrupy. The sliders were good. I liked the mix, 3 sliders, one ketchup, one cheese and one plain. As long as you like ketchup and cheese its nice they add those.",

Some of the guys had been there before plus I have a friend who lives in the area and it use to be a regular spot for him so I was pretty confident going in that the bar would be at the very least alright. Well... I'd say it was a bit more than alright. Entering I saw my group crowded around the bar and chatting up a storm. For bars the most important thing is service and bartender personalities, here both are great. For the early evening Mora was the lucky gal to serve us and later on Alan (who has a really sexy Irish accent and I would sit and order or inquire about anything to hear him talk, lol). Next important aspect of a bar is space, though limited here it wasn't that bad. It did get tight towards the later hours of the night but if we didn't have such a large group the place wouldn't have felt over crowded. The food was decent. We ordered all sorts of stuff ranging from different boneless wings, onion rings, potato skins, quesadillas (which were really good). Overall we had fun. The age ranges at my office are pretty spread out and everyone enjoyed themselves. Some of our guys managed to smooth there way into playing Janga with a group of gals at the bar too so other patrons seem pretty cool as well. If I were up here more often I'd definitely hit this bar up again. It had the rustic feel I like and again the bartenders were cool.",
