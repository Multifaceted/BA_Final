0,Nicole M.,"Manhattan, NY",18,6,0.0,5.0,11/16/2018,"Super easy and painless to book. I booked this at the very last minute (the day before I needed the cleaning to be exact), and Gina helped me through the process. Tracey was a joy. She was punctual, kind, thorough, detailed oriented and went above and beyond to make sure everything was sparkling with cleanliness. She moved everything around and cleaned in spots that most cleaners of other companies I've hired in the past completely overlooked. Not Tracey! She was a very skilled, respectful cleaner. I can't wait to use this company again next time I am in need of making sure my apartment is perfectly cleaned.",,,
1,J S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,5,5.0,11/17/2018,"We've used this company twice now, and have had Tamika scheduled both times. I'm reluctant to share that, because I still want to be able to book her, but Tamika and Gina (the company owner) are really awesome.Tamika has been very punctual, friendly, and does a phenomenal job. I'm a bit of a clean freak, and she has met if not exceeded my expectations. Each time she's been here, she works very hard, and leaves the place looking spotless! Gina is also very friendly, warm, and helpful. She explained everything to me, answered all of my questions, and booking has beeen a simple process. I'm very happy with their level of service, and will continue to use them!",,,
2,Lisa N.,"New Albany, OH",0,5,0,5.0,11/17/2018,"I ordered a deep cleaning for my twin daughters' East Village apartment from Obsessive Cleaning. I have done this in the past with another company, but Obsessive Cleaning was head and shoulders above the competition. From the easy on-line booking to reminders about our service date, they were very professional from the start. The cleaner came within 5 minutes of the agreed time, and I even received a message that she might be a few minutes late due to train delays. She was extremely polite and friendly, and did an outstanding job cleaning the apartment! The floors sparkled, the kitchen (including appliances) shined, the bathrooms were perfect and the apartment was no longer dusty. We will definitely use them again. It's nice to know they provided exactly what they advertised. A++++!!!!",,,
3,Chrissie G.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/17/2018,"We had our apartment cleaned for the first time with Obsessive Cleaning yesterday.  Gina was great to work with in setting up the appointment (even checking our apartment floorplan online to confirm we were aligned on expectations).  Isata was amazing - showed up early (in a snowstorm), super hard worker and took pride in the work.  We are glad to have found a reliable cleaning service that will now become our go-to!",,,
4,Melanie L.,"New York, NY",1,21,3,5.0,10/17/2018,"Wow. Just wow. After construction the dust and grime were everywhere. The three person team cleaned my kitchen to new. I had Stephanie come today and she did windows, walls and floors and the construction dust in the air is gone along with every speck of dust on surfaces. I'm amazed. I'm in love. I'm never going to be able to go back to ordinary cleaners again.Worth every cent!",,,
5,Mike h.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0,5.0,9/26/2018,"Between the easy website, app, and Gina's extremely quick responses - can't say enough good things about this company. Everything was extremely fluid. Elizabeth did a wonderful job cleaning my apartment, was here for almost 5 hours and left the place spotless. We did have one issue where an appliance was accidentally broken during the cleaning process - but Andre the CEO reached out to me directly and handled the situation with grace and covered the cost. This is absolutely a company you can trust to do the right thing, and it was by far one of the best customer service experiences I've had in a long time. Will definitely be using them again, and will be recommending to all of my friends.",,1,
6,Yuna L.,"Jersey City, NJ",31,2,0,5.0,10/6/2018,Gina is one of the most wonderful admins you can ever find. She responded to my questions very quick. And she managed to get COI when i asked in the last mints. She does know what to do when it comes to customer service. I booked a standard cleaning for a one bed room.  Plus i asked for cabinet cleaning. It took 3 hours and 30min. Isata cleaned all the parts that i asked her tonpay attention and she asked me if i need extra things that need to be cleaned after finished. She was great at her job and I'm very satisfied,,,
7,Chanah H.,"New York, NY",77,16,0,5.0,9/9/2018,"The absolute best! Very thorough, professional and helpful. I will definitely be hiring them again.",1,,
8,Gena G.,"New York, NY",233,4,0,5.0,9/26/2018,"Obsessive Cleaning completely lived up to its 5-star reputation! First off, they made it incredibly easy to schedule a cleaning via their online form, and were very transparent about what I'd be getting and how I'd be charged for it. They confirmed the visit with me via text, which was also very convenient. Elizabeth arrived right on time, was very friendly and easy to talk to, and above all did an incredibly thorough job of cleaning our cat-hair-infested 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment. I ordered the ""standard clean,"" but you'd think it had been a ""deep clean"" by how shiny and polished and neatly organized everything looks! Will definitely be hiring them more regularly going forward.",,,
9,M S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,4,5.0,5/3/2018,"Obsessive Cleaning did a great job. Tracey came on time and did a ""Deep Cleaning"". The extra money was worth it - the apartment was really spotless after. We also really liked how convenient it was to book an appointment. You can book on the app and then Gina follows up with a text.",3,,1
10,Alexandra S.,"New York, NY",2,15,0,5.0,9/5/2018,"Leilani does an incredible job every single time! Highly recommend Obsessive Cleaning - easy scheduling through the app, Gina and her team are always on time or in close communication, and results are excellent.",,,
11,Simon C.,"Evanston, IL",322,2,0,5.0,8/15/2018,"I regularly use obsessive cleaning to clean my apartment because they do the best job in New York. I highly recommend using Lani as your cleaner, as she is thorough, kind, and an extremely skilled cleaner. She goes above and beyond, and leaves my apartment spotless when she leaves.",1,,
12,Honest T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,5.0,8/6/2018,"Miguelina was absolutely fantastic! She showed up perfectly on time, was friendly and lovely and did a great job. Obsessive was clear and concise in their communication. Overall the experience was great!",1,,

Updated review","I booked Obsessive Cleaning's Services again this week after a great experience in March. Once again, the team was professional in the ease of booking, punctual arrival, and cleaning services. Thank you Gina for your quick response and scheduling accommodation. Tracy was fantastic again! She was right on time, was meticulous in her cleaning, and always has a lively persona. Looking forward to requesting your services again in the coming months! As mentioned in my last post, I've referred them to family/friends in Manhattan.",1,,
14,M. R.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,14,1,5.0,7/9/2018,"I chose this company because the Yelp reviews were really good and they were able to come last minute on a Sunday. But I was blown away by the customer service (immediate), which was only topped by the wonderful pro that came to do the job. Tamika was not only incredibly professional, personable, and kind - the place looked amazing. I have been using Handy for years and finally got fed up with people arriving late and doing an okay job (that I could have done myself). So great to have this resource in Washington Heights!",2,,
15,Krystal S.,"New York, NY",148,4,0,5.0,9/1/2018,"My partner and I are in the middle of a move and our broker recommended we look into booking a ""deep clean"" with Obsessive Cleaners to make things a little easier on us. I highly recommend Lani as your cleaner. She's personable, kind, trustworthy, and incredibly thorough. She went above and beyond to make the apartment shine like new. Will definitely book again.",,,
16,Kenneth G.,"New York, NY",1,29,0,5.0,6/12/2018,"Great.  Tamika showed up on time, was super friendly, brought all her supplies (even a vacuum!!!), and cleaned everything I asked her to in a way I'm simply not capable of doing no matter how much i spend on it.  She also followed my directions perfectly.  So many cleaning services spend time ""tidying up"" or moving things around instead of scrubbing and cleaning surfaces. That just means I can't find things and my apartment is still dirty.  I asked Tamika to focus on just scrubbing, which she did.  Every surface was spotless and my stuff was where I left it (which is what I asked for).  Planning on using them regularly.",1,,
17,Lauren B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",237,1,0,5.0,12/7/2017,"I had a great experience using this service. The customer service was excellent as they checked in to see what my exact needs were beforehand, made sure that the service was timely & checked in to see if the service was satisfactory afterward.The cleaning service itself was great. Tracy was very pleasant and timely - my apartment looked spotless after. I've had terrible experiences using other services who've cut corners to rush off to another client. I felt Tracy gave my apartment appropriate attention. Lastly, I have a dog so I was concerned to introduce new cleaning products into my apartment but they assured me that they've considered this and that their products are pet/eco friendly which is great!  Great experience all around. I will definitely use the service again. :)",3,,
18,Francesca F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,2,0,5.0,6/2/2018,"Having this company clean my home has been the BEST thing I've done for myself and my family in a long time.   I can't express how very relaxed I am after the hard work that Obsessive Cleaning put into my home.   By a long shot, this is some of the very best money I've ever spent.",2,,
19,Salma K.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",29,6,0,5.0,7/10/2018,"This is hands down the best cleaning service I've used in Nyc.  I have an insane schedule, and the manager confirms my cleaning in less than 24 hours, gave me an insane promo for first time cleaning, and replies to my messages within 15 minutes.  I mainly use Lani, because she organized my whole apartment without me asking while leaving the place shining.  There is truly not another service like this in the city...I've looked!",,,
20,A A.,"New York, NY",105,50,6,5.0,7/17/2018,Have only used once so far but really loved the woman they sent over! She was extremely thorough and personable. Gina the owner was also a pleasure to coordinate with. So far A+ service all around. I definitely plan to continue using them and would highly recommend! Do not hesitate!,,,
21,Neil B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/24/2018,Amazing service. I've never seen my apartment so clean. Chelly really did a great job and she's also really cool and personable. Definitely will hire Chelly and Obsessive Cleaning again. 10/10 would do again.,2,,
22,D C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/26/2018,"Hired obsessive cleaning to clean my apartment from top to bottom including many oversize windows, to prepare for an open house. I spoke with Gina in advance, worked out the details about what would be included along with the price, scheduled the appointments.  Three professionals came over, arrived on time, were very personable and professional. I pointed out a few things that I wanted to make sure they didn't miss.  They did a great job, were very thorough and the place looks spotless.  I highly recommend this service.",,,
23,Natasha K.,"New York, NY",13,43,15,5.0,1/3/2018,"I've used Obsessive Cleaning a few times and have been very, very pleased with the services offered by this NY-based cleaning service. I recommend them highly! I've had a few unreliable cleaners in the past, so this service was a breath of fresh air for me and my husband. The app is easy to use, and the customer service is excellent. So far, we've had Julie and Tracey clean our place. They both showed up with comprehensive cleaning kits (including a vacuum) so I didn't have to worry about buying any extra products or anything. They were both timely, efficient (about 2.5-3 hours to clean a one bedroom), and effective (knowledgeable about how to clean delicate surfaces like porous stone). Our place was spotless! The tongue-in-cheek name of the company rings true. We've booked an ""obsessive"" cleaning for next week, and I look forward to coming home to a pristine home. :)",,,
24,Amanda L.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,7/10/2018,"Just had Tracy come for the second time and I'm once again thrilled.  Gina again made scheduling a pleasant breeze from the start--both times I have been able to make last minute appointments which is wonderful.  As for the cleaning itself, Tracy was reliably enthusiastic, communicative, intuitive and thorough.  She works quickly, does an incredible job and is totally pleasant to be around.  So glad I found this company.",,,
25,Rebecca S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,5.0,4/9/2018,"I've used OC three times now, and they've been great. The first time, our floors looked clean but felt a little sticky to the touch--whatever the cleaner used, it left a residue. I mentioned this in my feedback, and Gina (who handles their communication) immediately wrote back to apologize and say that she would leave a note on our account so that the next cleaner could pay attention to that. Otherwise, our place was spotless.The second time, the cleaner used something to clean our toaster oven, which left a residue that burned and emitted a bad odor when we next used it. Again, I made note of this in the feedback, and one of the owners was immediately in touch to say they would make it right for me. They ended up replacing our toaster oven with a brand new one (which they hand-delivered) when their suggestions for removing the odor didn't work. The third time, Gina hand-picked one of their most tried-and-true cleaners for us, and she did a fantastic job. Obviously, this company is relatively new and still working out some kinks, but the communication was top-notch, and they really want to make it right for their customers.",1,,
26,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,9/6/2018,"Tracey and Stephanie arrived promptly, were thorough and pleasant - did a great job on very last minute!  Much appreciated their thorough, good work!",,,
27,Andrew P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,8/18/2018,I have now been using Obsessive cleaning pretty regularly and they are awesome.  The app is easy to use and Lani always seems to outdo herself.  I would highly recommend her as she always goes the extra mile to make sure my apartment is pristine by the time she leaves.,,,
28,Steve R.,"New York, NY",32,4,3,5.0,3/14/2018,"Turned a 2 bedroom, dusty, post-construction mess into a newborn-ready environment in just a few hours of hard work. Ingrid and Gina were a true pleasure to work with! I would hire them again in a second.",,,
29,Reesie R.,"Manhattan, NY",43,326,52,5.0,12/5/2017,"I have been very happy with the services I've received from Obsessive Cleaning. In a city overrun with cleaning services, it's hard to know where to go (even my trusted friends have a hard time with reliable cleaners). There is always a fear that the staff are underpaid and unhappy.  Moreover, I admit that I'm a picky customer which is why I'm that more impressed with the service I receive. Obsessive Cleaning is very professional - with great customer service before and after the cleaning. You receive email confirmation with the opportunity to tailor your service. My cleaner the past two times has been Winnie and she's wonderful!!  She arrives on time and doesn't rush the clean. She is meticulous and friendly.  She takes feedback well and remembers it in the future. I feel very comfortable leaving her alone in my apartment and with my cat. The service is bonded and insured, family-owned, and they use good products and treat their staff well. Overall, I have finally found a respectable and reliable service that I feel confident recommending to anyone. And...you have to love the name! Hope you enjoy coming home to a nice clean home!! I sure do!",,,
30,Dorothy H.,"Staten Island, NY",0,5,0,5.0,5/9/2018,"This was my first time using this company.  We needed a deep clean after an apartment renovation.  They did not disappoint.  From start to finish, they were first rate.  Extremely organized.  Gina is so friendly and helpful, even though I had so many questions.  She never made me feel like I was bothering her.  The website is super user-friendly and it's so easy to book an appointment online.  The two women who did the cleaning were wonderful.  They were so thorough and so friendly.  It was such a fun experience.  They left the apartment smelling beautifully too.  I highly recommend this company!  They are really great!",1,,
31,Eric D.,"Bulls Head, NY",0,1,0,5.0,12/7/2017,"The best cleaning service I've ever had!Everything is so easy to use, and convenient.Nina arrived here on time, she was so efficient and nice.We actually got the feeling that she cares.",,,
32,A F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,5/24/2018,"We recently started using Obsessive Cleaning services for a large office and home space and couldn't be happier with the group. They were extremely flexible and accommodating to our time sensitive needs and did a fantastic job even in spite of the short notice! All of the cleaners they sent were extremely friendly and were able to do their job despite having several people in the space while they worked. Gina, the manager of the group, was accessible throughout the entire process and made sure the work was up to our standards. With that being said, we have moved forward with signing up for regular cleaning service by the Obsessive Cleaning team. I would absolutely recommend to fellow family and friends!",,,
33,Spencer L.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,0,5.0,1/31/2018,"Found it about this service through a flyer in my mailbox. It's bonded and insured, and the online and text booking make it so easy to get started. We actually were disappointed with our first service, having paid extra for a deep cleaning but there was still dust on the floor and hair in tub. I complained to the company and they profusely apologized and scheduled another cleaning on the house. Since then I've been impressed and would highly recommend!",,,
