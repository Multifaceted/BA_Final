0,Lauren D.,"Bronxville, NY",24,107,306,5.0,11/9/2018,"Blake and Todd is my first choice for breakfast in the area.  The food from the made-to-order stations is always delicious and they are reasonably priced. The only downside is that the egg station always has a line, so it can take a while to get breakfast. They have several people working, though, so the line moves relatively quickly. Omelettes come with tasty home fries and toast, which is a great deal for the price. The bagels are fresh and chewy, like a bagel should be. And, they have a vegetable cream cheese that looks homemade - with pieces of fresh peppers.",,,
1,Shari C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,66,205,1.0,7/8/2018,"Mediocre food options combined with staff that look like they hate their jobs.This place is one of the many lunch spots that have your standard soup station, salads, buffet, sandwiches, pastas, etc.  I've tried the salads and the sandwiches here which weren't great, but not bad either.  Like other reviewers have echoed, the staff here is extremely rude.  I ordered one of their pre-made paninis and then waited awhile for my order to finish on the grill.  The guy who took my order then proceeds to yell at me ten minutes later because he realized he gave away the last sandwich, even after having to repeat my order twice.Yeah, no...I think I'll pass.",2,,
2,Larry G.,"North Hollywood, CA",122,92,40,3.0,6/22/2018,"It's solid and mostly reliable staples of mid-town lunchtime workday fare: soup station; salad station; sammies; hot dishes. Workday, commuter and on-the-go lunch? Blake and Todd are a reliable choice.I was immediately smitten by the loaded, flavorful and well-executed eggplant parmesan. It's hard to find a good one, esp 'non-Italian' and in Manhattan. And $7.95 for a really good portion of food. Friendly, highly efficient staff. Smart system to get the high-volume traffic cashed out and seated or on their way to their cubbies in the skies. My quick takes: Salad station is the standard and the price point makes it not worth it. Too high. Pizza is ok. Too many meat-based choices but I guess with so many alpha high-powered Park and Mad finance types it's a necessity. The Dude is just a simple Beta.Sammie station and other options TBD.Which brings me back to the eggplant parm option. Hard to come by. Limited quantity, so by the time I get there sold out. Unless it's a quiet Friday and when you pick one, the chef says 'That's chicken,' and you say 'OK, then the one you chose. Eggplant. No chicken.' Then, as you hungrily eat later and you think the cliche 'It tastes like chicken' before you realize it IS chicken you wonder where the cross-wires came from. Noisy joint. Co-workers chatting as they work. Maybe you said something that communicated you want chicken. I ate it with mindfulness for the animal and disappointment at the mix-up, whomever was responsible.I'll give them one more try. Then, maybe move on. Too many great choices if you're willing to scout and give up the brutal repetition of convenience. Although the roasted Brussels sprouts looked amazaballs.Blake and Todd deserve a visit by any meat and veggie lover. Not so sure a vegan would find the bare necessities.",,,

4,Kendal F.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",156,81,446,4.0,4/26/2017,"I love this place. I frequent the hot food buffet, where there's a good variety of items that change everyday. Anything from chicken Marsala meatballs to turkey schnitzel, roasted Brussels sprouts and even alfredo. On the other side they have the cold buffet which is usually your vegetables, like quinoa and asparagus and different salads. As someone stated before, though, one wrong turn and your meal can easily be close to $20 (weighed). But honestly, that's pretty much any buffet in NYC. I have not been to the other stations yet, but I have noticed that the cashiers seem to have a bit of an attitude every time I'm there. Oh well -- the food is tasty and always fresh. Can't complain and will definitely continue to eat there -- when I can afford it :)",1,,

Updated review","In all honesty i am never disappointed when I go to Blake & Todd for lunch.  I always hit the hot/cold bar and choose from the different selections.   There is Always some salad or warm dish that I find to be exceptional.  I'm always curious to see what they have next.   Today the hits were a quinoa and feta salad, a spinach & fennel salad w citrus vinaigrette, and a cold chicken sauté.  They Hit. The. Spot.  They always do.",,,

You can get basically anything to drink here: coffee, teas, juices, smoothies, and they also have bottles wine. For eating they have everything: hot and cold sandwiches, salads, brick oven pizzas (these are delicious!), make your own pasta, hamburgers, omelettes, breakfast foods, grilled chicken platters and my favorite is the hot and cold food buffet bar. I usually eat on the healthier side and the veggies at the buffet bar are perfect for this. The cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and sweet and regular potatoes are my favorite with grilled chicken. I recommend the pizza, the chicken parm at the buffet bar, the meatball sub, burgers and turkey burgers, and made-to-order foods. The delivery is always on time ( we often do delivery in the rain, snow or cold weather). Great spot for grabbing a quick bite to eat!",2,1,2

I decided to wait and when pizza did come out of the oven it was extremely burnt, the worker then took his bare hands with his dirty thumb in the crust and cut the slices. It was absolutely repulsive. He then threw the slices in a box and violently handed them to us. The customer service there is extremely horrible. We weren't the only ones in line who went through this. Numerous people said they would never come back. This will the the first and last time I ever visit this place.

Updated review","For the second time in two weeks, the cold chicken dish on the salad bar was undercooked.

23,Jasmine S.,"Oakland, CA",113,28,0,3.0,8/11/2015,"The sandwiches here are small and really unimpressive. If I want a salad or sandwich, I'll go to Essen or Europa. I come to Blake and Todd for the hot bar. It's hard to find healthy, well-thought-out, quick lunch items in this neighborhood. On any given day, they'll have a couple salmon dishes, a couple chicken dishes, maybe a turkey, and a lot of different roasted vegetable options. And caprese salad!The price per pound is something like 12$, which is steep, and I agree with the other reviewers that the staff and customer service leaves much to be desired, but I'll keep coming back as there just aren't enough options in Midtown East.",,,

I am not a big fan of the price either, but since it serves the Midtown East business community, it is reasonable and sensible.Now onto the customer experience part. From a customer's perspective, it is dreadful. The place is packed full of people and lines during lunch hours, which forces you into the mechanical flow of come in - spot the tail of the food line - grab food - spot the tail of the cashier line - pay - get out. From a business perspective, however, it is rather brilliant and impressive how many people they move through in a given minute and how high utilization the space is.

Otherwise, the food is great!When Blake and Todds first came into this area a couple of years back, I absolutely loved them. Aside from the great food, the employees were warm and friendly. Unfortunately, the level of professionalism has severely deteriorated since then. B&T is right downstairs from where I work, so it's safe to say that I frequent this establishment a lot and my go-to place for lunch (3-4 times per week).Recently (a few weeks now), I've noticed an influx of new employees, specifically the females who cash out at the front register. They are NOT friendly and have shown levels of frustration with customers, as I am one of those customers they have lashed out on.I've experienced this twice, both times with the same female employee, however, as she exuded her clear frustration with me, I overheard another customer telling another female-register employee ""But you don't have to be so rude about it.."" We exchanged a small conversation about this and both agreed that their service is less than appealing! Just for the record, the issue this said employee had with me, was that I realized I didn't have my debit card on me to pay for lunch. I told her that I worked right upstairs and I'll be RIGHT BACK. Before I could even finish my sentence, she huffed, puffed, sighed, rolled her eyes and then mumbled something under her breath with clear annoyance of me. The ONE time I forget my card, in the years I've been patronizing B&T and this is how they behave?This is a terrible reflection of management. Either these girls really need an attitude adjustment, or the level of (un)professionalism is trickling down from the higher ups to which they are showing to customers.I've been in this area for over 9 years, of which I'm use to a friendly staff from Essen (directly across the street), Dishes, Bistro and Toasties. Never have I seen attitude like that in other establishments like I have recently in Blake and Todds. If these females haven't noticed, they're in the front line of dealing with customers, hence some customers service would be great. If you can't deal with people, this shouldn't be a job for you.

Gourmet, quality ingredients and the kitchen staff would come out every few SECONDS to put out fresh versions of what was being served. That is no exaggeration! I highly recommend this place for lunch. If you order, order from their website! blaketodd.com (way more efficient)",,,

For breakfast it is very limited and sometimes the sausage is a little cold. But for lunch the food selection is fresh and unique. There are different types of hot food everyday. A little bit pricey, but you are paying for quality.",,,
52,Penelope C.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",1,57,0,1.0,3/27/2014,"I've been coming to Blake & Todd for months now, just about five times a week for lunch. I can agree with other reviewers that the food is pretty good, with lots of choices in a clean environment. However and unfortunately, I ate there for lunch yesterday and came down with some severe food poisoning. I'd really like to go back but it was just too painful and I don't want to take another chance.",,,
53,Vicky L.,"Manhattan, NY",283,28,1,1.0,9/3/2014,"I came into the store this morning to get breakfast from the a la carte bar and when I ate the egg whites, they had a bitter chemical aftertaste. I was worried the eggs were tainted with something or were bad eggs, so I called the store and asked to speak to the manager to tell her my concern about their eggs and her first response was ""Oh you came into the store?"" (which is a strange question to ask in my opinion) and I said ""Yes I was physically in your store 5 minutes ago to pick up breakfast"". Then her response was that they would take a look at the eggs and give me a free breakfast the next time I came in. I have my doubts that they even did anything to fix the eggs because the manager did not seem concerned at all. I would not return here ever again because the food is super expensive and the quality of food and customer service are obviously sub-par. I would recommend going somewhere else with better quality and customer service such as right across the street to Essen or down the block to Dishes.",4,,1
54,Jacob N.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,3,0,5.0,3/7/2014,"The food here is really top-notch. The salad bar has lots of interesting hot and cold food options (think curried cauliflower with pine nuts, chicken friccasee, fresh salmon with lemon and dill). And the salad and sandwich options are really plentiful, with tons of customizable options. Definitely worth a visit!",,,
55,Greg G.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/6/2015,"Egg line is the slowest and most unorganized its ever been.  Seems like whenever the cooks start to figure it our, the manager fires them.",,,
56,Clo D.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1,29,4,2.0,8/8/2014,"Food is great.  However, I prefer the self serve so as to avoid the rude employees.  It does not matter which station I order from I always get rude, inattentive service.  if they get your order wrong it is your problem not theirs, no matter that they never repeat anything back to you.  Health department should also pay them a visit - raw egg in the morning, drops on the counter, dirty rag wipes it up someones toast goes rright on the counter - YUCK!  I have decided I will no longer patronize establishments that do no care about customer service and cleanliness.  Come on, it's mid-town - way too many choices to have to put up with your ""short order cooks""  By the way there is a little deli, right around the corner on 54th street, Reliable is the name, where the guys are friendly and the food is pretty decent and wayyyy cheaper! Good by B&T!  Hope you are listening.....  Props to the cashiers - they are super nice!",1,,
57,Daniel M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,2,0,2.0,3/16/2015,"The place is clean and food is decent, but the portions are small and everything is quite pricy.  Also they moved their Restuarant grade sign ever since they got Grade Pending, as if people wouldn't notice it...shady.",,,
58,Pia S.,"New York, NY",1040,681,48,4.0,7/11/2013,"Gourmet spot with a hot food bar as well as sandwiches, salads, etc. It gets pretty busy during lunchtime but the lines move fast. There is also a convenient sitting area that surprisingly has seats open during peak lunchtime.",1,,
