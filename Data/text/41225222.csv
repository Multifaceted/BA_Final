0,Michael Z.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",233,531,406,4.0,12/8/2016,Dishes is the perfect spot for when you have no idea what you want. I came in on the suggestion of a coworker and I'm glad I did. I'm a big fan of cafeteria/buffet style places for lunch and knew I'd need a place to replace Bocca. The selection was much smaller than Bocca but it was good and the food was flavorful.Looks like I've found my spot!,1,1,1
1,Jeff U.,"Westport, CT",0,28,4,1.0,11/14/2018,Employees couldn't be more rude or clueless. Food is ok but doesn't change up much. Customers are also rude cutting in and out of Buffett line. If you can avoid I would.  Doesn't seem to be any Mangement in charge.,,,
2,Nicola G.,"New York, NY",18,14,0,3.0,11/14/2018,I normally love this place but as of lately (the last 6 months or so) their chicken it tough and chewy. I cannot stand chewy chicken.,,,

They had pretty generic salad bar. Everything's on the ok side. Good for work lunch. Quick and easy.I'd say I'll rate them 4 if they are called Bowls because they have great soups!",,,
4,Mike S.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",359,572,149,3.0,11/10/2017,"The problem isn't that the food isn't good, because it is quite tasty. My issue is one pound of food is $13. I got exactly one pound of nice chicken and salads but I was still totally hungry. To be full I would need $20 worth of food, and for that price I could think of tons of better, more relaxing scenarios for lunch. Also, other per pound places offer lots more variety. I would warn after 12 it is line city. Welcome to corporate ""quick"" lunch.",3,3,4
5,Cara B.,"New York, NY",255,382,932,4.0,6/14/2016,"Catered an office lunch meeting from here and everything went smoothly. I chose to do the lunch prefix two which came with assorted wraps and sandwiches, the cold pasta salad of the day, a large salad, and a large fruit platter. I was able to chose the variety of sandwiches and wraps which I liked. I also was able to chose the salad as well. I went with the Caesar salad which was delicious! I ordered the day before and was able to pay over the phone. The food came a few minutes late, but I'm in NYC and things happen. I was pleased with the quality of the food and the presentation. They also supplied dishes, napkins, and cutlery. I would definitely order for another lunch meeting from Dishes again!",1,,
6,Mili G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,1.0,11/16/2017,"Went today at 11:30, half the buffet items were still from breakfast and the sandwich counter was closed because of a catering order. Was informed very rudely that they didn't know when it would be open, maybe 20 minutes, maybe not. Every lunch place in midtown does catering and is still able to handle regular customers. It's pretty ridiculous that when you go to Dishes you just have to gamble on whether you can actually get your food or if various parts will be closed due to catering orders. Guess I'll be taking Dishes out of my regular lunch rotation. I don't have the time to walk over there just to be rudely and unprofessionally berated by the employees and not get any food to boot.",1,,
7,Debbie B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,50,54,4.0,2/6/2018,"I like their foods, especially the pre-made caesar and  Chinese chicken salads, but some of them are expensive. An additional container of salad dressing is $2 - outrageous.",,,
8,Raquel M.,"Massapequa, NY",225,1,1,5.0,7/25/2017,Great lunch spot! Was walking to another place and instantly stopped once I smelled the food walking by.

9,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",412,1514,173,4.0,8/25/2016,"Delicious....And Fresh!You can always count on Dishes to fill your tummy with yummy nutritious food. The buffet area changes frequently but there are always a few staples that remain everyday. There is also a salad station if you're looking to up your vegetable intake. Are they pricey? Yes, a bit. But look at where you are and look at their address, it's to be expected. Pretty much everything here is worth the price. While there is seating, this is more of a grab and go kind of spot. The BEST time to go? Exactly at noon, if not earlier. I once tried to get in at 12:15 and the line was out the door. That speaks volumes about their food and their service.",,,
10,Bill C.,"Queens, NY",0,35,0,2.0,1/5/2018,"The food is OK, but very overpriced relative to quality.  The place lacks consistency of service -- sometimes breakfast is put out at 7am, sometimes at 7.15 they are only starting to bring out the dishes.  At lunch time the sandwich team completely ignores you if they are busy instead of saying ''Sorry, please give us a few minutes'.  Cashiers range from average to rude.  One actually wears a tag with a name Godsfavor.  I go there only if I am in extreme hurry.  Otherwise, I avoid this place as much as I can.",1,,
11,F. V.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/26/2018,"This is for the price confusion and customer service, not the food. I ordered a ham egg and cheese for breakfast from their noodle bar at the back, it cost me $8!!! On the menu, they have ""egg and bacon"", which is $5.95. I looked at that and asked if they can make it with ham, and the guy worked there told me yes, and also asked me to pick the bread I want. I told him, just whatever comes with it, since I don't care about the bread. He asked me again: "" you pick from here and let me know"". So I picked crossiant. When I was ready to pay, he told me it will be $8. I asked why, because on the menu it says $5.95. He told me, because this is a special..... not what showed on the menu!!! How ridiculous!! $8 for ham egg and cheese!!! I didn't add anything to the sandwich, just simply asked for a substitution - I didn't even want to customize the bread, he asked me to and then told me I would be charged 30% more than the price on the menu because it is a special !!!!!  He didn't even mention if I  change any thing from the menu, I would need to pay more !!! This is one of my regular lunch spots, because the food is tasty and the location is convenient, i think at least they should make it clear about their price, and being transparent about extra cost! I told the lady working at the cashier, and she said she thought I added something to the sandiwich that why it cost more, but I told her no. she said she could completely understand my point. $2 more is okay, but it is just not the right way to do business, that's the review is about!",,,
12,Ariana K.,"New York, NY",435,101,165,2.0,6/7/2016,"My office has ordered catering from here a few times and I've always liked their sandwich.  My coworkers decided we should finally try going to this place and I must say i regret it.  The actual sandwich I got was fine (Grilled Chicken Sandwich), however the actual space has put me off from coming back here again.  The space was so tiny compared to other lunch places in the area and was extremely packed.  Just to get to the hot food, the line was literally out the door and line to pay wrapped around the entire place.  For the food and the price, I suggest just going over a block to Lexington or 3rd Ave and getting your food there to avoid the headache you'll get from this place.",1,1,

14,Jessica M.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,22,0,2.0,7/14/2016,"Overpriced. They exist purely for convenience of offices on Park Ave, as there is not much else on Park.

Asked for another sandwich. They don't have it. Went back today. Asked for a sandwich. They don't have it.Why are these items on my menu if you don't have it?

15,Katherine P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,1.0,7/18/2017,"I used to order for catering at the 45th Street location. So i figured I would try to order at this location for a client breakfast delivery. The person who took my call was very nasty, had no telephone manners whatsoever, she asked for my name, and the telephone number of the client and I mentioned the name of the client casually prior to giving her the phone number and she has the nerve to tell me "" I'm asking for the information as it is in the computer"" Hahahaha! So angry! That comment is unnecessary- you are NOT talking to a co-worker you are talking to a paying customer willing to shell out $200 to $300 dollars for overrated and overpriced breakfast food. I gave her the address and she asked for the floor number which I did not have in front of me and I asked her if I can place the order first and provide the floor number before confirming the order with payment, and she was grunting, sighing. So I decided to not place an order at all and take my business somewhere else. REMBER THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!!",2,,1
16,Sami F.,"Manhattan, NY",505,179,281,4.0,9/14/2015,"Dishes is one of the best healthier eating options in the area for lunch, but it is pretty expensive so it's not an everyday thing if you are looking to save. I definitely recommend going before the peak lunch rush because lines here get crazy long. While the lines often stretch out the door, the middle hot bar line moves pretty quickly and there's a ton of great food to get there. The menu is available online in the morning, so you can check beforehand if the hot bar is something that you want or if you would prefer something else that day. I personally love their caramelized sweet potatoes and would go just for those. Their other fresh vegetable options are delicious as well. I have also tried their salad bar, and their asian dressing and seared tuna make for one delicious salad.Also in the morning they make a yogurt parfait with strawberries that I am almost positive is made with goats milk and like whatever you should get it because it tastes like you are eating whipped cream and strawberries and it is fantastic.",,,

Updated review","I'll admit - my opinion of Dishes has improved quite a bit since my last review so time for an update! I'm not sure what happened, but this place has stepped up its game. The food I've gotten the last few times I've been were actually fairly tasty. Take today, for example:- Moroccan braised salmon with poblano and red peppers - was the salmon dry as hell? Yes. Does it taste anything remotely like Moroccan food? Not really. But at the end of the day, the salmon was quite flavorful and seasoned well and honestly, that's all you can hope for in this desert of good food options that is Midtown East.- Honey balsamic Brussels sprouts - this would be soooo delicious if it weren't for the fact that half of the Brussels sprouts were burnt to a crisp and tasted like charcoal. Putting that aside though, the half that wasn't burnt was really tasty and struck a great balance of sweet and sour. Yes, it'll still cost you about $12/lb at the buffet bar, which I still feel is atrocious, but because of the improved quality of food, I think Dishes deserves one more star.",,,
18,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,1.0,1/7/2015,"I think I have to boycott this place.  I swear I dont want to, but I think I have to.  I have been here twice this week, my wallet hates me, my blood pressure hates me, my stomach now hates me and I have decided, if I go one more time, I will hate me.  Its just that bad.   Pros: Food is slightly better than most delis in the neighborhood.  That making it the tallest midget (no offense to any midgets reading this).  If you're tall for a midget, you're still...you know, a midget.Cons:  The layout of this place is the worst. What the hell are these tables for? Seriously? Who is eating there?  Why or why are you wasting valuable space on these tables? Walking through this place is like walking in the third ring of hell.  No flow. No organization. Being going every which way. Horrible. Figure out how to get streamline people before something happens.  On this day a woman proclaimed, ""This is a fire hazard"" and you know what? it is!The sandwich line.  Wait here, order, go pay, come back and wait?  All of this while 2 of the 4 guys behind the counter are preparing catering orders?  Why? start those orders before lunch, or make those in the back, like every other place in midtown. The food bar.  There are signs on the top of the bar saying, ""we encourage you to jump in and out"" so why do people line up to the door and stand there when they know they want 1 or 2 things? Because this place is organized so poorly, thats why.The prices. Good golly ms molly this place is expensive as all get out. Bring your wallet, know it will be expensive and still ask the guy if you broke a window when he asks you for $14 for a sandwich.  The staff. The staff appear to be overworked and sluggish. Very few smiles. Very little urgency to do anything quickly. I dont blame them. This place is hell in midtown.I wont be going back. But there will be a thousand people there already so they wont miss me.",8,4,
19,Kay A.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,47,2,3.0,4/26/2017,Pricey but good. Food is usually fresh although they run out of food often in the morning. The staff is great! Very hard working and helpful.,,,
20,George K.,"San Francisco, CA",607,260,1,4.0,3/29/2016,"Pros: The food here is delicious. Much better than treehaus (another nearby gourmet buffet-style lunch place). You get what you pay for and even a BBQ chicken thigh here tastes amazing compared to the same thing elsewhere. The sauce was very tasty and chicken was very hot and fresh. Sides were good as well.Cons: It costs as much, if not more, as any of the many sit-down restaurant on 53rd between 2nd & 3rd. The lines are too long at dishes. They need more selection and appear to run out of things quickly. Once chicken and one fish option is not enough meat options. The buffet bar is small and causes a line to bottleneck there. These are obvious, visible problems that should be fixed asap.",1,,

23,Larry N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,5/26/2017,Good food but wonder if they are having financial issues.  Just went in to order a sandwich at 1 on a Friday and they were out of all bread except focaccia.  Strange for place with huge sandwich business to run out of bread.,2,,
24,Laura P.,"Stallings, NC",468,65,65,3.0,4/6/2016,"Quick and easy place to get to for breakfast if you work around the area! There are a few seats along the side of the store that you can use to sit and eat. I got the bacon and egg sandwich on brioche, which was pretty good and reasonably priced. Only reason I'm giving a 3 star review versus 4 is that in both mine and my friend's sandwiches, there were pieces of sharp plastic inside. We let the cook know about this and they offered to make us another one, but it was just still not something I would want to find in my food.",,,

The buffet by the pound had OK selection and it tasted just slightly better than other places that offer the same concept. However, you can easily pay close to $20 or more for a quick everyday lunch for the same amount of food you can get for $10-$13 in other nearby hot food buffet stations. No thanks, won't be coming again. There are way too many other better food options in the area for a more modest price.",,,

(Or at least king of midtown lunch.)Imagine the world is yours, with endless carbohydrates...Rice! Pasta! Potatoes! More Pasta! There's some salads and healthy crap, but really who's looking--there's a steaming helping of the tasty brown stuff just beyond that. I've had the privilege of depleting my paycheck for just about everything Dishes has to offer, be it at the bar, or behind the counters. Here's what I find memorable during the lunch hour: -- Banana Pudding-- Coconut Chicken Fingers-- Rice Pilaf-- Mozzarella and Tomato-- Caesar Salad -- Salmon Avocado Rolls-- Sesame Noodles-- Potato Latkes-- ANY Italian Pasta Salad -- Mac and Cheese-- Fried Chicken-- Chicken Noodle Soup-- Veggie Medleys -- Braised Short Ribs-- Mashed Potatoes Sushi and Soul Food Friday's is a nice way to get a little fresh fish fix if you aren't in the mood for an authentic Japanese experience, and are really just looking for a bang for your buck. Don't come expecting much, just coming hungry.Additionally I like to stop by Dishes when I'm in the mood for treating myself to a filling breakfast. I'm a fan of the following:-- Peanut Butter Smoothie-- Ham, Egg, and Cheese Cup-- Scrambled Eggs -- Egg Whites and Roasted Tomatoes-- Breakfast Potatoes-- French Toast Overall, the prices are astronomical at Dishes and the crowds are insanely obnoxious, but you are guaranteed a fresh and delicious meal at just about any time between 9 and 5PM.

Dishes is the millennial version of the upscale New York Korean deli.  Decor is all in white, and super trendy.  Lines are horrific and you will struggle to get out for less than $15. So why is Dishes 5 stars?  Because it's delicious. Lately, I've been meeting a friend for lunch. Table service for $15 is impossible at lunch, but if you show at 1145, a table isn't a problem and the snaking line is minimal.  There isn't a bad meal here, but I like the choose your own ingredients salads.  The market salad is also delicious, but usually my eyes get bigger than my wallet likes to pay.  Udon noodles are also tasty.  A relative weak point could be desserts, but I'm not a lunch and cookie type girl.",2,,1

37,Jordan D.,"Providence, RI",315,702,90,3.0,7/24/2013,"I feel like Dishes has a high school cafeteria atmosphere; tons of people on line, waiting to get food, same people/groups always come for lunch, a place to people watch and to be seen, people getting snobby for no reason, people all cramped, exchanging dirty looks, etc.High school atmosphere aside, I'm completely meh about Dishes. While the lines look ridiculously long during lunch hours, it moves fairly quickly. The food is pretty good quality too, their sushi is solid and I always have to grab a few of those coconut chicken fingers. Just prepare for a price shock when they weigh your plate; even if you take it easy on loading up, you can easily drop $15, drinks not included. I'll stick to my other go-to's in the area  for lunch and come in here every so often for a treat.",2,,

There is a tendency in the kitchen to throw random fruits in otherwise perfectly good sides and salads.. or fancy it up by throwing a handful of cilantro in it, which effectively ruins the dish and anything it touches for me.It's pretty pricey, too.Lastly, go there after 12:00 and the place is insane!

Updated review","Before I begin my update...ATTENTION, ATTENTION: If you are not waiting in line for the buffet you can walk past them on the left side. Also there is a sign inside that says you don't have to wait in line for the buffet. Dishes expressly recommends that you just walk in and go to what you want and grab it.Since my first review, I've sampled a few more items on the Dishes delicious menu, so I thought I'd fill everyone in. No surprise but everything I've tried is very good (although not incredible). I've sampled both a Tom Kha and Tom Yum soup. The Tom Yum was really good although it tasted more like a slightly spicy vegetable soup to me. In the past, I've found Tom Yum to have a very particular taste and super spicy. In fact, I like the Dishes version better (but they should maybe call it something else). The Tom Kha was great, no complaints on that one. I have also had the Portobello Mushroom And Smoked Mozzarella sandwich (grilled onions, balsamic dressing, toasted ciabatta), on strong recommendation from a friend. It was ok, but just slightly above average. The ingredients were fresh, but the sandwich was a bit bland. Portobello and mozzarella aren't the most flavorful combo in my opinion. The grilled onions had crunch but not much flavor. When I was able to get the bites with the balsamic I enjoyed the sandwich much more. I'm also thinking that ciabatta bread is too tough to chew for me to enjoy. With every bite I was afraid I would carve up the roof of my mouth. Vote NO on No. 3, but YES on Dishes!",1,,

Until then I will be eating their organic, delicious buffet offerings (the sauteed broccoli, five spice tofu, beet salad, egg salad and ancho salmon are my favorites) and praying that I've piled on less than $12 of food, as I walk to the register.

I spent $13 on lunch the other day, I almost always wince when I reach the register. For the most part the staff is very friendly, every time I go there, there's this friendly guy who always helps me find a seat. And when I'm done eating, he always cleans up my table, he's a total sweetheart! The only time I receive mediocre service was when I ordered soup from the asian section, I asked the girl for a tasting and she didn't even smile or acknowledge me properly. I didn't take offense because I figured she hated her job. Still, there's something a bit off about that side of the restaurant. I also enjoy their smoothies and almost always look forward to trying their new buffet options. I only wish they offered more variety, they usually have two to three meat options and  lots of veggies.

The quality of the food here definitely puts Dishes in the top percentiles of delis. The ordering system is also commendable. You order your food, then pay for it, then pick it up. Sure, you can do this in other delis, but at Dishes this is the rule rather than the exception. This keeps Dishes from being the utter madhouse it could be during work weeks.Now, downsides: the menu is pricey. $10-12 for a sandwich, or 50 dumplings in Chinatown currency. And, somehow, Dishes has managed to be a pretentious deli. It's partly the crowd, a midtown selection of finance /  fashion / white collar stereotypes. It's also the food selection (no burgers), the strikingly bright interior (aspiring to a cleanliness that normal delis would cringe from), and that stylish back seating area.

People are pouring out the door, bright orange to-go 'dishes' bag in hand, while crowds circulate the interior buffet and accompanying soup-salad-sandwich bars.Overwhelming is an understatement. So I finally pushed my way into the cafe, freaked out, and headed to the most familiar area I could distinguish. The salad bar, with its checkerboard selection of vegetables and proteins, seemed like the safest (and quickest) choice. And it was, but eating an $11 salad here (or anywhere really) is embarrassing. The salad was quickly chopped and tossed together before I could finish my order. I'm not even sure what I ordered. They might as well have given me someone else's salad. So I take the salad and try to discern where the checkout line is. After wandering aimlessly through the large people maze I figured out where to stand. Happy with my choice, as the buffet looked too good and too intimidating for a quick lunch trip, I waited and avoided looking at the $3 bottles of water to my right. So $11 dollars and about 20 minutes later (you have to wait for a table) I sat down at a small date table amongst the 20 other packed date tables with my friend. We talked over others' banter and wolfed down the tasteless greens. I can definitely spend $11 and 20 minutes better somewhere else but if you want a lunchtime ""rush"", dishes is your fix.

I am actually the kind of person who does not appreciate food / plates prepared by someone else, so selecting from a buffet gives you the sense that you are the cooker yourself.Selection of dishes here is good, though they do not change that often although they put new items every day, sometimes it gets little bit repetitious especially when you have made it a regular activity to frequent this place. Their coconut chicken is good, though the sauces they serve with might be best to avoid, since they are loaded on calories most probably. Their fried sweet potatoes are nice, they offer a different kind of tofu quasi-every day, when it comes to fish, not so much ( i personally do not understand what the wondrous deal about sushi friday is, because it was actually the worst sushi that i ever have eaten in my whole life, try something authentic and japanese please. ), although smoked salmon and tilapia cooked in vegetable sauce are good options if you enjoy seafood.They actually had a pretty decent hot chicken penne bolognaise, and i am a very picky person when it comes to pasta / italian dishes. The chicken they used was tasty and the sauce was not greasy as most places today seem to be making. If you are a vegetarian / vegan, it is great because they offer different kinds of salads and veggie dishes every day. That's very nice for someone who enjoys a good selection of various healthy delicious food.The downside is, the place is not open saturdays / sundays and the buffet does not begin till midday sharp and only for 1-2 hours stays the same quality. The place opens early in the morning so to pick up some breakfast you can just have a salad or a sandwich but the gist of the place is the pay-per-pound buffet, don't forget.There is no line here! So do not even think about forming one if you do go there, some asshole guy was really rude to me one day because i was supposedly cutting in but he should really learn how to read. Don't be that guy.Prices are ok. Though each and every time i pick lunch here, even if i think i should lose weight and eat less i end up paying at least 20 bucks, no beverages, no taxes included, so it is easy to lose control and get greedy.Park avenue restaurant is bigger than the one on the 45th street, but also more crowded. The food is pretty much the same. Though on Park they replace items more frequently so it is always fresh, and there is not any much time for any of the dishes get stale and insipid because people are raving MAD about this place. Avoid fridays if you don't like sushi and if there is not anything of particular interest that day. ( check the menu online before you go, around 11am they upload the daily menu. )I could have given 5 stars, but let's spare that one for a really exceptional place shall we?",1,,

Nothing was too salty. The only reason I had to give this place 3 stars was because of the price.

112,Cara L.,"Charleston, SC",19,80,0,3.0,3/10/2010,"Dishes during peak lunch time hours is not for the faint of heart.  This is an experience for only the most seasoned of New Yorkers who know exactly what they want, navigate life with measured, precise movements, and get out of the way.  If you are ""that guy"" who strolls leisurely around a buffet table contemplating what you might like to eat for lunch today or ""that girl"" who drags along a Louis Vuitton bag that is large enough to house your shoe collection and holds up entire lines while you dig through assorted pairs of Jimmy Choos in order to pull the credit card out of your Tory Burch wallet, please continue standing in the left lanes of escalators on your way to making abrupt stops in the middle of Times Square, and stay out of Dishes.If you are a competent, highly functioning individual who is looking to grab some better than average lunch options and be on your way, give Dishes a try.  Be prepared for high prices, mass crowds, some dirty looks, and know that when in doubt, you are expected to keep moving.  If you can handle this, there are plenty of gourmet delicacies to choose from along the buffet, although many of these vary from day to day.  The coconut chicken fingers and dipping sauces always seem to be a hit, along with an eclectic assortment of surprisingly good salads.  If you have limited time, or even less tolerance for lines or slow people, head straight to the salad, soup, or sandwich stations. The pecan chicken and gruyere sandwich on a sesame jerusalem bagel is my particular favorite.Don't plan on a finding a seat inside to relax with your friend while you catch up over coffee.  If you are looking to pick up dinner and lucky enough to stop in right at 5 p.m. when there may or may not be some items still out before they lock up for the day - you can avoid all crowds and serenely pick up a meal to go - just in time to brave the mass rush to the number 6 train.",,7,1

My favorite item from here is probably the Asian Noodle Soups. It's a bit of a nightmare at lunch time, but that's what you get in midtown.However, my experience with the delivery from here is AWFUL!  I used to order from here all the time when I worked on Lex and 57th.  It's been several years since I've worked in that area and now I remember why I stopped ordering breakfast from them. The food is always cold when it gets to you and more importantly, they have TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! The people who deal with delivery and catering orders over the phone are RUDE, period! Today, I placed an order on their online page. I signed up for a profile so that I could place my order, went through the process of picking out what I wanted, and then tried to check out, but there was no option to check out. So I had to go back through the process of signing up for an account and then picking out my food items, AGAIN. Super annoying, so they obviously have some web kinks to work out. To that end, they doubled my coffee order somehow. Not sure how it happened because I hit check-out and there was only one coffee order showing, but on my confirmation page there were two. I called the number on their webpage, which as it turns out is the 45th street location, NOT the 54th street location where I was ordering from. Then, that location gave me the wrong phone number so when I called it just rang and rang. I looked it up on Google and called the right number, at which point, the woman I spoke with told me that it was too late to take the coffee off my order because I did it ""online"". What? What kind of garbage is that? I asked her how was that possible and she told me if I had already received it there was nothing they could do, which is clearly an indication that she wasn't trying to figure out what went wrong with my order. I told her that I had just placed the order 2 minutes ago and that I hadn't received anything yet, not even an email confirmation for my order. To which she responded by setting the phone down and talking loudly to someone in the room with her about annoying customers. She got back on the phone and said they'd take it off the order and before I had a chance to confirm with her that they would be removing the charge from my credit card, she hung up. Got my food, my egg white wrap wasn't even warm and was smaller than the size of my iPhone 4. I don't need a giant egg wrap, but seriously, this thing was tiny. The House Latte I ordered was supposed to have caramel syrup in it, couldn't taste even a hint of that.While I will still come here for lunch, I will NEVER order from here online or over the phone again.",,,

There's a big line at the front where you wait to go around the market table (hot & cold salad bar).  there's also a salad tossed to order station, asian noodle soup to order and hot/cold sandwich area. I went with the market table because it was a good way to taste a lot of dishes.First up was a delicious looking tortellini gratin with cheese and sundried tomato.  Looked amazing, gooey goodness to come, right? Wrong! The taste is off. yuck. I ate 2 tortellini and that was all.  Next coconut rice a Thai staple for me.  This had actual bits of shredded coconut which for most is probably a good thing, but while I love coconut flavor I hate the texture.  Next broccoli with garlic - was good.Then from the cold side of the table...gemelli with calamata olives & fresh mozzarella had a way too strong olive taste for them to just be an ingredient, there must have been a big olive base to the red sauce.  Albacore tuna salad which to the eye had carrot, scallion, red onion, and herbs.  Unfortunately the herb was parsley which just overwhelmed everything else and ruined the tuna for me.  And lastly was cold noodles with peanut sauce.  The noodles were a not very authentic vermicelli but the flavor was good and itw as served with some slivered carrots.The table is $4.95/half pound, so it's pricey. Lunch cost me almost $11 and a lot is going in the trash.",,,
140,Jason R.,"New York, NY",49,261,13,4.0,8/22/2010,Dishes has become my new lunch time obsession. After taking a year off from going to dishes I recently started to frequent Dishes again. My go to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. Its perfectly made. A good amount of ham with a perfect balance of brie and honey mustard. Another great sandwich is the Turkey and Goat Cheese. Once again a perfect balance of turkey and goat cheese. The only down part about this place is that it gets kind of chaotic around lunch time. I try to avoid the peak hours from 12-2.,,,
141,Sno N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,78,30,5.0,4/3/2013,"I love this lunch spot.  It is less crowded than the 44th street location.  There are many fresh and healthy choices to eat.  I love the Matzoh Ball Soup, Coconut Chicken, Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls, Salads, Fresh Squeezed Juices and Flourless Oatmeal & Double Choc Cookies as well.  You can't go wrong eating here.",,,
142,Christina V.,"Metuchen, NJ",1,8,0,4.0,10/12/2012,"So obsessed with the soups here. There's is always that extra layer of flavor in their soups that's is somewhat addicting....crack, butter, whatever it is!..so good. Anyway, wished this place was closer to my work but well worth the walk. I always gravitate towards the roasted sweet potatoes and coconut crusted chicken when I'm in the mood for something more substantial.",,,
143,Samantha S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,9/4/2012,I just spent $20 on a salad and it made me sick.  Save yourself money and don't lose any of the flavor by going to Silo.,,,
144,Kimmie S.,"New York, NY",86,177,0,5.0,5/12/2009,"I have heard of Dishes and have seen a number of people eating there; however, today, I made my way there with my friend. Initially, my friend commented that the line was quite long but I have to say that it moved really fast whether you were waiting for the buffet or waiting to pay. Typically, I don't eat from a buffet - I tend to find them dirty and to look a bit old; however, this was not the case here! I loved the marinated tofu, the coconut shrimp, lentils and rice, etc. Everything looked very appetizing and it was organized. Fortunately we were able to snag a seat (although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger). I think that the food was definitely worth it and after spending about $12 (the same I spend at Chopt), I realized there was so much variety here!",1,,
145,Katherine B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,33,0,2.0,2/22/2012,"Pretty serious shit-show. The only reason I go here once a month is for the delicious, incredible, noodle soups available at the very back on the left (maybe called the Asian Soup Bar?). The Coconut Chicken and Beef Pho are both outstanding. Everything else is good but I cannot hang with the lines, the $12/lb buffet, or the clientele. Obviously prime location allows them to survive with minimal service. My advice, get in and get out- oh and go late or early to avoid the rush.",,,
146,B P.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,4,1,1.0,7/27/2010,"Could not be more expensive/overpriced.The food quality is terrible at best and mostly inedible.My coworkers and I ordered delivery one time and the food arrived 45 minutes after the estimated time. When we called to mention the delay we were offered nothing by the manager, not even an apology!  When it arrived, it was cold and tasted horrible. Several of us threw the food away, and after calling the manager to discuss the situation were treated rudely and dismissed outright.Another coworker stopped by the salad bar recently and noticed several bugs nearby.Needless to say, you should avoid this place like the plague. Other midtown deli options (e.g. Blake and Todd) are far superior to Dishes.",,,
147,Andrew M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,1,4.0,7/6/2012,"I have been going since the original location on 44th street, and dishes always delivers. Friday hangovers are easily cured with mac n cheese and fried chicken. the chicken summer rolls and light salads make for  atop notch lighter lunch. The rocky road brownie is the best brownie on the planet. Only went four stars because it is comically expensive, but that does not keep me away.",,,
148,Nishant S.,"New York, NY",41,121,0,5.0,2/28/2012,"If you could close your eyes and imagine a cafeteria for the cool, pretentious yuppies - Dishes on Park would be that place. Alas, the food is so good so I keep coming back. The buffet is actually really fresh, the soups are solid but the sandwiches are mostly amazing and so I'm willing to spend a premium here for the quality that it rightly deserves.",,,
149,Jack B.,"New York, NY",0,27,0,1.0,2/14/2012,Dishes is an epic FAIL.  Had a horrible experience at their 45th street location.  See my review on Dishes 45th street.,,,
150,Neal C.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,11,0,2.0,10/14/2011,Very mediocre and slightly over priced. The fried chicken tasted like it came from a TV dinner and the cafeteria line was poorly engineered.,,,
151,Anna L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,3,0,2.0,8/4/2011,"Chaotic and expensive. Food's ok, but I won't be back anytime soon.",,,
152,Caro S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0,4.0,1/19/2009,"Everyone seems to complain about the lines at this place, but it doesn't bother me very much. I come here about once a week, and although it is pricey, is worth my money and time. It's never taken me more than 10 minutes to get to the food - it goes really fast. The layout is cramped but only because there are various stations (sandwich, soup, noodle, buffet), and lots of people, but seriously come on, the quality of food you get here is incomparable to gross msg filled deli buffet. Think about it.My favorite menu is the pecan crusted chicken sandwich with gruyere on a jerusalum bagel, deviled egg salad, Friday sushis, Moroccan eggplant zaalouk, japanese rice... too many to list!!I never get salad here - you can get the same for cheaper elsewhere. I'm not the biggest fan of the noodles either. But the soups, sandwiches, pastries, buffet, breakfast and large catered cakes are delicious.Expensive, but every so often you deserve a good lunch.",,,
153,Adrian M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,4.0,3/23/2011,"Anyone who has ever walked down park avenue during lunch has seen the ridiculous line coming out of this place so I had to try it out. It is true that it is very good and fresh, especially compared to virtually all lunch places nearby, but it is also true that it is a tad bit on the expensive side for what you are buying. That said, it is a nice place to grab food and there is good energy there so it nice to take a break and have a meal there. Don't go during rush hour though! - Adrian Meli",,,
