0,Sarah H.,"New York, NY",218,136,278,4.0,11/16/2018,"This place is super cute, but it gets crazy crowded and the interior is really cramped. We experienced a traffic jam in the vestibule trying to make our way to the host to put our names in! Once we finally made it, though, the wait ended up being only 20 min, which was way less than we expected. We were a party of 3, and we all ordered the English breakfast. I was able to easily substitute extra bacon instead of sausage, which was nice. It's a LOT of food, and I wasn't able to finish it all, but it was good. I didn't care for the beans but my friends both loved them. The mushrooms were my favorite, and the potatoes were really good, well seasoned and soft but not mushy. The bacon was a little disappointing because the menu said it was thick cut, but it seemed to just be regular bacon. Overall, not a bad brunch option if you're in the area. I wouldn't wait more than half an hour or so for it though.",2,,2

They did not have it in their system and eventually let us in to both, though had an attitude they were doing us a favor.Speakeasy, Great drinks, good food.Restaurant very good food, good serviceThey need to get rid of the couches upstairs. The couches were so uncomfortable and awkward to eat from, we all took turns. The other parties we talked did the same thing and had the same feedback.It is also a very loud restaurant.",,,1
2,T K.,"New York, NY",13,108,0,1.0,10/16/2018,"Not sure why this place is so crowded.  We had come here for a drink a while ago, which was very good, and then thought we'd try the food as we were in the area going to OHNY venues.  We showed up and they said it would be half an hour wait for a table for two.  Ok fine, so we went to sit at the back bar where there were two stools to wait.  The host said he'd come find us.  He never even bothered to look.  So there's that.  When the ""bartender"" asked what we wanted, we gave the drink and food order together.  We saw him make the drinks in front of us.  My husband's bloody mary was average, if that.  I ordered a kir royale, one of the easiest drinks to make, if you have a clue.  Which this person clearly didn't.  He put a whole shot of crème de cassis in with the fizz.  The drink was purple and tasted like crap grape soda.  Sadly it didn't match the lipstick that was on the glass it was served in.  Foodwise, it was served way too fast.  I know we were hungry but if we weren't we'd not have eaten it.  The English breakfast, per my English husband, said it was like having a plate with items scooped out of warming trays and slopped on a plate.  Bacon wasn't thick, baked beans looked like throw-up, etc.  Avoid at all costs.I was told the French toast was gone.  Funny because after I had my food served, the person next to me had it.  Anyway I asked for no raisins or walnuts, and it was meant to be stuffed with apples too.  Instead I received three luke warm pancakes and nothing.  I asked where the apples were and he brought out a small bowl of chopped apples that were cold.  Granted he apologised and said they thought I meant plain pancakes, but he could have at least taken the cold ones back and had it prepared properly.  I don't mind spending money on good food, but this was atrocious.  It was good the 'bartender' took the drinks off, but for cold, disgusting food and drinks, as well as dirty glasses, we should not have had to pay for any of it.  Highly recommend avoiding this place at all costs.  Totally overhyped.",,1,

We got there at 8:30pm, but still super crowded. After waiting for 20min we got a table. I ordered cheese-board with three types of cheese, and my bf got devils on horseback for starter and steak for entree.The atmosphere was lovely, just toooooo cold inside...",1,,1
4,Sophia P.,"New York, NY",535,226,62,4.0,10/1/2018,"Nice brunch spot. Four of us went here Sunday around 2 pm with no reservation and it was only a 20-30 minute wait. They don't text when you're table is ready so you have to stay in the alley. This place can be hard to miss. It's literally at the end of the alley. The outside looks floral and rustic and the inside feels like a cabin, but it's spacious.They have cute / mostly sweet cocktails. It seems like they're known for their skillet eggs, which is kind of like shakshuka (eggs and tomato sauce) that comes in a mini skillet pan. I got mine with cheese, and my friends got it with bacon. It comes with a good portion of bacon. It was delicious but not necessarily filling (since it's technically just eggs in sauce). I recommend getting a side. Service was great. The server checked in a lot and was super friendly.",,,
5,Leona L.,"New York, NY",179,113,199,4.0,8/21/2018,"Made brunch reservations for a friend's birthday. I arrived first so I checked in with the hostess and sat at the bar until everyone arrived. The staff was nice, he gave me my coffee and checked in to see if I wanted another later. Once our entire party arrived, we sat down and took awhile deciding what to order from the menu. Our waiter was somewhat patient, he came back a few times until we were ready. We ordered few things to share for the table - artichoke dip, cheese platter, grilled cheddar toasts. Everyone enjoyed their own brunch entree such as the French toast, avocado Benedict and the English breakfast. The artichoke dip was amazing! The cheese platter was not worth it - was small and not a good selection of cheese. The rest of the food was decent but they all took awhile to come. We also brought a cake for my friend and I believe they charge a cake fee of $3-4/pp. We spent quite some time in the restaurant and were never really rushed to finish. Although, there were several times that they kept asking if we were finished with our entrees when we weren't. Be aware, this is a pricey restaurant but it is your classic brunch spot in nyc.  Should definitely make reservations beforehand!",,,
6,Laura K.,"New York, NY",143,79,60,4.0,7/30/2018,"We came to Freemans for a late brunch. The first thing I'll say about this place is the entrance through Freeman's alley is truly a unique feature. Street art fills the walls of the alley and as you walk back, it feels like you're leaving the hustle and bustle of New York. The place itself is really unique on the inside, too. Set in an old house, the dining area feels home-y and intimate.The drinks were very tasty. I got the Gardner with passion fruit puree that did not disappoint. Everyone else at the table also loved their cocktails. We started with the artichoke appetizer that was very good and not too rich. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich with fries. The sandwich itself was delicious. The chicken salad consisted of avocado and corn, which made it really creamy. The fries were salty and crispy (which I loved). I also tried the pulled pork sandwich and the mushroom with grits. Both dishes I really liked. The mushroom grits were a huge hit with the table and I would recommend those for sure. Service wasn't stellar, but maybe just an off day. Overall, this place is a really cool spot if you're looking for something off the beaten path of Manhattan.",1,,
7,Paul F.,"River Edge, NJ",43,59,21,2.0,11/13/2018,"I wanted to like this place for brunch. Went with a friend. Worst coffee in NYC. That's pretty hard to do.I had the omelet. It was nothing to rave about and I guess a piece of toast is a la carte. The greens were just that..... a pile of leaves, no dressing. My friend had what I believe was some sort of eggs Benedict that looked like a bowl of soup. To be fair she said she enjoyed it. Also not every person is 5""7"" 130lbs. I had to disrupt the table next to me just to slide by and I'm not a ""wide body"". I dropped my napkin and had to call the Army Corp of engineers to pick it up. I might give Freemans another shot.....learn how to make coffee.",,,
8,Erica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,229,292,4.0,8/11/2018,"A mystery location in between chinatown and the lower east side. Such a hidden gem for a brunch restaurant in NYC.Came here for brunch with 5 other friends. Service was quick and staffs were friendly. Food-wise: i decided to eat healthy for once so I ordered the Avocado Benedict. Portion size was decent and wow, gotta say it was filling! Although avocados are know to fill you up lol. Anyways, the avocado benedict tasted great. Perfect balance of citrus from the lemon hollandaise sauce and such perfect runny poached eggs.",,,
9,Bill R.,"Louisville, KY",30,84,136,3.0,10/12/2018,"Little hipster joint down the end of a alley.   Arrived and where seated quickly.  The place is adorned with taxidermy everywhere.  It feels less like you are in a middle European social club.  Ordered a old fashioned $16.   Had Fillet Minion, that includes mash potatoes and a caramelized onion $36.   Also ordered a side salad $11.   Meat was I little chew, but not bad.  Total with 2 drinks was $83 with tax.  Not excessive for NYC.",,,
10,Alex I.,"Raleigh, NC",265,129,208,3.0,10/7/2018,"I had brunch here with one other person on a Saturday around 12. We didn't have a reservation but they sat us in about 10-15 minutes. We sat at the bar to have a drink and the bartender was so rude. He practically threw the menus at us and immediately asked what we wanted- not a great start. We were eventually seated, our server was really nice. The dining area had great decor and ambiance. It was very easy to have a conversation in there without having to yell. I had the yogurt and thought it was really really below average, absolutely nothing special about. Some of the fruit seemed passed its expiration and not very fresh. Like I said our server was nice but we only saw her twice, once to greet us and once when we flagged her down to get our check. Very mediocre if not poor service and underwhelming food. Not somewhere I'll return, but sure it's cute and trendy.",,,
11,Angelina T.,"Vancouver, Canada",156,67,31,4.0,6/30/2018,Freemans was great. We had the buttermilk pancakes and eggs benny both were great. I liked the pancakes more. The ricotta cream was a great balance to the sweet pancakes. My boyfriend liked the candied ginger he thinks they added some complexity to an otherwise simple dish.There were 2 eggs on a ton of mixed greens for the benny and it made the entire meal feel healthy and refreshing.Great for a light breakfast/brunch. Lots of cool art in the alley as well.It was fun to look at all the decorative items.,2,,1
12,Neil C.,"Miami, FL",105,161,1427,4.0,6/12/2018,"Freeman's is a gem that's tucked away in a little alley in Manhattan. The food is really good here whether it's brunch, lunch, or dinner. We came here for brunch one morning because the egg skillet looked too good from all the Yelp pics.So I ordered the Skillet Eggs with Bacon and Cheese which came out scorching hot on a skillet and stayed hot as I ate it slowly. It was pretty good and I would give it 4 stars. I wish it came with some grits which I thought it was supposed to, but it was still satisfying.My company ordered the Mushroom and Grits which happened to be the better dish here and might be easily overlooked on the menu. Beautiful presentation and the grits were moist and perfect with some cheese inside that complimented it very well. There must have been 5 different types of mushrooms in it. Some were very large and juicy. This dish was amazingly good and I wish I had ordered it.The service was superb and attentive. Servers are knowledgeable about the food and advised that the menu items can change every quarter due to seasonality. Therefore, they might not have some menu items that you'll find from pics on Yelp. This place is also beautiful inside and out and the food is reasonably priced. Can't wait to come back for lunch/dinner.",3,1,2
13,Patricia N.,"New York, NY",201,228,433,4.0,7/3/2018,Honestly was disappointed at the dinner menu. I know they have lots of goodies for brunch but needed a place to grab dinner and decided to give Freeman's a try. 4 stars because the food did not disappoint. Yes it's pricey but that chicken was cooked so perfectly. It's a big dish so you're getting your moneys worth. I'm also the type to never get chicken because it's so plain Jane. But this chicken dish proved me wrong. Seasoned and cooked well. Also had the salmon and it was good but the chicken blew my mind. I can't wait to come back for brunch.,1,,
14,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",226,387,698,4.0,6/11/2018,"Adorable restaurant for brunch! Hidden down an alley with cute, rustic decor inside and out.Food is also reasonably priced and delicious!

15,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1550,4.0,6/1/2018,"Freemans has long been an Instagrammable brunch spot, even before Instagram. From the tucked-in-an-alley location to the deer heads on the wall, everything here is charmingly rustic and picture perfect.Though it's a popular spot, you won't have to worry about getting seated if you go on the earlier side on weekends (before 11 am). When I've come past noon, there's been about a 45 minute wait. Brunch dishes run in the high teens, and drinks are $15-- if you plan to drink, it'll likely be a $40 - 50 post-tax and tip situation.On my most recent visit, my boyfriend got the full English breakfast ($21), which was big and satisfying. It takes the fun bits of it (bacon, beans, mushrooms) and leaves the less palatable elements (blood sausage, anyone?).I had the quinoa bowl ($16), which ended up being more of a quinoa-sprinkled salad with disparate chunks of ingredients. It failed to cohere, even with a great poached egg and a zingy dressing. I would stick with classic brunch dishes here, like eggs benedict or avocado toast.Service is typically quite good and brunch is a speedy proposition (an hour at peak, faster at off-peak). A bathroom trip is a must so you can poke through the space.Not necessarily a destination for food, but the atmosphere is quite nice and I don't dread taking out-of-towners here.",6,2,2
16,Vanessa K.,"East Bay, CA",151,1113,542,2.0,9/17/2018,"Freemans is highly rated on yelp. I am trying to understand the reasoning. I suppose it has to be location/environment. I will say that it's ""kitschy."" It's a building that has been re-purposed into a restaurant. The ""dining room"" basically consists of several different rooms in the building. So the decor and the ambiance is nice. You do feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle that is NYC. However, decor/environment aside. Food sucks. Seriously. The options are extremely limited for brunch, and it's not even typical brunch fare (i.e. eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, etc). The brunch options are uninteresting and everything is an add on. EVERYTHING. In line with NYC prices, the items are expensive and nothing special to write about. The eggs were overcooked. I don't understand NYC yelpers...what is up with all the hype for nothingness?",,,1
17,Sunidhi G.,"Jersey City, NJ",124,104,159,4.0,6/8/2018,"Came here with friends for the famed brunch. Surprisingly there wasn't a lot of wait for the tables. They let you sit at the bar and order drinks/food. The place is hidden in an ally and is like a refurbished old house. Pretty cool. The music however felt really loud.Service was decent. Drinks were interesting as well. We got orange juice  with clove flavor and really liked it. What stood out was the French Toast. It was so good and definitely worth coming back for. With strawberries, whipped cream and right amount of sweetness it was the highlight of the brunch.Another highlight was the black bean burger. It was terrible. The first time they gave a burnt patty. Fries were well done. However, when we complained they got us a new burger. This time it was uncooked and fries were half cooked too. So, in all do not order the burgers here.Come for the French Toast and cool atmosphere",2,,1
18,Stephanie N.,"Grand Rapids, MI",92,119,79,4.0,5/30/2018,"The atmosphere is easily a 10/10. It's tucked away in an alley with the cutest windows, lights, and blue exterior. Inside there are a good amount of seats, and we were placed in a private back room with wine bottles lining the wall. Kind of felt like someone's private home with the candles! The staff was very attentive and gave good advice on what to order.The food was okay overall, my favorite was the spinach dip that came with crostini. It was warm, not too salty, and very flavorful. The brunch cocktails were all delicious, but my breakfast bowl was lacking something. It was mashed sweet potato, scrambled eggs, arugula, and granola, and the combination of flavors wasn't for me.My friends burger was a little rare for being medium, but the sandwich portions are huge. Overall, it's a very cute place with decent food and okay-ish prices. It's location makes it worth checking out though.",3,,4

Fantastic brunch!! Highly recommend making a reservation because wait times can get crazy on weekends. Despite how busy the restaurant gets, service was great and we did not feel rushed out at all. We enjoyed the devils on horseback, fish board, avocado Benedict and pancakes!! I would love to come back soon to enjoy the dinner menu... I imagine it's a nice, romantic dinner date spot.",,,
20,Rachel M.,"Auburn Hills, MI",5,114,179,5.0,7/2/2018,"Came in for a private event, and the entire restaurant was reserved for our event, so my review is based on that.  I had such an awesome time at this restaurant.  The staff was super friendly and personable and the drinks and food are very top notch.  Food was served family style, and servers explained what everything was being delivered. Absolutely loved the food, and mac and cheese was my favorite.  What I loved most about this restaurant, is the decor, and how it is kind of off the beaten path.  It seemed very New York to have to walk down an alley way to get there. The decor is absolutely adorable,and I can see the restaurant being reserved for many types of events, I can see a wedding reception being a huge hit.   I would love to come back to NYC and have a regular dinner experience at this restaurant, but otherwise,  service & food were first class.",,,
21,Janelle B.,"New York, NY",344,87,409,4.0,6/23/2018,"I've heard about Freemans for awhile now, and it looked like an awesome place from all of the photos. When I went to go check out this spot, I couldn't believe my eyes! It was beautifully decorated and very cozy. I especially loved the ally that we walked through. The servers were very friendly and it wasn't too busy. We were seated right away. When you look on the outside of the restaurant you think that's a small, but it is not. There are two floors and another space in the back. The menu has some great options. I ordered the French Toast, but I probably wouldn't order it again. It was a little bit soggy, and the syrup was a little bit weird. But, I would love to try out other dishes that they have there. It seemed liked other meals would be good though.",,,
22,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",229,142,835,4.0,5/5/2018,"I'm ashamed to call myself a New Yorker and admit that I've never even heard of this place. Especially when it has been around for over a decade. But hey, it's NYC. There's a ton of hidden gems in this city. So Freemans is located on the cusp of Chinatown and Lower East Side. It's down an alley that you would easily miss and probably normally avoid. It's not as sketchy as I made it just sound but again, it's NYC. Avoiding alleyways should just be a general rule. At the end of the alley, you'll find what looks like a quaint house. The restaurant is actually quite big and spacious with a lot of antlers for decor. We were here for brunch and started with the warm article dip. This isn't your Applebee's dip, there's actual shreds of artichoke and really quite addicting. I had the steak and eggs and my girlfriend ordered the English breakfast. Both were very simple but well executed. My sunny side eggs could've been a bit more runny but it was fine. It's a great find and better late than never. I'll definitely be back.",3,3,3

24,Amy R.,"Louisville, KY",55,183,181,4.0,10/24/2018,So you go down a private alley to a small entrance at the very back. But don't let this out-of-the-way location fool you this is a great place to eat. It has a 1920s speakeasy crossed with the hunting lodge feel. Kind of small so I recommend reservations. I got the pasta it was fantastic. My husband got the fillet Which was good but nothing to write home about. It's a little more on the expensive side but this is New York! Overall I recommend it. And if you go a little early you'll have more room,,,
25,Sarah K.,"Cambridge, MA",0,71,164,5.0,11/14/2018,Brunch was great.  Ordered pancakes to share for the table and they were delicious!  Sweet crunch from the nuts and tart from the apple made it a crowd pleaser.  I had the Reuben Benedict which was very tasty especially the buttery biscuit like bread as the base.  Definitely on the list to try for dinner.,,,

28,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",874,1242,25,4.0,7/4/2018,"3.5 to 4 star.  The atmosphere, service, craft drinks top notch - the food itself was good but not entirely complex. You do get good portions for what you pay though (as far as NYC goes).  This review is for dinner. I think the dinner menu is a bit limited, and that the brunch is more where it's at. So I'd come back for that.Got a same day reservation at 815 for 4 people. Granted it was a Tuesday before a holiday (July 4). The restaurant is tight, I wouldn't go there with a large group (though they have a private dining option). It is however such a charming place for a date, has a nice farm to table woody tavern feel. It's also in its own alley way which gives it a speakeasy feeling and thus exclusive..ish. To start, we had the hot artichoke dip. It was rustic (not a Spinach Artichoke dip) and served with lots of crostini type bread. It was good, hearty. We also had a breadcrumby 5 cheese mac which was good, but didn't taste cheesy. We also shared yummy shishito peppers which were a bit too lemony for my taste. For dinner, I had a juicy well cooked chicken with crispy skin. It wasn't the best roast chicken I had but it was pretty good. It was prepared with hearty vegetables, garlic.  My husband had the lomo saltado (random for a new American spot) special - got the last one of the night. It was crispy pork belly (well cooked, but fatty), with a bed of fried rice, french fries, etc - traditional preparation.The other couple we dined with both got the lamb loin which was done over cous cous and with other herbs. Among other things on the menu were classics like trout, scallops risotto, and a vegetarian pasta. For dessert, we shared both the rhubarb, orange compote crumble with mascaporne ice cream and chocolate sauce brownie with vanilla ice cream. I did not taste the mascaporne is the former,  but overall the crumble was good. It's more me than the brownie. Both desserts were very big portions. Overall, the server was attentive, and made good recommendations. Felt the food came out a bit slowly though but we were in no rush. We had plenty of drinks - which is another thing of their specialty. I had some kind of cucumber rum type of drink which was floral and refreshing - Dakota something. They was a large array of drinks; and they can make anything you want at the bar like a martini. Dinner for two came to $160... Recommend, it's a cool spot.",5,2,3

I felt the wind was flowing in through the cracks. Besides that, the decorations are unique. You can feel the owner have good taste and thought in the settings.Food depressed me a little. I ordered avocado toast and the toast was just too hard and crusted. My other two friends felt the same. Maybe our three just not like to bite hard coincidentally. And the other food my friends ordered were not too amazing either. Maybe because I didn't have much interest in eating any more in the end, as I was getting too cold sitting there... I am thinking about giving this place a second try, some time in summer. As I see many people love this place and give high ratings.",1,,1

I finally made it in one summer weekend as the hostess told my friend a good time they keep 1/3 of their tables open for walk ins and if we get there between 10-10:30 there will likely not be a very long wait at all... and it was true! Perhaps the rest of the city was vacationing at the Hampton's or down the shore, but whatever it was, I'll take it. The ambience is so so rustic, trendy, cute and the cocktails are inventive and tasty. I would rate the food 4/5 and the service A+.

For the fish salad, I don't like the taste of the salmon, but I like the side and the dressing(not sure).

37,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,3/5/2018,"TLDR: dimly lit, cozy restaurant with taxidermy-filled walls and a ""grandparent's house"" vibe; good, but heavy foodCame here on a Saturday for brunch around 3:15pm. Since it was pretty late in the day, the restaurant was half empty and there were plenty of open tables in both the front room--which was brighter, quieter, and filled with older guests--and the back room--which was dimmer, louder, and had mid-to-late 20's groups participating in boozy brunch. We were seated to the left of a group of 4 women drinking numerous rounds of sangria / mimosas and laughing very loudly and behind a group of 8 guys who were also very loud and appeared to be having a great time. This made it a little difficult to have normal conversation, so I wish we had been seated in the front room. There was also a draft in the room that made my friend and me want to keep our jackets on.I had read good things about the hot artichoke dip (with crisp bread), so we decided to start with that and then I ordered the skillet eggs with bacon added (served with buttered sourdough toast) for my entree after it was recommended by our waitress. The hot artichoke dip was absolutely delicious, albeit a bit heavy, with a broiled cheesy top layer, served with a mountain of bread. Unfortunately, the skillet eggs fell a bit short in comparison, as they were under-seasoned and slightly overcooked (I like my eggs a bit runny, but the yolk was mostly baked through). After adding salt and pepper, it tasted better, but I've definitely had better baked eggs elsewhere in the city (i.e. Cafe Gitane). My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and wasn't that crazy about her dish either, as she found it to be very heavy and too cheesy.Landed on 4 stars for this place because of the amazing artichoke dip balanced out by the average entrees. Worth a try if you're craving a traditional American brunch.",,,
38,Hanah L.,"Arcadia, CA",412,28,47,5.0,6/10/2018,"Even though we decided to go here by accident (looking for Friedman's), I'm so happy we ended up here. We were lucky enough to be seated as soon as we walked in. The ambience was casual/intimate and I lived for the aesthetic of the decor--walking through this tiny alley, it seems almost like a door to another world away from busy Manhattan.All of the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful--gave extremely good recs for what to get!! Sometimes there was a little bit of waiting around in between ordering and getting the food that we ordered, but the staff was prompt and attentive whenever we had a question.As for the food--GET THE ARTICHOKE DIP!! Honestly, it comes out all warm and gooey and cheesy and goes perfectly with the crostini. It's super easy to share too. I got the French toast (recommended by my server) and enjoyed every single bite. The slice of bread was thick and soft, and paired well with the fruit and fruit syrup that accompanied it (honestly, no need for maple!). Absolutely perfect--sweet, with just a bit of citrusy tang. My friend got the egg skillet and enjoyed it as well.I love brunch and I love Freemans!!",3,,

Straight-forward brunch menu. My fiancé and I split the yogurt, berries and granola and the avocado eggs Benedict. Both super yummy and reasonably priced.I'd recommend adding bacon or a protein to the avocado eggs Benedict as it could have used a little more something.

Updated review",Still a cozy breakfast place with delicious food. I came here on a Thursday around noon and got seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and food came out pretty quickly. I ordered the French toast which was delicious. I didn't need any syrup on the toast because it had so much flavor and sauce from the fruit and whip cream already. It tasted like cinnamon French toast. The dish was pretty small though only one piece of bread but was perfect for a lighter breakfast. My sister had the avocado benedicts and it came with a lot of greens but was also very good. Lighter as well. Can't remember the names of our cocktails but they were also very good. Highly recommend this place. Both times I've been here there have been no lines but I can see this place getting backed on the weekends.,6,4,5
50,Victoria D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",163,59,46,4.0,5/25/2018,"To get to the restaurant itself is a mini adventure. You have to walk down an alley decorated with graffiti and art along both sides, completely in tune with the vibe around the area. I loved it! I ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich and my friend got the burger. Both were delicious. The brisket sandwich was much bigger than I had anticipated and the bread was sturdier than the burger bun which I highly appreciated. My sandwich came with greens and my friend's burger had fries that were pleasantly salty. I definitely stole my fair share. The prices are higher and is nice for a once in a while lunch but for every day, it can add up quickly. The decor and environment was nice and relaxed and the service staff checked on us plenty!",1,,

52,Craig C.,"Jersey City, NJ",143,380,138,4.0,4/3/2018,"My girlfriend and I came here for brunch to fuel up for a day of biking, and we loved it.I'm really big on restaurant atmosphere, sometimes to a fault. I'll go to a restaurant that looks really cool, even if their food isn't the best. Luckily, Freeman's ticks both boxes, and we had a great experience. It was the Sunday brunch after St. Patrick's Day, so we were expecting a huge wait. To our surprise, we discovered that we could sit at the bar in the back room right away without waiting at all. Win!The place itself feels like an escape from Manhattan. I won't make a poor attempt at describing it in detail - just look at the pictures. Dimly lit, rustic, with taxidermy scattered around. Really, my kind of place.I went with the turkey sandwich, which came THICK with turkey along with arugula, avocado, and just a small amount of spicy mayonnaise. When I say thick with turkey, I mean it. There had to be at least 5 pretty good sized slices. It was absolutely perfect and I enjoyed it alot. The only thing I would have liked is maybe just a little bit more spicy mayonnaise. It was served alongside crispy, thin french fries that helped in my mission to fuel up for our bike ride. I paired it all with a beer, and I was set.My girlfriend, who has much more restraint and discipline than I do, got the house made granola, which came with greek yogurt, seasonal fruit, and honey. She was very happy with her meal as well. All in all, we were glad that we chose Freeman's. From the minute you walk down Freeman's Alley to the restaurant, it's an experience. I'm glad I had it bookmarked for sure.",3,1,2

The cheesy artichoke dip was so great- highly recommend for a starter! We also had French toast with maple syrup, squash salad and their House-Smoked Brisket sandwiches - the french fries were hot and crispy. They also brought out the egg white&mushroom omelettes for the table. We had great service but we could have used 1 more waitress in the room- she seemed a bit overwhelmed with about 30 of us crammed into this back room.

58,Kaiyan Y.,"UCLA, Los Angeles, CA",84,26,24,5.0,3/4/2018,"Definitely an NYC go-to place to check out. Great food, good service, but what's most precious is the environment, the decoration, and the alley stretching out from the restaurant. It surely will become a not-so-secret secret spot for me and my friends to visit often when we want to have that brunch bestie talk. So part of me really wish you guys could come and sit and eat and taking bunches of great pictures, but another part of me really doesn't want this place to be overcrowded for me to wait seats too long.But the waiting time is acceptable, only 10-15mins even during Sunday noon.

64,Amanda G.,"New York, NY",201,88,73,4.0,3/12/2018,"It's not often that you wander down a random alleyway in NYC and stumble upon something as lovely as Freemans. My friend and I came for brunch on Sunday and, despite the crowds, were seated almost immediately. The waiter was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The decor in here is very very hipster--I couldn't help but wonder how much their taxidermy budget was, and a portrait of an inquisitive old man with glasses gazed down on us as we ate. But it made for good conversation starters!We split the black bean burger and the smoked salmon avocado toast. Both were good--very tasty and beautifully arranged--but not quite 5-stars-good. The burger was a wee bit on the dry side and the avocado toast barely had any avocado on it. The smoked salmon was exquisite, but if i'm going to sacrifice being able to afford a house one day for $22 avocado toast, I would prefer a generous amount of avocado. I was a big fan of the generous amount of pickles on the burger, though, and the fries were the perfect level of crispiness.All in all, though, Freemans is quite good. I recommend the smoked trout. The iced coffee was also great. FYI if you come here hungover like I did, you may find that the music is a little overwhelming. But that was admittedly my fault.",,,1
65,Morgan B.,"Lawrence, KS",2,88,75,4.0,3/11/2018,"Food was great! I went with a large business party, we had a private room. We had the Hemingway cocktail to start. We then had the artichoke dip, mushroom donuts for appetizers. For dinner, we had the steak, served with mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, and Mac & cheese. My favorite side was the brusselsprouts! I had the chocolate pie and it was overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. Too much dark and too much salt, not enough whipped cream or pie crust.  My pet peeve was with the water. They serve room temperature water in small 8 oz glasses. It's annoying and I wanted a large glass of cold water that didn't need constant refills. Anyway, great food and drinks, bad water service.",,,
66,Jenny J.,"New York, NY",426,104,207,3.0,6/24/2017,"Pros:Homey vibe. But if you're creeped out by taxidermy, don't go. Entrance is photo-worthy and cute.Not $$$ prices, more like $$. Large amount of space inside (though it's mostly at the bar if you don't want to wait).Cons:Food isn't that good. I got the Egg White Omelet ($14), and the broccoli was surprisingly embedded in the omelet. The combination of broccoli and cheese was unappetizing. Salad on the side was decent though. My friend got the Smoked Trout ($17) and that, the little olive-like things on the side, and mini pickles were all too salty. Only the cheeseburger ($17) tasted really good. The secret sauce, which might actually be hollandaise sauce, went well with the lettuce and patty. However, even though the patty was Medium Rare, the outside was partially burnt. Fries were thin and crispy. Artichoke dip ($15) is good though, as the reviews have raved about. But eating bread from that, then having bread from the Smoked Trout was too much. Service was good and water was filled promptly by bartender. Luckily the appetizer took a while to eat and when we were almost done, our main dishes came at that moment. I probably wouldn't come again, as I don't like the animals looking at me and there's nothing special about the food, besides maybe the dip.",2,1,1

Because of the high reviews, we decided to walk around and wait until they opened.The service after we entered was friendly and efficient. We ordered the Mac & Cheese and the Fish Sandwich for lunch. Honestly, both items left a lot to be desired. My husband who's a huge fan of Mac & Cheese was even disappointed in this one as it was a bit gritty and the crumbly topping was kind of a let down. The Fish Sandwich was not much better; it was fairly small in size but I still didn't eat the whole thing. It came with fries which were on the greasy side, completely unappetizing.Overall, very disappointed! I had really high expectations but maybe their breakfast / brunch is better.

How do you solve this problem? go EAT! We stumbled upon freeman ally which freemans is located at the end of. Such a cool ally way, praying that NYC keeps these hidden streets and cool art concepts around for a long long time. It is an ally where the walls are covered in cool street art and I mean cool! The restaurant looked busy with a few groups standing outside to be seated so I was thinking it was going to be a nightmare of a wait and especially when the hosts see 4 kids it is usually a nightmare. Host was nicer than usual told us the wait I believe was 35-40minutes but right away offered us a coach area that had lower tables kind of like a lounge section I guess if someone was just coming for drinks, we took it and what a great choice that was. Our waiter was extremely patient with us and food over all was good. We had french toast, steak and eggs and a few things for the kids that were all good and our wives had the burgers which they said was delicious.The decor of the place was One of a kind! It felt like we were in a high end upstate spot, wooden floors and old style furniture around.

I dined here on two separate occasions for brunch, hoping the 2nd attempt would change my opinion but unfortunately, still no. I tried the hot artichoke dip and buttermilk pancakes at my first visit. The hot artichoke dip was okay, I didn't hate it but it was pretty heavy. The buttermilk pancakes were terrible though. It was tasteless and nothing special. It looked like something I could make at home.I can't remember what I tried the 2nd time around. I only remember it being okay and better than my first visit. So in other words, not memorable.",,,

Yes, the ambiance is adorable and the location is unique however, the brunch food did not impress me. I ordered the poached eggs which came with roasted tomato, cheddar grits and buttered toast, so nothing overly complicated or exciting. I really expected that for Freemans to put such a simple dish on the menu, it would be done really well. It was fine but nothing to write home about.

They are famous for their unique location down a charming, graffitied ally; slightly hidden but not difficult to find.Overall I am UNIMPRESSED with the food.The baked skillet eggs shakshuka was probably the most underwhelming that I've tried. It was neither spicy nor saucy...as shakshuka SHOULD BE and the eggs were poorly done. Two were underdone and one was overdone... How does that even happen. Smh *face palm*Also, I am unsure how or why the artichoke dip ($15) is popular because although it looked appetizing, it was greasy/oily rather than creamy. It made me nauseous. Honestly, I'm not an artichoke connoisseur but this cannot be what the good stuff tastes like.Freemans could be a good first date spot... you take her for a few cocktails, but don't wanna spent $$$ on dinner, (thankfully there's room at the bar), but at the same time you won't look cheap or boring because *ambiance* is A+",8,4,4
78,Matt C.,"Sausalito, CA",6,133,3,4.0,1/11/2018,"Been there twice, been stuffed full of tasty food twice. Just thinking about the place makes me hungry.Pretty much everything on the brunch menu is good: poached eggs, grits, thick-cut bacon. But the winner: Skillet Eggs, Bacon, Spinach, and Gruyere buttered sourdough toast.The decorations add a bunch of character: artwork, taxidermy, pots hanging from the walls, stairs that go nowhere. The alley entry is a nice, unique approach. This is a cool place to show off, since it's out of the way for most people who are not familiar with the East Village (I include myself). Unfortunately, that probably means it will soon become way too popular.Just make sure to get there early on the weekends, because they don't take reservations for small groups, and the place fills up quickly.",,,

It ended up becoming one of my favorite brunch spots in Brooklyn. Freeman's may look tiny from the outside, but there are multiple, interesting cabin-esque dining rooms inside, and we've never really had to wait a painful amount. Their servers are friendly and I've never had an unpleasant encounter, despite how crazy busy they typically are.Their cocktail selection is awesome - I've never had a bad drink here. We always get the cheesy-artichoke dip to start. I could eat those all friggin day. Their Mac n Cheese is baked perfectly and their pancakes could feed two. We've yet to come here for dinner, but it isn't exactly the most convenient location-wise. I'd recommend this place to those looking to spice the vibe up for brunch.

The mac and cheese was guilty good. The trout was surprisingly juicy and true to its natural flavors with simple seasoning. The steak tasted so dry and rubbery, a mere two bites was too nuch before it was sent back to the kitchen. Absolutely clueless why they would serve it at all... especially for a restaurant of this level. Surprised they would still charge it on the bill.

83,Hui C.,"Manhattan, NY",326,267,121,4.0,4/16/2017,"TL;DR: cute tiny space with good brunch, but no substitutions available on the weekends makes it a little tough for vegetarians. A friend and I came for brunch on Saturday and only had to wait 20-30 mins for a table, which I felt was very reasonable. There seemed to be a good number of options that could be vegetarian, i.e. If bacon or some meat were taken out or replaced, but when I asked, I was told that the kitchen didn't do replacements on the weekends bc they're so busy. Makes sense, but I was glad I'd never been here before bc that made a grand total of like 3 things I could eat. Lots of tasty looking sides, though - I could imagine this being a good group brunch place.My friend and I both got the poached eggs with cheesy grits and collard greens, as we're both from the South and miss grits. These were delicious and hit the spot - portion size was great and I felt satisfied but not overfilled. We both paid ~$20 and left feeling pretty happy. I'd come back but maybe with some non vegetarian friends who can appreciate the variety of options here a little better.",2,1,1

I got a vegetable omelette (comes with a mixed green salad) and a biscuit. Omelet was kind of rubbery, salad and biscuit were just ok. The ambiance is great though so it's worth visit- save it for a visit during the winter since there's no outdoor seating. They have a ton of taxidermy on the walls and it's very cozy.

Do you waiting in line in a kitschy perfectly graffitied alley way for hours, with a reservation, for a table. Do like not being able to have a conversation with your friends once the VIP lounge bouncer aka the ripped knit sweater hat flannel shirt wearing in summer, hostess decides you deserve a table in the 2nd loudest restaurant in America. The first one is Bolton & Watt for your information. Or when your friends insist that they must have just been have a excessively busy day so you give it one more chance and they stick you in an upstairs attic, I kept looking for cobwebs and Christmas ornaments one generally stores in an attic. There was no one else seated upstairs in the attic and wait staff had trouble serving us since we were practically hidden. The icing on the cake was after my table of 10 were told (while still eating our entree) that we couldn't order more drink or dessert because they needed the attic for a party that the room was reserved for. When we said but we aren't done they said well I'm sorry but you have to pay and leave within the next 10 minutes. Well I was ready to just walkout on the bill and say adios but decided to be the bigger person and never ever ever come back. It's a shame the food is pretty good I do like the -devils on horseback, which I discovered are the easiest thing in the world to make so no need to get them at this disaster-the Artichoke Dip, like it could be bad -Skillet eggs, spinach, grits, cheddar, bacon and butter toast $13 is delicious but they got rid of it by the 2nd time I came so.....",6,3,7

We went for drinks and my boyfriend tried to close our tab - the bartender came over and said he accidentally gave my bf's card to another customer ""but the tab was right and please sign."" Ummm, you're not giving back the credit card and you're actually charging for the drinks? Not even, ""so sorry, I took one drink off for your trouble."" We asked if we could call the next day to see if the card might be returned and were told to call the main number. Well that's a joke because it's just a recording and no one picks up and you can't even leave a message unless you direct it to special events. So we left a message there given we had no other option. Hopefully a manager is reading this and leaves a message back with a real number to call where a human will pick up!

I'm a very flexible person but when you go out for brunch in Manhattan to spend your hard earned money on your loved ones, you expect a certain level of professionalism from the wait staff, chefs, management, all the way up.

You're basically walking into a speakeasy restaurant. As you walk there, you'll see a ton of street art. Once you finally get to the restaurant, you'll be even more intrigued. The ambiance (inside and outside) is out of this world. It's almost like you took a turn and entered some parallel universe outside of New York. You just don't feel like you're in the city anymore. If you somehow make it through your time there without taking any pictures, I'm going to assume your phone broke or died. Then, there's the service at Freemans. Our waitress was polite and accommodating. You're made to feel right at home. On top of that, our food was delicious.

The inside is just as eclectic (taxidermy, anyone?) The atmosphere & aesthetics are five stars... ...but the good stuff stops there.

I opted for Shakshuka. I prefer moist and fluid egg yolk for a Shakshuka as it would be nice to dip the bread.

I was unimpressed with my order (sausage) but I dined with a few quitters that didn't finish their meals. I gladly earned them their spot in the clean plate club. I was able to try the filet, mac n cheese, fish n chips special, and the lamb. All really good. My problem with the sausage is that it was $30. When ordering, I new it was going to be a gamble between ""DAMN, now this is what a $30 sausage tastes like!"" and ""Damn, this sausage was $30...?"". Unfortunately it was the latter.

We were seated upstairs so it was pretty quiet compared to downstairs. So if you and party are doing some catching up, upstairs is probably better for talking as downstairs is a bit loud. The food, wasn't impressive whatsoever. It is somewhat overpriced for its quality to be honest. I ordered the roasted pork sandwich, the meat was a bit on the dry side and it's lacking some flavor, the fries that came with it was mediocre. I only ate half because it was not appetizing at all. Fiancé got poached egg breakfast with cheese grits and toasts. He wasn't too fond with it either. Our friend got cheese burger, which looked okay. He's actually been there 3+ times so we suppose he likes this place. His wife got the BLT salad with chicken, which looked decent. I meant, how can you mess that up? The service, however, was 10/10.

Would have been cool to sit there too. The menu has something for everyone and is extremely tasty! We got the kale caesar, trout, buttermilk biscuit sandwich, and hot artichoke dip. ALL extremely good, but standouts were hot artichoke dip and biscuit! For cocktails, we stuck with the champagne ones, but the bloody mary's looked awesome.

I think my boyfriend and I enjoyed our cocktails more than our food. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but the cocktail was crafted so well. He had the La Murga, while i had the French 75. For brunch we had the egg white omelette with squash, baked egg skillet and a side of thick cut bacon. I'm not a fan of bacon, but this was super delish! Really crispy and also pairs well with the omelette, since there is no meat. You can't really go wrong with the baked eggs, but I wish the eggs were more runny. The yolk was pretty much 90% cooked. Flavor was perfect though. There is usually a long wait for Freemans on the weekends. We came around 1pm on Sunday and waited about 30 mins for a table for 2. No big deal since the food was great!

116,Jennifer L.,"Calgary, Canada",148,227,673,2.0,7/11/2017,"A friend of mine who use to live in NYC recommended Freemans for brunch/lunch because of how unique the location is. So I was on the hunt for Freemans, she mentioned that its hidden down an alley and I wouldn't have spotted it if I didn't know about it.Freemans is a neat spot in the lower east side down near China town and SOHO down an unusual alley with art work. Nat and I were on a bit of a hunt, google maps was being weird so we got a little lost but were in the general area. We took a turn and saw a outdoor sign that had a brunch special and arrow - there was Freemans!!  There is a bunch of unique art work and a baby blue door which is the entrance. We walked in and you have to walk through some curtains before you are greeted. We were seated right up front near the entrance and a two table top and handed menus. I looked around and it was dimmed lighting so I couldn't see much.I went with the scrambled eggs with roasted potatoes and I chose sausage links. Nat went with the steak & eggs sandwich which came with potato salad and we shared an order of beer-battered onion rings. I was pretty excited for the food to arrive because of the recommendation and reviews. When it did arrive, I was excited to see a full plate! I started to eat my meal and noticed that it was really greasy and bland tasting. The eggs were a little on the dry side, the potatoes weren't crispy at all and when I had some potatoes it left grease marks on the plate. The sausage was nothing special....needless to say, I was super dissatisfied. Nat's sandwich came with lettuce, cheddar cheese, spicy mayo, shredded beef with scrambled eggs and the side of potato salad. She noticed right away that it wasn't your classic 'steak' but shredded pieces of beef. It would have been nice to have the option of how she wanted her eggs done but otherwise, she enjoyed her sandwich. The potato salad on the other hand was....odd tasting. It was almost gritty and was super bland. The potatoes had no texture and were way too soft. They need some kind of crunch in the salad and something for flavor, we didn't finish the potato salad. Now for the onion rings, they were HUGE! There was four rings and they were lightly battered with a  nice crispiness. They didn't have much flavor either but they are just onion rings after all. It was neat to see them that big but for pretty much $2 a piece, it wasn't worth it.Our server was kind of attentive, he filled our waters but we had to ask a couple times. The food wasn't good - it was actually a huge disappointment for us. I had my eye on the turkey sandwich at first but changed it to a classic brunch last minute. Full of regrets!!!!!! They say their food is American style...simple, rustic and inspired by old world traditions. I get it but it was way too simple and did they not have any flavor in the old world?!  Neat location but that's about it.*sigh*",1,,1

We end up walking to an empty building with stairs & decided to go out then I ask some random guy who brought us to the right place.

Me & my brother end up getting the turkey sandwich with potato salad on the side. My bf & sister got the cheeseburger. Ehhh The food was okay. Nothings special. My potato salad was a bit sour.

Freemans is great for both intimate meals and large group gatherings. It was really easy to make a reservation online for my group of 9. We were seated upstairs and everyone loved the unique and home-y decor. We started off with the artichoke dip as an appetizer, and it was definitely one of the best artichoke dips we've all had. It came with a generous portion of bread for dipping and wasn't too heavy or oily even so early in the morning. The majority of us ordered the baked skillet eggs shakshuka, while a few others ordered the full english breakfast and the buttermilk pancakes (with ricotta and strawberries). The shakshuka was very filling and loaded with spinach and flavorful tomato sauce. The portion sizes are reasonable for the price and will leave you feeling satisfied. Our only complaint of the brunch was that our waiter was MIA most of the time and wasn't very friendly. We had to ask one of the food runners to help us hunt him down so that we could get our check and we were also mis-billed on an item. Overall, a solid brunch option on the Lower East Side!",1,,1

I think there are some seasonal dishes that are only on the menu in the restaurant. The walk down the alley is really charming and makes you feel like you're no longer in the city. The interior decor is certainly different and eccentric. I'm not usually a fan of taxidermy, but I was surprised by how little it bothered me. The atmosphere is really welcoming and the waitstaff is friendly. It's a nice place to take your time and enjoy a meal. The food was good, but not incredible. There are limited options for vegetarians, but the options looked pretty good. I ordered the Egg White Crepe. It was different from what I thought it would be, but it was extremely light and fresh. The crepe itself was made of egg whites and tasted more of egg than crepe. It was paper thin and filled with shredded carrots, radishes and bunches of fresh herbs. The mint was especially nice in combination with the orange gastrique. I have to say that without the gastrique the herbs were the overpowering flavor and a bit simple. The sweetness of the gastrique helped to balance the flavors and created a more complex dish. What I loved about the dish was that it was really light, but still filling. I highly recommend finishing off the meal with some ice cream from Morgenstern's which is just around the corner, so there's no excuse not to.",3,,1
125,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",34,575,0,2.0,3/8/2018,"Native NYer, but for some reason I found myself here for the first time. There is a sort of lore around this restaurant - it's tucked away in an alley, the food pics generally look decadent, and people generally hype this place and love to hashtag it and gram it. The interiors are probably the best part of this place. It feels like you are somewhere suburban, in a cozy cabin where someone has taken the time and attention to decorate it with kitschy and beautiful taxidermy. The ambience ends there. Their menu is sort of random and haphazard. Not sure exactly what the influence is. The actual food that is delivered is simply not made with care and is completely unremarkable and slightly sub par. We sat at the bar with the bartender, and I'm sorry to say there was no magic to his personality either. Every question was answered with some sort of uncertainty, stutters, and general ambiguity. Sad to say that the mythicisim of Freemans has been shattered for me. OOTNO, I guess.",,,
126,Josh A.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,12,0,1.0,9/29/2018,"Used to love this place but not anymore. I love the food. But good luck getting a table here. First when I tried getting a reservation, they said they only do reservations a month in advance. Uh, ok... although I can get a reservation at any other restaurant in the city days advance, and have even gotten a table at Freemans days in advance, I let that slide. But that wasn't the worst part. They say on their recording that they leave a third of the tables open for walk-ins and it's first-come-first-serve. Ok, great. So I go there around 8pm and they tell me at the door that tables won't be available until 9 or 9:30. That's a wait, but I asked if I could wait at the bar and they said, ""Sure."" So I give them my name and they said, ""Oh, well you just have to come back to the door and ask if a table is free at 9.""  WHAT?  So I'm already in the restaurant, they say it's first come first serve, I'm waiting for a table, but I can't put my name in and wait for them to call me? This is absurd. No other restaurant in the city does this. I don't know whose genius idea this is, but it was a major turnoff and I've decided I'm not eating here anymore if it's going to be this hard to get a table. What was worse was the host had a snobby attitude. I don't care if the food is good, they are snobby and don't want my money, so eff them.",,,

131,Jay C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,32,5,3.0,7/21/2018,"What we loved about Freeman was the setting, service and presentationWhat fun to walk in through Freeman Alley with its inventive wall art - made to look street style - definitely ready for Instagram!  The upstairs tables are great for conversation with a heavily wooded decor that gives a farmhouse feel. Downstairs is more festive.  One of our party felt he would like to come to that upstairs during a snowstorm to look out the windows.  The service was excellent.  Attentive without being intrusive.  A few servers were taking care of us.  The food looked lovely.  The apps were very attractive looking.  The charcuterie plate was on a board.  We loved the cooked sausage that went well with the mustard it was on top of.  We didn't eat the fatty cold cuts (don't know the proper term).  We should have known. Just not attractive to us.  The bread that comes with it is great.  We liked the artichoke dip with baguette slices.  That was good.  The mushroom donut app had a good citrus dip.  I can't comment on the pureed mushroom that came with it as I am not a mushroom person.  The hot pepper app was good (don't have the name).The trout, salad and corn succotash was highly salted to the degree that that was the predominant taste of those dishes.  You could tell that it was high quality salt, but still it killed any flavor, and left a salt taste in the mouth for hours.  This is what brought our rating so low.  The side dishes, the one I had, corn succotash was probably the best value of what we had.  On the menu, sides looked overpriced at $10, but the portions were big and could be a meal in themselves.  The entrees were high priced in that they offered nothing else but the fish or meat.  All salads and sides are extra. Since then we have eaten at a few places where the food was much better and the bill was half to one third of what we paid at Freeman's.We ate a lot of bread, which was very good, but really to fill ourselves for the dishes were not filling . We had a good time at a table where we could sit and talk.",,,

Single. Thing. Took. Forever.My friend was ready for a drink and we had to wait 15mins to order it because the bartender was busy. We were ready to order food and it took 20mins to get our order in because he was busy. We were ready to get our mains and again it took forever to get our apps cleared (btw that artichoke dip is overrated and at least ours came lukewarm and the bread was not toasted and cold). Then we were ready to be OUT of there and -you guessed it right- it took FOREVER to get our payment processed. While we were being patient and understanding at some point this whole ordeal became an agony - it truly doesn't have to be *that* difficult to get your check settled. I don't know if they need a second bartender or barback servicing that bar or streamlining their process some other way but this was not acceptable and really became super annoying. The food was good - the fillet mignon and fish of the day- but not good enough to make this service tolerable. The prices warrant better -and faster- service to be expected.,2,2,2

As for the food the menu has been updated with different selections and  prices from past reviews on here. If I'm honest the food itself wasn't 'out of this world' especially considering the prices were more than expected, hence only receiving 3 stars.

The restaurant always intrigued me because of the cutesy alley and the amazing reviews on Yelp. On a whim, my boyfriend and I settled on Freemans for a late brunch one weekend.I've heard about the extremely long wait at Freemans and was prepared for such when we arrived. Imagine my shock when we were seated right away!The interior is highly curated with animal skulls/antlers, dim lighting, small wooden tables and an overall 1930s saloon vibe. It was nice and I was immediately taken by the surroundings.We ordered the macaroni and cheese, and shakshuka. We also ordered a few cocktails, namely the Kings Coin, and the Royal Diamond.The food was sorta unimpressive. I really wanted to like Freeman's and between the menu options (which felt limited) to the actual dishes, I just wasn't into it.

Unlike many other brighter (or say it in other word, modern) places, Freeman's was definitely on the old-fashioned side - paintings with dust, animal sculptures, plants, whatever you could think of was everywhere!Talking about food, I was surprisingly a bit disappointed, probably because I've given high expectations for so long and it somehow failed to impress me. Opted for the poached egg with grilled asparagus and butter toast. The poached egg was cooked perfectly well, with the egg yolk having the fluid texture and made the perfect combo with my toast. Sadly the asparagus was pretty bland...My friend got the granola bowl with assorted fruits. Probably the meaty dishes could be better?

Updated review",My reviews are generally pretty generous with the stars because maybe I'm easy to please. But Freeman's unfortunately falls to a two star review. Let me start by saying I can see the appeal of the restaurant. It's down an alleyway with great graffiti art and the restaurant has a hunting cabin kind of feel to it. A lot of taxidermy animals and antlers on the wooden walls. The restaurant has great charm. The day I went luckily it wasn't too busy however I've know the wait to be 30-45 minutes during brunch. The brunch menu was below average. Overpriced for the amount of food served. No bottomless option which should be a NYC standard. I personally had the freeman burger which was served with fries. Nothing special. Neither were the eggs Benedict and omelette which the other two people in my party. We had two of the specialty cocktails which were fine unique flavors but nothing that can't be replicated at another restaurant. The cost for this basic brunch was a whopping $110 before tip. Overall would not recommend this brunch location for the high cost of average food and probable long wait.,1,1,
142,Christine G.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,51,67,3.0,11/6/2017,"I don't understand the hype over this place, maybe it's because of its unique hidden location. I had the shakshouka. It was nothing special (toast was burnt) and slightly overpriced to say the least for such a mediocre tasting dish. Maybe the other dishes they have are worth trying, but if you asked me if I were to ever go to this place again for brunch, then I'd pass.",,1,
143,Riah K.,"Washington, DC",229,89,155,4.0,11/12/2016,"This was one of the best brunch places I've been to in Manhattan. The food tastes so great, the interior decor is lovely, there is plenty of seating, and it is not loud at all. I went around 10:30 on a Saturday morning and there was barely a wait. However, they did require my entire party to arrive before they could seat me. My friends came about 15 min later and within those 15 minutes the entire restaurant was packed!! So I definitely advise people to come from 10-10:30am to minimize the waiting time. However, if you are waiting, you can sit at the bar and enjoy a coffee or cocktail until your table is ready. I loved the pumpkin pancakes ($14) and the egg shakshuka ($14). There are free coffee refills, so you can sit and drink as much coffee as you want! I'm taking off a star because there was one rude waiter who took one of our plates before we were finished (without even asking if we were done eating). I think because this place gets packed for brunch, they try to rush people out. I think this is so rude and unprofessional.. like let me eat my food at my own timing you know? Everyone else was very kind and polite, but that one waiter just ruined it for me.",,,

147,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,4.0,5/18/2016,"5+++ stars for ambiance, mood and romance. This is worth the walk down the only alley in NYC. A cheerfully bright blue door and dreamy lights on a string greet you. The interior is just as dreamy, albeit a bit strange with stuffed animal heads hanging on the wall. But hey. It oozes charm and I like it.My friend and I snagged seats at the bar on an early Friday evening. The bartender looked just like Freddie Mercury. I asked Freddie what I should drink and he recommended the French 75 - plymouth Gin, lemon, simple syrup, champagne float - it was a little too citrusy for me - don't always listen to what Freddie says. My second attempt at a cocktail was wonderful and warmed me up all over - El Bandito (chipotle mescal, bourbon, orange bitters, whiskey barrel bitters, demerrera syrup). I was feeling good. We had the famous artichoke dip to munch on and it was good. There's a private room in back should you want to reserve it for a small party. Reservations for large parties only, otherwise expect a wait. Bring your date or bff. I'll have to come back to actually try the food, which could push up my rating to 5 stars.

148,Sophie P.,"Boston, MA",1017,406,1692,3.0,5/11/2016,"Expect a 1.5 hour wait in the LES alley on a Sunday afternoon for a spot at Freeman's brunch! We were seated upstairs, which has a rustic private dining room feel to it. In a table of 5, there were two parties that sat across long wooden tables, with guests seated on the ends of the table. This made it hard for waiters and guests to walk through, since there wasn't much room behind the seat. ~ HOT ARTICHOKE DIP ($15) // For a $15 appetizer, this is definitely very small. It comes out piping hot with plenty of crisp bread that may cut the roof of your mouth at times! Between 5 people, we were able to have 2-3 pieces of bread with dip.~ BAKED SKILLET EGGS SHAKSHUKA ($14) // This entree was more worth the price, which came in a hot skillet with two poached eggs, spinach, tomato bell pepper sauce, and toast. Although very flavorful, I found the shakshuka to be somewhat dry. The consensus at the table was that the poached egg quality varied a lot across entrees. Some were poached well, while others were overcooked without a runny yolk. Also, our waiter took care of us and was sure to refill our waters, but was pretty much nonexistent for the rest of the meal. Overall, I think Freeman's is pretty mediocre for brunch while being a little bit pricy for the quality of food and wait time.",8,4,7

I was right in that it was pretty empty so if you can I recommend going on a weekday. They have a great wine/cocktail selection and that seems to be one of the stronger parts of the restaurant. The decor is also really fun, and its nice to walk through an alley filled with cool street art to get to the restaurant, adds to the experience in a pleasant way. The food itself was what really disappointed me and my friend. We started with the devils on horseback, which is a dish usually composed of a dried fruit (in this case dates) stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. My friend and I found them way too rich, after taking a bite we both felt a little sick honestly. I had also ordered the mushroom grits, which while beautifully presented I found the grits to be a very strange texture, hard but soupy at the same time almost like they had not been cooked for long enough. The mushrooms in the dish were plentiful and cooked perfectly but couldn't really make up for the underwhelming grits. My friend got the omelet off the brunch menu. She said the cheese in it tasted very off and really only ate the side salad that accompanied it. Overall for a pricer meal it was quite disappointing, but something makes me not want to give up on Freemans.",,,

But it really doesn't make up for everything else. I came here with a party of 6 for my boyfriend's sister's birthday. We all entered with high hopes and excitement and left downtrodden, sad, and still hungry. I'm a vegetarian (which I told the waiter) and I ordered a side of Brussels sprouts and a soup. The soup was extremely spicy, me and two others ordered it and sent all three back. The waiter asked if I'd like anything else instead of the soup and I chose the mixed green salad. My Brussels sprouts arrived on the same bloody piece of wood that the steak for the table came on. I don't think of myself as too picky of a vegetarian, but I would prefer my vegetables not to be soaking in blood. The steak was sent back because it was too bloody, go figure, and my brussel sprouts went with it. The waiter asked if I'd like my Brussel sprouts to be on a separate plate when they came back and I said 'yes please' and that didn't happen. The steak and bloody brussel sprouts arrived before my 'mixed green salad' ( which turned out to be a pile of 19 leaves lightly dressed). The brussel sprouts portion of the bloody meat plate was way across the table from me so I had to stand up and eat one sprout at a time being that I didn't have a plate. And then my 'salad' came to top off the escalating disappointments. This meal was $510 dollars without tip. FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS for undercooked meat, over spiced soup, bloody brussel sprouts, 19 lettuce leaves, and 6 disappointed people.

Came for brunch on a Saturday around noon and the wait was about 20 minutes for 2 people. This is weird cause inside there is so much space and so many empty tables and even an upstairs that I didn't see (maybe the space bigger than the kitchen can handle?)Inside, the space feels like something you'd find in a countryside cabin. It's not just the rustic wooden tables but the way the walls are decorated with taxidermy and the division of space into separate rooms. I got the shakshuka and it was good - eggs runny and flavor balanced.My friend got the pork sandwich and loved it.Service is attentive and friendly. This place is good but a bit talked up.",,,

We came for a Monday lunch. unfortunately they don't have the baked dish for lunch (only for brunch). They do not have much vegetarian options. We had an egg white omelette, which was not bad. I enjoyed the salad more, something like pea shoots. The pancake was fluffy, though I don't like the apple sauce on top of it. So overall the food is good, but I really don't feel that we were welcome in the place. Everything feels so cold.",1,1,1

The place isn't really obviously marked, and you have to walk through this alley to get to the entrance (giving off vague speakeasy vibes). The inside of the restaurant is really cool. An eclectic mix of old portraits of random people and taxidermied animal heads line the walls. The overall interior was decorated in such a way that it seemed like this place used to be some sort of old house. Our server was really nice and prompt, always checking to see if we had enough coffee or water. My boyfriend and I split the hot artichoke dip, and I really liked the dip and the little bread slices it came with! I ordered the burger, and it was really delicious.

Updated review",Disappointed in my recent visit. The service was inattentive and slow. I was seated upstairs this time and I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it? And the food. I ordered exactly what I had last time.... The skillet eggs. I didn't like the fact that my eggs were overcooked. There wasn't cheese on top like last time. And barely any bacon and spinach inside the dish. I didn't even finish my artichoke dip. I paid and left with more than half my food untouched. What happened....,3,1,2
172,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,3.0,1/6/2017,"Pretty mediocre foodI will start with the good. The restaurant has a very cozy, lodge vibe feel to it. Freemans feels like a place that is perfect for a first date or a intimate meeting with some friends. The restaurant is fairly large, so accommodating a large party should not be too much of a problem. The service on 01/05/17 was pretty good, because the waiter was very friendly and attentive.  Plus, the food was prepared and came oit fairly quick. On to the food. Ok, so the food is not bad but the price point, for the quality, is overpriced. I split an order of the 5 cheese macaroni (18 bucks), Brussel sprouts ($???), and the mussels ($22). For the price of the mac n cheese, I was expecting something amazing but it was really disappointing and mediocre. The dish was pretty bland and fairly small for the price, as an appetizer. For that price, it should have been an entree. The mussels were very old and several people in our party had digestive issues after dinner. The mussels were the one thing that we all had in common. At least, the broth for the mussels was good. The Brussel sprouts, a pretty difficult dish to screw up, was the only redeeming plate that we shared. I would come here for pre- or postdinner cocktails and skip the food.",3,,

174,Christine C.,"Torrance, CA",559,272,576,5.0,2/1/2016,"Just wonderful! I visited the place for brunch on Sunday morning and it was pretty busy, so the wait was about 30 minutes, which isn't bad in my opinion especially coming from LA. Everything beginning from the location as its nestled in a small alley to the ambience and décor is super cute and hipster! I can imagine coming at night for a drink is just as amazing! Highlights: - Skillet Eggs with Grits/Bacon/Cheese - ordered this as everyone seems to be getting this here and it was delicious! I do wish/prefer the eggs to be sunny side up, so I could crack the yolk and have it melt all over everything, but it was still really good!- Poached Eggs with Cheddar Grits/Collared Greens - I think this was actually my favorite! The cheddar grits with the butter and poached eggs just melts in your mouth! Given that its super buttery and heavy, the collared greens definitely help to balance out the dish! I would definitely get this again! Overall, just a cute and amazing little brunch place in a wonderful area! I can't wait to visit this place again!",2,2,2
175,Alice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",107,201,1000,2.0,2/29/2016,"I decided to have breakfast here one cold early morning. I had high expectations for this restaurant. However, I did not feel it meet my expectations.The atmosphere is pretty chill and literally CHILL. The day I came was pretty chilly outside. I was expecting to be warm in this restaurant. Nope, didn't get that at all. I sat there with my lover slightly trembling while we wait for our food. I had the skillet eggs shashuka. The skillet includes bacon, cheese, spinach, and some tomato like sauce, with 2 slices of bread on the side. Everything tasted bland. Even when i mixed it together it wasn't very flavorful. My first bite was without mixing all the components in skillet. I tasted it individually to taste the flavor of each. My second bite was with everything mixed. The tomato-like sauce was underneath was not to my liking at all. Personally, it just wasn't to my liking. The 2 slices of bread on the side was so difficult to eat. It was like a piece of wood. It was too hard. It really did hurt my mouth. I tried to place the skillet's components on it to soften it, but that hardly made a difference.I also tried the smoked trout. That was nothing special.The eggs were extremely bland. I tasted absolutely no seasoning. Apparently there were bones in the trout..",2,,
176,Aravind A.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",289,3,6,3.0,5/21/2017,"Food - 3/5Service - 4/5Wait - 4/5Decor - 5/5Value - 3/5Decided to go here for brunch with a few friends. We were expecting a long wait from the reviews here but we went at 12:30pm on a Sunday and were immediately seated which was a pleasant surprise. It may have been an illusion however because once we ordered the wait for the food was pushing it towards over 30 minutes. The place in our opinion wasn't busy enough for that to be expected.Regardless, the selection of food was questionable. I am a vegetarian and they did not have more than 2/3 dishes that accommodated that. This is mainly because some vegetarian dishes had an asterisk stating ""This dish may contain bacon, meat, etc...."". This may have definitely skewed my review of the food. I ended up getting the Five Cheese Macaroni and was satisfied with the dish. It was creamy, and cheesy with just the right amount of crunch. Thus overall, my 3/5 is based more upon the options than the quality of the food itself. I personally found the value not optimal however as the portion sizes were not that large. My friends ordered the Poached Eggs, Cheeseburger, and the Shakshuka and all raved about the food. The shakshuka in particular was certified tastey by a Tunisian! The vibe and the decor of the place is great. Great place with an eclectic choice of decorations.I would not necessarily come back here any time soon due to mainly the selection issue, but would recommend it to others!",,,
177,Danielle M.,"Jersey City, NJ",55,91,237,4.0,2/28/2017,"I think the ambience and allure of Freemans is superior to the food, but the food is pretty good and it's a pretty cool place!Freemans is off of Freeman Aly in its own little alcove, and the alleyway has cool graffiti. Inside the restaurant is kind of like a hunting lodge with all the taxidermied heads. I had the bacon and egg biscuit, which came with a hashbrown and pickle. I was surprised that I didn't love the biscuit. It was pretty dry to me. I loved the bacon, though, and the hashbrown. The hashbrown was super thick but not oily. My cousin ordered the shakshuka and gave me some, and I think the shakshuka was the real star of brunch. I think it came with egg, feta cheese, spinach, and tomato-bell pepper sauce. Everything went together really well and it was delicious! I wish I had ordered it! Not sure if I would come back, unless it were to show an out-of-town guest some cool brunch spots. I would recommend Freemans to people who love unique restaurants, since there are definitely not many like this place around.",,,

Next time, I will ask to see if my eggs can come a little less cooked, that way they can be a little runny - avoiding the dry parts that came in my plate. That would've been the best. Other than that slight complaint, and that it is very crowded, specially if you're trying to wait for the bathroom where you find yourself constantly in the way of the servers, the food was really good and the service was quick - not the friendliest, but nevertheless it was a nice experience in a very nicely decorated place.

The potatoes were super crispy... Definitely would recommend this as well. However, service was bad. Hostess and bartender were nice, but our waitress was a little miffed every time we asked for water or ketchup, like we were bothering them... It was also really hard to get their attention they avoided eye contact (probably because I suspected she started to not like us).

It's more well-known for brunch and its décor that reminds you of a classic American tavern. I recently visited for a customized birthday dinner where all the menus were set in advance other than different options for entrees.The food at Freemans will not wow you in creativity department, with a lot of classic, simple dishes some of which were quite nice while others were so-so. I really enjoyed the artichoke dip that you can dip with crisp bread. It looks simple but the flavor was rich and delightful. Grilled cheddar toast was also quite solid. For entrée, I chose grilled brook trout with thyme, garlic and lemon. The fish was nicely cooked, but the seasoning was somewhat uneven. There is an assortment of desserts that are serviceable if not predictable, from banana with vanilla ice cream to chocolate brownie.I did like the vibe of the restaurant a lot, with a nice mix of classic and modern décor and setting. The place was absolutely packed with people on a Friday night, so I assume getting a reservation could be an issue if not booked in advance (I didn't make the reservation this time). There seems to be a large collection of wines and cocktails you can choose from.
