0,Peter K.,"New York, NY",77,1077,48,5.0,11/6/2018,"The legendary Walker's has been around since 1885! It is mainly a pub, the front entrance from the corner comes into the main bar area with some seating. But it looks like it expanded over the years buying out the neighboring spaces punching doors through and expanding seating for more of a restaurant area. Very cool old-time atmosphere, seems very original to the 1800's. And the food was outstanding! I wasn't expecting that level of food quality for being mainly a pub. Great place to eat or drink, and great piece of history!",,,
1,Ross H.,"New York, NY",347,106,436,3.0,11/7/2017,"Came to Walkers for lunch. It has a pub feel but is a restaurant at heart, and has a lot of space of seating. I got the Turkey club. It comes with coleslaw, and an option of potato.Potato options are either mash, fries, or chips if i recall. I went with the fries. The fries were very good. They were skinny and crunchy, and they gave a large portion. My Turkey club came with an option of bread, I went with pumpernickel.The Turkey Club was solid, defiantly a good size. The Turkey was not dry which is great as sometimes fresh turkey comes dry. They charged $2 for a side of honey mustard.I saw french onion soup go by that looked great, if i come back I would for sure try that.",,,

Updated review","Not sure where I have been, but Walkers has a great brunch.  Each meal includes an adult beverage....what more do you need?",,,
3,Miguel V.,"Ontario, CA",60,42,5,5.0,10/6/2018,"Came in just for a quick drink. I have to say my drink of choice is always Long Island Iced tea. I have probably tried them at least at 25 different places and this, by far has been the best I've ever had.   Amazing .",,,
4,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,4.0,2/8/2018,"Old school joint that just serves the drinks and the burgers right and then sends you on your way.  No frills.  Not so much as smile for the most part.  But, you dont come to a tribeca staple for a smile.  You come for a cold Guiness a kick-ass burger and you get the hell on.  This place has what you need if what you need is meat and booze from a decent bartender who doesnt give a shit that you want a malibu pineapple.  If it aint a beer, wine, scotch or martini, you have ordered incorrectly...and thats ok with me.",1,1,
5,Edmund L.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,5.0,6/30/2018,"I only think about this place like twice a day when I crave a burger, fries and a Black and Tan.  Sometimes I eat the crayons.",,3,
6,Chuck C.,"Vernon, CT",101,228,4,3.0,5/29/2018,"The food was okay. Not great but not awful, either. I spent a few days in Tribeca on business, and, so, I sampled a few lunch options. Walker's was the only place I felt comfortable. The rest of the places seemed ultra-modern. The waitress here is absolutely wonderful. She's the best reason to come here, for sure, and, if I had to come back to the area, I would return for lunch.",2,,

Updated review","Updating my review after several good return visits to Walkers, they're great as a pub, just don't order the seafood!",,,
8,Jessica G.,"Bloomington, IN",1,27,2,5.0,5/29/2018,The absolute perfect place for me to have a meeting.  Staff.  Honestly some of the best I have ever experienced.  Kind.  Courteous.    Respectful.   And the salmon was delicious as well!,1,,
9,Brandon P.,"Patchogue, NY",80,7,0,5.0,7/6/2018,"Randomly stumbled upon this place. Not much fanfare, just a straightforward no BS bar with a traditional bar menu. Reasonable prices, great food, personable bartenders, and amazing history dating to the 1880's. Bar and shelves are all original which definitely adds a cool factor. Lots of complimentary starters were on the bar as well e.g. chips and salsa, tiny chicken sandwiches, etc. Don't let this hole in the wall fool you! Great place!",,,
10,Edward S.,"Seattle, WA",62,504,667,5.0,4/27/2017,"I am in town for the Tribeca film fest and we were asked to meet some people at Walker's.  We had been at premiere and it was late, but we were hungry.  We definitely met at the right place.This is a classic New York Italian restaurant and bar where the bartenders have worked here forever.The drinks are great, but the food was excellent.  We started with calimari and bruschetta.  The climate was lightly fried just right with a perfect coating and I loved the marinara dipping sauce.The bruschetta was tasty also, with nice fresh tomatoes and great bread.The star was the mussels.  They were nice and fresh and cooked just right.  Many times the seasoning overwhelms the mussels, but they did it just right.As a bonus, the interior of the restaurant has been used in shows like Public Morals.Walker's is definitely worth a visit!",,,
11,Nancy V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/22/2017,"I came here with a few friends a while back and I had a similar experience as the person below did. It's sad my first review has to be a bad one.Came with a group of friends that were mostly Hispanics/some Asians. And we were treated horribly by the owner. Gerald Walker (Jerry) I believe is his name because I asked one of the employees there. The man whose name is on the restaurant! Older gentleman with glasses and white hair.It took 15 min to get a waiter to ask us to get started on drinks, then another 15 min to be served those drinks. And our food took 25 minutes to get out. A total of 55 min of sitting around.Our food order came so late that I guess they thought we were there for longer than we should have been. I was on my 3rd barbecue wing and then I see the owner, Mr. Walker, come by and asked the group ""How much longer are you guys going to be because we've got people who want a table."" SERIOUSLY? I was literally on my 3rd wing and people were only half finished with their plates. We just said we'll hurry and finish and agreed to leave this disgusting place. We waited till everyone was totally done with their plates and yet again Mr. Walker comes over to our table and says ""When the FUCK are you guys going?Come on guys this is ridiculous""This guy was having a bad day or something because he was treating his employees like trash too and yelling at them for small things. Taking out his frustrations on complete strangers who are also PAYING customers is totally unacceptable.Even the owner himself treats you like garbage. Maybe they only like white customers? Whatever the case, this guy and some members of his team clearly have anger issues and we will never be coming back.",6,1,

Burger was so damn good. Fries were top notch. My tuna melt was just so great. Love the Selection of hot sauces & that they give out Free bar food. Great Food, great service. My new favorite spot in the neighborhood. Thanks John!!",,,
13,Nikki B.,"San Diego, CA",10,97,9,5.0,7/3/2017,"I come to town once a year or so and felt like coming to TriBeCa last evening. I found this restaurant/bar on Yelp. It had some low reviews, but reading all of them with a grain of salt really helped.  I came in last night, had not eaten all day, and they still still served food until 1am on a Sunday. I had just French onion soup, and it was warming and delicious.  I loved the dark bar and old skool wood scene, this place was inviting.  My bartender server Lynard (SP?) was one of the nicest people and such a great host I have to rave about him. He was informative to me as a tourist basically about cool spots, was a genuine person which I hold to heart, and made my experience that evening just wonderful. I'll be back and recommend!",1,,
14,Shelley L.,"New York, NY",95,448,1169,4.0,9/13/2015,"We were looking for a down and dirty quick lunch spot and stumbled upon Walkers. It looks like your typical bar spot but it's a spot that gets crowded quickly. We were seated, in an awkward spot, in between the paper roll they use to place on tables and two other dining tables. I got bumped numerous times from patrons going to the bathroom and waiter dropping off food for the tables. I squeezed in as close to the table, too! Besides that distraction, on to the food. We ordered fast (two sandwiches) and the food arrived just as quickly.Roasted turkey club - delightful. Lots of meat and bacon. Can't go wrong with that. Nicely toasted bread. Sandwich comes with fries - nice touch with the crispy fries. Not soggy at all.Grilled chicken breast sandwich - great for those looking to be healthy. Grilled and not dry! Comes with a unique wasabi aioli sauce. Husband loved this and dipped and spread it in everything on his plate. It was tasty!Good spot for a quite bite. Just be cautious on where you sit!",4,,1
15,Will F.,"Orlando, FL",44,55,17,4.0,7/14/2017,"I met up with my wife and fellow peers in her summer program at Walker's. I was worried that with 14 of us and during happy hour, it'd difficult to accommodate. Fortunately, they quickly arranged tables and had us seated in only a few minutes.I had the linguine pescadore, their daily pasta special, and it was fantastic. All the other members of our party were also complimentary of their dishes, and lauded my wife's choice for dinner.The only downside was that because we were a large party, managing the check was a bit troublesome. We expected it to be a challenge, so we worked with our server to divide the table into three groups. Awkwardly, though, she would take the orders of a group and then take it to the kitchen. She repeated that process five more times (drinks and meals). It led to our drinks and meals coming out at drastically different times. My group was trying to be polite and wait for the others' food, but our gesture ended up leading to our meals becoming cold.",,,
16,Jessica C.,"New York, NY",587,5,1,5.0,2/12/2018,"Unbelievable neighborhood spot. I live in Tribeca and believe this chicken is one of the best. Amazing roasted chicken and great vibe. All around good service at the bar and good people. Everyone was very chatty-you can tell this is a ""Cheers Bar"" feel but with much more quality food.",,,
17,Dana M.,"New York, NY",113,307,113,2.0,7/31/2016,"Perhaps I'm giving this fewer stars because I had very high expectations. But all my friends RAVED about this place. Great food, great service, cool atmosphere. It seemed like a MUST GO TO place. It's a bar with tables and tv with mediocre food... but the plus is that you get to draw on the table (YESS). I split chicken wings and a burger with fries. I think for the price it was pretty meh. The chicken wings were overcooked and the burger pretty bland. I guess considering the area, it's good to have because most places in Tribeca are pretty expensive and more family driven (perhaps I'm wrong?). But I was very unimpressed and probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here. For a quick desperate bite it's good and will get the job done.",1,1,
18,Leon T.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,6,0,1.0,4/26/2018,"THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY 15 YEARS OF LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY. I have eaten at 100s of restaurants of all calibers but have absolutely never had a terrible and rude experience that I had tonight.First off, came off the street because I saw they had a particular menu item advertised in the window. When I sat down to order that item, I was told they actually don't offer it for dinner only lunch. Not a big deal at all. These things happen. On the fly, the waitress asks what else I wanted. Standing there waiting, my eyes went to the burger which has multiple toppings listed next to it. I said ""sure I will take that but dont want all those toppings on it. If they come with the burger, please put them on the side"" the waitress then asked if I wanted cheese cause cheese was extra, I said sure. I then sit down and all the silverware is dirty and waitress does not come back till midway through meal which had me grab silverware and napkins from an empty table.  The burger was super undercooked but again this all isn't the worst part. All of this happens at time to time at restaurants.The worst part was when I got my bill and was charged $23 for a $15 burger. I expected it to be $16.50 with the $1.50 of cheese add on however it seems they charged me for each individual topping when i was very clear I didn't want these toppings to begin with and blatantly had no idea there was a charge. I then asked the waitress kindly if I can have those toppings removed from my bill as there was a clear misunderstanding, however the waitress refused as she said I already ate them (we are talking about mushrooms and onions etc for god sakes)!I then asked if I can kindly speak to a Manager and after 10 min, nobody arrived.Finally a Manager came and after explaining the situation kindly, the manager then started to yell at me. Literally yell and tell me it's impossible to take those off (we landed on the moon, I'm sure taking the $1.50 off for mushrooms on a burger is within the realm of possibility). He then said he would eat the cost himself then returned the bill back with only half the items taken off. He then told me I was nickel and diming them and made me feel cheap and undervalued. Literally something I have never experienced in a restaurant before! I then asked the waitress the Managers name and she said ""you can ask him yourself, now can't you?"" In history as a past waiter, I can literally never fathom stiffing a waitress and I ALMOST did but my conscience and my values kicked in and tipped her 20% sans the rest of what should have been taken off of my bill. My heart is still pounding fromThe most unnecessary rude humiliating restaurant experience in all of NYC. Avoid this place at all costs!",,1,
19,Emilee W.,"New York, NY",29,32,3,1.0,1/21/2017,"It pains me to write this but I feel obligated. Came here with a big group (10) tonight celebrating a friend's birthday. We were met with aggression from the moment we stepped inside. The horrendous bartender said, ""are you going to order a fucking drink or pray"" to us in lieu of a ""hello, how are you?"" He asked again to two girlfriends, ""are you ordering a fucking drink?"" And after they did, ""oh that's it??!!?"" not to mention the side eyes that we got for the entire ten minutes we stayed to let some of the people in our group finish their drinks. I've never felt so discriminated against anywhere in New York. None of the white patrons were getting this treatment. It's not something I encounter so blatantly in my face in this city. I live in this neighborhood. But I will never ever ever be back. That bartender needs a very serious attitude adjustment. There's no place for bigotry and hate in this city, in this country.",10,1,
20,Amy M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",103,227,512,4.0,8/12/2016,"Have been a patron of Walkers for more than a decade.  The food is consistent and the daily specials are always good. We stopped here for brunch on Saturday.  They start you off with a basket of mini lemon poppy seed muffins.  I ordered the French toast brunch which came with a choice of meat and a drink for $14.50.  Daughter had the bacon wrapped shrimp salad on top of arugula for $17.50. Both were delicious!  The french toast had a nice crunchy exterior and moist interior...very good.  The salad came with goat cheese and pickled onions...just delicious.  When I am in the area, Walkers is always a safe bet.",,,
21,Mia K.,"New York, NY",572,381,1805,3.0,3/10/2016,Decent bar with stiff drinks. The appetizers are average and pretty basic in taste. They are accommodating on groups and service moves pretty quickly. The atmosphere is a little loud but that's perfect if your group has volume and you have a few rounds of drinks. There are crayons and paper to entertain you at each table.,17,9,12
22,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",850,1051,1785,4.0,1/18/2016,"When in doubt, always choose Walker's. Walker's has always been my safe bet for lunch--and they have never disappointed. I always order their Grilled Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, which comes with cole slaw on the side (one of the better cole slaws I've had) and I always choose their house salad for the extra side it also comes with (isn't this such a winning meal?), which is a meal itself since it comes in a sizable container. I highly recommend a takeout/pick-up order since you can always save the side as a snack or for dinner, if you may. Portions are very generous for their lunch special, and the sandwich is always fresh, juicy, and flavorful with the goat cheese--the French bread is a bigger plus. I am not too familiar with its history, but you can tell just by looking at the interiors that this corner joint has been around long enough to become a TriBeCa staple. People dressed in suits frequent Walker's for business lunches instead of a luxurious restaurant, which tells you a lot about how great this place is. The service never disappoints and my order is always ready, no matter how much earlier I come to pick up, especially during the prime lunch hours. Has an old, rustic, Colonial feel that makes you feel sorry for wearing modern-aged clothes, and is more for the dining experience than for the drinking.",3,2,2
23,Field G.,"South Orange, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,5/12/2018,"This place is the quintessential NYC saloon/restaurant. The food is tasty and the waitress is wonderfully old New York! When I read some of the other reviews that actually said nasty things about her, I thought to myself ""those must be from out-of-towners!""  The service is spectacularly fast and the wait staff is exacting and professional. I had the steak on garlic croutons with fries and was more than satisfied!  Great flavor! To the naysayers, I say, ""Buck it up!  Perhaps your experience was a reflection of you, not your waitress!""",,,
24,Matt K.,"New York, NY",263,93,22,4.0,6/27/2016,"As someone who works in Tribeca, I have to say that Walker's does not disappoint.  To be fair, most of experiences I've had with Walker's were through lunch deliveries, but the food (which mostly consists of lite American style steaks, burgers, salads, and bar foods) is consistently on point.  That said, the expertly made Walker's Chopped Sirloin Steak with green peppercorn demi glace (priced at a mere $13.50) has to be one of the best lunch deals in Tribeca.The restaurant itself resembles a very casual, old school pub, with crayons on each table in the event you want to draw on the paper table cloths. The service is very quick, and the space tends to fill up with locals during peak hours of the day and during brunch.All in all, if you're looking for a cheaper alternative in pricey Tribeca without sacrificing quality of food or service, Walker's is your place",,,

26,Molly C.,"District of Columbia, DC",8,41,35,5.0,2/26/2017,Love this spot for brunch! Have been here several times and never disappointed. Went here for the first time on New Year's Day and had a great brunch in a fun neighborhood with no wait!,,,

Even though we came at an odd time- 4 pm, the service and food were great. It was a nice escape from the snow outside. Our server checked in with us often and my glass never went dry.

29,Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",929,198,126,5.0,1/3/2015,A hidden gem in Tribeca.. A local neighborhood pub right on the corner. The front seating is more lively where there is a bar of course. There are seatings in the back where it's more secluded & private. We sat in the back for a table of two. It was pretty busy for brunch but service was attentive. I had Eggs Benedict w/ Smoked Salmon. Delicious. & you can never go wrong w/ two cups mimosa's of course. Must try.,,,1
30,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,4.0,7/29/2015,"This bar and restaurant is super low key, with amazing food! I came here for lunch with a friend, and we were seated immediately in the back room (we were walked through the main dining room and the second room to the back...each room had plenty of table seating but also ample breathing room). Our server was incredibly friendly and came right over to our table to get the drink order. She was equally quick with taking our lunch order, and the food was prepared and delivered so that we were actually able to eat during a one-hour lunch break. I absolutely loved the French Dip with Au Jus ($14); the bread was perfectly toasted, the meat was so lean, and the dip and fries were the perfect sides! My friend really enjoyed her Grilled Portabello Mushroom sandwich, as well. Walker's has officially been added to the ""Lunchtime Restaurant Rotation.""",4,1,
31,Adam M.,"New York, NY",0,131,0,5.0,2/14/2018,"Walker's is a Tribeca institution. It's often looked over by many who don't understand its value. You can get a reasonably-priced drink and a very good meal here. There's no pretension and that's what's so special. It has been a hub of local Tribecans for generations. Enjoy the place, but keep it a secret so that hipsters don't ruin it. Also, leave any celebrities alone if you see them.",,,

33,Daniel M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",86,488,695,3.0,5/30/2015,"Odd bar / restaurant.  I order the burger which was very tender patty, moist on a sesame bun with pickles,lettuce and tomato. The food was great, tasty burger but when it comes to service, its a miss.When the server assigned us a table i had 3 different people servicing the table.  When the drinks came, i guess since we were not ordering alcohol, they did not check on us. Instead we had to flag down a server to get an additional glass of ice water.  Been here 2 times, the food is good but the service is always missing something.",,,
34,Bailey B.,"New York, NY",482,29,11,1.0,7/14/2017,"I popped into Walkers yesterday initially accompanied by two of my coworkers. I approached the bartender to let him know that we were coming from a company event that had just ended and that we were expecting to have 40 or 50 people come to join us soon...in fact they were all walking over from Pier 26. I asked if they could accommodate us and I wasn't told no. I asked to speak to the manager..who after staring me down - walked coldly over to my friends and I and the first words out of her mouth were - I am not moving my tables because I need to make money from them and she walked away. Ok fine. I could tell we were not wanted...oh I forgot to mention I am African American and the two young ladies who were with me, are as well. I wondered to myself if perhaps they thought it would be 40 -50 AA coming in..I cannot prove that - but that is very much what it felt like! . well whatever the case..I put down my card to cover my colleagues who started to trickle in...And I went for a walk...to find another place...too bad for you Walkers, you lost out on 5 thousand dollar profit last night...but no worries a neighboring bar was happy to get our business. You also missed the opportunity to create a relationship with a well known organization - see what you didnt know was - this perhaps ""undesirable"" (?) sits C-Level. I kindly redirected the CEO, The COO, THE CFO and the Gen Counsel as well as a host of EVPs right on down the block. Next time - you should be a bit kinder and I hope your owner reads this and gives you all a good lashing...you treated me very poorly and in returned missed easy profit and a chance of an ongoing relationship.

Old, worn wooden bar with a small sounded rail.  Box footrest.  The bar back is a little cluttered but great.  Traditional woodwork and large mirrors (rendered less useful due to bottles). Dimmer lighting.  Copper ceiling and large wooden planks floors. Three solid tvs. Opposite the bar are several lower eating tables with white clothes (out of place to me).  Food was good with daily specials.  Solid bartenders.

When the food comes out wrong, the servers argue how it isn't their fault things are wrong instead of just offering to correct the problem.  Piss poor for a place with servers that have been there since the beginning of time. In a neighborhood where there aren't a lot of reasonably priced options to eat, this Tribeca icon has found itself as another place with crappy food.   Do yourself a favor and avoid their brunch.",,,

Although I was a little disappointed in the additional toppings price-$1.25 for cheese. My companion had the chicken piccata which had a great lemon sauce.  Beer and wines were also ordered-a 20 oz Brooklyn lager for $8 is a good deal on a Saturday. Overall we will go back.,,,

Very comfortable atmosphere to chill and relax, full of locals and workers during lunch time rush.My medium-requested burger was way over-cooked. Black-crusted on the outside and dry on the inside. The lettuce, tomato, onion and blue cheese were fresh but couldn't mask the dryness of the flavor. The bun tasted stale too. The shoe-string-like fries were good but I came here for the burger.

43,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,3.0,4/18/2014,"OK place. The interior is really nice, as well as every waitress I've ever had.I ordered a burger with bacon, onions, and mushrooms, medium rare. It came out more medium, and I've read in other reviews that they tend to have a problem overcooking meat, so I'd say to ask for it a shade below what you really want it to be. Beyond that it was an alright burger, nothing amazing but not bad at all. The shoestring fries were similarly solid. Their omelets are done a little odd. The eggs are in omelet form, but all the vegetables are sort of tucked underneath and resting on the plate. The roasted potatoes they come with were underdone. My rum and coke was $9 and very strong. At around 3pm on a weekday they were playing soft rock/reggae, and when Smoke Two Joints came on I couldn't help but smile. It was a nice break from all the Tribeca nonsense if you're in the area and looking for something reasonably priced, but I wouldn't come back just for the food.",1,,

Perfect amount of spice, and perfect amount of crisp to tender meat ratio.-The burger here is also delicious. Mine was cooked to a perfect medium, juicy, tender and flavorful.

It is a good place to stop before or after you visited the Ghost Buster's Fire house. We were here for some quick bites and drinks. They have a long wine list and beer. We got the fries, fruit and yogurt and chicken fingers to share. The chicken fingers are great; they are tender, crispy and the mustard is spicy and sweet. I probably won't come all the way here to grab a drink but if I am back in Tribeca, I will definitely stop by.",1,,2

Food prices are cheaper than other places, but the quality is high. The cornmeal crusted oysters and grilled shrimp with home made tomatillo salsa are addictive. Specials change daily, and staples like the incredibly juicy and tasty Walker's burger and the pan roasted chicken are always great choices. On one occasion we had an incredible skirt steak sandwich that was just packed with flavor. Another time it was a brown pesto farfalle with shrimp. Waitstaff are friendly, efficient, and professional.",,,

The burger with it's char-broiled taste  is still solid - and I had it at midnight , not sure when they stop serving food but they're open till 4AM.  The servers were all very friendly to us and I'm happy to see that this place has kept its charm along with its local neighborhood crowd. I remember there being a mens room in the front area  - but it seems they moved them into the back area - which is also a nice area to sit if you want a bit of a quieter vibe away from the bar area. I'd describe the menu as comfort food with some healthy options. We didn't have any drinks but the old bar still looks cool as hell. This place is just classic New York all around.",,,
50,Rosie C.,"Hoboken, NJ",219,158,24,4.0,2/24/2015,"I had a really great time here for happy hour! There were no drink specials, but there was free food on the bar--woo hoo! On Friday, there was chips and salsa, turkey sandwiches, and chicken wings until 7. Unheard of in Manhattan!The bartenders and all the patrons were super friendly. I suppose you have to be because the space is so small and awkward that you can't help but accidentally elbow someone at some point. Overall, Walker's gives the impression of a small, friendly, local place that has been around forever and will be around forever. It's probably not a destination for me, but I would definitely return when in the area.",,1,
51,Pandora B.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",1,94,0,4.0,8/24/2016,"Walker's is one of my go-to spots in Tribeca when I want to meet friends in a clean, comfortable atmosphere, with good service, decent food and decent prices.  I can't say the food is excellent, but it is very good.  Walker's is a bar/restaurant and cuisine is not the focal point of its existence, although I imagine that on a weekday it's filled with lunch hour patrons who work in the neighborhood.  Weekend brunch is good.  On Saturday night it's noisy and busy.On Sunday night it's a lot quieter and there's low-key jazz in the back room, which can be very nice. If you come only for the food you MIGHT be disappointed, but if you come for the overall experience of eating and/or drinking and socializing, you can't go wrong.",,,

The time for drinks: great atmosphere, seems pretty busy at all times, and amazing service! We loved our waitress who was a super sweet Argentinean girl and was really fun to talk to. We each had a couple of drinks and it was a great place to talk with good friends. The time for food: we came here originally because of a recommendation from people on everyone's favorite 'dating' site, Tinder. A couple of my friends were talking to people on Tinder and they told them that we were staying in TriBeCa and looking for good fries and good food in the area, and Walkers came up twice. The food was pretty tasty and the fries were good, although I would hesitate to call them the best in TriBeCa ""Walkers was voted Best Fries in TriBeCa, 2014, by Tinder"" (a sign I think they should boast in their window)",,,

I had an omelet once for breakfast, the omelet was great but the greens they served with it were not fresh...which just spoiled the dish.... Beer:  No complaints there, acceptable menu.Other Notes: Crayons at the table and white paper table cloth make for a fun time.

Amazing burger done to my liking and the fries are one of the best I've had ever. Nice interior and lighting and art work. it was nice to get in from the cold and I sat in the back room instead of the bar area. It was still a bit chilly and it sucked when they seated loud children behind me when there were plenty other tables they could have put them. Mind you it did help make me feel a little less lonely !

The waitress was attentive and friendly. We were a party of five sat at a table for four and and they moved us to another table without much fuss. The Bloody Mary was not bad, the mimosa average. I ordered the Eggs Walker (eggs Benedict with smoked salmon) and it was really nothing special. The hollandaise sauce didn't taste of much. The leaves in the side salad was a bit wilted as well.",,,

The owner/bartender poured me a perfect guinness and was extremely friendly. The happy hour includes free finger foods that included chips, sandwiches, and quesadillas. Normally free bar food is gross, but all were high quality and tasty.UPDATEI was here at least three times this week, and the last time, when there were NO bar seats, I tried to take a basket of chips off the bar for my table.

I tried ordering three different beers (cider, a Heffeweizen, and a Six Point) and each time was told that they were out of that item. It's poor and kind of ridiculous to be out of three different beers on a Saturday night but I'm pretty low maintenance so I wouldn't have cared, except that our waitress was super cold and humorless and couldn't have given a shit less about informing me that they were out. It's almost like she was annoyed with me for ordering a beer that wasn't available - as if I should have known. I ordered a gin & tonic.Later we got the check and I asked if it could be split and I legit thought the waitress was going to hit me. All I did was ask, all you have to do is tell me that it's not possible.It's too bad because it has a historic, New England-stye atmosphere and I enjoyed the crowd that gathered, but the staff made it so that I'll never go back.",3,,

It didn't look like the type of place that would serve great food. But, thanks to my boss at my internship - NYAA, I got a chance to try it. My boss took me and another intern here for lunch to show her gratitude for all of our hard work! Well, my hard work was worth it because of Walker's!The decor does give you the idea that it has some interesting history behind it. Our server was nice. The food took a little bit longer than I expected though. But it was totally worth the wait! Can't say much for the appetizers because we didn't order any. I had the Walker's Chopped Sirloin Steak with green peppercorn demi glace, served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It was so good that I think my eyeballs almost came out of their sockets. The other intern, Gaspare, had the burger with fries. I tried his fries and they were pretty good. You see, I am a sauce girl and usually put sauce on everything. But I did not need any kind of sauce this time. That's how delicious my steak was! I would definitely come back to try their other dishes. Btw, did I mention that the prices are reasonable?! That's what makes this place even more awesome!! =D Thank you, Katie for taking us here!",3,,2

74,David L.,"New York, NY",78,26,7,5.0,8/2/2013,"I went here at around 10 pm and was gleefully welcomed by the staff. Didn't have to wait at all and took the table in the back of the bar with three others. The area was very clean and well ventilated with air conditioning. The lighting was dim and the main source of light was from a candle on the table.Once we were all seated our server, Gina, handed our menus to us and I mentioned to her about the $25 certificate from Restaurant.com. She jokingly exclaimed that she didn't believe in certificates, which took me by surprise and really brightened the mood for my group.Our group ordered the Buffalo wings, Pasta Primavera, and the Calamari. We also asked for four cups of water, which were promptly served to us in the biggest cups I had ever seen. The buffalo wings looked very appealing. I was craving for them for years (I don't usually eat wings) and tonight I was able to satiate my craving. The plate of wings costed about 11 dollars and had about 10 wings with ample amounts of carrots and celery with dip. Once I put the wing in my mouth and inhaled, I ended up with a coughing fit. I'm warning you all... breathe through your nose when you're about to put the wings in your mouth. In the end, I ate most of the wings because my group said that they were too spicy. I rate these wings 8/10. I don't usually eat wings so I don't know what to base my score on. I didn't think it was perfect because it was a bit dry, but it was delicious. We ended up ordering another plate of mild wings but the skin was still too spicy for my group.The pasta primavera was decorated with greens. I thought it would taste bland but ended up ordering another dish for my group. I really recommend this dish. It's 9/10 for me.The calamari wasn't anything special. I couldn't taste anything. There was tomato dipping sauce with it and even with that, it didn't taste as good as the wings. A 5/10 for me.Gina was an amazing server. She was on point with refilling our drinks and was available when we needed her. I told her that I would have rated this experience four stars but with her, it was definitely five stars.I don't usually eat out a lot but I will certainly be returning here. Even though we bought so much food, the total cost only added up to ~$38 with the $25 discount that I purchased for $6. Of course, I gave tips as if It were $63, so the total came up to $48. $54 dollars for four is practically a steal! Overall, I had a great time eating at Walker's.",3,1,1

About 5 min after we paid, BEFORE everyone finished their beers (mind you, a couple were almost full) the manager came over and asked us to ""move it along, as they are very busy and have a lot of people waiting"". Not only did he ask us to move along...he stood nearby and starred at us until we left.

They have 3 different rooms but they are all tiny. We were in the far back room with brick walls and about 6 tables. I ordered the pulled pork while others at the table had a burger, pasta primavera, and some sort of open face veggie sandwich. The portions were a good size. My pulled pork was flavorful and hot when it came to the table. Others seemed t enjoy what they ordered. I think everything was fairly priced for the area. Beers were expensive but really more than you would expect for the location as well. My mom work with a lot of lawyers in the area and told me this is a common lunch spot for them.

They have three (small) dining rooms, in the front by the bar, as second small dining room behind the bar and a third tucked away in the back. Walkers has a decent menu selection covering everything from salads and steak to chicken and fish.  I started with a bowl of Chili ($8), it's a lot of chili, and the bowl is large. The comes with a few packs of saltine crackers and a dollop of sour cream in the middle. It's on the mild side so you need to ask the wait staff for the hananero sauce to kick it up if you like. I love it hot.For the main course I ordered the Chopped Sirloin Steak ($12.75) which comes with a green peppercorn demi glace and is served with mashed potatoes (freshly mashed) and string beans. The meat was served medium rare and was very tasty. The peppercorns can be a little overwhelming so you can ask the wait staff to hold off the on them if you like. They have a decent selection of draft beer for $7.50 a glass including (Lagunitas IPA , Guiness, Brooklyn Lager, and Southampton) and a pretty good wine list too ($8-10 a glass).Thumbs up from me. This is a good option for lunch if you are in the area.",1,1,1

104,Brian S.,"Wall, NJ",175,503,322,2.0,8/7/2010,For a slice of history go to this 135 year old bar in it's original form and condition.  Neat to say the least.  This is strictly a beer and spirits drinker place.  No wine selection and those little wine glasses without stems are for crap.  Typical new york bar experience in that if you are a regular you get fawned over and if you are not you get ignored.Crappy food management because they stop serving lunch at 4 PM and do not server dinner until 6 PM.  So for two hours you fall into a black hole and can only order a few bar sandwich selections.On the bright side they do put out some nice happy hour food at 4 PM.  However we did not drive from the Jersey shore for happy hour food. We went here hoping to find the holly grail of NYC bars but unfortunately it is not here at Walkers.Not a bad experience mind you but not worth the trip up from the Jersey shore...,1,,

It has a friendly pub-like vibe and the food is actually some of the better gastro-pub offerings around without breaking the bank and without trying to be too precious, The burgers here are pretty damn good and are probably what will bring us back. The sandwiches are good too but if it's a burger you want, this is probably the best bet in Tribeca by a long shot, The front room with the nicely appointed bar can be a bit noisy but the two back rooms are quiet and quieter, respectively, Efficient, helpful and dare we say, friendly, waitstaff make dining here a pleasure.",,,

My friend had ordered a lemonade and then asked if that could be included as the complimentary beverage and was told ""NO"".I ordered an omelette that came with a side salad and bacon. The omelette and salad were pretty good (though it's hard to mess up either of those). The bacon was bizarre. it had no taste whatsoever. Both my friend and I tried it and both agreed it was bland and tasteless. Weirdest bacon I have ever tasted and I didn't eat it after that because of it, which was wasteful.",1,,

This place is surprising good. As soon as you walk in you are intoxicated by the smell of their fries. I should state this isn't just a burger place, they do have a full menu, I was just there for the burger. The burgers are probably half pound and nicely cooked. The curly fries are also quite good. I ate my entire burger, all my fries, and had about half of my dates burger. It was so good, my stomach forgot it had an off switch.I almost forgot!!

114,Susan S.,"Minneapolis, MN",33,209,19,4.0,11/1/2011,"Exactly what we wanted....a quaint pub that wasn't touristy serving decent chow.We ate from the afternoon/happy hour menu since the dinner menu wasn't available for 20 more minutes at 6 pm.  Burgers were great---the kitchen was confident enough in the quality of its ground beef to cook an authentic medium burger instead of sending out an overdone hockey puck.  Grilled onions and cheddar were perfect toppings.  Each of us chose a different potato, either baked, french fried, or mashed.  Loved having a fluffy baked potato served with decadent sour cream as a change of pace.  My friend and her husband left not a scrap of mashed potato behind.Service was a little uneven.  The waitress who took our order must have finished her shift, for we never saw her in the restaurant again (with nary a good bye.)  The replacement was pleasant, once we figured out that she was our go-to girl.  It  took a long time to get the check, which wasn't too much of a problem since we weren't in a terrible hurry.Loved the ambiance---a combination of the drinks after work crowd, couples dining, and even a family with little ones.  I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip from cross town, but I recommend Walkers if you're in the area.",2,,

We also had an avocado with crab salad appetizer which had wonderful flavor.  The crab was lite and flaky, and it was also very good.  They also have a decent and broad wine by the glass list, for a place that is more of a pub.  The portions seemed large, so if you aren't starving or looking to take leftovers maybe get a bunch of things to share.",,,

He thinks he's some kind of Jack Nicholson-meets-Christopher Walken...too cool for school and certainly too cool to take our order politely. What a smug attitude! You might be wondering if I was rude to him to deserve this treatment. The answer is no, we could not have been more polite. Hey dude, guess what, you're in the service industry!

119,Ashley M.,"Portland, OR",0,14,0,4.0,12/19/2011,"My boyfriend introduced me to Walkers once I started eating meat again.  I remember that the one thing I really craved over every other carnivorous treat was a really good burger.  Walkers was a great place to go to pop my NYC burger cherry.The environment is cozy and relaxed.  Although I am sometimes annoyed by the Jersey Shore bitches and obnoxious frat boy types that seem to congregate in any place with a wooden bar and access to the game, listening to their caveman-speak was a small price to pay for a good hearty meal.  This is great place to have a casual dinner with a pint and watch the game.  There's also a back room away from the bar for a more traditional dining atmosphere.The service is decent, not great, although the girls that work there are usually very nice.  I'm also a total geek for the cheesy glasses of crayons that are left on the tables so that you can decorate your own disposable tablecloths.  When you order a side, it's seriously a toss up between the mashed potatoes and the french fries, (although I prefer the mash).  They cook perfectly to order and have a solid shell steak dish as well if you're not in the mood for a burger.  Also, I would HIGHLY recommend the portobello and goat cheese sandwich for any vegetarians out there -best one I've ever had!  Definitely a cool ""regular"" spot in a classic NYC neighborhood.",1,1,
120,Jorge G.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,636,246,4.0,7/17/2012,"One of the best restaurants in Tribeca; and that is fairly high praise because its got a lot of competition. This place is generally attitude-free, snooty-free. Unusual for the neighborhood. Its done in 'pub-style' rather than wannabe 'Parisian street cafe'. Food is hearty and thoughtful.Waiters wear starched white shirts and black ties; and there's one 'older-guy' bartender sometimes there who really knows his Scotches and can advise you and instruct you in the discipline.Lots of politicos from the nearby City Hall attend this place; surprising because its not that expensive at all. The initial (bar) room where you first step in can be rather loud and crowded--so for a nice meal just move to the dining area. Service will remain high even in the busiest rushes.

We shared a nice bottle of wine and doodled on the table-cloths.  As I mentioned before, I love the vibe in this place and there are all sorts of different types dining here: business people, unemployed librarians, more families than I remember seeing in the past.

Chicken fingers were crispy too, and well seasoned!It was a really nice spring day, and we sat outside for a while-- a super fun area to people-watch.  Later, we migrated inside to the bar, which was cozy and old-school.  Loved it!Also it's in the movie ""New York I Love You""!",1,,2

The bartenders were nothing about courteous and warm. Drinks and food were ordered and served promptly and kindly. I had a burger w/ mushrooms/onions/cheddar, my friend had wings and the other had penne, and we all enjoyed our meals. Wasn't the most amazing burger I've ever had, but as far as pub fare goes, very good enough.Standard prices for beers, slightly cheaper for food, relative to the area (My large burger and generous helping of fries w/ pickle was $12.95.)The 5 stars are not for the food, however. They're for the whole package. To me, a good pub is clean and friendly place with decent food and a staff that minds the bar and its business, while offering up a chat every once in a while.

Definitely a bastion for the unpretentious and laid back in the neighborhood of tribeca. Tin ceil tiles and old timey decor give this place a great relaxed ambiance. The food was slightly above par pub grub with a few standouts. Upon our server's recommendation, we had the fried oysters (excellent - tender, crisp cornmeal batter, amazing spicy dipping sauce), french onion soup (a bit sweet but would definitely order again), and a mixture of mains and desserts. The sirloin burger was ok (may e bit dry) but great value for $11. The steak sandwich was open faced on garlic crotini and my friend said it was excellent. Chicken burger was ok and the shrimp orzo special was also pretty good. Deserts were about average except for the chocolate peanut butter mousse which was DELICIOUS! (and HUGE but delicious!). Service was excellent - attentive and friendly  but not too in your face. A great place to go and have a bite and catch up with some friends.

139,Ryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,2.0,2/22/2013,"I hate to be the guy who has a bad experience at a place and yelps about it.  But my last visit for lunch was unsettling. Long story long, me and 5 friends got lunch and a couple beers on a Friday afternoon.  Good food, good friends.  An honest or 5 or 10 minutes after check was paid, manager says he ""loves having us there"", but that ""other people need seats'.  We didn't even know who this high strung man was at first, much less why he was talking to us.  There was no introduction.  He said all that and then walked away.  I'm not easily insulted.  New York is a diverse place, there are a lot of cultures and values suspended together and dancing, it's great.  But this was really pretty insulting.  Demoralizing, even.I've been to Walkers a few times, the food is good, the place is classy.  If you're an ""Eat and Get the Hell Out"" type, you'll probably love it.  Enjoy.  You won't see me there again.",2,,
140,S. A.,"Washington, DC",0,8,0,3.0,4/18/2013,"I was a little torn on how to rate this review. Walkers is a good place for drinks and the majority of their foods is very good for the price you're paying. At other times I was here, I've had the Tuna Nicoise salad and I could tell the fish steak was good quality. Also, the spinach salad with goat cheese and mushroom is definitely a go for me. Once I tried their chicken tenders and the breading was just out of this planet!So why the 3 starts?Well I feel that I should send a message that could possibly stand out for those looking for what NOT to eat.Today I had a special of the night: Pan Roasted Grouper with Portabella mushrooms. The dish tasted very good! And this is where the catch about this review is.The dish was small. The plate was one quarter 3 inches grouper filet, another one eight was mushrooms and 4 potatoes halves. I could see almost half of the bottom of the plate. It made them look cheap.The dish itself I think is about $18. When you can see almost half of the bottom of your plate then your pocket may feel a little fooled.I was very surprised to see a plate that half-empty or half-full (depending if your an optimist or pessimist) when all the other times I've been at Walkers I'd always get a well served portion. Disappointed? Not really.Maybe it's just a matter of re-thinking the concept of the dish.",1,1,

You know the drill: high ceilings, background ballgames, patrons from all walks of life. You'll feel cozy right away.  The food is short of fabulous but does the trick. It's everything you'd expect from a pub menu --- salads, burgers, sandwiches --- with nice additions, like warm herb goat cheese bruschetta and a grilled yellowfin tuna wrap. I recommend both.As Barbara C. points out, the paper tablecloths and crayons are a neat touch, and come in handy for chronic doodlers. (I've even witnessed a CEO mapping out sales territories with a pink Crayola --- definitely not an everyday occurrence.) Expect a business crowd at lunch, a younger vibe in the evening.",3,2,3

Bypass the bar/first room and ask for a table in the back. Much more quiet and conducive to conversation. The burgers are to die for and I really like the pasta primavera.The atmosphere is delightfully unpretentious, and they even have live jazz music on Sunday nights in the back room.

I walked by it once and was musing aloud with my friend about it and he suggested that it's mostly because it's relatively close to the courthouses but in a rather isolated area, so it's easier to move cameras in and around it, not to mention park around it. Makes sense. It's pretty typical bar fare, but done well and served up to you in a fairly classic sense. All right, I got a burger. Hard to mess that up terribly. It's earth-shattering but perfectly acceptable for what it is and where I was. Nothing too extravagant, prices are typical TriBeCa prices and the decor is just nice and quaint and classy. No trends or dives here, just nice atmosphere. Definitely can't hurt to stop by here for lunch or dinner one night!",1,,1

158,Demitasse E.,"New York, NY",15,209,61,4.0,2/21/2010,"Walkers is a solid option if you're in Tribeca, hungry, and looking for a good dinner without going over the top (e.g. Landmarc, Bouley, et al).We sat at the bar and ordered wings as an appetizer and a burger each.  I'm never a fan of mashed potatoes, so I went against the grain and ordered french fries.  They were great and came with ketchup and two kinds of mustard.  One was Grey Poupon, but I forget what the other was.  This makes me sad because I really liked that second one.  sad face :(Our burgers were ordered medium-well, but mine at least was more of a well-done.  I just don't like ordering straight up medium because I risk it being a little too much on the rare side (which doesn't bother me with steak, but ground beef is a different story).  Even though the burger was more done than I'd have liked, it was still great.  The char on the hamburger patty was awwwesome.  It was nice that the burger had the usual lettuce + tomato without being stacked way high and impossible to eat.  The bun was nothing special, but it served its purpose of holding the beef.We sat at the bar, but we were offered a table.  Usually I think of the bar as a more fun place to sit because there's always something to watch.  I clearly didn't read the reviews closely enough or I would have opted for a table so I could draw with crayons.  Sure, I could buy a box and draw on paper at home, but that would feel just silly, instead of cute ironic silly.  Oh well, guess I'll have to come back!Anyway, I'm starting a Team French Fries.  If the mashed potatoes weren't so famous already, maybe the frenchies would get some credit! They are far better than at most other places and deserve their time in the sun. TFF!",3,2,

Their fries/mashed potatoes are also great. However- just recently stopped in for dinner and was kind of let down. The food was simply okay- it was nothing spectacular and the service was a bit of a let down. They messed up our bill 3 times before we finally got the correct amount with what we actually ordered..,,,

The day after a foot of snow fell on Manhattan, I was headed to Penn Station to catch my train back to Boston and chose to stop at Walkers on the way. I went here with my girlfriend because Yelpers had such good things to say about it, and by Joe were they ever right!We both had the burger - rare. Equally as rare was that the waitress asked us how we wanted them cooked, and didn't give the 'awww health code sucks' spiel when we asked for them as such. Mmmmmm topped with bacon, swiss, mushrooms and caramelized onions, I can say, and I do say, with confidence: this was the best burger I've ever had.Going along with the Yelp buzz, we both had the mashed potatoes on the side. Hit the spot right on that blustery winter's morn.

Great burgers, and the highlight of any meal there -- the mashed potatoes. Seriously the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.So last month, I was in New York on my birthday. We wanted a cheap-ish place for dinner and I chose Walker's. Still great food, still amazing mashed potatoes. The atmosphere is lovely here -- very old-timey New York bar. You wouldn't be surprised if someone told you that not much has changed since the last turn of the century (aka 1899, for you young'ins). The front room is rather tight and can get crowded with people waiting, but the unexpected back rooms (my friend, who had dined here before, was surprised by them) are great for larger parties.Also, our waiter was really great.

I got the steak, slightly dry and fatty, but overall good. My girlfriend got the portobello mushroom sandwich. The bread was stale but the mushrooms were well cooked. The taste of the mushroom was drowned out by the excessive amounts of tapenade and goat cheese. We got the apple crumble for dessert. It was cold and didn't taste like anything.Moreover the waitress was extremely surly. She brought me the wrong wine. When I told her about the mistake, she seemed angry at me. She took over fifteen minutes after bringing our drinks to take our order. When we asked her to take it, she asked us to hold on, cleared off three tables for no reason, and took two other tables orders before coming back to us. We had to ask for bread. When the check came, my credit card was yanked out of my hand. Noone said thank you to us at any point. We weren't acknowledged at all after our bill was paid.The restaurant itself was beautiful, but the service makes me never want to come back. Truly a disappointing experience.",4,1,

I was hoping to escape the 95+ degree heat today with a cold one and some A/C... but not in this establishment.  They had two beefy looking A/Cs window mounted, but I think only one of them was on.  At one point the waitress was walking around with a paper fan trying to keep cool.  Lord knows if the waitstaff is that hot, I don't even want to know what the kitchen staff is looking like.  That is why I ordered a salad, keep the chef away from the flames and less sweat will end up in your food.

My bf and I ended up ordering the same thing, mine with fires, his with mashed potatoes.  The food was really delicious and the mashed potatoes were creamy, garlicy, and perfectly buttered all at the same time.For dessert we ordered the Brownie Sundae which was also mouth watering!  HUGE, and only $6 it was definitely worth it.The only thing I took a star away for was the service.  We had to wait and wait for the server to come by, but she was really busy.I liked Walkers a lot and I will be sure to recommend it and frequent it again!",,,

188,Nils M.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,45,26,5.0,4/1/2012,"This place does one of the best burgers I have ever had - very tasty indeed, regardless of which type of cheese you chose (I'd recommend extra chilli con carne though). The other best thing on the menu is the tuna melt - real comfort food, and the fries are just the way they ought to be.",,,
189,Lauren B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,212,0,4.0,6/6/2012,"Great local place for burgers and beer. The service was a little slow and the place lacks decent drink specials, but it is worth recommending for the food and location.",,,
190,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,3.0,4/22/2007,"Yup those crayons rock. Writing haikus waiting for my juicy burger was a perfect way to spend a Sunday early dinner. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. Its just a classy pub restaurant, with multiple rooms to ensure more seating for everyone but keeping each space cozy. Pass on the chili, it was cold and not good. But the burger was very good, and the fries were surprisingly good as well. Their menu was the usual bar stuff, a little pub, a little grub, a little tex mex, a little new england american. It had a little bit of variety to it, so I wouldn't mind going back again to try something else. Its in a great location, one of my favorite areas to walk around.",3,,3
191,Dave M.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,40,12,4.0,4/17/2008,"If I were a neighborhood bar, I would want to be Walker's when I grew up.Walker's has history, plenty of locals, lots of seating options, oceans of beer on tap, a varied and affordable menu, crayons and paper tablecloths, and not least-of-all, a welcoming dark and clubby atmosphere.Saddle up to the bar and order up a generous plate of the excellent wings and a half-pint of Bass.  Or Urquell, if that's your flavor.  If those don't suit you there are only another 5 or 6 draft beers available for you to choose from, which seems like plenty to me.  Their burgers  are thick and well-fixed with the requisite array of add-ons, and from what I could tell they make a pretty serious fish and chips as well.You can watch the game on one of the TV's or strike up a conversation with the guy or gal sitting next to you.  Walker's feels like a simple and genuine Noo Yawk experience.  You will likely encounter plenty of families and the after-work crowd and... just possibly... one lone NY-to-Cali transplant, your intrepid reporter, feeling quite at home amid the bang and clatter, crayola-sketching salt and pepper shakers and thoroughly enjoying his Lower Manhattan adventure.",3,1,2
192,Beatrice W.,"New York, NY",50,161,11,5.0,3/26/2007,"I love the place, it is a real pub. In a neighborhood where the restaurant tend to be a bit too ""chic"" this is a real thing. The food is good and plentiful. Love the burger, the salads and the ambiance.More importantly, I will always be thankful to the owners and staff, for keeping the place open in the aftermath of 9/11. To see the light in that place, made the all ordeal a bit more manageable... So once again guys thank you!!!!",2,,3
193,Ruby F.,"New Orleans, LA",18,68,0,5.0,12/11/2007,"I have been going to this place for over ten years to meet my friends for a holiay-time lunch.  The food, all though the menu may have changed, has been pretty consistent over time: always large portions, standard items with a twist, delicious desserts - the food is not gourmet but definitely more refined then traditional pub fare.The waiters and waitresses are always friendly - and they will sing to you on your birthday!I recommend this place if you are a New Yorker looking for a place to take an out of towner to lunch.  It is in a great neighborhood (within walking distance from China Town) but isn't too freaky or fancy.",2,,2

195,Barbara C.,"London, United Kingdom",84,226,4,4.0,10/22/2006,"Walkers is a classic pub with classic wood paneling and a classic pub menu.  I love the look and feel of the place.  The service can be spotty, but I'm usually not in a hurry when I go here.The menu is entirely forgettable, though my friend swears by the ribs here (they're a special, not on the regular menu).  I've had an okay burger and okay salad here.  I feel like there should be more beers on draught for such a classic pub, but they've got Stella, so I can't complain too much. The crayons at every table (with accompanying paper table cloth) are by far my favorite part of this place--many an argument has been settled over tic-tac-toe here.  During my last visit we used them to keep a tally of pieces of actual corn in a friend's ""corn"" chowder--total corn count:  15 pieces.",2,,1
196,Regi K.,"San Francisco, CA",25,245,7,3.0,5/7/2008,"American food.   Five of us came after meeting up with 2 friends and sister from the borough ride.  We had the buffalo wings that were terrific... good heat and yummilicious, enough for all 5 of us to share.   We had the cobb salad, a side of mashed potatoes, the duck fettucini, bass with wild rice and greens, and a grilled salmon over mixed greens.   Those of us who had the salad and potatoes enjoyed our meal.  I was told the duck tasted like day old duck and the fettucini was too al dente.   The bass was not tasty though the accompaniment was.   I enjoyed my salmon very much.   It was light, flaky and perfectly cooked over the greens tossed with miso dressing.   yum yumm...overall I think 3 stars... like netflix... liked it.",2,,1
197,Dena L.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,45,0,4.0,6/24/2008,"Dear Walkers,You did pretty much everything right. The adorable brunch-time basket of mini muffins and mini croissants was wonderful - the coffee was delicious and I like that you kept it coming. While the Bloody Marys were VERY spicy, I appreciate the fact that we each received one free of charge with our meal. Seriously, thank you.We ordered your French Toast, huevos rancheros and seared yellow fin salad. OH. MY. GOD. THE SALAD WAS INCREDIBLE. It cost almost $15, but easily had $20-$25 worth of raw tuna on top of it, laid across the veggies in long, thin slabs. (Writing about it is making me crave it.)The salad also came with ginger and wasabi, as well as a soy-based dressing.The only downside to the entire meal was our flaky waitress. She was older, very tan with a wrinkly face. She was wearing what looked like a neon green babydoll dress with hot pink trim. All that is fine - but after delivering our food, she went MIA for more than an hour. We finally flagged down another waiter who gave us some 'tude when we paid we two different cards. Otherwise, people, definitely spend a lazy Sunday roaming Tribeca before settling down for an amazing brunch at Walkers. So good.",2,,1
198,Samantha N.,"Queens, NY",0,7,0,2.0,6/23/2014,"Visited this place last night and the service was poor. Not attentive.  Food was ok,  Didnt feel like they appreciated our business. We're going to ""Walk"" on by this one from now on.",,,
