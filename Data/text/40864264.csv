0,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,3.0,9/14/2018,"Stopped by here for a quick drink after work on a Wednesday night. Dimly lit sports bar with plenty of seating available at the bar and the several tables strewn about. No food menu to speak of, but a full bar with cocktails, beers, and wine. Started off with a Dale's Pale Ale on draft ($8), then went for a KCBC Cryptocurrency in a can ($8). Vibe was chill throughout the night as the bartenders made chit chat with the regulars. With no happy hour (as far as I could tell) or food, this spot is simply your regular sport/dive bar. Fine enough spot if you don't want to deal with bigger crowds in neighboring bars.",2,1,1
1,Simran S.,"Edgewater, NJ",64,2,0,1.0,11/3/2018,"My friends and I were here on the night of Halloween, and our experience couldn't have been worse. We waited at the bar for a good 10 minutes before the bartender finally came up to take our order. When we took a second before giving her our order, she rudely began to rush us by saying we were holding everyone up. When we were ready to order our second round of drinks, she literally just kept walking by us, not once stopping to take our order. My friend finally attempted to get her attention by calling out to her loudly and she started yelling at him! She began by saying ""I only have two hands"" and finally admitted that she was avoiding us on purpose because of the tip we gave her for our first order, and ended by saying ""You give me a shitty tip, you wait. That's the reason you're waiting right now. You can't give me a shitty tip and expect me to come back for your next order."" She was obnoxious and her behaviour was highly unacceptable! Besides, if you want to get tipped well, treat your customers well! Don't expect a large tip when you start off by rubbing us the wrong way. Unfortunately I don't remember her name, but she was the only female bartender there the night of Halloween. I would not go back here and definitely do not recommend this place!",,,

I decided not to tip because two shots should be an easy sale. The girl working here screamed at me for not tipping. Trying to start an argument. I disengaged and walked to the door. It was raining and we had 5 minutes to kill. She asked the bouncer to kick us out. He seemed nice. We left voluntarily. Bar seemed nice. Question a place that makes a mistake and doesn't apologize, but instead acts aggressive. Service was definitely lacking!!!",,,

Not divey in the sense that it's dirty but in the sense that its not trying too hard. Beers are cheap and the playlist is on point. The downside is that the bar is not very big so on the weekends it can sometimes get unbearably packed. When it isn't at that level it's always a good time. The crowd is young and looking to get drunk. Even when it's empty they have huge tvs and you can play golden tee and buck hunter. Definitely a great place to watch a game.

At all. Seriously, this place puts Phebe's to shame in terms of frattiness. This is very much your stereotypical hookup bar full of girls/guys who were in fraternities and sororities in college. This is the type of place where a guy can buy a girl two beers, talk to her for ten minutes while she fake giggles at bad jokes, and then take her home right after. In other words, this is a college frat party squeezed into a very small and uncomfortable bar. Drinks.... very average. My drink was pretty weak. If you want to grab a beer, there are a million places in the city with a better selection and better crowd.  I caught a few snippets of various conversations going on around me and felt my IQ dropping 10 points each minute I was at this place with all these fratty idiots.

I requested a beer and in being told it was not available asked to sample an equivalent. The bartender poured a full glass and I mentioned that I had only wanted a sample. Not only did she refuse me service but asked her fellow blonde bartender to do the same. She then proceeded to really loudly and rudely inform me that I was no longer welcome here.

But then there was also this venomous-tongued old man being ushered out for using a term not generally spoken north of the Mason-Dixon line.

Updated review","**Please note, this is not an update of the staff or the bar itself, as they have remained a constant four to five stars. It is still a great place to watch a Mets game as they have a giant projector screen in addition to the several tv's. Wow. The clientele has changed here. Apparently now it's an extension of NYU, as it is filled with all white, overly-privileged children who cannot be bothered to pick up after themselves (ie: throw away their empty pizza boxes and other food garbage) and ""dude brahs.""Maybe it was an off day or something. Maybe it's not like this except when there's a World Cup match to watch.  Maybe I'll have to come back on a random Tuesday after work*.

Mind you, I had just received that card 3 days prior ... When I asked my bank where and how - he said it was hard to tell where purchase actually happened because the charge was MANUALLY imputed. AKA Village Tavern bartenders (or someone who works there) took down my credit card info.

There's a bit of space on the dance floor as well, so if you're up to putting a few songs in the jukebox and showing your moves, you can do that as well.

It is one of the best late night dance spots, with an excellent playlist (but beware putting money in the jukebox, it's a scam) and a great crowd, especially the cute southern guys (my fave). The guy at the door is always super nice, fair and accommodating, and the bartenders are always wonderful. But tonight, as well as other nights, I had an unfortunate experience that went so far as to prompt my joining of Yelp because I want to make sure the issue is recognized and (hopefully) addressed (as I know a lot of bar owners regularly check Yelp and act on their unfavorable reviews). Some of the guys who enforce last call are extraordinarily rude. I understand the need to close things down; I am a lawyer, I understand the urgency of emptying the place before 4am. But in my experience, well before 4am, guys in your employ have yelled at me, demanded my seat, and even forcibly snatched drinks out of my hand in their efforts to shoo me out the door as soon as possible. Their actions are outrageously rude and not at all in line with the general spirit of welcoming and camaraderie that I usually experience at this establishment. There are strategies for ushering benevolent patrons out the door that do not involve violence and intimidation and I hope that you will employ such in the future.Please take this as an overall positive review but encourage some gentility amongst your night-end bouncers.

I also like how this place has a pool table and some arcade games.. although I've never actually played (because I'm too busy bopping around to Miley Cyrus).  It's laid back but there's always dancing going on... at least late night.  If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a place to end your night, go to Village Tavern .  See ya there.",,1,

Updated review","I used to come here quite a bit.  I think when they painted the bar, the clientele got more polished as well.  Drink prices went up with the make over and the buy backs were less and less frequent until they were gone..  The spot still does well, so if you're usual is in Murry Hill and you can't find you're friends, they're probably here... If they still bring in the pizza during NFL games, then I'd say it's an average 3 star on Sundays.  The bar does well and I'm happy for the owners, but it's just not my scene any more.  Cheers fellas!",,,

70,Johnny K.,"New York, NY",4,77,0,5.0,2/8/2010,"Great neighborhood ""sports"" bar. I only really call it a sports bar because they do in fact have many TV's and show sporting events.   It's one of my favorite places in NYC to watch Sunday NFL games. The thing that's great about it though is that it's a good all-around bar for happy hour, pre-game drinks, late night, etc.  Rarely a line or wait at the door, and the location and bar's layout are excellent.  The actual bar area itself is massive and so it's relatively easy to get a drink, which is great.  If you're into video games and Golden Tee, Big Buck / Safari Hunter, etc, there's lot of that to be found as well.  Bar sometimes gets a definite Alabama / ACC / UVA / southern feel to it, but it's definitely a good place.  Inside tip: they don't serve food, but you can order from pretty much restaurant in the village to deliver here (just ask for their book of menu's); to tide you over while you wait, you can ask for bowls of goldfish crackers, which they keep behind the bar.",,,
