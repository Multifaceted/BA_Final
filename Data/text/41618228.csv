0,Danielle M.,"Jersey City, NJ",55,91,238,4.0,11/18/2018,"Lucky's does a decent burger that I'd probably give 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up to 4 stars because I got my meal delivered and I'm impressed by how well it held up. This is specifically a review for their delivery!I ordered a pretty standard burger with cheese and the classic toppings, plus ketchup and Lucky's sauce. I requested for the buns and sauce to be on the side to avoid a soggy bun, and also ordered a side of onion rings. My meal got to the office and was very well wrapped with the patty and toppings separate from each other, the bun in a different container, and the sauce separate as well. Onion rings also in its own thing. The burger was enjoyable. Nothing too special to make it amazing, but nothing horrible either. It was cooked exactly as I wanted it, and the ketchup and Lucky's sauce added a nice touch. The onion rings were amazing! Again, very impressed with the delivery. I was initially hesitant to order them because I didn't want them to come soggy, but the risk was worth it because they stayed hot and crispy! Delicious and perfect with the burger. Overall, decent burger but not enticing enough to order again (maybe I'd do just onion rings by themselves) when there are so many other options in the city. But delivery was nicely done and I'd recommend trying once.",,,1

I'm not even sure how that's possible for a beef Patty to be honest.The fries were fine, but once again overcooked and I wasn't a fan of the Lucky's sauce. Pro tip, stick to Shake Shack instead of a visit here.",,,

3,Ruth U.,"New York, NY",33,175,227,1.0,10/29/2018,"Finally tried the impossible burger. Full honesty here: it was dry AF I'm pretty sure it was the place/way it was made rather than the burger itself, so I'm going to give it another go somewhere else. Tasted bland and the bread was slightly damp. The ""meat"" had no flavor & was just such a letdown.",,,

5,Stalina G.,"New York, NY",31,16,1,4.0,10/4/2018,"My kids favorite burger place. It's worth checking out for many reasons: great food, cleanliness and service. The sauces are great too. They also play the best music! Whoever makes the playlists deserves a special recognition (hello, The Killers, Aerosmith, RHCP and basically all best 90s and early 2000s music). The food is not cheap, be prepared to pay about $30 for two burger combos. I give 4 stars because the burgers could be slightly bigger.",,,1
6,Dove C.,"New York, NY",906,80,18,5.0,7/12/2018,"I've been going to both Lucky's locations for a few years now, but a little over a year ago I stopped eating red meat and chicken, so I stopped eating burgers. Luckys has a couple of good vegetarian burger options, but when I found out that the impossible burger was on the menu I made sure to check it out. I must say that of all the restaurants I've tried so far, Lucky's has been my favorite. You can customize your impossible burger a lot of different ways. And no I don't get paid to advertise, I just really like the impossible burger a lot! It makes me feel like I'm eating a juicy burger again without harming any animals. Pure happiness! I love the staff at this location also, because no matter what time day or night they are always friendly and accommodating. My food is always cooked perfectly, and it's kind of a cool spot to just hang out and watch some TV while you enjoy your meal.",,,1
7,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,4.0,1/31/2018,"To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about dining here since the venue was dark, dingy, had a musty smell and an unclean vibe. Despite all that, I went with the Yelp reviews and still gave this place a try. Lucky's offers a variety of different burgers, hot dogs and milkshakes. They also offer a number of different dipping sauces, such as their famous Lucky's sauce. I settled for the Hell's Kitchen burger after reading a tip here on Yelp. The burger was basically sloppy joe in between 2 slices of bread with cheese. Not saying that that's a bad thing. Although it was a messy experience, the burger tasted surprisingly delectable. The fries that they serve here reminded me of the golden crinkly-cut fries over at Shake Shack. They also tasted just as good. I recommend trying all the sauces that they offer here as you will not be disappointed. Overall, my first experience here was decent despite my initial impressions. The staff were courteous and efficient. They also Boylan soda (in bottles and at the soda fountain) here which is a big plus. I showed my alumni ID here to get $1.10 off...only to find out later that they also honor the 10% cashback Yelp deal if you pay with your qualifying debit/credit deal! WIN WIN. Will definitely be back in the future to try their other offerings.",1,,
8,Ground Zero M.,"New York, NY",1,22,93,5.0,7/8/2018,"All these years our 9/11 Museum in the Meatpacking District has been so close to LUCKYS but we never ate there - until today! What a surprise! The Impossible Burger is a Vegan delight, and it resembled beef so much we believed there was an order mixup! That's how good their veggie burger is! Grilled onions, Swiss cheese, tomatoes and mushrooms round out this plant-based alternative to beef. We also sampled the grilled chicken sandwich which was filled to the brim with chicken, cheese, onions and mushrooms. The potato rolls are delicious. The presentation of the burgers in their tight wrapped silver foil are very clean and compact. AmaZing food and highly recommended!!!!!",,,1

11,Caroline D.,"Santa Monica, CA",118,137,78,4.0,10/28/2017,Lucky's is my favorite burger delivery even if their fries are trash. Their burgers are better than other more expensive options in the neighborhood and it's consistent. The lettuce bun option is surprisingly clutch and not as messy as you would think. Their special sauce is also a must (even if it is probably just ketchup mixed with mayo). Only taking off a star because of the fries which are similar to cardboard in texture.,1,1,1
12,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,4.0,10/9/2017,Went to Lucky's a few weeks ago before attending a birthday gathering and needed something to eat before drinks. Very good burgers here and fries as well. I like the different sauce options that they give including the chipotle mayo and lucky's famous sauce which both were very good.Cheeseburger was very good with the sauces. Next time I'm here which hopefully will be soon will most likely try either the BBQ Bacon or the Chelsea. Good service here as well.,1,,1
13,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",449,1226,32,3.0,4/1/2018,"This place is kind of dark and rustic, but the food isn't bad although it is on the peppery side and the sauce I tried tasted almost exactly like Chick-Fil-A's signature topping.",1,,
14,Jieun L.,"New York, NY",623,203,724,3.0,5/1/2017,"Found this place by happenstance. It's a quick joint to grab a burger. We ordered two cheeseburgers with the house sauce, cheese fries, and onion rings. The server was not very friendly and the restaurant was in a pretty dirty condition when we went. The burger itself was good. The meat was medium rare and the house sauce was delicious. However, the buns were cold - I wish they had grilled the buns or had prepared it differently. It tasted like it was bought straight from the grocery store. The fries were good - they were cooked but just barely. They could have been more crisp. The buffalo onion rings were my least favorite. They had doused them in the sauce and by the time we were eating it, the onion rings were not crispy at all.",,,

Prices for the build your own are just too expensive though! /:",,,
16,Laura R.,"Cambridge, MA",8,9,0,5.0,3/7/2018,"This review is for a Mealpal order for their veggie burger with sweet potato fries. The woman behind the counter is awesome- she was taking orders on the phone, running the register, and handling pick-up orders, all with a smile on her face. I appreciated that they didn't pre-bag the mealpal orders but appeared to be making them shortly before pick up times so everything made it back to the office piping hot. Sweet potato fries were delicious, veggie burger was high quality, flavorful, and had a nice amount of toppings, and a special shout out to the Lucky's sauce and the chipotle mayo on the sauce bar.",1,,

The burger was so juicy that it made the bun soggy and was a little challenging to eat, but was decent nonetheless. My main gripe, is that I wish the meat was seasoned a little more.I also split an order of the cajun fries and they were a bit too cajun for my liking (they put a cajun powder over regular fries), so I would just stick with the originals.Overall, the food here was cheap and serviceable and the service was friendly, but nothing super exciting in terms of flavor.",1,,1

They have fountain drinks so we got to refill our drinks. Thats always nice. Next to that they have the sauces.

27,Justina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,91,21,2.0,8/28/2018,"Have only ever had them catered at my office, so I can't speak to the location itself, but the food is delicious! In fact, I just placed my second catering order, only three weeks after the first one.I've had their cheeseburger, veggie burger, wings, fries, onion rings, and hot dogs, and I can vouch that all are delicious. I am actually not a huge hot dog fan, but I really loved their hot dogs. We had tried to order the portobello burger but they didn't have them -- would still love to try. Food came on time, ready to eat, and was easy to set up. Dealing with the catering staff over the phone was equally as pleasant. Will continue to order from them -- and will hopefully eventually be able to visit their location in person!Update: Dropping down two stars because I just looked at my receipts from them and realized I was charged more than the prices listed on their own website's catering menu. Some items were as much as $10 more, some were $5 more. When I notified them of this, I was told they're aware and they're ""working on fixing it,"" but that I was charged the same as my previous order. I'm not sure if that was supposed to be comforting, but it wasn't. So you overcharged me three weeks ago, and in those three weeks, you couldn't update your website? Their catering menu is literally a link on their website -- you click on it and it opens a PDF in a new window. It's as simple as changing their link in their website code. How is that too complicated for them to do? Especially as it was their ""Digital Media Manager and IT specialist"" who responded telling me that they're working on changing the online menu. You're telling me that your IT Specialist and Digital Media Manager isn't capable of the basic HTML needed to change a link?I definitely don't appreciate being overcharged and prices not matching what their own official channels indicate, nor does the response of ""yeah, we know, we're trying to fix it"" really suffice. If there are price discrepancies, that should be disclosed at the point of payment; they should be notifying customers that the listed prices are not the correct ones. I definitely won't be ordering food for my office from them again.",,,

I'm always willing to try new shit and the way I look at it you can't really get much wrong when ordering a turkey burger. I ordered the turkey burger combo and it really wasn't all that.The fries were crinkle fries and had a good salty flavor. But for $11.98 I wish it was a different kind of French fry( I know I'm a French fry snob) being that you can get crinkle cut fries from just about anywhere.The burger was missing that grilled charred taste you would expect from a burger place.

Updated review","So, Jerome was polluted last night. And pretty much on the verge of death. After a tuff day, I drank way too much at this bar on a roof near Madison Sq park that had red robes, but that's not really important. What is important is my drunk ass went to Hill Country and had two thighs ( muy delicioso ) and kept it moving on 23rd street all the way to Boston Market. Yes, I wanted more chicken. Scratch that, I NEEDED more food. Anything would have been good at this point, otherwise, that A train ride uptown wouldn't have been good for me or anyone in the car with me. The hood rat at the counter gave me a look when I walked in that i'm pretty sure meant, "" Get the hell out, we're closing in 10 minutes and if you order something, I WILL spit on it"". I'm a very self aware person (even when drunk), so Elvis exited stage right and walked across the street to Lucky's to fill my gut. It had to be done. Now, I haven't been here in a minute and my memory is horrible. The drugs and or alcohol combo of intake over the span of my life has left me with two brain cells and those bastards have been clashing like Israel and those Hummus guys for supremecy. I actually walked in here thinking, ""oh, I've never been here before"".  What. A. Douche. Well, after reading my original review this a.m.... it's worse, then originally chronicled. Even drunk. I judge a burger in it's most basic form: no sauce, no cheese, and the usual suspects of onion plus tomato. My drunk ass got lettuce with it, which I normally don't. Anyway, this burger was sad and a snooze fest. The bun was dry and limp. Pause. The meat is bland and generic. Still, it did save my life, so for that it gets one star. Plus, the sauce options and quality of drinks does deserve to be recognized. The fries are horrific. Crinkle cut, is the worst cut, but the taste of their fries make me want to run in front of a moving cab, head first. I tasted like a generic version of BK fries. I love fries. It's so upsetting when someone fucks up a fried potato. The food quality and taste here is like a national chain, but on some Shake Shack kind of price point. Wack and I won't be back. Unless, I'm on the verge of death.",9,4,5
35,Anquinette T.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,6,2.0,7/23/2018,"I've had better. I was really hungry but the guy at the counter messed up my entire order. I ordered a Lucky Famous Burger with no lettuce.

I've walked by this location at least 100 times and never went in, I think cause of the colors (red & yellow) of the place maybe? And just didn't seem appetizing to me for some reason. So I decided to go in the other day and was happy with their product. The burger had a nice thickness to it, and I got the Lucky sauce on the side which had a good flavor to it. The potato bread bun was nice and soft and the crinkle fries were crunchy and tasty. This place is definitely better than most, if not all fast food burger places, but maybe not as good as premium places like Bareburger, etc.  And I thought the chocolate shake was just ok, but not that great.

My boyfriend said he would like if they had a meal plan. You have to buy the burger, fries, and drink all deprecate which kinda sucks for some people that would like that option.You do get a discount if you're a college student which we like however.

After the movies, I when in because I had a hankering for cheeseburger. I when it at around 7:30 p.m. and there were only a few patrons in the restaurant. There is ample seating at tables and barstools. I ordered a well done cheeseburger with barbecue sauce and the basic fixins. It was $7 and change, not bad. It took about 5-10 minutes for my ordered. I definitely enjoyed my burger--nice and messy. They were playing really good music so even after I was done eating, I stayed. At one point, I was the only one in the restaurant--but that didn't last long. I decided get an order of fries, that took about another 5 minutes because it's made to order!! That was about $3.86 with tax. I got chipotle mayo and lucky sauce for dipping along with some ketchup packets. OMG, you have to get the lucky sauce, it is soooo good. The employees are friendly and they do an excellent job keeping the place clean. I lost count how many times they took the trash out. Also, people must be a big fan of their delivery service because the delivery guy kept coming in and out with orders. I didn't get any but they have Boylan soda, so you can avoid corn syrup, if that's important to you. I should mention that while they accept credit cards, you have to spend a minimum of $6.00.

Originally we were looking around for a pizza place but this restaurant seemed alright so we popped in.I liked the kind of gaudy, old school diner atmosphere, even though the color scheme was a slightly off Micky D's. The guy who was at the counter was really friendly. He let my friend use his card even though it was below $7 and was very enthusiastic about the different sauces when we asked him what everything was. It's like the first time that I've seen a customer-friendly cashier in a long time.I ordered the cheeseburger with swiss cheese and lucky sauce. It was DELICIOUS. The grilled onions really made an impact and the lucky sauce is top notch (mayonnaise with a smoked hickory flavoring). I drenched my burger in that stuff. The cheese was thick and gave the burger a nice, satisfying mellow taste.We sat in there and played cards while we waited for another friend to join us and they didn't kick us out or anything, which is always nice. The only drawback is that the place is a bit on the expensive side. I had a two patty burger for $10, but I guess that's not actually that bad for New York.",,,1
84,Peter L.,"San Francisco, CA",3406,948,3302,2.0,10/1/2013,"For the cheddar burger. It's not poorly made but didn't stood out either. Just buns, meat patty charbroiled and cheddar cheese. It was kind of like a Whopper - I don't like Whoppers. The crinkle-cut fries were decent albeit oily, and especially good when dipped into their famous sauce (Thousand Island mix?) or their chipotle mayo sauce.There are seven combos, only three of which were burgers and that's including the turkey or veggie burgers. The rest were sandwiches, hotdogs, wraps, etc., though kudos for variety. Otherwise, you have to order burgers and sides separately.Will return next time to get the bacon cheddar burger or even ""Hell's Kitchen"" burger since it has jalapenos!The decor is bright yellow and red, with whimsical images and smiley decals. It is easy to spot as a result. This location is next to a movie theater, perfect for before or after for sure.",7,5,7

87,Xander H.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,232,367,4.0,9/19/2015,"It's a good middle ground between Shake Shack and In N Out.I'm not saying it's better than either of them, but it is a good nearby alternative that has some slightly different options and is open much later (2AM)!The Place: The inside of the restaurant is a little disappointing, and didn't seem perfectly clean the few times that I went. It is small, and you order at a tiny counter in the back. I would mainly recommend this place for takeout.The Food: The burgers, fries, and shakes are all delicious! It feels like a cross between Shake Shack and In N Out. One of their advantages over Shake Shack is that you can get your burgers wrapped in lettuce rather than a bun, making it slightly healthier - Then go ahead and cancel that healthiness out with a delicious cookie milkshake!The Value: It is more expensive than In N Out but slightly less expensive than Shake Shack. Around the $10-20 region depending on how much you order. It doesn't feel like you are getting a superb value for your money in terms of the amount of food, but the food is still good enough to make it worth it.",,,
88,Lin Y.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",29,258,2262,3.0,8/28/2013,"Lucky's Burgers has several branches in the City.  I went to the one in Chelsea.  The place is really clean and vibrant.  Don't know why, but it has a bit of nostalgic burger joint feel to me and that's good news!  There's signage outside with Lucky's menu as well as some other specials on the outside windows. There's a giant Lucky's logo right as you come in.  It's a huge smiley-type face and there are other smaller painted logos on top of the beams in Lucky's.  Menus are posted in the front and back of this eat-in or take-out burger joint.  The guys either wear red or black Lucky's Burger T-shirts and they are really a very happy bunch of workers.  They were friendly and just nice with positive energy.  I get that they are happy to work at Lucky's Burgers.There's a counter facing outside if you want to sit there, or tables.  There is also a condiment area and one where you can get Lucky's own sauce, ketchup and chipotle mayo.  There's a soda fountain and they also have bottled sodas such as Mash and Boylan brands.Feeling the need for some protein, I had to get the Lucky Burger for $5.50 to go.  It came with onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and Angus beef patty all on a Martin's potato bread bun.  Potato bread tends to be very soft, and sometimes the bread will stick to the insides of your mouth.  The softness doesn't quiet support the burger well, but clever foil packaging that wraps the burger prevents anything major from slipping out and keeps the burger orderly.  I skipped the fries, even though I would have liked to taste just one or two pieces.  I also pumped some Lucky's own sauce in a small takeout container to try.  It had a slight orange color and a sweetish taste to it.  I spread some on my burger sides, but this burger didn't need it.  The meat was good on its own and ketchup was the perfect compliment.They also have veggie burgers and also spiced fries as well as shakes, smoothies and cookies.  The burgers take a little bit to cook up, so don't expect instant burger.  You might hang around and sit at one of their counters or enjoy a seat until your name is called.  They also have Lucky's $10 special, where you get a sandwich combo of your choice, fries and a 24 oz. soda.  By the way, for those who want to skip the carbs, there is also the naked Lucky burger, which is served between lettuce.  There are also chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders.I would definitely come back to try some other items as well as have the Lucky Burger again and might like to experience dining in.",2,,

Since these burgers are custom made, you will be waiting from 5 to 15 minutes for your burger.  That's okay.  There are several TV screens there to keep you entertained.  I normally get a simple burger with the free toppings.  But I did try one of their specialty burgers that had a fried onion ring in it.  I was not impressed with the ensemble, so I took the onion out to eat it separately.  Other than that, their burgers are good.",,,

94,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",543,1119,3574,4.0,4/28/2011,"I really don't know why I was so fascinated with Lucky's. It's a small establishment where you order at the front counter and wait for your name to be called at the Pick-Up window near the back. There usually is a wait of at least 5 minutes even when its empty since everything is made to order. The place is colorful and whimsical in its radiant red and yellow colors, giving it a part-diner ambiance yet with the modern amenities of 4 LCD TV's airing mostly sports games. Although there is ample seating, 6 tables seating a total of 18 and another 8 high-stool seats, it all seems a bit claustrophobic as you're shoulder to shoulder with your fellow neighbor. But it's quick dining somewhat like fast food but better.The Lucky Cheddar Burger ($6.00), one of their signature burgers, was definitely a hit in my book. I wasn't asked how I would like my burger to be cooked, but don't fret, as they do a very good job giving it a nice charred outside and juicy inside. I couldn't quite put my palate to it, but I kept thinking of a soy sauce marinade, some sort of salty goodness. The cheddar cheese was melted on the burger enough so that it was oozing on the sides of the patty. The usual default fixins were also found on the burger: fresh lettuce, 2-3 raw onions, a tomato slice and 2 pickle slices. I was truly impressed with their burger, simple yet tasty. The only thing I would have changed is to have some pinkness in the patty.The Sweet Potato Fries ($4.00) served in a sizable paper-like bag can probably be split among 2 people. These fries were perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside complimented with a nice sweetness. For once, sweet potato fries taste like their starchy brethren, without being dry inside. Dip those fries into the Chipotle Mayo, which has a subtle note of heat, and Lucky Sauce which is sort of like a ranch/thousand island type of dipping sauce. Yum-oh!! Heck, pour some on the burger too!!And round it all up with a 24 oz. Fountain Soda ($2.00). I wouldn't want it any other way, burgers, fries and a drink will do me justice time and time again. Lucky's is just one of those places where they seemed to do everything perfectly warranting a revisit. And did I mention that you can get all three for $10. Not an extremely excellent deal but with all these burger joints turning up $6-$8 burgers, the $10 combo deal is starting to sound more and more enticing.",,,1

Last but not least, the service is professional, straightforward, and friendly without being fake and overly-commercial. I got a $7.00 burger, and I am impressed with what I got. Better than many $9 or $10 burgers. I gave a $1.00 tip because the 4 or 5 times I have gone here, the food's good and the service is too. I really like this place!",,,

The burger quality was decent, but the patty wasn't that special. A good place to eat before or after the movies.

This decor, however...as soon as I walked in I wanted to walk out.  It's just really appalling.  I mean, really, it's a fast food place, you're in and out in 10-20 minutes tops.  You don't really need to go so overboard.  So, for the first time in any of my reviews, the decor forced me to dip my rating a bit.     They have a little selection of sauces for the burgers and fries.  Generally I like that.  Not here.  I was pretty disappointed.     So if you want to spend $8 on a fast food burger you have plenty of much superior options, a few right in the same area.  Or you could go to any typical fast food joint and get something similar or better for cheaper.  I'd take Wendys in a heartbeat over Luckys.",4,6,3

So I ordered the Lucky bacon cheeseburger..I think it was called lol. And then I last minute decided I wanted cheesy fries (great idea by the way!!! they were mhmm good!)

Updated review","This is the best after drunken burger spot in a perfect location. In the midst of scattered bars, galleries and movie theater that host the Rocky Horror Show. It is up the street from comedy clubs. Lets talk about the menu! Smoking/Smoken fries highly addictive. Its great with ketchup, Chipotle or Mayo. I stopped eating red meat a year ago. One word veggie burger in the lettuce wrap.  I have convinced meat eaters to try and they also fell in love at first bite. Bright color decor and happy face lets you know you're at a friendly chain restaurant. Want gourmet burger, grow up-sober up and go to a gourmet burger at 8 pm. This is for the get home on filled and content buyers. Every where cannot be the same. By the way my friend and I wanted to work there for a day just to see what the hell they put in that sauce. The city that parties late hours-needs place for all its midnight-marauders",1,,
171,Dan W.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",61,13,1,3.0,11/9/2012,"Late night out and was craving a cheeseburger like no other. Luckily, no pun intended, there was Lucky's right by my subway station. I quickly ran in to get a burger and fries before hopping onto my train. I ordered the Lucky cheddar burger and an order of fries. The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender. It was taunting me on the entire train ride home, but I managed to avoid eating it by snacking on the fries. Needless to say I had eaten it immediately when I returned to my apt and it was delicious!Fries were a bit bland so I dipped them in the chipotle mayo sauce and Lucky sauce to spice them up a bit. The sauce was a nice touch.Overall, I rated Lucky's 3 Stars because I thought the price point wasn't right. The basic Lucky Cheddar Burger ($6.50) and Fries ($3.00). Unfortunately, I missed my train because the service was incredibly slow, even when there wasn't a line in front of me.",,,
172,Jennifer O.,"Manhattan, NY",18,237,12,5.0,10/23/2011,"If you love Shake Shack but hate the line (or the outdoors), then come to Lucky's!  I find that they taste very similar, from the perfect bun and jagged-edge meat patty to the crinkle cut fries.Since I like to drown my burger in toppings, I love Lucky's serve-yourself containers of ketchup, mustard, Lucky's Sauce (seasoned mix of ketchup and mayo, like thousand island without relish), and CHIPOTLE MAYO (not mayonnaise-y at all, just the right amount of delicious kick).Everything is fantastic:Lucky burgerLucky mini's (for people who want to increase the bun:meat ratio, or for people who want breakfast the next day *cough, cough, ahem*)Fries (always cooked just the right amount of cripsiness and salt)Onion rings (in an order you get about 7 big, thick rings)CookiesPrices are really reasonable for the amount of food ... their $10 deal gets you a cheeseburger, big side of fries, and fountain soda, and their delivery minimum is $10.  Hmm, convenient...The other great thing is the staff - the woman who works at the register is sooo sweet and recognizes all of her repeat customers.  Service is fast, they always have a guy cleaning up as people finish, and the location is convenient (by the Chelsea theater and the 1/C/E lines on 23rd).They always have about 6 TVs on (without sound) playing news and sports.",1,,

Can't say I looked at it that often, nor can I remember it,  but it looks good.  They have the Lucky's special sauce and chipotle mayo. They also sell cookies! The seating here accommodates about 30-40 people. There is a bathroom (for all you late nighter's lookin for that last chance to evacuate the bladder, lol) Both the seating and bathroom are relatively clean at all times.

(I am the queen of procrastination, even when it comes to coupons and Groupons, clearly.)Anyway, that's a good deal if I do say so myself, I just couldn't let it go to waste. The $0.50 got me a sandwich, fries and a burger. Most importantly, unlimited chipotle mayo. Good for my fries, not for my thighs. Whatever, it's chipotle mayo, totally worth the calories in my opinion.I didn't get a burger so I can't comment on that, but I did get the ""Lucky's Famous Chicken Sandwich"" which was pretty tasty. The bacon and chipotle mayo (it pops up again!) was a nice addition, and while slightly messy, the sandwich overall was filling and tasty. The fries I liked--super crisp and best enjoyed fresh. Diet Coke, can't go wrong. Free refills are nice though I took my meal to-do so I didn't take advantage. I have to say that the counter girl was really nice and friendly, she didn't seem to hate her life like many other fast-food/fast-casual joints.

All the ingredients that were used tasted fresh and believe me you can tell the difference between the ingredients used here and the ingredients used at Mickey D's. I found myself disappointed when I ran out of fries, very tasty.  That chocolate shake...it was nice and thick, which is just the way a shake should be.  All together everything totaled a little under $11. Which wasn't bad at all because you get a ton of fries and the drink is a good size as well, I believe it's the #1.Definitely could see myself coming here again.",3,3,3
