We ordered the banh mi loaded fries, which comes with fries topped with Sriracha Mayo / Spicy Green Sauce / Nem Nuong Pork / Pickled Carrot & Daikon / Cilantro / Jalapeno / Egg. The spicy green sauce added a nice kick and the pickled carrot & daikon made it very refreshing after each bite, almost like a palette cleanser. Overall, I really liked these fusion fries since I didn't feel gross after finishing it and could have easily gone back for more.",1,1,2
1,Sharai R.,"Miami, FL",338,143,653,4.0,7/22/2018,"I'm a little bias because I LOVE FRENCH FRIES & I also love poutine and they have both of those things.The chicken poutine comes with a lot of cheese on top and the jam is a great touch as well...salty/sweet combo is always a win.They're open late which is great because if you don't want pizza in the LES on a late night, there are other options.I would also recommend the classic sandwich...a great amount of breading on the chicken. It was especially crispy.",3,3,3
2,Angie B.,"West New York, NJ",52,128,136,4.0,7/18/2018,"Finally made it to this hidden gem. This is a tiny spot, maybe 9 seats total. For anyone who wants to sit down and eat your meals, you may have to wait for a seat. We tried the nacho fries and the chicken poutine fries. The fries are to die for, super crunchy and flavorful. My nacho fries were loaded up with your favorite nacho toppings; you've got your guac, beans, jalapeño, tomato, sour cream as well as nacho cheese sauce. YUM.The chicken poutine had delicious, crunchy fried chicken, gravy, cranberry sauce and cheese curds. I could have done without the cranberry but that's just personal preference. Another plus service is super quick, just grab a jarritos and enjoy!",2,1,1

Both items were super good ; the chicken was juicy and crispy whilst the toppings (guac, beans etc) on the fries were fresh. Service was friendly and the menu's straight to the point.",,1,

The fries taste very fresh and the sauces were good. I will definitely come back and try the fries bowl.PS. This place is for Fries lovers",1,,
5,Shamorra B.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",60,131,296,3.0,9/9/2018,"I was in heaven immediately when I found this spot. Cramped very tight takeout that pumps out all types of French fries count me in of course! I was originally going to go with a regular order and see how I like it then I noticed two people who were eating something very delicious looking which was the nacho fries. The kind gentlemen approved of it and even offered me some of theirs. I took their advice thank you drunk guys and decided on ordering the nacho fries. Sadly when I got home , everything was a soggy tasteless mess. My suggestion would be to eat in or when ordering takeout for everything to be packed separately. I would try it again but make sure to eat it when it's fresh out.",3,1,4
6,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,5.0,6/16/2018,"This is a teeny tiny little spot in the Lower East Side but so worth a visit. In addition to fries they have chicken sandwiches and several varieties of loaded fries which are similar to a nacho plate. I tried the banh mi fries and was blown away by how delicious they were. They really managed to nail the intricate flavors of a banh mi, and the combo over fries was unexpected yet perfect. The fries were perfectly crispy and flavorful. Inside there are a some stools and counters to eat in, but it's more of a togo place. Come to this place when you are hungover, drunk, or sober and just want to stick your face in a bowl of fries.",4,3,3

Updated review","Take 2:The second visit was much better than the first one. The staff was very attentive and engaging. Food was served quite quickly. This joint seems very popular with delivery services as I noticed several orders being picked up in the half hour I was present. Ordered two things: Classic chicken sandwich and Belgian fries. Chicken sandwich: was juicy with a rather large filet of dark meat. Very well done and the pickles nicely complimented the rich flavor of the grease (mayo+fried filet). The soft pillowy bun holds together the sandwich well. I tried the sandwich with ketchup, truffle mayo and garlic aioli sauces. Truffle mayo went really well. I would like to try the sriracha mayo next time.Fries: Definitely go with the Belgian fries. They have a thicker cut. They're a bit on the softer side rather than more crispy but nicely salted and go well with most sauces I tried tonight. The only small negative I would say is that the El Diablo sauce does not live up to its name. It's slightly spicy but not overly hot. Still a good compliment to the fries and sandwich with jalapeño flavor. Reminded me of Cuban green sauce.Would come back again to try the banh mi and other flavors of the sandwich.",2,,
8,Arlene Y.,"New York, NY",535,276,287,5.0,5/27/2018,"I'm a huge fan of  fries and this place does not disappoint!! for fries either you choose Belgian or normal fries with different sauce options (which you can sample for free)  and they all creative. I loved the truffle mayo (you can taste the truffle!)They also have loaded fries and I got the bahn mi fries and raclette fries. Both dishes have a generous serving size and the fries were perfectly crispy. My favorite was the bahn mi fries it comes with a spicy sauce, vinegary carrots, and jalapeños. It was a good twist on the classic bahn mi. Definitely want to come back here again to try the icecream with chips and the sandwiches :)",2,,1
9,Victoria C.,"Brighton, MA",20,166,506,4.0,9/5/2018,"This tiny little place is perfect for takeout since there is very limited seating. The garage door window adds a cool feature to this place. I had to try this place out because I love fries! My friends and I ordered the Belgium thick cut fries with white truffle mayo, sriracha mayo, and jalapeno ranch. I love the smell of truffle, so naturally enjoyed the truffle mayo and the sriracha mayo was good as well. I didn't care too much for the jalapeno ranch since it wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be. The fries were a perfect snack to grab on the go and were warm and delicious when you bite into them.",,,
10,Kiki S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,32,26,5.0,10/26/2018,"It was late night and I was stuck in traffic so I decided to check this place out because the sign looked intriguing. I talked to a nice man working there, he had long hair and he was super nice and suggested sauces for me. I ordered 2 regular french fries and he gave me 4 big containers of sauces! They were so fresh and he gave me extra fries in the bag  The best fries I've ever had!",,,
11,Keyawnia R.,"JAMAICA, NY",233,40,26,5.0,11/11/2018,the truffle mayo was to die for!!!!!! the fries were super crisp and soft on the inside!

12,Carmen H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",132,30,58,3.0,5/3/2018,My friend wanted to come here since it was recommended and I love French fries so we had pretty high expectations! The place was pretty easy to find it's kinda small but it's okay since we were the only people there. They have a great selection of sauces and chicken sandwiches but we wanted to keep it classic. We ordered the Belgium thick fries with their chipotle mayo. It was really good! But definitely expect to spend more than you expect. They are a bit pricey.The fries were good it was an okay portion for the size (we got a large) and the sauce was good but nothing stood out to me to the point that I would say this is a must place to stop.,1,,

14,Ying L.,"Brooklyn, NY",243,60,23,4.0,10/2/2018,I was around the area and saw this cute shop for poutine. I decided to give it a try. I ordered the chicken poutine and it was pretty good. It was a mix of sweet and sour because they add jam to the poutine. It might sound a little weird but the jam was my favorite part of the poutine. I will be back to try just the fries with their signature sauces.,2,,1
15,Sandy D.,"New York, NY",260,136,496,3.0,2/22/2018,"Interior: 5/5Came at night and the storefront name was brightly lit! I like, I like. We went at night so there was plenty of seating and the overall store felt comfy and spacious. Plus, the worker had a fire playlist! I felt right at home. Service: 5/5Friendly guy! Lots of smiles. He was nice to pump up the music for us and he had such a nice playlist! Food-Value: 3/5The loaded fries both came out to be $9.80 each. It's pretty much like a Chipotle sized meal. I'd recommend sharing with a friend because fries are filling! Chicken Poutine Loaded Fries: $9.80 // 2/5This was my first time trying poutine! I don't know if it was the store or poutine in general, but I did not enjoy it. I did not see what was so special about it as I could simply just eat a cheese stick with fries and it would taste similar. The fries came with the huge cheese pieces, gravy, fried chicken (pretty good!), and some sort of jam. It sure felt like a Thanksgiving meal! Unfortunately, the fries were too soggy and not enough crisp. They were also not very hot, which is disappointing. Nacho Fries: $9.80 // 3/5I tried some of my friend's after having mine and immediately liked hers more. Hers was a safer choice, with more flavor and way more ingredients going on on her plate than the chicken poutine. But the fries were the same: not crispy and pretty soggy.  Overall, I love the number of toppings and sauces that come with the abundant fries. However, the quality of the fries is pretty disappointing.My friend said she'll go back for the worker. Not the fries.",2,2,2
16,Baby J.,"San Leandro, CA",5,95,4,1.0,11/5/2018,Bit into our chicken sandwich. It was raw inside. Cheese on the poutine was cold.  Nothing special.  Music is awful.,,,
17,Ally L.,"New York, NY",41,145,356,3.0,7/29/2018,"Mediocre sandwich and fries spot. Nothing really stood out. I shared the Banh Mi sandwich and it was pretty tasty. Had a good spicy kick to it. I also ordered the classic French fries with 3 dipping sauces (sauces cost additional). We chose chipotle tomatillo, roasted garlic aioli, and Thai nut. The chipotle tomatillo was refreshing but Thai nut was probably my favorite.",,,
18,Anna J.,"Elmhurst, NY",163,87,181,4.0,9/7/2018,"After a night out seeing a burlesque show this was the only place that wasn't crowded and open. Located in an area that's usually busy for a night out this is probably the best thing you'll find. The fries are not my favorite but they are good and filling for those hungry late night out. They have so many options. I went for a RACLETTE, BACON, onion loaded fries with mango jarritos, and milk and chips for dessert. The fries will fill you up, trust me order fries and a drink. If you're feeling extra hungry get the dessert. All great choices. My friends loved the Bahn Mi fries. You can also create your own. One of my friends had the truffle sauce. It's good! I tried it, if you like truffle go for it! Seriously we went here got seats on the side and a few minutes later a crowd of people just came in. This was the spot to go after a night out!",3,2,3
19,Julia L.,"Queens, NY",1318,174,325,4.0,2/1/2018,"Great spot for some late night munchies! After a night of drinking, my SO and I stopped by 375 Degrees for some fries. He went here the night before for a chicken sandwich and fries by himself, and recommended that we go back. I ordered the Nacho Fries and was surprised to see a Chipotle-sized serving of fries! I will have to say that I'm impressed that 375 doesn't skimp on portions and that it's worth the $9 and change I spent. It was very generous and the fry to topping ratio was awesome. The Nacho fries come with melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and a bunch of other things so make your you eat it quickly -- or have a bunch of people to share with. The lady that took our order (I didn't catch her name) was super friendly and personable! Can't wait to be back the next time I'm hungry and in LES.",1,,3

Updated review","They recently launched a list of Fried Chicken Sandwiches on their menu. It's so delicious and they've done a great job with it! We got the Spicy one and Raclette, which they melt a sheet of cheese and then scrape it onto the chicken. Both were really good and probably one of the best we've had. The chicken was plump and juicy. It was also crispy but not overly crispy. Other than the sandwiches, we always order Belgian fries. It's very crispy and you can choose from a long list of sauces for it!",2,,
21,Jenn C.,"Manhattan, NY",492,194,364,5.0,1/21/2018,"375 just launched their new line of chicken sandwiches - so exciting! I had the raclette one which contained a thick cut of fried chicken with cheese and other toppings. It was delicious - the chicken was fried perfectly (crispy but still really tender) and the toppings and cheese really complimented the sandwich. Excited to try the banh mi one and the spicy one.Additionally, the fries here are really good. I just had the regular one with 3 dipping sauces. My favorite sauce is the white truffle mayo. Excited to try their banh mi and nacho and poutine fries next time!",,,
22,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,4.0,4/27/2018,Very tiny place with a few seats. Definitely come here if you want something unique fries such as banh mi fries. Their website menu has more options than their in person menu. Nacho Fries ($9)- 4/5 These fries were solid and satisfying. Very cheesy with a mix of black bean sauce (which unfortunately made it slightly soggy) but it still tasted great. The fries were nicely loaded and the portions are pretty decent and filled me up.,20,7,15
23,Michelle H.,"Brooklyn, NY",141,87,25,1.0,10/25/2018,"Man, how come I always get the bad batch. It really sucked. I don't know if you're only supposed to get flavor from the sauce, but the fries themselves were plain and just there. I got the garlic aioli sauce and that helped, but it was basic. There are other places that have fries with taste on their own.",,,
24,Janelle B.,"New York, NY",344,87,409,4.0,11/6/2017,"I AM A HUGE FAN!!! I love fries so much, so this spot was all that I could ask for. I've been a few times and every time I have gone it has not disappointed. The fries are cooked to perfection. I would say to order the Belgian fries because the thick cut makes it soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. If you just get just the regular fries, it's just crispy all around. It can be a bit pricey, and they also have a card min of 10 dollars. To be honest, one of the best things on the menu are their sauces. Don't think that you will be sitting down in this restaurant. There are some chairs and tables throughout the restaurant, but they are occupied.",2,,
25,Claudia C.,"Miller Place, NY",22,115,113,5.0,9/11/2017,"Anyone who knows me knows I love fries! I'm always down for fries and this place really hit the spot. Though small (and the AC was not working), the decor is super cute and I love that you can sit out by the window and people watch whilst eating from your fry cone while it rests in the little holes they have carved out in the bar. Now to the fries- I'll start with the portions, which were huge for the price you pay, I got so stuffed in the regular size that I couldn't finish the fries or the sauce so no complaints there. Also I ordered the Thai peanut sauce and it was so so good. My fear for the fries themselves though was that they'd be greasy, as fries often are (especially considering they were fried THREE times) but that was not the case! The fries were cooked to the perfect crispyness and not at all greasy, I also didn't feel super gross after eating them. I would 100% come back here in a heart beat as these were some of the best fries I've had in awhile. And an added perk- they're open until 2am! So you can get your late night fry fix anytime.",4,1,1
26,Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",62,303,270,4.0,8/20/2018,"Yummmmm ! Poutine is my fav! Who doesn't like fried chicken. My bf and I headed to 375 for some late night grub. The chicken was ridiculously soft and juicy. If there's such thing as too soft and juicer then that's how I feel, made me have to check to make sure it was fully cooked. It was a mind fck. The poutine was delicious!! I probably would opt to order the poutine with fried chicken chunks alone the next time I go as a sandwich and poutine is entirely toooo much. The space is small but clean and funky. The staff were friendly and they sell Mexican Coke which is always a win.",,,
27,Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",923,1223,5108,4.0,9/4/2017,"My mom and I ended up checking out this place after seeing them pop up in our Facebook feed. There was a video featuring their Sundae. So I looked them up, checked out their menu and knew we had to go! It was an easy walk from the tenement Museum, which is what brought us to this part of town. We decided to try the Swedish Meatball Poutine because  - 1. I've never had Swedish Meatballs and 2. I've never seen such a thing on a menu. The Fries came covered with the meatballs and gravy, cheese curds and a dallop on jam on the side. It had the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the Salty fries and creamy gravy. What fun!Of course we had the Sundae for dessert. This part was my mom's favorite. This Sundae feature their Vanilla soft serve with honey and potato chips. Their soft serve is icy, just the way my mom likes it. And while the honey that is drizzled on top was a little too sweet for my tastes, I totally loved the texture that the potato chips added - some crunchy and some soggy from soaking up the ice cream!I would totally go back to this place again because the people were friendly and I love me some French fries covered with cheese, gravy, meat - you know, all that good stuff. Just a heads up that this is a tiny place and could potentially be very crowded. We grabbed one of the six bar stools for ourselves no problem on a weekday afternoon before dinner time.",3,,2
28,Morgan H.,"Queens, NY",225,110,171,5.0,3/4/2018,"This place has been bookmarked for a while so when I finally got the chance to go I was thrilled. I got the nachos fries while my friend got the banh mi fries. For $9 each it seems pricey but the quality and taste was delicious. They're generous with the portions and the workers were super friendly. The place is small, but cozy and orders are made fresh and quickly. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back again to try the other fries they have!",,,
29,Ester C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,41,113,5.0,7/24/2018,"Fries were decent, nothing special. The seasoning on the fries was incredibly salty so I would recommend asking for less salt.

30,Salina T.,Hong Kong,94,43,212,4.0,7/19/2017,"I stopped by 375 degrees for a quick take-out by ordering a small classic French fry with white truffle sauce. The fries were delicious and I truly enjoyed the white truffle sauce! If I had the chance I would drench everything I eat in that sauce. Unfortunately though the cashier forgot my order after three different parties after me recieved their food, so I would rate customer service as mediocre. Upon asking about my order, I recieved an excuse about having to make the ice cream dish first or else it would melt. It's funny though because I ordered before that party. If it wasn't for the guy in the back who noticed he didn't have any other orders to fulfill, I probably would have never gotten my fries. Thank you though for the free sauce upgrade, I understand it gets busy! Usually I rate restaurants holistically and even though I would like to give the place 5 stars, I thought about whether I would want to go back to the place and it was a ""no"" unfortunately. I do think this place should be more frequented so other people can see whether their service is any better!",1,1,
31,Kyle P.,"New York, NY",163,259,226,4.0,1/7/2018,"This a great small fry shop. It's has 3 sizes of fry orders and regular and thick cut fries. They have over 8 dipping sauces and a few custom orders for fries too. Their portions are big for a regular or large. They have about 6 stools to sit on inside, they are a small window shop. The garlic aioli and frite sauces are good. They have a few sandwiches and milk and chips to. I will be back to try out some other things next time.",1,,

The fries were crispy and they gave a lot for a small size! I got the white truffle Mayo sauce and I didn't love it, I'm not into this kind of mayo (I like the Japanese Mayo tho). I would stick to the classic sauce, since it is for free.  Small size: $5 Sauce: $1.25 Total: $6.80 plus tax.",,,
33,Millie R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,236,1227,5.0,8/4/2017,"375 is a cute little spot. My husband and stopped by after work. The staff is super chill & sweet. I had the Swedish meatball fry plate it was decent, the fries were very good but the meatballs and sauce I personally feel were missing a bit of a kick. My husband had the nacho fries this is were the flavor was hanging out at. Everything about it was soooooo good. The fries, guacamole, chicken, sour cream, and cheese played very well off each other. I stole lots of bites off of the hubsters plate.Lastly, the milk and chips dessert. Oh boy was this good. I thought I would not like this at all, and I was so wrong. I underestimated something I thought would be an ambitious attempt at a dessert. I was wrong, it was oh so good. The fresh, crunchy potato chips blended perfectly into the soft serve, then the added sweetness from the honey drizzle blended so perfectly. So if you have anything here definitely get the nacho fries they are on point!!! Do not skip the milk and chips. take your spoon and blend it together, it resembles a milk dessert once, you crush the chips into the ice cream.",,,

37,Lissan C.,"New York, NY",24,118,361,1.0,10/19/2017,"Big time overrated! I hate to do this but I made the trip to visit to this place because there was a lot of buzz to this place, especially the Raclette Cheese over the fries. When I asked for the raclette cheese, the counter person said it's not available today and pointed at the heater that heats the raclette cheese trying to tell me that it's not turned on. So there goes my big disappointment but I had to try something since I travelled all the way out there. So I went for Banh Mi Fries. Waited for under 10 mins, it has the instagram look but then the fries are not meeting the standard. They were not crispy and nothing special, almost towards soggy under the Banh Mi ingredients of pork crumbles, shredded carrots & daikons , and a bunch of sauce, sriracha.. mayo... green jalapeños sauce. Just a whole bunch of stuff thrown together for $11. Ambiance was not happening when I was there, we were there with 2 others. Really nothing to shout about, people should stop exaggerating. Sorry for the disappointment but I just want to be honest.",6,1,1
38,Sandy C.,"New York, NY",20,104,237,3.0,11/18/2017,"A bit disappointed at this place. They seem to have many great options and the photos look great but it wasn't anything special to me. Initially, I wanted to try their fish and chips but it was sold out so I ended up getting the nacho fries. Everything on it was good but it was too overwhelming. It was a mix of warm and cold ingredients. I enjoyed eating the guacamole the most. Since the fries were all soggy, I think I would prefer it crunchy. IF I was to come back again, I will only try their fries with different dips... but I would rather go to Pommes Frites for that. It wasn't as big as I expected for almost $10. I felt like I gained 15 pounds eating that.",1,1,1

It is a welcome change in a world where soggy, overdone or salty fries are ubiquitous. They make good fries, however I am not entirely sure the third frying is necessary.

They also have ""Flavors"", which are loaded combos, like Okonomiyaki and a Swedish Meatball Poutine.

45,Antonio A.,"Morris Plains, NJ",80,3,1,5.0,9/22/2018,Amazing poutine and cheap too for the city. Definitely a place to go if you're craving poutine and/or Belgian fries in NYC. Would recommend!,,,
46,David N.,"Queens, New York, NY",0,7,11,4.0,9/4/2018,Overall great experience the sandwich was amazing chicken fried to perfection cheese melted garlic mayo was great only reason i rated 4 stars and not 5 is because the cheddar sauce is actually nacho sauce in fact the only reason I didn't order the nacho fries is because I was a bit skeptical on having nacho cheese with my fries and tbh it was ok the next time I return I'll give them a try since everything was spot on,,,
47,Lesley C.,"New York, NY",504,336,167,4.0,7/13/2018,"Awesome fries definitely worth trying -- i had the banh mi and nacho fries, both of which I'd recommend! Also, each order was more than enough for one person.",2,,1
48,Ritza A.,"Houston, TX",284,102,31,2.0,10/21/2017,I tried the French cut and Belgium cut fries and preferred the French cut. I honestly feel like the fries would be better if they were just twice cooked like in Belgium rather than thrice cooked. After they were a few minutes old they had a similar taste as day old fries that you reheated in the toaster oven. This place does not compare to the old pommes frites. (RIP pommes frites.),,,
49,jasmine m.,"New York, NY",15,3,7,5.0,7/21/2018,The service was prompt and attentive. The fries were freshly fried. The choice of dipping sauces were vast. I had a combination of the belgium style fries and thin cut. My favorite sauces were the garlic aioli and the white truffle. I highly recommend you to try their fries!!,1,,
50,Hanyi Q.,"New York, NY",240,40,71,5.0,5/2/2018,"Came here in the afternoon for a late lunch with my friend. We tried the bah mi fries, bah mi chicken sandwich( it was spicy and favorable taste so good!)  so nacho fries, and their new sweet treat which is milk n' chips ( vanilla ice cream covered in fried chips great combo) all the food was delicious and tasty the bah mi sandwich really surprised on how amazing it was! I'm definitely going to come back and bring more friends :)",,,
51,Aleyni A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",72,18,20,5.0,3/18/2018,"The spicy chicken sandwich though... AMAZING! The fries are really good but it all depends on the sauces, my favorite is El Diablo. I think its really Mexican salsa verde haha. We got three sandwiches, regular size fries and 3 sauces for just under $50. The place is very small so seating is limited, be prepared to wait for (or eat) your food outside if you're come during rush hour.",1,,
52,HamzaHoney B.,"New York, NY",2,27,2,3.0,10/18/2017,"I was hungry and wanted to try something different. I opted for these nacho fries. The portion was huge (too much for me). I asked for no jalapeños and for the cheese sauce on the side since the cashier told me it was a little spicy. All of the Mexican topping were great - not too salty or spicy and very favorable.However, the fries themselves weren't that great. They were thick and kinda stiff (not in a good way either). I'm glad I ordered this dish but I probably won't get it again ...... I'll give this place a 2nd try and just buy plain fries with a sauce on the side.",,,
53,Aakruti V.,"Manhattan, NY",364,73,117,3.0,7/24/2017,"I was really excited when I spotted a shop that said that their fries were ""thrice fried."" I enjoyed eating here. I got the smallest size because I wasn't very hungry but the portion was still pretty big. I got the regular fries with the truffle mayonnaise, and it was really good. (they also have I also tasted a sample of the jalapeno cilantro sauce, but it was a bit spicy for me. The fries themselves were crunchy and first, but they stopped being crunchy pretty quickly. The outsides remained lightly crispy, but it wasn't as crunchy as I thought it would be, considering that these fries were purportedly fried three times. Another complaint I have is that if you want any sauce (besides normal ketchup or mustard), you have to pay extra for it. I understand that the sauce portions are pretty big (I didn't even get 2/3 of the way through mine), so my suggestion is to have smaller sauce portions, but to get the first sauce for free (and pay for each sauce after that). Otherwise, I think it's too expensive to pay that much for fries and no get at least one sauce with it. Otherwise, the staff was really friendly, and even though they were busy, they maintained a positive attitude. The place was clean, and the décor was pretty cool.",2,,
54,Julie H.,"New York, NY",199,22,1,5.0,6/25/2018,Most amazing fried chicken sandwich I have ever eaten in my entire life. When my lease is up on my apartment I will be telling my broker to find an apartment as close as possible to 375 Degrees. Forget anything else about an apartment. You just need this place close by.,1,1,
55,Jessica S.,"Columbus, OH",157,106,229,4.0,9/2/2017,Stopped in for a quick to-go bite. Got an order of fries and the roasted garlic aioli dipping sauce. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside--a really great fry. I enjoyed the dipping sauce; I'm a sucker for garlic. I'd like to come back and try their loaded fries.,,,
56,Arielle R.,"Bronx, NY",21,67,127,5.0,8/8/2017,"Came here on Saturday evening at around 10:30 with a friend before hitting up a local bar/club. Goal was to avoid getting TOO wasted and vomiting because of lack of food. We ordered the NACHO FRIES! And man was it AH-MAZE-ZING!The plate was 8 dollars and was large enough for me and my friend to share. In fact it was so much that we had to unfortunately toss some away because we could not finish it. The FRIES were fresh and made on the spot, super crispy and deliciously seasoned. Topped with all the key components of classic nachos. Cheese, Jalapeños, and chicken. The spot stays open till 4 in the morning for all the local drunkards coming out of the bars with the munchies, perfect food to soak up a full nights worth of drinking. The fry combinations seemed endless which means I will just have to come back here to try EVERYTHING! Really great concept, located in the perfect spot! Will definitely be back soon.",,,1
57,Mian W.,"New York, NY",78,7,50,4.0,1/19/2018,The recently introduced fried chicken sandwiches are great. I had the raclette one and it was delicious. The fries are good too but not spectacular. I had the Swedish poutine but the sauce and toppings were a little cold and the fries were cooked just ok. Also get the potato chip soft serve which surprised me. I didn't think that would work at all but it ended up being my favorite thing from here!,1,,
58,Paalika B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",241,280,348,4.0,1/23/2018,Huge portions. We tried the nacho and bahn mi fries. Both were delicious (preferred the bahn mi) and the staff was amazingly friendly. The space is somewhat small but great place to grab a quick snack.,,,1
59,Wen Na Z.,"Ticonderoga, NY",428,110,139,3.0,2/11/2018,"As a fries/potato fanatic, I was ecstatic to come across this place. We ordered the chicken poutine loaded fries ($9). The flavor and the pieces of fried chicken was delicious, but under the gravy, chunks of cheese, and jelly, the fries were really soggy. But I'd definitely come back to try their other loaded fries options or just their fries alone.",,,
60,Juliane S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",19,25,18,5.0,8/15/2017,"Who doesn't love fries? And I am talking, the best fries I have ever had quite possibly. First off, everyone who works there is kind and helps you on a path if you feel lost. Second, you have the choice of two different cut of fries, Belgian or regular. I would personally go with the Belgian, it was perfectly cut and golden brown with a slight crunch and fluffy on the inside (drooling thinking of it again). I ordered three dipping sauces, jalapeño-cilantro ranch, white truffle mayo and roasted garlic aioli (this one was my favorite). You can also get loaded fries there which come with toppings and the milk and chips dessert. So, originally I came specifically for that dessert and then ordered fries instead because looking at everyone eat them was just torture and i wanted it for myself and I got to full to have the dessert. But the next day I did go back for it and man that was GOOD. I'm talking a soft serve milk based ice cream that was not really sweet but it was loaded with a really sweet syrup, I believe it was a honey butter syrup. Then was the potato chips, sliced almonds and some kind of granola that was AMAZING. The people here really know what they are doing. Highly recommend.",,,
61,Melanie F.,"Orlando, FL",78,49,53,5.0,4/16/2018,Fried and chicken sandwiches were delicious! I wanted to try the milk and chips but was too full. Next time!,,,

63,Trang V.,"North Bergen, NJ",72,12,22,5.0,8/27/2017,"Stopped here to get my fries fix and this place definitely delivered! Very similar to Pomme Frites in the West Village We got the Belgian cut fries with a peanut, tomatillo, and another spicy sauce. Fries were crispy and sauces were flavorful.  They have tons more sauces to try, and I liked that their ""regular"" serving size is adequate for one person, compared to other places where you're guaranteed eater's remorse with the smallest size. We also tried nachos loaded fries - crispy fries on bottom with assortment of toppings. This is basically a hearty meal so be prepared - it's very filling.Shop itself was clean, had bar style seating, and had open windows so you can people watch on Ludlow.",,,
64,Israel P.,"Miami Beach, FL",54,157,131,3.0,1/14/2018,This place was pretty good order some nacho fries that was quite delicious but unfortunately they didn't have the ice cream machine working and also didn't seem like the actual food was cooked or prepare fresh when I order it look like everything was already kind of made but as me being drunk I still ate it and of my own perception when I was eating it I was in heaven. The natural fries were the ones recommended by the guy very nice quiet avoiding to interact that's possible maybe because we were just there trying to have a good time and get some good food but definitely was something that I didn't regret ordering and it was really good. Sad that the ice cream machine wasn't working at a regular weekend night or everything should be functioning due to high traffic customers that should be eye priority because myself is not even from New York and came along way to check this place out and others that I bookmarked in my Yelp app,,,
65,Andrew W.,"Manhattan, NY",28,2,3,5.0,4/4/2018,Dropped by for a quick bite. Food was really really satisfying. Fries are super crunchy and tasty. Would definitely come back here in the future.,,,
66,Nancy V.,"Silver Spring, MD",816,29,58,4.0,1/20/2018,Came here on a late summer day so we were really hot by the time we got here. The place itself is pretty small so you're a little squished if there are other people there. My friends and I got a regular fry cone with roasted garlic aioli sauce and split the okonomiyaki fries. I don't know what I expected thrice fried fries to taste like but the fries themselves were a nice crunchy although I expected them to be a little crunchier. The aioli sauce was really tasty so I'd definitely recommend that sauce if you go here. The okonomiyaki fries were pretty good too! The ginger was a nice touch and it tasted like a yummy potato takoyaki dish with the fish flakes and sauce. I'm not entirely sure if I'd go out of my way to come back but if I was in the area again I'd stop by to try their other loaded fries.,,,
67,Joyce C.,"Queens, NY",0,59,135,4.0,8/13/2017,"Came here Saturday afternoon, in a very quiet area of lower east side Manhattan. The shop is pretty small, only seats about 7 people. Despite that, when I came, it was pretty empty, also only one worker at the time. I tried the bahn mi fries which were pretty good. Only thing is that they're a little bit too spicy. Besides that, the flavor was very good, and the fries were extra crispy and loaded to the max. I was worried that there would be not enough sauce for all the fries and the fries on the bottom would be plain, but I did not have a problem at all. The portions are also very large, enough to feed 2-3 people (I wouldn't recommend eating this alone unless you really love fries and don't mind eating a whole bowl of it) The worker was super nice and attentive! He brought the food to us, offered to clean the table, and checked up on us once in a while to see if we enjoyed it (A+ for service). A must try if you are in the area!",,,

The fries are ""thrice fried"" meaning they're fried three times. My fries we perfectly cooked, and I got three dipping sauces for $3.50, the frite sauce, chili & garlic sauce, and the white truffle mayo. I liked all of them, maybe the chili and garlic the most. Definitely want to come back!",,,
70,Hamilton W.,"New York, NY",45,166,9,5.0,12/11/2017,"Fries with sauces or loaded with random stuff. They have two types, skinny and thick. Get the skinny ones, and skip the fish and chips.

Hopefully they hire more people there was only 1 person working. This place is known for their fries. It's cooked three times. And stays crispy. the regular/Belgium fries were about 6$ for small and an extra 3.50 for three sauces. They had a variety of sauces such as gorgonzola mayo and garlic aioli  .  Reminded me of pomme frites? By st marks that burnt down. I recommend the loaded fries. They had a poutine one with meatballs, Nachos fries , a Japanese sounding one and the bahn mi one. Each plateful was roughly $8-$9. We ordered the bahn mi. It came with cheese , pickled carrots and daikon and some spicy sirracha and spicy green sauce with egg on top. I really wanted to like it but the salty sour spicy combination was not my cup of tea. They had a salty sweet potato chip with soft serve ice cream dessert for $6. That was actually pretty good. I left satisfied. But my friend was still hungry. Filling for most woman. Not enough to share for men. I'd come again and give this place another try. There's three other loaded fries to taste lol.",,,

74,Cath L.,"New York, NY",548,20,105,3.0,10/7/2017,"The fries were indeed extra crispy. The white truffle mayo sauce is pretty bomb, their green sauce is a little too chunky but its got a strong kick for people who love spicy (can't be compared to the pho pho sauce tho). The regular fries are more worth than the loaded ones in my opinion. After 5 minutes the nacho fries got really soggy so the fries lost that crunchy texture. Overall, interesting store with lots of attitude (in a good way), friendly staff and love the constant innovation.",1,1,

The moment I had the chance it was cocktails and fries for dinner. We shared the loaded nachos and Banh Mi fries, we also got some side dipping sauces which were not necessary, think they're best served with regular fries. The loaded nachos were good, but a little too soggy for me. The Banh Mi fries were amazing though, and the egg on top was the perfect touch. The only problem, they dont have knives so i couldn't cut my egg... so maybe bring a plastic knife with you when you go ;)",2,1,2

The meatballs were slightly hard and dry. Stale tasting. The cranberry jam was okay. Tasted and looked like it came out of a can which it usually does anyway. I do wish the food was hotter so the cheese would melt into more gooey goodness. I think poutine cheese is usually chunks like this though.,,,

Just salty enough. Just steamy enough. Generous portions. I on ocassion by 2 orders and drop one off at my job just 2 blocks down. They make your order on demand. No sitting around waiting to be chosen laying around fries. Nice. Sauces: I've had the korean ketchup, nice. The truffle mayo, boo, I just don't like truffle anything. The jalapeno ranch, YUCK, just me. And the thai nut is all the crack I need. I now get 2 with my fries. And I just don't dunk or dip, I use the fry like it was a spoon and savor. So delicious. So nutty, and gingery and creamy and addictive. The first times I got the regular fries, but today I got the belgium ones, which are obviously thicker, but am just a regular fry guy. The thicker ones are great though. In a country like ours where fries either come paired with just about all sandwich items or are always around, I am sick of the fry game. Everybody is a critic and everybody thinks they know where to get the best fry. Well that would have to mean that they too are coming here.",,,

We got the Swedish poutine and the fish and chips. They were each about $9 each which I assumed wouldn't go very far. However, the portions we got were huge and we couldn't finish everything. But luckily they were very good. My Canadian friend approved of the poutine in case they need a seal of approval. I wish I had gotten a sauce for the extra fries that came with the fish but the tartar came for free. Are they better than Pommes Frites in the West Village? Ehh..No. But they were still pretty good plus they have more meal type options here rather than just carbs if you're looking for actual dinner.",,1,

She was very friendly and helpful in picking things out and was very knowledgeable about the menu. ( you'd be surprised how many owners don't know there menu) . We tried a few things and few sauces and all were amazing. We got the fries which were very very crunchy and tried the Siracusa sauce and two others . The siracha sauce was by far the best one . We even tried there chicken sandwiches and they were good . All around good the only reason it's not getting a 5 is because they don't have there own bathroom,,,

105,Mona L.,"Arden Heights, Staten Island, NY",17,6,6,5.0,5/22/2017,Omg. I had the Fish & Chips and it was the best I ever had.

108,James H.,"Queens, NY",0,3,1,5.0,7/3/2017,If you love French fries. This place is a must go. You can grab and go and snack on some fries with a 3 sauce combo or get some of the loaded options. They even do a milk and chips ice cream! Vanilla ice cream with some crumbled honey butter chips on the bottom with apple crumbs and more chips on top. It's also open late for anyone who needs a late like snack or munch in the les.,,,
109,Wendy C.,"New York, NY",87,3,7,5.0,5/24/2017,What a hidden gem! Those were the best French Fries I ever had. They're crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Just perfect. Definitely pick the 3 sauces combo (Thai Nut is my favorite!) as they're all delicious and perfect with the fries. Will be back again and again.,,,
110,Bernard O.,"New York, NY",51,23,2,5.0,6/3/2017,Banh mi fries hit the spot. Loved the shredded pickled veggies & perfectly cooked egg + garlic aioli + malt vinegar. Little long of a wait...but to be expected for a made-to-order fry place that just opened/doesn't yet have the volume of a place like pommes frites.,,,
111,Grace H.,"Edison, NJ",0,1,1,5.0,6/26/2017,The soft serve ice cream is too die for!!!!! Fires are fresh and made right on the spot. They have 10+ sauces for the fires. Def need to try!!!#,,,
112,Carmine T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1052,10,7,5.0,10/10/2017,The Swedish Meatball Poutine will make you slap your mama. It was true authentic poutine you'd find in Montreal. Cheese curds and all.,,,
113,Justin L.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",13,1,0,5.0,5/25/2018,This is the perfect spot if you want to grab something to munch on. I love this spot and the people who work here. The service is spot on mate! My favorite thing to get is definitely the regular cut fries with either the garlic aioli or the white truffle mayo.,,,
114,Tiffany G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,5/17/2018,Chicken sandwich was so much better than I expected. Friendly helpful staff is always a plus. Oh and the friends are amazing. I recommend the cheddar cheese sauce. Has a nice kick to it.,,,
115,R P.,"Boston, MA",52,18,0,5.0,4/5/2018,Excellent loaded fries and Jose provided exceptional service.  If you like fries you don't want to miss this place.,,,
116,Katherine H.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",10,27,45,3.0,7/14/2017,"I had the Swedish Poutine and my son had the nacho fries. Although the combinations were interesting, they lacked that burst of flavor (in our opinion). However, we also didn't get any sauces so next time, we shall try the fries with a sauce. So, stay tuned for round two.",1,,
117,Kaci C.,"Georgetown, TX",377,2,0,5.0,4/25/2018,"We got the nacho fries and a small order of the Belgian cut fries. Both were AMAZING! This is definitely the place to go to get your fry fix! Also, Mona was very sweet and offered many helpful recommendations and samples of all the sauces! Great people and great fries!",,,
118,Eva Z.,"New York, NY",27,43,771,3.0,6/25/2017,"Been wanting to come try this place after I found out about it through a video on Facebook. I LOVE pommes frites in the west village, so I knew I had to check this place out too. I came on a Sunday night around 6pm and the place was empty. Its a rather small place with around 9 bar stools in total. However, the storefront is hard to miss with its giant flashing sign. I ordered the fish and chips. It took awhile for it to come out - around 15mins. When it finally came out, my first impression was damn, thats a lot of food. Well, mostly fries. It came with 3 pieces of fish, 3 small pieces of fries pickles, and the rest is fries. Overall, I was not impressed by the fish. There was waaaay too much batter and barely any fish. The batter was really salty. It also tasted very oily. I actually felt sick to my stomach after I left. The fries were good, but I think I still prefer pommes frites. What I do like about this place is that they offer both regular fries and belgian fries. The fish and chips comes with belgian fries, so maybe i'll come back to try the regular ones.",1,1,
119,Lauren S.,"Manhattan, NY",170,2,0,5.0,2/25/2018,"This restaurant has amazing food and even better management. I came here last night right before closing after being out and I cannot stress enough how well the manager handled the situation that went on with a drunk and disgruntled customer. More restaurant managers need to follow her example. On a different note, there is nothing you can get here to eat that won't be good. Definitely get the fries with cheddar cheese sauce, you won't be disappointed!",,,
120,Lucy M.,"New York, NY",49,3,1,2.0,5/14/2017,Guuuys please change your fry oil. I worked for 7 years in a fast food restaurant that excelled at cutting costs so I know what fries cooked old dirty fry oil tastes like. Nobody should be paying for that. Giving 2 stars because the fish in the fish'n'chips pack was actually pretty decent.,3,,
121,Martha Z.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",0,19,0,4.0,3/14/2018,think we were the first customers today. we were greeted by a really nice young guy who then at the end asked us if we were satisfied with our meal. He wore an apron and was very clean.,,,
122,Mimi Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,2,5.0,7/31/2017,"Love love their fries! We originally wanted to order the okonohitaki loaded fries, but they were out so we opted for the banh mi loaded fries, which DID NOT disappoint at all. It was very flavorful and the fries were very crispy. The spices mixed well together, although it can do without the cheese. We also tried their French fries with their wasabi mayo sauce. We were actually going to midtown to meet a friend. I had asked if she wanted any fries, And had every intention to share with her. However by the time we got to her, there might have been 5 fries left for her. I guess we would have to go back together because those fries were definitely hard to resist.",,,
123,Milton C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,3/3/2018,"Staff was friendly, chicken sandwich was decent, but the fries were squishy, not crispy, and served luke warm. Also took a surprising amount of time to get my order considering I was the only person in the restaurant. For a place that advertises as specializing in fries, they missed the mark.",,,
124,Thelma B.,"San Antonio, TX",19,17,13,2.0,7/10/2017,"Limp, limp, limp from first fry to last fry when served with wet toppings. Don't expect to taste a crispy fry unless you order fries with sauce on the side. (see video). There is no difference in the fries than if you make them at home and top with lots of wet toppings. I asked for salt (I like salty fries and they said ""We already salted them"". So what? I like salty fries. The place is super small. Can't be more then 100 square feet seating. They have narrow counters with stools and can seat ten at a time. I would not recommend a special trip to try this place.",,,
125,Cherie T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/30/2018,Can you please ensure that the hours posted on yelp and on your website are accurate? We've been there twice before 1030 pm and you were closed both times. Bad business.,,,
126,Margeaux B.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,2,5.0,1/19/2018,This was worth the trip! The fries are delicious. I got the nacho fries and they did not disappoint. The sauces were equally scrumptious. The truffle sauce was my favorite!,,,
127,Randolph H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/27/2018,Cute cashier named Aubrey was nice and gave me a good time ordering. I ordered the poutine fries which were good but soggy. Overall really nice little family business. Go when Aubrey's there he's really funny,,,
128,Rosa M.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",0,13,1,4.0,6/3/2017,"Really amazing fries! Sturdy, but soft on the inside with a slight crunch to some ends. The sriracha mayo dipping sauce .... let's just say I wanna put it on everything I eat!",,,
129,Emerson F.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,5.0,6/2/2017,Really good and crunchy! The saucy are really good and I recommend the nut thai sauce and the loaded poutin or whatever its called,,,
130,Jephany Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,31,8,3.0,9/23/2017,"Went here the other day with my boyfriend and we got the regular sized thrice cooked fries with garlic aoli and truffle mayo as the sauces, along with the milk and chips. The fries were crunchy, Yum. However they were pretty brown.. I understand that theyre cooked 3 times, but I think the oil was either overused, or as other would say ""dirty"", or they were fried in too long to the point it looked (and sometimes taste) like they were burnt. The fries left both my boyfriends and my throat feeling itchy (the feeling you get when you know you're about to get a sore throat). Other than that, the truffle mayo was good, you could actually taste it whereas the garlic aoli had no garlic flavor to us. The milk and chips, my boyfriend enjoyed. I didn't really like it.. The chips weren't crunchy they were stale to me (he preferred it soft) the bottom of the cup was drenched in honey and crumpled chips, which proved to be too sweet. The ice cream itself, the taste of milk was so strong to me that I thought it was spoiled (i knew it wasn't because I didn't wake up the next day with an upset stomach). But my boyfriend enjoyed it because he likes the taste of milk. Overall the experience wasn't all that bad, the people at the register disappeared every now and then but I'm sure they have a reason to. Overall, I will come back to try their combination plates!",,,
131,Alex D.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,3,0,1.0,11/7/2017,"First off, my friend and I walk into 375 and the employee was on her phone wearing a very scandalous outfit. It took her a few minutes to even realize we were even in the shop. On the menu it said free sample sauces and I asked her to try the white truffle mayo. This woman looked at me like I had three heads. She had the audacity said ""really?"" as if we were asking for a pound of gold... Eventually I got a sample (the sauce was horrible) and the woman began to talk badly about my friend and I in Spanish. She also reached into my bag and ate a few french fries thinking that i wouldn't see. My meal was 15 dollars and i received no change, so i went up to the counter to simply ask for my change, and this disgusting lady said no. I ordered the nacho fries, and upon receiving my order, the food was cold, soggy, and the fries were soaking wet. Horrible experience, and i will be reaching out to management to make sure this  woman is fired.",,,
132,Aravind N.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,9/23/2017,Way sub bar compared to pommes frites near NYU. Sauces are good but the fries are awful.,,,
133,Kie I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,2.0,9/12/2017,The fries were fried so hard that the insides were empty and my jaw hurt chewing through them....$8?,,,
134,Nancy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,10/7/2017,"These fries do not disappoint. Flavorful. Crispy.  Not greasy.  Leaves you wanting more.  And the Garlic Aoli, Korean Ketchup, and Malt Vinegar are muah!  Definitely coming back!! 5/5",,,
135,Hari M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,8/23/2017,"I don't understand why someone would open a shop solely dedicated to french fries unless the fries were truly exceptional. Sadly these are not. They are fine. But go to almost any steakhouse and you will find a crispier and more consistently great product. Perhaps I was expecting too much from a place that only sells fries (for upwards of $6), but I was disappointed.",,,
136,Miaka Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,8,28,5.0,5/26/2017,"I Purchased a recycle tote bag and got free fries. Love the way they service. They let me try all the sauces then I pick 3 topping of them for only $3.50. Dunno how they make the fries, taste so different . Good place for hangout with friends .",1,1,1
137,Amy R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,1/10/2018,"After first visiting this place in early November 2017 I would have given 5 stars hands down, the fries were extremely fresh, hot and crispy even after being drenched in gravy and melty cheese...which was amazing. But I believe the ownership has changed and I was super disappointed with the fries today. (The service was wonderful however, shout out to the guy at the counter for being so cool, five stars for you!) We ordered the loaded poutine fries, which had changed from Swedish meatball to fried chicken, without the incredible jam. We also ordered the raclette cheese fries w/ bacon and onions. We waited around 6-7 minutes, got our fries to go and took them less than a block to Iggy's down the street. We sat down to eat immediately. We noticed right away the fries were not crispy like our first visit, nor were they even hot. The raclette cheese and the cheese curds on the poutine were cold and not even slightly melted. It seemed like we had gotten pre-made bowls from a shelf. We went back to have the poutine made again, however the next batch wasn't any warmer or crispier. We had been looking forward to coming back after our first mindblowing experience, but we will not be returning in the future. For a place with the name 375°, you would at least expect the fries to be warm enough to melt some cheese.",,,
138,Brooks K.,"Manhattan, NY",246,55,3,1.0,7/7/2017,Overpriced and overrated fries. They won't even give you free tap water to help your thirst. Avoid.,,,
139,Olivia C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,10,2,3.0,7/11/2017,"I don't prefer fries super well done, so I was hesitant about checking out a place that specifically advertises frying their fries three times. You can choose between classic ""French"" and thicker Belgian-style fries. I chose the classic, but I'm thinking maybe the Belgian would've been slightly better for a fan of not-so-overdone fries. They have a large selection of dipping sauces as well and are very open to letting you sample them. I asked which sauces were the spiciest, tried all, and picked the one that I liked the flavor of best - chili garlic. Overall, I don't love this place yet, but I think it might've been due to my poor choices. In my opinion, the chili garlic sauce is too chunky and doesn't work well as a dipping sauce for fries. It has more of the consistency of salsa. I'd definitely opt for another, although the flavor was good. If you like overdone fries, you would love this place. I'll give this place another try, but it might just not be for me. Also, it took a while to make our fries, likely because they had to fry them three times, so just keep that in mind if you're checking this place out in a rush.",1,,
