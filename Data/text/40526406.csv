0,Billy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0.0,5.0,6/25/2018,Was here last Friday until closing. Excellent service.This place is terrific! I felt like John Wick inside a Continental Hotel having a refreshment!!!,,,
1,Emanuel C.,"New York, NY",550,141,305,4.0,10/8/2018,"This is one of those places which excels at giving you 5-star service. Be aware you will be paying for that service. You will be attended to by various staff at all times and will be paying for the simplest of amenities...like water. Before you come here you need to be aware you will also need to pay a specific amount for food and cigar. Minimally, specifically for table service, it is a minimum of $30 per person in food and you must order at least a $15 cigar.In general, your expectation is somewhere in the vicinity of $30-$40 for food, somewhere in the $20-$25 range for a cigar and $10-30 for a drink. Figure you will spend $50-$100 per person for an evening of expected fine dining, high-end drinks, and a solid cigar. Let's break this down. I have very expensive taste, I love Scotch, Cigars, Leather, nice cars, travel, and dining out. But I also am sensible enough to know what I am consuming and the value it has. I have no problem negotiating when the situation calls for it. But I also have enough patience and respect to accept certain status quo's.That said, most of the cigars here are overpriced. While NY has a tax on cigars that make most of us cigar lovers cringe, the prices here are a little outrageous. Alcohol pricing is also out of touch with normal prices. As an example, a few of the drams I could take from various scotches here were roughly 1-2oz (30-60ml) and half the price of the bottles themselves which carry 750ml. Do that math. two drinks and I bought the bottle...Which have 7-8 to 15 drinks depending on if you take single or doubles. If you have money to burn, you don't care. If you do care a bit, this is not sensible.So really, how does a place like this stay in business? There is a lot of money in NYC and a lot of people with that money who want a type of environment that is an oasis from the city. They want 5-star service and they want their needs catered to. While I fit within this category, I am burdened by being an educated consumer and knowing what things cost and where to get them at the right price. For example. I can choose to pay $80 per bottle of Macallan 12 in most places in NYC or I can, every other day I am in Hoboken (along with my wife) pick up the same bottle for $60. I can buy a Macanudo Inspirado White---an unmistakably wonderful cigar here for $24 or at various other locations for $15 or online for an average $7 a stick. There is a cognitive dissonance in this city with value matching price. But places like these make for an experience you almost have to ignore the ridiculous pricing. So why 4 stars? Service: 5 StarTobacconist Knowledge: 4 StarAmbiance: 5 StarPrice: 1 StarLocation: 5 StarSelection: 4 starsHumidor: ???As I mentioned the service was exceptional. Our waitress was excellent, I detected a bit of awkwardness because my friend with me is not really a cigar smoker and indulged me in my passtime. But overall she was solid and on point. She did recommend a specific type of cigar after I mentioned I had just finished something medium-full bodied and would only like something mild. She recommended something she liked but that particular cigar was a Nicaraguan cigar heavy in powerful Esteli Tobacco...so I question the general knowledge. You give someone that who isn't as aware of cigars, something that powerful, they will have a very bad experience especially if they are not used to it. But she wasn't pushy. The selection of alcohol was absolutely insane...it took me a moment to see everything they had available. I was looking for something I don't normally find often, like Hibiki 17 or Hibiki 21. But their prices on drams as I mentioned above were a bit out of sync with reality and they did not have Hibiki (unfortunately). Their cigar selection was also solid but lacking in some areas, but overall, solid. Again, I'm used to buying most of the cigars they listed for half the price I saw. Overall: 4 (really a 3.4 but I am averaging in a 5 for the humidor and giving them the benefit of the doubt). This club, like many special cigars, is a place you come to for very special occasions. Not something I would do often. But we celebrated a financial victory for our company yesterday so it was a worthwhile experience over drnks and sliders.",2,,
2,Davaish S.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",63,245,170,4.0,7/25/2018,"Always a great experience.  I have been here a couple times and love the cigar choices, apps and the lamb. This place is ideal for that old time NYC feel of whiskey and smoke and meat.  If you do not like smoke and it bothers you do not come (I only say this because we brought a friend once who had to leave because her eyes were watering from the smoke).  The service is incredible and it feels like you have 6 waiters.  The matches are fun keep sake, and I loved the rack of lamb, the nachos, the chicken sliders and the shrimp and sausage.Dress code is pretty strict so button downs/jackets and nice dresses.  No sneakers or flip flops or torn jeans.Will be back this week for a third visit this year too!",,,
3,Paul W.,"Manhasset, NY",216,233,194,4.0,6/24/2018,"I don't smoke or drink now for over 25 years (thanks AA) but my friend was in from out of town and suggested that we talk here after dinner. Nice people serving and sitting. Impressive room, service was low key but well done: the presentation of the cigar was nicely executed. No one rushed us or hovered. It was noisy but not loud: I could have a conversation without difficulty. I'm not much for this kind of thing, but if I was going to go, I would most definitely suggest going here. Recommended.",4,1,1
4,Stuart G.,"Bal Harbour, FL",126,84,29,4.0,9/10/2018,"It's been a while since I came here and I plan to go back soon since I'm back in nyc, but from what I can remember the atmosphere is a little too high brow for my taste. The gatekeepers wouldn't let me in with common projects sneakers because the bottoms were white, slippers were provided instead, so not too bad of an outcome. Expect great recommendations on pairings from the hostesses",,,
5,Caro S.,"East Bay, CA",353,626,577,5.0,7/19/2017,"Best cigar bar I have ever visited!We decided to drop in after wondering around Central Park. The place feels small when you first walk in but is pretty large. It's dimly lit and has the dark sexy decor you want in a cigar bar.They have couches, tables, a bar area, and TVs. The seating felt nice and intimate. The service was great. Our ashtrays were cleared regularly and our drinks were filled quickly.The wine list is perfection as is the cigar selection. We were able to make some excellent pairings and really enjoyed our entire afternoon there. I think we will definitely come back here anytime we are in New York!Sidebar: even the ladies bathroom is decorated with vintage cigar art and wrappers line the wallpaper. So cute!",4,2,3
6,Diogenes M.,"Jersey City, NJ",87,86,135,4.0,2/16/2018,"I have been to this place three times, but this is the only Cigar lounge I have been to so don't really have anything to compare it to. Did not come with a member but we called ahead and made reservations and did not have any issues. I believe there is a $30 minimum per person for table service, but you will be above that if you get a cigar and a drink. I think you have to buy at least one cigar of $15 or more or so. Honestly, the rules are not that evident and I wasn't really aware of them till we were done. If you go in and buy a cigar and drink you will be fine. As mentioned previously the staff is very great, so even if you are no cigar expert the staff will help you pick something out no problem. If you are not a regular cigar smoker, just ask the staff for something mild and make sure you eat before. If you are not a big whiskey or alcohol drinker, cigars also pair really really well with coffee.This is a nice place, a great stop between dinner and whatever you are doing after, or a great end of the night after dinner. Its a cigar lounge so it will obviously be smoky. I tried the french dip sandwich here with fries and it was really, really good so don't be afraid to try the food either. Lastly, of the three times I came here, Al Sharpton was here twice. Don't know exactly what that will mean to you but just putting it out there.",2,,
7,John D.,"Bay Shore, NY",1,4,0,5.0,3/2/2018,"Wine, dine, and cigars what else is there in life. Service is very attentive and the staff is well trained.The slab of bacon, the lamb chops, and the tuna tartare are excellent appetizers.Bring your own cigars or buy one of the many varieties that are there. The selection of single malts as well as other libations gives you a lot of choices.",1,,
8,Matthew D.,"Bronx, NY",2,20,33,5.0,10/8/2017,"Had a great evening last night. From the moment I arrived everyone was exceptional. I enjoyed a great cigar and a delicious glass of scotch. 5 guys for a bachelor party can be quite a hassle especially my loud crowd but we were treated like family. The ambience is spectacular, we did not eat but the food looked delicious. I will definitely go back to enjoy a smoke and a drink and hopefully some food. This is a dying breed of establishment",,,

Macanudo has an incredible vibe and excellent service. You MUST want to sit in a cigar smoke filled bar to enjoy this place. SO if you don't like that find someplace else. If your like me then you will be happy as a clam. There is a one cigar minimum. The live piano music is lovely and if you are lucky you will get some live vocals.,,1,
12,Michael A.,"Glendale, CA",127,255,1628,5.0,8/16/2017,"It was mildly surprising that the Club Macanudo was still in business and more to the point in this year of 2017 there are still people who enjoy a good cigar, dinner and drinks in the same venue.But yes, the Club is still happening and functioning on the same high, elite, erudite level that it was a few years ago.The physical plant is pretty amazing. When you first enter in what is basically a upper east side residence you are scrambling a bit because the lighting is very low, the air is pleasantly smoky and first thing you see is a beautiful bar,When your eyes become accustomed to the glow you see a very deep room with many couches and sofas and divans with many people enjoying cigars, drinks and food.We sat at the bar, ordered some very fine Scotch and some food: we shared a Wedge Salad, Crab Cakes and an unbelievably melt-in-your-mouth Rib Eye.The wedge was ice cold and crisp with ranch dressing and blue cheese and bacon. The crab cakes were crammed with lump crab and sauteed in butter.  Very delicious and of very high quality, preparation and presentation.The Rib Eye was prepared as we requested: medium rare and  served with mashed potatoes.But honestly, the food is not the main draw here. Club Macanudo is all about the environment, the expert service and the discrete camaraderie. We did not know anyone else  in the Club but soon started chatting with and sharing the experience with several dudes who were from California and a couple from Indiana.We were sharing this special experience and with this sharing we became pals if only for a few hours.The service here is beyond and above excellent. The attention to the details of our enjoyment was expert and quietly way above the usual. There is nothing usual about this Club. The service is so personal that you are taken a bit aback by it as if they want something from you. You soon realize is that what ""they"" want from you is to feel at home and to have a good time. We are not used to this old school type of service, plain and simple. But we soon relaxed into it very quickly.Though i have been to the Club M several times a few years ago i had forgotten how special this place is and how special the people here make you feel. It is as if you have been invited to a close friends home and your experience here is akin to your arriving and being pleasantly rewarded by their giving you a surprise bday party, It is that special.",6,1,5

14,Jon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,125,310,5.0,12/14/2017,"A cigar lovers dream come true in Manhattan. Classy, comfortable, leathery wooden atmosphere- basically that cigar by the fireplace feel. They have a full bar as well so their choice of nearly every type of whisky and other common liquor pairings is there. In fact extremely extensive and impressive. I had the white old fashion. It was great. The service was extremely polite, great cigar collection and not even that pricey. Lively boisterous vibes by the patrons. I truly enjoyed the visit.

17,Opal T.,"Atlanta, GA",305,236,447,1.0,10/10/2015,"We were greeted by a hostess who seated us right by the door. The place was relatively empty, so I'm not sure why she wouldn't seat us somewhere with less traffic. We were informed of he house minimum, which is $30pp with $15 of that on cigars. Well, we wish we knew about that when we called to make our reservation. But whatever, we moved passed that. The menu I received was extremely dirty. I can't imagine it's terribly difficult to print out a new page. You expect me to pay a certain price for your ""club""? I expect a clean menu. That I can't get over. We ordered the caesar salad and buffalo shrimp as appetizers, while we got a feel for the place. The salad was wet, yet underdressed which is confusing. Did I order water with my salad? The best part were croutons so that says a lot. Shrimp were so so. What I also don't like is the staff standing around and watching over you. I really didn't like having eyes over me while I'm eating. Really annoying and uncomfortable. Funny part is, the waitress never checked on us or asked how the food and wine was - and she was standing 3 feet away from us the whole time! But she decided to keep the change when we paid. We literally had to ask for our change back. Why would you assume that we would leave you that money? Let us determine your tip, thank you!!We had appetizers and decided to have entrees at our hotel. The manager did come over and try to rectify the situation, but we were completely done at this point. Never coming back. Sorry, not sorry.",17,9,1

Best food in the world? Heck no. But really good and good enough for the reason you go. A great cocktail and great cigar. Indoors and while you eat and drink, in this crazy cigar banning world we live in. Every city needs a place like this. Deep down, every city wants a place like this, whether they admit it or not. I have always had a good drink, whether it is a cocktail night, wine night or beer night. Always had a good meal and a good cigar. Is everything over priced? Of course! It's NYC and it's worth it in this case. If you are on a budget, they have nightly specials on meals and cigars that make things more reasonable. You need to go here and experience this at least once. You'll be back.",,,

They warned me about taking their Yelp Dukedom away! Ventilation is quite good, even when it's packed. There is always a nice mix of male and female patrons of all different age ranges. People just seem to be in a good mood when they're there. And why not, right? The waitstaff is eager to accommodate and they provide great cigar suggestions (they have tons to choose from in case you left yours at home).

Packed at night. Service is spotty. It took a long time to get change when I paid the bill. They asked me if I needed change when I paid the $50 tab with three twenty dollar bills. Sorry, the service didn't rate 20%, especially on a cigar I had to ask to have cut for me. Men's room was a mess, with paper towels all over the floor. They clearly need either a larger waste bin or to have someone service the restrooms more often. My second lunchtime visit was much better. The bartender was courteous and efficient.

Lets not get it twisted, this is an exclusive NYC Cigar Club. You're not coming here for a $5 cigar in your ""I Fa-king Love NY"" tee shirt. Are you feelin' me?So, I'm still buzzed I order a nice glass of Spanish Wine. I look behind me and see a wall of humidors. Where is the room where I can pick out my cigar? I'm handed a menu and on the front page I see ""Jay - Z"" cigar"". Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba and developed a cigar. Cool! Two pleaseWe're smoking, talking, laughing and just enjoying this place. The bar is packed, people are eating and just enjoying Club Macanudo. I even said: Damm, that is the BEST cigar I ever smoked in my life. Just something to point out. This is a smokers lounge. I wouldn't want to eat a big meal here while everyone is puffing away.We get the bill and I almost had heart failure! When I see Jay-Z I'm gonna whoop his ass. Who the hell smokes a cigar for that much money?(I keep repeating: Damm, that was the best cigar I ever smoked in my life)Man Cave personified, this place is cool as hell!!!",5,10,4

50,Kristofor N.,"Brooklyn, NY",286,293,223,5.0,11/22/2016,Man O Man. This place is awesome. Service was great. Food was okay. The cigars are amazing. We started out with drinks which were perfect. I had a Titos Gimlet. It was made perfectly. I order the chicken sandwich which was okay. My uncle had a salad with shrimp. Then came the cigars. They have some great smokes. Prices are expensive but hey its the city. We ordered a cigar each and another drink. My uncle had a double espresso. I passed. The place was busy for a Wednesday night. The service was great. The bill was expensive but I was prepared for that. They had a live singer who was singing some good songs with a glass a wine in his hand. Great place to bring a group of people.,,,
51,Geoff J.,"Tampa, FL",56,12,0,1.0,8/13/2016,"Great staff...Poor management. Dry cigars, cocktails made with canned and frozen juices, most food is frozen then thawed out for use including the appetizers served to the members during special parties.

52,Alexander P.,"Black Rock, CT",34,100,475,5.0,7/10/2012,"As good as it gets.  This is precisely what you get coming here.  I spent $500 for a party of 2 and this is all that we had;  (4) Partagas 160, (4) Macallan 25, and Warm Chocolate Truffles.  And to me I think this was relatively cheap.  Bill could easily go to an excess of $1k if we opted for the Partagas 150, just on the cigars alone.  Do yourself a favor and don't be seated next to the band as the music gets somewhat irritating.  Perfect spot is the chairs in front of the bar.  I can't speak of the food selections, however the must have is the chocolate truffles.I'll be back, regularly and I will most likely have the 150 the next time.  I mean really where can you find a 150 nowadays?",,,

I went after work with my uncle on a Monday night a few weeks back - the placed was pretty packed considering it was a Monday.  We ordered a few drinks, had some appetizers, and a few cigars.  They originally gave us the cigar the other had ordered but aside from that the evening was fantastic.  Live Jazz started around 8 and I can tell you that I will certainly be back.",,,

Yes it's expensive but they have a great selection of cigars, food and drinks. Staff is very friendly and helpful. They will make cigar selection suggestions for novice and veteran cigar smokers alike. Staff will cut and even toast (light) the cigar for you. The air filtration system is phenomenal and you will not walk out smelling of cigar. They have a pretty good selection of scotch priced at what you would expect for that area of Manhattan. They have 2 of my favorites Talisker 10 and Lagavulin 16. I will be back... I enjoyed it so much I purchased a membership there!!!",1,,1

64,Derek F.,"San Ramon, CA",86,91,50,5.0,2/22/2012,"Where oh where do i beginI have been here before but was rushed out last time to make reservations across town that someone so carelessly made without notifying me. Who would ever rush a good cigar? Better yet, a glass of Macallan and a cigar? Such travesties.moving on....After being seated for dinner in the main dinning room it required some time to take everything in. Club Macanudo is elegantly decorated but also manages to blend in pieces to remind you that you are in a cigar lounge. There were groups of people who were there smoking cigars they likely didnt know anything about other than the price tag, but there were also a good amount of cigar aficionados looking to entertain a good conversation. I chose the La Aurora Preferido Connecticut since i didn't want to start off the evening with something heavy before I got a chance to taste the food. The cigar was well kept, moist, and delivered with a box of wooden matches.We started with the Traditional Sliders and the New Zealand Lamb Chops. The sliders were delectable but the lamb chops stopped me dead in my tracks. I felt as if i had been lied to my entire life. Everything i thought i knew about lamb chops was obliterated after one bite. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, these could be the very reason gluttony is a sin. For my main course I had the veal chop. I had never tried veal before and thought why not! The taste threw me off at first so I stopped smoking my cigar. With each bite the flavor of the veal chop became more apparent and quite satisfying.Lastly we ended the evening with a glass of champagne and an order of  the warm chocolate truffles. I was already done with my cigar so chocolate was next on the list. The truffles were absolutely divine. Kick the Prozac and the Xanax to the curb ladies and gentlemen. A couple servings of these a day and even Joan Rivers surgeon wouldn't be able to take the smile off of your face. If you take your cigars or your food seriously and demand nothing less than the best, then make your way over to Club Macanudo.",3,1,1

67,Frankie A.,"Granby, CT",0,9,0,3.0,1/10/2014,"I came to Club Macanudo for the first time as a huge fan of cigars. I was told it was the mecca of cigar lounges in New York, so I was reasonably excited. The food was superb. I ordered their New York Strip Steak and a cognac-amaretto mixed drink. Both were flawless. The cigar I chose (Macanudo 1968 Toro) was also great.What was an abomination was their customer service. From the moment we stepped foot inside the waitress we had made my friends and I uncomfortable.Given it was my first time, I was uncertain with a few of their procedures which prompted me to ask a few questions. Every question was returned with nauseating looks. The amicable atmosphere I expected was absent.When she arrived with our cigars, she neglected to ask us how we would like them cut, proceeding to slice away with a single-blade guillotine that was very cheap. She severely undermined my previous experiences with cigars, which was distasteful.Towards the end of our meal, as we were still eating and smoking, we were asked several times in a hurried manner if there was anything else we'd like. We politely said no, and the final time she asked she said, ""Do you want the check? Because my shift is ending and I'm leaving.""The service was disgraceful, and made for a very unpleasant first visit. Aside from that the place is immaculate, has a remarkable selection of cigars and drinks, and their food was excellent.",2,1,

French fry.  The place has got an excellent cigar selection & great spirit choice level so if you want a drink you're all set.  Oh one note to a guy who said the bathroom was dirty man what are you talking about?  This place is a spot for celebs & execs of corps & such & to me this wasn't too much to be heavy on because I was enjoying my own thing so I wasn't paying her too much mind.  Place is well set with the tables & bar as well.  Thus the high score here.,1,,

73,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3285,12680,5.0,2/2/2011,"Dark woods, testosterone, and rich corinthian leather!!!! The kind of place that is both upscale and uber chic, oozing with coolness, but also inviting at the same time. Just a wonderful setting to smoke a good cigar and enjoy a drink. Service is terrific and the clientele is a mix of old and young. Lots of monied types here, but also those who are not so wealth endowed. Great bar to sit around, and tables, chairs, couches to relax around. You feel as if you are in someone's large library room. Part of the fun is looking at the name plates on all the private humidors in the walls. Many celebs, dignitaries, and politicians adorn them. There is a dress code, so no jeans, sneakers, or casual ratty attire. They do take reservations for dinner and the food is very good. Good rib eye and filet mignon, sandwiches,  and for dessert the warm chocolate truffles are awesome. Also, a very nice Scotch and wine selection, along with decent tap and bottled beers. They sometimes have live jazz and latin music nights too.Definitely on the pricey side overall but that is to be expected in a place like this. If you are looking for a civilized way to spend an evening and enjoy a nice smoke then this is a destination spot.",8,,2
74,Alex Z.,"Chicago, IL",201,56,28,5.0,3/9/2013,"Some people might be turned off by the price, but Club Macanudo isn't a place for just anyone to walk in. It's meant for people who want to dwell in an aristocratic atmosphere and enjoy a fine cigar paired with a robust scotch.I am not a member of high society, so, walking in with my red wing boots, gray jeans, and navy blue button-up shirt, I thought I would be turned away. However, I was given a nice area to myself to enjoy a cigar. This made me think twice about my assumption that it was only for the highest members of society. They won't let you stroll in with some dad jeans and k-swiss' on, but clearly, they do consider your appearance upon arrival. While I was in there, someone was turned away because his attire was considered to be much too casual. Either way, the service was attentive and kind, and I was able to sit back for 2 hours or so to enjoy my cigar and read a book for a little while without being rushed out. The bill was a little high, but it was very worth it.A great stop for any gentleman or woman looking for a place to relax and bask in the glory of a cigar.",4,,

76,Ashley B.,"San Jose, CA",107,60,12,5.0,2/22/2012,"I LOVE Club Macanudo!  I hosted a company event here and the turnout and reviews from the attendees were more than fabulous. The staff is so wonderful, especially the General Manager Mauricio. I wasn't able to attend my company event, but Mauricio took care of everything for me and made sure all of the guests were taken care of very well. I plan to host many more events here. I recently visited NY for vacation and made it a point to go to Club Macanudo to meet Mauricio since I didn't get a chance to meet him at my company event. He unfortunately wasn't able to meet with my friend and I that evening, but Mauricio made sure to reserve a table for us and his staff was awaiting our arrival. He also had a little surprise waiting for my friend and I since it was our birthdays. Everyone treated us so well and his assistant made it a point to introduce herself to us. I have only hosted one event at Club Macanudo, yet I still received this warm, welcoming treatment from them on a personal level outside of work.  I don't only recommend this place for company or client events, I also highly recommend this place for dinner and drinks. The atmosphere is very relaxing. The food is amazing - I recommend the Sliders as an appetizer....so good! Also, the Truffles are a MUST for dessert! All in all, Club Macanudo is an amazing gem in NY. Even if you don't smoke cigars (which I don't), you should definitely visit for the great food, drinks, and amazing staff.",,,
77,mike d.,"New York, NY",175,50,1,1.0,11/26/2012,"I've been having fun times at this place for years - Until this Saturday.  I really didnt wan't to get involved in the shopping bullshit that the ladies were involved in so I popped over for a drink.  I had on Jeans, Grateful Dead tie-dye, Sambas - crappy free jacket from ING from the 2009 Marathon.  I love their Amber beer so ordered one - and a Basil Hayden.  It's 3pm on a Saturday - Madison Ave. was bustling - only 2 other poeple in the place.  Of course it's open to the Public you assholes - most of your client members are near dead or dying or don't come out in the cold.  So sure I knew they might not serve me because of my dress but low and behold - they do.My GF's friend joins me for a drink about 20 mins later - I re-order same order.  No issues.Then my GF comes in the door - and the bartender - who went missing for 20 minutes - I had to track the girl down to get another drink says to my GF - ""sorry mam, we have a dress code, you cannot wear those sneakers in here.  Here is a bucket of dirty old man slippers for you to wear. ""Thank god my GF needed the drink - but then we got the fuck outta dodge.Moral of the story - Look I live on the UES.  If you want to have a very overpriced daytime drink while shopping dont come here.  If you are a blowhard with some loot - do.Otherwise - walk a wee bit more and go to Donohuhes on 64 and Lex.  One of the best bars in NYC - sure they don't have $12 cigars marked up to $40, and yes they dont have old horny men with high priced fake-titted hookers falling over them- but they do serve a stiff drink in a nice atmosphere.And you can wear sneakers - and yes - THEY ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL!  Club Macanudo is a perfect name for this place - ahh to be the namesake one of the worst cigars on the planet - I mean seriously - why not call it Club Backwoods, or Club Te-Amo - but that would be giving Te-Amo a bad name.",6,9,3
78,Josh H.,"Manhattan, NY",22,65,0,4.0,3/22/2013,"This cigar bar is the only place in the city that you can get a meal and a smoke. That's not a big deal for me but I know for regular smokers, this is a big deal. They're cigar list is enormous and to be honest, a little too much. Prices are typical cigar bar prices. But the difference here is the crowd. That is to say if you've ever been to Hudson Bar and Books where it's kind of hipster in terms of cigar bars, this place is the exact opposite. There are a lot of high rollers and there is a good deal of white hair among the patrons. But mixed in with the white-haired money men, there are some younger people that seem to congregate near the bar, presumably to watch the Miami Heat continue their winning streak on the projection screen. The point is if you go here, probably don't wear jeans. In fact, throw on some cuff links and you'll fit right in, regardless of age.",2,,1

I read the other reviews and had a little concern with wait staff and visitors.. I must say not sure what day those people were there but this place was great.. I didn't have a reservation at peak time and the manager without hesitation found us a table and within a minute. He even took our order which was followed by another waitress. We ordered the chocolate truffles and again the manager delivered and provided friendly instructions on eating them. The Scotch list was huge and numerous other drinks are available. I had a great cigar and enjoyed the atmosphere. As far as price, yes it is expensive but guess what most of NYC is expensive if you compare it to your local cigar shop that doesn't offer what this place does.. This is one of the last places in NY that you can smoke cigars, eat, and drink all under the same roof.

83,Chris L.,"New York, NY",32,123,1,5.0,12/20/2011,"Club Macanudo is my happy place.  There's no other way to put it.  This is not a place to pick up girls- this is a place to show off the gorgeous creatures that have already flocked to your fat-walleted, debonair self, and take in the nods of acknowledgement from the gentlemen at other tables.  The ambiance is Upper East Side money, with men in sport coats or suits and women in cocktail dresses and diamonds.  On weekends, an excellent live band occupies the corner of the main room and belts out the old standards.The cigar list is excellent, though I wish they carried a few lines that I like (Avo, Zino, more from Davidoff than the two sticks they offer).  The wine list is excellent, but be aware that they can and will substitute vintages without warning you if something is unavailable.  The scotch list is excellent, but they should carry Highland Park to round it out.  The menu is excellent, but the portions are all far too massive.These are the worst problems that you have to deal with.  Relax in your rich leather couch, allow your arm candy to cozy up to you, and take another puff from your $35 Davidoff.  You've made it.",3,5,1

85,Linh T.,"Rutherford, NJ",345,24,14,1.0,8/23/2011,"This isn't my first time coming here. I was absolutely appalled by the way they treated my friends and I. I had made a reservation for 4 for my boyfriend's birthday. Show up, they're nice and all but no one was in the restaurant and they made us wait to ""set a table"". When I noticed it was in the doorway, I asked if we could sit anywhere else because it would be kind of an inconvenience if anyone had to get through that door way.They had absolutely NO personality, weren't able to make a good recommendation on wine or food (i mean if they know what cigars we're smoking, just make a recommendation instead of asking what we like... we know what we like, we were just hoping you could make another recommendation to go with what we're smoking!) and the hovering by the waitress and manager on duty was uncomfortable.My friends and I are all young professionals and I feel that we carry ourselves that way as well. It was like they were afraid we were going to run out on the check or something. But I just brushed it off and thought that maybe I was just looking too much into it and that maybe they're just trying to give us good service.Really, why would anyone go to a restaurant that they cannot afford? Especially in a group! Between the 4 of us, we spent a hefty amount, with drinks, the bottle of wine, cigars and dinner! When it came down to the check, the birthday boy wasn't going to pitch in, so the check was split in 3... not a big deal. We signed our checks and were on our way.Walking away from the restaurant, not even 3 doors away, the waitress comes running after us like a lunatic. ""You didn't sign your receipt!!"" We all looked at her like she had 3 heads. She actually insinuated that we walked out on the check! I, with all my composure to not rip those receipts out of her hand and scratch off the $80+ tip that we left her, told her to double check her numbers and double check if there were 3 receipts there because she only swiped 3 credit cards. When she noticed she had made the error, she just shrugged and said, ""oh, I thought there was 4 receipts,"" and pranced back to the restaurant. I didn't realize how mad I was until we got into the car and were already off to our next destination.I mean, HOW HARD IS IT TO COUNT TO 3?!?! I've never been more insulted in my life. Never again. The only thing redeeming about this placed was that their bus-boys were always on point and were very nice.So would I ever go back here ever again? Probably not. For the amount that they charge for everything, I would expect a better caliber of service!",12,7,1

This was probably the worst treatment I've ever received in a restaurant.The food here is excellent. The possible exception being the porterhouse for 1 which is cut too thin for my liking. Porterhouse just shouldn't be served for 1. The wine was fantastic. The cigars are great at every price point. The whole ambiance is old money and class. I loved that every time ashes started to accumulate the bus staff would rush in and replace it with a fresh ashtray. Or if anything spills on the table cloth they will cover it with a napkin so you don't have to look at it for the rest of your meal. It's those little things that make it feel upscale. The reason I've given it 2 stars was the service. You know that ""go F' yourself"" smile. That marked our reception at every turn. The service was civil, not friendly and even that gave way. Without going into too much detail we spent quite a bit of money and left a healthy 20% tip and once the tab was settled, were publicly insulted.

It was awkward being there, as everyone was questioning how we ended up there (my girlfriend and myself, visiting from LA), but it's really a cool place. The Yankee's game was on, so this place was packed! However, the hostess was more than happy to seat us in the outside of the main room area, where we ordered drinks and food.Food is delicious!! The best bruschetta I have ever ever had. Seriously, you have to order this heavenly treat and experience it for yourself. We were in heaven! The service was so pleasant - from when we ordered food to when we wandered into the bar (after the Yankees game) and ordered a couple drinks. It's a lil' pricey, but it's NY and it's a cigar bar (I get it and we were more than happy to pay -- it's worth it).If you're in the area, and smoke cigars .... you might enjoy this place (I wouldn't know about the cigar thing). If you're in the area and want to enjoy some awesome food & drinks and a change of scenery, go here. Wonderful atmosphere & ambiance and a great place to people/guy watch ... (oops!).",2,,

No reservations are accepted unless your party includes four or more people. Oh well, we can always smoke outside if they don't let us in.After a $2 coat check, the hostess quickly sat us. We didn't wait long and received the menus. There is a cigar minimum so the three of us ordered a Davidoff Anniversario #3 along with drinks. Yes, they are expensive, but it was my birthday! ""When in Rome!""Unfortunately, my cigar was dry (I made the comment to the server, but he didn't agree). While smoking it fell apart... what a f--king dog rocket. I let it die a slow death and moved on to a cigar in our smuggled bag, a Padron 3000 Maduro. Much better.I easily got lost in our conversations and ignored our surroundings (the older, distinguished suits... along with scantily clad pro's). I will say that the ventilation system is the best of the cigar bars I've been too. However, if you think you can hang out and expect to smell like roses when you leave, then you need to be committed.Overall, service was good and I would return. I won't be bamboozled again with a poor quality product, though.March 08 UPDATEMy friends and I decided to try this again because the last time was very pleasant. We got there at 9:20 PM and waited about 40 minutes. It was packed. The three of us waited by the bar and enjoyed a few Chimays.Still the strong points of Club Mac are:* the ventilation system* the ambience; you feel like a rich old pimp. If you are here with friends or business colleagues, this is a great place to unwind.* the other restroom in the back (not the one by coat check) makes it convenient for me.And the bad: * It can be disturbing to see old fat rich guys doting on young girls or even pros. How does 22 go into 58? I was going to say ""ask Ashton Kutcher"" but he's too old for that joke to work.* Once we were seated things were great... except the MACANUDO VINTAGE CABINET ""LIMITED"" 1997 #8 we received was moldy (no it was not PLUME). I was disappointed. Thank goodness we brought our own stash. I must downgrade the rating due to the quality of the tobacco product.

She seemed equally baffled when I asked about cigars.  They had more service staff than customers, so why did I take 10 minutes to bring a cigar?In summary, this place is stuffy and over-priced.  The decor is old and the big projection tv stinks.  Don't waste your time here...unless you're a rich old dude trying to impress your high priced hooker.",2,2,

The crowd was very diverse and was 25-55.  From people dressed to the Nines and others like myself just prepared for the weather.  The only thing this place could improve on is adding a more hi tech ventilation system as it seemed non existent and the smoke kind of just lingered in the air around us.  So if you are scared to death of second hand smoke or don't like to wash your clothes you might want to steer clear.  This place even has lockers on the wall which look like old bank deposit boxes which I assume are for High Roller frequenting members to stash their smokes in.  Cool idea .. If you are a Cigar Aficionado or just looking for a place to have a drink and enjoy smoking inside I would definitely recommend.  Puff at Will ..,1,,1

Updated review","I really hate it when something bad happens in a place I really like and enjoy. Something like that happened last night in Club Macanudo. The night before last we went into the Club and smoked a cigar, had some drinks and really enjoyed our time there. We had such a good time, we decided to go back again last night. We arrived right before midnight, but we figured because they are open until 2:00 am, we had plenty of time. I ordered a 1968 Macanudo Churchill cigar ($32), a Basil Hyden on the rocks ($18) and my wife had a champagne split for $30. We'd been there about 20 minutes when our server came over to let us know it was last call at the bar and ask if we wanted more drinks. We were surprised by the last call, but not worried and figured we still had plenty of time. My Basil Hayden was more than half gone so I ordered another $18 drink and my wife (thankfully) passed on another champagne split. 15  minutes later the manager (not sure he was the manager, but he definitely wasn't a server) came over and told us they were closing and we needed to leave. My cigar was half smoked and I hadn't touched my new $18 drink.  I had closed my $100 tab and left a $20 tip, which was obviously a mistake. I understand a place wanting to close up early because they are not busy, but common sense should dictate that you should share this information with your customers. I spent $120 to sit in Club Macanudo for less than an hour only to be thrown out by the manager. And no he was not friendly or apoligetic about it.  About the only nice thing I can say about him asking us to leave was that he didn't cuss at us or grab us by the arm. Did I mention we were sober and having a quite conversation. Nobody ever told us ""we're closing early tonight so please try to be done with your drinks by 12:35"". The server might have mentioned how much time we had left before offering more drinks at last call. Luckily my wife didn't order another champagne split or she would have had to leave almost a full bottle. The service here has always been great here, but the manager handled the situation about as poorly as possible. I felt ripped off, cheated and won't be returning.",8,,1

I tagged along with some co-workers who have a locker here and got to experience the decadence of a good cigar and 20 yr tawny port. Its a very relaxing place where one can unwind and enjoy their company. I would recommend to all that smoke or don't. It was still very enjoyable for those who do not actively participate in the act of puffing...cigars or otherwise. Just be sure that you air out your clothes when you get home and take a long shower after wards! Service is top notch and the price points for cigars are fairly reasonable, but than again its not an everyday occurrence, so splurging is not uncalled for.",3,,

129,Michael B.,"Manhattan, NY",355,109,19,4.0,8/23/2008,"Went to MacAnudo last night with a buddy and the experience was grand.  Beautiful interior, excellent cigar and scotch selection for acceptable prices.  One tip....don't go wearing sneakers.....even if you are wearing a three piece suit with them....like I did.  The hostess was very nice and let me slide.  If you feel like a cigar, and don't mind the trek to UES, go here for sure.",2,,2
130,S. D.,"New York, NY",6,73,6,4.0,11/5/2010,"Club Macanudo has a great selection of cigars and great selection of drinks (albeit overpriced). The Partagas Benji Menendez series, which is a bit difficult to find elsewhere is fantastic even though they sell it at three times the actual price. I also like how their ashtrays are very large so you can rest your cigar on it comfortably. Given how overpriced everything is, the wine list strangely enough is actually priced reasonably, at least for Manhattan. The atmosphere is upscale and the hostesses are all very friendly with a few of them being very cute as well. You can't wear sneakers but they do loan you dress shoes which is nice albeit a little bit stinky. The ventilation works well so you don't completely reek when you leave. Also, the servers are very attentive and change your ashtrays constantly.Overall, I think this is one of the best cigar bars in NYC (from the few that we have).",3,,
131,Carmen L.,"Denton, TX",12,77,31,5.0,12/27/2010,This is a beautiful place! The service is wonderful! A place to visit for smokers and nonsmokers alike...wear something pretty and enjoy!!,2,,

Updated review","Had a closing at Siri Ptak's new office, with my cousin counselor Ray Farraj and buddy tenant Mark Goris.  If you have ever done a closing that involved Siri you would have guessed that by the time we got out of that office we were STARVING!  Walked around lost a little until we realized we were close to Cub Macanudo. For a cigar bar they have a great  atmosphere you can smell the aroma but the dozens of air filters make even a smoke hater like myself very comfortable. Its a very cozy and inviting place wood lined everything comfortable couchy corners and the wall of lockers for the members. I liked the steak the last time I was there so much that I ordered it again. It definatly was not a mistake. This place is so nice my buddy Mark and I split a membership.  I can't wait for our first member swaray.",,,

134,Jj L.,"Stamford, CT",11,131,3,5.0,5/18/2009,"Under new mgmt circa Jan 2009, they have opened the space a little with more dining tables and less couches.  Movement around the back is much free-er than prior years!  The food menu and wine list have all been updated.  They even had onion rings (not on the menu) to snack on.   Ambiance is a little sophisticated (i.e. UES charm), but definitely old school cigar lovers! It is a great time to be a member!",,,
135,Soumeya B.,"Fairfax, VA",37,130,17,3.0,4/28/2009,"Forget about the service in this place, it is non-existant even if your table is ordering on an expense account. Most of the servers are Indian and depending on your luck you might get someone who does not know the difference between a desert and a cuban honey.Everything else is just ok. The place is a throw back to Monaco, the design, the darkness and even the crowd... The beautiful thing about having it in NY is that you don't have to fit the stereotype to enter.",,,
136,Kelly K.,"Reston, VA",274,1690,1284,5.0,2/14/2008,I really like the atmosphere even though I do not smoke!!!  Great for a drink!,,,
137,Michelle N.,"San Mateo, CA",3,29,4,5.0,2/23/2011,"So glad to say Club Macanudo is the first cigar bar I've been to. Went to one in Philly this past wkd and it does not compare. Macanudo has the atmosphere, bar, people and an extensive cigar menu. Definitely a boys club but saw a lot of the ladies smoking their own cigars. There is a minimum per person which is no problem since you are going there with a mission.",,,
138,Lily S.,"Bronx, NY",43,227,20,4.0,9/13/2010,"Very nice and dress code is taken seriously.  Their super nachos are a crowd pleaser.  A nice place to smoke cigars and have drinks.  The ventilation works so well here, after two hours of puffing, the smell doesn't stick to your clothes.",,,1
139,Adam C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,3.0,8/14/2012,"I came here for lunch one day after hearing about it. They are certainly not a location for everybody, with a 21+ age requirement and (not sure if they enforce this, as I was dressed in a suit already), a formal dress code. I can't really tell if that's serious, because the other men in the restaurant with me were dressed in polos and slacks, but may have been club members considering the bottle of wine they were drinking. The restaurant is all dark wood and class, and felt a lot like Nat Sherman, as would befit a cigar club/restaurant.After being seated by my server, who seemed pretty disinterested in me, I was given an ash tray to finish the cigar I had been smoking when I entered. Perhaps that's why they waived their $10 cutting fee? Either way, wasn't charged for the cigar. I ordered the Cuban Sandwich and a beer, and the service was pretty prompt. I was seated in front of a large projector screen that was playing the news, albeit without volume or captioning so I couldn't really pay attention. The sandwich was good, though a bit heavy on the mayo, but certainly not $20 good. Maybe going for a cheaper menu item wasn't going to net me the whole experience, but I wanted to scope the place out, not put down a chunk of change on lunch. Not going to be coming back here often, as I can just as easily enjoy a cigar on the way to Gabriel's or another nice restaurant and then have a quality meal with a kinder wait staff. Will give it another go to see if the results change.",1,,
140,Lin Y.,"Manhattan, NY",17,35,0,4.0,6/12/2011,"I discovered CM years ago through lawyer friends of mine and use to go on a weekly basis. The smoke does get to me, but I luv this place! Class all the way from the dress code to the beautiful bar and comfy couch seats. The food is really good. Man size meaty portions of chicken, shrimp and big salads, but for a hefty price. Their bar selections are diverse and tasty also. Occasionally I go for a scotch with the boys :). Can't wait to be back here in a few days!!!",2,,1
141,Joe D.,"New York, NY",27,97,27,4.0,1/21/2009,"While Im on my cigar review kick I must talk about Club Macanudo.  This is more of an exclusive place as you dont need a membership, but you will need to dress appropriately which means no jeans and no sneakers.   They do keep the place nice with leather couches and upscale decor that is very appropriate with the cigar smoker in mind. The service is great with reasonable cigar prices at all price points. They started serving food a couple years back, but its not recommended except maybe dessert. They even have gambling night usually on Thursdays where you can wager fake money to play Blackjack. So go have a cigar, some good scotch and sit back in one of their couches and relax.  We all need it!",3,1,1
142,Meryl C.,"Brooklyn, NY",394,408,23,4.0,10/30/2005,"I'll just say it: I will travel to the Upper East Side for very few reasons.  This place is one thanks to its comfortable decor (mahogany furniture, buttery-soft leather chairs and cushiony sofas).   The place has a private club feel -- boys' club, anyone?-- but it's really a great location for a business meeting or a get together with friends. I say go and ""smoke 'em if you got 'em.""  Grab a glass of wine or cognac, nibble on cheese and other small dishes and let the smoke rise.",2,,2
143,David H.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,54,0,3.0,4/29/2008,"Nice cigar and alcohol menue, good service, however the vibe lacked something.  Despite the leather couches there's something not very cozy about it.  Wish I could put my finger on it, but there's something rather cold and impersonal about the place.",2,,1
144,T N.,"Shelter Island, NY",33,251,0,4.0,2/5/2007,"A true gentleman's club.... without the T&A. This is not to say that there isn't exceptional talent to be found, you just don't pay up front for the opportunity to date them. If you enjoy old world, blue blooded charm accompanied by 25 year old single malts and a Punch or Bolivar to smoke with them this is it. I've found the White Chocolate Martini to be a favorite of most guests I bring.... try it! Maybe you will even like it!",1,,3
145,Kal S.,"New York, NY",0,20,0,5.0,2/26/2010,"Always have the best time here.  Again, this is a very very cozy place and although there are people, mostly men as its a cigar / smoking permitted restaurant / bar, with over 50 different scotches and 1000000 cigar types, in suits and ties, its not pretentious or business like.  its just a perfect place to relax, have a drink and a french-dip after a long week.  really love it.",3,,2
146,Andrew W.,"New Orleans, LA",1,53,0,4.0,9/12/2010,Great place for a cigar and scotch.  Very expensive.  Selection is comprehensive. However they no longer sell pipe tobacco.,,,1
147,O R.,"Woodhaven, NY",3,13,0,5.0,12/1/2007,"If you like to drink, smoke a cigar indoors, eat food, and watch some live music all at the same time, then this is the place for you.  Club Macanudo has a great atmosphere.  It has pleasant lighting, comfortable chairs, and background music that is not overpowering.  Their cigars are pretty good and they have a huge selection of drinks - some of which can cost you a pretty penny.",,,
148,Lori M.,"New York, NY",0,180,0,1.0,1/27/2006,"The only reason a woman would go here, other than for a warm place to smoke a butt, is to get hit on by old men looking for a young chick.  The place is full of old rich guys looking to hit on young women hoping their wallets may impress.  Yikes!",6,9,
149,thomas b.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,12/29/2009,Great atmosphere. Great looking place and good food. The only problem is it gets tight in there. I wish it was bigger but I will definitely come again.,,,
