0,Richard C.,"Springfield, VA",3062,806,13306,5.0,8/27/2018,"I have found a new favorite hotel in New York City. The Best Western Premier Herald Square. I stayed here for the first time recently and it does rank 5 Stars for sure. It's located on 36th Street in between 5th and 6th Avenues in Midtown Manhattan. Let's start with the location, for me a whole star is for the location. It's a block and a half from the Empire State Building. A block and a half from Broadway, 4 1/2 blocks to Times Square and the Theatre's of Broadway. A ten minute walk to Central Park and Rockefeller Center or you can just on the subway a block away and in just a couple stops you at Central Park and Rockefeller Center. 6 blocks from Grand Central Station to the north or to the west 2 1/2 blocks to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. A few blocks south and your in Chelsea and the Flatiron District. Shall I go on? Well I could but I don't have the space to jeopardize on listing. Tons of restaurants and shopping all around it. Love it. I asked for a room with a view and got a nice view from the top floor (17 floors). The hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful. The hotel was clean and modern. The room was a bit small but was cozy, the bed super comfortable. The bed faced an entire wall of glass that was curved upward and opened to the nice view. It has a super nice cocktail lounge the Premier Lounge with a long happy hour from 5pm to 9pm and $5 mixed drinks. It has TV's and an outside sitting area. You get a full breakfast, the breakfast is loaded with eggs, pancakes, bagels, cereals, bacon, sausage, coffee, juices and much more. Yep my Yelp friends, I love this hotel and I will be coming back again and again and again...........",43,20,43
1,Heather G.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,16,2,5.0,10/12/2018,"Excellent hotel bar! Friends and I came from the not great American Hall next door. My comparison, the not too crowded, not too loud hotel bar across the street with the great happy hour deal was an absolute delight. It feels weird hanging out at a hotel bar as an NYC local, but even as a local this is just a legit great Midtown bar. Highly recommended.",,,
2,Jordana S.,"Miami, FL",53,97,140,2.0,1/2/2018,Very disappointed . Payed $791 a night for stained and tattered old sheets . When I complained about it manager told meThey were getting new inventory next year . If I hadn't been so freezing cold I would have tried to get my money back .  Terrible customer service .,1,3,
3,Marsha L.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,6,1,5.0,10/27/2018,"My new favorite hotel in NYC! Full breakfast in the morning was one of best I've had, lots of room in the bottom floor eating area. Room was small, but very clean and quiet, and we were able to check in early. Earplugs were provided but we didn't need them. Lounge had evening happy hour ($4 beer, $6 wine). Makeup mirror in bathroom. Meant to check on refrigerator in room (thought we were getting one) but ice was plentiful, as well as lemon water and coffee in lobby. Great location! Macy's two blocks away, bodega two doors down (delicious slices of cake!), Mad Dog and Beans Mexican cantina with best pitcher of margaritas around just a short walk away. Can't wait to come back to explore ""my"" new neighborhood more!",,,
4,Wendall H.,"Silver Spring, MD",222,151,658,4.0,10/4/2017,"Is it cozy or is it small? I'm going with cozy and a bit small.Just about two blocks from the Empire State Building, this gem is a nice place to rest from the bustle of the city. Cons: - The walls are a little thin. (On the plus side, the people next door seem to be having a nice ""adult"" time.)- The rooms are small. Bed. Mini ironing board. Small desk. Bathroom. Pros:- Continental Breakfast! Nothing fancy, but all tasty. - Fitness room. Not large, but it has everything you need to take the edge off. - Shower stalls big enough for two (or just you).- Bar/Lounge with happy hour specials! (Adulting for those of you that like to Adult.)- CLEAN!!! Can't be overstated, the value of a clean hotel room. This is a place I would definitely return to when passing through the City.",2,,
5,Imran A.,"Patchogue, NY",940,26,2,4.0,12/17/2017,"I have found Best Western hotels to be a reasonable compromise between affordability and quality. I found this one to be reasonably priced (at the rate I paid for one night, including WiFi and free breakfast). But having stayed at a Berlin BW Premier I have to say this is not worthy of the Premier tag. Very courteous front desk and wait staff at breakfast. Hotel bed was clean and comfortable as was the bath. The pillows were a little too fat for my comfort but not lumpy. I would stay here again. Stay here for the location, not to spend days inside the hotel. IMRAN",2,,2
6,Joanne B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,6,4,5.0,5/12/2018,"We stayed at the BW for 1 night stopover  on our way to Ireland.  Bebe at the front desk was awesome, she put us in a high room away from traffic so we could get a good nights sleep, and we did!  Room was small, but most rooms are in NY are .  Bed was comfortable, shower was hot.   Every staff member we encountered was very nice and helpful!  We will be back!  Thanks",2,,
7,Tammy M.,"Englewood, CO",12,157,80,5.0,10/10/2017,Excellent! Totally worth the price and close shopping right across the street has a great clothing store to don't miss out. The people were gracious and the morning breakfast was good too. It's Halloween time since it's October and they actually are festive. Real nice to see that. Thanks and will see you again soon,2,2,1
8,Kris L.,"Elmhurst, IL",8,195,55,4.0,3/31/2018,"Affordable option for the city. Rooms are tight, but clean. Central location. Staff seemed courteous. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment in an underwhelming space. There were very few options left by the time I made it down just before 9am. The bar is cozy and they have happy hour specials. It ended up being the perfect place to unwind after a day of trucking around town. I would recommend staying if you can snag a good rate.",,,
9,Brent H.,"New York, NY",69,113,93,1.0,3/14/2018,"The night of 3/13/18, early morning of 3/14/18, I called this Best Western location and talked to the man at the front desk twice. They accidentally took payment twice on my card. I was on the phone with Chase and Chase's operator told me to call Chase back while I was on a 3-way call with the merchant (Best Western) for Chase to be able to okay a credit to my account for the amount that Best Western mistakenly charged. I called Best Western, the man told me to call back and I called back 3x while on 3-way with an operator from Chase and the Best Western intentionally hung up on me and now won't answer the phone! It's absolutely unbelievable tome. I'm calling tomorrow to talk to a manager to report his dodging any kind of work attitude, in the meantime, inconveniencing me again! When I stayed here it wasn't so bad, but it wasn't good either. Last time I ever go there again. I really hope the guy who kept hanging up on me gets dealt with accordingly.",,,
10,Popo L.,"Aurora, CO",0,63,0,4.0,1/13/2018,Very reasonable. The room was SMALL but I wasn't planning on socializing there. I would have liked a dresser of some sort. I had to stay a week and needed some elbow room. The employees were terrific. The best thing was the fantastic breakfast bar. The place was clean and there was no waiting for anything. I didn't hear the noise from outside which was not the case in the last two hotels I stayed at. I prefer this over the Roosevelt and the Grand Central Hyatt. There are no shuttle services to the airport which sucked but whatever.,1,,
11,Colette C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,37,3,5.0,2/21/2018,We were greeted by the friendly staff as soon as we checked into the hotel. The hotel check in was very quick. Our room was comfortable and clean. The shower pressure was excellent and the shower was big. The toiletries in the bathroom were very nice. Our room had a tv and coffee maker. The location is excellent! Highly recommend,,,
12,Karen M.,"Mansfield, MA",0,31,11,4.0,2/8/2018,"The room was very clean. The hotel had a small bar, always a plus, and an exercise room, which is a requirement for me when I travel.  The exercise room was small, but had what I needed to get a good work out in. There were clean towels and filtered water available as well. The lobby had a restroom and 24 hour coffee, tea and hot chocolate.  The complimentary breakfast had everything to make my daughters, one a vegetarian and one a vegan, as well as myself, happy and full. We walked to the High-line, Times Square, and even Central Park and The Metropolitan Museum from the hotel; Great location.  The staff was pleasant and helpful, even letting us check in early. I would recommend this hotel and would come back again on our next trip to NYC.",,,
13,Nina R.,"Fairfax, VA",324,324,1964,4.0,3/5/2016,"Very clean and comfortable hotel, close to 5th Avenue and close to Herald Square, plenty of restaurants nearby.  However I received very poor customer service at check-in. First the negative: Had a voucher to use so I picked this location.  Booked the reservation with Best Western central booking over the phone, received confirmation code.  Once I arrived, the check-in guy said he couldn't accept the voucher for whatever the reason.  He made a quick call and said, we can't accept it.  I insisted there had been a mistake and asked him to call customer service, and he contradicted me and said, I just got off, you saw me, there's nothing we can do.  I called customer service, stayed on hold waiting for 25 minutes for a supervisor, insisted that he put in more effort to help resolve the situation, rather than, oh nothing I can do, can't help you attitude.  I finally reached a supervisor and she explained what the error was.  She apologized and gave him the appropriate way to validate the voucher.  Simple error, but not enough to just say sorry I can't help you.  He get's zero stars.Bottom line, the daytime check-in staff needs to significantly improve their overall professionalism.  I also felt left out during this overall frustrating situation because the two men were speaking in a foreign language in front of me.  I felt that was rude and I had no way of knowing if they were talking about me or about something else?  That was very far from welcoming.  Once it was resolved, he really did not seem very apologetic at all.  Completely lacked any sort of compassion to the mistake made on Best Western's end.  The lady on the phone was very polite.Now for the positives:  4 stars- I was impressed with the modern decor and overall cleanliness. - 24-hour self-service coffee, tea, hot water, ice water at the lobby- low noise level- comfortable queen size bed- kind of a small room- great complimentary breakfast- flat screen tv in the room with clean remote in a little tissue type bag- free wi-fi - modern style bathroom, again very clean.  I only wished the shower head could move a bit more, the water came out too close to the wall so I had to sort of squeeze and stand closer so rest of the shower stall was just unused space.- cool back bar and patio- exercise room in basement- The complimentary breakfast runs from 7:30 am - 9:30 am.  I called the front desk at 9:24 am when I woke up and asked whether I missed breakfast.  They suggested that I go anyway, there would still be food.  There was plenty of food by the time I reached at 9:35 am.  Hot pancakes, hard boiled eggs, beef sausage links, bread and bagels for toasting, butter, cream cheese, jams, pastries, hot oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee, juice and tea.  I was very impressed with the breakfast.  The lady working there explained they discontinue putting out food at 9:30 am, but there was plenty left.  As I was leaving a little after 10 am, people were still coming in, however their selection was probably only limited somewhat.- The gentleman that helps with bags in the morning, and the gentleman at the check-in weekday late shift - were both very welcoming.  Excellent customer service!- When you check-out in the morning, they will hold your bags/luggage for a few hours if needed.  Even though the check-in experience was unpleasant, for the future I will call the hotel directly to ensure that my reservations are consistent with their records on site.  I will return and I would recommend this hotel to someone else.",3,1,3
14,Doobie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,0,2.0,8/10/2017,"The room was good, but very small, not unusual in the city, but the checkout took 30 mins and I barely made my flight. ImFront desk staff was under staffed on more than one occasion. When I finally did check out the two girls spent time talking when they should've been checking me out. Very frustrating customer service experience at the end of my stay. I would've given this place 4 stars had my check out experience been better.",1,,
15,Andrea S.,"Orlando, FL",0,10,0,2.0,3/14/2018,"The hotel was very nice, and clean. The location was great. Overall, I would give the hotel alone 4 stars, because the room is on the small side. However my issue was with the front desk staff, especially the female staff. They were extremely rude upon checking in and out, and made us feel uncomfortable anytime we had to go to the front desk, as if we were ""bothering them"" to do their job.  This happened anytime we encountered a female employee at the front desk, not just one specifically. Probably will not return because of how poor the customer service is here.",,,
16,Laura D.,"Austin, TX",0,10,0,5.0,7/21/2017,"We just returned and had an incredible stay.  Excellent location, superb service, very helpful employees at front desk and clean rooms.  It is a great bang for your buck.  We traveled with a 5 and a 4 year old.  We fit fine in the rooms.  They are small but you spend such little time in there it doesn't matter.  Great bar with great prices and you can sit outside and enjoy your drink.  William works in the breakfast area and is excellent.  Loved him!  Food is good especially since it's included in the price.  Definitely will be back!Loved it with 2 small children!",1,,
17,Kelly H.,"Roselle Park, NJ",0,5,0,5.0,3/30/2018,"Stayed here for a quick work trip from NJ. The staff was super courteous and helpful (shout out to Robert bc that's the only name I remember!). Our room (16th floor) had a floor to ceiling window overlooking the street! The bar is small and quaint and my fiancé said the bartender was cool (I had to work so I didn't get to experience the bar so much!). We ate at Keens Chophouse, which is right next door, and it was beyond delicious (expensive yes but well worth it). Stay here! You won't regret it :)",,,
18,Glenn L.,"Pikesville, MD",36,207,8,4.0,11/7/2015,"We had some best western points to burn, and since we were planning a NYC trip decided to give this hotel a try.Advice to other travelers, do NOT expect this hotel to be like the Mid-town Hilton.   It's much cheaper, and you get what you pay for.  1) Your room will be small2) The bathroom - shower will be small with little counter space3) There is a very small lobby That said, this hotel has some very good points;1) Very friendly front desk staff that treats you personally and seems to value your vusit2) Excellent FREE breakfast 3) Central location in a good/safe area of the city.It's not a top of the line botel, but I would stay there again",1,,1
19,David F.,"Pismo Beach, CA",0,18,1,5.0,6/26/2016,"Stayed for 6 nights, June 2016.  You have to recalibrate your expectations if you're staying in Manhattan.  Room rates that would get you a private suite with a hot tub and a bottle of Veuve in Vegas might not even get you your own bathroom in the Big Apple. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the size and decor of the room.  The bed was weird - queen width but short, whoever got up first always bumped each other's feet in the morning walking past - but it was soft and fairly comfy.  There were two nightstands with small drawers and one dresser with 3 amply sized drawers, each wide enough to lay a pair of pants flat.  A slide-out writing desk gave extra space to the slimline table, whose lamp had a charging port.  The pod coffeemaker worked fine.  The room was clean and looked newly renovated - silicone tile grout in the bathroom was still stark white and a bit sticky.  Shower was narrow but long enough for 2 if you like that; no tub, and the bathroom door and shower door pretty much covered the whole bathroom floor with their swings.  Window opened out to a rather dramatic view of the ESB - if you craned your neck.  The safe was just barely large enough for my 15"" Macbook, not big enough for my opposite number's clunkier 15"" windows laptop.Shameza at the front desk was wonderful, and the bartender, whose name I didn't catch, was great to us - I enjoyed drinking in his lounge enough that we bypassed other places to come back and catch a drink there.  The night desk crew was also very helpful when one of our room keys demagnetized.  The room - south side - was quiet and we were not bothered by elevator noise, but the housekeepers definitely seemed to go out of their way to make as much noise as possible early in the morning when we would have preferred to sleep in.Location was perfect - Broadway, Herald Square, Macy's, the Empire State building, Koreatown, Rockefeller Center, and about a dozen soccer-themed Irish bars in walking distance; and nearly every subway line and other transit connection you could ever want.  I believe Airtrain plus the subway/NJ Transit probably beats a cab on price, time and convenience.  I felt safe walking at all hours of day and night around the place.And the prices were reasonable, again, for NYC - not for anywhere else in the world.  But final word, I'd stay here again and recommend it to anyone I was trying to impress.",1,1,
20,Bryan S.,"North Bethesda, MD",17,99,177,5.0,8/6/2016,"For the location, service, cleanliness, and overall experience, not much can compare in the time square area.  There was complimentary breakfast, the wifi was good and customer service was exceptional, especially Bebe and Jay.  It is literally steps from many of the popular tourist attractions.  They also have a small bar lounge that was very quaint and good priced.",,,
21,Kathie W.,"Springfield, VA",0,28,0,4.0,10/8/2017,Reasonable value for a stay in generally overpriced Manhattan.  Room was small but adequate.  Bed was comfortable enough. Not a lovely view--side alley.  Everything was sparkling clean . Breakfast was fine although some other guests had to wait for a free table.  Great location if you want to browse through Macy's mother store and attend Broadway theatre.,,,
22,Jennifer B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",14,11,2,5.0,10/2/2014,"I would highly recommend this hotel! The front desk staff is so helpful and polite! The gal at the front,(I lost her card) helped me locate my husband! Long story...but she really went above and beyond.Aside from the wonderful staff, the rooms were small, to be expected in NYC, but VERY clean. We had 2 adults and 2 children in our room. I wouldn't try to fit anymore than that.  The location can't be beat! Walking distance to everything!We will definitely stay at this hotel again.",1,,1

The location is perfect for whatever type day or night you are trying to have. The hotel staff was very pleasant and the hotel is next to a spat that serves breakfast. The room was comfortable, clean,  A/C worked perfect and I had a view. There is a sitting area in front of the building, good for people watching. There are plenty of places to eat, drink, and shop. It is New York ( I love NYC). I checked the price day after checkout the room goes for $250 and up...ouch!!!!  I would definitely stay here again if I could get a good deal.",1,,
24,Max W.,"Rochester, MI",115,16,3,4.0,10/2/2015,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Came during a busy time, right after the Pope and during the UN General Assembly. The price was high, but compared with other hotels throughout the city, it was the same price, as it is NY.Stayed two nights, and the location is perfect. Right on 36th street between 5th and 6th Ave., with a subway stop about a block away. Only took advantage of the breakfast when we arrived early after our flight, but it included eggs, cereal, sausage, pancakes, toast, bagels and more. The breakfast room was small, but we were able to find a table.As for our room, we had two beds, which were very comfortable, and the room was bigger than I thought it was going to be. Nice bathrooms, very modern with art throughout the room. The staff was also amazing, and very helpful checking in, checking out, storing our luggage before we check in and after we checked out, and when getting up transportation back to the airport.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and would love staying here again.",1,,
25,Ludwig K.,"Stockholm, Sweden",10,61,41,4.0,4/15/2015,"I would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel for any visitor to New York City. It is located at a central location, has excellent service and feels clean and modern.However, the reason it doesn't get five stars, is because of the breakfast services. They offer a good range of food, and it varies every morning (everything from bacon and eggs to pancakes and sausages), but the room is way to small to fit all the hotel's guests. Some mornings people have to wait in line outside the room in order to get a table, and the line stretches all the way to the elevator. The hotel can improve on this by getting smaller chairs (the current ones are unnecessarily large) so they can fit more tables.",4,,2
26,Ben H L.,"San Jose, CA",308,1628,73,3.0,9/28/2013,"I stayed here for the first two nights of my NYC trip and although the location is great and centrally located within Manhattan, the beds were not so great for me.  After doing an entire day of walking all around the city, I usually depend on a long restful night of sleep for recovery.  For the two nights that I slept here, I did not get great sleep.  I woke up still aching from the previous day which showed that their beds weren't sturdy or solid enough to support a heavier type guy like myself.  Besides the bed issue, the room itself was great...nice TV and bathroom/shower unit.  I never had the free breakfast because I was still jet lagged from my flight.  The front desk always was smiling and welcoming whenever we came in and left the lobby area.   They also stowed our luggage for us on the day on our checkout day too.  The rooms are relatively larger than the average Manhattan hotel room.    With a less than supportive bed,  this value priced hotel in Manhattan could work for you if you luck out and perhaps get a better bed.",2,,

28,Melodi R.,"Vancouver, WA",547,379,1556,2.0,11/8/2013,"Pros: Location! Price. It's new and clean! Free wifi. Free breakfast. Pleasant staff.Cons: my room, on the top floor was smallish, but the air vent was right over the bed. It blew constantly...hot up to my thermostat temp and then cold. By the second night I had to request another blanket. Hot water seemed to take a very long time to reach my floor. I'm not a fan of the ceiling shower heads. It's hard to keep your head dry on non-shampoo days and hard to rinse soap out of long hair on shampoo days.Un-used amenities: gym, bar, fitness center, in room coffee maker but they're here!I'd stay here again in a pinch, but not my first choice with so many other hotels on the block.",1,,

That's about the only positive.Cons:The room is on the small side, but doable and didn't bother me.Zero internal soundproofing.  I could hear the person in the room next to me sneezing. The doors to the rooms are so loud!! The constant slamming sound makes it impossible to sleep at night. Housekeeping is always present on the floor(s) starting as early as 8:00am-----It was such a disturbance. This also means be woken up at 8AM by vacuuming, banging and housekeepers talking VERY LOUDLY to one another ( this happened during all 3 nights). This was my biggest issue. I don't know how mgmt allows them on the floors so early in the morning and/or allows them to be so inconsiderate.  I don't know that I've ever had a more frequently interrupted sleep.Unfortunately,  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,,

The front desk staff ALWAYS greeted us when we left for the day and when we came back later. The showers. Omg the showers. It was like taking a shower underneath a waterfall! I could have seriously spent hours just in the shower alone.  The beds were very comfortable and they don't skimp on the fluffy pillows.

34,Fiona M.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",15,68,154,4.0,3/12/2016,"Good location for a short trip as very central, short walk from Penn Station or Macys. It's a small hotel which I liked. Room not the smallest I've stayed in in NY and felt spacious enough. Was immaculate. High point is the small ground level bar and outside patio area at the back. Breakfasts (included in price) are good for a Bagel junkie like myself but lacking fresh fruit. Free WiFi. Hairdryer and decent toiletries supply. Room was about £125 per night so excellent value for NY. I'd stay here again.",,,
35,Margaret P.,"Cypress, TX",216,155,158,4.0,3/16/2016,"The bed was comfy, the room was nice and tidy. We faced an office building which was interesting to watch at times. The bathroom was nice and modern. There's a safe in the room. Staff members are nice. The only downside is the gym only had one treadmill, one bike, one eliptical, and one bench. The treadmill would take a long time to speed up when you set the pace, then it would go super fast. Breakfast is free and there's free coffee in the lobby. It's a walking distance to Times Square.",,,
36,Jon L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,0,4.0,6/8/2016,"Pros: One block from NQR-BDFM lines. 2 Blocks from 123-ACE lines and Penn Station. Fair priced. Good shopping options and restaurants down the block. Free Breakfast with excellent breakfast attendants. Front desk was very accommodating, even having to change rooms twice (1st room had a view of the back alley, nope. 2nd room had street views but AC unit broke.) Cons: This is being nit picky but the housekeepers never gave us enough towels or replenish enough toiletries. I don't expect them to count towels when cleaning but it was just annoying having to call down everyday. Sometimes housekeeping would be up early. Rooms are small. Would not recommend for a party of 4 if you want to have space to move around for the hours you are not exploring the city. Side Note: Ryan, no idea what his job title is, but he is the embodiment of what hotel staff should be everywhere. Great guy.",,,
37,Brenda T.,"Norcross, GA",343,165,2573,3.0,4/10/2014,"Biggest plus is LOCATION and easy access, by foot or train, uptown to Times Square and Central Park and downtown to Chelsea Market and Union Square. Popular bagel spot (Best Bagel and Coffee) one block over off of 35th or get your bibimbap (signature Korean mixed rice dish) on at Cho Dang Gol also nearby. The hotel only has 6 rooms on each floor so the structure is high and situated closely to other buildings. As much as I love natural light, I had to keep my curtains closed during my stay. I suggest staying on level 8 or below to avoid waiting too long for the elevator. If you're a light sleeper, be sure to request a room away from the elevator (rooms ending in 05 and 06 are your best bets). There is complimentary coffee and tea in the small lobby plus gym, internet, breakfast and evening reception all included. The room was smaller than what you will find in nearby hotels such as the Hilton Garden Inn (HGI) and Hampton Inn so it can be loud as your neighbors come and go from their rooms. The shower was comfortable, good water pressure and climate control was in check. The front desk will also arrange taxi service but just know that they use their own company, not the yellow cabs, and fares will run about $7 more if you're headed to LaGuardia.A solid hotel pick but all things equal, I would still opt for the HGI if they have rooms available.",2,,

They have a full breakfast every am and everything is fresh and hot. The staff are amazing and help in anyway they can. The place was always clean, and they have coffee and cold water in the lobby for you. The maids do an amazing job and cleaning up your room each day, and if you need anything extra just call down to the front desk, they will get you hooked up. The hotel is is a great location and has a good view of Empire State Building.",,,
40,Audrian N.,"Westminster, CA",83,156,33,1.0,7/2/2013,"This review is total about the Middle Eastern male receptionist who worked graveyard shift on Monday 07/01/13.I got back to the hotel around midnight, met him for the first time, politely asked if we could check out late on Tuesday . Without looking back at me, he told me that the most I could get was 30', which mean I had to check out at 11:30 am. I understand that this is NYC, people are not nice, they don't give a sh.t about u, but this is his JOB, he gotta be nice to ME.Let s move forward. The next morning, 10:30am, someone already called me and ask if I wanted to stay for another day!?!?!? This showed that he did not even take my request down, which pissed me off even more.Next was silly me clumsily asked him to call me a local taxi. I needed to go from 36th and 6th to 29th and 7th. Instead of getting me a yellow cab, he got me one of those limousine-look-a-like taxi which charged me $25 for any local trip (for a yellow cab would have been $10-$12)House keeping cleaned my room without restocking shampoos and soaps.I do not understand what is so premier about this hotel????",2,,

42,Wendra M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,13,0,5.0,9/12/2016,"I've stayed here twice (once in the winter, once in the summer), it is a great place to rest your head after a busy day in the city.  It is comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet.  The little bar in back has a very small but tasty menu if you're just to tired to go out for one last meal.  It is an easy walk from Penn station and to Times Square/Central park.  Great short morning walk to some lovely bakeries near Bryant Park.  The folks at the front desk are great; very helpful and pleasant.  I'm already looking forward to my next stay!",,,
43,Liz G.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,0,3.0,2/21/2014,"Elevators are horribly loud all night long. Strong banging sound through the night, making it impossible to sleep. Hotel manger, please fix this. Several guests at breakfast complained about them...on all floors. Shower head is not wall mount, but overhead. Bad pressure. Dripped water like a light drizzle. Hot water takes a while. Bed so-so. In-room thermostat didn't work well. Either stifling hot or too cold. Air vent right above bed, meaning air blows on you all night. Decent breakfast, although all premade Sysco stuff. Scrambled egg patties, sausage patties, oatmeal & breads. Bananas and apples wrapped in plastic. Cereal & milk available. Coffee so-so. Central location with nice front desk staff, very helpful. Small but useful gym. Free wi-fi with coffee, tea and water in lobby. Nice touch, wrapping the remote in a clean bag. Not great views, but for the price, OK. Give it a C+. Please, fix the elevator noise. Then, I'll return.",1,,
44,Jamie B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,18,0,3.0,11/10/2015,"Gets the job done. Smaller size room compared to other similar priced hotels in the area. Price does include breakfast but we never ended making it down. Not a big deal, but it is annoying when these hotels push the whole green thing but still take your towels when they are hanging up in the bathroom. Also, they have some seating out front and you must walk through smokers almost every time you leave or come back to the hotel.",,,
45,Jen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,17,0,2.0,1/25/2014,"If it weren't for my few pros below, I'd want to give this place no stars because of the front desk.  When I checked in around 11pm the front desk agent was so rude and you could tell she didn't want to be there.  When I came back down to request something she was chatting it up on the phone.  I waited patiently.  She didn't hang up.  She said, ""hold on,"" to who ever she was on the phone with and looked at me with this ""what do you want?"" Face.  Really? Why work at a hotel if you're so terrible at customer service?  There wasn't a single smile...she made me feel like I was bothering her!!!  Another complaint is how cold the room was.  Cold air was blowing in through the window so I had to turn the heat up to 80 to stop shivering.  The blankets were way too thin for the blistering cold winter weather we've been having and the beds were terrible.  I must have woken up 5 times in the middle of the night.  Only pros and the only reason this place is getting two stars - good breakfast and great breakfast staff.  Too bad the pros arent good enough to make me want to return....",,1,
46,Eagle N.,"Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands",9,156,23,3.0,9/1/2013,I stayed one night. I arrived early and had the joy of checking in with Sade. She was professional and had pleasant vibe about her. Front desk agents may not know it but a smile or being pleasant can help after a long trek. I normally stay in NJ as rooms are larger than NYC rooms.Rooms here were typical size for NYC just big enough to squeeze between a desk at the foot of the bed. The mattress was okay nothing to rave about like at the Hyatt or Westin.  It was comfortable and bed had plenty of pillows.Like someone once told me its NYC you are going to be out most of the day so only need space for bed and all the items you will purchase on visit. Bathroom was a nice size and shower had great water pressure and was roomy enough for two to shower in comfortably. The room was clean and smelled fresh without that heavy fragrance smell of a air-freshner.Television was not bad had direct tv.I did like that they had put remote in a sanitary bag to indicate it had been cleaned.The breakfast was continental nothing special but if you have kids the cereals etc will keep them happy. They had oatmeal and a few hot items.I had a enjoyable stay at this location. If I was given a great rate again and in the area I would consider staying here again. It was centrally located and good shopping in area and easy to hop buses going uptown or downtown.,1,,
47,Heather H.,"Columbus, OH",18,110,217,3.0,12/10/2013,"This hotel is fairly new and does not have clear signage up yet. It was a great price and a perfect location - so close to Macy's Herald Square! I think they still need to work out the kinks on service. And the lobby is small - even by NYC standards. That said, many folks were trying to check in early and we seemed to be piled on top of each other. The Pros: complimentary breakfast in a spacious lower level space. The staff at breakfast VERY friendly! Price. True Kind size bed. And location. Cons: Maid service never got to us. We were only there 2 nights and never had our room made. Was not able to print boarding pass at business center because the computer was not connected or showed error message. Elevators slow. Room temperature difficult to adjust. And like another reviewer posted, the shower water took a bit to warm up. Just let it run a few minutes before hopping in - you will thank me!",,,
48,Lourie G.,"Florence, SC",22,32,38,4.0,1/21/2014,Cute little gem of a hotel.  Great service from every employee.  Hotel is 3 blocks from Macy's and about a 10 minute walk from Times Square. Lots of Irish bars on this street.  The only thing I had a problem with was the internet speed.  It is complementary though.  Breakfast was very good.  Fantastic shower!  The bar lounge is cozy with a fantastic bartender!  Rooms are Typical size for hotels in NY.  Overall good stay!,,,
49,B K.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,47,7,4.0,9/10/2013,"I found this hotel and booked it for their great low rate.  Since hotel is new operating since May I figured it would be clean, new etc.  Its a great little hotel, normal ny size rooms, very clean, great location, the staff was very friendly.  LOVE the coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day, that was amazing to keep you going & not always have to go to starbucks to get it.  one computer with internet was nice, small gym was cool.  the breakfast was not great but its free so you can at least get a bagel, yogurt, banana, cereal, etc.  the fake eggs were not something i would eat.  for the price this hotel was FANTASTIC.  i will definately stay there again & recommend to my friends.",1,,
50,Michael C.,"Warwick, NY",0,211,1,4.0,2/10/2015,"I'll give this place 4-stars and I'll tell you why. BWs don't always have a stellar rep east of the Mississippi. I've found they are a more reliable stay when in the Western US. Maybe times are a changing. Based on a great AAA price of $86 plus tax and the other great reviews, I decided to risk it. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the service was very friendly. I got a 15th floor room facing north. The window wall slants in -- a cool design feature. The room was clean. the view was spectacular. The LEED Platinum Bank of America building spire is the focal point. I liked the funky wall art. Everything worked. I have two complaints -- there was a weird elevator machinery clicking noise AND like many other hotels with limited bath shelf space, they put the bath towels beneath the sink and while they put them as far from the toilet as possible, in my mind, still too close... Oh well, nothing is perfect. Tip, they have a free breakfast with hot food selections -- that's a good deal! Cheers!",1,,
51,K S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,38,0,4.0,6/18/2015,"Great location. Rooms are small (we stayed in a regular king room), but the bathroom is a decent size, which is important to me. The regular king room is fine for two people, and again, you really can't beat the location.",,,
52,Carolita B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,0,4.0,1/12/2015,"I used to live in New York, and was home for the holidays.  We were looking for a place to stay 2 days before New Year's Eve that wouldn't bankrupt us.  We didn't necessarily want midtown.  We wanted more of a neighborhoody area like Soho, Upper West Side or Tribeca, but those places were booked up or extremely expensive. And then we found a room with 2 standard beds at Best Western Premier for under $225 on Priceline.  Make no mistake, the hotel is small and the rooms are small--we called it the Hobbit hut--but they make a great use of the space.  And it's decorated nicely with artwork depicting NYC landmarks all over the place.  The near floor to ceiling windows also makes it seem a little larger, and if you face south and you're on a high enough floor, you can see the Empire State Building.  Even though we weren't in our area of choice, Macy's and the many train lines at the Herald Square station were only a block and a half walk away, so we were able to get anywhere in the city quickly.  And it was easy to walk to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Broadway and the East and West sides.  The hotel has one of the sweetest little bars I've ever seen, complete with an outdoor patio where you can sit when the weather's nice.  There's a happy hour from 4-7 where beer and wine is four bucks and well drinks just $5. That's close to highway robbery in NY.  And brands like Bacardi and Jim Beam are considered Well there.  There's even a fitness room with free weights, treadmills, bikes.  And the included breakfast isn't continental.  I had scrambled eggs and bacon and enough food to keep me going till lunch.  Also, the staff was wonderful.  We called for extra washcloths and they were there almost as soon as we hung up the phone.  And one of the bartenders recommended a downtown lounge to us that we ended up raving about.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",,,
53,Derek C.,"Calgary, Canada",10,31,0,4.0,9/27/2013,Travelling to New York on a budget I booked the Best Western Herald Square.  The hotel is in a great location.  The front desk staff was very helpful and checked us in quickly.  They also were very helpful in assisting us in getting around NYC.  The hotel offered a breakfast which was great and a bit of a surprise to us.  The rooms are very small...not a surprise in NYC.  They were however very clean and new with a large flat screen TV.  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.,2,,
54,Tom C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,0,5.0,8/5/2014,"After an hour flight from Buffalo and taking the Howard Beach subway from the airport and walking to the hotel on a hot and humid day this hotel was a godsend!  The front desk greeted us warmly with a smile.  Our room keys were ready within a minute.  This is a quaint hotel.  The lobby has coffe/tea, water available 24/7 and is a welcome refreshment at the start and returning from our daily excurtion.  There's a small bar in the back and happy hour prices are reasonable.  We stayed on the 16th floor executive room facing 36th St which has no view of the Empire State Building but had a view nonetheless. We had a king size bed which was very comfortable.  The room has air con, safe, large screen TV and a coffee maker.  There are numerous power outlets including the table lamps and bedside lamps.  Free wi-fi is nice but the connection speed was spotty (my phone's hotspot was way faster).  The bathroom was adequately sized but had to wait around a 45 seconds for the hot water in the shower to come through.  The included breakfast was great and they varied the selections every day and was well stocked (730-930).  Come early for breakfast because the room gets filled up fast.  You can also take your breakfast to your room if there's no seating.  Outside there's a seating area if you just want to relax.  Construction next door is ongoing and they start rather early but the noise wasn't that bad.  The hotel is close to everything including the subway which is a plus.  Walking distance to Times Square, Empire State building, Bryant Park, Herald Square is a plus and there's plenty of eateries and shopping in the area.  We stayed green using the same towels and bedsheets for our 6 day stay.  If you take a shower prior to bedtime your sheet should stay clean is my motto.",,,
