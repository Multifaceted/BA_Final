Updated review","Its been a while since I was at The Daisy, but that's because business has been booming and, well, with all the investigations going on in Washington, it made sense for me to keep a low profile.  It was such a low profile that I would walk by The Daisy in hat, sunglasses and a scarf wanting to be Incognito, you know, that town in Guadalajara, Mexico.Enough of that.  When I saw the red velvet rope line late one night on 85th Street, I just had to venture in again.  I mean a red velvet rope line?  That's code in some many of the countries I visit that you can't even find on Google Maps! Nick the barman was in such fine regalia and spinning some amazingly delicious cocktails at me.  Then the small plates were wonderfully delicious as well.  In fact delish, delish and delish was the whole night as I made new friends and fettered off into the wee late hours of the night...Next time you see the red velvet rope line....well, do venture in, experience and make new friends....",,,
1,Laura B.,"Houston, TX",61,19,1,2.0,9/15/2018,"Kitchen closed at 4:30 - okay, we'll just have beers. And be ignored.  Literally 2 waitresses came by, eyed our empty glasses and failed to ask if we either wanted refills or the check.  Check please.  I had the quaintly titled ""It Ain't So!!"" ... tasty but tiny - maybe worth $7 but certainly not $14 at that size (basically a shot in one of those diminutive old fashioned champagne glasses).  Waited far too long for someone to come with our tab, had to go in (from our lovely but rickety sidewalk table) asking for it.  Not sure how long The Daisy has been open but they can't rest on their petals being across from Wahlburgers and Five Mile Stone.",,,
2,Carly L.,"New York, NY",171,239,229,3.0,10/29/2018,"Overall a cute brunch spot, but small and pricey portions and the taste was just okay. We tried the ESPN Or Something cocktail, which had a good coffee taste but was unbelievably small (especially for $12). It wasn't very strong, either. As for food, we had the B.E.L.T sandwich and the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Both were not bad tasting, but I was still hungry after the Smoked Salmon Benedict. The poached eggs on the Smoked Salmon Benedict weren't runny inside the way a good poached egg is; it was like it sat under a hot lamp for a little too long. The home fries were really good; well seasoned and crispy on the outside.",1,,
3,Brenae L.,"Manhattan, NY",164,140,271,4.0,2/22/2018,"This place is perfect for a girls brunch or dinner. The drinks all have quirky names (at dinner they were hip-hop themed, brunch was Mean Girls-themed as part of a special they were doing) and are delicious. I had a prosecco cocktail that was a nice change for brunch.I had a delightful waffle sandwich that I would totally order again during brunch and a duck dish for dinner that I thoroughly enjoyed too. The atmosphere is perfect for hanging out with 2-3 friends and catching up.",,,
4,Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",495,794,740,4.0,5/19/2018,Really lovely brunch! Came in for the first time and walked away know there will definitely be a second and third and so on. The duck hash was super tasty! Loved it! One of my fav brunch dishes to date! Mmmmm! And the place is super beautiful. Loved the ambiance.,2,,
5,Betsy S.,"Delray Beach, FL",1095,414,3336,3.0,7/23/2018,"I stumbled upon this place with my friend as we were looking dor a place to have brunch/lunch. And we found The Daisy! We sat outside and we were able to talk and talk! Our waitress, Samantha was gr8! I had ordered a shrimp salad with anchovies and the anchovies really tastes like fishy sardines! She took it back without question! I had a frittata with mushrooms and spinach and it was delicious! I also had hot coffee (instead of the cold brew for $6.50 which she so gracefully told us and we said no ty!). We enjoyed everything there. Later in the day, I couldn't find my Amerixan Express card so I called up the restaurant but they didn't have it. I had no fraudulent activity on the card but I cancelled it anyway. Ironically when I got on the subway (the Q train) I was sitting opposite the hostess (I recognized her because she had on these very pretty yellow tassel earrings). It was such a NY coincidence! I talked to her and she told me she was going to work on Sunday at 10 am and would look for it and call me. Well, I found my card in an odd place with my money and I had no way to call the woman. She ended up texting me and telling me she looked for the card but it wasn't there. I wrote her back to let her know that I indeed found it and that she should continue wearing the yellow tassel earrings because they bring her good luck. Ximena is truly a gem and was a woman of her word! So all in all, it was a good meal and a good person to person experience!",11,4,9
6,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,3.0,3/24/2018,"I love the cocktails and atmosphere here, especially in the back room. Shimmy up to the bar for some serious talent in crafting of these fine drinks and catching up with a friend are some of my favorite things. I love close by and would like to love this place more,  it it's been a bit of hit and miss on brunch when I've been here. The eggs were not the best, I ordered a Benedict and asked that the eggs be cooked soft... even said, make the yolk runny and soft please and it still arrived hard boiled. I couldn't eat it. I gag at hard boiled eggs after a bad Easter egg as a child. Lol. Cocktails are spot on though.",,,
7,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",252,505,1,3.0,6/10/2018,Decent renovation of mollys pitcher and another example the UES is starting to change its weak restaurant offering.  The service was solid - the food wasn't memorable.  Group of four left lamenting it could have been more with the solid start on the atmosphere.  Here is to hoping they can.,1,,1
8,Kayla C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",322,45,164,3.0,2/3/2018,Got drinks with my friends here on a Saturday night. The bar wasn't packed but had a nice young crowd. The place was dimly lit and seems like a good place to meet a date for drinks. The music and vibe was fun and really got our night started. The bartender was really friendly and cooked up some interesting new drinks for us and grapefruit infused vodka spritzer- awesome. Drinks were a little pricey but it was a fun and classy place to start the night- will go again next time I'm in the UES!,,,
9,Rolanda B.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",40,139,299,5.0,1/3/2018,Had a really good time here this week. It was a slow night so we had the staff all to ourselves but they were very kind and attentive. Answered all our odd questions about the unique  decor and even let me order a bunch of different sauces for my burger. And their burger was good! A basic burger with American cheese but cooked well and full of flavor. I will def be back when I'm on the upper east side. Next time I'm hoping to catch happy hour,1,,
10,Alex S.,"Manhattan, NY",173,88,44,2.0,11/18/2017,"Came here for brunch, didn't have a reservation and sat down right away. I ordered Eggs Benedict, but in theory it should have been called ""Egg Benedict"" because it was only served with one egg (see picture). Which was a bit absurd because they charge $17 for it.  Anyway, I said something to one waitress asking if this was correct that I really only came with one egg and her response was ""sorry I don't work in the kitchen"". The other waitress promptly went back to the kitchen and got me another egg. Regardless the food was OK. Doubt I will be coming back here again for brunch. There are better options on the UES.",4,,
11,Nick H.,"New York, NY",127,83,48,4.0,7/14/2017,"The Daisy is a fairly upscale restaurant with comfy booths and a great cocktail menu. Sitting inside is a really solid experience. The outdoor area leaves a little to be desired however. It's a little cramped and the tables aren't exactly level. But on a nice day it's totally worth it.The food is solid, some are just trying a little too hard but it's an experience.Cocktails are really the best part, just going to cost you quite a bit.",,,
12,Courtney C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,7,0,1.0,4/17/2018,"I went to The Daisy for brunch last Sunday and I can't seem to shake off how unbelievably terrible our experience was from start to finish. I usually try to only write positive reviews for places that deserve it, but The Daisy is by far one of the worst places I've been to in NYC (I've lived here for 10 years and bartended and waitressed for most of it) and I feel obligated to tell other New Yorkers to avoid it. I must preface this with I swear I'm not a miserable person who writes negative reviews to make themselves feel better about their own sad life.The waitress (who we thought was a hostess) was wearing a crazy inappropriate tan silk romper that was covered in stains. Her bralette was also out for the front and back of house to see. It looked like she was out the night before, had a one night stand, and was called into work a brunch shift last minute on a Sunday and went straight in.My girlfriend ordered a spicy cocktail that looked like hot ketchup, she couldn't drink it but they took it back no problem which gave us hope.The waitress forgot to put in my chicken and waffles entree - no big deal - but when my order came out literally 5 minutes later, I knew something was up. I cut into it and the chicken was COMPLETELY raw. Like throw up in my mouth raw. I can't believe I didn't flip out, but I was nice about it and quietly told the waitress it was undercooked. You can tell she was so embarrassed. The manager came over. Apologized and said she would take care of it and have the chef ""personally"" make me a new dish. Which I'm not sure who ""personally"" made it the first time. I ordered a well done burger instead because I definitely couldn't eat chicken for like a week after that sight (honestly still throwing up in my mouth a bit) The manager kept bringing out side orders of fries until the burger came out about 15 minutes later. And usually the more fries, the merrier. But it was just a weird move. In the meantime, we were drinking these brunch cocktails in wine glasses and the stems were so sticky on each of them. We ordered a different cocktail off the menu and it came out looking like a half drank melted down drink that we thought was an ash cup. I got the burger, wasn't hungry because of all the extra fries. The manager came over, gave our check and took a bold 20% off the top. Not for nothing, I've worked in a ton of restaurants and if a piece of chicken went out of the kitchen that raw, it warrants a totally comped bill. Or at least more than 20%. We still tipped 20%.... I think at the time we were embarrassed for them and felt bad.There are plenty of other places on the Upper East Side, go anywhere else.",5,2,
13,Lauren B.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,7,0,1.0,4/26/2018,"DO NOT BOOK YOUR PARTY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.Here's what happened to me...I had a contract signed and a party scheduled for Saturday, March 3rd. On Friday, February 23rd my grandpa went into the hospital and the first person I called was The Daisy to find out what our options were. James, the owner, said he would allow us to reschedule and gave us some dates.  We picked April 21st and finalized everything by Tuesday. On Saturday, March 3rd my grandfather died.By April 9th I had not heard anything from the bar and reached out with an email to get the ball rolling. On April 10th he replied with a cryptic email asking how many people we would now be, but there was no additional conversation. I spent the entire next week trying to get ahold of someone but it was radio silent. Tuesday, April 17th, 5 days before our party, we physically went to the bar to find out what was going on.It was only then that the restaurant's event planner told us that our room had been double booked. The other party had signed a contract well before we had switched our date. Please keep in mind that this was a date that he gave to us. Because of the extenuating circumstances, we planned everything around HIS schedule. If we had not marched ourselves to the bar in-person, I'm not sure if/when he would have told us about it. Maybe that day when we showed up to decorate? After this, it took an additional 24 hours for James to call me back. Three days before our party and he finally calls and tells us that we have no choice because the other group had a contract first. Meanwhile, we never would have chosen that date if he hadn't offered it to us.Ended up having to move the party to the front part of the restaurant because we weren't given enough notice to find an alternate private venue.It was a horrible experience and certainly not the party we were expecting when we signed the contract. The event coordinator was incredible and really bent over backwards to do what she could to make it a successful party, but the owner of the bar was one of the worst people I have ever worked with. Even though the end result was a great party- it could have been just has great somewhere else with much less stress.*By the way- I am a professional event planner in NYC and have worked with countless restaurant owners and banquet directors across the country and have NEVER been treated so poorly. This all can be avoided by choosing another venue.",3,,
14,D.j. D.,"Manhattan, NY",39,19,0,4.0,4/19/2018,"We were pleasantly surprised with the food! We split the green salad, the lobster ravioli and the skirt steak. The salad was savory and not overly dressed, the ravioli captured the lobster very well, and the steak was perfectly cooked with great flavor.Cocktails were on the sweet side for us; but the bar was stocked with fantastic array of tasty and original brands for us to try. If you're not looking for sweet, definitely take a walk up to the bar to inspect the selection!We'll be back.And one tip for the chef:Consider chopping the seafood and sprinkling it over the ravioli instead of having it intact as it is. This will ensure that there is some in every bite and balance the flavor of the pasta better. ;)",2,,

Updated review","I was there again This past Friday night. Excellent pate, fettucine and dessert. Bread pudding was amazing. The rest of my group had spaghetti, mussels, and chicken milanese. Everyone really enjoyed their meals, beers, and cocktails. It's nice to have the option to sit outside also. The staff are friendly and very accommodating!  I think a party was starting up in the lovely space in the back of the restaurant. Looks like a fab space for a private party.",,,
16,Lynn M.,"Manhattan, NY",13,107,6,2.0,2/4/2018,"When you screw up my brunch you don't get a second chance. Too bad as I  really wanted to like this place (I live a block away.) The two stars are for the nice welcome from the hostess, and a decent Bloody Mary.  However - when I order a dish that indicates a ""poached egg"" I anticipate breaking through to get all that yummy yolk. I received an egg minus any white - literally the size of a silver dollar - AND to make matters far worse-it was hard cooked.  I am not being dramatic here - solid as a rock.  Said something to the server. no apologies, or horrified look that one expects when someone over cooks an egg. I wasn't impressed with anything else, plus it was $63.00 for 2 - with only 2 drinks (excluding tip). Way overpriced and if you have a chef doing brunch service who can't cook an egg - then what is there really left to say?",5,1,1
17,Jo S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,41,3,2.0,8/1/2018,"I thought it was pretty bold to charge an automatic 20% gratuity, especially considering that the ""mimosas"" tasted watered down during the last 30 minutes of our bottomless brunch. The food was good, but the rest of it was a turn-off.",,,
18,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,815,371,4.0,8/8/2017,"I had THE best time here the other night. The menu is limited and the entrees pricey (20-something). But the specialty cocktails, 14, are actually worth the price. I steer clear of these concoctions because they're often low on booze and you end up spending a fortune, versus a martini or Manhattan. Cute names but I opted for a less sweet cocktail made with vodka rather than ""A Girl's Best Friend"" or something like that. Also the burrata appetizer, 15, was out of this world with a kick to it and giant portion. If all the food is as good as this appetizer it's well worth the money. But the best thing about the evening: THE BAND! So rare to hear Dixieland like this in the city. I meant to call them and find out the name but if you're interested, just give them a call. It was a Thursday evening and I hope that band becomes a regular event. Also the booths are large and comfortable. I'm sure it's hard to get one on a Friday or Saturday night but well worth trying for on a weeknight. Our server was terrific. I am definitely returning (it's a block or so from Q train stop, which is an added perk).",2,,2
19,Sandra G.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,17,39,5.0,4/13/2018,Had a great Friday evening!!! I had the pizza to start and the lobster ravioli! Delicious!!!

20,Ashly B.,"New York, NY",935,93,193,4.0,12/5/2016,"-First Impression- Super cute, yet small place. I was a bit skeptical the party I was with (9 in total) would be able to fit at one table comfortably, but the staff rearranged the tables for us a bit, which was nice! We were greeted by the super energetic bartender (didn't catch his name, but other Yelpers have posted pictures of him) and seated quickly by the hostess.-Food- The guacamole was great. We inhaled it! We also ordered a couple sides of bacon to share because... well... BACON. It looked a bit different than how I'm used to seeing it though. I'm guessing it was just prepared differently because it tasted fine! All the food was good (see pictures). Everything was prepared how we asked.-Service- Our server was the cutest little thing! She was so sweet and she even filmed the mannequin challenge for us LMAO! My receipt says her name is Gina, so I hope that's right. She was great! -Price- Very reasonable pricing for the amount of food you get plus 90 minutes of bottomless mimosas-Did Not Like- I wish there were more options on the brunch menu-Noteworthy- Gina! If you're reading this, YOU ROCK!-Recommended?- Yes! I'd like to come back here for dinner!",28,14,24
21,Tiffany L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",88,12,0,4.0,10/30/2018,"I've been to The Daisy for brunch three times now, and it's always been a great experience. On my last reservation, I requested the front window table and was delighted to find that the staff fulfilled my request! Brunch here is always a relaxed affair, which makes it great for catching up with friends. The noise level is low, the atmosphere is quiet and somewhat sleepy, and the staff are friendly and don't rush you out the door. The only downside is that the quality of the food can be a bit inconsistent; I've ordered the Egg Hash twice now, and the portion size/way the eggs were cooked seemed different the second time. Another drawback is that the iced coffee they serve is canned, which seems odd since coffee is such a staple of brunch. The menu is surprisingly well-priced considering the area (UES, close to the museums). I haven't had dinner or bar drinks here yet, so I can't comment on that, but overall, I'm fond of this place and will definitely be back.",,,
22,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,195,459,5.0,8/9/2017,"To give perspective, I went for an event, not for an average service. Anyone who is looking to rent a beautiful spot for a birthday party or work event, THIS is the place.Walking in on a rainy day, we were immediately relieved to discover how beautiful this place is. For the everyday patron, it looks perfect for a date night out, and an after work cocktail, but also serves brunch all at once.We started off with Luis, serving up some of the best cocktails weve ever had. Watching him work theres precision in his pour, accuracy in taste, and overall a real love for what he does. Theres no reason I should know his life, and he know mine, my wifes and her coworkers, thats someone who is genuine and wants you to feel comfortable. Eileen starts up on her end as well, and even though she was on the far side of the bar she made sure to take care of us on our side too!Food wise, the salmon and mushrooms blew everything out of the water with super savory flavor and crisp skin. The bolognese was also a favorite of ours with the bread. The only piece lacking at all was the chicken, it seemed out of place in the way that it just wasnt as spectacular.The ambience, the food, the staff, all amazing. We will be returning with our family soon, and again if we dont to see the same people!Thank you!",,,

25,Maddy O.,"Manhattan, NY",430,20,18,4.0,2/25/2018,"Could not complain! And I think it's because we went at the perfect time. Around 4pm my boyfriend and I stopped in for a drink on a rainy Saturday. Some people were eating and the bar was quite crowded but we were able to snag two open seats. The bartender was very well practiced and each cocktail was very well crafted. We both ordered drinks that weren't on the menu and the bartender was happy to accommodate our request. My boyfriend ordered a Moscow mule, which was a little sweeter than I'm used to, and I ordered a dirty martini with cucumber infused vodka which was definitely a switch up but turned out quite delicious and strong! I loved the atmosphere of this place - almost like a speakeasy, great gatsby vibe. We didn't order food but we could smell the Brussels sprouts from the table next to us and we knew we would need to come here again to try it out!A little on the pricier side, but I think the drinks were well worth it for the price. Great date night spot. I'm sure this place gets pretty crowded in the evening! We will definitely be coming again!",,,
26,Crêpe Diem ..,"Manhattan, NY",39,198,581,3.0,7/11/2017,"This place is super convenient to reach from the Q. We were super excited because upon checking the menu online, we saw it had gnocchi which I always love. But when we came in they told they weren't serving it (unsure if this permanent but if it is, please change the menu online to correspond). We instead ordered a frittata and the home fries (which were potato wedges but pretty good) and did the bottomless special.The special is surprisingly affordable for the city as is the food, but aside from the fries, the food was pretty bland. The frittata in particular I just found to be flavorless.Also, staff had a bit of an odd schtick in that if we even took a sip of water, they would over to refill our glass, so much so it got to be a little intrusive. And oddly enough, they were not this attentive to refilling my mimosa (which were great) and I had to flag someone down several times.That said it is a great deal which sort of explains the mediocre experience.",,,
27,Emily D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,10/22/2018,"i just hosted a surprise party at the Daisy on Saturday and have never been so excited to write a review. It was an absolute blast and the staff that work there were the most accommodating and nice people I ever worked with. It was my first time hosting a big party and i had to change things around at the last minute and had a million questions, they worked with me to get it all done. Erica, who helped to execute all the details was FANTASTIC. They had back to back parties and still managed to keep everything on schedule. i will say I was nervous after reading some reviews on here that said otherwise, and I knew i had to write a positive review so that anyone considering hosting an event here knows they definitely should. My guests were raving about how awesome the back room was of a space and how great the drinks and food were. I cant wait to have another excuse to throw a party here! to the team at the Daisy, THANK YOU!",,,
28,Sylvia C.,"New York, NY",196,4,6,1.0,11/9/2017,"Sadly the brunch food was bland and/or overcooked and the service was terrible.My table waited almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive and the restaurant wasn't even packed. We called for the waiters several times and they kept saying the food was coming... it certainly did not.We order the avocado toast with poached egg to start and the egg was sooo overcooked. Not getting that lovely yolkporn action here. We shared the steak & eggs and dry aged burger. We asked for medium-rare on the steak, but it came out medium-well (more on the well) and the cut was tough to chew. This was the same with the burger. It was overcooked and bland. Luckily I ordered a side of bacon and put it in the burger. That was the saving grace on that. Honestly we were starving, but couldn't even finish that meal. Now I know why the restaurant wasn't packed. It seems like a nice place to have drinks, but I would pass on the food.",1,,
29,Nat G.,"Vauxhall, NJ",0,5,1,1.0,12/24/2017,"Way too much energy spent on decor, that time and energy would be best spent revamping the menu and finding a decent chef. Coming here was an oversight on our part, they have terrible signage, which made it harder to avoid. From the brunch menu I thought I would make a safe choice with the biscuits and gravy with a brat. The eggs were runny and bland, the gravy separated before it even got to me and tasted like nothing. The biscuit was burnt yet raw in the middle. Very disappointing. My friend had the eggs Benedict but the eggs were solidified - so no runny yolk on the raw/burnt biscuit. :( The succotash on the side was forgettable at best. Just don't. Walk a few blocks elsewhere. Plenty of choices around here.",,,
30,Aaron S.,"New York, NY",52,8,1,5.0,3/27/2018,"Honestly I don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews. I came in here around 7 pm last Tuesday and ate dinner at the bar. The vibe here is really great and definitely has a downtown feel that is a nice addition to the UES. The bartender was friendly and made me a tequila Manhattan. I ate the house salad (could have used less watermelon radish), the mushroom risotto app, and the parpadelle. The food was fucking delicious honestly. I could have eaten 5 of the truffle risottos it was so good. The pasta was spicy and had a crunch in it. It was all around one of the best mid-priced restaurants I've been to in the UES. I'll be back with friends next time!",1,1,1
31,Evan E.,"Montvale, NJ",0,163,0,2.0,9/4/2018,"The food is OK, and very over priced. Our party of four had brunch/lunch there and $6 for a iced coffee is absurd. $200 for brunch is wickedly costly",,,

33,Dania Daniella K.,"New York, NY",383,5,3,1.0,7/29/2018,"I would give no stars if I could. I run my own restaurant and if I had anyone on my staff be this inattentive they would be fired. I've been sitting for 15 minutes and no one has even said any sort of greeting, given me water OR EVEN A MENU. It is not even busy- all the workers are just sitting in a corner at the end of the bar and theres 3 other customers at the other end of the bar. One table is outside but the floor inside is empty. I feel bad for the bartender because he seems like he doesn't know what to do behind the bar which tells me he was not trained properly. He also seems scared to even approach me. Or so I thought until a man sat down at the bar and he immediately got water, he would check up on the 3 at the end of the bar, and he just completely walks past me. So now I'm wondering is this a race thing. The hostess is constantly on her phone and now she is sitting back down. It's ridiculous how disrespectful this place is haha. Terrible terrible TERRIBLE service- this goes out to the manager and owners. You should all know better and know what kind of staff you have representing your business.",,,

Very sweet and answered any and all of my questions. The private back room was already booked so we decided to have the party in the dining area, which I think turned out even better than the back room would have. Erica and the cocktail waitresses set up the space nicely and my husband's 30th birthday party here was a blast. The waitresses were very attentive and everyone in my party had a drink in hand at all times. I would highly recommend hosting a party at The Daisy!",,,
35,Brianna E.,"New York, NY",627,84,160,5.0,2/23/2016,"Great addition to the Upper East Side & NYC! Hosted a girls night (table of 4) here a few weeks ago and we LOVED it! Looks: beautiful decor & very clean. Of course it's new, but they really created a nice vibe -- and great music too!Service: excellent! Our waiter had fantastic recommendations & you could tell he not only knew the menu front and back but he took pride in what he was serving. Great to see someone prepared and happy to serve great food. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The menu is set up from smallest to largest portions. The Solo section containing times like 'UN Taco' start the menu & the robust/savory section end the menu, with items like the Filet Mignon. This is important to know before you order. Our waiter suggested ordering as you would at a Tapas restaurant if you did not pick a larger item from the Robust / Savory section.Food: wow! It was ALL good. We started with the guacamole & corn on the cob - all so fresh with such nice refreshing flavors. I had The Mac as my dish - unreal. The beef casserole IN the Mac was new & exciting! My friend had the Salmon special for the night - very fresh, clean and cooked perfectly. Another friend had the Octopus, which secretly I wanted to steal, it was very tasty. The final friend enjoyed her Arroz Con Pato - duck lovers dream! And we shared truffle fries .. My all time favorite! We were all full and happy! Can't wait to try more :)",3,,1

37,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,4.0,12/18/2016,"Stopped by for a quick cocktail.  Bartender was better than most.  Since the place has a Latin twist, they have a serious tequila-mezcal bar program.  But the bartender told me that standard cocktails are more successful with their local clientele.  I had an excellent Old Fashioned cocktail. The decor is very attractive - modern.  Music at Happy Hour is dance music - somewhat loud and very current.  At dinner hour they change over to jazz.  Friday nights they have a very popular DJ show - says the bartender. I did not try the food - kitchen is closed from 4 PM to 5 PM.  I was told that Happy Hour tacos are $3.00 which seems OK to me. Open for dinner seven days, open for brunch on weekends.Worth a try if you are in the neighborhood.",3,1,2

She was accommodating and understanding throughout the entire planning process + helped ensure flawless execution the day of the event. She helped with setup, floral selection, menu updates, drink recommendations, decor, setup, breakdown, dessert table... basically involved in every detail and was beyond helpful! The space is stunning! And the food... AMAZING! Every guest spoke so highly about their meals- the taste and presentation were on point!  I recommend the sea bass salad, avocado toast with poached egg, chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict (those were the items guest could NOT stop talking about)! Thank you to The Daisy and especially Erica so making my friends bridal shower so special and memorable. XO!",,,

So many late 20s - 30s seem to have found The Daisy as well. Some are looking for the boozy brunch vibe, while the table next to them had a few babies strapped onto moms. Seemed like a great cross-cut of the neighborhood. Plates have a Mexican influence on them, which is unexpected. Extensive cocktail menu. Had the avocado toast topped with a poached egg. The avocado was nice and citrusy. Will have to try it again at night.",,,
40,Brian R.,"New York, NY",91,124,58,4.0,11/2/2015,"Came in for drinks at the bar on a Saturday night at about 7pm.  Love the redesign of this place.  Total renovation from its days as Molly Pitchers.  Sleek, modern, low lighting, but definitely not stuffy or too luxe.  The cocktail list was solid, with 8-10 options, all priced around $12-14 dollars.  Bartender was great and the servers/hosts all seemed like they enjoyed working there.  The Daisy drink was great - not overly strong, but exactly as described. Overall, a great addition to the UES, and will definitely be back to try the food.",6,1,2
41,Joey L.,"New York, NY",137,283,495,5.0,1/8/2017,"Came here for the New Year's event, but since the open bar was everything on their drink menu, this should be the norm for their cocktails. Since it was a time to reflect on the year, we got some margaritas to start. Apparently there's a classic one and a fancier one on their menu (Black lips). The drinks were strong and crafted with expertise. We were also able to get a Honey and Hearth which was also a good warm drink for the soul (bourbon and ginger). The rest of the night we ended up with beer and anything simple since the bartenders were swamped. Normal prices are about $13 so it's not too bad for UES cocktails that have such detail. They had some hor d'oeuvres, and they were about average. Not sure if their actual food is any better. The place itself is very charming. There's the front bar/seating are and a smaller room in the back with another bar, but it is standing only. However, there's only one restroom in the back so be prepared to wait if it's packed.I would definitely come back another day to try more cocktails.",,,

It came out fireside burnt, goey tasteee just perfect!!

Flavor was strange. Cafe Habana's is way better. Presentation of the dish was on point though.-Pork tacos: delicious!

48,Katherine S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,18,0,3.0,7/15/2017,"I think this place might be what that real estate mogul was talking about when he said millennial couldn't afford mortgages because of avocado toasts. $14 for just some avocado and toast no extras is already a bit much, but typical for an nyc brunch. However, then you add on $4 for a single measly overcooked poached egg and another $6 for some extra protein and you may have the world's most overpriced meal! The dish itself tasted fine, just not $24 worth, the duck hash was way too salty, and the coffee was provided without any sugar or even Splenda until I asked (and then they weren't actually sure they even had sugar???).",,,
49,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,269,1028,3.0,6/13/2016,"Came to The Daisy for brunch on Sunday morning. My boyfriend and I both chose the bottomless prix fixe brunch menu, which is a flat $30 for all you can drink mimosas, bloody mary's, margaritas, and red/white wine for an hour and a half in addition to an entree. I've tried a couple different bottomless brunches in the city and this appears to be roughly the going rate. Pros: First, I liked that you pretty much had your pick of whatever entree you wanted. Some of the places in the city with tasting or prix fixe menus put supplements on so many items that the effective price is higher than advertised. However, the only option with a supplement was the steak and eggs (for an additional $5). I also prefer boozy brunches where a variety of drinks are offered. Some places, for instance, offer bottomless mimosas/bellinis but nothing else, and let's be honest, I don't want any more than like 2 mimosas in a row. So, I had an opportunity to try my first Bloody Mary and quickly realize that I don't like them. Lesson learned. I tried the white wine and I liked it but my boyfriend hated it and said that the New Zealand varietals are often likened to ""cat piss on a blackberry bush"".Our server was adorable and so sweet, and was incredibly attentive for when we needed a new drink. She was running herself ragged trying to serve all of her tables quickly and I appreciated how hard she was trying. Cute postcards near the door! The hostess let me take a few home, and they were a simple but nice touch.Cons: The food was just simply not that great. I really, really wanted to like it, because I'm always looking for cool little brunch places in the city. The fact of the matter is that it just wasn't tasty. I got the breakfast burrito which came with a side of home fries, and my boyfriend got the eggs benedict. My home fries were basically a lumpy, mushy pile of potatoes that was unseasoned (and coming from experience, I know it's not that hard to make a decent batch of home fries). The burrito was so average, and I think my boyfriend's eggs benedict missed the mark pretty substantially too. Also, the drinks were fine, but not good enough to convince me to overlook how disappointed we were with the food. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back, but it wasn't a god awful experience. With so many fantastic places on the Upper East Side, I'd say don't waste your time.",2,1,1
50,Trinh N.,"New York, NY",276,30,32,4.0,2/22/2017,"To start I got the Black Lips margarita that had a touch of lavender flavor and black salt on the rim. For my meal I went with the Broccoli and Cauliflower small plate. It's actually a cold dish which slightly alarmed me but I enjoyed it. The broccoli and cauliflower florets were charred and sat on a salty broccoli puree. Strips of prosciutto weaved through the vegetable and shaved cheddar dusted the top. Overall I think this dish was on the salty side. It felt light though and somewhat healthy. This is definitely a sweet, cozy place for date night. The interior here is beautiful. The tables all have lit candles which is nice but there are many spots at the bar too. It didn't get full throughout dinner time but it wasn't a dull vibe at all.",2,1,1

I wasn't drawn to go back but I knew about the private party room in the back and thought it would be a great place to host a 30th birthday party - plus they had availability close to Christmas. finalizing the booking/deposit and getting a confirmation was not smooth, but the private party was better than expected. I ordered 6 dishes from their catering menu which were quirky and mostly crowd-pleasing. the bartender, Luis was exceptional and he DJ'd for us the entire time. was suited for a younger crowd. the space is beautiful and i would definitely recommend hosting a party at The Daisy.",,,

A plus for outside tables and inside - tables, a bar, and a cute counter / bar with seating looking onto 2nd avenue - great for chatting and people watching. Interesting selection of drinks.  I said I liked Mezcel and the bartender came outside to give input and told us about a Mezcel creation not on the menu . I was unsure what I wanted and their service and recommendations, wonderful. I wasn't a fan of the custom Mezcel creation though my friend loved it so we traded.

The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, but had gotten much more crowded by the time we were leaving. We all opted for the bottomless brunch drinks, which was 1.5 hours of mimosas, bloody Mary's, margaritas and red and white wine for $19. The white wine (Sauvignon Blanc) was decent; however, the Bloody Mary tasted like flat, canned tomato juice and the mimosas tasted like extremely cheap champagne (one-sip headache). We did not try the margaritas. The food was decent. Four people ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which was really good, as was the gnocchi. Two people ordered the BLT, which was entirely too rich as it was made with very fatty pork belly. Neither person finished even half. The decor was nice with a lot of natural light.

The food was just okay - I got the egg scramble with pork belly and it was just ok.  It was literally just scrambled eggs with pork belly and potatoes on the side.

68,John Anthony D.,"Bronx, NY",111,30,0,2.0,2/20/2017,"Went to the Daisy yesterday for Brunch. My friend made reservations for 4 people at 2pm. I was really excited to try this place, since its always packed on the weekends and the reviews were great. We were seated pretty quickly, but it seemed like the staff was overwhelmed. Silverware was given out pretty last minute, we didn't get our glasses of water refilled at all during out two hour stay (even when i specifically asked for more). We came for the bottomless brunch, and maybe got our glasses refilled 3-4 times for the 2 hours we were there. Also, it seemed the people sitting outside got WAY more attention that us inside-people. The food itself was pretty good, EXCEPT, DO NOT GET THE LONG ISLAND BACON EGG AND CHEESE. IT IS SUCH A RIP-OFF. My friend got it, and its literally a bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll, wrapped in tin-foil. No sides, nothing special. $15 for literally what i described above. I had the chilaquiles nachos which were good. I also tried one of their bloody mary's, and it was SUPER salty and NOT spicy at all. I could barely guzzle it down. I had high hopes for this place, and it really let me down. I don't think i'll consider brunch here ever again.Pros: Good food, nice atmosphereCons: Poor Service, OVERPRICED NEW YORK CLASSIC, not a quality bottomless brunch, poor bloody mary",,,

Updated review","Place feels very comfy, both bar and sitting areas, nicely decorated, good music and t.g. No TV's..We had the Kale salad and corn to start, Kale salad is great with a beautiful presentation. Lamb burger was tasty as were the fries. While the Duck Wellingtons had a very nice presentation and sauce we didn't care for the duck which was chewy and the fat had not been rendered enough. Draft beer selection is nice, wine a little on the expensive side. Staff is very attentive and service was great. Overall very enjoyable and we will certainly be back. Went back recently and were disappointed, kale salad was a bunch of old chewy kale leaves poorly dressed, fish and chips was more breading than fish and chips were stale and greasy ...seemed like the cook wasn't cooking that day. Beer still good.",,,
72,Bekah C.,"Morristown, NJ",110,16,1,5.0,4/12/2017,"Amazing little brunch spot!! We got there around 1.30 so was after the busiest time but there was still plenty going on and had a lively atmosphere. Despite all the groups in the restaurant, it never got too loud. The tables were comfortable and arranged well, you didn't feel like you were sitting on the guests next to you and there was plenty of table space for the endless drinks. We got the salmon breakfast on potato pancake and steak and eggs to share for a girl's brunch day. For $19 we added the 1.5hr endless mimosas, bloodys and margaritas. Well worth it!! We could have had a lot more to drink but even 2 or 3 drinks made this a great value. Some of the other cocktails people had looked amazing and I can't wait to try them on our next visit. The only thing I would recommend is that the waiter/waitress comes round 20 minutes before your endless 1.5hr is up to warn you, but they had no problem with us grabbing another drink once we realized time was up. Definitely recommend it!",,,

75,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",342,242,298,3.0,2/8/2016,"I came to the Daisy for brunch with a large party. Unfortunately, you can only make a reservation for groups of 9 or more, which was fine since we were 10. We were originally seated in a private back area, which was very nice and perfect for an intimate gathering. We were then told that, that wasn't where we were supposed to sit and unfortunately had to move to the front. I ordered a short rib quesadilla, which was cooked to perfection. The meat was extremely tender, and though it had some kick, it wasn't spicy enough that it had me constantly reaching for my drink, which was perfect because the main negative of this place was that the drinks here were atrocious.The unlimited drinks brunch option is $30 and comes with unlimited margs, bloody mary's and mimosas. They bring pitchers to your table and whenever you run out they'll bring another pitcher to the table. The mimosas were pretty good. The bloody mary's (maries?)  seemed pretty weak. The margaritas were completely undrinkable. While they might not have been weak, there was completely way too much margarita mix in them and they were sour to the point where people were sweating. We sent a bunch of them back, but were met with more terrible margaritas. In the end though, we all had fun, so it wasn't the worst. The staff was very friendly and let us stay after we finished our meal to finish up whatever was left in our pitchers. I would return again, if someone posts a review that says that they fixed their margaritas, but otherwise I feel like there are brunch places with equally good food and drinks that don't dehydrate you for the wrong reasons.",,,

My friend and I had to seat ourselves when we walked in because no one was at the front. The only open table was dirty and I had to ask someone to clean it off. He half wiped it down with a gross rag and left most of the table dirty. Our waiter was REALLY rushing us along. He took forever to take the order for our meals and, RIGHT after ordering our food, he brought the check over. We hadn't even received our food and he already brought the check over which was unbelievably rude and bizarre.Then, the food came. We had ordered an assortment of tacos off the late-night menu. The food was absolutely inedible. They were dripping in grease and was disgusting. Incredibly disappointing. I will never come back here again.",,,

Nothing is special,,,but bartender was really friendly and price was average. This place is not the first bar choice I would pick in this area when I go out, but I will come here if other locations are packed and cannot get it.Guacamole:Descent amount of fresh Cilantro. It was good.Quesadilla:On the menu, it says ""Quesadilla"" but this is ""Empanada"". Taste was good and I would have it again! (My bartender was nice to give me a heads up this is more like Empanada, not Quesadilla when I ordered. I thought that is thoughtful :) )",,,

85,Nina L.,"New York, NY",541,717,153,3.0,7/9/2016,"There's no place on the Upper East Side I wanted to like more than the (fairly) new Daisy. Since their soft opening I've been eager to stop in. From the outside you can tell how much attention went into creating the brand for The Daisy, and the expertise in interior design that was used to curate their space. Unfortunately the food and alcohol could use a similar influence. My partner and I came here on a Friday night with another couple and we were disappointed in how lackluster our food and beverages were. For the price point (middle of the road cocktail bar costs), we were all expecting an elevated quality that just wasn't present. Of our drinks only 1 was enjoyable and it was a classic old-fashion. The food which was a fusion of Mexican and New American was just missing something overall (a-okay burger, overcooked duck fat fries, etc). The guacamole was definitely the best of what we ordered and that was amongst four entrees, an app, and two sides. While I love the inside vibe and the staff was friendly it's hard to justify returning if even the drinks were not notable. I hope they make some internal changes for the better because I'd love to find to love The Daisy.",3,1,2

The breakfast sandwich (tried a chorizo off my friend's plate and thought it was delicious) and fried chicken sandwich were quite decently sized though. Generally friendly service.",,,

We had to wave the server down several times, as we sat there with empty drinks in an empty restaurant. We ordered a burger, which was on the menu, but ""were not serving that"" was the response. Maybe tell us before hand if one of the few choices is not available? I also asked if we could do a dessert - as I specified on opentable that it was for a birthday & got such a rude response. ""Well do you have a cake? We don't have cake"" After I said any item will do she rolled her eyes & 10 minutes later came over & said they actually ""aren't doing dessert now"". It was just awful. Planning on emailing management so they are aware of the delinquency & lack of charm. Also the food mediocre, came out with large gaps in between & we were given a dish we didn't order.

The bartender was slow to deliver drinks and totally unfriendly.  Seems he was trying to still figure out the pricing on the menu -rather than help actual customers sitting there.  But the real issue began we we sat at a table inside, this spot (I refuse to call it a restaurant) had a few people inside and outside --not at all busy as I would think a restaurant would want to me any night of the week. Not only was no one around to seat us but I think a bus boy took our drink order and the waiter NEVER came to ask us about ordering food--we must have been there for at least 35 minutes.  Totally no excuse! I will also say I wouldn't have had any idea what to order since the menu is totally ridiculous, too long & should be totally re thought!  People want a fun vibe and good share-able food and great apps & entrees to pick on --not this fancy fare at this kind of venue. What a neighborhood disappointment!",,,

His annoyance was even more visible when ordering a bourbon later and we asked what kind they have. Bartender also ignored repeated requests for glasses of water, thankfully we caught the other bartenders attention.So long story short service = awful.

110,Quiana W.,"Jersey City, NJ",64,67,15,4.0,4/3/2016,Great alternative to Agave.. The sister restaurant. Agave tends to be over crowded and you can't get a seat. Every time I've been to the Daisy I've been sat in a timely fashion... Brunch is a favorite with the bottomless drinks. I enjoy the steak and eggs and the Guac is a favorite ...Charlie is always my waiter every time.. So attentive and pleasant. I had a bday gathering here once and he was the best waiter I've had! We had a great time with him.... My only tip for the Daisy bartender... Agave's bottomless margaritas are waaay better... Find out their tequila to lime ratio because the Daisy ones are too sour and Limey... Otherwise great restaurant! Especially for brunch !,,,

Next, the gnocchi and the tortellini. The beets and jalapeno add an incredible flavor to the gnocchi. The chicken in the tortellini is done to perfection and juicy. The cocktails were also worth the $13 price tag. I had the hearth and honey and the rye guy while my girlfriend enjoyed the spicy margarita. We ended up getting the s'mores campfire. It's pretty indescribable and worth a try if you have a sweet tooth.The service was great too. All the staff very friendly. We were extremely impressed and will be back!",1,,

Not sure if it was mixed in with the medley of mushed tortillas. The chicken was good but scarce.That aside, the brunch deal itself is good. I wish I got a different entree.

Decor is nice, and food seems to have potential based on the menu, but my ""quesadilla"" was a microwaved taco with a side of rice and a sunny side up egg. My friend's Cornish hen sandwich was pretty good, as well as the guacamole my other friend got. However, she only got the guacamole because the server couldn't figure out what else on the menu could be made vegetarian. My boyfriend got the risotto which he described as ""it feels like they said 'oh,shit, someone actually ordered this' and didn't have time to actually make it."" It's also 48deg F outside and the AC is on full blast above us. However, they were accommodating about it and turned it off. The automatic system turned it back on around the end of the meal.",1,1,1

I know this happens sometimes but typically the mistake is picked up straight away &  you get a sincere apology and probably compensated a drink or something - But none of that  here!!The conclusion- I would go back here just for drinks but eat somewhere else.,,,

119,Mark H.,"New York, NY",27,78,3,4.0,10/17/2015,"This addition to Yorkville's lineup of modern-menu casual dining options has a pretty relaxed vibe and a more serious feel than many of the other newcomers to the nabe. As the nondescript exterior suggests, The Daisy brings an understated presence to the 2nd Avenue party. The subtle, Spanish-influenced decor is accompanied by soft background music, dim lighting, and stylish appointments.The menu might be described as Mexican-influenced modern American, or maybe American-influenced modern Mexican? It is definitely sophisticated and interesting, with a nice mix of flavors in the entree and side dish choices. The pork belly dish we had was excellent, and the arroz con pato - grilled duck with a mango salsa - was not bad. Portions are on the small side, but the quality of the ingredients seems high.The drink menu was also interesting, with a decent selection of draught beers, some good wines, and a roster of quirky, signature cocktails.The service was polite and attentive, but for a restaurant that has only been open a few days, it might have been nice for the server to offer a little background on the menu, and maybe describe some of those unique cocktail concoctions.Overall, The Daisy is a worth a try for a quiet, quality meal. I'll be back to try the burger and maybe the fried game hen, along with one or two of those adult beverages.",2,,1

I finally find the opportunity to go this past Friday and I can tell you it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend and I spent our time trying as many different cocktails as we could, let me tell you, each one was better than the next. Although, weren't particularly hungry we ordered some small plates to nibble on. The guacamole was so yum and the barquillos were amazing! The duck mini wellingtons were okay. The duck itself was amazing, but the mostly raw dough kind of took away from it. This definitely a great happy hour spot.",,,

Ordered a mac n cheese side dish that was super cheesey with surprise pork chunks on the bottom. So good.

I was meeting a few friends of mine here on a Thursday and was there by myself for the first half hour or so. I was able to snag a seat at the bar next to who I think was a food or cocktail critic - the bartender was paying LOTS of attention to her. Anyway, the bartender that night couldn't have been better. He was paying attention to each person at the bar asking what their tastes were if they were stuck between a couple drinks. For starters, I had the vodka monaco. I'm not a vodka gal, but this was refreshing and delicious! I was worried about the raspberry taste being too sweet, but it was absolutely perfect - I tasted more cucumber than rasp which I love. My second drink was the risk taker which was mexcal-based. It was smokey and strong - definitely prefer my first drink. Really can't wait to go back. I think this place has a lot of potential!",2,2,3

138,Sarah D.,"New York, NY",159,37,0,4.0,7/22/2016,"We went to dinner last night here. It was great. We've gotten drinks there before, and knew that the margaritas were great. Goodness, I just love their classic margarita. We decided to get food and were not disappointed. The menu is small, so it's not ideal for picky eaters. But what they do have on their menu, they do well. My husband ate the Pork Belly, and he was completely in love. It had a delicious sweet potato purée and mixed with Brussel Sprouts. The dish was smaller than desired, but thankfully we got the papas bravas, which were equally delicious. My main course was the Brussel sprouts, and y'all know how hard it is to do them well. The Daisy does them very well. I highly recommend this place for creative small plate dining.",,,
139,Chelsea S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,13,0,2.0,5/5/2016,"Went here for cinco de mayo after seeing the advertised specials - free chips and guacamole and margarita deals. Unfortunately, service was so awful we had to leave. After an hour still never got any food. Plus, the drinks tasted water downed. Bar tenders were rude and it wasn't even that crowded. On top of that I think there was literally 1 server in the restaurant. The place is pretty empty and every other Mexican restaurant is packed to the brim so that just gives you an idea of how good this place is. Maybe they have great food on a normal day but the service and water downed drinks were so awful tonight that my friends and I will definitely never be back.",1,,
140,Marie A.,"New York, NY",48,116,15,2.0,3/9/2016,"I was looking forward to checking out this place after reading about it on Gothamist. We arrived and the place was quiet which was fine by us on a Tuesday. We asked the waiter what some of the components of one of their signature cocktails were and his response was ""ingredients"" - ok so we were going to be adventurous and order the drink anyway, we'd know what it was when we tasted it...that is if the drinks ever came. We waited the duration it took to make a (dried out/overcooked) salmon, it to be brought out and almost finished before the first / and obviously only round of drinks (3 total) got to the table. This place is going to need some serious help of its aim is to stay open. Do yourself a favor and head to Seamstress instead.",1,1,1
141,S M.,"Atlanta, GA",5,15,0,5.0,9/17/2016,This place is perfect for so many things. The cocktails are PHENOMENAL. They constantly rotate their cocktail list to keep it fresh and the drinks are well designed with something for everyone. The food is also wonderful and versatile. From small plates of about $10-$14 to larger mains. But my fav thing about The Daisy is its atmosphere.   You are literally transformed to the 20s and the attention to decorative detail and lighting is perfection. It's also great for large parties and there is a room in the back with its own bar and bartender for events.,,,
142,Christine C.,"Manhattan, NY",79,3,0,5.0,5/22/2017,"I just hosted a private party at The Daisy & it was fantastic! The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is perfect for every occasion & the service was unbelievable. They quickly set up the room when we showed up a 1/2 hour early, everyone complimented the food and the bartender was the best! I never YELP but was so impressed I felt the need to. I strongly recommend this place for your next event!",,,
143,Jen P.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/20/2016,"great place. The green eggs and ham burger was amazing!!! beet salad, tuna crudo excellent...The smores dessert was fantastic.  Definitely going back to try more.",,,
144,Em C.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",42,38,0,5.0,1/1/2017,Such an awesome addition to the UES. Fantastic new executive chef came in a few months ago and totally revitalized the place. Really inventive dishes. Very slick ambiance. Insane cocktails. I'll be going back and will post photos!,1,,
145,Bobbie J.,"Charlton, MA",0,11,0,4.0,12/30/2016,"First time at The Daisy last month with my husband, daughter and son in law.  Very cute inside, and very attentive waiters.  We tried the Broccoli & Cauliflower appetizer which was very good.  They brought us a fabulous soup shooter of butternut squash soup that was out of this world amazing!  For main course two from our group had the duck, and they loved it.  My husband had the short ribs.  He ate every bite and truly enjoyed it.  I had the Icelandic Cod, and it was superbly done.  I loved it, and I want to go back specifically for the cod.  For dessert we shared the smores campfire, which although beautifully done, didn't quite win us over.  We also shared an apple dessert (can't remember what it was called) and that was fabulous.  When my husband & I return to visit our daughter and son in law, we will definitely return to The Daisy.",1,,

148,Celine B.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/4/2016,"I absolutely adore this place. The Upper East Side needed a bit of the downtown dining scene, and the Agave spinoff definitely delivers. I will also say that while the drink menu is primarily cocktail-heavy, the wines by the glass are expertly curated and I ended up discovering one of the most exquisite reds under $20 in NYC -- the $12 Famiglia Bianchi 2012 Malbec. Perfectly complements many of the dishes on the menu. Great glassware as well. Will definitely be coming back on a regular basis.",1,1,

151,Ricky A.,"Carrollton, TX",72,63,32,3.0,11/5/2015,"After many months of anticipation for this space to be taken over by another restaurant , my wife and I decided to try out The Daisy last night. The decor is very nice and has a great setting for a casual yet romantic evening. The host was nice and the server was very attentive and helpful....unfortunate that is about all the good I can say. The cocktails were not very good, especially for the price. The ""scorcher"" cocktail which has a habanero syrup tasted watered down and with little tequila, and certainly no fire. I don't need my mouth to explode when consuming a cocktail, but at least a little heat would go well. The ""South of the Bourbon"" cocktail as well tasted water down and as though they had mixed little bourbon with apple cider...The dishes we had were the mini duck wellingtons, beef croquettes, octopus, and the Yardbird. Octopus was delicious  on a creamy avocado-like sauce however was about half the portion size of any Octo dish I've ever tried. The duck wellys had a good flavor though the meat was a bit tough at times. Beef Croquettes were basically ground beef rolled up, they tasted fine but I feel like we could have made them at home with hamburger-helperFinally, the Yardbird which was their take on ""Fried Cornish hen"" was a medium size chicken breast breaded in shake and bake..definitely not like fried chicken at all. Overall, the staff and ambience were great but unfortunately would not come back due to portion size and cocktail's lacking a great deal of flavor. I would say it was my fault for coming so early on in the operation, but having those culinary mishaps may not be a correction issue that will happen anytime soon.",2,,
152,Eff D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,23,2,1.0,4/30/2016,It took an hour from sitting to get our food. Server (redhead guy) disappeared for giant chunks of time. Margarita was massively watered down. Had to flag down the bus boys to get coffee refills. Will not be coming back.,,,
153,Kate E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,6,4.0,6/2/2016,"Bold and creative menu, beautifully crafted drinks, solid vibe, cool music. Immediately friendly bartenders and staff. Definitely a welcome addition to the Upper East Side particularly in an area packed with standard dive- and sports-bars. Nice to see a place take risks with a menu and not cater to an occasionally unimaginative crowd on the UES. Highly recommend a trip to The Daisy, especially Sunday brunch or a non-traditional night (M, T, W).",,,
154,Vick A.,"Richmond Hill, NY",3,5,0,1.0,5/28/2016,"Make me an improperly mixed cocktail and acknowledge that you fucked it up and still sent it out to me? Make it the same way again, and not even ask me if its right? Check please, here is your $0 tip! Bartender has a chip on his shoulder.",,,
155,Tim N.,"Manassas, VA",8,17,1,4.0,3/11/2016,Really interesting menu.  Weather was great last night - the restaurant had the patio area and front windows open.  Located on the corner - an interest UES corner wraps around you.  Great service.  Duck fat truffle fries were even better than they sound.  Comfortable place - comfortable atmosphere.  The menu will be worth a second visit.,,,
156,Karen B.,"Kernersville, NC",0,5,2,5.0,12/18/2015,"Excellent service, great location & atmosphere. The drinks were awesome.

157,Christina R.,"Manhattan, NY",158,13,3,5.0,5/12/2016,The Daisy and Joel were fabulous tonight. The staff was very accommodating. Joel chatted it up regarding favorite tequilas and knows how to make killer drinks!,,,
158,Alexa P.,"New York, NY",463,100,142,4.0,10/23/2016,"The food was a 3, the service was a 4.5, and the drinks were a 5. Came here on a gloriously beautiful but chilly afternoon with a friend and wanted to sit outside but no tables were set up. The management graciously set up tables just for us and seated us immediately. We started with the boozy brunch ($30 a person) and went for the bloody marys. The drinks were WAY salty and I found I couldn't finish mine. We moved onto the mimosas which was a good choice because they were nicely balanced and not too sweet (read: lots of champagne). I ordered the huevos rancheros and my friend had the gravalax benedict. The huevos were strange as they came on a HUGE bun and not a tortilla like it said on the menu or like most huevos. My egg was cooked through and I didn't get the runny experience I had hoped for even though I asked for the egg poached. The chorizo, guac, and beans were all yummy. My friend enjoyed her dish although the salmon was purple? but the best thing on her plate was definitely the fingerling potatoes. The staff were very friendly and kind and kept our glasses full. When our bill came we were surprised to see an extra charge for the benedict and I wish that our waiter had told us about it when we ordered (thus the 4.5 and not 5 star rating for service). Overall this place would be good for a group who wanted to drink and have a good time, but don't expect the food to be superb.",1,,
159,Ramina H.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,32,0,5.0,11/16/2015,"The place before (which I admit I've never been to but unfortunately passed by many times) was disgusting.  The Daisy is an awesome improvement and you can't even tell what it was before.  We went on a Saturday early evening and got great service and food.  I don't remember 100% what I had but remember the octopus and shishito peppers were so good.  The ""up in the sky"" (I think) was some delicious concoction, my boyfriend had an old fashioned that was well-made as well.  Our server for the night, Kevin I think, was so incredibly nice and attentive.  More low-key and intimate than Bondurants across the street.  We'll be frequenting this place lot more in the future!",,,1
160,Matt D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,2/10/2017,Finally an amazing go-to in the upper east! Went there a few nights ago for happy hour and couldn't have been more impressed. $3 tacos and they were the tastiest I've had in a long time. Also decently sized. Our bartender was great and the drinks were superb. I can't wait to go back!,,,
161,Kate W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0,4.0,2/9/2017,"I really like the Daisy. Cute ambiance and the menu is full of intriguing (and delicious) flavor combinations--hats off to the chef who comes up with it! Portions are definitely on the small side, and the cocktail menu is hit-or-miss, but overall a really nice place. And the postcards that come with the bill have quotes from the Great Gatsby on them for all of us nerds.",,,
162,Andrew A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,10,1,5.0,2/8/2016,"I came here with some friends the other night and it was amazing to say the least. Between a great crowd, phenomenal cocktails and amazing food, we will certainly be back regularly. It started with great service from the hostess who sat us quickly and recommended the beef croquettes and duck wellington. Both were amazing! She also recommended the ""Daisy"" cocktail which was both delicious and beautiful. Coming from someone who has lived in the neighborhood for years, I can say definitively that this is exactly what the UES needed.",,,
163,Paul D.,"Astoria, NY",1,26,0,2.0,5/10/2016,Had dinner here last night. The decor and server were the best parts. The food was bland and over priced even for the UES. Duck Fat Truffle fries were flavorless. The MAc kinda watery.,,,

165,Cathleen T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,0,2.0,11/25/2015,"Nice atmosphere, overpriced cocktails, sloooow service. Stopped in on a Wednesday for drinks at the bar. The new owners did a nice renovation of Molly's & the bar was about half full with a nice vibe. That said, it took about 15 minutes to get a (very good) cocktail in a not-busy bar... and so long to get a second round that we just left. The drinks were almost double the price of the neighborhood- for a space that reminds me of beer-swilling Molly's, that just won't fly.",,,
166,M W.,"Manhattan, NY",176,15,2,4.0,1/1/2016,Great spot for drinks on the UES. Love the ambiance and atmosphere. The food was great as well. I had a great conversation with my bartender Dominic. Stop by and check it out you won't be disappointed.,,,

168,Chucky T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,37,16,2.0,3/13/2016,"This is a nice-looking place. Can't speak for the food, but the ambience was good. A bit loud for an intimate date though (was Sat night). However, if you're a beer fan this may not be the place for you.  We had a two different beers (IPA, wheat beers) and they were a little on the flat side (not very cold, lacking carbonation). Maybe it would be better a different night. However, the draft beers were $8 and $9 and were not even regular pints (16oz) but rather 12oz, or 14oz.  I hate when bars chisel away at the customers like that.  If you have money to burn, then you won't care.",,,
169,Gretchen K.,"Savannah, GA",1,2,0,5.0,12/19/2016,"Amazing food, amazing drinks. The duck is on point.

174,Jack D.,"Huntington, NY",0,4,0,2.0,5/21/2017,"WE arrived at the Daisy and waited for someone to seat us approx 15 minutes . (I made my open table reservation as I was waiting)The hostess came over and asked if we had a reservation, we said yes, she then said oh you just made it. We asked to sit outside she said she had no tables , there were 2 tables outside available, she said the open table reserves the table for you so she didn't realize it . We sat down outside to a table that was not even, so when they served the water the drinks slide to the end , lucky we caught them. We asked 4 different people to fix the table they said we are working on it. We finally put a napkin under the foot of the table.  WE ordered  our food waited approx 40 minutes , 2 of us got our meals , we reminded them we had a 3rd meal she said  oh yes sorry and a few minutes later it came out but was not correct, at that time the hostess came over asked how everything was and we said please give us our check don't bring out the other plate we were done. She was very nice and must have realized all the problems before and said no charge for everything. She then brought the 3 rd persons meal out and it was correct. SO how was the food , the food was good . Not sure if I would try again it might have been a very off day.",,,
175,Sandy M.,"New York, NY",169,12,2,2.0,11/29/2015,Good food but pricey $23 for a fish smaller then an appetizer. Go for the drinks but don't go for dinner.,,,
176,Constance P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,5/3/2017,"This was a difficult review to write. We went for dinner last night and were seated promptly. The place was empty. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was wonderful, exceptional. However, ( you probably saw the ""however"" coming) after 45 minutes our food had not arrived. The very attentive server had been stopping by, refilling out water glasses and assuring us the food was on the way. At about the 45 minute mark, I asked if we could get some bread for the table while we were waiting. I was vey politely told that the restaurant does not provide for any ""table dishes"", but they did have house made chips we could buy. Thankfully, our food showed up at that very moment. So, if your restaurant is empty and you are going to make customers wait 45 minutes for a meal AND they ask you for something, anything to eat while waiting, the gracious (and smart) thing to do is give them something to eat. The food and service were great, but I thought the ""yep, we're taking forever, yep, you're hungry, hey, BUY some chips"" was pretty petty and not well done of them.",,,
177,Cheryl L.,"New Hyde Park, NY",31,31,3,4.0,7/16/2016,"Ok so I know this place only got 3.5 stars and I was skeptical to try it because of that but I'm glad I did. We had the guac and it was good except I wish my fiancée had ordered it a little spicy but it was yummy nonetheless. The main course options are limited but they have a new executive chef who's changing their menu so I believe by July 18th, the full menu will be available. I had their burger and it was yum! It came with crunchy French fries with some kinda garnish that I can't see in the dark lol but it's so good! Overall, I'd say I had a pleasant experience in terms of food. Service, however, is ok. The waitress only came at the end to ask how we liked everything and if we needed anything else, but it would've been nice if she came earlier to ask. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Besides that, it's a pretty nice spot to have dinner.",,,
178,Frank A.,"Manhattan, NY",7,8,0,5.0,6/1/2016,Will definitely go back to this one. I went for brunch and got the huevos rancheros and they were Delicious. Did not take advantage of the bottomless deal but it is one of the better ones on the upper east side.,,,

182,Julie O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,1.0,5/19/2016,"I met a friend here early evening on New Year's Eve. The two bartenders seemed annoyed that they had to tend to us instead of chatting and laughing with each other.  I vowed never to return, but recently another friend of mine suggested we meet here, as she had never been, so I decided to give the place a second chance.   Wouldn't you know.. one of the bartenders from New Year's Eve was working, well not really working, I should say he was present, and he clearly was disappointed when a few people walked in a sat down at the bar.  He seemed content talking with other staff at the far end of the bar, which is where we ended up walking to  when we wanted to order another round.   We ended up taking our drinks and sitting in the window away from the bar. We figured if we were going to be ignored and have to go to him anyways, we might as well sit and enjoy people-watching.  We again had to go to the far end of the bar to ask him for water, then again to ask for the check. Unbelievable!!!  It's a shame, because I remember the irish bar that used to be in this place before it was Daisy.  It was a dive bar, but I remember the irish bartender always welcomed you with a big smile and made you feel so welcomed.  Well, I miss that bartender, and that bar.   I will not be returning to Daisy, and this place will not last long with service like that.",,,

189,Annie C.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,5/6/2016,"I honestly never write reviews, but this place was so undeniably terrible that I felt the need to. When I went yesterday (it was Cinco de Mayo), the bar was crowded, but not packed, and most tables were full. It wasn't chaos or too many people. Just a crowded evening. Very common in New York. We sat down at 7:30, waited 15 minutes to place our drink order, and then 20 more minutes for our incorrect drink order to show up, where we were also informed they were out of lime juice, so the margarita was made with orange juice. Gross. We ordered guac and chips, the fried yardbird, and a burger. After half an hour, our waiter reappeared and while he was walking by the table told us in an annoyed tone they were OUT OF GUAC. No apologies, didn't ask us if we wanted anything else, and didn't stop to take our drink order again. We waited OVER AN HOUR for our food, which arrived cold, and even if it was hot would not have been tasty. The fried chicken was lackluster, and the burger was just ok. Our waiter was nowhere to be found and we were so starving we just ate it. We had to ask for the check three times, and finally it arrived, wrong, of course. The entire experience was honestly inexcusable. Busy night or not, I'd never go back here.",,,
