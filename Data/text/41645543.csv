1,Heidi M.,"Bellevue, WA",151,671,2443,4.0,11/9/2018,"We were guest of the Sanctuary hotel (which I highly recommend), so we did checkout the rooftop bar Haven.  We stopped in after our Book of Mormon show and the bartender made some kickass gin and tonics for us.  Fun place to hangout with cool vibes and friendly staff.",1,1,1
2,Sean C.,"Kissimmee, FL",265,91,212,3.0,11/3/2018,"The Haven rooftop was a nice spot for a quick bite and a drink before checking out some more of the offerings in NYC.  The place is definitely easy to find, serves up really friendly staff, and offers a great 15% yelp discount!The drinks and atmosphere were great - be sure to check out the bar area during happy hour for some specials.  We were a bit late for happy hour, but the bar was still pretty packed with people sipping on drinks enjoying the DJ.  We enjoyed a few of the specialty martinis, which were each made perfectly. The reason for the 3 stars is the mediocre food.  I expected more with the pricing and the other local restaurants.  But, our tacos and flatbread both fell short. They were fine - but, didn't really offer anything special.  The taste and presentation was more like a chain restaurant than this chic establishment. In the future, I would stick with drinks and chatting with friends and stay away from the food.",1,,
3,Nisha C.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",430,230,152,3.0,7/3/2018,"Haven was more of a restaurant rooftop than an actual rooftop bar. I came on a Friday during happy hour, originally only for HH drinks but it was extremely hot and we were hungry so we asked for a table and they sat us literally 1 foot away from the bar area. Happy hour specials were $6 beer, $8 wine and $10 margaritas. If I had known HH prices were not included if you asked for a table to sit at, then I would not have gotten a table. The regular margarita on our bill was regular price ($16 - so NOT worth it). The frose that I ordered was $16 as well. We also ordered truffle fries ($8) which were tasty no lie but the ketchup tasted like it came straight out of the oven, weird I know but it's true, and we ordered guacamole and chips (I think it was $12) - also not worth it because the chips tasted like they opened a bag of tostitos and laid it on the plate (except tostitos taste WAY better than these chips). All in all, it's a cute and small rooftop, but I won't be back because of these overly priced items.Also Yelp Check in for this win - 15% off your 1st bill.",4,1,
4,Melissa P.,"Mountain Top, PA",212,51,88,4.0,9/22/2018,"The location of haven is very confusing because there is ONE sign outside but doesn't tell you where to enter or what door to enter through to get to haven. You have to go through Sanctuary Hotel. We got in and we're very confused because there were no signs inside about haven or where to go. We saw people lined up and waiting so we got in line. There is ONE elevator to send everyone up. We had an 11:30 reservation and took 15 min to get up to the rooftop. Because we weren't sure what exactly to do, we asked the hotel staff at the front desk. The man working the front desk was rude when I asked how to get to haven & if that line was for haven. The elevator was CRAMMED PACKED and we were squished all together with ice buckets in the elevator. Other than getting to Haven, our experience was great. The atmosphere was amazing, our waitress was amazing, and the food was amazing. Our food came out so fast and tasted delicious. 4 out of 5 stars for rude desk man, long wait, confusion on entrance and crammed elevator.",1,,
5,Nimita P.,"New York, NY",10,65,40,4.0,9/21/2018,"My friend was in town from Los Angeles so I decided to grab some drinks with her at Haven! It's right across my office building and they have a great happy hour. $8 wines and $10 margs from 5-7pm which is pretty hard to find around the Time Square area on a somewhat rooftop bar. The views aren't anything great but if you have the right company, you'll be sure to have a good time! P.S. there are a lot of nats flying around so be sure to check your drinks before taking a sip! My wine had a nat floating around in it, I asked the waitress to replace it and she was so sweet about it.",,,
6,Ashly B.,"New York, NY",935,93,193,4.0,4/28/2018,"-First Impression- Very pretty! Kind of felt like having a tea party in a garden-Food- So good! We came in towards the end of brunch so we ordered a little bit of everything. -Service- Josh was super polite, helpful and accommodating on the main floor. Once seated, we were able to order right away. Axel was not our server, but my goodness, was he amazing! He took care of everything we needed, answered all our questions, he was funny, and so nice! He invited us to come back the next day, haha! Our actual server was nice too, I guess, but she was not as present  and didn't seem to really want to be there (I actually saw her and two other staffers sitting at the table behind us on their phones). -Price- Average NYC brunch prices. $20 bottomless mimosas for an hour-Did Not Like- Towards the end of our meal, someone on the other side of the venue was serenaded by the staff, complete with sparklers and birthday wishes. My friend asked one of the servers who happened to be walking by why I didn't get that kind of birthday wish, we were told ""you have to tell your waitress"", which we did (she did say ""have a blessed birthday"", but I wanted the damn sparklers!). Also, it got pretty hot in there with the sun beaming down through the windows, even with the AC (allegedly) on.-Noteworthy- I will be back for those truffle fries!-Recommended?- Yes!",25,10,19
7,Aisha N.,"Dix Hills, NY",0,71,31,5.0,9/25/2018,"Great food, music, and atmosphere.We ordered the truffle fries, havenly chicken, and margarita pizza and it all taste good. The only problem is that the rooftop is located near time square so parking is very hard to find.",,,
8,Charles B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,223,42,3.0,8/26/2018,"Underwhelming. My girlfriend wanted to come here after seeing a promo video of theirs. The video was done very well and made the expectation far exceed the reality of the place. There is practically no view of anything other than neighboring buildings, but yes you're on a nicely designed midtown rooftop (10 stories up). The decor is nice, but you'll want to be seated in the larger seating area where the tent-style ceiling is higher and the ""room"" is brighter/airier.The food was OK. My eggs Benedict had the right flavors, textures, etc. and was good for the routine brunch fare that it was. My girlfriend had the lobster salad and the lobster portion was very small and rubbery, but the presentation of it was quite nice and the flavor not bad despite the texture.Service was very polite from the host to the waiter. We decided to do the one hour of bottomless mimosas, but unfortunately found the bottom after 40 minutes. I think it had to do with seatings for brunch having ended, but nevertheless it was frustrating and disappointing and further contributed to the underwhelming nature of the experience.Too many other options exist in NYC for fun, delicious brunches at the same price point to warrant my returning here.",1,,

10,Meghan R.,"Bellmore, NY",47,220,430,3.0,8/13/2018,Came here after dinner around 7pm on a Sunday. The rooftop was busy. We were able to get a table and ordered some drinks. Just like any NYC Rooftop their prices are roughly $12-$16. View is ok and music was eh. But our waitress Sheila was quick and friendly. Guac and chips were perfect to snack on too!,1,,
11,Jane L.,"Berkeley, CA",340,86,136,3.0,7/28/2018,"Hmmm I went here Saturday morning, and it was a decent brunch place. The food was okay, nothing special about them, same with sangria that I got, and the view was nothing in particular. Since I wanted to visit a rooftop in NY at least once, it was worth the try, but if you are in the area and want some sort of special experience, I wouldn't recommend this spot.",1,1,1
12,Jessica G.,"Larchmont, NY",70,127,367,4.0,7/13/2018,"Haven is a casual rooftop bar set in Midtown Manhattan, with nicely priced drinks, great service, and tasty food. A bucket of 10 beers will run you $70 and the appetizers/small plates are between $13 and $20. I came here after work for a happy hour with a group of colleagues. Unfortunately, 3/4 of the bar were reserved for a party and we had a tight space, however the staff was super accommodating and brought us over a high top and made sure we had drinks and food promptly (we couldn't order from the bar cause of the private party). We were taken care of and I'll definitely be back. The tuna tartar was really good and the guacamole was definitely homemade. I am giving four stars, because the views aren't spectacular right now as there's about three construction sites surrounding this bar, so in terms of views, this bar gets a lower rating.",1,,
13,Allison B.,"Westwood, NJ",387,220,452,4.0,12/28/2017,"My husband and I were looking - two days out - for reservations somewhere decorated, for a staycation in the City. Believe it or not, close to Christmas, getting a reservation was NOT easy - I know, shocking.The Yelp rating of Haven would have kept me away, but these were desperate times, and a girl needed to eat surrounded by holiday directions, since I was feeling a little Grinch-y. We made a 6:30 reservation for Haven, and braved Times Square to head to the Sanctuary Hotel to begin our evening. The Sanctuary Hotel is exactly that - a complete breath of fresh air in a very touristy area. We were greeted by a helpful doorman and ushered to an area to wait (by a fireplace) for the elevator to take us up to Haven Rooftop. I'd recommend getting to Haven a bit early, because regardless of a reservation, you still have to wait on line to use the elevator to head on up (also, the elevator is a TIGHT fit).We made our way up to the rooftop, which was decorated top to bottom. Reindeer antler chandeliers, strings of lights, and branches/trees were everywhere (though it wasn't cheesy - super tasteful, but put you right in the holiday spirit). We were brought to our table immediately and were greeted by our server Angel, who was just as attentive starting out as he would be when the crowd size increased. Again, the low Yelp scores made me think that service would be lacking, but Angel was incredible, as were all those who filled water glasses, brought and took food/plates away, etc. We started off with drinks - a glass of Cab Sauv for me, and one of the seasonal winter drinks for my husband, a hot toddy inspired cocktail. From there, we ordered an appetizer to split, at Angel's recommendation - the tuna tartare wontons, which were as good as he had described once they came out (plus, raw tuna plus a wonton shell is the best combination ever).For entrees, I ordered the mushroom risotto, which I am usually picky about, but Angel hadn't steered us wrong so far, so I took his high praise of this being one of their best entree choices and went for it. My husband ordered the fish tacos, that is meant to be an appetizer, as well as the white pizza flatbread (mozz, goat cheese, truffle oil). The portions were perfect and the food was delicious. The risotto was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were amazing and the ideal amount, the fish tacos were delicious, and the flatbread pizza was the perfect size for me to steal a piece and for my husband to not be hungry. We were full, but not grossly so where we wanted to be rolled out, which is the perfect combination. We ordered another round of drinks before getting the check. Thanks to a Yelp check-in, we scored a percentage off our final bill, which was an added bonus to a great meal and excellent service. (PS. If you use the % off Yelp benefit, please don't be an asshole - tip on the amount before the discount!). I was pleasantly surprised with Haven's ambiance, amazing service, and delicious food. We'll definitely be back in the summer, which is saving a lot, since we usually avoid the Times Square area at all costs. Thanks for a great evening out, Haven!",6,,
14,Amelia S.,"Westchester County, NY",3,18,0,2.0,9/7/2018,"This place is not worth writing home about. Yeah, they have the title ""rooftop"" so some may envision a classy setting with a nice view and sophisticated cocktails and apps. This place was everything but.The ambiance of the place was extremely tacky. More could have been done to jazz the space up.  To pay 15 dollars for a cocktail- I'd prefer if there was more than one ice cube in the drink. I was planning on drinking more than one, but my friends and I did not feel like it good enough to spend another 15 bucks on a second round. We ended up heading elsewhere after one round. The DJ played very basic music. I felt as if I was at a sweet 16 hearing the latest, most overplayed hits.",1,,

We still were not allowed to come in and enjoy the meal and sights. Expected better as I hear from other friends that they dont have a limit and have went there with their entire family.The day was not lost because we walked over to Rockefeller Center and found a lovely bar & grille to enjoy with EVERYONE in our family being allowed to eat.The atmosphere when walking in is very dark.

16,Kim K.,"Kings Park, NY",36,84,133,4.0,9/9/2018,"Great time! Found this place on Yelp when I wanted a roof top patio. Made a reservation and was alittle scared when they called to confirm and remind me it was business casual. Me and my friend did dress nice and when we arrived most people were but it wasn't an intimidating atmosphere at all. We got seater with away and had a great little nook with great views. The menu is decently priced. My one complaint is the menu isn't that great, that's just my opinion. We ended up splitting a pizza and a Greek platter. Both delicious. Our waiter was delightful and very attentive. We ended up getting free drinks cause the bus boy spilled taziki sauce on my friend. The drinks made up for it! We took some pictures on the third floor after we ate. I do think the weather (rainy and chilly) made it almost  better because it was less packed and we were able to take our time and had good service. I imagine it can get packed!  LOVED it here and will be back!!!",,,

Be there around 4:30-5PM ish for best spot. 3) The Hevenly Chicken/ Tuna Tar tar are YESS!!!!!! 4) they have a hidden garden floor once you head up - check that out (you have to walk that down from roof ) Cons Could use a better selection for Scotch Whiski.

The bar area has couches and benches that are adorned with fur throws and patterned pillows. While sitting on a couch, there is no service. We had to go up to the bar for each round of cocktails and waters. Also, there's only one unisex bathroom stall, which seems odd for an establishment of this size.

Good atmosphere in my mid twenties last time I was there and at 30 this time around. Fun atmosphere for both young and old and young at heart.

It got really busy around 5:30 and the music volume suddenly escalated to a crazy level of loud which doesn't bother me if the music is good. It was crappy pop style dance music which was near deafening. There was also a bizzare occurrence of waves of a ""propane-like"" oder that came in regularly over the patio.

A great happy hour, summer cocktails or fall toddys spot.Our server's name was Angel,  I'm not making that up.  He was wonderful.  A good server know a restaurant's offerings, assesses your tastes and makes suggestions based on that knowledge.  Angel did all of that.We had several rounds of drinks.  We started out with the basics, vodka and soda but progressed at Angel's suggestion to a round of Mules.  The mules were excellent.  We Al's has the lobster role which was more roll that lobster but still pretty good.  The real highlight was the ahi tuna which was excellent as were the fries.One very negative note is the is only one unisex bathroom for the entire bar and restuarant. By the end of the evening the facilities were in need of attention. We notified the hostesses but that didnt seem to do much.  The lack of cleanliness but a damper on an otherwise excellent evening.Great location, good food and service.  It's a trendy midtown Manhattan spot, great for out of town visitors who will love the view.  I  will return again soon.",,,

It was the first warm weekend of the year so as expected, reservations were filling up pretty quickly. The hotel itself is dimly lit and aims for an opulent, glamourous vibe inside. We 'checked in' will the man at the elevators - he was so friendly - who stored my friend's bag and hat in the luggage room (only purses allowed). Upstairs, the environment is very different. It is bright and airy and filled with young people sipping mimosas and brunching (alllll the stereotypes apply here). The décor leans towards the cheesy side - clearly plastic greenery and branches along the tent - with tables packed very, very closely together. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive, which is always a plus. The menu has your standard brunch fare at expected brunch prices for midtown ($20-30). Unfortunately, the food was pretty disappointing. My friend's Steak and Eggs was cooked properly (rare), but there were only about 5 small slices of steak with bland sauce and eggs. My Huevos Rancheros was soggy and tasted like they forgot all seasoning. Nevertheless, the bottomless coffee was much appreciated.

Based on other reviews I thought I was going to have a bad experience but was pleasantly surprised.Upon arrival, we were escorted to the bar because our table was not ready yet. The decor in the bar had a cute aesthetic, and although it was sunny and warm they had a fan to cool the room down. We actually ended up staying in the bar because people were camping at their tabes, and we could not be sat on the dining side. We were a bit disappointed but Monica the manager really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience despite the table situation. Based on other reviews, I thought the food was going to be subpar, but I really enjoyed the French Toast I ordered for brunch. I also enjoyed the $20 bottomless cocktails. Such a steal considering the location, and view from the rooftop. Angela ( Or Angelina, sorry I forgot) was a really nice, and fun server too.Thanks to Monica, I will for sure be back whenever I'm in New York.",1,,3
40,Jacqueline M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,8/27/2018,"I would love to review Haven Rooftop based on things like the food and atmosphere, but unfortunately I actually did not get to eat there, despite having made and confirmed my reservation more than a week in advance.  I made a reservation (for two), which was confirmed immediately by the restaurant staff. I was excited to take my partner out to dinner because he lives across the country and we only really get to see each other once a month. HOWEVER, when we got to Santcuary/Haven, we were greeted immediately by a long line to get into the elevator, and a grumbling staff who scream-asked me if I had made a reservation/if I was old enough to drink several times. I assured him I did, and that I am (I'm 25), but he was still skeptical even after inspecting my ID VERY THOROUGHLY in front of a line of people. After I was sufficiently humuliatied, we got to the rooftop restaurant where I checked in with the hostess. She said our table wasn't ready yet because of a private function also happening on the roof. She assured me it would be a 5 to 10 minute wait and that she would call me once my table was ready. She encouraged us to go to the bar downstairs while we waited. So we did. And this on its own is not a big deal, however, the hostess never called us, and after nearly an hour of waiting, we found out our reservation had been dropped because of the private event. No one ever contacted me to resolve the issue, or to even reschedule my reservation. So yes, I would love to review Haven Rooftop on more than the shit stain of an experience I had, but sadly, all I can base it on is the rude staff, the dismissive hostesses, the finance bro patrons, and the expensive as shit beer that tasted like piss. I don't know what I expected from a rooftop bar in midtown though, so maybe I'm just dumb for thinking this would even be a good idea in the first place.",1,,

When I entered there were two bouncers at the entrance of the hotel. I asked if it was open & they welcomed me right in. Took the elevator up and entered the bar. It was such a cool rooftop. Warm & cozy. The couches looked so inviting. & the music was loud but not overbearing. And the view was fantastic!!!! Mya was my server and she was really friendly, polite and attentive. She knew the menu well and suggested the most favorite drinks since I usually ask which ones they are. & the hostess was really nice too! The whole staff was great!I'd definitely recommend!",,,

They do have a happy hour until 6. Margaritas are 10 bucks at that time. Other than that cocktails are roughly $14 which is pretty pricey for a drink in my opininon. I ate and had a Maui sandwhich which was just okay it wasn't  worth the $24. This place is super expensive. They do have a 15% check in offer forna first time visit.,2,2,1

Updated review","I loved this place! We came as a group to watch the World Cup and its was the cutest place ever!! The seats were comfortable, and the food was really good too! I got the pizza and it was pretty good. We also got a pitcher of sangria, which was watered down and didn't have that much alcohol in it. The experience was great, we had a lot of fun! And we were sad that Brazil lost to Belgium",1,,
54,Katie E.,"Manhattan, NY",123,18,1,2.0,7/31/2018,"In the 7 years that I've lived in Manhattan I've visited most of the major rooftop bars. A friend suggested HH drinks at Haven and although it's located in the heart of TS I figured I would give it a shot. After a short visit I can tell you this place is definitely not worth your time. Go to one of the million other rooftops nearby (Refinery, Viceroy Hotel Rooftop, Monarch Hotel, etc.) The management here has no idea what they are doing with their table situation, drinks are mediocre at best and service is slow. The only thing they have going for them is the wait staff is actually nice and they do have a HH but it ends at 6.",,,
55,Charlotte B.,"New York, NY",1,28,6,3.0,8/21/2018,Even with reservations our party of 3 was placed on lower level rooftop .. down a flight of stairs without any view. Yikes. Also this area closed early and put a damper on a special night. Will not go again.,,,
56,Sandy F.,"Remsen Village, Brooklyn, NY",55,18,25,3.0,4/16/2018,"My friend found this bar so we decided to try it out. It opens at 4pm and I got there around 5pm and it was already packed. There are 2 outdoor areas and we went to the other area since it wasn't as crowded. The hostess offered us a communal table and another party of 6 did eventually join the table...which was fine. The waitress did take a bit long to get our drinks but the hostess noticed that and came over to apologize. The music was good and the atmosphere was welcoming.  Nice ambiance and the crowd was great. Food was delicious. Side note- if you want the ""happy hour"" drinks you have to sit at the bar. Also...if you check in on Yelp you will get a 15% discount on your 1st visit. Overall...we had a great time. I'd definitely go back...nice after work spot.",,,

Haven Rooftop is the only one I chose to write about.Went to Haven Rooftop for brunch before heading home from a theater trip in NYC.  I highly recommend this spot for brunch.  The atmosphere is fun and fantastic.  We were a little thrown off by the hotel lobby because we thought this was going to be a stuffy place with weird food.  Boy, were we wrong.  The rooftop dining area is fun and full of light.  They offer a bottomless mimosa, bloody or sangria.  Our table had all three options, but most agreed the sangria was best.  Can't beat it for $20!The brunch menu was also fun and interesting.  Not too overwhelming, but just enough selections to please everyone in the group.  I absolutely loved the truffle fries.The service staff was very attentive, filled drinks often and food came out quick.  We didn't feel rushed though as you sometimes do in popular brunch spots.We will definitely be back to check out their dinner menu on our next trip to the city!",,,
59,David N.,"Alpharetta, GA",9,56,2,3.0,7/12/2018,"We stopped in during our recent visit to NYC because we wanted to try a rooftop bar. We were queued up in the lobby area until we could get an elevator to the roof. The staff was pleasant and had us check our packages, hats, etc before we went up. This is also a hotel so there was a separate elevator for hotel guests. The bar itself wasn't that large, there were tables alongside one area, then the actual bar area had about 10 barstools, some pub tables and then some couch type seating areas alongside the walls. Service was decent for the amount of people that were there. The drinks were ok, but very expensive as you might imagine for a Manhattan bar. The views unfortunately weren't as good as we were hoping for, and they had netting up that obscured what views they do have which was odd. All in all it was ok, but doubtful we'd go back.",,,

64,Isaac L.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,9,0,2.0,9/30/2018,"We were in NYC for the weekend and wanted to end the trip with a nice restaurant that had a good view. The reviews for this place weren't great but figured the positives outweighed the negatives. Getting up to the restaurant in the tiny cramped elevator was fine but as soon as we stepped out, we knew this wasn't the high end restaurant that was advertised. The music that was blaring was all the music you would hear at a middle school dance in the early 2000s. I audibly groaned when Ice Ice Baby came on and I kid you not, part of the staff and patrons took part in the Electric Slide. The staff were friendly enough but not attentive. We ordered truffle fries and they reminded me of McDonald's which isn't a bad thing but they were 12$ so wasn't a good thing either. The sesame crusted tuna was actually pretty good but my boyfriend got the penne with chicken and it tasted like it was made by a college student on a budget. The place itself was cute and the views were nice, but the music and ambience were completely off from what was expected.

There only deals are on wine and beer till 7pm... ordered four cocktails and total was $52 (excluding tip).Place is tiny and seating is limited so don't go with a big group. Not much view for a 'rooftop' bar. The only view you'll get is the residential/commercial building surrounding this hotel. So if you're looking for the scenic view, this place isn't for you. Hotel lobby itself is extremely nice and workers were friendly. It's not too bad if you work around the area and want to grab a quick drink before dinner",3,,1

75,Stephanie D.,"Jersey City, NJ",38,16,0,4.0,6/27/2018,"I came to Haven Rooftop for brunch as the end of a bachelorette celebration. For parties larger than 6, you must call the restaurant directly and place a $150 deposit that will then go towards the check at the end of the meal. We reserved a table for 10. I thought the deposit was a bit unusual, I haven't had to do that for many restaurants. The restaurant is at the top of a very nice hotel. We were also checking out of our hotel so we had a lot of bags with us, and the hotel downstairs offered to store it while we had our brunch. This worked out so well for us as we thought we would have to carry our bags at the top, but having the hotel hold our bags was very convenient. The restaurant is very nicely decorated with drapery and greenery. Our table(s) were individual tables that were connecting, so it was rather small, our elbows were touching. We asked the waitress if we can pull another table to make more room, and they were able to accommodate us. The waitress was very accommodating and friendly. For drinks I ordered the Star Sangria, which was very light and refreshing, I enjoyed it. I ordered the Havenly chicken with a side of truffle fries. The food was presented very nicely, they sliced the chicken very thin and the beurre blanc sauce complimented the chicken very well. The chicken appeared to be a blackened chicken, so it was a tad bit on the salty side. The majority of the other girls ordered steak and eggs. I had a bite of the steak and I thought it could use some more flavor. The bride ordered a lobster roll, and unfortunately she wasn't pleased with it (her exact words were it was ""eh"") If it were not for the food, I would give this place 5 stars. The food was definitely good, but it could be better. The rooftop is great for either a romantic date or a girls day.",,,
76,A T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,5,0,2.0,5/17/2018,"Before I go into depth with my review, the happy hour is horrible. Corporate America gets out of work at 5, but the happy hour here ends at 6. Most people wouldn't even get to the place at 6, so there's really no point of the way they do their happy hour . I got there at 5:50 so I can't attest to the happy hour prices as I didn't get the happy hour menu. I have been to many rooftops in NYC and I have never been told that I have to stand at the bar and eat my appetizers , that is, until I went to Haven Rooftop. I visited Haven with three friends and the hostess asked us if we wanted to do drinks or food. My friends and I answered that we'd probably order some appetizers and get drinks, the hostess said follow me. The hostess then stopped at a stair well and pointed to an area below-- I guess it was a bar area.I said I'm sorry, I'm confused, are you sitting us? She replied, no, tables are only for ""fine dining"" and that appetizers did not constitute fine dining. My friends and I reiterated but we want to sit because we want to order a bunch of appetizers and don't want to eat it standing. She again affirmed that the dining was only for parties who planned on ordering an entree. I was very turned off and wanted to leave but my friends said fine, we'll order an entree each. When we sat down, the waitress came up to us right away and asked us what we would like to drink. We informed her that we were waiting for one more member and that we didn't want to order without her because we might do a pitcher instead of separate drinks. The fourth party arrived and as soon as she sat down, the waitress came over and asked us for drinks again. We told her that we still haven't decided because the last person just sat down-- which she saw. She walked away for about 3 minutes and came back, we all felt very pressured to order. We ordered a bottle and told her we would look at the menu for food.As soon as she brought us the drinks, she attempted to take our food order. This was our first time at Haven and we didn't really get a chance to look at the menu because the waitress kept rushing us to order so weCould leave. We ordered two appetizers and one entree, she grilled us and said so you just want appetizers to share ? I work in the restaurant business too and understand that waitresses work hard for their tips but it's their service that we tip for and not their food. I wish that she wasn't so concerned about her tip and how much we would order and treated us like the table next to use that was using a black card. After ordering she served us and didn't check up on us. The food was alright, the rośe was good as all rośe is. The service was not good. She didn't check on us or refill our water. The bus boy came to empty our wine bottle and poured the wine out into two cups in a unequal manner that caused us to order another bottle because two people had full glasses while the other two had empty cups. This happened twice because we ordered three bottles. I couldn't tell if he was pouring the way he did because he didn't care or because they  wanted us to order more. After the third bottle, our waitress finally came to check up on us, still didn't refill our waters, and asked if she can remove our stuff. Overall the view was alright-- you just saw a bunch of skyscrapers. The only complaint I would have is that the chairs are way too close together, back to back. We had to keep moving our table forward so the people behind us can sit directly in front of the table and not angled. The impression I got is that the waitresses and hostesses tended to tourists, which is understandable because it is time square and that they only cared for the people spending money. I am baffled that they looked down upon four girls who bought 3 bottles, two separate drinks, an entree and two appetizers just because we didn't order an entree each. There are literally about 6 items for entrees so don't be surprised that people prefer appetizers. Also, I understand that it may get busy which is why they place people who are only getting drinks at the bar. However, if someone plans to eat , regardless if it's one entree or 5 appetizers, they should allow them to sit down and enjoy their food like human beings. At the end , we still tipped our waitress 20% even though she did nothing but make us feel uncomfortable. If she made us feel welcomed, not only would we tip better but we would actually come back.I will not come back here.",1,,

The ambience was good, the view was pretty, I was expecting it to be more airy since it is a rooftop but there is a roof and big glass windows surrounding the place. The service and the view makes me give this place the 3 stars I have given.The food wasn't that great, not a lot of options. The dinner menu was literally one side of a menu card and the other side only listed alcoholic drinks, they don't have any mocktails but would make any cocktail virgin if you ask, HOWEVER, they'll charge you the same amount for your virgin drink , their drinks are expensive ($14 and up) but at least they should charge less for the virgin one (like any other normal place would do). We ordered the mezze platter (on our servers suggestion) white pizza and fish tacos. The best out of all 3 was the fish tacos and even they were your average fish tacos, nothing special! The white pizza was a dried up bread with cheese on top, the one your 12 year old sister could make at home! I'd rather get the 99cents pizza two blocks away! The mezzo platter, which the server said was amazing, turned out to be a bunch of raw vegetables with a few cold pieces of pita bread, nothing special or creative and def not worth the money.If you wana go for the ambience and view, you'll have a great time here but you'll be wasting your time n money if you're m expecting good food!",2,,
80,Ang H.,"Dorchester Center, Boston, MA",130,21,7,4.0,10/8/2017,"I came here with family (party of 5) after browsing and searching around Times Square for a casual dining restaurant, but with a view. The ""rooftop"" is actually covered- which defeats the point of a rooftop lounge, BUT the walls are all glass so it does feel a lot more open in that sense.You enter the lobby (which gives you a sort of night club vibe, with a velvet rope and waiting line/seating area for the elevator up to the roof top lounge area).The rooftop section has two levels, we were seated on the first level. Service was prompt, but our waittress was not-so-great to keep it short. However, her relatively poor service didn't overshadow our food and the great view!We ordered the truffle fries, meat and cheese plate, and hummus and pita to share- all of which were absolutely delicious! Our main plates were all spectacular as well- salmon, chicken, filet mignon- honestly I do not think you could go wrong with any choice on that menu. Will definitely be back again! (I'm kind of surprised how our food was so good, esp after reading other reviews on this place)It is a great restaurant for a small group or a date night, with almost all of the tables by the glass walls  being 2 person only tables. I'm inclined to believe it would be a better view at night.The food and drinks are pretty expensive, with a glass of wine at $12-$14 each, and almost all entrees being over $25",1,,

86,Brendalynne F.,"Lodi, NJ",629,221,2342,3.0,2/4/2016,"*Disclaimer: Lots of compliments followed by ""but"" for this restaurant lol.I've been meaning to check out a rooftop restaurant or bar in the city for a while now, so I was really happy to see a deal for one! I bought a LivingSocial deal here for one appetizer or salad to share (up to $15), two entrees (up to $25 each), and two cocktails (up to $14 each) for my boyfriend and myself. Be sure to read the fine print for the voucher before you make a reservation because you can't use the deal on Fridays or Saturdays. Also if you like something that exceeds what the deal covers, they let you order the food and pay the difference. Just thought it was worth mentioning because some places don't let you order outside the deal's price range!Drinks: We both ordered a Solstice cocktail. So yummy, I recommend it! But we got the smallest serving ever. I know Prosecco is served in a champagne glass, but our glasses weren't even halfway full with the other ingredients added.Appetizer: The mushroom risotto was flavorful, creamy, and generous with mushrooms! But the risotto rice tasted slightly undercooked.Entrees: I got steak au poivre, cooked medium. I got such a generous NY strip steak that was seasoned perfectly, and the fries on the side were nice and crispy! But it tasted really dry for a medium. Manny got the sesame crusted tuna. He said that the seaweed salad was amazing and it tasted super fresh, but he wished they served a bigger portion because he was still hungry when we left.Service: I've read awful reviews about the elevator guy being rude or pushy, but I guess Manny and I got lucky this past Sunday evening because the elevator guy we met was very courteous and kind. He even offered to take pictures for us in front of the fireplace! The restaurant staff was great too; everyone was welcoming and helpful. Our server (Genesis, I think?) was awesome!Rooftop view and decor: The rooftop view was lacking. We had a gorgeous view of a parking garage and tall business buildings (sarcasm, lol). But the décor for their ""Winter Wonderland"" was so cute! Beautiful lighting and snowflakes everywhere!I'd rather try another rooftop restaurant than come back here and pay full price for our next meal, but I'm glad we gave this place a try.",6,3,1
87,Erica O.,"Union, KY",47,24,55,5.0,4/18/2017,"A wonderful experience from start to finish! We were warmly greeted in the hotel lobby and ushered to the rooftop elevator. High level of service was continued for the duration of our stay. We love this place! The ambiance was great! Service was warm, attentive and very friendly. I'm very glad we chose to have cocktails and dinner at this location. I would certainly return!As a side note., We had our boys ages 11 and 8 with us and they enjoyed their dining experience as well!Bottom line, great place for drinks, dinner, and a wonderful view!",,,
88,Diana Q.,"Babylon, NY",397,835,1431,3.0,2/16/2016,"Visit Date: February 11, 2016 My friend and I came here for dinner when she found a deal through travel zoo. The atmosphere is incredible and fun, the staff is so very friendly but the food is definitely not much to talk about. My advice would be to come here for some cocktails and enjoy the lounge  but I wouldn't eat here again. I'm not sure what they do in the summer, but in the winter they enclose the rooftop so you can be on it but still be warm and they decorate it like a little ski chalet which was definitely half the fun of dining here. To be on a Manhattan rooftop is also a very incredible feeling, I like it better in the warmth but I appreciate the fact that at least this place encloses their rooftop for the winter so you can enjoy it year round. For an app we had the guac & chips. It was honestly so so. The chips weren't flavorful and the guac had no flavor either. For dinner I had the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle sauce. Tasted like there was no truffle sauce on it just a bland flavorless white sauce. For dessert we shared the s'mores for two which sounded a lot better than how it actually came. You can't really mess s'mores up but the menu said the peanut butter was warm and it was cold. Also the presentation of the dessert could have been better. So my recommendation is to drink cocktails here if that's your thing but unless they improve the food service you can skip dining here.",3,,
89,Lindsay C.,"Northwest Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",0,3,0,1.0,8/26/2018,"Where to I start...1. The view is terrible.2. It took 10 mins for someone to ask us if we wanted to order a something to drink3. Our waitress only came to our table 3 times-- once to take our order- next time to ask us if we had placed our order (mind you she took our order)- and lastly to bring us our ticket. No refills, no asking how our food is, no so we need anything else. 4. The food was edible- meaning I got the lobster roll and I'm pretty sure I can buy that at the deli and my boyfriend ordered Penne Pasta with chicken and the chicken looked like it was out of a can. In fact, we could've gotten that at the Olive Garden for a 3rd of the price and it would've probably tasted better. Overall- this place is not worth the price. It is clearly for tourist who think they are getting the ""New York experience"" however, all they are getting is an overpriced Olive Garden at best that overlooks a Port-A-Potty. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.",,,

Once we were upstairs at the rooftop she denied us a seat stating that everything was full. There were at least several tables available. And EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS WHITE. I'm black. My spouse is Asian and Spanish.  If you're white you'll fit it. If you're any other race don't count on it. We're from California just visiting the family. I'm so disgusted with this place. I hope that woman gets fired.  She disgust me. I'm glad we didn't eat here. They probably would've spit in our food.",,,

The drinks were well priced for the size and strength. I didn't have any food but the rooftop and the drinks are enough to warrant a return trip. Other reviews saying there was a wait at the elevator must have gone at a very busy hour because there is never anyone waiting when I have been in the past.",,,

Someone called me after 15 mins & confirmed my reservation.As you enter the hotel through main entrance you get nice lounge feel & everyone is very professional. They gave us free coat check in and guide us through the elevator to go on rooftop. There was no line. Rooftop is on 10th floor which is not that high to see city beautiful view. As its winter season rooftop was covered with drapes and heat was on. Decor was beautiful but you can't see much outside as the view is blocked.We were seated as soon as we got there. Love the table set up as its spacious & not too close to each other. I am glad bar area for happy hour is separate from Dinner area so you don't have to witness loud happy hour crowd. It was not that busy so service was pretty fast.Groupon deal was 2 cocktails, 1 appetizer, 2 entree. We ordered more than that & paid the difference. Cocktails was very well made & food was above average .I am taking 1 star away as they charged $10 for 1 Bottle of Fiji water which I think is ridiculous. I didn't even ask for Fiji water.Overall nice place after work for drinks or dinner for couple, friends or family.",1,,

At the host stand, the two young ladies could have been more welcoming but for the most part were pleasant and attentive. Most places will not seat partial parties so I ended up starting with a glass of sparkling wine at the bar. Serge was the bartender. He didn't say much except to drop off a menu and to ask what I would like to drink but again was overall pleasant and attentive. Once at the table, Axel, the server greeted us promptly and offered drinks right away. He gave us time to further peruse the menu and had a good sense of timing. The managers and staff were present and available at all times throughout the meal and were very accommodating. The food was pretty good as well. No complaints. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone. It's a great rooftop atmosphere with shade and a great staff. Reasonably priced for brunch! Please go and check it out!",,,

They had music playing, very friendly staff.We ordered our drinks which was a margarita pitcher (groupon deal) and we got crab cakes. The only downside would be, we were expecting two crab cakes or at least a good portion, we only got one small crab cake that was overpriced! the drinks were pretty good; we were actually planning on only ordering drinks and apps but we got really hungry, and after that small appetizer for like $10 or $11 we decided to order dinner, so we ordered steak and fries, the steak was delicious!

From the hostess who always greets me with a smile to the servers who are ever accommodating, this place makes you feel special. If only the food was up to par. The deciding factor for me unfortunately occurred last night when I took my partner there for a last minute date night. As always I was promptly greeted and taken to a beautiful table. I ordered the Tuna while my partner had the White Pizza. I try to stay away from gluten so I cannot speak for the pizza but my partner seemed to love it. We both enjoyed the Tuna (but it was not our favorite)My issue with the food here occurred later that night in bed when my stomach started to turn. What happened next can only be described as multiple trips back and forth to the bathroom. Seeing that my partner has the same issue, it has to be the tuna (it was the only thing we both ate together all day).

The staff made us feel very welcomed and special even though we were just going to the bar. They took us up to the rooftop and asked the hostess to please seat us (talk about fancy service!).We sat in a comfortable lounge area and I ordered a whiskey-based cocktail on the menu (I can't remember the name, but it had mint). It was strong and good, if you like mint. It was November so of course it wasn't open-air, but it still offered nice views of the area.

The only reason why I did not complain about paying for this garbage was because it was a birthday dinner and I honestly just wanted to leave. I was more embarrassed that i suggested this place. When you read the reviews from here take it seriously. Horrible food. This chef must have lost their taste buds.

109,Connor O.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,0,1.0,4/30/2017,"This was a thoroughly disappointing afternoon at brunch. My friend ordered a table with couch seating for her birthday, but they didn't have one to accommodate us, so they put us in the cocktail area - some people seated on couches, some standing at high tables. We then discovered that if you picked the wrong seat, you'd be eating brunch out of your lap. We had to order drinks multiple times for them to come, nearly a half an hour after they got ordered. And that was just for iced coffee. We had to ask for silverware multiple times. The yogurt with granola ($9) came warmer than room temperature, and the Huevos Rancheros ($17) were cold scrambled eggs on top of grocery store tortillas with refried beans coating the bottom of the plate. Three people never received their orders, and the servers maybe came around once for the people that ordered bottomless mimosas/bloodies ($20 on top of the $29 price fixe). One member of our party ordered his food at 2:45, and they did not receive their order until forty minutes later, when the server came over to ask how they were enjoying their food, only to see that they hadn't received the food at all. It turned into a real symphony of dysfunction, only allayed by some of us talking the waiter into getting a piece of cake for the birthday girl and discounting pieces of the check. In addition, the doorman informed us of the dress code when we arrived, which included ""no homeboy hats."" We took this to mean baseball hats, but the racial undertone threw us for a loop as well. He told us all about it anyways, in case we decided ""to come back in a couple of weeks."" We won't be.",4,,

He had to take it off. Hadn't done his hair so he was embarrassed. I was also told my shoes were unacceptable since they didn't have s back strap. They were NOT flip flops... they were very nice flat, expensive flat sandals. So this started off badly. Then, when we were seated, our table was literally on a ramp. Yes, on a ramp.

However, we lost our table because people had reservations at 7:30pm (despite being kicked off at 7pm..) so we were forced to stand around randomly just to find spots.Elevator - the wait is so long!! I guess with the hotel being a hotel and all.. the elevator has to stop at more than one floor so it takes a while to get down to the lobby. I think I waited 10 min altogether and the line was out the door from the elevator. At least there are couches around if you need to sit and the lobby has a very nice interior decoration.The bartenders were nice, drinks were decent and the view is alright (you really only see typical office buildings around.. not so much the city view). However, if the game is on, at least you'd be able to watch it if you were standing in front of the bar.Smoking areas are available near the bathrooms (there are only two bathrooms by the way.. Unisex but the place isn't really all that big so it's enough for the guests). Couple of security guards who stand around in case anything goes wrong and to make sure people aren't smoking in non-smoking permitted areas. There are also two floors to the rooftop - one higher and one lower. I'd had prefer to be on the upper level but since my friends could not find space on top, we had to make do with the lower level. No complaints really.. just that it's not as high up as I'd have prefer.Food is alright.. ordered the hummus platter. I mean, what can you really go wrong with pita bread and hummus.. We did also try the pizza which tasted homemade and sliders but nothing really out of the ordinary that made me want to REALLY go back there again.Pricing - city pricing which will cost you $5 per beer and $7 per wine for Happy Hour only! (I think it's either 4-7pm or 5-7pm). Otherwise, each drink is $8 for beer and obviously a bit more for cocktails. The Manhattan wasn't bad - not too strong yet not watered down that I couldn't taste anything. Sangrias were really good! Tasted more so like juice than anything yet you get the feeling knowing it's an alcoholic beverage.Prob. wouldn't pick this place as the top choice for a rooftop bar next time.. There are better places in midtown around the 34th street area that I'd prefer with better views and music choice.",3,1,2

I would never want to wait tables at this place.  I went to one of the high tables next to the bar and we had this guy, Fred or something, tall with big muscles taking care of us.  The poor damn guy was running his ass off!  I think I counted him taking care of over 15 tables at one point!  He was amazing! ...........With that said.....I'm sorry but this is just abusive to your staff.  Where were the managers in all of this?!?!?!?!

124,A M.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",41,52,5,3.0,1/8/2018,I'm a bit torn with this review. First the atmosphere. It was excellent. Warm. Inviting. Romantic. Really feels like your in a ski chalet. The service was great. Friendly and inviting. Now the food. They have a pre dinner theater menu that offers three courses for $49.  They didn't give us this option and the waiter wasn't aware when we asked. Had I not looked at the menu on their website I wouldn't have been aware that it existed. But the waiter was nice enough to ask someone and found out it was real and brought us the menus. Our first course was the calamari. It was good. Nice and crispy. A few prices a little over cooked but pretty good over all. For entree my husband had the Havenly Chicken and I had the Mushroom Gnocchi with truffle oil. The chicken was really tasty. Seasoned well and moist which isn't easy with chicken breast. It was served with salad and fries on the plate. It seemed a little confused. I think a different type of potato would have been better. My Gnocchi was cooked well but there was way to much truffle oil. Truffle oil should be like an accent. Something that adds depth to a dish. This dish was very over powered by the truffle oil. I honestly did not enjoy it and only ate a small amount. For desert we had crem brûlée and chocolate moose. Both were delicious. However if you like your moose light and fluffy don't go for this one. It was thick and rich. But I thought it was great.  I ordered a drink with proseco (sp?) and fruit purée that was absolutely delicious. Would we go again? Yes. But I would do apps drinks and desert. I think it would have been 5 stars had we done that.,,,

We came in & settled towards the back by the bar area within a few minutes by chance we got lucky & were able to grab a table & chairs. They offer limited happy hour specials selected beers & house wines. We started with some wine , Pinot Grigio is always a good choice for me .. Good wine. After a few we moved onto some different drinks I went with Stoli raspberry & cranberry not bad , friends had Jack & diet also good. After a few drinks we decide to get some food. We ended up ordering Truffle Fries , Calamari & Wings. Truffle fries are very good , good dipping sauce with the truffle taste. Calamari was good as well. The wings were also not bad nice & crispy but kinda on the small size. As for the place itself good set up with plenty of tables to sit , decent music playing good atmosphere. Being that the weather was a bit unpredictable I enjoyed the enclosed space it was nice to enjoy being on a roof top without having to worry if it was going to rain on my parade. Bartenders were nice & attentive , good service not sure on prices since my friends were treating I believe when we looked the place up it was reasonable.

She recommended the gnocchi, the steak, and a couple other meals, but we were sold on the first two she mentioned. My girlfriend got the gnocchi, which was definitely amazing! I got the steak and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by how big the portion was. The steak was delicious, it wasn't dry at all, even though I ordered it medium-well. Overall, we had a very nice experience. Though, the only thing we weren't too fond of was the overly loud music.

You take a small elevator up to the rooftop deck (for us it was enclosed due to winter time) but it was nicely decorated. There was snow flakes hanging from the ceiling and snow decorations. It was small, only a few high top tables and couches and what not. But it could be a really nice place to just chill in the summer when its open and nice weather. Crowd was very diverse, mostly young people ages 21-26.The thing I didn't like was the pricing. It was $14 for a martini drink, but it was very small. In their defense it was a strong drink though.

Since it was a rainy night, I thought fine, maybe they'll dine us on the inside of the restaurant. However, they have a plastic roof where you are still sitting on the patio part. It was very nice, I really like it. The only downfall is the food, my bf had the lobster roll which tasted kinda too fishy and he said it tasted mayo. I liked the chicken I had, it was really good. There isn't much food choices which I've noticed a lot of the reviews complained about prior to going here and I agree. If you do not have a voucher, food is a bit pricy especially for the type that they offer. With our travelzoo voucher I paid 69 for a meal that could've costed about 120 which was a pretty great deal. We had a bottle of wine and a cheese and crackers with some prucioto meat that was very good. So just 4 stars just because I wasn't able to have much choices of food.

My husband works for a specialty beverage distributor and a former bartender himself, so he knows the bottle prices.  Maybe up charging customers is the way things are done in NYC, but I would suggest being careful if you go here and definitely check your ticket to ensure you weren't overcharged.I will say the ambience was nice, it was heated and cozy.  However the cushions could be a bit thicker.  While the view was okay, the lack of service dampened our overall mood.",,,

The only thing that I thought was weird was their pricing. I asked for a titos and club: $14, next time I just asked for vodka club and they poured grey goose: $14, then I got stoli club and one time it was $14 the next time it was $12. So either vodka club is the same price for any kind of vodka, or the bartenders are just making up prices. Regardless, this place had great music and a great vibe, we'll definitely be back!",1,,

176,Matt M.,"Carlisle, PA",0,7,0,1.0,12/15/2017,"Disappointing to say the least.  I signed up for yelp just to make this review.  This place should be avoided at all cost if you are attempting to have a dinner with your significant other and not having to literally scream at them to have a conversation.  It's super tight so people are always running into you or the staff almost hitting your wife in the face with a table being moved from one part of the restaurant to another.  Food was expensive and over cooked.  We couldn't eat fast enough and leave but the service was so horrific I had to ask multiple times for the check.  My wife picked the place during our visit so I first attempted to get another beer to maybe get intoxicated enough to forget this entire experience and not hurt her feelings for picking this garbage location but apparently they don't know how to serve customers.  When the food finally came there was no ketchup or mustard for our sliders which looked like burned clumps of something.  Luckily the blood leaking from my ears from exploded ear drums from the incredibly loud music gave these burgers some moisture. Just stay away unless you enjoy your ears bleeding, yelling at your wife/husband, super expensive food and drinks, horrible service, and being stuck on the elevator with the restaurant trash cans headed down to street level.....  Unbelievably bad....  I'm getting angry just thinking about this place 24 hours later.",,,

We were charged TWENTY DOLLARS when we asked for water. WHO CHARGES FOR WATER. When we told the waitress that we had asked for tap water she wouldn't fix the problem. Our waitress really wasn't attentive at all. Every time we tried to get the attention of any wait staff they diverted eye contact and would ignore us.

(this sums it up pretty well)Great place for happy hour drinks before 7pm, but wouldn't come here for the food.LivingSocial Deal: I've seen this 3-course dinner deal and my SO was interested in coming here for his birthday dinner, so I decided to purchase it and made reservations. The deal mentioned one appetizer to share, two entrees/pastas/pizzas, and two cocktails. We checked the menu out and were excited for the filet mignon and steak au poivre. First of all, the deal did not specify there was a $$ limit on entrées or say anything that steak entrees were not part of the deal. We mentioned to the server we had a LivingSocial deal for prix-fixe dinner. The server checked with the manager and came back to say we can order any appetizer and order any entree up to $34. We asked if we can pay extra for the filet mignon ($36), and the server says we can pay the difference for it. Ok, so far so good. So, we went ahead to order the mussels & frites appetizer. It was a good amount of mussels & fries for two people, but taste was pretty bland IMO. We wanted to order the filet mignon ($36) and the steak au poivre ($32), but server said she had to recheck with the manager and she came back this time saying we can't order any steak entrees.  Um, Seriously....after you first told us we can order any entrée up to $34 and pay the difference for the filet mignon? The rest of the menu that we had to choose was ONE chicken option and 5 different fish/seafood options, all UNDER $28. We didn't want any pastas or pizzas. So why was ""any entree up to $34"" mentioned? Not sure if the restaurant needs to update LivingSocial on what their deal ACTUALLY includes or NOT includes, but we would not have bought it if we knew steaks were not included. We were not enjoying our time after getting our hopes up for the steaks, then not being able to order it even when we DID mention we would pay extra. We ended up ordering the sesame crusted tuna and the branzino. The sesame crust on the tuna was too salty after a few bites, so had to cut off the crust in order to eat the rest of the tuna. My SO did not enjoy his branzino, as it had bones. I think the way the fish was prepared was just for presentation. It was upsetting to see him not enjoy his birthday dinner. We finished and paid our bill and went somewhere else to enjoy the rest of his birthday.The rooftop is not much of a view as it's only on the 11th floor, but it's a cool place to chill for happy hour drinks at the bar only.",2,,

Drinks were good_ can't say consistent because after she took our order didn't  come back after it was time for the check. Food was good and tasty but nothing that would want to make me come back. We asked for waters and other stuff to the busboys _ pretty much the busboys did all the work.

181,Aaron B.,"Evanston, IL",173,20,13,3.0,1/14/2016,"Went here before a show a few weeks ago, and overall it was a decent experience. For a rooftop bar, the view wasn't exceptional, but the palm tree/tropical decor was a welcome sight in the dead of winter.Ordered the Crab and Avocado Palette to start, and while it was creamy and tasty, the portion size did not justify the price (even for NYC). The Pan Seared Salmon was flavorful and crispy on the outside, but a bit dry on the inside. The Holy Fries were a hit though - huge portion of crispy, shoestring-style fries with a creamy aioli dipping sauce. I am not ashamed to admit that we devoured the whole plate (okay maybe a little ashamed).The service actually wound up being an integral part of the experience. We informed them that we had a show starting in 90 minutes and they were very respectful and efficient. Even more impressively, someone in our party left a scarf behind (not naming any names), and the staff was very helpful in retrieving it three hours later.Overall, good service, decent atmosphere, and hit-or-miss food for the price, but you can probably do better in the Theater District.",5,3,2
182,Yo M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,11,0,1.0,8/22/2017,"Saw an article on DNA Info about where to watch the eclipse. On the spur of the moment, decided to go to the one closest to where I live, which happened to be at The Sanctuary Hotel, the rooftop bar there, Haven Rooftop. The promo I saw said doors open at 1pm - $20 includes a drink and glasses to watch the eclipse. No mention of reservations. I actually tried to see if there was a reservation situation going on there but found no evidence of it. Got there about 20 minutes early and stood in line. 1pm came and went. Then there were staff members going through the line asking if anyone had reservations. Then I overheard someone asking about the doors open time and a staff member answered that people with reservations were being let in first, but there weren't that many people who had reservations. WTF? So finally around 2pm a group of us is led into an elevator. The doors close. Nothing happens. One person on the elevator started having a panic attack. Someone rang the bell. Someone else called the front desk to let them know we were stuck in the elevator. Thankfully, someone in the lobby was able to pry the doors open and set us free. Then a staff member led us to this other elevator where we'd have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the rooftop bar. OK, whatever. We get to the top. We actually have to walk up 2 flights to get to the rooftop bar. So we start trying to find out about glasses and if the hotel will at least comp us a drink for our trouble. No and no. People with reservations had priority, which apparently meant no glasses for us. Was able to get a drink at the bar for $13. And kudos to the clearly overworked bartender. She really kept her cool and after I bought 2 glasses of wine, comped me a third. A couple of people lent me their glasses so I could see the eclipse, which was cool. They also had the TV at the bar tuned to a channel that was covering the eclipse,  which was great. Overall, though. Haven Rooftop, you have to go back to customer service school. This should have been a no-brainer. You were obviously making hand over fist via the bar tabs alone, not to mention food being ordered. In the middle of an otherwise slow Monday afternoon. Shame on you.",1,,
183,Lorena V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,8/21/2017,"My friends and I wanted to go to the eclipse party so we called a week ahead of time to make a reservation, we were told it would be first come first served and to be there early. OK. 3 days before the eclipse we called again, you know.. just in case they changed their minds. No, still first come first served. the day before, same story... So we decide to get there early. We were right at the front of the line 30mins early. Then at 1pm we notice them going up and down the line asking who has a reservation. Hmm.. OK.. so we wait and although the door was supposed to open at 1pm it didn't open until 1:26pm! (Yes I kept track, by that point I felt insulted but I was supposed to meet people there) We went up, no glasses, no special cocktails as promised on the flyer. We headed to the bar area after putting our names down for extra glasses. But surprise surprise, we didn't get glasses even though the guys who put their names down after us got some (we were 4 girls) The only thing I can conclude from this is that if you have an accent you don't get a reservation and they dismiss you like you're not a valuable customer. (All 4 of us have accents, some british, some french) I am, however, a US citizen and very annoyed at the treatment me and my friends received. If anyone else had that experience with them please feel free to reach out! This isn't right and something should be done!",1,,

Every review said that they had nice ambiance and the food was delicious and it was so much fun! So I gave it a try.....We had a reservation for 7pm. We didn't get to sit at a table till 8pm.... The whole point of us making a reservation was so we don't have to wait! We were hungry and excited to go out for dinner... But that whole wait just ruined our mood and got us more hungry. They did bring us sparkling wine after having been waiting for 45 minutes sure that was nice. They're drinks are too I dont know we Had the safe haven drink I think but it was just too sour, it had lime juice and passion fruit I thought it would be sweet but I couldn't even finish it. We ordered different foods off the menu, the penne pasta, the chicken, the seafood linguini.... It didn't take a long time for them to arrive, but the two penne plates... Well the pasta was still hard and not cooked to a satisfactionary level, and I ordered it with shrimp, which was 8$ more, for that value I figured I would be getting at least 4-5 whole shrimps but no I got 2 shrimps.... Yup and they were cut in half to make it look like 4 shrimps. I could have bought a pound of shrimp with 8$ and made two different types of pastas and had at least 15 pieces of shrimp in each dish... Oh well... It was too loud too many business people's just standing in the bar area and drinking, two private parties were there but they were roped off to the bar side but still they were rowdy and loud, the seating was nice, the decoration was cozy, but THERE IS NP VIEW! I wouldn't recommend anyone coming out here for the food it's over priced, the drinks... If that's your type of thing then go right ahead but other than that...

We had a private bar, cool couches to lounge on in addition to bar height tables scattered about. The service was absolutely phenomenal! Servers were very attentive and had a great memory. We had appetizers passed around and let me tell you- they were so good! Far supposed average bar food.Overall, it's a great spot to come with friends if you make reservations.

The checkroom is next to the elevator, and the tuxedo-ed button pusher will make the final determination. Beware!There is a small under-the-sky space in the center on the roof. On one side is a covered area with a DJ... WHAT?? On the other side is a covered area without a DJ, nice but not really rooftop. The Slavic staff was very professional, if a bit on the cool side. The beer selection was bottles only-- all bigger brewers or their recent purchases. (Can you say Anheuser Busch = Goose Island?) The mussels were tasty and filling. One order is enough for two-- or three if you're not super hungry. (Our server called them ""small personal sizes"" when we ordered.)

Came here for a friend's birthday, we all had drinks and a meal, some got dessert. I had the sangria and the mojito, both were pitchers for the table than many of us shared. You get about 5 decent sized drinks out of a pitcher, and the server pours them for you which is nice. Both tasted great and were strong. For dinner, I had a chicken dish. How they slice the chicken so thin and have it stay juicy is beyond me, I wish I had asked. It was really well seasoned. It came with a salad and mashed potatoes, both which were pretty standard.The service was good, our server always made sure to check that we were doing okay. My only complaint about this place is that to me, it feels so so SO pricey. I understand it's a rooftop bar/restaurant in Manhattan, but for me, I had two drinks and dinner and my bill came to $70 which is high in my opinion. And no, I didn't have to pay for the birthday girl, her parents covered her stuff, so that price isn't inflated. The atmosphere here is great, I'd probably come back for just drinks (if that's possible, there were tables everywhere).",4,,
