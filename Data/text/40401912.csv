Updated review","Went in for a late Wednesday night dinner. Thankfully the kitchen is open till 11pm on Wednesday's. Outdoor seating is only available till 10:50, so my boyfriend and I grabbed a seat inside. For drinks, he ordered a whiskey sour with four roses (whopping $10!) and I stuck with the Summer Rye. Nice pour. The two of us split a cup of French Onion Soup (cheesier and just as flavorful as last time!) and fried mozzarella balls. There was a thin layer of breading and a ton of mozz, so it wasn't too heavy and really let you appreciate the fresh cheese. I wish the tomato sauce was a little more flavorful. For our main, we split the Onieals Fettuccine. As Janice would say: Oh. My. God! Just thinking about it is making me drool. We substituted the sun dried tomatoes for artichoke hearts at no additional cost. Even the pasta noodles were high quality and cooked to perfection. The sauce was so scrumptious my boyfriend and I were debating whether or not we should order bread to sop it all up. All the while we were bopping our heads to the music -- really great playlist. Even had to whip out Shazam. Again, I truly recommend you stop by ONieals for dinner. If you're not looking to sit in the main bar area, you can choose outdoor seating by the park or a cozy, romantic nook in the back room with dim lighting and candles. See you there!",,,1
1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,2.0,11/2/2018,"We were trying to decide on a brunch destination, and I mentioned that I had never visited Onieals.  We figured that their back room would offer some solace from the crazy football fans we assumed would be surrounding the bar.  We decided that this was a good time to give it a shot and wound up being correct on the benefit of the quiet back room.  Others had apparently had the same notion, since we had a brief 10 minute wait for our table.  Once we were seated, I selected a Proud Mary from their substantial Bloody Mary list.  This version was described as ""New Orleans style"" with Old Bay seasoning on the rim and a stalk of pickled asparagus as a garnish.  I found their juice mix to be too tomato-ish and reminiscent of salsa.  It needed some horseradish and Worcestershire sauce for a savory kick.  Also, I took a bite of the pickled stalk of asparagus and looked down at the remaining half of the green stick only to find, to my horror, green mold growing on it!  I quickly spit out the first bite, which I had thankfully not swallowed, and alerted our server.  He returned with a new version of the beverage without the offending garnish, which I cautiously enjoyed.In terms of my meal, I decided to steer clear of the sandwiches and burgers, opting instead for the healthier Grilled Chicken Salad.  A large plate of Mixed Greens were topped with grilled chicken, Bermuda onion, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, capers, and fresh mozzarella, all beneath a light dressing of balsamic vinaigrette.  The poultry was a bit dry, but otherwise flavorful.  Aside from the chicken, the rest of the salad was not very inspired or unique.Sure, I was happy to finally try Onieals, but I was not thrilled by the actual experience.  I would give it a 2.5-star rating.",4,2,1
2,Dan G.,"Montclair, NJ",67,145,7,1.0,7/5/2018,"A wasted meal for us. Terrible service and execution, I almost walked out. We visited on Wed July 4th mid afternoon and Onieals was lightly filled as we were seated immediately. We quickly placed orders for drinks and meals. Our drinks made it back to us quickly but then we waited for 30 minutes for our meals. A salad....and a burger; seriously? Should've been 12 minutes, max! 30 minutes of just sitting there with no interaction from our server to address the lengthy wait. Unacceptable in my opinion. I got up to try and find him and when I did he then explained that its a small kitchen and they just got slammed with tickets but he'd check for me. A few minutes later the meals arrived. The salad was lovely. The burger was basically raw in the middle and I after 3 bites I just tossed in the towel and asked for the check. 30 minute wait for a meal that was poorly executed - that's kinda where I draw the line. They didn't charge me for my meal, I walked elsewhere and enjoyed a nice lunch.",1,2,
3,Christina B.,"New York, NY",285,257,764,3.0,1/21/2018,"Was excited to finally try ""the best burgers"" after having lived in the area for 4 years. When you walk in, it's an upscale bar with a small seating area in the back. They don't take reservations but we only ended up waiting about 10 minutes for a table. Service was quick as servers were attentive. After having read reviews on the non-burger food, we decided to order two burgers for entrees and the penne vodka appetizer. Surprisingly, we both liked the penne vodka appetizer more than our meals. For burgers, we got the The Ragin Cajun and the Wallstreeter. The meat within the burgers itself is cooked well but the burgers themselves are very plain and come with a store bought bun. The Wallstreeter was better than the Ragin Cajun as the Ragin was actually a bit try even when adding the sauce. For drinks, I liked the Mexican Mule. Would definitely come back to try more non-burgersService: 4Burgers: 3Penne vodka app: 4Drink selection: 2.5Mexican Mule: 3.5",,,
4,Bonnie P.,"Secaucus, NJ",277,277,388,4.0,5/7/2018,"Stopped in at 1:20 AM for some late night eats after a long night drinking. It is a small place and mostly the front of the bar was still open and the back was closed, but it was clear there was still enough people scattered in this restaurant. Ordered the Nachos with chicken and jalapeno cheese fries, um it was amazing!! I know that although we were drinking it may not be the best account but I was still sober and we were just snacking before we ended our night and literally it may be the best nachos that I have had in my life. Chicken nachos, piled HIGH with guacamole, sour cream over a mound of nacho chips and cubed chicken pieces. The whole dish was clearly assembled then tossed into the oven so that all the cheese would melt nicely over the chips, it was literally amazing! Not sure why it was so good, but maybe it was the quantity of food, cheese, and guac or maybe I was just so surprised by the dish at this random bar. Cheese fries were piping hot, cheesy and very nice. Would definitely order both items again the next time I am here. Drinks were standard quite nice, nothing to really complain about. Prices are standard for Hoboken, was just ecstatic to be pleasantly surprised before the end of the night.",3,,2
5,Johnny G.,"New York, NY",192,228,220,4.0,5/27/2018,"Perfect place for a date now that I think about it. I went on a Saturday night with a group of friends at dinnertime. It was about an hour wait. They let us sit at the bar if we were drinking. A tad annoyed about that.The menu is American food, the top item is the burgers so I had to try it for myself. It was delicious! Our waitress was very playful with us after I had no clue what I wanted.",,,
6,Belle D.,"Dumont, NJ",583,115,176,4.0,3/29/2018,"My boyfriend lives a block away from Onieals, so we always pass it while walking to or from our cars. It's always packed and after reading yelp reviews, it makes sense why! When we were looking for a place to eat dinner for our date night, Onieals was at the top of our list.The seating is very limited, but thankfully we came on a Sunday night and it wasn't very crowded. We were seated in the dining room and given menus to make our choices for dinner. We were sitting for 15 minutes before asking if we wanted anything from the bar and if we were ready to order - this is where they lost a star for me. We saw waitresses constantly visiting other tables, but felt that our waitress had neglected us. We didn't even get bread for our table. When we were finally seen, we ordered their hummus and The Wall Streeter burger with monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar. The hummus came out with warm, lightly toasted pita, which was perfect since we were starting to develop a strong sense of hunger by this time. The hummus very blended, so if you're into chunkier hummus, you might not like the texture/consistency. I usually like chunkier hummus, but found the balance of acid with the chick peas to be perfect. My burger came out exactly as ordered and the bacon was crisp to perfection. I understand now why people claim that Onieals has the best burgers in Hoboken.Overall, I would come back for dinner the next time I was in the mood for a burger in the neighborhood. If the service was better, this would have easily been a 5 star review from me!",4,,1

Updated review","Update! Burgers and Mac & cheese 5/5 so good!! The waitress even brought over warm bread so we could mop up the warm cheesy goodness- we also really like the waitresses and the homemade pesto! So good!Great hidden gem, stopped by on a Saturday around 11 and the place was comfortably busy. We sat at the bar shared chicken nachos and drank whiskey. The nachos was loaded with toppings. Perfect for a late night snack. Bartenders were friends and helpful- will definitely return def a great place for locals.",,,
9,Erica W.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,12,8,5.0,8/29/2018,One of my new favorite places in Hoboken. You have to get the penne vodka or the chicken parm with vodka sauce. We were shamelessly scraping our plates.,1,,

It's great that they have a gluten free burger option (that's delicious!) and have all gluten free options marked on the menu. They also have gluten free beer and cider.",,,

He proceeded to bark at the staff which was entertaining to watch, but probably not delightful to be on the receiving end of. Will be back.",1,,
15,Maria J.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,7/17/2018,"Just stopped in on my way back from manhattan for a drink. I can't believe I haven't visited this place since I moved to Hoboken.

16,Sara B.,"Jersey City, NJ",3529,651,4948,4.0,8/15/2016,"If you're in Hobo and faced with the 'where should we eat' debate, then I definitely suggest checking out Oneials. The vibe is casual and relaxed, the menu has got plenty of classic and easy to please options and the prices are fair.I came in with some pals on a Wednesday. Partly because we were hungry and needed some food, but largely because of their 1/2 off wine specials. We had a great experience, and I'd definitely come back again for a meal out in da 'boken. Although there was a bit of a wait for a table, live music and half priced wine at the bar made it easy to pass some time. All of the burgers sounded incredible, but unfortunately I'm **trying** to be healthy and ended up going with a spinach salad. The spinach was just about the only healthy part because the salad was smothered in bacon and goat cheese- oooopsies. The menu has a ton of options - everything from pasta dishes to crab cakes. Regardless of what food mood you are in, you are guaranteed to find something that you want to eat.Hoboken has a ton of great dining options, but make sure not to overlook Onieals! If an hour wait on a Wednesday night is any indicator, the food here is pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back in on a weekend to try out some brunch.",14,1,6

Updated review","Used to be pretty good, but it's gone down hill lately.  The burgers were the best thing going on - but they swapped out the bun (was brioche) to cheap supermarket bun.  Expensive for what you now get.Fries are hit or miss - depends on the batch.  Lately they've been super dry.I've tried the entrees, chicken parmesan is not edible.French onion soup is pretty good.Location and outdoor seating is best thing going for it.  I hope they get their act together, I'd like to put this place back in my rotation.",,,
18,Joseph A.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,34,4,3.0,11/5/2017,"Nice staff, good vibe, and a well written menu that touts that perfection takes time. But the food is just OK. Ordered a burger and the meat was done just right - but the bun, toppings, etc were pretty meh considering the cost. Strange to slack off on that stuff when you get the patty right. Fries were also way over cooked. Worth a shot if you live in the area - but once is enough for me.",,1,
19,cy c.,"ASTORIA, NY",85,148,0,4.0,5/3/2018,my friend and I were there at late night because of the recommendation from a staff of another restaurant. I didn't expect much but both of the burger and the fries are pretty good. we didn't quite enjoy the nachos though.,,,1
20,Jason W.,"Hoboken, NJ",26,13,9,5.0,2/28/2017,"I had almost forgotten this place but luckily I stopped in this past Sunday for a late brunch and was lucky enough to get a table in the bar area. It's more fun than the dining room and you can catch the game. Started with the buffalo shrimp. Great buffalo sauce, not too overpowering and lightly fried with no breading which is the key. Anyone worth knowing doesn't eat breaded wings. Great blue cheese dressing too which isn't always a given.Next course was the Shepard's pie. Great flavors. Very simple well seasoned ground beef, peas, carrots, and perfect whipped potato char on top. Near perfection. Not too filling which is nice. It comes with a side of seasoned sautéed spinach. A nice touch because we really needed something green on the table. Dessert: an Irish coffee with Jameson.It's the perfect winter warm up meal at a true  hoboken mainstay. Service is always great. This plays does food right.",2,2,1
21,Jason A.,"Hoboken, NJ",275,98,1315,4.0,4/15/2016,"I came to Onieals on a Thursday night for a quick bite to eat. I was quickly seating in the back of the restaurant. In the back it offers a very warm and intimate atmosphere. In the front of the restaurant there is the bar area with a couple high top tables. It would seem like a perfect place to grab a drink with friends. Onieals are known for their burgers and boy are they good. I think you can not go wrong with their burgers and also the portions size are generous. I ordered my burger medium-well and the chef cooked it perfect! After our initial order it took about 10-13 minutes to get our food. The wait time was not bad at all because they gave us bread and our waiter kept checking up on  us to make sure we were ok. Also, i must note that the prices here are very reasonable. I would highly recommend Onieals to anyone looking for a good burger from a small intimate local spot. I would rate Onieals as follows: Food Quality is 4 Stars, Service is 4 Stars, Atmosphere is 4 Stars and Price is 4 Stars.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.",2,1,1

24,Chris C.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,8,0,1.0,6/10/2017,A lot of my friends like this place so I have given it many chances but I'm not a fan. There is not a good beer selection - only Miller Lite for light beer. The bar in the front is small and not many TVs. The men's bathroom is tinier than a NYC closet. The back dining room is dark. There are a bunch of outdoor seating with views of the park which is nice. And as for the food I'm not impressed. The burgers are sub par and the fries are not memorable. They have a diverse menu but the only thing that I've had hat is tolerable is the chicken noodle soup. Finally the service is not great. Male waiter we had once was good but the female hostess is not attentive nor helpful. Takes a really long time to get a table and the hostess eats her meal in the main dining room for all to see.,3,,

It was swimming in the disgusting gravy and had sooo many whole peppercorns on it. Gross. For $31 bucks I was very disappointed. Also when I pointed out how my steak was over cooked, it fell on deaf ears. No offer to re cook one the right temp or anything. Just, oh that sucks. Only reason I give 2 Was because our waiter was an awesome guy. Hoboken, there are so many good restaurants in our town, this doesn't appear to be one of them based on a bad first impression.",,,
28,Allison W.,"Manayunk, Philadelphia, PA",272,305,26,4.0,10/12/2016,"Onieals was our restaurant of choice for a pit stop in Hoboken en route to Manhattan, and I was somewhat stumped with where we should eat. Onieals had a casual feel, extensive menu, and reasonable prices, so we went with it and it was a great choice.We shared nachos to start (ok, a little heavy handed on the sour cream) and then got a burger (for him) and pasta (for me). Everything was good, but I have to mention the fries! I was snacking on them long after I filled up on pasta, they are just that addicting. It was an interesting concept with the loud sports bar up front and quieter restaurant in the back, but I enjoyed my dining experience.",2,,

This is my go to dinner spot.  If all else fails, if I'm hungry, if I don't want to cook, whatever it is, Onieals is the answer.  The All American burger with bacon is so mouth watering I may have to go over there when I'm done writing this even though I just had one yesterday... There is something to be said for the juice that comes out of your burger when you squish the bun down to take that first bite and I'll be damned if I find a burger that does it better than this one.  I've had a few others ( John Wayne & Caprese ) and tried the Shepherd's Pie on a snowy day but nothing beats an All American with bacon and french fries.  Plus, they have a really yummy wine list, intimate seating, live music and good service.  This is mine & my boyfriend's spot, its our happy place, it should be your happy place too!",,,
30,Kelly K.,"Parsippany, NJ",261,177,175,4.0,6/27/2016,"Before even sitting down for my meal I fell in love with the outdoor ambience, the cute little park across the street, and the fact that it was inconspicuously located off a quiet side street away from the hustle and bustle of Washington. It was ideal for enjoying a quiet meal outside whilst people watching. Sidenote- they are dog friendly! Several patrons had their pups beside them at the tables, and the server even brought out water for them, I appreciated that.Their beer menu is a little lacking. They had a longer list of bottles but on tap they only had a handful. Nevertheless I tried an IPA recommended  by the server and I loved it so I was happy. For food the loaded nachos were great, nothing unique or more special than your standard nachos but they were cooked and prepared perfectly (not soggy, cheese melted, all the accoutrements included) so again, I was very satisfied. For my main I got the veggie burger with sautéed mushrooms and onions which was served on a baguette with fries. Although the bread was nice I would have preferred a regular burger bun. Somehow it didn't compliment it very well to me, also the burger itself was dry and lacked seasoning. I suspected it was once a frozen patty, but still it wasn't the worst I've ever had. My boyfriend had a massive burger which was awesome. I would suggest ordering a burger as they have a wide selection on their menu and they are massive!I would definitely return to try out some other options on their menu.

She brought us bread and took drink orders. The Dogfish 90 IPA on draft was amazing and a perfect temperature. I ordered the pasta special. Needless to say nothing was left on my plate! Would have gotten 5 stars however the shrimp that was added in the pasta was extremely overdone. Chewy consistency.. However everything else was outstanding. For appetizers I recommend the calamari.

I had their Cajun chicken sandwich but my chicken was pounded to paper thin size, so unfortunately I felt like I was getting jipped  from the price. Also it uses the wrong type of bread..it was served on a fairly tough baguette, I think it would taste better if it was on a roll. The flavor combo is very good though still! I've sat inside where the staff was great, but when sitting outside it seems like service slowed quick a bit. There were times I'm pretty sure my waitress forgot about us, I had to go inside to ask for the check. Otherwise, this is a great spot if you're feeling like chomping down a burger!",,,

I split the Alps burger and the Ragin' Cajun burger with a friend, and while it tasted fine and reasonably well prepared, I found the patties to lack any distinctive flavor. I preferred the Ragin' Cajun between the two, but that might have been due to the remoulade and the texture from the crispy onions and not because of any different flavors due to the ingredients. The meal overall was fine and not very expensive, but probably not a place I'd go out of my way to come back to.",2,1,1

But they were overall very friendly and told us we had about a 45 min wait and he was about accurate with the wait time. The layout is nice in that the bar was in the front where it was a lot noisier but in the dining area it was a little quieter, still lots of noise but better than the bar area. Once seated, the service was really slow; about 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our order, again perhaps due to the rush hour? I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt. As for the food it also took a while to come out but it was delicious so worth the wait! I love my burger; asked for medium rare and they cooked it just right. The sauce and the lettuce and tomato all came on the side so you can add it as desired.   The penne pasta and nachos-no words! Absolutely delicious, never had simple pasta tasted so good. We ordered a second plate. Despite the long waiting time to get seated and the wait time for service and arrival of food I will try to come back at a more random time in hopes of a faster service just for the food.

This week I went for dinner and while the food was ok, it was nothing special.Aside from the food not being good, it is overpriced too. This week the waitress was just rude. Not at all friendly and openly annoyed that she had to work. It was a nice night out, but we were unable to get outdoor seating. That's understandable because the area outside is very small. All in all, it was an ok meal in an ok restaurant with less than ok service. I've tried, but I won't be going back again.",2,,

42,Michael K.,"New York, NY",1,6,0,2.0,7/22/2017,"Went to Onieals for an early Saturday night dinner. The air conditioning didn't appear to be working properly, as the restaurant temperature had to be nearly 80 degrees. Ordered two cocktails that were very strong, but lacked any semblance of flavor. Ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. What came wasn't buffalo sauce and blue cheese on a hearty breaded chicken cutlet like I was expecting, but rather a paper thin slice of grilled chicken. Asked for the check, the server puts it on the table. No ""thank yous"", no ""see you next time"" nothing. You don't have to be a Michelin starred restaurant to get the basics right. There's too many other spots in the area to give this place a chance.",1,,

My mom and I came in the afternoon and sat outside and it was nice being right across the street from a park. Our waitress was so sweet and was doing a really great job taking care of everyone considering she was the only waitress working at the time. I ordered rotini bolognese instead of spaghetti bolognese and it was absolutely delicious...like I'm still not over how much I loved it. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the bolognese had such a generous amount of meat in it. I'm a big eater and I thought the portion was huge. I almost didn't finish but I managed to eat every last bit of it because it was that good...and only $13. My mom ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it. She was able to substitute a salad for the fries that normally come with the sandwich. I am already dying to go back here.,,,

They have so many good Bloody Mary and mimosa options. I got the Dirty Mary which has olive juice and blue cheese stuffed olives and then I got the Manmosa which has citrus vodka in it. Both were great! I got the church square sandwich to eat and it was amazing. It was turkey, cheese, Russian dressing and avocado spread on toasted rye bread.

The wait time and service depends greatly on the time you go - I think this place is great for happy hour on a weeknight. On a weekend it becomes your typical packed bar, with pretty long waits for drinks and limited seating. The beer menu is extensive, and the wine list has enough options that I just had them make recommendations. They've got TVs if you want to watch sports, and I feel like the fact that Onieals is a few blocks off Washington lends itself to an older, calmer crowd.The food was great - a few of us got the NY strip, which was perfectly cooked with a great sauce, and some other friends had the burgers which were also on point. We shared a bottle of wine and split the tab, and they had no problem running multiple cards.I'd love to come back here during the summer to check out the outside seating.",1,,

It's a simple bar with the class. Decent beers on draft and very friendly service. I had the steak sandwich but ordered a salad on the side. I was brought fries but didn't correct them. The steak sandwich was good but the. Read was a little hard and the steak was slightly chewy. This was bound to happen when steak sandwiches aren't made with steak ums and cheese whiz but it is what it is. Not a bad option and if the weather is good they've got outdoor seating.,,,

61,Abhi J.,"New York, NY",0,44,19,2.0,6/14/2017,"Visited Onieals on Sunday after going through the mostly good reviews on Yelp. Visited along with my wife for brunch. We received a cold, distant welcome from the guy who greeted us as they had a table available but not enough chairs (we were 2!). The lady who took our order was really nice and took our drink, food order. Now comes the underwhelming part. We order a ""Manmosa"" (Onieals version of a Mimosa) & a ""Knot your Coffee (their version of the ol' Irish Coffee). Both the drinks were equally disappointing. While the ""Manmosa"" was a heavily watered down Mimosa served in a mug (probably a beer mug), while the Irish Coffee was served in a wine glass with a clear section of coffee and a floating layer of alcohol. While we sipped on the disappointing drinks, we were informed that the food will be further delayed, since the kitchen was backlogged. This was surprising since the place was less than 60% filled at that point. However, after another 40minute wait, we received the food. The french toast which my wife ordered was as described and good. However the bread on my chicken sandwich was too hard, I could barely bite into it. At one point, the insides of my mouth hurt while I tried to chew on the bread. I didn't want to give 1 star, since the waitress were sweet, apologetic about delays and the french toast was good.",2,,

The vibe is calmer and chilled. There's plenty of tv screens for your viewing pleasures. The staff is friendly and attentive. I ordered the Cajun halibut on a bed of salad. This isn't on the menu but thanks to a yelper I knew they had to have some sort of a fish special on the menu. The portion was beyond generous and it was soooooo good. I complemented the meal with a nice reisling and was fully satisfied.          I highly recommend this place as they do not disappoint.",,,

The menu is pretty standard New American, but it's all done right. The beer menu doesn't shift too often, but it's full of good choices. The out door seating is on two sides of the block, meaning you can generally get a seat with the right amount of sun and wind exposure. Their dinning room is in the back and is a pleasant, quiet escape from the bar. Wednesday night is their $5 glasses of wine happy hour. It's worth checking out. The Glen Carlou is a great deal at only $5 and a must try. I love their Penne Vodka and French Onion soup.",,,

Anyways try the fried picks here they most certainly do not blow. If they blow anything it's my ballz - off that is. I saw a bloke drinking his beer by cupping his hands and having his wife (yes she was hot) pour it in his hands and lick it out like a cat - lucky guy. I had a pound of wings and damn near broke the bar stool lol at least they were free! They said they're making a special reinforced stool for my fat Irish arse with a sign saying ""reserved for Big Bird"". Yes I resemble a large bird...at least I still get laid!!! (I don't really).

Beware, the portions are pretty huge!  Service was good minus the hostess: they don't take reservations so our friends went early to wait for a table for the 4 of us. They waited 30 minutes when a table came available. Our friends explained we were a 3 minute walk from the restaurant but she would not give them the table since the 4 of us weren't there.

Onieals is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Whether it's for brunch, lunch, drinks and apps (wine night Wednesday!) or dinner, Onieals never fails to disappoint. The food is always delicious and drinks are generally on point too. I'm not a huge fan of their bloodies, but they serve manmosa's (the oh so delicious marriage of OJ, vodka and blue moon) so it's not an issue for me.Recently, I celebrated a monumental occasion at Onieals. I've been a fleeting vegetarian (fish eater on and off for the last few years) for eleven years (!) and when I decided to rejoin the world of the burger eaters, Onieals is where I choose to enjoy my first. This was no small decision - both Minetta tavern and Bar Boulud were in the running - but it was unequivocally the right one. As many reviewers have stated before me, the burgers at Onieals are AMAZING! My current favorite is the Californian with cheddar instead of swiss, but I've been steadily making my way through their impressive list.

I then went to pay my bill and tipped as I knew they would be closing soon due to Hoboken bars closing at 2am then went to the restroom. I then came back and my wine I just paid for 2 min earlier was gone and when I inquired upon the bartender with the short blonde hair (the one that literally just served me the drink), she was turned around and literally Said ""earmuffs"" as in ""I don't purposely hear you"". Now, I was not by any means rude nor intoxicated but just literally paid for a drink AND tipped bartender then given cold shoulder cause the clock just stroke 2am. Now I have lived in Hoboken and bartended in Hoboken for 11 years and would never want to negatively peg a bartender but I was just simply shocked. I would never just randomly toss a customer's beverage and then purposely act ignorant to their cause immediately after, just the most insulting customer service I could think of. It is shocking and rude and more importantly scandalous as she took my generous tip and then dumped out my drink seconds later while happily collecting her nice tip. This bartender closing late Wednesday evening certainly ruined my otherwise great night but most importantly  ensured I will never step foot in this scam place ever again. Stay away as long as you can especially with the bartender on Wednesday with the short blonde hair who will rip you off of your money and laugh at you at all costs. Going home extremely upset after an otherwise great night. Thanks Onieals for single-handedly ruining this evening",,,

I went for the first time out of convenience but the second, third, fourth, etc. were because it is just so great.The wait staff here is really awesome, even when you're sitting outside (which is more often than not).I've probably eaten half the menu and I can tell you everything is a great portion size, great quality, and just overall great. You have to try their fried mozzarella because it is super fresh and comes with homemade tomato sauce which is to die for. Oh, and the brunch/Bloody Mary menu is THE BOMB.",,,
90,Emily A.,"Hoboken, NJ",195,27,2,4.0,4/22/2015,This bar is great for a casual night with friends or maybe a casual first date.They have some nice specials - $5 martinis on Tuesdays and $5 glasses of wine on Wednesdays.The burgers are really good and easily customizable to exactly what you're craving - they have a ton of topping options.I've tried the buffalo shrimp which were also delicious - and the crabcake sandwich for lunch which was mediocre (would not order again).,1,1,

Updated review",Also you must try their nachos...we get without beef or chicken. It's baked perfectly with fresh tomato and cheese and olives and piled high with sour cream and guac....getting hungry just thinking of this. Big portion size and delicious comfort food to share over a beer or cocktail. Yummy!! It's incredible how fast that tall pile disappears because it's so good!!.,,,

Although there were three of us just going out to dinner I can definitely say this would be a great date night spot and the food is good too.The bar area is nice to drink while you're waiting to be seated. I know people rave about the burgers but i decided a burger was not for me, especially since I'm not a huge burger person - they're always so awkwardly big for me haha. Neither one of us got a burger actually. I ordered the penne vodka with recommendations from the waiter and I was SO happy that I did. It was delicious and I was so happy to save some for home. I would definitely go here again eventually, but I think I would try and stop at some other places before I went back here. It was good but it did 'wow me' to the point where I neeeeeeed to go back right away.",,,

My wife just went there tonight to have dinner with her friends. She was waiting for a table for quite awhile. She offered the people at this one table who had clearly finished their dinner and were just having drinks if she could have their table and she would gladly buy them a drink if she could have their table.All parties agreed but the server was not happy with this arrangement.My wife informed the waitress that she just had gone undergone breast cancer surgery and the people at the table were more than agreeable to give up the table.What really did it in was when the waitress said ""Good for you and breast cancer"".Really? Sorry Onieals, I really enjoyed your food, but when you have people working for you like that, my family and I are not coming back.",4,,

98,Kirsten H.,"Denver, CO",169,910,757,4.0,5/9/2015,"Probably my favorite burger place around. It gets pretty busy around dinnertime but is worth the wait for a casual, consistently great bite to eat. The Wall Streeter burger (bacon, cheddar, sautéed onions) is a personal favorite. If you like crispy fries, you'll love these! Service is quick but I've never felt rushed. I recently visited here with some friends from Germany and they loved the place-they felt like it was a true American bar and they happily chowed down on their burgers.",,,

All three have been good.The bar is small and intimate. Perfect for a down the street from your doorstep kinda of place. Bartenders are alert and a napkin on a pint still saves your seat here.Brunch is amazing. I can't get  over how good the turkey sandwich with avocado was. Became my favorite turkey sandwich in Hoboken. Perfect mix of turkey, pickles, mayo, avocado,  and toasted rye.Pasta for dinner here has always been good. Nothing over cooked coming out of this kitchen. Also the staff here is very friendly. They have always been kind to requests and don't mind making sure your happy. Always a great spot to stop off at while doing the rounds around Hoboken on a Friday or Saturday night.",3,,1

I enjoyed it. They have outdoor seating when it's nice out and inside they have a bar area with TVs and a nicer dining area. I also didn't realize they have a location in SoHo.Last time I dined in, the waitress must have forgotten to place our order because it didn't come out for at least 45 minutes to an hour.

It's a little cramped inside, which is a bit of a negative - so on the packed weekend nights of Hoboken (which is every weekend), this MAY not be your go-to if you want some space to breathe. Service wasn't bad: prompt and checked up on my wife and I with our drinks. The seating inside is sparce, so if you don't grab one of the few seats on the perimeter of the space, you'll be standing and moving around. The usual suspects on tap when we went: Guinness, Dogfish Head, Allagash White, Peroni, etc - nothing interesting or that made me look twice.",,,
102,Dave L.,"Hoboken, NJ",3,9,0,4.0,2/15/2015,"Neighborhood favorite. Pros: food is pretty good, but I'd stick with the basics, like the burgers and appetizers.  Staff is attentive and friendly. Music and ambiance is very goodCons: beer list could be better. Wait time for food can be long. Overall: I'd probably give them 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll bump it up to a 4.

103,Joe H.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,63,22,1.0,2/26/2016,"I was really excited about trying this place. I have been in Hoboken for about 5 years and had always heard great things about Onieals particularly the burgers.  So my girlfriend and I finally decided to try it.  I would have to say it was one of the worst burgers I have had in Hoboken, JC and NY.  The reviews were so positive and even recommended to my by a co-worker but I would never return here. The place is smaller and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The staff was nice as well as the bar/restaurant area. We ordered the spicy pasta as an appetizer which was al dente close to raw. It was under cooked by I would say at least 3 minutes.  The sauce itself was actually very flavorful but under cooked pasta ruined the dish. For our burgers I ordered the Wallstreeter and my girlfriend ordered the Californian burger.  Both tasted of nothing but a big ball of grease.  The fries were decent but still extremely greasy.  The burgers had no taste other than oil.  Extremely disappointing and on the verge of inevitable.  We actually went to Cabana afterwards for dinner because we were still hungry. I am confused by all of the great reviews here. I'm convinced that since people have to wait a long amount of time, they spend that time at the bar.  By the time the food arrives, they are in a different state of mind.  This is the only conclusion I can come to because the food here is an embarrassment.  Would not recommend and definitely would not return.",1,,

Our meal took a bit long to come out, but it was good. I got the penne vodka and my boyfriend got the hammered chicken. My dish was just ok-- there was a weird zing to the taste and it had sundried tomatoes which are not my favorite, but it was creamy. The hammered chicken was like chicken francese with spinach and rice and was delicious. He said the rice was ok. It was a nice atmosphere, just a little bu loud from the bar.

I asked the woman bartender if they could lower the music. It was literally her myself and one of her friends at the bar.

Bartender did not even acknowledge us. Finally server came by, we said we would like to sit outside. There was nobody at all here eating, just us. Got our menus. Decided pretty quick 2 burgers and a veggie burger. Food was ok, not great. Burgers were cooked to a delicious medium rare.

117,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,582,505,4.0,1/10/2013,"My 2 friends and I met up for the Wednesday $5 wine happy hour, each with 3 very different 2013 goals: to start going out more, to meet a new guy, and (my goal) to forget about currently being swamped at my job. At any rate, O'Nieal's fit the bill.I arrived first around 6:30pm, and it was very quiet, not crowded, and full of middle-aged people. Not much talent in the men department for my friend. I was worried that my Yelp research had steered me wrong, and started thinking about the escape hatch to Washington St. However, as time went by, a band started playing 90's covers, the place filled up, and by the time my friend arrived, it was lively and had some possible boy-o's among the local crowd.So the $5 wine special (all night) is amazing, and they have Pinot Grigio, Sauv Blanc, Riesling, Chardonnay, and Torrontes as white choices. We also split some nachos and a quesadilla at the bar. I was really impressed with the nice fresh garlicky guacamole, and the food was solid bar food in general. It's about a 10 minute walk to the PATH train, which is a good distance to start walking off said bar food. I hope I'll be back soon as we continue to try as a group to achieve our individual goals for 2013. Cause ya gotta have goals, kiddo's.",,1,

OF COURSE the moment we arrived they had been slammed 5 minutes earlier so we had a wait.  Not terrible.  We grabbed a bloody mary from the nice bartender... She was not gross.  The drink was.  I forgot to request shelf vodka and got shitty rail stuff which wouldn't have been so terrible but the mix was terrible too.  I also hate when I have to request a lemon and olives in a bloody- they are a standard.  We got a nice little unstable table in the corner of the dining area and the waitress was there within seconds before we got to read the menu.  She had to run back and check the soup of the day and when she got back a minute or two later we ordered an appetizer but wanted a few to decide on lunch.  Ten minutes later she came back to get our lunch order and another 5 passed before the app came.  We had all ordered soup and waited another 10 minutes for that.  When our food came... it was average at best.  The burgers looked good and juicy.  The salad was really nothing special and the turkey club was lunch meat turkey which was disappointing as my dad was hoping for carved turkey.  We were really hungry when we arrived and really left nothing on the plates.  I wasn't upset about the wait for the table, the wait for the ordering the wait for the food or even the fact that we had to go to the bar to get our check and never saw our waitress again until we were walking out the door; but, it was a lot of time for anyone in a hurry this wouldn't be a good choice!!  I'm not high maintenance but I know there's too many excellent places around to settle for good places in terms of food AND service.  Average doesn't get second visits.",1,,

""Is this real life?"" we all wondered.  We all were extremely disgusted, disturbed, appalled, stunned - I can't even think of all of the words to explain how we felt.  We were excited for our friend who just finished chemo one month ago, and to hear that the waitress DOUBTED something like that is beyond words.  How rude, insensitive, and sick of this human being.  We all got up and left the restaurant.  When the (woman we soon after found out was) manager saw us get up and leave our table, bottle of champagne poured and all, she gave our group the middle finger (on both hands, might I add) and called us c*nts as we stormed out of the restaurant. I went back in to ask for the name of the waitress, and nobody that worked there would give it to me.  I then spoke to the manager who defended her waitress, saying that people come in there and say things all the time so it's hard to believe people.  Why, in a million years, would anyone lie about CANCER? What would we gain by saying that someone went through one of the most gruesome things in the world?I cannot believe that 1. people like the waitress (and manager) exist, and 2. the manager at this establishment was not more sensitive to the situation.  She didn't care that the feelings of my friend (and the rest of us) were beyond hurt considering she spent the last 7 months undergoing chemotherapy; she didn't care that her waitress forced 4 customers out of the restaurant in a fury; she did not care about anything - not even the reputation of the establishment that she is ""managing.""Neither of these (monstrous & despicable) women have clearly ever had a loved one go through something like cancer.  I have never been so horrified and appalled in my life as I was with these women.I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone.",4,,

137,Maeve C.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,331,2,4.0,11/10/2013,"Onieals is a nice spot in Hoboken, safely tucked away from the main drag of Washington St.  I happily ambled over to Park Ave and waited for my dining companions in the pleasant bar area, taking in the scene.  Families, friends in their upper 20s and low 30s, and a few dudes just there to watch the games on the TVs over the bar.  Once we sat down, I ordered a bloody mary and was impressed with the full, balanced flavor.  Not too spicy, not too celery-y(?), and a good saltiness.  Amanda J. was less happy with her ""Manmosa""--which is a pint glass full of mimosa, served over ice.  So basically, it's a lot of ice, and not a lot of mimosa.  For food, I went with the eggs benedict and was happy with my runny eggs, homemade hollandaise, and tasty homefries.  My only complaint was that I was still a bit hungry after finishing, so maybe a side of mixed greens would help round out the plate.  Amanda J. got the eggs Sardeaux, which is essentially eggs benedict but with spinach and artichoke hearts instead of canadian bacon.  Honestly, that seemed like the way to go because I would have actually gotten some nutrients along with all the creamy deliciousness of poached eggs and hollandaise.  Amanda J.'s bf got the Church Square - a turkey sandwich with guacamole, cheese, and Russian dressing - which looked really good as well.  Next time I'm here I will either get a burger or the Irish breakfast, but I know I will be hitting that bloody mary up again!",2,,2

They have a full bar with a few tv's. the space is pretty tiny and it was crowded so it felt cramped. The bar was busy but they had only one poor girl slinging mimosas and blood Mary's for all the thirsty Hoboken 20 something's.  She definitely needed some help judging by the amount of dirty glasses piled up at one end if the bar. She was doing her best but I had to wait a bit to finally catch her eye and order a drink.  2 bloody Mary's at almost 8 dollars a pop not really worth it in my opinion.  The host stand is toward the back of the bar room and we put our name down to get a table.  Their is only 2 seats to wait for a table so say a little prayer before you step inside in hopes you don't have to wait.  The seating area is tiny but not cramped.  The pictures that line the wall are very cool.  Photographs of different celebrities in strange poses and making odd faces adds a nice appeal.  The brunch menu has a breakfast section and a sandwich/burger section.  I was happy with my Cajun chicken sandwich, I just wish they would have used real guacamole instead of something out of a package.  Otherwise the food was flavorful and those with me all enjoyed their eggs.  Food prices were decent for the quality.  With all of the brunch establishments in Hoboken you should shop around and find which one you like best.  Onieals is certainly tasty but not my fav.",1,1,2

Mostly for dinner or lunch but a couple times for brunch. The food is decent here, the burgers are pretty great and the fries are good. Their other sandwiches are kind of hit or miss. I've had a variety, but if you eat here choose any of the burgers if going for a sandwich.Brunch was kind of meh nothing to write home about, I'd rather go to Anthony Davids, Elysian Cafe or La Isla. But it's close and has outdoor seating.Dinner service again is hit or miss. Last time we went, on a Monday evening. They wouldn't sit me until my fiance arrived, the place was literally empty in the back room and unless they expected a hoard of two tops to walk in in the next 10 minutes, customer service wise I should have grabbed a table. Especially while the three hosts sat there texting. Fine, you have policies, I get it. This last time we went because it was close and we didn't want to make a night of going out to eat. We were there for an hour and a half and we weren't drinking. The ticket time for a buffalo chicken salad and a turkey sandwich was over 40 minutes. We actually were about to leave when the food finally came. Our waitress never apologized, never explained what was going on and never checked in. I could tell she knew it was taking too long but she avoided it. I didn't want free food but an apology for taking 40 minutes would have been nice. It was obvious my fiance's sandwich had died under the heat lamp the fries were hard as rocks and the sandwich was too. My salad was just ok as well, not worth waiting for 40 minutes.They never really have specials to speak of unless you sit at the bar, which is tiny about 10 stools. Most places will extend happy hour to other seats especially outdoor seating, but they don't.The outdoor seating is pleasant right next to church square. It's worth a try and the occasional stop in for a pretty good burger and fries. But a lot of times it takes forever service wise and that drives me nuts.",,1,
193,Frank B.,"New York, NY",30,72,46,4.0,1/6/2013,"From the outside it's nothing to look at, but this Hoboken spot is definitely worth checking out.  As you walk in to Onieals (a funny way to spell it if you ask me-I couldn't look it up at first because I was using the traditional spelling) you'll see what amounts to an old style drinking bar with lots of wood and charm.  There are bar tables in the front and regular dining tables in the rear.  You might think the food is so so, but it is not.The food is very good! With a varied burger and sandwich selection, a nice assortment of salads and some good ole standard appetizers.  There's a brunch menu as well as a regular lunch/dinner menu.  I had the chicken pesto pita with hummus and fried mozzarella as an appetizer, and a bloody mary.  My dish was on the small size but by no means was the taste small; it was delicious!  The burgers looked great and I was told by my family that they were equally big on taste.  A must see place if you ever go to Hoboken.",,,
194,Blue L.,"New York, NY",4,108,0,2.0,3/9/2013,"I feel gastronomically violated...yet I blame myself for picking this place for dinner based on the 4 star Yelp reviews:(I should have noticed that all the good reviews here are for beer and burgers, but not for ANYTHING ELSE. I was unlucky enough to be one of the customers who got ""something else."" We dropped by because my husband was craving burgers, and were immediately seated. FOURTY FIVE minutes later, we were actually served food. How is that acceptable? We just got two entrees (one of which was a salad) and an app. The waitress was nice, but after coming in to check on us asking ""how is everything,"" it got hard not to sarcastically reply, ""you mean our water and table bread? it's phenomenal....""On to the food. Our mozzarella sticks which were served ON a plate of marinara sauce. I had never seen fried food served ON a bed of liquid sauce before. They usually come separate. Needless to say, after a few minutes, the batter was soggy from soaking in sauce for 10 minutes. But that didn't even matter, because the mozzarella itself tasted like FREEZER BURN. It was clearly frozen for way too long, and the after taste was disgusting. But, to avoid being a diva, we sucked it up and didn't say anything. Then, after another eternity, our food finally came. The burger was decent - no complaints there, but my salad was beyond disgusting. It was a densely packed bed of salad leaves with balsamic dressing the consistency of lard. I mean, it looked like jelly instead of creamy dressing. I really could have had a better experience eating Wendy's one dollar side salads. i ate one bite and just could not go on.Anyway, i guess you could argue that this is a bar, and you can't expect a good salad. To their credit, i did mention that the burger was decent. BUT, if you can't get fried cheese right, and your salad makes me gag, I think you need to re-assess the menu and stick to what you do best - burgers and fries - rather than put people through a painfully long wait time and gross appetizers for a thundering disappointment when the entree comes. People - come here for drinks and fries. BUT NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE.",,,
195,Hillary S.,"Saco, ME",35,28,2,1.0,5/16/2014,Tried the burgers because of all of the positive reviews. They were so greasy we couldn't even finish them. Would not return.,1,,
196,Richard H.,"Somerville, NJ",52,111,1,4.0,1/11/2013,"No question, the best burger menu in Hoboken!Also a great bar staff, and solid beer list (including gluten free!).Try the Spivy Burger!",,,
197,Ben D.,"Springfield Township, NJ",0,7,0,5.0,3/17/2016,Great atmosphere! The chicken Montrachet might be my favorite meal in all of hoboken. I highly recommend this place to everyone,,,
198,Ricky R.,"Hoboken, NJ",297,13,11,3.0,2/15/2015,"The food is acceptable. The staff should be retrained in professionalism. I was disgusted by some backhanded comments made toward a family with a child walking around, and towards a few of my guests, asking about reservations and drink specials. Service is important to me, which is why I will not be returning to this location.",,,
199,Dana S.,"Hoboken, NJ",15,115,12,5.0,5/3/2014,great place all around.
