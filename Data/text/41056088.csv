0,,9/17/2018,0,,"Miami, FL",Jaquelyn M.,3,5.0,2,"BUA.... sweet, sweet Bua. How can I possibly begin to describe the love I have for this chicken sandwich? Ok, I'll try... This is the BEST fried chicken sandwich I've had in my entire life. Perfectly toasted Texas toast slathered with a DELICIOUS, spicy, creamy sauce mixed in with their special coleslaw on top a BIG, sexual piece of fried chicken topped with some more saucy slaw & pickles.... wow. I know it may seem strange to refer to a chicken sandwich as sexual but I, my friend, am not a liar. Aside from having a Life changing sandwich, Bua has a great vibe. Cool bar, good music (usually good Oldschool hip hop/90s rock. Walls are made of stone & it's pretty dark with nice lighting. Gets crowded at night but fun nonetheless. I  BUA !",
1,,7/25/2018,5,,"Manhattan, NY",Michael C.,0,4.0,5,"Got scammed by the bartender.On Tuesday (July 24, 2018) night, I was on my way home from the gym and decided to stop by BUA for a drink. I got an IPA which cost $7, and handed the bartender a $20. The changes he gave me included a $10 bill that had a big corner missing. So I asked him for a different change. He insisted that the bill was usable. I was tired from my workout and didn't press him. Big mistake. Today I tried using this $10 bill at a grocery store. The cashier there told me that he couldn't take it because the serial number was chopped off. So when I finished my gym workout I stopped by BUA again to resolve this mess. The bartender on duty tonight (Wednesday) was a different person and (rightly) refused to change it for me. Now I have to come back again to speak with the original bartender who gave me this bad change or the management. This is super irresponsible on the part of the bartender who was working on Tuesday night.I'm really pissed off by the inconvenience caused by the irresponsible person.UPDATE: The management reached out to me shortly after my review was posted and asked me to stop by so that they could rectify the problem. I did stop by today. The bartender on duty (a different guy) immediately took care of the problem after I explained to him what happened. Kudos to them. Hence I upgraded my review to 4 stars since I used to frequent BUA and liked the bar.",2

I ordered the red lemonade with your option of either gin or vodka. I opted into the option with gin and it was great! This drink had a hint of lemon and pomegranates. This place have a very romantic vibe as well with candles lit up around the whole entire bar. Just a heads up, the bathroom doors are a little heavy and harder to open compared to most bathroom doors.",1

5,2,2/8/2018,409,,"New York, NY",Willson P.,1274,4.0,159,Bua is a perfect place to be tour regular go to bar with some nice food in it . Located in saint marks place in eat village that makes it very comfortable and convenience for the people. East village is already a night fun palace like everybody knows The happy hour last long 3pm to 8 pm. This is the longest happy hour I have seen sofar in New York City   Just because of this last long happy hour place should be your go to place. Like regular :) well Saturday no happy hours.Variety of drinks and some good food is great to have with sure cheaper price by happy hour makes it very special . Definitely a place must be visit.,3

Service is always great and there is some small plates to share. I wouldn't recommend going here if you want a meal- there is limited items on the menu, but good for some finger food!",

It was live inside - a good amount of people and loud techno-ish music playing. Not my fave, but there were two open seats at the bar as soon as we walked in, so we took this as a sign from the universe and grabbed them quickly.Drinks were not the cheapest, but this is a NY standard right? Our bartender was kind of my favorite part of the night though - I regrettably don't remember his name. James perhaps? He told us they had Jaeger, but sadly, no bombs. And then he came back 3 minutes later to tell us that he had 2 red bulls that he brought in for himself that he would let us have! Customer service at its finest, we happily took both. (What's a brother sister vacay without Jaegerbombs?) We then asked him for a rum and coke - heavy on the rum - and he gave us two glasses filled just about 95% with rum. I had to ask for a glass of OJ on the side for a shooter. Expensive yes, but (maybe) James made sure we got our money's worth.I understand everything I described above makes me sound a little bit like an alcoholic, but if you're coming to a bar and your sole purpose is to drink, then Bua will not disappoint. Come in and ask for James! If no one there is named that, look for the awesome guy behind the bar with the accent.",4

Great bartenders, delicious friend pickles, all around great bar.

Simple decor, inexpensive meals on offer, a variety of great American beers on tap and the bartenders make a decent strength cocktail. Had a really nice time here. Laid back atmosphere, cozy seating (we were lucky to get a table as it got really crowded later). If you are looking for a relaxing place to grab a cold or spicy one hit up Bua.",
11,,9/6/2018,0,,United Kingdom,Imo T.,0,3.0,1,"It was a fantastic place to go for some drinks, the bar tender was fantastic and the drinks were really good! My only issue was that a man kept standing extremely close to us, no matter where we sat, so we decided to go outside and as we were stood in the door way the bouncer asked us to move, we explained to him why we were stood there and he said 'don't worry about him, he's harmless.' This just made us feel more uncomfortable as we knew that there was nothing else we could do. We decided to sit outside, and the man was stood less than a foot a way from us in the door way, again, staring. The bouncer asked several other people who were also in the door way to move and not this man. It was extremely clear that me and my friend felt extremely uncomfortable and nothing was done about it. For a great place, I did not expect that kind of service and dismissal.",1

Had it bookmarked for a while, but was disappointed to see the ""B"" rating on the window. Knowing we were only going to get drinks, we went in. The place was crowded for an early Saturday evening, but there was still enough breathing room. The bar tender was sweet, helpful, and patient. My lemonade-inspired cocktail was delicious! Would definitely come back for drinks!",2
13,,9/16/2018,215,,"Pacifica, CA",Dave S.,0,5.0,94,A perfect place to spend a warm summer evening having a well-made cocktail and watch the world go by. Very friendly staff and just a nice atmosphere.,
14,2,4/13/2017,147,1,"West Babylon, NY",Juhi G.,413,3.0,136,This is just a normal bar and very average. I came here for happy hour and we ordered the happy hour drinks - there was only one good drink on the menu. The strawberry crush was DELICIOUS!!! All of the other ones were whatever. We got fries pickles and they were also not very good. Usually fried pickles are slices? Well these were fried pickle chunks? All of the pickle juice would drip out when taking a bite. It was super messy. I wish I got the fries instead. The only reason i gave this place three stars is because the drink was amazing and the bartender was super nice and friendly,4
15,1,4/16/2018,0,5,"Los Angeles, CA",Lennie M.,0,1.0,5,"Dear fellow New Yorker,BUA previously Sin-É, where Jeff BUCKLEY used to perform and where he also recorded his Famous EP "" live @ Sin-É "". BUA has decided to honor Jeff's memory hanging his picture in the RESTROOM Area where people pee, poop & piuck when drunk. I came to BUA for a visit and was chocked to witness the way BUA chose to honor or should I say dishonor Jeff's memory. I cordially did let them know about that. Because they have no respect, as we could witness, BUA chose to solve the problem by REMOVING Jeff's picture. I did ask updates on & on, they ignore my messages. That is How Much BUA care about the East Village's LEGACY..  Acoustic music sessions took place @ Sin-É in a spontaneous and creative atmosphere. Patrons included emerging writers, photographers, artists, designers and musicians. Later, as a more established venue, performers played for tips.Seasoned performers such as Sinéad O'Connor, Jeff Buckley, Marianne Faithfull, Shane MacGowan, Hothouse Flowers, The Waterboys, Allen Ginsberg, Star Drooker, and the band Native Tongue also appeared at Sin-é, giving impromptu performances.New York history is vanishing cause of people like BUA Crew who manifest such a poor consideration towards places that used to carry a SOUL. BUA, if you take over Sin-É, HONOR this PLACE, don't Baffle it. Don't turn it into a random Burger place. Soulful Artists shared some of their Essence. Remember this.",
16,,7/30/2018,158,,"Granby, CT",Maribeth S.,0,4.0,7,Bua is an excellent social spot for a bite to eat. Tasty drinks and great small plates. The tacos and fried pickles are top notch. Taking one star down for the grumpy bartender.,1
17,1,4/6/2018,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Tito V.,9,5.0,20,"Stopped by this solid establishment with a friend during happy hour. Our waitress, Andee, was very pleasant and super attentive throughout the night(even after the place filled up with people).Ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries. The sandwich was tasty and the fries were great too. Everything is well priced for the area. My only suggestion is for them to include jalapeños with their smoked and spicy margarita. It wasn't spicy enough. Had a really great time here and will definitely be returning.",

It's def a hot spot in the area, but it lives up to the hype! They source their ingredients from local farms and other local sources. This place gets packed to the gills pretty fast, but there is also rotating drones of ppl, so it's easy enough to find a table or seat if you wait a bit. Drinks are great and decently priced. The staff is super nice and attentive! This place is great if you just want to grab a few drinks, listen to the greatest old-School hip-hop and pop, and get some decent and tasty above-average American bar food.",2

They offer a selection of beers for $4 and select cocktails at a discount. The selections are good and the discount is fair. I appreciate the quality of their cocktails in addition to the length of the HH! Their food looks delicious, but I have no tried it. My boyfriend really likes the Grilled Cheese, which comes with a spicy mustard. Recommend for small groups, especially at peak times. Nice atmosphere as well, good bartenders.",2

As a Midwesterner from Wisconsin, I'd say Bua did an amazing job bringing the curds to the east coast. Definitely give it a try if you're a cheese enthusiast and don't know what cheese curds are!",
22,,12/1/2017,343,,"New York, NY",Erin R.,65,4.0,126,A great go to happy hour spot (right across the street from 10 degrees if its too crowded there or vice versa). Love it in the summer when the front windows are open. Its still a good go-to spot in the winter but can get a little cramped during prime hours. I always enjoy the Paloma.,1

25,13,7/23/2016,5000,9,"New York, NY",Scott L.,4006,4.0,2295,"When my friends planned a happy hour at a place called Bua, I didn't like the name.  Plus they only had bar food and I needed a meal.  Coming from friends who are bar regulars at One on One (they do sit outside though.), I wasn't expecting much.I was actually shocked at how cute Bua was, with its wooded Portland Oregon Pub interior, and bar menu that looked enticing.  The place had a certain non urban newer hominess about it, sans a few NYC denizen behaviours - A. 2 separate people with laptops each occupying the entire 4 top patio tables, with not an ounce of guilt, andB. 3 young woman holding a banal conversation at mega plus decibels that was impossible not to be immersed in.  The sound of their voices were so loud it hurt. Well, cie la vie right?   Live and let live I suppose.  Although eventually they left, and the bright light shone - $15 wine carafes for happy hour.  I picked the Côte de Rhone, was I dreaming ?  Perhaps, it was sunny, and I got a table by the open air patio window.When the bartender asked me if I only wanted one glass for the carafe the idea of needing two glasses for the carafe was a concept I couldn't grasp.  ""Just the carafe"".  I responded out of synch.I ordered the brussel sprout salad, which actually tasted healthy, although id be more inclined to call it a kale salad with grilled brussel sprouts.  And it's only $9.  (That's two cokes at the MOMA cafe or 4 single razors at a LES bodega.). The salad was fresh and delightful with sliced apples.  Man I went through that carafe like it was water.  I would've ordered another one but I had an art opening to attend. Bua has a homey charm of a cool pub in a cool college town.   It also manages to be happily no frills but still has a conscience and serves a good product.  Bar food highlights - Brussel sprout kale salad, burger, and fried cheese curds (which sounds wonderful and gross all at once.)15 wine carafes 3-8pm.Small place with a patio.",20

Crowd seems to be in their 20s to mid 30sCame with a friend to have a couple drinks while waiting to get into a restaurant nearby. Fortunately, happy hour was still on so we got a couple cocktails ($7 each) and sat in front of the window (we got there around 630 so luckily we were able to snag a couple seats).Our cocktails weren't really that strong, but slowly crept up to me (to a point where I was just a little tipsy).Bartender was friendly, and overall seemed to be a pretty chill place.",5
27,,6/29/2018,294,,"South Orange, NJ",Ken K.,22,5.0,59,"The last way in which the EV of today still resembles the EV of yesteryear is that there is still a bar every 25 feet. With that kind of density, it's hard to differentiate. Bua does so with good strong pours, the best outside seating and surprisingly good bar food (cheddar cheese curds are the must try).",
28,,10/31/2016,61,,"New York, NY",Susan C.,798,2.0,214,"2.5 stars overall.Bua, I wanted to love you but my expectations fell flat. Came here last Saturday for drinks around 8:30pm with several friends and was also excited to try the food (many good reviews on Yelp!). Thankfully my friends had arrived earlier bc the wait for a table was about about 30min by 8:30pm. 3 stars on food and drinks.Fried chicken strips ($8): give it a 4/5. Crispy, flavorful, came with 6-7 pieces, would order these again. Fried chicken sandwich ($11): 4/5, friend tried this and remarked it was good. Grilled cheese sandwich with cheddar ($8): 3/5, cheese to bread ratio was off, the bread was grilled and slightly crispy on the outside but way too soft and thin. Also the sandwich was cut into quarters which probably smushed it too. I love grilled cheese sandwiches and just based on the bread I wouldn't try it again. The soup was pretty spot on and I enjoyed it.Fried cheese curds ($7): 2/5, it was okay to eat maybe two pieces, but any more than that was too much. They were really heavy and kinda made me feel ill while having an alcoholic drink at the same time. Drinks were good/okay 3/5. They have solid bartenders but nothing that blew my socks off. 2 stars on service: almost non-existent, we had to physically walk over to find our waitress each time we wanted to order anything or pay the bill. The entire restaurant/bar is LOUD, you have to shout to hear what people across your table are saying. Also when people smoke outside and bc the storefront seating opens into the sidewalk, the air wafts inwards and you get a good whiff of secondhand smoke. Yummy. Probably wouldn't come here again in the evening, or order food, tho I'd be willing to try it again for drinks on a quieter afternoon when you can hear conversation that's going on at your table.",

We were very underwhelmed by the RUDE RUDE RUDE waitress! (the young, maybe Australian girl?) Extremely unfriendly and short with our table! I was actually taken aback by how she spoke to us! Your clientele should leave your restaurant with a positive experience! The venue was fine and so were the beers, but the waitress left a HORRIBLE taste in our mouths",

32,,4/13/2018,15,,"Jersey City, NJ",Shruti A.,53,2.0,15,We wanted to check this place out as a lot of reviews claimed it to be the best HH.

33,11,11/22/2015,1460,9,"Manhattan, NY",Kashif K.,7784,4.0,360,"Why is a non-drinker reviewing a bar? Because it serves the most delicious, and perhaps the most fattening, fried chicken sandwich I have ever had (fair question, though)! The toast is drenched in butter, the filets of crispy fried chicken breast are heaped in generous quantities, and the crunchy, creamy, spicy slaw adds more flavor and texture to this messy deliciousness. The fried cheddar cheese curds are pretty good too. Great way to get the fat intake for a whole week in one evening. No regrets. I will do it again and die a happy man with clogged arteries.",12
34,,4/1/2018,1,,"Minneapolis, MN",Jory S.,0,5.0,3,The Paloma is by far the best in NYC. The last time i had one of such quality was in Mexico and even then it was using simple syrup instead of orange liquor. I seriously recommend it.,
35,,6/14/2018,4,1,"Port Washington, WI",Ashley M.,5,1.0,56,The female server is the rudest person I've ever come into contact with. Our family are locals and often visit this establishment but I think this will be the last one. She made a drink wrong and when we mentioned it she blamed it on us and brought us back the same drink again to argue some more instead of just remaking it properly. When she FINALLY brought us the correct drink she rudely dumped a quarter of the drink all over the table and didn't even bother to bring us any napkins. She has such an attitude problem. I don't expect her future to be any brighter than being a crap server at a bar. Watch out for the dark haired girl with the tattoos on her hands and arms (Australian accent),

The bartender at a bar we happened into (Lucky Jack's) recommended this nearby restaurant in the East Village, and it was exactly what we needed on a rainy afternoon.

39,65,6/6/2016,497,46,"New York, NY",Eric J.,1710,4.0,923,"I used to really frequent Bua back in my EV days, but recently the crowds on the weekends have been unmanageable, so it's been a while since I've been back. Came most recently on the Memorial Day Monday afternoon. It was really confusing at first because we went to the bar and they charged us happy hour prices, and when we sat down and got table service, the server promptly told us they weren't doing happy hour because of the holiday. So curious. That being said, it was cleared up right away, so it's safe to say that the staff is pretty chill.The popularity of Bua, in my opinion, stems from the outdoor seating arrangement, which is very comfortable, slightly nicer than your average dive bar, and has pretty easy access to the bar. Somewhat hard to come by in the East Village. It's also relatively well-protected from passers-by and it's easy to do some people-watching, if that's your thing. Happy hour is a big pull here too, with $4 draft beer and $15 wine carafes. Not too shabby. Their cocktails are pretty solid, although don't expect any crazy concoctions or huge ice cubes. The bar food they have consists of your typical burgers, fries, fried cheese curds and...black kale salad? Interesting. Service is generally pretty great, although can be spotty during busy hours, per usual. The fact that the staff is so chill is sort of double-edged sword, because while it makes the ambiance super comfortable, sometimes all you want is a nicely-expedited beer or cocktail, brought to your table. Prices are pretty standard for EV at around $7 for draft beers during normal hours, and $8-9 for a glass of wine. It's hard to say when I'll be back at Bua, due to the overwhelming popularity, suffering a similar fate to another one of my favorite bars, Blind Tiger in West Village. Nonetheless, it's always been a pretty solid place for a beer, and some random bar bites. I'll be back when it's not busy.",68

The grilled cheese started out well and then there was a part of the sandwich where the cheese wasn't melted at all. But of course, you don't go to a bar for the food usually.Overall, it's a great spot for cheap drinks and bar food. The place is fairly small, but it's good for having a chill night with friends.",1

I could tell it was difficult for him to manage everyone at the bar plus people walking up to order. He's cute and all, buuut....The Gold Rush was as refreshing as I'd hoped..really nice balance of boozy and sweet without being too sweet. I almost had to have a second one of those but decided to try the Habanero Margarita next. It was definitely tasty and had a nice kick to it, though it was more like tequila mixed with fresh lime juice, agave and a spicy mix added later (rather than the described ""house infused tequila."" Just saying). It was still good, and I already know I'll be back to try more.The fried chicken sandwich was good but not anything mind-blowing and was a bit overpriced in my opinion. The fries though...they were really solid pub fries, easily shareable by two people and worth the $5 side order price tag.I say come back for the happy hour drink prices, maybe some food if you get hit a little too hard and fast. The jury is still out on those grilled cheese sandwiches on Pullman Bread..I'm sure I'll try one next time.",5

Strawberry Slush (I think that's what it's called) is deliciously sweet and you can't taste the alcohol, but it's there. I've been here a couple times so far and every time I've gone, I've loved it. It gets busy and extremely crowded, but it really depends on where you go. I have yet to try the food, but it's been heavily raved about.

Updated review",531,3,"New York, NY",Morgan C.,268,3.0,252,"Unfortunately, I have to downgrade my review of Bua to reflect the horrible service we received on Friday night. I dragged a group of 10 or so coworkers downtown with the promise of enjoying ""one of the best bars in my neighborhood."" While we all had a great time, and everyone drooled over the famous chicken sandwich, the bartender that was there from our entrance around 7 until when we left at 11 was a real See You Next Tuesday. Honestly, I hope the management sees this review and gives her a lesson in how you treat costumers. I think its important to add, this is not just coming from me and my group of friends. Another girl waiting by me at the bar also commented on how rude she had been. Every time you asked this girl for a drink, you were met with a scowl. I've worked in food and bev, and honestly, how fucking hard is it to crack a smile? We were all using our please and thank yous, and this girl just returned them with the death stare. Was so appalled by her behavior that I almost went down to two stars, but really didn't think her attitude is representative of Bua and the rest of the staff. Aside from her, I still love this place and will continue to come. Hopefully, next time, she remembers to take her happy pills.",2

For 8 dollars I thought it was a small drink, I thought it was pricy but it was good my friend was feeling drunk so I guess it did the drink after the third one.. we ordered fries for 7 bucks it was a really small portion of fries they were really good and came out burning hot but for 7 Bucks way to small of a portion when the idea is to come for happy hour and have those solid prices we ended up having to get a second which shouldn't of been the case if the portion wasn't so small!

61,8,5/4/2015,2673,4,"Queens, NY",Jando S.,16559,4.0,3522,"After a decade plus of being in the ""East Village local"" scene, Bua has finally earned my business and appreciation after so many failed attempts. The initial visits were particularly brutal: cramped seating, really inadequate service, lameduck menu, and a bustling of woof worthy dbaggery that would really sully the joint. Any mention of Bua in my late night rotation of EV hopping and I would consider ending my night early. Yes, it was really that bad.The years have been kind; the staff makeover makes for particularly pleasant service during all hours, the happy hour specials are still there, the food has actually gotten better (and notably pricer), and even the bathrooms are clean again. For any nightlife haven in any hood as gritty as the EV, the latter is especially wonderful.It's also a matter of timing. If time is flexible, make plans for an earlier happy hour before the major crowd rush. Daytime drinking and eating is never a bad thing if the schedule allots for it and one will get to appreciate how much better this seedy yet intimate spot, looks during actual daylight hours. The mood is different, which might offer another perspective of how to really view Bua.But of course, certain cocktails cannot be ignored. Where the Bee's Knees was a favorite in the past, the Paloma (tequila, house grapefoot soda, salted grapefruit bits) and the Gold Rush (bourbon, honey, lime juice) are my go-tos now. They're both $10 a piece, but about $6 for happy hour and are the consummate summer adult beverages.  If one is still hungry after all of this, it should be known that Bua's kitchen stays open till close. Their infamous grilled cheeses served on pullman bread are still in the $7-8 range and are best accompanied by a cup of tomato soup ($3). The burgers are still solid at $8 a pop, likely because the meat is LaFrieda and the cook grills it just right almost every time.When the weather gets good, consider sitting outside. Just hope there were no drunks / hobos / misfits liquid marking their territory in the same spot hours earlier. Fingers crossed for better ventilation come the muggy months.",11

We had a waitress and it just seemed like it took forever for us to get our drinks and food each time we ordered. As other Yelpers have mentioned, there's no system for getting seats. It's typically a first come, first serve basis, but sometimes they just give seats to those who just walk in and/or you'll see groups of people fight like animals for chairs.Their drinks aren't that good, especially the bourbon honey one.

Don't bother.Came here for dinner and drinks on a Friday night and the waitress overcharged my friend and I's credit cards, then was both rude and unapologetic about it. Also, the food and drinks are not bad but teeny tiny.Here's the full story:My friends and I got dinner and a drink each. One girl did not get a drink, so they wouldn't take her card, since it's a 20 dollar minimum. No problem. She paid her part in cash and we asked to split the rest on three cards (should've been about 24 each).The waitress, who was not on her shit the whole night (the tan busboy with close-shaven black hair and facial hair--shout out to him--saved her ass at least 3 times) came back 10 minutes after taking our cards, stating that one of the cards only ran through for 15 dollars so she then took it upon herself to charge my other friend and I extra (30 bucks!) and decided that was OK. She flippantly stated this all in one breath, blamed us for the card not reaching the oh-so-sacred minimum, made no apologies, was absolutely vitriolic in her tone, and ran away before we could ask her to fix it.Now, having worked in foodservice as a waitress and bartender for years, I can assure you that this is a) not the way to handle this situation, b) something she could have fixed and c) definitely not even legal. The slender brunette waitress whose wardrobe comes from urban outfitters (wish I knew her name) claims she talked to the manager ""but he said it was fine"" as in, he was OK with the card not meeting the minimum, as if we were the ones who owed her an apology. If this is true and she did talk to the manager, then he absolutely mishandled this situation. They gave us no say in the matter, decided on their own that my friend and I would be OK with being charged extra, gave my friend no chance to give another form of payment, and on top of that did not apologize but instead made it seem like OUR fault. She is horrible and should be fired. I would have said this to them had anyone checked in on us, but no, she ran away and was never to be seen again.The food was fine and the scene was ""trendy"" or whatever, but given the way they handled this situation I would never ever be back, as long as this horrible waitress still works there.",3

We came here because some of our friends were in the area and suggested this place to hang. Although this place is pretty chic in terms of the decor, it is definitely a no go on a late Saturday night / early Sunday morning.First thing you notice is the sheer number of people. Literally all the square footage was taken by people. It was hard to make your way anywhere really. And because there are so many people, all table surfaces are filthy. Second thing you notice, because you probably drank too much before you got here, is the enormous line for two unisex bathrooms. (And just as luck has it, the line is full of girls fixing their makeup and generally taking a crapload of time not taking a piss.) Third thing you notice, because you probably want more to drink even though you really don't have the capacity, is that it takes around 30 minutes to get a drink because of the number of people crowded around the bar and the bartender's lack of urgency.

We shared an order of the fried cheese curds and fried pickles and we liked the cheese curds so much that we got one more order. I also liked the spicy chicken sandwich that I got.

The cheese curds were the best I've had in the city!However, after maybe our second drink, this homeless man began to cause trouble on the sidewalk right in front of everyone sitting outside. He was brandishing bottles and yelling. We ignored him for the most part but this other table of dummies seemed to be encouraging him. Management didn't seem to really be paying attention. Finally, he throws a glass bottle onto the ground and it shatters, with pieces of glass getting in my hair and landing on our table. Nice.Management asks us to move inside, all the tables in my area do, the dummies do not. At this point i think the call the cops but don't tell us so we're all wondering if they have even done anything. They don't tell the busboy, who takes everyone's full drinks away, assuming that we all just left en masse I guess. The waitress also doesn't know what's going on and casually asks us if we want another round as we're standing awkwardly in the doorway later. We're never given the all clear but since the guy seems to have left and people are vying for our table, we go back out. The poor waitress is overwhelmed and it takes forever for us to order more food. Anyway, long story short, the guy throws another bottle from across the street, a bouncer finally goes to talk to him unsuccessfully, the policy never come even though lots of people are now calling 911 (not Bua's fault!)The main issue is that I was disappointed that I actually had to ask to have the two full drinks we had to reorder taken off of our bill. Management never came outside to ask if we were okay. The busboy took our drinks but the table was never wiped, even though it had glass on it! Frankly, for how scary and unpleasant that experience was, we should have gotten another free round or had part of our bill comped. Having two drinks we didn't get to drink taken off of our bill should have been the absolute minimum that was done.",5

I stuck to the red lemonade all evening (crisp/not too sweet/perfect for the warm night I was there), but the pickle martini is what I want to try next. The bar has a good amount of seating and there are larger tables in the adjacent room for bigger groups. It's softly lit with a low-key but simultaneously energetic vibe? Not sure how they pulled that off, but I'm into it. It's a good mix. They have a nice patio, but it shuts down way too early. I'd like to check it out during the day though. There are two bathrooms, which is great when there's a line, but the barn door styled doors are SUPER heavy, so be careful when opening them. Bartender was attentive (and cute), nice remixy music was playin all evening, and I just generally had a nice time here. Will def be returning.",

The Pims cup was my drink of choice and it was enjoyable. What made it more enjoyable was the $10 pricetag which is almost unheard of for cocktails in NYC.

The bartenders are forgettable, the drinks are forgettable, the place itself is just boring and uncomfortable if you don't have a table. The bar area is confined to like 1/4 of the venue with a wall dividing the restaurant area. Very limited seating. The vibe of this place is......well, there is no vibe. I'm convinced BUA translates to BORING in some other language. I've been here on a Tuesday and Saturday, both times ready to leave after a drink or two.  I'm willing to give this place one more shot, maybe in the summer during happy hour and some outdoor seating. I wouldn't give BUA less than three stars, I don't have enough reasons to hate it and the ""Pimp's Cup"" drink seems to be very popular (although I don't think it's anything special). Sorry BUA, strawberries don't impress me and the drink itself is weak!Go here if you have absolutely nothing to do OR before going somewhere that's actually FUN. Thumbs down.",4

They told me in advance it would get packed around 2pm, and they were spot on.

The ambiance on a warm day outside is great- lots of people watching on st. marks place! I got the chicken sandwich which was incredible, the chicken is cooked very well and the cole slaw on it is not too spicy at all, plus the bread they serve it on is divine! My friend got the grilled cheese which is MUCH smaller in comparison and cost 2$ less, so I would say the chicken sandwich is the way to go. We loved our cocktails, I got the pimms which is a personal favorite (this place made it very well, with lots of fresh fruit on the top...so perfect for summer.)

I know Bua is incredibly popular in the summer, but it also draws a great crowd during the winter months. The happy hour prices are fabulous, with cocktails at only six dollars (wine was at fifteen a glass which I found surprising for the EV). I opted for the Spiced Cider (normally I would have had wine but it was so cold outside I decided to give this it a try) and I was so happy I did. It was delicious, warm, and hit the spot! It was definitely the most popular drink on the menu, every other table was drinking a glass. I decided to have a second (they are just the right size and served in glass mugs) however our waitress said it would be fifteen minutes before another pot was ready, since everyone was drinking it. We told her this was fine, however she brought us complimentary Jameson and Gingers because of the wait. Completely unnecessary but so nice! It was my first time ever having Jameson and Ginger (definitely don't do whiskey) but it was fantastic.

Prices are moderate for the area and they are one of a few places that serve Templeton Rye; which is a favorite of mine.I know they serve food, but I'm not a big eater when I'm drinking....Food just slows the flow of Alcohol into the bloodstream, and I windup spending more money trying to get lit. So, I can't comment on the food...although the Chalkboard Menu always has some weird shit posted. So, if I wanted to order...I'm not sure what I would want. The bartenders can be a bit more....hmmmm......friendlier and personable. And they seem to move at a pace that is probably more suitable for an Old Age Home Bar, rather than a fast moving, busy/crowed bar.

It may be a long, long time before I taste a pickle in the same way again, but for this brief moment in time (I lie, it was like 5 hours), it was pickle bliss. Spicy. Get it with vodka (not gin) for the smoothest taste (group consensus). It's basically a dirty martini, but ain't no olives, just pickles. You likea da pickle? You likea the booze? You likea this. Their cocktail menu also should get some attention. The shandy was next on my list, but after 2 pickle martinis my date for later that evening cut me off. Good thinking, but I'll be kicking back a shandy at some point. St. Marks my words. I met a long lost pal of mine for drinks late Saturday afternoon. She had perched herself perfectly at an outside table (the people watching is supreme) and we drank and laughed and watched people go about their days with dogs, babies, mohawks and the like. Our group of 2 grew to 7 over the course of our 5 hours, but it all just seemed to work out the way it should. Stools pulled over, the rain didn't stop us...covered by the awning, we continued. Rounds and rounds of beers and cocktails...Our waitress was quick, and efficient...sweet even. The bathrooms were clean. The crowd was laid back. The vibe was relaxed. It was not overly crowded. These were all the makings of a great Saturday afternoon of drinking. This is not something I typically do, but with a place like Bua to do it, I think I could absolutely get on board. Great place to take folks that aren't into the scene. Also, reasonable prices (relatively speaking). Martinis were huge and $10. Beers about $6. Most of cocktail list under $9. 4-stars.

When a friend wanted to meet up here, I agreed, figuring that Bua's popularity has to be justified apart from the fact that it's on St Marks Place.And sure, their cocktail menu has a few interesting things on it. I tasted their pickled martini, and for myself I got a caipirinha. I'm not a pickle person, but was told that it tasted just like alcoholic pickle juice. (Hmm.) Cocktails are also cheap, averaging around $8 or $9. However, it gets way too loud and packed on weekend nights to actually have a half-decent conversation, so choose wisely.",
136,1,10/23/2011,18,2,"New York, NY",Jay G.,359,5.0,321,"A quaint little bar tucked away down past first avenue, almost to the park. I generally start my day here for the happy hour (1-5pm), drinks are $4 or $5 bucks. The Ginger Highball is a favorite and for only 5 bucks its a heck of a deal.The bar itself is a interesting spot sporting exposed brick and tea lights sprinkled around the area. A casual examination of the bar will let you know they have the top brands, even Pimm's #1, a very rare sight.My first time here I was sitting next to two unbelievably annoying germans. They were in their late 40's but dressed like they were in their middle 30's and the ensemble just wasn't working, think Buster Bluth in a muscle shirt. They both were drinking champagne and I think they were coked out, also fidgety. And the really annoying fidgety guy was sitting next to.... me. Of course! (Yes, Virginia, there is a god and he doesn't like me)  So, If you come here and its packed with chubby frats (DUDE!) or annoying eurotrash move on to another bar, east village is full of em'. This is a great place to get a real drink and not be overpowered by the surroundings. It seems they adjust the drink menu for the summer/winter seasons. Its a good bet you'll try a few and settle on a favorite. That's what i did.",1

I should have known it was too good to be true, but my I let my optimism win when I was deciding where to go, to my dismay. They really should change this on the menu, because it is universal that a carafe is .75 L, not .375 L. The food was priced well for happy hour and was delicious, however. Nice vibes, although it was too dark to read my menu, and I needed a flashlight to see anything (I have 20/20 vision-mind you).

Fear not! Bua is a solid bar that you should visit on the weekdays. (Weekends get crazy packed)On weeknights this place is really nice. The decor is great: exposed brick walls, rustic wooden tables, semi-hidden bathroom. It's a great place to sit down and catch-up with friends. Drinks prices won't break the bank.",1

184,,6/24/2015,2,,"New York, NY",Luke L.,3,3.0,13,Great bar with good music and happy hour specials til 8pm. $4 drafts etc. 3 stars though because the bartender is a horrible person. If you walk in and it's the taller bearded guy with an accent bellowing at patrons and recklessly spitting his testosterone everywhere... I can recommend the bars across the street as an alternative. He charged $2 for water... And he took swigs of alcohol straight out of the bottles?????? Maybe my water was paying for that?? Good luck I guess.,

Also some music in the background. Would've loved to sit outside, but this is definitely not the weather for it.Drinks were all the same, also ordered their fries and fried pickles. My friend loves fried pickles, but thought the pickles here were in bigger slices than other places, so she wawsn't as big a fan.",1

188,1,8/19/2010,1692,2,"Durham, NC",Sarah G.,12,3.0,1647,"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars....or 3.5 stars....it really isn't worthy of this 3 stars, but I think this place lets in WAY too many people at a time. I know it is hot and humid outside and everyone just wants to get indoors, but when you let in THAT many people this place ends up feeling just as hot, humid and sticky as outside!It does have great decor inside and feels different than a lot of other bars in the area. It has this sort of giant wine cellar type feel to it which I totally like. Lots of wooden decor and walls and it is so dimly lit inside it just sort of makes the entire atmosphere a little more calming...well that really only happens when you don't feel like a sardine in a sardine can while trying to drink you drink....I also felt so badly for the bar tenders because they were swamped! It took us forever to get our drinks because the doorman just lets in more people than I think firecode should allow and it is too many people to serve, and this bar really isn't THAT big that once the bar has people sitting at it, there is almost no way to get a drink....I guess patience is a virtue though, right???",1

Employees are great, food was great and drinks were great sometimes and this is why.There was a male and a female bartender.  I've gotten serviced from this female bartender all night.  First I asked for dirty martini extra dry and I got extra dirty.  Then she charged me $18 for drinks and I got $8 change for my $20 payment.  When my sister ordered from her, the same thing happened here she got more change back.  All the drinks made by her in our group was awful, I don't think she has a clue how to make drinks.  My 3rd dirty martini, I got a pickle martini. My friends ordered Jameson drinks and got something totally different.  When we switched to the male bartender, wow the drinks were night and day compared to the female bartender.    We all truly thought that there was something wrong with this female bartender.  We were more amused rather than upset.  She needs help with memory and making better drinks.",

Nice location with outdoor seating, but it does get very crowded later at night. Ordered a couple drinks and sat at the table by the outside to get fresh air. We just went up to the bar to order our drinks Will be back to try the food one day.",
191,1,9/2/2012,594,1,"New York, NY",Jess C.,582,4.0,305,"Came here for a birthday on Friday night. We were pleasantly surprised at how accomodating they were even though we were late for our reservation. Throughout the night, the waitresses and bartenders were all incredibly friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Beers are $6.50 - they have my faves guinness, ommegang light, and magnum's cider so I was happy. Cocktails are about $9-10 with an interesting Ginger cocktail and Strawberry one. Of course they have wine too. They also have decent food, which was perfect for people coming straight from a late shift.The music was decent, not top 40s but bob-your-head type house music. It wasn't too loud, but with a lot of people talking, it was inevitable to yell over the noise to be heard. It can get pretty crowded but if you can get a table, it's not too bad.The crowd was great, lots of 20 to 30 somethings, and many very nice looking. And unlike most bars, the bathroom wasn't gross; they were well-stocked in amenities and quite spacious. Cozy, brick decor, and decent drinks - a chill neighborhood find!",1
192,,12/19/2012,34,,"New York, NY",Julia F.,8,4.0,33,"To say that I am a connoisseur of Pickleback shots is an understatement - if you haven't had one before, you need to stop reading this and head straight to Bua to order one. I've had them all over the city, and there is not one place that even comes close to Bua. Overall, this place is an all around solid place for drinks. The bartenders consistently serve solid drinks, no matter what night of the week it is.With that said, my only complaint is that it gets quite crowded, which is especially problematic in the summer since there's no AC or even fans. Nothing a few Picklebacks can't help you forget about, though.",1
193,,12/14/2012,30,,"Manhattan, NY",Monica H.,0,2.0,93,"Came here on a Monday night; this place is a lot dive-ier than the website or menu would suggest.   Based on the cocktail menu offering French 76's and Ginger Highballs, I was hoping for a slightly more trendy, classy place - expectations were definitely not met in that respect.    There was a slightly dive-bar smell of beer-soaked wooden floors and the bartender was wearing a tank top and hoodie with her hair pulled back in a lazy ponytail.  Again, not that it's a bad thing, but definitely not the place I originally thought it would be.I ordered the bourbon cocktail with honey and lemon (can't recall the name); was definitely too sweet for my taste.  I also tried the Pimm's cup which came in a huge 12 oz glass but taste a bit of faint cough syrup.  Conceptually, it sounded like a great place to get some tasty cocktails but much more casual than expected.May come back from some basic drinks, but will probably be staying away from their cocktail menu fare.",1

The ambiance is great, their drinks are pretty original and great beer selection. The happy hour is by far the best around including some of those great cocktails. One of the has cucumber and gin. But I think what mostly brings me back is the friendliness of the staff. I don't know where they found them but they are great. Other bars should take note of their amazing hospitality despite of being the busiest bar on the block.",
197,,10/31/2012,170,,"Brea, CA",Kelvin C.,1128,3.0,1145,"This is decent little bar if you're constantly getting snubbed by all the Speakeasy's in the area.  The bartender was friendly, the environment was sociable, and they have an okay selection of drinks on the menu/draft.  This place could get packed so if your trying to get to the restroom, you'll be bumping asses with a bunch of dudes (yeah, this place was a sausage-fest when I went).  Nevertheless, this is not a bad place to grab a drink on your bar-hopping adventure.",1
198,,10/6/2012,2,1,"New York, NY",G T.,0,1.0,13,"Erm-seriously - this place is a sad, sad joint. Here's a quick rundown:1) Bartender lady with funny teeth tried to jip me off my change. Gave her 2 twenties for a bill of 21 and she came back with 9 dollars - tried to keep the 10 for herself. It was so blatant-wonder how many people she has tried to pull that off with. I looked at her - and she looked back in that ""busted! shameful"" way.. 2) The vibe in this bar is always weird-even though the decor is modern-it's got a ""lowlife"" atmosphere?2) It's just a shitty joint-for all the other great bars around the hood, it's a wonder why people go here. St Dymphna's next door is much better.",1
199,,2/19/2013,906,,"Mountain View, CA",David C.,3680,3.0,1717,"Not a bad place to get the night started or to catch up with friends.  Interior is candlelit, so it is a bit dark.  Whiskey based cocktails are absolutely fantastic.  Drinks are typical Manhattan prices.  I liked the cocktails, but I don't feel that there was anything unique that would drive me to pick this over other bars in the area.",
