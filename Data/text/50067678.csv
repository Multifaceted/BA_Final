Walk down the steep black steps and you'll enter a pretty damn cool Beer Bar.It's dark and a bit cramped.. I think the perfect lighting for a date. It feels more Brooklyn than Greenwich Village, but that's okay. While the beers are a bit on the pricey side, you can get some awesome choices like Duvel and some other Belgian/UK brands which aren't as common in every NYC bar.Not advised for big groups at all, especially on the weekends. Come to wow your out of town friends.",1,,2
1,Jihea P.,"New York, NY",24,90,12,5.0,8/23/2018,"I'd have to say one of my favorite bars. They also accept credit card now which is a win! Yes, it's dark. Yes, it's cramped. One might even consider it spooky. But, definitely good vibes. I'd only stay though if I knew I can get a seat - standing in the cramp hallway is not the way I'd want to spend my night.",1,,
2,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,3/10/2018,"This bar is a gem on Macdougal street. It's fairly non descript on the outside and actually difficult to find. It's very dimly lit on the inside with a more hushed vibe. A few lights here and there with some candle lighting as well. It's fairly warm inside because there was a large heater near the entrance wall. Large selection of Belgian beers and other beers with a fairly limited wine selection. I went with the Trappistes Rochefort 10, which is a Belgium Quad. I don't think I've ever paid this much for a bottled beer before, but I do love my strong dark ales. It always has such a smooth, full bodied, low in bitterness taste and yet it's significantly stronger than your average beer. (This quad was 11.3%)One thing that stood out to me was sitting at the end of the bar allows you to see all the way down the dimly lit bar. This corner spot is also good for a group of 3/4. Makes it much easier to speak to one another. Bartenders here were friendly and never pressured us to order more.",2,1,1

I don't really mind though - especially when you feel like you're being teleported to a completely different state and forget that you're actually in the middle of greenwich village.Locals seem to love this spot and stay until they find themselves satisfied (saw multiple people with ~6 empty cans by their side)Will be back with beer-loving friends.",2,,

There's steps leading up to the bar and you don't see a name outside making it hard to find the place. Once you step inside, it's warm but the darkness made me want to leave right away.They have a large selection of beers, we had a dark ale which was strong  and wasn't bitter.Also the place is cash only so we had to rush to find an ATM in the area before we got here.",,1,

No American craft that I saw Service: casual and easy going, the menu isn't helpful for people who don't know European beers well but the staff is if you ask Decor: dungeon!

9,Marleigh S.,"New York, NY",11,157,27,4.0,4/30/2017,"This is a really fun hole in the wall of a bar.  If you are like me and the vibe of mostly NYU undergrads out to get drunk is not the definition of a good night out, then this is a nice place of rescue.  The theme is dark and a little creepy, so if that sounds like fun to you, then give it a try.  We did walk past the place twice before finding it because it is below street level.  Fun!They have some good beers, all bottled.  If you go in knowing that, then it's okay.  This means you can't sample, but the bartenders were very friendly and helped the whole group pick something they would like.  For those nights that I'm looking for an inconspicuous seat to have a beer in, without all the excitement of a cocktail bar or the friendliness of a pub, I will return.  Enjoy!",3,1,

19,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,827,9215,4.0,10/21/2015,"Discreetly hidden among the raucous businesses and patrons of McDougal Street is a serious beer bar.  Navigate via door number (124) to face some steep metal stairs that lead down to a black door, flanked by an image of a rabbit and its name in tiny lettering above the door frame.To enter 124 Old Rabbit Club is akin to descending underground.  The cave-like space is narrow and unusually dimly lit, even for a bar.  After some adjustment to the light level, it becomes possible to see the exposed brick, white subway tile, and low-slung pressed tin ceilings that complete an unfinished subterranean look, accented by a subtle rabbit motif.Most of the seats are at the very long bar that dominates the interior.  There isn't much space otherwise to stand.  Then again, this isn't the typical bar to socialize at, and is most certainly not a sports bar.  Its a place to enjoy a bottled brew from a serious list of European beers, divided between Belgians, Germans, and English/Scottish.  Surprisingly for a beer bar, their draft selections are not the reason to go; only a handful of taps, which feature good but not unusual domestic crafts.  There's not much for the non-beer drinker, with just a few token wines in all.  But for the craft beer drinker, its Christmas.  With Christmas ales (seasonally), alongside over three dozen Belgians ranging from Trappists to saisons to dubbels, tripels, and quads, and a bonanza of sours, and not just the more accessible ones.  Great stuff, served in proper glassware.  The English and German list is wide-ranging also, with just about every style represented, but not explored yet.The bartenders are approachable, knowledgeable, and friendly.  The only impediment to getting their guidance is the background music, which is usually metal or punk dialed up a tad too high for comfortable conversation.  That, the overly dim lighting that makes reading the menu and seeing the beers challenging, lack of bar snacks, and a cash policy when the average cost of a bottle is about $10 scales down its rating.  But most of these are arguably minor quibbles.  124 Old Rabbit Club still carved out a unique niche among the many craft beer bars in NYC.  Great place.",3,,

They used to only take cash but not take credit cards which is definitely a plus. The bar has got a great speakeasy feel and is usually pretty dark making it a cool spot to hang if you've got friends who are into beer. There are no TV's, music and its a quite narrow space so not particularly great for large groups or events. If you're into beer, this is the place to go.",,,
21,Jay S.,"Manhattan, NY",160,4,1,1.0,4/2/2017,"I wish I could give this place no stars because the bartender here is the worst.Apparently the bartender was very offended because my friend said something nice about Ivanka Trump and he was so upset that instead of having a discussion he just kicked us out. (We are not even Trump supporters)I have lived half my life in NYC and never been kicked out of a bar for having a friendly discussion with my friends over a beer.We were not even offending any other patrons and we were not even drunk or rowdy.He was absolutely the worst, rudest bartender I have ever met in NYC.  This place should have a warning sign saying ""Freedom of speech isn't allowed at this bar""",8,7,6
22,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,2.0,9/5/2016,"I've got to be honest: I wasn't a fan of this place.  Old Rabbit Club is housed within the old Bourgeois Pig space here down by NYU.  It's unmarked from the street, very dark, and very cramped.  It's essentially a speakeasy for beer, but with none of the positives of an actual speakeasy.  Due to it being cramped, expect to sweat on top of the person next to you.  Service was terrible--an impressive feat given how physical close to end up being to the bartenders.  Basically the snobby craft beer nerds manning the place took care of a few select patrons who they seemed to know and left us largely to ourselves.  If you asked for a recommendation, it was abundantly clear that they were doing you a favor.  It took forever to order, get an actual drink, and also to leave.As for the beer list, it was good but not great in theory.  The one beer (Other Half) they had on draft was tapped out, which they discovered when they tried pouring it a full 15 minutes after I'd ordered it (noticing a theme?).  Their bottle lists was full of holes as they didn't have a number of the bottles listed.  I was okay once I found a few bottles that they did have, but for the prices I was paying I should've been wowed and I was not--not even close.  Beer in a speakeasy environment doesn't work to begin with because beer is inherently cheaper (even world class beers) and the bartenders don't do anything to it but serve it, but add in a poorly executed speakeasy environmen with bad bartending and you have a straight up loser of an experience.  There are too many great beer bars in NYC to put up with this.",2,1,

Once your eyes have adjusted to the lighting (provided by a couple candles on the bar) and the friendly bartender has talked you through the menu, you can have a good time here. As for the drinks, they have a bunch of cool beers and one 80 proof Jaeger-esque shot that was only $5 and definitely worth it in terms of alcohol content (maybe not taste). I liked the music playing--the general vibe was funky, chill, and friendly. Maybe not the greatest place to go with a huge group of friends because the space is small and basically just a straight line of stools at the bar, but overall I liked how lowkey and unassuming the place was.

27,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,5.0,2/18/2015,"Post a Valentine's dinner with a good friend, we immediately scored two seats upon walking into 124 Old Rabbit Club, which I can say was very lucky. With crowds coming in and out throughout the evening, attaining seats can seem a challenge. Once settled in however, it will be hard to leave. Undeniably a narrow, small space, and as others have noted, it is extremely dim and dark. It takes time for the eyes to adjust, but it makes for an atmosphere that I found to be super chill, intimate, in spite of what others may describe as a dark basement or small closet. It may seem limited on the space, but it is big on the beer selection. It is nice to happen upon a secret beer spot of the West Village. There is no other liquor served, minus some wine choices. It is cash only also.The menu is substantial in choices, and there is definitely something you will find new to try. Pull up a candle to their one page menu, one will see a list a great variety of Belgians, English, and German ales, ranging from IPAs to sours to pale ales, etc. Our bartender that evening was sociable and helpful in providing advice on the beer options. I tried the Evil Twin Hipster Pale Ale and the Petrus Aged Ale (sour), and they were solid choices. The pricing is a little expensive when compared to others, especially for non-draught beers. All beers come bottled or in cans, which I find as a slight drawback. I will definitely return to this spot and recommend to others. I have not found a better, or more decent beer spot in the West Village. I would give 5 stars should there have been a draught menu, unless I am mistaken. Nonetheless, cool hidden, intimate beer spot worth checking out.",7,2,5

33,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,7/20/2015,"This place is an itty bitty beer palace that was not on my radar until two days ago. It's essentially a speakeasy...but with beer. Lots and lots of beer. More beer than speakeasies have cocktails. The best part? I'm not sure I recognized any beer on the menu. Novelty and allure are, well, novel and alluring. So I was hooked even before trying anything.The dichotomy of MacDougal truly amazes me. It houses a dynamite cocktail bar, The Up & Up, as well as this joint. In the East Village, both of these places would be suffocatingly crowded and/or would have pretty long wait times. But on a street populated by what seems to be the entirety of NYU on any given night, these two places are strangely not that full. Not that I'm complaining - if the Old Rabbit Club had been packed/rowdy when we went (granted, we were there during the wee hours of the morning), I probably would've knocked a star off this review. But it wasn't. Dark, cozy, hidden and the polar opposite of what I like to call MacDougal Mayhem. While the space itself is tiny, the beer menu is expansive. Like I said, they all were completely alien to me. Belgian tripels are my go-to beers, so I figured telling the bartender that would suffice for him to find me something comparable. Thanks to the app Untappd (would highly recommend it), I've started tracking the different beers I try at these types of places. So despite me being, as my friend put it, ""droopy"" by the end of the night (due to exhaustion, no inebriation, thankfully), I still took note of what I was served - Gouden Carolus Tripel brewed at ""Brouweij Het Anker"" in Belgium. If you're a fan of dark and/or Belgian beers, this one has my vote.",7,,2

They open at 6:00 PM on Friday, and not a minute before. There's no sign on the door, just a painting of a white rabbit on the door. It was snowing and there were two policeman on horseback standing at MacDougal and Minetta, just to make things a little more surreal. :)There's one long bowling lane of a bar with a table for 4 at each end.

It's... not my thing. With the hour having passed into the next day I was ready to head back to my hotel when down and to the right I spotted a steel door. Dark and inconspicuous. The type of entrance that likely fronts a sex dungeon in another reality. Cheap decals read ""CRAFT BEER BAR."" This can't be right. I took each step down with caution - noticing a faint sliver of light peeking through - and I gently pried the door open half expecting a grizzly arm to reach out and pull me into some strange hell.I stepped into the bar's dim glow and to my absolute surprise minimal techno plays over the speakers. I love minimal. Am I dreaming?What followed was one of the more magical moments of that trip. Turned out that Harrison, behind the bar, was feeding the speakers from his phone. He didn't seem like the type of person to suffer fools but after buying my sincerity we talked music until closing. Harrison, if you're reading this please know that it was that conversation that sparked my love for music again. You pointed me in the direction of some parties, from where I came across labels like L.I.E.S, and I've been learning of new music ever since.

I have lived at nyc for over 1 year, and tried so many bars at a weekly basis, with best beer, best appetizer, best music, or best view. I was hanging out with my friend and I saw this bar at Yelp, it seems like a tiny bar without many spaces for customers. Well, that sounds nice in a rainy night, doesn't it?It turned out that this bar is located near NYU, and the entrance is so secretively located that you could miss it ten times passing that road if you don't have a sharp eye. My friend went to park her car, and I went inside. The place is even tinier than it is in my imagination, with a smell of damp amd mouldy. It has overall, around 10 seats. There are only 2 small tables, and one of them are occupied. Oddly, in such a busy hour when all the other bars in this street are filled with people, there are only 3 customers there, which makes this tiny bar looks deserted.This is the first time I went to this bar. I went over to the bartender, and asked that if I could seat on the table if its not reserved. And then I just came across the most astonishing moments in my entire experience of going to bars. The bartender is a young man, around 26-28, with a look of woolgathering, like everything bored him.He squinted at me, said, ""Seat wherever you want, DO I LOOK LIKE YOUR FATHER?""In a moment, I froze. This is such a unexpected response that I didn't know how to react. All the other customers, well, the other three customers turned around and looked at him, and then looked at me. Anyone who were really there must be really confused about what was going on here.My friend came in, and she was like,""come on did you already ordered some beer for me?"" I feel cold, and my hand trembled. ""Lets just go to some other place, shall we?""We went to a local bar just across the street, in front of 124 Old Rabbit Club. We had fun, and drank a lot, and then I shared this horrible story with my friends.We were really confused about what really happened. Is he some kind of extreme racist? If so, why a bar located at NYU, which has so many international students, would hire a racist? I am an Asian, I have lived in England, Hong Kong, LA, Beijing and New York, and going to local bars is my favorite. I sure have met several drunk idiots at some bar, but I have NEVER in my life met anyone treating customers like that. Is he just not in a good mood? If so, I really felt sorry for any potential customers who might go to that bar. I even hope that he is a racist: then he is only insulting Asian customers. If not, he is just insulting all the customers in the world. So you are planning to go to that bar huh? Consider AGAIN. The probability of you being insulted is just random. You would feel bad, and you would feel humiliated, but the most important part is, you just ruined your own evening.",5,12,

43,Morbo R.,"Manhattan, NY",22,58,54,5.0,2/21/2016,"My friends and I call this ""The rabbit hole"" to refer back to Alice in Wonderland. It's a nice place to get a great beer (or 4...hahaha). The Rabbit Club is a great offset to the outside atmosphere. I had a great time there. At first, the bartender wasn't the most inviting but sure warmed up when we replied with equal acerbic humor. We had a great time joking and drink. Sure the price of the beers were higher than most locations but consider what you are drinking. Most places have ""common"" beers. Rabbit Club has what you are looking for. I suggest you stumble down the Rabbit Hole to the Rabbit Club. You will NOT be disappointed...unless all you drink is Bud or Coors in a sports bar. Then don't go. Please don't go...cause I surely wouldn't want to see you there. And I'm sure most of the people who are interested in drinking non-domestic beers wouldn't want to see you there.

Old Rabbit Club was brought to my attention by my beer loving co-worker and she purposely made this a spot on the agenda. I thought I would honestly hate it, a 'super secret' club type place with a bunch of beers-basically it was what I thought Torst would be like: overpriced, pretentious a-holes, but honestly it was great. The staff there was friendly and even though there were honestly, more people that I thought the place could carry everyone got served and after being told it was for my bachelor party we got a lot of attention and the staff were funny and so easy to deal with. The cost of the beers were honestly not that bad, I just don't know if it's a place I could come back to again and again.",,,

Can I move in tomorrow?As I wandered into this subterranean haunt I needed to adjust my eyes for a minute before I walked into a wall, chair, person....... It's damn dark in here!It was early evening on a weekday and the place was packed. It's small and narrow so scoring a spot at the bar is at a premium. Almost claustrophobic like. If you can belly up to the bar hold onto that spot for dear life. I got lucky and grabbed a stool along the candlelit bar. Mine! Mine! Mine! Was greeted by the friendly barkeep who handed me a menu of their extensive quality craft beer list. Had to move a candle on top of it to actually be able to read it. Eff that - I turned on my flashlight ap on my phone so I could see. All beer here, no hard liquor. For those complaining that there is no booze here please head on over to the multitude of other cookie cutter bars in the city to get your Cosmo or Jager shots, as the beer list here is pretty eclectic and wonderful. Not a place for loud groups or frat buddies partying hard, but more for a drink with a friend or date who can appreciate a good beer over conversation. It can get a bit warm in here though so dress light. As I stated, the 124 Old Rabbit Club offers a terrific selection of beers from imports to domestics. They even have the specialty glasses that some are to be poured into. So key! I quite enjoyed my Belgian beer while listening to old punk and indie rock. A beer here is not on the cheap side, but you are paying for quality, and the devine atmosphere that helps keep the bridge and tunnel riff raff away. So worth it for a few extra shekels.    Take a chance on this craft brew emporium secretly hidden in plain sight, and scurry down the rabbit hole into the catacombed madness that is Alice in Beer Wonderland. Dark, a bit seedy, maybe even reminds one of a sex club that you have innocently wandered into, but are willing to stay awhile and explore what they have to offer.",23,17,20

I saw a stenciled sign that read ""rabbit club craft beer bar"" and uh yeah I was sold. All it really took was the ""craft beer,"" actually.The place opens at 6pm (also noted on a half chipped away stencil on the mailbox), and at around 6:10 on a Friday it's already packed. Like, can't fit anyone else inside packed. Luckily, my man and I scored the last two seats, a tiny table in the pitch black corner, and got a list of the bottles. There were, when I was there, 2 taps with mediocre craft drafts that I didn't fancy, and besides that a list of maybe 40 or so bottles. Pretty decent selections, I believe they were divided into American and Belgian, or something along those lines. Cash only, and bring a lot because the bottles are around $10 each. It's way overpriced, for most of the bottles, especially when you could go down the street to Blind Tiger and get equally as awesome beer, but on draft, for usually half of that. I may return for 1 beer with a friend or two if it were a quieter night, if that exists at this place, but in summary-too loud, too dark, and too expensive. I sound like an old lady.

A beer bar--nothing more, nothing less.I walked in just before 6 and the place was closed, with the assistant bartender unpacking boxes and doing work logistics. He generously allowed me to stay but once 6 hit things got busy. One after another, hop heads shuffled in and took their spots along the bar. The bartender, who looked obligatorily strung out and tired from a day of napping, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in a no-nonsense kind of way.I stayed here for about 4 hours, so I definitely got the lay of the land. The crowd consists mostly of 20&30-something beer-loving bros, with a few after-work meetups and some randoms (sophisticated trio with a distinguished-looking middle aged man daintily sipping a tripel like a snifter of brandy, two wasted girls who stumbled in asking for Maker's Mark at a beer & wine bar).Their German list is short but carefully curated, with all the best Schneider Weiss selections on it as well as rarer stuff with New Zealand hops (new rage). The Belgian list is excellent, with more interesting options than I've seen at Vol de Nuit or BXL.

81,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,390,60,3.0,2/10/2014,"Two weekends ago I was supposed to meet friends on MacDougal Street on a damp Sunday night. We hadn't fully agreed upon a place, so I was standing outside Minetta Tavern with two other friends when I saw it. I knew it was a door to a speakeasy. I just knew it. I was remembering someones Yelp photos, maybe an article from NYMag...but something told me it was there. I crossed the street and went down the very narrow and slippery steps to an almost unmarked door. The few markings there were made me knew I was right. I was standing outside of 124 Old Rabbit Club. I motioned for my friends to join me, and lucky for me, I didn't have to do any convincing, because I have dragged them to every hidden door, curtain, false wall and phone booth I can think of, so this was actually typical behavior. I got that crazy giddy feeling I always get right before you really get to see a speakeasy first hand. It's definitely my drug. I love to see what is behind that door, the curtain, whatever falsities are hiding a cocktail den of mystery...here it comes...Door opens and there is a long bar in probably some of the lowest lighting in a bar I have ever seen. I even had trouble reading the menu. This is partially because I'm getting old. I am almost thirty. It sucks. Trust me. But it really was dark. It was a little grungy, not usually the NYC speakeasy scene, with only two other people at the bar. Hmmm. This was my biggest problem. They only serve beer and wine. No cocktails. That's super disappointing for me, since bourbon is my main man. I ordered a red wine which wound up being delicious. I guess when beer and wine are your whole bag, it better be good. Our other friends came in to join us after a little while and liked it too. We didn't stay all that long, mostly because it's hard to have 8 people in a line at the bar, there was no room to stand behind anyone. I can see this place filling up pretty fast, I wonder if anyone does crowd control at the door on Friday & Saturday nights? I think it's a great place to meet someone for a quick drink or two, but uncomfortable bar stools and limited selection doesn't do it for me. I'm sure I will come back, I always do, but my god man.

When I first heard of you, I did not know what to expect. Looking at photos, you seemed intimate, but at the same time, kind of grungy. Nonetheless, down the rabbit hole I go. When you're walking down MacDougal, it is incredibly easy to walk right past this bar. There really isn't a sign aside from the ""124"" and a stencil of a rabbit on the wall. Make your way down the stairs, through the door that doesn't really close all the way, and you're transformed into a nice beer haven in Greenwich Village. right off the bat, you'll probably realize very quickly that although 124 Old Rabbit Club has a plethora of beer, there is nothing on draft. This is pretty much due to the fact that they can keep a huge selection and rotate beers as things come along. If you're coming here looking to consume hard alcohol, then go somewhere else. This place is strictly beer only.The staff here is incredibly nice, and will help you figure out what to order based on your taste preference. With so many obscure beers here, I always ask so that I can order something different. As far as the bar itself, it is pretty narrow. There are bar stools spread along the bar, as well as a couple booths for larger parties to sit down. Lighting is pretty minimal, as you're pretty much using the candles as your primary source. To read the menu, I had to pull out my iPhone and utilize that trusty flash feature. 124 Old Rabbit Club is straight up no frills. You come here, without having to dress to impress, and you know exactly what you're going to get. They have a great beer selection, laid back atmosphere, and a great staff. Prices here for their beers aren't on the cheaper side, and this place is Cash Only, so prepare beforehand. After that, make your way down the rabbit hole and enjoy the ride.",4,1,3

86,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245,5.0,9/4/2013,"IN SHORT: An underground, hole-in-the-wall Village joint that will let you escape from the hustle and bustle of the street. Look for the 124 above an unmarked black door, walk down the dark and dank steps, and prepare to enjoy some superb beers (many rare) and chat with amazingly friendly bartenders.THE STORY: This is a hidden gem that deserves a visit on any night when you're bar hopping around the Village. The bar itself is so unassuming that at first you're not quite sure what you've gotten yourself into, but the second you sit down, embrace the dark, narrow, and intimately inspiring space, you know you've made the right decision. While decor is pretty much limited to a few rabbits painted on the walls and an old tin ceiling that could very well come down on you any minute, it all still works to create an old-world, idealized, secretive, romantic space perfect for great conversation.The staff here is also superb. The first time I was here with a friend we just sat at the bar and described the kind of beer we were looking for, and the bartender pulled out a couple spectacular Belgian bottles that answered our calls. They enjoy taking the time to talk and get to know you, making for an all around enjoyable time.Anyone could walk into the Old Rabbit Club and feel comfortable, proud that they've discovered such a secret spot. It's a great place to start, end, or just take a break from the night, and I look forward to each time I get to visit. It's just the kind of bar where I fantasize about writing the next great American novel over some solid beer.",6,1,1

The beer selection is so good it's kind of overwhelming. I sampled a raspberry lambec that I couldn't stop ordering. It was like dessert beer (so awesome!) Could be a great date spot, or just a place to hole up in and brood like an affulent Bukowski type. Drinks aren't incredibly cheap, nor expensive. But I'd only recommend coming here if you're feeling like an adventurous beer expereince. As that is clearly their strong point. I think they had like 2 or 3 wines on the menu.Oh and definitley not a good spot for groups.

You walk in to a speakeasy-like envirnonment with an intimate vibe. There' a long bar and a couple tables in the front and one in the back. The place is narrow, is dark, and can easily be crowded. But the vibe is good from the patrons & staff and the beer selection is EXCELLENT. We're talking reasonably priced very good Belgian, German, and English beers. It's a good spot for you and a couple friends getting merry while sessioning a couple of great brews. Since the place is so small, I'd not bring a large group of people here.

Not many people come in because it's hard to spot; I almost missed it even when I was looking for it.Cons: Holy bank account, Batman. Good beers are already overpriced in this city but man, their prices are too high. And I sort of felt like I was in a dirty, hipster basement. Ok, maybe that's extreme but still, it's not exactly what I""m looking for when I'm in the mood for a good, thought-provoking beer.If you're looking for a great beer place, this isn't it.

As we walked up, the hole-in-the-wall (literally) feel of the exterior had me in a tizzy.Once you get inside, that's when things started to go south. First of all, the layout of this bar is god awful. It's very narrow with a long bar and maybe 2 tables at the end of the row for groups. Unfortunately, the passageway is so narrow that if people are sitting at the bar, you can't really stand and loiter against the other wall. Because there's just no space. The space is also unusually dark, which makes reading the menu and seeing your companions somewhat challenging.We got there early enough to claim one of the tables in the back. The server was not particularly helpful in beer selection. My friend asked for an IPA recommendation, and he did not offer up any sort of description of the IPAs they had available. Although there was a pretty unique beer selection (bottles mostly), I've been to many more commercialized establishments with more impressive selection.Lastly, cash only. Normally I am not at all opposed to cash only establishments, but it was strangely inconvenient for us.If I ever find myself in the village looking for a beer spot, I will certainly hit up this place again.

118,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,3.0,9/1/2010,"I walked out of 124 Old Rabbit Club on two separate occasions before even ordering a drink. I was first drawn here as it seemed to be some word-of-mouth underground secret - both literally and figuratively. However, once inside, it felt more like a sweaty dungeon than some cool specialty beer bar. It was extremely narrow, uncomfortable, and claustrophobia-inducing - so, I high-tailed it the hell outta there.But that was on the weekend. So, on a random Tuesday, I gave it one last shot. The front door was propped open now with clear signage, so they must've let the secret out. But it was immediately refreshing to see only a handful of patrons saddled up at the bar. Without the hordes of hipsters that cram themselves in here from Thursday through Saturday, allowing themselves the same lack of privacy and personal space as rush hour strap-hangers, you can actually see that 124 Old Rabbit Club has a ton of character. And keeping that door open, with the slightest trace of light from the outside world, you know, helps the place feel less like a bomb shelter and more like the unique basement bar it strives to be.A cash-only joint, 124 has an extensive list of craft beers from Belgium, England, Germany, and the United States. I went with a Blanche de Bruxelles, a witbier brewed with spices. The bitter orange peel flavor was much appreciated on a hot, summer day, and the hint of coriander gave it a great, little kick. The bartender answered all of our specific questions, comparing similarly-sounding beers, and overall, was a pretty friendly dude. The indie rock they were pumpin' through the speakers didn't hurt, either.Needless to say, if I didn't brave the crowds the first two times around, chances of seeing me here on the weekend are slim. This is when 124 Old Rabbit Club just seems more like a fire hazard waiting to happen than anything else. Otherwise, on a weekday, this place is legit - let's just keep that door open during the warmer months while we can.Lastly, I'd be out of mind not to mention there is some sort of shrine set-up in the bathroom, where a statue of a fat baby holding his wee-wee creepily watches over you as you do your business.

The selection was extremely eclectic and not too outrageously over-priced (considering you won't find these beers anywhere else in the Village).The beer I enjoyed most was ""Old Tom's Ginger Ale"" by Robinson's. Flavorful, robust and dark, but far from overwhelming. The bartender said the selection rotates ""somewhat frequently"". Take what you will from that...The four-not-five rating comes exclusively from the hipster factor. The bartenders, while knowledgable, weren't very talkative and the music screechy at best.

If that's not what you're into, you'll hate it. If you are a beer snob (geek) like myself, and truly want to enjoy rare brews over some good conversation with your bartender or friends, this is THE spot. Despite its location amongst various college-scene bars, this place is hidden and quiet, and let's just say it, it makes you feel damn cool to know it exists.

It's so dark that you have trouble reading the menus even after your eyes have adjusted and when you leave again, the streetlights make you feel like you are staring into the sun. Somehow, it just makes the atmosphere feel more right.Probably the best part was that the owner was the one tending bar and was able to tell us anything we wanted to know about each and every beer. We had an animated discussion about east village building height laws - if you go, be sure to ask him about the story behind the t-shirt he has for sale.",,1,

A tad expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for.The one drawback is that it's expensive AND cash-only. Not good for a habitual non-cash-carrying guy like myself.

I saw Meskerem, I saw the usual college hangouts...but a bar that only served craft and imported beers? Wait...there is a door. A black door. With white lettering handwritten above the frame. And down the stairs and through the door I went into a long, narrow, dusky room. I was greeted with a smile and an empty stool.A simple sheet of parchment and candlelight was all I need to to peruse the extensive menu of Belgian, German, and UK beers. And wonder of wonders - they had Aescht! A dark, smoky, caramel stout that I call (rather stupidly) ""BBQ beer"". When I asked Nick the bartender for it, he promptly replied ""Have you had this before?"" Of course, Nick. But he had to ask, because it's not a beer for the fly-by-night beero - no, this is a taste explosion that once you have it, you'll never forget it.But I digress. (And am waxing wayyyy too poetic)The seating is intimate, with a couch hidden here and there. The lighting is dark, and conducive for close-headed conversation.

Tiny, dark, and filled with good beer and heavy music. I cannot express how much fun I had that evening... I'll just say that I didn't make it home 'til six. Zero pretension and very cozy, for lovers of fine brews and being elbow to elbow (facilitating of conversation!) with your new friends at the bar. Best if visited in smaller numbers- no room for large groups here. If you're pleasant, the very friendly bartender might acquiesce to iPod requests. If you're really, really nice, he might dance on the bar for you... ;)Funny bit: The statues of Manneken Pis decorating the water closet.",,,

The beer selection is incredible - I had an amazing pumpkin ale on draft, an evil twin falcon and a spaten ocktoberfest. The service was great - there was a  laconic new guy behind the bar who looked like Julian Casablancas who just nodded and an engaging bartender who knew what was up whilst training his new beer disciple. This place reminded me of a few pubs in Brussels and there even is a Manneken Pis in the bathroom! The ambiance was very cool, laid back and gothic with candles and Edison bulbs providing the light.

A couple of tables lay strewn just as you enter, and there are little seats by the bar all the way to the back. On your way to the back, you'll notice little nooks and crannies into which people, large and small, have ensconced themselves. At the very back, grunge meets classy in a chandelier lit corner, with ornate velvet paper adorning the walls. It's all a bit carefully careless. The one-page beer menu at this little rabbit hole is kind of like the space in a way, quite constrained. They're not trying to go all crazy like rattle and hum or downtown bar and grill. What it lacks in variety though, it makes up in quality.The brews are mostly belgian, and usually excellent. Tell me you tried the St. Bernadus and the Rochefort 10 and did not love it, and I won't believe you. The bartenders are understated and perceptive, which is a nice complement to with the mood and the music of the Old Rabbit Hole (Yep, I refuse to call it the rabbit club).I don't even recall the number of times my husband and I have dropped in for a couple while we're in the area, and nor do I remember the last time I got to plonk myself on a seat without a bit of a struggle.

The bartender was GREAT, for a place that carries a ton of unique - primarily Belgian - (bottled) imports, he clearly knew his stock.

As you've read in the various other reviews, the menu is pretty comprehensive, and even if you're not a beer expert, the bartenders are laid back and ready to help without making you feel inadequate.  I've brought people here and they've been blown away by the mix of incredibly niche beers and some of the best craft beers out there. It's a wonderful place to bring someone who truly loves beer, as their face will light up instantly.There are only 3 tables  - two small tables in the front and one larger table that holds around 5 all the way in the back, near the bathroom. The bar holds maybe around 15 people and there are two ""window seats"" that are so tight that barely two people fit in them.

Meaning there is a bar, made of wood, and like three small tables and that's it. Came here on a Tuesday night around 1030 for a post-dinner birthday celebratory drink. Bartender was uber-nice and nice to chat with. I felt like the place smelled like the old ski shop back home I would rent my skis from as a kid. Like wax. Must have been the candles. Anyway, it lent a certain ski-chalet type vibe to the beer and wine only establishment. Also, it was 19 degrees and freezing rain outside, so that could have been part of my Swiss Alps-nostalgia moment. I'm not a huge drinker to begin with and they serve no food. So come here to drink and that's about it. I had a Belgian beer...I think. It had a hint of apricot! (Did that make me sound like I know what I'm talking about?)  Clearly I'm not a beer expert. Our bartender kindly discounted my beer 50% in honor of my birthday. We in turn tipped him 50% for asking me if it was my 25th birthday. Why, er, yes! Yes, sir it is!",,2,1
176,Rob M.,"Cranford, NJ",14,43,1,5.0,8/13/2010,"To counter  a few other reviews, 124 Old Rabbit Club is certainly NOT a 'dive bar'.  What is it? A great mainly belgium beer bar with knowledgeable bartenders in the most dank, and perhaps frightening, confined space in all of NYC.Surrounded by the horror that is modern day MacDougal  Street, 124 Rabbit's entrance is a sign-less, plain door, a few steep steps below street level. Once inside, your eyes need a few seconds to adjust to the lack of light. It's probably better that way- one can only imagine what lurks there after hours when the place is closed. A few small tables take up the front and far back, but for the most part, the narrow space is taken up by a long bar. If the bar is full, there are some nooks where you can grab a seat....  your ears will suddenly tune in to a great mix of music- taken from the bartender's ipod. The beer selection is usually about 75% belgium, with some German, English, and the occasional American micro-brew. The bartenders are always very friendly, and will take the time to discuss different beers and make suggestions. Without a  doubt, 124  is a beer drinker's bar -  you're not there for the scene, to pick anyone up, or to watch the game - you're there to drink. Just be careful when you depart into the street light a few hours later - those 9% brews hit hard.",2,,3

179,Andrew D.,"Silver Spring, MD",159,307,7,5.0,6/18/2010,"When I finally took a look inside the dank dungeon that turned out to be the Old Rabbit Club, my heart was set a-flutter and I was overcome by delusions of mad experiments and apocalyptic prophesies. It might have been the atmosphere that did it, but I think it was really just the beer.I am a great big fan of any place that is run by lovers of their particular art. 124 Old Rabbit Club is just that... a bar for beer connoiseurs that stocks a dizzying array of craft beers from around the world. Their offerings are primarily from Belgium and Germany, but there are other international gems splattered throughout the ever-changing list. When I stopped in, I drained an imperial pint of Moorhouse's Black Cat, a smooth and rich beer that must be brewed by insane monks, gibbering blasphemies in the dark.Speaking of the dark, the bar is appropriately moody and dim, with few adornments on the brick walls that were surely never designed for observation by common men. The bar itself is a gorgeous slab of woodwork, fitted up with recycled beer bottles--cut in half--for candles (the only real source of light in the place) and low refrigerators behind the bar to hold the important stock of future candle holders.The bartenders are unobtrusive, showing up when you need them and always knowledgeable about the list of beverages they present. Despite the post-apocalyptic feel of the place, it is inviting and almost warm. It is where the cool survivors of the zombie apocalypse would hang out. Yes.And last, I should mention that the music is very good. Loud enough to tune out everyone if you don't want to talk, but not too loud that you have to shout to be heard. When I walked in the place with Kiran G., they were blaring the Black Angels, an absoultely marvelous band from Austin that plays intense, droning rock songs about murder, war, betrayal and regret. A fitting introduction to the Old Rabbit Club.",4,2,3

Look for the subterranean black door next to Ali Baba's and you will have struck gold in terms of yeasty, hoppy refreshment. From the felt damask wall paper, blacked out brick, brass bar and broken beer bottle votives, much of the decor here suggests industrial victorian goth. And owing to its inconspicuous exterior on the street, one might be tempted to brand this haunt a 'beer-easy.' But it is an unpretentious spot with a charming, intimate ambiance. A visit to the restroom is a must here if only to pay homage to the 'golden boy' figurine inside!The beer list is compact with a focus on brews from Belgium, England and Germany along with some choice American suds thrown in for good measure. It's a smaller menu than some other pubs in town but the selection changes regularly and you can be assured that each bottle or draft has been thoughtfully chosen. You needn't miss your Stella Artois- no need to feign European class with those corporate brews here! If you are having trouble navigating  the diverse menu, the friendly staff here are astute enough to suggest something according to your tastes. Malty, fruity, sour, crisp...you name it. Drew, the owner is an impish fellow who often has a good anecdote for every bottle or draft. My friends and I have really enjoyed mining his inner beer geek during our visits.

183,Jane D.,"New York, NY",96,238,31,4.0,3/15/2010,"This isn't your typical drinking hole with an unmarked door. You won't need to call a secret phone number, ""dress to impress"" or sweet talk a bouncer to get in. In fact, on a recent, rainy weekend night, a friend and I walked in without a wait at all at 9:30 (though the bar filled up quickly after we arrived). 124 Old Rabbit Club is non-pretentious, pleasantly divey and chock full of fanfrakkin'tastic beer. The beer selection is extensive, weighing in with around 75 menu offerings and a few more off-menu specials. About half are Belgian, a quarter German, a quarter English, Irish and Scottish; five are domestic. In addition to breweries / beers that even I recognize (i.e. Duvel, Chimay, Delerium Tremens, Old Speckled Hen, Young's, Hofbrau and Schneider), you can also order more esoteric options like Eedwarde Pater (listed as a dark sour beer), Brouwerij De Ranke's seasonal Père Noël, and an Aecht Schlekera marzen, etc... It is true that many of the beers here are pretty spendy. But there are a decent number of beers available for less than $10, too -- and they're far more interesting than most you'll find in that price range elsewhere in Manhattan. I tried two Flanders red ales, or ""sour reds"" as they're labeled on the menu. The first, a Rodenbach, was very fruity and sweet, almost lambic-like in style and a very reasonable $7. The second, ordered off menu and aged in French oak barrels previously used for aging wine according to our bartender, was much brawnier, with a heavier, darker flavor and much higher alcohol content. It rang in at $20. The owner (who I think introduced himself as Andrew or Drew) works the bar himself and he is clearly passionate about his beers. This is the kind of place where I'd love to go when it's slow and quiet just to ask lots of questions and learn. Talking to this guy is better than taking a beer tasting course at Artisinal. As others have noted, the bathroom (pretty clean for a bar) does have an odd little shrine: A nekkid urinating cupid stands amongst a pile of bottle caps. It's all set behind bars and backlit a golden yellow. Not sure what it means, but whatever it is, I'm probably in favor.",6,3,7

There is also a small wine list, though I have yet to sample its delights. The music is good, the crowd unpretentious.
