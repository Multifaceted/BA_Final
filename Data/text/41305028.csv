We also had the Rioja by the glass... thrice. And obviously loved it. The host was patient as I tried to find my date (for like an hour). The tables were super tight and very dark. I asked once for a change in seating, as mine was facing the door/freezing air.",,,

2,Monnie S.,"Columbus, OH",2,45,68,4.0,10/21/2018,"Trendy restaurant adjacent to the Library Hotel in New York City. I can see the New York Public Library from my table.had a Sunday brunch BAC (Bacon, lettuce and avocado) which was quite tasty. My only complaint would be that the maple bacon was not fried fresh so it was a bit rubbery.  The eggs were fried perfectly and the combination of avocado, gruyere, spur dough, lettuce and micro greens was perfect. The coffee was good but was not as hot as I prefer.",,,

4,Jeff H.,"San Francisco, CA",577,512,451,5.0,1/15/2018,"During our latest trip to the Big Apple the week leading up to Thanksgiving we decided to walk back to our hotel (Hyatt at Grand Central) after our show in the theater district.  We decided we wanted a nightcap but aren't really fans of the bar at the hotel.  And while we love Campbell Apartment and Raines Law Room, we wanted a quieter place to relax (Campbell gets crowded/noisy) and didn't know if we could get in right away (Raines prefers reservations).   So doing a quick look-up on Yelp while walking, I found M&V to be near the hotel and we decided to give it a shot.We walked in to find a light crowd, warm décor (nice for a cold night), and a friendly staff.  We sat at the bar, though tables were available, and started with a cocktail - a Madison & Vine wine cocktail for my SO and a Barrel Aged Manhattan for myself.  Both were flavorful and well prepared and while drinking and talking we looked at the wine list and menu.  The wine selection was solid with a nice assortment offered by the glass.  We didn't order anything to eat, but saw a few items on the menu that interested me for a future visit.The bartender was friendly and held a nice conversation without being intrusive.  He also told us about the Thanksgiving Lunch (which we planned on coming for but ended up elsewhere) and the bar at the top of the attached hotel (Bookmarks) - it was a separate bar but run by the same company.  Side note, I went up there for a look around and added it to my list of places to try (thus I bookmarked Bookmarks).We moved on to a glass of wine and as mentioned they have a good selection.  I can't remember which ones we ordered but both were quite good.We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.  Maybe start with a cocktail at Bookmarks and then move downstairs to M&V for dinner.",3,1,2

8,Denise M.,"Medford, MA",164,370,172,3.0,1/28/2017,"I loved the atmosphere and vibe with the beautiful woodwork throughout the restaurant. The food was given mixed reviews but the wine selection was great. It was early Saturday night without a reservation but we were able to get a seat, not many people at 5:30pm.Checking in on Yelp I was happy to see there was an offer for a free appetizer but the server said they were no longer accepting those offers which I thought odd but we were ordering regardless so just went with the flow. Just be mindful if you check in and they decline to honor the Yelp offer. I don't know why they didn't notify Yelp. We ordered the Artisanal Cheeses with Toasted Croutons, Fig Marmalade and Apricot Jamto share. The accompaniments on the cheese plate were great! If I could remember the cheeses I would share but my memory is fading. My two companions liked the cheese as well. I ordered the Roasted Organic Chicken with Fingerling Potatoes and Shallot Hash with Applewood Smoked Bacon, Wholegrain Mustard Jus. It was at the waiters insistence and I was happy I did. It was good, actually really good. I know the reviews are A-OK but if my companions had been happy with their meals this review would have been given a higher rating.They shared an order of the Pipe Rigate Short Rib Bolognes with San Marzano Tomato, Sheep's Milk Whipped Ricotta, Lemon Zest. They were less than impressed. Much to my disappointment because I wanted to give this a higher rating.It's a great place for a drink or if you are ok with a hit or miss meal then go for it and try your luck. I would return again but doubt my friends would be willing to return. Not with so many options for those who eat gluten.",,,

The menu is a little pricey, but it's midtown Manhattan so you can't really expect anything to be cheap here. I come here only on special occasions but I always get my favorites. Crab cakes appetizer and a Bloody Mary. And I get great service every time.I brought my grandparents here last time and they loved it too. A great place to go to for any type of crowd.",,,
10,Lisa R.,"Navarre, FL",39,313,181,3.0,2/20/2018,A nice elegant atmosphere. Kind of pricey and there is nothing really spectacular on the menu. We had breakfast there and it was really good but not worth the high price it's the high price.,1,,

13,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",270,122,1,3.0,5/14/2017,"FYI - the check-in deal (free cheeseboard with purchase of a bottle of wine) is no longer offered, according to the wait staff. A girlfriend and I needed someplace to hold up for an hour or so before checking out the Chihuly exhibit at the NYBG, and Madison & Vine was the only option available near Grand Central. Not many people at the place on a Sat afternoon, so works well if you're looking to chat (which we were). We only had the cheeseboard & a glass of wine each, so can't comment on their food offerings.Two stars off for the following reasons:1. The check-in deal no longer being offered -- we were stoked, then subsequently disappointed, seeing that it was exactly what we wanted (and ended up ordering). 2. No labels or descriptions for the cheeses on the menu or the board itself, nor any provided by the wait staff.",1,,

He was attentive and  accommodating.  My friends enjoyed their meals (Steak Salad and Crab Cakes). We all really enjoyed the Calamari.  My meal was...ok, at best. I had the Kale Ceasar Salad with the Seared Tuna. There was way too much dressing on the salad for my taste. I should have had the dressing on the side because the Kale was limp and greasy, but it tasted like authentic Ceasar dressing (right down to the Anchovies). My side was the Macaroni au Gratin (without the ""crumbs""). It was really good. I washed it all down with two glasses of Laurent Perrier, Brut.",,,

17,Nora F.,"Sunnyside, NY",80,625,4622,4.0,4/18/2017,"Quiet on weekends! One thing to give away is the truffle salt has done it again! Order that fries with truffle salt. Although you don't eat the fries, you have the salt! You know you can't go wrong with truffle. Since we couldn't order from upstairs Bookmarks (rooftop lounge) we came downstairs here to have a bite. Since I didn't have a lot that evening except the chicken tacos from another bar, I ordered this killer fries (although I hardly eat fries) with that crazy salt and munched on it. I also tried the salad that my friend had. Wow! Both salad and fries were above average. We had Aaron the bartender. Ok, I gave him above average service too because it was late and he didn't mind serving at this late hour. The restaurant was quite empty, only 2 occupied tables plus us at the bar. My friend loved that fries, she ordered twice. She told me about the food here and I thought since she loves food anything goes but not really, the food here is really good. Maybe I'll try other dishes next time and then go upstairs Bookmarks lounge and read. Nice!",,,

20,Priscilla F.,"Hoboken, NJ",7,7,1,2.0,11/17/2016,"I'm being kind with the two stars, the stars are for the food as the cook should get credit. The service is horrible when it comes to the waiter.First: I asked if there's any California Cabernet wine and I quote the waiter ""thats not good wine"" I proceed to say do you have any Napa Valley, Sonoma or Alexander Valley wines and I quote again ""thats not good wine"" I was speechless obviously the staff knows nothing about wine and should be trained not to insult wine connoisseurs when they order. They don't have any California wines by the glass because as the waiter stated more then once ""its not good wine"" I mentioned if they had Simi or Alexander Valley wines he said ""those are not good wines"" obviously has no idea about wine other then what Management must push to sell. Second: I asked if the Sorbet desert comes with the 3 favors and he said no one scoop, so I order the one favor since he assured me its only one scoop for $8, when the desert came I had 3 scoops of the same flavor. I went to this place despite the low stars and bad reviews about the service to give it a chance since it was mid way to the person i was meeting for lunch.Trust and believe the reviews, if you are a wine connoisseur go to a real wine bar where the staff is educated about the wine and where they offer California wine (tasteful wine) and don't criticize what type of wine you drink as bad wine.",,3,1
21,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2208,8237,3.0,5/28/2014,"Cute place with pricey but tasty drinks and a nice menu.  Plus, it apparently makes you look good.Had a date here that was just going to be for a drink but apparently I'm so charming, he wanted to continue our conversation so we ended up getting some food.  We had the charcuterie plate and the cheese plate.  Both were very nice.  Not as good as what I had at Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto  a few weeks ago, but just as pricey.The atmosphere is pleasant, it's not too loud and service was friendly, although not a lot of follow up. Bill for two drinks total, the meat plate and the cheese plate was $67 so this place ain't cheap.  But the lighting must be good and the drinks must be strong because I got a second date out of it, so I'm contributing some of that to Madison & Vine.",,4,1

I mentioned about that to the bartender and he didn't say a word and just changed the glass. Really? No apology? I was a bartender before and checking glasses before pouring drink is normal routine especially at place like this expensive. Sure, people make mistakes and this kind of thing happens and fine.

We had a cheese plate (way too much cheese that cuts into your appetite), and I had a burger on ""brioche"" bun that was great but nothing exceptional. I don't agree with people who say the service staff was bad, though. I found them very attentive and friendly, and the food was definitely passable. It just didn't meet P2Q expectations (Price2Quality). Decor does not reverse things enough to provide a mystique that clouds one's judgment.",1,1,1

26,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,589,852,3.0,5/5/2015,"This is also a neighborhood I tend to stay far away from. The picking around this part of the city is slim unless you want Irish Pubs, Massage parlours but then that's not really eats I suppose. It was  a dimly lit room with soft music. Easy enough for conversation or romantic dinner depending upon your mood.Madison & Wine looked like comfortable reasonable spot for dinner to celebrate my friend's new luxury apartment in the sky (rental). The clientele looked like a cross between hotel guests who didn't want to venture far, gaggles of girls ready to go party afterwards and locals after work in the neighborhood. We got a table quickly by the friendly host.We started with the warm artichoke and spinach dip with plenty of chips to share. I thought it was pretty good and usually there are never enough chips but in this case it was more than plenty. I like that. I decided to try the meatloaf. It is something I don't make and I don't even remember the last time I had some. Plus it was a chilly night so some comfort food seems about right. My fellow to be New Yorker who still really NJ but hey it's a start got the ravioli. The ravioli was kind of bland seasoning wise, the pasta was a bit firm  but the filling was quite nice. The meatloaf was seasoned well and had a good texture. It was the right pick for the evening.Madison & Wine satisfied the dinner requirement and was an enjoyable meal in a subdue ambiance to enjoy the food and company.",2,,2

29,Susan L.,"Columbus, OH",0,5,0,2.0,12/25/2017,"This restaurant is connected to the Library Hotel by a glass door in the lobby of the hotel. It supposedly provides room service but it is closed today, Christmas Day. I don't think that most people should work on Christmas day but the area has only one or two restaurants nearby. I have trouble walking more than a few hundred feet but I would feel silly ordering a cab for the half block or so that would take me to the next closest restaurant, which may or may not be open today, either. That said, I have had two room service orders which have been complicated by erroneous information on the menu and in the hotel info book which states that room service is available every day from 11am to 10:30pm. On the day that I arrived, I called to place a lunch order for delivery at 3:15 pm in accordance with the menu which states that the lunch menu is available until 4pm. I called and after the phone was eventually answered and placed a lunch order. I then received a call from the hotel desk clerk informing that the restaurant was closed for dinner prep and I would not be receiving my food. I eventually received my order by repeatedly pointing out the bad information in two hotel provided sources. It happened again the next day when I tried to use room service for breakfast and went through the same rigamarole. It seems that there is a brunch menu that the hotel had not placed in my room. Today, I followed all the rules only to be told that the restaurant is closed today. I only stay at hotels that have room service available because I have substantial mobility issues. Neither the hotel nor the restaurant provided acceptable service. I had to argue the issue that there were people in the kitchen who could make a hamburger which is on both the lunch and dinner menus. They eventually sent me a raw hamburger (I had requested a     medium fry) between two slices of brioche-style bread. The burger was only mildly warm and the bottom layer of bread had disintegrated due to the bloody meat and cooking liquids. The ""deluxe"" was fresh and plentiful and the fries, also lukewarm, were okay and the dipping sauce was excellent. The eggs benedict that I received the next day was also lukewarm but otherwise nicely cooked and flavorful.   On the whole. my poor experiences were more the hotel's fault but I would have sent back the raw burger if I hadn't been concerned that an annoyed kitchen staff might spit on the second burger because everyone seemed annoyed that I expected the service that the hotel and the restaurant had offered. Nor would I have ordered a second meal from them or counted on eating there this afternoon if I had had an alternative that wouldn't have left me too fatigued to enjoy the shows that I came here to see.",,,
30,Pracheta T.,"Easton, PA",44,661,83,4.0,7/11/2016,"Lovely spot. Stopped here for an afternoon drink while meeting a friend. The openness of the place is what really stood out.

The food is ok, but I have yet to order something I can rave about.The restaurant itself both physically and aesthetically cold. The first time I dined here, I got the chopped salad with chicken. It looked like a pre-packaged salad that you could purchase at a grocery store. I've also tried the grilled chicken paillard, the roasted organic chicken, the turkey club sandwich, and the seasonal vegetables. None of them were bad, but none of them were great. My favorite was the chicken paillard, but that too left something to be desired. I will probably end up returning with colleagues, but if you're looking for an outstanding lunch this is not a place I'd recommend.",,,

They had several wait staff and a hostess. We gave our orderr which was simple..one salmon dinner and. one cheese plate.  The waiter brought over a roll for each of us. My husband and I chatted, a while and about 15 minutes later several food orders came up for other patrons.Several other guests arrived at the restaurant and were seated near us. We continue to chat and started looking up information about the Madison and Vine restaurant iand the Library Hotel while the three waiters continued  chatting together in the corner not once coming by our table. except to seat a new guest and take their orders. Food continued to come out being placed on tables of people who arrived after us.  We called over the hostess because our waiter was deep in conversation with the other waiters.   She requested that our waiter come see us.  Our waiter looked over to us, and seemed  to be discussing our order with the other waiters.  He then went over to the POS system and looked to be ringing in an order.  Finally he came over to us and said it would be iout shortly.  My husband asked to see the manager and told him.. we had been waiting for our food for over 45 minutes and everyone in the restaurant were finishing their meals (more tha one course).....The manager's response when hearing this was a flippant (not anyway any way apologetic) ""sorry guys"".   We come to New York several times a year, stay in nice hotels, eat nice food.  This restaursnt""s treatment  of guests was subpar & is not recommended.",4,,

We all wanted to grab an early dinner and they found this place so we met them there. I got the beet salad at $17 with added chicken for an extra $5. There were 4 tiny pieces of beet and the chicken was shaved and more like a garnish. There were about 6 pieces of the thinnest sliced chicken I've ever seen in my life. There was supposed to be a goat cheese cream on the salad and there was the skimpiest schmear of it on my plate. The presentation was lovely but there was no substance and we were famished an hour later. I don't know this neighborhood but it seemed like a total tourist trap to me. The cocktails were good and the service was fine which is the only reason I'm giving any stars at all,,,

However, it took forever for our food to come. I order the lamb sandwich and my boss had the turkey club. I felt like the food was just okay to be so pricey. My boss mentioned that her turkey was very dry. We decided that we wanted to share a dessert so we chose the brownie with ice cream. We were expecting to see at least an actual square part of a brownie and when they brought out the dessert it was so small we could not share. Again, the restaurant was just okay nothing to be blown away with. P.S. be sure to make a reservation as this place is extremely small. I can't imagine having to stand around and wait to be seated as it is that cramped in the restaurant.",,,
38,Billy S.,"Staten Island, NY",3,68,0,1.0,12/28/2016,"I pass this place regularly being that it is by my office.  My girlfriend and I decided to stop in here after seeing a play and visiting the Christmas Village at Bryant Park. To be able to get a table on a weekend night during the height of Christmas season should have been a warning to the slop fest that was about to ensue.The place was decorated for the holidays, which was a nice touch.  A couple of empty tables scattered through the place.. With that said  the service was lacking.  I order a Manhattan, and it is fine.  My girlfriend asks for sangria. The waitress shows her that there are 3 types of Sangria available, Red, White, and a bourbon sangria.  She asks for the red.  About 2 sips into it, we realize that there is bourbon in it.  My girlfriend who is not a big drinker, just wanted their red sangria.  When we asked the waitress, she said both the red and the bourbon sangria have bourbon, but she can ""ask them to make one without bourbon""..  This is either piss poor menu design or a waitress who couldn't admit an oversight was made, and we had been given the wrong drink.  I respect honesty.  They replace it, and it is super carbonated and super sweet, unlike any sangria I have ever tasted... not in a good way.Next comes the food.  I get their burger which was tasty.  No complaints. Nothing ground breaking, but a burger rarely is.  My girlfriend asks for the beet and goat cheese salad with chicken.  Her salad comes out, missing beets and the goat cheese.  How can you leave out the 2 ingredients that are in the dishes name?They waitress apologizes, and then brings out a creamy goat cheese dressing.  When she asked about the beets, the waitress points to what appears to be radishes and says those are the beets.  We tasted them, and they were unlike any beet I have ever encountered in my 40 years on this planet. They had the consistency of a radish The waitress said they are ""ribbon beets"".  Fair enough.  Perhaps I do not know about ""ribbon beets"" and the eclectic offerings of this fine establishment, and how they are nothing like normal beets, in both taste and consistency.  But one would assume that if the restaurant  was going to put some type of oddball beet in the beet salad, they would mention that in the description.Moments later, the busboy comes and clears the plates and says to my lady, ""you didn't like the Cobb Salad?""  My reply was, ""I thought this was the beet and goat cheese salad.""  He shakes his head and brings over a manager who apologizes.  (Full disclosure this looked nothing like a cobb salad either)Being that my girlfriend has not eaten, we order some crab cakes.  The gentleman apologized again, and said ""we will give you the good ones"".  Are there 2 types of crab cakes?  Either way, they come out, seem okay.This place had a weird vibe from the moment we walked in.  My girlfriend and I eat out probably 2-3 a week, and over the course of many years, have never sent a dish back. I mean NEVER. My point is she is not picky and if you saw me, it would certainly be obvious I am not either.  Honestly, I should have come prepared and made a reservation at a Benjamin or even the Andaz's downstairs bar.  Hell, heartland brewery would have been a better choice.Pass. Run don't walk away from this place.",,,

Service has always been really good and attentive every time I am here with coworkers or friends.  Their lunch time menu is nice and quite pricy (about $17 for a sandwich) but the quality is tops.

The food and drink prices are fair for the location $12-$40.  Now for the food:  The Grilled Chicken with potatoes was delicious, the chicken was moist with a crispy outer skin, honestly I could have ordered another piece it was that good. My co-worker had the Mussels App in garlic &  wine sauce that she enjoyed.  The bread they served was also delicious, it was Italian with a crispy outer layer and soft inside, served with olive oil for dipping.   The staff could not be any nicer.  The Only problem I found was that the restrooms were downstairs.  I definitely will come back to Madison & Vine especially since they are located right up the block from were I work :-)*The only reason I am giving this place 4 Stars is because of were the restrooms are located.",,,
43,Cristina F.,"Weehawken, NJ",18,166,44,4.0,5/7/2015,"I like this place. Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and it's one of those places where you always get the same quality of food and service. The ambiance is really nice and mature ( think dimly lit, low music so that you can hear yourself talk, outdoor seating, bar). The restaurant is part of the super cute library hotel. The hotel has a nice rooftop bar as well that you can go to after dinner if you fancy. We shared the mixed green salad and our entrees were the steak and organic roasted chicken. Though a little over cooked, the chicken was so flavorful and the portion size perfect. Madison and Vine offers a bit of downtown in midtown / grand central area and is also located off to the side on a more quiet street. If you need a good place for a date, catch up with a friend, business dinner or quick bite at the bar on your own, I think you would be happy with this choice.",,,

The menu was limited. The service was ok. The room a little loud. My lunch was all about time visiting with my long-lost friend and, for that, the setting was fine.

Enjoyed the lobster bisque (heartwarming) and the penne bolognese (fulfilling); perfect for the brisk NY autumn.

It is small but very comfortable during lunch with the outside seating. The only reason I gave 4 stars is based on the price and the portions, the fix price lunch portions are pretty small and it is a little expansive.  I never been there for dinner but I would not pick it as a dinner spot because it is small and the location to be sitting outside for dinner is not very attractive.",1,,
57,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,1158,545,3.0,5/11/2012,"Here are some quick tips: Check-in via Yelp app to get a free cheese platter if you order a bottle of wine bet 3-6pm. Or Check in via four-square to get a free glass of wine IF you become the Mayor. (ha!)While none of the check-in offers really helped me, I still enjoyed their lunch entrees. Their lunch menu varies from fine dining cuisines (i.e.,seafood) to classic comfort foods (i.e., mac n cheese and pulled pork sandwiches). The restaurant tailors to mostly people working around the area especially during the lunch hours. Portion-wise, they are very generous. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with sweet potato fries and in the end, I had to pack it to go. The pulled pork was slathered with BBQ sauce and cole slaw. It was literally stuffed with amazing and delicious goodness. The pork itself was tender and sweet.  It's a little expensive but the amount of food you get makes it pretty reasonable. The service was quick but I also felt they kind of rushed you since this place is a popular lunch spot and tables are a bit limited. If you want a slow and relaxing lunch, you may need to wait later in the afternoon.",,,

The lamb was quite tender and the sandwich had the perfect balance of moisture with the spread which made it soft and easy to eat. Bread wasn't too hard, which I like. I was able to substitute the fries at no extra charge. Cons:I think for the cost of lunch the quality wasn't on par. Lamb sandwich $18. Coworkers turkey club $15.  It was a tasty lunch but the salad was a mixed mesclun salad blend tossed in a balsamic dressing. Simple enough. Also the service was a little slow especially for the lunch hour. It's a small space so I'm not sure why the waiter wasn't a bit more attentive. I will likely try once more though for dinner and wine. Tip:They are mostly reservations I believe for lunch due to the space. If you're doing a walk on come on the earlier side. Non reserved seating was at the bar and outside space only.",,,

It's a small venue with an older/more dated feel to it. The menu seemed somewhat limited but I don't know if that was because they were offering Sunday Brunch. Maybe they have a more extensive menu the rest of the week. Anyway, I had the Madison and Vine salad which was great! Huge chunks of cooked bacon with eggs, sun dried tomatoes and avocado. Very tasty. My mom had their BBQ chicken sandwich with fries which she really enjoyed. We had a bottle of white wine. I have two small complaints. First, they should really offer wines that are maybe less than $45/bottle. I mean that was the least expensive (for white)?!? I guess NYC prices but I would have liked to see something is the high $30 range too. Second, I asked a server for salt which he brought but then 4 minutes later asked if I was done with it and gave it to another table?!? LOL A little odd - do they not have more than one salt shaker?!? Anyway, overall food was good. Did the trick. If you are in the area and want a casual spot, then this fits the bill.",1,,

When I got here, I checked in and saw there was a check in offer (free plate of cheese with a bottle of wine? awesome!). Unfortunately, we didn't buy any wine, but that didn't stop us from having a wonderful experience. As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the hostess who apologized because there were no window seats. It was 12 degrees Fahrenheit outside, so we were ecstatic that we were sitting as far away from the window as possible. We ordered truffle fries as appetizers and they were AMAZING. I had never had these before and my friend said that it would be an ""experience"" so I went for it. First thought: where have I been all my life? After the fries, my macaroni au gratin came out (yeah, carb overload) and it was awesome. I'm a huge fan of bacon and a giant fan of mac and cheese so the fact that both of these things were in the dish really convinced me. We were here on a Thursday night at around 7 and there were a lot of people, but that didn't stop us from getting really good service.

Nothing could be opened until those had been sold. This is only the second time this has ever happened to me. I started to get up, and the menu was pulled from me.So 1: You couldn't sell me a $15 glass of wine from a bottle that cost you no more than $25.     2: You couldn't profit on the food as well  -I went down the block and ran up a $65 lunch check     3: I won't step foot in again, even though I visit periodically across the street      4: I will tell all the people nearby what happened--so you lose their business       5: And social media postSmart thinking bartender!!!

It is winter so the windows are closes, but I believe that they open the windows during warmer months.I really enjoyed the food, and the servers were very nice to me. The prix fixe dinner was a great, although it did not come with a dessert-which I thought was a typical practice. The prix fixe dinner did, however, come with a glass of wine if one wanted. I had the Scallops for an appetizer and the burger for the main course. The scallops with the glaze was delicious and the burger was good. The burger was a little more well done than I would have liked, but it was still good. I chose the burger because there was a blurb about it being award winning, but I would like to go back and try the other foods. One of the other people in our party had the ravioli, and they looked wonderful. She said they were delicious, but I don't fully know since I didn't try one. I plan on going back and try the non-burger foods sometime later. I did order dessert. I got the cookies. They were good, but how can anyone ever go wrong with warm chocolate chip cookies? They are a dessert to share thought. When I ordered it, I thought I would get one cookie. I got three good sized cookies, which called for sharing. our waitress was great, the only thing is that I didn't recognize her as waitstaff. I don't think there was a dress code for the staff. When she came to the table, I thought she was someone's friend coming late to the gather. All in all, I enjoyed the food and evening. I would recommend this as a lovely group gathering place, although it is small. It a little loud for a date night, but that's a product of the materiality of the space. Still, it's a nice place.",,,

At the end of the night, they charged us an extra bottle. I normally don't check the bill, but good thing I did. We brought it up to the manager and they easily just took it off our bill.

Excellent service, excellent selection, excellent atmosphere. Note to the Ladies: do not, I repeat, do not wear 3 inch heels and try to descend the steep, twisty, creaky stairs to go to the restroom after drinking 2 glasses of Grüner Veltliner (or any other wine) prior to your pre-Theater dinner. Bad move. But I made it on time and in tact. I made it. The ascent was as good as any stairmaster workout I've ever had, too!I'm a fan of Madison & Vine and will definitely return.",,,
94,Holly C.,"New York, NY",409,1256,5,3.0,1/14/2011,"Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, but if someone I knew made reservations here & asked for my opinion, I wouldn't rush them to cancel their reservation. I made dinner reservations at 6:30 PM on a Tuesday night for 2. We had arrived 30 minutes early. Luckily it wasn't busy yet so we were seated right away. There was a coat rack where we could leave our coats - good thing because the seating was a little tight. We were seated near the back, in between two other tables, but I was less than an arm's length away from both tables on either side - that was a little uncomfortable, but what can you do. The rest of the restaurant was fairly dead (aside from the bar which was busy) so it would have been nice to have been seated more comfortably (isn't that hostess training 101? I only worked at Friendly's restaurant & even I knew that).The hostess was nice though, so I won't penalize them too much for that.The waiter greeted us right away and offered us some water while we looked at their menu. I asked which red wine he suggested as I am a merlot kind of girl and my boyfriend prefers white or cabernet. He suggested either the Barbera or Grenache. He offered a taste of both. We opted for the Barbera (Barbera Cascina Adelaide 'Le Mie Donne' 2006; Alba, Piedmont; Italy). What sold me on the Barbera was the finish - it lingered less and had less of a tang.We were then offered some bread - sourdough or whole grain. Neither were noteworthy (I know it's just bread but some places have deeeelicious bread). After reading reviews, we had to order the mac & cheese. I defintely recommend it. I would say it's almost as good as the mac & cheese at Cafeteria.My boyfriend ordered the NY strip steak, medium rare, but it came out medium. Overall, the steak wasn't bad for its price. I ordered the Grilled chicken pillard which wasn't bad either, but nothing that was overly exciting. We split a passion fruit sorbet which was a nice way to end the dinner.Luckily we had a $50 gift certificate that was purchased at a cost of $25 (thank you opentable.com!). Because of that, it was worth going to.",1,,2

104,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",686,1303,3044,3.0,5/13/2010,"Walking around Grand Central Station in search of a quality sit-down restaurant is a nearly futile exercise.  With all of the high-rise office buildings in the area, it is unfathomable that all of those people make it through their work week on salads, sandwiches, and pizza.  Yet, they must.  After a good 20 minute walk, the only place we found was Madison and Vine, and while packed, it was hardly great.  At Madison and Vine, they offer a 2-course prix fixe lunch for $25.  The menu is limited and largely includes American fare, but I was able to settle on a couple of Italian selections.  I began with the fried calamari for the appetizer and chose the pappardelle bolognese for the main course.  Both courses were impressively large!  So much so, I was unable to finish both courses in this very ambitious prix fixe lunch.  The calamari was lightly fried and was generally pretty good, save for the slight taste of flour suggesting slightly uneven frying.  The pasta dish was okay.  I found the noodles to be light and wonderful -- great taste.  However, the bolognese sauce needed work.  It was too salty, and it was difficult to pick up other flavors in the sauce.  For example, the natural sweetness of the carrots was completely missed.  The classic balance in the sauce was just missed all together, though the presentation was elegant.  Also the amount of sauce used was much too liberal to be considered authentic.  For a midtown lunch it is fine, but at this price point one can stand to do quite a bit better.   For example, the Michelin starred restaurant Anthos offers a 3-course prix fixe menu for lunch for $28 that is leaps and bounds beyond in quality than what is available here.  As such, I can not honestly recommend the place.  Even the service was minimal, so there is no personal touch that would endear the place to the would be eater.  Pass.2.75 stars (rounded up)",6,2,4

Tonight I decide to try it in spite of several concerning Yelp reviews.  I asked to taste a wine before purchase which I would normally do even if the wines weren't $14 a glass. The bartenders attitude was reluctant but obliged. I chose the wine. Then a chopped salad and the side Mac n cheese. The salad was nice enough but not outstanding. The mac n cheese was too salty. Then I found ham all throughout it. I explained to the bartender that I didn't see there was ham. He quickly pointed out the menu is clear. Fine.. I was wrong. When the bill came, he not only charged me for it when I didn't eat any of it but charged me the entree price and not the side dish price. When I pointed out I would pay for it since it was my mistake but not the entree price, he then proceeded to tell me that I did order the entree size ( he must be a mind reader) When I point out his terrible customer service (and politely as I am a lady) he was indignant and relentless.

We then ordered 1 dessert for the table and the manager sent out 3 cookies and extended an apology for my cold dinner.  We requested our bill and saw that the 3 cookies had been added on, we called the waiter over and he knew immediately what we were about to question, he corrected the bill.  All in all we had a lovely evening however our beverage and dinner bill for 5 came to $475.00, not outrageous but quite overpriced for what we had.  Although very nice we found the noise level to be almost unbearable and the wait staff to be pushy, we will not return....sorry!",,,
145,Scott J.,"New York, NY",9,6,0,1.0,2/14/2011,Food was so mediocre. For what they are charging you would think you're getting a good meal. WRONG. Service was atrocious and food was even worse. I will never go back here.,,,
146,Joey L.,"New York, NY",0,34,0,2.0,2/13/2011,Cmon guys $19 for  a cobb salad with 3 meager slices of chicken and skinny avocado slices and 5 tiny cubes of bacon.  One can do much better in terms of food.  I liked the atmosphere and location but reallythere are so many places around where you can get a good fulfilling lunch for $19.,,,
147,Stephen C.,"New York, NY",127,339,1,3.0,1/26/2010,The food is safe but not eclectic or overly designed. Price is average and service was OK. I won't be running back anytime soon and only if I were hungry with no place else to go.,,,
148,Eric J. R.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,93,0,4.0,4/14/2008,"Solid little spot - a welcome addition to midtown. Had a FANTASTIC sangria, with a side of sliders (juicy), crab cakes (perfectly crispy and light), and finished it off with a Duvel. Perfect! Could have had a more extensive wine list by the glass, it would have been nice to try a new wine. Great service at the bar and at the door!",3,,1
149,Penelope J.,"New York, NY",24,193,50,3.0,5/6/2008,"My friends and I stopped in here the other night for a quick dinner.The place is always jammed packed, so I wanted to see if I was missing something.It's a small space but the combination of the high ceilings and the sliding glass doors, makes it appear much larger.Not like this is a make or break thing but the downstairs foyer to the bathrooms is disgusting and there were people in both bathrooms just flushing the toilets over and over again and continuously running the faucets. Odd.Their wine cocktails are fun; the Madison & Vine, and the Pink Spritzer are both delicious.Now onto the food: poor.We ordered the calamari to share and although it was perfectly cooked, the accompanying sauces did not pair well--an incredibly, sweet cocktail sauce and a lemon-y caper sauce...eek.As for our entrees, one person ordered the shrimp risotto which was just awful.It tasted like bland salty oatmeal--too starchy with no flavor, except for the massive amounts of butter. My friend and I both had Caesar salads, which were typical Caesar salads. There were two strips of bacon placed over four or five huge hearts of romaine with a meager amount of overly eggy dressing [maybe a few drizzles].Maybe they were having an off night--I'd come back for drinks at the bar but I probably wouldn't dine here again.",3,,
150,Maria C.,"New York, NY",19,146,1,1.0,9/7/2008,"Madison and Vine = thumbs down.  Not very good at all.  I had prince edward island mussels which were puny, overcooked, and fishy tasting.  For my entree I had the scallops with endives, and there were some weird gray salty things in the center of my plate which i think were endives but am not sure.  The acoustics in the room are terrible.  While this is common on NY restaurants and I am usually able to manage, here I just felt confused and disoriented.  Service is extremely S L O W.",2,,
151,Dan F.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,1,0,2.0,10/5/2008,"I really didn't want this place to be as dissatisfying as it is, considering it's right around the corner from my office and isn't a buffet-style deli. Unfortunately, it's just not good. I have gone twice and failed to be impressed both times. The first time, I had the Four-Cheese Macaroni, which was impressive in that it made Mac-N-Cheese, something nearly impossible to screw up, so unappetizing that I didn't finish my plate. I don't recall now all the cheeses that were in it: Gruyere was one I do know. As others pointed out, service is extremely slow, even during off hours when they look to be overstaffed. Regardless, I thought, ""Ehh...I do hold Mac-N-Cheese to a pretty high standard. I'll give them another chance.""This week, they got that second chance. Man, I am glad it went on my company's bill and not mine. The calamari appetizer was rubbery, but that's not horrible as that's pretty normal for most calamari appetizers. So onto the main coarse. The Steak Tartar topped with a Quail Egg was pretty tasty, though my special requests for my entree were completely ignored or forgotten by our server. My co-worker's oven-roasted barbecue chicken smelled horrible though. Not the sauce, which was sweet and served as a good masking agent, but the chicken itself. At first I thought it was that often putrid smell you get when you poach chicken, but, no, the chicken stunk like old chicken. Thank goodness my heavy eating co-worker had also ordered a plate of fries. Too bad they were lame. Yes, 'lame' as described by the American Heritage Dictionary : Weak and ineffectual; unsatisfactory. The parsley used to season them was fresh and tasty enough, but the fries themselves were thin, soggy, and limp- three fry characteristics that do not go well together. The third diner's Hangar Steak was ""okay"" by his description, but it was served alongside the same soggy fries. Oh, and again the offered very slow, often confusing service(twice there was confusion over who was serving, or rather, NOT serving us).So as much as I wish this was a place I could go once in a while when I'm actually at my home office, I can't do it. Not when Burger Heaven is a half block away, half the price, half the time, and none of the trouble trying to get service. Now Burger Heaven doesn't have the highly attractive hostesses or bartenders, but they don't need it: they have half-way decent food consistently. Oh god, I can't believe I just sang the praises of Burger Heaven. That's what I've been driven to. Damn you, Madison & Vine! Well, in the words of The Great Orator: ""fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice... eh.. Fool me... Can't get fooled again.""",1,1,
152,J C.,"New York, NY",13,70,1,3.0,8/26/2009,"Interesting for its selection of wine cocktails.  The Blackberry Fizz, with Lillet Blanc, gin, blackberries and champagne sounded interesting, but in the end I went with a white sangria made from Sauvignon Blanc, fruit puree and rum.  It was actually very tasty.  Reviewers are right about the noise level -- for a small space it sounds more like a crowded lounge.",,,
153,Cin S.,"San Francisco, CA",4,93,0,3.0,5/6/2009,"Solid place for lunch - good food and wine - catering more towards the business crowd.  Does tend to get crowded around lunch and right after work, so make a reservation if you want a table.  Noise levels can be pretty loud.",,,
154,michael g.,"New York, NY",362,37,5,1.0,3/26/2010,"I ge to this restaurant with my partner and some clients.  It is a pretty space, and it really felt nice.  We ordered some things both from the main menu and off the prix fixe menu which looked good and actually a fair deal at $25.  One of our clients ordered roasted pepper soup and when it arrived there were little chunks of something in the soup which tasted like fish.  Good thing he wasn't allergic to the shrimp that was in there cause a hospital visit due to food allergies would have been the only thing that could have made this experience worse.  The waitress said ""It has never happened before but they must have changed the soup without telling me that there were leeks in there"" (she thought leeks were a fish).  After we got over the soup issue, we waited and waited.  By the time the food arrived, my food came out wrong.   The waitress said that the wrong dish was picked up and she would fix it right away.  Nothing happened.  I waited and waited again.  While I waited one of my clients wanted lemon.  We kept asking but it never arrived.  So I went to the bar and this bartender named Chris reaches into the bar condiment tray and hands me a sliver of lemon.  It was really weird.  No plate, no napkin, no toothpick.  Just grabbed a piece and handed it over to me.  I left it on the bar and went back to the table.  Needless to say my food never arrived.  I cancelled it, and without apologies or a manager coming over or anything, I got the number for the main office (they own other places I like including Cambell Apts etc).  Spoke with a nice woman who was very apologetic.  She said she would call to make this right.  And she did call.  But that moron Chris spoke with her, and did nothing.  My bill had everything on it except my entree.  No complimentary drinks, dessert, or even a free apology.  Nothing.  So I call the main office again and told them this and she was embarrassed and said that the lunch was on her and that we should just leave the restaurant.  She could not have been nicer, and the restaurant could not have been more poorly run.  If I were them, I would fire Chris and that waitress.  Not even a free meal could have made up for the experience.",1,1,1

156,Leaf W.,"Canberra, Australia",1,11,0,1.0,8/25/2010,"Such a suboptimal experience on all counts!! Noisy, average food, average service. I can only assume it was busy because it is pretty cheap for midtown and the meals are standardised and out quickly. Might be OK for a quick drink and bowl of fries after work with colleagues, but am in no way tempted to return to test that theory. Pedestrian.",,,
157,Roger G.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,86,2,2.0,4/17/2010,"The food is decent but overpriced. Had the prix fixe lunch recently with the chopped salad and chicken paillard. Really not the best chicken I've had. Noise level is a bit much - good for a boisterous meal with friends, but not for any real one-on-one conversation.",,,
158,Elie S.,"New York, NY",7,6,0,4.0,5/7/2008,"great summer place as all the windows open up to 41st street which is actually a pretty quiet street. outdoor seating is quite enjoyable. good menu of broad ""new american"" interest.",2,,1
159,Mary C.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,6,0,2.0,11/11/2008,"This is my first review, which is odd because you'd think I would want to write my first for a place that wowed me.  Don't go here if you are seeking that experience.  I went on a Tuesday night and the place was packed.  I was placed at a table that was literally 2 inches away from another table and I could hear the other couple's entire conversation.  We might as well have been sitting at the same table.  It took a long time for our drinks and meal order to be taken and the service was very slow throughout the meal.  I also had to waive down the busboy to get our check which I don't think I've ever had to do in NY since I've moved here.  The Madison & Vine burger was good but nothing to rave about.  My boyfriend had the meatloaf which was too salty and the mashed potatoes were flavorless.  The sangria tasted like watered down grape juice and the Pink Spritzer sounded good on the menu but was unimpressive in taste.  Now I know why I've never been before even though my office is right across the street.  Overall, I didn't give this place a one star rating b/c my burger was good but I won't be coming back.  I think I'll satisfy my burger craving at Pop Burger or Rare instead.",1,1,1
