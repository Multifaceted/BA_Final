0,Adam S.,"New York, NY",1542,292,2047,4.0,6/1/2018,"I've always loved me some MMG. This location is very close to home so it becomes my go-to when I want something healthy and somewhat inexpensive.  I'm a big fan of their XXL Turkey Burger Wrap (I usually get it with a low carb wrap) with a side of steamed spinach.  Their Godfather dish is also great, as are their Turkey Meatballs, which are even better inside the Rocky Balboa wrap.  While I have my go-tos on their menu, I definitely have started to branch out and try new options. The chicken sandwich and the chicken nugget ""boneless wings"" are great.  It's unfortunate, though, that this location doesn't participate in MMG's loyalty point program: you can't earn nor redeem points here. Also, their prices are also slightly higher than other MMG locations across town for the exact same food. Minus one star.",4,,3
1,Kovi K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",77,36,134,2.0,7/12/2018,"Muscle maker grill has some healthy food, I'll give them that. However, it's not very good and it's slightly overpriced. It tastes like something I would have made myself in college. Very basic, healthy, but not particularly good.The godfather was filled with balsamic. They claim 60g of protein, which is nice. But it also has 11 grams of suger and 970 grams of sodium! You can make the same thing with a lot less of both.The reason I have them 2 stars instead of one: the Arizona (which includes turkey bacon) is pretty good.",2,1,1
2,Alex G.,"San Francisco, CA",152,17,1,2.0,6/30/2018,"I came here after a bike ride along the west side based on the positive reviews. Right away it became apparent that the majority of their orders are take out, which explains the high reviews. The price is great for the location and the overall taste of the food is OK. BUT......I won't come back because:1.The cashier couldn't tell me what was in most of the smoothies.2. The base is just water versus the typical almond milk etc...they should call that out. 3. They clearly state ""fresh fruit"" but actually use a sugary purée :(4. I watched the cook use tongs to put raw chicken on the grill then use the exact same tongs a second later to remove cooked chicken.5. Lastly, I watched the cashier make all three protein shakes with her bare hands, touching the bananas and ice, right after handling the cash I gave her. They've proved the adage true; You get what you pay for.",,,
3,Alfred N.,"Queens, NY",2705,219,1833,4.0,11/16/2018,The platter is very overwhelming and taste very healthy; how you may say; you're going to have to try it to find out.  The location is far from the trains so you're going to have to coordinate with the bus or take a nice stroll through Hells Kitchen to get some.  You can take a ride share if you're feeling like Daddy Warbucks.  I do wish this location was closer to my routine.,8,3,7
4,Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",181,272,1415,4.0,3/10/2018,"A very good go to establishment for me. With a few locations around the city. I'm most familiar with the Bronx location, this is my first time @ this location. Smaller in size (only a couple of tables), consistent menu items (the features are the same) and good friendly service. Muscle Maker has good staples for healthy eating that are fulling, fresh and offers variety without breaking the budget. Great wraps, veggies and pasta, all with reduce fat options you can't go wrong.",,,
5,Stephen H.,"New York, NY",5,4,1,2.0,8/19/2018,"When I walked in, all I could think was - yuck - this place is DIRTY. Then I noticed that the guy in back making the food was wearing flip flops! Gross!",,,
6,Sharrone U.,"Bronx, NY",128,70,423,5.0,3/10/2018,Muscle Maker is one of my favorite go to spots. Their XXL Turkey wrap with a side of broccoli hits the spot every time. Their sweet potato fries and Asparagus are my favorite.,,,1
7,Thomas C.,"Brooklyn, NY",972,4,1,2.0,7/14/2018,"It is EXTREMELY difficult to place an online order for delivery with this store (I've never tried any other store because this one is closest), but this is the second instance I have tried to place an order with difficulty through musclemakergrill.com. In today's case, your website is experiencing technical problems AGAIN, and cannot place my order... So I call... thrice... and no one has answered either of your listed numbers. It's 11:15am and your store hours say you are open. I'm not sure I can continue to use your services. The food is great but to simply place an order with you should not be this difficult in this day and age. You're competition proceeds you.",,,
8,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,4.0,4/18/2016,"New location for Muscle Maker Grill taking over the random Mediterranean spot no one went into. Small place with the staff running around trying to complete delivery orders. Got welcomed with a menu as I figured out what to get for takeout. Lots of healthy food options for weight gain, weight loss, or just a regular meal. Settled on the European Wrap ($9) which comes with a free side (got the Caesar Salad). Food came out in about 10 minutes; good, considering the relative busy-ness. The wrap holds together the chicken, spinach, peppers and cheese tightly - lots of flavor that's well balanced. The salad is only okay, a few leaves with Caesar dressing on top.This is more of a 3.5 star place. Rounded up because the people inside are really friendly and the area needs a decent healthy option. Will be back.",,1,1
9,Sarah J.,"New York, NY",184,45,55,4.0,5/10/2017,"My new go to for food!As a vegetarian it is sometimes hard to find healthy and protein filled foods. This location is a great one stop shop for protein bars, shakes, and food that is vegetarian friendly. Each order comes with a healthy side dish. I got the veggie wrap and it was decent (not excellent but not bland). But for the price of a chipotle burrito you will feel a lot better and about as full. They also will prepare meals for $8/meal...I might try this out sometime.Will come back and bring friends!",,,
10,Matt K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/26/2018,"This place is a mess and unorganized. Confirmed my delivery order via text then 1.5 hours later say they got ""confused"". Will never be ordering again. Garbage. Get your act together.",,,
11,Drew G.,"New York, NY",3,23,0,1.0,12/4/2017,Once again. Muscle Maker screws up my Seamless order. I order and it magically disappears. I hate ordering from this place. And they NEVER do right by you either. I used to order from here literally 2-3x a week. Not anymore.,,,
12,Kristina P.,"BEECHHURST, NY",147,131,64,2.0,10/6/2017,"Their food is decent. The wraps were ok and The Godfather dish is actually pretty good. However, last time I dined in, we ordered the protein shake and the lady didn't even ask what size I wanted and just gave us this gigantic shake. I also ordered edamame because the entrees were taking forever and it came after the entrees. Worst part was that when I was 1/3 done with it, there was this nasty piece of crushed penne pasta. Who knows where that came from... the cashier lady was super cold and not friendly from the start, so I didn't even bother complaining and just left. Also their deliveries take a long time. I live a block away and they take 60+ minutes and never answer their phone. Wouldn't recommend.",,1,

Updated review",I called and the person who picked up explained it was a grill bristle and apologized for the mistake. They refunded my order and was nice through the process. Will order again!,,,
14,Krizia C.,"Manhattan, NY",318,311,190,1.0,5/15/2016,Worst muscle grill ever!!!! We used to be a frequent customer of the Chelsea location and then moved. Now we are stuck with the worst location. Every single time we order there are always multiple issues:1) bad service.  Never answer the phone and rude as hell 2) delivery. Always take forever. The quote time is always wrong and they don't even bother telling you. 3) the food!!! It's not the same as the other locations. Food always comes cold to the point of frozen. I bit into a turkey meatball wrap and almost broke my tooth because it was so hard and frozen. We told the manager and they did not care. Sucks sucks sucks!!,2,1,
15,Wendy C.,"Gainesville, FL",42,36,145,5.0,7/19/2016,"I really like this place.  I am a vegetarian, so I mostly got side items.Items Ordered (via Seamless):1 Fruit Smoothie $4.49 - slightly melted but delicious1 Chips and Guacamole $4.50 - really fresh guac, chips were stale1 Extra Sweet Potato Fries $3.99 - soggy but I reheated in the oven1 Loaded Baked Potato $3.99 - this was yummy1 Extra Side Caesar Salad $2.99 - dressing served on top, did not affect quality1 Sugar Free Cheesecake $2.99 - LOVE THIS - will order again1 Complete Cookie $3.50 - white chocolate maca nut, this is prepackaged, very good1 Extra Pasta Salad $2.99 - pass this item.  It was gross/mayo-yI am really glad there is a low-calorie option available for delivery.  I would order form them again.",,,
16,Jose R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,1,2.0,9/18/2018,"i love muscle maker grill, i work nearby and when i plan on getting healthy i love it here. however this time was different. i normally order el mexicana and get a good size portion for $13. what was wrong? this time i got a smaller portion but that wasnt my main issue,  it was that the chicken was bland, beans were old and the cheese they over did it! melted and too much of it, usually comes shredded, 3 little chopped peppers, fat onions not even chopped, and when i bit into the chicken, it was hard! i think it was old too. not sure what happened to this place, maybe the owner should come around more and inspect the food or his employees.i mean i know how it normally comes since it's my favorite dish. not to mention the girl at the register wasn't as welcoming and seemed bothered when i asked again the price for my food, no smile, no thank you, your welcome.....I'm disappointed this establishment does not participate in the rewards program iether. i wanted to use to add points but the girl said they dont do it. i came on 09/18/2018 at 6:45pm. overall, not good, maybe ill just start making my own el mexicana at home.",,,
17,Edwin S.,"Queens Village, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/9/2018,The food here used to be good. I think new management has let it go. Food has been cold rice has been hard chicken dry the last 3 times. Used to eat there everyday. Won't be back again.,,,

20,Mikhael K.,"Jamaica, NY",5,54,10,5.0,5/17/2017,"Hard to notice this place but once you try it you'll enjoy it, their signature Chicken Breast sandwich was amazing, would defiantly recommend it to anyone in Hell's Kitchen.",,,
21,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,5.0,5/16/2016,"I've been going here for a while now and forgot to review! This has become a staple for me, especially on Friday nights when I'm usually in the area but still trying to eat healthy. I especially love that all their nutrition info is posted on their website so you know exactly what you're getting. I've had the Godfather, Texas, and penne romano - all were excellent considering how healthy it is! They have a wide variety of options though, some healthier than others, as well as an extensive smoothie/shake menu. I'm still getting around to trying everything but I like it so far! I've done delivery and pick-up orders and both have been ready fast. The staff has always been very friendly, as well. Solid option in the area if you're looking for some healthy food that tastes great!",2,2,2
22,Bella W.,"Rutherford, NJ",104,18,12,5.0,4/11/2017,I love this place has the best healthy food on the block.. and it's good and affordable.  Costumer service is excellent .,,,

24,Shachar M.,"New York, NY",265,131,45,1.0,5/15/2016,"So disappointing. After two years of enjoying muscle maker in Chelsea we moved to the upper west and now have to find a new place for fresh healthy delivery. This location is not fresh and always without fail mess up the order.. We ordered twice from here. The first time arrived an hour late, super cold food and Mushed sweet potato fries. Everything was bad. I mean really bad! Today we decided to give it a try and again everything arrived frozen! Seemed that there food is not fresh at all. We had to warm everything again. The Caesar salad came with  dressing drenched in the salad. The lettuce was soaked in it.not tasty at all.Stay away!!",,1,
25,Mike W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,5.0,6/15/2016,"I walk past this place everyday and today I decided to give it a try for lunch.  I order the Chicken Caesar salad to takeaway.  I really enjoyed it.  Loads of chicken!They seemed to be preparing lots of seamless orders, but I still only had to wait around 5 mins.I will be coming back.",,,
26,Steven S.,"The Heights, Jersey City, NJ",262,2,0,1.0,8/18/2017,"Store claimed to be open until 11pm. Placed an order at 10:35pm. Showed up at 10:45 and they were ""closed."" Still haven't gotten my refund back since I paid online. The incompetency is real. This place isn't even worthy of 1 star. Embarassement to the franchise. Definitely worth the $10 to never have to go there again. - Unhappy customer",,,
27,Ivan L.,"Manhattan, NY",187,3,0,1.0,2/24/2017,"Ordered an order of rice and beans. Being Hispanic, it was the worst rice and beans ever, extremely dry, no taste and $9 for it for a small amount. Took 3 bites and threw it all away.",,,

29,Michael M.,"Hicksville, NY",1147,8,4,1.0,12/31/2016,not true to the brand. in person the staff is very rude and always seems to be preoccupied by the delivery orders. always messing up my order because they aren't paying attention to what i am asking for. no complaints about food when it actually order is taken correctly.,,,
