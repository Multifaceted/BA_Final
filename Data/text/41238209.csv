TIME. they've got daily lunch specials, which btw, never seem to change. people say taco salad wednesdays are AMAZING. no. no, they're not. i tried and they lied.prices are higher and quality lower than surrounding delis/cafes, but overall, the food is decent. staff -- super kind with gentle souls -- at least at work anyway.although it is a deli and many order take out, there's plenty of room in the back for a sit down meal with waiter service.waiter service -- don't expect much. bottom line, you get what you need without fluff... and maybe with a bang of plates/cups on your table or a toss of the straws.",,,1
