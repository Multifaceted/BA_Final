0,Ee Vonn Y.,"San Jose, CA",1288,1901,3834,5.0,11/17/2018,"Verdict: Easily the best experience I have ever had at any Michelin restaurant. The service, the dedication of the staff, detail, and attention they gave me made this one of the best meals I've ever had. Background: The maitre d' reached beforehand to clarify the occasion and dietary restrictions. I was thrilled that they offered a vegan tasting menu but I opted for the pescatarian menu instead. Jokingly, I told her I was celebrating the death of my twenties. Upon arriving at my table, there was a handmade birthday card with a picture of a tombstone that read ""RIP Ee Vonn's Twenties."" Inside the card was a list of EMP's Reasons Why Life in Your 30s is Better Than Your 20s. It was incredibly sweet and thoughtful that the staff put together this personalized birthday card with an added sense of humor. It set the mood for the rest of the evening. We asked for a tour of the kitchen at some point during the meal. One of the staff took us to the kitchen, explained the different stations, and got to sample some freshly brewed apple cider. The kitchen is gorgeous, organized, and bustling. It looked like a glamorous food laboratory. The executive sous chef greeted and thanked us for dining here. Bar tasting menu - Five courses for $175 each. The husband and I shared dishes so I was able to try more items. Caviar (souffle with clam, leek and potato) - Souffle was soft, fluffy, and creamy. Interesting contrast between the salty, fishy caviar and the eggy texture.Bitter Greens (with date and black tea) - The creamy date and black tea dressing at the bottom blended very well. This is the most creative salad I've seen and possibly one of the most delicious dressings I've tasted. Its sweetness balanced the bitter greens.Brook Trout (cured with radish, sesame, and smoked trout roe) - Fun presentation with square-shaped paper-thin slices of radish over trout over a slice of bread. It was good. Lobster (charred with pumpkin and citrus) - Soft, warm, and savory. The pumpkin sauce was good. The lobster was wrapped in citrus peels. Who knew lobster and pumpkin made a good combination? Striped Bass (with turnip and brown butter) - The fish was alright but it was a palette to soak up the brown butter. The mixture of pickled and warm vegetables was a nice, crisp contrast to the fish.Duck (honey and lavender glazed with beets and blood pudding) - The beets were sweet. The blood pudding resembled barbecue sauce but infused with honey. The duck was juicy, soft, and savory. The skin added a delicious, salty texture. Pear (with caramelized white chocolate) - Subtly sweet and refreshing. The balance with the soft white chocolate was great. Chocolate (shortbread with malt and barley ice cream) - The shortbread was very good. The barley ice cream was incredible. I wanted a pint to take home. Chocolate Covered Pretzel - Very soft, perfectly portioned layer of chocolate. Best chocolate pretzel I've ever had.",3,3,3
1,Monica D.,"New York, NY",184,249,423,5.0,11/14/2018,"This has been on my bucket list for a while but it was always unable to get a reservation but I finally got one for last night! I was emailed last week by one of the Maitre D's asking if I was coming in for a special occasion and I let her know that I was celebrating my run in the New York City Marathon.I chose the Dining Room Tasting Menu which consisted of 8 to 10 seasonal items, no alcohol. The cost was $342 after tax (gratuity is already included) Upon arrival I chose to have one glass of red wine and asked what the suggestion would be which would pair well across the board and was directed to a $27 glass of Syrah. It was perfect and quite a nice pour. I was I asked if I had any allergies or items I would prefer not to have then was told what the menu would be and was given a choice with only the appetizer, entrée and dessert. My menu consisted of nine courses which arrived 5 to 10 minutes in between each one. After my second course I was surprised with a visit to the kitchen. As I shown the stations and how things work, a gentleman came by and prepared a hot cider brandy cocktail just for me. Maybe it was because of my celebration or that I was alone but this special touch was my favorite part of the evening. Back at the table I was presented with the items and an enthusiastic explanation of each. My favorite item was the tableside presentation of the black truffle mushroom tart. For the final course I was given dessert along with an entire bottle of apple brandy but unfortunately I could only manage to have a few sips. Also as a take-home gift I was given a jar of baked granola and a small tin with my personalized menu.The attentiveness and kindness of the staff is otherworldly! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with an open mind about food who is looking to indulge themselves or someone else.",1,,
2,YingTung W.,"San Jose, CA",12,29,180,5.0,11/11/2018,"Ok where do I start I think if you reserved this restaurant, you know what to expect. I won't say it's the fanciest Michelin restaurant, but I wasn't disappointed. There's some hiccup while we were having our meal, the servers handled it very well; good attitude and good service recovery!Food wise, I won't comment much as most of the time I realized you really need a different taste palette to enjoy; also you need to be a little more educated to understand what kind of effort they have put in for each dish. If you don't understand good quality ice makes better cocktail, or if you don't know giving escargot special diet does mean something - then you probably won't appreciate this restaurant. I have seen people who only care glamorous complain about EMP, but first educate yourself so you know they have gone above and beyond. And they make ""above and beyond"" as their routine. Every single detail is being taken care of at the moment you walk into this restaurant; it's so subtle that you probably won't notice it.",,1,
3,Pauline M.,"Culver City, CA",473,1556,2035,5.0,10/14/2018,"EMP had been on our radar for several years and we said the next time we came through NYC we should definitely book the reservation early.  And that's what we did!So... it's a little embarrassing.  We were late for our meal. We probably shouldn't have trusted google map estimated time and should have budgeted extra time and also had the slowest cabbie ever in the whole city.  but alas... this is what happens when you aren't from New York.  on the way over, we made sure to call to let them know and they were extremely nice about the whole thing.  When we arrived we apologized and they didn't even bat an eye.  And told us that it's great that we made it! Onto the meal!  The food was spectacular.  Equal parts art and delicious.  The caviar was definitely out of this world.  The flavors all came together beautifully like the harmonies in a symphony.  The foie gras was also heavenly- the flavors all enveloped the senses and man I just couldn't get enough.  The crab cake underneath the bed of squash - wow they take so much care to make sure each piece is cooked perfectly and exactly the same size.The 140 days dry aged ribeye was also ridiculousness.  Perfectly cooked and perfectly melts in your mouth. The meal at EMP was definitely one to remember.  Every single dish was amazing, the service was fantastic.",5,2,2
4,Kimi I.,"New York, NY",435,107,101,3.0,11/10/2018,"Ok, if this was just another regular ole restaurant, the rating would have been 4 stars.  But this is not just a regular ole restaurant- this restaurant is rated as one of the top places in NYC, and in the world. Well I am dumbfounded! I do not exaggerate when I say I have been looking forward to coming here for months and I left feeling so completely disappointed. Not the feeling I thought I would have after this dining experience.The ambiance was nothing special. Its a large room with high ceilings and no style, plus it was freezing (ladies beware). The staff was excellent- no complaints there. But the food, le sigh, the food was truly underwhelming. First 2 courses were promising and consisted of caviar and oysters. But after that it was pretty basic and certainly not memorable. The lobster tail was ok, the duck was fine, the foie gras was satisfactory, the desert was eatable - but these aren't words I want to use when the check is over $1,000! I want my damn mind blown, but instead I was left wondering why everything was so, well, meh?I have been blessed to eat in some incredible restaurants like Per se, Blue Hill at Stone Farms, Le Bernardin, French Laundry, etc - But Eleven Madison didn't live up to the hype, reputation or price tag. No desire to ever return and super bummed.",1,,
5,Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4699,2638,17919,4.0,9/20/2018,"My friend and I had dinner at Eleven Madison Park one night while in NYC. I was super hyped as when I went in May it stood as the number 1 restaurant in the world in rankings! It's since slid down to #4 in the world but still #1 in the US.Now was it the best Michelin star experience I've had? Honestly, I'd give that to Alinea (which is now down to #34 in the world, #5 in the country), but according to the experts, this is the BEST. It's truly interesting to me how various restaurants get scored. It was indeed a solid and interesting meal with beyond excellent service.I suggest watching the documentary on Eleven Madison Park before going so you can truly build an appreciation all that goes into this restaurant. The Restaurateur on Netflix, do it.The entire meal was solid and some dishes were very good! I can't say a single dish blew me completely away though. However highlights of the meal for me were Snails with morels & ramps, the Goat Cheese variations and the Chocolate pretzels at the end of the meal. Plus they gave us granola to go in an adorable glass container. So nice and considerate to have a little parting gift for us! They also gave my friend a chocolate bar for his birthday, love the little touches.I'm incredibly glad I experienced this restaurant but for me personally, it's a one and done type of experience. For $315, I'd rather do Alinea again and again.",25,14,23
6,Kat V.,"Seattle, WA",32,212,124,3.0,11/10/2018,"Disappointing. Can't believe this was #1 (and now #4) in the world!!! I just had #6 and #7 (Central and Maido) in the past 24 hours and I'm appalled that EMP ranks above them. Who are they paying to even make the Top 10?!?Don't get me wrong, service was on point and the venue is nice but the food was nothing amazing in terms of satisfaction. It was presented creatively (snail tacos were cool) and we liked the table-side prep of one of the dishes, but to us there was no consistent wow factor in terms of actual taste. Seems like it was all more for show than anything. If you're in NYC, your time -- and money--will be better spent at #12, Bluehill at Stonebarns.",,1,

My favorite dish from the night I went was the ""cheese course"" which was a soft pretzel with beer cheese and honeynut squash!",,,

Updated review","If second time is the charm then our dinner on September 7 was a fabulous experience! After it reopened this summer, I decided to give Eleven Madison another try for my husband's birthday dinner (his first time there). Service has always been A-class here but this time I was much happier with the tasting menu & our cocktails. We have been to many Michelin rated restaurants but never have I had such a personalized experience. Halfway through we got chatting with our serving team (yep you will be served by a team of professionals) when I mentioned about our 2 Maltese boys & shared their pics. Eleven always gives their diners jars of homemade granola to take home (sooo good!) but to our surprise there was a very special jar included in our bag - turns out while we were dining, someone was baking fresh dog cookies in the kitchen & their 'in house artist' was drawing a sketch of one of our boys. Thank you JENNY & team for such a thoughtful surprise!!",,,
10,Trina D.,"Orange County, CA",763,2182,8145,5.0,10/9/2018,"Eleven Madison Park was on my friend's bucket list of restaurants to dine at. So we made it happen. It topped the list of the best 50 restaurants in the world in 2017 theworlds50best.com/The-…, 2018 theworlds50best.com/The-…, and it has 3 Michelin Stars. It's currently considered the best restaurant in North America in 2018 and ranked 4th in the world. Dining in the main dining area lunch or dinner will run you about $315 per person before tax. Hot tip: they offer a 5-course bar tasting for $175 per person plus tax. Gratuity is already included in the price so that's all you should expect to pay. Reservations are strongly recommended. They require payment when booking with very little likelihood of refunds (check the refund policy on the website). We went with the bar tasting during the lunch hour on a Friday. When we arrived, they knew exactly who we were, which is impressive and unnerving at the same time. They took our coats when we checked in, we made a quick stop at the ladies room to wash our hands, and then we were shown the way to our table. We ordered some drinks to begin and while they had some great offerings on the cocktail menu, I asked for a Gold Rush. Eleven Madison Park is located at 11 Madison Avenue, easily assessable via public transportation. The restaurant itself is beautiful with high ceilings and gorgeous windows. The servers were great. The food was next level in gastronomy. We were given choices in our 5-course bar menu. We were also given a printed menu at the end of our meal. One of my friend's was celebrating her birthday as well and they wished her a happy birthday on the menu. I had the following:Black and white - this was the amuse bouche which was a savory cookie with cheddar and apple. Caviar - served in a tin with egg omelette, corn, and ham served with housemade mini English muffins. This was decadent, rich, and lovely. I'd never had caviar in this way but it was surprisingly good. I ate the entire thing. We really loved the English muffins too and could have just feasted on those. Foie gras - this was served with eggplant and mint in bar shape, decorated with edible flowers. This was so pretty but I put it in my mouth anyway. The flavors were sublime. The texture was to be expected from foie gras. My friend who didn't like foie in this way opted for the melon course. Lobster - we all had this lobster course with greens and bean ecrasse. They poured this liquid over it and it was delicious. The lobster was delicate and not fishy at all. I wasn't sure I would enjoy it but I did. Duck - I was the only one to order the duck with honey and lavender glaze served with blueberries and onion on the side. There were more edible flowers. It was a gorgeous dish. My friends opted for the dry aged beef. I loved the duck because skin was encrusted with all these herbs. The flavors were amazing on the tongue. The blueberries and onion was an odd side but it worked. Side note: my friend found a hair on her dish and they took it back immediately offering her profuse apologies and another entrée. She refused because she was full, so we all ended up getting an extra course which consisted of the Triple Crème (cherry jam and basil crème fraiche). The Triple Crème was served with their housemade brioche and it was really amazing. We asked for more bread. Is that bad? For dessert we were given the choice of the Chocolate or the Blackberry. I went with Chocolate - sorbet with shortbread crust and a coffee meringue. The Blackberry dish was berry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon. Dessert was gorgeously plated and was sublime. Lastly, we were given chocolate pretzels and an ounce of Eleven Madison Park's very own Apple Brandy. The apple brandy was very strong. The chocolate pretzels were a tasty end to an otherwise amazing meal. But they weren't done, when they presented the printed menu, they gave us each a jar of housemade granola cooking.nytimes.com/reci… to take home. Dining here was definitely a checkmark off the bucket list. Despite the snafu, they responded with grace and generosity. We had an extraordinary and memorable experience. If you're celebrating something special, this is a place I would definitely recommend.",18,10,12
11,Bailey Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",1128,1330,2340,5.0,8/7/2018,"As a former best restaurant in the world winner, expectations were running high. EMP has been on my list of places to visit for almost a decade. It was on my radar before it rose from a two to three star Michelin restaurant, but now it's kind of a big deal in the restaurant world. I decided to take my fiancee for our three year anniversary, but I've also been hearing mixed reviews on their most recent tasting menu and decided to opt for the abbreviated bar tasting menu instead on our most recent visit to NYC - that would later be a regretful decision.We arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation, but were quickly seated at a large private table near the bar. The bar seating is tucked away in the back and a much darker area compared to the brightly lit main dining hall. Our first course was already awaiting to be opened in front of us with a box that held two black and white cookies (if you don't know what these are, they're synonymous with NYC and everywhere in the city). Except, the twist was that the black and white cookie was a cheese cookie with cheddar and apple filling. Our next course was my favorite of the evening: the caviar Benedict with corn and smoked sturgeon. It literally tasted like an amazing deconstructed Benedict, served in a caviar tin with bread. It was beautifully presented, but even more important, so flavorful with every scoop and bite. The menu started diverging with choices of a few courses. We tried both the foie gras and the crab next. The foie gras was marinated with eggplant and mint and was very rich in flavor. In contrast, the crab dish was presented with a salad of zucchini and lemon and was elegantly plated like everything else, but the flavor was very light and refreshing.The fourth course was the lobster, grilled with greens and bean ecrasse. Having recently traveled from New England, we had eaten three lobster rolls in two days and were pretty lobstered out. But this lobster was simply cooked to perfection and arguably better than the fresh lobster rolls we were eating in Maine, which was mind-blowing to me. There were only three small morsels, but each was packed with flavor.The main courses consisted of a dry aged beef and grilled with peppers and an aged duck, honey and lavender glazed with blueberries and onion. Of the two, the beef was the winner and my second favorite dish of the meal. By itself, the beef was good, but eaten with the peppers took it to another level. Something as simple as this was made so well was quite impressive. The duck was a little on the tough side for my liking, but the flavors were great nonetheless.For dessert, we chose a cheese course with a triple creme in brioche with cherry and basil creme fraiche, which again had so many flavors between the sweet cherry and the creamy cheese within the brioche. For the other, we chose the blackberry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon. The presentation was very minimalist, but it was quite tasty. Dinner ended with a delicious chocolate covered peanut butter pretzel served with brandy.As a bonus, I requested to tour the kitchen as I wouldn't know the next time I would be back. It's definitely not guaranteed as they had to work a few things out, but we were treated to a short viewing to the new, renovated kitchen. The kitchen didn't look like a typical restaurant kitchen, instead reminiscent of an immaculate lab with so many moving pieces working in perfect synchrony. As a parting gift, we were given a very nice glass jar of granola to have for breakfast the next day (which was amazing as well).The bar tasting dinner lasted around 2.5 hours so I can't imagine how long the typical tasting would take. Booking is through Tock months in advance and cost $175, gratuity and tax included, which is quite a good price given a 3 star Michelin and consistently in the top 5 Best Restaurants in the World rankings. I would definitely return to try the full tasting menu next time and highly recommend coming here.",8,4,8
12,Sherry Z.,"Manhattan, NY",258,99,83,4.0,9/30/2018,"Quite a belated review, as I dined here in March for our anniversary and it's nearly October, but I needed to sit on this experience to fully digest (pun intended) everything that occurred during the meal before formulating my opinion. My final conclusion is that the meal was fine, even great, but the experience as a whole simply did not live up to the hype. I recommend coming here during the lunch service for best photo opportunities, because if you're paying 1k+ for a meal, you best be taking as many pictures as possible. For all the talk about fantastic service here, we had quite a prolonged and awkward experience. It started with a misunderstand between the choices offered which subsequently led to extremely stilted exchanges with our server throughout the rest of our four hour meal. Then there was also a spot of sauce that the server (a separate one) accidentally rubbed across and firmly into our tablecloth. And then the whole truffle that was dropped onto the ground mid-preparation. And then comes the philosophical question of whether ANYONE really needs to sit through a four hour marathon of a meal. The courses were, of course, beautiful and expertly crafted but towards the tail end of the meal everything became a chore. Frankly, I haven't had another tasting menu experience in the 6 months since our visit because I had been totally turned off all aspects of fine dining. That is not to say this wasn't a great experience -- because it is, it is worth the money and time to experience what is hands down one of the greatest restaurants and culinary feast in the world. The food were literal works of art, the flavors divine. But as a whole package...the experience just fell flat, likely because of how hyped up everything has become. Not much else to add, except that the champagne was extremely yummy :)",7,4,3
13,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,4.0,9/24/2018,"Looking at the past couple of year's photos/menu, I could understand why they were the 'world's best restaurant' and perhaps why they're not anymore. These pictures showed showed more exquisite dishes. I expected caviar, lobster, heavenly seafood/meats to be thrown at me but its a lot more of bread, more bread, and then fruits/veggies and a little bit of the luxury dishes. I think some of food were a little too basic and some that I eat casually on a regular night out maybe not caviar though. I understand preparation and skills are completely different though. This is shown more in detail if you visit the kitchen (it's insanely clean and organized). If you're not bothered by the ~$350 price tag per person and want a memorable experience then I would recommend it. I don't think the food was entirely worth it, but the overall experience, sure. My family were happy with many of the dishes and found the price tag worthy (not that easy for my Asian parents to be impressed btw). Service was impeccable and friendly as expected. I do think the dinner was a little too long (~3 hours) but I ended up being full despite the small portions. We were even able to tour the kitchen for a little bit, which was one of the best part (I'd recommend that you ask prior to your reservation!) Plus you'll get a little treat! We had a raspberry with lemon ""lollipop."" Since I celebrated my birthday here I even got a beautiful chocolate bar along with their usual parting gifts (granola and a list of dishes you had in a tin). Onto some of the food.. Black and white cookie- 3/5 This was a cookie made with cheddar and apple. I'm not crazy about cookies so this was just okay to me, kinda tasted like a classier ritz cracker with cheese. This was left on the table and everyone gets one piece. Tomato Tea- 4/5 I've had tomato soup and other soupy like things with tomato but never a tomato TEA. This looked exactly like tea and not its vibrant red color. It's quite light yet it almost wants to be like a tomato soup (slightly thick/heavier) but its not quite there. This was probably one of the most unique thing I've tasted. They had a summer herb bundle, which made the tea beautiful and appealing. Dosa- 5/5 I really enjoyed this with the goat cheese and green tomatoes. I think it really suited the dosa well. The dosa itself was crispy and had basil (?) on one end of it and a great starter. Tomato Salad with Summer Berries-4/5 I'm very picky with tomatoes, I will mostly eat tomatoes on the vine or tomatoes from farmer markets, and that's about it. These tomatoes were lovely and delicious along with the sweet and juicy berries. A refreshing, enjoyable, and light dish to go along with the other tomato themed dishes. Corn soufflé- 4.5/5 This is what I was expecting-caviar. This dish was pretty delicious, the caviar was slightly salty but the corn soufflé and crème fraîche balances it out nicely. Crab- 4.5/5 This was one of the most beautiful and tastiest dishes. It was a crab salad with zucchini and lemon. Thinly sliced zucchini (thank God, because I'm not a really big fan of zucchini and this was actually bearable) and beneath it was this jello like film which was really tasty with the crab. I really loved the presentation of this as well- so pretty~!Lobster-3/5 I was honestly a little disappointed with this dish because the server gave unequal amounts of sauce with it and I felt like the lobster was a little undercooked and chewy. I had to swallow a whole piece because it wasn't cutting up properly. This was wrapped in some kind of herb or vegetable and it was getting kinda repetitive. I think it could have been done without the extra wrapping and just butter-poached lobster with some veggies on the side or something. Chanterelles-4.5/5 Any sort of fire being brought to the table excites me (I'm not a pyromania or anything like that) but when they brought a mini grill for the 5 of us I thought it was pretty cool. The grilled chanterelles were pretty delicious along with the onions. They give you a veggie wrap along with several condiments (not really sure exactly what they were), but when I mixed it altogether, it tasted really great! Halibut-3/5 This was a bit of a letdown because I thought it was a bit too basic and tasted similar to something my dad makes. The halibut was served with lemon verbena and ginger, but the sauce tasted slightly like honey and was on the sweeter side. Peach-4.5/5 I love peaches- they're just so sweet and juicy. This dish wasn't overly sweet and there was honey custard and compote to balance everything out. Chocolate Covered Pretzel- 3/5 This was way too much. I think it would have ended better on the previous dessert. This was overly sweet and made me think of stealing my grandma's insulin shot (I didn't though). My mother and father couldn't even finish it and I had to force it down.",23,15,22
14,Anna M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",267,696,609,5.0,7/12/2018,"I held off on writing this review for 2 months because I could not find the words to describe my experience at Eleven Madison. I'm still having a hard time :P We came here a few days after dining at Le Bernardin, where we had a fantastic meal comprised of our favorite food: seafood. We came in with no expectations because we didn't think this meal could be that much better than Le Bernardin. Boy, was I wrong! On a scale of 1-10, this place is 100. From the wonderful service to the exquisite food, everything was pure perfection. We had 10pm reservations, but we were running about 20 minutes late. I thought for sure we blew it because we'd be rushed and the food wouldn't be as good. Nope. At no point were we rushed by any of the staff. In fact, our server asked if we wanted to tour the kitchen before our dining experience came to and end. How fantastic???Each dish was so beautiful and the flavors took us on an adventure. There are times where I'm disappointed in dishes on a tasting menu, but Eleven Madison blew my mind with each one. Everything was absolute PERFECTION, I tell ya. We opted for the wine pairing which was the best EVER! I didn't think any pairing could beat Benu's, but Eleven Madison takes the cake. Our Advanced Sommelier, Sam, was so great in explaining each wine and how they will pair with each dish. He was also incredibly kind and friendly. Ryan and I are rooting for you, Sam! Hope you are a Master Sommelier when we see you next :)If you are hesitant about dining here because of the price, get over it! It's honestly worth every penny. Truly a culinary experience.",7,2,5

16,Lin L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",104,212,3770,5.0,8/6/2018,"This was an amazing experience in food and art! No wonder it is a Michelin favorite! My husband and his friends were here a few years ago (without me...boo) and have not stopped talking about it. I used my birthday wish this year to finally savor the splendor they keep reminiscing about. And now, I can't stop talking about it either!From ambiance with the high ceilings and comfortable dining, to the choreographed service and the delicious food--the evening was a masterpiece! So glad we arrived early to enjoy the daylight shining thru from the park that subtly came to a romantic end. It's like sitting in your own art gallery, everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes--on the walls, on the floor, and on your plate! When you arrive, the revolving doors put you in this bright airy space. Ascend the steps to an elevated dining area surrounded by a gorgeous metal piece that reminds me of cornstalks. Hanging high on the far wall is a beautiful blue artwork (Rita Ackermann), on the upper right wall are darkened mirrors/windows that dances with the sunset. The seating was comfortable and inviting despite the vastness of the room. Every course presented was an art piece. The flavors burst in my mouth like a little celebration with each bite. It was inventive, light and left me craving more. The flavors did not overpower one another. The wine and cocktails paired beautifully. It was a beautiful symphony. The staff were personable and attentive. Chef Humm came out to greet the diners and sheepishly came to our table as one of my friends excitedly gestured him our way. He graciously took a few photos with us and did not seemed rushed at all despite it being a full house at dinner service.Billy, the GM, was amazing. We noticed thru the dark windows there were rooms in the upper levels. When we inquired about it, he did not hesitate to take us around. He was warm and friendly. It was wonderful to have him excitedly showing us around his home and proudly telling us about the history of EMP. Ask to see the Sol LeWitt room. Sadly, all things come to an end. When you leave your enchanted evening, notice the black step as you depart: it's ground down equipment from the original kitchen (Daniel Turner). But wait! It DOESN'T END when you leave. How can I not mention Humm's takeaway gift of subtly sweet and crunchy granola that tastes like ""something this good shouldn't be good for me, but it's granola so it must be?"" Hubby foolishly left his on the counter a day too long and within my reach and so I helpfully finished it for him.One of the things that struck me about Chef Humm is his quiet unassuming humility: in his presence, his food and his restaurant. I mean, he lets you step on ART for goodness sake! There isn't a giant plaque besides these pieces either, but the art are so beautiful you can't help but notice them and ask more about them.

This place checks off all the boxes, nice ambiance, great service, amazing food, and will most definitely wow you for that special occasion. We came here for my birthday and had a reservation a month before, the earliest they had was for 9:30pm. Don't make any plans for after dinner if you have a late reservation because this isn't going to be a quick meal. You come here for the culinary experience. Each bite takes you on a journey. Some flavors even too overwhelming for my palette. My favorite dishes had to be the sturgeon caviar topped on a corn soufflé and the foie gras. 3 Michelin well deserved.",2,2,2

Ranked #1 restaurant in 2017 worldwide and #4 restaurant in 2018, it definitely shows in your experience there.

You never feel like it's a stuffy environment which we loved. // FOOD // 10 courses focused on seasonal offerings and smattered with fun surprises along the way.

20,Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",130,518,505,5.0,8/5/2018,"Had an incredible experience here! We came for a late night reservation and were seated right away in a booth on the floor. We did the 10 course menu that started with a cute box of black and white cookies. They put a twist on it with a slightly tart and tangy flavor added and was a nice way to start off the meal. It continued with a summer tomato theme with these dosas and a selection of dipping sauces and a tomato tea. It was all very unique and savory. This followed with a bowl of tiny tomatoes. I'm usually not a huge fan of whole tomatoes but this was cooked in a way that the flavor wasn't too overpowering. For the third course, they pushed out a tray with delicate corn soufflé and plated the dish table side and added caviar on top and bonito cream on the side. I loved how it was slightly sweet and creamy from the corn but salty from the caviar and bonito.The next course we could choose and I went with the foie gras seared and it was absolutely amazing. Again, the flavor was very subtle but rich and nicely charred. The next appetizer was lobster wrapped in a thin leaf while my boyfriend got the sea bass. Immediately following was the snails course which was a lot of fun. They pushed in a cart with a grill to continue cooking the snails kebab right in front of you. When it was done, you wrapped it in lettuce and can add 4 different types of sauces. I really liked this one! I love escargots and this was done in such a creative and delicious way. They also came out with this complimentary bread with the most amazing butter that they offered to refill if you wanted. The mains took a while to come out - I got the duck and my boyfriend got the steak. It came with two sides to share - a creamed corn and zucchini that were great on their own as well! Even with all the small portion sizes, we were getting pretty full by this point. The dessert courses started with this creme filled brioche that came with two savory dipping sauces. We then both chose to get the chocolate sherbet desserts which were perfect! Finally, they ended up giving out this tier with two pretzels and a bottle of brandy, which you could finish if you wanted to but that bottle was very, very strong - I could only take one sip. To top off the amazing experience, they gave us two goody bags with jars of granola and the menu in those cute case! Overall a really well done and delicious meal.",,,

22,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",76,255,502,5.0,5/2/2018,"A somewhat belated review of a truly memorable lunch experience in March.  This restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while, but every time I came to New York, I couldn't manage to get a table.  When I knew I would be coming for a conference, I booked a table for lunch, the only time available for my dates, months in advance.  I started calling all my NYC crew but no one was available to join me.  I cast my net further afield to Philly and Boston and one of my Boston friends answered the gastronomic call.  He had to take a bus and come in just for the day, but proclaimed it totally worth it.With three Michelin stars, and the title of the ""Best Restaurant in the World"", there was a lot of expectation going in to the Sunday lunch... On arrival, we were ushered into a cathedral-like space with soaring ceilings and an austere but welcoming Art Deco décor, mostly whites with touches of blue, including a truly spectacular large abstract painting on the far wall.  Seated in a cozy corner banquet, we were greeted like we were a combination of royalty and long lost friends by our servers.  The cocktail menu had several unusual combinations, I opted for one containing gin and horseradish among several other things.  After a few sips, I actually felt sad, as I knew I would never have another cocktail as good as this one.  It was everything I ever wanted in a cocktail and more.  The cocktail by which all other cocktails will be forever judged and found wanting.  On the pristine white tablecloth, there was an intriguing white box tied with string.  I assumed it would a parting gift to be taken home, but yay! we were allowed to open it right away.  Inside were two small savory black and white cheese cookies.  A delightful bite to kick off the meal. Our first course was the scallop, which was served raw with sea urchin.  Delightful and fresh.  The next dish was incredibly intricate and really showed off the subtle skills of the chef, the caviar with smoked ham and hollandaise, a sort of deconstructed eggs benedict.  There was a lot going on with this dish but it all came together in a very sophisticated way.  There were multiple other courses, which I could go on about for great length, but one does run out of superlatives after a while. I do need to note the mushroom tart which was another beautifully presented and complex dish, and the duck, glazed with honey and lavender.  We were offered a choice of three desserts, and each chose one, but then they brought us one of each so we got to try them all. Last on offer was a chocolate covered pretzel, brought with a bottle of apple brandy.  We were invited to have as much brandy as we wanted.  Alas, after that cocktail (did I mention the cocktails are really good?) and a few excellent wines by the glass, we only managed a few sips of the brandy, with having to navigate LaGuardia airport in just a few short hours.  And there was a parting gift!  A glass container of granola to have for breakfast the following morning (which I did, and it was amazing).Did it live up to the hype?  Definitely.  Was it the best meal I have ever had?  Certainly I would say this was the most flawless meal in terms of presentation, quality and service I have experienced.  Literally I cannot find anything to nit pick.  The bathrooms were a little boring maybe?  I would rate this as one of the top five dining experiences ever and it will certainly always be a memorable meal.  I can't wait to come back for dinner.  Bring on the apple brandy.",5,3,4

It's pretty hard to get into so you should expect to make reservations at least a month in advance. I've since heard that they redid the whole place so I am really looking forward to paying them another visit soon! Did I mention it made it on the list of the world's TOP TEN 5 star Michelin restaurants. It's worth all the hype. Each course is more unique and beautifully presented than the next.

24,Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",214,161,131,5.0,8/23/2018,"Elegant gourmet restaurant that provides guests a unique and intimate dining experience.--THE FOOD: I mean, it's a three star Michelin restaurant, so yes the food is amazing. But the dishes are so much more than flavorful -- they are a treat for all the senses. Each course was completely distinct in its own way while subtly building off the flavors of previous dishes to provide a fully satisfying culinary experience.--FOR THE VEGGIES: My fiancé, after some pretty extensive research, selected this restaurant precisely because they were said to have one of the best vegetarian tasting menus, and we were not disappointed. --THE SERVICE: Our visit to Eleven Madison was in honor of a special occasion -- my fiancé had just proposed to me a few hours before -- and Eleven Madison made the day even more memorable with fabulous service. We were welcomed with complimentary champagne served in Tiffany glasses that they later gave to us as an engagement gift (with the signature box, ribbon, and bag of course). They also graciously gave us a second momento--a hand drawn guide to the herbal blooms featured in our meal, since my fiancé had shown such interest in them. We left so thoroughly impressed by the intimate, courteous service and the personalized, unique gifts.--THE ATMOSPHERE: We dined at Eleven Madison during the day when it was full of natural light that accentuated the elegant minimalist decor. Although the dining room was full, it maintained a peaceful, quiet feel.",2,,2

I have lots of pictures but my husband's placecard with his name is in full display , and he prefers I not post it. Incredible venue, service was not to be believed, but the food was fine. Not one dish blew my socks off. Yes, it is definitely art on a plate but I'd rather have more than one bite of each course. What if I did love it? I really wanted to. I think maybe my palate just isn't what it should be as I found everything salty and I love salt. One thing I did appreciate is that some bar patrons were getting rowdy and they squashed that nonsense immediately. Too many high end places won't do that because of the high price tag to get in. I think that was my favorite part. Yes, we did go to Shake Shack after. This girl was in NYC and she was still hungry!",6,1,3

27,Michael T.,"Fremont, CA",788,42,10,2.0,10/4/2018,"I've been holding off on writing this review as I reflected on my experience at EMP. Once ranked the #1 restaurant in the world and currently ranked the #4 in the world - I really did expect more.Food - 3.5/5: Many of the dishes were very good and some were misses. Overall the food did reflect New York clearly, but emphasized technique over flavor and innovation.Service - 1/5: The service really was some of the worse I have received at a fine dining establishment. The waiters were not very friendly and quite condescending when we asked any questions that were outside ""what is in the dish"".Lowlight: When we asked about splitting a wine pairing - they unkindly made us feel silly for even asking. There are betters ways to approach this such as offering some potentially well paired bottles or glasses. This made some of my dining companions so uncomfortable that they didn't even want to drink from the wines I had ordered, feeling that they would be ""judged"" by the waitstaff.While the food is decent, the atmosphere and particularly the service leaves a lot to be desired. In comparison to similar ranked restaurants such as Mugaritz, Azurmendi, Pujol, Quintonil, to name a few - the service here is not only bad, but completely detracted from the experience.",10,1,
28,Angel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",249,21,177,4.0,9/7/2018,"Being a former ranked ""best restaurant in the world"", the expectations were huge. As we went in we noticed a few things such as the opulently high ceilings and the elegant interior design. Everything pointed out to be a glorious night of pleasure and umami. Every dish was perfectly executed, but sadly nothing blew me away. Not the flavors in order to live up to such high honors, nor the chef's creativity and pairing of ingredients and the service lacked true carrying. Our server seemed to just go through the motions and Couldn't answer a couple of questions I threw at him which he should've been trained to answer at a venue like this.One thing that was quite weird in my opinion is how the server gives you the verbal option of picking different dishes. The options were not even written and felt peer pressured to make a quick decision.It seems that food critics place a huge premium on table side service as I though this restaurant doesn't deserve to be idolized the way it does...Best part of the meal was the take home granola and the printed menu placed in a quirky little box.",,,
29,Ada C.,"New York, NY",176,131,4,4.0,8/10/2018,"My dad saw that this restaurant was considered ""the best in the world"" so we had to come see for ourselves. It was rather difficult to get a reservation at a decent time (i.e. not at 10pm, which seemed to be the only choice for weeks), but I regularly checked the website and eventually found a reservation at 7:15pm for a Thursday night. There was hardly any signage out front, so finding the restaurant wasn't as easy as it should have been. I was greeted immediately after going through the revolving doors, and I took a seat near the host station and was given a glass of water while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive.We were seated near the front of the restaurant. The table was large enough and the chairs were so comfortable. The service here was impeccable, as expected. Our waters were constantly refilled, crumbs brushed away, and utensils replaced throughout the evening. There were a lot of courses, so I can't really remember exactly what we ate but I'll highlight some of the ones that stood out to me. The corn was amazing. The duck, one of the main courses I believe, was so delicious. My brother raved about the caviar, and my dad loved the steak. The lobster was a little chewier than I would have preferred, but still really good. The snails were fun to eat. They brought out a mini grill so we could finish grilling the snails ourselves. It included 4 sauces that you can add, and then they give you some lettuce to wrap the snails around. Dessert was good too. I wish I could say this was the best dining experience I've ever had, but it wasn't. I'm not really sure what it was; maybe my expectations were too high. Everything was just fine, but it was literally just that: fine. It didn't wow me like some other restaurants have, and the food was delicious and presented very creatively, but I don't think I would come back here because I don't think it's worth the price tag.",1,,

I would expect EMP to have a Barrel at a major distillery as for them to add to these cocktails (and potentially sell).  I paid more than $350 per plate( not counting cocktails or wine)  which should have been $200.",,,
31,Tina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",769,142,704,4.0,2/10/2018,"Eleven Madison Park, led by Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, has created a masterfully elegant experience punctuated by unique offerings, knowledgeable teammates, and a classic and yet modern environment. A solid 4.5 stars. AMBIANCE (4/5)The restaurant, which I visited shortly before it received its #1 restaurant in the world recognition, offers a high-ceilinged, refined, large main space and spotlessly-run kitchen.FOOD (4.5/5)Across 14 courses, the dinner proved to be one-of-kind, delightful, and interesting. I left stuffed! While I unfortunately forgot to snap a picture of the menu, here are some of the courses I recall:- Black and white savory cookie- Caviar eggs Benedict, deconstructed, served in a cute tin- Sturgeon sabayon with chives, served in an eggshell- Picnic basket - Foie gras layered with cabbage (unique and yummy)- Waldorf salad, made tableside (delicious)- Honey and lavender roasted duck (surprisingly dry, which we mentioned when asked how the duck was - the team apologized but didn't offer a new duck or substitute dish)Missed out on the celery root baked in a pig's bladder this time - maybe another time! SERVICE (4.5/5)A friend who's an alum of 11Mad kindly secured us reservations on short notice so we didn't experience the frenzied reservation process. The team was highly professional, attentive, friendly, and discreet. When we asked for recommendations on local restaurants the staff likes, the team quietly conferred and came back with a printed card with their suggestion (Gabriel Kreuther which later served as a great birthday lunch). Our friend had arranged for a private tour of the kitchen, complete with snow cones on which to nibble throughout. Contrary to the chaos of reality TV cooking shows, I was amazed by how operationally efficient and quiet the kitchen was. The work's divvied up across different stations, with each person a master of his/her area. Thank you, Eleven Madison, for a very special special occasion!",4,1,3
32,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",22,105,23,5.0,1/20/2018,"Eleven Madison Park was nothing short of magical. The price may be a pain point for some (especially if you're opting for the wine pairings), but when you're devouring course after course, the rest of the world comes to a complete halt, and nothing else matters. You sit there, a fork in one hand and a knife in the other, with an expression that can only be described as a stupid, dumbfounded grin. Because in that moment, you are not the you who strolls down Fifth Avenue with shopping bags in hand, or the you who takes trips to Europe to eat the best of what chefs around the world have to offer, or even the you who works tirelessly to scrape up enough disposable income to treat yourself to a night out here. In that moment, you are part of the EMP family, and you will unquestionably be treated as such from the second you step into their doors.To get some of the logistics out of the way, I came here on a Friday night at 6:15PM with my mom to celebrate her birthday. I called ahead of time to let the restaurant know the special occasion, in addition to my aversion to cheese. Along with the tasting menu, we opted for the wine pairings, along with a table-side brewing of the High Mountain Oolong tea at the end of the meal. In total, the food came out to $642 and change, and the beverages an additional $406.Overall, I just wanted to share my thoughts on a few different points:1. Wine PairingsWhile I enjoyed the wine pairings, if I were to return, I don't think I'd be getting it again. The wines were interesting, and they definitely paired well with the food that was presented, but ultimately, I don't think the varieties we were served justified the high cost. A vast majority of the wines were French - not really an issue, just something to keep in mind if you're not the biggest fan of wines that taste earthy and heavily reflect the terroir of where the grapes were grown.2. Prolonging the EMP ExperienceAt the conclusion of the meal, the restaurant gifted us a bag filled with a jar of house-made granola from that morning, along with a cleverly designed menu of all the courses we tasted that night. The menu itself is folded in the same tin can that the caviar course was presented in, and was a nice touch compared to the plain paper menus that were handed out in the past. In addition, for my mom's birthday, they also included a large chocolate bar in her bag that she has yet to taste.3. Table-side teaAt first, I didn't think the $24 price tag on a table-side experience would be worth whatever EMP had in store. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, and I actually learned a great deal about the restaurant's philosophies in brewing both tea and coffee, along with some of the science and art behind a great cup of brewed tea. The Gaiwan set they used looked and felt amazing in its pure simplicity, and the tea sommelier was kind enough to provide an extra steeping of the Oolong as well.4. FoodTo quickly touch on the courses we were served that night:* Black and White Cookie with Cheddar and Apple - B* Scallops with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter, and Scallop Broth - A+* Caviar Eggs Benedict with Smoked Ham and Sturgeon - A+* Foie Gras marinated with Squash and Pumpkin Seeds - A+* Poached Halibut with Turnip - A* Mushroom Tart with Cremini and Black Truffle & Portobello - A+* Venison un Croute with Foie Gras and Civet - B* Roasted Carrot with Buckwheat and Mustard - B+* Baked Potato with Horseradish and Bacon - B+* (Instead of Grilled Cheese) Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream and Cranberry - A-* Pear-Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice Cream - A* Chocolate Covered Pretzel & Apple Brandy - A-While EMP didn't wow us with an impeccable menu suited to our exact taste buds course after course, overall, we had a sublime evening. The granola they sent us home with is fantastic, and I'm still very happy about the fact that we got to bring home the tin can with the EMP insignia branded on the top - I actually considered just taking it during the caviar course but decided against it.Reservations may be difficult to come by and try for, and the price tag may be even more difficult to justify, but given the chance, I would do it all again in a heartbeat. Chef Daniel Humm has created not only a stunning, innovative menu that will pique your interests throughout the meal, but also an experience that you will cherish for years to come.",18,9,12
33,Ana L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,15,5.0,11/12/2018,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience at Eleven Madison Park.  We had heard amazing things about the restaurant and had booked a trip to NYC with a sole purpose of dining at EMP, so we had fairly high expectations for the experience.  We were celebrating my birthday, and a few days prior to the reservation, the maitre d' reached out asking for dining preferences, general preferences (what do I like, need, etc.), and also offered to facilitate floral arrangements on my boyfriend's behalf.  When we walked in, we were promptly seated and were greeted by a handwritten birthday card that reflected my aesthetic preferences, and the magic began.  From the engraved bag hook to a private kitchen tour, the hospitality and attention to detail was nothing short of world class.  Food was amazing as expected as well - some of my favorites from the night include the dry aged duck (my boyfriend got the venison and was pleasantly surprised as well), the potato souffle with caviar, and the truffle pot dish.  I think we spent about three hours in the restaurant.  Sometimes for me, sitting three hours through food with long gaps in between gets tiring and a little boring (this was my experience at Per Se, where the ambiance is more strict / formal), but time truly flew by and I enjoyed every minute, thanks to their amazing staff and neighboring tables. It seems that their menu changes significantly every month or so, so I'll definitely come back in not too distant future.  Thanks again to team EMP for your hospitality!!",,,

As has been noted already, the food here was decent, but not great; simply done, but simple to a fault. The good: * The tasting menu is on the more ""affordable"" side of things at ~$300 - for a 3 Michelin starred restaurant in a large metropolitan city, that's a good deal * The truffle course & the caviar benedict course were good* The ambiance & decor of the restaurant were perfect - just the right combo of fancy / casualThe bad:* Unfortunately, most of the plates were ""just ok"" :-( For example, the dry aged duck was tough and overcooked; the greens dish was served on top of an unappetizing slice of ""rye custard,"" aka a cold, soggy piece of rye bread; the mulled wine ice cream had ice flakes in it (indicating that it was melted, and then frozen again). Etc. * Plating was not entirely impressive, which I imagine is partially due to simplicity of ingredientsI didn't walk out of the restaurant thinking that I had just eaten at the ""best restaurant in the world"", but I believe it's unfair to hold any restaurant to such an impossible (if not mythical) standard.

So what happened was that the waiter dropped a glass of wine on my boyfriend's trousers and the wine also spilled onto his white shoes. There was no apology from the waiter. He didn't say any word. Seems like he didn't feel sorry at all. All he did was clean up the spill on the floor, picked up all the broken glass pieces, and went away. He then came back with a new glass of wine, but still didn't say anything. I'm pretty sure he can speak because he speaks a lot when introducing us about the dishes. We were stupid that we gave him normal tips. Four stars for the food, my boyfriend enjoyed the ""picnic scene"" course but the caviar that day was below the level. Negative stars for the service.

Literally amazing.  I had the tilefish after that, which was very mustardy and kind of took away from the flavor of the flaky fish.  There was then a presentation of a pumpkin which sounds weird, but it was kind of cool.  They opened it up in front of you and then took it away and served the most melt in your mouth pumpkin with a light broth.  In between dishes, we got an (expensive?) bottle of wine and the sommelier did a really cool presentation where they basically melted off the neck of a wine bottle - would recommend this for anyone who feels bougie.Next was the most DELICIOUS piece of seared duck with Sichuan peppercorn ever.  Favorite dish of the night.  This rivals Momofuku Ko's duck which was one of my favorites also.There were a few little side dishes and what not, but nothing to call home about.  We got a play on pretzels, cheese and beer that I really wasn't a huge fan of, but everyone else loved it.For dessert, we all shared all the options except the cranberry one and they were all amazing, especially the apple cider donut.  At the end we also got ""chocolate pretzels"".All in all, a divine dining experience that everyone should absolutely do once, but I would not quite say this was the most amazing meal or dining experience of my life...

41,Arash R.,"Chicago, IL",193,94,185,3.0,12/21/2017,"Eleven Madison Park - the world's number one restaurant for 2017 as we all know and when you make plans to eat at the world's best the expectations sky rocket and I guess that's where I went wrong. We got here on a Wednesday evening for a 9 pm reservation. It was my birthday so I thought what better place to have dinner than EMP. We were greeted at the door by their very courteous and professional staff , seated in the lounge till our table was ready and started off with our drinks. Cranberry cocktail was very refreshing even on a cold night and the Sauv was crisp and fruity , great selection. We were seated at our table in 15 minutes and our first course that included Caviar , Beet with trout roe , cucumber with pumpernickel & salmon , potato with quail egg & mustard and Mackerel wit fennel & salmon was adjust served in gift boxes - a perfect gesture to a birthday celebration. We opened the boxes and found all these treats. It was served with everything bagel and crackers , this was a great way to start and I told myself this is totally worth all the wait. Everything mentioned above was delicious especially potato with quail egg and the caviar. It was fresh and full of flavour. My taste buds felt they were in wizard of oz. Foie Gras with cabbage and apple follows next. I have had Foie Gras all the way from Beijing to LA and I felt it did not keep up with the way things started , the flavour was dull and didn't quite hold itself. Next was Tilefish with parsnip and pike roe. I was excited for the tilefish until I was not. The parsnip and pike roe sounded it would go perfect with tilefish but again the flavour fell short. I felt they just did not blend well together and the flavour fell flat. Following the tilefish was pumpkin roasted with seaweed and bacon. It was brought to the table and cut in front of us. It smelt delicious and once presented to us with pork broth an absolute delight to eat. The flavour was perfect and the aroma just added to the texture and taste. The main entree succeeded the pumpkin. I had the duck that is aged for 3 weeks glazed with honey , lavender and apple. I like duck because of the savoury flavour it carries usually. The glazing is the craftsmanship of a genius but disappointingly the duck was dried out a little more than normal which made it like any other protein just hard and deprived of its flavour. It was served with kale with pearl onion and potato confit to share which were both very decent.   My favourite part of every meal to end the dinner - dessert. I had apple cider doughnut with cinnamon ice cream , you can never go wrong with that. Very well done. Finally a masterly crafted chocolate covered pretzel which cleansed the palate pretty well. Dessert I felt was average but at EMP I guess I wasn't expecting average. The berry combination that my friend had was actually very delicious and something you'd expect at a place like this. We were brought a bottle of signature of EMP apple brandy to sip , on the house and it was pretty solid. If I already hadn't had 3 glasses of wine I would've definitely enjoyed it more. To wrap up the evening we were brought a small bag to take home which had our menu folded in a tiny box along with some granola. A very beautiful gesture and elegantly presented. To summarise , the staff went above and beyond , very pleasant and accommodating. The food was good overall but when at a place like this or at the best restaurant in the world you expect something much better than you can find elsewhere. I was a little bit disappointed but as I said in the beginning maybe I just had too high of expectations. I compared it Oriole which I felt surpassed them in flavour. Thank you EMP for the experience :)",4,1,1
42,Jaana S.,"Glen Head, NY",298,166,165,5.0,12/27/2017,"This experience was truly sublime. It's no wonder this is the #1 restaurant in the world! I came here with my family to celebrate my 21st birthday and the staff went above and way way waaaay BEYOND to make my birthday special. They even made me an extremely cute personalized driver's license ID (which involved them running to a nearby Staples to get it laminated). Because it was my 21st birthday, I got two cocktails. I first tried to seaweed one...which i LOVED. I followed that up with the apple cocktail, which was also very good. In terms of food, it was all really exciting! Everything was presented very beautifully. I especially loved the savory cheesecake course. The so-called ""caviar"" course was a very fun homage to NYC, and the everything bagel crust was very wow. Another standout was the cookies and cream dessert. My only complaint was that I wanted more. My family and I also raved about the beer, cheese, and pretzel fondue course, the scallop broth and bread course, and the scallop and uni course. Each and every course, however, was simply amazing. I licked every plate they put in front of me clean.",2,4,1
43,Zachary E.,"Tenafly, NJ",11,37,140,2.0,11/5/2018,"Was treated to a meal here by a friend and the 10 of us sat in a private room upstairs.  The menu seemed perfect, a mix of my favorites and everything I would want to hit up at a meal like this.  The service was very good as expected, though I would have expected more knowledge of ingredients for such an establishment.  Waiter was not sure the origin of the beef besides it being from Pat La Freda, the waitress was not sure of the name of the town in LI the salt came from, and not much info on the type of duck breast we were eating besides it being dry aged 14 days. Quick summary, 3 of the 9 dishes including amuse were inedible. Lets start with that amuse which was some sort of porcini cream in egg shell.  the first bite was so salt, I thought I just got a lump of salt, but the next bite confirmed it was all too salty and I tried it once more to make sure and could not finish.  Most people at table agreed.  Eggs Benedict course was a nice caviar dish reminiscent of the Jewish holidays, as it was basically caviar on top of whitefish salad that was probably made with cream cheese or butter.  Then came the Foie gras torchon which was nice, creamy, elegant, but should have been served with toast to cut the creaminess.  It was small, but tough to finish because it tasted like you were eating raw butter. next came butter poached lobster which was nice but poorly poached which left the lobster chewy.  The turnip, just yuck, not bad, gross.  Don't know what to say.  Many of the dishes actually had a very similar umami flavor, but just way too woodsy. Next was beef, was a roasted filet of unknown origin besides pat la freda.  covered in trumped mushrooms and served with a chestnut gravy.  My meat had a nice crust and perfectly cooked interior.  Was super duper tender and nice.  I tried a friends leftover and hers was leftover because it was all just red center without much crust because she had a center cut piece when mine had been an end cut.  Meat was good, but really expected something more special at EMP, maybe something with some age.  Next up was the duck which was the star of the night.  The szechuan pepper corns made my tongue tingle a little.  the skin was crispy and the meat was a perfect medium rare.  I finished 2 other people's duck as well. Next course of ""honeynut squash"" was actually a cheese course and was the third inedible dish of the night. the cracker was nice, but the squash cheddar mix was not for me, or most at the table.  Finished off with the Milk and Honey which like the duck was also amazing and what I expected of EMP.  On the way out, we were given the granola for breakfast in the AM but I finished most of mine in the uber home, its special. Overall very disappointed in the meal.  Can't believe there were 3 courses I literally could not finish based on the taste.  I'm an animal and have a really hard time not finishing everything in front of me! not here.  I think it was perhaps a result of not eating from main kitchen where they obviously keep their A team.",,,
44,Tung N.,"Arlington, TX",496,139,146,3.0,12/11/2017,"Being the foodie that I am, I had to check out the world's #1 restaurant when I was in New York. It was really all hype and no sizzle. If I was rating this restaurant based on service alone, it would easily be a 5 star. However, factoring in the food, it brought it down to a 3. There was simply no single dish that blew me away. We had to make reservations as soon as it was available, and even then, we had to settle for the 9:45PM slot. Everything from the atmosphere to the service to the opening presentation was great. However, when the food started to arrive, the disappointment started to set in. There were a few good dishes, don't get me wrong (foie gras, duck, berry dessert). I just did not feel like it was up to my standards. Maybe I walked in with such high standards given its reputation, but I left wanting more. If you got the wine pairing, they gave you a kitchen tour, so that was a cool touch.They gave us the menu and a jar of granola as a takeaway, which was cool as a keepsake. The experience was awesome, but the food just fell short, and that's really what it comes down to, right?",5,1,
45,Rene A.,"Grapevine, TX",0,9,6,5.0,9/18/2018,"More than anticipated. Very comfortable atmosphere and the food was more than impressive.

46,Stephen R.,"Manhattan, NY",140,6,1,5.0,9/8/2018,"I wish I could give 6 stars!!!  We had an intimate wedding celebration in a private room. The private dining coordinator, Cecilia made the process easy and seamless. The meal was beyond our expectations. We started with a 1/2 hour of champagne and pass around bites. It's hard to say which bite was packed with more flavor. The white fish with caviar, the carrot tartare with horseradish, the scallops on the half shell or the fois gras with strawberries. The bites were small but so flavorful and balanced. The best part was seeing everyone's faces with each bite. The entrees, dessert, wedding cake, and wine selections were also truly amazing. When we asked our guests, what was the tastiest dish, the answer was unanimous. EVERYTHING!  The poached lobster and tornados of beef were amazing choices. I need to mention the excellent service. From start to finish the staff was warm, friendly, welcoming and gracious attending to our guests individual needs. By the time we left I felt I had one of the best dining experiences ever. This was an expensive meal but well worth it. Thanks Eleven Madison Park.",1,,1
47,Tina F.,"San Clemente, CA",221,175,83,5.0,8/22/2018,"Flew to New York as a surprise anniversary gift from my husband. I've been wanting to go to this restaurant since our last trip with family and friends two years ago but it's very tough to get reservations for a big group at this restaurant. Specially during the holidays. Less than a week before our flight we made reservations at various restaurants that came highly recommended. Then the day before our flight, I glanced upon a book while I was rearranging our credenza in the dining room. It's the Eleven Madison Park book that I've kept in our dining room! I thought we might as well try to make the reservation and hope for the best! They had no available seating so we chose the option the join the waitlist because it says sold out on the dates we chose. Then the next morning, aboard the plane right before our flight we got a call about a cancellation and we were told that there's an availability! I was so happy! This was meant to be! The restaurant is beautiful specially the huge windows where you can see the trees at Madison Park! I enjoyed every dish that was served! The ingredients were very fresh and just delicious! The dishes that stood out is the Camembert cheese with creme fraiche and basil/parsley pesto, escargot with mushroom that was served on a tabletop grill and then you remove it with tweezers and wrap it in lettuce & chard leaf and the cookie that was given first that's in a box  before the start of the meal. The duck and the steak was good but nothing memorable or exceptional. I also absolutely love the dish with caviar. It was deliciously prepared! After our meal we got to tour their kitchen! It was surprising to see 40 plus people in there! Everyone were very focused on each dish they are making. It looks very artistic, creative and so beautiful! They change menus every season! I'm looking forward to trying their winter menu next time! Hopefully on our next lunch/dinner here we get to catch a glimpse  of the genius Mr. Humm!",2,1,2
48,Joe L.,"Dallas, TX",7,60,165,4.0,11/2/2017,"Honest review from a personal point of view is that I love the place, I love the ambience, and I loved just sitting there at my table enjoying the air. It was as if they pumped more oxygen into the room to keep me calm and relaxed just by being there. This review is hard for me because I am honestly not sure whether to give 4 or 5 stars. Despite everything being good, there was only 1 dish that I thought was truly amazing flavor-wise. And that was their mushroom dish. Everything else was extremely visually appealing and the whole experience was wonderful, but as a true foodie it is tough for me to give them a perfect 5. The way in which each dish is presented definitely gave me moments of awe as I sat there mesmerized at the presentation and manipulation of common ingredients brought about in different ways.Note: Everything was good but only 1 was greatAs for the service and experience it is definitely 5 stars for me. At the end of the meal, they give you your personalized  tasting menu written in the order of presentation alongside some oats for breakfast the next day. One of the things that gave me such an added boost is that there is no dress code!!! Yes no dress code!! Just be comfortable!Overall, I highly recommend anyone who is willing to spend a little, to give this place a try as the experience is dazzling, the servers are friendly, and they make you feel like victorian age nobility. However, I don't think I would return for a long time due to the difficulty in procuring a reservation and maybe cause my palette just isn't sophisticated enough to be completely entranced with their food.",5,,1
49,Nailun C.,"Chicago, IL",156,42,113,4.0,1/21/2018,"My best friend and I decided to go here since this place was rated the best restaurant in the world. It also has 3 Michelin stars. We were looking forward to eating here. The experience is pretty good however I don't think it was the best food or experience ever. My friend and I also went to Next restaurant in Chicago a few months ago and I have to say the food and experience was better. We've also been to Per se in New York before as well. And Eleven Madison Park is definitely Better so I thought a four star was fair for the experience. My favorite dish here was the scallop with sea urchin,scallop butter and broth. It was very super refreshing and I love the apple slices with it as well it really mixed well with the seafood. Another favorite was the Halibut poached with Variation of Turnip. Best Halibut ever! The caviar Benedict is pretty good too. However I have to say the rendition made by the Next chef was slightly better...The Mushroom Tart with Cremona and black truffle was pretty cool too. They do this fancy plating in front of you. The dessert is nothing special though. The dessert at Perse and Next restaurant is definitely better! So I would say overall not sure if it was worth the price but I am still glad I tried it once but would probably not go back.",,,

The food is absolutely mouth watering and allows you to try food that very well otherwise wouldn't! The portions are small enough to allow you to enjoy every course! The service... well picture being treated like royalty! (My favorite!) even if the food weren't that great I would pay the same amount simply for the service! This last time we visited we had a tour of the kitchen and oh my god! Such a fun experience to see where the magic happens!

My actually favorite were the sturgeon cheesecake with caviar, it tasted just like a lox which is funny because I had one that same day as breakfast at russ & daughters, the duck and I also tried my friend's lamb. One of the desserts was black and gray, but tasted just like key lime pie, delicious. Basically almost everything was great. I was feeling so special when we were invited to the kitchen and offered an hors d'oeuvre made by obe of the chefs until we realized most people get the same experience LOL...stil cool.

They made different flavors really stand out while keeping them harmonious with each other. Unlike having barbeque or hot pot, dining here feels almost like wandering in a perfume store. You will enjoy the general feeling of the product, but you can't really distinguish the actual food's taste.The only exception is perhaps the main dish. We had ribeyes and duck breast. They both emphasized tenderness and flavor. But they also mixed in their own novelty.To be honest, I would rather feel the original flavor of the ingredients.

58,Roland H.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",42,170,423,5.0,5/27/2018,"Can anyone give Eleven Madison Park less than 5 stars? Eleven Madison Park has been ranked the number one restaurant in the world and is the holder of 3 Michelin Stars so who am I to give it less than 5 stars (for a Yelp review). Eleven Madison Park is a exactly what you would expect from a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant. The detail to the service, food and cocktails are exceptional. The spacious art deco decor of the restaurant adds to the atmosphere - invokes an air of grandeur that is fitting for the production that will unfold over the 3 hour tasting menu.Daniel Humm's cooking is heart of the hallowed Eleven Madison Park. He is a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. We tried the spring tasting menu. Some of the highlights included: (1) cheesecake with smoke sturgeon caviar, (2) lobster butter poached with ginger and dandelion greens, (3) snails grilled with morels and ramps, and (4) lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella.  The dishes were all innovative and creative. It was essentially art on a plate. Dining at Eleven Madison Park will set you back $315 (US) per person (before cocktails). It is definitely worth the price if you enjoy food and fine dining.  Eleven Madison Park is one of the best. I have been asked how Eleven Madison Park compared to other 3 Michelin Stars restaurants such as Per Se, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, Joel Robuchon and Alain Ducasse. It is difficult to compare. I enjoyed all of these restaurants. There were dishes that were unique to each of these restaurants that I enjoyed. All of these 3 Michelin Stars restaurants were worth the money paid.  What you have to keep in mind is that a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant is a production - it is the opportunity to experience some of the best dishes prepared by some of the best Chefs in the industry.",,,
59,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,5/7/2018,"TLDR: worth checking out for the experience, but have had better food at a lower price point; creative dishes; excellent service; dining in luxuryHave never been to a three star Michelin restaurant before and with its recent renovation and #1 status on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2017, Eleven Madison Park seemed like the right pick. Despite its steep price point (~$350 per person for the tasting menu, inclusive of tax and tip), reservations are difficult to come by, so a friend and I planned about a month and a half in advance. Reservations through Tock open up the first of every month at 9am ET for reservations during the subsequent month. We secured a 9pm reservation on a Friday through the help of the American Express Concierge.On the night of our reservation, we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and had our coats checked. The main dining room was bright and elegant, with high ceilings, large windows, crown moulding, modern chandeliers, and white table cloth tables. The bar area was a bit more intimate, with dim lighting, a fully-stocked back-lit bar, and large lounge chairs.Service was impeccable, where everyone addressed you by your name, took extra precaution around allergies, and generally made you feel like royalty. Our meal lasted about four hours, and we decided to order a bottle of red wine to pair with our tasting menu. Luckily, they gave us a tin with a paper accordion listing everything we ate (listed below with commentary). I can't remember when it was served, but there was also a bread course with salted butter. The bread was soft, warm, buttery, and generally amazing--we enjoyed it so much we got two servings of it. We were also given a tin of granola to take home.  1. Black and white cookie with cheddar and apple - small savory bites; kind of reminded me of fancy cheez-its in regards to taste2. Asparagus with smoked egg salad, daikon with ramps and pike roe, quail egg with radish and mustard greens, and spring peas with trout roe and lemon - served on wooden hexagons; light and refreshing3. Cheesecake with smoked sturgeon, caviar, everything bagel, and white asparagus - similar in texture to a traditional cheesecake, but savory4. Fluke marinated with daikon and sorrel - light and refreshing, similar to ceviche5. Lobster butter-poached with ginger and dandelion greens - one of my favorite courses; lobster was perfectly cooked and flavorful6. Snails grilled with morels and ramps - the presentation of this was really entertaining, as the snails were on kebab sticks and cooked at the table in a large fire; flavorful combination of snails and mushrooms7. Lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella - this was a bit of a disappointment, as the lamb tasted overcooked / old; the other option was duck, which my friend got--I tried a bite of that and it was pretty good8. Mustard greens with garlic and horseradish and snow peas with goat cheese and lemon - tasty accompaniments to our main courses 9. Goat cheese variations with rhubarb chutney - I didn't particularly like this course, as it wasn't quite sweet enough to feel like a dessert and the texture was a bit mushy10. Chocolate with milk ice cream and shortbread - rich and sweet; the chocolate was balanced out well by the milk ice cream11. Chocolate covered pretzel served with apple brandy - tasted like any other chocolate covered pretzel; the apple brandy was strong and aromatic; an entire bottle was served to us and we were told we could have as much as we liked (we both only had one serving though)While the food was good, I would hesitate to say it was worth $350.

We had the eleven course retrospective menu, and I can't emphasize enough how perfect the whole experience was.I am not going to elaborate on each and one of the courses because it will literally be my repeating the same adjectives over and over again trying to describe how impressed I was. Pictures say more than the words so I have attached some photos. Presentation of each dish was very pretty, and the server explained about each course.. how and where they fit into the chronological timeline of EMP.I really enjoyed how they made the carrot tartare in front of each table,how they poured the sea water to our seafood dish to reproduce the atmosphere of where the ingredients came from, and many other presentations that kept us captivated.Food was excellent, dessert was excellent, service was excellent. We were full after the eleven courses but they serve you enough portion for each course so that you don't leave with uncomfortable feeling.I'm sure it's obvious but drinks, coffee, teas are extra (not part of $300). They give you the jar of granola to take home along with the menu of all the dishes that were served. Had great time.",8,,2
62,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,1/17/2018,"I'm not sure what there is to say that's not already been said. Eleven Madison Park was a superb dining experience. There's a reason it's consistently showered with awards and placed on prestigious list after prestigious list. Things here are done so impeccably, so pristinely, it almost felt too composed. The amount of preparation that so clearly goes into every aspect of the EMP experience is truly remarkable. The menu, the service, the wine pairings--all choreographed and executed to perfection. I suppose one should expect this considering the price tag on a meal here. But you never really know until you try. And try, we did. My boyfriend--the best there is and ever was--got us a reservation here for my birthday. I'm a big-time foodie, but not the type you'll find at Michelin spots. I like to splurge when I dine out, but there's a line and places like the EMPs, Per Ses and Le Bernadines of the world are far beyond what I'm willing/able to pay. So this was just all kinds of special. Now, this point is important because I don't have any similar experiences to compare our night at EMP to. We've never done a long tasting menu before and we've only done a handful of prix fixe nights out. But I've had the pleasure of eating at a lot of really really good restaurants in NYC, so I'd like to think my two cents is still worth something. So we arrived here for our 8:45 reservation and walked into splendor. Coats were taken and we were delivered to our seats. We opted for the standard wine pairing, which is $175/pp. If you're going to drink and are a fan of wine, I think this is probably your best option. It's expensive, but the alcohol on the menu here is just wildly expensive--even the half-bottles (try to keep in mind that I'm a millennial with a modest salary who has a hobby that she really has no business trying to afford)--so the pairing made the most sense for us. And it was delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered different dishes when the option was available to try as many dishes as possible, which meant we got to sample a wonderful variety of wines as well. The only instance in which I'd recommend going with a bottle or half-bottle (or cocktails) is if you're a lightweight/aren't a huge drinker. I think the pairing amounts to about 4-5 glasses of wine, which might be a serious undertaking for some. That said, the meal does last 3+ hours so the alcohol intake is somewhat moderated. When I review restaurants, I tend to list the dishes we try and grade each one. We had a nine-course meal at EMP, so it would be hopeless (for the sheer reason that I'd run out of characters almost immediately, a roadblock I face virtually every time I write a review on here). I'll list what we received here but give some more general commentary/give little shoutouts to the highlights. All listed chronologically to give an idea of flow:*Apple / Cheddar Black and White Cookie: A+*Scallop Live with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter and Broth: A+*Caviar Benedict with Smoked Ham, Sturgeon, and Hollandaise, served w/ mini English Muffins: A++Squid grilled w/ Juniper and Horseradish: A+Foie Gras Seared w/ Maple and Apple: A++Lobster butter-poached w/ Butternut Squash and Chestnut: A++Halibut poached w/ variations of Turnip: A*Mushroom Tarte w/ Crimini and Black Truffle: A++*Crimini and Portobello served w/ mains: AHoney and Lavender-glazed Duck w/ Cabbage: A+*Potato baked w/ Horseradish and Bacon: A*Leek w/ roasted Hazelnut and Parmesan: AVenison en Croute w/ Fois Gras and Civet: A+*Cheese tart: A+Pear Donut: A+Chocolate-covered Pretzels* = both receivedThe only real surprise with everything here was the presentation/aesthetics. Nothing was particularly colorful or fancy. Quite simple, superficially, far more complex when you take a bite. I don't know if that's intentional on EMP's part, but it was almost peculiar. That's hardly a gripe though, everything was just delicious and brought out at the perfect pace. The wine pairings were delightful, thoughtful and certainly enhanced the consumption experience. Highlights/notes:-The black and white cookie was as a mind-f*** and a tasty one at that-Everyone should wrap their uni in a live scallop blanket -Hard to get more decadent than caviar eggs benedict and my god, I have never tried to take a longer time eating something-You will never insult squid again by ordering it fried after having this squid preparation-I said that thing about decadence with the eggs benny but I maybe already changed my mind because that foie gras knocked me over-The best entertainment out there is watching someone shave truffle over something you're about to eat and then eating that something with pride-Duck can be big, ugly, messy and tasty or elegant, refined, clean and tasty. I love duck. Duck is tasty. This duck was as good as it gets. -I don't like donuts but I loved this donut. What else is new?-Gold pretzels. Mic drop.",8,4,6

(You have to be a soccer fan to understand the point I am making).For those of you who cannot get a reservation, they do have a bar area that looked really live and for the most part, you do have the same menu,  just not as many dishes due to the lack of space. Some dishes come with quite the presentation which you should expect. I scored a tour of the kitchen and I was so appreciative as the experience never gets old. They had row upon row of ducks hanging and it reminded me of an image you might see in a cartoon except this image was very real and I knew within a short period of time, I would be dining on one of those ducks. The entire staff that I came into contact with were very professional and courteous. Rene was my server and she was wonderful. They definitely know how to take care of their guests which was shocking to discover that they do not accept gratuity! I have dined all over the world as some of the most exquisite restaurants and this is the first time that I have encountered one of this quality where gratuity was not necessary. The food was exquisite and while there is no need to go into detail about every dish as the menu changes seasonally, the lavender crusted duck was magnificent. The flavors....wow.So, Eleven stares the #1 spot with French Laundry, except the biggest difference is at FL, they gave me so many desserts, I felt like I was Marie Antoinette and I was in heaven as dessert is so my thing. Eleven is way more conservative on this point. I had a choice of 1 dessert, I also got their infamous delish chocolate covered pretzel with a shot of apple brandy and to go, I was presented with their granola with blueberries which I savored over the course of 2 days. Um, can I buy this granola on a regular basis? It's that damn good!Eleven is such a treat and I hope to be able to make it a yearly tradition to dine here.",3,1,1

Great services from beginning to end. There are probably more people working than people eating in the restaurant. Lol. Not the most expensive Michelin three star in NYC, but the experience was great. Complimentary bottle of granola at the end, and even a tour of the kitchen! For the interior, love the super high ceiling and huge window. The view was beautiful. Really enjoyed the dinning experience overall.",,,1
65,Hang T.,"San Jose, CA",392,897,2206,4.0,7/11/2017,"This review is long overdue, but definitely necessary. When you plan to eat at Eleven Madison Park, it has to be one of those dining experience that you save for a special occasion. With a name like this, you know that you are getting upscale service and cuisine. Even reading the name out loud makes me feel like I need to be wear something prim and proper when I eat here. At first you walk in and the building looks like an old bank building; high ceilings and very classy. The service is great off the bat. Everyone is so friendly and wanting to make your dining experience memorable. The overall atmosphere was casual and not as stuck up as I thought it would be. With the tasting menu, we tried a variety of dishes. The most memorable for me was the celery root being cooked inside an animal's stomach I believe, and they do this at your table. Another great dish was their oysters which was served two ways on one plate: savory and sweet. So delectable. My favorite though was the lobster dish. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I liked their savory dishes more than the sweet. As we go through each dish, I notice their flavors are more traditional. I tasted a lot of maple syrup and apple flavors in multiple courses, but the presentation is always creative and out of the box. As a final treat after all that good food, they also gave us some homemade granola to go as a nice parting gift. So nice of them. If you are a foodie, want to impress a date, spoil your significant other, or just want an unique dinner experience, Eleven Madison Park is a place to try.",4,2,1
66,T J.,"New York, NY",88,47,0,5.0,10/16/2018,"Eleven Madison park has now become my favorite restaurant. My husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary. From the moment we stepped in, we felt warm and welcomed. The staff is extremely friendly and want to make sure you have a genuinely fantastic experience. Having been to other 3 michelin star restaurants including Le Bernardin (which was also amazing), what sets apart Eleven Madison park is the warm and friendly staff who make you feel like family. The food is exceptional. We went just in time for the fall menu and we devoured every single item in the almost 10 course meal. They really space apart the courses, so you never feel rushed to finish any meal. We really enjoyed speaking to several staff members especially the connoisseur Erica who was lovely and very informative. The staff also took us on a tour of the kitchen and we were given delicious, warm cider during the tour. Towards the end of our meal, they offered us brandy and choclate covered pretzels which were delicious. They also gave each of us a souvenir or breakfast granola in a jar along with a customized menu of everything we ordered for the meal.This was, by far, the best dining experience of my life and we will definitely come back to celebrate yet another milestone in our lives. Thank you to the exceptional staff of Eleven Madison Park.",,,

The overall experience is pretty good, however I don't think it was the best food or most memorable experience I've ever had. Most importantly, I FOUND A PIECE OF HAIR IN MY DRINK. I had to flag down my waiter and he was able to change it for me. A bit later towards the end of the meal, a tiny tiny tiny bug flew into my cheese course... so I just stop eating. I had the Dining Room summer Tasting menu. Tomato soup, Foie gras, lobster, snails were amazing. Pan seared foie gras was so buttery and juicy, it was one of my fav of all time.

After left the restaurant, I barely remember any dishes we had without looking at the photo we took. And we had four dishes of daikon.

Everything we had was delicious and unique. The staff was fun and the presentation of everything was incredible. Not to mention we were sent away with a tin that we ate out of earlier full of our menu, and a big jar of granola for breakfast! My absolute favorites of the night were the egg salad asparagus and snow pea fish egg starters, the bread (tasted like a croissant!), the incredible caviar course with a savory cheesecake and everything bagel crust, my amazing spring salad, the lobster, the table grilled snails with morels, and my mom's chocolate dessert! At the end of our meal we also received a chocolate pretzel and a small glass of apple cider that was the perfect thing to end on! Loved this place.

Waitress went out of her way to explain the menu and accommodate any particular dietary needs.  Every server made sure water was always topped off and the entire group really embodied the definition of service with a smile. The food is an experience more than a meal. Every bite brings different tastes and reactions.  There were extremely high points in the meal from the fish (bass) to the amazing desserts.  The only dish we both didnt enjoy was the squid 2 ways which didnt work at all for either my wife or I.  Every other dish blended taste and presentation perfectly together.  Please see included pictures for almost every dish we had.",1,,1

75,Dan W.,"New York, NY",7,7,4,4.0,4/24/2018,"Went on a Saturday for a 9:45pm reservation. The atmosphere is very clean, elegant, and inviting since the revamp - nothing over the top which I like. The whole meal took about 3 hours.Food:I had their spring menu, which they said had a ""green"" theme throughout all the courses. Unfortunately for me this meant a lot of peas, which I'm not really a fan of (of course can't knock them for this).The wild braised duck was my favorite course and truly stood out - I thought it was one of the best ducks I've ever had. The cheesecake with everything bagel crust and caviar on top, the lobster course, and the grilled snails were the three other courses that stood out to me. Other than that, everything was very good but nothing mind blowing / anything to rave about.Alcohol:During the dinner I had two of their special whiskey cocktails with edelflower, which was super delicious ! Also had their tableside Manhattan (ordered with a hint of smokey mezcal) which was good/solid.During the dessert, they give you a full bottle of this apple brandy and you can have as much as you want - the alcohol wasn't very tasty but a nice concept.Overall:It's worth going, but for the #1 restaurant in the world, can't help but felt my experience fell short of that lofty title. The food as a whole was excellent but nothing spectacular compared to some other comparable Michelin star restaurants I've been to. If I go back, I would order a la carte at the bar and pick a few courses I like (and of course - have their absolutely delicious cocktails).",,,
76,Sonja H.,"Honolulu, HI",91,70,277,5.0,6/6/2017,"I am snobby enough to have thought that all the hype over the years about EMP was just that, no way it could be that good. Well, I stand corrected, EMP has definitely earned its title as best restaurant in the world (per 2017's San Pellegrino's list). For those of you that like me, may have been living under a rock these last several years, EMP offers an 11-course tasting menu (estimated to take about 3.5 hours to get through) and a policy of asking for payment when the reservation is booked (leaving you to only pay for your drinks on the night of the reservation). Since EMP is slated to close this summer in order to undergo huge kitchen and dining room reservations, the menu they are currently offering is their greatest hits dishes from over the year.Every dish was amazing. From the simpler (in presentation anyway) dishes such as gougeres with grated gruyere to grinding up carrots tableside for their carrot tartare dish or serving a turbot with zucchini scales, everything was phenomenal. My personal favority was a foie gras torchon which maple syrup on the inside.The service was top notch as well. I asked for one of the hostess's where the ladies room and waited for her to give the regular ""turn right/left and walk down the corridor..."" instructions. But not at EMP. Here I was escorted all the way to the door of the ladies room.The pacing of the meal was excellent as well. Since it was just two of us for dinner and we didn't end up drinking, we finished up after about 2.5 hours. However, it seemed that we were not the norm as we finished far in advance of the other tables that were leisurely enjoying their wine pairing, etc.My favorite part of the meal had to be our interaction with the general manager(?) at the end. We ordered tableside tea (more curious about what that entailed than anything else) and were treated with a wonderful presentation where he discussed and demonstrated a one versus three-steeping process and answered our questions about the restaurant renovations and what would happen to the staff (they are opening a pop-up restaurant over the summer in the Hampton's and a major driver of that decision was to provide employment to their best asset... their people).Lastly, they finished off the meal with offering us a complementary glass of brandy for my husband and sparkling (non-alcoholic) cider for me. I was very impressed with how well they were paying attention. My husband had ordered 1-drink at the bar while (due to a crappy cold) I ordered two non-alcoholic drinks and mostly drank water at the table. The waitstaff, with everything else going on, was able to notice that my husband would be inclined to drink the brandy, while correctly surmising that I would need to go the non-alcoholic route.The final impressive touch came with our parting gift. Most of the high-end restaurants are now in the habit of providing an extra food treat to take home and EMP was no exception, except that instead of a tiny tin of cookies or chocolate, we received two large glass canisters of granola.",10,2,4
77,Adeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,99,144,4.0,7/11/2018,"As a foodie this is probably one of those must go places.  Since this is a 3-stars Michelin restaurant it is best reserve for special occasions.  I booked this meal for my husband's birthday and it was a great experience.   I don't think I have even prepaid any meals in my lifetime but hey there's first time for everything.  So I booked the Bar tasting menu.  When we arrived out table was not ready but the hostess make sure we were comfortable and seated in the waiting area.  She was pleasant and approachable as not being stuffy as I would imagine a place of 3-star Michelin would be.  Later we were told that our bar table would not be ready in time and hey upgraded us to the dining room and also from 5 to 8 tasting menu.  Who would say no to that! It is a Nuevo cuisine restaurant which means it is traditional in the sense that it is small plate, taste and presentation in such that it is about quality and not quantity.  The wine pairing and the choices of their wine is far most the most impressive thing about this place! I think the food is great but the wine it excellent.  We were told tonight was the first summer tasting menu so I have to say it was perfect.  So why the 4 but not 5 stars? Well I am not going to lie, this was wonderful but I was still hungry after this very expensive meal.  It is neuvo cuisine after all.",,1,

79,Leah S.,"West Vancouver, Canada",0,1,3,2.0,6/4/2018,"Bland, everything about this restaurant is bland. We were in town for a short vacation, and were so excited about getting to experience this so called number one restaurant in the world! What a shame it only left us with disappointment. Food was below average standard of Michelin 3 star restaurants. New York alone we have visited Le Bernadine, Jean George and Daniels when they were still 3 stars. Food wise Daniels was not as good but still better than 11 Madison Park......Almost everything was sour, from the beginning to just before main dish, and the sesame dessert didn't have any taste other than sourness. The snail dish was the worst, while snail was stiff and chewy, with seasoning that's not really working. One of the snail was not cleaned properly and had ""dirt"" that tasted bitter.I could accept the duck dish as duck meat was cooked alright, while my mom absolutely hated the crispy seasoning on top of duck skin.If without the pictures I took of the food, I would have already forgotten what I have eaten tonight......Apart from food, the atmosphere was more casual compared to other Michelin 3 star restaurants, which is just a matter of preference. Interior decor is bland, nothing adds any characteristics to the space that's worth comment on. As an interior designer, I don't like the way they have the tables placed, boring and awkward. Service is nothing special, definitely not as detailed as the French ones. Waiters are a bit chaotic, and with the way of the tables were placed, the whole time you can see how chaotic they were...... I like the restaurants where you don't see the waiters for most of your dining period, but they always appear magically whenever they need to. Overall, we really don't understand why it was ranked number one, nor Michelin 3 stars. Food was not very bad, but nothing I would refer to as delicious, unfortunately. I will not return and will suggest my friends to spend their money and time elsewhere.",3,3,

This was served in an old fashioned glass with a large rock. It was a cocktail I would definitely order again. $18Caviar - served as a benedict with diced ham, smoked sturgeon, and cured egg yolk.

88,Jon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,125,310,4.0,11/6/2017,"I can't believe I'm giving ""The Best Restaurant in the World"" a 4 star rating. Completely missing the WOW factor you expect as far as food is concerned. And I'm usually extremely generous with 5 star ratings. But if you're going to be #1 you have to really be #1. Honestly the ambiance, service, and attention to detail is top top. It's why they're rated what they are. But the food was only good! It's so disappointing! I expected flavors, dishes I'd wish I could try again but wouldn't be able to until I somehow came back here. Not 1. If it wasn't for the service I'd say my rating would be a 3, maybe even a 2 because of price. I think the missing factor was that the food was bland. In fact the newly renovated venue was pretty bland and underwhelming as well.Now for the positives! Did a tour of the kitchen, it's totally calm and huge and clean and beautiful. Real masterpiece back there since the renovations. There's a real relaxing vibe to the place, that was great. You also get about 10 different servers come to you throughout the night, felt like we were hosted by the whole kitchen - staff really cares about what they do and take it super seriously. That was nice. I think they also do a great job of accommodating. If I had an allergy, or didn't like a certain type of food, you get the impression they'll drive over to McDonald's to get you a burger if that's what they think you really want and to accommodate you. Unfortunately I eat everything and I'm not a picky difficult person so I couldn't benefit personally from that level of accommodation they definitely excel at. Bottom line: they need to rethink their tasting menu because if you're #1, you can't have ok dishes. The dishes were just ok. Nothing amazing. Everyone I was with agreed. I've ate at many Michelin star rated restaurants and high end restaurants in general. EMP you have to really please introduce some WOW factor into the menu because everything was just OK.",6,1,2

92,Kazu O.,"San Francisco, CA",477,627,9,5.0,11/3/2017,"This restaurant needs no introduction, nor does it need any more amateur food critic wannabes (dream job?) like myself from validating it with our less than stellar choice of descriptive food-related words. With that being said, I'm just going to put this out there --- That ""#1 Restaurant in the World"" title is VERY MUCH deserved. Every single dish was executed to perfection, from flavors to textures to presentation. The clam dish was absolutely perfect, and stood out more than any other dish. The sturgeon + caviar + cauliflour cheesecake with the ""everything bagel"" had so much going on, and yet, still seemed to harmoniously combine all of the flavors together. The aged duck was stunningly delicious. I could go on and on about every single dish, but you get the picture.The service was top notch, and yet, unpretentious. The staff were happy to have conversations with you and they even let us take a look inside the kitchen! Such a memorable experience!EMP absolutely blew all of our expectations out of the water. Highly recommend trying this place at least once in your lifetime.",3,1,2

Updated review",Booked the day before they were announced as the #1 in the world. Guess what. They didn't get better or worse but booking sure got harder. Thankfully we got in before the madness. They are closing for renovations. So they are doing a month of 11 best dishes from the last 11 years menu. Greatness from the first bite. It's not as innovative as they usually are but that's expected when they are highlighting top creations from the past many years. I won't list dish by dish by each one was a hit. The carrot tartare was especially interesting. The foie was so incredibly creamy smooth with maple syrup in the middle. Paired with a 1976 Climens Sauternes. It was without hyperbole the best food/wine combination I've ever had. It was just insane. Insannnnnnity. Service top notch as expected. Wine service exceptional. We brought 4 bottles. $75/btl corkage. No problem. One other highlight was a visit to the kitchen. And they have a small presentation of a icee mixed by liquid nitrogen. Very cool. Met Daniel humm at the end of the night. Memorable experience. Worthy of Michelin 3 stars,1,2,1
94,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",229,142,835,3.0,10/13/2017,"I have been super excited to try EMP, especially after the new renovations. Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.Before I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I'm giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you're spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.Pros:- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It's a great personal touch. - There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal. - The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive. - The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set upCons:- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn't finish until around 10:20. - The dishes were good but not amazing. I can't honestly say any one dish blew me away. - At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn't a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel.  Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I'm not expecting a freebie but I've been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you're the best restaurant in the world...Overall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go. I am harsher on my critique as I expected to be blown away and was not. Either way, congrats on the new renovations and thank you for the great night.",9,,

Updated review","Several years ago, the New York Times published an article about Eleven Madison Park (EMP) titled, ""At Eleven Madison Park, Fixing What Isn't Broke"". EMP's evolutionary focus has historically served the restaurant well, distinguishing it as a pioneer of restaurant menu innovation and setting new standards in meticulous service.Our first dinner at EMP took place on a warm summer night in 2014. Our latest was on a bitter winter evening in 2017. The warmth of summer and frost of winter categorically influence the restaurant. In its latest incarnation, EMP's collective dining experience feels cold and impersonal. Briny, stark fare dominates the latest menu, with dishes ranging from caviar cream cheese to clam and fennel - all of which, pure dynamite. The technical sophistication of Humm's cooking demands respect. His latest menu feels like it was composed by a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders (which it is). Nevertheless, like the deep soils of the earth, Humm produces diamonds under pressure.The neatly-pressed choreography of Billy Peelle's front of house perfectly complements Humm's cooking. Like a hawk, Mr. Peelle himself will spot your dirty napkin from across the room, walk over, and gracefully sweep if off the table before a backwaiter swoops in to replace it. Every time a food runner catches your eye while he/she is bringing a plate to another table, he/she smiles at you.Minor, incidental service criticisms aside, EMP runs an incredibly precise and disciplined operation, particularly for the restaurant's size and volume, and almost to a fault. On our latest visit, the staff seemed so preoccupied with execution that they nearly forgot to have fun, which is what thawed and enriched our first summer dining experience. I would normally write this off to the restaurant having recently reopened, but not at EMP's prices. EMP shouldn't necessarily take a page from Blanca's playbook - the two restaurants aim in different directions. But I would guess there's something to be discovered in the void between them.",,,1
96,Sarah N.,"San Mateo, CA",181,194,970,4.0,10/30/2017,"I came to EMP on my first trip to NYC, to celebrate many occasions (two birthdays and an anniversary to be exact)! We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets. The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I've had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW'd by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case. STANDOUTS: - Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?! - Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers. - Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I've ever tasted! - Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish. COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato. - Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture. - Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn't sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate. - Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around. For the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint). However, the personalization and take home gifts were certainly nice touches and I would absolutely recommend EMP to everyone looking to have a nice night out.",4,,

I've read about Eleven Madison Park for years, saw it kept its 3 Michelin stars AND made #3 best restaurant in the WORLD this year. So my expectations were high to start with and they did not let down. We planned our next foodie trip from Seattle to New York and made dinner reservations months in advance.As soon as we arrived, service was everything you'd think it would be.. everyone was attentive, knowledgeable, personable; they just seemed like they enjoyed being there and were really passionate about the industry they are in. About 20 different people served our table throughout the night. One gentleman really knew his scotch and my boyfriend was very impressed with that! The food, I've read mixed reviews about it but for me.. everything was amazing! Lots of intense flavors, mixed textures, supple meats, and overall just a personalized and truly unique dining experience! My favorite part, I had requested a kitchen tour while the maitre d was out of office and wasn't sure if we'd get to see it. But towards the end of our dinner a man dressed in a suit walks up to the table, bends down closer to us and asks, ""are you ready to see the kitchen?"" And my hearts starts pounding! It was so exciting to go back there and see where the magic happens! He gave us a mini tour and had another kind lady fix us up a wonderful cocktail! Honestly, the experience was dream-like and was really the cherry on top of my trip and really pushed me to leave a glowing review!I can't elaborate enough how much I enjoyed our dinner service at EMP.

Updated review","My husband surprised me with reservations to EMP for Valentine's Day this year. Needless to say, I was ecstatic at the prospect of dining at not only the best restaurant in America, but the #3 restaurant in the world! Having dined at many other high-end restaurants I was excited, but also nervous, about not wanting to be let down with lofty expectations. However, from the moment we stepped into EMP, our magical evening began on a great foot by the immaculate decor and the impeccable service.We opted for a 5 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for our Valentine's Day meal. My husband had surprised me with an all-Riesling wine pairing (my favorite wine), which was an added bonus! Some of the Rieslings that were part of this pairing ranged  from $150/bottle-over $400/bottle, so you can imagine how delicious and wonderfully paired our meal was. Onto the food, which was quite possibly, the most flavorful meal I've ever had. What I enjoyed most about the vegetarian tasting menu was that the food may have looked somewhat simple at first glance, but once you took a bite of food, you quickly realized how much complexity and depth of flavors and textures was hidden in every bite. I absolutely loved the cauliflower play on caviar, the sweet potato with jus, the kohlrabi salad, and the mushroom risotto! There were also small touches that made the experience extremely personalized and distinguished it from other high-end restaurants, such as, the private tour of the kitchen, complete with a cocktail, the sea salt pretzel and cocktail at the end of the meal, and the granola parting gift (best granola ever!!). My husband and I have already decided we are going to be back for the 10-12 course pairing menu the next time we're in NYC!",1,,

A child under two years old just kills the entire experience.  A baby like this just shouldn't be there they cannot be expected to sit for the entire dinner and their wailing disturbs the rest of the room. So if you make the reservations there insist that they don't seat babies near you. Shame on the parents for not grasping the reality that a place like this is not appropriate for their baby and shame on the management for allowing my experience to be impacted by those most inconsiderate patents. Lastly the most egregious mistakes of the management is not trying to do anything to assuage my concerns. Shame on them for allowing my Eleven Madison Park dining experience to be ruined,,,

Updated review","Sigh.  I came here again after a few years and the renovations.  We came in the winter so this review is overdue.  That day their heating wasn't working so they called to tell us to dress comfortably (I don't pay over $1000 for a dinner for 2 to wear sweats..).  We arrive and there are tiny space heaters by our feet that did nothing.  We were freezing the whole time and had to keep our coats on.  Now, I understand this stuff happens, but you would think they would at least offer you a complimentary glass of sparking or something.  Nope nothing, didn't even apologize or mention it again.Onto the food, perhaps again it was the heating issue, but all of the food was cold!  My duck was one of the worst ducks I've had in a long time, strangely prepared and COLD.  Literally cold when served (it was not meant to be cold..).  The rest of the food was immemorable. This was my third time at EMP and we were truly disappointed.",1,,

111,Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",290,997,706,4.0,3/22/2017,"So here begins my journey of the Michelin star life...best thing about this place, the caviar is to DIE FOR. Before I get to it I should start from the beginning. Made online reservations and came here on a weekday around 9pm. Pre-paid- no tip required. You can buy drinks (DELICIOUS). Did the bar tasting which means it was 2-3hours vs. the table which is 5 hours. The bar tasting had 5 courses which was sufficient enough for me. Service was obviously impeccable and lovely ambiance. You get to choose between certain courses. I picked the duck over the oxtail (good choice on my part). I honestly had an amazing thing here. My favorite dish was the caviar- SERIOUSLY WHAT IS IN HERE?!?!?! I WOULD BUY TONS OF IT (if I didn't become homeless afterwards). I think it is around 70 bucks regularly if you order a la carte. BUT REALLY WHAT IS IN THERE. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. Real talk. The other dishes weren't that memorable- duck was great- not so sure about the skin but it cooked perfectly! I liked that they gave you a granola jar to take home (Um...DELICIOUS granola just FYI- u want to eat that asap). Came here for the experience and I think it's worth it (at least once). Caviar is amazing- worth whatever hype. i would come back for the caviar or to try the main table tasting... more courses and 5 hours. 5 hours is a long time... like almost a work day.",4,3,1
112,Lili L.,"Mineola, NY",104,152,64,1.0,2/27/2017,"I hesitated slightly in giving this a 1 or 2 stars, after all it has 3 michelin stars so who am I to judge?  But that said, I have dined at almost ten 3 michelin starred restaurants and several 2 and 1 starred restaurants...and this one barely deserves 1 star when compared to my experiences.  There are plenty of other 3-starred restaurants in NYC that are far superior than this one.  So for a price tag of about $400/pp (after taxes and beverages), go elsewhere.  If you dont want to read the whole review, let me illustrate it in a few senctences.  My husband is a huge lover of cheese and he was starving by the time we arrived for dinner.  Near the end, there was a cheese course.  Not only did I think it was gross, but my hungry cheese-loving husband couldn't even finish it.  And no, the waiters did not ask if there was something wrong nor was a replacement offered.Now, let me break this down:1. Service: pretty standard 3 michelin quality service.  Attentive and meticulous.  But do they go above of and beyond?  No.  We came a week after our wedding and they were aware of this.  We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled, but nearly every place we went, they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end.  Now if you go somewhere and say it's your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon, i don't expect every restaurant to do something special, but hey, my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection.  Another point: there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us.  We weren't eating too fast.  The couple next to us experienced the same thing.  No, not when I am paying for perfection, I don't expect to wait 10 minutes between courses. 2. Food taste: the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland.   And they have some sort of obsession with radishes.  They might be going for some theme, but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes.  Where's the variety in flavor and texture?3. Food presentation: this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars, to the point of utter disappointment.  With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses, the colors were very white and single toned.  The presentation was also very boring.  Again, standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths.  And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes.  White on white yells ""i don't care about this dish.""4. Ambiance and decor: average.  Overall nice with high ceilings.  However, the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs. I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs.  But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting.  Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs??! 5. Last note. They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert.  The torching is on an ~8 inch diameter dessert.  They then take it away to prepare the dessert for you...when they return, you get a piece the size of a half-dollar coin.  Where's the rest of my baked Alaska?  Also, my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish, but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cooking...who knows.Seriously, I have never felt that my money went to waste when I've dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but here I felt gypped.",45,17,6

Updated review","Came here for my boyfriend's birthday and it was better than I remember (I had come for lunch last time in summer 2013, so was very excited to return for dinner).First of all the service is spectacular. Someone reached out to me about a week before asking if there was anything special the restaurant could do because we were celebrating a birthday. That same person greeted us at the door when we walked in and remembered it was my boyfriend's birthday.Everyone else was also so attentive, and the attention to detail was incredible. The atmosphere, though elegant was not pretentious and many people (ourself included) were often see chatting away with the staff and laughing with them. Lucy Liu was also dining 2 tables down from us!We had about 4-5 glasses of wine each to pair with our food (we didn't want to do a full tasting, 8 glasses of wine is just too many), and the sommelier was wonderful and picked great pairings based on our descriptions of what kind of wine we like.On to food:They adapted everything for my boyfriend to be gluten free, from the tarts to the breads to the crumbles, it was very impressive that they were able to make all of his items gluten free.The first thing they bring is the black and white cookie in a box, which was a savory cookie with apple and cheddar; it's very cheesy and delicious.They then bring an assortment of small bites: parsnip pie, celery root with black truffle, rutabaga with celery and walnuts and salsify with garlic and thyme. My favorite was the celery root and parsnip pie.Then main dishes were the following:Caviar Benedict with smoked sturgeon, diced ham and picked egg yolk. I love caviar (who doesn't) but don't love ham flavor and still found it to be awesome.Foie Gras marinated with black truffle and mushroom - holy moly this was delicious. The bread they served with it was croissant like and was perfect. There's also an option for seared foie gras, but I prefer chilled, maybe will try seated next time if they still have it.Lobster, which was smoked and steamed at the table and then taken back to be plated, with fennel, clam and bouillabaisse. I don't like licorice flavor, but the fennel was not overpowering.For the vegetable course I chose the Butternut squash, which was roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend got sweet potato wrapped in bacon with maple syrup glaze.  Both were very delicious.For the main dish, there was a choice between duck and oxtail. I chose the duck, which was glazed with honey and lavender with plum and onion. The skin was perfectly crispy and there were subtle Indian flavors on the skin from cumin. I would've preferred a sweeter glaze, but the duck was still delicious and cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend enjoyed his oxtail but I thought the duck was better.They give you 2 side dishes with the main course: Brussel sprouts roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds, which were amazing and parsnip purée with variations of juniper, also very good.After the main course was a cheese course with bitter greens, which for me was basically a deep fried cheeseball and was delicious. My boyfriend's version wasn't deep fried.For dessert we chose the baked Alaska, which was huge and prepared table side. Though tasty it was a bit too sweet and alcohol flavored for me to finish.There's also the fun game where you match the chocolate bars with the type of milk (cow, buffalo, sheep and goat), I got the sheep and goat right, but switched the cow and buffalo.The chocolate covered pretzel with sea salt was delicious and gluten free!Overall I'm glad I finally returned for dinner. I'm looking forward to coming back after they reopen when the renovations are done, and maybe we will stop by their Hamptons pop up this summer!",2,2,2
116,Alex C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,13,5.0,5/4/2018,"This is a review from when I had the opportunity to dine here a few years ago. It's an experience I think that changed the way I thought about food and blew my mind for how absolutely amazing food can be. While food is of course very important, the service was so perfect. To this day I have never eaten at a restaurant that matched their level of service.Eating at Emp showed me how truly delicious food could be. I've eaten out a lot and I've worked at Michelin starred resteraunts but something changed in me after this dining experience. Certain courses nearly brought tears to my eyes from how amazing it was.What amazes me is how much they are constantly changing the menu. A lot of high end resteraunts just recycle the same dishes over and over again. I've heard some people not enjoy it as much but maybe the menu didn't match with them at this time. I think everyone should experience this level of perfection at least once in their lifetime.",1,,
117,Ryuichiro O.,"Anaheim, CA",10,2,0,5.0,7/16/2018,"Just wow.I've been in the hospitality industry for 17 years with the last 14 of them in management (including fine dining upper management) and I can easily without a doubt say that I was blown away by the hospitality from the staff at EMP, an experience second to none.Visiting from California and having wanted to experience the famed Eleven Madison Park for quite some time(yet not having fought for a reservation a month in advance), my fiancée and I entered near the tail end of brunch just yesterday, greeted kindly by Annalisa(sp) at the door, and were allowed to sneak into the bar/lounge area for an impromptu quick bite and drink to get a peek of what they had to offer.Our experience was nothing short of exemplary:We sat at the bar top where we were promptly greeted by L.J.(sp), one of the two bartenders for the day. He was very kind and helpfully guided us through any questions we had about the drinks and informed us of the food options available a la carte.I asked about some of the spirits on the top shelf, Matt, the other bartender on, was quick to answer a few questions I had and was very friendly as well.We ordered two cocktails, promptly made by L.J.. Creative ingredients, perfectly balanced with nuance and thoughtfulness, they were delicious! Quickly jumped into the highest tier of cocktails I've had NY or otherwise - and I'm an incredibly tough critic on the inside when it comes to cocktails, though I'll always be nice externally.We decided to order the Steak Tartare with Foie Gras, and the Herb crusted Duck Breast to share.The tartare was served in a bone marrow presentation and entirely capped with Foie. That was easily the best steak tartare I've ever had. The accompanying bread was perfectly prepared for texture and flavor.In between courses we were served some of their bread rolls- lightly flakey yet firm, hint of cheese on top and served with their in-house cultured butter thats topped with a toasted cheese crumble and was excellent.Then the duck came. Minimalist plating, duck breast alongside an onion disk that was baked with blueberries on top, then table side the accompanying sauce is added while being described to you. It was fantastic. My fiancée quickly said it was the best duck she's ever tried. I agree- it was the most elegant duck plate I've had, again very thoughtful flavor combinations with the peppercorn and coriander crust beautifully weaving through the flavor profile.Throughout our time at the bar top we had an excellent time chatting up L.J., he was very personable and extremely attentive. We told him much about our trip to NY and our places of interest, spoke about cocktails and the industry in general- he was very kind and accommodating. Near the end of our dish he stepped out of the bar for a moment.. didn't think much of it of course. However as soon as our dish was done we were approached by Annalisa. She kindly inquired about our experience thus far- to which our reply was of course nothing but delicious and excellent. She then asked if we would be interested in taking a tour of the newly renovated kitchen and back of house operations.. we excitedly and surprisingly obliged. Annalisa guided us through the diningroom and into their back of house staging area where the final steps are put into place before items reach the tables. Then into the main kitchen area, just off to the side was a small counter set up with two settings where we were led. There we had a central look at the huge expanse of the kitchen- it was truly impressive. We were poured a small glass of water each and introduced to Keenan(sp) who was a pastry chef there. In front of us he prepared a small palate cleanser ice cream bite which was literally constructed in front of us. We were instructed to take it in a single bite- it was savory and bright. There we stayed for several minuted as Annalisa outlined the different areas and operations of the kitchen, answering any questions we had and allowing us to take it all in (it's huge.. I mean seriously huge). Afterwards we were guided through the pastry end of the kitchen and back to our bar seats. We thanked her graciously for her time and information- she was wonderful. Now back at the bar, a small dessert arrives for each of us from behind- completely unbeknownst to us. An elegant chocolate and coffee bite for me and a multi component raspberry & ice cream bite for her. They were both delicious and well suited for our tastes.My fiancée and I look at each other and just can't believe the outstanding and wonderful experience that we've just been through from our impromptu drop-in. Never could I have imagined the level of courtesy, hospitality, respect, kindness, and genuine friendliness that we happened upon.L.J., Annalisa, and Matt, thank you for an unforgettable experience.Eleven Madison Park is doing it right and doing it exceptionally well. The stars (from any and all sources) are well deserved.",3,1,1
118,Michelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",1252,9,9,4.0,6/22/2018,"This place has plenty of people who work here. Nice people who smile but at points can look really stressed or body guard like. But our servers were nice, the previous comment was my observations of other servers running around. Pour water nicely and place silverware and plating symmetrically. Ask any of the servers a question about the food and they'll know where it's from.The 5 course:1.Caviar, ham, green jello, Benedict sauce, egg yolk, and homemade English muffin.2. House break, tasted like croissants and the butter had cheese crumbles, that was yum.3. Salad, I had ceviche, bf and his dad had the liver. We all tasted each other's, and I liked the salad the most, then ceviche, then liver. Kris (bf) said the strawberry is too strong in the liver. 4. Lobster claw. Very delicious!5. Main dish: 2 dishes lamb and the other 2 duck breast. I love the lamb, had two different parts: one fatty and the other shredded. The duck breast was super delicious as well.6. Ended with dessert: chocolate, strawberry, and cheese (goat). All separate dishes, my fav was the strawberry. We didn't understand why it took roughly 15 minutes longer or shorter between dishes. Maybe space for talking? How cool would it be if there was an option to choose how fast you want the food to come out after each or when ready",,,
119,Sabina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",757,95,137,5.0,4/16/2017,"Wow! From the moment you walk in, amazing. And no wonder this is rated best in the world! The most important thing to me is that when I told them I am allergic to Gluten they provided a menu that was as equal (if not better ) than the regular menu. Important because I felt like I was part of the larger dinner dates (party of 5). Service was exceptional, the menu took us through the history of all menus created here with a knowledgeable staff that walked us through all items.Also cool, how they prepped our fine red wine! Yum! 11 courses but I think it was really 13... either way 11 was good enough and then some. If you plan on going here, make sure you have time, it took 3-4hours. However all the dishes were served timely enough that I didn't feel like I was force stuffing myself and it wasn't so long that I was twiddling my thumbs. Also make sure you either have dinner guests that can hold a great conversation or you'll be sitting there staring at each other. Lucky me our table was full of laughs and stories.Highly recommended if you're in New York!",1,,
120,Tina H.,"Orange, CA",1,24,14,5.0,4/4/2018,"Had the bar menu and it was exquisite.  Hubby doesn't like caviar so he took the vegetarian substitution for their signature eggs benny dish (cauliflower and black truffle). Very good as well. Other highlights include Szechuan peppercorn crusted duck, foie with squash purée and pumpkin seeds, and a savory dessert course of baked cheese and truffle. The squid was interesting but I did take quite a few bites of hubby's foie dish.",1,1,1

123,Anne R.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",130,129,208,5.0,2/13/2018,"There are not enough words to describe EMP but to call them exemplary is just putting it mildly.  They live up to being the #1, (if not top 3) restaurants in the world.  Their customer service is amazing and the attention to detail is extraordinary.  EMP has been on our bucket list and it so happened that I was able to snag reservations around the holidays.  Coincidentally, we were expecting baby #2 thus when they sent me an email prior to our date inquiring if we were celebrating anything in particular I just mentioned it briefly.  Most of the reviews rave about their customer service and I wholeheartedly agree with them all but I think they definitely impressed us by surprising us with a cute baby onesie with their logo on it! I was completely floored and wanted to give our lovely hostess a big hug for their thoughtfulness and again, superb attention to detail!  You will NOT go hungry, we were definitely struggling to finish a little half way through the courses.  Although the portions are small, they all pack a punch and vary in savoriness.  I would also recommend trying their coffee presentations at the end.  You already dropped several hundred dollars, why not splurge another ~$40 or so to finish off with fancy coffee?",4,1,2

My favorite was the cheesecake caviar, and the signature duck dish was great too. The lobster was too hard to chew and white asparagus was used too much in the dishes - overall some of the dishes were too sour for my taste. Not sure if  it's because I'm spoiled by all the good restaurants in the city, the meal was great but I wouldn't say it's No. 1 in the world. I'd still recommend this restaurant as a Michelin 3-star experience tho.",,,1

Updated review","The first time we went to EMP last year (shortly before renos) was a definite 100/100. Water glasses seemed to fill themselves, the service was so beyond amazing that it felt they were one step ahead of you. The food was inventive and an experience.  We went back this time with a bigger group, and we felt it wasn't as good, warm and personable. We witnessed the wait staff drop china on the floor and another dropped a whole truffle on the floor after they finished  shaving it :o Also they gave me the granola I commented that they were so good last time giving me a nut free granola due to allergies. Luckily he overheard me and changed mine. At the end of the day it was still very good and some dishes were outstanding, and I guess since the benchmark that I'm comparing it to is EMP itself, it's a good sign.",1,,
126,Hanwei L.,"New York, NY",55,68,21,5.0,6/15/2018,"The spring/summer menu heavily features seasonal greens such as asparagus and pea. All the dishes are wonderfully arranged and presented. My favorite are the foie gras and the duck. The peppercorn & cumin seasoning for the latter is simply amazing! I casually brought up that I like mint chocolate flavor during the dessert course, and was surprised with a mint hot chocolate soon after. That was such a sweet gesture! The decor is lovely as well, and most certainly rounds out our nice experience.",,,
127,Mehr E.,"New York, NY",5,29,37,2.0,3/10/2018,"Dined at EMP in December 2017 and I have to say it was NOT deserving of either a 3 Star Michelin or a top spot on Worlds Best Restaurant. Service: ordered a non alcoholic drink, the ones with the foam on top and they brought it out without a straw. They forgot. Had to ask them for one. Also, water glass was empty for a few minutes before being refilled. Other than those two slips in service, it was fine.Dishes: Nothing stood out. The unwrapping of the first dish was a nice touch to start the evening but afterwards I wasn't really blown away or even impressed with the rest of the courses. The foi gras - ehh, the duck breast - I've had better. The lobster was flavorful and my favorite course -- but come on, this is a 3 Star Michelin, every course needs to be on par. I've dined At Per Se, Atera, and Blanca and I would put Per Se and Atera above this by a long shot. Maybe it was just this one visit, but I just don't see the hype.",2,1,
128,Dawn M.,"Baltimore, MD",98,58,5,4.0,3/5/2018,"So this restaurant is definitely up there in my top restaurants, but I would by no means call it #1. -The first bite was a cross between a miniature black and white cookie and a ritz cracker cheese sandwich- nothing special to be honest.-The scallop course next with live diver scallop and sea urchin was wonderful- so fresh and light with the uni not overpowering the dish at all. And it worked so well with the sparkling pinot from Burgundy. The bread and broth with scallop infused butter on the side was another meh for me.-The sparkling pinot also worked well with the next dish- the play on eggs benedict with sturgeon caviar. A solid dish highlighted by the smoked ham with the caviar for me- they also provided miniature buns so you could create an egg mcmuffin sandwich of your own- very fun.-Then they invited me back to the kitchen- very similar to the French Laundry and such a nice touch. There they prepared another bite in front of me- chimney bread with black truffles done in a relish, cream, and a garnish. Again, a great touch, but it made me uncomfortable. When I eat something wonderful I like to eat slowly, chew thoughtfully and breathe a little, close my eyes, it's all very personal. And here I am standing at the station with people all around me and the server waiting to escort me back to my table, and honestly I couldn't really enjoy the dish. -Back at my table the next course was a definite wow for me- hudson valley foie gras with ginger, maple, and pickled apple paired with an amazing Cadillac (similar to a sauternes). I don't think I've ever taken as long to eat anything in my life, just couldn't bare to end it. The foie gras was perfect and the balance of the crisp pickled apple and the sweetness of the maple along with the Cadillac was just......I will be dreaming about this dish for quite awhile.-The butter-poached lobster was next and honestly the whole dish fell flat for me. I couldn't get past how chewy the lobster was for one, and the butternut squash and chestnut and kale just didn't add any warmth to me- they really didn't add much at all, though the sauce that was plated with it was delicious. Also, I'm not a big fan of Chablis to begin with and it was too bright and metallic for the dish I thought.-The mushroom tart was a table-side presentation and beautifully done- not to mention all the black truffle they shave over the crisp top. Over the top? Perhaps, but I loved it as someone who will never tire of all the truffle! In general though, I love mushrooms and this very pure mushroom dish was another highlight for me. I was excited about the Cabernet Franc from the Loire region as well (also as someone who loves Virginia/Maryland Cab Franc). It was definitely WAY more tannic than I was expecting and not something I could drink alone, but it did pair wonderfully with mushrooms and really brought out the funk in a good way.-The duck dish was...disappointing, but not because of the flavors. I love dry-aging and the peppercorn and lavender crust was mindblowingly good. But. When the dish came out the first time, the duck was a bit well-done for my liking and after I had talked to my server about the lobster, they told me to please let them know if I wanted anything done differently, and they were very sweet about it. So I had them take it back and the duck that came back out was seared on top but raw the rest of the way- which was perfect for the thinner end of the cut. But once I got up to the thickest part, I honestly had to cut away some of the uncooked part because it was just too raw for me and I felt really bad having them take it back a second time. It was honestly a little frustrating to know just how amazing this dish would have been if the duck was cooked properly throughout- maybe not have such a variation of thickness within the cut to keep from the inconsistent cooking? Overlooking that, the potato and the leek dumplings were good and the 2005 Nebbiolo from Piedmont was perfect with this dish. I've never had a more divine-smelling wine too, just smelling the beautiful mix of earthy cherry and floral (lavender?) easily passed the time while I was waiting for the duck .-It was fun to get a completely different preparation of a Nebbiolo from 2016 to compare with the last glass for the cheese course. The alpine cheese with celery root was wonderful and worked so well with this sweeter, more acidic Nebbiolo. The winter greens tossed in a black truffle dressing were a throw away for sure though and added nothing to the dish.-Another oh wow was the pumpkin cake with bruleed butternut squash, butternut squash and yuzu ice cream with sarsaparilla. Such an amazing blend of gentle sweetness, salty and savory and then the acid of the yuzu just cuts it so well. The sweet Ramandolo complimented every bite, especially since the dessert itself was not very sweet to begin with. Another really slow eat as I hated to finish the dish.AND Yelp apparently has a character limit",2,1,
129,Jen N.,"Glenview, IL",0,21,9,5.0,3/25/2018,"I went here for a lunch service prior to the reno and loved my experience. The staff were very attentive and down to earth. I liked that they explained some history behind a few of the  courses and even did some tableside cooking, but they did it in a very tactful way and not for every course so it wasn't overdone.There will be some classic signature EMP dishes that every foodie will recognize (miniature eggs benedict in a caviar tin, honey lavender glazed duck, vegetable steamed in a pig's bladder). Those dishes may not dazzling, but they're fun and part of the performance of the meal.The jar of granola they send you home with is just as delicious as they say.I definitely would look forward to coming back and hopefully get a booking for the dinner service this time.",1,,1
130,Thanya J.,"New York, NY",129,11,30,4.0,2/19/2018,"I come here to celebrate my birthday. ""The Best Restaurant in the World"" So I don't expect that. For the reputation of this restaurant, I expected better. I think the reviewers at Michelin meant to give this restaurant 3-4 stars on Yelp, We experience that gap between dishes was too long and it happened not only once, but between several courses. If you plan on going here, make sure you have time, it took 3-4 hours. Completely missing the Wow factor you expect as far as food is concerned. The food was even a bit boring, and monochromatic. The presentation was outstanding as well as the taste. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Service was exceptional, everyone was very friendly and from beginning to end. Was welcomed by a box of delicately packed savory cookies, and then 11 carefully selected courses.  It was good, just not great.",3,,
131,Callie D.,"Irvine, CA",30,13,1984,1.0,1/12/2018,"Wow, what a night, I  left the restaurant shocked and amazed, not about how good they are of course, but  about How can that possibly be a Michelin 3 star restaurant!!? I literally took a day to process why Eleven Madison Park was named the Best Restaurant in the world for 2017. My conclusion is maybe that title put them at so much pressure that they have decided to go low key for this year's new tasting menu. I am just out of luck that I went in a few days too late for their previous tasting menu. My night was ruined after 3 long hours of bland unappetizing food.  I'm visiting from LA with my boyfriend and we already dined at Per Se,  Le Bernadine, Jean Georges, the river cafe, and a couple other Michelin restaurants before our dinner here at EMP, of course we had to stop here before going back to LA in a couple days. We are both huge foodies and dine out everyday, and we do know how to properly appreciate food. I tried so hard to love EMP, I really did, but I just can't:(  I rarely write reviews about restaurants on Yelp because I usually don't have too strong of a feeling towards them, So EMP really struck a nerve for me. I even called the manager at EMP Billy to help me understand why their new menu is the way it is. All I got was ""they do thrive for simplicity there so the food both taste good and really focuses on that ingredient alone. "" Nothing else. okay, this is where it all went wrong. There is nothing wrong with that concept except EMP FAILED at EVERY ASPECT OF THAT CONCEPT!!!!! Sure the dishes were simple, but it was visually unappetizing and tasted flavorless and uninteresting. I don't expect every dish to be plated beautifully like how most of the fine dining restaurants like to do, but I do expect every dish to taste delicious. I can't believe they could ruin foie gras and truffle for me. The seared foie gras tasted like pork fat, me and my boyfriend both agreed unanimously. The lobster was chewy, the venison was under seasoned and the foie gras wrapped in middle of it was unnecessary, the diced up squid was a joke, and it's pointless to go through and describe how every dish taste because they all fall under the same description: bland and unappetizing. The caviar dish was probably the only  dish that deserves a Michelin 3 star rating, and that dish was in previous tasting menus already. Service here was good, not really warm and welcome, just good. There was several times where we waited roughly 15 minutes for our dish to arrive, where we had nothing on the table and just sat there awkwardly sipping more and more wine.  There is also a no flash photography rule here:) all I wanted was a picture using my Polaroid. Not a flash photography of every dish. Sure is strict for a restaurant with no dress code. I am writing this to inform people do not come here at this time, maybe after they change their tasting menu again. Or else you will regret coming here and  be disappointed by ""The Best Restaurant in the world"" I honestly don't think they will keep this title till next year. Or maybe do go just so you can say you dined at the best restaurant in the world before that title goes to a far away restaurant you know?",13,2,
132,Justine M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,2,0,2.0,6/15/2018,"After 4+ years of living in New York and countless restaurant experiences that ranged from the good to the bad to the ugly, I finally decided to join Yelp after eating at Eleven Madison Park.  While I don't consider myself a ""foodie"" by any means, I do get to eat at the fancier NYC restaurants by virtue of my job, so I'd like to think I'm not a total rube.  I read a lot of reviews prior to going to EMP to get a better idea of what to expect, and I have to assume there is a certain degree of confirmation bias involved when reflecting on a meal that cost upwards of $500 pp, because no one wants to admit that they spent a fortune on an unremarkable experience.  EMP was certainly an experience unlike any I've ever had, but when it comes down to it the food was not outstanding and, I hate to say it... disappointing.  Leaving, I couldn't name a single dish that wowed me or that left me wanting to come back.  This also may be colored by the fact that the waitstaff gave me the same feeling I get when I'm followed around a store (fellow people of color will know what I mean), and I'm also pretty sure I got food poisoning but more on that later.THE GOOD:The day before our reservation, the restaurant reached out to ask if we were celebrating anything special.  We didn't respond, but did share what we were celebrating and got a very cute gift related to that after our meal.All of the waitstaff was super knowledgable and attentive, and answered silly questions we had about the MetLife building and what was going on at other tables.  The highlight of our night was watching the waitstaff very capably escort out a table of very drunk patrons.The wine pairing was very very good, with flavors that coordinated remarkably with the food.The decor and ambiance is very pretty.The wine pours are heavy! I didn't drink much, but definitely understood how that table got so drunk.  Plus, the last course comes with a bottle of apple brandy to drink to your heart's desire.THE BADI don't know if we looked less affluent than the other guests (or perhaps more brown?), but every time we asked a question about what was going on at another table the servers acted like we were trying to scam our way into getting something for free.  Just expressing some curiosity! You would too if you saw the crazy stuff going on around the dining room! The food seemed targeted at a non-NYC audience, with kitschy dishes like a savory black and white cookie and a play on a lox bagel in the form of a cheesecake served with caviar.  I'm not a fan of touristy experiences, but if you are this may be a pro.While the dishes all had unique flavors, some were outright bland.  The fluke and bass for example were really lacking in the flavor department.You leave with a printed out menu and some EMP granola.  The next morning, I felt a little funny and ate some granola, thinking I was just hungry.  I then had some pretty bad stomach issues, and since everything I ate in the prior 12+ hours was from EMP I'm pretty sure it was something I ate.  Although I did have wine, I didn't drink very much and left the dinner sober so it was not a hangover.Overall, if EMP is on your bucket list for the experience you should go.  But if you're more concerned with food than theatre when you eat,   you can get a better meal at a peer (or even less prestigious) restaurant.  I also can't shake the feeling of being othered, so if you're a POC I hope you leave feeling differently, but here's some fair warning that you may be looked at sideways.",16,4,

I'm not sure what it looked like before their renovation last summer, but currently the place is very quaint with it's large windows along the side, and otherwise minimalist decor.  I came here in late winter, so it got dark early, but I imagine during the summer months, the dining hall overall would be very well lit for most of the dinner service.Overall the food here was fantastic. Each dish I had was going to highlight a specific flavor / texture of what was served.  For the dishes, there were no specific guidelines as to how we should best consume the food, we were just served and let be. For the tasting menu here, there are a couple of times where we were given an option to choose what we would like to have. My favorite dish of the evening was the Dry-Aged Duck, and is still the best duck I've had to date. After the entrees, and as part of dessert, we were given this bottle of Apple Brandy. If i recall, i was free to drink as much as i wanted, but be warned, it's quite strong.Unfortunately did not get the wine pairing, but there is a full bar, where you can order something off their menu or go for the option where you tell your server what alcohols / flavors you like and the bartender will try to create something that suits your tastes. After dinner, you get the option to tour the kitchen, and on the way out as you collect your bags / coat, you're given a container of their house made granola as well as a menu documenting your dishes of the evening.",,,

Updated review","""Whimsical"" still best describes the dining experience at EMP. Expect the unexpected.Beyond excited to return and experience the updated menu and concept, our group of six actually extended the trip one more night to fit this restaurant in.  Will travel for food. Clearly. I love my tribe! Welcomed by sommelier Jane Lopes (of the Uncorked reality series following six aspiring master sommeliers as they prepare for the Court of Masters Sommelier exam), dinner started on a fun note. If you haven't watched the series, get to it! Fan-girl moment aside, Jane happily put up with all of our questions and decanted our wine. Two enthusiastic thumbs up from her for our choice too!We never ordered off a printed menu, unlike my first visit four years ago. The waiter simply asked about allergies and questioned us about our preferences; dinner began shortly afterward. Much like before, dishes were plated with great attention to detail. Most of the time, a fun twist ensued. The unknown is part of the experience.Center stage on the table, a large number of holiday wrapped gifts sat begging for our attention. We had a hunch it would probably be our first course (and not just decor). We were right. Well played, given Christmas was only a couple of weeks away. Designed to complement the caviar -with smoked sturgeon, cream cheese, bagels, and rye crisps-, a selection of small jars filled box after box: beet salad with apple & trout roe, smoked salmon with cucumber & pumpernickel, potato salad with mustard & quail egg, smoked mackerel & salmon with fennel. Boom! Welcome to Eleven Madison Park. Dinner's only just begun. It took us a while to get through them all, mixing and matching as we went along. I love a place that encourages one to play with food.This year, the Foie Gras, Honey Nut Squash (sage + cinnamon), Lobster (butter poached with rutabaga and pear), and Duck (honey and lavender glazed with turnip and huckleberry) impressed me the most. I happily sat there relishing each second that went by. I never wanted the three-hour-plus dinner to end. I can appreciate (and admire) all it took to birth them all.Served with mixed greens that actually worked very well and in a rare EMP moment, the photogenic ""Cheese Course"" (really a cheddar tart seamlessly disguised inside of an apple), wowed with its presentation, but disappointed us with its overpowering one-dimensional cheddar taste. Additionally, despite its showy flambéing right on the table, I couldn't enjoy the Baked Alaska. The rum drowned the vanilla and meringue's sweet and delicate taste, instead of enhancing it. Thankfully, the chocolate ""Name the Milk"" game ended dinner on a high note. For the record, I failed the test miserably. Pfft. Must. Play. Again. Complimentary St. George Apple Brandy was offered towards the end, but at 40% proof, I couldn't take more than a couple of sips. Ouch! Kudos to the women next to us who gulped much of it down. Impressive!Once again, I witnessed one of the white cloud-like tablecloths ironed and perfected on the spot. No creases accepted here. That attention to detail is what I know the staff strives for with every table serviced.  It's important to note these highly awarded restaurants keep raising the bar themselves, time after time. I've now come to expect the perfection with each visit; it's part of the marvel and draw.Once finished, we received jars of the famous EMP granola as a keepsake, along with a very carefully designed and curated copy of the night's menu.Full payment is required in advance. The set price excludes corkage fees, beverages, and tax. Like many NYC restaurants now, gratuities are not accepted. If you are planning a visit, check the website for the ticket release dates and reserve way ahead of time.Despite some minor hiccups, Eleven Madison Park still reigns as one of our country's best restaurants.It simply has to be experienced.",11,2,6
138,Geoff C.,"New York, NY",50,221,57,4.0,4/16/2018,"Servers and hosts were amazing and personable. But I'm not sure the food was worthy of being considered the best restaurant in the world. It wasn't bad by any means, it was still great. But none of the dishes made me feel like I had not had anything like that before. My wife and I both felt like some of the dishes were just slightly too salty, but this is just our tastes. The duck was my favorite dish and was fantastic. Perfectly crusted. The cocktails were also spot on. We still have a lovely experience though. And I may have just set my expectations unreasonably high (being called the world's best restaurant is a blessing and a curse).",,,
139,Jazz C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,112,370,4.0,7/2/2018,"We came here for dinner this past weekend. It has been a few years since we've been here but remembered how creative in taste and presentation it was, so was really excited. They also reno the restaurant last summer so curious how it looked.  The restaurant appearance seems a bit more simplistic than before but when you have super high ceilings, column-free, and large windows like that I guess not much needs to be done.  The service was near impeccable. A couple of times when we returned to the table there should have been someone to pull the table out to let my partner back into the seat.  The food, which included lobster,lamb and duck, was very good but fell short of expectations. Nothing really blew us away - taste or presentation. And if you don't eat any bread, which is excellent, one might not feel very full.  FYI - they no longer have the Gruyere Gougeres (we call it cheese puffs) so that was disappointing.  We ordered 3 wines by the glass that went well with the meal so likely a better option than the $175 wine pairing for many wines you might not be familiar with or varietals and blends you dont care for.  We went to Jean George last year and to us that was more of a Michelin 3-star worthy/top rated restaurant in the world experience.  We also went to Le Cinq (also top Michelin rated) in Paris last year and that was a superior gastro experience to Eleven Madison and worthy of the price and accolades, so make sure you reserve early if you plan on going there.  We'll go back to Le Cinq and Jean George. Eleven Madison, maybe we'll go back again in a few years.",2,,

141,Aimee H.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,7,4.0,5/27/2018,"Perhaps my anticipation for the meal got the better of me. Reservations are definitely hard to come by as they were snatched up instantly--FYI available on first of every month at 9am EST for the following month (ie July opens up on June 1st). If you mark your calendar (set an alert) and are prompt about making a reservation (literally watch when it hits 9 am and know exactly when you want to book), it's not impossible.Having given the title of number 1 restaurant in the world 2017, I think my expectations were too high. All the food was good, but nothing that would make me want to come back again or insist that other people try. They don't give you a menu of the food like a couple of the other three Michelin Star restaurants I've been to so I am unsure of all the dishes I had but the spring tasting menu included things such asLobster with dandelion greensRoasted duck Cheesecake with everything bagel crust and sturgeon caviar (probably the best and interesting thing I had there)Snails and morelsFoie Gras (sweet or savory option--husband preferred the savory one) FlukeTake home: blueberry granola Service was fantastic, as expected. I truly wanted to give this restaurant a rave review, but overall I was a bit disappointed. I think if you go into it without any expectation, you will probably have a better experience. Food: 4/5 stars (food for price point: 3.5 stars) Service: 5/5 starsI haven't been to many other 3 Star Michelin restaurants (Le bernadin, Alinea, Gordon Ramsey, Geranium), but I'm starting to think that three star doesn't really mean it's worth making a trip just to eat at a particular restaurant (but Alinea is worth going to more than once).",,,

I gave them a couple of ideas of things that she liked, and they put together a hand painted birthday card for her that was awaiting our arrival at the table. This went above and beyond even my high expectations!The food was of course phenomenal; I think my favorite course had to have been the eggs benedict.  I had been looking forward to having their dry-aged duck for quite some time. It was uniquely different than any duck I've ever had.We both loved the chocolate game at the end where you match four different chocolates to the various animal milk from which it was produced.  My girlfriend matched all four, and our waiter brought her out an actual legit blue ribbon haha.   What a way to end an amazing night at the top restaurant in the entire country.Special bonus-- George Takei was sitting a couple of tables away!",3,,

I dined here in April 2017, just before they shut down for renovations, and they were doing the ""Best of EMP"" menu, where they showcased all the best dishes from their years of service. Imagine the ""Now That's What I Call Music!"" CDs and how they highlighted the greatest hits of a certain era. It was akin to that, but only with EMP courses. And much like those CDs, I inflate my expectations that are doomed to never be met.They had some GREAT dishes--the Sea Urchin, Carrot Tartare, and the Milk & Honey (although I should note that no one else shared my sentiment about that last one). The Foie Gras was the SINGLE best foie gras I've ever had--even raising a candle to ones I've had in Paris. However, I couldn't help but notice some of the dishes were just so intricately executed, yet they were lacking in flavor. Here at EMP, there's no such thing as ""Less is more."" For example, the roasted suckling pig was just as good as the roast suckling pig that you can get in Chinatown for $7/lb. Also, the gastronomy-inspired Winter in Provence--was plain strange tasting. I will give them credit for their phenomenal service and accommodations, however. One of my dinner companions had a laundry list of allergies. The waiter patiently listened to each and every one, and assured that he too had a wonderful meal that thankfully did not trigger his untimely death. At the end of the meal, they provided parting gifts--a custom print of the menu we had, and a canister of house made granola. (The granola--I learned later, was better than my actual meal). The levels of service, execution, and poise of EMP are quite deserving of that 5 star.",5,4,1

Our anticipation and excitement peaked as we where seated . We have eaten at Alai'n Ducasse's restaurant frequently in Paris and were so excited to be here. As the plates began to appear and we tasted I became a little disappointed with the pairings of flavors . Maybe I'm just not into cheese...

149,Nicole M.,"Westbury, NY",142,253,901,5.0,11/26/2016,"Now I feel I can accurately write a review now that I have done the tasting menu in the main dining room (rather than just the bar- see my tip). I brought my fiancé here for his 30th birthday because all this guy wants is a good meal, and a good meal he received. I would say there were about 12 ""courses""- from mushroom appetizers, mini English muffins with eggs Benedict caviar, lobster, venison steak, potatoes with hazelnut spread, chocolate covered pretzels- all served as one surprise after another. They also had a guess that (chocolate) milk game post-dinner and a Baked Alaska cooked right in front of you at the end. Not to mention they gave us a bottle of Brandy and basically said the table is yours for the night; I like that they don't rush you out.In my opinion this is definitely a special occasion kind of dinner experience. Not only for the price (about 300$ per person), but also that it isn't your ordinary 3-course dining experience. The maitre de emailed me to ask what he could do to make the experience extra special- I recommend getting a kitchen tour because my fiancé LOVED this surprise! The maitre de said he would leave a note for my fiancé if I told him what to write, but for some reason the note was MIA which was a bit disappointing. However, they had a ""happy birthday"" note at least. They also gave us a departing souvineer which I appreciate for my ""memory box""- all the courses listed on a scroll type of menu, with our names on it. **Be aware that reservations are necessary and are online now, about 2 months in advance.

I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday and everything was truly flawless! Everyone who waited on us (even the guy pouring water) wished him happy birthday. I can honestly say its one of the best dining experience I have ever had and well worth the price. Some takeaways:-The menu is a ""conversation"" (as in you don't receive a physical menu) which allowed us to discuss our food preferences and make some decisions about what the courses would look like. Everything we picked was absolutely delicious! -You will not leave hungry! While the portions are fairly small, the number of courses will fill you up. We actually couldn't eat the final chocolate pretzel course because we were so full. Anyone who tells you they left hungry is either lying or eats an abnormally large amount of food on a regular basis. -If you get up to go to the bathroom you may delay your upcoming course. They will not ""drop"" food if someone has walked away from the table. And if that delay causes the food to be less than perfect, you may be waiting for a while so that they can get the food back to perfection. -The entire experience took about three hours. Relax, enjoy the experience, and plan to be there for a while. -At the end of your meal you get a gift. Right now it's a caviar tin with your printed menu and golden raisin granola (which is outstanding!)",1,,

Updated review","Eleven Madison Park pre-renovation used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I was excited to return to Eleven Madison Park post-renovation, especially with its newly appointed status as the world's best restaurant. Also exciting me was that this would be my 50th Michelin Star restaurant visit, so it felt appropriate that the grandest restaurant of them all would be the destination for this occasion. Previously, I had loved the menu, but found service and ambiance too stiff. With this visit, I was pleased to find a new casual vibe to the whole experience, but with all the magic lost from the food.The Good: - Service is now much more casual and friendly compared to my previous visit, and the new dining room is beautiful. I love the more relaxed environment. - Standout dishes were the taste of spring appetizers and the duck. Both were very well prepared and tasty dishes.- The team prepared a special gift for my new job, which was very cute and much appreciated!The Not So Good: - Everything I loved about the previous Eleven Madison Park food-wise has been lost. The whimsy and fun that made this restaurant special-- the carrot grinder, pretzel basket, etc.-- is completely gone, as if this is a whole different restaurant completely. The menu now feels a lot more traditional in its technique and focus, and is a lot more heavy overall despite having a lot less courses than the previous iteration of Eleven Madison Park. Presentation was lacking in my opinion.- Some dishes were really a miss for me unfortunately. Three people at my table deemed the goat cheese dessert inedible because the pungent flavor. The main course of snails and morels also had an unappealing flavor, akin to ""dirt"" by one person at my table. The lobster was tough and chewy, and the savory desserts were an unappealing end to such a heavy menu. - Service lapses. Though the service is (at times overly) friendly, there were a lot of service lapses that you shouldn't be seeing at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, let alone the World's Best Restaurant. My water was frequently switched between sparkling and still, despite a reminder that I ordered sparkling. Chairs were not pulled out when returning to the table, and one time my napkin wasn't even folded when leaving the table. Dishes were served to the wrong people at the table twice, and plates were not set nor taken in synchronicity. Servers also stumbled over their words quite a bit; we're all human, but that is not quite the level of polish you'd expect here. Now, I know some of these things sound like pretentious quips, but these are things you'd expect to operate flawlessly as this caliber of restaurant and it'd be unfair to not point it out. - I have some more subjective issues with the visit as well. You now have to make decisions on what you want for 4 courses, and I think it'd be a lot easier to provide some sort of menu for these choices instead of a waiter verbally presenting them because it's hard to digest (no pun intended) that many choices. Service was also overly compensating at times, as mentioned above. I love friendly and personable service, but there was a lack of the traditional professionalism I'd expect to see at this caliber of restaurant. Overall, I was disappointed in my visit to Eleven Madison Park. I have such fond memories of my previous visit, and although I love and embrace changes and evolutions to restaurants, I wouldn't even consider this the same restaurant as pre-renovation Eleven Madison Park. The food was the most disappointing aspect; even if it is not my preferred style of food, there were too many objective issues with the food as listed above. Service was really friendly, but it pales in comparison objectively to my other 3-Michelin Star experiences with all the misses mentioned above. Unfortunately, I will not be returning any time soon. Ambiance: 8/10Service: 6/10Food: 4/10Overall: 6/10",3,1,2

Updated review","I can't believe they have 3 stars and Jean George was demoted. This place did not live up to the hype. Service was good but not professional. The servers were knowledgeable but meal transition was not polished. The food was mediocre at best. I was expecting to see more seafood and meats, instead was served bread and fruits.

This time, however,y sister was in town and wanted to go - but we hadn't made the much-needed far in advance reservations. We showed up around 7:30p (they open at 5p) and we were able to grab two seats at the bar! The menu is an abbreviated tasting menu (I believe 5 courses but they added things here and there so felt almost like 7) and it was perfect. The bartender was amazing - paired great wine and drinks with each course, friendly and fun. It was such a relaxed yet exquisite meal. I highly recommend if you don't have reservations and are willing to roll the dice - try eating at the bar! If not - there are great restaurants in the neighbor to substitute with...",,,

The comfort we felt from the moment we walked it to the when we were handed our coats and ""gift"" bags was a true statement of proper hospitality. The food itself is a masterpiece of precision and culinary manipulation in the highest form. The service and presentation are unobtrusive yet exceedingly attentive. Every course was a picture waiting to be taken and the flavors were just perfect. near the end of the meal we were invited into the kitchen for a tour = side note if ever presented with the opportunity to tour or view an kitchen the caliber of Eleven Madison Park = TAKE IT! It is a show in an of itself. Once in the kitchen (after a view of the stations busy at work) we were presented with a Sumac Tea ""ceremony"" - just WOW.

Service: attentive and as expected to be. Good introduction of every dish, clean and neat from our waiters.However, we experienced that gap between dishes was too long. I dont expect to be waiting 10 min with nothing in front of me; and it happened not only once, but between several courses. I am paying for perfection to the ""best restaurant in the world"", so I don't expect that.We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and although everybody congratulated us, we were expecting something complimentary as it happened in other michelin restaurant celebrations. They did not offered anything. My standards are high when the price tags calls for perfection.Food: overall good and quality of the ingredients fresh and tasty. Need more innovation.Presentation of the food: except the carrot tartare and the little neck clams, the rest of dishes came on same two types of plate, lack of surprise and innovation.Atmosphere: it seemed a hotel old hall entrance. Nice high ceilings. Not cozy.

While it's slightly standard fixtures make you wonder if this is just a normal fine dining establish, once you embark on this culinary journey, you will see that this is anything but ordinary. The food is excellent. It is obvious that care and immense thought is put into every dish. If you have allergies or dietary restrictions, you will be taken care of with superb alternatives. (I would comment on the exact dishes but with the highly seasonal menu, all you really need to go know is that everything is delicious.) It is a tasting menu but you have a variety of choices as you go.But the story line that is crafted alongside this dish.es is what really makes EMP an absolute must for any food lover. It's a season story that pairs well with each dish. During our summer menu, we went on a picnic (with all the proper accessories) and watched fruit be grilled in tiny barbecues. We played games with season chocolates decorated with the leaves fund in nearby Madison Square Park. Everything about the experience is what sets apart EMP from anything else I have done.EMP is something you have to do. Whether you are living in New York or just are visiting, experiencing EMP is worth every penny.",3,1,2

172,Thom H.,"Syosset, NY",162,524,164,5.0,4/1/2017,"Our experience at Eleven Madison Park was transcendent - though not 100% perfect. Maybe, 95%.Now of course, on a five-star scale, EMP can't earn anything less than five stars. C'mon, now, it's #3 on the World's 50 Best list (EDIT: Yeah, it's #1 now). But maybe my observations can help future potential diners, before they plunk down more than a half-grand (for two) on dinner ...First of all, I got our rezzies (6:30p for two on a Saturday in late March), by literally waiting at the computer for the 9 am table release, as if I were buying concert tickets. So there's that.Our experience began before the date, with an e-mail from EMP, looking to confirm, and personalize, our meal. I responded with a paragraph about our backgrounds (he did ask ...) and why we were dining there (10th wedding anniversary). I got a polite reply e-mail.The information I shared was peppered by our waiter into his conversations with us during our meal. It was a cute touch, but felt a little ... artificial?As we approached, the building, and the room, could not have been more stately. I'm a sucker for limestone, and also for art deco design, so I was gaga. I was not gaga for our greeter, who was warm, effusive, and prone to open-armed gestures as if he were going for a hug. Hey, I'm cool with hugs, but not if that's not your intent ... the service from everyone over the night was similar. They didn't take themselves too seriously, but there was more than a hint of ... awkwardness? It could very well be that *I* was the awkward, nervous one, and they were trying to deal with me. Entirely possible. Almost ... likely ...As for the rest of the design elements, nothing was left to chance. Even the banquettes had pillows between the diners, as a kind of visual break. Nice touch. Some two-tops were sat across from each other, some, side-by-side. It was clear that that this was for traffic flow, but side-by-side eating can be awkward for some ...The final design element I wanted to mention was the working rotary phone near the bathrooms. It's old-school and awesome, and I loved it.I got the wine pairing - I appreciated the thought that went into the selections, especially for going local with New York wines (I loved the Empire Estate dry riesling).So, the food. Portion size was an issue on some things, like the lobster, and the flambéed Alaska (where the heck did the rest of it go?). But generally, the food was impeccable, and in some cases, transformative. The duck - after the duck at EMP, I don't remember eating any duck before it, nor do I think I can ever eat duck ever again. It will never even approach what EMP served me. The same for the foie gras, and the parsnips, surprisingly. Those parsnips blew me away.Wife had a similar experience. She loves mushrooms, and they redefined mushrooms for her.The ""New York"" touches were cute - the ""black and white"" savory cookie to start, and the ""eggs benedict"" caviar (though I wanted to taste more of the caviar - if I'm eating caviar, I want to know it).I really appreciated the final course, the ""name that milk"" game, where different chocolates were made (by Mast) with different animal milks. Though I failed that game, I definitely picked out the funky, grassy, or mild notes in the chocolate. Fun and also educational.The reason I can remember the meal so well is because they print up personalized menus at the end of the meal! God, how long have I wanted this. A record of what I ate! So impressive.As impressive as waiting at the door with your coat without having a coat check ticket. The only way they can pull that off is by paying close attention, which was a recurring theme through the night.Finally, the parting gift - the container of granola! I snacked on it all week, that stuff was crack.Eleven Madison Park gave us the best meal of our lives (sorry, Gramercy Tavern). I expected an outstanding meal, and I received one.I'd go back in a heartbeat, esp. if someone else were paying ...",18,11,9

Updated review","Ethereal.  Have the good fortune to have been to many of the best restaurants around the globe, specifically NYC.  I can say without reservation EMP is top 10.  This restaurant gets as close to perfection as one can expect - at the cost you would have the highest expectations, EMP exceeds.  Service is attentive, not imposing, food is creative, seasonal and simply delicious.  Each dish leaves you wanting the next.Will not disappoint, this is a must.Abbreviated explanation - go for the experience in its entirety, return for the granola.  If there were a food equivalent of the most addicting drug equivalent food, their take home granola is crack reincarnate",,,

I have never experienced such an attentive and psychic staff.  They must have a crystal ball because all of our needs were met even before we thought to ask.  For example, the staff would refresh our beverage pairings even if we only had a bite of a course left to finish.  We also asked a question about dining etiquette, in return we received a professionally hand drawn tutorial from their ""in-house artist""...what does that even mean!Needless to say, we were also impressed with the food and narrative behind each dish.  I'm very excited to return after the restaurant goes through their remodel.",2,,1
175,Shaun L.,"Portland, OR",58,12,19,5.0,3/30/2017,"Remember that movie Pleasantville?  It's from the 90s.  All the residents from some town are in this black and white world and everyone thinks that the black and white life is fine and dandy.  Then some random guy gets puked on by a rainbow and brings color to the world and the townsfolk realize what they've been missing all along. Not familiar?  Admittedly, I've never seen the movie; so the above plot summary is entirely fabricated.  However, my experience at EMP is what I imagine those poor schmucks in Pleasantville experienced when they finally looked up at the world and saw things in vivid vibrant color.  I thought I knew what eating good food was like, and then I had EMP. I'm a pretty seasoned eater.  I celebrate chefs like normal people celebrate Beyonce.  I hope someday to leave a bloated happy corpse full of foie gras and butter.  I've had Michelin starred restaurants around the world and this place blew them all out of the water.  The decor is tasteful and inviting but not pretentious.  Fluffy pillows on benches, cozy nooks, beautiful linens, and amazing flower arrangements greet you as you walk in.  The lighting is warm and welcoming as the ambiance strikes that perfect balance between casual and upscale.  The service is everything you'd expect from the no. 3 restaurant in the world: fast, attentive, gracious, and friendly.  Our server was incredibly kind and put up with our selfies, questions, requests for information and clarification, and even shared some personal anecdotes -- which made the setting feel even more relaxed.  The sommelier hit it out of the park when my friend asked for a ""funky strong fruity wine like they have in South Africa.""  A gorgeous Australian(?) chef came out and prepared a dish tableside (I almost tried to marry him as he was plating my lobster).  The human element at EMP was a perfectly balanced whirling dervish of style, panache, and hospitality.  Now to the food.  God the food.  Chef Humm really knows how to work his flavors.  Less restrained than a more traditional fine dining establishment like Le Bernadin, EMP throws out bold combinations of flavors and textures, beautiful tableside presentations, and a sense of creatively with the dishes that makes you feel like the kitchen would be a really fun place to work.  We opened with a gorgeous black and white savory cookie.  Hints of apple and cheddar with a rich, flaky, crumbly texture.  Delicious and the perfect way to start the meal off. Next, the sexy Australian chef comes out with a multi tiered rack of small appetizers.  All vegetable based and presented beautifully; each bite was a celebration of the distinct flavors of its star vegetable.There are several amazing courses which I have to skip over b/c of character limits on these reviews (The sexy chef is nowhere to be found during these courses.  I assume it's because he is planning our courtship).  They are all very, very good.  Trust me.  My favorite dish of the night is EMPs take on Eggs Benedict.  Small tins of egg yolk, ham and caviar are served alongside a quartet of adorable tiny biscuits.  I could eat a wheelbarrow full of this stuff.  The egg yolk and caviar is rich and unctuous with smoky ham flavor; and the biscuits are light and fluffy with just enough crunch on the crust so that you have that element of textural interest in the mouthfeel. Later in the meal, Sexy Chef returns with a large broiler pan filled with lobsters, clams, fennel, seaweed, and FIRE (the showmanship!).   I lose myself in my husband to be's eyes (and accent) as he pours a flask of fragrant white wine into the pan; and I'm swept away in the aromatics of the fennel and the wine as a cloud of steam wafts up.  My future husband then takes the broiler away.  We almost have our first fight.  He soon brings the lobster back on a plate and we make up.  The lobster is served with an amazingly complex and delicate Uni mayonnaise and some kind of sauce made up of lobster juice and magic. One last highlight was from another ""choose your own adventure"" course. A choice btw a sweet potato with apple or butternut squash and bone marrow.  I pick squash and my outraged companion chastises me for being from Texas and rejecting a sweet potato when there's one offered.  I do not regret my choice.  The smokey richness and umami of the bone marrow plays perfectly with the sweetness of the squash.  Her sweet potato is perfectly cooked with a crispy outer skin and a beautifully pillowy interior. My companion eats large bites of my squash and I try not to stab her hand with my fork.  As the evening progresses, there are more courses, amazing tea, decadent cheeses, and a very high stakes chocolate game at the end; all of which must be omitted for brevity's sake.  If I were so allowed, this review would go on for ages, but it's likely most of you have already stopped reading.  In closing, start saving your pennies and find the time to come here.  You won't regret it",7,11,3

Updated review","KenScale: 9.0/10Recently, I got engaged to my girlfriend. We chose her ring together but I wanted to pop the question when she didn't expect it. In the course of my planning for the ""engagement ceremony,"" I thought about which restaurant I should take her to after I propose to her. As someone who has been living in New York City for close to 11 years, she has been to many restaurants in the city. I somehow remembered though that she said she hadn't been to Eleven Madison Park yet, and also knowing that the restaurant is shutting down for renovations in the summer, I knew this was the perfect venue to have an engagement dinner. I had an unbelievable meal on my visit a couple of years ago, where the creativity of dishes combined with careful execution and commitment to fresh ingredients really showed why EMP is one of the best restaurants in the world. How did our engagement dinner stack up against my previous visit? The menu has gotten shorter (more like 8-10 compared to close to 20 last time) and the dishes have become somewhat more predictable (no more asparagus cooked inside a cow bladder!), but we still had an amazing meal.After a celebratory champagne, we were served with an assortment of bites. Among those, my favorite was celery root with black truffle and parsnip pie, and my girlfriend also enjoyed rutabaga with celery and walnuts. Just like last time, the restaurant served caviar in a playful take on egg's benedict; it was still as amazing as I had remembered, with the combination of caviar, diced ham and pickled egg yolk displaying so much wonderful complexity in flavor. For the starter course, I went with foie gras seared with maple and apple, while my girlfriend went to scallop marinated with leek and potato. Foie gras had silky smooth texture that I very much enjoyed even though I'm not really a foie gras person, and a bite of scallop that I stole from my girlfriend also had elegant balance of texture. One of the best dishes during our meal was the lobster. After the servers brought forward a long rectangular ""pan"" where the lobster was being smoked and steamed, we got to taste an amazingly chewy piece of lobster that I marveled at what kind of trick the kitchen pulled to achieve this textural excellence. The vegetable dishes that followed were also outstanding. I was more partial to the squash roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds for the way the squash really just melted in my mouth, but sweet potato smoked with mustard seeds and apple wasn't far behind in deliciousness. For the main dish, we both ordered the magnificently cooked duck glazed in honey and lavender and accompanied by onion and plum. My girlfriend, who is very partial to duck meat, absolutely enjoyed this beautiful piece of meat, which was even better with the side dishes of brussels sprouts and parsnip. The weakest part of the meal was in the cheese course. I just wish the kitchen put together fondue in its standard format instead of putting it inside baked potato that quickly overwhelmed the cheese's flavor. The desserts that came after, however, were much better. I could have the delightful apple poached with buckwheat toffee cake and apple sorbet every day for its elegant flavor without being too sweet, and chestnut cheesecake with sweet potato custard and chestnut honey ice cream was also quite delicious. The meal ended with a little game where we got to match four different varieties of chocolate with four different animals from which the taste of chocolate came from. Unfortunately, we only got one right...I didn't realize until I booked the table for our engagement that EMP has switched to a ticket system (similar to how other fine dining restaurants like Alinea in Chicago do these days). In other words, you pay up front for your meal, so make sure to find a commitable date that you can book. We both really enjoyed a fine cabernet bottle from Napa (where we are actually planning to have a wedding too!) to complement our meal. Services at EMP were still as outstanding as I remembered it. I'm really glad that our engagement dinner was a memorable evening, with awesome food, wine and services. Let KenScale's culinary journey continue, this time with soon to be my life partner!",9,4,9
179,Bert N.,"New York, NY",102,253,0,4.0,12/17/2017,"EMP has always been held in high regard by any food lover -- and even so much more after being named #1 in the world for 2017.  I liked the ambiance as it was not too dark or quiet.  The service was amazing as to be expected.  Much thought was given to the presentation of the food too.  This creativity was shown from the second we sat down.  The first course was a surprise -- caviar and accompaniments hidden in wrapped boxes, waiting to be open.  We really enjoyed the presentation and the caviar proved to be one of our favorite courses.  The rest of the food, however, did not really live up to hype.  I wished the creativity carried over to the flavors of the remaining dishes.  While the dishes tried to bring new flavors to life (e.g., foie gras and beets, pumpkin with seaweed and bacon, etc.), the blending of some of the ingredients just did not flow.  Should you try it out?  Sure.  Is it the best restaurant in the world in my book?  No.But, who am I?  Just a hungry guy willing to pay to be enlightened.",,1,
180,Dawid W.,"White Plains, NY",16,12,17,5.0,5/4/2017,"Well, well, well. After all the hype, fanfare and expectations, the #1 restaurant in the world did live up to its name. The service -- from warm email exchanges in the days leading up to the dinner, to the way the staff bade us farewell -- was simply exceptional. Über-professional-but-never-arrogant, the staff made us feel at ease. I'm a foodie with very high expectations for creativity and plating, and EMP did not disappoint. The 11-course retrospective was a great and actually economical way to enjoy the culinary hits of the last decade, without having to shell out a small fortune each year.The cocktails were refined, complex and beautiful. Photogenic like whoa! Still, I took only a few photos, and did so quietly and quickly so as not to ruin the elevated ambience of the whole experience. The food was stunning, precise, colorful and inventive and, as a geeky bonus, some of it reminded me of my own amateur gastronomical experiments from years past.This is my kind of place. I have no dietary restrictions, and I often loathe having to make a decision at fine restaurants (where everything is delicious). I'm all about maximizing diversity of flavors and textures, so the pre-determined tasting menu was ideal.My guest and I were there for a special occasion, and we got a mini-tour of the kitchen, along with a cocktail made on the spot using liquid nitrogen -- a fun interlude. All the while I was mesmerized by how organized the kitchen was. Insanely organized. Not like what you see in kitchens on TV, where chaos often reigns.When you consider how many people are employed here, and the cost of rent/decor/food procurement, the price of the dinner starts to make sense.Most of the FOH staff we spoke to had been working there for 5+ years, a clear and powerful testament to the venue and its ability to retain loyal talent. Where do you go from the top restaurant on Earth? Maybe Mars... Elon Musk is planning something, I'm sure... but is Wylie Dufresne available and willing? I'm not exactly a wealthy man, so it'll be a while before I can return to EMP for a full dinner service (and they're closing for renovation anyway), but I look forward to seeing how they reinvent themselves in the years ahead.No real downsides. A single typo in/on the cocktail menu was appropriately handled by the server and bar manager (#sorrynotsorry, I'm a grammar fiend!). Happy to help with copywriting/copyediting when the restaurant comes out with new menus! ;-)Priceless. Worth every penny! Thank you to Matthew P, Dmitri M, Mark W, Sarah Van D, Charlie B, Chris A, Leo R, Sara(h) the Commis/Liquid Nitrogen Queen, Captain Steven/Stephen, and the countless other teammates who made all of this possible.

185,Ross M.,"Reno, NV",110,190,781,5.0,4/1/2017,"It is very hard to label a single meal in one's life as ""the best."" Some days, I might feel that the best meal I've ever had was at a taco truck in Ensenada, and other days I might think that it was a five star restaurant in San Francisco. I have a little philosophy: a filet mignon and a hot dog are different but equal pleasures. That being said, was this meal the best I've ever had? Probably not, but it's certainly a contender. Was this meal worth the price tag though? Absolutely. Would I do it again? Most definitely. Do I understand why this is considered the best restaurant in the country? Yes, it certainly deserves the praise it receives.What was most incredible about Eleven Madison Park was that every single bite was utter perfection; nothing missed the mark in any way, and every single component of each plate was immaculate in itself, right down to the tiny garnish of marinated celery. Furthermore, at Eleven Madison Park, foods that I usually don't care for were suddenly remarkable, and were equally as good as my favorites.I asked for a vegan menu, and they graciously catered to my needs. And trust me, vegans aren't missing anything with the menu here. I dare say that my carnivorous friend was the one missing out.Chef Daniel Humm's creations were somewhat of enigmas. Here, something as boring as a carrot had an unbelievable amount depth, and something as simple as a potato was prepared to be an utterly complex journey of taste. Humm's dishes truly showed a mastery for controlling taste and texture. I could even sense his respect for food in every bite, and this deep understanding gives him limitless power of over his dishes.We were lucky enough to get a tour of the kitchen as well, which was a lovey surprise. There, we observed the gears and cogs spinning in flawless motion. There must have been forty members of staff all working in utter concentration to please their guests. In the kitchen, the pastry chef demonstrated a fascinating preparation of a maple popsicle to us; she took a stick, dipped it in a pot of boiling maple syrup, and proceeded to roll it on a patch of apple juice ice. The resulting taste was a refreshing, sweet morsel.This restaurant is truly a thing of wonders, and I'm so glad I was fortunate enough to experience it.

The dining space is grand and lofty, with large sunflower arrangements and plenty of natural light that make for a warm, inviting atmosphere. At $295 per person before drinks, EMP is hardly a bargain, but well worth it.

I personally don't think the food was worth a couple hundred. It was fun to try, but I am not sure if I would come back again. The 5 stars include the service that their impeccable staff provided. Overall experience was very nice.",,,

Updated review","I've been eating at the one top Michelin restaurant each weekend in 2016 and this one right here takes the cake.UPDATE: As of now, I have eaten at the following competitors in the last 2 months alone: Momofoku Ko, Brooklyn Fare, and Le Bernardin. And now i can say this blows away ALL of themThis is the only 2+ star Michelin star place I've been that that is almost worth the price tagOne of the best meals I've ever had - both food wise and service wise - and i never give out 5 star reviews.I walked in a total skeptic and walked out a convert.How this place is only the #5 on Zagat's top NYC restaurants is beyond me.Luckily, it takes its rightful place as the #5 Restaurant in the WORLD on San Pellegrino's top list.I came here for my birthday and it was really special.From the moment you walk in, everyone from start to finish knows and acknowledges your birthday from the reservation guy to the beverage guy, and almost every face you see during the entirety of meal.The meal has changed since Jan 2016 so be aware.Its now 8 courses spanning 2.5 hours instead of the old 14 courses over 4 hours, but its still magical. Its  $295 a person + tax and drinks, but tips are included, so it clocks in at one of the most expensive meals in the city.Our main waiter was young Giovanni Ribsi look-alike and this guy did it all. He took the orders, he brought the food, he cooked food live table side, and he had a story for every dish.The rest of the staff was awesome, and like other reviewers have said, are definitely just ordinary dudes. None of that pretentious ""all french staff"" some places had.. (i'm looking at you Le Bernardin)Its the small things that really make this place excellent. For example they will always make sure your bottle of beer always has the label facing you while it sits on the table, and they will even put it on ice to keep it cold while you finish your glass.The dishes were absolutely delicious, simple, with an amazing presentation all at the same time. Nothing pretentious like everything covered with truffles or a potato chip with something raw on top (yes EVERY restaurant is doing this stupid crap now with potato chips).I loved the fact that many of the dishes were interactive and either featured a small show table-side, or had to be put together - especially the mini English muffins with a side of quail egg omelette that you make into tiny sandwiches. Fun and delicious. For a 2.5 hour meal, I was not bored at any point. There was always something going on.Some other great tidbits was the all-you-can eat fresh croissants with butter and sea salt, the 2nd slice of dessert (once we asked why they showed us an entire pie table side but gave us only a tiny slice), and for big drinkers, a complimentary BOTTLE of liquor at the end of your meal (usually whisky or brandy, no chasers though, so not easy to drink). I found it a bit funny they are still doing their ""guess that chocolate"" with the Mast brothers Brooklyn chocolate after their scandal about how they are selling melted Hershey's at $10 a bar.Also, the goody bags with chocolate birthday truffles and a jar of granola when you leave was an excellent touch.Would I come here again? yes definitely for a very special occasion. The only 2 or 3 star Michelin restaurant I can say that forBottom line however, even after trying almost every top Michelin restaurant in NYC, I can now safely say that none of these places are REALLY worth the $300+ price tags and the Michelin rating system is a total sham.==========That being said here's my Ultra-High end tasting menu/Michelin Star grading sheet from Best to Worst:- Eleven Madison Park A- Brooklyn Fare C- Momofoku Ko D- Le Bernardin F- Semilla F",17,6,7
198,K M.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,22,0,4.0,6/4/2018,"Truly lived up to all the hype. Almost everything I tried was amazing. Their idea of eggs benedict is last meal worthy. Hit my marks for ambiance, service, food, and even drinks. If only reservations were more readily available...",,,
199,Candice Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",165,14,213,4.0,2/15/2017,"Overall fantastic dining experience. Was welcomed by a box of delicately packed savory cookies, and then 11 carefully selected courses. My favorite dish was the novel egg Benedict, where the toasted English muffin and the caviar topped egg-yolk was separated. For main dish you got to choose from three options. I ordered duck breast and my friend ordered ox tail. Honestly the duck breast wasn't tender enough to impress, and it was just ok. My friend quite enjoyed the ox tail though. For the dessert part we did not share the famous baked Alaska cuz I tried it elsewhere and did not really like the strong alcohol taste. The whole meal finished with a chocolate tasting game, ""Name that Milk"", where you got match four different milk used in the chocolates to the correct animals. Afterwards they offer home-made granola to take home. Would love to come here again for some special occasions.",4,1,1
